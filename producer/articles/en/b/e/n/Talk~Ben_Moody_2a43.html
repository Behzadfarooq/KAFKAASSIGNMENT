<p>Is there any explicit indication that the abusive boyfriend is Ben Moody? While it could make sense, it said in the interview/article sourced that she refuses to comment on who it is.--218.102.124.51 16:01, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The implication is pretty strong. However, it is an UNSUBSTANTIATED allegation that is being made by Amy Lee. As such, it may or may not be true, is potentially libelous, and should most likely be removed.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/n/Talk%7EBen_Moody_2a43.html" title="Edit section: REMOVED ABUSE SECTION">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">REMOVED ABUSE SECTION</span></h2>
<p>I removed the whole section relating to the alleged abuse (see <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>). Having read both sources, there is NOTHING to say that he was physically abusive. While her attorneys have described it as an "abusive relationship", and Lee has said various uncomplimentary things about Moody, there is no way we can definitively state he was physically and emotionally abusive. The most that should be included is a note about the attorney's description of the relationship, and possibly some quotes from Lee. <a href="../../../d/j/b/User%7EDjbrianuk_0376.html" title="User:Djbrianuk">exolon</a> 05:12, 4 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Based on all the videos and interviews I've seen, it was Amy that treated Ben like shit so if Ben was involved in any physical/emotional abuse, in my opinion, it was Amy who brought it on herself in the first place. On the other hand, the fact that Ben was dealing with severe depression and couldn't do a damn thing without having a drink or popping some pills for a long period of time leads me to believe that he is in fact the abuser she is talking about. I can't say with absolute certainty that that's the case, but I believe they both are at fault for what happened then and also lead him to leave the band. So to sum up - Amy treated Ben like crap in most of the vids I've seen of them together and Ben finally had enough and fought back. I'm on Ben's side although I don't agree with him physically abusing her if that is what happened. Maybe she was trying to beat the hell out of him first and he was just defending himself. I do know that when Amy was asked point blank if Ben was the abuser she was referring to in the infamous Blender interview, she sharply sucked in her breath and bit her lip. Why would she do that if Ben wasn't the abuser?66.212.64.234 00:10, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thank goodness you put that. To suggest that a physically/emotionally abused person is responsible for the abuse they have received is disgusting and very offensive. <a href="../../../s/i/o/User%7ESion6_26e8.html" title="User:Sion6">Sion</a> 10:56, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>That's not what I meant to say BTW. I was just saying that it's possible she provoked Ben into beating her or whatever. So I guess it's her fault, but Ben didn't have to take it that far. I'm not pro-abuse if that's what you're thinking. I guess they're both at fault.</p>

<dd>Please don't contradict yourself. Either way, don't use this site as a platform to spread inflammatory rumors. Oh, and sign your comments.

<p>I'll use this site however I wanna use it. Quit trying to tell me what to do. And I'll not sign my name if I don't wanna sign it either.</p>
<p>i dont think that ANYONE should say ANYTHING about something they dont know anything about, AMY LEE (or anyone for that matter) dosent deserve to be abused, nobody 'asks' for it, you dont know them both personaly so dont have your say and then add "in my opinion" because your opinion DOSENT COUNT as ANYTHING, nobody deserves that kind of treatment so keep your mouth shut. and about the Infamous blender interview, dont go persuading people to think amy is bad, you dont know that. just sut your mouth and keep it closed. (im not on anyones side here but i disagree with what you have been saying about amy just as you would if i wrote horrible things about ben)</p>
<p>I think you're an idiot. Apparently you yourself are a victim of abuse. Don't lash out at me just cuz I spoke my mind jackass. Everyone's opinion counts as something. Even yours, however retarded it may be. Quit acting like you're all tough cuz you're probably just some pussy hiding behind the screen anyway. Just cuz I persuaded YOU that Amy was bad doesn't mean I'm persuading everyone else dumbass. People, for the most part, can think for themselves. They can also say what they want to say cuz it's a free country. I couldn't care less if you wrote horrible things about either of them. You can say what you wanna say and so can I. So shut the hell up and quit whining about nothing. It's my OPINION and I'm allowed to say it. Get over it, get a life, and learn how to spell before you launch your idiotic comments into cyber space.</p>
<p>This is...funy as hell. To be honest, the US Constitution says "Innocent until proven guilty". And since Ben is a US Citizen, that applies to him. So, he is innoncent because there is no proof. Also, if you haven't noticed, Amy Lee says everyone abuses her (Ben, Shaun, her manager) - anyone see a pattern?</p>

you are both pathetic. why are you arguing about something none of you have any idea about other than what you read about. you both werent there so both of you shut up! ok? <a href="../../../z/a/c/User%7EZacanescence_8bee.html" title="User:Zacanescence">Zacanescence</a> 12:38, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Why add fuel to the fire? Trying to tell someone to shut up online is just as pathetic as you claim they are.</p>
<p>The fact that you had to add your dumbass comments makes you just as idiotic as the other 2 morons. Of course, the same goes for me as well, but at least I can RECOGNIZE that.</p>
<p>when did they say they were a victim of abuse? thats just another dumbass asumption of yours. sucks to be you! (whoever you are who dosent sign there comments and the one defending ben moody)</p>
<p>I never said they said they were a victim of abuse dipshit. I just said that the reason they lashed out like that was probably cuz they themself were an abuse victim. Sucks to be me? Sucks to be you jackass. And I'm not defending ANYONE you moron. I'm just saying what I think. You don't like it, oh well.</p>
<p>wow, you have some serious issues, that you have to call everyone names even when they're trying to stop the arguement <a href="../../../z/a/c/User%7EZacanescence_8bee.html" title="User:Zacanescence">Zacanescence</a> 09:40, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Seems to me that you started it by calling them pathetic dude. Try keeping those kinds of comments to yourself and see what happens. You might surprise yourself. And learn how to spell before you post stuff too.</p>

<dd>I wonder about the advisability of posting this here, but it is incontrovertible proof of his real name, to my mind. Property records from a county where he owns a home list the owner's full name as <b>Moody, Ben Robert II</b>. The address for the owner is a California address, and it is safe to assume that this is Ben Moody the musician rather than his father. His father's home is listed as well, with his mother Melissa Moody, who is a relatively well-known photographer, listed as co-owner. It's clear to me that Ben Robert Moody is his father, Melissa Moody is his mother, and he is <b>Ben Robert Moody II</b>. Also, <a href="http://evanescencereference.info/wiki/index.php?title=Ben_Moody" class="external text" title="http://evanescencereference.info/wiki/index.php?title=Ben_Moody" rel="nofollow">the Evanescence Reference wiki page on Ben Moody</a> lists his full name as Ben Robert Moody II, and it is probably the most accurate source of Evanescence information on the internet, since it is essentially a joint project of EvBoard and Evthreads. As I said, this is pretty much incontrovertible evidence. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_64.132.242.232_e50d.html" title="Special:Contributions/64.132.242.232">64.132.242.232</a> (talk) 17:57, 29 December 2006 (UTC).</small></dd>

<p>Ahem. His ex-fiance contacted me a year ago, and told me *HERSELF* that it's Ben Robert Moody the 3rd. So, no. It's not the second. - benmoody0220</p>
