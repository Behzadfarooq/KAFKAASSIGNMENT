<p>Someone seems particularly interested in defining Stiller's background as being non-Jewish. Stiller has never claimed to be Roman Catholic, although he does admit to being non-practicing as a Jew. Prior to his parents' marriage, his mother (<a href="../../../a/n/n/Anne_Meara_4f26.html" title="Anne Meara">Anne Meara</a>) converted to Judiasm. Both he and his sister attended Hebrew school and he was bar mitzvahed. From a September 1999 article about Jerry Stiller and Anne Meara:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Their children went to Jewish schools, studied Hebrew and their son, Ben Stiller, had a Bar Mitzvah. "Where they take their lives religiously is entirely up to them of course, but at least they know where Anne and I stand in terms of our background. It was more Anne than anyone else who said, 'I want my kids to be brought up Jewish.' So I had a very wonderful, easy kind of situation. I never asked Anne to convert to Judaism; she did it voluntarily." <a href="http://www.cjnews.com/pastissues/99/sept30-99/tab/tab1.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cjnews.com/pastissues/99/sept30-99/tab/tab1.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>

<p>I'm not sure what "officially Jewish" means, as there is no "official" prescription for Jewishness.

<dd>Dudes, the trivia note on Ben Stiller "just walking past" in the Tenacious D video is hopeless. The only reason he walks past as a cameo is that in that music video he plays the major role of THE DEMON!!!!! Go back and check the video. His demon character is awesome.</dd>

<p>Why is the list called "Selected filmography" when it contains several unnotable films that don't even have articles on Wikipedia, and/or had Stiller only playing small parts (such as "Tony Robbins-style character")?</p>
<p>It is also my opinion that the fair use images featured in the section "Comedy career" do not qualify as fair use, because according to the fair use criteria that is inside the fair use template, those kind of screenshots are to be used "for identification and critical commentary on the film and its contents", which I don't see this article doing. You should consider this for now; I will compare how other articles do it before giving my final say.</p>

<dl>
<dd>I added the films within the filmography as they are described above in his film career and there is also mention of his multiple cameos, which some of his later films (that currently have no articles) are listed and I have also included his earliest films to show how his film career started. Although some of these do not have articles as of yet, it is possible that they will in the future. It is still called selected filmography since not every single one his films is included, just some of the more notable ones. For the screenshots, I added them, as currently many of the other GA actors/actresses have screenshots with similar fair use rationales. It says the film and its contents, and I'd assume that the actor within the film would be included. I have attempted to search the fair use rationale page with no success in it declaring that actors cannot have screenshots on their pages. The screenshots depict Stiller in two important roles in his career and both do have fair use rationales. If you still think that the filmography needs to be changed, let me know and I'll rework it. However, I do think that the screenshots should remain in accordance to similar articles. Thanks for reviewing the article. --<a href="../../../n/e/h/User%7ENehrams2020_121d.html" title="User:Nehrams2020">Nehrams2020</a> 04:46, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I buy your explanation to the movies in the selected list. But I don't buy it for the images -- <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_a984.html#Policy" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">Wikipedia:Fair use#Policy</a> #8 says that fair use images should contribute significantly to the article and not just serve illustrative purposes. I do not consider the images, as they are used in this article, contribute significantly to the article.</dd>
<dd>There are other issues with the article that could be improved. This includes the lead section, that could be significantly improved as per <a href="../../../l/e/a/WP%7ELEAD_4179.html" title="WP:LEAD">WP:LEAD</a>. Talking about the lead, have you intended to contiuously keep updating the sentence of Stiller's most recent role. And are you also planning the same for the section entitled "Upcoming work"?</dd>
<dd>Another point I'd like to raise is that it should be possible to expand significantly on the article, including more biographical details, with quotes from notable people in the business, etc. Other information is of trivia-character and should preferably be integrated into the bography, such as his comedy career inspiration.</dd>
<dd>Despite this, I am still considering granting it GA status, because my concerns are not that crucial. I'll just give you a chance to comment first.</dd>

<dd>No problem, I appreciate your efforts. I kept the pictures in accordance to silmilar GAs with screenshots such as <a href="../../../k/e/v/Kevin_Spacey_d826.html" title="Kevin Spacey">Kevin Spacey</a>, <a href="../../../s/e/a/Sean_Bean_2684.html" title="Sean Bean">Sean Bean</a>, <a href="../../../n/a/t/Natalie_Portman_22ce.html" title="Natalie Portman">Natalie Portman</a>, <a href="../../../e/m/m/Emma_Roberts_827b.html" title="Emma Roberts">Emma Roberts</a>, and also <a href="../../../d/r/e/Drew_Carey_a920.html" title="Drew Carey">Drew Carey</a>/<a href="../../../s/a/m/Samuel_L._Jackson_663e.html" title="Samuel L. Jackson">Samuel L. Jackson</a> which I helped to get passed to GA before. I do watch the page everyday and remove images without fair use and ones that are added inappropriately. For the lead section and upcoming work, I will be watching it very closely, just as I watch the Samuel L. Jackson page. I update it based on upcoming films, revealed roles, and involvement with other industries. I even have news alerts in news.google.com for the two actors so I can always keep up to date on new information. For the biography details, there is a biography book that is due for release in a few months that will reveal more about his earlier life which I will include as soon as I get my hands on it. I will always be seeking to improve the article as new details arise and I find new sources. I was fortunate for him to have a new film released, allowing for multiple interviews about his career. At this point right now, I feel it reaches GA, and I will continue to keep improving it to reinforce its GA if it's passed. --<a href="../../../n/e/h/User%7ENehrams2020_121d.html" title="User:Nehrams2020">Nehrams2020</a> 00:54, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
