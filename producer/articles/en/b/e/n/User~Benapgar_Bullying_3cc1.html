<p>Mr. Wales, there is a lot of bullying going on in Wikipedia. It makes for a very toxic social environment and should be one of your top concerns.</p>
<p>The sheer number of administrators means it is very likely that there are not just several administrators who are bullies on Wikipedia, but several <i>gangs</i> of bullies. A school of 1000 is likely to have several groups of bullies, and there is no reason why Wikipedia would be an exception. Wikipedia is the perfect environment for a bully, even better than a school. The bully can assume a position of power by becoming an administrator quite quickly and easily, especially considering the apparent willingness to promote nearly every user who is nominated. Reverting vandals and correcting spelling and grammar mistakes can provide a long list of edits. After creating a few articles and winning a few easily winnable arguments to establish their competence, the bully can <i>and will try to</i> become an administrator. Bullies who are administrators can also recruit and enable the promotion of sycophants--and this has likely been happening since the <i>very first bully</i> became an administrator. Further, volunteers are often targets of bullies, as bullies see a willingness to give of oneself as a vulnerability. While a school or workplace--even a volunteer workplace--has a static hiearchy, Wikipedia has a dynamic hierarchy. Wikipedia's noteriety--the number one result in Google for hundreds of topics--and a dictation of all knowledge, is a magnet for those not interested in creating an encylopedia, but in wielding power: bullies, narcissists, and sociopaths. It is evident from places like Usenet that this occurs. Wikipedia is no different, and by its nature and stature is actually many, many, times more enticing to those kinds of people. Even the least competent of bullies can become administrators.</p>
<p>Given that these groups can use regular Wikipedians (as opposed to other administrators with equal power) as their targets, and that other administrators have other concerns, this can reach (and I believe has reached) epidemic proportions. Bullies can avoid being caught by focusing on certain articles and targets and relying on other administrators to act as ambivalent bystanders in the event they are caught. Gangs and groups can congregate in IRC, away from the eyes of other administrators--though they are often not looking in the first place. There are already clear hiearchies within certain groups of administrators, with one administrator acting as leader (the head bully). The ad hoc voting system encourages the recruitment of attention-seekers who act as the lead bully does in order to seek and obtain approval from the head bully. This also results in <a href="../../../m/o/b/Mobbing.html" title="Mobbing">mobbing</a> of individuals.</p>
<p>I am asking you to act on this very grave problem which could--with no exaggeration--destroy Wikipedia. This is a serious problem you must address now. You may disagree it is at the point of an epidemic, but refusal to face the fact that there are bullies on Wikipedia, in all levels of the Wikipedia bureaucracy, and that there are users being bullied right now just by virtue of the size of the community, can and will lead to the disaster that Usenet has become.</p>
<p><b>We, the undersigned, believe that bullying is currently a grave problem on Wikipedia and has reached, or, without intervention, will reach, epidemic proportions. Bullying is injurious to your users and threatens the future of Wikipedia. We demand this issue be addressed.</b> (please edit this section only if you wish to be considered as a signatory to this petition)</p>

<li><a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_baas_eec8.html" title="User:Kevin baas">Kevin baas</a> 00:21, 18 January 2006 (UTC) The "other views" suggestion contains an <a href="../../../a/d/_/Ad_hominem.html" title="Ad hominem">ad hominem</a> circumstantial argument, and nothing but. Though this petition may have been inspired by the user's personal experience and interpretation, that does not neccessarily mean that his argument is logically wrong. While the tone/style of this petition is too strong for my taste, I support it in logic, and particularly I believe that the policy for electing administrators has been too liberal, and the (more or less assumed) policy for removing their administrative privileges is too tolerant. I believe that if an administrator exceeds their authority on even one account, that reflects clearly on their character and disposition, and they should be out. I believe that it should be more difficult to become an administrator, and that there should be a strict one strike, you're out policy. We have enough administrators. What we lack is rule of law.</li>

<li>I agree with the sentiments expressed by <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_baas_eec8.html" title="User:Kevin baas">Kevin baas</a>. I agree that bullying is a serious problem on Wikipedia.

<li>Bullying, and more specifically mob stalking are problems in Wikipedia, how to address this is another issue, but its an issue which definitely needs to be dealt with. <a href="../../../t/d/c/User%7ETDC_c89f.html" title="User:TDC">DTC</a> 15:26, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDartignan_0db0.html" title="User:Dartignan">Dartignan</a> 01:00, 28 January 2006 (UTC) Bullying is a very serious problem on Wikipedia especially among the administrators, but also in ganging up on a user to push the desired change in an article. The real problem is the lack of resolve with regards to administrative abuse and the subsequent whitewash that there is a serious issue with this on Wikipedia.

It is associated with POV pushing and other major problems with Wikipedia's community, including <a href="../../../b/i/t/WP%7EBITE_9c7e.html" title="WP:BITE">WP:BITE</a> issues. It gets to the point where if you try to stand up for anyone, you risk being banned for it. Sometimes it gets to where you want to be banned so that you don't have to deal with it. Wikipedia also do nothing about people stalking you.

Anything Zordrac has to say on the subject of bullying must be taken with a grain of salt; making malicious false accusations against other editors and trying to reveal what you believe to be the real name of someone who chooses to remain pseudonymous surely count as bullying, but Zordrac continues to engage in the former and continues to encourage the latter. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 05:13, 28 January 2006 (UTC)</i></dd>

<p>Tell me how this affects the "credibility" of the petition. Want me to take my signature off of it? No... You would have said that. Instead you are talking about the credibility of the whole peitition. Like the petition itself is in jeopardy somehow because I wrote it. Hmm... is that it? Maybe you would rather just say the petition has zero credibility simply because I wrote it?</p>
<p>And you guys do realize that I didn't make this petition about any of you in particular, just about the bullying on Wikipedia. You know who made it about you? You guys did! I'm growing tired of your stupidity. I mean, it's possible that some of the people signing this aren't trying to delegitimize an anti-bully petition, but are actually just confused by FM's ad hominem. Maybe I'll just take this crap off again. Heh, try to get an admin to block me for reverting trolls on my own userpage! That would almost be a better example than your responses!--<a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenapgar_6305.html" title="User:Benapgar">Ben</a> 10:05, 22 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Through my own experience with people like FeloniousMonk and quite frankly the majority of everyone who signed up there. Now, before you say "gotcha" which I know you're itching to say--This a petition to stop bullying, not an RFC against any of them. It doesn't say <i>anything</i> about <i>any</i> of them. Unless they're bullies and feel threatened by Jimbo cracking down on bullying...*cough*... I don't see why anyone would try to discredit it. Discrediting my signature, sure I can understand that, but if you think I'm a bully then maybe you should just laugh as I shoot myself in the foot signing an anti-bullying petition. That's what I was planning to do, laugh, since that's what I thought these bullies would do; I could laugh at Duncharris and FeloniousMonk and Jim and whatnot as they signed their own death warrant just to annoy me. Jimbo would say "Look, quite a lot of signatures, let's crack down" and then boom they're out based on a petition they signed themselves, which of course would be quite ironic, and I would think it was funny. Alas, they thought it would be easier to just reveal themselves this way, which is a bit more annoying, but still pretty funny I think. --<a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenapgar_6305.html" title="User:Benapgar">Ben</a> 10:52, 22 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Gotcha aside, the fact is then that you feel your experiences with these editors, myself included I'd imagine, revealed the rampant bullying on Wikipedia to you. Surely, that suggests this is directly about the 'ID cabal'. You diagnosed the problem based on their actions.</dd>
<dd>Funnily, many people here seem to feel your actions have been less than civil, less than productive, less than useful. I have tried, as have others, to reason with you on several occasions. A discussion of ours still adorns your talk page (<a href="../../../b/e/n/User_talk%7EBenapgar_78f6.html#ID_Straw_Poll" title="User talk:Benapgar">User talk:Benapgar#ID Straw Poll</a>). In that discussion, you talked about the actions of your fellow editors more than talked about actual improvements. You tried to 'point out the hypocrisy'.You also called me naive, repeatedly, without apologising. Note that you suggested nothing useful, no valid change to the article that other editors had missed or purposely ignored.</dd>
<dd>It is hard to take your petition as anything but a veiled attack, and your contributions as ill-founded. -- <a href="../../../e/c/5/User_talk%7EEc5618_ab71.html" title="User talk:Ec5618">Ec5618</a> 11:17, 22 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Because of your experiences with specific people (which you percieved as bullying), you are now attacking the general concept of bullying.

<dd>It's "not surprising" to me, and I believe to any reasonable person, that you couldn't substantiate your allegation because it was obvious that it was frivolous. It is also "not surprising" that it was malicious (misleading and defamatory) as opposed to an error considering you were accusing me of harming others without substantial evidence, and considering your evasiveness and your sarcastic and caustic attitude.--<a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenapgar_6305.html" title="User:Benapgar">Ben</a> 22:15, 23 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

If anyone really wants to know about my history, they can go through it themselves. I stand by everything I say--unlike people who, for example, resort to bashing my demands for proof of their frivolous allegations because they think my demands for proof amuse them too much for them to take it seriously.--<a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenapgar_6305.html" title="User:Benapgar">Ben</a> 21:44, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ben, Wiki is not a Court of Law, you are not Chief Justice, District Attorney, One-Man Jury or anything else. Furthermore, giving someone a specified time in which to respond is a form of bullying (this does not however apply to EC's tongue-in-cheek "5 minutes, 24 seconds"), and is quite out of place here. Additionally, giving EC 24 hours virtually guaranteed that he would not respond, except for TIC comments. <i>That</i>, would be the truth; it this little charade of yours that mocks the truth. <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJim62sch_0484.html" title="User:Jim62sch">Jim62sch</a> 11:16, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

You know what, Ec5618 can still establish harm if he wants. You can even do it for him. Hell, anyone here can do it. Go on, if you think you know what Ec5618 means when he says my petition is a "veiled attack" you can prove it for him. All I ask for is substantive evidence.</dd>

<p>My personal experience with Ben is that he is hardly befitting the character of a "bully victim." I quite understand he'd like to see himself as such, but really - to me - he's *a* bully. Ben should have reflected very deeply before making this petition, because a bully accusing others of bullying is nothing more than a hypocrite, and is I think *the* worst kind of bully.</p>
<p>I am now going to just ignore anything relating to this user. I really feel that reading what Ben has to say about "bullying" is a ridiculous waste of my time.<a href="../../../l/o/v/User%7ELovecoconuts_3f80.html" title="User:Lovecoconuts">Lovecoconuts</a> 05:57, 28 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>A lot of bullies have added to this page, and tried to ban Benapgar for 3RR for reverting his own user sub page! LOL. I just think that this has become a good way to tell who are the bullies on Wikipedia - the ones who have protested against an anti-bullying petition, and who have gone to the lengths to try to belittle the person making the petition and all who support them - PRIME EXAMPLES OF BULLYING BEHAVIOUR. So if you are writing your name on here, trying to ridicule this petition, then there is a very good chance that many will consider you to be a bully yourself. Of course, the fact that most of the people protesting this petition ARE bullies adds to that. Say hello to Mr. Wikistalker himself, <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">User:Antaeus Feldspar</a>, who I note has contributed here. I am sure that everyone else here can feel proud in associating with him, and others like him.</p>

<dd>Um, I don't think anyone is claiming that by not signing the petition they are a bully. However, defacing a petition might be considered bully behavior. After all, individuals who don't agree, don't need to sign. This is not a vote, and this is in user space. Would you like it if you started a petition and others came by and started a revert war? That happened here (see history). --<a href="../../../b/o/s/User%7EBostonMA_1634.html" title="User:BostonMA">BostonMA</a> 03:55, 10 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You're mistaken. Benapgar invited comments here from the community by listing this petition at <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_dbd4.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment">Wikipedia:Requests for comment</a>: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/User_conduct&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=35592980" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/User_conduct&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=35592980" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> RFC is an invitation for all opinions, not just those you agree with.

<dd>This isn't an RFC. As others have (mistakenly) done on the RFC page, the author of this petition made an announcement on the RFC page. This announcement was quickly removed after it was pointed out that the RFC page is not a general bulletin board. That announcement <i>might</i> have been taken as an invitation for comments from opponents. However, it was clear from the text of the petition, as well as the numerous edit comments, that the author had intended this to be a petition, and had not meant to invite general comments. Some hostile editors, however, would rather see an accidental posting of an announcement on a non-bulletin board as a general invitation to engage in extensive edit warring inside user space, rather than honor the explicit wishes of the editor in whose user space the petition exists. --<a href="../../../b/o/s/User%7EBostonMA_1634.html" title="User:BostonMA">BostonMA</a> 12:38, 10 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Right... It's clear Benapgar was soliciting community participation for this petition by posting it at RFC, having been made familiar with the process already (<a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_Benapgar_8172.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Benapgar">Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/Benapgar</a>), and having announced his petition at the Village pump as well. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Village_pump_%28news%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=35487499" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Village_pump_%28news%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=35487499" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>,</dd>

<p>Benapgar was soliciting a <i>form</i> of community participation, that is, the signing of a petition. He was not soliciting comments in general. Benapgar's wishes were quite clear to anyone who chose to read his comments. However, rather than respect his wishes, certain editors decided to use the argument that since he advertised his petition on the RFC page, that he had forfeitted the right to edit his own user space as he wished. --<a href="../../../b/o/s/User%7EBostonMA_1634.html" title="User:BostonMA">BostonMA</a> 18:11, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The AGF guideline does not ask us to assume good faith when evidence seems to be contrary:

<dd>Nevertheless, if you are asking me to accept, after the fact, that you were acting in good faith, I would be happy to do so, if you are willing to help me to understand your motivations.

<dd>Somehow, I get the feeling that you totally miss the point. If you invite everyone in the neighborhood to come over to your house to discuss the validity of subject X, and then get pissy when people disagree with your interpretation of subject X, that's your own fault. Ben could easilly have left his screed, unannounced, in his user space and no one would have commented. But, no, he chose to act as if it were a thesis posted on an outhouse door. <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJim62sch_0484.html" title="User:Jim62sch">Jim62sch</a> 02:13, 11 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

However, the fact is, Benapgar invited people who supported his petition to sign it. That is hardly the same thing as inviting everyone to discuss subject X on his petition page.

When I see canvassers on the street petitioning for something I don't like, I don't scrawl my objections all over their petition. However, I wouldn't judge anyone too harshly for not noticing that aspect of the advert. But while individual editors might have missed the point with the advert, when they browsed to the page itself, they surely would have noticed at the top:</dd>

<p>(On a side issue, Benapgar did indeed repost his advert on the RFC page under the mistaken impression that such a page was an appropriate place. Radiant! had also used the RFC page as a bulletin board, and Benapgar was following what appeared to be acceptable practice. Considerate editors might have simply recognized that a mistake had been made, and moved on. However, certain editors found this mistake to be an opportunity to conduct an edit war against Benapgar in his own user space.)</p>
