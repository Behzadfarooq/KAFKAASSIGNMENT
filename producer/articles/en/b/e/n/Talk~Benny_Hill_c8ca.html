<p>I have yet to see credit given to Benny Hill for the bit part he played in the 60's movie The Russians are Coming. Part wasn't very big, but it was well played.--Mike White</p>
<ul>
<li>I don't think he was in that one, but I do think you're probably confusing that film with <i>Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines</i>, in which he actually did appear. -<a href="../../../w/b/w/User%7EWbwn_87bc.html" title="User:Wbwn">Wbwn</a> 22:46, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Is the doggrel quoted here <i>actually</i> a Benny Hill composition? If not, I think an actual lyric should be used like one of the jokes from "Gather in the Mushrooms" perhaps. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 21:21, 2 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>It may be just rumor, but I've heard that Benny Hill donated his sperm to a clinic in Christchurch and is the father of dozens of children, including Jude Law, Minnie Driver, Chris Martin, and Noel but not Liam Gallagher. Has anyone else heard this? I'm just dying to know if it might be true.</p>
<pre>
 Geez, if it is, I hope Jude and Minnie don't get together...
</pre>
<ul>
<li>I've heard that Benny Hill died a virgin. This would be quite interesting considering the use of scantily clad women on the show. I haven't found anything that can confirm or deny this.</li>

<p>The claim that the reason for the show's cancellation was pure political correctness is pretty egregiously not NPOV.

<p>A number of English people with whom I've spoken over the years have spoken derisively of Benny Hill; they seemed almost appalled that foreigners might associate their country with him. That's unfortunate. Benny Hill was a wonderfully talented, creative comedian. His doggerel and faux-poetry ("Ted," for example) are absolutely hilarious. He was a master craftsman of the English language, too, exploiting its possibilities to the fullest. And to top it all off, Hill's humor was never malicious or cruel. The politically correct among us who would condemn him simply don't understand the gentle, innocently lecherous nature of his characters. How could any Anglophone not smile at lines like "Three 'hole weeks of fun and sun, sir. Three hundred and fifty pounds." "I'd hardly call that a popular price." "I like it, sir." Or: "Some girls are like Cairo, mysterious and hot/Other girls are like Paree with all the charm she's got/But my girl she is like Tibet with all its ice and snow there/'Cause everyone knows where it is, but no one wants to go there." Benny Hill, you are one of England's greats, and many of us across the pond miss you still. <a href="../../../b/a/m/User%7EBamjd3d_e60e.html" title="User:Bamjd3d">Bamjd3d</a></p>

<li>The English people you talked to much be off their heads. I'm English and love Benny Hill, as do many others.

<p>"The biggest star on television in the UK for 34 years"??? What a pile of crap! What planet are you on?</p>
<dl>
<dd>This is a funny story. My nephew was visiting London and asked several locals if there was a Benny Hill museum. He was constantly told "why would anyone want to visit such a place". It seems that people in the UK did not seem to appreciate Benny's humor. <a href="../../../p/i/e/User%7EPiercetp_90cf.html" title="User:Piercetp">Piercetp</a> 02:45, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>As an American, what I've noticed is that in Britain, many of the Benny-haters are more preferential towards the likes of <i>Monty Python</i>, which I've noticed has a more mean-spirited and strident tone to it in spots (or, to put it another way, "malicious and cruel"), not to mention some sketches pushing a certain kind of socio-political agenda. These hypocrites think that sketches like what Mr. Hill did such as looking at a beautiful woman is verboten, but blood gushing freely on a countryside as <i>Python</i> did (the "Salad Days" sketch) or an undertaker proposing to eat a potential customer's dead mother (also from <i>Python</i>) are perfectly okay. And of course the constant "Benny Hill bad" brainwashing and drumbeat over the last two decades in the U.K. - no wonder there are those across the pond who have such a low opinion of this comic genius. –<a href="../../../w/b/w/User%7EWbwn_87bc.html" title="User:Wbwn">Wbwn</a> 18:33, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Every Hill bio I know of, has given 1924 as his year of birth, including the book his former producer/director Dennis Kirkland wrote, <i>Benny: The True Story</i> (later re-released as <i>The Strange and Saucy World of Benny Hill</i>). Apparently Hill, early in his career, took a year off his age for whatever reason. However, according to another source, anyone who would have been in a position to know exactly which year he was born is, like Benny himself, dead. –<a href="../../../w/b/w/User%7EWbwn_87bc.html" title="User:Wbwn">Wbwn</a> 02:55, 13 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That would suggest we leave it as 1924 with a footnote discussing the disagreement. It's not right to not mention it in the article. --<a href="../../../d/t/c/User%7EDtcdthingy_8e94.html" title="User:Dtcdthingy">Dtcdthingy</a> 23:18, 13 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>The UK's GRO (Births, Marriages and Deaths) have his DoB as 1924 on his death index entry. <a href="../../../i/c/a/User%7EIcairns_bb52.html" title="User:Icairns">Ian Cairns</a> 07:02, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I've now found his Birth index entry as: Alfred H. Hill MAR 1924 2c 52 SOUTHHAMPTON mmn = Cave so, I think 1924 is definite. I'll remove the dubiousness <a href="../../../i/c/a/User%7EIcairns_bb52.html" title="User:Icairns">Ian Cairns</a> 07:15, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I recall back in the 1980s, before Crocodile Dundee Paul Hogan had a quite good comedy sketch program. His humor was quite similar to Benny Hill's and I recall reading at the time that he was a great fan of Benny Hill. I can't find any sources for this at the moment, sadly. I'll keep looking. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 11:51, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>As I recall Benny, in his guise as a squint-eyed Japanese caricature would actually use the term "sirry iriot" (silly idiot). If ok I will edit the page to this effect. MichaelGG</p>

<dd>You are correct, the phrase was "sirry iriot". That's the joke, "L" becomes "R". There are web pages that quote "sirry iriot" such as <a href="http://sagaalt.blogspot.com/2005/11/puerile-humour-makes-my-day.html" class="external free" title="http://sagaalt.blogspot.com/2005/11/puerile-humour-makes-my-day.html" rel="nofollow">http://sagaalt.blogspot.com/2005/11/puerile-humour-makes-my-day.html</a> and <a href="http://www.thebladder.com/content/news/displayContent.asp?CID=3440&amp;EID=349" class="external free" title="http://www.thebladder.com/content/news/displayContent.asp?CID=3440&amp;EID=349" rel="nofollow">http://www.thebladder.com/content/news/displayContent.asp?CID=3440&amp;EID=349</a> . The character's name was "Chow Mein" <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/guide/articles/b/bennyhillshowthe_7773365.shtml" class="external free" title="http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/guide/articles/b/bennyhillshowthe_7773365.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/guide/articles/b/bennyhillshowthe_7773365.shtml</a> . I'm adding this to the now separate article <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Benny_Hill_Show_3bac.html" title="The Benny Hill Show">The Benny Hill Show</a>. 75.33.75.106 10:20, 26 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Then a possibly subliminal (or else ignorant) part of the joke is that "Chow Mein" suggests Chinese rather than Japanese. Chinese have no trouble saying L's, that's a Japanese thing. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 18:42, 26 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>You're right. The character was a "Chinaman", not Japanese.</dd>
<dd>The movie <a href="../../../a/_/c/A_Christmas_Story_be2d.html" title="A Christmas Story">A Christmas Story</a> has a scene with waiters in a Chinese restaurant singing in the same manner (fa ra ra ra ra instead of fa la la la la).</dd>

<dd>Agreed. There's already enough information here to have two articles. I'm going to <a href="../../../b/e/_/Wikipedia%7EBe_bold_in_updating_pages_1d2f.html" title="Wikipedia:Be bold in updating pages">be bold</a> and separate the articles. 75.33.80.150 14:42, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
