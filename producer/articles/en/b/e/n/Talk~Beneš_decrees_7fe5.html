<p>Is there any reason, why the 'real hard' decree 115 from 8th of May 1946 is not at all mentioned? - in it all violence, torture and killing especially against Germans was justified and amnestied even if it took place after the end of WW II. 21:33, 15 May 2006 User:217.10.15.40 (Paul)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Sure. Firstly, it does not belong there, as it was not "<i>enacted by the Czechoslovak government of exile during World War II in absence of Czechoslovak parliament</i>". Secondly, it is not in fact a governmental decree at all, but a standard Act adopted by the Provisional Parliament. Thirdly, it does not justify "<i>all violence, torture and killing especially against Germans</i>", but only those activities (which would otherwise be considered criminal), whose "<i>objective was to contribute to the fight for regaining of freedom of Czechs and Slovaks or were aimed at righteous retaliation for deeds of occupants or their collaborators</i>" - i.e. any inappropriate violence or any other similar excesses were not amnestied and were subject to standard criminal prosecution. Whether or not particular cases were prosecuted in practice is of course another question. Regards (another Paul). 14:13, 3 August 2006 User:80.95.254.1</dd>

<p>Another Paul, I think you will not dispute that the objective "to contribute to the fight for regaining of freedom of Czechs and Slovaks or were aimed at righteous retaliation for deeds of occupants or their collaborators" is a wording quite useful for justifying all kinds of acts, probabaly perpetrators subjectively could decide what righteous retalation was, or who a collaborator was, or what constituted the "freedom of Czechs and Slovaks". PS. Please all sign your posts. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> <a href="../../../s/t/r/User_talk%7EStr1977_095d.html" title="User talk:Str1977"><sup>(smile back)</sup></a> 14:42, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Oh, certainly, there's no controversy in this matter. But frankly, it is always quite hard to find better wording when you have to deal with <a href="../../../r/e/s/Resistance_movement.html" title="Resistance movement">resistance movements</a> and other <i>stricto sensu</i> "illegal" activities, isn't it? Was Heydrichs' <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Anthropoid_4e90.html" title="Operation Anthropoid">assasination</a> a <a href="../../../m/u/r/Murder.html" title="Murder">murder</a>, a <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terrorism.html" title="Terrorism">terrorism</a> or just and lawful act (note that those soldiers who carried out the killing were in civilian clothes)? Were such people heroes or criminals? Without such Act, many resistance combatants would be open to criminal prosecutions for their activities against <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazism.html" title="Nazism">Nazis</a>. Nevertheless, I have added the above-mentioned quotation primarily to show that there were certain guidelines for assessing such situations by the police and the courts, based on criteria, which <i>per se</i> could hardly be called unjust - i.e. it simply is not true that "<i>all violence, torture and killing especially against Germans was justified and amnestied</i>". Of course there certainly were rascals and pseudoheroes who, driven by greed or sadism, "boldly" attacked anything German after the end of the War. Of course it is a shame if such people were not prosecuted and condemned. But such actions were always crimes and were always punishable as crimes and were not legalised by this Act.

<p>Hungarians were also affected by the Benes decrees The article and the links focus on the treatment of ethnic Germans in the former Czechoslowakia, and that's fair as they were the group most seriously affected by the decrees. However, we should not forget about several hundred thousand civic Hungarians who also suffered due to the Benes decrees and the political debates which developed over that in recent years between Hungary on one side and the Czech Republic and Slovakia on the other side. I guess the facts of the removal of Hungarians and corresponding issues should be part of the article about the Benes decrees and perhaps a separate article would be also justified. I write this as somebody might appear in this discussion who is better prepared than me to put together the facts in the most "neutral" possible way. Probably new stages of the debate will evolve and in that case a story on the background in Wikipedia would be great help to readers to understand what will be happening and why.</p>

<li>The german wikipedia uses utf-8 so thats not really got anything to do with the topic at hand.

<p>Current text of the article includes this sentence...</p>
<p>"Some of the decrees concerned the exproriation of <a href="../../../p/u/r/Pursuit_of_Nazi_collaborators_2a28.html" title="Pursuit of Nazi collaborators">wartime traitors and collaborators accused of treason</a> but also all Germans and Hungarians regardless of their degree of guilt."</p>
<p>What is meant by "exproriation"? Closest English word is "expropriation" but that usually means taking away of property. "Exportation"? Doesn't make sense. "Expulsion"? That makes sense but it's far from the actual text.</p>

<p>I think it's expropriation (going to fix it) - as the article says, the decrees didn't mandate the actual transfer, but "merely" loss of property and citizenship. 89.102.137.191 10:05, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I inserted information about Czech decree 76/1948 and Slovak decree 287/1948 which revoked decree No. 33/1945. JKlamo deleted the text with an edit summary indicating that this article was about the Benes decrees only. I restored the text that he deleted.</p>
<p>Here is my rationale...</p>
<p>I agree that the article should be about the Benes decrees only. However, I am assuming that decree No. 33/1945 was one of the Benes decrees. If it was not, then JKlamo is right and the information about the Czech and Slovak decrees does not belong here.</p>
<p>JKlamo also deleted text that asserted that "with two exceptions, 89 of the Benes decreess are still in force". This seems clearly germane to the topic so I restored that text.</p>
