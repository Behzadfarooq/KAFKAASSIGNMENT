<dd>Okay, no problem. Didn't mean to step on any feet; I was unaware of the convention of not disambiguating law names. Could you point me to the relevant discussion? And if you want me to revert the few I've done so far, please let me know, I'm happy to fix them. --<a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenc_2795.html" title="User:Benc">Benc</a> 05:47, 27 Jul 2004 (UTC)

<dd>Don't know of it being any relevant discussion, but it's certainly a bad precedent. We have who knows how many articles whose titles are the names of laws. Are we going to make every one of those disambiguate to the country of origin? I do know policy is not to disambiguate if it isn't necessary. Yeah, you should probably move them back so as to keep them standard. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickK_c665.html" title="User:RickK">Rick</a><b><a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERickK_fb75.html" title="User talk:RickK">K</a> 06:13, Jul 27, 2004 (UTC)</b>

<dd>Reverted. You're right, it makes more sense to do it that way. Thanks for catching it before I did all the Uniform Acts.&#160;:-) By the way, I kept the disambiguation on the <a href="../../../u/n/i/Uniform_Rights_of_the_Terminally_Ill_Act_%28U.S.%29_1fea.html" title="Uniform Rights of the Terminally Ill Act (U.S.)">Uniform Rights of the Terminally Ill Act (U.S.)</a> because of the <a href="../../../r/i/g/Rights_of_the_Terminally_Ill_Act_%28Australia%29_6f3d.html" title="Rights of the Terminally Ill Act (Australia)">Rights of the Terminally Ill Act (Australia)</a>.

<p>Thanks for the good job on the merge-redirect. I think it's important that "May-December romance" remain as a a redirect; while the new article is more solid, it is also less searchable. I've done a Google search for relevant famous May-December couples, and have not come up with very much outside of Hollywood, yet I know the Upper Class (whatever that may be) are also very much into marriages of convenience or arranged marriages, as are a number of other cultures. Seems no one on the net is talking about it though. <a href="../../../d/w/i/User%7EDwindrim_6e1c.html" title="User:Dwindrim">Denni</a><a href="../../../d/w/i/User_talk%7EDwindrim_bafa.html" title="User talk:Dwindrim"><font color="#228822">☯</font></a> 23:05, 2004 Aug 14 (UTC)</p>

<p>I looked at your sandbox and saw that you were planning on doing a few things to the image, so I went ahead and did them. It should be good now.

<p>Hi, Benc, thanks for your patience with my oldermenyoungerwomenolderwomenyoungermen confusion on VfD. (My defense would be that confusion was kind of appropriate.) I was very interested by the comment you made:</p>
<p><i>In fact, I don't think</i> any <i>of the three pages should've been listed on VfD... the nominator should've merged them and listed it for cleanup.</i></p>
<p>You can do that ...? I've never thought of being bold in just that way, but it would certainly save a lot of time for everybody. You're saying that if I see a clutch of substubs that belong together, I should just change them all to redirects, merge the text in a new article, and send it to Cleanup, (or clean it myself), without first consulting anybody? Wouldn't that outrage a lot of people, who want each information atom to have its own entry? There seem to be a lot of them around. Or am I supposed to start a whole thing on each of the stubs' talk pages first? That would make the procedure even more timewasting than VfD, I think. Not sure I understood your meaning, but I'm intrigued. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> 10:13, 16 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, you certainly can do that — as they say, <a href="../../../b/e/_/Wikipedia%7EBe_bold_in_updating_pages_1d2f.html" title="Wikipedia:Be bold in updating pages">be bold in updating pages</a>! A lot of time is wasted on <i>talking</i> about changing articles, and VfD is often a hot spot for wasting time, unfortunately. A lot of Wikipedians don't realize that a significant number of articles on VfD don't <i>need</i> to be on there, if someone would only step in and fix them! It took me a little while to realize this, myself, and only after asking explicitly. Check out <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia_talk%7EVotes_for_deletion_5926.html#Cleanup_on_VfD_articles:_bad_form.3F" title="Wikipedia talk:Votes for deletion">Wikipedia talk:Votes for deletion#Cleanup on VfD articles: bad form?</a>. Anyway, thank you for your concerns, and good luck rescuing articles from VfD — Wikipedia needs more editors like you who are willing to whip those stubs up into something useful.&#160;:-) <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenc_2795.html" title="User:Benc">•&#160;Benc</a><a href="../../../b/e/n/User_talk%7EBenc_b8ae.html" title="User talk:Benc">&#160;•</a> 10:23, 16 Aug 2004 (UTC)

<dd>P.S. - as far as outraging those who want everything <i>just so</i> — don't worry about that for one minute.

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>I wonder would you consider reversing your decision to delete <a href="../../../e/u/r/European_Union_Olympic_medals_count_for_2004_c694.html" title="European Union Olympic medals count for 2004">this article</a>. I have substantially rewritten it. A united EU team is not going to happen. I've discussed potential EU co-operation towards the olympics, and kept the table. I believe the table is valid, for us Europeans/EUians to see how the area has fared as a whole. Please comment on my talk page if you still feel the article should be deleted.</p>

<dd>The <tt>{{fac-contested}}</tt> tag is for <i>previous</i> candidates; the <tt>{{fac}}</tt> tag is for <i>current</i> ones.

<p>Hi, I'm pretty new here, though I'm trying to contribute. Unfortunately, someone made an article which was then listed on VfD, and I've been trying to frantically update and fine-tune it to get it acceptable. I made major expansions to it, but it seems like it's not gonna work. I'm currently working on expanding the history section, the guy's involvement in the SDS and other movements, etc. Do you think you could give it a look, and see whether you think it deserves a chance to be expanded rather than deleted? The page is redstar2000. Thank you. --<a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7EChe_y_Marijuana_56bf.html" title="User:Che y Marijuana">Che y Marijuana</a> 22:35, Sep 3, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sorry, I'm going to have to continue to abstain from comment. I haven't heard of Redstar2000 until now, but then again I don't generally follow anarchist authors. In other words, I don't have anything intelligent to contribute to the discussion as to whether he's notable or not, which is the whole reason the article is listed on VfD.

<p>Hi, Benc.&#160;:)</p>
<p>Wow, would you believe, the thought honestly never occurred to me, which is odd, because I work with <i>admins</i> all day long. Your pointing it out to me, however, makes the matter perfectly clear: it does look like the kind of user name that an Admin would use. The <i>Adm</i> is actually short for <i>Admiral</i>, and is based on an old private joke of mine.</p>
<p>If the world were a nice and safe place, I would have no objection to using my real name, and in fact, I have no objection to giving my real name out to respected members of the Wikipedia community, but I fear the wrath of POV warriors and the annoyance of Trolls too much to make my name available for general consumption.</p>
<p>I had been considering changing my user name to <i>Scripter</i>. I've just checked, and it doesn't seem to be taken. My only concern is that I've read where a change in user name is viewed by some in the community as being suspicious in and of itself. Presumably, I'm new enough and innocuous enough that it won't be seen as a problem.</p>
<p>Thanks for the heads up.&#160;:) <a href="../../../a/d/m/User%7EAdmN_03f2.html" title="User:AdmN">soon to be Scripter, or maybe something else... let me think about it for an hour or so :)</a> 20:49, 4 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Ben:</p>
<p>Where does a user go to make comments to another user? This is the closest place I could find.</p>
<p>The Jello Belt picture you put up is a kick, but it also needs to be edited. It extends all the way through eastern Idaho to Yellowstone, further into Wyoming (the SW quadrant of the state) and through all of eastern Arizona almost to the border. San Bernardino, CA is Mormon/LDS (founded by Brother Brigham) as is Mesa, AZ.</p>
<p>There isn't that much Mormon/LDS influence in N Central or NW Nevada, nor in Eastern CA across the border from NV.</p>
<p>Thank you, though, for your insight.</p>

I need to restore the legit. edits by Davodd that I have reverted by mistake, but I don't think I should go in and make changes while your 'inuse' tag is still there... -- <a href="../../../p/f/h/User%7EPFHLai_0319.html" title="User:PFHLai">PFHLai</a> 00:39, 2004 Sep 9 (UTC)</p>

<p>If you don't think a good idea, just remove (don't forget in that case to also remove from "policy thinktank" page.</p>

Part of the discussion page of that article also has "exchange of ideas" about categories vs. lists when wanting to group trivia (regarding <i>people</i>, but probably more widely applicable). The present (preliminary!) state of the "categorization of people" article mentions only that wikipedians are "divided" over this topic - so I expect that some more clarity might result from the "trivia" discussion.</p>

<p>Thanks, Benc. Actually I suspect that there's a White Power subtext in Skumle humle, though I'm not sure (I'm Swedish, a real Dane might know better) so I kind of don't want to start up about it publicly on VfD or call for a speedy on that account specifically. It's trouble, if you're not sure. See, courtesy of Google, there's a Danish online forum called SKUM, no telling what the acronym stands for, or maybe an online forum for an organization called SKUM. Anyway, there's White Power type chatting on the forum, and Skumle humle's "book title", the phrase "To keep the dirt out" seems to refer on the forum to keeping immigrants out of Denmark. Lovely, isn't it? Oh, hey, I see the link's coming up red now.

<p>I'm wondering why you are using the to-do list for previous Collaboration of the Week articles (e.g. for <a href="../../../a/s/t/Astrophysics.html" title="Astrophysics">astrophysics</a>). The task you propose "Improve this article to featured-standard" is so vague that it can be put on any article. Wouldn't it be better to be more specific, or to not use the to-do list at all&#160;? What do you expect from the readers of that to-do list&#160;? (I believe that there are already enough ways to promote the CoTW collaboration mechanism, if that's your purpose; I also believe that this presumed misuse of the to-do lists reduces their general attraction by generating bad will) What do you think&#160;? <a href="../../../p/c/a/User%7EPcarbonn_cbe1.html" title="User:Pcarbonn">Pcarbonn</a> 21:54, 22 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Your point is well-taken; this <i>is</i> somewhat of a misuse of the to-do list mechanism. I wasn't necessarily trying to advertise COTW, but it definitely appears that way. More than anything else, the "Improve this article..." was meant to be a temporary placeholder, to be replaced with actionable items. Actionable to-do items have been added to a number of COTW graduates (see <a href="../../../c/o/l/Wikipedia%7ECollaboration_of_the_week_To_do_3f53.html" title="Wikipedia:Collaboration of the week/To do">Wikipedia:Collaboration of the week/To do</a>), but the "Improve this article..." message hasn't been removed in those cases, which it probably should.</dd>
</dl>

<dd>I can start going through and peer reviewing the previous COTW articles needing actionable to-do items, though you (and anybody else interested) are certainly welcome to collaborate on this.

<p>Hi benc, thanks for helping on <a href="../../../e/i/g/Eigenplane.html" title="Eigenplane">eigenplane</a>. If you're interested in something else maths related in wikipedia (and i thought i wrote a long rant on this, but i'm not quite sure where...), IMHO it's rather self-defeating to have GFDL encyclopedia articles writing about mathematics (or science), containing text and formulae, <i>without at the same time strongly favouring</i> external links to GPL or GPL compatible <b>software</b>. Of course, the software doesn't always (yet) exist, but often it does, and IMHO it would be good idea to make people writing or correcting articles feel that they should search for some free software equivalent. In fact, surely just about any article could be associated with some sort of free software which does something which enables the reader/user to do more with that idea, to test it, integrate it with other info, etc etc.</p>
<p>As someone with a job in science, i can say that most practising astronomers use some mix between free software, not-quite-free software and outright-commercial-closed software, and are generally not quite aware of the diffferences between free and non-quite-free software. The feeling is often "the ends justify the means". If wikipedia only gives people the <i>end results</i> of knowledge without giving them the power to test that knowledge themselves, then we will only have a small-r revolution in knowledge distribution, not a real big-R Revolution which will help save the planet.&#160;:)</p>
<p>My feeling is that something could be added to the basic template for writing/editing articles to encourage links to free (as in speech) software. However, i thought that rather than trying to <i>campaign</i> for this (i'm sure that any change to the basic editing form would be very strongly debated&#160;:), it makes more sense simply to do it for the subjects where i think i can contribute - people are more likely to take this seriously if i do some work myself. So for <a href="../../../e/i/g/Eigenplane.html" title="Eigenplane">eigenplane</a>, i've submitted an article to a scientific journal, it's freely available as a preprint (external link on eigenplane) (but not GFDL - i need to get <i>brownie points</i> for my dayjob), and the GPL software is downloadable. If other people like the idea, then maybe it will spread.</p>
<p>As a short term step towards this, if anyone has any ideas for a better free software template, please see:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../c/o/m/Talk%7EComputer_algebra_system_9b3a.html" title="Talk:Computer algebra system">Talk:Computer algebra system</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/m/Computer_algebra_system.html" title="Computer algebra system">Computer algebra system</a> for how it works</li>
<li>Template talk:Free software</li>
</ul>
<p>These comments, are, of course&#160;:), GFDL, so feel free to cut/paste/modify/extend/debug/reuse on a more appropriate page of the wikipedia than your talkpage.&#160;:) <a href="../../../b/o/u/User%7EBoud_7cef.html" title="User:Boud">Boud</a> 13:22, 3 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>I read <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenc_Feature_requests_efff.html" title="User:Benc/Feature requests">User:Benc/Feature requests</a>, and I think you have really good ideas. In fact, I think you should add another request: that hovering on a link would open a little information box, just as happens when you put your mouse on an image. This little information box should show the beggining of the article that is being linked, or a little summary.</p>
<p>This will help those who are reading an article but are not familiar with a all the concepts (in physics, for instance). But this should be optional, since it might annoy some users.</p>

<p>But in the future, let's wait until it's actually deleted, okay? -- [User:Benc]</p>
<ul>
<li>How am I supposed to copy the deleted article's content <b>after</b> it has been deleted? After all, I am not the only person to contribute to BJAODN early - there is even one article there which was in fact never deleted. BJAODN is for fun, not for disputes about technicalities. -- <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike_Rosoft_96ed.html" title="User:Mike Rosoft">Mike Rosoft</a> 10:16, 6 Oct 2004 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yes, but also: BJAODN is for fun, <b>not for hurting anybody's feelings</b>. I was not disputing technicalities — I was just being cautious about this borderline case. How would you feel if a good-faith contribution of yours got sent to BJAODN, perhaps with a snarky comment like <i>this is why you shouldn't edit Wikipedia on acid</i>? I was unsure if the article you're referring to was a "good faith" effort, hence the suggested delay. Whenever we're laughing at other people's contributions — no matter how silly they are — it's important to keep <a href="../../../c/i/v/Wikipedia%7ECivility_f107.html" title="Wikipedia:Civility">civility</a> in mind.
<p>Anyway, about my comment. I didn't mean to say that we should <i>always</i> wait until deletion. Rule of thumb: whenever there are a fair number of "keep" votes on VfD or wherever, that's a good sign that some people's feelings might get hurt, and the article should only be moved to BJAODN upon deletion, if at all. In this case, the keep votes were sockpuppets, which is why I reverted myself. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenc_2795.html" title="User:Benc">•&#160;Benc</a><a href="../../../b/e/n/User_talk%7EBenc_b8ae.html" title="User talk:Benc">&#160;•</a> 21:00, 6 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>
