<p>ACODE is the eponymously named benchmarking scheme under development by the Australasian Council on Open, Distance and E-Learning, whose web site is at <a href="http://www.acode.edu.au/" class="external free" title="http://www.acode.edu.au/" rel="nofollow">http://www.acode.edu.au/</a>.</p>
<p>Development of this started in 2004 as a pilot project. There is a <a href="http://www.acode.edu.au/projects/benchmarking.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.acode.edu.au/projects/benchmarking.htm" rel="nofollow">project page</a> with a useful history and several key documents. The scheme is now available in <a href="http://www.acode.edu.au/projects/acodebenchmarksfinal3may06full.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.acode.edu.au/projects/acodebenchmarksfinal3may06full.pdf" rel="nofollow">draft form</a> while it awaits final external peer review.</p>
<p>It is a criterion-based system where criteria (divided into eight main benchmark areas) are scored on a 1-5 scale with the help of scoring statements. It takes a relatively wide view of e-learning, ensuring linkage with general learning and teaching, with IT and with staff development processes. The use of the word "alignment" in several criterion scoring statements suggests that it has been affected by the MIT90s approach described elsewhere in this article.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/n/Benchmarking_e-learning.html" title="Edit section: BENVIC">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">BENVIC</span></h2>
<p>BENVIC is a methodology for benchmarking e-learning developed under an EU project, also called BENVIC (in full, Benchmarking of Virtual Campuses) in the era 1999-2001. There is a project web site still at <a href="http://www.benvic.odl.org/" class="external free" title="http://www.benvic.odl.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.benvic.odl.org/</a> – but it has not been updated since February 2002. The BENVIC consortium was led by <a href="http://www.uoc.edu/web/eng/index.html" class="external text" title="http://www.uoc.edu/web/eng/index.html" rel="nofollow">UOC</a>, the Open University of Catalonia and had a strong set of partners (including University College London in the UK). However, for various reasons including retirement of key staff the work does not seem to have continued – or least web searches indicate that follow-up work is not evident.</p>
<p>The BENVIC system has eight core <i>meta-indicators</i>. These are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Learner Services</li>
<li>Learning Delivery</li>
<li>Learning Development</li>
<li>Teaching Capability</li>
<li>Evaluation</li>
<li>Accessibility</li>
<li>Technical Capability</li>
<li>Institutional Capability</li>
</ul>
<p>All of them, with the exception of Accessibility, are the kind of top-level groupings that one finds in other methodologies. UK readers should also note that Accessibility does not mean only the narrow sense of <a href="http://jarmin.com/demos/course/senda/index.html" class="external text" title="http://jarmin.com/demos/course/senda/index.html" rel="nofollow">SENDA</a> but also covers many aspects of <a href="http://www.hefce.ac.uk/widen/" class="external text" title="http://www.hefce.ac.uk/widen/" rel="nofollow">Widening Participation</a>.</p>
<p>Each of these eight meta-indicators is associated with a range of assessment measurements (indicators) which enables BENVIC users to carry out an initial benchmarking diagnostic. The assessment measurements are comprised of three types:</p>
<ul>
<li>structural measurements</li>
<li>practice measurements</li>
<li>performance measurements.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are in total 72 structural and practice indicators – which is rather more than in many systems but less than some others. Whether or not this is an issue depends crucially on how difficult it is to score these indicators and whether they are all "compulsory".</p>
<p>Indicators (other than the performance ones which are metrically based, i.e. numeric) are scored on a scale of 0-2. Many other systems use a scale of 1-5, but one could use a natural mapping of 0 to 1, 1 to 3, and 2 to 5.</p>
<p>There is a <a href="http://bacsich.typepad.com/elearning/2006/06/benvic_benchmar.html" class="external text" title="http://bacsich.typepad.com/elearning/2006/06/benvic_benchmar.html" rel="nofollow">more detailed analyis</a> of BENVIC on the web.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/n/Benchmarking_e-learning.html" title="Edit section: CHIRON">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">CHIRON</span></h2>
<p>CHIRON is an EU-funded project (under the Leonardo programme) whose aim is "to develop reference material presenting and analysing research outcomes, experiments and best practice solutions for new forms of e-learning, based on integration of broadband web-, digital TV- and mobile technologies for ubiquitous applications in the sector of non-formal and informal life-long learning". There is a CHIRON web site at <a href="http://semioweb.msh-paris.fr/chiron/" class="external free" title="http://semioweb.msh-paris.fr/chiron/" rel="nofollow">http://semioweb.msh-paris.fr/chiron/</a>. They tend to use the phrase "u-learning" rather than "e-learning", where "u" denotes "ubiquity",</p>
<p>As part of this brief, CHIRON appears to be developing a benchmarking methodology. This is specifically referred to in <a href="http://semioweb.msh-paris.fr/chiron/programme.htm" class="external text" title="http://semioweb.msh-paris.fr/chiron/programme.htm" rel="nofollow">Work Package 7</a>.</p>
<p>There are 11 criteria, divided into a total of 216 indicators. The criteria are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>01 Goals and Objectives of the course (12 indicators)</li>
<li>02 Institutional Support (14 indicators)</li>
<li>03 Course Development (50 indicators)</li>
<li>04 Course Structure (12 indicators)</li>
<li>05 Course Content (25 indicators)</li>
<li>06 Teaching/Learning (19 indicators)</li>
<li>07 Student Support (18 indicators)</li>
<li>08 Faculty Support (4 indicators)</li>
<li>09 Evaluation and Assessment (24 indicators)</li>
<li>10 Accessibility (26 indicators)</li>
<li>11 Language (12 indicators)</li>
</ul>
<p>Most of the indicators are best described as specific and rather detailed e-learning standards and guidelines (for example on house style, usability, etc). The remaining few are drawn from a range of sources, including from the <a href="http://www.ihep.com/Pubs/PDF/Quality.pdf#search=%22%22quality%20on%20the%20line%22%22" class="external text" title="http://www.ihep.com/Pubs/PDF/Quality.pdf#search=%22%22quality%20on%20the%20line%22%22" rel="nofollow">Quality on the Line</a> criteria developed in the late 1990s by the <a href="http://www.ihep.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.ihep.com/" rel="nofollow">Institute for Higher Education Policy</a> in the US.</p>

<p>ELTI is the name of one of the methodologies that was trialled in 2006 in the UK <a href="http://www.heacademy.ac.uk/4779.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.heacademy.ac.uk/4779.htm" rel="nofollow">Higher Education Academy Benchmarking Pilot</a>, by three universities:</p>

<p>The UK view of ELTI is given in the entry for <a href="http://elearning.heacademy.ac.uk/wiki/index.php/ELTI" class="external text" title="http://elearning.heacademy.ac.uk/wiki/index.php/ELTI" rel="nofollow">ELTI</a> in the <a href="http://elearning.heacademy.ac.uk/wiki/" class="external text" title="http://elearning.heacademy.ac.uk/wiki/" rel="nofollow">Higher Education Academy Wiki</a>.</p>
<p><b>Further details</b></p>
<p>The ELTI audit was originally developed as part of a <a href="../../../j/i/s/JISC_3b6c.html" title="JISC">JISC</a> project and was designed to inform the process of embedding learning technologies, assist in developing appropriate institutional structures, culture and expertise and to encourage cross boundary collaboration and groupings.</p>
<p>The ELTI approach focuses on:</p>
<ul>
<li>3 general areas for exploration: Culture, Infrastructure, and Expertise</li>
<li>12 key factors are identified, 4 in each area</li>
<li>Up to 10 indicators are agreed, to reflect institutional context, for each factor</li>
<li>Indicators are expressed as positive statements, which can be assessed according to a 1-5 scale but can also include qualitative statements.</li>
</ul>
<p>During the e-Learning Benchmarking Pilot the three institutions used the tools and produced alterations and their own contextualised indicators. The three institutional blogs are at:</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/n/Benchmarking_e-learning.html" title="Edit section: E-xcellence">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">E-xcellence</span></h2>
<p>E-xcellence (pronounced “E-excellence”) is an EU-funded project run by <a href="http://www.eadtu.nl/" class="external text" title="http://www.eadtu.nl/" rel="nofollow">EADTU</a> (the <a href="../../../e/u/r/European_Association_of_Distance_Teaching_Universities_0f10.html" title="European Association of Distance Teaching Universities">European Association of Distance Teaching Universities</a>) with the assistance of 12 other partners. It has a project web site at <a href="http://www.eadtu.nl/e%2Dxcellence/" class="external free" title="http://www.eadtu.nl/e%2Dxcellence/" rel="nofollow">http://www.eadtu.nl/e%2Dxcellence/</a>.</p>
<p>E-xcellence started in January 2005 and is due to conclude in November 2006, with a major launch at the <a href="http://www.eadtu.nl/conference-2006/" class="external text" title="http://www.eadtu.nl/conference-2006/" rel="nofollow">EADTU conference</a> in Tallinn, Estonia, 23-24 November 2006. Originally E-xcellence was not envisaged as a benchmarking methodology but as a quality monitoring tool, but at arbout a year into the project there was a shift in emphasis and benchmarking is now one of the aims envisaged for E-xcellence. In fact there are three orientations of the methodology:</p>
<ul>
<li>Assessment tool (at both institutional and programme level) (i.e. benchmarking)</li>
<li>Quality improvement tool (internal quality care system)</li>
<li>Accreditation tool for accreditation</li>
</ul>
<p>Expected outcomes include:</p>
<ul>
<li>List of criteria for "good" e-learning (i.e. setting standards of excellence and indicators for validation)</li>
<li>Manual on good practices (a web-based guide)</li>
<li>Quality assurance system (internal validation based on the standard of excellence)</li>
<li>Reports on pilots which will test the validation approach</li>
<li>Establishment and training of a visitation team both for quality assurance and for accreditation (to be seen as distinct procedures)</li>
</ul>
<p>There is little public information so far but it is believed that the basis of the E-xcellence benchmarking methodology is as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Based on criteria, with (at the time of writing) 20 <i>threshold</i> criteria and a further 30 <i>excellence</i> criteria</li>
<li>Each criterion is a bundle of indicators</li>
<li>Criteria are not yet scored, but this may be added by the time of the final release</li>
<li>The threshold" level can be determined by a self-audit, but the "excellence" level requires in addition a visit from an expert team.</li>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/n/Benchmarking_e-learning.html" title="Edit section: IQAT">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">IQAT</span></h2>
<p>IQAT - pronounced "eye-cat" - is a newish benchmarking and quality enhancement methodology developed by <a href="http://www.hezel.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.hezel.com/" rel="nofollow">Hezel Associates</a>, a well-known firm of e-learning consultants, in conjunction with a number of university partners. Unlike most benchmarking methodologies it even has its own <a href="http://www.iqat.org/" class="external text" title="http://www.iqat.org/" rel="nofollow">web site</a>. The methodology was formally launched in June 2006.</p>
<p>It describes itself as "a web-based tool to track and benchmark institutional data systematically across time and among peer institutions".</p>
<p>The work is being done in partnership with <a href="http://www.nutn.org" class="external text" title="http://www.nutn.org" rel="nofollow">NUTN</a>, the National University Telecommunications Network, and with sponsorship from Cisco Systems. NUTN has for some time had a major interest in quality and more recently benchmarking, as demonstrated for example by the topics and speakers at their <a href="http://www.nutn.org/annual_event/2006/presentations/index.html" class="external text" title="http://www.nutn.org/annual_event/2006/presentations/index.html" rel="nofollow">2006 conference</a>. In particular there was a <a href="http://www.nutn.org/annual_event/2006/presentations/quality.ppt" class="external text" title="http://www.nutn.org/annual_event/2006/presentations/quality.ppt" rel="nofollow">launch presentation</a>of IQAT. One of the leading organisations in NUTN is <a href="http://www.msuglobal.com" class="external text" title="http://www.msuglobal.com" rel="nofollow">Michigan State University</a>, who have a leading role in organising an upcoming (October 2006) conference on quality in Beijing, China, entitled the <a href="http://www.msuglobal.com/internationalforum.html" class="external text" title="http://www.msuglobal.com/internationalforum.html" rel="nofollow">First International Forum on Online Education: Quality Assurance</a>, with a range of quality and benchmarking experts as speakers.</p>
<p>However, probably since it is a commercial and proprietary tool, little further public information appears to be available on IQAT. There are some resources and a glossary on the IQAT site but these appear in the main to be <i>about</i> distance learning not about <i>benchmarking</i> it, with the exception of a report entitled <a href="http://www.hezel.com/benchmarking/Initial_Survey_Report.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.hezel.com/benchmarking/Initial_Survey_Report.pdf" rel="nofollow">The Status of Benchmarking at Higher Education Institutions</a> (in the US).</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/n/Benchmarking_e-learning.html" title="Edit section: MASSIVE">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">MASSIVE</span></h2>
<p>MASSIVE is an EU-funded project coordinated by the University of Granada - the web site is at <a href="http://cevug.ugr.es/massive/" class="external free" title="http://cevug.ugr.es/massive/" rel="nofollow">http://cevug.ugr.es/massive/</a>.</p>
<p>The prime aim of the project is to design a model of support services for European universities engaged in e-learning. This is being done in a cooperative way involving a large network of organisations, the members of the MASSIVE consortium, tothether with stakeholders not directly participating in the project, who liaise via a Strategic Advisory Committee. The university members of MASSIVE include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Universidad de <i>Barcelona</i></li>
<li>University of <i>Bergen</i></li>
<li><i>Budapest</i> University of Technology and Economics</li>
<li>University of <i>Edinburgh</i></li>
<li>EuroPACE and its member universities</li>
</ul>
<p>Student involvement is handled via ESIB, the <a href="http://www.esib.org/contact.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.esib.org/contact.htm" rel="nofollow">National Unions of Students in Europe</a>.</p>
<p>A key outcome of MASSIVE is to a promote a peer review evaluation approach, based on models widely tested in the university partners. Via Peer Review Visits, those in charge of the best support services practices will help each university to refne and improve their support services for e-learning. At this point the project becomes very similar to a benchmarking project.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/n/Benchmarking_e-learning.html" title="Edit section: MIT90s">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">MIT90s</span></h2>
<p>The MIT90s framework has been used by the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Strathclyde_d765.html" title="University of Strathclyde">University of Strathclyde</a> (one of the 12 institutions in the <a href="http://www.heacademy.ac.uk/4779.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.heacademy.ac.uk/4779.htm" rel="nofollow">Higher Education Academy Benchmarking Pilot</a>) to assist in the structuring of its approach to benchmarking e-learning. For details of its use in Phase 1 see the <a href="http://elearning.heacademy.ac.uk/wiki/index.php/Main_Page" class="external text" title="http://elearning.heacademy.ac.uk/wiki/index.php/Main_Page" rel="nofollow">Higher Education Academy Benchmarking Wiki</a> entry for <a href="http://elearning.heacademy.ac.uk/wiki/index.php/MIT90s" class="external text" title="http://elearning.heacademy.ac.uk/wiki/index.php/MIT90s" rel="nofollow">MIT90s</a>.</p>
<p>The framework was developed by Michael S Scott Morton as part of the work of the "MIT90s" initiative which flourished at MIT in the early 1990s. Michael S Scott Morton is now Professor Emeritus at MIT in the Sloan School of Management. The work is cited under various names: it is correctly entitled <i>The Corporation of the 1990s: Information Technology and Organizational Transformation</i>, edited by Michael S Scott Morton with an introduction by Lester Thurow (Oxford University Press, USA), published February 1991, <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0-19-506358-9</a>.</p>
<p>There has been some confusion over the correct name of the initiative and the framework. Readers will find "MIT 90s", "MIT90" and even "MITs 90" in various references.</p>
<p>The MIT90s framework has been central to a number of JISC and related studies (including from DfES) on adoption and maturity. In UK post-16 e-learning terms, probably the most successful use of this is in the <a href="http://www.jisc.ac.uk/index.cfm?name=project_raiie" class="external text" title="http://www.jisc.ac.uk/index.cfm?name=project_raiie" rel="nofollow">RAIIE</a> study led by David Nicol of the University of Strathclyde, funded by JISC during the period April 2003 to May 2004, which produced a final report <i>A Framework for Managing the Risks of e-Learning Investment</i>. There is also a substantial strand of work in Australia associated with the names of Philip Yetton, Anne Forster, Sandra Wills and others, some of it funded by DETYA. This also used the concept of <i>strategic aligment</i> described below.</p>
<p>The MIT90s initiative developed several companion pieces of work o which two are from Venkatraman: <i>transformation levels</i> and <i>strategic alignment</i>. Professor N Venkat Venkatraman is now Professor of Management at Boston University School of Management (and also a visiting professor at London Business School) but was at the Sloan School of Management at MIT during the period of relevance. His work on <i>IT-Induced business reconfiguration</i> is Chapter 5 (pages 122-158) of the main book referred to above.</p>
<p>The Venkatraman thesis is that business use of IT passes through five levels, differing in both the degree of business transformation and in the range (and amount) of potential benefits. The levels are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Localised exploitation</li>
<li>Internal integration</li>
<li>Business process redesign</li>
<li>Business network redesign</li>
<li>Business scope redefinition.</li>
</ul>
<p>Levels 1 and 2 are called <i>evolutionary levels</i> – levels 3, 4, and 5 are called <i>revolutionary levels</i>.</p>
<p>This has been applied to educational systems, especially in the schools sector, by Becta and DfES.</p>
<p>In passing, it is interesting that this is one of the first situations where a 5-point scale has been used in a situation akin to benchmarking.</p>
<p>The MIT90s framework could have relevance to <a href="http://elearning.heacademy.ac.uk/weblogs/benchmarking/?p=103" class="external text" title="http://elearning.heacademy.ac.uk/weblogs/benchmarking/?p=103" rel="nofollow">e-benchmarking frameworks</a>.

<ol>
<li>Wills, Sandra, "Strategic Planning for Blended eLearning", paper presented to the IEE conference <i>ITHET06</i>, Sydney, July 2006, available at <a href="http://ro.uow.edu.au/asdpapers/36/" class="external free" title="http://ro.uow.edu.au/asdpapers/36/" rel="nofollow">http://ro.uow.edu.au/asdpapers/36/</a>.

If you have time just to read just one longer report, read this one.</li>
<li>Uys, Philip, Towards the Virtual Class: key management issues in tertiary education, PhD dissertation, Victoria University of Wellington, 2000, available at <a href="http://www.globe-online.com/philip.uys/phdthesis" class="external free" title="http://www.globe-online.com/philip.uys/phdthesis" rel="nofollow">http://www.globe-online.com/philip.uys/phdthesis</a>. See in particular chapters 2 and 10. This dissertation describes the value of the MIT90s framework in structuring and analysing a large implementation action research programme – and the heuristics derived. It is, along with the work of Wills, one of the few examples of serious feedback into the MIT90s framework.</li>
<li>Segrave, Stephen, Holt, Dale and Farmer, James, “The power of the 6three model for enhancing academic teachers’ capacities for effective online teaching and learning: Benefits, initiatives and future directions”, <i>Australasian Journal of Educational Technology</i> (<i>AJET</i>) 21(1), 2005, available at <a href="http://www.ascilite.org.au/ajet/ajet21/segrave.html" class="external free" title="http://www.ascilite.org.au/ajet/ajet21/segrave.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ascilite.org.au/ajet/ajet21/segrave.html</a>. This is a good read useful as a modern confirmation of the relevance of the MIT90s framework.</li>

<p>OBHE is an eponymous benchmarking methodology run by OBHE, the <a href="http://www.obhe.ac.uk/" class="external text" title="http://www.obhe.ac.uk/" rel="nofollow">Observatory on Borderless Higher Education</a>. The Observatory is a joint initiative of ACU, the <a href="../../../a/s/s/Association_of_Commonwealth_Universities_6984.html" title="Association of Commonwealth Universities">Association of Commonwealth Universities</a> and <a href="../../../u/n/i/Universities_UK_6a4f.html" title="Universities UK">Universities UK</a>, the association of all UK universities. The Observatory is now 100% funded by subscriptions and consultancy, and has over 130 institutional subscribers from more than twenty countries. It offers a wide range of services of which benchmarking is one. Within the benchmarking offering is a range of sub-offerings, of which one is deployed for the Higher Education Academy clients.</p>
<p>The OBHE methodology is a collaborative benchmarking methodology where a group of institutions get together and jointly agree relevant areasa of interest (in this case, within the e-learning space) and in a later phase, look for good practices. A succinct description of the variant of their methodology used for the Higher Education Academy Benchmarking Pilot is <a href="http://www.heacademy.ac.uk/weblogs/benchmarking/wp-content/uploads/2006/03/ACU_OBHE_background_note.doc" class="external text" title="http://www.heacademy.ac.uk/weblogs/benchmarking/wp-content/uploads/2006/03/ACU_OBHE_background_note.doc" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>
<p>The methodology goes back to benchmarking work done for European and Commonwealth universities in the 1990s. A related study to the Higher Education Academy Pilot is the work done for OECD to produce the report <i>E-learning in Tertiary Education: Where Do We Stand?</i> As reported in the <a href="http://www.education.gov.ab.ca/oecd2005/FinalReportEnglish.doc" class="external text" title="http://www.education.gov.ab.ca/oecd2005/FinalReportEnglish.doc" rel="nofollow">Proceedings of the OECD Conference on Post-Secondary E-learning</a>, "This was based on a detailed, qualitative survey of current e-learning practice in 19 institutions of higher education in North America, South America, Europe and the Asia-Pacific region. The information gathered through this survey was complemented by quantitative data collected by OBHE from the 500 members of the Association of Commonwealth Universities and of Universities UK."</p>
