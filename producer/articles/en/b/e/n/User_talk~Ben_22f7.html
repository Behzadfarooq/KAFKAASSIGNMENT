<p>Not meaning to "stalk" but rather to learn by example from your contribs, I saw your recent exchange on an article talk page where there'd been repeated requests to censor text, pictures, or the entire article. Thinking, perhaps naively, that one clear statement up front might help reduce the repetition, I came up with the following box, and added it at the top of that talk page. If you'd find it helpful, please use or adapt wherever you deem suitable. -- <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenedict_the_Moor_1d60.html" title="User:Benedict the Moor">Ben</a> 17:43, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Overall, this seems more like an attempt to intimidate people from objecting to <i>Porno</i>pedia. Pointing out that Wikipedia is not censored is good, but more emphasis needs to be placed on keeping the discussion of images to their content and relevancy, and not about <i>"OMG HES NEKID!!!"</i> As it reads, it seems more to the effect that people are not allowed to talk about images that contain nudity, without regard to their relevance, and that such discussions will be ignored and deleted. When I saw the one on <a href="../../../e/j/a/Talk%7EEjaculation_43be.html" title="Talk:Ejaculation">Talk:Ejaculation</a>, my first response was "to hell with you." (And that's the nice version.) Then I reread it about 3 times and realized that <i>nudity</i> is the topic that is not of relevance. Try turning the phrasing to:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>"Off-topic discussions, including <i>discussions about the acceptability <b>of nudity in images</b> on Wikipedia</i>, <b>that</b> serve no constructive purpose in improving <b>this</b> article <i>&lt;snip&gt;</i> may be removed."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The bold emphasizes my addendum, and the <i>&lt;snip&gt;</i> is an unnecessary comma-and contingency. This turn of the phrase will actually make it mean what you want. As it is written, it can be interpreted as a <i>form of censorship</i> itself, saying "if this picture is has nudity, you are not allowed to object to it." And there are plenty of valid reasons to object to some of these images, above and beyond the nudity itself. -- <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoseph_S_Atkinson_b94d.html" title="User:Joseph S Atkinson">jsa</a> 06:22, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>

<dl>
<dd>It seems more cohesive and authoritative as a statement, and perhaps stresses the intended meaning even more.

<dd>Original: "Off-topic discussions, including <i>discussions about the acceptability of images of nudity on Wikipedia</i>, serve no constructive purpose in improving the article, and may be removed." -- Subject is "off-topic discussions" (of which "...acceptability of images of nudity..." is only one example), and the statement is that such discussions (a) "serve no constructive purpose in improving the article" (precisely <i>because</i> they're off the topic of how to improve the article), and (b) for that reason they may be removed. As far as I can see, this leaves anyone perfectly free to object to one or more <i>specific</i> images <i>for other reasons</i>, such as not fitting the article's needs, being worse for the purpose than other pictures on the same topic, all the other "valid reasons". These would not be "off topic", as they would address how to improve the article, so the statement is not even referring to them. That seems to me to be the outcome you wanted. Have I got that right or wrong?</dd>

<dd>Your last revision: "Off-topic discussions that serve no constructive purpose in improving this article, including <i>discussions about the acceptability of nudity in images</i>, may be removed." -- Now the subject is "off-topic discussions that serve no constructive purpose in improving this article", and immediately I'm confused, because by definition the topic of the talk page is how to improve the article, so anything <i>off</i> that topic does <i>not</i> address that purpose, and the point of adding the modifying phrase escapes me. It seems to suggest that <i>some</i> off-topic discussions may actually be <i>on</i>-topic, and that only the off-topic discussions which actually <i>are</i> off-topic may be removed. Either there's a redundancy here, or a suggestion that "off-topic" does not in fact mean "not addressing how to improve the article" -- but in that case what <b>is</b> the topic of the article talk page? The rest of the statement, making "...acceptability of images of nudity..." an example of the subject as subject to removal, doesn't seem to have changed at all; this version even leaves intact the declaration that "discussions about the acceptability of nudity in images" serve no constructive purpose in improving this article. By removing "on Wikipedia" we only lose the present focus on what Wikipedia is and is not, e.g. "<a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#CENSOR" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not censored</a>". (Whether images would be suitable <i>elsewhere</i>, off-wiki, would surely be even further off-topic.) So it seems to me this <i>doesn't</i> achieve the outcome you wanted. Again, have I got that right or wrong?</dd>

<dd>I think you are right, the inclusion of "that" creates two possible readings. Namely the one of conflict is that it implies there will be off-topic discussions that are somehow relevant. If you omit the word "Off-topic", there would be an implicit statement that any discussion no about bettering the article will not be tolerated. Thus <b>"Discussions that serve no constructive purpose in improving this article, including <i>discussions about the acceptability of nudity in images</i>, may be removed."</b> This (should) essentially declare any subject without "constructive purpose" off-topic for you. Leaving "Off-topic" in, but removing "that" makes the statement more declarative, admonishing the reader for being off-topic. "Off-topic discussions serve no constructive purpose ...". So it really depends on if you are trying to nicely point out that subjects not on topic are inappropriate, or aggressively declare that off-topic discussion is pointless.</dd>

<dd>The semantic of "of nudity" vs "nudity in" (I believe "nudity within images" may be grammatically more appropriate actually) is harder to explain, but it's the difference between an image that contains nudity for the sake of nudity, and one that for whatever reason happens to contain nudity. A girl <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indecent_exposure.html" title="Indecent exposure">flashing</a> the camera would be "of nudity", since nudity is the focus of the picture. An image of a mans ulcerated penis in the context of an article about STDs would be something that would have nudity in it, but not be the focus/intent of the image. As for "on Wikipedia", it's my opinion that with the preceding statements already citing Wikipedia and it's standards, you have laid down the basis of your authority in removing off-topic discussions. Additionally, by omitting that part, you also imply that "on McDonald's website" is just a off-topic as "on Wikipedia". Perhaps "its" added would help that part, by inheriting "the article" as the subject, which in turn inherits it's meaning from the first sentence of the statement in the paragraph. All of which are understood to be on Wikipedia</dd>

<dd>The emphasis here, I think, is that "the nudity of the article's images" is not a relevant topic of discussion. That if a person has a problem with that, whatever Talk: page it is on is not the place to discuss the subject. It takes the emphasis off Wikipedia and makes the statement about the article directly. i.e. "there may a place that is relevant to discuss nudity on Wikipedia, but it isn't here." Rereading the above, I think adding in "off-topic" in a declarative my be important actually.</dd>

<dd>Is that one better for you? Like I said, in the two statements before that line, we have established the basis of our authority in declaring nudity off topic by Wikipedia standards. The final statement is now about the article itself and how using the fore mentioned authority to protect it from off-topicness will be applied. Actually, you might even go as far replacing "may" with "will" in that line.</dd>

<dd>I think the hard part here is that the phrase has to carry the weight of "nudity in general" but not limit "nudity here specifically." The only real case for discussion of nudity is "is this necessary to illustrate the subject?" And as so much of the answer to that question is conditional by both the subject and the image, and is a very relevant question to be discussed. An example here would be of, say, a <a href="../../../n/i/n/Ninja_Turtles_6547.html" title="Ninja Turtles">Ninja Turtle</a> with a penis. It would be topical for the Ninja Turtle article as it does illustrate the concept, but it's not the best image as they are typically not pictured with penises. If there article were to be on the fictional Middle-Aged Well-Hung Anti-Hero Tortoises, it might very well be impossible to represent them without the penis. Context means everything when dealing with acceptable nudity.</dd>

<p>I have now turned my one-line box into <a href="../../../n/o/t/Template%7ENotcensored_5c46.html" title="Template:Notcensored">Template:Notcensored</a>. Your longer box I've adapted into <a href="../../../n/o/t/Template%7ENotcensored2_396c.html" title="Template:Notcensored2">Template:Notcensored2</a>, with two minor changes from the original text: 1) removed the blank line from top, 2) used BASEPAGENAME to provide the article name automagically, so that doesn't have to be typed in every time.</p>
<p>It's probably better to "subst" these -- <b>{{subst:notcensored}}</b> or <b>{{subst:notcensored2}}</b> -- rather than make the poor computers transclude them each load.

<p>Having read your explanation, I retract my claim that you are a Cplot sockpuppet. I would also like to apologize to you for what must have appeared like a grossly incivil removal of all your comments from my talk page. If you want an explanation of why I removed your comments without reading them, well, see my talk page history.

<p>Hi Ben and thank you for following up with me on my talk page. I was, indeed, aware Nuremburg had history before it was made famous in the 1940's. However, based on my review of the user in question's user page, I had trepidations about going any further. I read the template and it honestly said what I wanted to say without going into too much detail. OTOH, I did miss the part about the signature and subst. I appreciate you bringing the information to my attention! --<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilverhand_a04b.html" title="User:Silverhand"><span style="color:silver"><b>Silverhand</b></span></a><sup><a href="../../../s/i/l/User_talk%7ESilverhand_ca5f.html" title="User talk:Silverhand">Talk</a></sup> 19:01, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

Being courteous, considerate, and compassionate, even to people who walked in the door in a nasty mood, can sometimes break that bad mood and let them reconsider their attitude.

<dd>Well, I don't share the view (experience has taught me differently), but <i>thanking</i> someone for their obscene vandalism is surely still a bit odd. If you must welcome out-and-out vandals, could you at least use an alternative template that doesn't thank them for their contributions? The <a href="../../../w/e/l/Wikipedia%7EWelcoming_committee_dc32.html" title="Wikipedia:Welcoming committee">Wikipedia:Welcoming committee</a> page says: "It's best to check a new user's contributions before welcoming them. Compliment them and thank them for the work they've done! You'll sometimes find that they're not new at all, but simply have a blank Talk page (in which case you might still welcome them, but with a note apologizing for the lateness), or that they are new, but have done nothing but vandalise articles (in which case, depending upon the seriousness of their vandalism, you might add a welcome and a warning, or just add a warning)." --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font></a>) 12:57, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It is certainly good to have your viewpoint at the various CC discussions, Ben, as you are adding a viewpoint that is brining up issues others may not have thought of. Please, however, don't take the proposed deletions of the templates and categories personally. No one is trying to make things more difficult. Rather, it is the hope that simplifying the disambiguation templates will make everyone's editing and usages of disambiguation pages simpler.

<dd>Perhaps I misunderstood. You'll have noticed the discussion on his old talk page and at <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFC_NAME_d5f0.html" title="WP:RFC/NAME">WP:RFC/NAME</a>; he didn't want to break policy, he just really liked the Greek letter Xi. I'd suggested he could change the username to English but keep "ΞΞΞ" as his "nick" or "signature" to retain his identity -- which is just what he's done. The old talk page had the whole username controversy, and now that's gone. But both his old and current signature still have "ΞΞΞ", so he's not by any means trying to erase the link. The old posts still point to User:ΞΞΞ, so redirecting to <a href="../../../d/a/s/User%7EDashes_7d73.html" title="User:Dashes">User:Dashes</a> just lets correspondents reach the right ID. Otherwise, they might go to the old talk page, find it empty, and create it by posting comments there instead of at his new page. This seemed better. But if Dashes wants even the redirects gone, by all means his wishes should have priority, and I'll owe both of you an apology for my misguided meddling -- <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenedict_the_Moor_1d60.html" title="User:Benedict the Moor">Ben</a> 06:08, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, Ben. The optional parameter in that template should be pretty helpful. By the way, I'm not actually an admin myself.

<dd>Not at all, thank you for the (fittingly) gracious thought! However, because these templates are NOT identical, the -concerns recommend a "nature of concern" or "nature of objection", the -results recommend an "outcome of RFC", and the article-s <b>require</b> an article name, the instructions differ accordingly, including the "sample text" suggested for each. Otherwise I would have used templates from the start. A template for the table at the bottom would be nice, but please leave the rest customized to the templates.

<dd>I think having the table as a template would be nice. As for the other -- having to type the same text into parameters that otherwise would be plainly formatted on the page really wouldn't be a great savings in time, and would make it that much harder for any later editor to update the page, due to having to learn that template first, and due to the limit on text imposed by the number of parameters. It was a lovely idea, though, and I do heartily thank you for the work you put into it! -- <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenedict_the_Moor_1d60.html" title="User:Benedict the Moor">Ben</a> 04:32, 22 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>All right. I'll be on the road to implementing your suggestion. (By the way, the number of parameters isn't that big of a deal, since you could have up to... well... a huge number, all of them conditional.) But great job with your work with these templates!

<p>Just one more thing (I promise!). Do you want the new table to stretch all the way across the instructions box, or just have it aligned to the right, as it is now? If the former, it needs to be on a different row with a colspan of 2. Sorry... I just love the template namespace, probably what caused this problem&#160;:)<a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGracenotes_686d.html" title="User:Gracenotes"><font color="#960">Grace</font><font color="#000">notes</font></a><sup><a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGracenotes_98ea.html" title="User talk:Gracenotes"><font color="#960">T</font></a></sup> § 04:51, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'd been thinking of adding one more column with "Parameters, (req)uired or (opt)ional", but I don't know what'll happen when the table gets wider than the instruction box. I don't really care about the alignment so much, it could be left or center, just so the info's there to tell the user of one template where the others are.

<p>Hi Ben, I was wondering if the RFCN templates really needed to have sigs included in them? I've seen a few examples of double signing like this one: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Admin2admin&amp;oldid=110049225" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Admin2admin&amp;oldid=110049225" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>. I think users generally don't expect the template to automatically include the sig, so the instinct is to sign anyway. Given that the templates as <a href="../../../u/w/t/WP%7EUWT_9d62.html" title="WP:UWT">WP:UWT</a> generally don't include pre-formed sigs, I suggest the RFCN ones should work in the same way... What do you think? <span style="font-family: Verdana"><a href="../../../w/j/b/User%7EWJBscribe_824e.html" title="User:WJBscribe"><b>WjB</b></a><a href="../../../w/j/b/User_talk%7EWJBscribe_3a3f.html" title="User talk:WJBscribe"><i>scribe</i></a></span> 12:50, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I've seen many warning templates go unsigned. I don't know whether it's people simply don't think of it (since they didn't "write" the template text, and the instructions just say to put the template on the user's talk page) or because they're (perhaps unconsciously) reluctant to sign what may seem a hostile message, or because they feel they're acting on behalf of the system so it really isn't "their" message at all... and there's no point speculating. I think all such templates should default to auto-signed, with the option (sig=n) to consciously omit that -- for instance, if one wants to customize a signature. I'm going to propose all the UWTs have the auto-sign feature added. -- <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenedict_the_Moor_1d60.html" title="User:Benedict the Moor">Ben</a> 13:03, 22 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Well if you thank that's the way to go.

<dd>I was trying to tack onto my ending: ...", once we can work out an auto-subst: (because the auto-sign only works when subst'd, and UWTs generally aren't subst'd)." And got an edit conflict with your reply.</dd>
<dd>Well, when everything works the same way, it becomes easier to learn. I didn't invent the autosign, by the way, that's taken from pre-existing templates. -- <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenedict_the_Moor_1d60.html" title="User:Benedict the Moor">Ben</a> 13:15, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Short answer: Long, long ago I took the motto <a href="../../../r/t/f/RTFM_dd93.html" title="RTFM">RTFM</a> to heart.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Long answer: I'd used Google as a search engine on many occasions, ofen enough in the past few years it had led me to Wikipedia, and I'd become familiar with WP's uneven record of factual reliability, as a volunteer project and open "online community". As a participant in many other (<b>offline</b>) projects and communities over the years, I find the social processes, the backstage work, often more interesting than what happens onstage in full public view. I've helped cobble together bylaws, mediated disputes, written speeches and press releases and handout flyers and newsletters, kept membership and mailing lists, cranked ditto- and mimeographs, and had many conversations with members or leaders of other voluntary communities about how they worked and what the basic shared assumptions were. So very quickly I started paying more attention to the backstage workings of Wikipedia than to the featured articles -- or, as one might say, more attention to how the sausage factory works than to the pretty plastic-packed sausages on the store shelves. I went though the policies, guidelines, essays, all the bits of lore about Jimbo's guiding philosophy -- I'd have loved to put him in the same room with <a href="../../../l/a/n/Lanza_del_Vasto_d0ed.html" title="Lanza del Vasto">Lanza del Vasto</a> of the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Community_of_the_Ark_a857.html" title="Community of the Ark">Community of the Ark</a> (whom I met over 30 years ago) and just listen to them converse -- and then the much messier matter of how the details were worked out in actual disputes. (I must say, people who actually have to live and work together tend to treat each other much more gently, unless the community has already gone very very sour -- one severe disadvantage of the online setting.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It was in reading the Village Pump, not for the first time, that I came across a list of questionably blocked usernames, and recognized one as the Latin name of the historical Roland, apparently regarded as long and nonsensical by the blocking admin. Well, the medieval songs and sagas are an interest of mine. I registered on Wikipedia <b>in order to comment on that case</b>. The blocking admin reversed himself, and I got hooked on that sort of backstage conversation. I wrote to the list's author (another admin) about the unblock, read his contrib history, saw him encounter a recurrent pattern of requests for censorship on article talk pages, looked up how to do templates, wrote a couple of "not-censored" templates to help him reduce his workload, and got hooked on another kind of backstage work. Username issues and templates easily account for more than half my wiki-time since then. I've edited some articles, but I think more for "backstage" contents like category sortnames (how the articles get alphabetized) than for the texts the readers see.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>My work on the RFC-related templates (see {{<a href="../../../r/f/c/Template%7ERFCtemplate_0251.html" title="Template:RFCtemplate">RFCtemplate</a>}}), especially {{<a href="../../../a/r/t/Template%7EArticleConcern_f802.html" title="Template:ArticleConcern">ArticleConcern</a>}} and {{<a href="../../../c/o/n/Template%7EConductConcern_afa2.html" title="Template:ConductConcern">ConductConcern</a>}} and {{<a href="../../../u/s/e/Template%7EUsernameConcern_47f1.html" title="Template:UsernameConcern">UsernameConcern</a>}}, actually owes something to Lanza del Vasto, who'd told me that when anyone came to him with a complaint about another community member, he'd take the one by the hand, lead him to the other, and say to the other, "This person has something to tell you." He'd let them try to work it out together before getting anyone else involved. Then, if necessary, one mediator. Then, if necessary, a group of three. The community as a whole wouldn't get involved until as a last resort -- and its decisions were by consensus, there meaning that the meeting <b>didn't end</b> until everyone either agreed or voluntarily chose to leave the community. (Don't let anyone tell you that pacifists are pushovers or soft.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Wikipedia is nowhere near that strict about consensus, or even the meaning of consensus. I don't suppose it could be; an online community can't be kept in one room until everyone either agrees or leaves.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>But I still think people should try to work out their problems one-to-one first, and then with one or a few mediators, before involving the whole community. And that they should treat each other gently, with courtesy and consideration and compassion, as though they're both going to have to live and work together for a very long time to come. And that using the community decision-making (or rule-making) process as a weapon against fellow community members in the short term will tend in the long term to break down the basis of mutual trust that lets a community survive and prosper.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Which is why seeing all-too-familiar symptoms -- like a rise in rule proposals to forbid this-or-that noninjurious act, or the turning around of benefit-of-doubt from innocence to guilt, or the refusal of those with some degree of power to explain or account for their use of that power against others -- worries me.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I've seen it before in other voluntary communities. Some of them don't exist any more. -- <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenedict_the_Moor_1d60.html" title="User:Benedict the Moor">Ben</a> 03:57, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I am keenly, painfully, aware of what happens when one doesn't "subst:" these templates, which is why the instructions and examples stress that they <i>must</i> be subst'd. I wish there were a way to auto-subst, say by putting some sort of "auto-subst" code at the start of the template itself -- but until then, all I can do is keep giving those instructions and examples.

<p>Wow, Ben, your template skills are impressive! My initial reaction is that I'd want to keep {{<a href="../../../s/s/p/Template%7ESsp_8316.html" title="Template:Ssp">ssp</a>}} and {{<a href="../../../s/o/c/Template%7ESocks_eac9.html" title="Template:Socks">socks</a>}} separate. There's two reasons--first, most of the time, I want to link to the SSP case, but not necessarily to the confirmed/suspected categories. Second, people often don't tag the userpages of the master and socks, so the categories don't get populated, or they're woefully incomplete. Thus, a lot of the time the categories aren't useful. I can see one definite use for {{<a href="../../../s/o/c/Template%7ESocks_eac9.html" title="Template:Socks">socks</a>}}, though--if you're doing a 2nd (or 3rd, or 4th) SSP report, you can then say "this user has already used socks, see {{<a href="../../../s/o/c/Template%7ESocks_eac9.html" title="Template:Socks">socks</a>}}" (and hopefully the previous cases got tagged). <a href="../../../a/k/h/User%7EAkhilleus_723e.html" title="User:Akhilleus">--Akhilleus</a> (<a href="../../../a/k/h/User_talk%7EAkhilleus_f0d5.html" title="User talk:Akhilleus">talk</a>) 06:10, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Can't speak for DB or any of the other clerks/CUs/what-have-you, but for my part, I think we're coming on a bit strong, here, in large part because we're still more than a bit emotional over recent affairs.

<p>Ben, the problem is a bit difficult to describe. As you know, the SSP cases each have their own subpage, which are transcluded onto the main SSP page. Basically, halfway down the list of active cases, the listing went bonkers. The specific locus was in <a href="../../../s/u/s/Wikipedia%7ESuspected_sock_puppets_Classicjupiter2_465c.html" title="Wikipedia:Suspected sock puppets/Classicjupiter2">Wikipedia:Suspected sock puppets/Classicjupiter2</a>, in the line where <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProtector777_efed.html" title="User:Protector777">Protector777</a> (<span class="plainlinks"><a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProtector777_3c09.html" title="User talk:Protector777">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Protector777_cd80.html" title="Special:Contributions/Protector777"><span title="Contributions: Protector777">contribs</span></a> • <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Log/move?user=Protector777" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Log/move?user=Protector777" rel="nofollow"><span title="Page moves: Protector777"><font color="#002BB8">page&#160;moves</font></span></a> • <a href="../../../b/l/o/Special%7EBlockip_Protector777_0aed.html" title="Special:Blockip/Protector777"><span title="Block User:Protector777">block&#160;user</span></a> • <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_block_4a41.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_block_4a41.html" rel="nofollow"><span title="Blocklog: Protector777"><font color="#002BB8">block&#160;log</font></span></a></span>) was listed--instead of what you see there, there was a messed-up line that included the word "separator" as a blue link, "page move" as a red link. The following users in the list simply appeared as user, and the comments to the case didn't appear; the rest of the cases in the list didn't transclude properly, but simply appeared as links, like <a href="../../../s/u/s/Wikipedia%7ESuspected_sock_puppets_Adversegecko_0f23.html" title="Wikipedia:Suspected sock puppets/Adversegecko">Wikipedia:Suspected sock puppets/Adversegecko</a>.</p>
<p>The weird thing is, the case subpage for Classicjupiter2 displayed normally, and so did the rest of the cases. I don't get it. It might be some peculiarity of my local setup, I guess. But we can try to test it, and see if the anomaly happens again. I'll be available for a few hours tonight, and again tomorrow afternoon. <a href="../../../a/k/h/User%7EAkhilleus_723e.html" title="User:Akhilleus">--Akhilleus</a> (<a href="../../../a/k/h/User_talk%7EAkhilleus_f0d5.html" title="User talk:Akhilleus">talk</a>) 04:39, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, my eyebrows went up at the fact that the problem started halfway down the page. If it was inherent to the template, or even to how the template behaved when transcluded on a subpage that was then transcluded onto a main page -- it should have happened <i>every single time it was used there</i>, not work fine in the top half and break down in the bottom half. So this is a major clue that the nature of the problem is something else.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It doesn't surprise me that the subpage itself looks fine: there you're looking at a transcluded template but not on a transcluded subpage; you're seeing the page directly.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>My first thought was that maybe something about that line, in the Protector 777 entry or just above it, had some odd character, extra {'s or whatever, that Wiki-parsing misinterpreted, sort of the way omitting or adding an apostrophe in the double-apostrophe italics tag early in a paragraph can screw up your italic or boldface formatting for the rest of the paragraph. So I went and looked closely at that area of that subpage... and found nothing even vaguely likely to have such a result. <i>(Drat!)</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>My second thought, and my current working hypothesis, is this:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Transclusion creates a certain amount of overhead for the system. Not much for each transclusion, but it adds up. This is one of the reasons templates are no longer allowed in the signature or "nickname" of our account preferences. (Not the only reason; it would be too easy to change a signature all over Wikipedia by altering the template, both "changing history" and creating a sudden huge transclusion workload as all the signed occurences were changed.)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Well, first of all <a href="../../../s/s/p/WP%7ESSP_fb6b.html" title="WP:SSP">WP:SSP</a>'s main page has a <b>huge</b> number of "user5" templates, due to all its transcluded subpages (compared to relatively few on each individual subpage). And secondly, the last update incorporated a bunch of subtemplate transclusions to "user5"... so, multiplied all together, it took the system a while to process all the changes. Apparently it had only gotten halfway down <a href="../../../s/s/p/WP%7ESSP_fb6b.html" title="WP:SSP">WP:SSP</a>, and after that the changes weren't fully processed.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I wonder whether everything would have looked normal had you seen the page five minutes later, due to the system catching up... or whether it would have stayed stuck like that, due to some limit on how many transclusions per page will be processed at all. But I don't wonder <u>enough</u> to want to go back and try it again just to find out.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>One of my major changes from the last attempt was to eliminate as many transclusions as I could. Except for "rfcu" (which subcontracts its work to subtemplates), all the subtemplates -- including the separator dot, {{<a href="../../../%C2%B7/_/_/Template%7E%C2%B7.html" title="Template:·">·</a>}} -- have been replaced by hardcodes, reducing the workload immensely. That may be all the solution that we need. I hope so, and it would make sense given what you saw on the page. -- <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBen_7cee.html" title="User:Ben">Ben</a> 05:24, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Ben, your explanation makes sense, although I did reload the page a couple of times before I posted the request to revert. I wonder if in the future SSP cases should subst the {{<a href="../../../u/s/e/Template%7EUser5_a4e5.html" title="Template:User5">user5</a>}} templates. The main page takes a long time to load sometimes.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Probably a good idea. It would vastly reduce the transclusion workload. <s>One side-effect would be the "rfcu" link would not update on any existing entry if a checkuser were later opened on that user, so you might miss seeing some relevant info from after the subpage's creation... but if your users are aware of that, and treat the absence of the link as "there was no rfcu report <b>then</b>" rather than "there is no rfcu report <b>now</b>", they can always check for new entries with a new rfcu request, even in preview mode and not saved.&lt;/s? -- <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBen_7cee.html" title="User:Ben">Ben</a> 05:54, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</s></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>... <s>or I could drop the whole idea of rfcu being a "disappearing" link in user5 (take out the "cond=n" parameter), and just let it stay a redlink when there's no rfcu page. But this was why Ryulong reverted the change to user5 before, he found that "ugly", and the "disappearing" feature was the condition he demanded to allow the update back in. His other suggestion was the WP:SSP use a new template with rfcu in it, and leave user5 alone. So you may want to think that one over.</s> -- <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBen_7cee.html" title="User:Ben">Ben</a> 06:14, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Akhilleus, the GOOD news is that WP:SSP does not appear to have been hosed up. In fact, please tell me if it is any slower-loading than before, or the reverse. And the <i><u>other</u></i> GOOD news is that <b>{{subst:user5|Mykungfu}}</b> does <i><u>not</u></i> lose the auto-updating feature of "rfcu"; that <i><u>will</u></i> continue to show new pages created after the subst'ing. Example of subst'd template:<br />

So please recommend subst'ing if there's a slow load at WP:SSP, to reduce the transclusion overhead <i><u>without</u></i> losing any functionality. Yayyyy! -- <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBen_7cee.html" title="User:Ben">Ben</a> 02:36, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm not getting that result now, and (from resolving the code by subst'ing) I don't see anything that could have caused it.

<p>Aha, there never was a problem with Firstocean's entry, which is why checking <u>that</u> block log never found one. The problem was solely with Prolancet's entry, and we could both have stared at our screens forever without seeing it... because it wasn't there to be seen.<br /></p>
<center><i>Last night I met upon the stair<br />
A little man who wasn't there.<br />
He wasn't there again today;<br />
I wish, I wish he'd go away!</i></center>
<p>The difference between the first and second times Prolancet's name was typed was that on the first try an <b>invisible character</b> was put after the final T and before the first closing bracket.</p>
<p>Here's a cut-and-paste of that segment → Prolancet‎}</p>
<p>Go into edit mode, put your cursor just after the bracket, and backspace/delete (NOT left-arrow): first stroke, you delete the bracket; second stroke, <u>nothing seems to happen</u>; third stroke, you delete the final T. That second stroke deleted the invisible character.</p>
<p>I would guess that, in trying to type the first closing bracket, some almost-correct key combination like control or alt or fn, plus ] or }, got entered, resulting in no wrong visible character, no visible character at all. Anyone would naturally shrug and go on to type both closing brackets correctly. Everything else parsed the username without a problem, but block-log could not....</p>
<p>It's the "intermittent" problem that's the real headache, isn't it, like the car that squeaks <u>except when</u> the mechanic is there. At this point taking a sledgehammer to the car is generally a great stress-reliever, though perhaps a bit more expensive in the long term than two pints of Guinness at the local pub while grousing to the publican and your fellow drinkers. <span title="Formerly ''Benedict the Moor''">—&#160;<a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBen_7cee.html" title="User:Ben"><i><b>Ben</b></i></a> <small><sup><strong class="selflink"><b>TALK</b></strong></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ben_81a3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ben"><b>HIST</b></a></sub></small></span> 01:44, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Ben, thanks for your work on this. I'm in favor of implementing it, obviously; the only question is whether we should wait for comments.

<p>Alright, way to be bold! Thing is, the instructions are still complicated, because of the unfortunate decision someone made at the beginning of SSP to have separate pages (2nd, 3rd, 4th, etc.) for each case on a particular user. Using the {{<a href="../../../s/s/p/Template%7ESsp_8316.html" title="Template:Ssp">ssp</a>}} template to discover previous cases is clever, but it will be beyond the capability of some users. Is there any way to have the inputbox run a script to see if a case has already been filed on a sockmaster? Or, the other thing to do is to steal another idea from RCU and have each sockmaster get a single case page, no matter how many times they're reported. Looking at the subpages of SSP (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3APrefixindex&amp;from=Suspected+sock+puppets%2F&amp;namespace=4" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3APrefixindex&amp;from=Suspected+sock+puppets%2F&amp;namespace=4" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>) shows a pretty healthy number of sockmasters w/multiple cases, and there's always the danger that one of them (like Mykungfu) might get a new case filed, and then you'd have 5 Mykungfu cases, with new information getting added to the 1st case. I'm not sure how to solve this problem, but I wanted the reporting system to be as simple, and elegant, as the one at RCU, and unfortunately it isn't. <a href="../../../a/k/h/User%7EAkhilleus_723e.html" title="User:Akhilleus">--Akhilleus</a> (<a href="../../../a/k/h/User_talk%7EAkhilleus_f0d5.html" title="User talk:Akhilleus">talk</a>) 15:48, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Gahhh, what a long link to encode! Try <a href="../../../p/r/e/Special%7EPrefixindex_Wikipedia%7ESuspected_sock_puppets__51f1.html" title="Special:Prefixindex/Wikipedia:Suspected sock puppets/">Special:Prefixindex/Wikipedia:Suspected sock puppets/</a> next time! I've just added [[Special:Prefixindex/{{FULLPAGENAME}}/|subpages]] to the "Closed archives" box on <a href="../../../s/s/p/WP%7ESSP_fb6b.html" title="WP:SSP">WP:SSP</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I completely agree with you about the complexity of the case-filing system. I use the same simple-minded search engine, {{<a href="../../../h/i/g/Template%7EHighrfc-loop_e038.html" title="Template:Highrfc-loop">highrfc-loop</a>}}, to search for RfAs, RfBs, RfArbs, RfC/Users, and SSPs, and it has to take account of not only the "_(2nd)" style of suffixes but also "_(2)", "_2", and "-2", because the different areas use different subpage-numbering formats, and sometimes more than one. I even thought about coding for Roman numerals, because some people have used those, but then I remembered actual usernames like "Giano II", and my brain began to hurt from trying to distinguish between "the second case involving 'Giano'" and "the first case involving 'Giano II'". It's bad enough that usernames might also end with "_2" or "-2", as it is.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, it would be much easier all around to keep one file per username and just add to it over time, the way <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFCU_026f.html" title="WP:RFCU">WP:RFCU</a> does. Cross-indexing sockpuppet names would also be a wonderful feature to add, because right now it's not easy to find out whether someone's been investigated as a sockpuppet (rather than a puppetmaster) since the filenames don't cover puppets. You just have to hope the userpage got tagged at some point in its history.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The solution would be to adopt an RFCU-like system -- which would even allow cross-referring the cases between SSP and RFCU, as long as the two areas chose the same username to title the report on a group of IDs.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>So, first step: propose the change. Second step: get it approved. Third step: revise the new-case creation system to match RFCU's, wherein a little outright theft of code seems appropriate. Fourth step, and here's the heartbreaker: go through all the existing files, and consolidate the multiples.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>For investigation: Will we have to make any other changes in file format (once they're all singles) to let RFCU's system work for SSP?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>My lovable and cuddlesome and bright little {{<a href="../../../s/s/p/Template%7ESsp_8316.html" title="Template:Ssp">ssp</a>}}, whom you'd take home to meet your mother, will handle either system, without changing any code. The system change would make things simpler, not harder, for templates as well as for human beings. {{<a href="../../../r/f/c/Template%7ERfcu_707f.html" title="Template:Rfcu">rfcu</a>}} is simpler than {{<a href="../../../s/s/p/Template%7ESsp_8316.html" title="Template:Ssp">ssp</a>}}, though I think earnestness of character counts for something too.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Now, just one more question, to make your brain hurt too: who gets to go revise all those {{<a href="../../../s/o/c/Template%7ESocksuspect_fb39.html" title="Template:Socksuspect">socksuspect</a>}} and {{<a href="../../../s/o/c/Template%7ESocksuspectnotice_9e3a.html" title="Template:Socksuspectnotice">socksuspectnotice</a>}} templates that are currently linking to (2nd), (3rd), (4th), etc., cases, and redirect them to the new single files? (Since they've been subst'd, we can't just change the template code and have the posted copies all snap into shape.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Well, I'm in favor, but we'd all better realize that the changeover will take hard work, and time. We'll need to build the new version of <a href="../../../s/s/p/WP%7ESSP_fb6b.html" title="WP:SSP">WP:SSP</a> on a secondary page, copy over all the subpages too, make the changes to the copies, keep "mirroring" the updates to the main SSP, and test the new system thoroughly, so that on The Day we can just rename the main page to old, rename the new page to main (and thus with all the subpages -- we'll need to automate this step to make it happen <b>fast</b>), and there everything will be neatly in place to go on with. When we're sure it's solid, and nothing's missing, <b>then</b> delete the old versions.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I think this will take more than the two of us.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I, for one, don't have the system authorizations to do the moves and copies and deletes, or the skills (yet) to write the bots/scripts. At the speed I work, and the number of hours per day I can invest, I don't know how long it would take me alone just to consolidate multiples into singles.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The archives, oh my goodness, they're organized by month of case-closing, so the same-username cases aren't even filed together... and who the heck would know (or care) <b>when</b> an old case was closed, if all they've got is a suspect username, and all they're trying to find out is whether User:JohnDoe is a sockpuppet or sockpuppeteer? Where the heck is an index of cases by <b>username</b>, covering both puppetmasters and puppets? Thank goodness for the userpage histories, if people remembered to use appropriate edit summaries (did they?) at least the taggings should show up -- but if the evidence wasn't conclusive enough on earlier reports, there won't be anything shown on the block logs.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Yechh. I hope you're well-and-truly daunted by the prospect. I sure am. We need the advice of some seriously skilled and experienced gurus here. They may know ways to make this a much simpler conversion. For one thing, let's ask the people who set up RFCU for advice. It would be in their best interests, because the better SSP works, the less workload overflows into RFCU. -- <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBen_7cee.html" title="User:Ben"><span title="Formerly ''Benedict the Moor''"><i><b>Ben</b></i></span></a> <small><sup><strong class="selflink"><b>TALK</b></strong></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ben_81a3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ben"><b>HIST</b></a></sub></small> 21:58, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I didn't answer this before: <i>"Is there any way to have the inputbox run a script to see if a case has already been filed on a sockmaster?"</i> I didn't see that option in the documentation, and have never seen the underlying code -- I assume it involves Javascript, but I don't really know even whether that's all it's written in. It would be a nice feature to suggest to the author, but I suspect the answer will be: "If you enter a pre-existing file name and click the button, you'll find the pre-existing file in front of you instead of the preload (unfilled-out form), and the editintro header <u>won't</u> be at the top of the page. Doesn't that already tell you whether a case has been filed?" -- <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBen_7cee.html" title="User:Ben"><span title="Formerly ''Benedict the Moor''"><i><b>Ben</b></i></span></a> <small><sup><strong class="selflink"><b>TALK</b></strong></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ben_81a3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ben"><b>HIST</b></a></sub></small> 22:21, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Ben, I think you've demonstrated that the SSP filing system won't change soon. To merge all the Mykungfu cases, just as one example, would require merging page histories--the kind of thing that has to be done manually by an admin. And there are at least 55 suspected sockmasters that have multiple SSP cases. In contrast, changing the links in the subst'd {{<a href="../../../s/o/c/Template%7ESocksuspect_fb39.html" title="Template:Socksuspect">socksuspect</a>}} and {{<a href="../../../s/o/c/Template%7ESocksuspect_fb39.html" title="Template:Socksuspect">socksuspect</a>}} notice cases wouldn't be that difficult--as long as you know how to code a bot. I don't.</p>
<p>As a stopgap, though, one of the other kinds of inputbox is a search box. Maybe we could put one on the SSP page, so one of the steps in filing a case would be a search for "Special:Prefixindex/Wikipedia:Suspected sock puppets/PUPPETMASTER". Try this:</p>
<table border="0" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

<td align="center" bgcolor="">

</tr>
</table>
<p>Put "Mykungfu" in there, and you find his cases; put "Akhilleus" in there, and you find that so far, I'm clean...</p>

<p>That's a very crafty trick, using the "create" inputbox that way. I'll remember that in the future.</p>
<p>As for your question about {{<a href="../../../s/o/c/Template%7ESocksuspect_fb39.html" title="Template:Socksuspect">socksuspect</a>}}, I suspect the answer is that the whole "system" of SSP was built piece-by-piece on an ad hoc basis, and no one ever gave much thought to how the whole structure worked.

<dd>Thank you so much for all the help, Neil. I know I've been a bother, getting you to unlock the tool cabinets every time I wanted to tinker with the gadgets, add bells and whistles, or develop brand new gadgets myself -- and I appreciate your willingness and kind forbearance. Getting my own set of keys to the tool cabinets would surely make some things quicker for me, and easier for the people I keep pestering to open it.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If it was just a question of the editing access -- edit protected templates, move or delete pages -- and if people felt they could trust me to always do that wisely and well, given my occasional blunders and my quite short Wiki-history, I'd be happy of that. Tinkering with the works seems to be my calling here.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The rest of the admin role, such as the "cop" duties, and particularly the social divide that seems to exist between admins and non-admins -- perhaps inevitably, from the imbalance of power (one party can block the other, not vice versa, and they both know it) -- is something I need to think about, long and hard. And I rather think people ought to be nervous about handing it out to someone without a longer track record.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>You know, just a partial "admin bit", something like "trusted editor" status <u>without</u> the blocking powers, might be a useful option for the project. Clearly it's possible for powers to be subdivided, like the differences between admin and bureaucrat and steward -- or the difference between unregistered editor and newly registered editor and established editor with regard to creating pages or editing semiprotected pages. One more such gradation of access should be entirely do-able. Could we broach that idea widely enough, and high enough, that it might have some chance of being considered and even acted upon? -- <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBen_7cee.html" title="User:Ben"><span title="Formerly ''Benedict the Moor''"><i><b>Ben</b></i></span></a> <small><sup><strong class="selflink"><b>TALK</b></strong></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ben_81a3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ben"><b>HIST</b></a></sub></small> 19:42, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Ben, wanted to ask a favour as you're a wiz with templates. Have a look at <a href="../../../u/r/a/Uranium.html" title="Uranium">Uranium</a>, which is the main page FA at the moment. We had a bit of a problem when one of the templates used in it was vandalised tracking down which the problem. As you can see it uses over 40 templates to create the infobox. Do you think you (or someone else who's good with templates) could create a single (or a few) template (s) with multiple parameters to do the same job? That number of templates just to create an infobox seems ridiculous. Would appreciate your input. <span style="font-family: Verdana"><a href="../../../w/j/b/User%7EWJBscribe_824e.html" title="User:WJBscribe"><b>WjB</b></a><a href="../../../w/j/b/User_talk%7EWJBscribe_3a3f.html" title="User talk:WJBscribe"><i>scribe</i></a></span> 02:25, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have to say, it's a beautiful modular design: {{<a href="../../../e/l/e/Template%7EElementbox_header_967d.html" title="Template:Elementbox header">Elementbox_header</a>}} starts the infobox format, then subsequent subtemplates get slotted in as they're invoked, and finally {{<a href="../../../e/l/e/Template%7EElementbox_footer_2ab7.html" title="Template:Elementbox footer">Elementbox_footer</a>}} closes the infobox. This makes any single template fairly simple by comparison, and thus easy to maintain. Considering the total amount of information conveyed, and the opt-in feature (the subtemplates are only invoked if, and in the sequence, you choose to invoke them), it's the most efficient and flexible design I can imagine.
<p>There actually are single templates available already -- {{<a href="../../../e/l/e/Template%7EElement_fbcb.html" title="Template:Element">Element</a>}} and {{<a href="../../../e/l/e/Template%7EElementbox_552d.html" title="Template:Elementbox">Elementbox</a>}} -- which do take multiple parameters as you suggest. Not being modular, such a template is much less flexible in terms of what it lists and where, but if you want to put all your eggs in one basket (<i>"and then <b>watch that basket!</b>"</i>, as Mark Twain wrote), try that.</p>
Either way, you'll want to protect anything transcluded into the Main Page, and cascading protection should work as well on the infobox subtemplates as on a single {{<a href="../../../e/l/e/Template%7EElement_fbcb.html" title="Template:Element">Element</a>}} or {{<a href="../../../e/l/e/Template%7EElementbox_552d.html" title="Template:Elementbox">Elementbox</a>}} template; conversely, leaving either method <u>un</u>protected is still an opportunity for vandals. -- <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBen_7cee.html" title="User:Ben"><span title="Formerly ''Benedict the Moor''"><i><b>Ben</b></i></span></a> <small><sup><strong class="selflink"><b>TALK</b></strong></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ben_81a3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ben"><b>HIST</b></a></sub></small> 20:21, 19 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks for taking a look into the matter. I confess the technical elements were beyond my expertise. Given the discussions at <a href="../../../a/n/i/WP%7EANI_afbb.html" title="WP:ANI">WP:ANI</a> about how to deal with templates in main page FAs the multiple template issue is far reduced.

<dd>I hadn't seen CSCWEM's RfA, which certainly provides extra reason not to start the race before the gun goes off; thank you. The instructions I'd seen spoke only of not embarrassing the nominee if he/she decides not to accept, and on that basis I wished only to say that my support for the nomination was not dependent on the nominee's acceptance or answers to questions -- I have simply seen so much of WjB's contributing style in <i>issue-deciding</i> areas (as distinct from article edits), and found it so consistently responsible (<i><b>even</b></i> in contentious discussions, <i><b>even</b></i> when we disagreed) that I no longer have any reasonable doubt as to how WjB will handle admin tools.

<p>I just wanted to ask you a question, personally. Do you think that the difference between the two templates, if the latter is kept, should be made between images and text, or sexual and merely non-sexual offensive? I think that the latter distinction would be more useful than the former... what do you think? <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGracenotes_686d.html" title="User:Gracenotes"><font color="#960">Grace</font><font color="#000">notes</font></a><sup><a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGracenotes_98ea.html" title="User talk:Gracenotes"><font color="#960">T</font></a></sup> § 02:46, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The first was addressed to any demand for censorship, sexual or otherwise (political, religious, etc.), and was intended to remain general, even generic.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The second concerned specifically images, and addressed demands for censorship of images involving "nudity" -- though as noted the box text had come from <a href="../../../b/r/e/Talk%7EBreast_903e.html" title="Talk:Breast">Talk:Breast</a>, which isn't even a matter of "nudity" in many states -- rather than necessarily "sexuality". A mother nursing her infant, or a cutaway diagram showing the <i>internal</i> anatomy of the breast, isn't a matter of "sexuality" to most people.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>And as for "offensive", that's so subjective that... if we used <b>that</b> as the basis for which of the two templates to apply, how could we ever agree?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Presumably no-one would call for censorship of anything unless they either found it offensive themselves or believed that someone else would. But "offensive" is still the subjective judgment; the call for censorship is the (more objectively) observed action. <b>Both</b> templates address the call for censorship.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Enough, I think, to say that {{<a href="../../../n/o/t/Template%7ENotcensored2_396c.html" title="Template:Notcensored2">notcensored2</a>}} is for articles appropriately illustrated with images of areas of the human body that some people have insisted not be shown. This is still potentially vague, since it might refer not only to the areas covered by modern Western swimsuits, but to bare legs (shuddered the righteous Victorians) or indeed any part of a woman's body except her eyes (demands the strict Muslim).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>{{<a href="../../../n/o/t/Template%7ENotcensored_5c46.html" title="Template:Notcensored">notcensored</a>}} is for everything <b>else</b> that brings calls for censorship.

<dd>Oops, I meant nudity and not sexuality. Thanks for pointing that out. I bring this up because, as an exercise, I went through the talk archives of <a href="../../../b/r/e/Breast.html" title="Breast">Breast</a> and <a href="../../../f/u/c/Fuck.html" title="Fuck">Fuck</a>, and saw comments of fundamentally different nature. I inducted that the difference in objections was [debate about existence of article] vs. [debate about existence of images in article], which correlated in this case (and others) to [vulgar but not fully sexual] vs. [sexual/nudity stuff] (perhaps "vulgar" is a better word than "offensive"), although maybe wrong and such, or maybe the system is fine as it is. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGracenotes_686d.html" title="User:Gracenotes"><font color="#960">Grace</font><font color="#000">notes</font></a><sup><a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGracenotes_98ea.html" title="User talk:Gracenotes"><font color="#960">T</font></a></sup> § 03:22, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, I hope my answer to your question at RFCN clears up the point I was making. To elaborate here (rather than be excessive long-winded there). I am huge fan of {{<a href="../../../u/s/e/Template%7EUsernameDiscussion_1787.html" title="Template:UsernameDiscussion">UsernameDiscussion</a>}} and agree that it should be standard practice to always use that template before an RFCN is made- and I believe I have asserted that view at RFCN many times. You should recall that it was <a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAsterion_ed2e.html" title="User:Asterion">Asterion</a> and I who wrote the original version (before you gave it bells and whistles&#160;:-) ). I'm just not quite convinced that we definitely have support for that view, or particularly that existing discussion should be removed if it is found that has not been complied with. Halted is one thing, closed is another. I guess it was the use of the word "<i>invalid</i>" that concerned me- I am after all a lawyer, sorry. I personally certainly would not express a disallow opinion (except if it was a case that should have been at <a href="../../../a/i/v/WP%7EAIV_b7f6.html" title="WP:AIV">WP:AIV</a>) unless the notification was made.</p>
<p>{{<a href="../../../u/s/e/Template%7EUsernameConcern_47f1.html" title="Template:UsernameConcern">UsernameConcern</a>}} is another good template that should be used first in most cases where people are unsure, however I think whether one uses that one should be kept circumstance specific. There is no harm in someone who's pretty sure a username is an obvious vio from posting it at <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFCN_c7e4.html" title="WP:RFCN">WP:RFCN</a> for a second opinion- indeed this should be encouraged. If we insist on {{<a href="../../../u/s/e/Template%7EUsernameConcern_47f1.html" title="Template:UsernameConcern">UsernameConcern</a>}} and time to respond, then that use of RFCN is going to be discouraged and the pressure to just make a call and block will be increased. Also, admins who check <a href="../../../a/i/v/WP%7EAIV_b7f6.html" title="WP:AIV">WP:AIV</a> sometimes block usernames that I suspect RFCN would have allowed (or not reached a concensus on). So I don't think it's desirable to require too much before a post to RFCN- discussions are generally a good thing. I would welcome your toughts on these issues, of course. <span style="font-family: Verdana"><a href="../../../w/j/b/User%7EWJBscribe_824e.html" title="User:WJBscribe"><b>WjB</b></a><a href="../../../w/j/b/User_talk%7EWJBscribe_3a3f.html" title="User talk:WJBscribe"><i>scribe</i></a></span> 04:29, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I now see your post on the RFCN talkpage. I couldn't find that bit of policy- yes it seem to confirm the requirement of the notification. I still think the close discussion/ put in on hold distinction has to be addressed though... <span style="font-family: Verdana"><a href="../../../w/j/b/User%7EWJBscribe_824e.html" title="User:WJBscribe"><b>WjB</b></a><a href="../../../w/j/b/User_talk%7EWJBscribe_3a3f.html" title="User talk:WJBscribe"><i>scribe</i></a></span> 04:32, 22 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Doesn't look like we'll get to talk until I'm next online. But it does seem important to me that we make sure we have a full discussion on RFCN process so everyone can feel confident in whats going on. My main concern is that we factor in human nature (taking shortcuts rather than following longer procedures) and make sure that rules designed to help users about who's names concerns are raised doesn't inadvertantly hurt them. We don't want to push people down the block/AIV route because they think its too much of hastle going to RFCN- even if the fairest system would require a full discussion with any user who had a username that one wasn't 100% certain was a problem. We need to make sure the 98% and 99% sures go to RFCN not to AIV (where whether they get blocked is a random function of which admin sees the report and what they think). <span style="font-family: Verdana"><a href="../../../w/j/b/User%7EWJBscribe_824e.html" title="User:WJBscribe"><b>WjB</b></a><a href="../../../w/j/b/User_talk%7EWJBscribe_3a3f.html" title="User talk:WJBscribe"><i>scribe</i></a></span> 04:55, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ouch, you got hit by the "lack of article experience" crew. Sorry I didn't notice you were on the ballot or I would've put in a good word for you. They do have a point though, not that article writing is necessary to understand adminship, but because your behaviour when faced with editing disputes is very indicative of how you will act at other times. Well, you know what to do now: write a couple pages and try again. --<a href="../../../t/j/s/User%7ETjstrf_ba84.html" title="User:Tjstrf">tjstrf</a> <small><a href="../../../t/j/s/User_talk%7ETjstrf_3ddb.html" title="User talk:Tjstrf">talk</a></small> 01:13, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi. I think you mistake me. Please check my comments in that area (page and talk page). Everything you <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/User_names&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=117142304" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/User_names&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=117142304" rel="nofollow">said here</a> I've said, though I think more gently. Your point "how would you like to be treated" is exactly the source of my motivation.</p>
<p>I would <b>really</b> like to get people to discuss this, but on the <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia_talk%7ERequests_for_comment_User_names_75df.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Requests for comment/User names">talk page</a>, else we will be sniping at each other (me too) on the <b>wrong page</b> and <i>repeating</i> ourselves there, to no good end. Hey, those project pages get archived out of sight quickly! It is when I realized I'd said my position twice over, there, that I quit and started pointing "that way<big>→</big>".</p>
<p>When I said "... and some guidelines when prior notice is precluded." I was trying to entice the "we shouldn't need to wait!" position to come up with something concrete about when that would be true. We'll always need to apply common sense, but it would be nice to have a framework of progression stated. I've seen some admins block a vandal very quickly, but usually when reviewing the contributions shows the last N have been bv, or an obvious sockpuppet. Anything less than that, I like the idea of progressing through the levels uw-xxxx1 to uw-xxxx4. It's something about wanting to be blameless (forlorn hope and all that).</p>
<p>I'm afraid I take the long view. When there is something 'wrong', it will be dealt with sooner or later. The 'wrongness' has been noted, now we'll get down to addressing it. (I think/hope).</p>
<p>I can understand your frustration. It all seems so obvious. After looking in on one discussion for a couple of months, I finally couldn't help but post at least twice "isn't 4+ months kinda long for 'mediation'?" I don't think that helped, really. Of course, then I found out more about the complications, and that their first mediator had to leave WP suddenly. After another month they agreed close to what I'd thought they should do from the first look. (except with excess nod to one vociferous side, and too little to the other (life!))</p>
<p>The long process can work, you just have to grit your teeth, scream at the wall and not with the keyboard, and point back at the unresolved problems. And I don't think very long here. Maybe if we start with proposals that everyone can hate? <a href="../../../s/h/e/User%7EShenme_67cd.html" title="User:Shenme">Shenme</a> 02:09, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Just came across it, thought I'd toss in a link at the very bottom to a compromise solution, a separate /Warnings subpage where stuff could be moved off the talkpage if one wanted the talkpage kept clean.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Not that it should really be <i>necessary</i>, because as long as the warner left a good edit summary, even just the name of the warning template, anyone can go through the talkpage history, spot the warning entries, and bring up the original postings with all details.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>But for those who really don't want to make things harder for anyone, archiving them on a subpage is a nice way to show: "Hey, I'm not hiding anything, I just want my talkpage kept for actual <b>talk</b>, warnings are all kept over there."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Or if you need to keep clear and easily found records on a real troublemaker, a protected /Warnings subpage would preserve the warnings from deletion, while letting the user chat (or rant) on the talkpage to his heart's content -- something you can't do if the talkpage has to serve <b>both</b> purposes at the same time.</dd>

<p>Ben, would you mind keeping a little more of a check on your temper? Your badgering of every voter in the Demsaredonkeys was problematic and a little pointy. And your recent overuse of bold text to make your points is verging on the incivil. I know you feel passionately about the issues involved, but I do not appreciate being shouted out- which is exactly the impression I got from reading your reply to me at <a href="../../../r/f/c/WT%7ERFCN_e8e0.html" title="WT:RFCN">WT:RFCN</a>.

<p>Right, I'm off to bed- if you want to restore the discussion (please include the disallow comments) to <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFCN_c7e4.html" title="WP:RFCN">WP:RFCN</a> and waste everybody's time with a discuss of a clear violation feel free. I did not block it for being inflammatory but for being long and nonsensical (which I still think it is despite your clever attempt at an explanation), but if a consensus develops to unblock I will do so (or make no objection to another admin doing so). In return I would like you to give serious thought to how much more easily you could have obtained this outcome had you approached me in a friendly manner rather than the hostile route you chose to take. I think we could all achieve a lot more in terms of building the encyclopedia if less time was wasted fretting at <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFCN_c7e4.html" title="WP:RFCN">WP:RFCN</a>, which is becoming rather a process-heavy timesink for everybody. <span style="font-family: Verdana"><a href="../../../w/j/b/User%7EWJBscribe_824e.html" title="User:WJBscribe"><b>WjB</b></a><a href="../../../w/j/b/User_talk%7EWJBscribe_3a3f.html" title="User talk:WJBscribe"><i>scribe</i></a></span> 03:06, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Not to be obtuse, but... <i>huh???</i> The Demsaredonkeys discussion has no need to be restored, so far it's still active, and demonstrating the meaning of "inflammatory" in an exemplary manner.

<p>Ben, can you please reread over the whole discussion regarding this, I actually was going to close this earlier as disallow, but after reading over this quite a few times, and reading over both arguments, both had good arguments, hence I closed this as no consensus, default to allow. My personal idea of this was it should be disallowed, I didn't comment, but that was my opinion. It wasn't simply vote counting, I'd thought about this long and hard, and this was the only conclusion I could come to <a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyanpostlethwaite_bb6d.html" title="User:Ryanpostlethwaite">Ryanpostlethwaite</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_ryanpostlethwaite_1aae.html" title="Special:Contributions/ryanpostlethwaite">contribs</a>/<a href="../../../r/y/a/User_talk%7ERyanpostlethwaite_d7e9.html" title="User talk:Ryanpostlethwaite">talk</a> 23:07, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm still applying the general format to all of the entries.
