<p><b>Benjamin Miles "C-Note" Franklin</b>, played by <a href="../../../r/o/c/Rockmond_Dunbar_f4d2.html" title="Rockmond Dunbar">Rockmond Dunbar</a>, is a fictional character from the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">American</a> <a href="../../../t/e/l/Television_series.html" title="Television series">television series</a>, <i><a href="../../../p/r/i/Prison_Break_4011.html" title="Prison Break">Prison Break</a></i>. The character was introduced as a prisoner in the <a href="../../../p/i/l/Pilot_%28Prison_Break_episode%29_4152.html" title="Pilot (Prison Break episode)">pilot episode</a>. The actor was promoted from a recurring guest star to a regular cast member midway through the first season.</p>
<p>Franklin was a <a href="../../../s/e/r/Sergeant.html" title="Sergeant">Sergeant</a> in the <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._Army_6c52.html" title="U.S. Army">U.S. Army</a>, stationed in <a href="../../../k/u/w/Kuwait.html" title="Kuwait">Kuwait</a>. While serving as a guard for a detention facility, he discovered illegal torture of several detainees and reported this to his commander. C-Note's commander dishonorably discharged him for his involvement in black market activities after C-Note refused to agree to keep quiet about the incident. With the shame of dishonorable discharge hanging over him, C-Note was unable to find other work to pay the rent for his wife Kacee and daughter Dede, so he resorted to criminal means. His brother-in-law, Darius Morgan (<a href="../../../m/i/k/Mike_Jones_%28rapper%29_2e61.html" title="Mike Jones (rapper)">Mike Jones</a>) was a truck driver and suggested that he could help transport stolen goods. Eventually, C-Note was caught and because he would not give up the identities of his friends, he was sent to <a href="../../../f/o/x/Fox_River_State_Penitentiary_ec37.html" title="Fox River State Penitentiary">Fox River State Penitentiary</a>. He told his wife and daughter that he was getting shipped back to Iraq (as he had not even told them of his discharge from the Army). He begged his brother in law not to let them know he was going to be imprisoned.</p>

C-Note in season 1.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>C-Note eventually started working in the prison kitchen and gained a reputation as the "prison pharmacist", being able to acquire any item or substance for other inmates for $100, or a "<a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_one_hundred-dollar_bill_050f.html" title="United States one hundred-dollar bill">C-Note</a>" (which, in conjunction with his namesake's appearance on the bill, spawned his nickname). He and <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Scofield_9b59.html" title="Michael Scofield">Michael Scofield</a> first crossed paths when Michael asks him to obtain some <a href="../../../p/u/g/PUGNAc_59f6.html" title="PUGNAc">PUGNAc</a> to allow Michael to feign <a href="../../../d/i/a/Diabetes.html" title="Diabetes">diabetes</a> and thus gain access to the infirmary (a critical aspect of his escape plan). C-Note was curious but Michael refused to tell him what it was for. In "<a href="../../../a/l/l/Allen_%28Prison_Break_episode%29_272a.html" title="Allen (Prison Break episode)">Allen</a>", C-Note refused to deal with Michael after seeing him associating with <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theodore__T-Bag__Bagwell_eb71.html" title="Theodore &quot;T-Bag&quot; Bagwell">T-Bag</a>, leader of a <a href="../../../w/h/i/White_supremacist.html" title="White supremacist">white supremacist</a> group in the prison. He later reconsidered after seeing Michael apparently fighting one of T-Bag's men during a riot, though his curiosity was not diminished.</p>
<p>He later became suspicious of the PI crew when he realized that they were discarding pieces of concrete across the prison yard, from the hole they had been digging in the Break Room. After the PI head, <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Abruzzi_2abe.html" title="John Abruzzi">John Abruzzi</a> was briefly replaced by Gus Fiorello, C-Note bribed him to work in PI. He discovered the hole that Michael and crew had dug as part of the escape plan. When Abruzzi regained control of PI, C-Note threatened the crew to let him on board or he would tell the guards.</p>
<p>C-Note later became a respected member of the team when he helped the team out of several problems that nearly derailed the escape plan. He also befriended <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Westmoreland_4071.html" title="Charles Westmoreland">Charles Westmoreland</a> as they both shared the same need to see their family again. One consequence of his joining the escape team, however, was C-Note being ostracized by other black inmates, ironically for the same reason C-Note had initially refused to deal with Michael: consorting with T-Bag, who had also joined the escape team. C-Note had two violent encounters with his former associates and only the escape prevented him from being killed.</p>
<p>After the "Fox River Eight's" escape, C-Note, Michael, Lincoln, Sucre, and Abruzzi met bigger problems as their escape plane took off and left them stranded with numerous police on their trail.</p>

C-Note in season 2.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The next morning, C-Note, Michael, Lincoln, Sucre, and Abruzzi continue to run from the authorities, narrowly running past a <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freight_train.html" title="Freight train">freight train</a> to evade their pursuers. C-Note becomes the outspoken man of the fugitive group. He chastises Scofield for failing to openly disclose to the group the existence of Westmoreland's money in <a href="../../../t/o/o/Tooele%2C_Utah_a75c.html" title="Tooele, Utah">Tooele, Utah</a>, and he also demanded that Abruzzi be abandoned because he took a young girl hostage when her father recognized the five as the Fox River escapees. C-Note is focused on rejoining his family, and the little trust he ever had for his fugitive comrades appears to be wearing thin. His wife and daughter were, up until the start of second season, unaware of his incarceration as he had managed to trick them into thinking he is still serving overseas in <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iraq.html" title="Iraq">Iraq</a>. They learned the truth when his escape made the news.</p>
<p>By episode 3 "<a href="../../../s/c/a/Scan_%28Prison_Break_episode%29_c4a5.html" title="Scan (Prison Break episode)">Scan</a>", C-Note contacted his wife by pay phone, and she was quite upset with his lies and even doubted that he was ever in the US Military. C-Note promised to explain everything and that he would come into a lot of money soon. He said in 7 days, that they would meet at the "Rainbow Room" at the window where they had their picture. Eavesdropping FBI agents assumed they meant a city restaurant. C-Note later meets his daughter at school and asks her to tell her mother to turn the porchlight on at seven o'clock as an indication of her trust. By the episode's end, C-Note is skulking about near his family's home, while an FBI Agent Lang interviews his wife.</p>
<p>C-Note then proceeds to make his own play for Westmoreland's money by taking a train to Utah. Borrowing a laptop and notepad from the commuter sitting next to him, C-Note accesses an online military database run by the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Army_Signal_Corps_e8de.html" title="United States Army Signal Corps">United States Army Signal Corps</a> to find the site where the money is buried. Unfortunately, midway through <a href="../../../p/r/e/Preston%2C_Idaho_29a2.html" title="Preston, Idaho">Preston, Idaho</a>, an attendant tells him that the credit card used to buy the ticket is not valid. C-Note attempts to reason with him, but the attendant calls for security. Out of options, C-Note is forced to bolt out a window, into a nearby river. He passes through <a href="../../../c/a/c/Cache_County%2C_Utah_ff43.html" title="Cache County, Utah">Cache County, Utah</a> and inquires about an <a href="../../../r/v/_/RV_3df8.html" title="RV">RV</a> for sale. He is told that it will cost $40,000.00. C-Note replies that he will be back in a couple of days with cash.</p>
<p>He is later seen hitchhiking when Sucre, driving past on his motorcyle, agrees to give him a ride. They arrive in Tooele and are reunited with Michael. They proceed to dig for the money. Unfortunately, a house had been built over the burial site. Though the fugitives were initially able to fool the residents into thinking they were maintenance men, they eventually got wise. C-Note loudly voiced his disapproval to Michael about taking innocent people hostage, and his old tensions with T-Bag also resurfaced. But these feelings later give way to excitement when they finally dig up the money. Unfortunately for C-Note, Sucre chooses this moment to double cross them all and demands the money from them while holding them at gun point. C-Note immediately leaves for his family after seeing that the money is gone. In episode "<a href="../../../u/n/e/Unearthed_%28Prison_Break_episode%29_b8cb.html" title="Unearthed (Prison Break episode)">Unearthed</a>", he meets up with his old friends back in Chicago for help with executing his plan to reunite his family. He and his wife, Kacee, and daughter Dede finally have their reunion in an alley after a narrow escape from the federal agents.</p>
<p>In the episode "<a href="../../../d/i/s/Disconnect_%28Prison_Break_episode%29_bc45.html" title="Disconnect (Prison Break episode)">Disconnect</a>", C-Note has a happy time with his family until his daughter complains of stomach problems. Kacee tells him that they don't have her medication, and they leave to find a pharmacy. While buying medication, the pharmacist recognizes Kacee, and on the pretence of needing change from the back room, calls the authorities. Kacee is arrested, but not before she drops the medication into the trash so C-Note could pick it up from there.</p>
<p>C-Note and his daughter return in "<a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Doe_%28Prison_Break_episode%29_b78b.html" title="John Doe (Prison Break episode)">John Doe</a>". C-Note is guilt-ridden over his wife's arrest, and tries to see if Kacee will be allowed <a href="../../../b/a/i/Bail.html" title="Bail">bail</a>. He plans for her to skip bail and rejoin him, and for the family to move to <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alaska.html" title="Alaska">Alaska</a>. However, Kacee's bail is denied.</p>
<p>In the episode "<a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago_%28Prison_Break_episode%29_1320.html" title="Chicago (Prison Break episode)">Chicago</a>" C-Note and Dede are in a <a href="../../../b/e/n/Benson%2C_Minnesota_d6a9.html" title="Benson, Minnesota">Benson, Minnesota</a> diner when Dede <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polycystic_kidney_disease.html" title="Polycystic kidney disease">becomes sick due to her lack of medication</a><sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup>. C-Note prepares to leave when suddenly, a man holds up the diner with a gun. After C-Note stops the man from holding up the diner, a female customer the robber was planning to kill lets him leave despite knowing his wanted status. Despite this, <a href="../../../a/g/e/Agent_Mahone_440b.html" title="Agent Mahone">Agent Mahone</a> receives a report that C-Note was spotted at the diner, and that his daughter was sick. Mahone arrives in Minnesota, but C-Note manages to evade him by boarding a train. After C-Note had to resort to painful means at a free clinic to help his daughter, he calls Mahone and offers to turn himself in if his wife will be released. Mahone agrees, and in return, C-Note must give him information on Michael - the website <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europeangoldfinch.net.html" title="Europeangoldfinch.net">Europeangoldfinch.net</a>, which C-Note overheard Michael telling Sucre about in Utah. When C-Note <a href="../../../w/a/s/Wash_%28Prison_Break_episode%29_86d4.html" title="Wash (Prison Break episode)">could not find</a> Michael's location, Mahone forces C-Note to hang himself, under orders from <a href="../../../a/g/e/Agent_Kim_03d1.html" title="Agent Kim">Agent Kim</a>, in exchange for his wife and daughter's well being. The episode ends just as C-Note jumps off his cell bed with the noose around his neck, but he is saved by a guard in <a href="../../../s/w/e/Sweet_Caroline_%28Prison_Break_episode%29_9ad8.html" title="Sweet Caroline (Prison Break episode)">the next episode</a>. In the prison infirmary, he phones the FBI and demands to speak to Mahone, but Agent Wheeler (<a href="../../../j/a/s/Jason_Davis_%28actor%29_2286.html" title="Jason Davis (actor)">Jason Davis</a>), who happens to be investigating Mahone, answers the call instead. Wheeler says he can keep C-Note safe if he tells him what Mahone asked him to do.</p>
