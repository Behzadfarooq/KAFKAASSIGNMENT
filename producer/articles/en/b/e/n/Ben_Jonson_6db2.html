<p>Although he was born in <a href="../../../w/e/s/Westminster.html" title="Westminster">Westminster</a>, <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a>, Jonson claimed his family was of <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scotland.html" title="Scotland">Scottish</a> <a href="../../../b/o/r/Border_country.html" title="Border country">Border country</a> descent, and this claim may have been supported by the fact that his <a href="../../../c/o/a/Coat_of_arms.html" title="Coat of arms">coat of arms</a> bears three <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spindle.html" title="Spindle">spindles</a> or <a href="../../../r/h/o/Rhombus.html" title="Rhombus">rhombi</a>, a device shared by a Borders family, the Johnstones of <a href="../../../a/n/n/Annandale%2C_Dumfries_and_Galloway_0131.html" title="Annandale, Dumfries and Galloway">Annandale</a>. His father died a month before Ben's birth, and his mother remarried two years later, to a master <a href="../../../b/r/i/Bricklayer.html" title="Bricklayer">bricklayer</a>. Jonson attended school in <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Martin%27s_Lane_d4ad.html" title="St. Martin's Lane">St. Martin's Lane</a>, and was later sent to <a href="../../../w/e/s/Westminster_School_ce9b.html" title="Westminster School">Westminster School</a>, where one of his teachers was <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Camden_0232.html" title="William Camden">William Camden</a>. Jonson remained friendly with Camden, whose broad scholarship evidently influenced his own style, until the latter's death in <a href="../../../1/6/2/1623.html" title="1623">1623</a>. On leaving, Jonson was once thought to have gone on to the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Cambridge_5f20.html" title="University of Cambridge">University of Cambridge</a>; Jonson himself said that he did not go to university, but was put to a trade immediately: a legend recorded by <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Fuller_8398.html" title="Thomas Fuller">Fuller</a> indicates that he worked on a garden wall in <a href="../../../l/i/n/Lincoln%27s_Inn_7f29.html" title="Lincoln's Inn">Lincoln's Inn</a>. He soon had enough of the trade, probably bricklaying, and spent some time in the <a href="../../../l/o/w/Low_Countries_e9ff.html" title="Low Countries">Low Countries</a> as a volunteer with the regiments of <a href="../../../f/r/a/Francis_Vere_6cc2.html" title="Francis Vere">Francis Vere</a>. Jonson reports that while in the Netherlands, he killed an opponent in single combat and stripped him of his weapons.<a href="http://ads.ahds.ac.uk/catalogue/adsdata/PSAS_2002/pdf/arch_scot_vol_004/04_241_270.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://ads.ahds.ac.uk/catalogue/adsdata/PSAS_2002/pdf/arch_scot_vol_004/04_241_270.pdf" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> Since the war was otherwise languishing during his service, this fight appears to have been the extent of his combat experience. Ben Jonson married some time before <a href="../../../1/5/9/1594.html" title="1594">1594</a>, to a woman he described to Drummond as "a shrew, yet honest." His wife has not been decisively identified, but she is sometimes identified as the Ann Lewis who married a Benjamin Jonson at <a href="../../../s/t/_/St_Magnus-the-Martyr_cbad.html" title="St Magnus-the-Martyr">St Magnus-the-Martyr</a>, near <a href="../../../l/o/n/London_Bridge_cbe8.html" title="London Bridge">London Bridge</a>. The registers of St. Martin's Church state that his eldest daughter Mary died in November, 1593, when she was only six months old. His eldest son Benjamin died of the plague ten years later (Jonson's epitaph to him <i><a href="../../../o/n/_/On_My_First_Sonne_dfcc.html" title="On My First Sonne">On My First Sonne</a></i> was written shortly after), and a second Benjamin died in 1635. For five years somewhere in this period, Jonson lived separate from his wife, enjoying instead the hospitality of <a href="../../../e/s/m/Esme_Stuart%2C_3rd_Duke_of_Lennox_70ba.html" title="Esme Stuart, 3rd Duke of Lennox">Lord Aubigny</a>.</p>
<p>In 1597, following the suppression of <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Isle_of_Dogs_%28play%29_92da.html" title="The Isle of Dogs (play)">The Isle of Dogs</a></i> (co-written with <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Nashe_8857.html" title="Thomas Nashe">Thomas Nashe</a>), Jonson was briefly jailed in <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marshalsea_Prison_65aa.html" title="Marshalsea Prison">Marshalsea Prison</a>, but Nashe was able to escape to the country. A year later, Jonson was again briefly imprisoned, this time in <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newgate_Prison_4021.html" title="Newgate Prison">Newgate Prison</a>, for killing another man, an actor Gabriel Spenser, in a <a href="../../../d/u/e/Duel.html" title="Duel">duel</a> on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_22.html" title="September 22">22 September</a> 1598 in Hogsden Fields,<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> (today part of <a href="../../../h/o/x/Hoxton.html" title="Hoxton">Hoxton</a>). While in prison, Jonson was visited by a <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Catholic_3b40.html" title="Roman Catholic">Roman Catholic</a> priest and converted to Catholicism. Tried on a charge of <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manslaughter.html" title="Manslaughter">manslaughter</a>, Jonson pleaded guilty but was subsequently released by <a href="../../../b/e/n/Benefit_of_clergy.html" title="Benefit of clergy">benefit of clergy</a> (a legal ploy through which he gained leniency by reciting a brief bible verse in <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latin.html" title="Latin">Latin</a>), forfeiting his "goods and chattels" and being branded on his left thumb.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/n/Ben_Jonson_6db2.html" title="Edit section: Ben Jonson's ascendance">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Ben Jonson's ascendance</span></h3>
<p>Jonson flourished as a dramatist during the first decade or so of James's reign; by <a href="../../../1/6/1/1616.html" title="1616">1616</a>, he had produced all the plays on which his reputation as a dramatist depends. These include the tragedy of <i>Catiline</i> (acted and printed 1611), which achieved only limited success, and the comedies <i><a href="../../../v/o/l/Volpone.html" title="Volpone">Volpone</a></i>, (acted 1605 and printed in 1607), <i>Epicoene, or the Silent Woman</i> (1609), <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Alchemist_%28play%29_50f3.html" title="The Alchemist (play)">The Alchemist</a></i> (1610), <i><a href="../../../b/a/r/Bartholomew_Fair_3ee7.html" title="Bartholomew Fair">Bartholomew Fair</a></i> (1614) and <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Devil_is_an_Ass_5e42.html" title="The Devil is an Ass">The Devil is an Ass</a></i> (1616). <i>The Alchemist</i> and <i>Volpone</i> appear to have been successful at once. Of <i>Epicoene</i>, Jonson told Drummond of a satirical verse which reported that the play's subtitle was appropriate, since its audience had refused to applaud the play (i.e., remained silent). Yet <i>Epicoene</i>, along with <i>Bartholomew Fair</i> and (to a lesser extent) <i>The Devil is an Ass</i> have in modern times achieved a certain degree of recognition.</p>
<p>At the same time, Jonson pursued a more prestigious career as a writer of <a href="../../../m/a/s/Masque.html" title="Masque">masques</a> for James' court. <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Entertainment_at_Althorp_538c.html" title="The Entertainment at Althorp">The Satyr</a></i> (1603) and <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Masque_of_Blackness_f089.html" title="The Masque of Blackness">The Masque of Blackness</a></i> (1605) are but two of the some two dozen masques Jonson wrote for James or for Queen Anne; the latter was praised by <a href="../../../a/l/g/Algernon_Charles_Swinburne_733a.html" title="Algernon Charles Swinburne">Swinburne</a> as the consummate example of this now-extinct genre, which mingled speech, dancing, and spectacle. On many of these projects he collaborated, not always peacefully, with designer <a href="../../../i/n/i/Inigo_Jones_e25b.html" title="Inigo Jones">Inigo Jones</a>. Perhaps partly as a result of this new career, Jonson gave up writing plays for the public theaters for a decade.</p>
<p>1616 saw a pension of 100 marks (about £60) a year conferred upon him, leading some to identify him as England's first <a href="../../../p/o/e/Poet_Laureate_4533.html" title="Poet Laureate">Poet Laureate</a>. This sign of royal favour may have encouraged him to publish the first volume of the folio collected edition of his works that year. Other volumes followed in 1640-1 and 1692. [See: <a href="../../../b/e/n/Ben_Jonson_folios_43a2.html" title="Ben Jonson folios">Ben Jonson folios</a>.]</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/6/1/1618.html" title="1618">1618</a>, Ben Jonson set out for his ancestral <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scotland.html" title="Scotland">Scotland</a> on foot. He spent over a year there, and the best-remembered hospitality which he enjoyed was that of the Scottish poet, <a href="../../../d/r/u/Drummond_of_Hawthornden_e3d9.html" title="Drummond of Hawthornden">Drummond of Hawthornden</a>. Drummond undertook to record as much of Jonson's conversation as he could in his diary, and thus recorded aspects of Jonson's personality that would otherwise have been less clearly seen. Jonson delivers his opinions, in Drummond's terse reporting, in an expansive and even magisterial mood. In the postscript added by Drummond, he is described as "a great lover and praiser of himself, a contemner and scorner of others".</p>
<p>While in Scotland, he was made an honorary <a href="../../../c/i/t/Citizen.html" title="Citizen">citizen</a> of <a href="../../../e/d/i/Edinburgh.html" title="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a>. On returning to England, he was awarded an honorary Master of Arts degree from <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Oxford_2ca4.html" title="University of Oxford">Oxford University</a>.</p>
<p>The period between 1605 and 1620 may be viewed as Jonson's heyday. In addition to his popularity on the public stage and in the royal hall, he enjoyed the patronage of aristocrats such as <a href="../../../r/o/g/Roger_Manners%2C_5th_Earl_of_Rutland_4afb.html" title="Roger Manners, 5th Earl of Rutland">Elizabeth Sidney</a> (daughter of <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philip_Sidney_e7f8.html" title="Philip Sidney">Philip Sidney</a>) and <a href="../../../l/a/d/Lady_Mary_Wroth_44be.html" title="Lady Mary Wroth">Lady Mary Wroth</a>. This connection with the Sidney family provided the impetus for one of Jonson's most famous lyrics, the <a href="../../../c/o/u/Country_house_poems.html" title="Country house poems">country house poem</a> <i>To <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penshurst_Place_c54b.html" title="Penshurst Place">Penshurst</a></i>.</p>
<p><a name="Decline_and_death" id="Decline_and_death"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/n/Ben_Jonson_6db2.html" title="Edit section: Decline and death">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Decline and death</span></h3>
<p>The 1620s begin a lengthy and slow decline for Jonson. He was still well-known; from this time dates the prominence of the <a href="../../../s/o/n/Sons_of_Ben_eb9a.html" title="Sons of Ben">Sons of Ben</a> or the "<a href="../../../t/r/i/Tribe_of_Ben_0175.html" title="Tribe of Ben">Tribe of Ben</a>", those younger poets such as <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Herrick_%28poet%29_4646.html" title="Robert Herrick (poet)">Robert Herrick</a>, <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Lovelace_fdbd.html" title="Richard Lovelace">Richard Lovelace</a>, and <a href="../../../s/i/r/Sir_John_Suckling_57ef.html" title="Sir John Suckling">Sir John Suckling</a> who took their bearing in verse from Jonson. However, a series of setbacks drained his strength and damaged his reputation.</p>
<p>Jonson returned to writing regular plays in the <a href="../../../1/6/2/1620s.html" title="1620s">1620s</a>, but these are not considered among his best. They are of significant interest for the study of the culture of <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_I_of_England_350c.html" title="Charles I of England">Charles I</a>'s England. <i>The Staple of News</i>, for example, offers a remarkable look at the earliest stage of English <a href="../../../j/o/u/Journalism.html" title="Journalism">journalism</a>. The lukewarm reception given that play was, however, nothing compared to the dismal failure of <i>The New Inn</i>; the cold reception given this play prompted Jonson to write a poem condemning his audience (the <i>Ode to Myself</i>), which in turn prompted <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Carew_452a.html" title="Thomas Carew">Thomas Carew</a>, one of the "Tribe of Ben," to respond in a poem that asks Jonson to recognize his own decline (MacLean, 88).</p>
<p>The burning of his library in <a href="../../../1/6/2/1623.html" title="1623">1623</a> was a severe blow, as his <i>Execration upon Vulcan</i> shows. In <a href="../../../1/6/2/1628.html" title="1628">1628</a> he became city chronologer of <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a>, succeeding <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Middleton_4ab2.html" title="Thomas Middleton">Thomas Middleton</a>; he accepted the salary but did little work for the office. He had suffered a debilitating stroke that year and this position eventually became a <a href="../../../s/i/n/Sinecure.html" title="Sinecure">sinecure</a>. In his last years he relied heavily for an income on his great friend and patron, <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Cavendish%2C_1st_Duke_of_Newcastle_6888.html" title="William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Newcastle">William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Newcastle</a>.</p>
<p>The principal factor in Jonson's partial eclipse was, however, the death of James and the accession of <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_I_of_England_350c.html" title="Charles I of England">King Charles I</a> in <a href="../../../1/6/2/1625.html" title="1625">1625</a>. Justly or not, Jonson felt neglected by the new court. A decisive quarrel with Jones harmed his career as a writer of court masques, although he continued to entertain the court on an irregular basis. For his part, Charles displayed a certain degree of care for the great poet of his father's day: he increased Jonson's annual pension to £100 and included a <a href="../../../t/i/e/Tierce.html" title="Tierce">tierce</a> of wine.</p>
<p>Despite the strokes that he suffered in the 1620s, Jonson continued to write. At his death in 1637 he seems to have been working on another play, <i>The Sad Shepherd</i>. Though only two acts are extant, this represents a remarkable new direction for Jonson: a move into <a href="../../../p/a/s/Pastoral.html" title="Pastoral">pastoral</a> drama.</p>
<p>Jonson is buried in <a href="../../../w/e/s/Westminster_Abbey_ded8.html" title="Westminster Abbey">Westminster Abbey</a>, with the inscription, "O Rare Ben Jonson," laid in the slab over his grave. It has been suggested that this could be read "Orare Ben Jonson" (pray for Ben Jonson), which would indicate a deathbed return to Catholicism.

<p>Apart from two tragedies that largely failed to impress Renaissance audiences and have not gained much in reputation since, Jonson's work for the public theaters was in <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comedy.html" title="Comedy">comedy</a>. These plays vary in some respects. The minor early plays, particularly those written for the <a href="../../../b/o/y/Boy_player.html" title="Boy player">boy players</a>, present somewhat looser plots and less-developed characters than those written later, for adult companies. His late plays or "dotages," particularly <i>The Magnetic Lady</i> and <i>The Sad Shepherd</i>, exhibit some signs of an accommodation with the romantic tendencies of Elizabethan comedy.</p>
<p>With these exceptions noted, however, Jonson's comic style remained constant and easily recognizable. He announces his program in the prologue to the <a href="../../../f/o/l/Folio.html" title="Folio">folio</a> version of <i>Every Man in His Humour</i>; he promises to represent "deeds, and language, such as men do use." He planned to write comedies that revived the classical premises of Elizabethan dramatic theory—or rather, since all but the loosest English comedies could claim to have descended from <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plautus.html" title="Plautus">Plautus</a> and <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terence.html" title="Terence">Terence</a>, he intended to apply those premises with rigor (Doran, 120ff). This commitment entailed negations: after <i>The Case is Altered</i>, Jonson eschewed distant locations, noble characters, romantic plots, and other staples of Elizabethan comedy. Jonson focused instead on the satiric and realistic inheritance of <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_comedy.html" title="New comedy">new comedy</a>. He sets his plays in contemporary settings, peoples them with recognizable types, and sets them to actions that, if not strictly realistic, involve everyday motives such as greed and jealousy. To this classical model Jonson applies the two features of his style which save his classical imitations from mere pedantry: the vividness with which he depicts the lives of his characters, and the intricacy of his plots. Coleridge, for instance, claimed that <i>The Alchemist</i> had one of the three most perfect plots in literature.</p>

<p>Jonson's poetry, like his drama, is informed by his classical learning. Some of his better-known poems are close translations of Greek or Roman models; all display the careful attention to form and style that often came naturally to those trained in classics in the <a href="../../../r/e/n/Renaissance_humanism.html" title="Renaissance humanism">humanist</a> manner. Jonson, however, largely avoided the debates about rhyme and meter that had consumed Elizabethan classicists such as <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Campion_9625.html" title="Thomas Campion">Campion</a> and <a href="../../../g/a/b/Gabriel_Harvey_e371.html" title="Gabriel Harvey">Harvey</a>. Accepting both rhyme and stress, Jonson uses them to mimic the classical qualities of simplicity, restraint, and precision.</p>
<p>“Epigrams” (published in the 1616 folio) is an entry in a genre that was popular among late-Elizabethan and Jacobean audiences. Jonson’s epigrams explore various attitudes, most of them from the satiric stock of the day: complaints against women, courtiers, and spies abound. The condemnatory poems are short and anonymous; Jonson’s epigrams of praise, including a famous poem to Camden and lines to Lucy Harington, are somewhat longer and mostly addressed to specific individuals. The poems of “The Forest” also appeared in the first folio. Most of the fifteen poems are addressed to Jonson’s aristocratic supporters, but the most famous are his country-house poem “To Penshurst” and the poem “To Celia” (“Come, my Celia, let us prove”) that appears also in ‘’Volpone.’’</p>
<p>‘’Underwoods,’’ published in the expanded folio of 1640, is a larger and more heterogeneous group of poems. It contains ‘’A Celebration of Charis,’’ Jonson’s most extended effort at love poetry; various religious pieces; encomiastic poems including the poem to Shakespeare and a sonnet on <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mary_Wroth_c8fb.html" title="Mary Wroth">Mary Wroth</a>; the ‘’Execration against Vulcanl” and others. The 1640 volume also contains three elegies which have often been ascribed to Donne (one of them appeared in Donne’s posthumous collected poems).</p>

<p>There are many legends about Jonson's rivalry with <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shakespeare.html" title="Shakespeare">Shakespeare</a>, some of which may be true. Drummond reports that during their conversation, Jonson scoffed at two apparent absurdities in Shakespeare's plays: a nonsensical line in <i><a href="../../../j/u/l/Julius_Caesar_%28play%29_e75d.html" title="Julius Caesar (play)">Julius Caesar</a></i>, and the setting of <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Winter%27s_Tale_cd59.html" title="The Winter's Tale">The Winter's Tale</a></i> on the non-existent seacoast of Bohemia. Drummond also reports Jonson saying that Shakespeare "wanted art." Whether Drummond is viewed as accurate or not, the comments fit well with Jonson's well-known theories about literature.</p>
<p>In <i>Timber</i>, which was published posthumously and reflects his lifetime of practical experience, Jonson offers a fuller and more conciliatory comment. He recalls being told by certain actors that Shakespeare never blotted (i.e., crossed out) a line when he wrote. His own response, "Would he had blotted a thousand," was taken as malicious. However, Jonson explains, "He was, indeed, honest, and of an open and free nature, had an excellent phantasy, brave notions, and gentle expressions, wherein he flowed with that facility that sometimes it was necessary he should be stopped".<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext04/dscv10h.htm#footnote11" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext04/dscv10h.htm#footnote11" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> Jonson concludes that "there was ever more in him to be praised than to be pardoned." Also when Shakespeare died he said "He was not of an age, but for all time."</p>
<p><a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Fuller_8398.html" title="Thomas Fuller">Thomas Fuller</a> relates stories of Jonson and Shakespeare engaging in debates in the <a href="../../../m/e/r/Mermaid_Tavern_57f5.html" title="Mermaid Tavern">Mermaid Tavern</a>; Fuller imagines conversations in which Shakespeare would run rings around the more learned but more ponderous Jonson. That the two men knew each other personally is beyond doubt, not only because of the tone of Jonson's references to him but because Shakespeare's company produced a number of Jonson's plays, at least one of which (<i><a href="../../../e/v/e/Every_Man_in_his_Humour_5fe7.html" title="Every Man in his Humour">Every Man in his Humour</a></i>) Shakespeare certainly acted in. However, it is now impossible to tell how much personal communication they had, and tales of their friendship cannot be substantiated in the present state of knowledge.</p>
<p>Jonson's most influential and revealing commentary on Shakespeare is the second of the two poems that he contributed to the prefatory verse that opens Shakespeare's <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_Folio_f42d.html" title="First Folio">First Folio</a>. This poem, "To the memory of my beloved, The AUTHOR, Mr. William Shakespeare: And what he hath left us," did a good deal to create the traditional view of Shakespeare as a poet who, despite "small Latine and less Greek," had a natural genius. The poem has traditionally been thought to exemplify the contrast Jonson perceived between himself, the disciplined and erudite classicist, scornful of ignorance and skeptical of the masses, and Shakespeare, represented in the poem as a kind of natural wonder whose genius was not subject to any rules except those of the audiences for which he wrote. But the poem itself qualifies this view: "Yet must I not give Nature all: Thy Art, / My gentle Shakespeare, must enjoy a part." Some view this elegy as a conventional exercise, but a rising number of critics see it as a heartfelt tribute to the "Sweet Swan Of Avon," the "Soul of the Age!" It has been compellingly argued that Jonson helped to edit the <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_Folio_f42d.html" title="First Folio">First Folio</a>, and he may have been inspired to write this poem, surely one of his greatest, by reading his fellow playwright's works, a number of which had been previously either unpublished or available in less satisfactory versions, in a relatively complete form.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/n/Ben_Jonson_6db2.html" title="Edit section: Reception and Influence">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Reception and Influence</span></h2>
<p>During most of the seventeenth century Jonson was a towering literary figure, and his influence was enormous. Before the civil war The Tribe of Ben touted his importance, and during the Restoration Jonson's satirical comedies and his theory and practice of "humour characters" (which are often misunderstood; see William Congreve's letters for clarification) was extremely influential, providing the blueprint for many Restoration comedies. Even a rather good-hearted comedy, Congreve's <i>The Way of the World</i>, arguably the greatest play by the greatest playwright of this age, is to a large extent a reworking of Jonson's <i>Epicoene</i>. In the eighteenth century Jonson's status began to decline. In the Romantic era, Jonson suffered the fate of being unfairly compared and contrasted to Shakespeare, as the taste for Jonson's type of satirical comedy decreased. Jonson was at times appreciated by the Romantics, but overall he was denigrated for not writing in a Shakespearean vein. In the twentieth century, Jonson's status rose significantly.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/n/Ben_Jonson_6db2.html" title="Edit section: Drama">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Drama</span></h2>
<p>As G. E. Bentley compellingly argues in <i>Shakespeare and Jonson: Their Reputations in the Seventeenth Century Compared</i>, Jonson was more respected and more influential than Shakespeare in the seventeenth century. After the English theatres were reopened on the <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_Restoration_df9a.html" title="English Restoration">Restoration</a> of <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_II_of_England_f8dd.html" title="Charles II of England">Charles II</a>, Jonson's work, along with Shakespeare's and <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Fletcher_%28playwright%29_50c2.html" title="John Fletcher (playwright)">Fletcher</a>'s work, formed the initial core of the Restoration repertory. It was not until after 1710 that Shakespeare's plays (ordinarily in heavily revised forms) were more frequently performed than those of his Renaissance contemporaries. Many critics since the eighteenth century have ranked Jonson below only Shakespeare among English Renaissance dramatists. Critical judgment has tended to emphasize the very qualities that Jonson himself lauds in his prefaces, in Timber, and in his scattered prefaces and dedications: the realism and propriety of his language, the bite of his satire, and the care with which he plotted his comedies. For some critics, the temptation to contrast Jonson (representing art or craft) with Shakespeare (representing nature, or untutored genius) has seemed natural; Jonson himself may be said to initiate this interpretation in his poem on Shakespeare.</p>
<p><a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Dryden_c542.html" title="John Dryden">John Dryden</a> offered a similar assessment in the Essay of Dramatic Poesie, when he has his avatar Neander compare Shakespeare to <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homer.html" title="Homer">Homer</a> and Jonson to <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virgil.html" title="Virgil">Virgil</a>: the former represented profound creativity, the latter polished artifice. But "artifice" was in the seventeenth century almost synonymous with "art"; Jonson, for instance, used "artificer" as a synonym for "artist" (<i>Discoveries,</i> 33). For Lewis Theobald, too, Jonson “ow[ed] all his Excellence to his Art,” in contrast to Shakespeare, the natural genius. A consensus had seened to have formed: Jonson was the first English poet to understand classical precepts with much accuracy, and he was the first to apply those precepts successfully to contemporary life. But there were also more negative spins on Jonson's learned art; for instance, in the 1750s, <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_Young_168d.html" title="Edward Young">Edward Young</a> casually remarked on the way in which Jonson’s learning worked, like Samson’s strength, to his own detriment.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../r/o/m/Romanticism.html" title="Romanticism">romantic</a> revolution in criticism brought about an overall decline in the critical estimation of Jonson. Hazlitt refers dismissively to Jonson’s “laborious caution.” Coleridge, while more respectful, describes Jonson as psychologically superficial: “He was a very accurately observing man; but he cared only to observe what was open to, and likely to impress, the senses.” Coleridge placed Jonson second only to Shakespeare; other romantic critics were less approving. The early nineteenth century was the great age for recovering Renaissance drama. Jonson, whose reputation had survived, appears to have been less interesting to some readers than writers such as Middleton or Heywood, who were in some senses “discoveries” of the nineteenth century. Moreover, the emphasis the romantic writers placed on imagination, and their concomitant tendency to distrust studied art, lowered Jonson's status, if it also sharpened their awareness of the difference traditionally noted between Jonson and Shakespeare. This trend was by no means universal, however; <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Gifford_4bfb.html" title="William Gifford">William Gifford</a>, Jonson's first editor of the nineteenth century, did a great deal to defend Jonson's reputation during this period of general decline. In the next era Swinburne, who was more interested in Jonson than most Victorians, wrote, “The flowers of his growing have every quality but one which belongs to the rarest and finest among flowers: they have colour, form, variety, fertility, vigour: the one thing they want is fragrance”—by “fragrance,” Swinburne means spontaneity.</p>
<p>In the twentieth century, Jonson’s body of work has been subject to a more varied set of analyses, broadly consistent with the interests and programs of modern literary criticism. In an essay printed in <i>The Sacred Wood</i> T.S. Eliot attempts to repudiate the charge that Jonson was an arid classicist by analyzing the role of imagination in his dialogue. Eliot was appreciative of Jonson's overall conception and his "surface," a view consonant with the modernist reaction against Romantic criticism, which tended to denigrate playwrights who did not concentrate on representations of psychological depth. Around mid-century, a number of critics and scholars followed Eliot’s lead, producing detailed studies of Jonson’s verbal style. At the same time, study of Elizabethan themes and conventions, such as those by E.E. Stoll and <a href="../../../m/2E/_/M._C._Bradbrook_050c.html" title="M. C. Bradbrook">M. C. Bradbrook</a>, provided a more vivid sense of how Jonson’s work was shaped by the expectations of his time.</p>
<p>The proliferation of new critical perspectives after mid-century touched on Jonson inconsistently. Jonas Barish was the leading figure in a group of critics that was appreciative of Jonson's artistry. On the other hand, Jonson received less attention from the new critics than did some other playwrights and his work was not of programmatic interest to psychoanalytic critics. But Jonson’s career eventually made him a focal point for the revived <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Historicism_ffd6.html" title="New Historicism">sociopolitical criticism</a>. Jonson’s work, particularly his masques and pageants, offers significant information regarding the relations of literary production and political power, as do his contacts with and poems for aristocratic patrons; moreover, his career at the center of London’s emerging literary world has been seen as exemplifying the development of a fully commodified literary culture. In this respect, Jonson has been seen as a transitional figure, an author whose skills and ambition led him to a leading role both in the declining culture of patronage and in the rising culture of mass consumption.</p>

<p>If Jonson's reputation as a playwright has traditionally been linked to Shakespeare, his reputation as a poet has, since the early twentieth century, been linked to that of <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Donne_3c1c.html" title="John Donne">John Donne</a>. In this comparison, Jonson represents the <a href="../../../c/a/v/Cavalier_poet.html" title="Cavalier poet">cavalier</a> strain of poetry, which emphasized grace and clarity of expression; Donne, by contrast, epitomized the <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metaphysical_poets.html" title="Metaphysical poets">metaphysical</a> school of poetry, with its reliance on strained, <a href="../../../b/a/r/Baroque.html" title="Baroque">baroque</a> metaphors and often vague phrasing. Since the critics who made this comparison (<a href="../../../h/e/r/Herbert_Grierson_e57d.html" title="Herbert Grierson">Herbert Grierson</a> for example), were to varying extents rediscovering Donne, this comparison often worked to the detriment of Jonson's reputation.</p>
<p>The grounds for describing Jonson as the "father" of cavalier poets are clear: many of the cavalier poets described themselves as his "sons" or his "tribe." For some of this tribe, the connection was as much social as poetic; Herrick describes meetings at "the Sun, the Dog, the Triple Tunne." All of them, including those like Herrick whose accomplishments in verse are generally regarded as superior to Jonson's, took inspiration from Jonson's revival of classical forms and themes, his subtle melodies, and his disciplined use of <a href="../../../w/i/t/Wit.html" title="Wit">wit</a>. In all of these respects, Jonson may be regarded as among the most important figures in the prehistory of English <a href="../../../a/u/g/Augustan_literature.html" title="Augustan literature">neoclassicism</a>.</p>
<p>Jonson's poetry continues to interest scholars for the light it sheds on English literary history, particularly as regards politics, systems of patronage, and intellectual attitudes. For the general reader, Jonson's reputation rests on a few lyrics that, though brief, are surpassed for grace and precision by very few Renaissance poems: "On My First Son"; "To Celia"; "Drink to Me Only With Thine Eyes"; the poem on Penshurst; and the epitaph on <a href="../../../b/o/y/Boy_player.html" title="Boy player">boy player</a> Solomon Pavy.</p>

<p>As with other English Renaissance dramatists, a portion of Ben Jonson's literary output has not survived. In addition to <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Isle_of_Dogs_%28play%29_92da.html" title="The Isle of Dogs (play)">The Isle of Dogs</a></i> (1597), the records suggest these lost plays as wholly or partially Jonson's work: <i>Richard Crookback</i> (1602); <i>Hot Anger Soon Cold</i> (1598), with Porter and <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_Chettle_0068.html" title="Henry Chettle">Henry Chettle</a>; <i>Page of Plymouth</i> (1599), with Dekker; and <i>Robert II, King of Scots</i> (1599), with Chettle and Dekker. Several of Jonson's masques and entertainments also are not extant: <i>The Entertainment at Merchant Taylors</i> (1607); <i>The Entertainment at Salisbury House for James I</i> (1608); <i>The Entertainment at Britain's Burse for James I</i> (1609); and <i>The May Lord</i> (1613-19).</p>
<p>Finally, there are questionable or borderline attributions. Jonson may have had a hand in <i><a href="../../../r/o/l/Rollo_Duke_of_Normandy_d789.html" title="Rollo Duke of Normandy">Rollo, Duke of Normandy, or The Bloody Brother</a></i>, a play in the canon of <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Fletcher_03d4.html" title="John Fletcher">John Fletcher</a> and his collaborators.The comedy <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Widow_%28play%29_344b.html" title="The Widow (play)">The Widow</a></i> was printed in 1652 as the work of <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Middleton_4ab2.html" title="Thomas Middleton">Thomas Middleton</a>, Fletcher and Jonson, though scholars have been intensely skeptical about Jonson's presence in the play. A few attributions of anonymous plays, like <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_London_Prodigal_7349.html" title="The London Prodigal">The London Prodigal</a>,</i> have been ventured by individual researchers, but have met with cool responses.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
