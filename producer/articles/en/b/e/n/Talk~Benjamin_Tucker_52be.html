<p>The article says: "<i>Gary Elkin writes in Benjamin Tucker - Anarchist or capitalist?, "Tucker advocated *possession* but not private property, believing that empty land, houses, etc. should be squatted. He considered private property in land use (which he called the "land monopoly") as one of the four great evils of capitalism.</i>" Who is this Gary Elkin guy? Is he a reputable source? It's true that Tucker supports open access to unused land because land itself is not the product of labor and can therefore not be property, but I've never seen Tucker say anything about squatting in buildings. I would imagine, given my understanding of the individualists, that even a squatter would have to pay the owner of the building for the upkeep (without profiting the owner). <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 04:36, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I don't see how you can say your source is better than An Anarchist FAQ.</p>
<p><i>Tucker believd in "private property as a necessary requirement for human liberty and progress."</i> - this makes it seem like Tucker believe in the modern concept of private property. As the source explains, "According to his philosophy, there were only certain legitimate means of obtaining title to property: commerce, gift, or inheritance." -- <a href="../../../i/n/f/User%7EInfinity0_7a16.html" title="User:Infinity0">infinity</a><b><a href="../../../i/n/f/User_talk%7EInfinity0_df0a.html" title="User talk:Infinity0">0</a></b> 16:02, 11 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That's the modern conception of private property. It's not your property if you steal it. "Anarchist FAQ" is garbage. They have no clue what they're talking about.

<dd>It's credible because it's published (<a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 1 85637 549 8</a>) and sourced. How am I supposed to know who reads it?

<dd>Yeah right. Going to be published is not good enough. Tucker's property is protected as well, by PRIVATE defense.

<dd>It's not a conspiracy. It's just natural to want to only see what one wants to see and to block out everything else, and to want others to have the same vision as yourself. The good thing about Wikipedia is, unlike the "Anarchist FAQ", is that there's not an overseeing hierarchy regulating what information is going to be in the text. So, on Wikipedia, you're not going to get the "official" version of anarchism. "Anarchist FAQ" cannot be trusted in any way, shape, or form. It's shoddy work and not a credible source. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 22:22, 11 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This article is a great parody of libertarian socilists ideas. Is totally USA-centric. A pro-think tank straw man vision of "socialism". Is terrible this... Private propierty&#160;!= possesion. Individual possesion of means of production&#160;!= private propierty of means or production. Individual possesion of means of production is another form of common property.

<dd>Not true. Tucker did not support private "possession", as opposed to private property, in anything other than land (and maybe houses - I'm not sure on the latter). Everything else was private property. For example, if I decided to stop using my computer, it would still continue to be mine. But, if I stopped using my land then according to him it wouldn't be mine anymore. As far as common property, Tucker never advocated such a thing. By "worker's self-management" I assume you mean some kind of collective ownership, but Tucker never advocated such a thing. Note that Proudhon's mutualism is not the same as Tucker's.<a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnarcho-capitalism_c3e2.html" title="User:Anarcho-capitalism">Anarcho-capitalism</a></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I think you have a bad interpretation about mutualism. By worker's self-management I mean an enterprise that is not owned by a capitalist. I mean a enterprise than is owned for a worker. For instance a cooperative is a self-management with collective ownership of means of production but an artisan or freelancer has an individual enterprise and there is self-management there too. But in this case there is not collective ownership. Excuse my very bad English. --83.97.229.194 20:22, 18 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Tucker did not oppose someone owning a business and hiring employees. He supported the right of an individual to own a means of production and work it himself, as well as the right of him to hire others to work it that don't own a means of production. I don't know what you are calling "mutualism," but you can't equate Proudhon's mutualism with Tucker's philosophy. They're two different things. As far as cooperatives, Tucker never advocated cooperatives if you mean that to be collective ownership.<a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnarcho-capitalism_c3e2.html" title="User:Anarcho-capitalism">Anarcho-capitalism</a> 20:27, 18 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I think Proudhon did not oppose someone owning a business and hiring employees too. But Tucker and Proudhon oposse landauders and rentits, and adovacte a more artisan model that industrial capitalism. Cooperative system as modern <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_economy.html" title="Social economy">social economy</a>, is a logic conclusion in the development of an artisan system. --83.97.230.132 12:44, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Libertatia, you added this: "Principles such as "equal liberty" and "occupancy and use," taken out of the realm of "natural law," could then be rethought as examples of a species of "generally trustworthy guiding principle of action," derived from the two fundamental rights." That appears to contradict Tucker saying "Man's only right to land is his might over it." Can you supply the full quote here? Also, you took out my statement that "pain" applied to the person acting. It looks like you are taking "aggregate pain" to mean multiple people. I don't see that in that quote. I think he's talking about "total of pain" to the actor. If Tucker was a true Egoist, then the only pain that matters ultimately is one's own pain. Egoism is not utilitarianism.<a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnarcho-capitalism_c3e2.html" title="User:Anarcho-capitalism">Anarcho-capitalism</a> 03:01, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Tucker <i>actually</i> insisted that he had always based "equal liberty" in the dynamic of "the right of contract" limiting "the right of might." (I can go back and find <i>that</i> quote, but it will have to be tomorrow.) Tucker's debt to Stirner was primarily a matter of repudiating "spooks" such as natural law. I'll scan those full texts when I get a chance, but there's nothing hard here. Tucker maintains his advocacy of "equal liberty" and "occupancy and use" long after his assertion of the "two rights" already quoted. He simply refuses to consider them laws, although they are dependable guidelines. When he talks about minimizing pain and "aggregate pain," it is in the midst of a scenario where individual houses might, he says, be blown up in order to prevent a city from burning down. Perhaps Tucker is not a "true Egoist," by your definition. It's likely that Stirner wasn't either. In any event, Tucker is obviously concerned with more than just the individual ego of some atomistic individual. <a href="../../../l/i/b/User%7ELibertatia_2991.html" title="User:Libertatia">Libertatia</a> 17:26, 23 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Stirner was most definitely an Egoist. Utilitarianism is not egoistic. Utilitarianism says to maximize good consequences for a population as a whole. A Egoist does and advocates whatever maximizes good consequences for himself. From the quotes you're giving me, it's not clear whether Tucker was a utilitarian or an Egoist. A utilitarian would do what is "for the good of society" as an end in itself. An Egoist would do what is good for society, if and only if, doing what is good for society is good for oneself - which would also mean that an Egoist would just as easily do what is bad for society if doing that which is bad for society is good for oneself.<a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnarcho-capitalism_c3e2.html" title="User:Anarcho-capitalism">Anarcho-capitalism</a> 04:01, 26 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>With Tucker, it is clear that he understands individuals as more than just social atoms, and individual choices as always already <i>in society</i>. You apparently oppose "society" to the individuals who participate in it. The content of egoism is <i>obviously</i> going to reflect the individual's sense of the relation of the ego to others. Tucker was consistently concerned with "equal liberty" as a model for maximizing individual "goods" in society. This is a position that can be derived from any number of starting points, egoism among them. <a href="../../../l/i/b/User%7ELibertatia_2991.html" title="User:Libertatia">Libertatia</a> 18:09, 26 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>There is a difference between advocating equal liberty as a deontological ethic and advocating it as a general rule that would be broken if, and when, it was good, in a consequential sense, to do so - in other words, rule consequentialism. If one is an Egoist then ulitmately the only consequences that matter are the consequences to the self. If one is a utilitarian then the consequences that are important are those to all individuals. In other words, utilitarians see the the maximization of happiness for all individuals summed together as the ultimate end, while a Egoist, while he may seek the happiness of others for purposes of instrumentality, he only seeks it insofar as it maximizes his own happiness, with his own happiness being his ultimate end. While it's clear that Tucker became a consequentialist, it's not clear from your quotes whether that consequentialism is egoistic or utilitarian, but you seem to think he was a utilitarian. That contradicts things written about him saying that he converted to Egoism. Stirner was definitely not a utilitarian but an egoist.<a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnarcho-capitalism_c3e2.html" title="User:Anarcho-capitalism">Anarcho-capitalism</a> 18:41, 26 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Save the lectures, particularly when they're beside the point. I believe that Tucker was a consistent egoist, following Stirner's example of pursuing one's own concerns above all abstractions (including "society"). He was not, however, a <i>naive</i> egoist, and thus understood his own concerns as necessarily bound up with others. For that reason, the shift to egoism had little or no practical effect on his concern with equal liberty. He would continue to promote the "golden rule" (Proudhon's basic mutualist principle) as long as <i>Liberty</i> was published. A <i>naive egoist</i>, pretending some complete separation from "society" would, 1) probably be, in Stirner's terms, possessed by a "spook" (or three), and 2) would cease to be an anarchist, having no objection to rulers, but only to being ruled. Among the other <i>Liberty</i> egoist, James L. Walker (Tak Kak), held a very complex view, the core of which was the definition: "Egoism is (1) the theory of will as reaction of the self to a motive; (2) every such reaction in fact." He challenged simple oppositions between egoism and altruism. John Badcock's approach is similar. <a href="../../../l/i/b/User%7ELibertatia_2991.html" title="User:Libertatia">Libertatia</a> 19:26, 26 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I'm sorry but I have to give these lectures because you don't appear to understand that subjects and concepts we're dealing with. In order for us to communicate we have to speak the same language. But of course an Egoist would see his own concerns "bound up with others." That's what I've been saying. An Egoist is going to use any tool at his disposal to maximize his self-interest, whether it's benefitting or harming others and whether it's advocating "general," though not inviolable, principles. Tucker appears to think the happiness of others is of concern, but you appear to think that he's a utilitarian rather than an Egoist. A utilitarian is concerned with the "aggregate pain" of all individuals summed, but an egoist is concerned with the "aggregate pain" to himself. And, Egoists have no "golden rule." They have no morality, period. There is no wrong or right. There is simply what works to maximize self-interest. If Tucker advocated "equal liberty" as an Egoist, it was not in a deontological sense but as a sort of weak rule consequentialism (equal liberty could be violated in order to relieve "pain."). There would be no "law" of equal liberty for Tucker anymore, but a "general principle" that he is going to advocate to be self-serving that he will violate on occasion.<a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnarcho-capitalism_c3e2.html" title="User:Anarcho-capitalism">Anarcho-capitalism</a> 19:41, 26 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>You would be better off responding to what's actually said, methinks. I have, from the beginning of this thread, argued that Tucker was concerned only with "dependable guidelines," and that, in fact, he argued that this had been his position right along. When you say that "egoists have no 'golden rule'" you're either 1) attributing some status other than "dependable guideline" to that principle, in which case your comments are beside the point, or 2) you're simply wrong, as relates to the case in question, since Tucker made a point of defending the "golden rule" in the sense of "dependable guideline" as late as 1907. <i>You</i> have bring up "utilitarianism" and "morality" into the thread, and to the extent that those are your concerns, you're merely arguing against a straw man of your own construction. There is, of course, no "if" about Tucker's advocacy of equal liberty in the egoist period. The proof is right there in his writings. And there is simply <b>no question</b> of Tucker, or any of the <i>Liberty</i> egoists, applying a <i>deontological</i> ethics. As for "aggregate pain," the notion of "my 'aggregate pain'" is, frankly, a silly one, which is only necessary to someone who considers the pain of others absolutely <i>not their concern</i>. <a href="../../../l/i/b/User%7ELibertatia_2991.html" title="User:Libertatia">Libertatia</a> 20:26, 26 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>A "golden rule" would be a deontological principle. A rule that may be violated if violating decreases pain would not be a golden rule but a consequentialist "general principle." There is no such thing as a "golden rule" that says "do not aggress against others unless it causes less pain to oneself to do otherwise," because when you're doing otherwise you're aggressing against someone else. That is not equal liberty. Yes, the proof is right there in his writings. There is no golden rule against invasion. He explicitly says that he would violate the rule when the occasion calls for it.<a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnarcho-capitalism_c3e2.html" title="User:Anarcho-capitalism">Anarcho-capitalism</a> 20:30, 26 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Just because <i>you</i> cannot conceive of a "golden rule" as a "general principle" doesn't mean Tucker couldn't. Our only concern here is Tucker's understanding of matters. <a href="../../../l/i/b/User%7ELibertatia_2991.html" title="User:Libertatia">Libertatia</a> 20:42, 26 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Do you understand what a rule is? It's something one is not supposed to violate. If it's permissible to violate the "rule" whenever it conflicts with minimizing "pain," then it's not a rule at all. The rule would actually be to minimize pain.<a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnarcho-capitalism_c3e2.html" title="User:Anarcho-capitalism">Anarcho-capitalism</a> 00:21, 27 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>You have never heard of a "rule of thumb," for instance? Wouldn't it be simpler to talk about what the "golden rule" actually says, and what Tucker was defending, rather than deciding what its character is on the basis of the name?
<dl>
<dd>A "rule of thumb" isn't a real rule. It's just a general principle, that if you follow, it usually works to achieve what you want. Sometimes it doesn't achieve what you want so you don't abide by it on those occasions. The only rule of Egoists, is self-interest. And, consistent with self-interest is to come up with general principles, or "rules of thumb" in order to lessen the load of making calculations to see what works and what doesn't for each and every circumstance.<a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnarcho-capitalism_c3e2.html" title="User:Anarcho-capitalism">Anarcho-capitalism</a> 00:38, 27 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>But you don't like the sound of a "golden rule," so it <i>must</i> be a "real rule"? No matter what Tucker or I actually say about it? Give me a break! <a href="../../../l/i/b/User%7ELibertatia_2991.html" title="User:Libertatia">Libertatia</a> 01:00, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>From Tucker, "Land Tenure Again":</p>
<ul>
<li>"If Mr. Byington believes that the minimum of invasion is always desirable, I summon his to deal specifically with the case cited by me in my discusion with Mr. Yarros in No. 310,—the case, that is, of a burning city which can be saved from total destruction only by blowing up the houses on a strip of territory inhabited by non-invasive persons who refuse their consent to such disposition of their property. . . . I hold, then, to my claim that occupancy and use as the title to land is not vitiated by the fact that it is a rule which, like all others, must be sometimes trodden underfoot."</li>
</ul>
<p>From Tucker, "The Land Occupancy Problem" (<i>Liberty</i>, Mar 9, 1895, p. 2.)</p>
<ul>
<li>"...courts, even in an Egoistic community, will not decide against liberty, however great the emergency, unless such a decision would be for the good of society.... I have not hinted that any non-invasive occupant should be ousted, except in an emergency where imperative social necessity commands it." Seems to me you're jumping at shadows. <a href="../../../l/i/b/User%7ELibertatia_2991.html" title="User:Libertatia">Libertatia</a> 00:36, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>The debate with Yarros and Byington was long-running, and Tucker left little question what his position was. <a href="../../../l/i/b/User%7ELibertatia_2991.html" title="User:Libertatia">Libertatia</a> 18:25, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
