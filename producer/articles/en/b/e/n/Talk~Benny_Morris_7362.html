There is sort of a contradiction in the article: First it states that Morris showed that "700,000 Palestinians who fled from their homes in 1947 were not dispelled with premeditation on the part of the Israelis [...] "&#160;; but then the excerpts from the interview show that he changed his mind about this (atrocities part of conscious strategy). When and why did he change his mind? Since it's such a crucial question, it would be great to have more info on this. <a href="../../../p/i/r/User%7EPir_346c.html" title="User:Pir">pir</a> 22:43, 8 Feb 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Good observation. First, as both Norman Finkelstein and Edward Said have pointed out, he appears to not been willing to come to this conclusion in the first edition of <i>The Birth of the Palestinian Refugee Problem</i> despite the fact the evidence suggested it. Second, he appears to have found additional material that was previously unavailable to confirm that in fact that expulsion was in fact premeditated. Indeed the article should be updated to reflect this. -- <a href="../../../v/i/a/User%7EViajero_f80c.html" title="User:Viajero">Viajero</a> 22:59, 8 Feb 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't know how valuable a response will be two years later, but the gist of his argument is this: yes: there was considerable discussion in Zionist (and other) circles of "transfer" (whether voluntary or compulsory) of Arab populations, before the outbreak of the war; but no: there was no "plan". The actual expulsions were not part of a comprehensive preexisting plan, but arose by and large <i>ad hoc</i> out of the military situation as it evolved during the course of the war. So, essentially, while many Zionist leaders recognized that the presence of large Arab populations would imperil Israel's ability to exist as a Jewish state, and "transfer" was regarded as desirable, there was no Zionist consensus about whether it needed to be accomplished or, among those who advocated "transfer," how it ought to be accomplished: by purchasing of Arab lands, or by agreements reached with neighboring Arab states to accept transferees, or by outright expropriation and forcible expulsion and so forth. When expulsion did take place -- and arguing that most refugees were actually driven out was what was novel, at least for an Israeli historian, about <i>The Birth of the Palestinian Refugee Problem</i> -- it was not part of a comprehensive strategy but grew out of events -- often, for instance, as local retaliation for attacks on Yishuv interests. For example, a Yishuv convoy or Jewish civilians are attacked on a road, and the Haganah (or, often, the Irgun or the IPA) attacks the village from which the attack came and drives out its inhabitants.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>In short, there was a widespread desire to have Arab populations move elsewhere, but that desire had not hardened into policy (not because it wouldn't have, but because circumstances overtook would-be policymakers), and in the absence of a policy, there certainly was no plan. So, essentially there is no contradiction between saying that Arab populations were driven out and that driving them out was not part of a comprehensive plan.</dd>

<dd>I should add that I'm not making any representations about the truth of these claims -- I mean only that this is the crux of Morris' argument.

<dd><b>I don't object to anything you've said</b> - in fact I agree with near enough every word of it. The Zionists of 1948 didn't set out to ethnically cleanse a considerable swathe of Palestine (not least because it would have impacted most of their own 2nd-class workers, neighbours etc).</dd>
<dd>But the whole Zionist enterprise was based on this expulsion. There are too many clips to know where to start, they include David Ben-Gurion, the "dove" whose reputation they fought to protect for so long.</dd>
<dd>Have you seen what Morris says <sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> <i>"For decades the Zionists tried to camouflage their real aspirations, for fear of angering the authorities and the Arabs. They were, however, certain of their aims and of the means needed to achieve them. Internal correspondence amongst the olim from the very beginning of the Zionist enterprise leaves little room for doubt"</i>. The letters he quotes come from 1882, almost 125 years ago.</dd>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>"There are circumstances in history that justify ethnic cleansing. I know that this term is completely negative in the discourse of the 21st century, but when the choice is between ethnic cleansing and genocide - the annihilation of your people - I prefer ethnic cleansing."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>And that was the situation in 1948?</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>"That was the situation. That is what Zionism faced. A Jewish state would not have come into being without the uprooting of 700,000 Palestinians. Therefore it was necessary to uproot them. There was no choice but to expel that population. It was necessary to cleanse the hinterland and cleanse the border areas and cleanse the main roads. It was necessary to cleanse the villages from which our convoys and our settlements were fired on."</dd>

<p>loss of faith in Oslo: left wing or right wing?</p>
<p>44% of all Israelis support the Oslo Accords in any form....Benny Morris is among the 29% that have changed their position from support the Accords to not support the Accords. The center of Israeli society has moved from supporting to not supporting. Furthermore 80% of all Israelis believe that the IDF has successfully dealt with the violence militarily. <a href="http://spirit.tau.ac.il/socant/peace/peaceindex/2000/data/may2000d.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://spirit.tau.ac.il/socant/peace/peaceindex/2000/data/may2000d.pdf" rel="nofollow">[2]</a><a href="http://spirit.tau.ac.il/socant/peace/peaceindex/2004/data/may2004d.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://spirit.tau.ac.il/socant/peace/peaceindex/2004/data/may2004d.pdf" rel="nofollow">[3]</a></p>

<p>POV edits (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Benny_Morris&amp;diff=0&amp;oldid=6345578" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Benny_Morris&amp;diff=0&amp;oldid=6345578" rel="nofollow">Diff</a>), but some worthwhile material for the article. Points:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is obviously POV to regard Karsh's attack on Morris as "proven", etc.</li>
<li>The link provided <a href="http://emperors-clothes.com/docs/karsh-morris.htm" class="external free" title="http://emperors-clothes.com/docs/karsh-morris.htm" rel="nofollow">http://emperors-clothes.com/docs/karsh-morris.htm</a> is broken. I've tried the usual google trickery to find it but with no success (eg. no hits for inurl:karsh-morris). Shame it's not possible to contact 24.60.142.49 to find out.</li>
<li>I've added a link to Finkelstein's criticism of Morris that I've been meaning to add for a while.</li>
<li>Most of the content of this article is a series of quotes, which is not really Wikipedia house style. I've put these in a separate section.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hopefully these changes improve the article... ---- <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChalst_cb81.html" title="User:Chalst">Charles Stewart</a> 13:47, 5 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The emperors-clothes article, in which Karsh is said to have attacked Morris, is probably the one currently at <a href="http://emperors-clothes.com/israel/karsh-occ.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://emperors-clothes.com/israel/karsh-occ.htm" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>. The article referenced there is probably this one: <a href="http://www.israelnationalnews.com/article.php3?id=3409" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.israelnationalnews.com/article.php3?id=3409" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>. There's no "evidence" in either article, and I can't imagine anyone would take them very seriously. However, if you drill down still further, you finally get to this: <a href="http://www.meforum.org/article/466" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.meforum.org/article/466" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>, which is not by Karsh but by Jared Israel. So emperor-clothes is actually quoting themselves! The "ME Forum" article appears to contain some meat - but it's published in Arutz Sheva, a source one would have to call "very biased". Next to the article is written: "Jared Israel is the Editor of the Emperor's New Clothes website, dedicated to fully documented investigative journalism". <a href="../../../p/a/l/User%7EPalestineRemembered_d4da.html" title="User:PalestineRemembered">PalestineRemembered</a> 19:49, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hey, I miss som basics here, like; WHEN was he born? Also, some more background (e.g. where was he educated (before Cambridge)) would have been nice. If anyone can contribute on these points it would be appriciated. Thanks! <a href="../../../h/u/l/User%7EHuldra_dadc.html" title="User:Huldra">Huldra</a> 03:48, 15 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>-Also; what year did he recieve his doctorate from Cambridge? Ok, he is currently professor at Ben-Gurion, -but what about his academic posts before this? -In general: as the article stands now it is a (very interesting! IMO) insight into his point of view, but I really miss the basic (&amp; I assume: undisputed!) information/facts that should be a part of any dictionary entry on a person. I hope somebody out there can contribute on this. Regards, <a href="../../../h/u/l/User%7EHuldra_dadc.html" title="User:Huldra">Huldra</a> 18:12, 15 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I've seen an allegation somewhere in here that "Benny Morris was proved to have lied in court". I can find no evidence whatsoever for this, and I imagine it's just another smear from the Zionists (even though Morris is one of their own!).</dd>
<dd>However, on the wider point of his personal details, it is quite possible that he has to be very careful (like me). I'm almost tempted to take his picture off this article.</dd>

<p>Needs more info on his life, versus his views. The quotes section needs to be trimmed.

<p>I've added "Citation needed" because I don't recall Benny Morris talking about or implying "politicized, armed community". As best I recall, attacks on the Zionists were largely criminal in nature. Even when "organised" opposition arrived (in 1936, less so in 1948), the individuals regularily robbed the Arabs they were staying amongst. <a href="../../../p/a/l/User%7EPalestineRemembered_d4da.html" title="User:PalestineRemembered">PalestineRemembered</a> 17:36, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I keep getting my posts undone in the 'Criticism of Morris' section: the reasons given are patently wrong. 'Original Research' was the last reason, which is absurd since I simply cite a paper from the respected Journal of Palestine Studies. This is hardly me coming up with my own unpublished research to pass off as 'Criticism of Morris'. I had a look at the 'Original Research' definition (I'm new to Wikipedia): "That is, any facts, opinions, interpretations, definitions, and arguments published by Wikipedia must already have been published by a reliable publication in relation to the topic of the article."</p>
<p>MUST HAVE ALREADY BEEN PUBLISHED BY A RELIABLE PUBLICATION TO THE TOPIC OF THE ARTICLE: The Journal of Palestine certainly counts as a reliable publication and EXPLICITLY mentions Morris. One of the people who undoes my changes was threatened with a ban because of posting defamatory material against the person I cite, Ilan Pappe. 86.145.179.1 01:32, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</p>
