<p>Hi, I was just wondering if you could help me with a problem i have. I'm a 3rd year chemist and i'm trying to do a project that involves the mechanism of nitrosation of secondary amines by the nitrosonium cation. Don't suppose you know the mechanism for the reaction do you (arrow pushing organic mechanism, not the kinetic mechanism). Thanks Sameyley 15:01, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Hi Sam. I assume the reaction you're studying is <a href="../../../s/e/c/Secondary_amine.html" title="Secondary amine">secondary amine</a> + <a href="../../../n/i/t/Nitrosonium.html" title="Nitrosonium">nitrosonium</a> → <a href="../../../n/i/t/Nitrosamine.html" title="Nitrosamine">nitrosamine</a> + <a href="../../../p/r/o/Proton.html" title="Proton">proton</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>R<sub>2</sub>NH + NO<sup>+</sup> → R<sub>2</sub>NNO + H<sup>+</sup></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I would imagine the mechanism is similar to that for <a href="../../../d/i/a/Diazotisation.html" title="Diazotisation">diazotisation</a>, but because the amine is seconary, it cannot tautomerise and go on to form a diazonium compound.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>A mechanism for diazotisation is here: <a href="http://www.organic-chemistry.org/frames.htm?http://www.organic-chemistry.org/namedreactions/diazotisation.shtm" class="external free" title="http://www.organic-chemistry.org/frames.htm?http://www.organic-chemistry.org/namedreactions/diazotisation.shtm" rel="nofollow">http://www.organic-chemistry.org/frames.htm?http://www.organic-chemistry.org/namedreactions/diazotisation.shtm</a></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Here's a 1977 paper on the nitrosation of secondary amines: <a href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/u15h802n68622117/" class="external free" title="http://www.springerlink.com/content/u15h802n68622117/" rel="nofollow">http://www.springerlink.com/content/u15h802n68622117/</a></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Hopefully you can access that through your university network or with a password from the departmental library.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Any further problems, just leave another message here.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Good luck!</dd>

<dd>Thanks, that was very helpful, that was the reaction mechanism that i had assumed, i was just struggling to find anything to back it up. Thanks for your help. Sameyley 17:08, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi. I am a <a href="../../../b/o/t/Wikipedia%7EBots_fd71.html" title="Wikipedia:Bots">bot</a>, and I am writing to you with a request. I would like to ask you, if possible, to use <a href="../../../e/d/i/Edit_summaries.html" title="Edit summaries">edit summaries</a> a bit more often when you contribute. The reason an edit summary is important is because it allows your fellow contributors to understand what you changed; you can think of it as the "Subject:" line in an email. For your information, your current edit summary usage is 2% for major edits and 100% for minor edits. (Based on the last 130 major and 1 minor edits in the article namespace.)</p>
<p>This is just a suggestion, and I hope that I did not appear impolite. You do not need to reply to this message, but if you would like to give me feedback, you can do so at the <a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMathbot_Feedback_on_the_summary_bot_b1e3.html" title="User talk:Mathbot/Feedback on the summary bot">feedback page</a>.

<dd>Hi Smokefoot. I'll definitely get some images done for those articles. As for uploading images from ChemDraw, I copy the structure I've drawn in ChemDraw to the clipboard. Then I open Photoshop and paste it into a blank document. Then I save the image as a hi-resolution PNG. I think there are other programs available free if you don't have access to a version of Photoshop. Hope this is helpful. I can give you more detailed instructions if you'd like. Cheers. Ben.</dd>

<dd>Ben - nice stuff. BTW, for <a href="../../../c/a/c/Cacodylic_acid.html" title="Cacodylic acid">cacodylic acid</a>, it's tetrahedral (like most 4-coordinate main group things lacking lone pairs), so you could still more accurately represent it by modifying say AsH3, replacing l.p. with =O, 2xH with Me's and one H with OH. I dont know the structural details, but to the extent that anyone looks up cacodylic acid, we dont want them thinking it's planar. I understand if you dont have time for this.--<a href="../../../s/m/o/User%7ESmokefoot_834e.html" title="User:Smokefoot">Smokefoot</a> 21:55, 19 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Ben. I see you have uploaded new "high resolution" images for the amino acids and have replaced the old structural ones with them. First - i didn't like the old images too much either, but you can't wipe out someone's contribution just b/c you don't like their style, an edit is suposed to improve the article - yours don't - in fact they worsen it b/c the images you have removed and the color ones next to them were sets - they both had similar spatial position of the atoms, well not anymore. Another thing is the size of your images - ~ 20K, for the ~3K the old ones have. That's too much for a simple structure such as an amino acid. Now if you want to draw images there is plenty for you to do, just check <a href="../../../c/h/e/Category%7EChemistry_stubs_8634.html" title="Category:Chemistry stubs">Category:Chemistry_stubs</a>, <a href="../../../p/h/a/Category%7EPharmacology_stubs_a51d.html" title="Category:Pharmacology stubs">Category:Pharmacology_stubs</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_organic_compounds.html" title="List of organic compounds">List of organic compounds</a>. I suggest that you take a <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=mesh&amp;list_uids=68009930&amp;dopt=Full" class="external text" title="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=mesh&amp;list_uids=68009930&amp;dopt=Full" rel="nofollow">sub class</a> of similar structures that noone has worked on it yet, this way all the images in that sub-class will have the same style - see the bile pigments <a href="../../../b/i/l/Biliverdin.html" title="Biliverdin">Biliverdin</a>, <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bilirubin.html" title="Bilirubin">Bilirubin</a>, <a href="../../../u/r/o/Urobilin.html" title="Urobilin">Urobilin</a> and <a href="../../../u/r/o/Urobilinogen.html" title="Urobilinogen">Urobilinogen</a>. -- <a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBorisTM_14b1.html" title="User:BorisTM">Boris</a> 04:56, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi Boris - sorry you didn't like my updates. You're right - my skeletal structures for amino acids do not coincide with <a href="../../../m/s/t/User%7EMstroeck_3315.html" title="User:Mstroeck">Michael Ströck</a>'s 3D ones. However, I think having a skeletal structure is a lot neater and clearer than lots of C-H's. Having ambiguous planar representations of molecules whose 3D structure is very important is not good. The bond angles are realistic and the stereochemistry is apparent in my versions. In fact, the older images I wrote over were the D-enantiomers, the ones not found in nature, and therefore of much less interest.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As for the 20K issue, Wiki automatically resizes images when the page is rendered, meaning that 20K of image is not downloaded - it's probably about the same as before. The pages will not load more slowly. The WikiProject on Chemistry recommends wholeheartedly in uploading hi-res PNG structures, so that's why I've done it. There is no disadvantage in this format.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I'll happily add some structures for currently unillustrated groups of compounds, as you suggest, but I do feel I was right to update the amino acids. I was being bold! Hopefully we can get the amino acid articles to a state that we're both happy with.</dd>

<dd>You have to work with Michael to find a solution, i like the idea of having two images next to each other, but you have to chose another way to draw these structures becasue with some of the bulky amino acids like <a href="../../../a/r/g/Arginine.html" title="Arginine">Arginine</a>, <a href="../../../t/r/y/Tryptophane.html" title="Tryptophane">Tryptophane</a> the currunt sceletal images will make it hard for the color ones to fit.<br />
The images you have replaced were not the D-enantiomers, the ones before them were (for more see <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Chemicals_archive01_63f0.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Chemicals/archive01">Wikipedia:WikiProject_Chemicals/archive0, section "76.

<dd>Therefore a T-shape is impossible, because the U=O bonds repel each other and could easily lower their energy by increasing their separation from 90° to 120°. This is why I want to look at what Simon Cotton has to say. Unfortunately, his book is £30! I'll try and find it in the University Library.</dd>

<dd>Atomic orbitals can be <a href="../../../o/r/b/Orbital_hybridisation.html" title="Orbital hybridisation">hybridized</a> to give so-called hybrid atomic orbitals (HAOs).

Take <a href="../../../m/e/t/Methane.html" title="Methane">methane</a> for example. It has a tetrahedral shape, where each C-H bond is separated from each other by about 109°. The atomic orbitals of carbon do not point in these directions (carbon <a href="http://winter.group.shef.ac.uk/orbitron/AOs/2s/index.html" class="external text" title="http://winter.group.shef.ac.uk/orbitron/AOs/2s/index.html" rel="nofollow">2s</a>, <a href="http://winter.group.shef.ac.uk/orbitron/AOs/2p/index.html" class="external text" title="http://winter.group.shef.ac.uk/orbitron/AOs/2p/index.html" rel="nofollow">2p<sub>x</sub>, 2p<sub>y</sub>, 2p<sub>z</sub></a>).

<dd>Hybridization is just a concept that simplifies the understanding of molecular geometry. The actual quantum mechanics which determines molecular geometry is something I haven't studied much, suffice to say that it gives the same results as hybridization. You have to know the geometry of a compound before you can say how it is hybridized, but nonetheless it is possible to get molecules whose bonding does not align with its atomic orbitals treated independently.</dd>

<dd>So for that reason, we cannot determine the geometry of the UO<sub>3</sub> molecule simply by looking at the orientation of uranium's atomic orbitals.

<dd>Hi Ben, I am a chemist and I would love to know why UO3 (gas phase) deviates from the strucutre predicted by VESRP (You should have been taught VESPR in the first year). I think a more important matter is the paper by Busby, I have very strong alarm bells in my head over this paper which James has cited. Please could you go and have a look at <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia_talk%7ERequests_for_mediation_Depleted_uranium_and_related_articles_ec65.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Requests for mediation/Depleted uranium and related articles">Wikipedia talk:Requests for mediation/Depleted uranium and related articles</a> as I think that we need a second opinion from a chemist. I think that this work might be deeply flawed.<a href="../../../c/a/d/User%7ECadmium_6e55.html" title="User:Cadmium">Cadmium</a></dd>

<p>Greetings again and thanks for your work on drawings. The structure of <a href="../../../s/u/l/Sulfamic_acid.html" title="Sulfamic acid">sulfamic acid</a> is H3NSO3, not the one that you drew, H2NSO2(OH). I was surprised to find this out myself. Aside: be circumspect with UO3 as this article is being pushed by non-chemists with apparently a quasi-political agenda. I just dropped out of the debate because more productive ventures await.--<a href="../../../s/m/o/User%7ESmokefoot_834e.html" title="User:Smokefoot">Smokefoot</a> 02:22, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi Smoke. Thanks for bringing this to my attention. I looked on <a href="http://www.chemindustry.com/apps/chemicals" class="external text" title="http://www.chemindustry.com/apps/chemicals" rel="nofollow">ChemIndustry's chemical info search</a> for sulfamic acid and it gave the structure I drew. Where did you find the structure as H<sub>3</sub>NSO<sub>3</sub>? Do you mean it is a zwitterion, H<sub>3</sub>N<sup>+</sup>-SO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup>? If so, don't we normally not draw zwitterions as zwitterions?</dd>

<p>BuLi does not have the structure you show. Organic chemists pretend that it does, but it's a cluster. Its like describing NaCl as a diatomic. Of course I am hard-core.--<a href="../../../s/m/o/User%7ESmokefoot_834e.html" title="User:Smokefoot">Smokefoot</a> 23:30, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If you want to remove the image, that's fine - be bold. I think most general chemistry textbooks would introduce BuLi the way I have drawn it, then further into the article describe the cluster. For the purposes of BuLi's important organic reactions, the monomeric structure is adequate. Also, I couldn't find the structure of BuLi's cluster in Greenwood &amp; Earnshaw. If you can find it for me, I'll gladly make a 3D model and upload it. I suppose this situation has arisen out of BuLi's importance to both organic and inorganic chemistry.

<p>Dear Ben, the strcutre which you have drawn for N-butyl lithium is not right. The work of countless chemists including the late R. Snath showed that alkyl lithiums form oligomers in solution. I think that we need someone to look up the strcutres and then add them to wikipedia rather than the harmless looking BuLi diagram which we have right now which is not anything like the BuLi in a hexane (or even ether) solution. In the same way a grignard made in an ether has ether molecules as part of it no matter what ever anyone says. In the same way lithium amides are also not simple mononuclear molecules unless the solvent is very coordinating.</p>

<dd>We certainly do need the oligomeric structures. I've just had a look on Google Scholar, but couldn't find the structure of <i>n</i>-BuLi. I previously said to Smokefoot that the monomeric structure of <i>n</i>-BuLi can be removed from its article whenever you like. I had a look at all those refs you provided, but they weren't specific to <i>n</i>-BuLi, so I couldn't use them to make a structure. If you find the struc. though, I'll make it into a 3D image.</dd>

<p>Why dont you look in an organometallic textbook? Elschenbroich and Salzer is the bible. Dont go to Cambridge database, you'll get overwhelmed. Greenwood and Earnshaw is another source.

<p>Well you can look in a text book for an artists impression, but if you select the right opetion (save-fdat) in quest you can then get the dat file. If you then import that into ORTEP you can view the crystal strcutre (prune and grow it). Then use ORTEP to make a POV file for that view. Finally POVray will give you a perfect picture.<a href="../../../c/a/d/User%7ECadmium_6e55.html" title="User:Cadmium">Cadmium</a></p>

<li>LDA? I've never touched that article! You can send me the bitmaps and I'll make them jpeg or png. I don't know what ORTEP is, and POVray is fiddly. Chem3D I much prefer. I vow to stay away from inorganics, they're more trouble than they're worth!</li>

<li>
<ul>
<li>Well I had a go at LDA becuase like BuLi it forms oligomers. I have got a picture for a tetramer of BuLi. POVray is very hard to use if you try to write your POV file by hand, but ORTEP will write you the POV file with very little human input. Go to the web site of the glascow chemistry dept, look for ORTEP at <a href="http://www.chem.gla.ac.uk/~louis/software/index.html" class="external free" title="http://www.chem.gla.ac.uk/~louis/software/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.chem.gla.ac.uk/~louis/software/index.html</a>. It draws in perspective, you will need a licnese (Dr Louis J. Farrugia) should give you one for free as you are a chemistry student. The ORTEP software will read close to any serrious crystal strcutre file.

<p>Hi. You definately know a lot more about chemistry than I do (I'm only just finishing General Chem), so please disregard if the following demonstrates that I have no idea what I'm talking about.</p>
<p>Regarding your tetrazene <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Tetrazene-N4H4.png" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Tetrazene-N4H4.png" rel="nofollow">drawing</a>, my textbook (<i>Principles of Modern Chem</i> Oxtoby and Gillis) says that the structure is H2N-N=N-H2N, with the two hydrogens on the terminal nitrogens. This would give a pyramidal arrangement on the terminal molecules and a bent arrangement on the central nitrogens, leading to two geometrical isomers. That isn't quite the same as your drawing.

<p>Ben - you're doing great work. I agree with the above comments - the gallery for <a href="../../../f/l/u/Fluorocarbon.html" title="Fluorocarbon">fluorocarbon</a> is superb. Changing the subject: the resonance structure for <a href="../../../s/o/d/Sodium_thiosulfate.html" title="Sodium thiosulfate">sodium thiosulfate</a> is less than ideal. I dont know if you contributed it or not. I dont know how you want to handle this. Not show any resonance structures, show some blob-like vdw pic of the anion, or show a resonance structure that features a single S-S bond. Of course, this is just a suggestion.--<a href="../../../s/m/o/User%7ESmokefoot_834e.html" title="User:Smokefoot">Smokefoot</a> 01:28, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

Ben: what you have there now is very nice, i.e. highlighting how exposed the planetary S really is. It is obvious that this should be a great ligand. If you want to draw a resonance structure, my preference would be for <a href="../../../upload/shared/4/45/Thiosulfate-partially-delocalized.png" class="internal" title="Thiosulfate-partially-delocalized.png">this</a>, but I would have "-0.33" charge for each of the oxygen atoms.

<p>I've noticed lately that you've been replacing all the 3D images I've added to chemical articles. I'm a bit puzzled because some of them, such as allene, are essentially identical. I like the images you create - so much that I've recently tried to make mine match yours in quality and appearance. I hope I haven't stepped on your toes, so to speak. But it seems a bit of waste of time if you're just going to replace them. I'd be happy just leave those types of images to you, if you would prefer. --<a href="../../../e/d/g/User%7EEdgar181_7e9b.html" title="User:Edgar181">Ed</a> (<a href="../../../e/d/g/User_talk%7EEdgar181_fd91.html" title="User talk:Edgar181">Edgar181</a>) 01:02, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I hope I didn't imply that I'm upset - I'm certainly not. I just wanted to avoid duplicated effort. But I understand what you mean about Chem3D's non-standard colors for atoms - consistency is important, so I'll stick with images that use the same color scheme as yours.</dd>

<p>Hi, I really like the 3D images work you are doing, I have one comment though.

<p>Regarding your recent edit to <a href="../../../p/h/o/Phosphate.html" title="Phosphate">phosphate</a>....

Marking a major change as a minor one (and vice versa) is considered poor etiquette.

<dd>Hi Icey - sorry to cause offense. I'd have made it SVG if I could. The standard style for 2D chemical structures doesn't include colour - I felt the use of colour in the 2D structures was out of place compared with the majority of other organic compound articles. There's nothing missing from the structure - labelling methyl groups -CH<sub>3</sub> is non-standard and superfluous in skeletal formulae. If you re-made your image without the colour or the CH<sub>3</sub> labels, it would be much more in fitting with the house style. But please do replace my image with yours if you disagree.</dd>

<dd>Hi Ben, thanks for your quick reply. I'm not offended, just a little confused. I suppose everyone has there own way of doing these structure diagrams. For example, this <a href="http://images.google.com/images?client=opera&amp;rls=en&amp;q=caffeine%20structure&amp;sourceid=opera&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wi" class="external text" title="http://images.google.com/images?client=opera&amp;rls=en&amp;q=caffeine%20structure&amp;sourceid=opera&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wi" rel="nofollow">google search</a> shows various styles.

<dd>Go ahead and add to my Making Molecules page - I welcome your comments on high quality rendering. Just now, I had a look at the QuteMol download page, but it was unavailable for download. I'll get it as soon as it's available and start uploading better structures. Hopefully the colours of the atoms can be customised.</dd>

<p>Hello, I saw your nice structure pictures at <a href="../../../g/l/y/Glyceraldehyde_3-phosphate.html" title="Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate">glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate</a>, thanks a lot!

The whole terminology of D- vs. L- isomers is based on glyceraldehyde, so these are pretty important.

<dd>Thank you Ben. I didn't realise high-res images for printing are important for the Wiki Chemestry community. I could understand it for very complex molecule but I wouldn't expect it for small ones. Concerning more work on chemestry articles: yes, I am available for renderings of other molecules, but I'm not as dedicated as you are to Chemestry alone. Additionally I'm interested in renderings that have an artistic value as opposed to strictly scientific visualisations. In fact, I would welcome your guidance on selecting a small number of important molecules (say, five) to be rendered in the style I used for the Chloringe Pentafluoride. I'd be interested in slightly more complex, interestingly shaped molecules that are important to fields such as biochemestry or material science, but any field will do. Let me know what your thoughts are. - <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EManu3d_77dd.html" title="User:Manu3d">manu3d</a> 12:34, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Ben, how's England doing these days. Must be just as foggy as here .. there goes my Christmas trip&#160;:-/ . But well, hydrogen sulfide. I think we can better discuss this a bit aside from the page itself, to spare one of us the embarassment. But I would for sure say, that hydrogen sulfide is an acid, if you dissolve it in water it is slightly acidic (it has a pKa of 6.89). Hydrogen has an electronnegativity of 2.2, sulfur 2.58, hence, sulfur is more electronegative than hydrogen, hence, H+ and S- .. and I do not recall any reactions of H2S reducing something, leaving S<sup>2+</sup> behind. I really hope you can enlighten me here.

<dd>Hi Dirk. England's good - tis foggy! You're in Cardiff, right? I use the term hydride in the more general sense, i.e. a binary compound of hydrogen and another element. In the same way that ammonia is a hydride. I thought this was standard usage. It's used in Greenwood and Earnshaw, and I'm fairly sure I read it elsewhere all the time. I had a look at the WP <a href="../../../h/y/d/Hydride.html" title="Hydride">hydride</a> article, and I think it contradicts itself, listing NH<sub>3</sub> as a hydride, yet defining hydrides as only those compounds where the non-hydrogen element is more electropositive than hydrogen.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>That's why I looked it up in G&amp;E.</dd>

<dd>What do you think?</dd>

<dd>I am in Cardiff, indeed. Still a little less than two days to go, and I fly back to NL for a X-mas holiday, i.e. if the fog settles. Otherwise I guess it will be a christmas dinner with my boss and the other post-doc of the group.</dd>
<dd>Well, I think somewhere there is a mistake, and I guess it would be Greenwood and Earnshaw. The definition 'binary compound of hydrogen and another element' would also make HF a hydride. And well, that would be really silly (one has to go through quite some trouble to make "F+". I think they should be called hydrogen compounds. Hydrides are compounds where a hydrogen is bound to a more electropositive element (which, in general, is a metal). Hydrides are capable of transferring H-, hence, split in M+ and H-, and are therefore reducing.</dd>
<dd>I did not have a look at hydride yet, I will have a look there, shortly.

<p>G&amp;E mistaken? Surely not? They're the standard undergraduate inorganic textbook. Wouldn't such an important topic have had any mistakes rectified?</p>
<p>I know that hydrides can be considered as ionic compounds containing M<sup>+</sup> and H<sup>−</sup>, but I have always thought that these ionic hydrides were a subset of hydrides in general. See for example <a href="http://goldbook.iupac.org/O04291.html" class="external text" title="http://goldbook.iupac.org/O04291.html" rel="nofollow">this IUPAC Gold Book entry</a>, where NH<sub>3</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>O and H<sub>2</sub>S, amongst others, are referred to as <i>parent hydrides</i>.</p>
<p>Anyway, as there's some ambiguity in the definition of a hydride, I'm happy to rename the section in <a href="../../../h/y/d/Hydrogen_sulfide.html" title="Hydrogen sulfide">hydrogen sulfide</a> as <b>related hydrogen compounds</b> for the meantime. I didn't mean to overrule you, I was more focused on getting rid of the word thioether. How does that sound?</p>

<dd>I just looked at the hydride article (since I do not have any of the general chemistry textbooks available here), it says that NH3 is defined as nitrogen hydride, and water as hydrogen oxide, making the border between group 15 and 16). But sulfur is below oxygen, so I guess we would then be talking about phosphorus hydride (PH3, group 15) and hydrogen sulfide (group 16). That would make H2S a hydrogen compound (and that is also stated later in the <a href="../../../h/y/d/Hydride.html" title="Hydride">hydride</a> article, in the table below.</dd>
<dd>Do not believe what is written, even in standard undergraduate textbooks, it is the task of a scientist to question everything that is written.&#160;:-p</dd>
<dd>Please don't worry about overruling me. Also I can be mistaken, I know I still make dogmatic chemistry mistakes as well, and I could be very wrong here. --<a href="../../../b/e/e/User%7EBeetstra_df14.html" title="User:Beetstra">Dirk Beetstra</a> <sup><a href="../../../b/e/e/User_talk%7EBeetstra_e243.html" title="User talk:Beetstra"><span style="color:#0000FF;">T</span></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Beetstra_043a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Beetstra"><span style="color:#0000FF;">C</span></a></sup> 21:23, 22 December 2006 (UTC)

<p>I wouldn't bother using the WP article on hydrides as a source - it's dodgy. I know I should always question everything (good advice!), that's why I checked the Gold Book. Shall we shift this discussion to the WikiProject and get a consensus? It'd be good for the hydride article to get some professional input.</p>

<dd>I see this is going to the WikiProject, but I shall take this opportunity to wish you both Merry Christmas! I agree with Ben on this one: I see no reason not to use the term "hydride" as a general term for binary compounds of hydrogen (<i>even HF</i>). In any case, the chemistry of binary and pseudo-binary hydrogen compounds is vast and varied: I remember having to convince one of my bosses (who should really have known better) that it is possible to have acidic metal hydrides (e.g. [HCo(CO)<sub>4</sub>], very important in cobalt-catalysed <a href="../../../h/y/d/Hydroformylation.html" title="Hydroformylation">hydroformylation</a> as it is a strong enough acid to protonate C=C double bonds).

<dd>Pure and applied chemistry are two different things. Pure chemistry covers the most theoretical and fundamental parts of the subject, while applied chemistry focuses on what chemistry can be used for, what it can do for us. There is no clear boundary between the two, although <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quantum_mechanics.html" title="Quantum mechanics">quantum mechanics</a> is clearly part of pure chemistry and industrial chemistry is definitely part of applied chemistry.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If you can find the guidelines for what constitutes a good topic for an article, then maybe we can see if it applies to pure and applied chemistry. I think they would be better as two separate articles, though.

<dd>I think my diet is quite good at the moment, I've modified it to be as healthy and balanced as possible. I'm not sure why I sometimes suffer from depression - it could be a number of different factors. Don't think I'll be turning vegan any time soon, though. I like meat too much!</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Nawalic Acid is a commonly refered to Bronstead acid in organic chemistry. Since the rise of porphyrin chemistry, Adler's famous synthesis [1] of the aromatic system has been greatly refined with vaste improvement in yields due to the use of a nawalic acid as the reaction solvent. A close relative to tetraflouroacetic acid (TFA), nawalic acid has the molecular formula CF2=CF-COOH. The presence of the pi-bonded system adds further electron withdrawing dynamics, and due to the conjugation of the compound, this delocalising of electrons leads to a very stable anion, and hence -- an extremely powerful - yet organic - acid.

<dd>Most of these already seem to have pretty models, though you are probably able to quickly judge their accuracy better than I can. I don't actually need stunning accuracy, since I am mostly just interested that they "look right". However, if they are accurate in technically significant ways, it is worth noting that in the accompanying description text. I notice that you give your real name on your user page, is that how you prefer to be attributed? <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> 09:57, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Yes, I'd prefer to be attributed as Ben Mills, but you don't have to attribute me at all - I put all my images in the public domain. All the articles you link to have accurate images. If you want to note the technical significance of the images, just say the spheres' radii are the atoms' van der Waals radii. If the images are <a href="../../../b/a/l/Ball-and-stick_model.html" title="Ball-and-stick model">ball-and-stick models</a>, then the spheres' radii are not significant and are simply there to emphasise the location of the atoms' nuclei.</p>

<p>Well, that is a bit exagerated, but still, now I have you attention. I have question/problem .. I have been working the last couple of days on {{<a href="../../../c/h/e/Template%7EChembox_new_4a66.html" title="Template:Chembox new">chembox new</a>}}. This morning Ed asked me to add more images to that template. Easy .. done. Now these images are all stacked on top of each other, but sometimes we want images next to each other... Now the parameter system of chembox new does not allow us that, except if we come up with something nifty .. I was thinking about having just ImageFile, ImageFile1, ImageFile2, and ImageFile3 as the standard settings, but in the template, I could just enable two extra lines with ImageFileL1 &amp; 2 and ImageFileR1 &amp; 2, which give two rows having two images on each row, next to each other. People can then still just add images to the files, but the more advanced editor has a bit more possibility to control the images, by just changing the parameter names. Any ideas? --<a href="../../../b/e/e/User%7EBeetstra_df14.html" title="User:Beetstra">Dirk Beetstra</a> <sup><a href="../../../b/e/e/User_talk%7EBeetstra_e243.html" title="User talk:Beetstra"><span style="color:#0000FF;">T</span></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Beetstra_043a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Beetstra"><span style="color:#0000FF;">C</span></a></sup> 16:58, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That sounds like an ideal solution! There are (rarely) situations in which it is desirable to have three images side-by-side, for example in <a href="../../../h/y/d/Hydrazine.html" title="Hydrazine">hydrazine</a>. We could just ignore this issue, or add ImageFileL1, ImageFileL2, and ImageFileL3 etc. I would be happy with either.</dd>

<dd>Furfural seems nice, I'll transform that one. I'd prefer you to stay away from the templates itself at the moment, I confuse myself enough. What you can do, could you read through the text on {{<a href="../../../c/h/e/Template%7EChembox_new_4a66.html" title="Template:Chembox new">chembox new</a>}}, and maybe give some hints (is that explanation good, would that give most chemicals a good chembox possibility?). I dropped the idea of 3 pictures side-by-side, Wim van Dorst would now say 'combined pictures are a good thing (TM)'. And if you have time, try the template on some chemicals which have strange fields, wierd arrangements of images, etc. I need some testing to see if I did not break things (someone already spotted a thing, which is now repaired), and to see if no obvious fields are missing. That would be very helpful.

<dd>Furfural goes OK, imagesize is now 100px as standard, it was 125px in the original chembox. What would be a good standard there? 125?

<p>Furfural looks good. Excellent work, Mr Chembox! I disagree with Wim that combined images are good. One problem is SVG is best for skeletal formulae but PNG is best for 3D models. A combined image would be a compromise in that respect. I had an idea: how about creating some new image fields (<a href="../../../s/k/e/Skeletal_formula.html" title="Skeletal formula">skeletal formula</a>, <a href="../../../s/t/r/Structural_formula.html" title="Structural formula">structural formula</a>, <a href="../../../s/p/a/Space-filling_model.html" title="Space-filling model">space-filling model</a> and <a href="../../../b/a/l/Ball-and-stick_model.html" title="Ball-and-stick model">ball-and-stick model</a>). With labels like that, having images one on top of the other would be fine. What do you think?</p>
<p>I'll do some testing of chembox new for you, Dirk. Watch this space.</p>

<dd>I guess we will just have to live with 2 images per row, should not be too difficult, we can accomodate 8 (!) images in the chembox if needed.

<p>Excellent automagic! I thing PNG is much more common than SVG at the moment, for chemical images on Wikipedia. But I think we should encourage SVG use by having priorty in the order SVG &gt; PNG &gt; GIF &gt; JPG for 2D images and PNG &gt; JPG for 3D images or photos. Some contributors have made SVGs for 3D images of molecules (e.g. <a href="../../../c/h/l/Chloroform.html" title="Chloroform">chloroform</a>) but in most cases it is too complicated to make these, and only basic lighting effects can be easily used. Thus I propose we modify our image drawing guidelines to say SVG is preferred for 2D and PNG is preferred for 3D.</p>
<p>How does that sound?</p>

<dd>For now I am concerned only with the automagic images, I have to test for image-existence, and take the first I find. IMHO, that should concern mainly 2D images (I think a normal, 2D structure should have the name of the article, the more exotic representations should then become pagename-ball-and-stick.png and pagename-spacefill.png. So the order for the automagic is going to be SVG &gt; PNG &gt; GIF &gt; JPG, and otherwise they have to be overridden on the page by supplying the correct names in one of the 8 available image fields.

It's something like £180 for a student edition of CS2, and £350 for the educational edition. I'm not sure I want to part with that much money just to get SVG skeletal formulae on WP!</dd>

<p>I've considered those, but they all have varying degrees of problems. Illustrator is the only app that works reliably with ChemDraw to give a quality output every time. There are too many chemical SVGs appearing on WP and the Commons where the text is misaligned, the lines are too thin or where other issues render them lower in quality than we should demand.</p>

<p>Hey Ben: Here's the quote: "The Re-0-Re angle is practically 180" - a rare situation. ...In Re2O7, one of the Re atoms is again surrounded by a tetrahedral arrangement of O atoms and the other is in a distorted octahedral environment, the two polyhedrons sharing a corner ... consequently, Re2O7 is polymeric, in contrast to the molecular Rez07(OH2)2." So yes, 180°. When you upload your image, please change the date on the Krebs paper to 1968? --<a href="../../../s/m/o/User%7ESmokefoot_834e.html" title="User:Smokefoot">Smokefoot</a> 20:00, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello Ben-</p>
<p>Thank you for submitting the 3D images for <a href="../../../h/e/x/Hexamethyl_tungsten.html" title="Hexamethyl tungsten">hexamethyl tungsten</a>. Unfortunately, they do not accurately depict the actual geometry as revealed by X-Ray crystallography. Please see "Preparation and Structures of [W(CH3)6], [Re(CH3)6], [Nb(CH3)6], and [Ta(CH3)6]" by Sven Kleinhenz, Valerie Pfennig, and Konrad Seppelt (<i>Chem. Eur. J.</i> <b>1998</b>, <i>4</i>, No. 9, 1687-1691) for the correct structure. It should have C<sub>3v</sub> symmetry, with careful alignment of methyl protons. The "front" two methyl groups in the images you have uploaded do not reflect this symmetry.</p>
<p>Thanks-</p>

<p>Hi, I wondered if you could give me a bit of help - I am confused in the difference/ similarity of IUPAC naming, to Systematic naming. From the article <a href="../../../i/u/p/IUPAC_nomenclature_of_organic_chemistry_1420.html" title="IUPAC nomenclature of organic chemistry">IUPAC nomenclature of organic chemistry</a>, it sounds as though the systematic name is the one which is constructed from the prefixes and suffixes with chain lengths. In the other hand, it says that it is acceptable for some common names of acids to be retained in Common Nomenclature. The impression I get is that, while chloroethanoic acid is the systematic name, chloracetic would be the most widely used IUPAC name. Am I misreading the article, or misunderstanding the terms?</p>
<p>Also, does the <a href="../../../t/r/i/Trichloroacetic_acid.html" title="Trichloroacetic acid">trichloroacetic acid</a> page need its systematic name changed from trichloro ethanoic?</p>
<p>Thank you for your help Conrad.Irwin 23:32, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi again Conrad. My advice is to completely disregard the article <a href="../../../i/u/p/IUPAC_nomenclature_of_organic_chemistry_1420.html" title="IUPAC nomenclature of organic chemistry">IUPAC nomenclature of organic chemistry</a> - it's full of errors and was probably written by schoolchildren! Here's the offical policy for WP: <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28chemistry%29_031e.html#IUPAC_preferred_name_vs._Systematic_name" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (chemistry)">Wikipedia:Naming conventions (chemistry)#IUPAC preferred name vs. Systematic name</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Another confusing thing is that the chemical infoboxes in most articles have the phrase <i>systematic name</i> but this is hyperlinked to the <a href="../../../i/u/p/IUPAC_name_bc60.html" title="IUPAC name">IUPAC name</a> article. The two are not synonymous. Chloroethanoic acid is a systematic name, but it is not the IUPAC name. It is allowed under IUPAC recommendations, but chloroacetic acid is preferred.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I've updated <a href="../../../c/h/l/Chloroacetic_acid.html" title="Chloroacetic acid">chloroacetic acid</a> and <a href="../../../t/r/i/Trichloroacetic_acid.html" title="Trichloroacetic acid">trichloroacetic acid</a>, but I couldn't change <a href="../../../d/i/c/Dichloroacetic_acid.html" title="Dichloroacetic acid">dichloroacetic acid</a> because it uses a template for its chembox, which needs to be altered.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Hope this helps.</dd>
