<p>Recently the following sentences were removed from the article:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Of him, George Lakoff, a well known American linguist, has said:
<dl>
<dd><i>Whorf was not only an outstanding linguist... he was an outstanding human being</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Motivation for the deletion was that 'opinions on outstanding human beings are a dime a dozen'. I don't agree. But let me first quote Lakoff correctly. The quote comes from Lakoff's (1987) influential book <i>Women, Fire, and Dangerous Things</i>. It is the concluding remark of a section on Whorf's views in Chapter 18 (titled 'Whorf and Relativism') of the book. I quote:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>Whorf was not only a pioneer in linguistics. He was a pioneer as a human being. That should not be forgotten.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>In my opinion, a quote like this from a <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Lakoff_a8a3.html" title="George Lakoff">linguist like this</a> is highly relevant to the article. Whorf was (and still is) controversial in linguistics; Lakoff admits so, but at the same time highly appreciates some of his thoughts, and furthermore adds that Whorf was a pioneer as a human being. I've re-added it, corrected it, and added the reference. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_Dingemanse_1cc9.html" title="User:Mark Dingemanse"></a>— <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_Dingemanse_1cc9.html" title="User:Mark Dingemanse">mark</a> <a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMark_Dingemanse_c686.html" title="User talk:Mark Dingemanse">✎</a> 00:48, 22 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>So lemme see: Linguists like Lakoff (prominent, i guess?) are experts on being a "pioneer as a human being", which i can't deny, knowing little about linguistics and nothing about lingists like Lakoff. But still, how is this relevant ... hmmm, i can't very well make an argument against that, since i have not the slightest idea what it means to be "a pioneer as a human being".</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>I'll tell you what, i'll start over: What value could this conceivably add to the article?</dd>
<dd>--<a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJerzy_42e0.html" title="User:Jerzy">Jerzy</a><a href="../../../j/e/r/User_talk%7EJerzy_59c9.html" title="User talk:Jerzy">(t)</a> 05:00, 2005 Jan 22 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Please don't feel too annoyed, I'll try to clarify myself. Granted, Lakoff is no expert on being a pioneer as a human being. What makes the quote relevant is that it is the opinion of a prominent linguist about someone that is still controversial in linguistics. In that light, the first part of the quote ('pioneer in linguistics') is no doubt more important and more substantial than the second part; but I think it makes sense to include the full quote (the "that should not be forgotten" part is of minor importance though). Furthermore, I think the change to 'pioneer' makes the quote more acceptable and more relevant than the previous ill-cited version. It is more easy to see why someone could be a <i>pioneer</i> as a human being than why someone would be just 'an outstanding human being'. In fact, Lakoff argues why Whorf was a pioneer as to his <i>weltanschauung</i>. I'll quote the context of his statement (Lakoff 1987:330):
<dl>
<dd>One all-important thing should be remembered about Whorf. He did most of his work at a time when Nazism was on the rise in Europe and jingoism was prevalent in America. At that time, white people were assumed, even in much of the U.S., to be more intelligent than people with skins of other colors. Western civilaztion was assumed to be the pinnacle of intellectual achievement; other civilizations were considered inferior. 'Culture' meant European and American culture, not Hopi culture or Balinese culture. 'Literature' meant European and American literature. 'Logic' meant Western logic, not logic as it developed in China and India. 'Scientific thought' was the last word in rationality, and it of course belonged to us. It was even thought that Western languages were 'advanced' and that nowestern languages were 'primitive'. The very idea that 'uneducated' Indians, who were still considered savages by many, could reason as well as educated Americans and Europeans was extraordinary and radical. The notion that their conceptual system <i>better</i> fit scientific reality—that <i>we</i> could learn from <i>them</i>—bordered on the unthinkable<br /></dd>
<dd>Whorf was not only a pioneer in linguistics. He was a pioneer as a human being. That should not be forgotten.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>On reading the article again, I would say that the article could be more outspoken on Whorf's pioneering position in his time and background. The quote of course is a good start. Let me know what you think! <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_Dingemanse_1cc9.html" title="User:Mark Dingemanse"></a>— <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_Dingemanse_1cc9.html" title="User:Mark Dingemanse">mark</a> <a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMark_Dingemanse_c686.html" title="User talk:Mark Dingemanse">✎</a> 10:22 &amp; 11:09, 22 Jan 2005 (UTC) [Timestamp corrected by <a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJerzy_42e0.html" title="User:Jerzy">Jerzy</a><a href="../../../j/e/r/User_talk%7EJerzy_59c9.html" title="User talk:Jerzy">(t)</a> 18:37, 2005 Jan 22 (UTC)]</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>I think the above explanation is a great help toward a worthwhile replacement for either of the things i removed. (But i still find it hard to see a role for the quote itself, even as an intro to this more relevant material. The quote is too cryptic, and too saturated with the pretentious overstatement of funeral eulogies, to convey this role -- a role that may actually <i>deserve</i> such praise.) Perhaps this history-of-ideas material duplicates, or should be the start of, a separate article about how racism stopped being a self-evidently virtue in white America, or in the West. (Any average liberal (in my esitmation of that category) who saw "Unforgivable Blackness", the new <a href="../../../k/e/n/Ken_Burns_1dcd.html" title="Ken Burns">Ken Burns</a>/<a href="../../../g/e/o/Geoffrey_Ward_2a81.html" title="Geoffrey Ward">Geoffrey Ward</a> documentary on <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_Johnson_9d31.html" title="Jack Johnson">Jack Johnson</a> and the great white hopes (see also <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Great_White_Hope_8742.html" title="The Great White Hope">The Great White Hope</a>) in the past week is likely to share my awe at how hidden that transition has been. I don't know if WP covers it at all well.)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>We certainly should have a link from <a href="../../../b/e/n/Benjamin_Whorf_d0f7.html" title="Benjamin Whorf">Benjamin Whorf</a> to such an article, next to something about "important figure in [whatever, or "the development of" whatever]". We're not talking about <a href="../../../c/u/l/Cultural_relativism.html" title="Cultural relativism">cultural relativism</a>, i think (tho certainly there is a relationship): IMO CR is much more theoretical and intellectual, while this involves a lot of gut-level assumptions. Nor is this a matter of anti-racism, which is also much more self-conscious.</dd>
<dd>BTW, IMO, this makes it mandatory for the article to have two major sections, one on his linguistics work and one on the attitude shift, and i suggest that that, rather than a quote at the tail of a single section, is the useful starting point we need.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>&#160;:) I guess we won't come to an agreement about the quote (but I am glad that it's not 'utter bosh' to you anymore). Regarding the other points, I fully agree with you. Whorf isn't high on my to do list at present, but your sketch would be a good start. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_Dingemanse_1cc9.html" title="User:Mark Dingemanse"></a>— <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_Dingemanse_1cc9.html" title="User:Mark Dingemanse">mark</a> <a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMark_Dingemanse_c686.html" title="User talk:Mark Dingemanse">✎</a> 22:31, 23 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<hr />
<p>I examined the page history, hoping that the bibliography grew from some reasonable length to its present exhaustive size (unusable for encyclopedic purposes), and that i could keep the current versions of the original entries while moving the new ones here. But it <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Benjamin_Whorf&amp;diff=4982431&amp;oldid=4981530" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Benjamin_Whorf&amp;diff=4982431&amp;oldid=4981530" rel="nofollow">sprang forth full-grown</a> like Venus. If no one is prepared to move the excess to here in the next week, it should be moved here en masse, to serve as source material, while we wait as long as it takes for someone to come up with something like a half-dozen crucial items.<br />

<dd>Wholeheartedly agree.

<p>Did Whorf live among the Hopi people, and if so, for how long?</p>
<dl>
<dd>As far as I remember, he spent a few weeks among the Hopi - no more than that. Most of his informants were Hopi he knew in New York. My very personal opinion is that this fact invalidates a lot of his work on the Hopi language. His idea that language restricts what we can think could never apply to his informants, as they all spoke English as well as Hopi, and therefore were free of the restrictions.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>There is a fairly convincing rebuttal of Whorf in Donald E. Brown's Human Universals, <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 007008209X</a> for anyone who happens to have it and wants to dig up material to add to the article. <a href="../../../m/l/e/User%7EMlewan_ca7e.html" title="User:Mlewan">Mlewan</a> 21:56, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
