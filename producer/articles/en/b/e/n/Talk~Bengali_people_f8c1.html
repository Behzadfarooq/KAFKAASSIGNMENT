<p>The image, a composite of Tagore, Amartya Sen, Mujib, and an actress is formed from 4 images. At least 3 of them (except the one of Tagore) are not under a free license, and under fair use. Even if someone created it himself, that doesn't fall under fair use of the images.</p>
<p>Next, choice of particular indivduals is also questionable, and subject to POV questions. Personally, I think grouping the actress with the other 3 is highly objectionable. But in any case, there is no need to have a particular subset of people chosen as representative of Bengalis. --<a href="../../../r/a/g/User%7ERagib_55a5.html" title="User:Ragib">Ragib</a> 15:40, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Until the copyright issues are settled, and the copyvio removed, the image should be removed. I have edited it 3 times, so won't do it again today, but I urge the removal of the image pending copyright questions, and also POV. Thanks. --<a href="../../../r/a/g/User%7ERagib_55a5.html" title="User:Ragib">Ragib</a> 16:00, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have cited the sources in the image page and am ready to change the licensing mode. Besides I do not understand what is wrong with having an actress of Bengali ancestry who is extremely famous in India. This will bring some diversity in the profession of people. Besides I did not realise that you were removing the pictures all the time. I thought i had made some mistake with the code, so sorry about it. I am from West Bengal and my Bangladeshi freind studying with me here looks happy with my choice of personalities. ---Chen007</p>
<p>I do not get it. What is wrong with the choice of these subset of people in representing Bengalis. Why is it different from this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germans" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germans" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germans</a>? And why is an actress a poor choice for representing a particular ethnic group? ---Chen007</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>The problem of using a specific group of people is that personal choices often bring a POV. Why choose Mujib over Ziaur Rahman? Why choose Ria Sen over Suchitra Sen, or Shabana? Why choose Amartya Sen over Muhammad Yunus? See the point? It might often be better to have a nameless anonymous person being representative of an ethnic group, than having a particular set of people.</li>
<li>About licensing, no, you can't take a few non-free licensed images, and merge them together to release it in public domain. The images of Sheikh Mujib, Amartya Sen, Ria Sen are all under copyrights (The Mujib image is under Fair use license). You cannot take these images to create a new image under public domain. --<a href="../../../r/a/g/User%7ERagib_55a5.html" title="User:Ragib">Ragib</a> 16:19, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Putting pictures of people of one's own choice in this manner is quite a POV, no doubt. Now, discussion is the only way open, when disputed. I propose to start from the beginning. Here are my proposals.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>No compromise about copyright matters. There is absolutely no dispute about it (despite the admiration of <i>many others</i>) &amp; it is a resolved case. So, 1st step should be on the basis of this by the admins &amp; continued violation should be taken as an offense.</li>
<li>We are now left with public domain &amp; fair use licensed pictures. Among them, &amp; other names that came forward are-</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Rabindranath</li>
<li>Amartya Sen and/or why not Muhammad Yunus</li>
<li>Sheikh Mujib and/or why not Ziaur Rahman</li>
<li>The actress and/or why not (as I add) Bipasha, Rani, Bobita, Shuchitra, Kabari.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Keeping a picture of an actress is also disputed. So, without discussing about each individual, we can run a general discussion on -
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>What should be the proper (and fairly NPOV) basis of choosing a symbol-personality of an ethnicity?</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>My comments-
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>There was a BBC survey on the similar topic and Sheikh Mujib &amp; Rabindranath got 1st &amp; 2nd most votes. It can be taken as a major basis. Rabindranath seems to have zero dispute till now. 1st four of the list from different field can be given here.</li>
<li>Or like a historian, we can keep our fingers crossed about a personality until 50 years have passed since eir death, despite eir popularity at present.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Picture of the actress gets no place under both considerations. Take it another way, as this being an encyclopedia, which is supposed to remain unchanged except factual additions, can one claim <i>now</i> that the actress in the picture or similar other recent media-performers have such great impact or contribution on its people that eir glory remain the same even after 50 or 100 years? Perhaps not, or too tough to tell now, so leave it.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Thanks.</dd>

<p>I cannot see the POV point Ragib is pushing? In the case of the German page (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germans" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germans" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germans</a>) , why put Mozart over Beethovan or Gothe over Schiller. It is because it is not possible to put all the famous people in that space. Besides it seems to be a bit of a Bengali Vs Bangladeshi problem here. I think many Bangladeshis do not like Amartya Sen's choice here as he is a Indian Bengali. He has been chosen by the author randomly I believe (I hope). It might as well have been Yunus but it is Sen. Just like it might have been Ludwig Van instead of Herr Amadeus. or in the case of the English page (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_people" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_people" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_people</a>) why put Queen Elizabeth instead of King Charles I. or in the case of the Punjabis an actress has been shown as well (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjabis" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjabis" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjabis</a>). I am sure there are other Punjabi actresses but I believe she has been chosen by random. In the case of the Russians why not show Mendeleiev or Tchaikovsky(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russians" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russians" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russians</a>) instead of Tolstoy. In the case of the Chinese (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_Chinese" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_Chinese" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_Chinese</a>) why not show Mao or Confucius instead of the selection they have there. They all have POV issues then but they look good without the interference of the likes of Ragib. ----A <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 139.133.7.37 (<a href="../../../1/3/9/User_talk%7E139.133.7.37.html" title="User talk:139.133.7.37">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_139.133.7.37_0817.html" title="Special:Contributions/139.133.7.37">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<dd>Excuse me!! What POV did you find in my point above? Also, please don't try to introduce imaginary things here. I take a great exception to the comment "Bengali vs. Bangladeshi" ... it seems to imply Bangladeshis are not Bengalis??? Where above did I introduce anything about "Indian" vs "Bangaldeshi" Bengalis?</dd>

<dd>This is a very ignorant comment. Please don't put your imaginary words in people's mouths. There have been only two people who commented on this thread, including myself, so I infer that you are referring to me. Please DO NOT use your own imagination to extract "meanings" from comments. Where above have I referred to Amartya Sen's home region? And For your kind information, Amartya Sen is very much considered from "East Bengal" ... his ancestral home is in Dhaka. You are free to think about anything, but claiming such ridiculous things about other editors is a very very bad faith behavior.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>My point is NOT that Amartya Sen is a bad choice, but that a choosing a particular person as representative of a people is POV of the person who chose it. Even if the creator of the image chose a photo of Yunus, my point would have been the same. So, please refrain from such backhanded comments.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Also, all but 1 of the images are NOT FREE in terms of copyrights. Only the tagore image is freely usable. "Fair use" doesn't apply here, so we can't really use the other 3 images in the composite.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Finally, please don't launch personal attacks ... reply on the issue rather than your imaginations on my "ulterior" motives. Please respond to my comments on copyright, and on the POV of choosing particular persons. To make things clear for your understanding, my point here is that choosing particular persons is a POV (no matter who the person is). --<a href="../../../r/a/g/User%7ERagib_55a5.html" title="User:Ragib">Ragib</a> 09:42, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><br />
It seems like everyone is missing Ragib's actual points:<br /></p>
<ul>
<li>We can't use the three copyrighted images currently posted<br /></li>
<li>We should stay away from using (only) famous people to represent a culture, since choosing one particular famous person over another would bring up the issue of the chooser's POV<br /></li>
</ul>
<p>Now, for my own opinion, I totally agree with Ragib on the first point for sure, but I'm not so sure of the second one - only because after I went through and checked out other articles on races/ethnicities/nationalities, it seems like all the faces chosen to represent the group were of famous people. Granted, I don't think that that's very representative of the group as a whole, but if that's the tradition on Wikipedia, I'm fine with that.</p>
<p>On another point, I absolutely don't see any hint of POV or of any sort of strange biases or prejudices in Ragib's text that some people seemed to find. The people mentioned by Ragib represent Bengalis of different nationalities, so it's really quite strange to think that anyone could interpret this as bias. And where did that Amartya Sen comment come from? That seems quite uncalled for. I honestly don't think we should be trying to find things to argue or make false accusations about. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESameerKhan_2c38.html" title="User:SameerKhan">SameerKhan</a> 12:27, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Having taken a look into the data presented at that page, it looks ridiculous. It lists people with certain occupations as a "sub-ethnicity". I'd like to see more support from academic papers to back this statement. The data looks extremely ridiculous, as it lists people with certain last names as a sub-ethnicity!! --<a href="../../../r/a/g/User%7ERagib_55a5.html" title="User:Ragib">Ragib</a> 16:12, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I agree. That page lists so many subethnicities in Bangladesh, yet the majority of Bengalis are apparently the same subethnicity as much of the entire subcontinent (Shaikh)! The link seems to be non-scientific and we shouldn't be citing it. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESameerKhan_2c38.html" title="User:SameerKhan">SameerKhan</a> 18:58, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>True, on a closer look, I find that it has listed "Bishwas" as a "sub-ethnicity"!! For God's sake, that's a family name, and by that standard, the English should have thousands of sub-ethnicities. All the names listed in the page are family names, which has nothing to do with any "sub-ethnicities". One of them, "Munshi", is actually a (religious academic) title given to persons with certain religious education!! I therefore have to say that this so called project is simply pure crap, or the project people (the missionaries) have been pranked by someone. Otherwise, the data wouldn't have been so ridiculous. --<a href="../../../r/a/g/User%7ERagib_55a5.html" title="User:Ragib">Ragib</a> 19:17, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
