<p>Time to settle some issues! This is an open discussion!= Ben Wallace is definetly one of the "coolest(meaning afros and stuff)" centers in the game, period. He deserves to be defensive player of the year...... or does he?</p>
<p>Ben Wallace is an overated center, as there are much better centers out there. His height is the main issue, and centers such as Yao could eaisly overpower him. Any disagreements? <a href="../../../b/o/x/User%7EBoxbrown_53ed.html" title="User:Boxbrown">Boxbrown</a> 01:47, 4 April 2006 (UTC)boxbrown "the box"</p>
<p>your kidding me right? Yao Ming is a stick figure.</p>
<p>Usually stick figures don't average 20 points and 10 rebounds.</p>
<p>c'mon yoa ming is 7'6....he should be leading the nba in block shots,rebounds and houston should lead the nba with points in the paint....but yet he is getting he is shooting the ball from free throw distance and also getting blocked and dunked on (lol nate robinson blocked him good.) he is overated!!! he should gain some weight and play like a true center.

<p>There is a mistake in Article section for Ben Wallace. 6'9" is exactly 205.74cms (roughly 206cms) while 6'8" is 203.2cms not 199cms. 199cms will be about 6'6"1/3.</p>
<pre>
  "He is listed at 206 cm (6 ft 9in), although as he has stated probably stands closer to 199 cm (6 ft 8in) and weighs 109 kg (240 lb)."

<p>if players who are drafted but not yet signed are considered members of their team, so should free agents who have agreed to verbal terms. there have been several edits by users changing Wallace's team back to the Pistons. He is a Chicago Bull.

<dd>I'm not taking sides here but just letting everyone know that NBA.com don't always keep their pages up to date, it may take a full day for them to update their rosters to reflect real life happenings. But that's not to say Ben Wallace is with the Bulls. Officially, he's not.--Downwards 04:07, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It should be pointed out that rookies are considered members of the teams that drafted them because the sole negotiating rights belong to the teams unless they trade or otherwise relinquish the rights. Likewise with free agents, they are considered members of their old team and count against the salary cap until the player signs with another team or the team renounces the player. So Drmagic is comparing apples and oranges. <a href="../../../y/t/n/User%7EYtny_f220.html" title="User:Ytny">Ytny</a> 22:02, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Prehaps it could be reworded to reflect the fact that he was recently acquired to play for the Bulls. It appears with all possible signs that he is now a Bull. It's a bit of speculation, but based mainly on logic and sources. Things like these are never released officially till much after the fact, but it is accepted as a fact by pretty much all notable sources. It creates a real nightmare for any player's article during the offseason. Another alternative is to mention that official he is a free agent and add a section on apparent signing by the Bulls. <a href="../../../y/a/n/User%7EYanksox_34ed.html" title="User:Yanksox"><font color="black">Yank</font></a><a href="../../../y/a/n/User_talk%7EYanksox_f66e.html" title="User talk:Yanksox"><font color="red">sox</font></a> 04:58, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p><br />
I agree with the latter of these options. One point being that, until a contract has officially been signed, there's always the remote chance that Ben could have a change of heart (It's rare, but it has happened). Technically, he has not been acquired by anyone, and is not currently a member of any team. The latter of the options you present (labeling him a free agent, having a section regarding his agreeing to terms with the Bulls), accurately describe Ben's current situaton. Venknat 05:23, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>OMG, how dumb is this, if Ben changes his mind all you have to do is take the info about Ben on Chicago, thats it short and simple! --<a href="../../../p/h/b/User%7EPhbasketball6_8fc1.html" title="User:Phbasketball6">Phbasketball6</a> 15:26, 5 July 2006 (UTC) Ok Ok, good point and I agree. --<a href="../../../p/h/b/User%7EPhbasketball6_8fc1.html" title="User:Phbasketball6">Phbasketball6</a> 16:25, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The point is that he actually isn't a member of the Bulls yet. He can't be until the 12th. Thus, it's factually wrong to put him in as a Bull until then. The fact that you can remove premature statements isn't an excuse for making them in the first place. Venknat 15:56, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>It's better off to still leave him with the Pistons and add a ref about the singing with the Bulls in the lead and in a paragraph, then when the deal is official, the lead can be changed. I'm going to do that right now and a currentsport tag.

<p>guys, lets just put the following on the main page:</p>
<p>ben wallace has verbally agreed to play for the bulls in the 2006-07 season like on the nazr mohammed page and the peja stojakovic page says. he hasnt signed a contract with the bulls, therefore is not a bulls player, but he has agreed so thats the fact and lets put that on the page. all those in agreement say so below. --<a href="../../../b/u/c/User%7EBucsrsafe_541f.html" title="User:Bucsrsafe">Bucsrsafe</a> 11:10, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Ok, I've stepped in and made this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ben_Wallace&amp;curid=510075&amp;diff=63692994&amp;oldid=63692599" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ben_Wallace&amp;curid=510075&amp;diff=63692994&amp;oldid=63692599" rel="nofollow">edit</a> regarding Wallace's status. It's pretty much the status quo to immedially change the team name when a player switches over, however, I guess there is a chance that something will happen. Personally, as a Celtic fan, I wish he was here. Anyways, let's try to settle issues like this here on the talk and not in a 3RR war. <a href="../../../y/a/n/User%7EYanksox_34ed.html" title="User:Yanksox"><font color="black">Yank</font></a><a href="../../../y/a/n/User_talk%7EYanksox_f66e.html" title="User talk:Yanksox"><font color="red">sox</font></a> 00:05, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Agreed that this is the status quo. And plus, since this IS wikipedia, we can change the article as new events happen. But for now, he is a Chicago Bull.

<p>My resons for relisting the Chicago Bulls players category is that: 1. The wikipedia article refers to Ben Wallace as a Chicago Bull in the first paragraph. Not listing an appropriate category is makes the article inconsistant. 2. The NBA officially recognizes Ben Wallace as a Chicago Bull. 3. The category is Chicago Bulls players, which I interpret as players associated with the Chicago Bulls (as players obviously). Ben Wallace is associated with the Chicago Bulls at this moment, so he should be in the category. 4. If something happens between now and the start of the season, then we can make the necessary changes then. But for now, we have to keep this up to date. I mean, this IS Wikipedia after all.</p>
<p>Anyway that's my offical stand on this issue, and I think we should leave the article like this for consistancy purposes. <a href="../../../d/k/n/User%7EDknights411_f51b.html" title="User:Dknights411">Dknights411</a> 23:41, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The article says "Coincidentally, Oakley also attended Virginia Union as well". Wallace turned to Oakley after graduating, and he referred him to VU.</p>
<p>Here's the relevant fact: (<a href="http://www.truehoop.com/chicago-bulls-27651-from-the-archives-a-ben-wallace-feature-article.html" class="external free" title="http://www.truehoop.com/chicago-bulls-27651-from-the-archives-a-ben-wallace-feature-article.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.truehoop.com/chicago-bulls-27651-from-the-archives-a-ben-wallace-feature-article.html</a>)</p>
<p>"Oakley steered Wallace to Cuyahoga Community College, near Oakley’s childhood home in Cleveland, Ohio. As a sophomore, he averaged 24 points, 17 rebounds and seven blocks per game. When his two years there were complete, Oakley helped Wallace transfer to his own alma mater, Virginia Union. "</p>
<p>Could someone correct this fact as I'm not a native English speaker? --Duopixel 05:21, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have deleted a subject about Harold Lee. I think that is the action of a fan of Ben Wallace. I hope that I have done the right thing :P Towerman86 18:30, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
