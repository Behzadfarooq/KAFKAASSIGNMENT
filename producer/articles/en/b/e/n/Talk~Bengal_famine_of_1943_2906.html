<p>I was reading the "Famines and democracies" part, and i know most of things said is probaly true, but it seemed pretty biased against the British, since it near enough suggested that when the british gone, the indian just magically had enough corn to feed everyone, whill in reality in 1960 they nearly had a mass famine, and the only reason it did not happen was due to a new type of corn.</p>
<p>"In 1961 Borlaug was invited to visit India by M. S. Swaminathan, adviser to the Indian minister of agriculture. India was on the brink of mass famine. Huge shipments of food aid from America were all that stood between its swelling population and a terrible fate. One or two people were starting to say the unsayable. After an epiphany in a taxi in a crowded Delhi street, the environmentalist Paul Ehrlich wrote a best-seller arguing that the world had “too many people”. Not only could America not save India; it should not save India. Mass starvation was inevitable, and not just for India, but for the world.</p>
<p>Borlaug refused to be so pessimistic. He arrived in India in March 1963 and began testing three new varieties of Mexican wheat. The yields were four or five times better than Indian varieties. In 1965, after overcoming much bureaucratic opposition, Swaminathan persuaded his government to order 18,000 tonnes of Borlaug's seed. Borlaug loaded 35 trucks in Mexico and sent them north to Los Angeles. The convoy was held up by the Mexican police, stopped at the border by United States officials and then held up by the National Guard when the Watts riots prevented them reaching the port. Then, as the shipment eventually sailed, war broke out between India and Pakistan.</p>
<p>As it happened, the war proved a godsend, because the state grain monopolies lost their power to block the spread of Borlaug's wheat. Eager farmers took it up with astonishing results. By 1974, India wheat production had tripled and India was self-sufficient in food; it has never faced a famine since. In 1970 Norman Borlaug was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for firing the first shot in what came to be called the “green revolution”."</p>

<p>The article <a href="http://www.vho.org/tr/2003/1/Pfitzner71-75.html" class="external text" title="http://www.vho.org/tr/2003/1/Pfitzner71-75.html" rel="nofollow">"The Unknown Famine Holocaust"</a> by Wolfgang Pfitzner, listed under References, is from <a href="http://www.vho.org/tr/index.html" class="external text" title="http://www.vho.org/tr/index.html" rel="nofollow"><i>The Revisionist</i></a>, a Holocaust revisionism journal. This raises the possibility that the article may be propaganda biased to make Britain look worse than it really was, so that Germany looks less bad in comparison. I'm not qualified to judge the article's scholastic merits but it looks all right to me. Can someone else check to confirm that the article (as opposed to the journal) seems more or less reasonable? If so then I suggest the link be left as is. <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJacob_Eliosoff_be07.html" title="User:Jacob Eliosoff">Jacob Eliosoff</a> 04:14, 4 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Izehar- The link MUST have a disclaimer added to it. It seems to my reading that much of the article is based upon it, and as a reference it is very poor. Readers who do not actively follow the link would not be aware of the nature of the 'journal' in which it is featured, which is a platform for Holocaust revisionism. The Pfitzner article clearly espouses a certain (to my mind, and I believe to almost any reader's mind, distasteful)point of view (it is a rather unsubtle attempt to justify the Nazi program of extermination in occupied (particularly eastern) Europe, and far worse than that is obviously non-neutral and not a work of disinterested academic intent, It is obviously politically biased, and therefore in my opinion not a reliable source.</p>
<p>I include an (unfortuantely long) verbatim quote to give a flavour as to the nature of the 'scholarship' (sorry for reproducing such a large portion, I do not believe this breaches copyright, and I do not want to be accused of quoting out of context):</p>
<p><b>During recent years, the young German historian Christian Gerlach has become known for his examination of the food policy of the Third Reich during the Second World War. In two monographs he claimed that the Third Reich, based on experiences gained during the First World War, did everything to ensure that the German population would not suffer from hunger during the war. To this purpose, the food resources of occupied territories were used to cover German needs, by conscious neglect of the nutritional needs of the local population. According to Gerlach, this was especially true for eastern territories which were under temporary German occupation during the Russian campaign. Consequently, Gerlach's two books addressing this topic, which were published by the communist publisher Jan Philipp Reemtsma, have telling titles: Krieg, Ernährung, Völkermord (War, nutrition and genocide) and Kalkulierte Morde: Die Deutsche Wirtschafts- und Vernichtungspolitik in Weißrußland 1941 bis 1944 (Calculated Murders: The German Economical and Extermination Policy in White Russia 1941 to 1944).[15] Gerlach is certainly correct in so far as the government of the Reich placed a higher priority on the nutrition of the fighting troops and its own people than on the nourishment of essentially non-participating population groups in occupied areas. In this respect the policy of Great Britain resembles that of Germany at this time, both forced by purely war related issues. There is, however, a fine difference: whilst the nutritional situation in the German occupied zones of the Soviet Union was disastrous in some areas not due to German measures, but because of Stalin's policy of 'scorched earth' during the Soviet retreat--a fact to which Gerlach hardly gives his attention--the corresponding scarcity and inflation in India was essentially the consequence of British policy. <i>Unfortunately it also has to be stated here that, as always, actual or alleged German atrocities receive one-sided and often distorted attention in the public mind, whereas balanced descriptions and comparative studies of similar events which occurred elsewhere in the world are generally avoided. That could put in doubt the alleged uniqueness of the German 'evilness', and this is, as is generally known, politically incorrect and thus undesirable.</i></b></p>
<p>I hope that what the author is driving at in the above passage is obvious, as it certainly is not very subtly hidden. Feel free to browse the 'journal' for other examples of similar sentiments. It is not clear to me that this article has been subjected to ANY kind of peer review, and I would be extremely circumspect about its use as a secondary source for a wikipedia article. As I described in my original comment (below) it makes sense to leave the link so as to allow readers to assess the quality of the sources for the wikiarticle, but not without a disclaimer for those (the majority?) who DO NOT choose to follow the link. It should CERTAINLY be made clear to the reader what this source is, and in fact I personally wonder whether this kind of link should be included in a general-interest wiki entry at all (general interest= one not specifically pertaining to neo-Nazism, anti-semitism, or Holocaust revisionism). However, my opinion as an individual is irrelevent- I have reverted one last time, as I do not believe a 'Reader Beware' caveat is at all inappropriate, and is indeed only an alternative to deleting the link completely. If the page is reverted again, I suggest we seek an external opinion as to the issues at hand? In any case, the wikiarticle is of a very poor quality and should itself be labelled with a clean up/neutrality disputed disclaimer, in my opinion. I should stress that I have no overt political views on this subject, and it is not an area in which I have particular expertise. I believe the points I have made would be echoed by any interested reader. Please feel free to comment here.</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>

<p>I'm a little confused here. If the figures given are accurate, 1943 ranked 5th out of the 6 years (1938-1943) given. Unless they were all bumper crops, how does coming 5th out of 6 make 1943 a bumper crop&#160;?</p>

<p>V. badly written. Some parts obviously factually incorrect and internally inconsistent (see '1943 A Bumper Crop' comment above.) The use of the article from the neo-Nazi journal is particularly disagreable. I would suggest as a start: a) attempting to remove non-neutral point-of-view statements ('The diseased rice crop story needs careful re-examination <i>and certainly does not deserve the importance that has been bestowed on it</i>.'); b) DIRECTLY referencing facts and statements in the text using academic style (e.g. 'blah blah blah (Sen, 1984)') so as to differentiate between sources. If, as it seems to my reading, much of this is influenced by the Pfitzner article (which in essence attempts to excuse and mitigate the Nazi extermination policy) then there is a very serious problem here. I leave the link as it is only so as to allow readers to assess the reliability of the source for themselves. This is an interesting subject that deserves a fuller and more rigorous treatment.</p>

<p>I have removed the reference to rice imports from Burma due to Japanese occupation. To restore this reference there should be a source cited showing how important these imports were compared to total consumption. 68.104.78.238 19:49, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Burma was the world's largest exporter of rice in the inter-war period, the British having encouraged production by Burmese smallholders, which resulted a virtual monoculture in the Irrawady delta and Arakan, with most of the trade in the hands of Chinese and Madrassis - Nicholas Tarling (Ed.) <i>The Cambridge History of SouthEast Asia</i> Vol.II Part 1 pp139-40. Bayly &amp; Harper, in <i>Forgotten Armies. The Fall of British Asia 1941-45</i>(London: Allen Lane) 2004 p284 state that by 1940 15% of India's rice overall came from Burma, whilst in Bengal the proportion is likely to have been higher given the province's proximity to Burma (They cite documents from the India Office Library in support of this, and to be honest it ought to be fairly easy to establish more precisely). It seems unlikely, however, that it can have amounted to more than 20-30% of Bengal's consumption, and neither they, nor anyone else as far as I know, claims it was the sole cause of the famine (they cite, amongst other things, the 'scorched earth' policy in the Chittagong region, excessive exports to the Middle East and Ceylon, the cyclone of the 16th October 1942, the lack of a 'famine code' in Bengal, unlike most other provinces of British India, the corruption of the Bengal Provincial Government of the time, the laziness and incompetence of many of the ICS in the province, and the hostility of the War Cabinet and Leo Amery, the Secretary of State for India, in the face of the Quit India movement and wartime demands). However, I do think it deserves a mention, together with the other reasons outlined above. The other thing which could be mentioned is the prevalence of famine in India before British rule, and the measures taken by rulers to relieve it. This would not invalidate Amartya Sen's democracy thesis, but to my mind probably suggest that the idea that a Government has a responsibility to prevent its subjects from starving is of relatively recent origin, whilst the transport networks and systems of price control and procurement needed to relieve a famine on this scale did not even exist before the 19th century. <a href="../../../s/i/k/User%7ESikandarji_ae16.html" title="User:Sikandarji">Sikandarji</a> 00:47, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have reverted from Pentaholmes version which said "outbreak of the disease caused almost complete destruction of the rice crop." This is obviously at odds with the figures provided by the Nobel Laureate Amartya Sen. Pentaholmes has cited a 1973 article in an obscure journal which is obviously not easily available. He or she should provide specific passages from that article which would back the claim of "almost complete destruction".</p>
<ul>
<li>The data provided by Sen is the data with no source, Padmanabhan data was actually collected in the field during the 1940s. Where did Sen get his data, and as the more recent analysis of Sens' data points out, Sen's entitlement approach overlooks the problems of food shortage.

<dd>Amartya Sen's data came from government official records. Do you really believe that a Nobel Laureate would base work which he considers important on "data with no source"? You are welcome to include criticisms of Amartya Sen's approach. However you should remove confusing and factually wrong information about "rice disease". You seem to be doing in stages, I see the claim "complete destruction of the rice crop" has been removed. You should also remove statements like "15 to 90% crop loss in some areas" if you cannot specify what exactly "some areas" means. And your statement "Padmanabhan's data shows that the rice harvest in 1942 was about one third the size of that in 1941." is obviously wrong if it refers to the total harvest in 1942. If it does not refer to the total harvest then you should specify which particular district (or region) the statement refers to. Besides the issue is harvest in 1943, so it is not clear why you refer to a low harvest in 1942. When these corrections have been made I doubt "rice disease" will be important enough to merit being at the top of the article.</dd>

<dd>If Amartya Sen says he got it from "Official Government" records isn't that good enough? After all the man is a Nobel Laureate, if he lied I am sure that would have been amply pointed out. And your edits are getting more confusing with time. A reader has no idea what "Bankura and Chinsurah" are. Are these regions significant, what is their production compared to total production? The topic is "Bengal Famine", not "Bankura and Chinsurah Famine". Is the shortfall more towards 15% or towards 90%? The more I press, the more the weakness of your data becomes apparent. It has gone from "complete destruction of the rice crop" to "15 to 90% shortfall" to "15 to 90% shortfall in Bankura and Chinsurah". I think it is becoming obvious that the mention of "rice disease" should be dumped.

<dd>You keep doubting Amartya Sen's data. Here is what Kenneth Arrow (another Nobel Laureate and regarded by many as the greatest economist ever) has to say about Sen's work: "the first of which Sen analyzes in the greatest detail. The 1943 crop of rice and other foods was somewhat low, especially in relation to the extraordinarily large harvest of 1942, but it was distinctly higher than the crop of 1941, which was not a famine year. Sen finds that the per capita availability of food supply was 9 percent higher in 1943 than in 1941 and only about 10 percent less than the average of the five preceding years." <a href="http://www.finance.commerce.ubc.ca/~bhatta/BookReview/arrow_on_sen's_poverty_and_famine.html" class="external free" title="http://www.finance.commerce.ubc.ca/~bhatta/BookReview/arrow_on_sen's_poverty_and_famine.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.finance.commerce.ubc.ca/~bhatta/BookReview/arrow_on_sen's_poverty_and_famine.html</a> <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayanta_Sen_1e6a.html" title="User:Jayanta Sen">Jayanta Sen</a> 22:08, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Reading the first paper I conclude it is quite worthless in this discussion. You should note two things about this paper: 1) It has data only for yeild per acre (This is useless unless we know what fraction of total acreage resided in these regions) 2) It is for 1942 (which cannot be used to contradict Amartya Sen's argument that the 1943 harvest was not unusually low)</dd>

<dd>The second paper by Mark Tauger does two things 1) It makes arugments similar to yours based on Padmanabhan's paper. The problems with this remain as listed above 2) It nitpicks the methodology adopted by the Famine Inquiry Commission, but doesn't provide an alternative source for total (not specific regions like Bankura and Chinsurah) production. I would say that given the absence of alternative sources, one should proceed with government supplied statistics (especially as any bias in these a British-government controlled Indian government statistics would be against Amartya Sen's hypothesis). <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayanta_Sen_1e6a.html" title="User:Jayanta Sen">Jayanta Sen</a> 22:35, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/n/Talk%7EBengal_famine_of_1943_2906.html" title="Edit section: Debate about Diseased Rice and Total Rice Yield in 1942 and 1943">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Debate about Diseased Rice and Total Rice Yield in 1942 and 1943</span></h3>
<p>In the <a href="../../../r/i/c/Rice.html" title="Rice">rice</a> growing season of <a href="../../../1/9/4/1942.html" title="1942">1942</a>, weather conditions were exactly right to encourage an epidemic of the rice disease brown spot following a cyclone and flooding. Brown spot in rice is caused by the <a href="../../../f/u/n/Fungi.html" title="Fungi">fungus</a> <i>Helminthosporium oryzae</i>; the outbreak of the disease caused a variation in the 1942 crop ranging from a 236.6% gain to a 90% crop loss in Bankura and Chinsurah according to mycologist S.Y. Padmanabhan.</p>
<p>Mark Tauger argues that Sen's analysis based economic entitlement overlooks the role of food shortage. Tauger argues that that the yield in 1942 was low (based on Padmanabhan's data) causing a serious food shortage in Bengal and was the most important cause of the famine. Padmanabhan produces data for rice varieties in these two regions, and the yield per acre from 1941 to 1942 varies from a gain of 236.6% (Bhutmuri variety in Chinsurah) to a loss of 91.2% (Dandkhani variety in Bankura). Of 42 varieties 41 show losses, some small some large.</p>
<p>Padmanabhan's data cannot be used to draw inferences and hence Tauger's argument can be criticised for two reasons: 1) Padmanabhan does not give the number of acres sown for the different varieties of rice. Depending upon the acreage it would be consistent with his data that the production in 1942 was actually larger than 1941. 2) Padmanabhan's data is not for total rice production but only yield per acre for two regions in Bengal, namely Bankura and Chinsurah. &lt; The one estimate that we have for the total rice production in Bengal (not yield per acre of particular varieties in particular regions) is Famine Inquiry Commission set up by the British-controlled Indian government after the famine (and used by Sen). Tauger offers a criticism of the methodology used by the Famine Inquiry Commission, arguing that it was based on expected (rather than actual) yield pre acre multiplied by acreage.</p>
<p><br />
From Mark Tauger:</p>
<p>The above discussion of my work is not accurate and is misleading. Interested readers can read my article "Entitlement, Shortage, and the 1943 Bengal Famine: Another Look," Journal of Peasant Studies vol. 31 no. 1, October 2003, which is posted on my website in PDF: <a href="http://www.as.wvu.edu/history/Faculty/Tauger/" class="external free" title="http://www.as.wvu.edu/history/Faculty/Tauger/" rel="nofollow">http://www.as.wvu.edu/history/Faculty/Tauger/</a> . Here I will briefly respond to two problems in the above statement.</p>
<p>We should begin with the last paragraph, which refers to the following works: Famine Inquiry Commission, Report on Bengal (1944; reprint by USHA, New Delhi, 1984, hereafter FIC1), and Famine Inquiry Commission, Final Report (1945; reprint by USHA, New Delhi, 1984, hereafter FIC2).</p>
<p>FIC1 has a long appendix on production data: Appendix II: Production and consumption of Rice in Bengal (FIC1 202-212). The gist of this appendix is that the Commission had essentially no reliable concrete data on the 1942 harvest and had to resort to all kinds of indirect means to come up with what they themselves acknowledged was an extremely approximate and speculate estimate of food production and consumption. In the process they examined estimates by Mahalonobis and noted that "Many other estimates have been made in the past..." (204) FIC2 has a special chapter devoted to the issue of statistics which emphasizes that the events of the War showed the need for accurate statistics, which of course means that they recognized that they did not have accurate statistics. In my article I present much more evidence that these statistics and the methods used to produce them were such that the data do not qualify as harvest data.</p>
<p>So the above statement that the one estimate we have for price production is that of the FIC is not entirely accurate and does not acknowledge the great uncertainty about that estimate. Then, I did not merely "offer a criticism" of the Famine Enquiry Commission's estimate; I simply restated what the Commission itself and many, virtually all officials and specialists who dealt with these data recognized: the data were not actual harvest data and were not accurate. This is not my criticism, this is the criticism of vitually everyone who dealt with those data at the time and who knew perfectly well what was wrong with it. Here for example is was FIC1 wrote in discussing their estimates of rice supplies, p. 13: "The defects in the relevant statistics are familiar. They have been commented upon by various Commission and Committees from time to time and need not be recapitulated here. We must, however, make the best use we can of available information ..."</p>
<p>The assertion earlier in the above section that "Padmanahbhan's data cannot be used to draw inferences" is not correct. Readers will notice that the author of that section did not provide any evidence or analysis as to why those data cannot be used for inference. I provided in my article considerable evidence and analysis to support that these data can be so used, evidence and analysis that derived from the expert specialist knowledge of plant pathologists in India at that time and afterwards.</p>
<p>The evidence, which can be found in my article and in Padmadabhan's, shows that the rice infestation in the Aman crop in 1942, the main rice crop, affected every variety of rice that the plant pathologists were testing, and that this devastating effect resulted both from the exceptional character of the variety of the plant disease and the extremely propitious weather conditions that affected virtually all of Bengal.</p>
<p>The above section's assertion that because Padmanabhan did not give acreage, his data could support the conclusion that the harvest in 1932 was larger than that of 1941, is not correct: all varieties were significantly reduced by the plant disease in the 1942 Aman harvest. The above section's criticism that Padmanabhan's data are only yields and not total harvests is invalid for two reasons. First, it leaves out the evidence that the infestations developed in both rice research stations because of weather conditions that covered most of Bengal for an extended period at just the right time in the growing season to harm the rice crops. Second, it omits the fact that the tropical cyclone that contributed to those weather conditions also destroyed huge areas of crops, thereby reducing the total cropland substantially below that of the previous year.</p>
<p>Further evidence of the seriousness of the infestation is that it affected the previous crop as well, which means that it lasted over a long period, which could not have been the case unless the weather conditions were conducive.</p>
<p>Since that fungal disease was so destructive and the weather conditions so pervasive, it is extremely difficult to avoid the conclusion that the disease affected the rice crop very widely throughout Bengal in 1942. That is why Padmanabhan argued in his article that the Bengal famine resembled the Irish famine of 1845-1848, which was also caused by an extremely destructive plant disease.</p>
<p>The author of the above section failed to note that Padmanabhan worked as a plant pathologist in Bengal during the famine and was a specialist eyewitness to these events, and that when he published the article I used, in 1973, he was the director of rice research for all of India. He was not just some mycologist, he was a very experience and knowledgeable specialist, and his views cannot be dismissed with an unsupported assertion that his data "cannot be used to draw inferences." They can be used to draw inferences, and the unambiguous inference from them, which Padmanabhan drew on the basis of his own experience of that crisis and his and his colleagues' specialist knowledge of this disease, was that this famine resulted first of all from a complex of natural disasters that devastated Bengal's rice harvest in 1942. <i>(The bulk of the above, starting 'From Mark Tauger' was added by user Mbtauger on 5 March 2006).</i></p>
<p><i>End section removed from main page by <a href="../../../i/m/c/User%7EImc_99b2.html" title="User:Imc">Imc</a></i></p>
<p>I would say that my discussion was neither "not accurate" nor "misleading". Consider for example:</p>
<p>1) Both the criticisms I made about applying Padmanabhan's data to infer total rice production are factually correct, and not contradicted by Mark Tauger. To wit, Padmanabhan's data is only for two districts of Bengal and the condition in the other districts could have been very different. (In fact the conditions in the "rice research stations" could be very different from what was actually present in the field.) Additionally, as different varieties of rice show different yields, we need to know the acreage under each variety to be able to infer total production. Alternatively we need to know the fraction of each variety in total production. For example, if the bulk of rice production was Bhutmuri Aus, then Padmanabhan's data is consistent with larger production in 1942.</p>
<p>2) Mark Tauger criticizes what I wrote saying "Readers will notice that the author of that section did not provide any evidence or analysis as to why those data cannot be used for inference." I am at a loss. I very clearly mentioned (in point form no less) why it cannot be used. Once again, it is yield per acre for different varieties and not total production, and that it is for two districts only.</p>
<p>3) Mark Tauger writes "all varieties were significantly reduced by the plant disease in the 1942 Aman harvest." True, but what he does not mention is that the Bhutmuri Aus yield in Chinsurah went up by 236% (from 372 kg/ha to 1252 kg/ha)!!! We need to know what the relative size of the Aus harvest compared to the Aman harvest was. Padmanabhan's math seemed to fail him when it came to calculating this increase and he merely left the entry blank (page 15 of his article). This huge jump also leads one to suspect the operations of the rice research stations, whether this data really means something or is it just noise. How does yield for a variety jump more than threefold in one year is to say the least very mysterious.</p>
<p>4) As for my failing to note "Padmanabhan worked as a plant pathologist...". I am sure if Tauger regards that as important then he can add that information. That is how Wikipedia works. I am sure any reader would realize that Padmanabhan has some expertise in the matter given that he wrote a paper on it, whether that expertise needs to be explicitly mentioned is a personal taste.</p>
<p>etc. etc.</p>
<p>I argue that the evidence Padmanabhan and Tauger present is not sufficient to reach their conclusion. Yes, there are problems with FIC data as they themselves acknowledge. However the government officials who formed the FIC estimates were doing something that they had experience in, and it is doubtful if they would be satisfied compiling spurious data. I believe it again becomes a matter of personal taste whether to put more faith in the FIC data for total yields or inferences about total yields based on Padmanabhan's data for yields per acre from two districts.</p>

<p>"No famines since independence, no famines..." the article claims again and again. This is not true. There was a famine in <a href="../../../k/e/r/Kerala.html" title="Kerala">Kerala</a> in the 1960s, more than a decade after independence. Rice was scarce in the Bengal Famine of 1943; it was also scarce in Kerala in the 1960s.</p>
<p>However, Malayalees were not driven to the desperate measures portrayed in <a href="../../../a/s/h/Ashani_Sanket_725f.html" title="Ashani Sanket">Ashani Sanket</a>. The U.S. was, at the time, somewhat concerned about winning the support of the Malayalee people in the battle against communist influence. As part of its effort to gain support, it supplied American flour to Kerala. Apparently, Malayalees often tried to trade this flour for rice that was apparently "inferior" and "stinky."</p>
<p>I am therefore thinking of getting rid of the false statements in this article claiming that there have been no famines since 1947. If anyone disagrees, please discuss your views here.

<dd>The reason why these sentences are there is to help the reader understand what may have caused the famine.

I'm sure it's true, though, that there have been no famines quite as severe as the Bengal famine of 1943.</p>
<p>Let me begin with a few unsourced claims based on hearsay:</p>
<p>1. There may have been a famine in Bihar in the 1960s. (Wikipedia seems to consider this a "near miss" rather than an actual famine, but it's usually called the "Bihar Famine," and I have my doubts. Some online sources claim that a famine did occur; others deny it. I cannot say at this point which is true.)<br />
2. In Kerala, few deaths occurred as a result of the American effort...in the CITIES. However, in rural areas, it seems people did die as a result of famine.<br />
3. In coastal villages in Andhra Pradesh, famines occur every year as a result of flood. Relief efforts have begun to succeed only recently.</p>
<p>And now, for a few links:</p>
<p>1. According to <a href="http://www.swaminarayan.org/activities/relief/index.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.swaminarayan.org/activities/relief/index.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, a famine occurred in Gujarat and Maharashtra between 1974-1975. Relief efforts had helped somewhat, but the famine intensified in 1975 nevertheless. In 1987, another famine occurred in Saurashtra (Gujarat) due to flood and drought, described on this website as "this century's worst famine." (Perhaps this is going a bit too far, or it is not taking into account any famines before 1974.)</p>
<p>2. A doctoral thesis under the title <i>Democracy, Drought, and Starvation in India: Testing Sen in Theory in Practice</i> (<a href="http://folk.uio.no/danbanik/phdthesis.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://folk.uio.no/danbanik/phdthesis.htm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>) might be a useful read that might help us determine in greater detail whether or not there was a famine...and whether it is fair to say that Independent India has "never had a famine." --<a href="../../../k/u/a/User%7EKuaichik_94fe.html" title="User:Kuaichik">Kuaichik</a> 17:32, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This is a good link, the thesis by Dan Banik. I think he considers the important issues, and the question of famines vs. malnutrition and limited starvation. It would be a stretch to say that there have been no deaths due to malnutrition in India since independence. Defining famine becomes a question of degree. I would say that a famine is an event which has significantly more people dying than usual. That is not to say deaths due to malnutrition are unimportant, or something we should be unconcerned about. But the word "famine" has a specific popularly accepted meaning. I do not wish to take on the role of arbiter of the meanings of words, but I do believe that in popular usage famine refers to something out of the ordinary. For example, a well known famine is the "Irish Potato Famine" which claimed 500,000 to 1 million lives, with 2 more million escaping it by emigrating to the US and other countries. Prior to this famine I would think there were some Irish dying due to malnutrition, yet that situation was not described as a famine. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayanta_Sen_1e6a.html" title="User:Jayanta Sen">JS</a> 20:52, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Useful question, but you may have to define famine more carefully first. Since there is considerable malnutrition in India at the best of times, and it always causes some 'routine' deaths, how do you judge what increase in deaths constitutes a famine? Do livestock deaths count? Droughts occur regularly without being judged as famines. The 1974/75 case might be called a famine by the Swaminarayan mission, because it enables them to publicise themselves, and not called such by governments because it makes them looks better. If the discussion is limited to the major uncontested famines, that at least simplifies matters. <a href="../../../i/m/c/User%7EImc_99b2.html" title="User:Imc">Imc</a> 17:09, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><i>...you may have to define famine more carefully first.</i></p>
<p>My point exactly, Imc! As I meant to say in my last comment: the thesis questioning Sen's claims might help us determine what was a famine (and therefore whether or not there was a famine). We <i>must</i> clarify what we mean by "famine," for depending on what we mean, it may or may not be true that "Independent India never had a famine."</p>
<p>If we mean what you call "major uncontested famines," then certainly that claim is true: there has never been a <i>major <b>uncontested</b> famine</i> in Independent India. I hope <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayanta_Sen_1e6a.html" title="User:Jayanta Sen">Jayanta Sen</a> rejoins this discussion, so we can productively decide on a definition. --<a href="../../../k/u/a/User%7EKuaichik_94fe.html" title="User:Kuaichik">Kuaichik</a> 18:08, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, sorry, it was your point first! I must spend a bit more time reading before I reply. Cheers. <a href="../../../i/m/c/User%7EImc_99b2.html" title="User:Imc">Imc</a> 15:02, 21 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Nah, I apologize...I could've made that point a little bit clearer&#160;:) --<a href="../../../k/u/a/User%7EKuaichik_94fe.html" title="User:Kuaichik">Kuaichik</a> 19:01, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
