<dd>Paul, we can't base an article on your personal knowledge: see <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>. It would be good to pin down what his actual qualifications are, and where he works as a physician, particularly as he's being used extensively as a WP source about a living person, and part of his complaint about that person is that the history of her academic qualifications is unclear. It would be unusual for someone with no background in philosophy to be allowed to do an M.A. in it at King's College, London, as his CV on that website seems to claim; or perhaps the website means he has an M.Phil (master of philosophy rather than master's in philosophy), but then why wouldn't it say which subject? It's an oddly worded CV, as anyone who knows the British education system will have noticed; for example, it mentions that one of the degrees was "British Academy funded," which only means a government grant, and that's not unusual. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 18:21, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ben Goldacre has had articles published in the BMJ. They're fairly careful about publishing work by impostors and frauds. Anyway, I'm sure if someone were to email Ben (an address is provided at badscience.net) the man himself could provide links to credible independent sites that would verify his qualifications, only someone more forward than me will have to do it.<a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamrifis_890d.html" title="User:Jamrifis">Jamrifis</a> 22:45, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><i>the history of her academic qualifications is unclear</i> Firstly, the history of her qualifications is a matter of record, so the history of his is irrelevant in this respect. Secondly, his awards are qualifications in themselves in that he received them for a large body of work that is publicly accessible. I would say that it is obvious on the available easily accessible evidence that his <b>writing</b> is regarded as first class. His writing is what he is notable for, and his writing is what the article is there for. He does not assert or imply that we should believe his statements because he is academically qualified, and in fact the Guardian does not even bother stating his qualifications any more. His articles mount arguments that are credible in themselves and on the sources he quotes from time to time. It is ridiculous to compare him to a charlatan. <a href="../../../p/h/a/User%7EPhaedrus86_4bd1.html" title="User:Phaedrus86">Phaedrus86</a> 23:02, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Regardless of anyone's personal opinion of Goldacre, the point is that we don't know what his qualifications are, and it would be good to know them, especially when he seems to have a postgraduate degree in philosophy but not an undergraduate one, which would be very unusual; and given that he highlights something very ordinary (a British Academy grant) on his CV as though it's something special, which is what he accuses his <i>bête noire</i>, Gillian McKeith, of having done in another context. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 23:27, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>His pg degree is an MPhil not an MA. An MPhil, like a PhD, does not have to be in philosophy - I assume you've read <a href="../../../m/a/s/Master_of_Philosophy_c1c7.html" title="Master of Philosophy">Master of Philosophy</a>. I don't know of <i>any</i> institution that awards "Master's of..." rather than "Master of" in the UK, so I don't know where you're going with that. See <a href="../../../m/a/s/Masters_degree.html" title="Masters degree">Masters degree</a>. And people who receive grants from the British Academy namecheck the their funding source as a matter of course. I don't see where you're going with that either? Hypnotist uk 23:47, 13 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Ok, I do see where you're going now, at least with the first part (and I was overconfident - he could well have done an MA or even an MSc from KCL); I'm not convinced, though, it matters whether he gained a master of philosophy or a masters in philosophy. There'd almost certainly be no need for him to do undergrad philosophy if he studied philosophy of science for example... Of course, we could always ask him.

<dd>The "of" refers to the title of the degree; the "in" refers to the subject studies. For example, an engineering student could get a Bachelor <b>of</b> Engineering, or a Bachelor of Science <b>in</b> Engineering. A music student could get a Bachelor <b>of</b> Music or a Bachelor of Arts <b>in</b> Music. My understanding is that an MA from Oxford is not something you study for; it's something awarded by Oxford University to its own graduates after a number of years, on payment of an administrative fee. A Master's degree by examination or thesis from Oxford (or Cambridge) would be an MPhil, or MLitt, or MRes, or MSc, or some other M., but not an MA. Goldacre's website says he has a Master's degree <b>in</b> Philosophy; it doesn't give the title of that degree. In any case, I think it <i>would</i> be unusual to have a postgraduate degree in philosophy without an undergraduate one. <a href="../../../e/l/i/User%7EElinorD_4da6.html" title="User:ElinorD">ElinorD</a> 00:08, 14 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I do actually have both 'real' and 'upgraded' Masters degrees from Cambridge. FWIW I paid no fee to turn my BA into an MA. In any case Goldacre has his Masters from KCL, which does not offer this kind of 'upgrade'. I also do not see why it would be unusual to have a postgrad in philosophy without an undergrad one - consider philosophy of science, for starters. Hypnotist uk 00:26, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Andy, it's not clear what the CV on his blog means. Normally in a biography, we say A obtained his B.A. in X in 1990; his M.A. in Y in 1994; and his Ph.D. in Z in 1997 from such-and-such an institution. We have none of those details with Goldacre. We don't know which degree he obtained from Oxford; maybe he left after the B.A. (which would be unusual in medicine). When did he do his M.A. in philosophy? Has he actually completed his medical studies? Which degrees does he have? Where is he employed as a physician? There's a distinct lack of detail in his CV.</dd>

<dd>Hypnotist, I don't understand your post. How do you know his degree is an M.Phil? That's not what the website said; it said he has a master's <b>in</b> philosophy. And I don't know anyone who would mention on their CV that the British Academy gave them a grant, because it's not a big deal. It's very strange to talk about a "British Academy-funded master's degree." In fact, it's particularly strange to, as it were, boast about it for a master's. It's harder to get one for a Ph.D., but to the best of my knowledge, not hard at all to get one for an M.A. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 00:12, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have already retracted some of what I said; I see your point about in/of, but not really why you find it a problem. Also, note he would be doing the masters degree as a postdoc. Indeed it is hard to get one for a PhD: "Rather, they must show that they are seeking support for advanced research at postdoctoral level (or equivalent).

The University of Leicester calls him Dr, and says "In his own words, Dr Ben Goldacre is a 'scientist, doctor, and guardian columnist, who reads every paper every day, has seen how the media works from the inside, and who gets into big fights about it with humanities graduate journalists at parties.'"<a href="http://www2.le.ac.uk/ebulletin/events/2000-2009/2005/jan/npevent-8fc-5c7-55c" class="external autonumber" title="http://www2.le.ac.uk/ebulletin/events/2000-2009/2005/jan/npevent-8fc-5c7-55c" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>. So. Are there any <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> sources that even come close to questioning his qualifications? Nobody has posted any. I don't know why there's a seeming drive to do <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> here (going by <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> - I could speculate...) but we do have a fair few credible sources calling him a doctor and talking about his work and his academic background, and we have <i>nothing</i> calling that into question. So why is this even under discussion? Hypnotist uk 01:48, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>But Hypnotist, this is supposed to be a biography and we don't know what his qualifications are or where he works. Does he have a B.A. from Oxford, or a B.M, B.Ch, and if the latter isn't from Oxford, where is it from and when did he get it; or an M.D., which I doubt, but it's possible, and if so, from where and when? And when did he get his master's in phil? It's odd that he offers none of this information on his online CV, particularly as his current big thing is to criticize someone else for being a bit murky about dates and institutions. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 20:31, 16 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Firstly, I don't believe he's criticising others for being murky about dates and institutions - he's rather more specific than that. Secondly, even if he was, that has nothing to do with the biographical information in article. Thirdly, it seems to me that he's being quite clear in the information he does and doesn't want publicly stated - can I remind you of <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html#Presumption_in_favor_of_privacy" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP#Presumption_in_favor_of_privacy</a>? Fourthly the bios are quite clear in any case: he graduated from Oxford with a first. Since he's 32, and most British students enter university at 18, that means he would have been at Oxford 1992-1995. His first would have been a BA in Medical Sciences. It's also clear (from the article!) that he then went on to do his clinical medicine at UCL, where he got his doctorate. As I said below there are numerous sources repeating that he studied at Oxford and then at UCL and is now a qualified doctor working in the NHS. Yes, there are a few pieces of uncertainty but that's because there are no sources stating his exact CV - and by <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>, if they ain't there, we ain't allowed to fill in the holes.

<dd>There's no indication at all that he has a doctorate. I've looked to see whether he details his qualifications anywhere and he doesn't that I can see; and I'm pretty sure that if he mentions having a British Academy-funded master's, which really isn't a big deal, he'd say if he had a doctorate. I'm not suggesting we fill in the holes. I'm only making the point that there's a hint of the pot calling the kettle black. He has furnished the public with an incomplete and unclear CV — which has led you to form the impression, for example, that he has a doctorate when he may not — but then he accuses others of having done the same, with great vitriol, as though it's a hanging offense. I know there are important differences between the two cases; I'm not suggesting complete parity. But I'm suggesting there's a distinct similarity. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 02:05, 17 February 2007 (UTC)

And that's just from a few minutes with google. As far as I know, nobody is going to the ASA to claim he's not a doctor, either. I've asked already, but I will ask again: what possible evidence do you have for doubting his doctorate? Is there any one single source you can quote that might call it into question? And if you find the idea that he's a real doctor that hard to believe, why don't you ring up UCL and ask - as he has already challenged any doubters to do?

<dd>Not all physicians have doctorates, Hypnotist. In the UK, physicans who have bachelor's degrees are allowed to call themselves "doctor," but it's just an honorary thing; it doesn't mean they are <a href="../../../d/o/c/Doctor_of_Medicine_f48c.html" title="Doctor of Medicine">Doctors of Medicine</a>, which in the UK is a doctorate i.e. a research degree equivalent to a Ph.D. Anyway, this is a little off-topic for the page.

<dd>Ok, we're talking at cross-purposes. I doubt he has a (UK) MD or a PhD; I'm using 'doctorate' as shorthand for the qualifications necessary to become a qualified medical doctor, a la the US model. This certainly gives him the right to call himself 'Dr' which was the point I was making (honorary title or not, the meaning in this context is pretty clear). I understand from the badscience forums that he's currently a <a href="../../../s/p/e/Specialist_registrar.html" title="Specialist registrar">Specialist registrar</a>. As for your last comment: that's what I've been saying all along! We need verifiable sources questioning his qualifications, otherwise we should let this lie.

<p>Look, for whatever reason Slimvirgin is a pro-McKeith supporter. It doesn't matter what evidence we bring on here, he/she is just going to try and pick pathetic holes in it anyway. My impression is that whilst, via the column, Dr. Goldacre is in the public eye, he does not run around promoting an alternative lifestyle on the basis of qualifications. Rather, he argues for balanced rationalism and critical thinking. Now do you need to be <b>qualified</b> to think rationally these days?!? --<a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaulWicks_5018.html" title="User:PaulWicks">PaulWicks</a> 08:46, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>For what it's worth, he appears to be the Ben Michael Goldacre listed in the records of the UK's General Medical Council. Michael Harman 195.92.168.163 12:05, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>He has confirmed to me that he is indeed the Ben Michael Goldacre of the BMC listing. He has strongly criticized Gilliam McKeith for using the title “Doctor” when she does not appear to have that qualification from an institution generally recognized as qualified to confer that title.

<dd>The paypal link is buried in an entry in the archive, and he's also asking for someone to give him a flat... He's still flogging t-shirts and his book though. I assume that's just as heinous. Hypnotist uk 18:10, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Goodness! Look at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donate" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donate" rel="nofollow">top link on this page</a>! Perhaps we should delete all "unnecessary" links to pages on that site? <a href="../../../p/i/g/User%7EPigsonthewing_3a5b.html" title="User:Pigsonthewing">Andy Mabbett</a> 18:34, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a> only advises against linking to sites that "primarily exist to sell products or services" or that "require payment or registration to view the relevant content". Goldacre's site is obviously doing neither of these. --<a href="../../../m/c/g/User%7EMcGeddon_9720.html" title="User:McGeddon">McGeddon</a> 19:17, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Do I need to point out that websites aint free, the man is an NHS Doctor for lawd's sake. "The Bad Science Amazon Store is an incredibly exciting opportunity for me to make money for webhosting fees out of your innate desire to consume knowledge. There’s an expanding list of excellent books, click here and help me pay my webhosting fees:"<a href="http://www.badscience.net/?page_id=357" class="external text" title="http://www.badscience.net/?page_id=357" rel="nofollow">-from here</a>. To take this link hunt further we'ld have to remove the links to any and all webcomics (they either sell tshirts based on the strip or have a paypal donate button on their main page) <a href="../../../d/m/a/User%7EDmanning_3a1b.html" title="User:Dmanning">Dmanning</a> 22:41, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>How do I know he's joking? Are you joking now? Does using my sense of humour constitute original research? Maybe we should start a section on the page about this university Goldacre's trying to open in the Caymans. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamrifis_890d.html" title="User:Jamrifis">Jamrifis</a> 00:51, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
