This RfC was deleted only because the second user to certify the dispute, <a href="../../../t/b/e/User%7ETbeatty_05ec.html" title="User:Tbeatty">Tbeatty</a>, failed to provide proof that he had previously attempted to resolve the dispute; RfC was never decided on its own merits.</li>

<li>Note that this RfC was first certified by proxy by a banned user, then by a now-blocked puppet of the banned user with no significant edit history whatsoever, and only then (and in response to extensive canvassing) by one more editor who had not actually tried to resolve the dispute. Essentially of course, it was struck out as vexatious following a discussion on the admin noticeboard. Leaving aside Hinnen's conflict of interest, his attempt to portray this as a problem of one editor is a gross misrepresentation of the dispute. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 21:07, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Accusations of incivility may be balanced by accusations of legal threats, disruption, conflict of interest and general vexatiousness against other editors - to suggest that problems of civility and policy / guideline violation apply only to one side of this dispute is plainly false.</li>
<li>"Whether certain editors have been pursuing a political agenda in violation of <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, editing articles about conservative political figures and organizations (such as Free Republic) to make them more negative, and articles about liberal political figures and organizations (such as Democratic Underground) to make them more positive." - the two could just as easily be switched.

</ol>
<p>This is a bipartisan off-Wiki dispute brought to Wikipedia. Dean Hinnen claims to be the legal representative of one of the parties involved. His actions are seen by a number of admins as problematic, and that includes those who were a party to the discussions on the unblock list. I have no doubt that you will not be fooled by the slant that Hinnen puts on the dispute in his summary above, but he does appear to have forgotten to mention the off-Wiki dispute and his <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">conflict of interest</a>, so in fairness they need to be stated. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 16:38, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As one of the three editors mentioned by JzG above, I would like to certify JzG's following comments as accurate: "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:DeanHinnen#Not_a_sockpuppet" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:DeanHinnen#Not_a_sockpuppet" rel="nofollow">final judgment</a> is not a "committee" judgement, it's three admins who decided to <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> and give Dean Hinnen a chance as the "brother" of a banned user, on the basis that he promised not to be disruptive." It was not the intention of any of these three editors (as far as I am aware) to pass off the unblocking of DeanHinnen as anything other than this. Specifically, this was not a consensus of "all admins" such as one might claim after discussing the matter on WP:ANI or some such. I am unsure whether or not unblock-en-l should be classed as a committee. Nobody elected or even appointed us. However, to the best of my knowledge (and the list archives are still public), there was no significant dispute about unblocking DeanHinnen at the time. I am expressing no opinions on Hinnen's edits since the unblock, only certifying JzG's quoted statement as an accurate depiction. --<a href="../../../y/a/m/User%7EYamla_5f07.html" title="User:Yamla">Yamla</a> 21:17, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
