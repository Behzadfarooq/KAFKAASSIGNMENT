<p>I don't want to accuse you of it because I only have somewhat of a recollection and I could very well be wrong, but wasn't it you that made it "28 Labor, 3 Independent, 1 National, and 15 Liberal", because of the point I raised that the independents and national are with the government of the day?

<p>Hey BTL, this is MU arts student, the one you revert the edits of from ALSF Are you a Liberal student? if so, we probably have met.... who is this? --- In that case, if you're in no way involved in the ALSF your monitoring of the page is a bit strange... why do you take so much interest in it? and while using the term legendary is normally a no-no because of NPOV rules, if you were a Liberal student you would realise its not an unjustified use of the term.</p>

<p>All good points. Thanks. Will see about helping with them. Unsure if you've made the connection yourself, but it is interesting to note that in 2006 being Labor's largest lower house win, compared to in 1993 being Labor's largest lower house loss, they only managed 4 upper house seats in each election......... <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimeshift9_7a50.html" title="User:Timeshift9">Timeshift</a> 08:12, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>My strongest objection however is that after your edits, the Liberal section is pretty much SA based, whilst the ALP section is much more federally based and the content there makes them sound more right-wing than the Liberals. White Australia Policy in the ALP was dead and buried aaaages ago and only serves to confuse the reader. I do have many objections to changes you have made I am sorry to say. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimeshift9_7a50.html" title="User:Timeshift9">Timeshift</a> 05:30, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Due to non wikipedia-related issues i've been quite agitated and shouldn't have been rude in the above comment. I was having a discussion on Bressington and not looking for any alteration to the article. I should have just left it at your comment without replying to you.

<dd>Ooh really? What sort of questions and answers occured if you don't mind me asking? I wonder if she knows about the article on her and the discussion generated on her... i'd like to think pollies keep tabs on what is written about them on wikipedia (or am I being a little naive?)</dd>
<dd>On a side issue, i'd already asked Rocksong but as you're online - when a page has multiple templates (ie: the SA, VIC or QLD election pages) at the bottom that have a state govt template as well as the politics of australia template, is there a way to get one or both of them to show? I personally happen to find it annoying that a single template on a page will show, but two templates on a page will shrink themselves and must be expanded to be viewed. Any ideas? <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimeshift9_7a50.html" title="User:Timeshift9">Timeshift</a> 15:29, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><br />
Gday Michael,</p>
<p>Thanks for your correspondence.</p>
<p>May I start by stating that I have taken great care to adhere to the rules, both stated and inferred, of Wikipedia. In the aforementioned case (Fred Nile) I have endeavoured to post non-subjective data / non-qualitative information. All this data can be verified by the website of the Parliament House NSW, NSW Legislative Council, Nile's published biography and political website (both linked at the bottom of the page). However, data is continually removed without a tenable reason given.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, due to political nature of this individual, I believe certain editors, who obviously wish as little said about this individual as possible, have sought to continually vandalise / remove data, that for some reason, they have taken a personal dislike to. I can only guess that these individuals wish the subject to be only depicted in a certain light and will thus wilfully remove any data that doesn’t suit these ends.</p>
<p>I humble ask for your assistance in ending this chain of events so that Wiki users get the most accurate, extensive and up to date information they can from the system, devoid of censorship for personal political tastes, preferences and bias.</p>
<p>Regards Dave</p>

<p>Hi Beneaththelandslide, I was just looking at you recent edit to <a href="../../../s/h/o/Shop%2C_Distributive_and_Allied_Employees_Association_450f.html" title="Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees Association">Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees Association</a>. I saw that you replaced a previous edit with this paragraph.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Teenagers and women dominate membership and this to a large extent explains why leadership change is rare: the executive positions, often held by middle aged men, often go unchallenged because of difficulty for a person not backed by the 'machine' of the union or the ALP to challenge for office. Another reason for the constant leadership is because of the high turnover of membership, a reality because of the retail environment, which makes challenging for union office difficult.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Could you provide a reference which establishes that teenagers and women are a legitimate explanation for continuity of leadership? It seems more than a little sexist and presumptive.

<p><i>rvv; dave -- you can take this oppourtunity right now to present a draft on the talk page and work cooperatively, or you can continue to be a nuisance and get blocked -- your choice.)</i></p>
<p>Michael,</p>
<p>Have you read what I have posted on the Nile talk page and to the other editors involved here? Have you read what I previously posted here? Can you please explain why I am the "nuisance" ..for wanting to add data to Wiki? Without the community adding data, Wiki is nothing.</p>
<p>No offence, but all I did was add data (No Qualitative Comments Were Made). I have communicated my intention at every point. I have tried to work with the others, asking what exactly their objections were and even included part of their previous edit. What do I get?... the continual removal of data without explanation, personal accusation, a revert ban despite actually editing rather than reverting, and now getting bounced by you..</p>
<p>Fair crack of the whip mate! This is ridiculous.</p>

<dd>I do realise you're very busy with council elections, work, school and the like, which I fully understand and respect, but was hoping to find out an approximate time when you might be able to assist in getting the article up to FA status? I am still relatively new to wikipedia and believe I contributed to the article as best I could as seen through my constant contributions. You appear to be a veteran and a well respected one and would very much appreciate your modifications to bring this article up to standard. Also, on a seperate topic, would you be able to help me with my user page? I have added some userboxes to my page but I want to have them on the left with my awards on the right. At the moment the awards are on the right but a fair bit down. Would you be able to help me or edit the page to get the userboxes on the left and the awards directly to the right on <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimeshift9_7a50.html" title="User:Timeshift9">User:Timeshift9</a>&#160;?

<p>Okay, I'm new here so perhaps I'm missing the point.</p>
<p>Why label as "vandalism" and "media's class-war crap" information about a retiring politician's pension entitlements?</p>
<p>If it doesn't belong here, that's fine. But I'd like to understand the reasoning so I can soundly apply the logic elsewhere. <a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMirDoc_e9d3.html" title="User:MirDoc">MirDoc</a> 01:11, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi Michael, I'll add the same question about the 'far right' revert in <a href="../../../o/n/e/One_Nation_Party_46fb.html" title="One Nation Party">One Nation Party</a>. Maybe the expression is an insult that doesn't belong in the article, but I don't think you should have called it vandalism when you removed it. It wasn't my addition, but it looked good faith to me.

<p>The reason I put it in there though is because the current election outcome was the largest win for the ALP in history and it gives the impression of a completely unbalanced electoral system to someone unfamiliar with SA politics. The purpose of the 1993 outcome was to show that it is not. To me it almost feels like the article and/or picture justifies the playmander electoral system. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimeshift9_7a50.html" title="User:Timeshift9">Timeshift</a> 06:01, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I didn't want to contribute to discussion, I was instructed to contribute to discussion, and it was all due to mistakes by others. I made an edit which I will now assume that everyone accepts was a simple non-controversial factual correction (I have to assume because it seems that no one will ever admit it). There was nothing to discuss until other people made mistakes. I got stressed because I was subjected to a series of attacks, and still there is no sign of sympathy. <a href="../../../8/2/2E/User%7E82.18.125.110.html" title="User:82.18.125.110">82.18.125.110</a> 13:08, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No one in particular is attacking you. This tiny, petty little debacle is here simply because of things people are used to (the bizarre and unwritten conventions of Wikipedia... ). Articles are vandalised frequently, and it is almost always by an anonymous IP; editors will often revert changes in haste without a thurough inspection of the changes made. I know that your changes were appropriate and I didn't want it to seem as if there was any machinations against you, hence why I added my voice.</dd>

<p>Thanks for the offer. I'm always open to changes to be made to the article, they can always be changed. When you say overbearing and complex, i'm not sure. Anything besides the pendulum? Of course, it does need to fit FA guidelines to be appropriate to a worldwide audience, but to what level should things be taken? The vast majority of people who click on the page from google would be from south australians. Perhaps the pendulum needs explaining in terms of <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malcolm_Mackerras_e663.html" title="Malcolm Mackerras">Malcolm Mackerras</a>? I do think it the pendulum is an important and easy way in the way our democracy works to show the balance of power in the lower house of parliament who make up the government, ie: how Labor won government with 1 independent seat or how they were reduced to only 10 seats at the 1993 election. What i'm disappointed with is the lack of response I got when I lodged it for FA status. I tried a fair bit on the suggestions given but there weren't many. WikiProject Australian politics used to be a bit more active, but some of the more active people are online less now due to life/work commitments, it seems theres little contribution by anyone at the moment! <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimeshift9_7a50.html" title="User:Timeshift9">Timeshift</a> 14:09, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
