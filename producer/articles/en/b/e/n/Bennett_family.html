He was devastated to learn that he was really a Bennett, but soon grew to care deeply for his newfound family.

Ethan was the high school sweetheart of Gwen Hotchkiss, and, after graduating from <a href="../../../l/a/w/Law_school.html" title="Law school">law school</a>, he proposed to her.

After being lied to repeatedly, however, Ethan broke off that engagement as well. He and Gwen grew closer once more, but he was still in love with Theresa. He was about to choose Theresa once and for all when Gwen discovered that she was pregnant. Ethan relised that he had to do the right thing, and decided to marry the mother of his child instead of the woman he loved, Theresa.

She eventually began dating Spike, the owner of one of the clubs that she frequented, unaware that Spike was just toying with her.
