Could someone please cite a source for this quote? - japhyfoo@backword.net</li>
</ul>
<p>I have spent several months trying to find this quote. It appears to be a very bad translation of a section on corporatism supposedly written by Mussolini for the Enciclopedia Italiana (1932), but several English translations do not contain anything like this quote. Chip Berlet &lt;cberlet@igc.org&gt;.</p>
<p>moved off main page left quote on that page <a href="../../../s/m/i/User%7ESmith03_8e63.html" title="User:Smith03">User:Smith03</a></p>
<p>Berlet: I have tracked down the original 1935 English version of Mussolini's pamphlet, Mussolini, Benito. 1935. "The Doctrine of Fascism." (Firenze: Vallecchi Editore), which is listed as a translation of Mussolini's article in the Enciclopedia Italiana (1932). The quote above does not appear. Nor does it appear in a longer booklet which contains "The Doctrine of Fascism" as a chapter:</p>
<p>Mussolini, Benito. 1935. "Fascism: Doctrine and Institutions." (Rome: 'Ardita' Publishers).</p>
<p>I asked a scholar in Europe to find the quote in the Enciclopedia Italiana (1932), and he said he could not find a sentence that translates into the quote above. Until someone who reads Italian, and checks the Enciclopedia Italiana (1932), and finds there is a sentence that can be accureatly translated into the above quote, I think the quote should not be listed. Chip Berlet &lt;cberlet@igc.org&gt;.</p>
<hr />
<p>I went and copied the original article in the <i>Enciclopedia Italiana</i>, in case anyone wants to pick a page it is supposed to be on. If someone wants to argue this quote exists, please cite the page and paragraph from this or another original document. In the meantime, here are some actual quotes from English tranlations.</p>
<dl>
<dd>The Fascist conception of the State is all-embracing; outside of it no human or spiritual values can exist, much less have value. Thus understood, Fascism is totalitarian, and the Fascist State--a synthesis and a unit inclusive of all values--interprets, develops, and potentiates the whole life of a people. (p. 14)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Fascism recognises the real needs which gave rise to socialism and trade-unionism, giving them due weight in the guild or corporative system in which diverent interests are coordinated and harmonised in the unity of the State. (p.15)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Yet if anyone cares to read over the now crumbling minutes giving an account of the meetings at which the Italian <i>Fasci di Combattimento</i> were founded, he will find not a doctrine but a series of pointers… (p. 23)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>"It may be objected that this program implies a return to the guilds (<i>corporazioni</i>). No matter!... I therefore hope this assembly will accept the economic claims advanced by national syndicalism." (p. 24)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Fascism is definitely and absolutely opposed to the doctrines of liberalism, both in the political and economic sphere. (p. 32)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The Fascist State lays claim to rule in the economic field no less than in others; it makes its action felt throughout the length and breadth of the country by means of its corporate, social, and educational institutions, and all the political, economic, and spiritual forces of the nation, organised in their respective associations, circulate within the State. (p. 41).</dd>

<dd>The corporate State considers that private enterprise in the sphere of production is the most effective and usefu [sic] [typo-should be: useful] instrument in the interest of the nation.</dd>
</dl>
<p>In view of the fact that private organisation of production is a function of national concern, the organiser of the enterprise is responsible to the State for the direction given to production.</p>

<dd>State intervention in economic production arises only when private initiative is lacking or insufficient, or when the political interests of the State are involved. This intervention may take the form of control, assistance or direct management. (pp. 135-136)</dd>

<p>Hi, sometimes back, i started a stub for an endanger fish that i can't remember its name. I do remember it was also known by the name MUSSOLINI and it can live as long as 30yrs. Another fact that i remember is that its fresh cost about 100 US dollars. Google seem to pick nothing but Benito Mussolini. I started the stub without logging in, so searching against my username wouldn't help. Any one know how i can get to that article?</p>

<p>The article describes him as a 'Mexican revolutionary'. This may lead to confusion, since the term 'Mexican revolutionary' is usually applied to those who fought in the Mexican Revolution of the early Twentieth Century, decades after Juarez's death. 'Mexican reformist' might work better, since he was a crucial player in the Mexican War of Reform, as described on the History of Mexico Wikipedia article. Just a suggestion. --toonbat@yahoo.com</p>

<p>an edit claimingthat entering in WWII <i>is widely considered Mussolini's greatest mistake</i> has been considered vandalism. Imho this is an opinion with a strong historical background. Consider also the Franco's regime in Spain: it has survived after the war for a longtime.<br />

<dd>Oops, I think I didn't fill in the edit summary correctly. I don't consider it vandalism, but I do consider it an unnecessary opinion. On second thought though, perhaps it's actually not that out of place. If you think it makes for a better article, I don't think I should actually object to it being there -- I think I'm closer to neutral now.

<p>When Italy entered WWII (June 1940) <b>almost everyone in the world</b> believed the war was over: France defeated, Great Britain withdrawn from Dunquerque, US neutral, Japan winning, Soviet Union allied with Germany. Mussolini believed that <i>some thousands casualties</i> (his own words) were necessary to seat at the <i>peace table</i>. He didn't face big opposition as this was a general opinion. We must put ourselves in those times to understand. Spain didn't enter as it was exhausted by its civil war. No question that entering was <i>an error</i>, a tragic <i>miscalculation</i>. History is full of miscalculations, how else to call them? IMHO the paragraph removed by Improv is not POV, is mere historical thruth. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarius_b7cc.html" title="User:Marius">Marius</a> <a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarius_d603.html" title="User talk:Marius">@</a> <small>19:27, 11 Nov 2004 (UTC)</small></p>
<p>PS: italian proverb:<br />
<i>del senno di poi son piene le fosse</i><br />
free translation:<br />
<i>its easy to be wise after the event</i> Changed the sentence that Mussolini had no choice but to declare war on the United States and the Soviet Union. I'm not sure this is historical justified. Franco managed to avoid this, and I don't see Hitler being able to do much to Mussolini if he decided to be a friendly neutral.</p>
<hr />
<p>Yes of course Hitler could do something to Italy hes just taken the majority of europe with comparitively no effort. Mussolini adopted a policy of there being a great war in europe from an early point in his dictatorship. His only objective was to be on the winning side. This is proved by his whole period as dictator in which he was constantly searching for prestige both for himself and Italy. Therefore if he saw that Hitler was more powerful of course hes going to jump on the bandwagon in order to get prestige for himself and Italy. Only later towards the end of WWII did Italy become a satellite of Germany. The decision to declare war was entirely Musolini's.</p>

<p>The Mussolini quote most cited on the Internet and attributed to Mussolini is not accurate and is probably not from Mussolini. I would like to keep at least a link mentioning this fact on this page. It is one of the things an encyclopedia does -- correct false data.

<p>I thought that he was an atheist who detested Christianity. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAnglius_e80b.html" title="User:Anglius">Anglius</a></p>
<p>That was much earlier in his life. It really is hard to say if he ever did become a born again Christian after making peace with Christianity, after taking power he always claimed to be a devout Roman Catholic, but this may have just been a PR thing. After realizing that the Italian people would never tun their backs on their national faith and church, he was smart enough to silence his opposition.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough he was actually fascinated by Buddhism. Although by the brutal actions that he employed during most of his life, it is hard to be picture him as an actual Roman Catholic or Buddhist. -Chris Gilmore</p>

<dd>According to an investigation made by some journalists, among whom the American Peter Tomkins who was an OSS agent in Milano (Italy) during WW II, and aired on August 2004 by the Italian national TV network <a href="../../../r/a/i/Rai_Tre_be5c.html" title="Rai Tre">Rai Tre</a>, Mussolini was killed on April 28, 1945 in the morning, by some British secret agents on their attempt to take possession of the Churchill-Mussolini exchange of letters. These documents might have been awkward to Churchill, given that some speculate the two statesmen were discussing an anti-Soviet separate peace, despite the agreements previously stipulated between the Allies. The investigation is backed also by the witness of Bruno Giovanni Lonati, on that time an Italian communist <a href="../../../i/t/a/Italian_resistance_movement.html" title="Italian resistance movement">partisan</a> member of the "Brigate Garibaldi" in Milan. <a href="http://italy.indymedia.org/news/2004/08/610637.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://italy.indymedia.org/news/2004/08/610637.php" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> <a href="http://www.larchivio.org/xoom/bonzanigo.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.larchivio.org/xoom/bonzanigo.htm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a><br /></dd>

<dd>I disagree on the removal: this version is backed by witness, the sources are authoritative (see the links). It's not even a new theory (a lot of books have been written abut this subject). The exact circumstances of Mussolini's death are not clear at all, after more than sixty years, and this is a fact acknowledged by almost all historians of any political bias. The matter is questionable, but before removing this paragraph, which has remained untouched since one year, imho some more discussion is needed.

<dd>Indeed Mussolini's regime was avowedly totalitarian, and the first to popularize the use of the term. However, there has been too much research by social scientists and historians who disagree that the term totalitarian is appropriate for any regimes to ignore. Even for those who consider it appropriate, only for perhaps two leaders would there be universally agreement that they were-- Hitler and Stalin. The next closest would be Mussolini and Stalin... Since Ardent and Brezhenski brought the concept of "totalitarianism" back into usage in the 1950s and 1960s to refer to both fascist and communist regimes, some specialists on Mussolini's Italy have problematizing the concept, commenting on his "imperfect totalitarianism." There is more agreement on Nazi and Stalinist totalitarianism, but not complete. Kershaw and Lewin, for example, are among those who have long criticized the totalitarian model as a tool for sound historical comparison of Soviet Russia and Nazi Germany. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> | <a href="../../../1/7/2/User_talk%7E172.html" title="User talk:172">Talk</a> 05:54, 2 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>That sounds, to be blunt, like bafflegab. You assert the term's relevance to the topic, then say there is no agreement.

<dd>It is all in the definition of the term "Totalitarian", modern scholars consider it a system of complete enforced control &amp; coercive method of governance upon its populace, a "total control" meaning of 'totalitarian'. Fascist Italy considered the word however to mean something more ideal &amp; utopian if never actually implemented by them or otherwise; a term that correlates highly to Fascist Italy's 'corporative state' or the incorporation of all interests into the state "total". By which they mean 'all interests &amp; walks of life' merging into and officialized/recognized publicly by the state. It can be proven the original "Fascists" meant no such 'coercive' connotations in the word as quoted in the 1932 'doctrine of Fascism' - <i>"...(The state) is not simply a mechanism which limits the sphere of the supposed liberties of the individual..."</i>, &amp; <i>"...Neither has the Fascist conception of authority anything in common with that of a police ridden State..."</i> rather it clearly connotes <i>"...Far from crushing the individual, the Fascist State multiplies his energies, just as in a regiment a soldier is not diminished but multiplied by the number of his fellow soldiers..."</i>, in this way Fascist "Totalitarianism" was seen from the Italian perspective to be a kind of statist syndicalism, where the private individual interests, belonging to the individual alone, would be given wider leverage by the government &amp; state, in a bureaucratic form, this was Fascism's "Corporative Syndicalism". I also think here, that 'Totalitarianism' when used for the Fascism that popularized it as a term, should be used in their utopian sense and not in a pejorative sense by revisionist scholars of a later era which go on to claim their definition of "totalitarianism" doesn't fit the Italian Fascist state because it wasn't "coercive" enough. <a href="../../../n/a/g/User%7ENagelfar_fb83.html" title="User:Nagelfar">Nagelfar</a> 10:38, 30 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Dear Dennis, your point that Skorzeny did not lead the commando does not make any sense (sorry to say). Skorzeny has been handpicked by A. Hitler himself to "mount, lead &amp; execute this operation". Gran Sasso (Mussolini's jail) was/is at the top of a mountain, only accessible by funicular. Skorzeny &amp; his SS-Kommando landed in two/three gliders at the top of the mountain. Meanwhile Student's paratroopers (non-SS) were airdropped at the base of the mountain in order to gain control of the funicular station and prevent any Italian reinforcements to reach the top. After Mussolini had been released, an ace from the luftwaffe managed to land a very small plane at the top of the mountain. When released by ==Skorzeny himself==, Mussolini allegedly said "I knew my friend hitler would not let me down".Then, Mussolini, the pilot AND Skorzeny, boarded the little plane (at first, the pilot did not want to let Skorzeny board the plane because it was a two seaters, and he was afraid they would be too heavy to take off). The rest of the SS-Kommando then used the funicular to get down (which was no problem since Student's paratroopers were holding the station below).

I think this is not very fair since a debate (ie. you vs. rest of the world) is still taking place.</p>
<p>Numerous sources agree that Skorzeny was key in executing the rescue, which was planned by Student. In any case, I think the details of the rescue (and any related controversy) belong in a seperate article, rather than spread across those of all the participants.

<p>I have just finished reading Mussolini's only novel, The Cardinal's Mistress. I was wondering if someone could elaborate on how much allusion to the dictator's life is really contained in the book. Something in particular I am wondering about are the character names chosen by Mussolini. They seem to contain similarities to names in his real life (i.e. Claudia Particella/Clara Petacci, Rachele the maidservant/Rachele the wife of Mussolini, Emanuel Madruzzo/Emmanuel the King of Italy). Or is it just my overactive imagination?</p>

Also discarding the famous hypothesis of the "correspondence" Mussolini-Churchill, seems nearly for sure that was another person to execute Mussolini, for less an other partisan. The declarations of "Colonnello Valerio" in fact have been often conflicting.-Jean76 (excuse me but i'm still not registred on the english wiki)</p>

<p>I've removed these sentences:</p>
<p><i>According to Audisio, the execution of Petacci was incidental and unplanned. Despite having no orders to kill her "she simply wouldn't let go of Il Duce".</i></p>
<p>They have been sitting there for a sufficiently long time (months? years?) so that the indivdual who introduced them should have been able to cite some source for them by now. I also added {{fact}} to the assertion that Audisio executed Mussolini, since this is controversial.--<a href="../../../l/a/c/User%7ELacatosias_a9d0.html" title="User:Lacatosias">Lacatosias</a> 09:33, 16 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm going to keep adding on the well known fact that Il Duce's corpse was defiled and outraged. This is an important component to the "demystifying" of his legend by Partisians. <a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonsin1976_c2ce.html" title="User:Ronsin1976">Ronsin1976</a> 17:17, 18 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Fine with me. If this weren't Wikipedia and we were dealing with personal opinions, I would have added the adverb "appropriately" defiled of course. But that's neither here not there.

<dd>A few posts up here I gave a link to a USA combat film found in te RAI national television archives. It says that the corpse was defiled. It shows it. It shows the bodies. It shows the riots. I am not a neofascist or so (well, i am with left, to say it all), but I am italian and I would like to defend the truth of history. The days of Piazzale Loreto were chaotic, and people often acted in a fool way. This is not propaganda.

<p>We appear to be in the middle of an edit war, and I'd like to move the discussion from terse remarks in edit summaries to the talk page. The disputed passage of the moment is</p>
<p>His entry into World War II on the side of Nazi Germany made Italy a target for Allied attacks and ultimately led to his downfall and death.</p>
<p>Anywho, while cause and effect is an aspect of history that can lead to a great deal of dispute, it is still a major aspect (perhaps the major aspect) of the study of history, and I think we have here a fairly clear-cut example of cause-and-effect. We have a fact, that fact is relevant to the subject at hand, I see no reason to remove it. -<a href="../../../m/b/l/User%7EMBlume_70ae.html" title="User:MBlume">MBlume</a> 4/2/2006</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, let's analyse one-by-one the factual claims made in the statement:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>His entry into WWII......true, all evidence indicates that Mussolini did indeed enter into World War II.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>He entered on the side of the Nazis.....true.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>This siding with Nazi Germany against the Allies obviously led to a declaration of war against Italy by the Allies. Hence, Italy's entrance on the side of the Nazis, as opposed to staying nuetral or siding with the ALIIES, led to the Allies attack on Italy as a part of the War to liberate Europe from Nazi domination------true. ERRRR...Why else would they have targeted Italy?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>These attacks ultimately led to the downfall of Mussolini............well, it's probable that his own ineptness, cruelty and maladministration played a part is this. But certainly the Allied attacks played there role as well. --<a href="../../../l/a/c/User%7ELacatosias_a9d0.html" title="User:Lacatosias">Lacatosias</a> 10:48, 3 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>we just had a rather large, rather heroic sort of portrait added to the page, and then moved to the top where it sat above the article.

<p>Mussolini wasn't an atheist was he? Someone's added that category</p>
<p>I honestly do not know if he was an atheist, an agnostic or a weak sort of Catholic.

<p>Those are helpful articles. Please consider adding information about the following:</p>
<p>1. The Mussolini-Hitler salute originated from the USA’s early Pledge of Allegiance and a (rexcurry.net/USA-pledge-of-allegiance-rexcurrydotnet.jpg) shocking photograph is here. The original Pledge began with a military salute that then stretched out toward the flag and a (rexcurry.net/USA-pledge-of-allegiance2-rexcurrydotnet.jpg) photograph is here. In actual use, the (rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-pledge.html) second part) of the gesture was performed with a straight arm and palm down by disinterested children perfunctorily performing the forced ritual chanting by extending the initial military salute, as shown by Professor Rex Curry. Due to the way that both gestures were used sequentially in the pledge, the (rexcurry.net/bellamy-edward-german-connections.html) military salute led to the hard, stylized salute of Mussolini-Hitler. It was an extended military salute via the USA’s Pledge.</p>
<p>2. At the time that Mussolini-Hitler found their salute they were both (rexcurry.net/roman-salute-benito-mussolini.html) self-proclaimed socialists and leaders in their movements. It was not an ancient Roman salute, and the "ancient Roman salute" (rexcurry.net/pledgesalute.html) is a myth]. The myth grew from the use of the USA’s pledge salute in (rexcurry.net/roman-salute-benito-mussolini.html) early movies showing fictional Roman scenes.</p>
<p>3. The swastika, although it was an ancient symbol, was used sometimes by the National Socialist German Workers Party to represent overlapping “S” letters for their “socialism,” as shown in (rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-swastika.html) Swastika Secrets]by Dr. Rex Curry. The same symbolism is shown in Hitler’s own bizarre signature, which Hitler alter to use the same stylized "S" letter for "socialist," and similar alphabetic symbolism still shows on (rexcurry.net/bookchapter4a1a2a.html) Volkswagens.</p>
<p>4. The Mussolini-Hitler salute in the USA pre-dated Mussolini-Hitler by decades and was created by Francis Bellamy (author of the "Pledge of Allegiance"). Francis Bellamy and Edward Bellamy (author of the novel "Looking Backward") and Charles Bellamy (author of "A Moment of Madness") and Frederick Bellamy (who introduced Edward to socialistic "Fourierism") were socialists. Edward, Charles and Frederick were brothers, and Francis was their cousin. Francis and Edward were both self-proclaimed National Socialists and they supported the "Nationalism" movement in the USA, the "Nationalist" magazine, and the "Nationalist Educational Association." They wanted all of society to ape the military and they touted "military socialism" and the "industrial army." Edward’s book was an international bestseller, translated into every major language (including Italian &amp; German) and he inspired the "Nationalist Party" (in the USA) and their dogma influenced socialists worldwide (including Italy &amp; Germany) via “Nationalist Clubs.”</p>

<dd>The Nazi salute was far older, originating with Roman soldiers and Hitler got it through Mussolini, not the USA. Also, I see your links as an attempt at search engine optimization so I delinked the multiple links to what (I assume) is your own site. Apart from that misinformation, I don't see much new or enlightening in your post. --Golbez 07:59, 11 April 2006 (UTC)--<a href="../../../l/a/c/User%7ELacatosias_a9d0.html" title="User:Lacatosias">Lacatosias</a> 08:14, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As far as I know, points 1 and 2 are wrong, point 3 is not related with fascism (fascism used the roman "fascio", the svastika was nazist and not linked to the "s" letter). --<a href="../../../j/o/l/User%7EJollyroger_dbdd.html" title="User:Jollyroger">Jollyroger</a> 22:40, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>A small comment, but the phrase regarding Mussolini's death that "American troops were outraged" is unnecessary and suggests a bias in the language. Whilst it may be true, without a citation it hinders rather than helps the article. Either a citation should be added or the phrase should be ejected. <a href="../../../s/h/e/User%7EShepplestone_a979.html" title="User:Shepplestone">Shepplestone</a> 26 April 2006</p>
