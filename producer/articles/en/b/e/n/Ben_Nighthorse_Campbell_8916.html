<p>Campbell was born in <a href="../../../a/u/b/Auburn%2C_California_bd2c.html" title="Auburn, California">Auburn</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/l/California.html" title="California">California</a>. His mother, Mary Vierra, was a <a href="../../../p/o/r/Portugual.html" title="Portugual">Portuguese</a> immigrant who had come to the U.S. at age six. There Vierra's family settled in the large Portuguese community near <a href="../../../s/a/c/Sacramento%2C_California_50bc.html" title="Sacramento, California">Sacramento</a>.

<p>Campbell attended Placer High School, dropping out in <a href="../../../1/9/5/1951.html" title="1951">1951</a> to join the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Air_Force_81b3.html" title="United States Air Force">U.S. Air Force</a>.
