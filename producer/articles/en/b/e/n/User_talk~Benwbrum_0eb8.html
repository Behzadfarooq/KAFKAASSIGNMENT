<p>Hello. Yes <i>epigraphie</i> is a more general term. In English, there exists also the word <i>epigrpahy</i> (at least in Webster)</p>
<p>In French&#160;: <i>épigraphe</i> means something written on stone and <i>epigraphy</i> is the study of <i>inscription</i>. These two words may refer to Greek, latin,... inscriptions.</p>
<p>Hope my English is not too broken. Any other question&#160;? (I am nearly a native speaker of French)</p>

<p>Hi Ben, as one of those on Mr Z's "they're out to get me" list, let me explain the frustrations I've had with this individual.</p>
<ol>
<li>When I first encountered him over the <a href="../../../s/e/a/Sea_Peoples_7b84.html" title="Sea Peoples">Sea Peoples</a> article, he insisted on pushing his mixure of fantasy &amp; David Rohl into this article. Requests for him to explain where this material came from resulted in his calim that I "obviously" couldn't keep up with the latest publications in Russian, French &amp; Georgian. He never explained why he couldn't take the time to introduce this material to the English-only world, though.</li>
<li>When I confronted him over his (now gone) Heberite article, asking him detailed questions whence he drew his research, this resulted in his petulant cry that he was leaving Wikipedia, never to contriubte again. That wasn't the reaction I wanted (I just wanted him to provide his sources), &amp; so basically ignored him for a few weeks, hoping he'd get over his "insult".</li>
<li>Repeated requests on various Talk: pages (including his own) to document his assertions have been ignored. An odd response for one who claims to be a professional educator &amp; scholar.</li>
<li>Re-writing the <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Rohl_d3df.html" title="David Rohl">David Rohl</a> article brought forth accusations that my writing was "blatantly Anti-Rohl. The current article is obscenely biased and full of false facts and hearsay." Much of the information I used for the article either came from Rohl's own web page -- where he proudly details much of his pre-academic career -- or his books which I read. He hasn't answered my request for clarification.</li>
</ol>
<p>I've pretty well decided to try to ignore him. I don't need the aggravation. I probably will chase down all of his fanciful articles relating to the Bible &amp; replace them with material that would actually get a passing grade in a college freshman class, but only because I believe we deserve accuracy on Wikipedia. -- <a href="../../../l/l/y/User%7ELlywrch_461d.html" title="User:Llywrch">llywrch</a> 01:20, 10 Feb 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I saw your point on my Talk: page, Ben, &amp; I came here to say that you might have a point (I'll admit that many of Mr Z's stubs are acceptible) -- &amp; then I saw his comment below.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>[shrug] I guess the only way one can get along with what Mr Z posts is to agree with him -- or ignore him; any other policy simply leads to conflict, which is failed to be resolved due to his lack of cooperation. (Look at the record for yourself.) I hope you have better luck with him than I had.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>P.S. I don't have any objection to space being devoted to Velikovsky on Wikipedia; he is a well-known individual whose opinions &amp; theories require inclusion. My objection is when his theories &amp; speculations are presented as proven fact. -- <a href="../../../l/l/y/User%7ELlywrch_461d.html" title="User:Llywrch">llywrch</a> 21:32, 10 Feb 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi in answer to your question on Habiru just type tilda ~ four times ~ ~ ~ ~ without any spaces for the full date and signature. I won't bother reading what Wetman &amp; his cronies have written in detail but I did notice that Llywrch has mixed and matched answers I have given him on varying subjects in different places to create his own fantasy. But you don;t have to take my word for it, just look through my history of contributions and see what I have written on the discussion Talk pages if you are really interested. At a glance your talk page here does seem like you are involved in back-biting. Anyway I won't judge you if you won't judge me. Also you can have fun playing with your user preferences.

<p>Hi Ben. Thanks for your comment on your talk page. The truth is that I also liked the same suggestion you liked, about a sort of neutral domain for source texts in ancient languages. When I said that only an annotated text is "useful" I was thinking of the fact that that is simply the only way I've seen such texts published (they always seem to have scholarly apparatus). But maybe I overstated the case. In any event, a neutral place for the source-texts is a cool idea. <a href="../../../d/o/v/User%7EDovi_943a.html" title="User:Dovi">Dovi</a> 16:59, Oct 30, 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, an unannotated text is better than a badly annotated one. Also, the raw text made publicly available gives everyone the chance to make an annotated edition, contrary to cases where scholars sit on unpublished texts for ages (<a href="../../../t/h/e/Thebes_tablets.html" title="Thebes tablets">Thebes tablets</a>). The texts I put on Wikisource have of course all long been annotated (but contrary to the texts themselves, the annotations are copyrighted, of course) <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> 08:59, 3 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think the text was converted from the TITUS edition:</p>
<pre>
On the basis of several editions
electronically prepared by J. Tischler,
Dresden, 1993;
revised edition by H.C. Melchert,
Chapel Hill, 1998;
TITUS version by Jost Gippert,
Frankfurt a/M, 1.6.2000 / 9.6.2002
</pre>
<pre>
Preliminary remarks of H.C. Melchert's version:
Revised by Craig Melchert after a file supplied by Johann Tischler,
whose generosity is gratefully acknowledged. I am responsible for all
readings and morpheme analyses in the present version--HCM.
</pre>
<p>although I am not sure if the text is identical to the TITUS one. Note that there are strings "0xc3", ..., "0xc7", "0xab" in the text. These are letters with diacritics that were badly converted. I was still going to find out what they were and replace them. Also, the encoding could be more unicode-ish (S-hacek for $, subscript indices etc.). I think it will be easier to make these transformations before splitting up the text. regards, <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> 08:59, 3 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>re copyright, I am not a legal expert. The Texts themselves are obviously not copyrightable. But since the transcription actually contains more information than the original tablet, it may be. I don't think that there is any legal precedent for this case, because of the peculiarity of cuneiform transcription. In practice, these texts are freely circulated and quoted, with the academic courtesy of acknowledging the original transcriber. In the case of this digital text, its history may be complicated, and it may be a convolution of several transcription whose history is not veifiable. It seem that the text at least partially contains work by Melchert and Tischler, but we cannot claim that it <i>is</i> Melchert's or Tischler's text, since other changes might have been made.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>re perl script: the text as it is on wikisource now is itself the result of a perlscript of mine. The leftover 0xab type things were signs for which I was not sure what it should be. it is <i>not</i> automatically correct to replace it with the xab html-entity «, rather you should figure out which sign it <i>should</i> be. The remaining html encoding you intend is of course good practice. I was going to do that myself sometime, but it was not on my immediate todo list, and I will be glad if you beat me to it.</dd>

<p>It is from Heise. I figured akkaditum.png would be public domain because it's simply an image of a text string, using a standard font.

<p>I have just archived part of the 1984 Talk page and arranged it for ease of reading - nothing changed, deleted or otherwise tampered with in terms of text. I also responded to the issues posed on both your new section and the original theme and also on stuff that should not be in the article.

<p>I saw your edit tag and I was not sure what to make of it. Dr. Kenneth Brown is widely quoted as being an archaelogist and also concerned with the subject of anthropology. These events took place in and around the year 1987. Is it your point that such a department never existed, or that one does not exist now, or that he was called an archaelogist who worked for UofH but not in a department by that name? Help me out please because I am trying to build the article and the last thing that I want to do is to build in errors. <a href="../../../m/p/l/User%7EMPLX_3a0d.html" title="User:MPLX">MPLX/MH</a> 16:39, 18 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks Ben, I have just gone back and listened to the soundtrack of a recording made from a TV interview with Dr. Brown about all of this and in his very first words he describes himself as being "Dr. Kenneth Brown of the Anthropology Department of the University of Houston ..." Unfortunately when I was using sources from the Houston Chronicle and Daily Telegraph they stressed archaeology and not anthropology. With regards to the silly aspects, Brown recited that he felt that he had stumbled into a political hornets nest and that his new lab was suddenly threatened with closure if he did not back off this particular investigation. I also have a political cartoon strip from that time which makes fun of the entire episode ... In the first panel is Charles I granting the patent to Heath; in the second is a ship wondering whether to drop anchor on the east coast or the in the Gulf; the fourth shows Cromwell taking away the patent and the fifth shows ... "Meanwhile - not so long ago in a city not so distant ... (bubble: "Look what we got here" - worker with Houston Public Works t-shirt), (bubble: "The Carolana Colony right under our own Fire Department lot!"), (bubble: "Well, do we tell the Mayor or do we bury it?") I am going to see if I can scan it and place it on line since I can get the copyright clearance on it. <a href="../../../m/p/l/User%7EMPLX_3a0d.html" title="User:MPLX">MPLX/MH</a> 17:09, 18 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks. I have just begun uploading a transcription (stop-start-stop-start) of the 4FTN interview. (I may have included a few typos that need to be weeded out!) I will at some try to get a frame off the TV program and post it on Wikipedia. For a lot of reasons I can't go into I can tell you from first hand knowledge that this subject has met with tremendous hostility in the past from "the powers that be" for a variety of reasons and both Brown and then 4FTN got caught up in the backlash. Wikipedia is wonderful because it is difficult to censor and it may be one of the greatest contributions to egalitarian freedom that has ever come along. It has its Jeffersonian (or was it Franklin?) warning though about being great if we can hold on to it. <a href="../../../m/p/l/User%7EMPLX_3a0d.html" title="User:MPLX">MPLX/MH</a> 18:10, 18 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Ben -- Yes, I changed factor to factory because I thought it was a typo. Undoubtably others will think so too (because it's not one of those "typos" that's easy to glance over -- it took me a couple readings of the sentence to figure out what was intended), so I would recommend included a parenthetical note that "factor" is what snuff factories were called. However, it does seem odd to me that snuff factories would be called factors -- do you have a reference? (Or more than one, to discount the possiblity of a typo in your ref.)

<dd>Well, you are certainly more knowledgeable than myself on the subject, so I'll certainly defer to you.

<p>Over at <a href="../../../e/a/s/Talk%7EEaster_8f62.html" title="Talk:Easter">Talk:Easter</a> a while ago you linked to an article citing an Australian (IIRC) researcher who had something definitive to say about Bede's "Eostre", and it was my impression at the time that this was the direction scholarly consensus was headed at the time. There's a disgruntled person over there now who's slapped an {{NPOV}} on it becuase it doesn't takes Bede or Grimm seriously enough for him and because I reverted an edit where he tried to turn it into almost as much a neopagan holiday as a Christian one. I wonder if you have any more references on current thought regarding Bede? Or do you recall the researcher's name and institution from the article? I think I can support what I said about Grimm (<a href="../../../t/o/m/Tom_Shippey_24af.html" title="Tom Shippey">Tom Shippey</a>'s work on Tolkien is main source) and (IIRC) I can use <a href="../../../r/o/n/Ronald_Hutton_ab1b.html" title="Ronald Hutton">Ronald Hutton</a> against Bede, but other references might help. I have to admit that although I'm willing to take him on at the moment, this weekend will probably be far too full for me to devote as much attention as this is likely to require. <a href="../../../c/s/e/User%7ECsernica_0047.html" title="User:Csernica">Csernica</a> 02:40, 28 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Ben, I've usually seen the heat introduced at ground level, then allowed to rise, and be vented at through the roof. I believe the previous wording suggested the heat was introduced at roof level. Cheers 24.0.86.182 15:45, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello Benwbrum,</p>
<p>On 05:04, 27 April 2002 you created the article <a href="../../../a/k/k/Akkadian_language.html" title="Akkadian language">Akkadian language</a>. That first revision contained the following text:</p>
<p><i>Akkadian is divided into dialects based on geography and time.</i></p>
<ul>
<li><i>2500 - 1950 Old Akkadian</i></li>
<li><i>1950 - 1530 Old Babylonian/Old Assyrian</i></li>
<li><i>1530 - 1000 Middle Babylonian/Middle Assyrian</i></li>
<li><i>1000 - 600 Neo-Babylonian/Neo-Assyrian</i></li>
<li><i>600 B.C. - 100 A.D. Late Babylonian</i></li>
</ul>
<p>This fragment has persisted in the article to this day. You gave no source for this information, and the current revision does not cite any source either. I'd like to request that you add a reference to the source of that information.</p>
<p>Thanks, <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItayb_5c09.html" title="User:Itayb">Itayb</a> 12:19, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for adding the reference. :)</dd>
<dd>I've slightly reorganized the references to this source on the page, making them more specific and interrelated. I hope you approve. <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItayb_5c09.html" title="User:Itayb">Itayb</a> 19:28, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't understand what exactly you object to, and on what grounds.</dd>
<dd>Do you object to the very mentioning of the online resource? If so, it's not just a matter of reverting from my reorganization to the previous revision, because it already contained a link to this resource in the "External links" section. I've just changed its location to make the connection between it and the book reference more obvious.</dd>
<dd>But, if in fact you object to mentioning the online resource, then what are your reasons? I'll tell you what my reasons are for mentioning it: it's easier to verify statements (such as the one i asked you to cite a source to) that are based on this source, when it's available online. It has proved very convenient to me, for example. Unlike you, i don't have the book at home, and it spared me a trip to the library, assuming that there's a library nearby that holds a copy of the book; it is not improbable that many libraries around the world don't have a copy. Alternatively, i could have ordered this book for $17.50 (at Eisenbrauns), not including delivery (assuming they make deliveries to Israel, where i live). Even pretending that i weren't broke, you can't expect me, in my opinion, to buy a book whenever i want to verify the validity of a claim i bump into on a Wikipedia article. But you should encourage me, in my opinion, to do my best to verify as many such claims as possible.</dd>
<dd>Are you concerned that the site linked to violates copyright by displaying this material? If you have good reasons to suspect so, then by all means, remove any trace of this link. But please take into account, that only a small portion of the book is available via that URL, and the main page (the one linked to from the Wikipedia article) explicitly recommends buying the book, and gives a link to a book marketing site, which sells it. <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItayb_5c09.html" title="User:Itayb">Itayb</a> 08:35, 14 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Maybe I overstated my objections. I completely agree with you about verifiability, and have seen transparent access to sources resolve at least one nasty edit war (though it took a lot of typing to do it: <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenwbrum_Hapiru_0e72.html" title="User:Benwbrum/Hapiru">User:Benwbrum/Hapiru</a>. I guess I have two concerns about the reference to the scanned book, which you might be able to help me with.</dd>
<dd>Are references supposed to be aimed at the sources actually used in composing the article, or other sources that say the same thing? Though come to think of it, even if the former, then my distinction between an online version to an earlier edition and a not-terribly-useful bibliographic citation is probably still silly.</dd>
<dd>I'm a bit concerned about the tentative nature of the scanned book -- it appears that the webmaster is considering taking the scans down. If that happens, the citation may get lost.</dd>
<dd>Perhaps we can just have two references by that statement: one to the citation and one to the website. That way a change to the website wouldn't lose the citation.</dd>

<dd>Would you consider the following suggestion satisfactory?
<ul>
<li>The foot note does not link to the the contested URL. It simply states "Caplice" and the page number relative to each edition, say: "Caplice, p. 5 (1980), p. 42 (1983), p. 111 (1988, 2002)"</li>
<li>The References section remains almost as it is now, except that the last parentheses read: "(The 1980 edition is partly available <a href="http://www.gatewaystobabylon.com/introduction/ita/start.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.gatewaystobabylon.com/introduction/ita/start.htm" rel="nofollow">online</a>)"</li>
<li>If, at some future time, this link gets broken, that's no big deal: the person observing it could simply delete the link; it is, after all, the free encyclopedia that anyone can edit, isn't it? <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItayb_5c09.html" title="User:Itayb">Itayb</a> 15:46, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
