<p>Hi, I am unsure of the direct protocols for banning someone from a page etc because of vandalism, but you seem like a good administrator, so I would suggest that because of personal attacks to me and also vandalism to the page <a href="../../../p/o/r/Portsmouth_Grammar_School_319a.html" title="Portsmouth Grammar School">Portsmouth Grammar School</a>, Pirate Pete should be considered. Weigh up the evidence for yourself, however I feel that it is certainly worth considering. I do my best to revert vandalism on this page, however I cannot be on there all the time and I also feel he (and some IP addresses) are doing it to wind me up. I have posted a warning on his talk page.

A cursory scan of Pirate Pete's contributions to the article on your school appears to show consistent attempts to vandalise said article. I will follow the <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrator_intervention_against_vandalism_ffcc.html" title="Wikipedia:Administrator intervention against vandalism">guidance laid out for admins</a> and place the appropriate warning template on Pirate Pete's user page. If he vandalises again in the near future this will then constitute a breach of policy and etiquette, leading to a block against editing being placed on his user account. If you need any more clarification, then please don't hesitiate to ask myself or another admin.

<dd>I just couldn't see where you were coming from. I think that the music section simply reflects the wealth of talent in the school and the fact that the school is a centre of excellence for it in the region. It is more figurative than anything. However I have put it back on, in case anyone else dissagrees with me. However I doubt that any edits will stay on there for long - there is a veritable community of POV wikipedians proudly editing their school article! Anyway, sorry, I should have discussed it first on a talk page.

<dd><i>I see. Allow me to explain why I saw the music groups section as an advertisement. Words like "extremely good", "most prestigious", "extremely important events", "highly skilled", "many of the best players", "expertly", "polyrhythmically unrivalled", "virtuosic pieces", "esteemed", "pride and joy", "enjoyed by all", "another skilled ensemble", "string playing talent", "one of the most virtuostic and impressive of the chamber ensembles", "most talented string players", "talented group of musicians", "skilled group", "the talented choral trainer", etcetera, do not meet the <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral point of view</a>. They are subjective, and should be avoided as much as possible. It's not up to wikipedia to decide whether the groups are any good or not, that's for those who read this article and have heard the groups play to decide. If the groups are notable, the article should mention why they are notable (e.g. having played at the Royal British Legion Festival of Remembrance at the Albert Hall). If external reviews are included, they should be from authoritative sources: music magazines, newspapers, etc. They should not be from "Collaboratively the music staff, 2006." If you want to, I can put an edited version of this section on my <a href="../../../a/e/c/User%7EAecis_Sandbox_dc74.html" title="User:Aecis/Sandbox">sandbox</a> to show you what I'm talking about.</i> <a href="../../../a/e/c/User%7EAecis_7d64.html" title="User:Aecis">Aecis</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Aecis_c56c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Aecis"><sup>Mr.</sup></a> <a href="../../../a/e/c/User_talk%7EAecis_6dc5.html" title="User talk:Aecis"><sup>Mojo</sup></a> <a href="../../../a/e/c/User%7EAecis_Userboxes_0d05.html" title="User:Aecis/Userboxes"><sup>risin'</sup></a> 16:48, 6 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I completely understand what you are saying, that it has POV, and I am working on telling people that it shouldn't. But I don't think that specific tag is appropriete, because I don't think that it reads like an advert. It needs a POV tag which I will try to find. The music section needs a cleanup and those who know the music department well are the people to do it - This will happen shortly when I and my fellow PGSers edit it, you can do so, but more <b>information</b> is required which is only known by its audience. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenjaminstewart05_6bfc.html" title="User:Benjaminstewart05">Benjaminstewart05</a> 16:54, 6 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi Benjamin! Yes, Wikipedia is very much a global venture, so we have to accept that there are many other editors who use English differently to us. So Wikipedia always has had, and always will have, a mixture of British and US English (plus of course Australian, Canadian, African, and lots of others). Generally the policy is to use the local version English for local topics, and to avoid words that are specific to US or British English where we can. For small differences like humour/humor, we just have to get used to it not always being the way we are used to. The full policy is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style#National_varieties_of_English" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style#National_varieties_of_English" rel="nofollow">here</a>. <a href="../../../e/n/c/User%7EEnchanter_c99f.html" title="User:Enchanter">Enchanter</a> 10:16, 7 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Archiving article discussions</span></h2>
<p>It sounds like a reasonable thing to do so you might 1) be bold and try it, 2) ask within the article discussion if anyone would object and if not, do it, 3) don't take this wrong, but you might find a more engaged admin to ask - I've been rather inactive lately and am pretty tied up by the outside world, too.</p>
<p>I'd suggest 2) as a good approach. Post a query, wait a day or two, and then if no one takes issue, go for it. You've always got your query for justification, and as long as you archive everything, I wouldn't think anyone would complain. Sorry I wasn't more help.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Re:Userpage dispute</span></h2>
<p>I blocked the account (as well as delete the userpage, but that's a different thing). There is an autoblocker, which I have no control over, that does block IPs used by blocked accounts in certain situations (I think, but not totally sure, doing things like trying to register new accounts etc.) so as long as Benedictwest behaves, he should be ok. Tell him to email me if he has a problem with it. Looks like 195.93.21.36 (an AOL IP) is involved as well...</p>
<p>Oh and could you slow down how fast you archive your talk page- it's usual to wait while after a conversation is over before archiving.

<dd><i>Hi there - First of all I would read some of the above guides and guidelines, and then you can set about writing a really great article. To start an article, simply type in the title to the search bar, and if it already exists it will come up with the article, if it doesn't it will come up with a list of options, click on create article, and type away. I would suggest looking at the edit text of some other articles to learn how to format the article and make it look good, remember you can copy, paste and change things. Most importantly, be bold about it all, if you make a major mistake, someone else will tidy it up, and everything is reversible. If you have any more questions or queries, don't hesitate to ask. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenjaminstewart05_6bfc.html" title="User:Benjaminstewart05">Benjaminstewart05</a> 17:48, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</i></dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Napster question</span></h2>
<p>Hi How do I get an official ruling as to whether links to free content on Napster.com are OK?</p>
<p>The content is free and very broad and I think would make a useful addition to the external links section on an artists page and to the discography. It is a commercial site and the content is supported by advertising but as the content is so useful and free I think it should be considered in the same way as links to IMDB, Rotten Tomatoes, All Music Guide etc</p>
<p>Thanks Waldzazi</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Hi there, well I couldn't find any guidelines on it. However as far as my legal knowledge goes (and that is not very far), it is absolutely not a copyright infringement because wikipedia is not responsible for the content on those pages. Indeed napster has its own wikipedia article, and the link to napster is on <a href="../../../n/a/p/Napster.html" title="Napster">napster</a>, so I believe it is fine to create that link. Wikipedia is not responsible for it, wikipedia can't be prosecuted for its content, the link is simply to provide further information about the website and to show a source for the article. However I wouldn't go on an article and say that you can download such and such's music for free here, as that would be a copyright infringement. I hope that I have cleared up any confusion. If you have any more questions, feel free to ask.

<dd>There should be no problem as the content is perfectly legal.</dd>
<dd>Napster was able to cajole the RIIA into offering free content for a portion of the ad revenues.</dd>
<dd>This will probably come up again as an admin blocked me for spamming, his reason being that Napster was a commercial site.</dd>
<dd>I pointed out that there are many links to commercial sites on the Wiki including thousands of links to Amazon.com and stated my opinion that they have been and should be judged by their usefullness.</dd>
<dd>He seemed concerned that Napster not be favored over the Itunes Store and as Itunes offers no free content I found this argument kind of weak.</dd>
<dd>He was also of the opinion that the Napster links were of no value.</dd>
<dd>I pointed out to him as an example that Napster has over 71 albums by Bob Dylan that are free and that a link in an encylopedia entry for Bob Dylan would certainly be enhanced by a link to practically his entire recorded output which can then be listened to by the song, the entire album or even in its entirety for free.</dd>
<dd>He didnt agree and since I feel the point is kind of obvious I suspect he has a bias towards the Itunes store.</dd>
<dd>Oh well, I imagine this will get kicked around until there is some official decision on it.</dd>

Calling a group of people stupid is rather insulting ("Treat others as you would have them treat you"). If you met me in person, you mind find me agreeing with your views, but here on Wikipedia we have to realise that it's an international project. Getting into disputes over this sort of thing doesn't really help develop an encyclopedia. If you think there is a good case for that article to be re-named (i.e. moved) then to be honest the way you wrote that message on the talk page isn't going to help the cause ("spelling it wrongly just makes you look stupid").
