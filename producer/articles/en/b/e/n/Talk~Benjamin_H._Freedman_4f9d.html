<p>"The Right Honorable Francis Neilson, a member of Parliament, wrote a book in England called Makers of War (pp. 149150). <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0895620936/102-4784636-5940114?v=glance&amp;n=283155" class="external text" title="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0895620936/102-4784636-5940114?v=glance&amp;n=283155" rel="nofollow">Makers of war</a> Mr. Neilson's book created such a sensation that Mr. Neilson was compelled to resign his seat in Parliament."</p>
<p>A Member of Parliament cannot be compelled to resign. Even to resign voluntarily, he must use a technicality. as Neilsom did whem he resigned as a pacfist. His forced resignation is another of Freedman's numerous falsehoods. In the paragraph that follows, I have simply replaced your text with a paste from Freedman online from "The Hidden Tyranny." I have done this to make clear that im Freedman's own text "The aurhor" crossing the Channel om the non-sunk Sussex was Freedman himself. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamhook_6292.html" title="User:Samhook">Samhook</a> 07:07, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
In Mr. Neilson's book Makers of War (pp. 149-150), he discloses many unsuspected and undisclosed reasons for the outbreak of World War I in Europe in August 1914. With reference to the alleged sinking of the S.S. Sussex in the English Channel, Mr. Neilson emphasizes: "/n America, Woodrow Wilson, desperate to find a pretext to enter the war, found it at last in the 'sinking' of the Sussex in mid-channel. Someone invented a yarn that American lives had been lost. With thus excuse he went to Congress for a declaration of war. Afterwards, the Navy found that the Sussex had not been sunk, and that no lives had been lost. " This author crossed the English Channel many times on the S.S. Sussex. The alleged sinking of the S.S. Sussex was the figment of an over-worked Zionist imagination. The alleged sinking of the S.S. Sussex was conceived in the imagination of a Zionist to facilitate the purpose planned and successfully executed.</p>
<p>Freedman ends the quotation marks after "no lives had been lost." He then refers to himself as "This author," a common phrase to replace "I." Some writers have been taught never to say "I." but perhaps Freedman was conscious that he was lying here. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamhook_6292.html" title="User:Samhook">Samhook</a> 07:07, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This person, by the name of BENJAMIN and surname FREEDMAN, was American of Jewish origin. He claimed to be Jewish and even Zionist in the past.

<p>Dear Tom, in the <a href="../../../m/o/s/WP%7EMOSBIO_b227.html" title="WP:MOSBIO">WP:MOSBIO</a> we can read "Ethnicity should generally not be emphasized in the opening unless it is relevant to the subject's notability". One of the reassons why Freedman was popular is because he was an apostate Jew and anti-Zionist. [Unsigned]</p>
<p>I agree with unsigned, directly above me, that being Jewish is directly relevant to being anti-Zionist and contributed to his notability. <a href="../../../w/j/h/User%7EWjhonson_d987.html" title="User:Wjhonson">Wjhonson</a> 05:13, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've found some more citation to Freedman in the New York Times from various dates. MOST interestingly, there is a claim that he was somehow connected to the Mufti in 1946.

<p>One can not claim, as has been edited into the section "" and then delete evidence when it is provided? It is completely relevant because if such media control exists now the point is validated. Which is what the speech is about the speech is about the future as much as it is about the past.</p>

<p>Thank you I am everyday becoming more familiar, essentially your right , so then i could claim that to opposing side is doing this also with "At the time of which he was speaking, "media" meant essentially newspapers, pamphlets, and newsreels and Joseph Pulitzer and Adolph Ochs were remarkable for the fact of their Jewish descent among newspaper owners, the great majority of their colleagues being gentiles"</p>

<ul>
<li>Sure. That's also argumentation. I'm not sure about that whole section, though. It's entitled, "Claims of Jewish control of newspapers"; what relevance does the "traffic light quote" have to those claims? Germany's Jews were doing quite well in the period he is citing (pre-WWI); they were full and active members of German society. Meanwhile, it doesn't seem reasonable to use the word "evidence" in conjunction with his "long story" quote -- that's not evidence, that's an assertion of evidence without actually presenting evidence. --<a href="../../../j/p/g/User%7EJpgordon_73d0.html" title="User:Jpgordon">jpgordon</a><sup><small><a href="../../../j/p/g/User_talk%7EJpgordon_1c5c.html" title="User talk:Jpgordon">∇∆∇∆</a></small></sup> 18:02, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>The "long story" quotation is not merely a refusal to presemt evidence rather than a presemtation of evidence but also irrelevant to the Jewish control of newspapers. It's Freedman's claim to have evidence--which he did not present--for his claim that unnamed Zionists approached the British government and offered to inveigle the US into the war in exchange for Palestine. I've reverted the passage to correspond with the facts on the ground. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamhook_6292.html" title="User:Samhook">Samhook</a> 01:36, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>It has been re-worded to explain the meaning of the quote it was moved by someone to the World wars, section. the quote demonstrates the argument/claim that most or all mass media was controlled at the time by Zionists / ”Jewish” interests.-<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheblackbay_d869.html" title="User:Theblackbay">Theblackbay</a> 08:10, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Also that Encarta quote. Please Samhook when you insert "he provides no evidence for this claim" don't place it directly in front of the next line which asserts the evidence.</p>
<p>here is the B H Freedman Quote for you just to ponder a minute:</p>
<p>"After we got into the war, the Zionists went to Great Britain and they said: "Well, we performed our part of the agreement. Let's have something in writing that shows that you are going to keep your bargain and give us Palestine after you win the war." They didn't know whether the war would last another year or another ten years. So they started to work out a receipt. The receipt took the form of a letter, which was worded in very cryptic language so that the world at large wouldn't know what it was all about. And that was called the Balfour Declaration.</p>
<p>The Balfour Declaration was merely Great Britain's promise to pay the Zionists what they had agreed upon as a consideration for getting the United States into the war."</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Sorry, but a Freedman claim is not evidence of anything. When he can be checked against the record, he is almost always purveying falsehood.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p><b>And</b> here is the Encarta Quote for you to ponder also:</p>
<p>"The immediate purpose was to win for the Allied cause in World War I the support of Jews and others in the warring nations and in neutral countries such as the United States." ('Balfour Declaration," Microsoft® Encarta® Online Encyclopaedia 2000).</p>
<p>If as you assert B H Freedman was a "lying charlatan" is then also Encarta Encyclopaedia a lying charlatan Encyclopaedia?\</p>
<dl>
<dd>This snippet from Encarta deals with British motivations for issuing the Balfour Declaration. No one has ever disputed that Zionists urged the establishment of a Jewish homeland in Palestine and that the British were thoorughly aware that acceding to this desire would influence public opinion in various neutal countries in favor of the Allies. This is what the Encarta snippet says. It says nothing whatever about Freedman's claim that certain unnamed Zionists promised the British that they would inveigle the US into the war. This claim still stands with no other support than the word of a man proven a disseminator of falsehood after falsehood on the plain record. The same is true for his claims that Woodrow Wilson was blackmailed into declaring war.</dd>
</dl>
<p><b>Hello</b> Samhook you seem to be talking in yourself into the obvious denial of the plain facts as they seem to be here, the English Issued the Balfour Declaration it's a fact, maybe you can show us all of this other motive this urge that the British all of a sudden had to declare support for a Jewish homeland in Palestine, as I’m sure you know the Balfour Dec was issued NoV 2 1917 , and the Americans Joined the War earlier that year in what April 6? 7 months after the fact of US entry, the British issue the Receipt B H Freedman claims.</p>
<p>If this assertion is untrue as you say it is perhaps you can tell me, us, the world, why the British would do this after the US has entered the war, if they did not agree to it earlier? as Franklin Roosevelt once said:</p>
<p><b>“In politics, nothing happens by accident. If it happens, you can bet it was planned that way.”</b> Franklin Roosevelt (1882-1945)</p>
<p>So you are arguing that the Balfour declaration was a spontaneous cognitive gesture of philanthropic charity by Arthur James Balfour and the British empire? if not then why did they issue it after the US had entered?. -<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheblackbay_d869.html" title="User:Theblackbay">Theblackbay</a> 10:01, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>And your explanations for the "Balfour Declaration"?</b> in fact i predicted this long ago, When all one thought one knew about one thing was incorrect, one doesn’t like to hear it in fact I’ve seen the anger maybe a million times. First is generally anger then dismissal then some of us would rather delete the history so that we feel better knowing that "Millions of libraries" agree with us when we delete it, so that "we" can know that "we" haven't been lied to our whole life, so that "we" know that the <b>foundations</b> we have had built for us, that we have all our idea's based on are really very sound ... <b>aren’t they?</b></p>
<p>Because if we start to take on <b>ONE</b> alternative view that is obviously backed up by evidence(as we have and will have seen), we might have to change our minds on other things (such is the domino our "education" structure... as we have seen here.) We might have to re-assess all of our foundations, an understandable large discomfort to a person officially de-educated by post WW2 propaganda recently after that war relatively speaking.</p>

<p>There seem to be a few minor problems with the most recent "improvement" in Jewish Control of the Newspapers section:</p>
<p>Critics claim that he offered no evidence for these statements, However, the Associated Press was founded in 1846 by Moses Yale Beach, Joseph Pulitzer and Adolph Ochs. These three were remarkable for the fact of their Jewish descent among newspaper owners in the U.S.A where the great majority of their colleagues were gentiles.[citation needed]</p>

On the other hand, there is no evidence that he was a Jew. People of pathetically limited education sometimes assume that anyone named Moses must be a Jew, but the fact is that names from the Hebrew Bible have always been popular amomg Christians. Cf. Samuel Adams, Abraham Lincoln, Aaron Burr, &amp;c., &amp;c. Beach's middle name of Yale suggests a connection with the founder of Yale University, a Congregationalist cleric. and there is nothing peculiarly Jewish about his surname. I have been compelled to revert this amusing passage back to something with a better grip on reality. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamhook_6292.html" title="User:Samhook">Samhook</a> 18:22, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Samhook the original text noted Adolph S. Ochs, Joseph Pulitzer as notable Jewish newspaper owners then changes were made to it after I added Moses Yale Beach for whom a reference of religion at this time seems to be of an unknown quantity, something for the researcher in all of us.</p>

<dd>You seem to have the relation between research and publication turned around. As you now admit, you have no information as to the religion or ethnicity of Moses Yale Beach.

For what it may be worth, the name is sound Connecticut Yankee, and it is unlikely there was much of a Jewish community in Wallingford in 1800, where and when Beach was born. But I'm not claiming that Beach was a Congregationalist, and would not do so without having verifiable evidence to back me up. You, on the other hand, have claimed that he was a Jew.

<p>Sam you seem to think that it's OK to remove Freedman's reasoning because it isn't "true". That is not relevant. How he reasoned is how he reasoned. If it's ridiculous then so be it.

<dd>Not my position ar all. Consider the sequence of edits here. I noted that Freedman offered no evidence for his assertion that Zionists offered to embroil the US in WWI in exchange for Palestine. Another editor said that he did offer evidence, and then inserted not evidence but the assertion itself. Primarily in the interests of coherence, I reverted this substitution of asseretion for evidence. This is, it seems to me, already an inchoherent article, one badly in need of total recasing without regard to its substance.

<p>Either I'm reading wrong, or someone's practicing <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a> here. This section is particularly problematic, which is why several of us have been removing it:</p>
<p><i>He provides evidence for this claim in the form of the Balfour Declaration:</i></p>
<p><i>Balfour Declaration of 1917, a letter to Walter Rothschild, 2nd Baron Rothschild, a then-leader of the British Jewish community.</i></p>
<p><i>"When the British originally created the Balfour Declaration they were just looking for support in the World War I, but also had some long term affects in mind." <a href="http://www.ccds.charlotte.nc.us/History/MidEast/04/shembo/shembo.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ccds.charlotte.nc.us/History/MidEast/04/shembo/shembo.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></i></p>
<p><i>"The immediate purpose was to win for the Allied cause in World War I the support of Jews and others in the warring nations and in neutral countries such as the United States." ('Balfour Declaration," Microsoft® Encarta® Online Encyclopedia 2000)</i></p>
<p><i>Promoters of Freedman's claims, such as Curtis Bean Dall (son-in-law of Franklin D. Roosevelt) claim Freedman was well-enough placed to have an informed opinion on such matters as the First and Second World Wars, and on the financial collapse of Germany, to give him credit in various books written on such subject(s).</i></p>
<p>The citation is pretty much worthless; <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> do not include primary school websites. (Or maybe it's a high school, not sure.) No mention of Freedman is made in that source, anyway; nor is it made in Encarta. Thus, this is argumentation attempting to support Freedman's position, or to explain it without reference to Freedman. This doesn't work at all, and is OR (and bad OR, to boot). What did Freedman say about the Balfour Declaration? What exactly was his "evidence"?</p>
<p>We'll need citations for Dall's claims, but they have no bearing on the "evidence" either.</p>

<p><b>watch how it flows</b>.... The verifiable Balfour declaration information will flow to the Balfour Declaration Article, as will the Newspaper(s) information to those relevant article(s) , it can never be covered.</p>
<p><b>The B H Freedman quote(s)</b> will flow to him or.... the B H Freedman article will ultimately be chipped away in such a sharpening of the "Reference Pencil" to a point where “nothing” is verifiable and ultimately the article is deleted. Some people would feel much more comfortable, I myself would laugh...... let me lay it out for you...</p>
<p>Take a step back, Believe it or not people like me are trying to Save Wikipedia you see as this universal information Exchange flows, no one individual small square (wikipedia) in that vast Matrix of universally Verifiable Core information can delete what is becoming generally accepted verifiable information it will simply flow Past, Over, Under and Around, that small square.</p>
<p>And then informed humans will get to the point where the information from that "small square" will be understood to have a distinct “in-balance” and will be known and used less and less as a “balanced” verifiable point of information exchange.</p>
<p>as I’m sure you could see already? I could go on, We could talk about the self fulfilling prophecy that could exist in such a “free” “controlled” wikipedia the one by which we generally only have people with a single general taboo point of view contribute, the eventual effects… so on so on….</p>

<p>Aside from Wikipedia, Freedman’s web existence is almost entirely limited to various quasi-Nazi sites where he is offered forth as “defector” who spilled the beans on his fellow Elders of Zion who embroiled the US in WWI. Yet surprisingly, in none of the various texts attributed to him does he speak of himself as a Jew. The contention that he was appears to be owing purely to <a href="../../../k/e/v/Kevin_Alfred_Strom_e24f.html" title="Kevin Alfred Strom">Kevin Alfred Strom</a>, his original web promoter, on the sites successively of the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Alliance_b1f0.html" title="National Alliance">National Alliance</a> and <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Vanguard_9439.html" title="National Vanguard">National Vanguard</a>. New kid on the block though I may be, I will venture the judgment that these sites do not meet the non-partisan test. These sites are also the source for the idea that Freedman became a Catholic convert. Although his writings contain material consistent with this idea—he claimed to have been a long-time intimate of <a href="../../../f/r/a/Francis_Cardinal_Spellman_471f.html" title="Francis Cardinal Spellman">Francis Cardinal Spellman</a> and gave effusive praise to an undoubted Jewish convert to Catholicism—he nowhere calls himself a Catholic. Highly partisan sites remain the only source advanced here.</p>
<p>The article as it stands contains some material from non-partisan sources, but it mostly deals with the question of whether Freedman actually existed. We are in debt to wjohnson for setting this question to rest.</p>
<p>But in general, even for the texts of what Freedman is supposed to have said, the article relies on highly partisan sources, and an editor bent on applying the verifiability requirement would not leave enough to show why Freedman is notable, as indeed he is. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamhook_6292.html" title="User:Samhook">Samhook</a> 15:47, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The audio of the speech has been on the usenet for over a decade. In that entire time, not one, single, person, has ever claimed that it was fake. Even though there are certainly enough vested interests, interested in doing so. The fact that only sites with a point-of-view would be interested in publishing it, in no way reduces the fact that the audio itself is the actual primary source that it claims to be. The link to the audio is already in the article. The links to the transcription are only for ease, as many people would probably not want to listen to a long audio, in order to verify one sentence.

<p>2. Were the media present, and if so, how did they report the speech? If they weren't present, why was that so?</p>
<p>It would be interesting to know if there is any pre-internet report or version of the speech and if so whether it is authentic. (Incidentally, tapes can be faked quite easily).</p>

<li>As far as I can tell, all of the recordings out there come from the same place -- National Vanguard was hawking them on usenet in the mid-'90s.

<li>I've just received a copy of Zworkin, which has some additional detail on Freedman suggesting--from an untainted source--that he is mildly notable as the orchestrator of a smear-job on an amti-communist liberal in 1950. Given his iconic status on Jew-hating websites, he's more notable tham that, of course. I raised the textual issue earlier in this discussion. Aside from snippets in various books, all I know about the Works of BHF comes from tainted sources. The nearest thing to a text I have is a copy of the bizarrely named "Facts are Facts." But even this was published at some unspecified date clearly much later tham the original text by a publishing house whose CEO is now doing time for fraud.

<li>You see me as a good deal more conspiracy-minded than I am. I was merely lamenting the absence of a single Freedman publication with so much as a date. (For what it is worth. by the way--if anything--my judgment as a trained linguistic is that the Freedman of the Willard Hotel tape is perfectly consistent with what we are told of his biography: the accent is that of a cultivated New Yorker in the German-Jewish aristocracy born in the late 19th C.) No one who has read "Facts Are Facts" could imagine conspirators trying to father it on anyone. It is definitely not the revelation of a defecting Elder of Zion, but a compilation of Freedman's bizarre and ignorant philological and ethnic theories.

<li>Likewise. Once more into the bteach, dear friends, once more:
<ul>
<li>No one disputes the reality of the Balfour Declaration. I doubt there are many historians who do not think that it was issued largely out of public relations onsiderations.</li>
<li>But the Freedman claim being discussed here is not that the Balfour Declaration was issued, but that an unnamed group of Zionists offered to embroil the United States in the war as the price of the Declaration. For this, he provided no evidence whatever. The existemce of the Declaration is not evidence, nor is his claim to have attended the Versailles Comferemce, which even if true does not bear on the issue. Here, as everywhere in Freedman's historical revisionism, he provides only unsupported assertions. Since many of these are flatly false on the historical record, I am astounded that you give him any credence whatever. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamhook_6292.html" title="User:Samhook">Samhook</a> 00:59, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I here transcribe an article from the NYT in its entirety: BEGIN QUOTE New York Times, May 7 1948 "Witness Admits Aiding Arab Cause "Freedman, Testifying in Libel Case, Cooperated on Note to State Department "Counsel for the Non-Sectarian Anti-Nazi League offered evidence yesterday that Benjamin Freedman, anti-Zionist founder of the League for Peace With Justice in Palestine, cooperated with an Arab publicist in preparing a memorandum for presentation to the State Department in behalf of the Arab cause. "Mr Freedman was on the stand for the third day in Mid-Manhattan Magistrates' Court where his attorney, Hallam M. Richardson, is seeking a criminal libel complaint against the anti-Nazi league. Under intensive cross-examination by Julius L. Goldstein, the witness identified as in his handwriting several notes scribbled on a newspaper clipping telling of a meeting between Arab delegates and then Acting Secretary of State Dean Acheson. "The article, which was published in a New York newspaper on May 11, 1946 has as its heading: "U.S. Reassures Arabs on Any Palestine Shift." It went on to say that Mr. Acheson told his Arab visitors that no policy changes would be made without consultation with them and with the Jews. "In an adjoining column Mr. Freedman had written: "It was worth all the effort." Alongside a paragraph reporting that the Arabs had read to Mr. Acheson a memorandum outlining their position on Palestine, there was this comment, which Mr. Freedman admitted was in his handwriting: "Prepared by myself and Katibah Thursday. "Later "Katibah" was identified by Mr. Goldstein as Habib Hatibah, editor for the Institute of Arab-American Affairs. In earlier testimony Mr. Freedman denied that he had anything to do with the May 10 conference or with the preparation of the memorandum. However, he admitted making numerous telephone calls to the State Department and to Ministries of the Arab states. "The heading was interrupted frequently to permit other cases to be brought briefly before Magistrate Hyman Busherl. At one point, the magistrate broke in to inquire into the status of Mr. Freedman's religious affiliations. ""Let me get something straight," the magistrate said. "The other day you said you were born of Jewish parents but you also speak of studying to be a Catholic. Are you a Catholic?" "Mr. Freedman replied that he had taken instructions to become a Catholic but that "certain pressure was brought to bear" that kept him from being baptized. He suggested that the "pressure" was from "Zionists." ""Oh. I see." said Magistrate Bushel. "The Jews put you out and the Catholics won't have you." The audience laughed. "I was too discreet to go back to the Jesuit priests under whom I studied and press the issue." the witness explained. END QUOTE</p>

<p>And another BEGIN QUOTE New York Times, May 8, 1948, pg 4 "Anti-Zionist Tells of Dinner in Capital "Benjamin Freedman, anti-Zionist founder of the League for Peace With Justice in Palestine, testified yesterday in Mid-Manhattan Magistrates' Court that last winter he discussed partition at a dinner of fifty-two members of Congress and that he gave to each Representative literature and advertisements opposing partition and political Zionism. "Mr. Freedman who said he paid the bill for the dinner, which amounted to either $452 or $482, told of the dinner under examination by Julius I Goldstein, counsel for the Non-Sectarian Anti-Nazi League. Mr Freedman's attorney, Hallam M. Richardson, is seeking a criminal libel complaint against the anti-Nazi league. "Mr. Freedman said the dinner followed a meeting with Representative Edward Gosset of Texas, at which he discussed the Palestine situation. Mr. Freedman said he later continued the discussion with nine other Representatives and still later, spoke at the dinner, held at the Mayflower Hotel in Washington. "Mr. Goldstein asked the witness about various corporations and individuals, most of whom Mr. Freedman said he did not know. He declared, however that he was acquainted with Charles Passman, president of the Eagle Lock Company. He said he was "very friendly" with Mr. Passman and frequently visited him and his wife. "Magistrate Hyman Bushel, before whom the testimony is being taken, remarked at one point in the lengthy proceedings that, "I have only nine years more to go as a magistrate; do you think you'll finish by then?" "The hearing was adjourned until 11 A.M. next Wednesday." END QUOTE</p>

<p>This one discussed what exactly this lawsuit was about. BEGIN QUOTE New York Times, Jul 8, 1946 "Ready to Meet Suit Jewish Group Says "Officers and members of the executive committee of the American Jewish Committee, against whom a suit for $5,000,000 damages was filed recently in the Supreme Court by Benjamina H. Freedman of The League for Peace with Justice in Palestine, announced their readiness yesterday to meet the issues cited in the complaint. "Dr. John Slawson, executive vice president of the American Jewish Committee, issued a statement from its offices, 386 Fourth Avenue, that said: "This suit brought by Mr. Freedman will give us an opportunity to demonstrate in court the nature and character of the so-called 'League for Peace with Justice in Palestine' and Mr. Freedman's role in it. "Named as defendants are Joseph M. Proskauer, president of the American Jewish Committee; Jacob Blaustein, chairman of the executive committee; National Ohrbach, treasurer; Edward Lazansky and Fred Lazarus Jr., vice presidents; Alan M. Stroock, vice chairman of the executive committee, and Ralph E. Samuel, chairman of the New York Chapter of the American Jewish Committee. "Mr. Freedman sued because of a memorandum circularized two months ago by the American Jewish Committee, which said that advertisements in newspapers, inserted in behalf of the league and purporting to speak for Christian, Jewish and Arab groups, really represented only Mr. Freedman. The memorandum said also that Mr. Freedman did not have the backing of any organization or group and that he was engaged in propaganda to keep Palestine closed to Jewish immigration." END QUOTE</p>

<dd>I think you really need to get some broader support for your interpretation of the reliability and usability of sources. General practice on Wikipedia is and has been that unreliable sites may not be used as sources, period. In particular, sites dedicated to the propagation of falsehood (i.e., holocaust denier sites such as vho) can not in any way be considered reliable, and are not allowed except as examples of their particular diseases.

<dd>A transcript is a process carried out by living human beings, and transcripts placed on unreliable sites can be altered in any way those unreliable sources see fit.

<li>That's a good reason to edit-war, yeah. I'm actually somewhat confused. Why do you keep bringing up the transcript? It's not even in play in the interchange we've been having in the last few days; the transcript you were pointing to is on jahtruth.org, while you've been re-inserting (and jayjg and I have been removing) references to the far more pernicious vho.org, an explicitly holocaust denial website, and the references are not to a transcript of audio material, but rather a reprint of an article from the Journal of Historical Review (also a guaranteed unreliable source.) Oh, I see - another is www.sweetliberty.org/issues/israel/freedman.htm, which at the very top indicates that the contents of a transcription have been drifting (is that the one you're concerned about?), which isn't too useful for reliability either. I've suggested a compromise over at <a href="../../../r/s/_/WT%7ERS_bc01.html" title="WT:RS">WT:RS</a> -- put a disclaimer of some sort on top of the article saying that essential and reliable biographical data has not been found, so data from unreliable sources is being used. Anyway, I'm stopping battling on this other than on talk pages; my apologies for warring.

<dd>Thanks yes I forgot to take those extra qualuudes this morning. I'm familiar with the policy, I contribute to the policy pages from time-to-time myself. We are allowed to summarize, in fact that's the majority of what we do is summarize and connect statements together to make an article flow. However in this situation, the issue isn't whether I'm doing OR, it's that the sites in question are deemed unreliable by some editors. I challenge that categorization. As for the primary versus secondary consideration, I would note that this speech, by the subject of the article, is usable. However since a 90 minute speech is not very easy for the casual reader to use, there should be no problem linking to the transcript of that speech. In particular, he states that he knew Morgenthau. Another editor removed that, even though Freedman himself states it, in his speech. Remembering that wikipedia is not about *truth* but about *verifiability*. If the man states it, in his own voice, in his own speech, which is in the public domain, it's verifiable. <a href="../../../w/j/h/User%7EWjhonson_d987.html" title="User:Wjhonson">Wjhonson</a> 18:04, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My problems is that I am not sure where "summarizing" ends and where "personal interpretation" ends with a lot of editors here at Wiki. So when I source check I look for it to match almost word for word. I'm not accusing of you of going over the line, but just stating my bias against editors summarizing things. That said, didn't Mr. Freedman write a book? Wouldn't his biographical information be in the book? That should be sufficient to deal with the first source. As for the transcripts, the problem is that it seems that the consensus here is that it was not published by a reputable site in relation to the site. So I am not sure it can be used here at Wiki, unless another publisher is found. Also, if we were to find an agreed upon reliable publisher of the transcript, we'd still have to worry about synthesizing information, which is a form of original research. Can Freedman's book be used as a source for the other information?<a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERamsquire_2238.html" title="User:Ramsquire">Ramsquire</a> 18:26, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The first link is merely a passing reference to WHEN he died. Nothing more or less. To falsely characterize this link as what it's not deceptive. Robert John, who had interviewed Freedman, knew when he died. That's it. It's not a subversive attempt to prove that he lived a long time because he was an anti-Zionist or anything else. Drilling up to the index page and then shouting "It's a Holocaust Denial site"! is ridiculous. First because it's not, and second because this transcript of a paper presented at a conference, and hosted on this site, is only being used to show when Freedman died. <a href="../../../w/j/h/User%7EWjhonson_d987.html" title="User:Wjhonson">Wjhonson</a> 17:23, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Jpgordon this is just my personal view but the idea of "holocaust denial" is laughable and silly it just sounds childlike to me, I could understand revision but Holocaust Denial sounds like something year 4 children yell at a 6 year old because he stole some orange juice.</p>
<p>of course the EU makes it verifiable with it's universally hated draconian law against free thought and speech but that’s just the world we live in.</p>
<p>To even use it as an excuse to invalidate verifiable data is incorrect in my opinion. but that's just my opinion. -<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheblackbay_d869.html" title="User:Theblackbay">Theblackbay</a> 20:33, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Benjamin Freedman is a neo nazi hoax, pure and simple. There is not one shred evidence of his existence outside of neo nazi, white supremacist, and some Islamist, web sites. Many have differing and conflicting so called biographies. Yet all are bound by one overiding common theme, antisemitism. Propogating this myth is a diservice to those seeking truth and knowlege and a boon to those who seek to propogate the hatred that resulted in the murder of millions and a world war. Michael Allen</p>
<p><br />
If Benjamin Freedman was just a neo nazi hoax, Arnold Forster would not have mentioned him as a real person in the book Square One (ISBN: 1-55611-104-5, hardcover, on page 121) Nikolas Ojala</p>

<dd>Yes apparently Michael Allen did not actually read the article. There are many, independent sources showing that Freedman actually existed. We'd have more if more newspapers had historical articles online. We're just lucky that at least the New York Times does. <a href="../../../w/j/h/User%7EWjhonson_d987.html" title="User:Wjhonson">Wjhonson</a> 06:51, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It's looking a heck of a lot better there; really good research work.

<p>Hello as the external link named "the Benjamin Freedman Speech" links to a unreferenced amateur document called "the 25 lies of Benjamin Freedman" which is full of errors and historical mistruths that when countered and corrected are reverted back to the original error I am deleting it.</p>
<p>It may have some use in the Criticisms section but as it is unreferenced and seems to be authored by some one with a very controlled basic knowledge of WW1, I’m not sure as to what use it would be there.</p>
<p>If the Principal of Wikipedia is to give facts then this external link goes against everything Wiki is about.</p>
<p><b>I tracked this deleted link down. While it is polemical to a degree that would not pass muster here as an article, and lacking documentation, it reflects a far better knowledge of WWI than that evinced by Freedman. It would appear that this anonymous editor--not identified by an IP address--simply disagrees with statemens made in the link and so has killed it. Can we all do this? And what's wrong with amateurs? Is the anonymous editor a professional encyclopaedist? If so, from what encyclopaedia or encyclopaedias does he make his living? Inquiring minds want to know.</b> <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamhook_6292.html" title="User:Samhook">Samhook</a> 05:14, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>It serves no purpose to append "but he presented no evidence for this claim" after any controversial claim. It's an empty sentence, and the repetition sounds contrived to smear without citation. Possibly a better approach would be to simply say, "He made many controversial claims." or something to that effect. Really you should be citing an authority for the concept that his claims are suspect in the first place. And that authority should not be yourself. <a href="../../../w/j/h/User%7EWjhonson_d987.html" title="User:Wjhonson">Wjhonson</a> 09:33, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
