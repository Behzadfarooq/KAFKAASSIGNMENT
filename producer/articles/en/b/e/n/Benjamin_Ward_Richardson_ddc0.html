<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/n/Benjamin_Ward_Richardson_ddc0.html" title="Edit section: Education">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Education</span></h2>
<p>Richardson was born at <a href="../../../s/o/m/Somerby.html" title="Somerby">Somerby</a> in <a href="../../../l/e/i/Leicestershire.html" title="Leicestershire">Leicestershire</a>, the only son of Benjamin Richardson and Mary Ward. He was educated by the Rev. W. Young Nutt at the Barrow Hill school in the same county. Being destined by the deathbed wish of his mother for the medical profession, his studies were always directed to that end, and he was apprenticed early to Henry Hudson, the <a href="../../../s/u/r/Surgery.html" title="Surgery">surgeon</a> at Somerby.</p>
<p>He entered Anderson's University (now Anderson's College), <a href="../../../g/l/a/Glasgow.html" title="Glasgow">Glasgow</a>, in <a href="../../../1/8/4/1847.html" title="1847">1847</a>, but a severe attack of famine fever (either <a href="../../../t/y/p/Typhus.html" title="Typhus">typhus</a> or relapsing fever) that he caught while he was a pupil at St. Andrews, interrupted his studies, and led him to become an assistant, first to Thomas Browne of <a href="../../../s/a/f/Saffron_Walden_0389.html" title="Saffron Walden">Saffron Walden</a> in <a href="../../../e/s/s/Essex.html" title="Essex">Essex</a>, and afterwards to Edward Dudley Hudson at Littlebury, <a href="../../../n/a/r/Narborough.html" title="Narborough">Narborough</a>, near <a href="../../../l/e/i/Leicester.html" title="Leicester">Leicester</a>. Hudson was the elder brother of his former master.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/8/5/1854.html" title="1854">1854</a>, he was admitted M.A. and M.D. of St. Andrews, where he afterwards became a member of the university court, an assessor of the general council, and in <a href="../../../1/8/7/1877.html" title="1877">1877</a>, an honorary LL.D.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/n/Benjamin_Ward_Richardson_ddc0.html" title="Edit section: Career">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Career</span></h2>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/8/4/1849.html" title="1849">1849</a>, Richardson left Hudson and joined Dr. Robert Willis of <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barnes.html" title="Barnes">Barnes</a>, well known as the editor of the works of <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Harvey_b040.html" title="William Harvey">William Harvey</a>, and librarian of the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_College_of_Surgeons_of_England_bdbe.html" title="Royal College of Surgeons of England">Royal College of Surgeons of England</a> (1828 - <a href="../../../1/8/4/1845.html" title="1845">1845</a>). Richardson lived at <a href="../../../m/o/r/Mortlake.html" title="Mortlake">Mortlake</a>, and at about this time, became a member of "Our Club," where he met <a href="../../../d/o/u/Douglas_Jerrold_1a70.html" title="Douglas Jerrold">Douglas Jerrold</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/a/Thackeray.html" title="Thackeray">Thackeray</a>, Hepworth Dixon, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mark_Lemon_968e.html" title="Mark Lemon">Mark Lemon</a>, <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Doran_c826.html" title="John Doran">John Doran</a>, and <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Cruikshank_1a28.html" title="George Cruikshank">George Cruikshank</a>, of whose will he became an <a href="../../../e/x/e/Executor.html" title="Executor">executor</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/8/5/1850.html" title="1850">1850</a>, Richardson was admitted as a <a href="../../../l/i/c/Licentiate.html" title="Licentiate">licentiate</a> to the Faculty of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow. He became a faculty lecturer in <a href="../../../1/8/7/1877.html" title="1877">1877</a>, and was elected a Fellow on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_3.html" title="June 3">June 3</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/7/1878.html" title="1878">1878</a>.</p>
<p>Richardson was a founder, and for thirty-five times in succession the President of the St. Andrews Medical Graduates' Association. He was admitted as a member of the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_College_of_Physicians_of_London_73fa.html" title="Royal College of Physicians of London">Royal College of Physicians of London</a> in <a href="../../../1/8/5/1856.html" title="1856">1856</a>, and was elected a Fellow in <a href="../../../1/8/6/1865.html" title="1865">1865</a>, serving the office of <a href="../../../m/a/t/Materia_medica.html" title="Materia medica">materia medica</a> lecturer in <a href="../../../1/8/6/1866.html" title="1866">1866</a>. In <a href="../../../1/8/6/1867.html" title="1867">1867</a>, he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society, and delivered the Croonian lecture in <a href="../../../1/8/7/1873.html" title="1873">1873</a> on "The Muscular Irritability after Systemic Death."</p>
<p>Richardson moved to London in <a href="../../../1/8/5/1853.html" title="1853">1853</a> - 1854, and took a house at 12 Hinde Street, whence he moved to 25 Manchester Square. In 1854, he was appointed physician to the Blenbeim Street Dispensary, and in 1856 to the Royal Infirmary for Diseases of the Chest in the City Road. He was also physician to the Metropolitan Dispensary (1856), to the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marylebone.html" title="Marylebone">Marylebone</a>, and to the Margaret Street Dispensaries (1856), and in <a href="../../../1/8/9/1892.html" title="1892">1892</a>, he became physician to the London Temperance Hospital. For many years he was physician to the "Newspaper Press Fund" and to the "Royal Literary Fund", the committee of which, he was long an active member.</p>
<p>In 1854, Richardson became a lecturer on <a href="../../../f/o/r/Forensic_medicine.html" title="Forensic medicine">forensic medicine</a> at the Grosvenor Place School of Medicine, where he was afterwards appointed the first lecturer on public hygiene, posts which he resigned in <a href="../../../1/8/5/1857.html" title="1857">1857</a> for the lectureship on physiology. He remained dean of the school until 1865, when it was sold and, with all the other buildings in the old Tattersall's yard, demolished. Richardson was also a lecturer about this time at the College of Dentists, then occupying a part of the Polytechnic Institution in <a href="../../../r/e/g/Regent_Street_c823.html" title="Regent Street">Regent Street</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/8/6/1868.html" title="1868">1868</a>, Richardson was elected president of the Medical Society of London, and on several occasions, he was president of the health section of the Social Science Association, notably in <a href="../../../1/8/7/1875.html" title="1875">1875</a>, when he delivered a celebrated address at Brighton on "<a href="../../../h/y/g/Hygeia.html" title="Hygeia">Hygeia</a>," in which he told of what a city should be if sanitary science were advanced in a proper manner. In the same year he gave the Cantor lectures at the Society of Arts, taking "<a href="../../../a/l/c/Alcohol.html" title="Alcohol">alcohol</a>" as the subject.</p>
<p>Richardson was elected an honorary member of the Philosophical Society of America in <a href="../../../1/8/6/1863.html" title="1863">1863</a>, and of the Imperial Leopold Carolina Academy of Sciences in 1867.

<p>In 1854, Richardson was awarded the Fothergillian gold medal by the Medical Society of London for an essay on the "Diseases of the Fetus in Utero". In 1856, he gained the Astley Cooper triennial prize of 300 <a href="../../../g/u/i/Guineas.html" title="Guineas">guineas</a> for his essay on "The <a href="../../../c/o/a/Coagulation.html" title="Coagulation">Coagulation</a> of the Blood."</p>

<p>Richardson died at 25 Manchester Square on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_21.html" title="November 21">November 21</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/9/1896.html" title="1896">1896</a>, and his body was cremated at <a href="../../../b/r/o/Brookwood.html" title="Brookwood">Brookwood</a>, <a href="../../../s/u/r/Surrey.html" title="Surrey">Surrey</a>. He married, on <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_21.html" title="February 21">February 21</a>, Mary J. Smith of <a href="../../../m/o/r/Mortlake.html" title="Mortlake">Mortlake</a>, by whom he left two surviving sons and one daughter.</p>
<p>Richardson was a sanitary reformer, who busied himself with many of the smaller details of domestic sanitation which tend, in the aggregate, to prolong the average life in each generation. He spent many years in attempts to relieve pain among men by discovering and adapting substances capable of producing general or local <a href="../../../a/n/e/Anesthesia.html" title="Anesthesia">anesthesia</a>, and among animals by more humane methods of slaughter. He brought into use, no less than fourteen anesthetics, of which methylene bichloride is the best known, and he invented the first double-valved mouthpiece for use in the administration of chloroform. He also produced local insensibility by freezing the part with an ether spray, and he gave animals, <a href="../../../e/u/t/Euthanasia.html" title="Euthanasia">euthanasia</a> by means of a lethal chamber.</p>
<p>Richardson was an ardent and determined champion of total <a href="../../../a/b/s/Abstinence.html" title="Abstinence">abstinence</a>, for he held that alcohol was so powerful a drug that it should only be used by skilled hands in the greatest emergencies. He was also one of the earliest advocates of bicycling; he wrote 'Cycling as an Intellectual Pursuit' for <i>Longman's Magazine</i> in 1883. In 1863, he made known the peculiar properties of amyl nitrite, a drug which was largely used in the treatment of breast-pang (angina pectoris), and he introduced the bromides of quinine, iron and strychnia, ozonized ether, styptic and iodized colloid, peroxide of hydrogen, and ethylate of soda, substances which were soon largely used by the medical profession.</p>
<p>Richardson was one of the most prolific writers of his generation. He wrote biographies, plays, poems, and songs, in addition to his more strictly scientific work. He wrote the <a href="../../../a/s/c/Asclepiad.html" title="Asclepiad">Asclepiad</a>, a series of original researches in the science, art, and literature of medicine. A single volume was issued in <a href="../../../1/8/6/1861.html" title="1861">1861</a>, after which it appeared quarterly from <a href="../../../1/8/8/1884.html" title="1884">1884</a> to <a href="../../../1/8/9/1895.html" title="1895">1895</a>. He was the originator and the editor of the <i>Journal of Public Health and Sanitary Review</i> (<a href="../../../1/8/5/1855.html" title="1855">1855</a>). He contributed many articles, signed and unsigned, to the <a href="../../../l/a/n/Lancet.html" title="Lancet">Lancet</a>, the Medical Times and the Gazette.</p>
