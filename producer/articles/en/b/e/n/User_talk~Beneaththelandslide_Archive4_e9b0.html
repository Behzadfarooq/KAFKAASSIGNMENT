<p>Beneaththelandslide has done very good work on articles connected with Australia. Unfortunately, he is currently engaged in an edit war on the pages <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conservatism.html" title="Conservatism">Conservatism</a> and <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Conservatism_7eaa.html" title="American Conservatism">American Conservatism</a> where he has indulged in repeated name calling, refusal to compromise, and blanking. You can read the exhanges on the talk pages of those articles if you are interested. I would appreciate some input from others. In addition to my comment here, I am requesting mediation. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERick_Norwood_6566.html" title="User:Rick Norwood">Rick Norwood</a> 12:45, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Clearly, you have made excellent contributions to Wikipedia, and I am not sure what it is about conservatism that has led you to make rude remarks instead of discussing issues logically. I always try to keep my comments brief and to the point, but these are issues I have read about, observed, and thought about for many years. The current "debate" between liberals and conservatives is at least ninety percent utter nonsense, a brouhaha stirred up by politicians to get American voters off our fat asses and to the polls on election day. The real story of both liberalism and conservatism has been going on for thousands of years, and has very little to do with the current us/them red state/blue state debate. There is not that much difference between welfare and television on the one hand and bread and circuses on the other.

<dd>I am not sure why, but we are saying exactly the same thing, and yet you are not hearing what I am saying. You wrote, "Again, you demonstrate how narrow your outlook is in regards to political / philosophical thought. Move <i>beyond</i> <b>American</b> conservatism / liberalism - the terms used today in the USA bastardise these philosophies and wholly redefine and distort their meanings." Which is exactly what I said above, "The current "debate" between liberals and conservatives is at least ninety percent utter nonsense." Now, we are both reasonable people, and we seem to agree. Why are we having so much trouble communicating? <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERick_Norwood_6566.html" title="User:Rick Norwood">Rick Norwood</a> 15:58, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You are too intelligent to believe that all liberals are liars. Yes, I am a liberal. So what. That doesn't mean I have an "agenda", it just means that I have a set of beliefs. I doubt that my beliefs are that different from yours. I have never had trouble before working with intelligent conservatives. But you seem to have formed an opinion of me and of my beliefs based on a stereotype of what an American liberal is like. Almost all of your comments have addressed that stereotype, rather than the substantive statements in the article.</dd>

<p>I'm trying to talk to you rationally, but consider the following sentence of yours. "I don't believe in stereotypes - you do. By saying you're a "liberal" - zing - you've done it, you've shown how naive you are." Can't you see that is a stereotype, the stereotype of the "naive liberal".</p>
<p>And then you go on to say "I don't give a damn what someone's opinion / beliefs are in real life when working here." And yet you go on and on about how I'm a liberal. I have only mentioned my liberal beliefs in answer to questions on talk pages, never in articles.</p>
<p>You suggest that the criticism section is my criticism section. Actually, a number of people worked on that section long before you got here. I would have left it as it was if people hadn't started deleting it.</p>
<p>"Wikipedia has one view; the neutral view." No. Wikipedia represents all points of view. The idea that there is one right view, and all other views are wrong, is not the Wikipedia way. I don't expect you to take my word for this, so ask somebody who has been here for a while, someone whose views you respect and who is not involved in this controversy. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERick_Norwood_6566.html" title="User:Rick Norwood">Rick Norwood</a> 18:58, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hey and thanks for welcoming me&#160;:)</p>
<p>Yeah, it's odd - I've noticed almost every page has its own formatting. I created the template for Adelaide suburbs (based almost totally on the one we've been using over at <a href="../../../p/e/r/WP%7EPERTH_f120.html" title="WP:PERTH">WikiProject Perth</a>) primarily because many of them had either none at all, broken ones, or hand-coded ones. Have been doing mostly the suburbs around the Golden Grove and outer north eastern area and getting them as close to each other as possible, and hoping that my work will spawn ideas or research or photographic urges in others who can complete them&#160;:)</p>

<p>Hi. I am new to Wikipedia. I recently put info about the Burnside CFS and saw that you removed this information. I dont see why. If it was on their website then it should be able to go on the net. It also took a while for me to write. The majority of the information I wrote. As i am a member of the station. The images, from the Burnside CFS website dont have any copywrite on them. None that i know. Could you please explain why you removed them. --<a href="../../../m/i/t/User%7EMitmatt_cf00.html" title="User:Mitmatt">Mitmatt</a> | <a href="../../../m/i/t/User_talk%7EMitmatt_685c.html" title="User talk:Mitmatt">talk</a> 16:54, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I am very disappointed that significant edits have been made to the <a href="../../../m/a/x/Max_Stuart_3661.html" title="Max Stuart">Max Stuart</a> article without discussion on the talk page first, or at the very least concurrently. It does not seem appropriate for an article that has been nominated as a good article and is now undergoing peer review to fail to discuss significant changes. In particular removing the section on Indigenous politics seems to add no value and remove information. I do not believe such removal is justified. I am also disappointed at an unfree image being used as the primary image, I think it would be better to use no image, as per the discussion already on the talk page, particularly in relation to an indigenous Australian.--<a href="../../../a/y/a/User%7EAYArktos_139f.html" title="User:AYArktos">A Y Arktos</a>\<sup><a href="../../../a/y/a/User_talk%7EAYArktos_b1bb.html" title="User talk:AYArktos">talk</a></sup> 09:05, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I think you have failed to appreciate that life after release is a significant other life. It is significant in terms of time. It is significant in terms of contibution to society. It is a totally different chapter to the rape and murder in Ceduna. It needs to be treated accordingly. I have concerns about the image, not just its license, though that is a part of it, but also the cultural aspects and what it conveys - I believe it is prejudicial - instinct and prejudice on my part may be, but ... There are much later images of Stuart as an elder, I think it would be better to use one of those if we go down the fair use track.--<a href="../../../a/y/a/User%7EAYArktos_139f.html" title="User:AYArktos">A Y Arktos</a>\<sup><a href="../../../a/y/a/User_talk%7EAYArktos_b1bb.html" title="User talk:AYArktos">talk</a></sup> 09:18, 21 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Your edits had spelling mistakes. I have spent some time copyediting the article, ensuring there were no spelling or grammar errors. It is disappointing to say the least to find somebody introducing a number of careless errors as well as non-neutral language, for example, "young and committed lawyer".</li>

<dd>- The citation of (what is at present) footnotes 7, 9, 10 and 12 is not in accordance with {{<a href="../../../c/i/t/Template%7ECite_book_c666.html" title="Template:Cite book">cite book</a>}} which has parameters for page numbers. Moreover footnotes 7 and 10 are the same and could be combined with the tag &lt;ref name="???"/&gt;, or alternatively all of the footnotes referring to Crocker's book, given the Stuart case is apparently covered in only a few pages overall could be combined.</dd>
<dd>- There are unsourced assertions added in, for example, "Playford had recieved (sic) word from Canberra that Stuart's sentence would had adverse affects on the relationships Australia was developing with third world nations." - I assume this also comes from Crocker's book. Given the careful referencing that has been introduced into the article because of the controversial material, it would be a good idea for what is a rather bold assertion to be sourced.</dd>
<dd>- The order of the article and the subheadings had been discussed as part of the <i>good article</i> review process. The new order is in my view less logical, for example, to include the <i>News</i> sedition case as part of "Commentary" does not makes sense - it was part of the history of the Stuart case. Furthermore the new order gives even more weight to the case than before. As above, Stuart is not defined only by the murder, he has spent more of his life being a respected member of the community than he did in prison or committing crimes.</dd>
<dd>- With regard to "should he be portrayed in the image as an imprisoned murderer and child rapist, or a community elder and councillor?" That question is why I think no image is better than one which illustrates somebody at the expense of other roles. --<a href="../../../a/y/a/User%7EAYArktos_139f.html" title="User:AYArktos">A Y Arktos</a>\<sup><a href="../../../a/y/a/User_talk%7EAYArktos_b1bb.html" title="User talk:AYArktos">talk</a></sup> 10:27, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I have strenously upheld that he should indeed be categorised as a convicted murderer - see the talk page. I have attempted to reasonably discuss your changes with you and invited you to do the same. You failed to do so but rather spoke in offensive terms about the work of others. I do not own articles, but on the other hand I am as free to edit as others, especially when I am reverting edits with poor spelling and which fail to have a neutral point of view - there was plenty on the case in the previous iteration. You have self-declared as believing the man is defined by his crime. I see all people as whole and defined by their doings over their whole life. If somebody looks up Max Stuart, they are entitled to find on the wikipedia clearly signposted references to his role as Chairman of the Central Lands Council and other roles in indigenous politics. Those roles were not signposted by the sub-heading "Release".--<a href="../../../a/y/a/User%7EAYArktos_139f.html" title="User:AYArktos">A Y Arktos</a>\<sup><a href="../../../a/y/a/User_talk%7EAYArktos_b1bb.html" title="User talk:AYArktos">talk</a></sup> 02:38, 23 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>You yourself have asked for editor-review - take it from me that your proof reading skills are below par; "a lot better than some" is neither true nor good enough in my short experience of your editing on this article. You failed to fix even after pointed out to you. You also needed to be reminded of wikiquette and guidelines associated with being bold. Given your breaches of these guidelines, quite frankly it is not clear to me that you are aware of any others, eg plagiarism. "Mangled body" is emotive language, so is "hints from Canberra" - can't come from somebody who wasn't there and wasn't involved. That you are an experienced editor is unfortunately not apparent to me in my recent dealings with you. I look forward to your further work on the article causing me to revise my opinion.--<a href="../../../a/y/a/User%7EAYArktos_139f.html" title="User:AYArktos">A Y Arktos</a>\<sup><a href="../../../a/y/a/User_talk%7EAYArktos_b1bb.html" title="User talk:AYArktos">talk</a></sup> 03:30, 23 June 2006 (UTC)

<p>Actually, for once i am questioning whether some of Jack's edits aren't bad at all. What's wrong with the sub-headings in the Art &amp; Entertainment section? Are they really against the consensus?

<dl>
<dd>hmm - are you suggesting that by comparing it to Canberra which has featured article status and coincidentally no sub-headings, we can therefore deduce Sydney shouldn't have sub-headings? Where does it state sub-headings are not preferred? I look at jack's addition to the Art &amp; Entertainment section and (it pains me to say it) but i think it is fine - makes it easier to find something. --<a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerbabu_4bbf.html" title="User:Merbabu">Merbabu</a> 13:21, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Michael you seem to be one of the most active around SA Elections so hopefully you can help or guide me in the direction of someone who can.

The media and wikipedia don't censor factional support, but instead provide it in NPOV fashion, which I believe has been done but Waymat is not happy from the looks of it.

<p>"countless other groups have migrated here too with different languages" The German migrants where there first (not long after the colony was establised by the British empire), and once made up as much as "ten perecent" of the population. <a href="../../../m/y/r/User%7EMyrtone86_be3b.html" title="User:Myrtone86">Myr<b>tone</b></a></p>
<dl>
<dd>But those "coutless other groups" migrated more recently, these more recent waves of migration were/are not predominantly of any ethnicity, where as the earliest was nearly all German, I have told <a href="../../../j/a/c/User_talk%7EJackLumber_e286.html#South_Australia" title="User talk:JackLumber">JackLumber</a> about this discussion. "neither is German spoken by a large number of speakers."

<p>"German was last seen in 1991 at 1.1%." I was not talking about when it was last seen (let alone that recently). I was not denying that the percentage is really low now, but it was higher earlier on and got lower as a result of assimilation <a href="http://www.southaustralianhistory.com.au/lutheran.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.southaustralianhistory.com.au/lutheran.htm" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>. <a href="../../../m/y/r/User%7EMyrtone86_be3b.html" title="User:Myrtone86">Myr<b>tone</b></a></p>

<dd>"It was never spoken by more than 10% of the population. It is now spoken by less than 0.9% of the population. It does not deserve primacy." I compared the census data and it appears that of all the "coutless other lanaguages" the were/are spoeken, each was/is spoken by *less* than 10% of the population, therefore (taking relative portions into account) whether it desearves primacy or not is debatable, at least as far as I'm concerned. And what does 'primacy' mean? <a href="../../../m/y/r/User%7EMyrtone86_be3b.html" title="User:Myrtone86">Myr<b>tone</b></a></dd>

<p>And PS, a comment form JackLumber: Since German is not official in South Australia, you can't emphasize the German name like that (note that in New Mexico, for example, English and Spanish are both official). But you can add a note about the German heritage in South Australia (with possibly the German translation of the name) *later on* in the article. <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackLumber_a5b8.html" title="User:JackLumber"><font face="bookman old stylr">JackLumber</font></a>. 12:35, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sorry I did not respond in time. I only briefly made one vandal block this morning, and then was away from my computer. By the time I saw the message and checked in here, Lectonar was already helping you.

<p>All the edits I've made on pages based around Adelaide have been re-edited again by you, which is fair enough because I didn't have a reference. Yesterday however I removed this post from the Adelaide Talk section under "Adelaide - City Of Corpses".....</p>
<p>"What a strange analogy, but then Adelaide is a very strange place. Of course the Snowtown murders are an embodiment of Adelaide's unique style. ( what a ludicris offensive statement ) As an interstater, the first thing I noticed was how much poverty and mental illness there was in this city. Dear old Adelaide is a place of extremes. It exhibits a seedy underbelly of extreme feralness while claiming a mantle of high culture on the other. The murders here have recurring themes that centre around pedaphiles, homosexuals and transvestites. Lord knows why the government tries to attract migrants. The truth is that unless your kids have a university degree they are likely to end up working in a factory or within the service industry. Even with a degree you may not find a decent job and will have to leave.—The preceding"</p>
<p>And now its back there again? Did you put it back? Because the reason I took it away was I didn't like the fact that this interstate persons shine such a negative light on Adelaide (which is untrue) and above all associates SA/Adelaide with transvestites &amp; pedaphiles! I'm don't care that homosexuals were mentioned thats fine but the the fact that they mention our state having a "recurring" theme around pedaphiles is very offensive. Now if you edited it back to the "way it was" then I don't know why you'd do that? But I you didn't put it back and someone else did then thats fine and sorry to get into a bit of a biff.</p>

<p>Sorry, but what have I done to upset you? The '2006's aren't linked as such - they're like that so that users see their preferred date format. I'd be intersted in what you don't like about my copy-editing - others don't agree with you - and sweeping generalisations don't help. Feel free to change (or discuss) bits you don't like, but reversion throwing the baby out with the bathwater, and that doesn't help improve an article that's clearly had a lot of time and energy devoted to it. Birdhurst 05:59, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Re dates, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style_%28dates_and_numbers%29" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style_%28dates_and_numbers%29" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style_%28dates_and_numbers%29</a> says:</p>
<p>Dates containing a month and a day If a date includes both a month and a day, then the date should normally be linked to allow readers' date preferences to work, displaying the reader's chosen format. The day and the month should be linked together, and the year should be linked separately if present. For example:</p>
<p>Month and day <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_17.html" title="February 17">February 17</a> → 17 February <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_17.html" title="February 17">17 February</a> → 17 February Day, month, and year <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_17.html" title="February 17">February 17</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/5/1958.html" title="1958">1958</a> → 17 February 1958</p>
<p>That's precisely what I did - what's the problem?</p>
<p>Re altering the meaning of the text - where did I do that?</p>
<p>Re copy-editing - many other people have also devoted a lot of time and energy to the article - that's what Wikipedia's about, isn't it?</p>
<p>Re "A quarter of a century later, the Labor government" - later than what?</p>
<p>Re "the L-shaped track" - it isn't, each track consists of two L-shaped "rails".</p>
<p>I could go on, but I'd appreciateive your constructive comments. Birdhurst 06:16, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>"those are instructions on how dates are organised (February 17 rather than 17 February) rather than explicit linking instructions" - precisely: I've never mentioned linking, and this is Wikipedia policy about displaying dates (including years), which I'm choosing to follow (as a good Wikipedian should); "'L-shaped track' is correct; there are no rails, (such a term has not been used to describe the track in any of my sources) there are two peices of L-shaped track" - that's why I put "rails" in inverted commas. The piece uses "track" to mean three separate things: the busway (equivalent to the line, in railway parlance); the structure consisting of the two L-shaped pieces (the track, in railway parlance); and (as here) just one of the L-shaped pieces (the rail, in railway parlance). I was trying to avoid confusion between the three.</dd>

<p>I'd still like to know what meaning I altered - and what had happened a quarter-century earlier. Birdhurst 06:39, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>Thank you for your reply and your most polished note. I did not find myself being rude in user Cyberjunkie's talk page - have a look at it yourself. I have not said one word related to Cyberjunkie or his contributions on the first two comments, while he promptly dismissed my suggestion as 'nonsense' in his third. I remained faithful and gave a long, detailed explanation of what I was thinking - wrong as it may be - and has not received a reply yet. Is there a different definition of being rude in Wikipedia? I'm quite new anyway.</dd>
<dd>I have noticed that you have said my silly comment does not help <i>solving the problem</i> - i.e. you understand there is a "problem". I assume you mean people changing the spelling of the word "civilisation/civilization", and I do not quite understand how my note is so unacceptable. If it will cause any systematic problems on Wikipedia, or hinder the article's readability, then yes, I'll definitely remove it when I know. But it seems that the note can only be read by editors -again, I may be wrong- and that more than half of the edits to the articles were changing the spelling of the word "civilisation/civilization". I, forgive my insolence, think that the comment is clear enough to prevent more users from making the mistake again. Even if it does not help that much, is there a need to remove it? There is a note on the top of the article "RuneScape" telling real contributors to write their edit summaries because the article receives quite a lot of vandalism. It ignores the fact that when vandals see that they'll most likely write a fake edit summary - Yet it is not removed.</dd>
<dd>Otherwise, if you have a better solution for this "problem", please gently use it.</dd>
<dd>As for the policy, perhaps I have been interpreting it wrongly, but as I have said, this isn't the case, because "Civilisations" and "Civilizations" <b>are from the same dialect of English, British English</b> (See wiktionary). In fact, Civilisations is simply a less used variant of Civilizations - i.e it is in no way a different dialect. Both the US and the UK uses the word "Civilizations" overwhelmingly more than "Civilisations". Many, many people think that "Civilizations" is the only correct spelling (as seen from their edit history: "Correct spelling", etc.) The word "Civilisations" is seldom used and it would appear to be a wrong spelling to many, many people. "I" is a variant of the word "Aye" ("Yes"), yet when do you ever see people saying "I sir"?</dd>
<dd>As I have said, the correction is not really related to the policy, but I would also like to point out that Cyberjunkie, who added the word "Civilisations", is in fact not the "first major contributor", because he added less than ten words. The word "Civilisations", as you can see from the portal's history, has been changed far more than ten times into "Civilizations" - a far greater contribution than Cyberjunkie, don't you think?</dd>

<p>Wasn't the changed sentence just fact? I mean, a gerrymander is a technical thing, and no one disputed that there was malapportionment.

<p>Hi Michael. I saw your note on Rebecca's talk page regarding collateral damage affecting yourself. Have you tried contacting your ISP regarding this issue in the hope they may be able to identify this user? He may very well be breaching your ISP's <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terms_of_service.html" title="Terms of service">terms of service</a> or <a href="../../../a/c/c/Acceptable_use_policy.html" title="Acceptable use policy">acceptable use policy</a> and could possibly be asked to move on. -- <a href="../../../l/o/n/User%7ELonghair_25a8.html" title="User:Longhair">Longhair</a> 09:00, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>ISP's keep logs, even on their proxy servers. I realise it's a long shot asking them to identify this user, however it's been done before. Matching timestamps to activity is easily done if you can enlist the help of a willing member of the ISP's staff. Sadly, the bigger the ISP, the less likely you are to find a resolution to the problem. I've watchlisted your talk page so I can assist in future events of blocks affecting you. It's a pain, we know, but we're better off keeping the blocks active. -- <a href="../../../l/o/n/User%7ELonghair_25a8.html" title="User:Longhair">Longhair</a> 09:38, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As I'm usually the person who blocks the Jackp socks, I'll try to remember to use the "block anonymous users only" option to minimise the collateral damage.</p>

<p>Thankyou for your input re <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Debnam_1a0a.html" title="Peter Debnam">Peter Debnam</a> image... are you able to tell me which is the most appropriate license to use?

<dd>Re: response on my page - I'm unsure why I don't understand what I'm supposed to do here. I asked you what license to pick from the dropdown list instead of picking the 5th one down, to which you said on my talk page to use {{Fair use in|Peter Debnam}}, which I added in to Summary along with fair use rationale:</dd>
</dl>
<p>Peter Debnam official photo. The State Parliament website licenses the photo for non-commercial use.</p>
<p>The image here is claimed to be fair use as it is:</p>
<ol>
<li>The official portrait of the current NSW opposition leader;</li>
<li>There are no copyleft alternatives of such a photo;</li>
<li>The image used is of a ceremonial and not a commerical value;</li>
<li>The article is improved by the prominence of this photo;</li>
<li>Which is hosted and displayed on the not-for-profit Wikipedia Encylopedia for educational purposes.</li>
</ol>
<p>But the same problem occurs, it tells me it is ready for speedy deletion.

<p>I'm not advocating for either the removal or inclusion of what you removed, however I will point out that the person whomever added it was simply quoting the article.

<p>Perhaps I used the wrong word. What I meant was, the wikipedian was just making a direct quote from the article, he personally didn't come up with those words.

<dd>If anything, doesn't the quote 'Eastman stated that the party had no hidden agendas, despite being labelled an arm of the Christian Right movement. "There's no formal structural approach to churches in any way,"' do good anyway? The paragraph starts off with saying that FF announced Eastman as lead candidate and spokesperson, and goes on to show Eastman clearing the "misconception" that FF has no hidden agendas...

<dd>Hey, it's not my fault that Family First have policies that discriminate against people like me. They are free to form policies as they wish, this is democracy, but in the same light I have the right to think it's a pity that people with such socially conservative views as they do have two voting positions in the LC. Again, this is democracy. I do however not let my personal dislike of FF and some of their policies get in the way of my contributions - I do not post anything opinionated on FF. My belief that the quote should have been left there was based on the fact it was a quote and didn't degrade the party IMHO, not based on any prejudice I have against them (after all, as I said, if anything I think the quote is of benefit) - but you disagree with that. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimeshift9_7a50.html" title="User:Timeshift9">Timeshift</a> 15:02, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

How are widely held criticisms within certain contexts (like lets say American conservative Christian criticisms of stem cell research), or historically important criticisms (like lets say Marx's criticisms of capitalism), not matters of "fact"? Do they not exist as criticisms? Are they not important? I fully understand not wanting criticisms that are novel or original to one or two editors to be part of an encyclopedia entry, because that would violate POV and would be unethical. But historically important and/or simply socially prevalent and influential criticisms, which clearly exist as social and/or historical facts? I'd love to hear your justification for removing criticism sections "on sight". Please elaborate.<a href="../../../p/e/l/User%7EPelleSmith_2335.html" title="User:PelleSmith">PelleSmith</a> 13:16, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
