<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/n/Benedict_Kiely_2891.html" title="Edit section: Early years">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Early years</span></h2>
<p>Benedict Kiely was born on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_15.html" title="August 15">15 August</a> <a href="../../../1/9/1/1919.html" title="1919">1919</a> in <a href="../../../d/r/o/Dromore.html" title="Dromore">Dromore</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/u/County_Tyrone_caaf.html" title="County Tyrone">County Tyrone</a> to Tom and Sara Alice Kiely, who had five other children - Rita, Gerald, Eileen, Kathleen and Macarten - with Ben coming last.</p>
<p>Thomas Joseph Kiely, who was a native of Moville, County Donegal, was a Boer War veteran. When he was only eighteen, he joined the Leinster Regiment. Over the next five or so years, he travelled over Ireland and abroad, to places like the Caribbean and, finally, to South Africa, and was later decorated for heroism, having been a soldier who fought in the Boer War (during which time he had met with <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian_De_Wet_5d97.html" title="Christian De Wet">General Christiaan De Wet</a>). Sometime after having retured to Ireland, Tom took up employment with the Ordnance Survey as a survey measurer (or "chain man" - so called because a chain was used to do the measuring).</p>
<p>Some three years later, Tom happened to be in Doyle's Hotel in <a href="../../../d/r/u/Drumquin.html" title="Drumquin">Drumquin</a>, and that was where he met a young barmaid by the name of Sara Alice Gormley, who came from the townland of Claraghmore, near Drumquin. An interesting thing about the townland Claramore was that there were so many families with the surname Gormley that each one used their own nickname to distinguish one from the other.</p>
<p>In the spring of <a href="../../../1/9/2/1920.html" title="1920">1920</a>, Tom and Sara Alice Kiely, and their six children, moved from James Campell's farm in Dromore to Omagh, where Tom took up the position as the porter in the newly-opened Munster and Leinster Bank. After living for a short time in Castle Street and Drumragh, the family finally settled in St. Patrick's Terrace in the Gallows Hill area of Omagh. This area was to have a lasting inspiration for Ben.</p>

<p>Whilst he was a teenager, Ben began to feel the urge to become a writer. He had a keen interest in the work of <a href="../../../b/e/r/Bernard_Shaw_efb4.html" title="Bernard Shaw">Bernard Shaw</a>, <a href="../../../h/g/_/HG_Wells_1d20.html" title="HG Wells">HG Wells</a> and <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johnathan_Swift_5cf1.html" title="Johnathan Swift">Johnathan Swift</a>. In 1936, after completing his education at Mount St. Columba Christian Brothers School in Omagh, Ben went to work as a sorting clerk in Omagh Post Office, where his brother-inlaw Frank McCrory was working. Frank was the husband of Ben's sister Eileen.</p>
<p>However, Ben soon realised that the post office would not provide him with the life of the scholar which he had so desired. So, in the <a href="../../../s/p/r/Spring.html" title="Spring">Spring</a> of <a href="../../../1/9/3/1937.html" title="1937">1937</a>, he left Omagh and began a new life in <a href="../../../e/m/o/Emo%2C_County_Laois_def2.html" title="Emo, County Laois">Emo Park</a>, <a href="../../../p/o/r/Portarlington.html" title="Portarlington">Portarlington</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/u/County_Laois_3233.html" title="County Laois">Co. Laois</a>, where he decided he would train as a Jesuit priest.</p>

<p>His life as a Jesuit was not meant to be for, exactly a year later, in the <a href="../../../s/p/r/Spring.html" title="Spring">Spring</a> of <a href="../../../1/9/3/1938.html" title="1938">1938</a>, Ben suffered a serious spinal liaison, which resulted in a lengthy stay in Cappagh Hospital in <a href="../../../f/i/n/Finglas.html" title="Finglas">Finglas</a>, <a href="../../../d/u/b/Dublin.html" title="Dublin">Dublin</a>. During his hospitalisation, Ben was given plenty of time to think about the course his life had already taken, and about a course it might take. He also realised that he was never a true religious follower and so abandoned his training as a Jesuit priest.</p>

<p>When he got out of hospital in <a href="../../../1/9/3/1939.html" title="1939">1939</a>, Ben returned to Omagh to recover from his back problem.

<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/4/1943.html" title="1943">1943</a>, Ben graduated from National University with B.A. history and letters.</p>

<li>A well-known brother-inlaw of Benedict Kiely who lived in the Omagh area was Frank McCrory who worked for many years as a playwright/ songwriter of <a href="../../../p/a/n/Pantomime.html" title="Pantomime">pantomimes</a> at Omagh Town Hall. Frank was the husband of Eileen Kiely, Ben's eldest sister.</li>
<li><a href="../../../d/r/u/Drumquin.html" title="Drumquin">Drumquin</a> is often mentioned in his novels and stories because that's where he has maternal family connections. His mother, Sarah Alice Kiely (neé Gormley) was from Claramore, a townland near Drumquin, so that's probably why the surname Gormley and the townland of Claramore are often referred to in some of the stories.</li>
<li>Was a distant relation (through his mother) to the Gormley family who owned Gormley's pub in Castle Street in Omagh.</li>
<li>Was a maternal uncle of the Omagh-born musician Brian Coll.</li>
