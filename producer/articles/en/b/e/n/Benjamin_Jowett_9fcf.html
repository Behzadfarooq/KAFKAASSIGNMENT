Benjamin Jowett</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Jowett was born in <a href="../../../c/a/m/Camberwell.html" title="Camberwell">Camberwell</a>. His father was from a <a href="../../../y/o/r/Yorkshire.html" title="Yorkshire">Yorkshire</a> family that, for three generations, had been supporters of the <a href="../../../e/v/a/Evangelicalism.html" title="Evangelicalism">Evangelical</a> movement in the <a href="../../../c/h/u/Church_of_England_2cc6.html" title="Church of England">Church of England</a>. His mother was a Langhorne, related to the poet <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Langhorne_%28poet%29_21d4.html" title="John Langhorne (poet)">John Langhorne</a>. At twelve, Jowett was placed on the foundation of <a href="../../../s/t/_/St_Paul%27s_School_4268.html" title="St Paul's School">St Paul's School</a> (then in St Paul's Churchyard), and at age 18 he obtained an open <a href="../../../s/c/h/Scholarship.html" title="Scholarship">scholarship</a> to <a href="../../../b/a/l/Balliol_College%2C_Oxford_8bce.html" title="Balliol College, Oxford">Balliol College, Oxford</a>, where he remained for much of his life.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/8/3/1838.html" title="1838">1838</a> Jowett gained a fellowship; he graduated with first-class honours in 1839. This was at the height of the Oxford <a href="../../../t/r/a/Tractarian.html" title="Tractarian">Tractarian</a> movement: through the friendship of <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_George_Ward_e662.html" title="William George Ward">W.G. Ward</a> was drawn for a time in the direction of <a href="../../../h/i/g/High_church.html" title="High church">High Anglicanism</a>; but a stronger and more lasting influence was that of the <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matthew_Arnold_c28a.html" title="Matthew Arnold">Arnold</a> school, represented by <a href="../../../a/r/t/Arthur_Penrhyn_Stanley_bdee.html" title="Arthur Penrhyn Stanley">A.P. Stanley</a>.</p>
<p>Jowett then concentrated on <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theology.html" title="Theology">theology</a>. He spent the summers of 1845 and 1846 in <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germany.html" title="Germany">Germany</a> with Stanley, and became an eager student of German criticism and speculation. Amongst the writings of that period he was most impressed by those of <a href="../../../f/e/r/Ferdinand_Christian_Baur_5147.html" title="Ferdinand Christian Baur">F.C. Baur</a>. But he never ceased to exercise an independent judgment, and his work on <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_of_Tarsus_aa07.html" title="Paul of Tarsus">St Paul</a>, which appeared in 1855, was the result of much original reflection and inquiry.</p>

<p>Jowett was appointed by <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lord_Palmerston_001d.html" title="Lord Palmerston">Lord Palmerston</a> to the <a href="../../../r/e/g/Regius_Professorship_of_Greek_%28Oxford%29_a9b0.html" title="Regius Professorship of Greek (Oxford)">Regius Professorship of Greek</a> in autumn 1855. He had been a tutor of Balliol and a clergyman since 1842, and had devoted himself to the work of tuition: his pupils became his friends for life. He discerned their capabilities and taught them to know themselves. This made him a reputation as "the great tutor."</p>
<p>As early as 1839, Stanley had joined with <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archibald_Campbell_Tait_5e8d.html" title="Archibald Campbell Tait">Archibald Campbell Tait</a>, the future <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archbishop_of_Canterbury_1091.html" title="Archbishop of Canterbury">Archbishop of Canterbury</a>, in advocating certain university reforms. From 1846 onwards Jowett threw himself into this movement, which in 1848 became general amongst the younger and more thoughtful fellows, until it took effect in the commission of 1850 and the act of 1854.</p>
<p>Another educational reform, the opening of the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indian_Civil_Service_fca6.html" title="Indian Civil Service">Indian Civil Service</a> to competition, took place at the same time, and Jowett was one of the commission. He had two brothers who served and died in <a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">India</a>, and he never ceased to take a deep and practical interest in Indian affairs. A great disappointment, his repulse for the mastership of Balliol, also in 1854, appears to have roused him into the completion of his book on <i>The Epistles of St Paul</i>. This work, described by one of his friends as "a miracle of boldness," is full of originality and suggestiveness, but its publication awakened against him a storm of theological opposition from the Orthodox (Evangelicals), which followed him more or less through life. Instead of yielding to this, he joined with <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_Bristow_Wilson_a102.html" title="Henry Bristow Wilson">Henry Bristow Wilson</a> and <a href="../../../r/o/w/Rowland_Williams_8f51.html" title="Rowland Williams">Rowland Williams</a>, who had been similarly attacked, in the production of the volume known as <i><a href="../../../e/s/s/Essays_and_Reviews_9af2.html" title="Essays and Reviews">Essays and Reviews</a></i>. This appeared in 1860 and gave rise to a strong outbreak of criticism. Jowett's loyalty to those who were prosecuted on this account was no less characteristic than his persistent silence while the augmentation of his salary as Greek professor was withheld. This persecution was continued until 1865, when <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_Augustus_Freeman_b9bb.html" title="Edward Augustus Freeman">E.A. Freeman</a> and <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Isaac_Elton_0538.html" title="Charles Isaac Elton">Charles Elton</a> discovered by historical research that a breach of the conditions of the professorship had occurred, and <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christ_Church%2C_Oxford_3eb9.html" title="Christ Church, Oxford">Christ Church, Oxford</a> raised the endowment from £40 a year to £500.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Jowett's influence at Oxford had steadily increased. It culminated in <a href="../../../1/8/6/1864.html" title="1864">1864</a>, when the country clergy, provoked by the final acquittal of the essayists, had voted in convocation against the endowment of the Greek chair. Jowett's pupils, who were now drawn from the university at large, supported him with the enthusiasm which young men feel for the victim of injustice. In the midst of other labours Jowett had been quietly exerting his influence so as to conciliate all shades of liberal opinion, and bring them to bear upon the abolition of the theological test, which was still required for the <a href="../../../m/a/s/Master_of_Arts_%28Oxbridge%29_79b7.html" title="Master of Arts (Oxbridge)">M.A.</a> and other degrees, and for university and college offices. He spoke at an important meeting upon this question in London on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_10.html" title="June 10">June 10</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/6/1864.html" title="1864">1864</a>, which laid the ground for the University Tests Act of 1871.</p>
<p>In connection with the Greek professorship, Jowett had undertaken a work on <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plato.html" title="Plato">Plato</a> which grew into a complete translation of the <i>Dialogues</i> with introductory essays. At this he laboured in vacation time for at least ten years. But his interest in theology had not abated, and his thoughts found an outlet in occasional preaching. The university pulpit, indeed, was closed to him, but several congregations in London delighted in his sermons, and from 1866 until the year of his death he preached annually in <a href="../../../w/e/s/Westminster_Abbey_ded8.html" title="Westminster Abbey">Westminster Abbey</a>, where Stanley had become dean in 1863. Three volumes of selected sermons have been published since his death. The years 1865–1870 were occupied with assiduous labour. Amongst his pupils at Balliol were men destined to high positions in the state, whose parents had thus shown their confidence in the supposed heretic, and gratitude on this account was added to other motives for his unsparing efforts in tuition. In 1870, by an arrangement which be attributed to his friend <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Lowe%2C_1st_Viscount_Sherbrooke_18ad.html" title="Robert Lowe, 1st Viscount Sherbrooke">Robert Lowe</a>, afterwards Lord Sherbrooke (at that time a member of <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Ewart_Gladstone_b6ab.html" title="William Ewart Gladstone">Gladstone</a>'s ministry), Scott was promoted to the deanery of <a href="../../../r/o/c/Rochester%2C_Kent_c075.html" title="Rochester, Kent">Rochester</a> and Jowett was elected to the vacant mastership by the fellows of Balliol. From the vantage-ground of this long-coveted position the Plato was published in 1871. It had a great and well-deserved success. While scholars criticized particular renderings (and there were many small errors to be removed in subsequent editions), it was generally agreed that he had succeeded in making Plato an English classic.</p>

<p>From 1866 his authority in Balliol had been paramount, and various reforms in college had been due to his initiative. The opposing minority were now powerless, and the younger fellows who had been his pupils were more inclined to follow him than others would have been. There was no obstacle to the continued exercise of his firm and reasonable will. He still knew the undergraduates individually, and watched their progress with a vigilant eye. His influence in the university was less assured. The pulpit of St Mary's was no longer closed to him, but the success of Balliol in the schools gave rise to jealousy in other colleges, and old prejudices did not suddenly give way; while a new movement in favour of "the endowment of research" ran counter to his immediate purposes.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the tutorships in other colleges, and some of the headships also, were being filled with Balliol men, and Jowett's former pupils were prominent in both houses of parliament and at the bar. He continued the practice, which he had commenced in 1848, of taking with him a small party of undergraduates in vacation time, and working with them in one of his favourite haunts, at Askrigg in Wensleydale, or Tummel Bridget or later at WestMalvern. The new hall (1876), the organ there, entirely his gift (1835) and the <a href="../../../c/r/i/Cricket.html" title="Cricket">cricket</a> ground (1889), remain as external monuments of the master's activity. Neither business nor the many claims of friendship interrupted literary work. The six or seven weeks of the long vacation, during which he had pupils with him, were mainly employed in writing. The translation of <a href="../../../a/r/i/Aristotle.html" title="Aristotle">Aristotle</a>'s <i>Politics</i>, the revision of Plato, and, above all, the translation of <a href="../../../t/h/u/Thucydides.html" title="Thucydides">Thucydides</a> many times revised, occupied several years. The edition of the <i>Republic</i>, undertaken in 1856, remained unfinished, but was continued with the help of Professor <a href="../../../l/e/w/Lewis_Campbell_8302.html" title="Lewis Campbell">Lewis Campbell</a>.</p>
<p>Other literary plans were not to take effect — an <i>Essay on the Religions of the World</i>, a <i>Commentary on the Gospels</i>, a <i>Life of Christ</i>, a volume on <i>Moral Ideas</i>. Such plans were frustrated, not only by his practical avocations, but by his determination to finish what he had begun, and the fastidious self-criticism which it took so long to satisfy. The book on <i>Morals</i> might, however, have been written but for the heavy burden of the vice-chancellorship, which he was induced to accept in 1882, by the hope, only partially fulfilled, of securing many improvements for the University. The <a href="../../../v/i/c/Vice-chancellor.html" title="Vice-chancellor">vice-chancellor</a> was <i>ex officio</i> a delegate of the <a href="../../../o/x/f/Oxford_University_Press_e785.html" title="Oxford University Press">Press</a>, where he hoped to effect much; and a plan for draining the <a href="../../../t/h/a/Thames_Valley_3611.html" title="Thames Valley">Thames Valley</a>, which he had now the power of initiating, was one on which his mind had dwelt for many years.</p>

<p>The exhausting labours of the vice-chancellorship were followed by an illness (1887); and after this he relinquished the hope of producing any great original writing. His literary industry was thenceforth confined to his commentary on the <i>Republic</i> of Plato, and some essays on Aristotle which were to have formed a companion volume to the translation of the <i>Politics</i>. The essays which should have accompanied the translation of <a href="../../../t/h/u/Thucydides.html" title="Thucydides">Thucydides</a> were never written. Jowett, who never married, died on <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_1.html" title="October 1">1 October</a> <a href="../../../1/8/9/1893.html" title="1893">1893</a>. The funeral was one of the most impressive ever seen in Oxford. The pall-bearers were seven heads of colleges and the provost of <a href="../../../e/t/o/Eton_College_8864.html" title="Eton College">Eton</a>, all old pupils.</p>
<p>Theologian, tutor, university reformer, a great master of a college, Jowett's best claim to the remembrance of succeeding generations was his greatness as a <a href="../../../m/o/r/Morality.html" title="Morality">moral</a> teacher. Many of the most prominent Englishmen of the day were his pupils and owed much of what they were to his precept and example, his penetrative sympathy, his insistent criticism, and his unwearying friendship. Seldom have ideal aims been so steadily pursued with so clear a recognition of practical limitations. Jowett's theological work was transitional, and yet has an element of permanence. As has been said of another thinker, he was "one of those deeply religious men who, when crude theological notions are being revised and called in question seek to put new life into theology by wider and more humane ideas." In earlier life he had been a zealous student of <a href="../../../i/m/m/Immanuel_Kant_5dcb.html" title="Immanuel Kant">Immanuel Kant</a> and <a href="../../../g/e/o/Georg_Wilhelm_Friedrich_Hegel_6ad4.html" title="Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel">Georg Hegel</a>, and to the end he never ceased to cultivate the philosophic spirit; but he had little confidence in metaphysical systems, and sought rather to translate philosophy into the wisdom of life. As a classical scholar, his scorn of littlenesses sometimes led him into the neglect of minutiæ, but he had the higher merit of interpreting ideas.</p>

<p>Jowett’s method on Literature has long been obsolete and rejected. <a href="../../../c/s/_/CS_Lewis_fd12.html" title="CS Lewis">CS Lewis</a>, for example, writing around the middle of the <a href="../../../2/0/t/20th_century.html" title="20th century">twentieth century</a>, says that when he studied Literature, teachers on the Jowett tradition invited readers to believe the real sense of old philosophers had been misinterpreted by their immediate contemporaries and successors, only to be rediscovered by the modernist scholar<sup id="_ref-Lewis_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Lewis" title="">[1]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Jowett is still criticised by Orthodox Christians (Evangelicals and Catholics alike) for having furnished, with his method on Literature, the basis for XIX-century <a href="../../../h/i/g/Higher_Criticism_e1bf.html" title="Higher Criticism">Higher Criticism</a>; and decry the fact that, while in Literature Jowett is obsolete, in Theology there are many who still cling to it.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly Jowett was a great scholar, but what did the undergraduates think of their master? One of them, <a href="../../../h/2E/_/H._C._Beeching_8d10.html" title="H. C. Beeching">H. C. Beeching</a>, wrote a rhyme which in various forms has become quite famous (which incidentally tells us he pronounced his name to rhyme with 'Blow-it', not the more prevalent rhyming with 'How-it'). It was published in 1881 in a broadsheet entitled <i>The Masque of B-ll--l</i> <sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[2]</a></sup>:</p>
