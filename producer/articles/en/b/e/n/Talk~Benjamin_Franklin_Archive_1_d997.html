<p>I don't think the information about fabricated anti-Semitism belongs in this article. These claims are little-known and rarely brought up, and out of place in an article about Benjamin Franklin. Perhaps a single sentence would be acceptable, but two paragraphs and five links is not. Given that very similar content was added to <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Washington_2730.html" title="George Washington">George Washington</a>, this strikes me as an attempt by someone with an axe to grind to seek out all anti-Semitic fabricated quotes on the net and then attack their purveyors in the encyclopedia in the guise of "defending" historical figures against charges of anti-Semitism. Furthermore, it's simply inaccurate to say his image has been "tarnished" by claims of anti-Semitism, as almost no one has heard of these claims. --<a href="../../../d/e/l/User%7EDelirium_b0dc.html" title="User:Delirium">Delirium</a> 03:44 16 Jul 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>The following paragraph needs, at least, serious editing of its claimed facts. If nothing is forthcoming (a citation that can be followed, citing a <i>published</i> document, would be nice), it will have to be removed.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Franklin deducted the principle of refrigeration by observing that on a very hot day, he stayed cooler in a wet shirt in a breeze than he did in a dry one. To understand this phenomenon more clearly Franklin conducted experiments. On one warm day in Cambridge England in 1758, Franklin and fellow scientist John Hadley experimented by continually wetting the ball of a mercury thermometer and allowing it to evaporate. With each subsequent evaporation, the thermometer read a colder degree of temperature. Another thermometer showed the room temperature to be constant at 65 degrees F. The thermometer used in the experiment was brought all the way down to 7 degrees F. In his letter "Cooling by Evaporation" Franklin noted that "one may see the possibility of freezing a man to death on a warm summer's day."</dd>
</dl>
<p>Never mind the necessary copy editing. Cooling from 65F to 7F by evaporation? Of water? At 10% humidity you can get your wet-bulb temperature down to 45F, according to my handy psychrometer slide rule. Only 38 degrees to go. (And: ultra-low humidityIn London? Have you ever been in London on a warm day? It's not quite so dry as the Mojave Desert.) Doesn't matter how many times you repeat the evaporation.

<p>I did some checking around on google and amazon, and I found a few citations indicating that he wetted the bulb of a mercury thermometer with ether and used a bellows to dry it, which produced a 58 degree drop in temperature.

<p>Theo, I backed out your change because:</p>
<ul>
<li>you backed out WilliamKF's change</li>
<li>you added something about astrology in a sentence which is mostly about science and technology. all I did was move it to the end of the paragraph.</li>
<li>I moved your reference to "Poor Richard Improved" to after "Poor Richard's Almanack", to which it is related.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your comment in the history makes no sence. I know Franklin wrote Poor Richard's; that's why I added to reference to it. Did you even look at my change?

<p>Astrology was practiced as a science, and a technology by Franklin. What do you call weather forecasting using astrology? This was practiced by Franklin. It was not so "minor" interest as is entered in this treatment. Let the true record reflect this fact, and not some personal POV treatment. That does not reflect the true record. As long as it is recongized that Ben Franklin, was not only interested in "astrology stuff" but practiced it as well. I read his personal &amp; professional materials in Philadelphia and his copius writings on, and his practice of, astrology, is well documented. He was more than "interested" in astrology Pfalstad. I am well-versed on Benjamin Franklin. I was born &amp; raised in Philadelphia, and lived in the same neighboor he did two hundred years before. Franklin's astrological works are copius.<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheodore7_f3d4.html" title="User:Theodore7">Theo</a> 03:35, 25 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've heard that Benjamin Franklin was quite a prolific musician, teaching himself violin, harp and guitar (as well as possibly composing a string quartet) in addition to inventing the glass harmonica. I see no mention of this though, and perhaps someone more learned than I am in this area could elaborate.</p>
<p><a name="Music_2" id="Music_2"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">Music</span></h2>
<p>Having played the harmonica, I was interested in your (and others)listing of the harmonica as among his inventions. I happened to visit the National Constitution Center today in Philadelphia and learned that the instrument Franklin invented was in fact the "armonica", sans the "h", which was a horizontal graduated row of pitched crystal discs which were spun in a lathe-like fashion and played with moistened finger tips producing tones similar to those made by running one's finger tip around the edge of one's wine glass at the dinner table. he used to sing in the choir with my great great great grandfather and he acctually passed downa story in which tehy did a solo!!</p>

<p>Franklin became a Mason at age 25 (the order's minimum age); this was in January of 1730 (old style, when the new year began in March) or 1731 by the modern calendar. The date is known, but the article suggests some uncertainty.</p>
<p>He was made Grand Master (of Pa.) in June 1734 (not 1735), as can be shown from letters in the Labaree edition of the <i>Papers</i>, vol. 1, pp. 374-77.</p>

<dd>Suggestion-- do a google search, and read the reviews (hint: not the ones on pages where the book is for sale). Granted, when I first deleted this, I thought it was pure vandalism from the title. After you restored it, I looked at what was out there about it, and decided it looked like fluff-- not worth including.

<dd>It's still in the article, and I didn't re-add it. Mwanner, I agree that it's not among Mr. Franklin's finest works, and I wouldn't have added it myself. But he did write it, and I didn't see the compelling reason to delete it once someone else took the time to add it (and to add it correctly, with ISBN). Had it been a hoax, or a satire of Franklin, I would have agreed with you. But as long as the information is valid, more is generally better for Wikipedia, in my opinion. If Mr. Franklin didn't want it in his Wikipedia article, he never should have written it in the first place! | Keithlaw 22:14, 16 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Hmmm, OK, <i>now</i> I have removed it again. I think, really, what bothers me about listing this is twofold. One, it seems to me that the purpose of the compilation is not scholarly; it was published to titillate. I don't think we need list every work ever written on an historical figure. Admittedly, though, the fact that it is material that was written <i>by</i> Franklin makes my claim weaker.</dd>
