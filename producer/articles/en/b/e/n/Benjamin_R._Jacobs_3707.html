<p>Before Jacobs was twenty-seven years old, he had established a successful scientific laboratory in <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Francisco_a4a4.html" title="San Francisco">San Francisco</a> and was conducting his own research, when on <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_18.html" title="April 18">April 18</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/0/1906.html" title="1906">1906</a>, his laboratory was destroyed during the <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Francisco_earthquake_of_1906_6b09.html" title="San Francisco earthquake of 1906">earthquake and the resulting fires</a> that created one of the nation's greatest disasters and destroyed many parts of the city. His equipment and all records of his research were lost.</p>
<p>Relocating to <a href="../../../w/a/s/Washington%2C_D.C._323f.html" title="Washington, D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a>, Benjamin R. Jacobs joined the federal agency, the Bureau of Chemistry of the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Department_of_Agriculture_db31.html" title="United States Department of Agriculture">United States Department of Agriculture</a>, with which he had a long association. Some of his work was under the auspices of in the Food Control Laboratory of the department. During this time he also participated in the Distribution Division of the United States Food Administration, which was formed to deal with daunting issues regarding food distribution during the <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_World_War_31c9.html" title="First World War">First World War</a>. He participated for a great portion of the existence of the division to the withdrawal of the principal license regulations. In <a href="../../../1/9/1/1917.html" title="1917">1917</a> a federal war time food control act was passed when crop failures in <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europe.html" title="Europe">Europe</a> laid the burden of feeding the populations of both continents, the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">British Isles</a>, and the armies of the allies—upon the United States. This effort intervened in the <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supply_and_demand.html" title="Supply and demand">supply and demand</a> process that always had functioned in the market place for food, both in the supply process and in the profits taken, to assure that both civilians and the armed forces had enough food to survive the <a href="../../../f/a/m/Famine.html" title="Famine">famine</a> that was threatening to develop, even establishing a <a href="../../../r/a/t/Rationing.html" title="Rationing">rationing</a> system and the control of prices.</p>
<p>Among the personal notes about members of what is now the American Chemical Society, in the <a href="../../../n/o/v/November.html" title="November">November</a> <a href="../../../1/9/2/1920.html" title="1920">1920</a> issue of the Journal of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry, is an announcement that Jacobs was leaving the federal government. He re-established his own laboratories, the National Cereal Products Laboratory, with facilities in Washington, D.C. and <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manhattan.html" title="Manhattan">Manhattan</a>. He remained as a consultant, however, to the Bureau of Chemistry throughout his lifetime. Jacobs also was retained throughout the rest of his life by Muller's Noodles to oversee the nutritional enrichment of their <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macaroni.html" title="Macaroni">macaroni</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/o/Noodles.html" title="Noodles">noodles</a>, and <a href="../../../p/a/s/Pasta.html" title="Pasta">pasta</a> products as they developed the nationally distributed brand that is still a recognized leader in the food industry.</p>
<p>Benjamin R. Jacobs was a member of the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Chemical_Society_80f6.html" title="American Chemical Society">American Chemical Society</a> and the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Association_for_the_Advancement_of_Science_5dd2.html" title="American Association for the Advancement of Science">American Association for the Advancement of Science</a>, who often presented reports about his research before their members in national and regional meetings and was a frequent contributor to their scientific journals, <i><a href="../../../s/c/i/Science_%28journal%29.html" title="Science (journal)">Science</a></i> and the <i><a href="../../../j/o/u/Journal_of_the_American_Chemical_Society_63cb.html" title="Journal of the American Chemical Society">Journal of the American Chemical Society</a></i>. His research also was reported in other scientific publications of the day such as the <i>American Food Journal</i> and he served as the president of the American Noodle and Macaroni Association.</p>
<p>His daughters, Irene and Millicent, were born to his first wife, who died when they were young children. After raising his daughters as a single father, he married a native of Washington, D.C., Margaret Ann Connell, who was an assistant to <a href="../../../s/a/m/Samuel_Gompers_b64b.html" title="Samuel Gompers">Samuel Gompers</a>, the founder of the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Federation_of_Labor_d658.html" title="American Federation of Labor">American Federation of Labor</a>. In order to have his new wife travel world-wide with him as he did for enjoyment as well as for his professional activities, according to her niece, Marie Connell, he wanted Margaret to resign her work. Reluctant to give up her professional career, she required that he would have to pay her salary, with annual increases, for the rest of her life—totally above any household or joint expenses! They maintained residences at the Kennedy Warren in Washington, D.C., in the historic <a href="../../../o/r/l/Orlando%2C_Florida_6d05.html" title="Orlando, Florida">College Park</a> section of <a href="../../../o/r/l/Orlando%2C_Florida_6d05.html" title="Orlando, Florida">Orlando, Florida</a>, in <a href="../../../e/s/s/Essex_Fells%2C_New_Jersey_5376.html" title="Essex Fells, New Jersey">Essex Fells</a> in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Jersey_5ac9.html" title="New Jersey">New Jersey</a>, and in <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kennebunkport%2C_Maine_b02b.html" title="Kennebunkport, Maine">Kennebunkport, Maine</a>. At the age of eighty-three, he died in Orlando, Florida and, following services in Washington, D.C., he was buried in <a href="../../../a/r/l/Arlington_National_Cemetery_35e5.html" title="Arlington National Cemetery">Arlington National Cemetery</a>. Margaret Connell Jacobs was buried with him upon her death a decade later.</p>
