<p>Benedictine High School was founded in 1927 by the Benedictine monks of Cleveland. The first location of the school was at East 51st Street and Superior Avenue in Cleveland. The original focus of the founders was to teach the sons of Slovakian immigrants. The school grew quickly and in 1929 it relocated to the site of St. Andrew Abbey at 10510 Buckeye Road. In 1940, with even further enrollment expansion, the school moved to its current location at 2900 Martin Luther King, Jr. Drive. The 1950s saw more enrollment growth for the school and increased academic recognition. In the 1960s and 1970s, as the population in Cleveland shifted and the costs of Catholic education rose, school enrollment shrunk. However, at this time the school developed a focused college preparatory program, which resulted in over 96% of students going on to college. In the 1980s, to adjust to new circumstances, the school developed an extensive bus system. The system allowed for young men from all over the Cleveland area to attend Benedictine. The 1980s also brought about a capital campaign that sparked improvements in classrooms, and the building of a new church and bell tower.</p>

</ul>
<p>Benedictine has an intense academic regimen. To receive a diploma, students must earn 24 credits in college preparatory classes. Because of these and other strict academic guidelines, over 99% of graduates are able to go on to college. The average class size is 18 students.<br /></p>
<p>Members of the Class of 2006 will attend a number of colleges and universities, including the United States Military Academy at West Point, the United States Air Force Academy at Colorado Springs, University of Notre Dame, Northwestern University, Case Western Reserve University, Marquette University, University of Dayton, Duquesne University, Catholic University of America, Ohio University, University of Cincinnati, Georgetown University, Carnegie Mellon University, Washington University in St. Louis, Boston College, Boston University, American University, and the University of Richmond.</p>
<p>Three National Merit Finalists were members of the Class of 2006, as were two Commended Students and 20 members of the National Honor Society.<br /></p>
<p>Benedictine also offers a unique Post-Secondary Education Option Program (PSEOP) through Cleveland State University in which selected Benedictine teachers may teach classes in which students earn high school and college credit simultaneously. Currently such programs exist for English and Biology.</p>

<p>Benedictine is well-known for its success in a wide array of sports, most notably baseball, basketball, football, hockey, and track &amp; field.
