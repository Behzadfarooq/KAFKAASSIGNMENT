<p>In compliance with Wikipedia policy, it is forbidden to post comments that are of a strong negative distaste and could lead to libel.

<p>I've done a fairly major cleanup on this article, mainly to eliminate soapboxing, clear up POV issues, cite and wikify references, and make it read more like an encyclopedia article rather than a LiveJournal rant written by a committee. I have also archived the talk page as most of the discussions applied to old versions of the article.</p>
<p>There's still a bit more that could be done. In particular, we could do with a "theology and ministry" section going into a bit more detail about his ministry and teachings in particular. There are also still a number of statements in the article that need citations. --<a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJammycakes_f7ef.html" title="User:Jammycakes">Jammycakes</a> 13:44, 4 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This was in the article but I can't find any reference to it on the Fort Worth Star-Telegram's website, so I've moved it here. Can anyone provide a link?</p>
<dl>
<dd>The <i><a href="../../../f/o/r/Fort_Worth_Star-Telegram_c51a.html" title="Fort Worth Star-Telegram">Fort Worth Star-Telegram</a></i> reported in August 2005 that the <a href="../../../t/a/r/Tarrant_County%2C_Texas_b36e.html" title="Tarrant County, Texas">Tarrant County Appraisal District</a> (responsible for determining the assessed value of real estate for tax purposes and for granting property tax exemptions) was reviewing whether Hinn's facility in Grapevine met the requirements for a property tax exemption. <sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup>Specifically, the review would focus on whether the "church" designation, the same one Anthony and Trinity Foundation claim is false, was used to claim an exemption to which Hinn's ministry may not have been entitled. The review was requested by Anthony and Trinity Foundation.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></dd>
</dl>
<p>Also, can anyone provide any information on the outcome of the IRS and Tarrant County investigations?

<p>There's alot of anti-Hinn stuff on this page. Hinn has preached to millions of people and many of given their lives to Christ. Just because someone goes to a prayer service and isn't immediately healed is not a sign that Hinn is at fault.

<dd>You should have seen it a couple of weeks ago. The article was packed out with negative soapboxing that didn't cite its sources. I've got rid of the worst of it, but I'd agree that more could be done. Personally I don't think the last paragraph (about the India crusade) adds anything of note to the article, and perhaps we should just remove it altogether. — <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJammycakes_f7ef.html" title="User:Jammycakes">jammycakes</a> 18:54, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

It's also not a place for rants on article pages, nor even presenting facts with a slant.

<dd>I know very little about Hinn. But having an aircraft is not a valid criticism at all. CEOs and athletes have aircraft, why shouldn't a man of God?

<dd>No. I don't deliberately expose myself to the mainstream media making judgments about God's people. They simply have no mandate to do so. The bible says in 1 Timothy 5:17 that leaders are counted worthy of double honor, after all, and that word for "honor" includes good possessions. So seeing that he's wealthy wouldn't really impact my opinion at all. Now, that doesn't mean I'm a supporter of Hinn... I have other problems with him, which don't seem to be in this article yet. I'd add them if there was a verifiable source for them. --<a href="../../../s/d/f/User%7ESdfisher_d82c.html" title="User:Sdfisher">Steven Fisher</a> 16:25, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Do you presume that Hinn is one of God's people because he uses the name of God to enrich himself? Does that make him a "leader worthy of double honor"? I'm sure you probably have a Bible verse for that one too...Well, how about Matthew 19:24, in which Christ says "Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God." I think you're confusing principles of Christianity with principles of Capitalism.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I'm a strong believer in the principles of Wikipedia, but Steven, you're in the stratosphere of POV with your postings here. Refering to Hinn as a "man of God" just because he claims to be one is akin to categorizing Hitler as a good German, just because that's what he claimed to be. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobko626_0bbb.html" title="User:Robko626">Robko626</a> 01:05, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Trying reading the verse <i>in context</i>, including verses 25 and 26. If you still don't get it, feel free to email me, because the Benny Hinn talk page isn't the place to discuss it. But unless you can back your doctrine up with bible verses that mean what you think in context, don't bother.

<p>Steven, I think your edits today are a step in the right direction. I'd just take issue with some of your citation needed tags though: I don't think they're really necessary because the information is all there in the wikilinked articles on the Trinity Foundation, The Sword of the Lord &amp; Personal Freedom Outreach. There's also a balance that we need to draw in the controversies section. If we start flooding that section with references it can end up looking like soapboxing again, which is something we need to avoid. — <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJammycakes_f7ef.html" title="User:Jammycakes">jammycakes</a> 18:07, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Do you really think so? I think the word itself is neutral enough. It's probably more the context that it's in that gives it a negative connotation.

That's because Ed Brayton is a well known commentator on these issues and Science Blogs are part of a reputable publisher, Seed Magazine. And Brayton in his article cites the other blogger, Pam Spaulding, and <a href="http://www.pamshouseblend.com/showDiary.do?diaryId=84" class="external text" title="http://www.pamshouseblend.com/showDiary.do?diaryId=84" rel="nofollow">her article</a>, making it notable for reference here by default.

<dd>If you think this is valid and should stay, you need to find a source that is acceptable and de-weasel the claim. I'm more than happy to let a non-weaselly claim with specific references to back it stand. But you're not there. "A number of bloggers" -- so the number is two? Non-notable. You could say "a number of bloggers" with a number of zero, one or three just as easily. Further, I could immediately get two bloggers to post that it's utterly reasonable, and say a number of bloggers agree with him. It is an utterly useless claim, and the citations do not back it. (For the record, I don't think a private jet is necessary. But that doesn't come into this argument; what enters into this argument is whether it's non-weasely, notable, and backed correctly.)</dd>

<dd>Even if you do address whether or not ScienceBlogs is a reputable source - and you've come <i>nowhere</i> near that - you still have a major problem in that it does <b>not</b> back the claim "a number of bloggers." You need to come up with a non-weaselly and notable claim. And I firmly believe that once you come up with a valid claim, you will find that ScienceBlogs is not a valid source for that claim.

<dd>FeloniousMonk, you yourself stated that ScienceBlogs "is widely used and regarded on the project as a acceptable, <b>if partisan</b>, source." The fact that it is a partisan source supports Steven Fisher's argument. <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> is a relevant reference.

<dd>Comments like what? Brayton is a reliable expert source. He isn't neutral, but NPOV does not require neutrality, just balance. Blogging is a medium, not a class of sources. A lot of blogs are unreliable sources because there's no way to verify the authorship, etc. ScienceBlogs is published by a reputable publisher - sure, it isn't peer-reviewed science, but it's a solid source. <a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuettarda_9de6.html" title="User:Guettarda">Guettarda</a> 18:59, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think you're still misunderstanding my objection here. Replace "bloggers" with "people", if it helps you see it. The problem is still there. The phrase is backed with citations, but it is only possible to back with those particular citations because it is weasely, and as such it does not belong in a BLP page. It either needs rephrasing (and possibly new citations, depending on the new phrasing) or it needs to be struck. BLP demands it not be there in the current form. Look at it this way: What stops someome from adding "A number of bloggers have responded saying those bloggers are idiots," and citing that with three bloggers? Or what if someone changed the phrase to "75% of bloggers agree with Hinn" and added six links that agreed with him? If they're an expert on something, whether or not it is Hinn, according to your interpretation that'd be acceptable in this article. Clearly allowing the content this kind of argument leads to madness. (And please stop asserting Brayton as an expert on Hinn, unless you can back it.) --<a href="../../../s/d/f/User%7ESdfisher_d82c.html" title="User:Sdfisher">Steven Fisher</a> 19:24, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>So are you arguing that, per BLP, material should be deleted because the wording in less than perfect? If the wording upsets you, <i>fix it</i>. That's simple enough. As for your assertion that Brayton <i>isn't</i> an expert source (as per the acceptability of bloggers of sources), you need to explain the basis for your belief - what is the basis for your belief that that ScienceBlogs isn't a reliable source? What is the basis for your assertion that Seeds magazine hires ignorant columnists? <a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuettarda_9de6.html" title="User:Guettarda">Guettarda</a> 07:45, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Per BLP, it should be removed if it isn't fixed. So fix it or remove it. As for Brayton being an expert on Benny Hinn, you haven't presented anything. And yet again, on a biography page, the onus is on the person who wants to include information to make it acceptable. The wording is not "imperfect," it is so far out that it cannot and must not continue to exist in the article space. --<a href="../../../s/d/f/User%7ESdfisher_d82c.html" title="User:Sdfisher">Steven Fisher</a> 07:23, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Here's the deal Guettarda - if we were talking about toothpaste, NPOV would be just fine, but since this is BLP -- a biography of a living person, the standard is higher, due to the potential for libel suits. Balance isn't enough. It's like if someone did a bio for George W. Bush, and it included a line that said, "Blogger John Smith from Johnstown, PA says that Bush is a jerk." It's a question of relevance.</dd>

<p>This subject is an effort to centralize debate about neutrality in this section. Here goes:</p>
<p>The section should remain as it stands as of 12/28/2006. It makes clear that there is a lot of controversy surrounding Hinn without endorsing it. The level of detail is consistent with the high degree of scrutiny that Hinn is under because of his success as a televangelist.</p>
<p>I do question the relevance of the reference to the band Our Lady of Peace -- this should be removed. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobko626_0bbb.html" title="User:Robko626">Robko626</a> 19:16, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The bloggers comment still needs to be struck. Imagine, for instance, someone attaching a "A number of bloggers think Jim Carey unfunny" to the Jim Cary article. Irrelevant, non-notable, and probably easily reworded and cited with reliable sources.

<p>I think my main concern with the section as it stands now is <a href="../../../a/w/w/WP%7EAWW_3219.html" title="WP:AWW">weasel words</a>. It says a few times "Hinn is criticized..." rather than "Joe Blogger has said that..." or whatever.

<p>Somebody removed the whole section. While some of the statements they removed were from verifiable, reliable sources, I'd agree that there was still too much soapboxing and it was still pretty untidy. I've put back the key points but I've left them in the ministry and theology section. I think whichever way it goes, we need to make sure that what we say is to the point, no longer than necessary, and backed up by reliable sources. I've also removed the Our Lady of Peace stuff because it's unencyclopedic and just clutters up the article. — <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJammycakes_f7ef.html" title="User:Jammycakes">jammycakes</a> <a href="../../../j/a/m/User_talk%7EJammycakes_7b05.html" title="User talk:Jammycakes">(t)</a> 00:34, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Can we keep an eye on the external links section please? Some of the links that have been inserted during my wikibreak are off-topic, having little to do with Benny Hinn himself. In particular, the "Benny: tongues have ceased" is <a href="../../../c/e/s/Cessationism.html" title="Cessationism">cessationist</a> POV-pushing and has little to do with Hinn other than having his picture at the top. I think that the "critical"/"supportive" titles are also a bit dubious from an NPOV perspective. I'm going to remove the off-topic ones and the titles but I think a discussion on which other ones to include/exclude would be worthwhile. — <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJammycakes_f7ef.html" title="User:Jammycakes">jammycakes</a> 22:51, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think it would be a relevant and NPOV point to put in this article.

<dd>This has nothing to do with the burden of proof. This is an encyclopedia article that must be written according to wikipedia principles, including that its contents should be verifiable and not original research. It is not part of a debate on Hinn's faith healing claims. So, I say it again: if we have an existing reliable source that argues there is no proof Hinn has healed anyone, then we can mention this claim (with citation) in the article. If not, then we cannot. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhiwum_2ad0.html" title="User:Phiwum">Phiwum</a> 14:36, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
