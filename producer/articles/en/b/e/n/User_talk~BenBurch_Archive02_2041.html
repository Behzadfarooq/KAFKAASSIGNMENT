<p>Sorry, Crockpot, not in bad faith at all! I am just keeping in the spirit of the section. If it must remain, then it ought to be as complete as possible as this in an encyclopedia. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenBurch_6e87.html" title="User:BenBurch">BenBurch</a> 05:54, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Obviously this dispute will not be settled between us. I suggest we take this to an arbitration/mediation proceeding. I believe I have sufficient evidence to prove that you are not acting in good faith, and that you have issued a serious warning on my talk page as retaliation.<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrockspot_fd90.html" title="User:Crockspot">Crockspot</a> 06:08, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Feel free to call for an RFC first, as that is the first step in this process and mediation is for disputes involving only two editors. This does not. And yes, I put a serious warning in there. I'm betting if I looked at your little nest over at CU, you folks have been coordinating strategy here simply against my edits, in total violation of policy. Or am I guessing wrong? You are acting in the very most partisan and disgusting bad faith yourself in attempting to <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">WP:OWN</a> an article about a message board you despise. And it CLEARLY is payback for the AfD of Conservative Underground. That is absolutely clear to anybody. Having said that, I am totally willing to compromise. The section stays. The DUFU link stays. But also the other EQUALLY related offshoots stay too. Or do you factually dispute any one of them? Deal with the facts here, not the personalities. I'd like to see your argument against each and every one of the links I posted. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenBurch_6e87.html" title="User:BenBurch">BenBurch</a> 06:13, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>You would be wrong on the coordination issue, and on retaliation for the CU AfD. I let the CU thing go, and I have refrained from commenting about your edits on other sites after I was warned about it, even though there was no coordination, just commenting. How exactly does the Randi Rhodes site or the Mike Malloy site relate to DU, other than crossover membership? CU has crossover membership with DU, but we also have archived DU posts that have been deleted from DU, and cannot be found elsewhere. Our DU forum is the most active forum on the site. DUFU is a site that specifically lampoons DU. If crossover membership alone is a criteria, then a link to the Automobile Association of America would also be appropriate, no? I believe you are taking a serious stretch at this. Your motivations clearly seem to be to bolster your argument for removal of the offshoots section. That would meet the definition of <a href="../../../b/a/d/Bad_faith.html" title="Bad faith">bad faith</a>. Add to that your threats on other sites to get your wiki admin friend to ban other editors. Please, take a step back and look objectively at what you are doing. You may be in danger of getting yourself banned. I honestly would not be happy to see that happen. I thing you have made some positive contributions to WP (as have I, to a lesser extent). Sometimes you can be quite reasonable, but other times, I wonder what is going on with you.<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrockspot_fd90.html" title="User:Crockspot">Crockspot</a> 06:31, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The Malloy board and the Randi Rhodes board are all basically refugees from DU much as the NU and PI boards are. DU came first and people got disgusted and stopped posting there and moved to RR and MM. They are totally appropriate. I accept that the section has to stay, if for no other reason that you intend to <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">WP:OWN</a> it. Given that, these links I have added are the ones I would expect to be there were the section complete. They are all boards where DU members in the DU Diaspora wound up. They all exist in relation to DU in an auxillary fashion, DU being still the 500# gorilla in the Liberal/Progressive world. And they all RECRUIT from DU given the opportunity. And topics banned at DU land on those boards to get thrashed out. A good example would be the Andy Stephenson affair which wound up largely on Malloy's board when DU would have none of it. Do I think this section ought to exist at all? Nope. But pragmatically, I cannot revert it forever given that you have organized to outnumber me. So I intend to make sure it at least lives up to what it ought to be. Unless you intend to extend your <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">WP:OWNership</a> to that as well. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenBurch_6e87.html" title="User:BenBurch">BenBurch</a> 06:40, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Again, I am coordinating with no one on this. I do not wish to "own" the DU article. I am simply trying to prevent the removal of the CU and DUFU links. Looking at your history, one could believe that you would like to see all conservative references wiped from WP. You were instrumental in getting the CU article deleted, and now it appears you are trying to wipe the last remaining reference to CU from WP. I believe that CU and DUFU links are appropriate, for reasons already stated. If you really feel that strongly about your justification for the links you added, let me ask you, would you have a reason to object to a link to scamdy.org?<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrockspot_fd90.html" title="User:Crockspot">Crockspot</a> 07:04, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I would prefer to be editing pages on Vietnam War history than doing the wiki two-step with you all of the time. I may or may not add it, as the site documents the entire Andy Stephenson saga, and refutes all of the allegations that CU members "killed Andy", complete with document scans, and archived posts of his own DU friends attacking him, the same friends that have accused CU members of killing him. I'm out for a day or two, so I'll think about it. If you happen to be successful at getting me banned from WP in my absence, then allow me to pre-congratulate you.<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrockspot_fd90.html" title="User:Crockspot">Crockspot</a> 07:18, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I have absolutely no desire to see you banned! (And that is a VERY rare thing in any event, even if I did.) As for CU and Andy, don't expect to hear the end of that even if I never say another word. Others with <b>far</b> more resources than I are at work on that story, and I expect that when they are done with it, CU will easily merit a Wikipedia page. In fact, I'll even create it for you at that time. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenBurch_6e87.html" title="User:BenBurch">BenBurch</a> 07:31, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>OK, now THAT was funny. I mean it, I'm laughing here. If you had objectivity on the Andy saga, you would be laughing too. I'm pretty sure, listening to Will and Beth go on, what the grounds for a lawsuit would be. Of course, Andy's own statements (not to mention Will's) would contradict those grounds. Hold your nose and go read the scamdy site, and you'll see what I mean. You may get to write that article, but when the dust settles and the facts are all known, you may wish you hadn't. BTW, isn't the threat of a lawsuit verboten on WP? (Just kidding.) Thanks for the late night chuckle.

<p>For crying out loud, Ben... you remove the entire offshoots section on the grounds that it doesn't meet <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a>, and then eleven hours later you edit the entry on <i>yourself</i> to include a link to a site which much more clearly doesn't meet the same guideline, and which you happen to have a financial interest in? I would really like to know why you believe the link to your part-owned site meets <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a>.</p>

<p>Your accusations of vandalism against other Wiki editors is uncalled for and I suspect they are being made in bad faith. Everyone who has removed your ridiculous additions to the external links on the DU page has been accused of vandalism by you. If you have a dispute with other editors who have legitimate arguments, it is very rude to mindlessly accuse them of vandalism. If you continue to make these baseless accusations, I will be compelled to ask the admins to block your editting privileges.

<p>Hey Ben, it's Che again. I've got to put it to you straight: your edits concerning the <a href="../../../d/e/m/Democratic_Underground_d747.html" title="Democratic Underground">Democratic Underground</a> article are, if not the cause of, then at least in the middle of some problems. Other editors on the page are accusing you of bad faith edits, bad faith warnings, and disruptions of WP:POINT. And I've got to admit, although I'm willing to give you the benefit of the doubt and assume you're not intentionally disrupting, a lot of the things you're doing seem to be a little misguided. Simply put, if you disagree with the quality of the links in the EL section, it doesn't really make sense to add more of the same quality. That's where the accusations of bad faith and WP:POINT are coming from. And their reverts don't really count as blatant vandalism if they believe they're doing the right thing. I really think it's time to end this fight. The other editors there seem to really believe that the edits they're making are correct. You, on the other hand, have pretty much said that you think the whole section should go. So I think it would be the right thing for you to step away from this conflict. I'm trying to convince the others not to get admins involved. If they do get involved, they may interpret a lot of what they see as bad faith, incivility, and personal attacks. In short, you're liable to get yourself blocked. Some others may as well, but that should not be any consolation. I would also like to discourage any further type of discussion with users Crockpot and Jinxmchue. That can't go any place good. Try to avoid them. Of course, I can't make you do any of this, and even if I could, I wouldn't try. I just think this is the best way to end this war: for you to step up and end it by walking away. Take my advice if you like, leave it if you don't, I'm just another guy with an internet connection. But please think about what I'm saying. - <a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7ECheNuevara_65d1.html" title="User:CheNuevara"><font color="darkblue">Che Nuevara:</font></a> <sup><a href="../../../c/h/e/User_talk%7ECheNuevara_5bc9.html" title="User talk:CheNuevara"><font color="red">Join</font></a> <a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="darkgreen">the</font></a> <a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7ECheNuevara_navbar_e72b.html" title="User:CheNuevara/navbar"><font color="orange">Revolution</font></a></sup> 23:35, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>What is amazing is the irony in the above user's username. For the "accuracy" point, I am not an "opponent of Andy". I am an opponent of people who would exploit his death to smear other people. And I have had a couple of people jerk around with the CU article, albeit minorly. As for the "fairness" aspect, if you guys write an accurate, fair, well-sourced, and non-libellous article, no one has any reason to mess with it. If you write another hit piece aimed at conservatives, then you are at least going to get some lively discussion on the talk page. Since the article was deleted for notability problems (like the CU article), I suggest that you do what I did, and write as good an article as you can, hold it in user space, and then wait for notability to come along. If things work out the way Ben intimiates that they will, I suspect that we will be moving both articles to the main namespace at the same time. - <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrockspot_fd90.html" title="User:Crockspot">Crockspot</a> 00:17, 30 October 2006 (UTC) - <b>further comment</b> And just to qualify, I can only speak for myself.

<dd>No one's smearing 'conservatives'. Andy himself spoke out, before his death, against the harrassment campaign directed against him. An organized group of people who opposed Andy still have their Website and Forum up and the documentation of their actions are still there for all the world to see. Several of the people who hounded Andy were non-conservatives, and any info about the group that harassed Andy, even on his death bed, will accurately reflect that. <a href="../../../f/a/i/User%7EFairness_And_Accuracy_For_All_6573.html" title="User:Fairness And Accuracy For All">Fairness And Accuracy For All</a> 01:15, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, it's quite amazing, Ben, that there are "assholes" that would do an end-run around the rules in order to repost an article that was deleted and remained deleted after a review. I knew at least one of you would try something like this. And lest you think I'm being biased against the inclusion of the article, I initially voted to keep the first article as long as someone worked to improve it. That didn't happen. Instead, you and you ilk resorted to the old "we're being victimized by the Vast Right-Wing Conspiracy" bit instead of doing something useful. When I saw that none of you wanted to improve the article, I endorsed the deletion and I now endorse the deletion of your sneaky attempt to put it back up. That is not the way to get things done on Wiki and trying these stunts won't win you any support here. <a href="../../../j/i/n/User%7EJinxmchue_0531.html" title="User:Jinxmchue">Jinxmchue</a> 22:01, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>What the hell is going on at the DU article? I thought we had all worked out a consensus on the external links some time back. I generally try to stay out of you and Jinx's petty fights, but if you're going to start arguing fine-toothed policy interpretations on such things as whether an article on a blog should have another blog as an external link, you may find the shoe on the other foot in other articles. <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrockspot_fd90.html" title="User:Crockspot">Crockspot</a> 19:17, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>They disrespected a new user and refused to play by the rules, so I re-opened consensus. This isn't a "fight" this is a determination of the very fluid concept of consensus based upon the very conditional original consensus. I have outlined what argument I want to see before I decide that original consensus should stay, but nobody will respect that request enough to actually make the argument. And I intend to see this thing through by the Wiki process. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenBurch_6e87.html" title="User:BenBurch">BenBurch</a> 19:47, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Never have, never will. The evidence shows that I am not guilty of it. Simply commenting on what happens here is not the same as directly or even indirectly asking people to come here <i>en masse</i> to influence the site.</p>
<p>As to my comments about you, I sometimes vent when I am frustrated and/or angry. I will fully admit that, yes, I get quite frustrated and angry when it comes to you, but I try to keep it off Wiki. I won't go into specifics as it would delve deep into personal attack territory, but I will say that your attitude, behavior, and comments often incite me. I try really, really hard to take a moment to think through my how I will respond here and try to keep it as neutral and as close to Wiki guidelines as possible. I know I haven't been perfect, but I have taken friendly correction well.</p>
<p>In any case, we both know that neither one of us is innocent of "talking smack" on other websites. So, since we're on even ground, from now on let's both agree to avoid making comments on other websites about things that happen here. No more venting. No more accusations. Nothing. I'm sure the admins will appreciate it and it will benefit both of us in regards to our activities here. <a href="../../../j/i/n/User%7EJinxmchue_0531.html" title="User:Jinxmchue">Jinxmchue</a> 05:43, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

I have removed libellous statements from tons of articles about conservative, liberal, Buddist, gay, etc. people and issues (I think I even cleaned up an article for a gay lefty rabbi somewhere in there). Yes, I do have political biases, and that is exactly why I wear them on my sleeve (my user page), so that other editors can call me on it if I am acting unobjectively. So far, the only people who <i>have</i> called me on it have been people who I suspect are allies of yours off-wiki, or at least have off-wiki axes to grind with me, and their accusations were merely meritless attacks to attempt to knock down my well-reasoned policy comments. While my entrance to WP was basically to come here and mess with you personally, I quickly discovered what a great project this is, and am really trying to be a positive and consistent asset to it. I don't really have a problem with you personally anymore. I think we've evolved to the point of Maggie Simpson and the other baby in a carriage, giving each other the evil eye from across the street. But I have to tell you this, and it isn't intended as a personal attack, but you're very inconsistent. Sometimes you are reasonable, and it is almost pleasant to trade barbs with you, and other times, you act like a spoiled brat. If you're on meds, maybe some sort of adjustment is needed. Or it could just be general <a href="../../../b/u/s/Bush_Derangement_Syndrome_225b.html" title="Bush Derangement Syndrome">BDS</a>. From what I've seen the past five days, no one on "your side" is acting like someone who just won a pretty big electoral victory. One would think that teh hand of Rove picked all the dems who won. (OK, so maybe I am messing with you a little at the end here.)&#160;:) - <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrockspot_fd90.html" title="User:Crockspot">Crockspot</a> 18:15, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hey ya Ben,</p>
<p>I'm still basking in the sweet afterglow of our overwhelming and well-deserved victory. Is it just me, or do many of the 'losers' seem much more combative yet more morose than usual since Weds? I won't let them bring me down though!</p>
<p>Hey, I started a new article on <a href="../../../m/i/k/Mike_Stark_227a.html" title="Mike Stark">Mike Stark</a>. Maybe you can work on it in your spare time. He's been cited ALL over the www, and the in news since his run-in with the 'Macaca' campaign staffer.

<p>Ben, a heads up, looks like somebody overwrote the White Rose article with info about a student group of the same name at the University of Texas, then they reverted it back. I made a suggestion on the talk page about a possible solution. <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrockspot_fd90.html" title="User:Crockspot">Crockspot</a> 21:06, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>You had said on the talk page for <a href="../../../r/s/x/RSX-11_4b3c.html" title="RSX-11">RSX-11</a> that you no longer had access to RSX-15 sources. Complete sets of source and binary DECtapes (including the XVM/DOS-based build/install programs) for XVM/RSX V1A and V1B (XVM/RSX V1B was the last version of RSX-15) can be found at <a href="http://www.bitsavers.org/bits/DEC/pdp15/dectape/XVM_RSX/" class="external text" title="http://www.bitsavers.org/bits/DEC/pdp15/dectape/XVM_RSX/" rel="nofollow">Bitsavers</a>. It will be possible to install and run them in SIMH 3.7 (the current version of SIMH is 3.6-2, and it will not run XVM/RSX because of several bugs) once it is released. There will probably also be a pre-installed disk image of it available. I already have XVM/RSX running reasonably well in a patched version of SIMH. If you want, I can send you a disk image of XVM/RSX and the necessary patches to run it. 207.153.26.200 09:22, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Well, look at that. I think it does. Perhaps I should add the "advert" tag without explaining exactly why I think that, attempting to improve the article or even making helpful suggestions. Nah.

<dd>It would only be petty if you didn't think it did. Though there are many other editors of that article who would disagree with you on that one. I think your article DOES read like an ad - I could easily see it being a press release from his agent with those exact words and minus the cites. Not a criticism of you, but a true fan wouldn't write any other sort of article. You'd have the same effect had I written the article on <a href="../../../a/n/n/Annette_Peacock_f4af.html" title="Annette Peacock">Annette Peacock</a>, for example. Don't assume that any time I touch one of your articles that I am attacking YOU. --<a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenBurch_6e87.html" title="User:BenBurch">BenBurch</a> 20:41, 2 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>No, actually, Ben, I wouldn't "have the same effect." Whatever you see in the article isn't based upon what's in the article. That much is obvious. <a href="../../../j/i/n/User%7EJinxmchue_0531.html" title="User:Jinxmchue">Jinxmchue</a> 02:08, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Ben, why are you attacking his article? It looks factual, neutral, and well sourced to me. It's a decent first article. What exactly do you think makes it read like an advert? Can you suggest some improvements? I was planning to update the the books and videos with citation templates. <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrockspot_fd90.html" title="User:Crockspot">Crockspot</a> 21:15, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Does the man have any critics? From where does his comedy derive? Most comedians emulate the style of another. And I think the article has a tone of praise that isn't neutral. That's all. What any fan would write about a subject he was thrilled with. It's a good article except for those issues. I was hoping to motivate him to remedy those issues. --<a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenBurch_6e87.html" title="User:BenBurch">BenBurch</a> 22:04, 3 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It's very possible that he doesn't have any critics. He's a Christian comedian. How much trouble can the guy stir up? If you can find something, feel free to edit it into the article. It's a wiki, after all. <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrockspot_fd90.html" title="User:Crockspot">Crockspot</a> 00:24, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>He has critics, though none I've seen worth noting (non-notable blogs and such). In any case, your concerns are of little weight as to Wikipedia. Having or not having critics and no mention of where his style derives from (if it does at all) have no effect at all on the articles for him or anyone else. For example, in a quick perusal of the articles for your beloved John Stewart and Stephen Colbert, I see no obvious mentions of criticism or where they derived their styles from. You said, "I think the article has a tone of praise that isn't neutral. That's all. What any fan would write about a subject he was thrilled with." I could easily, VERY easily say the same for, oh, say the article for Annie Sprinkle. No doubt that if I had added the advert tag to that article, you'd have responded with frothing indignation. Of course, even articles for other people - Robin Williams, for example - could be said to have "a tone of praise that isn't neutral." You also said, "I was hoping to motivate him to remedy those issues." Quite frankly, Ben, that's a load of bull. You simply marked the article with the advert tag and left it at that. You <b>outright refused</b> to discuss both why and what exactly you thought needed improvement. <a href="../../../j/i/n/User%7EJinxmchue_0531.html" title="User:Jinxmchue">Jinxmchue</a> 02:08, 4 December 2006 (UTC)
