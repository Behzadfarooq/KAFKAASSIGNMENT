<dd>Actually, as far as I'm concerned what I'd need more from this particular user is a definition. Exactly what does this user mean by 'bullying'? The use of the term seems too vague, and more of a catch-all phrase for... okay, so maybe an example <i>and</i> and a definition. Right now it just feels too vague to endorse in any way.

<dd>Thanks for the suggestion. I'll see if I can work the definition in somewhere and provide some general examples of bullying as well as some examples from Wikipedia (using "User A" and "User B"), and other outside complaints of bullying. I actually thought I was only one of a few people with this complaint, but a quick search in Google for <a href="http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&amp;q=wikipedia+bullying" class="external text" title="http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&amp;q=wikipedia+bullying" rel="nofollow">Wikipedia bullying</a> shows that not only is this complaint not new, it's getting pretty common. Considering it seems to be getting worse and worse, it seems Jimbo needs a lot more convincing before accepting this as a major problem he has to deal with. While the petition should be all he needs to take action, in my opinion--since perception is very important, he seems to be more concerned about "whining" and what he calls a "trollfest" of people complaining about abusive and bullying administrators <a href="http://mail.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikien-l/2005-July/025987.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://mail.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikien-l/2005-July/025987.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> <i>[link corrected]</i>, though, to his credit, he is aware of the problem, but is likely not aware of the pervasiveness of the problem and the damage it does to Wikipedia <a href="http://mail.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikien-l/2005-July/026067.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://mail.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikien-l/2005-July/026067.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>.

<dd>There is one type of bullying that I have seen repeatedly in my very short experience on Wikipedia. An editor, or a small group of editors attempts to put together some document that will give voice to a concerns felt by that editor or editors. Then a group of counter-editors, who oppose giving voice to the particular concerns, edits the document in a hostile fashion. Votes might be taken, rejected tags added, pages moved. The end result is that the voice becomes smothered, and the concerns treated with disrespect or contempt. --<a href="../../../b/o/s/User%7EBostonMA_1634.html" title="User:BostonMA">BostonMA</a> 02:44, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Calling comments "ad hominems" is prejudicial and amounts to an attack on people who are making comments. It is, thus, an unacceptable header for a section. <a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuettarda_9de6.html" title="User:Guettarda">Guettarda</a> 01:56, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuettarda_9de6.html" title="User:Guettarda">Guettarda</a>:Thank you for responding on talk. I disagree that calling a comment "ad hominem" is prejudicial and amounts to an attack on the person making the comment. Perhaps we have differing understandings of ad hominem. My understanding of an ad hominem is that it is a comment that relates only to the person making a statement and not to the statement itself. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a>'s statements, do not appear to be address the content of the petition, but merely the person of one of the signatories. What do you view as an ad hominem argument? --<a href="../../../b/o/s/User%7EBostonMA_1634.html" title="User:BostonMA">BostonMA</a> 02:01, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think, ad hominem or not, since Silverback is accusing 172 specifically of being bully, 172 has a right to defend himself if he thinks the accusation is frivolous. He may have done it in an ad hominem kind of way by counterattacking. The ad hominems against the <i>petition</i> would be what is explained by Kevin Baas on the main page--this is a little different because Silverback is accusing 172 and there are a couple of other things involved. I think I see what both of you are saying.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>That's why I've asked people to keep it impersonal and not use your signature to air specific grievances they have. I've told Silverback on his talk page (I didn't have the note up not to do this when he signed), but he hasn't responded yet. Plus, each time I've removed both Silverback's comment about 172 and 172's response, which would resolve 172's objection, someone has reverted it (and Guettarda, you did that this time.)</dd>

<dd>If you want to file an RFC against 172 I gave you the diff. I explained why signatories should not bring up their own disputes. If you want to just sign the petition go ahead. If 172 starts writing stuff next to your signature I'll take it out. If he makes an "outside view" about you, well, that's even better evidence he is harassing you. It's really annoying to put up with, but look at all the evidence that <i>I</i> have. I just got lucky because they were so intent on discrediting and bullying me that they didn't stop to think that doing so on an anti-bullying petition about bullying in general would reveal their intent.</dd>

<dd>First, no one has actually made this argument, even though it is the only argument, because apparently they just want the petition to "go away." They'd rather stick to mockery and ad hominems and malicious characterizations of motives. Second, if there could be secret ballots, I would do it, but you can't have a petition with secret ballots because inevitably someone will accuse you of ballot-stuffing since, at least on the Internet, the process cannot be watched. Secret ballots would deal with this concern, but they're not going to work.</dd>

<p>Note: It's important to know what bullying is when looking for examples. It is different than disagreeing. It is harrassment, and manipulation, and condescension, and things like that. Read up on it. Trolls do it too, and I want to find a few examples of trolls bullying administrators. While the biggest harm in bullying always comes from those in power, trolls can also be bullies. The problem this creates is that it gives bullying administrators something to call you. Validating the real experience of trolling bullies should go a long way to helping this petition gain the respect it deserves. --<a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenapgar_6305.html" title="User:Benapgar">Ben</a> 00:35, 21 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Jim, I am <i>very</i> sorry that my edits had the absolutely unintended effect of removing comments of yours. I wasn't aware that any such removal had happened until I saw your edit summary, checked the diffs, and saw that comments by you that I hadn't even seen when I looked at the page had disappeared. At first I thought that what had happened was a bug in the system that I've run into at least once before since the beginning of January, where the software <i>should</i> notify an editor before they save that there's an edit conflict, but instead it simply saves the new version without comment. However, looking at the edit history and the time, it looks like it was human error; I somehow failed to notice when I hit the "edit this page" button that I wasn't on the latest version of the page. My apologies; I had no intention of removing anyone's comments and wasn't aware that it had happened. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 01:53, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Antaeus, thanks...I've had things reverted both by Ben, and Jason Gastrich and I guess I got a bit jumpy (sorry about that). What puzzled me though, was that in looking at your user page you didn't sem the type of editor to do that. Oh well, water under the bridge...after all, stuff happens. &#160;:) <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJim62sch_0484.html" title="User:Jim62sch">Jim62sch</a> 02:17, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, I like to think that I'm <i>not</i> the type of editor to do that, but in this case I'd think even someone who <i>does</i> think so would have to admit that of all the comments on the page, yours would be the ones it would probably make the least sense for me to remove! =) It's just, as you point out, stuff happening, and I really can't blame you for thinking it might have been deliberate, but it wasn't. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 03:48, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
