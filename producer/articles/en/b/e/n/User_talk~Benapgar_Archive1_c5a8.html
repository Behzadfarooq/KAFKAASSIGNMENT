<p>If you perform a search on search.yahoo.com for</p>
<pre>
  sciencemag 1686 site:wikipedia.org
</pre>
<p>you will see several, but not all because the search engines are little behind, references to the poor quality recent sciencemag "essay" surveying the literature for support of the consensus view. It has already propogated widely and should be be included uncritically, yet it is nearly impossible to keep up with. This is why you encountered what was probably a visceral reaction to relatively reasonable suggestions. It is much easier to achieve a wiki consensus if controversial topics are somewhat constrained to just a few pages.--<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilverback_268b.html" title="User:Silverback">Silverback</a> 09:41, 8 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't want to proliferate pages, I would like to see the content re-structured. The only new pages would be global climate change and climate forcings (which we need anyway because it is often used in the science). I would actually like to see offshoot pages like "attributions to climate change" and "global warming controversy" or whatever those are called be absorbed into the new pages. I think with the structure I proposed this could be done succinctly. Instead of discussing climate forcings involved in detail right on the page, for example, you could have a shorter discussion and link to the climate forcings page.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Or even just cleaning up other stuff that I would probably have to ask and/or painstakingly make sure was accurate. For example on "global warming controversy" the section Supporters of the Global Warming theory and Opponents of the Global Warming theory could, and should in my opinion, link directly to "scientific opinion on climate change" as long as those opinions could be considered scientific, with all due credentials provided so people can make their own decisions as to how authoritative the source is. Global warming controversy (I think should be renamed gl cl ch c) can discuss any theories or something, but yet <i>another</i> problem is that the controversy assumes that it is only a two-sided anthropogenic vs. non-anthropogenic issue, which to me blows it out of proportion. I find the current structure does not help at all, but I am beginning to see why you are using it. Still, I do not think it is scientific, I think the structure is based more on the politics rather than the science.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>We were in the process of eliminating the controversy page, since that is also covered on the other pages. I don't think the forcings is going to be a good page. William is probably the only one that can write it, and he didn't want it. Whenever the term is used, there is usually a clarifying phrase to state which forcings they meant, because it probably needs to be qualified where-ever it is used, it is seldom used genericly, I don't think a lot is gained by having the page.--<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilverback_268b.html" title="User:Silverback">Silverback</a> 13:46, 10 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>And, regarding how my proposal does not fit into the current structure of the topic, <i>that is the entire point</i>. It is a different structure which I believe, for the most part, represents the science more neutrally and objectively, avoids ambiguity and "double-meaning" in article names like "global warming," and "climate change," and as a result would lead to less confusion about the subject, a more accurate and easy way to describe the subject, and less contention amongst skeptics who have every right to edit the pages. I further believe that the simplicity of the structure, straight-forward naming scheme, and a few notes to the reader, would offset any confusion arising from the different structure and the climate pages would be far better off than their current dismal state. For example, I see that "global warming," in the sense of the current trend, is more fitting a headline of a newspaper than a scientific journal. WMC disagrees. He's not going anywhere and will argue and insult my opinions under the table. Note that the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration agress <i>with me</i> when it comes to the definition of global warming, and not WMC. However, this means nothing to him.--<a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenapgar_6305.html" title="User:Benapgar">Ben</a> 23:01, 11 August 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Please stop going on about WMC. I am not WMC. And I hoped for something more helpful and less self-justificatory. I have reservations about splitting climate change and global warming, but people seem to want it and the topic is too important to ignore just because of some disagreements. As for whether it should be "global warming" or "climate change" as the main article - Wikipedia is addressing something closer to the audience of a newspaper than of a scientific journal, which is why we have the naming conventions we do. Also, we have a terminology section in global warming, and a glossary article. <a href="../../../r/d/2/User%7ERd232_65bc.html" title="User:Rd232">Rd232</a> 09:23, 15 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I must have misinterpreted what your were asking about. I thought you were asking for a clarification with respect to my comment on the CC Project page, the one <i>about WMC</i>. If you mean my concerns about the organization of the topic, I do not want to argue about it because I hate arguing about it. I've provided links to arguments I've made which for the most part reflect my position. Here is another you can look at: <a href="../../../g/l/o/Talk%7EGlobal_climate_change_Archive_one_3b7b.html" title="Talk:Global climate change/Archive one">Talk:Global climate change/Archive one</a>. Regarding whether "global warming" or "climate change" should be the main article? Climate change, or I would even prefer climate forcing to be the main page. The current trend must have its own page separate from the climate change page. This is scientific topic not a newspaper. Look at the page on <a href="../../../g/o/l/Gold.html" title="Gold">Gold</a> for example. The information provided is scientific. --<a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenapgar_6305.html" title="User:Benapgar">Ben</a> 01:36, 16 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As for <a href="../../../c/l/i/Climate_forcing.html" title="Climate forcing">climate forcing</a>, this was felt to unnecessarily duplicate (at least in its current form) <a href="../../../c/l/i/Climate_change.html" title="Climate change">climate change</a>. I said somewhere that it's not a question of permanent deletion - it can always be recreated if, for example, <a href="../../../c/l/i/Climate_change.html" title="Climate change">climate change</a> gets too big and needs a daughter article. I don't know why it was redirected to <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radiative_forcing.html" title="Radiative forcing">radiative forcing</a>, but I was mainly concerned with avoiding duplication, which there is far too much of in this topic, which inhibits the drive towards greater quality. The page was gone for two weeks without comment, so please justify keeping it. <a href="../../../r/d/2/User%7ERd232_65bc.html" title="User:Rd232">Rd232</a> 09:23, 15 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If you look at the history of the climate change article, it was in an extremely poor state<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Climate_change&amp;oldid=8281925" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Climate_change&amp;oldid=8281925" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> when I created the climate forcing page. Now someone has taken a lot of the information from climate forcing and put it onto the climate change page. You may have a point that it "unnecessarily duplicates the material" because someone has duplicated the information which is on climate forcing and put it on the climate change page. Maybe climate change should instead redirect to climate forcing. One thing is for sure, it should not redirect to radiative forcing, which Dr. Self-proclaimed genius did (I couldn't resist). Radiative forcing is a certain type of climate forcing. It is a sub-topic of climate forcing. The RF article does not, for instance, deal with <a href="../../../o/r/o/Orographic_lift.html" title="Orographic lift">orographic lift</a>, a climate forcing mechanism, where mountains cause rain on the windward side. Orographic lift is not a radiative forcing, nor is it a global climate forcing. It is a non-radiative regional climate forcing which is extremely common, has been studied extensively, and is simple enough that I learned about it in 8th grade--though I'm thinking the name was simpler, but it was the same thing. That's my justification. (Regarding your justification for removal, a frequent user such as yourself should surely know there are many pages which are not visited or edited frequently. Furthermore, read <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:Deletion policy</a>.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>One thing I know that many people have trouble with: climate change and global warming have nothing to do with the current trend. Taken literally, as one does in science, they are scientific and have important scientific information which goes with them. The Medieval Warm Period experienced a <a href="../../../g/l/o/Global_warming.html" title="Global warming">global warming</a>. Notice how that link is not going to work with all the information about the current trend contained in that article. People cannot go to the global warming article to learn about how Earth, or planets even, can be warmed via the greenhouse effect and other mechanisms. Instead they are presented with data and information about the current trend. This I think is a big problem.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Anyway, I don't want to explain it, I've argued it to death and I'm still arguing now even though I said I wouldn't. It is difficult to express my point, especially as I am not an expert on the subject, and it seems no matter how hard I try it doesn't matter. I take solace in that apparently the NOAA and many other institutions involved in examining the current climate change agree that the phrase "global warming" is not to be used to refer to the current warming trend, presumably because it is confusing, which is what I've been saying all along.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>This explains it the best:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>A.3 What is the difference between climate change and global warming?</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>Response: Climate change refers to general shifts in climate, including temperature, precipitation, winds, and other factors. This may vary from region to region. On the other hand, global warming (as well as global cooling) refers specifically to any change in the global average surface temperature. In other words, global warming or cooling is one type of planetary scale climate change. Global warming is often misunderstood to imply that the world will warm uniformly. In fact, an increase in average global temperature will also cause the circulation of the atmosphere to change, resulting in some areas of the world warming more, while other areas warming less than the average. Some areas can even cool.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>Explanation: The initial response of the earth's atmosphere to a ‘climate forcing' is a change in flow of sun and heat energy through the atmosphere that causes temperatures at the surface, in the atmosphere and within the oceans to change. However, these changes in temperature are more rapid over land than water, and can cause changes in many other aspects of the climate. For example, warmer temperatures would cause more evaporation, higher humidity in the atmosphere, changes in cloud cover and in rain or snowfall, more snow and ice melt, and changes in winds and ocean currents, and so forth. Many of these secondary changes also affect temperature, resulting in a complex interplay of different processes that can amplify the increase in temperature in some regions and moderate changes, or even cause cooling, in others. In other words, a climate forcing that causes global warming also causes many other aspects of the climate to change in complex ways. Therefore, the term ‘climate change' is the more accurate description of how climate system responds to a forcing. Unfortunately, although it can significantly misrepresent what really happens, the term ‘global warming' is still often used by media and others to describe climate change.</i><a href="http://www.msc.ec.gc.ca/education/scienceofclimatechange/understanding/FAQ/sections/1_e.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.msc.ec.gc.ca/education/scienceofclimatechange/understanding/FAQ/sections/1_e.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a></dd>

<p>Ben, would you please concentrate on content at this article, and not resort to personal comments on the talk page?

<dd>Ben, thanks for your note. I'm sorry you're feeling frustrated. I've only looked at one of your diffs. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Intelligent_design&amp;diff=26236722&amp;oldid=26235407" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Intelligent_design&amp;diff=26236722&amp;oldid=26235407" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> The problem with it is that the first sentence doesn't make a lot of sense to me, but it seems as though you're trying to define intelligent design right off the bat, in a personal way that not everyone would agree with. So that's not appropriate for the intro (or indeed for anywhere else). I'm about to go offline, but I'll take a closer look tomorrow, because maybe there's a compromise that can be reached. In the meantime, you might want to consider apologizing to the editors on the page about the personal remarks: explain you were feeling frustrated and tell them it won't happen again. You'll find they're a forgiving bunch, and if there's a good working relationshp between you all, then it'll be easier to find a compromise. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 07:38, 1 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi Ben, I'm not sure what I can do to help out here. Several editors on the talk page appear to have identified you as disruptive, which is why people are responding poorly to your suggestions. Again, looking at your edit to the disambiguation tag: "This article is about the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American.html" title="American">American</a> <a href="../../../i/d/i/Idiom.html" title="Idiom">idiom</a> "Intelligent Design" which concerns only anti-<a href="../../../e/v/o/Evolution.html" title="Evolution">evolutionist</a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theist.html" title="Theist">Theists</a> and <a href="../../../t/e/l/Teleological_argument.html" title="Teleological argument">teleological arguments</a> for their beliefs.

For the book, see <i><a href="../../../i/n/t/Intelligent_Design_%28book%29_1aae.html" title="Intelligent Design (book)">Intelligent Design (book)</a></i>.

</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Here's my opinion. I see this as a very POV edit, and I'd have reverted it too. First, it's not clear that the phrase is an idiom, but even if it is, a disambiguation tag is not the place to state it as a fact, when it's something you'd need to argue for, and find a source who had made that argument. Also, it's not clear in what sense it would be a peculiarly American idiom. The next part "which concerns only anti-evolutionist theists ..." doesn't make a lot of grammatical sense. It is an idiom about theists who oppose theories of evolution, or that is used by them, or what? And grammar apart, it's a POV argument, which you'd need to make in the body of the text, with a source. The idiom "concerns" teleological arguments for the beliefs of these theists: justifies the beliefs, explains them, is about, or what?</dd>

<dd>Today, I see you're arguing for a complete restructuring of the article, which isn't going to be accepted from you. My advice to you, if you want to edit this article, is to apologize for the personal comments and to wait a few days to read the archives, and get to the know the other editors a little. If they continue to see you as disruptive, there's a chance they'll request admin action against you. Also, please read our editorial policies about the need to use good sources and not come up with your own arguments.

(I first heard it during a lecture in or around 1986, but that wasn't in print.) If you want to make claims like this, you should cite a good source after the sentence, either by linking to it if it's online, using a footnote, or adding a Harvard reference (e.g. Smith 2005), then adding a full citation in the references section. But to insert an unsourced claim in the intro that directly contradicts something elsewhere in the article is unhelpful, to say the least. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 21:11, 5 November 2005 (UTC)</strike></dd>

<dd>Do you not realise that everything you've done has either been disruptive or malicious? You have been continually threatening Wikilegal action instead of seeking consensus, which is <i>incredibly</i> counterproductive. And now you seem to be revelling in being blocked, presumably because you might be able to use it as amunition against <a href="../../../f/e/l/User%7EFeloniousMonk_89ab.html" title="User:FeloniousMonk">FeloniousMonk</a>. I have every reason to suspect you have a personal history with either the article on Intelligent Design, or with FeloniousMonk.</dd>
<dd>While I do not necessarily agree with the block, I certainly feel you brought this on yourself, and indeed were trying to provoke the other editors. -- <a href="../../../e/c/5/User%7EEc5618_0777.html" title="User:Ec5618">Ec5618</a> 21:21, 5 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Ben, heed my words please. If you doubt my street 'cred, check my edits for my bona fides (I am no cabal member). If you want to make headway; mock up a version of the pgraphs you want to re-write on a scratch page and then when you like it, post it to talk page and get ready to defend it rationally and civilly, with citations. If you don't or if you call names, you are going to meet disaster. Getting edits into an article as a minority voice, requires forbearance. If you insult, rush in many edits or fight too much, you'll get pigpiled <a href="http://odps.org/glossword/index.php?a=term&amp;d=4&amp;t=8817" class="external autonumber" title="http://odps.org/glossword/index.php?a=term&amp;d=4&amp;t=8817" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>.</p>
<p>It's better to be a living dog than a dead lion.</p>
<p>And don't fight with SlimVirgin - she's very rational and can be helpful.</p>

<p>Thanks for your comment. It's too late to sort this out. We'll see what happens. Sometimes that dog gets a little sick of being kicked around.</p>
<p>And I found out SlimVirgin is friends with the guy I am having the dispute with anyway, or at least she just happens to have his talk pages on her watchlist (see above) and also somehow magically got informed of the dispute in the first place, since there's no record of either of them talking to each other about it. She doesn't talk to him about what he is doing on his talk page even when I ask if she could talk to him about my problems. Doesn't tell him to calm down or respect what I have to say. --<a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenapgar_6305.html" title="User:Benapgar">Ben</a> 11:15, 6 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi - I'm sorry I haven't met you before but I ran into your response on Zeq's page and wished to clarify a couple of things:
<ul>
<li>You cited <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Israeli_West_Bank_barrier&amp;diff=25278732&amp;oldid=25222179" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Israeli_West_Bank_barrier&amp;diff=25278732&amp;oldid=25222179" rel="nofollow">this</a> link as evidence of my POV and criticized my use of the word "although". I looked at that link, and it is very evident to me that it is Zeq's version that contains the word "although" and not mine. Look at the two editor names at the top of each column. It was Zeq who reverted to that version, I had <i>removed</i> the "although" statement myself. The although statement originated before I ever came to Wikipedia. I tried to change it, Zeq reverted back to it (unintentionally maybe, but he persisted to revert that way regardless of what I wrote).</li>
<li>As far as being civil, I urge you read the discussion page of the barrier article because you may have missed out on the colorful discussion that took place.</li>

<p>Anytime someone asks for help with dispute and fails to actually mention the article in dispute will draw some suspicion. You also failedto log in, (assuming youre also Benapgar -this is crossposted See <a href="../../../s/i/g/WP%7ESIG_e615.html" title="WP:SIG">WP:SIG</a> for why to login.), etc, and write in generalities about policy rather than the issues present in the debate. You also have a talk page (assuming youre Ben) thats loaded with comments about your behaviour. I dont care about the talk comments at this point, but all of this adds up to "low interest" - the debate itself is not a problem for me. Please correct the above and I can help you out. As a general rule, and this is really just a basic aspect of <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a> (read it, learn it, love it) is that you dont make separate articles based on a separate POV. While a scientist may claim that for example <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intelligent_design.html" title="Intelligent design">ID</a> is a POV fork of the whole concept of science, we can at least treat the subject objectively. In that context, all articles must be written objectively (yes this is a contstant battle) and all sides must be represented in balance, in terms which the reader can understand. In the ID context, just for example, its perfectly fair to report the characterizations that ID makes of mainstream science, as well as the vice versae, as long as its framed as opinion. The framework allows for us to deal with POV in an NPOV way.

<dd>To answer your general question, it was not rendered a guideline just because someone changed it. It should actually be policy, but its rather poorly written at this point, and at best it can qualify as a guideline. This is really a no-brainer, and something that Jimbo has said from the beginning: we dont fork articles by POV. Email the wikien-l mailing list, and youll get this same answer. In fact this was a very important early debate in the formation of Wikipedias core ethos and policy, of which <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a> is supreme, and <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a> is second. If you want to write POV - oriented articles you can user Fred's <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikinfo.html" title="Wikinfo">wikinfo</a>, which he created as a fork of wikipedia -- expressly for the purpose of writing POV -oriented fork articles.

Please let go of whatever this issue is. I've seen this happen many times before on Wikipedia. Users, often new ones, get obsessed with a dispute and continue it for months on different user-talk and article-talk pages, invariably ending up with RfCs and in front of the arbcom, but not before wasting a lot of people's time and energy, including their own. <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia is not a battleground</a>.
