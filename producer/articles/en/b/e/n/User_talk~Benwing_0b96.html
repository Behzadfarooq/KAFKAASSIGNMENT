	    <p>Hi Benwing,</p>
<p>thanks for getting involved in editing Germanic philology. Your material is good, and I'm glad to have it, but it would be good if you would check what has been done already before starting something new. For example, after a long debate we had agreed to use the word "umlaut" for i-mutation and merely note in passing that some linguists also use it for other kinds of vowel harmony. Your material on <a href="../../../a/-/m/A-mutation.html" title="A-mutation">a-mutation</a> is fine, but it belongs in an article under that title - which is where I have moved it. The point is, there are lots of kinds of vowel harmony, and lots of words that can be used for them. So the more precise usage which makes distinctions is preferable to one which says "umlaut" and other related terms are all vague words for any kind of vowel harmony. Very few linguists talk about "a-umlaut", the word umlaut was invented to describe vowel FRONTING, and there seems nothing to be gained about broadening the word to mean anything we like. Of course, variant use needs to be noted, which is why the umlaut article already contained a reference to "a-umlaut" as another possible terminology. But let's leave it at that. Besides, a-mutation can be more fully discussed in an article of it's own. Perhaps you can work that up in detail.</p>
<p>In a similar vein, your new article on <a href="../../../i/-/m/I-mutation.html" title="I-mutation">i-mutation</a> looks great, but it is unclear how it relates to the existing article on <a href="../../../u/m/l/Umlaut.html" title="Umlaut">umlaut</a>. Again, it looks a bit like you set to work without finding out what had already been done. We do need to think about related articles work together. --<a href="../../../d/o/r/User%7EDoric_Loon_2383.html" title="User:Doric Loon">Doric Loon</a> 20:35, 29 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>I'd like to thank you for your improvements of the <a href="../../../o/l/d/Old_English_language_2d72.html" title="Old English language">Old English language</a> article. An anonymous user (203.164.184.111) deleted all of your additional information on the pronunciations of &lt;c&gt; and &lt;g&gt;, and when I asked him why, his reply was that "I deleted that information because it was confusing and I did not agree with what it said." I have no idea what he's talking about, but I did ask for clarification on his talk page, despite the fact that he's an anonymous user.</p>
<p>Take care. --Whimemsz 21:27, Apr 30, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hey, thanks for your good work on linguistics articles! I didn't realize you were studying linguistics at UT! I was a linguistics major there when I was an undergrad, 1986-90.

<dd>Austin is a good place. It's getting a little too hot here but that's to be expected&#160;:) But I like cities and there's lots of activity here. What did you study for your Ph.D.? <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenwing_4140.html" title="User:Benwing">Benwing</a> 06:18, 24 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My Ph.D. is in linguistics, but it's from Cornell, not U.T. By the way, if you want to change the title of a page (like changing <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglo-Frisian_nasal_spirant_law_c8ab.html" title="Anglo-Frisian nasal spirant law">Anglo-Frisian nasal spirant law</a> to <a href="../../../i/n/g/Ingvaeonic_nasal_spirant_law.html" title="Ingvaeonic nasal spirant law">Ingvaeonic nasal spirant law</a>) the best way to do it is to click on the "move" tab. Cutting and pasting isn't so good because it doesn't preserve the history. --<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a>/<a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr"><sub><span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">tɔk tə mi</span></sub></a> 05:21, 27 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>re: <a href="../../../s/t/a/Wikipedia%7EStandardize_article_title_spellings_c8f5.html" title="Wikipedia:Standardize article title spellings">Wikipedia:Standardize article title spellings</a>: As the vote at <a href="../../../s/t/a/Wikipedia%7EStandardize_spellings_62c3.html" title="Wikipedia:Standardize spellings">Wikipedia:Standardize spellings</a> clearly shows, there is pretty strong sentiment against any form of standardization of spelling on the Wikipedia, especially if it involves using the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_English_16a3.html" title="American English">American English</a> version of English spelling. Once your proposal is publicized, I have no doubt that it will not get anything close to a <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EConsensus_ada0.html" title="Wikipedia:Consensus">consensus</a> vote, although it might not go down in flames in the same way that the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Wikipedia%7EStandardize_spellings_62c3.html" title="Wikipedia:Standardize spellings">Wikipedia:Standardize spellings</a> proposal did. My personal opinion is that it would be much better to turn your proposal into a project for identifying missing <a href="../../../r/e/d/Wikipedia%7ERedirects_2592.html" title="Wikipedia:Redirects">redirects</a> and <a href="../../../d/u/p/Wikipedia%7EDuplicate_articles_da79.html" title="Wikipedia:Duplicate articles">duplicate articles</a>, rather than rehash the issue.

<p>Yes, I can see now that the tone of that proposal turned out the knee-jerk "I wil deefend my rite to spel inkoncistently too the deth" lobby, so I´ve removed any reference to adopting any particular spelling, since that is not the main point of my proposal. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenwing_4140.html" title="User:Benwing">Benwing</a> 04:04, 26 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Benwig, I've just answered your notes on my talk page and on <a href="../../../w/e/s/Talk%7EWest_Germanic_strong_verb_c6dc.html" title="Talk:West Germanic strong verb">Talk:West Germanic strong verb</a>. Now I see you have also moved <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglo-Frisian_nasal_spirant_law_c8ab.html" title="Anglo-Frisian nasal spirant law">Anglo-Frisian nasal spirant law</a>. This is beginning to look like a re-naming frenzy, and while I don't object to these per se, I would suggest you slow down a bit. As far as the Nasal-spirant law is concerned, I have the strong impression that the term Ingvaeonic is badly out of fashion; we don't have a Wiki article on Ingvaeonic languages, for example, and every other possible variant of Germanic languages is in there. Can you point me to a RECENT authoritative source (last 30 years) which calls the law this? If so, fine. But if you DO make such a change, be sure to give credit to the previous terminology as an alternative (i.e. you should add "also called Anglo-Frisian..." to the opening sentence).--<a href="../../../d/o/r/User%7EDoric_Loon_2383.html" title="User:Doric Loon">Doric Loon</a> 07:52, 27 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>One other thing: if you are going to change the title of an article, it is your job to fix all the links (including interwikis to other language articles). All the links to <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglo-Frisian_nasal_spirant_law_c8ab.html" title="Anglo-Frisian nasal spirant law">Anglo-Frisian nasal spirant law</a> are still in place, so that's a job half-done. But most important: if you are going to move an article, you have to declare a reason on the talk page, and it is etiquette to do so first and wait for discussion before you make the move. --<a href="../../../d/o/r/User%7EDoric_Loon_2383.html" title="User:Doric Loon">Doric Loon</a> 18:47, 27 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>"renaming frenzy" is probably a bit out of hand, since we're talking about only two or three articles. i'll add comments on the appropriate page; but does wikipedia policy really require that i change all links going in? can you point me to where it says this? <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenwing_4140.html" title="User:Benwing">Benwing</a> 21:00, 27 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Sure, "frenzy" was meant jokingly. It just had the feel of an awful lot at once: it was actually four articles you wanted to relocate all at once, which is quite a disruption in a relatively small field. The main thing is, when you want to make a significant change to an article that other people are working on, seek consensus first. As far as changing links are concerned, yes, I think that is the policy; at any rate I've seen enough people being flamed for not doing it. Obviously, it has to be done, and if you take it on yourself to move the page, who else is going to tidy up afterwards? --<a href="../../../d/o/r/User%7EDoric_Loon_2383.html" title="User:Doric Loon">Doric Loon</a> 10:05, 28 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>But having said all that, I don't want to dampen your enthusiasm. You did seek consensus on <a href="../../../w/a/n/Wandel.html" title="Wandel">Wandel</a>, for example, and I agree with you, and as no-one else has worked on this so far, that means you have a green light there. Same goes (with reservations) for <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Germanic_strong_verb_561d.html" title="West Germanic strong verb">West Germanic strong verb</a> - but don't underestimate how much work you will have to do if you start on that one!

<p>I can write about Gothic and Norse, if you need. i also have various of the classic books on old english with me, which have historical info on where the various conjugations (probably) came from. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenwing_4140.html" title="User:Benwing">Benwing</a> 01:28, 29 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Please explain these to me: in your <a href="../../../p/r/o/Proto-Greek_language_a911.html" title="Proto-Greek language">Proto-Greek language</a> edits, why did you include sound changes in "most or all later dialects"? Surely changes that involve <i>most but not all</i> later dialects do not belong in a Proto-Greek article, do they? For example, you state: "loss of /n/ before /s/, with compensatory lengthening of the preceding vowel". This is not true in <a href="../../../a/e/o/Aeolic.html" title="Aeolic">Aeolic</a>: παντ-ς &gt; παν-ς (every) &gt; Attic πας (long α), Aeolic παις (diphthong). You have also done some edits in <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greek_language.html" title="Greek language">Greek language</a> which, while not wrong per se, are less than 100% right: for example you have stated that the Dative is lost. This is true in Demotic, but not in Standard Modern Greek (a subtle but important distinction). Your participation in the respective talk pages will be most welcome. There is an ongoing project to rewrite and integrate all Greek-language related articles, and I'm sure your contributions will be most appreciated.

<p>I'll contribute to the talk pages as soon as I have time, probably tomorrow; right now I'm right at my bed time. I was under the impression that Katharevousa added some complex noun forms and such, but didn't realize it still had the dative. Presumably "Standard Modern Greek" is some artificial language that tries to keep some of the older forms of Greek? How often is it used? I thought the government decision from the 1970's or so was to use dhimotiki, and that katharevousa is pretty much dead now.</p>
<p>So maybe we should just have this whole article on dhimotiki greek, with a separate section describing katharevousa and "standard modern greek" and other such forms rather than interleaving this data. but i don't know for sure; i'm sure you are more familiar with the greek language situation. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenwing_4140.html" title="User:Benwing">Benwing</a> 07:57, 29 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

I hope I didn't wake you up!&#160;:-) It's a little bit complicated really: what students are now being taught in compulsory schooling (ages 6-15) is modified (or standardized) Demotic (with some atrocious "standardizations" IMO!). Students do not <i>have</i> to learn anything else. In the Lyceum however, where most students actually go to so that they qualify for college, they are taught some Ancient Greek (or more, if they intend to sit for certain University admission exams), and the assumption is that a student who has graduated from the Lyceum (age 18) is free and sufficiently knowledgeable to incorporate elements of Katharevousa in their speech if they so wish. It's not an artificial construct, rather it is a flexible attempt to familiarize students with the whole spectrum of Greek language and literature, and let the language evolve according to its users' actual choices, and without artificial barriers. The attempt is far from perfect, but IMO it's altogether in the right direction. Indeed it is quite obvious that once Katharevousa was "abolished", the linguistic trend has been <i>towards</i> it rather than away from it. Feel free to participate in the talk pages whenever and to whatever extent you feel like. There is no rush and deadlines: we intend to be reforming the relevant articles gradually, and I'm sure your contributions will be valuable and most welcome. Oftentimes non-native speakers can offer better perspectives than native ones, as they may see the forest instead of the trees. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChronographos_daa5.html" title="User:Chronographos">Chronographos</a> 08:51, 29 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, i've reverted the changes you make to the abovementioned template because</p>
<dl>
<dd>1. You failed to consult anyone regarding the change. Please note that changes made to template have wide impacts. Consultation is almost always necessary.</dd>
<dd>2. i presume you failed even to test out the template after you changed it. As a result, it is not displaying as you'd like it to be.</dd>
<dd>3. Even if it works as you want it to, i'm personally against making the year of publication a link. It serves no purpose and overloads the page with links. Linking the ISBN would suffice.</dd>
</dl>
<p>If you believe your changes are necessary, however, please discuss it at the template discussion page or some other appropriate venues (such as the <a href="../../../v/p/_/WP%7EVP_dc2f.html" title="WP:VP">Village Pump</a>).

<p>OK, no problem. I certainly thought I tested the changes. I'd definitely never on purpose not do so. What may have happened is that I tested on the new things i created, Chapter Reference and such, and they have identical coding for the 'year' section, and so maybe I just assumed that it would work the same for the basic Book Reference. I looked at the old stuff I did and I still can't see what didn't go right and what I should have done -- can you explain it?</p>
<p>BTW I realize that you were within your rights to get angry, but you didn't, so major kudos to you. I greatly appreciate this. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenwing_4140.html" title="User:Benwing">Benwing</a> 08:13, 31 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'm still confused about your point in #2 about it not working right. In fact, I just did a little test; I took the version that you rejected and put it back as the Book Reference template, and the year link works exactly like I wanted it to work -- the year was highlighted and clicking the link brings you to a page about the year. So what's the deal with point 2? If there's something else I messed up on, I'd really like to know, because my familiarity with these Templates is not great. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenwing_4140.html" title="User:Benwing">Benwing</a> 09:11, 31 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Instead of appearing as a link to the year, say <a href="../../../2/0/0/2001.html" title="2001">2001</a>, it would appear as a link to <a href="../../../y/e/a/Year.html" title="Year">Year</a>. Funny though, when i just tested it worked as you'd have it to. Anyway personally i'm still against linking to the year of publication (or to the author and publisher, if you haven't conceived that idea yet). It might make everything look messy. If you do believe in it, do discuss beforehand. You can also test templates using the template sandboxes <a href="../../../x/1/_/Template%7EX1_6cb5.html" title="Template:X1">X1</a>, <a href="../../../x/2/_/Template%7EX2_2fe8.html" title="Template:X2">X2</a> or <a href="../../../x/3/_/Template%7EX3_4d42.html" title="Template:X3">X3</a> to save you the trouble of reverting your changes.&#160;:) --<a href="../../../p/l/a/User%7EPlastictv_c41c.html" title="User:Plastictv">Plastictv</a> 14:40, 31 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, while I didn't (and don't) oppose your addition of the "Confusing terminology: perfective vs. perfect" section to <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grammatical_aspect.html" title="Grammatical aspect">Grammatical aspect</a>, I don't much like how you've gone everywhere and added text about it to various other articles and linked back to <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grammatical_aspect.html#Confusing_terminology:_perfective_vs._perfect" title="Grammatical aspect">Grammatical aspect#Confusing terminology: perfective vs. perfect</a>. For example, I really dislike paragraph you added about it to <a href="../../../p/e/r/Perfect_aspect.html" title="Perfect aspect">Perfect aspect</a>:</p>
<dl>
<dd>The aspectual nature of the English simple past is often called the <a href="../../../a/o/r/Aorist_aspect.html" title="Aorist aspect">aorist aspect</a> or the <a href="../../../p/e/r/Perfective_aspect.html" title="Perfective aspect">perfective aspect</a>. Note that, in this usage, "perfective aspect" is <b>completely different</b> from <a href="../../../p/e/r/Perfect_aspect.html" title="Perfect aspect">perfect aspect</a>; unfortunately, there are usages where the two are the same. In general, there is a great deal of confusion over the term "perfective aspect"; see <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grammatical_aspect.html#Confusing_terminology:_perfective_vs._perfect" title="Grammatical aspect">Grammatical aspect#Confusing terminology: perfective vs. perfect</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<p>There are a few reasons I dislike it:</p>
<ul>
<li>It's not relevant. The article is about the perfect aspect, and doesn't once mention the perfective aspect; why does it need to discuss the confusion surrounding the term "perfective aspect"?</li>
<li>It's confusing. This is partly because of its irrelevance: the reader asks himself "How does this fit in?" and does not find an apparent answer.</li>
<li>It seems non-NPOV. Why is it unfortunate that "perfective" is sometimes used as a synonym for "perfect"? Maybe the unfortunate thing is that some people try to draw a distinction between the two synonyms. (I'm actually inclined to agree with your presentation, but it violates Wikipedia style.)</li>
<li>It seems strained. Why is "completely different" in bold text? You sound like you're trying to <i>convince</i> the reader as much as <i>inform</i> him; and besides, bold text has a special meaning in Wikipedia, in that it's used to mark an article's names when they first appear in the text.</li>
<li>This is a minor thing, but "perfect aspect" shouldn't be linked in that paragraph, because it makes it bold rather than a link (since it's the current article), which looks confusing.</li>
</ul>
<p>I plan to modify the text at <a href="../../../p/e/r/Perfect_aspect.html" title="Perfect aspect">perfect aspect</a>, but I've noticed that you've added similar text elsewhere, and would ask that you modify it yourself. One suggestion: perhaps rather than regarding the complication as being the confusion between "perfect" and "perfective," you should regard the complication as being the multiple meanings of "perfective"? I think that that could be explained much more easily.</p>

<p>Hi Benwing. Seeing as you are a linguistics scholar, and a significant contributor to matters Greek, I was hoping that you could help me out. My user name, Xiphon, is very close to an Ancient Greek word, as I understand it. But how does one pronounce it? Bearing in mind that I am unskilled in the phonetic alphabet that is. Would it be akin to the "z" in english, followed by the pronoun "I"? As in zIfon?

<p>Hi Benwing, you're a bit of an expert on Old English, aren't you? Any chance you could look at the article <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germanic_weak_verb.html" title="Germanic weak verb">Germanic weak verb</a> and do some work on the section "historical conjugations"? I would think Old English can stand here as exemplary for all the early Germanic languages, so we wouldn't need a full description of Old High German and all the others, but at least one medieval language does need to be described properly. --<a href="../../../d/o/r/User%7EDoric_Loon_2383.html" title="User:Doric Loon">Doric Loon</a> 21:25, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Are you sure regarding their phonology? Consonant-wise, perhaps to a degree (wrt to lateral fricatives, yes, at least), but I've generally seen very divergent phonologies from MSA as compared to the rest of Semitic. Note that South Semitic (both Ge'ez and the various dialects of Old SA) preserved lateral fricatives, too, yet were generally more conservative on vowels (and to a degree consonants, though interdentals &amp; ghayin were lost in Ge'ez). — <a href="../../../y/o/m/User%7EYom_9375.html" title="User:Yom"><font color="green">ዮም</font></a> | <b><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Yom_45a6.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Yom"><font color="#FFD700">(Yom)</font></a></b> | <a href="../../../y/o/m/User_talk%7EYom_16ed.html" title="User talk:Yom"><font color="red">Talk</font></a> • <small><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Yom_414b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Yom">contribs</a> • <a href="../../../e/t/h/WP%7EETH_da5e.html" title="WP:ETH">Ethiopia</a></small> 07:32, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>that was fast! no, i suspect you are right. it's been awhile since i looked at any references on MSA and i don't have any handy. i remembered a quote about this ("The World's Major Languages", p. 665), but i just looked it up and it refers to Epigraphic South Arabian, not the modern dialects. however, i've certainly read in various places that the modern South Arabian dialects are *overall* considered more conservative than the old ones. i suggest you rewrite this and add some more info, since it sounds like you have more experience here than i do.</p>

<p>I've noticed your concern in the talkpage for this article; somehow, the user Timeshifter has been able to keep his, possibly, biased or flawed information; one user has even been blocked, while trying to correct his edits. Perhaps it's none of my business, but if biased, POV info is on the article, it should be promptly removed.

<dd>Yes, I agree. he shows a strong tendency towards edit warring and "wikilawyering" (using the established rules to intimidate others into accepting his POV). he seems not to understand or be willing to accept the NPOV rules or established principles concerning encyclopedic style. unfortunately he also has more willingness to invest energy in POV'ing than i do in correcting his POV. i'm going to see if i can find another editor who is more willing to fight him. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenwing_4140.html" title="User:Benwing">Benwing</a> 00:05, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, these surveys are quoted very often in the media. the media focuses quite intensively (maybe even obsessively) on the number of us casualties, and the estimates of iraqi casualties often go alongside. usually either these surveys or the reports of the <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iraq_Body_Count_da9a.html" title="Iraq Body Count">Iraq Body Count</a> group, or both, are given. the difficulty here is that these two sources differ by more than a factor of ten in their claims. that said, i do think the entries are far too long; but i found it impossible to shorten them. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenwing_4140.html" title="User:Benwing">Benwing</a> 03:28, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I dunno. I'm using MS IE 6 as well and it looks OK to me. what do you see instead? do you see square boxes? does it occur *everywhere* on the page or only in the places that i added something? i did add some fonts at one point, which made some unusual characters (e.g. Ethiopic) display better, but it should work without these.

<p>Hi Benwing, I note your discussion above with BishopTutu. I have tried editing these pages and have run afoul of Timeshifter before. He does pretty much what you describe, selectively conscripting (and imv distorting) wiki guidelines to intimidate me and muddy the waters for anyone else readign the talk pages. In the past I have not had an account, and my IP changes from time to time by itself. He's now begun using this to describe me as a "vandal" for not going along with his control and censorship of these pages, using the IP as his excuse. So I've created an account here so he can't do that. It's a shame that editors should be pressured into these things because of fraudulent accusations of "vandalism" but that's another story.</p>
<p>The latest 'edit war' initiated by Timeshifter began here: (cur) (last) 23:13, 16 January 2007 74.73.39.219 (Talk) (lancet letters about graph)</p>
<p>That was me adding new information from letters published in the Lancet journal which indicate that the main graph that has been sitting atop the Lancet page for many months is inaccurate and misleading. I've added this information, along with links to the articles in the Lancet. Timeshifter then suddenly deletes the whole graph (which has been there for months), along with my new sourced information about its errors. I put it back. He deletes. Etc. Etc. His reasoning has shifted several times. First he says he deleted it because the graph is now known to be erroneous, and because the Lancet authors have conceded these errors it has to be removed. But it's only know because of MY edit! How will anyone know of these errors if he keeps censoring it? But that's the point isn't it? He doesn't want people to know. Next he claimed he had to remove it because it violated <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, on the grounds that the Lancet website requires an account to access the articles. That was bogus. Then he just keeps shifting the excuses and keeps deleting it.</p>
<p>Now he's accusing me of "vandalism" and threatening to have me blocked for 3RR violations, for the crime of putting back sourced material he keeps censoring. From the comments above I can see that you seem to know exactly what's going on here with this Timeshifter, so I'm wondering if you can step in here.Seigfried4220 14:33, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello, Benwing. Recently <a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyborgTosser_1c56.html" title="User:CyborgTosser">CyborgTosser</a> and I discussed and came up with proposed style guidelines for all the individual consonant and vowel pages wherein the <i>Occurrence</i> section would have a table rather than a bulleted list. You can see the discussion <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Phonetics_3dae.html" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Phonetics">here</a>. So far nobody else has commented on the proposed guidelines and I believe it's safer to get a solid consensus before undergoing the work to change so many pages. If you could comment on what has been proposed, even if it's a simple yay or nay, this would help us out quite a bit.

<p>I'm not chasing you outside of that talk or anything, but I really felt insulted by your coments (three times now) there. Look, let's start on the right foot, if possible: You ask many questions, I'll try to respond to the basic: Time (as you know better) is not always proportional to <a href="../../../a/b/s/Abstand.html" title="Abstand">abstand</a>. Greek, Koine Greek, Ancient Greek (and most probably XMK too), are mutually intelligible to the extent that Britannica says: no other language has been documented to have such continuity, and that Pericles' Greek to mine, are "recognizably one and the same". Now, according to the three theories for XMK, it was rather close to Greek. Furthermore, it was later absorbed within the language I now speak (the one the Bible was written in for the first time).</p>
<p>Now there are numerous examples I can give you, where Macedonian (S) irredentists/pseudoscientists etc claim that their language descends from XMK (also cited by Danforth in the article), which is absolutely <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malakies.html" title="Malakies">malakies</a> per all linguists. Feel free to give a browse to <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macedonia_%28terminology%29.html" title="Macedonia (terminology)">Macedonia (terminology)</a>, which includes the same 2 sentences with the same sources, and has become <a href="../../../f/a/_/WP%7EFA_2cf5.html" title="WP:FA">WP:FA</a>. I'm the main contributor there, but <i>that</i> part, wasn't written by me, or by any other Greek; plus it passed a storm of hundreds of objections in the <a href="../../../f/a/c/WP%7EFAC_4b7f.html" title="WP:FAC">WP:FAC</a> (<a href="../../../f/e/a/Wikipedia%7EFeatured_article_candidates_Macedonia_%28terminology%29_134b.html" title="Wikipedia:Featured article candidates/Macedonia (terminology)">here</a>. So, this all, is scrutinized to the last detail, and if not relevant for the "dispute" article, then I really don't know where it would be more relevant.

<p>Seigfried4220 (74.73.39.219) just deleted some of it with this edit summary: "deleted opinionated assertion about what the differences reflect".

<p>The sentence he deleted was this one: "The differences reflect differing methodologies as well as differing definitions of the types of death counted."</p>
<p>I like that sentence which is why I left it in when you first put it in. It is a good, simple, NPOV, and necessary introduction to complex casualty stats. I have deleted other info of yours, so I am not kissing your butt.

<dl>
<dd>I deleted this sentence because it is an opinion that that is all the differences reflect. They could reflect quite a few other things, and could even have very little to do with differing methodologies or different definitions or types of deaths. For example, if you look at the criticisms section of the Lancet study page, many believe most of the difference between the Lancet study and all others is that the Lancet study is wrong. I think opinions about what the differences reflect should be left up to readers. If you want a statement saying these studies use differing methodologies and include different types of deaths, that would be fine. But implying that this explains the *difference* in the figures is an opinion.Seigfried4220 06:08, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>So we get to the root of the problem. Seigfried4220 wrote: "many believe most of the difference between the Lancet study and all others is that the Lancet study is wrong." And? So what does that have to do with Benwing's sentence? It is a big stretch to read as much as you read into Benwing's sentence. You screwed up, because you thought I wrote the sentence. LOL. Then you write: "If you want a statement saying these studies use differing methodologies and include different types of deaths, that would be fine." That is exactly what Benwing's sentence said. --<a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimeshifter_97a3.html" title="User:Timeshifter">Timeshifter</a> 06:18, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My reasoning above stands regardless of who wrote the sentence. There is debate about what the difference reflects.

<p>Hey guys. Seigfried, i see your point. my intention was that "differing methodologies" could include the possibility that the way the lancet authors collected their data was flawed. but i see now that this isn't quite the right word here; maybe "different methods of collecting the data" or something more general would be better. i think it might be useful to mention that the methodologies are different -- the fact that one is based on counting and the other on extrapolation could be useful for someone to form their opinion about the validity of one or the other study. but i'm not attached to this particular sentence. Timeshifter, if you want the sentence in then maybe you should reword it so it addresses Seigfried's concerns. (however, looking at the current template i see that it's already stated that the methodologies and types of deaths counted are different.) <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenwing_4140.html" title="User:Benwing">Benwing</a> 23:56, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>"highly disputed" could be added. It is a common phrase on wikipedia pages. The sentence being discussed is not essential since some of the differing methodologies and types of deaths counted are mentioned in the template already. --<a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimeshifter_97a3.html" title="User:Timeshifter">Timeshifter</a> 01:07, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
