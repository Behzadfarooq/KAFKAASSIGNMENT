<p>I have added the table for Bangla script just now (although due my stupidity, it got registered as anon edit)! I am not sure of the IPA symbols. So if anyone with knowledge of IPA could please go through it, it would be excellent. Also, could someone make sure that all the letters in Assamese script are on the table and the numbers are transliterated properly?

<div style="border:thin solid black; padding:10px; background-color:lightblue">
<p>Hi Paranoid One</p>
<p>I noticed you changed the vowel placement on the Bengali script page. For me, the vowel placement was working before, and now there is the little Unicode dotted circle carrying each vowel diacritic instead of the kô itself. For me, at least, the vowels no longer work. I don't know if that has to do with the fact that I use Mozilla Firefox. Does it look better now on IE/whatever browser you are using?</p>
<p>If it's just my browser, I'm of course fine with the change! I just want to make sure it's not also more confusing on other browsers.</p>

<dd>Eek! Unicode and browser compatibility whackiness. Oh dear.</dd>
<dd>I've looked into it and the results are both interesting, puzzling and ever so slightly frustrating. I'll move this, and my findings, to the Bengali script talk page. Perhaps a wider audience can give some insight. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheParanoidOne_a135.html" title="User:TheParanoidOne">TheParanoidOne</a> 20:59, 18 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>My primary browser is <a href="../../../o/p/e/Opera_%28browser%29.html" title="Opera (browser)">Opera</a> and the vowel symbols were appearing on the wrong side of the consonant so I thought I would change it. But then differring browser rendering reared its ugly head. I have made screen shots of the table column in question from Opera 8, Mozilla Firefox 1 and MS IE 6 (all under Windows).</p>

<p>On my system it seems that IE is being the rogue. The Firefox result is interesting as it doesn't correlate with what SameerKhan has said.</p>
<p>The ultimate purpose of this long winded passage is to find out what other people are seeing in order to keep the most "correct" version. Which version is correct for you - pre or post? What browser/OS are you using? Do you have any ideas on what can be done to ensure universal correctness (heh!) in the future?</p>

<dd>The thing about unicoded Bangla text occurs because of the browser's different rendering of Bangla/eastern/complex text. IE is correct in rendering the text before your changes. Firefox won't render Bangla script correctly in WindowsXP (Which I assume you are using), unless Service Pack 2 is installed, and ControlPanel-&gt;Regional and Language settings-&gt;Languages-&gt;Support for Eastern/complex script is checked. I guess the same would happen with Opera. Unicode is phonetic, so Ki would be "ka" followed by "Hrossho e". This will show up fine in IE. If you have the support installed, it will show up fine in Opera/Firefox too. For more info on how to enable Bangla rendering support, see <a href="http://www.ekushey.org" class="external text" title="http://www.ekushey.org" rel="nofollow">this link</a>. Anyway, the bottom line is the post-vowel version is the correct unicode version, and would show up well in all browsers in properly configured systems. Hope this helps. Thanks. --<a href="../../../r/a/g/User%7ERagib_55a5.html" title="User:Ragib">Ragib</a> 06:07, 19 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p><br /></p>
<p>Agreed with Ragib. I forgot to mention that I had already reset my Windows configurations to read "Eastern/complex scripts". Before doing that, Mozilla would read the characters the way you (TheParanoidOne) display them on your screenshot. You have to go through and fix that on your system to be able to read the vowels correctly. As they stand now, for people who have Eastern/complex scripts turned on, Internet Explorer and Mozilla Firefox both have Unicode dotted circles before the consonants.

<p>OK, the ending of uņo is definitely not uņô. The ņ versus n-g is actually an interesting problem. Once again it goes back to "East Bengal" versus "West Bengal". For example, even in Bangladesh, let's say someone from Jhenaidah (or any other place from <a href="../../../k/h/u/Khulna_Division_592a.html" title="Khulna Division">Khulna</a> or <a href="../../../r/a/j/Rajshahi_Division_f1b8.html" title="Rajshahi Division">Rajshahi Division</a>) would say Baņali. However, someone from <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barisal.html" title="Barisal">Borishal</a> would say Ban-gali. I am guessing this has some linguistic implication. Well, whether we like it or not Bangla from the West is considered "standard" and hence, I changed the ng to ņ. However, ng should be left separate because there are cases where n-g is needed like say in Bôngo.</p>
<p>Also I can't think of any place where শ is pronounced as s and not as sh. So I changed that too. -- <a href="../../../u/r/n/User%7EUrnonav_4b88.html" title="User:Urnonav">Urnonav</a> 23:30, 10 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>I didn't change the "ņ" to "ng" to mean "ņg". I agree - I don't think anyone says "uņgo" (which I would have transcribed "unggo"). I changed it to "ng" because we've been writing "ng" in transcriptions like "bangla". I haven't seen anyone write "Baņla" yet. I guess I meant the "ng" to mean "ņ" in the same way that I changed the "ş" to "sh" - not a change in pronunciation but a change in simplicity/accessibility.</dd>
</dl>
<p>About শ being pronounced like "s", this is very common in clusters like "bisri", "srabon", "asrôe", "sromik", "sreshtho", etc. I agree that it never gets pronounced "s" when on its own, but its use as "s" in consonant clusters is common enough that it is transcribed as "s"/"sh" on omniglot.com, which is pretty well respected for transcription of orthographies. I am going to change it back to "s/sh" because of this. I will leave the "ņ" alone.</p>

<dl>
<dd>OK, I see both your points. I was acting like an idiot in the second case.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>However, the first case reminds me of something else. ņ was initially used in the precursor of the scheme now on this page for a very simple reason: so that pronunciations like Baņali do not end up being Bang-gali to non-native speakers even when written as Bangali. It also bears similarity to the IPA symbol for this particular nasal(?) sound.</p>
<p>History aside, we need to use a symbol to express points where two different consonant sounds meet. I am not sure what this is technically called. You'd know better! Examples like "bông-go", "brid-dho", "bôd-dho". The "-" might work, but I'm sure we can think of something slightly less unsightly.</p>

<dd>i don't agree on the need for a hyphen or other marking to designate where one sound ends and another begins, however. for the vast majority of cases, this would not make anything clearer. for example, in "briddho", there would be no confusion of whether the sounds break up as "bri-ddho", "bridd-ho", "briddh-o", or "brid-dho", as one would simply know if they understand the phonology of bangla. those who would not care to understand the phonology of bangla would probably not be bothered by the meaning of a hyphen anyhow, i would suspect. the only places where distinctions could theoretically happen (other than your "ņ" vs "ņg" cases) would be between morphemes (the meaningful parts of words) - like "din-guli" (which is neither "ņ" nor "ņg" but actually "ng"). still, i don't think this would show up in our articles enough to make any sort of convention on it. plus, it would be aesthetically unpleasant to break up all consonant-consonant boundaries.</dd>

<dl>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>still, i agree with you that we should keep the ņ~ņg distinction preserved.</dd>

<hr />
<p>Okay, first off, I use Mac OSX.4.2 with <a href="../../../s/a/f/Safari_web_browser.html" title="Safari web browser">Safari web browser</a> and Akaash unicode font. I'm having trouble with the Bengali ki (कि), ko, ke, kai, kou, ôntoshtho ô, and shunno's. Usually Mac is really good, I could normally type other Indian scripts straight into the text box, but I'm gonna have to write out the unicode here.</p>
<p>I've been impressed that this is perhaps the most cordial talk page I've ever been to (and noticed how much more you accomplish that way!), so please don't get cross at my ignorance. All I know is that there are standard transliteration conventions. I prefer the <a href="../../../i/a/s/IAST_856a.html" title="IAST">IAST</a>, because whether it be Hindi, Punjabi, Gujarati, Urdu, Tamil, whatever, it operates the same. Now I'm not real familiar with Bengali, but I was watching Ghaire Baire and the sounds weren't <i>that</i> different. I'm suspecting this was very formal old style 'Tagore' Bengali because I was recognizing quite a few words! Anyway, to my point (finally!):</p>
<p>Bengali, as I've seen before, has its own conventions, so take these with a grain of salt and opt for the traditional way - I'm not an Hindi imperialist! I can see how 'ô' might represent the sound better than the traditional inherent 'a', thus 'ā' really isn't necessary, so damn convention there. But might tradition be followed for ই and ঊ though (ī, ū)? I'm not talking about pronunciation but just the mechanics of transliteration here. I don't know, would probably just confuse people.</p>
<p>The following are my humble suggestions, the ones which aren't standardized I've noted:</p>
<ul>
<li>ঙ - ṅ</li>
<li>চ - c</li>
<li>ছ - ch</li>
<li>ঞ - ñ</li>
<li>ট - ṭ</li>
<li>ঠ - ṭh</li>
<li>ড - ḍ</li>
<li>ঢ - ḍh</li>
<li>ণ - ṇ</li>
<li>য -&#160;? have no idea what to do here! ÿ, ǰ?</li>
<li>শ - ś</li>
<li>ষ - ṣ</li>
<li>ড় - ṛ</li>
<li>ঢ় - ṛh</li>
<li>ক্ - ' (?, better than dash perhaps?)</li>
<li>কত্ - ṯ (???! have no idea what this is, reminds me of ة though)</li>
<li>কং - ṃ (or ṅ, but than what is ঙ?, ń? Maybe ņ is fine or ŋ).</li>
<li>কঃ - ḥ</li>
<li>কঁ - ṁ (I like using <sup>n</sup> though)</li>
<li>কৃ - kŗ (since unicode doesn't support the ring)</li>
</ul>
<p>In Hindi Bengali would be बंगला (or बंगाली) which would be baṅgla, since the ŋ sound doesn't occur on its own, but only when followed by 'g'. But since ং does (?!) and transliteration should represent one character for one character: ŋ is recognizable, but ņ works too! Or 'ng'. I like the ņ~ņg distinction best, if I understand correctly and the situation <i>is</i> similar to other Indian languages. I'm just way, way out of my element here and don't know anything about West/East differences, or Bengali orthography. I also guess I'm spoiled that Hindi has one sound for one character. I would have no idea what to do with the s/sh situation, except explain rules (if there are any). Like the Hindi <i>śrī</i> sounds more like a sibilant sʼ sometimes, which I think just happens naturally, like how in English most 'th' sounds are ð (<i>thee</i>), but when they're followed by 'r' they turn to þ (<i>three</i>). This may be of absolutely no relevance to anyone though, just stream of consciousness writing. I also came into the problem with when to use dashes in my still incomplete <a href="http://wikitravel.org/en/Hindi-Urdu_phrasebook" class="extiw" title="wikitravel:Hindi-Urdu_phrasebook">wikitravel:Hindi-Urdu phrasebook</a>. I opted out. Just too many problems, and it complicates things more than my brain can handle. Sorry if I've sounded like a long-winded and condescending jackass! Too little sleep + too much coffee is oft a precarious situation. <a href="../../../k/h/i/User%7EKhirad_33fd.html" title="User:Khirad">Khirad</a><small><sup><a href="../../../k/h/i/User_talk%7EKhirad_db89.html" title="User talk:Khirad">talk</a></sup></small> 23:29, 2 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>First of all, thanks so much for taking the time to read through this article and putting so much work into these suggestions!</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I feel that a lot of your transliteration ideas are great for a one-to-one spelling correspondence between Bangla and English, but believe that for the purposes of just spelling out Bangla words in a way that is accurate, easy to understand, and not redundant, there is no need to make as many distinctions as you have proposed. An analogous situation would be if a Wikipedia article written in Bangla about the English language were to make use of a transliteration scheme that preserved silent "k" in "know" or a distinction between the "ee" in "meet" and the "ea" in "meat". These distinctions are only relevant for spelling the language in its native script, not for a transliteration of the language. Thus, differentiating a dental "n", a cerebral "n", and a palatal "n" would ignore the fact that these three letters represent what is now phonologically one sound in Bangla, even if there are slightly different pronunciations given the phonological environment of the letters. Also, differentiating different letters for "sh"/"s" would be trying to reinject the pronunciations of Classical Sanskrit instead of the reality now, where Bengali speakers continue to ask "is it talobbo shô, donto shô, or murdhonno shô?"</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>More on the "sh"/"s" - it's not as simple as a phonological alternation between the two sounds. There are no regular rules. There are simply two phonemes, "s" and "sh", which happen to use three letters in an irregular way. There are minimal pairs like 'aste' "slowly/softly", and 'ashte' "to come" - some dialects have more minimal pairs than others. Phonological rules would not determine which sound would occur where, although there are a few small regularities - e.g. "sh" is not found in clusters, only "s"... "s" cannot occur intervocalically in Standard Bangla, only "sh"... etc.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Between borgio jô (borgijjô) and ôntostho jô (ontoste jô), there is no pronunciation difference. The words 'jan' "dear" (written with borgio jô) and 'jan' "you go (formal)" (written with ôntostho jô) are pronounced identically. The difference in spelling is extremely archaic and no distinction is preserved. This is similar to the situation in English where the "g" in "gel" and the "j" in "jelly" are pronounced identically and the distinction is only maintained in English spelling, not in a transcription or transliteration of the language.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The khônđo tô, where you said "have no idea what this is", is simply the form of the letter tô when a hôshonto would normally be added to it. This is a peculiarity of the Bangla alphabet, and is mostly stylistic in nature. Many words can be written either with tô or khônđo tô depending on the writer's choice or the font used.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I do agree that it would be nice to have a standard underdot for the retroflex sounds ţ, ţh, đ, đh, ŗ, and ŗh (I don't think we need one for ņ, as this letter has lost its distinctive quality). This is something that I think we should adopt, if it proves convenient for the regular contributors to this article.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Overall, I see where your concerns are. However, I feel we should stick to the idea of maintaining a one-to-one sound correspondence, and not a one-to-one letter correspondence between Bangla and English for the purposes of this article. I of course love the peculiarities of Bangla spelling, but I feel it is unnecessarily confusing and misleading to artifically inject some of the archaic spelling rules of Bangla into a modern Latin-based transliteration of the language.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I hope this has been helpful! It is also pretty late for me (about 3am) so I may also sound either harsh or convoluted. Don't misunderstand! I love the criticism.

<dd>I'd oppose the merger. I think the Assamese script can redirect to Bangla script. Or even better, we can have a parent article with links to both pages. The reason is that Bangla is more widely used (20 times more), and Bangla script has a only slight difference (some letters) with Assamese script. Bangla script, language etc are more commonly used terms, unlike the Bangla-Assamese script.

<dd>I'd support the merger. I do not think the number argument is relevant when it comes to something like a script. The two scripts are nearly identical and they share a common history.

<dd>I don't believe that this makes sense. There is only <i>one</i> script here. It's called Bengali. It's used for several languages.

<dd>In this instance, I was using "alphabet" in a different sense. Yes, structurally, there are alphabets, abugidas, and abjads. Here, however, I was using "alphabet" in the sense of "ordered subset of a script used to write a particular language". The Bengali alphabet and the Assamese alphabet are mostly the same, but Assamese uses two additional letters. Honestly, I think the right thing to do is to merge the Assamese script material to this page, and then to rewrite the page so that it first deals with the script as an entity, and then in two subsections describes how the script is used for the Bengali language and the Assamese language. Otherwise, material in the Bengali script should be moved <i>out of this article</i> to a new Bengali alphabet article, and the Assamese script article needs to be renamed Assamese alphabet.

<p>Let us work as per Ragib's plan. For the common name, I donot have any objection/preference for either name. --<a href="../../../b/i/k/User%7EBikram98_5d48.html" title="User:Bikram98">Bikram98</a> 11:18, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>If you say <a href="../../../b/e/n/Bengali_script.html" title="Bengali script">Bengali script</a> is used to write <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assamese_language.html" title="Assamese language">Assamese</a>, <a href="../../../m/e/i/Meitei_language.html" title="Meitei language">Meitei</a> etc, you need to include ৰ, ৱ etc to this article. Otherwise, let us remove these langauges from the Infobox. -<a href="../../../b/i/k/User%7EBikram98_5d48.html" title="User:Bikram98">Bikram98</a> 06:57, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No one is actually saying that. There is <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assamese_script.html" title="Assamese script">Assamese script</a>. --<a href="../../../r/a/g/User%7ERagib_55a5.html" title="User:Ragib">Ragib</a> 06:58, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>this article needs serious cleanup, it appears to be using some sort of home-grown transliteration scheme at present. Either use the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Library_at_Kolkata_romanization_e865.html" title="National Library at Kolkata romanization">National Library at Kolkata romanization</a>, or some specified official Bengali-specific scheme, but not something we made up ourselves. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(𒁳)</a></small> 10:09, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>The article seems to be giving the names of the consonants ā (aa) sounds rather than a (o) sounds. Surely this is just wrong?? It's certainly not what I was taught by my native Bangla-speaking wife... --<a href="../../../o/o/l/User%7EOolong_6cd0.html" title="User:Oolong">Oolong</a> 19:13, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You're right, someone very recently changed the names of the letters on the article. I've reverted them back to our normal <a href="../../../r/o/m/Romanization_of_Bengali_1036.html" title="Romanization of Bengali">Romanization</a>. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESameerKhan_2c38.html" title="User:SameerKhan">SameerKhan</a> 21:14, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
