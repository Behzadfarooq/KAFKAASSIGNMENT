	    <p><b>General Benjamin Adesanya Maja Adekunle</b>, Nigerian Army, (Rtd.) (born <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_26.html" title="June 26">June 26</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/3/1936.html" title="1936">1936</a>), was a <a href="../../../n/i/g/Nigeria.html" title="Nigeria">Nigerian</a> military leader.</p>
<p>Adekunle was born in <a href="../../../k/a/d/Kaduna.html" title="Kaduna">Kaduna</a>. His father was a native of <a href="../../../o/g/b/Ogbomosho.html" title="Ogbomosho">Ogbomosho</a>, while his mother was a member of the Bachama <a href="../../../t/r/i/Tribe.html" title="Tribe">tribe</a>. He underwent secondary education at the government college, <a href="../../../o/k/e/Okene.html" title="Okene">Okene</a> (in present day <a href="../../../k/o/g/Kogi_State_1d68.html" title="Kogi State">Kogi State</a>). He enlisted in the Nigerian army in <a href="../../../1/9/5/1958.html" title="1958">1958</a> shortly after completing his school certificate examinations. He passed the army selection <a href="../../../e/x/a/Examinations.html" title="Examinations">examinations</a> and was accepted at the prestigious <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Military_Academy_Sandhurst_dc3d.html" title="Royal Military Academy Sandhurst">Sandhurst</a> military academy, where he and his course mates were imbued with a thorough academic grounding in the art of <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warfare.html" title="Warfare">warfare</a>. He was commissioned <a href="../../../2/n/d/2nd_Lieutenant_2453.html" title="2nd Lieutenant">2nd Lieutenant</a> on December 15, <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960.html" title="1960">1960</a>. As a <a href="../../../p/l/a/Platoon.html" title="Platoon">platoon</a> commander, he served in the <a href="../../../k/a/s/Kasai.html" title="Kasai">Kasai</a> province of <a href="../../../c/o/n/Congo.html" title="Congo">Congo</a> with the 1QONR (1st Battalion) during his first tour of duty with UN <a href="../../../p/e/a/Peace_keeping.html" title="Peace keeping">peace keeping</a> operations in that country (ONUC). In <a href="../../../1/9/6/1962.html" title="1962">1962</a>, Lt. Adekunle became <a href="../../../a/i/d/Aide-de-Camp_17d8.html" title="Aide-de-Camp">Aide-de-Camp</a> to the <a href="../../../g/o/v/Governor.html" title="Governor">governor</a> of the eastern region, Sir <a href="../../../a/k/a/Akanu_Ibiam_50ca.html" title="Akanu Ibiam">Akanu Ibiam</a>. The following year, as a <a href="../../../c/a/p/Captain.html" title="Captain">Captain</a>, he was posted back to the Congo as Staff Captain (A) to the Nigerian Brigade HQ at <a href="../../../l/u/l/Luluabourg.html" title="Luluabourg">Luluabourg</a> - under <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brigadier.html" title="Brigadier">Brigadier</a> B. Ogundipe. In <a href="../../../1/9/6/1964.html" title="1964">1964</a>, Major Adekunle attended the Defence Services Staff College at Wellington, in <a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">India</a>. When he returned he was briefly appointed <a href="../../../a/d/j/Adjutant_General_17d9.html" title="Adjutant General">Adjutant General</a> at the Army Headquarters in May <a href="../../../1/9/6/1965.html" title="1965">1965</a> to replace Lt. Col. <a href="../../../y/a/k/Yakubu_Gowon_66d6.html" title="Yakubu Gowon">Yakubu Gowon</a>, who was proceeding on a course outside the country. However, he later ceded the position to <a href="../../../l/t/2E/Lt._Col._f620.html" title="Lt. Col.">Lt. Col.</a> James Pam and was posted back to his old Battalion (1st Bn) in Enugu as a Company <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commander.html" title="Commander">Commander</a>.</p>
<p>He later assumed command of the <a href="../../../l/a/g/Lagos.html" title="Lagos">Lagos</a> Garrison as a substantive Lt. Col. When the <a href="../../../b/i/a/Biafra.html" title="Biafra">Biafra</a> civil war erupted in July <a href="../../../1/9/6/1967.html" title="1967">1967</a>, Adekunle was tasked to lead elements which included two new battalions (7th and 8th) - to conduct the historic sea borne assault on <a href="../../../b/o/n/Bonny.html" title="Bonny">Bonny</a> (under Major Isaac Boro). He was promoted <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colonel.html" title="Colonel">Colonel</a> after the Bonny landing. The 6th (under Major Jalo) and 8th (under Major Ochefu) battalions of the Lagos <a href="../../../g/a/r/Garrison.html" title="Garrison">Garrison</a> subsequently took part in operations to liberate the Midwest following the Biafran invasion of August <a href="../../../1/9/6/1967.html" title="1967">1967</a>. The 7th (under Major Abubakar) stayed behind to hold Bonny. Because Major Jalo's outfit was seconded to Lt. Col. <a href="../../../m/u/r/Murtala_Mohammed_1c66.html" title="Murtala Mohammed">Murtala Mohammed</a>'s 2nd Division, Adekunle was left with only the 8th Battalion at Escravos. He, therefore, protested to Army HQ and got the Lagos garrison upgraded to <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brigade.html" title="Brigade">Brigade</a> status through the creation of the 31 and 33 Battalions (under Majors Aliyu and Hamman, respectively). This Brigade, combined with elements of the <a href="../../../l/a/g/Lagos.html" title="Lagos">Lagos</a> garrison along the eastern <a href="../../../s/e/a/Seaboard.html" title="Seaboard">seaboard</a>, was officially designated the 3 <a href="../../../i/n/f/Infantry.html" title="Infantry">Infantry</a> <a href="../../../d/i/v/Division_%28military%29.html" title="Division (military)">Division</a>. However, Colonel Adekunle did not think the name "3 Infantry Division" was sensational enough nor did it project the nature of the unique terrain in which his men had to fight. Therefore, without formal approval from Army <a href="../../../h/q/_/HQ_8fe4.html" title="HQ">HQ</a>, he renamed it the " 3 Marine <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commando.html" title="Commando">Commando</a> (3MCDO)." The "Black Scorpion" as he came to be known, as leader of the Third <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marine_%28armed_services%29.html" title="Marine (armed services)">Marine</a> Commando Division of the Nigerian Federal Army was easily the most controversial, celebrated and mythologized figure in the war of attrition that laid the foundations for Nigeria's contemporary crisis; and threw a wedge into the national fabric.</p>
<p>Adekunle was involved in formation of then new division, the Third Marine Commando (3MC). This happen after Federal Goverment gained confidence of most south western ethnics group as a direct result of Biafran push to mid-west state and probe into Western region. The purpose of the division is to open third front on Biafra Army so as to over stretch it. He was put in charge preparation and training of the division. The division left Lagos and invaded Biafra via bight of Benin, Nigeria Navy provided the transportation. The division started the war by capturing Island like Bonny which are under the ethnic minority in south east of the country. The name 'marine' was adopted because of the initial riverine warfare experienced by the division. On opening the war front, 3MC was able to push Biafra army inward and clear it off most of the ethnic minorities area, allowing the new 12 state structure of Federal Government to be implemented. This also undermine Biafran dominant ethnic group, the Ibos in influencing the other ethnics in the area. Two governors of the two new minority state were able to be installed and functional after 3MC push. Adekunle popularity during Nigeria civil war was due to the speed at which he defeated Biafran army in major battles and speed of advances. However, the advance became stalled and Biafra was able to push back and recaptured Owerri. Also, Biafra was able to launch various ambushes while the division gain little. This was the state of 3MC before Adekunle was redeployed back to Lagos for new commander who latter use the troop to defeat Biafra. What was remarkable was that, the division came late into the war and gained more territory compare to other divisions fighting from the north of Biafra.</p>
<p>Adekunle was latter put in charge of decongesting Lagos port that was having a chronic problem of clearing imported goods. This was his position before he was put on compulsory retirement.</p>
<p>He attributed his problem during and after the war to his rivals in army. In his various interviews, he said there always a rumour of coup linked to him until the army authority feel concern to do something about it. He had large followings in both the army and public at large and is the most popular military commander during the war apart from Obasanjo who succeeded him and brought the war to an end with same 3MC.</p>
<p>Adekunle led the Third Marine Commando Division with such great panache and determination, and the foreign media, in looking for human angle stuff about the <a href="../../../b/i/a/Biafran.html" title="Biafran">Biafran</a> <a href="../../../w/a/r/War.html" title="War">war</a> found Adekunle a ready source of news. Benjamin Adekunle was promoted <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brigadier-General_cd92.html" title="Brigadier-General">Brigadier-General</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1972.html" title="1972">1972</a>. On August 20th, <a href="../../../1/9/7/1974.html" title="1974">1974</a>, he was compulsorily retired from the Army.</p>
<p>Gen. Adekunle gave a rather grandiose account of his military career in the auto-biographical <i>The Nigeria-Biafra Letters: A Soldier's Story</i>(this was written by his son). Among Nigerians, he is not regarded as highly as his memoirs present him and these writings are seen by many in Nigeria to be another egotistical show and revision of history so common among former military rulers and corrupt officials (both Nigerian and Biafran). Many <a href="../../../i/g/b/Igbo.html" title="Igbo">Igbos</a>, who made up the just over half of the citizens of <a href="../../../b/i/a/Biafra.html" title="Biafra">Biafra</a> (of course citizenship was forced on the <a href="../../../e/f/i/Efik.html" title="Efik">Efik</a>, <a href="../../../i/b/i/Ibibio.html" title="Ibibio">Ibibio</a>, <a href="../../../i/j/a/Ijaw.html" title="Ijaw">Ijaw</a> and other minorities who constituted the rest of Biafra), remember him as a genocidal butcher. He is suspected to have arranged the assassination of Major Isaac Boro, one of his officers.</p>
