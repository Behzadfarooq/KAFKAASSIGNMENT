<p>I think this claim has been removed from the article, but the Amur/Siberian Tiger is definitely the largest subspecies. - <a href="../../../s/l/o/User%7ESlow_Graffiti_1921.html" title="User:Slow Graffiti">Slow Graffiti</a> 03:56, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>That's right. However, it's not that much bigger than the Bengal, only about 25 - 30kg larger.</p>
<p>Can you say something on this page about the distribution of tigers. Can you explain why there are lions in both Asia and Africa but no tigers in Africa.</p>

<p>Someone inserted a dubious tag about the size of the Bengal tiger.... that is, it being the largest of its family. In that case, may we have some references that shows otherwise? What type of tiger is even larger than Bengal tiger? Examples, references would be much appreciated. Thanks. --<a href="../../../r/a/g/User%7ERagib_55a5.html" title="User:Ragib">Ragib</a> 16:05, 14 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I already just gave such a reference: the <a href="../../../s/i/b/Siberian_Tiger_193e.html" title="Siberian Tiger">Siberian Tiger</a> page right here on Wikipedia. Also compare the Google hits for <i>Siberian Tiger largest</i> and <i>Bengal Tiger largest</i>.</dd>
<dd>Of course the might both be the largest by different interpretations. For example, one kind might have the greatest average adult size, and the other might have the largest known individual. Or they might be variously comparing height, length, volume or weight. But if this is so, it would need to be clarified. -- <a href="../../../s/m/j/User%7ESmjg_a789.html" title="User:Smjg">Smjg</a> 11:50, 15 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Where does this story come from? <i>A famous incident involved a maneater pouncing from the water to grab a forest official who was playing cards with others on a patrol boat.

<p>It is not the Bengal tiger which has a tendency to eat humans, it is only the Bengal Tiger in the Sunderbans. This section makes it seem as though all Bengal tigers eat humans, and that is overly broad. I wrote a section on the Sunderbans about these tigers (they are very important to that topic), and I believe it should be deleted from this part. This is because, as I stated in my section, there are things about the Sunderbans tigers that make them unique (no fear of humans, they drink salt water and the like). Since the Bengal tigers in other areas have a history of maneating (like the Champawat maneater), that part should be kept, but the description of the Sunderbans tigers should be kept minimal, with the bulk of that information coming in the Sunderbans article. I will take respsonsibility for the changes, but first I think we should reach a consensus. Considering the reasons Ive shown, what do you guys think? --<a href="../../../p/a/l/User%7EPal5017_9170.html" title="User:Pal5017">Pal5017</a> 03:23, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>If you live in india or Indochina, you must have known of cases wherein tiger takes down bull elephant in one-on-one combat. One such an attack has been recorded in the book&#160;: The vanishing tiger by Vivek Sinha. In my country, it has happened in the past too, especially during the time when elephants and tigers both are numberous.</p>

<p>thre used to be a story on wildlywise.com in which, a tiger fought and killed 4 buffaloes simultaneously. Unfortunately, the site is gone now. I still maintain acopy of the doc on my computer. The name of the doc: Tigers!! Off the beaten track. Here is the quote:</p>
<p>"On the other hand a kill made by a mature male or female tiger is relatively clean, with injuries confined to the back of the neck or through the wind pipe, the latter being the classic method of killing its prey. In both cases the neck is very often broken.In one amazing incident I came across four large buffaloes with their necks broken. This is what happened - A young cowherd was grazing his buffaloes on a remote hill. A very large male tiger appeared and brought down a calf and started dragging it into the forest. The mother of the calf charged the tiger and butted him. The tiger retaliated by attacking the buffalo. While the tiger was engaged with the mother buffaloes three more buffaloes came charging towards him. What happened next was a free for all with the buffaloes bellowing and the tiger roaring. One by one the tiger managed to kill the buffaloes over the next fifteen minutes. Each one died with a broken neck caused by a mighty swipe of the tiger's paw. The tiger then picked up the carcass of the calf, ignored the cowherd, and ambled off. I was unable to establish whether or not the tiger suffered any injuries. The poor cowherd remained deaf for a week after the attack. "</p>
<p>And this:</p>
<p>"On one occasion I heard a fight being waged between a tiger and a herd of elephants that lasted for twenty minutes. I was a kilometer away separated from the scene by a river. The next morning I went to the scene of the battle but found no evidence of blood -apparently the fight was a draw."</p>

<p>This man-made rivalry between tigers vs. lions, elephants, etc. is getting out of hand.</p>
<p>I am no expert on the topic of Bengal tigers, but I am truly disappointed at people who just cannot understand that Tigers vs. Lions will never be pitted against each other in the WILD. If the two species decide to battle in a zoo, there are so many factors outlying against the validation of the fight. Such as the enviroment they're fighting in and which animal is more adapted to the enviroment.</p>
<p>PS. On the comment made above titled: "Tigers -The True King"</p>
<p>Sorry, but your links for pictures are so bogus and uncreditable. Especially the news article that was truly poorly written with spelling and grammar mistakes and the tone of a 15 year old instead of a journalist. Nice try.</p>
<p>Huh, now that u say it, I am Not sure if you are lion supporters, but note that, tiger-the true king is the topic. I'm not comparing it to lions, then why "I am no expert on the topic of Bengal tigers, but I am truly disappointed at people who just cannot understand that Tigers vs. Lions will never be pitted against each other in the WILD.". That's lion-specific. Who cares about lion alone? The link is about tiger fighting others, anything. The newspaper I don't care much, but the report and pic are great. Let me rephrase, to eliminate misunderstanding: Tiger - the true king of fighter. When it comes to skills, we have tiger the best.</p>
<p>PS. Eventhough other predators are one with their fangs, they still need them. On facing the uncanny tigers of a different realm, death is inevitable. --S--</p>

Could somone delete the reference to 'Royal' in the article. The only reason Bengal tigers are refred to as 'royal' is because of the past practice of them being kept by the Raj households as pets. There is nothing 'royal' or 'king-like' about the tigers since the terms are not descriptive of any of their biological or zoological qualities.--Mrg3105 20:08, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I was watching a programme on the National Geographic Channel. During the whole period I was wondering whether the pictures are filmed in Bangladesh. Although Bengali comment had been heard, I thought it could have been West Bengal. But right at the end it was said quite clearly that "Bangladeshi Sunderbans" is the biggest source for the Royal Bengal Tiger. In that case shouldn't the name of Bangladesh would come first(before India)? Indians please don't get angry. India is probably adversing more about Royal Bengal tigers any way.<a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETarif_Ezaz_5326.html" title="User:Tarif Ezaz">Tarif Ezaz Bangladesh</a> 10:43, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I fixed the lack of a &lt;/rev&gt; in one part near the top which completely screwed up the References section (which has been like that for quite a few revisions and nobody has fixed it), as well as the arbitrarily long ref names.</p>
<p>Also, I removed what seems to be a large block of text copy pasted straight from a website, and moved some links to where they belong.</p>
<p>Feel free to fix some of these things if you can, without screwing the page up again like it has been for a <s>while</s> 4 days&#160;;) Arilakon 13:10, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>PLease help improve and expand the habitat section.
