<p>Hi Ben, right I'm not expert on this and so I can't help that much. My monobook seems to work more by luck than judgement! Right the probelm with the Interiot Tool, first. Try going to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Interiot/Tool2/code.js" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Interiot/Tool2/code.js" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Interiot/Tool2/code.js</a> and see fi that works, that may be your problem. If that does not work, I'm not quite sure what to suggest, as you monobook contains the same code as me. Are you saying the popups don't work either? If that's the case I'm not sure what to say. You ought to leave Lupin a message and see what response you get. Feel free to try copying the rest of my Monobook.js and you could look at my monobook.css as well. You may find some fo the other functions etc. handy. Let me know if that works. --<a href="../../../w/i/s/User%7EWisden17_7d7e.html" title="User:Wisden17">Wisd</a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><font color="green"><b>e</b></font></a><a href="../../../w/i/s/User_talk%7EWisden17_883f.html" title="User talk:Wisden17">n17</a> 16:36, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've created a list to support the development of the subject area of life extension on the 'pedia, and since you are a major contributor to the main article on life extension, I was wondering if I could get your valuable feedback on it. Specifically, is the scope of the list right on, too narrow, or too broad? What would be the best approach to develop the list further? Also, you know a great deal about life extension and could no doubt spot gaps and missing topics that should be added to the list. Please have a look. --<a href="../../../t/r/a/User%7ETranshumanist_3b06.html" title="User:Transhumanist">Transhumanist</a> 18:37, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

Annotating the items on the list with a brief explanation of how they pertain to life extension would build value into the list that could not be replicated in the category system. --<a href="../../../t/r/a/User%7ETranshumanist_3b06.html" title="User:Transhumanist">Transhumanist</a> 22:07, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Are you familiar with creating categories? It would be a lot of work, but it would have a similar result as your list. I could help a little, if required. --<a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenbest_2617.html" title="User:Benbest">Ben Best</a> 20:19, 11 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Yes. My initial thought is that we should let the list grow for awhile, and then when it is sufficiently extensive, I could make a copy and have you put abbreviation codes next to the items you think should be tagged with the life extension category or one of its subcategories. Letting the list grow first will expose the relevant sub-categories which should also be created (and which the codes will stand for). Once the work list is coded, then all we'd have to do is click on the entries marked for a particular code and paste the corresponding category tag to the bottom of those pages. A comprehensive list will make this task a lot easier, and will help prevent accidentally opening articles for tagging that have already been tagged, because we can replace the code with a #-mark once they have been tagged. Without a working list, we would have to use category pages to monitor progress and navigate the subject while constructing the category tree, which is a real pain in the ass. When we're ready, we could create from the working list sublists for each category, strip those down to bare text link lists, and then feed them into Wikipedia's <a href="../../../a/w/b/WP%7EAWB_c695.html" title="WP:AWB">Auto wiki browser</a>. Are you registered for using <a href="../../../a/w/b/WP%7EAWB_c695.html" title="WP:AWB">AWB</a>? If not, you should sign up. That wikipedia-editor is quite powerful. In the meantime it wouldn't hurt to create the life extension category and tag the most prominent LE pages to it. --<a href="../../../t/r/a/User%7ETranshumanist_3b06.html" title="User:Transhumanist">Transhumanist</a> 21:17, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

After letting the matter stew awhile, I've come to the conclusion that since you are exceptionally knowledgeable in one or more fields, the value of your time contribution to Wikipedia would be greatest if you focused your donated time on contributing content to articles and applying your scholastic acumen to proofreading articles for factual accuracy. Also, if your awareness of the best resources on the web for your fields is high, then providing links to those where appropriate would also be highly advantageous to the readers of Wikipedia. Having you do mundane editing chores like page tagging would be at the cost of foregoing the application of your expertise. Therefore my advice is to leave the mindless rote tasks to the wikignomes. --<a href="../../../t/r/a/User%7ETranshumanist_3b06.html" title="User:Transhumanist">Transhumanist</a> 17:07, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Since you are represented as yourself on Wikipedia, rather than via a pseudonym, you might consider moving your page User:Benbest to User:Ben Best, and log on henceforth using your new account name. Ben Best is your name, and comes across more professionally than Benbest. Anyone visiting the Benbest page would be redirected to your new user page. In the case that your edit count or contributions become an issue, for instance if you were nominated to be an admin, you would simply include a reference link to your old account's contribution record. --<a href="../../../t/r/a/User%7ETranshumanist_3b06.html" title="User:Transhumanist">''--Transhumanist''</a> 19:23, 16 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Another useful suggestion. Thank you. I will look at doing this shortly, but am at the moment a bit too busy to be spending much time with Wikipedia. I added a few names to the category of "life extensionists" and removed the "biogerontologist" category on the grounds that several on that list are decidedly not life extensionists. You can easily expand on the number of people in that category, a number of obvious candidates were not included. But at least now I am not the ONLY person in the category. Thinking about what subjects to include under the category "life extension" reinforces the value of your <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_life_extension-related_topics.html" title="List of life extension-related topics">List of life extension-related topics</a> precisely because so many of the topics in that list decidedly should NOT be in <a href="../../../l/i/f/Category%7ELife_extension_b2ab.html" title="Category:Life extension">Category:Life extension</a>! In my mind, nearly all of the topics in the list do not belong in the category. <a href="../../../m/a/x/Maximum_life_span.html" title="Maximum life span">Maximum life span</a>, for example, is a subject of critical interest to life extension, but does not fit well in the category. Ditto for most other things on the list starting with <a href="../../../a/c/c/Accelerated_aging_disease.html" title="Accelerated aging disease">Accelerated aging disease</a>. (Thanks for adding that subject, by the way. I have just made a few modifications and am resisting the temptation to do more.

<p>I have asked <a href="../../../c/o/p/User%7ECopOnTheBeat_24f3.html" title="User:CopOnTheBeat">CopOnTheBeat</a> and Freezer Man whether they have been making edits under more than one username. I'd like to see their response. Sometimes people just forget their password and sign up a new account for that or whatever reason, and since these accounts are fairly new, I'd like to assume good faith first.</p>
<p>Regarding the <a href="../../../b/e/n/Ben_Best_35df.html" title="Ben Best">Ben Best</a> article, I understand that it can be frustrating to see other people make edits about you that you don't like. You aren't the first to be somewhat stressed up over it. My advice, for what it's worth, is to try and not take the article so seriously at every point in time. Articles evolve and change. I don't know anything about you and your work, but I'm sure the article will still be here in 10 years, and then looking rather different. It will be a needless waste of energy and frustration for you to watch over it as long as you live. Please do make comments on talk if blatant errors should creep in, but I believe that taking some time off in watching it and discussing every detail in it will do you good. But it's of course easy for me to say. I know. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShanes_8450.html" title="User:Shanes">Shanes</a> 04:26, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for your comments, concerns and help <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShanes_8450.html" title="User:Shanes">Shanes</a>. I realize that it is difficult for others not as familiar with the evidence to see the consistancy of single individual behind multiple sockpuppets and it is too ambitious for me to attempt to explain the reasons. And my request was somewhat off the mark as well as overly ambitious. Off the mark because Freezer Man was simply a replacement for CRANdieter, the former taking over where the latter began, as you can see from the edit history <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ben_Best&amp;offset=20060809174833&amp;limit=20&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ben_Best&amp;offset=20060809174833&amp;limit=20&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>,<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=CRANdieter" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=CRANdieter" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>,<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Freezer+Man" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Freezer+Man" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. What is more relevant and more focused grounds for banning is the fact that you and I have given warning to Freezer Man to stop making personal attacks (<a href="../../../b/e/n/Talk%7EBen_Best_4e76.html#Please_stop_the_harassment" title="Talk:Ben Best">Talk:Ben_Best#Please_stop_the_harassment</a>) and I have given the same warning at <a href="../../../b/e/n/Talk%7EBen_Best_4e76.html#Some_.22hands_off.22_policy.21.21.21" title="Talk:Ben Best">Talk:Ben_Best#Some_.22hands_off.22_policy.21.21.21</a> and the attacks have continued, most undeniably by Freezer Man at <a href="../../../b/e/n/Talk%7EBen_Best_4e76.html#Some_.22hands_off.22_policy.21.21.21" title="Talk:Ben Best">Talk:Ben_Best#Some_.22hands_off.22_policy.21.21.21</a>. Sock puppet deniability would provide grounds for considering <a href="../../../c/o/p/User%7ECopOnTheBeat_24f3.html" title="User:CopOnTheBeat">CopOnTheBeat</a> to be not the same person as Freezer Man and for <a href="../../../c/o/p/User%7ECopOnTheBeat_24f3.html" title="User:CopOnTheBeat">CopOnTheBeat</a> to not have been present when you issued your <a href="../../../b/e/n/Talk%7EBen_Best_4e76.html#Please_stop_the_harassment" title="Talk:Ben Best">Talk:Ben_Best#Please_stop_the_harassment</a>. But Freezer Man has been identifiably, repeatedly and undeniably warned to stop personal attack and that this is in violation of Wikipedia policy -- and yet has continued to engage in personal attack. I believe that this is grounds for Freezer Man to be banned. If others engage in personal attack after having been warned, they should also be banned, whether or not they are sock puppets of the same individual.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, it is disturbing when a family of sock puppets from one individual -- or when several people -- use a biography and the associated TALK page as a vehicle for personal attack. Meaning especially disturbing to me when I am the target. The <a href="../../../b/e/n/Ben_Best_35df.html" title="Ben Best">Ben Best</a> page is certainly very different from what I would like. I have not edited it since June, but I see nothing wrong with providing corrections and additional information on the <a href="../../../b/e/n/Talk%7EBen_Best_4e76.html" title="Talk:Ben Best">Talk:Ben_Best</a> page -- or on the User TALK page of those who I sense are interested in creating a factually correct article about me. Hypocritically, Freezer Man DEMANDED on <a href="../../../b/e/n/Talk%7EBen_Best_4e76.html" title="Talk:Ben Best">Talk:Ben_Best</a> that I provide information about my education <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Ben_Best&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=68726521" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Ben_Best&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=68726521" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>, and I accommodated his request. Yes, I can accept the <a href="../../../b/e/n/Ben_Best_35df.html" title="Ben Best">Ben Best</a> entry not being what I would like, but surely you can see that intentional personal attack and vandalism deserves to be dealt with, and that it is of especial concern to me when it is directed against me personally. --<a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenbest_2617.html" title="User:Benbest">Ben Best</a> 09:50, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I understand. What I can do is to courtesy blank the Ben Best talk page. Either completely or just the parts that are off topic to the article content. I could do that now, or I can wait a a few days until things have calmed more down. What I'd like is to cause the least amount of fuss and commotion as that is clearly for the best for all parts. As for the vandalism, I can't see there's been any vandalism to the article for a while. Either way, If you feel I'm being too slow and would like quicker action here, you can file for a <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFC_94fc.html" title="WP:RFC">Request for comments</a> and get more people and administrators involved.

<dd>Thanks, <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShanes_8450.html" title="User:Shanes">Shanes</a>, but "courtesy blanking" <a href="../../../b/e/n/Talk%7EBen_Best_4e76.html" title="Talk:Ben Best">Talk:Ben_Best</a> removes documentation of the history of personal attack. This should be prominent evidence for you or others who may take an interest in the matter. I still think there is ample evidence for banning Freezer Man, who has been warned against personal attack yet continued. However, if you want to wait a few days for whatever reason, that's fine. I am disturbed, but not traumatized by these attacks. I can be patient although I doubt that it will do any good. This campaign began in June and patience has not yielded much change in the situation. --<a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenbest_2617.html" title="User:Benbest">Ben Best</a> 11:09, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If I blank it, it will still be there in the talk-page history. It will just be less accessible for the casual reader who comes to the article and then clicks the talk page link. Blanking of bio-talk pages are sometimes done when its content can be seen as libelous and hurting the subject of the article. Anyway, Freezer man hasn't edited for a few days. When and if he returns I'd like to see his response to the sockpuppet suspicion and maybe get a clearer idea of what his motivations for editing here are. If I'm convinced he's just here to cause trouble, I'll block him right away.

<dd>Freezer Man has shown a great capacity not only for persistance, but for patience in his attacks. I feel it is important to answer accusations because failure to do so can support the view that the accusations have substance. Therefore I have just answered Freezer Man's accusation that I have engaged in childish deception. I have tried to do so in a way that is purely defensive and which does not involve counterattack. --<a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenbest_2617.html" title="User:Benbest">Ben Best</a> 15:06, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't know if you can help me or if this is the right place to contact you. My mother has PLS, the motor neuron disease, the slower moving version of ALS, Lou Gehrig's disease. Is there anything that you know of that could cause the motor neurons to not work in some areas. She is 69 years old. She has had silver fillings in the past. She has used anti-perspirants in the past with the aluminum stuff in them. She has had one of those homeopathic magnetic beds and pillows that she slept on for many years. Is there anything physics or magnetism related that would raise a red flag in causing motor neuron failure that you can think of? The doctors have no treatment and I am just shooting in the dark asking people anything I can. Novice thinking, magnetism=positive and negative. Nerves and electrons signals = positive and negative. Can this cause a body's electrical system to get messed up? If so, how can you fix it?</p>
<p>any possible direction to send me would be appreciated, if I am in the wrong place. Thanks Cary Harris cary.harris@verizon.net I hope this is how to contact you.</p>

<p>About being cadmium rather than zinc, I know both both form d<sup>10</sup> ions but Cd is more <i>broad minded</i> an element than zinc. Being an inorganic chemist who has worked with both zinc and cadmium chemistry (plus much of the rest of the periodic table) I decided that Cd was more fun than Zn.<a href="../../../c/a/d/User%7ECadmium_6e55.html" title="User:Cadmium">Cadmium</a></p>
<p>Well I would reason that Cd is more broad minded than Hg as Cd binds well to both hard (O) and soft (S) donor atoms, while Hg++ does not bind that well to the harder donors. Also Hg is complicated by those werido effects due to the fact that some of the electrons are wizzing almost at light speed. I know that Hg does form a "+1" oxidation state but that is oftein [Hg2]++ which is not a simple ion, I would like to know what the UV-<a href="../../../p/e/s/PES_a6af.html" title="PES">PES</a> of the Hg2++ ion is like. Are both mercurys in the +1 oxidation state or is one +2 and the other zero valent&#160;? I have not looked up the PES data for Hg2++ but maybe I should. Are you a chemist&#160;? as you seem to know something about chemicals.<a href="../../../c/a/d/User%7ECadmium_6e55.html" title="User:Cadmium">Cadmium</a></p>
<p>Good point the PES page is mostly about XPS, I hold the view that XPS is less interesting than UV-PES. This is becuase using other methods such as XRF and SEM/EDX it is possible to get details of what elements are in a sample, but PES has a special ability to measure the binding energy of the electrons in the valence orbitials. I think that a better example of PES showing if two environments for the same element are present in the same system should be used for the PES page. Perhapes thiosulphate (known as hypo which is used as a fixer in AgBr based photography) would be a better example.<a href="../../../c/a/d/User%7ECadmium_6e55.html" title="User:Cadmium">Cadmium</a></p>

Be sure to welcome him to Wikipedia, and let him know in a friendly manner that you are more than willing to discuss his desired changes on the article's talk page, and that if he has any questions about how Wikipedia works, that you will be happy to explain anything he is unsure about. It's important not to take a defensive tone with new users. Strive for empathy, openess, and friendly cooperation. It can be rather traumatic for new users to be scolded and have a bunch of rules shortcuts flung at them. So be personable, and help acclimatize new contributors to Wikipedia. Please follow <b><a href="../../../p/l/e/Wikipedia%7EPlease_do_not_bite_the_newcomers_ec77.html" title="Wikipedia:Please do not bite the newcomers">Wikipedia:Please do not bite the newcomers</a></b> carefully. If after being extended every courtesy he decides to disregard his fellow editors and be disruptive, report further violations of 3RR at <b><a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_3RR_dc8f.html" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/3RR">Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/3RR</a></b>. I hope you find my comments helpful.

<dd>Your comments would be appropriate if the edits were neutral. Perhaps you did not read the content of the edits. They were determinedly derogatory: both factually incorrect and designed to present facts in the most negative possible light. --<a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenbest_2617.html" title="User:Benbest">Ben Best</a> 17:36, 10 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I read the edits carefully. It appears he believes what he has been writing, though his facts are a bit out of date. He may feel that the article is skewed from the opposite perspective (written to present facts in the most positive possible light). And because of this he may not understand that POV edits are unacceptable, nor why. Or he may just be what you've suspected from the start: a vandal or a troll. You should still try to be nice to the guy. Please read <b><a href="../../../d/o/n/Wikipedia%7EDon%27t_feed_the_trolls_7c07.html" title="Wikipedia:Don't feed the trolls">Wikipedia:Don't feed the trolls</a></b>. Treat others with the utmost kindess and civility. Any wrong they do in the face of such treatment will be amplified ten-fold in contrast to your cordiality. Don't let him rile you up. <i><b><a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Transhumanist_1191.html" title="User:The Transhumanist"><font color="#808">Th<font color="#00F">e Tr<font color="#490">ans<font color="#D92">hu<font color="#D40">man<font color="#B00">ist</font> &#160;&#160;</font></font></font></font></font></a></b></i>22:29, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
