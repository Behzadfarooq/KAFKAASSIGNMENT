<p>When asked, who is the best elephant in the world, children have just one answer: <i><b>Benjamin the Elephant!</b></i><br />
This friendly pachyderm lives together with many other animals in Newtown Zoo. But one thing sets him apart from his animal friends: he can talk. And his unmistakable distinguishing feature is his "Torooo!" which is always booming loudly out of the zoo.<br />
Everyone in Newtown knows Benjamin! This is because the loveable elephant always lends a hand wherever help is needed. His best friend Otto and smart little Stella are always by his side, because even Benjamin sometimes has small mishaps or doesn't know what to do - just a normal "person" like us. This exciting trio of friends has fun and pleasure in experiencing everyday or unusual situations in Newtown, in the zoo or sometimes even far from home.</p>

<p>The stories which Benjamin experiences are full of felling, fun and excitement. The ideas that this big, strong, loveable elephant uses to deal with the challenges that he meets are often unconventional, but he and his best friends Otto and smart little Stella always involve themselves fully in their adventures.<br /></p>
<p>For Benjamin, this often means slipping into various roles, learning new jobs or discovering new and distant places with his usual appetite for adventure. These and many other themes build the basis for all the Benjammin stories.</p>

<p><b>Benjamin</b> - is real elephant: big and strong, cuddly and good-natured. He loves lazing around. But when something is going on around him, he is on his feet in a trice and ready to act. Then we hear his unmistakable "Toroo!". He is very helpful and if he promise help then you can rely on him one hundred per cent. Benjamin's home is Newtown Zoo and the Zoo Director, Carl the Keeper and all the animals are his family. His best friend of all is Otto. Benjamin spends nearly every afternoon with him and every weekend, and together they experience many adventures.</p>
<p><b>Otto</b> - 10-year old Otto is Benjamin's best friend. He is nice, polite, friendly and a very sensible boy. And since Otto knows a lot for a boy his age, he is able to explain things to Benjamin at times when he gets stuck. Otto visits Benjamin in the zoo just about every afternoon after school. They also spend nearly every weekend and the holidays together. From time to time, they even go on their travels together. Benjamin and Otto are a true team of friends.</p>
<p><b>Stella Stellini</b> - is Otto's classmate and is also a friend of Benjamin's. Stella is cheeky, energetic, adventurous and very sporty. Unlike Otto, Stella is very independent and often starts something on her own. When she is dealing with injustice, being headstrong, she often runs at brick walls. If Stella can't make any headway with a problem, or something goes wrong, then Benjamin and Otto are by her side as quick as a flash.</p>
<p><b>The Zoo Director</b> - is a good-natured, friendly old gentleman. He lives and breathes his job as zoo director. Nothing is more important than the well-being of his animals. He is in charge of Newtown Zoo and looks after all its inhabitants as if they were his children. The Zoo Director trusts Benjamin completely. If ever he needs his help, he is always able to count on his talking elephant.</p>
<p><b>Carl the Keeper</b> - is the zoo director's right hand and is well-loved by all zoo animals. He looks after them with great love and care, keeps the enclosures in good repair, mends fences, fixes the heating when it breaks down and also orders the animal's food. Carl the Keeper loves his job. It is from Carl that Benjamin always finds out the latest news about the zoo and the animals.</p>
<p><b>Gulliver</b> - the cheeky raven knows everything and can do everything better than the others - at least he thinks so. The odd misfortune here or there does nothing to change his impetuous character.</p>
<p><b>Carla Caramba</b> - Benjamin is friends with Carla Caramba, the roving lady reporter. Everyone in Newtown knows her cheery "Hello there!" and her famous "Sensationall!". She is always on hand to help, especially when it's a matter of publicizing any scandals or injustices hatched by the Mayor of Newtown. Then Benjamin, Carla and Otto all work together.</p>
<p><b>The Mayor</b> - carries weight as Newtown's premier citizen, as well as on his person! He is rather vain and highhanded and is therefore often unjust. However, Benjamin, Otto and Carla always manage to make him change his attitude with their clever ideas. In the end they find a fair solution for everything.</p>
<p><b>Pickler</b> - is the mayor's secretary. Although he always conforms to duty, he is a clever man with a sense of justice. When Benjamin and his friends are able to assert themselves against the mayor, he is always secretly pleased.</p>
<p><b>Baron Blunderbuss</b> - ia a haughty aristocrat. He lives in a villa with enormous grounds right next to Newtown Zoo. The Baron has close contact to the Mayor and they support each other when it comes to promoting their interests. The Baron doesn't have much good to say about Benjamin the Elephant. His loud "Toroo!", which often reverberates around the zoo walls, disturb his peace and quiet.</p>
<p><b>Hinky and Pinky</b> - are the two crooks from Newtown. Hinky is tall and thin and a bit stupid, Pinky is fat and much cleverer. Wherever the pair appear, they are up to no good. But Benjamin and Otto are always on the spot and are able to get the pair arrested in the end.</p>
