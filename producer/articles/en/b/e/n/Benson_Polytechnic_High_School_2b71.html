<p>Benson Polytechnic High School began in <a href="../../../1/9/0/1908.html" title="1908">1908</a> as the Portland School of Trades in the Atkinson Building at 11th and Davis in Northwest Portland. It was established to give "boys who wished to enter a trade a better opportunity than do shops and factories of the present time." Any boy from <a href="../../../p/o/r/Portland%2C_Oregon_1e41.html" title="Portland, Oregon">Portland</a> who was at least fourteen years old, or who was a grammar school graduate, could attend. The course of study was three years. Students could also attend night school and/or summer sessions at the trade school.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/0/1909.html" title="1909">1909</a>, a course of study for girls was added. The Portland School of Trades was coeducational until 1913 when the girls' departments were moved to the Lownsdale School (which later became <a href="../../../l/i/n/Lincoln_High_School_%28Portland%29_c310.html" title="Lincoln High School (Portland)">Lincoln High School</a>).</p>

<p>The Portland School Board voted to change the school's name to Benson Polytechnic High School after civic leader and philanthropist <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simon_Benson_2599.html" title="Simon Benson">Simon Benson</a> gave $100,000 in 1917 to the Portland School District for the construction of a building to house a technical school. The School Board appropriated an equal amount of money. Six blocks of land at Northeast 12th and Hoyt were purchased and a building was built, and the new Benson Polytechnic School opened its doors in September 1918 to 46 boys.</p>
<p>Benson Polytechnic School served not only the educational needs of the city's youth, but also the defense needs of a nation at war. During <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_I_9429.html" title="World War I">World War I</a> the federal government took control of the school. Twenty-four hours a day, recruits were stationed and trained on the campus. North and south wings were added to the back of the school building to serve as a barracks for the troops.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/n/Benson_Polytechnic_High_School_2b71.html" title="Edit section: Expansion and the Second World War">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Expansion and the Second World War</span></h3>
<p>After <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_I_9429.html" title="World War I">World War I</a>, the barracks became shop classrooms, and surplus government property was purchased and used as shop equipment. Mr. Benson gave the student body $10,000, and the first Tech Show was presented to the Portland community. Benson Polytechnic School grew rapidly in course offerings and in student population. In <a href="../../../1/9/2/1920.html" title="1920">1920</a>, the printing department was set up and the school paper, the Tech Pep. was published. In 1923, Benson's own radio station, KFIF, signed on. In 1930, when KFIF became too expensive for the student body to operate, the District accepted ownership of the station. The station was renamed <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_radio_stations_in_Oregon_52d1.html" title="List of radio stations in Oregon">KBPS</a> (for Benson Polytechnic School) and has continued to this day to operate on the Benson campus and to be staffed by Benson students. In <a href="../../../1/9/2/1926.html" title="1926">1926</a>, an aviation department was added to the school. By <a href="../../../1/9/4/1940.html" title="1940">1940</a>, Benson had 2,800 students and was the largest school in Portland.</p>
<p>During World War II, the federal government once again utilized Benson Polytechnic School. Training men during swing and graveyard shifts, the War Production Board kept the Benson building in use twenty-four hours a day for every day of the war. The building was a high school for Portland's young men from 8 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. and a training facility for federal industry from 2:30 p.m. until 8 a.m.</p>
<p>Deterioration of both the facility and the student body was a concern following World War II. Because the building had been in continuous use during the war, it was left in extremely poor condition. Benson became a "dumping ground" for troubled students from 1945 to 1952.</p>

<p>In 1953, the Portland School Board launched a five-year building program to upgrade Benson. A library and automotive wing were completed in 1954. The north shop wing was remodeled in 1955 and the south shop wing in 1960. Benson became <a href="../../../c/o/-/Co-educational.html" title="Co-educational">co-educational</a> once in September 1973. Seven females attended that year. When the health occupations program was moved from Washington High School to Benson in 1980, Benson's female population grew substantially.</p>
<p>An arsonist's fire damaged offices and classrooms in the main section of Benson on January 3, 1991. Coincidentally, the School Board had already scheduled the Benson facility for major improvements. In 1991, a new health occupation wing, a new library, a new student services center, and a new band room were added; and halls and offices were modernized.</p>

<p>As a <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magnet_school.html" title="Magnet school">magnet school</a>, Benson is highly selective among the Portland area. Until recently, students were required to complete an application for admissions. This, however, is no longer the case due to the requirements of the <a href="../../../n/o/_/No_Child_Left_Behind_Act_51fb.html" title="No Child Left Behind Act">No Child Left Behind Act</a>; instead a lottery is used to determine which students are admitted. As of Fall 2003, there were 1508 students enrolled in Benson. 84% are seeking a higher degree after graduation.</p>
