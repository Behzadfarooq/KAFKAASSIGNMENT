<p>Thanks for informing me. I am quite new to wiki. I have put in some content (a minimal one to start with so that I learn the rules first in due time) at the temp page as suggested by the site. Thanx -- Phaedreus</p>
<dl>
<dd>That's okay. It's a valid article to have (thought I would capitalise both names as Richard Castra, I'll happily move the page for you to that title if you like). You cannot copy wordings directly from another site. You can however put things in your own wording and expand upon it. That is fine. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBen_W_Bell_a229.html" title="User:Ben W Bell"><font color="blue"><b>Ben W Bell</b></font></a> <a href="../../../b/e/n/User_talk%7EBen_W_Bell_4407.html" title="User talk:Ben W Bell"><i><font color="blue">talk</font></i></a> 09:15, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>I noticed your edits to my talk page, although you removed them - so apologies for bringing this up (you can always remove my comment here if you like!) Nevertheless, I'll just leave a quick note here re: the Irish placenames.</p>
<p>I realise that it's a slightly controversial addition to the NI pages, but I do see it as being relevant content for the encyclopaedia. Mostly the current placenames are based on the Irish, so it is good to provide information on how towns got their names. Ideally, what the Irish actually means should be added also (it's not on all town articles, north or south, at present).</p>

<p>I can't agree, its already made abundantly clear earlier in the article what the six counties are.</p>

<dd>Sorry which article again? The Irish Constitution one or the Ulster one? <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBen_W_Bell_a229.html" title="User:Ben W Bell">Ben W Bell</a> 10:46, 24 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The Ulster article, it's explained clearly and mentioned twice in the Geography and Demographics section, near the beginning, and again right before your edit.</p>

<dd>Well the line read "While the Ulster Catholics of Northern Ireland have long opposed Northern Ireland's existence, the Ulster Protestants of the three Republic of Ireland counties have assimilated well (although there was a good deal of migration into the six counties following partition)." It just doesn't flow for me, it reads to ambiguously. Six counties is just six counties, could be any counties. Now I have no objections to the use of six counties in this paragraph at all, but do think (personally) that it needs a slight clarification. If you don't want to use "Northern Ireland's six counties" then "other six counties" would work just as well (and would probably resolve having Northern Ireland mention by name so many times in one sentence. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBen_W_Bell_a229.html" title="User:Ben W Bell">Ben W Bell</a> 10:58, 24 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I take your point, "other six counties" seems the best option.</p>

<dd>Tesla, no problems. I think this user is the one also known as B1link82 and Houghone who has been banned for vandalism, and insulting conduct and have made a point of keeping an eye on him. I could be wrong, in fact I would like to be surprised. As for the images, I've seen them on the BBC site and couple of other news agency sites [<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_pictures/4728171.stm" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_pictures/4728171.stm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>] for one of them. I have reported them as Copyright Violations on the image and media section of the Wikipedia.</dd>

I think this user is the one also known as B1link82 and Houghone who has been banned for vandalism, and insulting conduct and have made a point of keeping an eye on him. I could be wrong, in fact I would like to be surprised.</p>
<p>You are indeed wrong and as to your habit of cyber stalking users who you have no reasonable proof to suspect of being other users I think your conduct is diabolical. What gives you the right to follow new users around? You've put me off using Wikipedia ever again. Is it your job to turn people away from Wikipedia or did you bestow that honour on yourself? I suspect the latter. Keep away from users you do not know in future you are doing more harm than good.</p>

<p>Actually Timewaster I'd already come to the conclusion you weren't the same person at all, the perosn I was thinking of was rather inarticulate which you are not. You coincidentally appeared the day after his other account was banned and were editing the same pages which I why I initially jumped to the conclusion, but I have since realised I was wrong. Don't leave Wikipedia, I think you have something to offer. I didn't stalk users, in fact I only came onto your talk page to talk about the SAS photos on the SAS page, a matter which was a valid one. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBen_W_Bell_a229.html" title="User:Ben W Bell">Ben W Bell</a> 16:02, 13 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Ben. In fact, the new agency, Slum Tourism Toronto, created by the Parkdale Tenants Association, is geared to tourists and will be offering a free "Slums Unlimited" bus tour of several Toronto slum neighbourhoods to show tourists another, less glossy, side of Toronto starting February 2, as featured on their website. Don't you think tourists should see the true character of a city, warts and all? The Parkdale Tenants Association, which has been around more than 30 years, and is quite well respected, obviously feels that by showing tourists a different side of Toronto than what they usually see on a traditional tour, the City and the Province will improve conditions and make Toronto a better city for everybody, one that all Torontonians will be proud to call home, not just those who can afford decent accomodations. I'm not sure why you consider this a less worthy tourist site than any other. Their upcoming bus tour has received widespread international attention and has been featured in literally thousands of articles as far away as India, Australia and Italy as well as on ABC News and MSNBC. Hope that answers your question. I believe this falls under the guidelines of Wikipedia and is in the appropriate category. Please enable the email settings in your preferences section if you want to continue this discussion. Take care.</p>
<p>UPDATE: Somebody has created a new category on the Toronto site, "protest websites", and moved Slum Tourism Toronto there. I can live with that. In response to your point about it promoting a business, the bus tours are free, thus it does not contravene Wikipedia policy.</p>

<p>Hello, Ben. I clarified your change to the <a href="../../../t/o/r/Toronto_Eaton_Centre_bc0f.html" title="Toronto Eaton Centre">Toronto Eaton Centre</a> article. Despite your opinion that it doesn't rate above the CN Tower, the TEC draws far more visitors. I have clarified the reference to make clear the reference to "top tourist attraction" is based on the number of visitors. Qualitatively you are correct -- each tourist probably has their own view as to what constitutes their top attraction. <a href="../../../s/k/e/User%7ESkeezix1000_63e3.html" title="User:Skeezix1000">Skeezix1000</a> 14:15, 9 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That's fair enough. Toronto City itself lists the CN Tower as the top tourist attraction, but yes more tourists probably go through the Eaton Centre than anywhere else in the city (other than Pearson).

<p>See my comments on my talk page about how I use popups. A popups revert is almost always "rvv". On the Toronto page today, which I think is what motivated your comment, some editor change the pop-stats and then made a talk page comment with the word "str8" in there. Instant reversion, no follow up required in my opinion. He can paste a confirming URL in the talk page instead of "str8" next time. <a href="../../../j/o/k/User%7EJok2000_bdd4.html" title="User:Jok2000">Jok2000</a> 16:20, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Um firstly stop being so strong, I made one reversion that was tucked in with a bunch of vandalism. Secondly Charles Darwin came up with the theory of evolution. That may have been accepted as fact now by the scientific community but he didn't establish it as a fact, he established it as a theory, and it has been worked on ever since. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBen_W_Bell_a229.html" title="User:Ben W Bell">Ben W Bell</a> 12:56, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ok, sorry... I've just had to fight creationists on this for a while now &amp; frustration boiled over. Didn't mean to insult you... You misunderstand me, Darwin is famous for BOTH establishing the <b>fact</b> of evolution (i.e. in the descriptive sense of <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transmutation_of_species.html" title="Transmutation of species">transmutation of species</a> and decent with modification) AND the <b>theory</b> of natural selection which explains why evolution in the descriptive sense occurs. Please read the Stephen Jay Gould article (or see the Charles Darwin talk page for a relevant excerpt), he explains it very nicely. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkerpikker_c3cf.html" title="User:Mikkerpikker">Mikkerpikker</a> 13:03, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I must say I have no interest in editing this article, but as a scientist I do feel the first sentence is extremely misleading. Technically you cannot apply the word fact to a scientific principle or answer. No amount of experimentation can ever prove a scientific theory to be correct, but a single experiment can prove them to be wrong. In the world of science the word 'fact' is only used to mean 'as fits current evidence' and that is all the 'Theory of Evolution' is. So to use the strong wording of fact in the opening paragraph as it is is very misleading. But as I say editing the article holds no real interest for me as it is a controversial issue. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBen_W_Bell_a229.html" title="User:Ben W Bell">Ben W Bell</a> 13:08, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I see what you're saying but, for our purposes, there are two relevant types of propositions: observables &amp; theories. Now, theories <b>explain</b> observables and, you're right, we can never be absolutely certain about a theory, but we're usually quite certain about observables. It is a <b>fact</b> that apples fall when not supported, and the theory of universal gravitation explains why. It is also a fact that the globe is warming and the theory of the greenhouse effect explains why. In neither of these (or related) cases will the facts change if the theories are revised. Einstein didn't prove apples don't fall, he merely changed the theory that does the explanation... Similarly, evolution (in the sense that organisms adapt to their environment) is a fact - one we're about as certain about as, say, that the earth is spherical. The theory of natural selection could one day be disproved, but evolution in the descriptive sense is as unassailable as apples falling &amp; the sky being blue. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkerpikker_c3cf.html" title="User:Mikkerpikker">Mikkerpikker</a> 13:18, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The template for a county, as shown on [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WikiProject_U.S._Counties#Template_for_a_U.S._County" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WikiProject_U.S._Counties#Template_for_a_U.S._County" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>] shows that the subject should start off with "_ is a county in the U.S. state of [[_]]."</p>
<p>If articles written to spec are not acceptable, then CHANGE THE DAMNABLE TEMPLATE. I don't mind domating my time to a good project.

I also applaud your level-headed response to ClairSamoht's strongly worded comments.

<p>You are, of course, correct in that the country should be identified. However, since (I believe) most of the articles on United States geography are written by Americans, you will (randomly) find thousands of them that assume that, if the name of the U.S. state is given, it is adequate to identify the location of the entity. Americans (including me, I'd have to admit) sadly assume that they are writing only for other Americans to read. It's unfortunate, but when they say "California", it is assumed that "yes, it's in the United States, by the way. Where else could it be?"</p>

<dd>Yes I'm aware of that, however some editors need to be aware that the encyclopaedia is not United States centric. It's not a problem, I just change it where I find it. The reason there are so many is because most of the United States geographical pages were imported from the USGS through an automated process and it wasn't thought of as the USGS doesn't mention what country things are in as it's for the United States. I change when I find them, as do others. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBen_W_Bell_a229.html" title="User:Ben W Bell">Ben W Bell</a> 09:03, 10 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There are communities named California in Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Missouri, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Virginia. For that reason, it's appropriate to specify the state of California for purposes of disambiguity, but it's not like there is a California in the Ukraine or a California in Australia that it might be confused with. If you are going to specify the country, shouldn't you logically write "State of California, United States of America, North America, Western Hemisphere, Northern Hemisphere, Earth, Solar System, Milky Way Galaxy" so that people are REALLY sure where it's at?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>And if you're going to specify "United States", oughtn't you fully state "United States of America", so as to make it clear you're not talking about, say, the "United States of Mexico"? I realize that it's a misnomer, being 46 states, 4 commonwealths, and a district in North America and Polynesia, not to mention vassal states like the US Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam, outposts like Gitmo, and Antarctica, and a couple of used cars sitting on the moon.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Many states in the USA are bigger in size, larger in population, and have a larger economy than countries that are admitted to the UN. There are 15 countries listed in the CIA World Factbook that could fit their entire population into a college football stadium. There are 22 that have smaller populations than the University of Phoenix student body. Is it reasonable to assume that people know where "Nassau, Jamaica" is, but not "Nassau, New York", when the Nassau metropolis has a larger population than the entire population of Jamaica?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>To me, it makes sense to provide additional information when the placename is ambiguous, and when the population falls below a certain threshold, but deciding that Columbus (MSA population: 1.6 million), Ohio (population: 11.4 million)is an inadequate identifier, but Roseau (population: 14,847), Dominia (population: 69,029) is an adequate one? It isn't logical. Just ask Spock.</dd>

<dd>It's fine if you come from the United States to presume it is a US State, but no other country in the world can have an entry that just lists Town then County/State/Province, they all have to list the country. You cannot presume that everyone in the world knows all the United States states, it's not a fair assumption to make. I believe all locations should tell the reader what country it is as as this is after all a completely international encyclopaedia. As for using United States well that is the accepted Wikipedia name for the United States of America. Just look up <a href="../../../u/s/a/USA_f75d.html" title="USA">USA</a>, <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_of_America_8a5e.html" title="United States of America">United States of America</a> and see where it ends up, that particular topic has been discussed and resolved on the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> page. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBen_W_Bell_a229.html" title="User:Ben W Bell">Ben W Bell</a> 16:12, 10 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Re: "but no other country in the world can have an entry that just lists Town then County/State/Province, they all have to list the country." Not true at all. There are many examples from Wikipedia itself: In the article on the city of <a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbsen" class="external text" title="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbsen" rel="nofollow">/ Garbsen</a> in the German edition of Wikipedia, the introduction states that the city is located in the state of Niedersachsen, but nowhere does it state that either the city or the state is located in Germany (Deutschland). It is assumed that the reader (primarily German, I would think) knows that it is in Germany. In the article on the city of <a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passau" class="external text" title="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passau" rel="nofollow">/ Passau</a>, not only does the introduction not state that the city is in Germany, but it does not even state that it is in the state of Bavaria (Bayern), although it does state that it is "on the Austrian border"! In the article on the city of <a href="http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gela" class="external text" title="http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gela" rel="nofollow">/ Gela</a> in the Italian edition of Wikipedia, the introduction says that the city is in the province of Caltanisetta, and that it is on the coast of Sicily, but nowhere does it say that the city or Sicily are in Italy. It is assumed that the (and here I'm assuming too) mostly Italian or Italian-speaking audience knows that they are in Italy. In the article on the commune of <a href="http://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lidingö_kommun" class="external text" title="http://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lidingö_kommun" rel="nofollow">/ Lidingö</a> in the Swedish edition of Wikipedia, the intro states that the commune is in Stockholm county (Stockholms län), but it doesn't tell you that either Lidingö or Stockholm county are in Sweden. I don't read Japanese or Polish, but I'm sure that if I could, I would find examples in the Wikipedia editions of those languages as well. But I'm sure that you get the point, that this situation does not confine itself to the United States or English-speaking people. Backspace 04:03, 11 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I totally agree with you. On the English speaking version it is mainly United States articles, simply due to how many of them there are and not due to deliberateness on the part of the editors. I have also come across many cases where places have no country in the United Kingdom, Australia and even France in my random travels, which I promptly make geographically neutral. On the other language encyclopaedias it is also an issue but I rarely if ever edit on those as I'm not particularly fluent in the languages they are written in. To my mind if a location is mentioned then it should be qualified, no matter what version it is in or where it is. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBen_W_Bell_a229.html" title="User:Ben W Bell">Ben W Bell</a> 07:34, 11 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hey Ben - I noticed a specific sentence in your userpage, in which you say you're interested "in the neutral portrayal of the articles relating to Northern Ireland." With that in mind, PLEASE take a look at the <a href="../../../n/o/r/Portal%7ENorthern_Ireland_ff29.html" title="Portal:Northern Ireland">Northern Ireland Portal</a> and the <a href="../../../n/o/r/Wikipedia%7ENorthern_Irish_Wikipedians%27_notice_board_6373.html" title="Wikipedia:Northern Irish Wikipedians' notice board">Northern Irish Wikipedians' notice board</a>, both of which I've set up pretty recently. I think standards need set, and many articles need cleaned up and created. I'm not asking you to necessarily put in any more work than you already do, but just that you're aware of proposals, articles in need etc. --<a href="../../../s/e/t/User%7ESetanta747_5845.html" title="User:Setanta747">Mal</a> 14:42, 21 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I must say that on that I tend to police other users edits rather than make my own edits.

<p>Well policing edits is a valuable contribution. Read my proposals for future plans on my talk page:<a href="../../../s/e/t/User_talk%7ESetanta747_f5bb.html#Great_Work" title="User talk:Setanta747">(Great Work)</a>. I understand your reluctance to a certain extent, but so far its been reasonably successful, and I'm hoping to start off with advertising the Portal and Notice Board to only a select few (the pages aren't a secret of course!). I'm thinking of compiling a recent edits watchlist page which will include (eventually) all the articles relating specifically to Northern Ireland - a big project I realise, but a start should be made, and it might be handy. --<a href="../../../s/e/t/User%7ESetanta747_5845.html" title="User:Setanta747">Mal</a> 15:04, 21 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>Wikifying the month and the day in square brackets is mainly to allow the dates to be displayed in the users preferred format. i.e. Day then Month or Month then Day. That way each user sees the dates as they have specified. People often wikify the years as well but I think it's overkill, but the month and day must be done to allow the preference display. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBen_W_Bell_a229.html" title="User:Ben W Bell">Ben W Bell</a> 14:08, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Um I removed it because Brandin William Erickson is not a notable person. He is not president of the United States and an internet search turns up no hits for him. Wikipedia is an encyclopaedia and not dumping ground for what people want the world to be or to express people's hopes and aspirations. If Brandin William Erickson ever becomes a notable person or ever becomes president then come back and we'll talk, but as it stands there is no reason for him to be on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBen_W_Bell_a229.html" title="User:Ben W Bell">Ben W Bell</a> 08:22, 23 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Ben,</p>
<p>I was thinking about your recent edits changing 'Ireland' to 'Republic of Ireland' On the <a href="../../../i/r/e/Ireland.html" title="Ireland">Ireland</a> page it says; "it is composed of the Republic of Ireland (officially named Ireland), a state which covers five-sixths of the island..."</p>
<p>Also; "This state is often simply referred to internally and internationally as "Ireland" in English or "Éire" in Irish. Technically Ireland and Éire are the official names of the state while the "Republic of Ireland" is its official description"</p>
<p>You might have a big job on your hands changing all the occurances of 'Ireland' to 'Republic of Ireland'&#160;:-) <a href="../../../j/h/o/User%7EJhonan_8210.html" title="User:Jhonan">Jhonan</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/h/o/User_talk%7EJhonan_c75b.html" title="User talk:Jhonan">talk</a></sup> 10:52, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yeah but Ireland is ambiguous and open to differing interpretations depending on geographical and political ideologies, Republic of Ireland is unambiguous. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBen_W_Bell_a229.html" title="User:Ben W Bell">Ben W Bell</a> 10:56, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><a href="../../../i/r/e/Ireland.html" title="Ireland">Ireland</a> states that the official name is 'Ireland', and the description is 'Republic of Ireland' Geographically the word 'Ireland' refers to the whole Island. I think disambiguation of the geographic articles is only necessary where the same place name exists in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. But, it's your call, I don't take offence to either. <a href="../../../w/h/a/Special%7EWhatlinkshere_Ireland_e5f2.html" title="Special:Whatlinkshere/Ireland">Good luck!</a> &#160;:-D <a href="../../../j/h/o/User%7EJhonan_8210.html" title="User:Jhonan">Jhonan</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/h/o/User_talk%7EJhonan_c75b.html" title="User talk:Jhonan">talk</a></sup> 11:14, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Ben, really, changing <b>Ireland</b> to <i>Republic of Ireland</i> is somehow a bit misconceived. It would actually be more correct for an editor to change every instance of <b>Northern Ireland</b> to <i>United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland</i>. It really is a purposeless exercise changing the designation of the towns in Co Wicklow, as stated above in that the official name of the sovereign state is Ireland.

<dl>
<dd>Okay what properly needs to be done then is the town pages need to direct to the <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republic_of_Ireland_10e7.html" title="Republic of Ireland">Republic of Ireland</a> page and not the <a href="../../../i/r/e/Ireland.html" title="Ireland">Ireland</a> page as they do not. As it currently stands they are being directed to the wrong page, an article on the island of Ireland rather than on a state of Ireland. As I've stated above I have no intention of going around and altering them all anyway, I just changed a few that I came across. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBen_W_Bell_a229.html" title="User:Ben W Bell">Ben W Bell</a> 07:19, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I edited the Shadowrun page and you reverted my changes for the material below.</p>
<p>"Some players saw Fourth Edition as another opportunity to bring in Earthdawn races such as Obsidiman, T’skrang and Windling that had not been in Shadowrun. This did not occur."</p>
<p>I checked your user page and you are obviously a Wikipedia veteran. Thank you for your service on this great project. I on the other hand am brand new at editing Wikipedia. I think your revert on my changes was valid. My question to you now is this - could this material go somewhere on the discussion page or is there anywhere in Wikipedia to enter this material?

<dd>Welcome to Wikipedia, we hope you have a good and productive stay. As for your comment, I'm not sure about that. Personally as a 17 year Shadowrun veteran I've never heard of this even remotely being touted as happening. Yes some players may have discussed this possibility but as far as I can see this was just pure conjecture on the part of those players as I can find nothing from FanPro that would even remotely suggest such a thing as possibly happening. As a result it really doesn't have a place on Wikipedia unfortunately. If FanPro had mentioned it and then changed their minds then yes it would be mentioned in the trivia section, but I don't believe they did. It would have been silly and upsetting to introduce such pivotal Earthdawn races into the Shadowrun world anyway and would have destroyed their consistency and integrity of the background to have done so, in my opinion. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBen_W_Bell_a229.html" title="User:Ben W Bell">Ben W Bell</a> 05:59, 27 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>This was a topic of discussion at the 2005 FanPro Gamer Greet and Meet at GenCon in Indianapolis, Indiana, US. Some players expected that Obsidiman, T’skrang and Windlings would be brought in primarily because Minotaurs were presented as a new playable race in the Paranormal Critters sourcebook. Well, anyway, there are still some stubs on the Shadowrun page so perhaps I will focus on fleshing those out (move on to surer ground). Thank you very much for your help.</p>

<p>Ben, you're probably checking your RfA as often as your talk, but I just wanted to tell you that not having being set up to receive email has earned you one oppose vote. I'd suggest you do so, as this has hurt at least one other RfA before. Also, though this is just my opinion, it helps to have it clearly visible at the top of your user page or user talk.

<p>Hello, Looking at your article for Felbrigg Hall I believe you may have the wrong photo attached. I notice that the pic is your own and labelled Felbrigg Hall near Cromer, Norfolk but I'm pretty sure that the picture is of Blickling Hall, near Aylsham, Norfolk. I could be wrong and the two places could be very similar in appearance. I've not been to Felbrigg but have been to Blickling a couple times and have a photo that looks remarkably similar taken from the same aspect. In addition thank you for starting the Helijet page.

<p>I note you removed the link I inserted earlier today. I am not quite sure why. The link was to a case study on a business process project that was implemented worldwide and has won numerous awards. In addition, it provides a fair amount of detail on the methodology for mapping, documenting, implementing and auditing business processes.</p>
<p>I do not have time to enter in to endless correspondence on this subject, but I am concerned about indiscrimate deleting of a valid information source relevant to the identified topic.</p>
<p>Ben - thanks for pointing me to the spam section. Having read it I noted the following: - 'Contribute cited text, not bare links. Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, not a link farm. If you have a source to contribute, first contribute some facts that you learned from that source, then cite the source. Don't simply direct readers to another site for the useful facts; add useful facts to the article, then cite the site where you found them. You're here to improve Wikipedia -- not just to funnel readers off Wikipedia and onto some other site, right? (If not, see #1 above.)' The case study I linked to is relevant. I shall therefore include text from it and link to it as the source <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Hughch (<a href="../../../h/u/g/User_talk%7EHughch_8d28.html" title="User talk:Hughch">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Hughch_9311.html" title="Special:Contributions/Hughch">contribs</a>) 13:58, 9 June, 2006 (UTC).</small></p>

<dd>Hi. No I didn't deliberately block you, just an IP address that was vandalising. Are you still having problems editting? You seem to be a user in good standing so there is no reason you would be blocked. If you are having issues I'll lift the block and just deal with the vandal as and when he does something.

<p>Hello, I've noticed that somebody creats different kinds of templates such as <i>This user was born in 1960</i> that's for example. But some Templates usually deleted from someone's disagreement like Someone who doesn't want to keep this kinds of template in Wikipedia. I personally want to create the template like Who is interested in Chemistry. That's what I've decided to create this template <i>Chemistry</i>. But, I don't know that <i>Chemistry</i> template is already existed or not. So, Could you explain to me about Template, and what kinds of Template would not be allowed in wikipedia in my discussion page? Please, Answer in my talk page. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel5127_dec3.html" title="User:Daniel5127">*~Daniel~*</a> 02:50, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>To be honest I've never created a template here (I think) and definitely not a userbox one, which is what I think you are after. Have a look on the page <a href="../../../u/s/e/WP%7EUserboxes_7354.html" title="WP:Userboxes">WP:Userboxes</a> to see if there is a template for chemistry as I think there may well be one, otherwise links through and from that page should give you the information you need.

<p>Ben, you really should get a robot to do your edits as ~70% seem to be to replace Derry with Londonderry&#160;:-) Personally, I don't really care what its called but IMHO where the principle author has gone to the bother of adding something useful to WP you might find your own intellect better served by expanding the article.

<dd>Nah I've just done a load of them today. Been meaning to get round to it for a long time. Wikipedia policy is to use Londonderry for the county (as there has never actually been a County Derry) and Derry for the city (which is fine by me as they've renamed themselves that. Actually most of the ones I've changed have been changed to County Derry by other users so really I'm just setting them back. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBen_W_Bell_a229.html" title="User:Ben W Bell"><font color="blue"><b>Ben W Bell</b></font></a> <a href="../../../b/e/n/User_talk%7EBen_W_Bell_4407.html" title="User talk:Ben W Bell"><i><font color="blue">talk</font></i></a> 16:07, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Been wondering myself, how do you manage to find and change them so fast? I noticed that you changed the link in the Lavey article I created, within a short while of me creating it, even though it wasn't in any signifigant grouping. I'm not really sure why you changed it, as it just linked to the same article, but I see you want to inforce the official policies, so fair play to you. <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPauric_ee97.html" title="User:Pauric">Pauric</a> 17:38, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Ah that one is really easy. I just monitor the page County Derry and regularly check what happens to link to it using the WHat Links Here link on the left hand side of the screen.&#160;:) <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBen_W_Bell_a229.html" title="User:Ben W Bell"><font color="blue"><b>Ben W Bell</b></font></a> <a href="../../../b/e/n/User_talk%7EBen_W_Bell_4407.html" title="User talk:Ben W Bell"><i><font color="blue">talk</font></i></a> 18:06, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Ah, handy enough. Same with <a href="../../../d/e/r/Derry.html" title="Derry">Derry</a> then? Clever way of doing it I hadn't thought of. <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPauric_ee97.html" title="User:Pauric">Pauric</a> 18:08, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yup same with Londonderry, I check to see what is linking here and if it is a usage of the City name in certain periods I change it to Derry as per the standards. It's actually fair, one is considered by some to be pro-Unionist, and one change pro-Nationalist and I'm always accused of being one or the other just for following policy. County Derry is always easy as there's never been a County Derry, but with Londonderry it is valid in certain time periods. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBen_W_Bell_a229.html" title="User:Ben W Bell"><font color="blue"><b>Ben W Bell</b></font></a> <a href="../../../b/e/n/User_talk%7EBen_W_Bell_4407.html" title="User talk:Ben W Bell"><i><font color="blue">talk</font></i></a> 18:15, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That's not a problem. I just noticed it on a recent changes patrol. Vandalism is vandalism whether it's to an article or a user page. In fact I consider vandalism to use pages to be more of a crime than vandalism to an article as it's practically a personal attack. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBen_W_Bell_a229.html" title="User:Ben W Bell"><font color="blue"><b>Ben W Bell</b></font></a> <a href="../../../b/e/n/User_talk%7EBen_W_Bell_4407.html" title="User talk:Ben W Bell"><i><font color="blue">talk</font></i></a> 06:23, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You changed my Littlechlid edit. I gave hard facts about the Irish and you rubbed them out. Are you anti-Irish? If you change my neutral edit I attempt to have you removed for anti-Irish bigotry. 617USA</p>

<dd>No I am not anti-Irish, being Irish that would be really stupid. If you are going to throw around accusations that he was a homophobe, dead set against the Irish and other such then you need to back it up with sources and references or they will be removed.

<p>It doesn't matter of you are Irish -- you could be a Protestant or a Catholic sell out. You are not neutral and your edit has no encyclodic value. I am changing it back and will call for an edit dispute if you change it again. The facts I gave are true -- Littlechild was an oprressor. I see you live in England anyway so you are a sell out.</p>

<p>If you were a Catholic you never would have said you were from the 'United Kingdom" -- you would have said Ireland. I am filing a complaint against you as a bias bigot.</p>
<p>Um Northern Ireland was part of the United Kingdom last I checked, a fact no matter if I'm Catholic, Protestant, Jewish, Muslim or any other religion. And are you trying to threaten me for some reason? None of your edits are neutral I'm afraid and you do not provide references. In fact your edits are made with a personal axe to grind against the British police establishment for reasons I cannot fathom why. That is why they are being removed, not because anyone is a bigot, not because anyone else is biased. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBen_W_Bell_a229.html" title="User:Ben W Bell"><font color="blue"><b>Ben W Bell</b></font></a> <a href="../../../b/e/n/User_talk%7EBen_W_Bell_4407.html" title="User talk:Ben W Bell"><i><font color="blue">talk</font></i></a> 20:53, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I will no longer respond after this post -- I am reporting you to Wikipedia and several Irish Catholic rights groups. I checked and you and the Old Bill who put up the Irish cop articles have ganged up on editors before. I will also call in other Wikipedia editors -- who are YOU to say what's neutral -- neutrally is decided by the group here -- not by you and your cop friend.</p>
<p>I'm all for Catholic rights, as I'm all for Protestant rights, and every other groups rights. If you wish to continue through life blinkered into your own little worldview then go right on ahead. Quite frankly coming from Northern Ireland where large proportions of the population (Catholic and Protestant) are incapable of having senesible discussions because both sides are blinded by their own ignorance and confused ideologies I just can't be doing with it. If you wish to join a world where people are more interested in building and making things better then come back and talk, if not then please don't bother us. Oh and if you want to file a complaint with someone on Wikipedia then go right on ahead.

<p>Thank you Ben for the kind words on the above photograph. Indeed the framing of the clouds was very interesting, but purely good fortune rather than talent. At an average take-off speed of 120 knots, photographing aircraft is a hit and miss sport.</p>
<p>If I may add my appreciation for your tireless work on Wikipedia, especially in the field of Country awareness. I am in hopes that with my vast photographic database that I will be able to augment the textual portion of an article - with an accompanying photograph.

<p>I've received your message saying: "Please stop removing valid links from Wikipedia".</p>
<p>I've removed only some links to "pinouts.ru" because a large part of this site has been copied without permission from the original and historical "technick.net" website now called "allpinouts.com". They are only replicating the content of Allpinouts.com website and probably reproducing copyrighted material without permission. The pinouts collection of Technick.net/Allpinouts.com was started on 1991, moved to BBS on 1994 and to internet on 1998. Pinouts.ru was born after 2000.</p>
<p>We no not have enough resources to move a legal action against Pinouts.ru because they are based in Russia and we are in Italy, so I'm asking to Wikipedia at least to not link this site.</p>
<p>All links to "allpinouts.com" are right because a lot of information about cables/connectors/adapters on the internet has been acquired from this site.</p>
<p>Please give me some feedbak about this issue.</p>

<p>Yes, I'm sure&#160;:-) KN has used Mlle. Dieudonné in three different continuities: Drachenfels and the other Warhammer novels (Genevieve Sandrine du Pointe du Lac Dieudonné), the Anno-Dracula series (Geneviève Sandrine de l'Isle Dieudonné), and <i>Seven Stars</i> (Geneviève Sandrine Ysolde Dieudonné, who also shows up in the short story 'The Big Fish'). The different continuities are distinguished by the middle names and an accent in the first name, but he's stated that they're basically the same character in different worlds.</p>
<p><i>Seven Stars</i> also pinches a few other characters from the AD series, and even from the Dark Future novels that he also wrote for GW.

But as to my statement that before he was captured the SAS destroyed such and such amount of grounded aircraft and various other enemy vehicles and the like (I can't remember the numbers right now), my reference for that is the Ballatine book "<i>The Phantom Major</i>", also published under the title of "<i>Who dares, wins</i>". It was written during David Stirling's lifetime and in direct correspondance with the afore mentioned and other members of the SAS in WWII. There is similar information on the SAS site.

<p>In regards to Mike Carrol article: Ben, where do you get off accusing me of vandalism when you haven't addressed any of what I said? Mike Carrol was beat up by angry French bouncers, and this was a significant event that he explained in detail in an interview with Skateboarder Mag. Also, the advertisement he appeared in does exist and although you may disagree as to the message behind the add, the proper recourse is not to delete it and accuse the contributor of vandalism. It is also common knowledge that early in his career, Carrol was given the chance to vote on whether or not Eric Koston should be offered a spot on the Plan B skateboard team. This event was referenced by Danny Way in an issue of Transworld Skateboarding magazine several years ago. Furthermore, in an issue of Big Brother Magazine two years ago, Mike Carrol openly ridiculed Chris Nieratko during his interview. If you doubt the accuracy, lets discuss it before you accuse somebody of vandalism. You're not in your element here, or else you probably could have backed up your claims with at least something. Maybe you hold a lot of water at Star Trek conventions and can speak flawless Clingon, but keep the snobbery limited to your own circles please.

<p>If you think my changes inappropriate, then by all means revert them. I'm not inclined to argue over wikipedia. My intent wasn't to self-promote (our project being listed on the official game's site, as well as a small, paid Google Adwords campaign accomplish that), but to inform.</p>
<p>If you like, you can remove my additions and I will add them back once Neverwinter Nights 2 is released.</p>
<p>Though to be perfectly honest, despite its small size our project stands to fare considerably well in comparison to larger projects given that Dane and I both have considerable project management experience.</p>

<p>I know you're more of an <a href="../../../e/d/i/Editing.html" title="Editing">editor</a> as opposed to a <a href="../../../w/r/i/Writer.html" title="Writer">writer</a> on Wikipedia Ben, but actually with that in mind, I wonder if you could take a look at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Belfast_f319.html" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Belfast">Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Belfast</a>.. which is a summary intent regarding the new Belfast project I've set up.</p>
<p>I think you'd be an invaluable addition, and we can improve a wealth of things.. even if you just do the odd bit of work on it here and there. Once you've done a couple it gets easier of course. I'm sure you know the score. Plus, you've always appeared (to me at least) to be specifically non-POV.</p>
<p>Speaking of which - thanks for the warning regarding the <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northern_Ireland_a52b.html" title="Northern Ireland">Northern Ireland</a> article. I can't believe how insistant and petty those three or four people are. I've been accused of racism, anti-Irishness(!) and even of being a <i>loyalist</i> by a couple of them! My approach is purely from a logical perspective - the other three regions of the UK are known as constituent countries, so what is it about Northern Ireland that is different in this regard, I wonder.</p>
<p>I think from the edit history I remember seeing that it was you who changed the wording in the first place, in effort to compromise (I could be wrong). I respect that, though I still think the wording should be consistant throughout the other related articles.</p>
<p>I have been asked for citations and I provided many, and it was still reverted. I outlined my reasons for reverting, and still they talk about citations and verifying etc. I believe Djegan is trying to get me banned from Wikipedia. I note that on the 3RR page he claims that I wasn't blocked. But actually I was - for 12 hours, as I'm sure you're aware. I reckon by "blocked" Djegan actually means "banned".</p>
<p>Anyway, I have something else in mind for the next time the article gets reverted.</p>
<p>Thanks again, and please consider helping out with the Belfast project.&#160;:) --<a href="../../../s/e/t/User%7ESetanta747_5845.html" title="User:Setanta747">Mal</a> 15:51, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks for reminding but one more revert from other side too would violate 3RR.It just doesn't matter who is the person doing it.Have an eye there.<a href="../../../h/o/l/User%7EHolywarrior_ee67.html" title="User:Holywarrior"><font style="background:black" color="white">HW</font></a> 13:40, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No 3RR has been committed here.HW has been consistently defying consensus in the article's talk page and threatening users with bogus defwarns and bogus accusations of vandalism (please see edit history of <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kancha_Ilaiah_e7d5.html" title="Kancha Ilaiah">Kancha Ilaiah</a>) in order to frighten users away. There must be a wikipedia policy against such attacks. All the edits we made there are sourced and accurate. HW keeps reverting them despite our sourced verifications. If he wants to, he can qualify the edits with his own SOURCED edits and that would be fine. He, however, continues to delete sourced statements.<a href="../../../h/k/e/User%7EHkelkar_b268.html" title="User:Hkelkar">Hkelkar</a> 15:40, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Ben. You might want to take note of the changes I'll be making to the NI Project. I'm adding the <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMathbot_604f.html" title="User:Mathbot">Mathbot</a> functionality to the project a la the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Belfast_f089.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Belfast">Belfast Project</a>.</p>
<p>I aim to catalogue the work that needs done, and any issues (POV, accuracy, short-but-important articles, articles needing images etc etc), and the ultimate goal is to provide a collaborative project which will provide a list of resources and information with the aim of improving the vast majority of articles which relate to Northern Ireland.</p>
<p>If you have any time, please familiarize yourself with the suggestions given in the project, such as the addition to a list of new articles etc.</p>
<p>I'm starting a NI-related Manual of Style too in the near future.</p>

<dd>I am also grateful for your mediation. Although HW still disagrees with the result, I'm sure he means nobody any ill-will, despite the agitated nature of his postings. I'm sure that his misguided passion got the better of him. Maybe if he cools off and introspects for some time he will agree that your decision was neutral and unbiased and even suggested a reasonable compromise between our respective proposed edits.<a href="../../../h/k/e/User%7EHkelkar_b268.html" title="User:Hkelkar">Hkelkar</a> 18:23, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESqueakBox_f62d.html" title="User:SqueakBox">User:SqueakBox</a> doesn't like me. He has insulted me in the past and, recently, he was blocked for posting the following insult in his <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESqueakBox_f62d.html" title="User:SqueakBox">user page</a>: "My greatest achievements here [...] have been [...] and restoring José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero from the POV of another user who claims to write about saints." (See the entry for August 21 in his <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:SqueakBox" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:SqueakBox" rel="nofollow">block log</a>) My nick, Hagiographer means just that, "to write about saints", so it's clear that comment is a direct attack against me. Furthermore, when I came to the article about Zapatero SqueakBox had already been banned from editing Zapatero's editing articles by the Arbitraton Committee (what can he restore?). And, in fact, I've never contributed or deleted information from any of those articles. I simply reverted some vandalism SqueakBox introduced as part of his harassment campaing against other user who was also banned by the same Arbitration Comittee decision. So, that paragraph is pure slander.</p>
<p>Taking <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a> into account, I believe that paragraph should be deleted or, at least, marked like what it is, a personal attack. I did just that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3ASqueakBox&amp;diff=71121865&amp;oldid=71011996here" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3ASqueakBox&amp;diff=71121865&amp;oldid=71011996here" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>. However, SqueakBox removed it and <a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuettarda_9de6.html" title="User:Guettarda">User:Guettarda</a> protected the page <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3ASqueakBox&amp;diff=71242385&amp;oldid=71181172" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3ASqueakBox&amp;diff=71242385&amp;oldid=71181172" rel="nofollow">here</a>. SqueakBox has had a lot of problems with other users and, sometimes, Guettarda has taken part in them. For example, in <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESqueakBox_f62d.html" title="User:SqueakBox">User:SqueakBox</a> can be found a barnstar given by <a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuettarda_9de6.html" title="User:Guettarda">User:Guettarda</a> in which he says that SqueakBox has gone beyond the call of duty in his fight against "strange" people in the article <a href="../../../j/a/v/Javier_Solana_a15f.html" title="Javier Solana">Javier Solana</a>. <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a> states clearly that comments must be about content not users so it's clear that Guettarda and SqueakBox have cooperated in, at least, dubious actions against other users. It's also clear Guettarda is biased in favor of SqueakBox. In this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AHagiographer&amp;diff=73033267&amp;oldid=73007896" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AHagiographer&amp;diff=73033267&amp;oldid=73007896" rel="nofollow">edit</a> in my talk page, he implies that I like looking for conflict, that I'm obsessed with SqueakBox that I've to settle down and so on, all violation of <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> and unpleasant remarks.</p>
<p>It mustn't be forgotten that according to <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">WP:OWN</a>, user pages belong to everybody and I don't believe a wikipedian has any right to transform his user page in a platform to attack other users. So Guettarda's supposed protection of SqueakBox's user page (really of SqueakBox's insults) is very difficult to defend in my opinion.</p>
<p>I'm simply asking fair treatment. I don't believe I have to see how the Wikipedia is populated with insults against me. I believe SqueakBox can contribute useful edits without transforming his user page into a gallery of attacks. So please, either unprotect the page so <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">WP:OWN</a> can be applied, or remove the negative comment or mark it as a personal attack untolerable in the Wikipedia or, at least, explain to me why I have to bear that kind of treatment. SqueakBox has been blocked for that unpleasant remark, What is the use of blocking him and then keeping the insult?

<p>Hey there, I saw you removed the template I had stuck on the Derry page. Just want to get your thoughts on this one. Some of the cities in Ireland have the city template and others have this AND the county template. Probably should be consistency here. I had thought that it did make sense to have both on the Derry page, given the IMOS standards for the city being Derry and the county being Londonderry, I thought both templates on the Derry city article made sense and helped with clarity. Whats your thoughts? Cheers. <a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESeanMack_83e5.html" title="User:SeanMack">SeanMack</a> 06:38, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Okay my thoughts. There are in fact a few cities listed on the Counties template, but I believe they are only ones where the county town is the same name as the county (Galway, Cork, Limerick), though if that's the case I'm not sure why Antrim and Armagh don't have cities against them. To my mind the counties should be solely for counties (and I think this is why it was originally conceived), and the cities for cities. Mixing them just doesn't make any sense to me and ends up cluttering pages. But these are my thoughts, and don't necessarily represent policy or consensus (if there is one). <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBen_W_Bell_a229.html" title="User:Ben W Bell"><font color="blue"><b>Ben W Bell</b></font></a> <a href="../../../b/e/n/User_talk%7EBen_W_Bell_4407.html" title="User talk:Ben W Bell"><i><font color="blue">talk</font></i></a> 06:42, 6 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Thats fair enough - I was going to add it to those city articles with the same name as the county - which would have left Derry as a funny one - but I think I'll leave well enough alone for now....

<p>Hi, I saw your vandalism warning message and was completely perplexed... what had I done? Then I finally found that you kept restoring my own 'akaase' user page that I, myself, kept deleting. But I was deleting it whilst not being logged in, so it appeared as though an anonymous user was deleting my user page.</p>

<dd>Ben, thanks for the positive intervention. Setanta747 just kept on reverting my Craic page inputs and a bit of frustration crept in. It took me about 3 days to collect together the instances of the word craic as used in Ireland. I have no desire for a feud, as most of my edits are simple in context, and informative. I have about 500 edits using my ip address, as I don't always log in for once off edits. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERed_blaze_f940.html" title="User:Red blaze">Red blaze</a> 14:21, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>My change was reverted with the following comment: "rv back to opening titles logo as is standard on Wikipedia."</p>
<p>Although it's generally standard to use the logo from the title sequence, I don't feel as though the animated logo translates very well into a still image. The image from the DVD cover seems as though it would be what Whedon would have used had the logo been a still shot.</p>
<p>Maybe we could even use an animated logo. I just don't feel as if the still shot of an animated logo works very well.</p>
