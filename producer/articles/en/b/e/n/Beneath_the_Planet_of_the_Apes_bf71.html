Brent.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The scene switches to the desolation of the Forbidden Zone, where a <a href="../../../i/c/a/Icarus_%28fictional_spacecraft%29.html" title="Icarus (fictional spacecraft)">spacecraft</a> lies, engines and landing gear destroyed by fire as a result of an apparent <a href="../../../c/r/a/Crash_landing.html" title="Crash landing">crash landing</a>. One of the ship's two survivors, an astronaut named <a href="../../../b/r/e/Brent_%28Planet_of_the_Apes%29_5d42.html" title="Brent (Planet of the Apes)">Brent</a>, emerges from the hatch.</p>
<p>"I took an Earth-time reading just before re-entry," he tells his badly wounded Skipper. "Three-Niner-Five-Five... A.D." The stunned Skipper grieves in the realization that everyone he ever knew -- including his wife and daughters -- are dead, before dying from his injuries, leaving Brent all alone. After he finishes burying Skipper, Brent hears the sound of an approaching horse. He takes cover in the wreckage of his ship, gripping the shovel he used to bury Skipper as a weapon. Over the rise of a nearby dune, a woman on horseback appears.</p>
<p>Brent tries to speak to the woman, but quickly comes to the realization that she is apparently mute. She is also clearly frightened, so Brent drops the shovel to show her he means no harm. He then notices that she is wearing a metal <a href="../../../d/o/g/Dog_tags.html" title="Dog tags">I.D.</a> tag and reads it believing it would show her name; instead, he discovers that it belongs to Taylor, the man he was sent to find. Realizing that he may still be alive, Brent mounts the horse behind her saying “Take me to Taylor.”</p>
<p>Brent and the woman soon ride out of the desert into the greener, cultivated area outside of Ape City. They dismount and crawl through bushes until they are overlooking a crowded amphitheater, and hear the cheering of a crowd. When he sees the crowd, Brent is horrified: “It’s a city of apes!”</p>
<p>Addressing the crowd is <a href="../../../g/e/n/General_Ursus_%28Planet_of_the_Apes%29_922f.html" title="General Ursus (Planet of the Apes)">General Ursus</a> (<a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Gregory_%28actor%29_a094.html" title="James Gregory (actor)">James Gregory</a>), leader of the Ape Army: “I’ll tell you one thing that every good soldier knows. The only thing that counts in the end is power! Naked, merciless force!”; The gorillas cheer as their leader calls for the total extermination of all humans. The orangutans and chimpanzees in the crowd are silent and clearly do not agree.</p>
<p>Ursus continues, justifying his position with their religion, pointing to the statue at the top of the amphitheater: “Our great Lawgiver tells us that never will the human have the Apes’ divine faculty for being able to distinguish between Evil and Good. The only good human is a dead human!”; Ursus wants the Apes to invade the Forbidden Zone, conquer it, and use it as a potential food source -- he wins the support of the Apes for his invasion plans. Brent wants to leave immediately, but he is wounded by a patrolling gorilla trooper.</p>
<p>Later, while taking a <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steam_bath.html" title="Steam bath">steam bath</a>, Dr. Zaius discusses the impending invasion with General Ursus. Zaius has misgivings about the undertaking of seeking a fight with a totally unknown and potentially dangerous enemy. But Ursus is convinced that the threat of an impending famine makes his decision necessary -- if something lives in the Forbidden Zone, then they must eat: “We invade or we starve. It’s as simple as that.”</p>
<p>Cornelius and <a href="../../../z/i/r/Zira_%28Planet_of_the_Apes%29_0430.html" title="Zira (Planet of the Apes)">Zira</a> return home to find two humans waiting for them. At the sight of the woman, Zira proclaims “Nova!”, thus Brent learns her name. Seeing him, she asks uncertainly “Taylor?” and is shocked when the man answers “No, my name is Brent.” Brent tells them he is searching for Taylor and asks for their help. Cornelius shows him a map of the area as Zira treats Brent’s gunshot wound: “Among other things, I happen to be a trained Vet,” she comments.</p>
<p>They are interrupted by the arrival of Dr. Zaius. Brent and Nova hide as the Minister of Science enters. Zaius had protected them from the charges of heresy and treason months before, but now scolds Zira for her behavior during the meeting (she remained seated when everyone else stood in applause). He informs them that he will be joining Ursus on the invasion of the Forbidden Zone. While he is away, he asks for reassurances that they will stay out of trouble.</p>
<p>Brent and Nova quickly leave Ape City, but are immediately spotted by a gorilla patrol and are captured. They are loaded into a wagon cage and taken back, passing squads of gorilla soldiers going through military exercises using humans for targets. When they arrive at the compound, they are spotted by Zira. Pretending scientific interest, she attempts to secure them in the zoological area, but is stopped by Ursus: “You can’t have them! They’re marked for target practice,” he tells her. As they are loaded back into the wagon, Zira pretends to lock the door but in reality unlocks it, enabling Brent and Nova to escape from their captors.</p>
<p>Pursued by the gorillas, they hide in an unnatural looking cave, where the walls are covered in tiles and the middle is supported by a row of steel <a href="../../../i/-/b/I-beam.html" title="I-beam">I-beams</a>. Seeing the words “<a href="../../../q/u/e/Queensboro_Plaza_%28New_York_City_Subway%29_206e.html" title="Queensboro Plaza (New York City Subway)">Queensboro Plaza</a>” written on the tiles, Brent recognizes that the cavern is a <a href="../../../s/u/b/Subway_station.html" title="Subway station">subway station</a>; he is not on a strange and unexplored planet orbiting some distant star, but back on Earth two millennia after his mission into space was launched. Overwrought, he wonders aloud what could have happened to destroy the world he knew.</p>
<p>With the gorillas still outside searching for them, Brent and Nova go deeper into the ruined subway tunnels. Hearing a strange, mechanical, humming sound, they follow it through an airshaft into the ruins of Manhattan Island. Separated from Nova, Brent enters the remains of <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Patrick%27s_Cathedral%2C_New_York_b6ec.html" title="St. Patrick's Cathedral, New York">St. Patrick's Cathedral</a>, and finds a person inside, kneeling before the high altar. However, the object of worship fills him with horror - an intact <a href="../../../n/u/c/Nuclear_weapon.html" title="Nuclear weapon">nuclear</a> <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intercontinental_ballistic_missile.html" title="Intercontinental ballistic missile">intercontinental ballistic missile</a>.</p>

The unmasked mutants and their god.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The city rulers interrogate Brent in the ruins of Grand Central Terminal. He replies to telepathic queries, suffering a barrage of thoughts from them when they learn that he escaped from Ape City. When it is apparent that he can not handle their telepathic communication, their leader instructs them to verbal questioning. Brent confirms their worst fears; “The Apes are marching on your city!”</p>
<p>Other than their “Divine Bomb”, the mutants’ only defenses are telepathic illusions. In the Forbidden Zone, the ape army comes upon a horrible sight, their gorilla scouts <a href="../../../c/r/u/Crucified.html" title="Crucified">crucified</a> on inverted crosses, engulfed in flames. Ursus is outraged and then frightened, as a monolithic statue of their Lawgiver appears over them and begins to bleed. Instead of instilling fear, Zaius is incensed at what he sees: "This is a vision and it is a lie!," he declares as he charges into the flames. Unharmed, he goes up to the base of the statue just as it falls. He braces for the crash, but the illusion vanishes. He declares, "The vision was false!" Ursus orders the army to continue their advance.</p>
<p>With the failure of their illusion to dissuade the apes, the mutants have no choice but to prepare to detonate the “Divine Bomb.” The mutants hold a worship service in the cathedral, Brent and Nova are given robes to wear and attend. The congregation sings a corrupted version of the <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglican.html" title="Anglican">Anglican</a> <a href="../../../h/y/m/Hymn.html" title="Hymn">hymn</a> “<a href="../../../a/l/l/All_Things_Bright_and_Beautiful_d295.html" title="All Things Bright and Beautiful">All Things Bright and Beautiful</a>”, praising “the Bomb Almighty,” and in unison removes masks which had concealed their true appearance. Exposed to centuries of radioactive fallout, the mutants are skinless and horribly scarred; only in the presence of their horrible god do they reveal their “inmost selves.”</p>
<p>Afterward, Brent is separated from Nova and put in a jail cell with Taylor: “We don’t kill our enemies,” the mutant says; “we get our enemies to kill each other.” Under his telepathic control, Taylor and Brent fight against each other. Hearing the sound of the fighting, Nova escapes her guard and runs to the cell. She is confronted by a sight that fills her with horror, her friend and the man she loves trying to kill each other. Overwrought, she cries out “Tay-lor!” The sound of her voice breaks the mutant’s concentration, freeing Brent and Taylor from his control and they kill him.</p>
<p>Outside, the apes have come within sight of the ruins of <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_City_1428.html" title="New York City">New York City</a>. Zaius sees a cave opening that leads to the underground community. Ursus commands his troops to dismount and advance into the tunnels and begin killing the mutants on sight. As the killing begins, Taylor and Brent try to break out of their cell. When they succeed, they are stopped by a gorilla trooper that kills Nova before he is subdued.</p>

<p>Using a <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battering_ram.html" title="Battering ram">battering ram</a>, the apes force their way into St. Patrick’s Cathedral to be confronted be a lone human. As the missile rises into launch position he declares, “This is the instrument of my God!” Taylor and Brent arrive just in time to see the mutant leader gunned down by the gorillas before he can fire the weapon. From the Greek letters "ΑΩ" (Alpha and Omega) on one of the missile’s tailfins, Taylor realizes that this weapon is the "<a href="../../../d/o/o/Doomsday_device.html" title="Doomsday device">doomsday bomb</a>". If it is launched, it will destroy the entire planet.</p>
<p>Ursus orders his troops to pull down the bomb with ropes. As the bomb falls, it breaks open and begins venting fuel. Ursus goes over to the controls; believing he can stop the venting, he moves to push the detonator switch. Seeing this, Brent pounds on the keys of the cathedral’s pipe organ to distract the gorilla general and begins shooting. Zaius spots Taylor on the other side of the room, and Ursus shoots him.</p>
<p>Seeing this, Brent goes into a rage coming out into the open and starts killing gorillas, beginning with Ursus himself. As this happens, Zaius confronts Taylor. The mortally wounded man pleads with Zaius for help. Zaius contemptuously refuses: "You ask me to help you?! Man is evil, capable of nothing but destruction!" With this remark, Brent's rifle empties and the gorillas kill him in a barrage of gunfire. Taylor dies, and his outstretched hand (extended in a last, futile plea for help) falls on the control switch that triggers the bomb, destroying the Earth itself. The film ends with a narration (spoken by veteran voice actor <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Frees_da5e.html" title="Paul Frees">Paul Frees</a>):</p>

<li><a href="../../../r/o/d/Roddy_McDowall_5bfd.html" title="Roddy McDowall">Roddy McDowall</a> was unable to reprise his role for this sequel (he was directing a movie overseas at the time).

The animated TV series, is the only original <i>Apes</i> project in which McDowall is not a part of.</li>
<li>Actor Natalie Trundy as well as McDowell are both credited with apearing in 4 of the 5 movies.</li>
<li>An early idea for the film involved a half human, half ape child. This idea ended up being scrapped, to avoid implications of <a href="../../../b/e/s/Bestiality.html" title="Bestiality">bestiality</a> and keep the film "Family Friendly". Rare test footage of the Ape/Human child can be seen in the "Behind the Planet of the Apes" documentary hosted by Roddy McDowall.</li>
<li>Charlton Heston showed little interest in reprising his role from the first movie. He agreed to appear for only a short stint of filming with the provision that his character be killed off at the movie's start, and also that his entire salary would be donated to charity. Instead, the producers chose to have Heston's character, Taylor, <i>disappear</i> at the start of the movie, and then be killed off at its end<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup>. This meant that Heston was given the key moment of the movie's conclusion.</li>
<li>Charlton Heston claimed that the idea for Taylor to destroy the world was his. He hoped that this would put an end to further sequels.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup></li>
<li>The novelization of the screenplay retained the original ending from the script. Ursus was not killed by Brent. Both he and Zaius are confronted by Taylor. As Taylor tries to reason with Zaius, Zaius condems him and Ursus repeatedly shoots Taylor with his pistol. Brent's rifle empties and the gorillas kill him. Ursus is horrified, as he tells Zaius that he has emptied the pistol's magazine into Taylor; he should be dead, but he still keeps going. Knowing he is dying, Taylor (after Dr. Zaius refuses to help him disarm the missile) decides the only way to stop the violence is by detonating the bomb. This he does, destroying the Earth itself.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup></li>
<li>This movie mentions the "Hasslein Curve", a rift in time that sent both Taylor and Brent's ships back to Earth, far in its future. This is the second reference to <a href="../../../d/r/2E/Dr._Hasslein_%28Planet_of_the_Apes%29_1115.html" title="Dr. Hasslein (Planet of the Apes)">Dr. Otto Hasslein</a>, who appears in the next sequel, <i><a href="../../../e/s/c/Escape_from_the_Planet_of_the_Apes_bb42.html" title="Escape from the Planet of the Apes">Escape from the Planet of the Apes</a></i>.</li>

"No. No, I don't know how to get back. We came through a defect in, uh, space and time. That's what must've happened to Skipper... I'm sure he tried to get back. That's why Skipper's dead, and, I'm alone."<br />
"Wait! Wait a minute! Stop it! I can't understand you! You're all screaming at me at the same time!... The pain and suffering!"<br />
"Are we to understand that you were in the City of the Apes?"<br />
"Yes."<br />
"What sights did you see?"<br />
"Certainly we can talk, it's a rather primitive accomplishment. We use it when we must. When we pray. When we sing to our God."<br />
"...Seeing how there an atomic bomb... is God?!"<br />
"You don't understand, Mr. Brent, the bomb is a holy weapon of the peace."<br /></p>
