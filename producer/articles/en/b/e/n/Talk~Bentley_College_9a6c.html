<p>added later: I think the below statement is rediculous. I have no association with bentley but I am from the Boston area where it is common knowledge that Bentley churns out accountants to businesses. I do not know much about the rets of the school but they are known for accounting and so massive delations of this fact are not nessesery.</p>
<p>I'm curious why the NPOV tag was placed on this article. It seems ok to me. <a href="../../../l/t/p/User%7ELtPowers_4e74.html" title="User:LtPowers">Powers</a> 14:27, 20 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>It reads a bit like a prospectus with lines such as "Bentley students are heavily recruited by the top accounting firms in the nation." I don't think that's acceptable without a decent citation, particularly using as vague a term as "heavily". Dancarney 13:36, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>A: Although a citation of which firms recruit with statistics backing that claim would be nice, it is a true. Bentley students, accounting and finance majors, are heavily recruited by top firms. For more info, visit Bentley's career services website or call the college for details. <small>—<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> 168.168.67.112 (<a href="../../../1/6/8/User_talk%7E168.168.67.112.html" title="User talk:168.168.67.112">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_168.168.67.112_badb.html" title="Special:Contributions/168.168.67.112">contribs</a>) .</small></p>
<p>168.168.67.112...you work at Mercer. Either you helped Bentley, and this is some sort of ad campaign, or you're actually speaking the truth.</p>
<p>I've deleted a load of stuff which ay be factually accurate, but is not relevant for an encyclopaedia entry. I altered the info in the sidebox to reflect the style of the entry for <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harvard.html" title="Harvard">Harvard</a>, which I thought would be a good guide. I think this article is now NPOV, but would like a 2nd opinion before removing tag. Dancarney 01:24, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Not sure that Bentley is a university yet. I understand it wants to become one, and that is why it has dropped the word "College" from its title in many places on web site, in literature, etc. It has launched its first one or two PhD programs, but I am not sure if that alone qualifies it to be regarded as a "university." Doesn't that require some sort of peer recognition or maybe certification from an education group? davidb0229</p>
<dl>
<dd>I second the vote for the removal of the NPOV tag. The article's been "sanitized" and it's absolutely NPOV, though in exchange it lost a lot of content. On the question of whether or not it's a university, in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University.html" title="University">University</a> definition of it, it's not a university as it despite granting doctoral degrees (quaternary education), the <a href="http://www.carnegiefoundation.org/classifications/" class="external text" title="http://www.carnegiefoundation.org/classifications/" rel="nofollow">Carnegie Classifications</a> do not classify Bentley as a university <i>yet</i>--<a href="../../../d/a/l/User%7EDalillama_84d2.html" title="User:Dalillama">Dali-Llama</a> 20:29, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Bentley has been a university for years. It is only now that Bentley is taking on the name university. Yes, I work for Mercer. I am an alumni. I do not do work for Bentley. I do not work on ad campaigns. I work within an investment consulting practice. <small>—<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> 168.168.67.112 (<a href="../../../1/6/8/User_talk%7E168.168.67.112.html" title="User talk:168.168.67.112">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_168.168.67.112_badb.html" title="Special:Contributions/168.168.67.112">contribs</a>) .</small></p>
<dl>
<dd>On Bentley's own website it makes no claim to be a University. For example: <i>"Bentley College is a business school. We do for students interested in business and related professions what the leading technological universities do for students of science and engineering."</i> <a href="http://www.bentley.edu/about/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bentley.edu/about/" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> That, to me, suggests that it is not a Uni.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Dancarney 18:19, 8 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>That's more related to its educational focus rather than its degree-granting classification. It's like saying <a href="../../../m/i/t/MIT_7abc.html" title="MIT">MIT</a> is an <i>engineering</i> school, not a university. It's two separate things. In any case, "business school" usually has an MBA connotation, which is not the only degree offered. --<a href="../../../d/a/l/User%7EDalillama_84d2.html" title="User:Dalillama">Dali-Llama</a> 15:30, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><br />
Bentley now has a PhD program, so a university classification is not far off.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>--</p>
<p>I work at Bentley and am an alumni of Bentley. The college is steps from university status and since that is a major change they've dropped the designator in prep for the change. There is no hard word on how far away the change will be but it must take place through the Mass Board of Higher Ed, and has not happened yet. Therefore it is a college, not a university.</p>
<p>As for the concerns regarding the truth of the statements present, I can't understand why the rankings were deleted in addition to everything else. They are easily verifiable and while the word "accolades" may have been inappropriate the rankings were not. This alone makes me wonder why the other material was deleted. The college widely disseminates these facts, including on it's own website (<a href="http://www.bentley.edu/about/facts.cfm" class="external free" title="http://www.bentley.edu/about/facts.cfm" rel="nofollow">http://www.bentley.edu/about/facts.cfm</a>). Hardvard's entry has them (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard#Views_of_Harvard" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard#Views_of_Harvard" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard#Views_of_Harvard</a>) as well, if that entry is being held as the standard.</p>
<p>Placement data is easily available from the Career Services site, including Placement Statistics for 2005 (<a href="http://ecampus.bentley.edu/dept/ocs/undergrad/Career%20Profiles%202005%20dist-%20UG%20Profile%206-months.pdf" class="external free" title="http://ecampus.bentley.edu/dept/ocs/undergrad/Career%20Profiles%202005%20dist-%20UG%20Profile%206-months.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://ecampus.bentley.edu/dept/ocs/undergrad/Career%20Profiles%202005%20dist-%20UG%20Profile%206-months.pdf</a>) and Sample employers for 2004 (<a href="http://ecampus.bentley.edu/dept/ocs/undergrad/sample_placements.html" class="external free" title="http://ecampus.bentley.edu/dept/ocs/undergrad/sample_placements.html" rel="nofollow">http://ecampus.bentley.edu/dept/ocs/undergrad/sample_placements.html</a>). I doubt they will ever publicly release statistics for particular employers since the employers would view that as a release of privileged information. A good majority of my peers went on to work for KPMG, Deloitte, Anderson, Ernst, and PWC. If the school's business focus is in any doubt, have a look at the degree reqs for CIS students (<a href="http://cis.bentley.edu/UGprograms/requirements.asp" class="external free" title="http://cis.bentley.edu/UGprograms/requirements.asp" rel="nofollow">http://cis.bentley.edu/UGprograms/requirements.asp</a>). *Everyone* has to take the business core classes, regardless of degree. That's what the school is known for. I'm a CIS grad and I can do my taxes while sleeping, and I'm not joking. People at this school readily volunteer to do them. I *like* doing them.</p>
<p>"83% hold doctoral degrees, Faculty-student ratio: 1 to 13" was deleted. Here (<a href="http://www.bentley.edu/academics_research/faculty_research/faculty_database/index.cfm" class="external free" title="http://www.bentley.edu/academics_research/faculty_research/faculty_database/index.cfm" rel="nofollow">http://www.bentley.edu/academics_research/faculty_research/faculty_database/index.cfm</a>) are the faculty profiles... no offense but I'll trust the 83% number rather than count through all of those profiles. Between the facts page and the profiles you should be able to put a ratio together as well. The numbers from the sidebar make the ratio closer to 1:12.3 though.</p>
<p>Why was the tuition data deleted? Hunt (<a href="http://www.bentley.edu/undergraduate/financial/index.cfm" class="external free" title="http://www.bentley.edu/undergraduate/financial/index.cfm" rel="nofollow">http://www.bentley.edu/undergraduate/financial/index.cfm</a>) around (<a href="http://www.bentley.edu/graduate/financial.cfm" class="external free" title="http://www.bentley.edu/graduate/financial.cfm" rel="nofollow">http://www.bentley.edu/graduate/financial.cfm</a>) for it. We don't hide it!</p>
<p>Why was "There are opportunities to be involved in academically oriented groups, the creative and performing arts, student government, campus newspapers and radio station, fraternity and sorority life." deleted when that list of orgs is right below it? If you don't believe it, the official list is here too (<a href="http://ecampus.bentley.edu/studentorgs/" class="external free" title="http://ecampus.bentley.edu/studentorgs/" rel="nofollow">http://ecampus.bentley.edu/studentorgs/</a>). If you have a question about them feel free to ask. As the {now former} EVP of SGA I helped 10 or 20 of them to official recognition.</p>
<p>The bus service was deleted? I'll give you the bits about Boston, although the students really do go in quite often partly to get to all of those internships (<a href="http://ecampus.bentley.edu/dept/ocs/undergrad/internship_program.html" class="external free" title="http://ecampus.bentley.edu/dept/ocs/undergrad/internship_program.html" rel="nofollow">http://ecampus.bentley.edu/dept/ocs/undergrad/internship_program.html</a>) at the accounting firms that LEAD to the jobs in question. Funny how that internship page has special instructions for the accounting applications, isn't it? Anyway, the bus service is called a shuttle, and here is the site (<a href="http://www.bentley.edu/student-life/shuttle_service.cfm" class="external free" title="http://www.bentley.edu/student-life/shuttle_service.cfm" rel="nofollow">http://www.bentley.edu/student-life/shuttle_service.cfm</a>). Go wild. I've been on it hundreds of times. It exists too. The college publicizes this because it is a few miles from Boston and they want to make the point that the students can still get to Boston quite easily.</p>
<p>While I can't cite anything in response to the deletion of "to accommodate growing enrollment and student demand for education blending academic study and extracurricular opportunities", it is a commonly understood reason. The Boylston street location was an office building and the school simply out grew it.</p>
<p>The distance from Boston is easy to get (<a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&amp;hl=en&amp;saddr=175+forest+st,+waltham,+ma&amp;daddr=boston,+ma" class="external free" title="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&amp;hl=en&amp;saddr=175+forest+st,+waltham,+ma&amp;daddr=boston,+ma" rel="nofollow">http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&amp;hl=en&amp;saddr=175+forest+st,+waltham,+ma&amp;daddr=boston,+ma</a>), as are the routes around it.</p>
<p>I understand there were concerns about the entry sounding like a prospectus but the degree of deletions borders on malice. I can't help but peruse our competitor's entries and note how much of the deleted material is on their entries as well. Please count this as a vote for returning to the 2/27 entry. Jwells 15:33, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I agree that the page should move back to the 2/27. The lack of information here, when compared to Bryant and others, is appalling.</p>
<p>Agreed - those who have no affiliation or true knowledge of the school other than what they read on the internet have no place in editing Bentley College's description. Get a life.</p>
<p>Please move back the page to the 2/27. Bentley College is a business university. The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching classifies the Bentley College as Master's Colleges and Universities (larger programs)(Please check the fact on <a href="http://www.carnegieclassification-preview.org/" class="external free" title="http://www.carnegieclassification-preview.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.carnegieclassification-preview.org/</a>). Also there is a former President's interview related to this issue. Please see <a href="http://ecampus.bentley.edu/bl/bl090501/university.html" class="external free" title="http://ecampus.bentley.edu/bl/bl090501/university.html" rel="nofollow">http://ecampus.bentley.edu/bl/bl090501/university.html</a>. Anyone who has a problem of this issue, please take a look at it. Also I would say that we could add information "facts about Bentley" on the website (<a href="http://www.bentley.edu/about/facts.cfm" class="external free" title="http://www.bentley.edu/about/facts.cfm" rel="nofollow">http://www.bentley.edu/about/facts.cfm</a>). If anybody would have a problem about any information on the website, she/he can contact the Bentley College.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Right now the only major difference between the 2/27 version and the current one is the rankings and accolades portion. You are absolutely free to reinsert that information (though please do not revert due to other changes, which include the infobox formatting), provided you cite your sources per the <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">NPOV</a> policy. If you can find the specific URL for the Carnegie Classification (I wasn't able to) then we can also settle the college/university debate while we're at it.--<a href="../../../d/a/l/User%7EDalillama_84d2.html" title="User:Dalillama">Dali-Llama</a> 18:33, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Try <a href="http://www.carnegieclassification-preview.org" class="external free" title="http://www.carnegieclassification-preview.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.carnegieclassification-preview.org</a> Please look up Bentley College. The rankings and accolades section is completely valid and there are numerous sources proving such. The fact that this great institution's name has been run through the mud on this website is appauling.
