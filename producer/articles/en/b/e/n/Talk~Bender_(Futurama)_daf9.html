<p>correct me if im wrong but i recall when the crew went back in time Dr. Zoidburg collcected all of benders pieces into a bag after he flew out of the windshield of the planet express ship; then the goverment captured them both and they took the bag and re-assembled the "alien space craft"(or something like that) using the contents of the bag containing bender. So i bealive his body and head age should be one in the same. 68.215.174.16 05:52, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Bender and Zoidberg were reclaimed by the Planet Express crew but immediately before they jumped back to the future Bender's head fell off the ship, his body remained on the ship and the head was retrieved again in the future. This is why the head is old and the body isn't. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStardust8212_f3e3.html" title="User:Stardust8212">Stardust8212</a> 20:06, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The catch phrases definitely rub me the wrong way. It just seems gratuitous, that's all. Do you really feel it adds value to the article, Infrogmation? Moreover, I've watched a lot of Futurama, and those aren't even his more common catch phrases - in fact, I don't think I've heard one of them on the show! So, really, I don't see why we're keeping it.

<p>In the main page there's some discrepency about the episode where all the crew regress to their childlike forms, with Bender regressing all the way to a CD-ROM and finally a manual, versus Bender's canonical construction on an assembly line. I am not sure how to make this distinction plain but I believe Bender regressed through the various stages of his design, rather than construction. Thus his RNA (Robotic Nucleaic Acid) encodes every phase in the design, or evolution, of his construction. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 204.69.182.1 (<a href="../../../2/0/4/User_talk%7E204.69.182.1.html" title="User talk:204.69.182.1">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_204.69.182.1_719c.html" title="Special:Contributions/204.69.182.1">contribs</a>) 16:41, 23 May 2006 (UTC).</small></p>

<p>Antiquing is not Bender's least-used word. It's actually “from the list of words [he] almost never” says. This list, at the end of episode 2ACV17 (“War is the H-Word”), also includes “thanks”, “sorry”, “funderful”, “non-alcoholic”, “compassion”, and “shrimp toast” (yes, I know that's technically two words, but that's what's in the episode), but the words are not given in any particular order, unlike the top 10 words, which are presented in a Letterman-like countdown.</p>
<p>I think the sentence “The word he uses least is antiqueing [sic].” at the end of the quotes section should either be modified to contain all the least-used words mentioned in that episode, or removed entirely. Since the words are not given in any particular order, I don't think it quite fits with the top 10 used words and should be deleted. Also note that “antiquing” was spelled wrong (there is no ‘e’). I have corrected the misspelling and will eventually remove the sentence entirely unless someone objects.</p>

A section of text says <i>"Bender has periodically stated a desire to kill all humans, and has made several remarks (asleep or otherwise) indicating a repressed bloodlust. It should be noted that in the episode "The Sting", in which Fry is thought to be dead, Bender reveals that every time he stated that he wished to kill all humans, he would then whisper "except one," the one being Fry. <b>This may not be canon, as this scene is part of a realistic dream Leela had while she was in a coma</b>."</i></p>

<dd>Yes "Bender with a pot" and "Bender as a spaceship" have obviously been editted for unclear reasons. Bender with cigar is far too small and the picture of bender on a lounge chair looks like some kind of funky fan art which seems strange when there are many other perfectly good pictures of Bender drinking.

<dd>Are they really even "twins" I mean, yes that is the joke they are playing off of but really Flexo and Bender are just two of (probably) hundreds of thousands of bending units. I mean, all modern robots are constructed by Mom so if Flexo and Bender are twins wouldn't every other robot on the show be like their other siblings? I'm just pointing out that normal human relationships don't necessarily apply here and perhaps neither Flexo or Bender should really be listed as relatives. Just a personal opinion though. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStardust8212_f3e3.html" title="User:Stardust8212">Stardust8212</a> 21:30, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Either this article should be moved to Bender Bending Rodriguez or Fry and Leela's pages should be moved to shorter names, because this page uses Bender's common name and the other two use their full names, which aren't used very commonly, just like Bender's full name.

<p>Maybe it's just me but I think the Bender page is still far too large. In addition some of this information is completely unecessary in fact there are whole sections that I could do without. In my opinion the Hardware and Software sections should be flat-out deleted. However, I would like some consensus on this issue and even know if this is an issue at all.

<dd>I'd agree the software section seems pretty pointless and hardware should be greatly trimmed but not nessecarily deleted. I'd be more likely to support a move to delete the "Bender's Top Ten most used words section". It's a joke from a single episode and already described on that page, it really seems trivial to me without adding to the article. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStardust8212_f3e3.html" title="User:Stardust8212">Stardust8212</a> 14:55, 11 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I did some cleanup, probably not nearly enough as some sections could really use a complete rewrite. I removed some of the fancruft items and overly long plot element descriptions and portions trying to recreate the humor of the show (un-encyclopedic). If people want to know specific situations where these events occurred they should go to the episode pages, that's what they are there for. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStardust8212_f3e3.html" title="User:Stardust8212">Stardust8212</a> 06:39, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>They are referred to as twins by the characters in the show. There may be plenty of possible ways robot kinship occurs, like the one you pose. I'm sure we could come up with plenty of scenarios that do or do not imply that they might be considered twins. But they <i>are</i>, according to what goes on in the show - I say that's what we should go by. <a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7ECheeser1_76a0.html" title="User:Cheeser1">Cheeser1</a> 03:26, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This is fundamentally flawed. Even on a person with cartoon style four fingered hands. First of all, making "The horns" is incorrect, it would be the third finger on the left hand and the second finger on the right hand which is not horns but two "middle finger"s on a five fingered person. Of course if you assume there are only four fingers then there <i>is no middle finger</i>. Anyway, unless someone has said somewhere that this was the actual intent of the creators then this qualifies as <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a> and is completely <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVerifiability_beed.html" title="WP:Verifiability">unverifiable</a>. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStardust8212_f3e3.html" title="User:Stardust8212">Stardust8212</a> 13:57, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's clearly sticking up both middle fingers, in counting binary - I reverted the change, instead of correcting it. I mistook it for saying both middle fingers, not something about the horns (yes, it's not that, but it is still something). And there is a middle finger - four digits on both hands means three fingers, meaning there is a middle finger (if it isn't already clearly analogous to our so-called middle finger). You can't seriously want to bust this up because you think it's OR and unverifiable - that's 95% of this article and every article that spends pages talking about a cartoon character. I mean, you didn't even delete the <i>other</i> speculative comment about his apartment number. <a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7ECheeser1_76a0.html" title="User:Cheeser1">Cheeser1</a> 15:01, 6 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Per your suggestion I removed the rest of the speculation from the Trivia section with the exception of the "Mirror, Mirror" reference because I think that may have actually been mentioned in the commentary, feel free to delete it if it wasn't. I believe I can find a source that says 00100100 is binary for $ but that's not really a good reason for it to stay. I'd be perfectly happy to see that entire section deleted seeing as the general policy is to <a href="../../../a/v/o/Wikipedia%7EAvoid_trivia_sections_in_articles_c909.html" title="Wikipedia:Avoid trivia sections in articles">Avoid trivia sections in articles</a> but people tend to get angry when entire sections are deleted.
