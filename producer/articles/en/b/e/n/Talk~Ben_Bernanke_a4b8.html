<p>This will sound, and perhaps it simply is a racist question to ask - but how many Reserve Chiefs have been Jewish. Again, I appreciate this might be an awful-sounding question, though I really just have in mind so called "over-representation" of Jewish Americans in certain fields... I read somewhere that many of the leaders of the IMF and World Bank are Jewish, and given their low numbers as a % of the population, if true, this sort of unusual representation strikes me as interesting. I can appreciate, however, that it might be too dangerous or loaded a question to ask. Still, I think it an honest question.</p>
<dl>
<dd>You can ask whatever you want, and lots of people have come up with lots of theories why Jews in the United States have been economically successful over the last 75 years or so, but I would caution you that the Ben Bernanke article would not be a good place to raise those questions -- Wikipedia is a reference work only, and the subject is simply not germane to this article.

<p>Could someone please clarify what is meant by "inflation hawks"?</p>
<dl>
<dd>An inflation hawk holds that the primary goal of monetary policy should be to prevent inflation rather than prompt growth. In practical terms, an inflation hawk would be quicker to pull the trigger on interest rate hikes as the economy heats up coming out of a recession. The effect might be to prematurely end the growth part of the cycle, but the hawks hold that it's a good idea because inflation is a worse ill than low growth or stagnation. So, for example, an inflation hawk isn't really bothered by the fact that wages have been essentially stagnant, or even declining. That's because wage increases are among the primary causes of inflation. And inflation is bad because it destroys the value of money. So, the hawk would say that yes, perhaps you aren't experiencing wage increases, but at least the money you have is still good for something. Some would argue even further that even if wages stagnate, real wages/buying power increase because of technology. The idea there is that if your wages stagnate, and you can only afford to buy $10 widgets for the 10 years, technology is making the widgets better, and you are therefore getting the widgets cheaper (or paying the same for a better widget), and that therefore even if your wage has remained the same, your real wage (buying power) has increased. While every economist agrees that inflation is a major problem, and its prevention should be one of the main goals of any monetary policy, "inflation hawks" are even stronger in this belief than most, and would be willing to make greater sacrifices to economic growth for the sake of preventing inflation. <a href="../../../b/i/n/User%7EBinkymagnus_76f2.html" title="User:Binkymagnus">Binkymagnus</a> 00:02, 25 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Why is "Bernanke is Jewish, like Greenspan" included in this article? I can understand if it merely said "Bernanke is Jewish", but adding that he shares his ethnicity with Greenspan seems unnecessary. What's the point? Does the article on Harriet Miers say "Like Sandra Day O' Connor, Miers is a Christian female of North European descent."? I don't think so. the only reason to include the "Jewish like Greenspan" that is for conspiracy theorists to get agitated. I say, take that line out.

I agree that saying "Like Greenspan,..." is irrelevant and ridiculous; but citing someone’s religion is totally legitimate and informative for a reference work. The Congressional Directory, published by the US government, sites religious affiliation of many members. So I don't buy the irrelevant argument. But is it TRUE that he is a Jew? I could find no reference to support that.</p>
<p>If anyone can support the claim that Bernanke is a Jew, I for one would appreciate that it be reflected in his Wikipedia entry.</p>
<p><br />
His middle name is Shalom. Hello&#160;?????????????????????????????????</p>
<dl>
<dd>It may not be -- see Discussion below -- Bernanke himself just says "Ben S."...</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>&amp; please sign your entries... If you really want to discuss this the rest of us need to be able to identify you.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If someone wants to advertise that she herself, or he himself, is this or that religion I don't have much objection. I don't like religious proselytising, and I tend to discount the views of those who do it: members of Congress who wish to pander to and manipulate current religious hysterias, by claiming affiliations they've recently discovered, I definitely include in that last group.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I do object, though, to labeling people "Jew" because someone else figures their family name, or facial profile, or something they've said or written seems to indicate it -- that is what was done here -- and that is what is done, too often, in Europe and the Middle East, forming the basis for some of the most objectionable racism and religious persecution which took place in the last century. So I'd be careful.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If Ben Bernanke himself wants to be called a "Jew" then by all means I'd let him do so. But for others to do so to me seems dangerously close to racism and religious persecution. Either way, this man's religious affiliation does not seem germane to his profession as an economist, and I don't think needs inclusion here -- why not list the color of his eyes as well, as I said before... Sounds to me more like some simply want to conflate "Judaism" with "money-handling" with old images of "Shylock", rather than do the research or stick to the subject. So I'd leave religion out of this one: touchy subject, and irrelevant here.</dd>

<p>I think it is interesting and concerning that "The Machine" tends to suppress any discussion when it comes to exposing that a person in high political power is Jewish. Perhaps the more appropriate and relevant question would be whether or not he is a Zionist.....which the majority of Jews are. Zionism is a political idealogy and is certainly relevant to any discussion involving a position of political power and influence.</p>
<p>Why is being Jewish controversial? Why do people want to censor that fact? Is there something I am missing here? Supreme court nominees and major politicians are always identified as belonging to some kind of religous organization. Why is it wrong to know what religous organization the Federal Chairman belongs too. We know that Porter Goss head of the CIA is member of the Episcopal church. Is that a state secret?</p>
<p>+Some people read more into Jewishness than religious or ethnic heritage, such as assuming all Jews are political Zionists or support <a href="../../../a/i/p/AIPAC_b056.html" title="AIPAC">AIPAC</a> and other lobbying groups. In my opinion Wikipedia can make a positive contribution to equality by simply documenting the facts of someone's religious background, thus making knowledge of such things so common as to be irrelevant. <a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyanluck_7c56.html" title="User:Ryanluck">Ryanluck</a> 16:09, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree to a point. I think that if are mentioning his view on inflation targeting, then we should have a few sentenced explaining that inflation targeting would be controversial, and why it is controversial, with a link to a more complete explanation. That seems to be the standard wikipedia practice. I certainly want this article to stay focused on Bernanke and not on economics, but I think a reader who comes here should get a feel for what Bernanke believes, and what outside observers think of those beliefs, without having to jump to a dozen other articles.</dd>
<dd>Put differently, if I knew nothing abour Bernanke, and nothing about economics, and I came to read this page, I'd like to learn just enough to feel like I was able to have a water cooler conversation of the man and his potential policies? -<a href="../../../o/%5E/o/User%7EO%5EO_8499.html" title="User:O^O">O^O</a></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Right now, after the text was restored, we have "Such an action is controversial among those who hold that stable inflation is fundamentally incompatible with the mandate of the Federal Reserve to create stable prices, those who hold it reduces central bank transparancy [3], and those who believe that inflation targeting limits the flexibility of central banks."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>First, US 12 Ch3 Sub 1 225a is titled "Maintenance of long run growth of monetary and credit aggregates" so indeed the goal of the Fed is to maximize growth. No economist on the planet will agree with the notion that inflation targeting is bad for stable prices, because _we will always have small amounts of inflation_. Stable prices do not mean prices that stay exactly the same. Inflation targeting will work to keep inflation low and thus prices stable.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Further, the notion that inflation targetting REDUCES transparency is silly (this Taiwanese article surely makes an interesting argument, but it is not the wide-spread NPOV that one would expect in an encyclopedia article). The entire goal of inflation targeting is to make monetary policy more transparent, predictable, and accountable.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>We definitely need to mention that Dr Bernanke is interested in inflation-targeting, since it is his big thing and f.e. The Wall Street Journal is writing on it every day. And it is controversial, because f.e. Greenspan is against it.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>But both of these reasons given are wrong, or at least not the "usual" reasons. The typical, NPOV reason that even Dr Bernanke would acknowledge is that inflation-targeting reduces the Fed's flexibility. It has benefits and possibly other detriments, but those should be mentioned elsewhere.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>So I suggest restoring to my orignal text: "Such an action is controversial among some economists who believe that inflation targeting limits the flexibility of central banks." or something similar.</dd>

<dd>Whoa Nelly! Thanks for looking at the title of 12 USC 225a, but I wonder if you actually read the mandate? <i>..goals of maximum employment, <b>stable prices</b>, and moderate long-term interest rates</i> - stable prices are absolutely in there. Now whether or not this three-headed mandate is realistic is another question.</dd>
<dd>I'm not sure who endorse the opinion that we will "always have small amounts of inflation" as it is not generally true. For most of the history of the United States we had long periods of price stability, interrupted with brief periods of inflation or deflation. Typically, deflation corrected prices back to where they had been pre-inflation. Uncorrected inflation can be tied to a handful of key events, and our current period of persistant inflation is a recent phenomenon of the past four decades.</dd>
<dd>It is, of couse, necessary to have "growth of the monetary and credit aggregates" in a growing economy, or else we will suffer from price deflation. i.e. Congress has authorized the growth of monetary and credit aggregates <b>in order to obtain</b> maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate interest rates. At least they didn't ask for free ponys too, huh? (it's a joke). -<a href="../../../o/%5E/o/User%7EO%5EO_8499.html" title="User:O^O">O^O</a></dd>

<dl>
<dd>I did read it. It lists a lot of things, indeed stable prices being one of them, but the overarching goal of the fed is balancing growth against inflation. A powerful economy always has some inflation -- in the (0,2) % range -- I am not talking about rampant inflation. Reasons to want a small amount of inflation are numerous (contracts, sticky prices, unemployment, etc.).</dd>
<dd>But all of this is irrelevant, really. I want the two points removed from the current article, because they are not the current concerns of academics or the financial community. No one believes that inflation targeting is "against the mandate of the Fed". It is a way of _limiting_ inflation. If anything, inflation targeting is a way to be hawkish on inflation. And the point about lack of transparency is very, very wrong: inflation targeting is a mechanism used to _increase_ transparency.</dd>

<dd>P.S. You need to read them again, or be more specific in what sort of "growth" you are talking about. The Fed mandate has three, and only three, goals. Growth is not one of those goals. Growth of money and credit is a tool that the Fed is empowered with by the congress to reach those three (and only those three) goals. -<a href="../../../o/%5E/o/User%7EO%5EO_8499.html" title="User:O^O">O^O</a></dd>

<dd>Ok, remove them then - I won't put them back without additional sourcing. But I insist we keep text the explains that some see inflation targets as a way explicitly embracing the idea that some inflation is acceptable, and that this doesn't make inflation hawks happy.</dd>
<dd>Some notes (as much for me as anybody):</dd>
<dd><i>"Targeting is partly designed to prevent bankers from killing growth by being overly hawkish."</i> - <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/04_28/b3891020.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/04_28/b3891020.htm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></dd>
<dd>"<i>Zero inflation, or close to zero depending on measurement error and other technical details, is as good as any other choice in promoting ultimate macroeconomic goals such as full employment and long-term economic growth.</i>" - <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/speeches/2005/20050526/default.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/speeches/2005/20050526/default.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/speeches/2005/20050526/default.htm</a></dd>
<dd>This is an interesting way of putting it <i>"Poole is a long-time advocate of inflation targeting. He has said zero inflation, properly measured, would be the best objective"</i> - <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/9805161/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/9805161/" rel="nofollow">[3]</a></dd>
<dd>There is a contingent that holds zero inflation as a goal. If Bernanke is supporting an inflation target that is a range of positive numbers, then he clearly isn't in that camp. Striving for zero inflation also means accepting deflation as a risk, which Bernanke's comments have implied isn't his style.</dd>
<dd>Point being, inflation targets are certainly seen by some as being bad because the constrain the bank. But inflation targets are also certainly seen by another group as being bad because they are inherently inflationary (unless we are saying that the target is zero or a negative number, which isn't what Bernanke is saying, and it is silly to bring up). -<a href="../../../o/%5E/o/User%7EO%5EO_8499.html" title="User:O^O">O^O</a></dd>

<p>RLove: Your arbitrary exclusion of the reference to Bernanke's IQ and its rarity in the population is high-handed. It is a fact of potential interest to many, and serves to highlight one (of many) reasons he should seriously be considered for the position.</p>
<p>To include a reference in the body of the text would be pedantic and would destroy the flow of the article. Nonetheless, the conversion is well accepted in the high IQ universe and has been subjected to rigorous testing over the years.</p>
<p>The article is not simply a discussion of macroeconomics; it is a portrait of a man. The fact and insight I added contributes to that portrait.</p>
<p>But if you need the warm fuzzy of researching this conversion, I suggest you start with www.davidpbrown.co.uk. Further study on your part will serve only to confirm the accuracy of my addition.</p>
<p>I shan't bother to reinsert the addition. Your type would love to re-exert your power of "reversion". If you'd like to take it up at a more personal level, I am Donnernv@aol.com</p>

<dd>His IQ is one thing, the correlation between SAT scores and what his IQ is statistically likely to be his quite another. Further, even if we acknowledge that that is interesting, I doubt the validity. Information besides economics is very interesting -- this is a bio, after all. But unsubstantiated correlated data is not a bio. This is a professional quality encyclopedia.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Another point: Should we start placing the correlated IQ after every mention of someone's SAT score? What about placing other correlated data, translated data, synonyms, equivalents, et cetera after every applicable value? Should we do that, too? Of course not. We could get into a never ending mess. <a href="../../../r/l/o/User%7ERlove_1468.html" title="User:Rlove">Rlove</a> 15:09, 17 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I think "I doubt the validity" was pretty well discredited as a telling argument in a scientific inquiry after 1359 AD or so. You can bring youself up to speed by reading Frey and Detterman (2003) from Case Western Reserve or the excellent review article "Mostly About the SAT as an IQ Test" published in the September 1999 issue of Telicom, the Journal of the International Society of Philosophical Inquiry.</p>
<p>Until you do so, your comments will receive the weight they deserve. Your second paragraph simply contains straw men that have nothing to do with the precise subject at hand. Donnernv</p>
<dl>
<dd>No, the second paragraph is actually the key point. We don't put indirect information such as this in encyclopedias. If people want to see the link between SATs and IQs, that is an interesting bit of information to add (if properly referenced) to <a href="../../../s/a/t/SAT_684e.html" title="SAT">SAT</a> -- which, btw, currently has a section on IQ that is not fully supportive of your claim. But, anyhow, we don't parenthetically add after every x the note "which implies y" whenever we have the evidence suggesting the correlation. Lots of data about Bernanke makes him statistically likely to possess all sorts of implications; we don't list that. See my point? It is not that your SAT &lt;-&gt; IQ link is not interesting, it is just not a direct piece of data about Bernanke and thus does not belong here. <a href="../../../r/l/o/User%7ERlove_1468.html" title="User:Rlove">Rlove</a> 04:24, 18 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Please do not be so combative or commanding. I am not, in any way, a "Grand Arbiter" of Wikipedia. I am trying, unfortunately without much success, to make a nuanced and logical argument to you, in an effort to CONVINCE not DICTATE TO you of this position. This really is not the mountain it has been made to be; the issue is simply. My name, Robert, has certain statistical implications according to the book <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freakonomics.html" title="Freakonomics">Freakonomics</a> (seriously). But whenever I list my name, I don't write down those correlations. For a lot of reasons: it is just a correlation, for one. But the most important point is that the data is not directly related to ME. Every piece of data in the world has statistically-likely implications. They belong in articles about the data. Bernanke is a wonderful economist and he is going to get confirmed, no doubt.

<p>OK &amp; agreed: he &amp; they would have been careful, on that announcement. But now, does that mean he's "Jewish"? That was the original problem, here... I say no, that he isn't unless &amp; until he says he is.</p>
<p>ps. On the Web there are plenty of websites &amp; blogs etc. claiming that Bernanke is Jewish -- some to praise him, some to put him down -- and guess what a large number of them cite, this very Wikipedia article... So I think we have to be careful, about these things, &amp; observe some standards... If a guy doesn't want his beliefs discussed, and doesn't discuss them, our own labeling of them is sheer &amp; sometimes-dangerous speculation, I believe.</p>

<p>I do not understand (or like) the remark about "theory" at the end of the current article.</p>
<p>First, his academic work is not really theory. It is very empirical. So the claim is inaccurate.</p>
<p>Second, if the article is going to cite some objection to his appointment, can it be specific? That is, force a critic to be quoted in public? Right now the article is just reciting hearsay.</p>
<p>For the record, very, very few of the members of the Board of Governors are or have been "investors." The Fed is not supposed to be Wall Street, Incorporated. --66.108.95.115 21:57, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I agree with the theory post above - get some source for this or delete it. In addition, I don't think you can argue that the real life experience of some finance jockey constitutes preparation for determining the supply of money. All the Fed needs to know is how changes in the money supply affect the economy and the actions rational actors will take. The idea that he has no business experience and is thus unsuited is bull; I think his lack of business experience maybe reduces his initial credibility on Wall Street, and that's all.</p>

<dd>I have removed the "Career Controversy" section because it was nothing but <a href="../../../w/e/a/WP%7EWeasel_b02e.html" title="WP:Weasel">weasel words</a>. The text I removed was:</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>Due to the fact that Bernanke has never actually worked in corporate America in his lifetime, investors and some economists argue that he is not suited for his position as Chairman of the Fed, fearing that his lack of real life economic experience makes him more likely to institute theoretically attractive but practically untested policies.</i></dd>

<p>Why is the German Pronunciation included? He's not German. Does he speak German and call himself that name in that language? Documenting the pronunciation of names in foreign languages might make an interesting article on its own, but I don't see how it's relevant here. As always, I'm happy for someone to show that I'm wrong. <a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyanluck_7c56.html" title="User:Ryanluck">Ryanluck</a> 16:14, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Shouldn't it be mentioned that Bernanke said something like how union decline has been bad? He said some other things in that speech. -Amit</p>
