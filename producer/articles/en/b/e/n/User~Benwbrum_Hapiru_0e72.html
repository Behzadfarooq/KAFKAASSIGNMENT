	    <p>Back in 2004, tired of the long arguments about the nature of the Hapiru, I collected all the references to the subject I could find in my own library and typed them up here. The editors who had been contesting the article incorporated much of that material into the the article, reaching a consensus. Since that time, that listing of sources has been merged into the main article and the Hapiru/Sources was deleted. Here I reproduce the sources article below.</p>

<p>The historical character of the Patriarchal period was further reinforced - so it was thought some years ago - by the mention in cuneiform and hieroglyphic texts dating mostly from the fifteenth and fourteenth centuries BC of a category of people, generally grouped in bellicose bands, called <i>habiru(c)</i> (or <i>`apiru</i> in Egyptian), a name which sounded remarkably like biblical <i>'Ibri</i>, the Hebrews. There was at last the long-awaited appearance in non-hebraical sources of Abraham's kin!</p>
<p>Unfortunately, recent and thorough reappraisals of these sources have shown beyond any doubt that the Habiru have nothing in common with the Hebrews but a similitude of name. They were neither a people nor a tribe, but a class of society made up of refugees, of 'displaced persons' as we would now say, who frequently turned into outlaws <sup>25</sup></p>

<p>Roux's <i>Ancient Iraq</i> is a general guide to Mesopotamian history, from the pre-historic period up to the Persian Empire. According to the reviews on Amazon, Roux is actually an amateur who wrote the three editions in his retirement. It was required reading in my Akkadian class in college. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenwbrum_d3bd.html" title="User:Benwbrum">Benwbrum</a> 18:14, 19 Feb 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>On the fringes of most of the writing civilizations a social group called the <i>`apiru</i> or <i>habiru</i> or <i>hapiru</i> consisted of stateless persons who had withdrawn from peasant and city life and made their livings as robbers and mercenaries.<sup>6</sup> The term apparently means "dusty" or "crosser" and refers to desert travelers, and it is used as a designation for a social class of dissatisfied former city dwellers who had taken to a life of brigandage, preying on kings ruling small cities and their commerce.</p>
<p>Interest in the term <i>hapiru</i> has derived from the possibility that it is related to the word for Hebrew, <i>`ibri</i>[second I is long -BWB] in Hebrew. The term does not refer to a self-conscious ethnic group. For one thing, the term is attested even as early as the Old Assyrian trade in the 1900s B.C.E. Although one can conceive of the later Hebrews as originating from among such groups, it does not seem that there was a direct connection.<sup>7</sup></p>

<p>There were different designations for groups of foreign origin who were not fully assimilated, which naturally often formed elements of unrest. Such was the case as early as the Old Babylonian and even before, but above all in the Amarna Age in Syria and Nuzi. Among these terms, the word <i>hapiru</i>, the basic meaning of which still has not been clarified, has been frequently discussed. This word appeaqrs in ancient Egyptian and in Ugaritic as <i>`pr</i>, and sounds similar to Hebrew <i>`ibri</i>, although <i>hapiru</i> is certainly not to be equated with <i>`ibri</i>. It is impossible to speak in only a few sentences about these and similar, less widespread group designations, since these frequetnly denote different types of groups, depending on the place and time.<sup>20</sup> Most importantly, however, the fate of Syrian city-states was decisively determined in part by the non- or only partially integrated fringe groups such as the Hapiru.</p>

<p>When Ugarit was destroyed some hundred tablets were being baked in the oven, and so from this site we have documents written on the very eve of its destruction. One of these tablets "from the oven" - a letter from a certain <i>Ydn</i> to "the king, his master" - mentions <i>prm</i> (<i>hapiru</i>), and requests that the king "equip 150 ships."<sup>19</sup></p>

<p>Among foreign professionals, the lowest level seems to have been that of the <i>hapiru</i> (or <i>`prw</i>), free-lancers who were hired merely for a season or campaign. Egyptian, Ugaritic, and Hittite texts all make mention of <i>hapiru</i>, both as hired troops and as troublesome elements against whom action had to be taken. The "Hebrew" traditions in early Israel indicate that many of the <i>hapiru</i> who fought for the pharaoh were hired from the less settled populations in the southern Levant. Etymologically, the word <i>hapiru</i> seems to have had no specifically military connotation, meaning some thin glike "vagrants", or "those who have crossed boundaries," and clearly not all <i>hapiru</i> were warriors.<sup>49</sup> But in the Late Bronze Age many <i>hapiru</i> were associated with mercenary military service, and apparently they were hired for hand-to-hand rather than for long-range combat. The Sumerian ideogram that is often used alongside or in place of the word <i>hapiru</i> is <i>SA.GAZ</i>, which seems originally to have meant "he who commits aggression," or "one who knocks down," or even "killer."<sup>50</sup> The <i>hapiru</i>, or <i>SA.GAZ</i>, seem to have fought in conjunction with chariots but were not themselves charioteers or chariot archers.<sup>51</sup></p>
<p>A preferable source of seasoned infantrymen for temporary service was a vassal state or a province on the frontier. As indicated above, the Hittite kings (who rarely hired <i>hapiru</i>) seem to have assembled the considerable infantry needed for a major campaign by requiring every subject district to send to the Great King a certain number of troops. ....</p>
<p>49. Of a score of studies on the <i>hapiru</i> the most recent is by Nadav Na'aman, "Hapiru and Hebrews: The Transfer of a Social Term to the literary Scene," <i>JNES</i> 45 (1986): 271-88; see also H Cazelles, "The Hebrews", in D Wiseman, ed., <i>Peoples of Old Testament Times</i> (Oxford, 1973), 1-28.</p>

<p>51. W. Helck, <i>Die Beziehungen Aegyptens zu Vorderasien im 3. und 2. Jahrtausend v. Chr.</i> (Wiesbaden, 1962), 522-31, proposed that the terms <i>maryannu</i> and <i>`prw</i> stood respectively for chariotry and infantry professionals.</p>

<p>In the interior, centers such as Deir `Alla (Succoth), Lachish, and Hazor were most likely sacked by "Israelites," seminomadic tribesmen who for generations had scraped out an existence in the hill country flanking the valleys of the Jordan and its tributaries, and in the desert fringe to the east. until teh Catastrophe, the best that either Philistines or Israelites could hope for was service as <i>ne`arim</i> or <i>hapiru</i> in the employ of a petty king. But now they were in a position to kill the king, loot his palace and his city, and burn them to the ground. Not all the Canaanite cities between the Jordan and the Mediterranean were razed. Shechem was spared by the Israelite tribesmen, the Israelites foreswearing hostilities against the city, and the Shechemites granting to those Israelites who submitted to circumcision the rights of <i>connubium</i> and of participation in the venerable cult on Mt. Gerizim. Gibeon was also spared, having come to terms with the invaders: in return for their lives, the Gibeonites were said to have pledged themselves and their descendants to serve their conquerors as hewers of wood and drawers of water.</p>

<p><i>Bronze Age</i> is an attempt by Drews to explain the Catastrophe around 1200 B.C. This is the same event that draws speculation about <a href="../../../s/e/a/Sea_Peoples_7b84.html" title="Sea Peoples">Sea Peoples</a> and such. Part one lays out the evidence and acquaints the reader with the standard picture of the pre-1200 Near East and with the chronology of the collapse of kingdoms after that. Part Two lays out previously advanced views of the Catastrophe's cause, including chapters titled "Earthquakes", "Migrations", "Ironworking", "Drought", "Systems Collapse", and "Raiders". Part Three advances Drews' theory that the Catastrophe was the result of changes in military tactics that shifted the balance of military power from well-organized/well-funded armies of chariots to poorly-funded armies of javelin throwers.</p>
<p>The three quotes above come from radically different contexts within Drews' book. Page 13 is in the middle of part one, and is laying out the accepted view of the evidence. Page 151 is in the middle of supporting statements for his own hypothesis, and also represents accepted scholarship. However, this is a description of a synthesis of the evidence, rather than a presentation of the evidence itself. Page 220 occurs in Drews's conclusion, which is a speculative narrative account of what the Catastrophe might have been like, using his own hypothesis as an assumption and re-interpreting the evidence in light of that. In particular, page 220 makes no claim to identify <i>hapiru</i> with the Israelites, as Drews is using the terms "Israelite" and "Philistine" in this context as convenient labels for socio-economic groups within his narrative. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenwbrum_d3bd.html" title="User:Benwbrum">Benwbrum</a> 00:44, 20 Feb 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>The most likely explanation of the <i>pankus</i> is that is was a convocation of the Great King's vassals, each of whom had at his command a small troop of soldiers. Although some historians have imagined the army of the Hittite king as a militia of the "Hittite nation," perhaps similar to Alaric's Visigoths, it was in fact drawn from various language groups, and many of the most important units were "mercenary" (we cannot even be certain that the majority of the troops serving in this Hittite monarchy spoke Hittite). Thus in the Hittite Law Code there appear "the Manda Warriors" and "the Sala warriors" alongside various local units.<sup>31</sup> It is becoming clear that in the second millennium a generic term for "mercenary soldiers" was the word <i>hapiru</i> or the Sumerogram SA.GAZ. The hapirus (or SA.GAZ) appear in fourteen documents from the period of the Hittite Empire and have recently turned up in two texts from the Old Kingdom.<sup>32</sup> In these two texts, which Heinrich Otten dates to the seventeenth or sixteenth century, "the troops from Hatti and the SA. GAZ troops" appear almost as a formula, and it appears that the king's relationship to the mercenaries was no different from his relationship to the militias conscripted from the towns of Hatti.<sup>33</sup> Both the SA. GAZ units and the units from Hatti were personally bound to the king, and he to them, by formidable oaths. The military oath was taken by all commanders, whether of local levies or of professional troops, and invited upon the oath-breaker (whether king or vassal) a long and horrible catalog of divine punishments.<sup>34</sup></p>

<p>33. Of the SA. GAZ in the period of the Hittite Old Kingdom, Otten concludes ("Zwei althethitische Belege," 223): "Ihre militaerische Dienstleistung is offenkundig. Deutlich wird jetzt, dass die diesbezueglichen Belege sich auf die Zeit des Alten Reiches, also auf die Periode der Konsolidierung des hethitischen Staates in Anatolien vor 1500 v. Chr (17./16. Jh.) konzentrieren. Neu tritt dabei ihre rechtliche Stellung zum Hofe hervor, indem der Koenig sich eidlich zur Einhaltung von Abmachungen verpflichtet, wobei die Hapiri anderen militaerischen Formationen und Chargen offensichtlich gleichgestellt werden. Das zeigt eine soziale Lage dieser Hapiri auf, wie sie bisher den Texten nicht zu entnehmen war."</p>
<p>34. In the form that it has come down to us, the oath dates from the fifteenth century B.C. See N. Oettinger, <i>Die militaerishce [sic] Eid der Hethiter</i> (Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz, 1976).</p>

<p>4. The <i>`Apiru</i> were foreigners, some of whom served the Egyptians at the time.

<p>46. Or 217 or 144.</p>
<p>47. The appearance of the <i>Apiru</i> (cf. pp. 22, 255, 261) in a list of Asiatic captives is unusual. They are listed as the third element in a list, preceded by princes and princes' brothers(?), followed by three terms having geographic connotation --- <i>Shasu</i>, the Bedouin, especially the to the south of Palestine; <i>Kharu</i> "Horites," the settled people of Palestine-Syria; and Neges, perhaps "Nukhashshe," the people of northern Syria -- and termineated by an expression of attribution, here translated: "the adherents(?) thereof," with a miscarved <i>hr</i> sign, but perhaps to be read: "the families thereof," with the word <i>abet</i> "family." The <i>Apiru</i> are notably greater in number than the princes and princes' brothers; they are notably fewer in number than the three regional listees or the retainers (or families). It is quite clear that the Egyptians recognized the <i>Apiru</i> as a distinct entity from other peoples, clearly countable. See also A. H. Gardiner, <i>Ancient Egyptian Onomastica</i>, I, 184*.</p>

<p>7. Amon, Mut, and Khonsu formed the Theban triad of gods. The 2607 foreigners are part of a total of 86486 persons added to the Theban estates under Ramses III. The 2093 foreigners are part of a total of 12,364 persons added to the Heliopolitan estates. The 205 foreigners are part of a total of 3079 persons added to the Memphite estates. In these lists of temple serfs, the word <i>tep</i> "head," is regularly used for the Egyptian serfs. In the case of the Theban and Memphite lists, the word <i>sep</i> "case", is used for foreign serfs.</p>
<p>8. It is not absolutely certain that these were foreigners. "Others" may mean "outsiders, foreigners," or it may mean "the common people, the rabble."</p>
<p>9. The term <i><a href="../../../m/a/r/Maryanu.html" title="Maryanu">maryanu</a></i> was used for Asiatic warriors in this period. cf. p. 22, n.2. The term <i>`apiru</i> has been argued to mean "aliens," particularly applicable to foreign slave labor, perhaps the same word as <i>Habiru,</i> and thus etymologically related to "Hebrew" -- but not implying that these captives were Israelites.

<p>12. Milkilu (Heb. Malchiel) was prince of Gezer. For Yanhamu see the previous letter.</p>
<p>13. For Milkilu see the previous letter. Shuwardata (with an Indo-Aryan name) was prince of the Hebron region in the southern hill-country, and frequently appears in association with Milkilu. The `Apiru (formerly called Habiru) were a strong semi-nomadic people, or rather class of population in Syria and Palestine. While there is much reason to identify them with the Hebrews of the Patriarchal Age, the combination still remains uncertain and cannot be made the basis for any historical inferences.</p>

<p>13. The 'Apiru (formerly called Habiru) were a strong semi-nomadic people, or rather class of population in Syria and Palestine. While there is much reason to identify them with the Hebrews of the Patriarchal Age, the combination still remains uncertain and cannot be made the basis for any historcial inference.</p>
<p>16. This letter, from the beginning of Akh-en-Aton's reign, is an extraordinarily illuminating illustration of the situation in Palestine at that time. Just who this redoubtable 'Apiru prince was we do not learn, since the proud feudal princes disdained to even mention names of the semi-nomadic 'Apiru. However, he was sufficiently dangerous to unite the arch-foes, 'Abdu-Heba and Shuwardata, and to induce them to offer fifty chariots (a very considerable offer for Palestinian cheiftains) to the princes of Accho and Achshaph in the plain of Acre, far to the north. One suspects that Milkilu of Gezer and Lab'ayu of Shechem, whoa re not even mentioned, at all, were -- either or both -- involved with them, the 'Apiru.</p>
<p>17. This letter is characteristic of the continuous requests of 'Abdu-Heba, prince of Jerusalem, for Egyptian assistance in his chronic struggle with the 'Apiru. However, it seems certain from other letters that he was inclined to lump his enemies among the "governors" (i.e. the native princes) with the 'Apiru.</p>
<p>18. In this letter the prince of Jerusalem complains about a number of events which recur in other letters.</p>
<p>19. This letter continues the previous letter, and incidentally paints a vivid picture of the anarchic condition of the country early in the reign of Akh-en-Aton. The references to "the (very) gate of Sile (Zilu)" mean that the outrages against the <i>pax Aegyptica</i> extend to the frontiers of Egypt itself, near modern Qantarah.</p>
<p>20.</p>
<p>21. In lines 15ff there is an almost certain reference to the town of Bethlehem, which thus appears for the first time in history. Keilah may have been the home of Shuwardata, prince of the Hebron district.</p>
<p>24. cf. the preceding note. [Which states "Yapakhu was prince of Gezer after the death of Milkilu."]</p>

<p>W.F. Albright translated these letters in collaboration with George E. Mendenhall; W.L. Moran, S.J. made a few corrections for the 3rd edition.</p>
<p>I have silently pruned some material from the footnotes that refer to the text I did not copy here; not all of the letters on these pages mention the 'Apiru/Habiru. -- <a href="../../../l/l/y/User%7ELlywrch_461d.html" title="User:Llywrch">llywrch</a> 08:57, 25 Feb 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>"(So) I took with me my horse, my chariot and, my groom, went away and crossed over into the desert country and even entered into the region of the Sutian warriors. I stayed with them (once) overnight in my ... chariot, but the next day I moved on and went to the land of Canaan. I stayed in Ammia in the land of Canaan; in Ammia lived (also) natives of Halab, of the country of Mushkishkhi, of the country Ni' and also warriors from the country Ama'e. They discovered that I was the son of their overlord and gathered around me. There I grew up and stayed for a long time. For seven years I lived among the Hapiru-people. (Then) I released birds<sup>2</sup> (to observe their flight) and looked into (the entrails of) lambs (and found) that after seven years Adad had become favorable to me. So I built boats, made ... soldiers board them, approached the country."</p>

<p>This inscription was found in 1939 at Atchana in Syria, but not published (by Sidney Smith, <i>The Statue of Idrimi</i>) until 1949 due to the war. This translation is the work of A. Leo Oppenheim, who notes that he translated the ideogram <sup>d</sup>IM as "Adad". I know from other references that Idrimi was a king in Mitanni.</p>
<p>The quotation above is Idrimi's narrative of the years between his departure from Emar, where he, his mother &amp; his brothers lived in exile with his mother's family, until he returned to Alalakh to become its king. -- <a href="../../../l/l/y/User%7ELlywrch_461d.html" title="User:Llywrch">llywrch</a> 08:57, 25 Feb 2004 (UTC)</p>
