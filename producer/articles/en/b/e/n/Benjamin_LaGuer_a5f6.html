<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/n/Benjamin_LaGuer_a5f6.html" title="Edit section: Early life">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Early life</span></h2>
<p>LaGuer was born in <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Bronx_bb96.html" title="The Bronx">The Bronx</a>, New York. He grew up in New York and <a href="../../../p/u/e/Puerto_Rico_f6b0.html" title="Puerto Rico">Puerto Rico</a> until the age of 15 when he moved to <a href="../../../l/e/o/Leominster%2C_Massachusetts_268a.html" title="Leominster, Massachusetts">Leominster, Massachusetts</a> to live with a sister who was his father's daughter from a previous marriage. He attended high school in Leominster before dropping out in late 1980 to join the Army where he served in a support capacity in <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germany.html" title="Germany">Germany</a>. He returned to Leominster in June 1983 having been honorably discharged from the military. On the morning of July 13 police were summoned to his neighbor's apartment where they discovered the 59-year-old woman bound and beaten. It was quickly determined to be a rape case. Two days later, on July 15, 1983, LaGuer was charged with the crime. He proclaimed his innocence but was convicted in Worcester Superior Court the following January and given a life sentence with eligibility for parole after 15 years.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/n/Benjamin_LaGuer_a5f6.html" title="Edit section: Challenges to the Conviction">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Challenges to the Conviction</span></h2>
<p>Soon after starting his prison term LaGuer began studying in the law library and learned how to access the legal system on his own behalf and for other inmates. In 1991 a challenge LaGuer launched to his conviction two years earlier went all the way to the <a href="../../../m/a/s/Massachusetts_Supreme_Judicial_Court_9c22.html" title="Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court">Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court</a> which rendered a landmark ruling in LaGuer's favor. At issue was whether an affidavit given by juror William Nowick that other members of the all-white-male panel made racist comments before and during deliberations constituted a violation of LaGuer's right to a fair trial. Even though the state's high court sided with LaGuer as a matter of law, it did not overturn the verdict, instead sending it back to the trial judge, Robert Mulkern, for a finding of fact. After a hearing in which some jurors were called to testify, Judge Mulkern ruled that the jury's deliberations were not tainted by racism. LaGuer exhausted his last appeal of that decision in 1994, more than ten years after his conviction.</p>
<p>The case became well known among activists, academics and journalists who came to believe strongly that LaGuer had suffered a gross miscarriage of justice. Starting in 1986, reporters who looked at the case found troubling questions about whether LaGuer in fact committed the crime. Among those who took an interest in the case and who corresponded with LaGuer were <a href="../../../n/o/b/Nobel_Peace_Prize_60fc.html" title="Nobel Peace Prize">Nobel Peace Prize</a> laureate <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elie_Wiesel_d7b0.html" title="Elie Wiesel">Elie Wiesel</a>, <a href="../../../p/u/l/Pulitzer_Prize_e802.html" title="Pulitzer Prize">Pulitzer Prize</a> winning author <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Styron_4878.html" title="William Styron">William Styron</a>, <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harvard_University_9346.html" title="Harvard University">Harvard University</a> professor <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_Louis_Gates_Jr._5158.html" title="Henry Louis Gates Jr.">Henry Louis Gates Jr.</a>, <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harvard_Law_School_e417.html" title="Harvard Law School">Harvard Law School</a> professor <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Ogletree_0ed3.html" title="Charles Ogletree">Charles Ogletree</a>, and <a href="../../../w/b/u/WBUR_6b65.html" title="WBUR">WBUR</a> radio personality Jose Masso, who created the <a href="http://www.lib.neu.edu/archives/collect/findaids/m100findprint.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.lib.neu.edu/archives/collect/findaids/m100findprint.htm" rel="nofollow">Benjamin LaGuer papers</a> collection at <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northeastern_University%2C_Boston_15c9.html" title="Northeastern University, Boston">Northeastern University, Boston</a>. During that time LaGuer also earned a bachelors degree magna cum laude from <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston_University_b25d.html" title="Boston University">Boston University</a> and won a first place <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_PEN_7d90.html" title="International PEN">International PEN</a> award for an essay on his mother. In 1998 LaGuer was for the first time eligible for parole but was denied because he refused to admit to the crime. At that point he attracted an unlikely ally in <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston_University_b25d.html" title="Boston University">Boston University</a> president and <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990.html" title="1990">1990</a> Democratic candidate for governor of <a href="../../../m/a/s/Massachusetts.html" title="Massachusetts">Massachusetts</a>, <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Silber_d6a4.html" title="John Silber">John Silber</a> who helped arrange for pro bono legal representation.

<p>His legal team, led by law professor <a href="http://www.nesl.edu/faculty/SIEGEL.CFM" class="external text" title="http://www.nesl.edu/faculty/SIEGEL.CFM" rel="nofollow">David Siegel</a>, a founding member of the New England <a href="../../../i/n/n/Innocence_Project_40fa.html" title="Innocence Project">Innocence Project</a>, then sought and found the physical evidence from the crime and in 1999 <a href="http://www.mwe.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.mwe.com/" rel="nofollow">McDermott, Will &amp; Emery</a> managing partner Robert Cordy, now a member of the <a href="../../../m/a/s/Massachusetts_Supreme_Judicial_Court_9c22.html" title="Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court">Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court</a>, wrote to the Worcester District Attorney in an attempt to establish a protocol for <a href="../../../d/n/a/DNA_396c.html" title="DNA">DNA</a> testing. The district attorney, <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Conte_cc7a.html" title="John Conte">John Conte</a>, a former State Senator appointed by Governor <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Dukakis_8fbd.html" title="Michael Dukakis">Michael Dukakis</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1976.html" title="1976">1976</a> to finish an unexpired term, rebuffed Cordy, in turn intimating that LaGuer's team may have tampered with the evidence. After more than two years of contentious and costly litigation a DNA test revealed a trace amount of LaGuer's genetic material in the evidence. Several forensic DNA experts, including <a href="http://home.att.net/~applieddnaresources/expert.htm" class="external text" title="http://home.att.net/~applieddnaresources/expert.htm" rel="nofollow">Applied DNA Resources</a> principle Theodore Kessis, <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Jay_College_3597.html" title="John Jay College">John Jay College</a> of Criminal Justice Associate Provost <a href="http://web.jjay.cuny.edu/~science/kobilinsky.htm" class="external text" title="http://web.jjay.cuny.edu/~science/kobilinsky.htm" rel="nofollow">Lawrence Kobilinsky</a> and <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harvard_University_9346.html" title="Harvard University">Harvard University</a> geneticist <a href="http://www.oeb.harvard.edu/hartl/lab/" class="external text" title="http://www.oeb.harvard.edu/hartl/lab/" rel="nofollow">Daniel Hartl</a>, questioned the DNA test, and called for an investigation into its validity.</p>
<p>LaGuer continued to maintain his innocence and attracted the pro bono services of another high powered international law firm, <a href="../../../g/o/o/Goodwin_Procter_c31d.html" title="Goodwin Procter">Goodwin Procter</a>, where <a href="http://www.goodwinprocter.com/PeopleDetail.aspx?id=1525" class="external text" title="http://www.goodwinprocter.com/PeopleDetail.aspx?id=1525" rel="nofollow">James C. Rehnquist</a>, a partner at the firm and son of the late Chief Justice <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Rehnquist_98fe.html" title="William Rehnquist">William Rehnquist</a>, took over LaGuer's case. In February 2004 Rehnquist filed a motion for a new trial in <a href="../../../w/o/r/Worcester%2C_Massachusetts_6e3a.html" title="Worcester, Massachusetts">Worcester, Massachusetts</a> Superior Court seeking a new trial on the basis of a <a href="../../../m/a/s/Massachusetts_State_Police_b538.html" title="Massachusetts State Police">Massachusetts State Police</a> report generated the day LaGuer was arrested showing that four fingerprints found on the base of the trimline telephone, the cord of which was used to bind the victim's wrists, did not match the defendant's. Rehnquist's position that the suppression of potentially exculpatory evidence (revealed in November 2001, almost 18 years after the trial) constituted a violation of LaGuer's right to a fair trial, was rejected by Worcester Superior Court Judge Timothy Hillman, who it was later revealed had once represented the victim's daughter in a probate matter related to her father's estate.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup> Rehnquist appealed the decision where he was again denied. In June 2006 the <a href="../../../m/a/s/Massachusetts_Supreme_Judicial_Court_9c22.html" title="Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court">Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court</a> agreed to hear the case. On March 23rd, 2007 the Supreme Judicial Court unanimously upheld Laguer's conviction.</p>

<p>In the fall of <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> the LaGuer case became a dominant issue in the race between Republican Lieutenant Governor <a href="../../../k/e/r/Kerry_Healey_5f66.html" title="Kerry Healey">Kerry Healey</a> and Democrat <a href="../../../d/e/v/Deval_Patrick_20bd.html" title="Deval Patrick">Deval Patrick</a> when it was revealed that Patrick had petitioned the parole board in 1998 and 2000 for LaGuer's freedom and had contributed financially to the DNA testing. In his letters to the parole board Patrick characterized LaGuer as "thoughtful and eloquent." He was criticized in two widely used television ads, considered by some analysts to be among the most negative in the 2006 campaign season.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup> In one ad featuring a woman walking alone in a parking garage, the narrator asks, "have you ever heard a woman compliment a rapist?" The ad was widely perceived as backfiring on Healey because of its negative tone. Patrick ultimately won the race by a margin of more than 20 percentage points.</p>
