<p>Heya - apart from expanding and finishing the rest of the tables for the electorates which aren't on the page anyway, I'm thinking that perhaps any concerns over it's suitability for FA status might be apparent to you? The intro looks a lot better now IMHO. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimeshift9_7a50.html" title="User:Timeshift9">Timeshift</a> 18:40, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, I too am disappointed at the general lack of reviewing/criticisms of WP users and the lack of politics-orientated Australians on WP in general... any suggestions as to how we can overcome the barrier to make it achieve FA status? <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimeshift9_7a50.html" title="User:Timeshift9">Timeshift</a> 07:26, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Jägerbombs are fantastic&#160;:-) Hope it was a good one. Thanks for your words, but where does that leave the article? It's stuck in a void IMHO as I believe it represents FA status and feel like i'm a bit stuck between a rock and a hard place with what to do. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimeshift9_7a50.html" title="User:Timeshift9">Timeshift</a> 14:30, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I notice on the last comment for round 1, Tony was pointing out an objection due to 1a and 1d, being (a) "Well written" means that the prose is compelling, even brilliant. (d) "Neutral" means that the article presents views fairly and without bias (see neutral point of view); however, articles need not give minority views equal coverage (see undue weight).</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Ok, so perhaps the prose isn't "brilliant" but I happen to think it's well written, and that it gives neutral and NPOV information to people. Would you agree in that Tony's issue has been addressed or do you think words being used need somewhat of a re-write? <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimeshift9_7a50.html" title="User:Timeshift9">Timeshift</a> 15:26, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi again, i've acted upon suggestions and was hoping for a second look at it. Also, if you're able to make a suggestion for the citation issue im having as per my comment on the above linked page, that would help out as well. Thanks for your continued input! <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimeshift9_7a50.html" title="User:Timeshift9">Timeshift</a> 16:24, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Howdy again, anything else you can see that would prevent the article from becoming featured? <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimeshift9_7a50.html" title="User:Timeshift9">Timeshift</a> 09:01, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi again, as per the fac page, issues are again being raised, "Neutrality of some points, lead section and writing style (standard of prose needs to be "compelling, even brilliant") need work"... who was it you said that does proofreading and rewriting for people, as this is obviously a sticking point with some people. What sentences do you believe in particular are not neutral? I thought I had done a very good job with that... <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimeshift9_7a50.html" title="User:Timeshift9">Timeshift</a> 12:19, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hey michael, can I get you to have a look at the latest objection on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Featured_article_candidates/South_Australian_legislative_election%2C_2006" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Featured_article_candidates/South_Australian_legislative_election%2C_2006" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Featured_article_candidates/South_Australian_legislative_election%2C_2006</a>&#160;? Most references cannot be found in hard copy, I think this user's objection is absolutely unreasonable. How can I resolve this, is there an admin I should go to, to get a judgement on this? <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimeshift9_7a50.html" title="User:Timeshift9">Timeshift</a> 08:15, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Aaaaargh, I really can't be bothered. I know that sounds lazy, but i've put so much work in to it, I really can't be stuffed going through all 80 references and finding them in hard copy/on the news lookup website. I don't spose you wanna do this bit for me, as I have done most of the improvements and fixes for the page before and after becoming an FA candidate? I'd be in your debt and you'd get a lovely barnstar from me&#160;;-) <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimeshift9_7a50.html" title="User:Timeshift9">Timeshift</a> 08:27, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hey, I'd invite you to reread my edits. I didn't claim that FF weren't environmentalists. I merely noted that they hold positions that are strongly opposed by "green activists" (and many more moderate environmentalists, for that matter), and pointed to their policy documents to demonstrate.</p>
<p>All political parties in Australia (with the possible exception of the DLP) are environmentalist to a greater or lesser degree. It's like claiming that all of them are in favour of the free market. What is of interest is how they stand in comparison to community attitudes and other political parties. --<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_Merkel_dd17.html" title="User:Robert Merkel">Robert Merkel</a> 04:28, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hey michael, just wondering if you got that book back to check on the historical SA population? <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimeshift9_7a50.html" title="User:Timeshift9">Timeshift</a> 11:17, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>But does it contain historical population information? Specifically, the population of SA in 1965? <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimeshift9_7a50.html" title="User:Timeshift9">Timeshift</a> 04:51, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I just said! The population of SA in 1965! The reason why is because for the <a href="../../../p/l/a/Playmander.html" title="Playmander">Playmander</a> districts picture, we have the metro and rural populations for 2006, but only the metro population for 1965, not the rural. If I can get the population of SA for 1965, I can subtract 0.7 mil from it to extrapolate the rural population. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimeshift9_7a50.html" title="User:Timeshift9">Timeshift</a> 05:00, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This book that you have that's very detailed, I don't spose it contains upper house results for the SA elections during the 60's and 70's?

<dd>Thanks. In the case it doesn't have it, any other sources you could think of?

<p>It's really nice to see you back and working on a new project again - I was afraid you'd joined the many FA writers who've quit over the last year.

<dd>Depends. If you don't need the history of your edits thusfar to be in the main history, you can just add it over the top. Otherwise, I guess you'd have to get an admin to do a history merge, which I'm not sure how to do, but someone like Cyberjunkie might.</dd>

<dd>While I'm here, one of the things I've noticed about the Playford article is that it doesn't seem to say a whole lot about his social policy.

<dd>That's nice of you to say so, but I hope it's not true. I'm learning new things all the time, and others have their own critical contributions. I'm very busy in real life at the moment, but will try to have a look soon. BTW, I went to univ. college with one of his offspring.

<dd>Heyo. Great job on the Playford IV article andd I could find little to fault it. Other people might be more pedantic though, so I'll mention that some people may not like the red links. When I wrote the original article, I tried to hunt down information to create articles on the electoral districts he represented (Albert &amp; Gumeracha) but without success. We may have to rely on newspaper reports for these. I also note the issue of mentioning the second Thomas Playford as "Thomas Playford I" and so forth. I understand why this is done but I can guess that many wouldn't. I'm unsure what we can do to solve this but I'm willing to hear suggestions. Finally, while this isn't important, I always liked the story about how Playford would find out that the PM of the day would be passing through Adelaide on a train bound for somewhere else. The train would usually stop for refueling at some ungodly hour of the morning and the PM would find himself woken up by Playford who would then harangue him for more funds. The PM would agree just to get rid of Playford and get back to sleep. I thought the story illustrated well just how dedicated Playford was to working for South Australia.</dd>

<p>Fantastic work on your new project so far, already it is looking like a very good piece. We now have in place a very good source of information on South Australia and it's political history on Wikipedia, probably more so than any other source, except for disputedly the Parliamentary website itself. With 1965-current more or less now wrapped up, your contributions on Playford (not to mention Dunstan) to cover a few decades before that is really turning this in to something good&#160;:-) <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimeshift9_7a50.html" title="User:Timeshift9">Timeshift</a> 16:29, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I advised an admin and they didn't seem very interested. The short answer to your questions, would be yes - it'd be nice to have an admin pay attention. The difference this time seems to be that the vast majority of his edits are to certain pop culture articles - a particularly odd obsession with B-grade female film stars. And horror films. Ie, apart from the odd change to Canadian articles he is not being a major disruption. He loves to dab London by adding England after it (ie, London, England), but will often remove Australia from Sydney. I spent a lot of time following his edits and reverting MOST of them as they were predictably poor. A minority were OK and I left them. But i soon got tired of this, particularly as he would just reinstate the changes, i had no interest in Chloe Seivgny or whoever! I built a lot of evidence. But I don't know what to do, he's currently just a poor editor, not a major disruption like before<a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerbabu_4bbf.html" title="User:Merbabu">Merbabu</a> 08:50, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Michael - I agree with you 100%. But I don't need people like Adam Carr to discourage me from assisting you guys with Wikipedia. I don't need to be called a troll and a grub, just for asking a question and/or playing devil's advocate on Labor MP Michael Danby. Is it forbidden for me to inquire about Michael Danby being a former member of the Liberal Party. I was a former member of the Liberal Party, and I recall a former Liberal MP telling me that Danby was a Liberal before becoming Labor. I wanted to find out if this was true. I posed this question on Danby's discussion boards, and what do I get from Adam Carr that I'm a troll and a grub. I ask you Michael, is that a nice thing to say? I'll leave it at there.

<dd>I'm tired of the over-combative culture of this place, and persistently having to argue with ignorant fools. I'm also more and more frustrated with the endless bureaucracy, and the ongoing drift away from actually writing articles, as the number of bureaucratic-types we get start to even more vastly outnumber the people capable of actually doing really good work.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>This, for me, came to a head in December in the form of a few bureaucrats - people who couldn't write even a good stub if you put a gun to their head - trying to chase off no less than five excellent FA writers, because they had, at some point, somehow pissed the bureaucrats off. I hold little hope that anything much will improve across the project, either - the project has passed the point of critical mass, and at least in some cases, the fools are running the asylum.</dd>

<dd>Despite all of the noxiousness, though, I do enjoy the researching and the writing process, and it allows me to do research into various areas of interest and actually put it towards some useful purpose. (As irritating as it is to work on, Wikipedia is still one hell of a resource.) I'm inspired to keep going, too, by the good work of others, particularly on Australian topics. I guess the one saving grace with my areas is that the noxious atmosphere hasn't really infected the Australian articles as such, but I've been dragged into it on meta-issues too often not to be bitter. <a href="../../../r/e/b/User%7ERebecca_4f8f.html" title="User:Rebecca">Rebecca</a> 04:17, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Your version already looks more comprehensive. Maybe it's time to tidy up and merge into article space, even though you know there's still a lot more work. Quick merge would be keep the existing article as lead section of the merged one. There's a few dodgy bits at the top of your Modbury Freeway section (from Elizabeth along the Torrens? - with no metric length). Apart from that, the history needs a couple subheadings, and the empty sections need to be commented or deleted.

<dd>Hmm. Whilat I think it was a bit extreme to block michael considering his long-standing contributions to the wikipedia community, he did perhaps get a bit too angry and subsequently used a couple of golden words in frustration. I think everyone needs to take a step back - for the record, I do see where michael is coming from in regards to the ways admins carry themselves on here, but a few choice words used by michael did not advance the case. I suggest we all take a deep breath and move on - the last thing we need is another person to stop contributing to Australian politics, especially michael. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimeshift9_7a50.html" title="User:Timeshift9">Timeshift</a> 05:22, 21 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I can see why it happened, and agree solidly that the comment left was entirely unsuitable, but it would probably not be an action I would have taken. Michael and I have had the odd runin in the past but he's an editor of good standing and considerable ability who has contributed several FAs. While this should also not be a "get out of jail free" card, I think it should be taken into consideration.

<dd>I'll try and get an unblock. The Pauline Hanson talk page has been the source of some heated comments by many people, including one guy who keeps on referring to his opponents as "Hansonites", and another user who also used the word "mongrel" in an edit summary during the revert - in general I find that Australian editors, and particular on politics articles, including admins, do tend to make frank comments. I think they were in poor taste and unhelpful, but I don't know how a straight block on a person of your contributions is either, as it wasn't to the level of being disruptive. <b><a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen">Blnguyen</a></b> (<a href="../../../b/l/n/User_talk%7EBlnguyen_584f.html" title="User talk:Blnguyen">bananabucket</a>) 05:38, 21 February 2007 (UTC)

He claims he has a free pass on behavioural policies because he doesn't intend to RFA and I guess he's right.

<dd>For the record, I don't go on "anti-Lib trips". It's not my fault the Libs are as you put it "fucking themselves up" and Labor are reasonably clean in comparison to other state governments, i'm just the messenger. Nothing forced me to add the $700 million Workcover liability to the SA article, I always try and maintain to be unbiased. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimeshift9_7a50.html" title="User:Timeshift9">Timeshift</a> 09:50, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I will be most happy to help you out, just bare with me a couple of days I am a bit busy IRL at the moment.<a href="../../../t/e/i/User%7ETeiresias84_aea7.html" title="User:Teiresias84">Teiresias84</a> 14:09, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I saw your post on CJ's talk page and thought I'd give it a quick look over. It looks fantastic, but I've got a couple of suggestions.</p>
<dl>
<dd>1) Would it be possible to get a full list of the LCL reps, both from when it was a faction and then a separate party, perhaps at the bottom of the article?</dd>
<dd>2) I wonder if the "Background" section couldn't be made a bit clearer as to the internal tensions pre-existing the battle over electoral reform; as it stands, its very Millhouse-focused, and I think it would be handy to explain more clearly where his support came from.</dd>
<dd>3) Some of the grammar in a few places is a touch strange; it might be handy to have someone run through and do a copyedit.</dd>
<dd>4) You explain the ideological issues quite well at the time of the LM still being a faction, and I did notice the paragraph about the LM's 1975 platform, but I still think it could be clearer as to if and how the LM differentiated themselves once they became a separate party - perhaps more detail would come in handy.</dd>
<dd>5) I wonder if it couldn't be expanded a touch in a few places, especially the sections covering the period between the split and the re-merger.</dd>
</dl>
<p>That said, as usual for your projects, it's an excellent article, and feel free to ignore any of the above.&#160;:) <a href="../../../r/e/b/User%7ERebecca_4f8f.html" title="User:Rebecca">Rebecca</a> 10:34, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi michael - as per <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Rocksong&amp;diff=113841491&amp;oldid=108982689" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Rocksong&amp;diff=113841491&amp;oldid=108982689" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Rocksong&amp;diff=113841491&amp;oldid=108982689</a> I was wondering if you could also take a quick look at the content. I have had a good read of the Liberal Movement... it is very solid on quality as you are well known for, but I just feel as though it doesn't get deep enough in to personal politics with people concerned as was previously mentioned, which you say is hard to describe as it's hard to get a NPOV form with that area. Is there any way to, because really, personalities, especially within a small party, is more often than not what defines a party. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimeshift9_7a50.html" title="User:Timeshift9">Timeshift</a> 15:16, 9 March 2007 (UTC) Also, would you mind assisting me to be a third party? I've had it with Joestella. I'm not going to get in to another war, but it looks like he wants to get rid of all the leader tables for historical elections too and put that bloody redundant results box there which is simply repeating info further down. do you have a suggestion/compromise/something to come to the table with?
