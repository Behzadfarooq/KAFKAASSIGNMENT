<p>Bubba was born on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_2.html" title="March 2">March 2</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/4/1943.html" title="1943">1943</a> in <a href="../../../b/a/y/Bayou_La_Batre_449d.html" title="Bayou La Batre">Bayou La Batre</a>, <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alabama.html" title="Alabama">Alabama</a>, the eldest of at least six children. He was born with large gums which caused his lower lip to stick out.</p>
<p>His family had a long history of preparing <a href="../../../s/h/r/Shrimp.html" title="Shrimp">shrimp</a>, with his mother, grandmother, and many women before them having cooked shrimp in wealthy people's kitchens. Bubba, who claimed to know everything there was to know about the shrimping business, could (and did) recite every possible way of serving shrimp. He began working on his uncle's shrimping boat at the age of nine. Later, as a young man, he was looking into purchasing his own shrimping boat when he was drafted into the <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._Army_6c52.html" title="U.S. Army">U.S. Army</a>.</p>
<p>Bubba quickly made friends with fellow recruit <a href="../../../f/o/r/Forrest_Gump_%28character%29_0b8e.html" title="Forrest Gump (character)">Forrest Gump</a> when he was the only one who let Forrest sit next to him on the bus (much as Forrest's childhood friend <a href="../../../j/e/n/Jenny_Curran_9ef6.html" title="Jenny Curran">Jenny Curran</a> had done years earlier). Forrest, for his part, was apparently the only one willing to listen to Bubba's endless discussion about shrimp.</p>
<p>Bubba and Forrest were later shipped off to <a href="../../../v/i/e/Vietnam.html" title="Vietnam">Vietnam</a>. Bubba suspected the waters around their base were full of shrimp and could be fished once they "won the war and took everything over".</p>
<p>Bubba, not surprisingly, planned to go into the shrimping business once he got out of the army and suggested he and Forrest purchase a boat together, to which Forrest agreed.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_7.html" title="June 7">June 7</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/6/1967.html" title="1967">1967</a>, however, their platoon was ambushed by the <a href="../../../v/i/e/Viet_Cong_04da.html" title="Viet Cong">Viet Cong</a> and suffered heavy casualties. Bubba was separated from Forrest during the confusion and was badly wounded before Forrest found him. Forrest managed to carry him to safety before the area was hit by <a href="../../../n/a/p/Napalm.html" title="Napalm">napalm</a> from an air strike, but sadly, Bubba died by a river in Forrest's arms before help arrived. Forrest would later say of his friend "Bubba was my best good friend, and even I know that ain't something you can find just around the corner." Bubba's body was flown home and buried near his home in Bayou La Batre.</p>
<p>Forrest would keep Bubba's dream alive, however, by honoring his agreement with Bubba and buying a shrimping boat once his own service in the army was complete. He would later be joined by Bubba and Forrest's commanding officer in Vietnam, <a href="../../../l/i/e/Lieutenant_Dan_Taylor_a350.html" title="Lieutenant Dan Taylor">Lieutenant Dan Taylor</a>. Although they had difficulty catching shrimp at first, it soon became easy after <a href="../../../h/u/r/Hurricane_Carmen_dc1d.html" title="Hurricane Carmen">Hurricane Carmen</a> wrecked every other shrimping boat in the region. With an instant monopoly on shrimp, they quickly became millionaires selling under the name <i>Bubba-Gump Shrimp</i>. They later became even wealthier after Lieutenant Dan invested in the fledgling <a href="../../../a/p/p/Apple_Computer_f26c.html" title="Apple Computer">Apple Computer</a>.</p>
<p>Forrest would also give Bubba's mother what he considered to be Bubba's share (which likely amounted to millions of dollars). She no longer needed to work in anyone's kitchen and instead had people serving her.</p>

<ul>
<li>Though never addressed in the film, the friendship between Bubba (a black man) and Forrest (a white Southerner) would have been quite uncommon in the 1960's</li>
<li><a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Alan_Grier_eae1.html" title="David Alan Grier">David Alan Grier</a> and <a href="../../../d/a/v/Dave_Chappelle_2cbc.html" title="Dave Chappelle">Dave Chappelle</a> both turned down the role of Bubba in the film. Chappelle believed the movie would fail and has since admitted to deeply regretting his decision.</li>
