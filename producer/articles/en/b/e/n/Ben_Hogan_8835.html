<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/n/Ben_Hogan_8835.html" title="Edit section: Early life and character">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Early life and character</span></h2>
<p>Born in <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stephenville%2C_Texas_2177.html" title="Stephenville, Texas">Stephenville, Texas</a> and raised ten miles away in <a href="../../../d/u/b/Dublin%2C_Texas_daf2.html" title="Dublin, Texas">Dublin, Texas</a> he began <a href="../../../c/a/d/Caddy.html" title="Caddy">caddying</a> in the <a href="../../../d/a/l/Dallas.html" title="Dallas">Dallas</a> area at the age of eleven, along with <a href="../../../b/y/r/Byron_Nelson_755d.html" title="Byron Nelson">Byron Nelson</a>, later a tour rival. His early competitive results were not that strong.</p>
<p>Hogan started as a professional golfer in 1931. His early years as a pro were very difficult, and he went broke more than once. He did not win his first pro tournament until 1940, nine years after turning pro. Hogan's wife Valerie believed in him, and this helped see him through the tough years, when he battled a hook, which he later cured.</p>
<p>Hogan was, by most accounts, the greatest golfer of his time, and still stands as one of the greatest of all time. "The Hawk" possessed fierce determination and an iron will, which, when combined with his unquestionable golf skills, formed an aura which itself could intimidate opponents into submission. Hogan's legend also records that he was known as "The Wee Ice Man", or, in some versions, the "Wee Ice Mon". This phrase is thought to have been coined in <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scotland.html" title="Scotland">Scotland</a> during his famous <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Open_Championship_520b.html" title="The Open Championship">British Open</a> victory at <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carnoustie_Golf_Links_4b12.html" title="Carnoustie Golf Links">Carnoustie</a> in 1953, and is a reference to his steely and, by that time, seemingly nerveless demeanor, itself a product of a golf swing he had built that was designed to perform better the more pressure he put it under. Hogan rarely spoke while in competition, and few opponents could avoid wilting under his icy glare.</p>
<p><a name="The_.22Hogan_Slam.22_season" id="The_.22Hogan_Slam.22_season"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/n/Ben_Hogan_8835.html" title="Edit section: The &quot;Hogan Slam&quot; season">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The "Hogan Slam" season</span></h2>
<p>The win at Carnoustie was but a part of Hogan's watershed 1953 season, in which he won five of the six tournaments he entered and the first three <a href="../../../m/e/n/Men%27s_major_golf_championships.html" title="Men's major golf championships">major championships</a> of the year (a feat known as the "Hogan <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grand_Slam_%28golf%29_cee2.html" title="Grand Slam (golf)">Slam</a>").</p>
<p>It still stands among the greatest single seasons in the history of professional golf. Hogan was unable to enter — and possibly win — the 1953 <a href="../../../p/g/a/PGA_Championship_0223.html" title="PGA Championship">PGA Championship</a> (to complete the <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grand_Slam_%28golf%29_cee2.html" title="Grand Slam (golf)">Grand Slam</a>) because its play (July 1-7) overlapped the play of the British Open at Carnoustie (July 6-10), which he won.</p>
<p>It should also be noted that Hogan very often declined to play in the PGA Championship, skipping it more and more often as his career wore on. There were two reasons for this: first was the fact that the PGA Championship was, until 1958, a match-play event, and Hogan's particular skill was "shooting a number", meticulously planning and executing a strategy to achieve a score for a round on a particular course (even to the point of leaving out the 6-iron in the U.S. Open at Merion, saying "there are no 6-iron shots at Merion"); the second reason was that the PGA required several days of 36 holes/day competition, and after the 1949 auto accident, Hogan was barely able to manage 18 holes on his bandaged legs.</p>
<p>His nine career professional Major Championships tie him (with <a href="../../../g/a/r/Gary_Player_2cea.html" title="Gary Player">Gary Player</a>) for fourth all-time, trailing only <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_Nicklaus_bf8c.html" title="Jack Nicklaus">Jack Nicklaus</a> (18), <a href="../../../t/i/g/Tiger_Woods_3ce0.html" title="Tiger Woods">Tiger Woods</a> (12) and <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walter_Hagen_1d9c.html" title="Walter Hagen">Walter Hagen</a> (11).</p>

<p>Between the years of 1938 through 1959, Hogan won 63 professional golf tournaments despite his career's being interrupted in its prime by <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a> and a near-fatal car accident. Hogan and his wife, Valerie, ran head-on into a bus on a fog-shrouded highway east of <a href="../../../v/a/n/Van_Horn%2C_Texas_8cc1.html" title="Van Horn, Texas">Van Horn, Texas</a> in the winter of 1949.</p>
<p>This accident left Hogan with a double-fracture of the <a href="../../../p/e/l/Pelvis.html" title="Pelvis">pelvis</a>, a fractured <a href="../../../c/o/l/Collar_bone.html" title="Collar bone">collar bone</a>, a left <a href="../../../a/n/k/Ankle.html" title="Ankle">ankle</a> fracture, a chipped <a href="../../../r/i/b/Rib.html" title="Rib">rib</a>, and near-fatal <a href="../../../b/l/o/Blood_clot.html" title="Blood clot">blood clots</a>, he would suffer lifelong circulation problems and other physical limitations.

<p>Ben Hogan is widely acknowledged to have been the greatest ball striker ever to have played golf. Although he had a formidable record as a tournament winner, it is this aspect of Hogan which mostly underpins his modern reputation.</p>
<p>Hogan was known to practice more than any other golfer of his contemporaries and is said to have "invented practice". He was also one of the first players to match particular clubs to yardages, or references points around the course such as bunkers or trees, in order to improve his distance control.</p>
<p>Hogan thought that an individual's golf swing was "in the dirt" and that mastering it required plenty of practice and repetition. He is also known to have spent years contemplating the golf swing, trying a range of theories and methods before arriving at the finished method which brought him his greatest period of success.</p>
<p>The young Hogan was badly afflicted by hooking the golf ball. Although slight of build at only 5'7" and 140 pounds (64 kg), attributes that earned him the nickname "<a href="../../../b/a/n/Bantam.html" title="Bantam">Bantam</a>", which he thoroughly disliked, he was very long off the tee early in his career, and even competed in long drive contests.</p>
<p>It has been alleged that Hogan used a "strong" grip, with hands more the right of the club grip in tournament play prior to his accident in 1949, despite often practicing with a "weak" grip, with the back of the left wrist facing the target, and that this limited his success, or, at least, his reliability, up to that date (source: <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Jacobs_b233.html" title="John Jacobs">John Jacobs</a> in his book 'Fifty Greatest Golf Lessons of the Century').</p>
<p>Jacobs alleges that <a href="../../../b/y/r/Byron_Nelson_755d.html" title="Byron Nelson">Byron Nelson</a> told him this information, and furthermore that Hogan developed and used the "strong" grip as a boy in order to be able to hit the ball as far as bigger, stronger contemporaries. This strong grip is what resulted in Hogan hitting the odd disastrous snap hook. Nelson and Hogan both grew up in Fort Worth, and they are known to have played against each other as teenagers.</p>
<p>Hogan's late swing produced the famed "Hogan Fade" ball flight, lower than usual for a great player and from left to right. This ball flight was the result of his using a "draw" type swing in conjunction with a "weak" grip, a combination which all but negated the chance of hitting a hook.</p>
<p>It greatly improved Hogan's accuracy but may have cost him some length. Certainly during his period of greatness Hogan was among the short to mid-length hitting professionals.</p>
<p><a name="Hogan.27s_secret" id="Hogan.27s_secret"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/n/Ben_Hogan_8835.html" title="Edit section: Hogan's secret">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Hogan's secret</span></h3>
<p>Hogan is thought to have developed a "secret" which made his swing nearly automatic. His "secret", a special wrist movement known as "cupping under", was revealed in a 1955 <i><a href="../../../l/i/f/Life_%28magazine%29.html" title="Life (magazine)">Life</a></i> magazine article,. However, many believed Hogan did not reveal all that he knew at the time. It has since been alleged in <i><a href="../../../g/o/l/Golf_Digest_a2d7.html" title="Golf Digest">Golf Digest</a></i> magazine that the second element of Hogan's "secret" was the way in which he used his right knee to initiate the swing and that this right knee movement was critical to the correct operation of the wrist.</p>
<p>Hogan revealed later in life that the "secret" involved cupping the left wrist at the top of the back swing and using a weaker left hand grip (thumb more on top of the grip as opposed to on the right side).</p>
<p>Hogan did this to prevent himself from ever hooking the ball off the tee. By positioning his hands in this manner, he ensured that the club face would be slightly open upon impact, creating a fade (left to right ball flight) as opposed to a draw or hook (right to left ball flight).</p>
<p>This is not something that would benefit all golfers, however, since the average right-handed golfer already slices or fades the ball. The draw is more appealing to amateurs due to its greater carry. However, although he played right-handed as an adult, Hogan was left-handed. His early play with right-handed equipment was using a cross-handed (right hand at the end of the club, left hand below it) grip. In "The Search for the Perfect Golf Swing", researchers Cochran and Stobbs held the opinion that a left-handed person playing right handed would be prone to hook the ball.</p>

<p>Hogan believed that a solid, repeatable golf swing involved only a few essential elements, which, when performed correctly and in sequence, were the essence of the swing. His book <i>Five Lessons: The Modern Fundamentals of Golf</i> is perhaps the most widely-read golf tutorial ever written, although <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harvey_Penick_10f6.html" title="Harvey Penick">Harvey Penick</a>'s "Little Red Book" would also have a claim to that title, and the principles therein are often parroted by modern "swing gurus".</p>
<p>Ben Hogan's Modern Fundamentals: The Five Lessons of Golf was initially released as a five part series beginning in the March 1957 issue of Sports Illustrated magazine, and was printed in book form later in that same year.

<p>Hogan is widely acknowledged to have been the best ball striker ever.</p>
<p>His only rival for this title is the remarkable Canadian professional <a href="../../../m/o/e/Moe_Norman_d71b.html" title="Moe Norman">Moe Norman</a>, whose method was totally unorthodox by comparison but equally effective.</p>
<p>Hogan's ball striking has been described as being of near miraculous caliber by very knowledgeable observers such as <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_Nicklaus_bf8c.html" title="Jack Nicklaus">Jack Nicklaus</a>, who only saw him play some years after his prime, but responded to the question; "Is <a href="../../../t/i/g/Tiger_Woods_3ce0.html" title="Tiger Woods">Tiger Woods</a> the best ball striker you have ever seen?" by answering, "No, no - Ben Hogan, easily" (<i>Golf Digest</i>, April 2004).</p>
<p>Further testimony to Hogan's (and Norman's) status among top golfers is provided by <a href="../../../t/i/g/Tiger_Woods_3ce0.html" title="Tiger Woods">Tiger Woods</a>, who recently said that he wished to "own his (golf) swing" in the same way as <a href="../../../m/o/e/Moe_Norman_d71b.html" title="Moe Norman">Moe Norman</a> and Hogan had. Woods claimed that this pair were the only players ever to have "owned their swings", in that they had total control of it and, as a result, of the ball's flight (<i>Golf Digest</i>, January 2005).</p>
<p>Although his ball striking was perhaps the greatest ever, Hogan is also known to have at times been a very poor putter by professional standards, particularly on slow <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greens.html" title="Greens">greens</a>. The majority of his putting problems developed after his car accident in 1949. Towards the end of his career, he would stand over the ball, in some cases for minutes, before drawing the putter back. It was written in the Hogan Biography, Ben Hogan: An American Life, that Hogan had damaged one of his eyes and that poor vision added to his putting problems.</p>
<p>While he suffered from the "<a href="../../../y/i/p/Yips.html" title="Yips">yips</a>" in his later years, Hogan was known as an effective putter from mid to short range on quick, US Open style surfaces at times during his career.</p>

<p>In 1948 alone, Ben Hogan won 10 tournaments, including the <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._Open_%28golf%29_6ff2.html" title="U.S. Open (golf)">U.S. Open</a> at <a href="../../../r/i/v/Riviera_Country_Club_4457.html" title="Riviera Country Club">Riviera Country Club</a>, a course known as "Hogan's Alley" because of his success there. <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colonial_Country_Club_86c5.html" title="Colonial Country Club">Colonial Country Club</a> in <a href="../../../f/o/r/Fort_Worth_8e5d.html" title="Fort Worth">Fort Worth</a>, a modern PGA tournament venue, is also known as "Hogan's Alley" and may have the better claim to the nickname. <a href="../../../h/o/g/Hogan%27s_Alley_b7aa.html" title="Hogan's Alley">Hogan's Alley</a> is also the name of an FBI training complex, and the term has its origins in the late 19th century in the form of a cartoon strip, only later being matched with courses at which Hogan excelled. The sixth hole at <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carnoustie.html" title="Carnoustie">Carnoustie</a>, a par five from the tee of which Hogan took a famously difficult line off during each of his rounds in the 1953 <a href="../../../o/p/e/Open_Championship_dee5.html" title="Open Championship">Open Championship</a>, has also recently been renamed <a href="../../../h/o/g/Hogan%27s_Alley_b7aa.html" title="Hogan's Alley">Hogan's Alley</a>.</p>

</div>
<p>Prior to the 1949 accident, Hogan never truly captured the hearts of his galleries, despite being one of the better golfers of his time. Perhaps this was due to his cold and aloof on-course persona. But when Ben Hogan shocked and amazed the golf world by returning to tournament golf only 11 months after his accident, and, amazingly, took second place in the 1950 <a href="../../../n/i/s/Nissan_Open_4a42.html" title="Nissan Open">Los Angeles Open</a> after a playoff loss to <a href="../../../s/a/m/Sam_Snead_103b.html" title="Sam Snead">Sam Snead</a>, he was cheered on by ecstatic fans. "His legs simply were not strong enough to carry his heart any longer", famed <a href="../../../s/p/o/Sportswriter.html" title="Sportswriter">sportswriter</a> <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grantland_Rice_ee11.html" title="Grantland Rice">Grantland Rice</a> said of Hogan's near-miss. However, he proved to his critics (and to himself, especially) that he could still win by completing his famous comeback five months later, defeating <a href="../../../l/l/o/Lloyd_Mangrum_4c8c.html" title="Lloyd Mangrum">Lloyd Mangrum</a> and <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Fazio_0ac4.html" title="George Fazio">George Fazio</a> in an 18-hole playoff at <a href="../../../m/e/r/Merion_Golf_Club_6876.html" title="Merion Golf Club">Merion Golf Club</a> to win his second U.S. Open Championship. Hogan went on to achieve what is perhaps the greatest sporting accomplishment in history, limping to 12 more <a href="../../../p/g/a/PGA_Tour_c4c8.html" title="PGA Tour">PGA Tour</a> wins (including 6 <a href="../../../m/e/n/Men%27s_major_golf_championships.html" title="Men's major golf championships">majors</a>) before retiring. In 1951, Hogan entered just five events, but won three of them - the <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Masters_Tournament_25ed.html" title="The Masters Tournament">Masters</a>, the <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._Open_%28golf%29_6ff2.html" title="U.S. Open (golf)">U.S. Open</a>, and the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Championship_of_Golf_4d9e.html" title="World Championship of Golf">World Championship of Golf</a>, and finished second and fourth in his other two starts. He would finish fourth on that season's money list, barely $6,000 behind the season's official money list leader <a href="../../../l/l/o/Lloyd_Mangrum_4c8c.html" title="Lloyd Mangrum">Lloyd Mangrum</a>, who played over 20 events. That year also saw the release of a biopic starring <a href="../../../g/l/e/Glenn_Ford_6ae7.html" title="Glenn Ford">Glenn Ford</a> as Hogan, called <i>Follow the Sun: The Ben Hogan Story</i>. <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0043550/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0043550/" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> He even received a <a href="../../../t/i/c/Ticker-tape_parade.html" title="Ticker-tape parade">ticker-tape parade</a> in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_City_1428.html" title="New York City">New York City</a> upon his return from winning the 1953 <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Open_Championship_520b.html" title="The Open Championship">British Open Championship</a>, the only time he played the event.</p>
<p>Hogan played on two U.S. <a href="../../../r/y/d/Ryder_Cup_daba.html" title="Ryder Cup">Ryder Cup</a> teams, 1947 and 1951, and captained the team three times, 1947, 1949, and 1967, famously claiming on the latter occasion to have brought the "twelve best golfers in the world" to play in the competition. This line was used by subsquent Ryder Cup captain <a href="../../../r/a/y/Raymond_Floyd_8298.html" title="Raymond Floyd">Raymond Floyd</a> in 1989, although on that occasion the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> was beaten by Team Europe at <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_De_Vere_Belfry_738d.html" title="The De Vere Belfry">The Belfry</a>.</p>
<p>Hogan won the <a href="../../../v/a/r/Vardon_Trophy_8478.html" title="Vardon Trophy">Vardon Trophy</a> for lowest scoring average three times: 1940, 1941, and 1948. In 1953, Hogan won the <a href="../../../h/i/c/Hickok_Belt_e71c.html" title="Hickok Belt">Hickok Belt</a> as the top professional athlete of the year in the United States.</p>
<p>Ben Hogan later went on to found a golf club manufacturing company (now owned by the Callaway Golf Company), and his clubs, or at least ones that carry his name, are still played today. Unlike the great players of the 1960s and 1970s, Ben Hogan never competed on the <a href="../../../c/h/a/Champions_Tour_696b.html" title="Champions Tour">senior golf tour</a>, as that circuit did not exist until he was in his late sixties.</p>
<p>He was inducted into the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Golf_Hall_of_Fame_3099.html" title="World Golf Hall of Fame">World Golf Hall of Fame</a> in 1974. In 1976, Ben Hogan was voted the <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Jones_Award_e2cf.html" title="Bob Jones Award">Bob Jones Award</a>, the highest honor given by the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Golf_Association_b3e5.html" title="United States Golf Association">United States Golf Association</a> in recognition of distinguished sportsmanship in golf.

<ul>
<li>At age 9, Hogan's father Chester committed suicide. By some accounts Chester committed suicide in front of him, which some (including Hogan biographer James Dodson) have cited as the cause of his introverted personality in later years. <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/jun2004/nf20040618_7190_db028.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/jun2004/nf20040618_7190_db028.htm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Though many accounts hold that Hogan was born left-handed, he wrote right-handed, and specifically denied this story in a 1987 interview: "No, that's one of those things that's always been written, but it's an absolute myth."
<ul>
<li>Note: In his book Five Lessions The Modern Fundamentals of Golf (published 1957) he writes in the chapter 1 The Grip, that he was born left-handed and that was the normal way to things for him, but he swithed over doing things right-handed as a boy. He also writes that he started golf left-handed, because the first club he got hold of was a lefty 5-iron. So it is questionable if the comment in the 1987 interview has been interpreted correctly.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Ben Hogan was known for sending short letter and notes to friends and signing them "Henny Bogan".</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Though they were rivals on the golf course, Ben Hogan and Byron Nelson were travelling partners for many years on the PGA tour in their early careers. Their wives were also very close and remained dear friends until Louise Nelson's death.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
