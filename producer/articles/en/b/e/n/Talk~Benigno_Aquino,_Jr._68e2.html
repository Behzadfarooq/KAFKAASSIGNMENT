<hr />
<p>To quote, "Although Ninoy Aquino was recognized as the most prominent and most outspoken critic of the Marcos dictatorship, he was regarded by many, in the years prior to martial law, as representative of the entrenched familial bureaucracy which, to this day, still predominates Philippine politics." This part of the article is biased and needs to be suppressed.</p>
<hr />
<dl>
<dd>Actually, that's one of the more balanced parts. It mentions both good and bad about him. <a href="../../../m/d/o/User%7EMdotley_dfca.html" title="User:Mdotley">Mdotley</a> 17:27, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<hr />
<p>I don't see any bias. Ninoy Aquino came from political families: grandfather and father both served in high positions in government. His wife is from a rich and powerful clan. He himself had been "entrenched" in politics, having served as counselor, mayor, vice-governor, governor, senator, and had it not been for Marcos, would have been president. His brother, sister and now his son ran and won seats in Congress and the senate. The political system of "inheriting government positions" is a traditional practice in my country, and is widely accepted by the masses, surely a detriment to progress. In the Philippines a candidate to a government position with "no name", no money, and no political machinery, does not stand a chance of being elected.</p>

<p>I moved the page back from Benigno Aquino Jr. because he is more widely known under this name. As far as I know his father was not famous (or if he was, it's not in the article). - <a href="../../../h/e/p/User%7EHephaestos_c32a.html" title="User:Hephaestos">Hephaestos</a> 08:03 27 Jul 2003 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Actually, he's more widely known as Ninoy Aquino. If you're going to use Benigno Aquino, then it should properly have the Jr. in it. It makes no harm in having <a href="../../../b/e/n/Benigno_Aquino_79d8.html" title="Benigno Aquino">Benigno Aquino</a> redirect to <a href="../../../b/e/n/Benigno_Aquino_Jr._c9e9.html" title="Benigno Aquino Jr.">Benigno Aquino Jr.</a> It actually adds info for the casual researcher. I know Benigno Aquino Sr. is not known, but his son, Benigno Aquino III is a congress representative from Tarlac (and might possibly have his own article in the future). —<a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESeav_e019.html" title="User:Seav">seav</a> 08:09 27 Jul 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That's a hard one (I'm beginning to think there are a lot of hard ones *grin*). I didn't know about his son either, but that sounds like a mitigating circumstance.

<p>The discussion regarding Ninoy's imprisonment, military trial and hunger strike are all placed under the topic "On the Road to Martial Law", even though all these events occurred after martial law was declared. Maybe the next topic, "Batasang Pambansa elections and heart bypass surgery" can be renamed "Imprisonment, 1978 elections and heart bypass surgery" and the discussion of post-1972 events be transposed therein?

<p>In the following snippet from the article:<i>On May 8, 1980, Imelda Marcos came to Ninoy's hospital room. She asked him if he would like to leave that evening for the U.S., but not before agreeing on two covenants: 1.) That if he leaves, he will return;</i> is 1.) correct?--<a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJondel_fb32.html" title="User:Jondel">Jondel</a> 04:12, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>This is known as a Marcos (Imelda being a Marcos) "double talk" or as we refer in the Philippines "double speak" (a well-known Marcos ploy). She was granting him a "leave" on condition that he would return, when all the while she was sure that he would not, at least not in the near future because of a sentence condemning Aquino to death by the military tribunal. He returned anyway, much to the shock of Imelda and cohorts, and the rest is history.</p>

<p>Is it appropriate to use his nickname so frequently instead of his family name? Seems to diminish the authority of the article, which already has a bit of a hagiographic tone.</p>
<p>Also: this article needs a lot more citations. One example is the end of the "I will go back" section.</p>
<p>A few too many weasel words (critics say, etc.).</p>

<p>Aquino was convicted by then president Marcos of Murder. Pls note that this not a category for murderers nor or does it imply that Ninoy was a murderer.--<a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJondel_fb32.html" title="User:Jondel">Jondel</a> 08:05, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Aquino was convicted of murder by a non-legitimate, Marcos-controlled military tribunal. The conviction had no legal basis, no investigation was made and no legal recourse for Aquino. The link to "filipinos convicted murder" without an explanation, is, in my opinion, quite misleading.<a href="../../../k/a/e/User%7EKaElin_8336.html" title="User:KaElin">KaElin</a> 23:39, 9 September 2006 (UTC)kaElin</p>
