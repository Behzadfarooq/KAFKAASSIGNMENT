<p>Warfield was born near <a href="../../../l/e/x/Lexington%2C_Kentucky_68e8.html" title="Lexington, Kentucky">Lexington, Kentucky</a> on November 5, 1851. His parents were William and Mary Cabell (Breckinridge) Warfield, originally from Virginia and quite wealthy.

<p>Like many children born into a wealthy family, Warfield's childhood education was private. Warfield entered <a href="../../../p/r/i/Princeton_University_960f.html" title="Princeton University">Princeton University</a> in <a href="../../../1/8/6/1868.html" title="1868">1868</a> and graduated in <a href="../../../1/8/7/1871.html" title="1871">1871</a> with high honors. Although Warfield studied <a href="../../../m/a/t/Mathematics.html" title="Mathematics">mathematics</a> and <a href="../../../s/c/i/Science.html" title="Science">science</a> in college, while travelling in Europe he decided to study theology, surprising even many of his closest friends. He entered <a href="../../../p/r/i/Princeton_Seminary_a1ca.html" title="Princeton Seminary">Princeton Seminary</a> in <a href="../../../1/8/7/1873.html" title="1873">1873</a>, in order to train for ministry as a <a href="../../../p/r/e/Presbyterian.html" title="Presbyterian">Presbyterian</a> minister.

<p>For a short time in <a href="../../../1/8/7/1876.html" title="1876">1876</a> he preached in Presbyterian churches in <a href="../../../c/o/n/Concord%2C_Kentucky_f6ac.html" title="Concord, Kentucky">Concord, Kentucky</a> and <a href="../../../d/a/y/Dayton%2C_Ohio_88d9.html" title="Dayton, Ohio">Dayton, Ohio</a> as a "supply pastor" — the latter church calling him to be their ordained minister (which he politely refused). In late <a href="../../../1/8/7/1876.html" title="1876">1876</a> Warfield and his new wife moved to <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germany.html" title="Germany">Germany</a> where he studied under Ernst Luthardt and <a href="../../../f/r/a/Franz_Delitzsch_59de.html" title="Franz Delitzsch">Franz Delitzsch</a>. Warfield was the assistant pastor of First Presbyterian Church in <a href="../../../b/a/l/Baltimore%2C_Maryland_9c87.html" title="Baltimore, Maryland">Baltimore, Maryland</a> for a short time. Then he became an instructor at Western Theological Seminary, which is now called <a href="../../../p/i/t/Pittsburgh_Theological_Seminary_1442.html" title="Pittsburgh Theological Seminary">Pittsburgh Theological Seminary</a>. He was ordained on <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_26.html" title="April 26">April 26</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/7/1879.html" title="1879">1879</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/8/8/1881.html" title="1881">1881</a> Warfield wrote a joint article with <a href="../../../a/2E/_/A._A._Hodge_ae0d.html" title="A. A. Hodge">A. A. Hodge</a> on the <a href="../../../b/i/b/Biblical_inspiration.html" title="Biblical inspiration">inspiration</a> of the <a href="../../../b/i/b/Bible.html" title="Bible">Bible</a>. It drew attention because of its scholarly and forceful defense of the inerrancy of the Bible. In many of his writings, Warfield attempted to demonstrate that the doctrine of <a href="../../../b/i/b/Biblical_inerrancy.html" title="Biblical inerrancy">Biblical inerrancy</a> was simply <a href="../../../o/r/t/Orthodoxy.html" title="Orthodoxy">orthodox</a> <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian.html" title="Christian">Christian</a> <a href="../../../d/o/c/Doctrine.html" title="Doctrine">teaching</a>, and not merely a concept invented in the <a href="../../../n/i/n/Nineteenth_century.html" title="Nineteenth century">nineteenth century</a>. His passion was to refute the <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberalism.html" title="Liberalism">liberal</a> element within Presbyterianism and within Christianity at large.</p>
<p>Throughout his life, he continued to write books and articles, which are still widely read today.</p>

<p>In August of <a href="../../../1/8/7/1876.html" title="1876">1876</a> Warfield married Annie Pierce Kinkead. Soon afterward they visited <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germany.html" title="Germany">Germany</a>. During their time there, Annie was struck by lightning and was permanently paralyzed. Benjamin continued to care for her until her death in <a href="../../../1/9/1/1915.html" title="1915">1915</a>, managing to fit his work as a theologian with his role as caregiver. They had no children.</p>
<p>The actual events that led to Annie's paralysis are still unclear. Some believe that she may have suffered some form of mental or psychological disability.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/n/Benjamin_Breckinridge_Warfield_4a24.html" title="Edit section: The Bible">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Bible</span></h3>
<p>During his tenure, his primary thrust (and that of the seminary) was an authoritative view of the Bible. This view was held in contrast to the <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religious_ecstasy.html" title="Religious ecstasy">emotionalism</a> of the <a href="../../../r/e/v/Revival_meeting.html" title="Revival meeting">revival</a> movements, the <a href="../../../r/a/t/Rationalism.html" title="Rationalism">rationalism</a> of <a href="../../../h/i/g/Higher_criticism.html" title="Higher criticism">higher criticism</a>, and the heterodox teachings of various <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_religious_movement.html" title="New religious movement">New religious movements</a> that were emerging. The seminary held fast to the <a href="../../../r/e/f/Reformed.html" title="Reformed">Reformed</a> confessional tradition — that is, it faithfully followed the <a href="../../../w/e/s/Westminster_Confession_of_Faith_a7dc.html" title="Westminster Confession of Faith">Westminster Confession of Faith</a>.</p>
<p>Warfield believed that <a href="../../../m/o/d/Modernist_Christianity_7ce8.html" title="Modernist Christianity">modernist</a> theology was problematic, since it relied upon the thoughts of the Biblical interpreter rather than upon the divine author of Scripture. He therefore preached and believed the doctrine of <i><a href="../../../s/o/l/Sola_scriptura.html" title="Sola scriptura">sola scriptura</a></i> — that the Bible is God's inspired word and is sufficient for the Christian to live his or her faith.</p>
<p>Much of Warfield's work centered upon the Bible's "<a href="../../../b/i/b/Biblical_inspiration.html" title="Biblical inspiration">inspiration</a>" by God — that while the authors of the Bible were men, the ultimate author was God himself. The growing influence of modernist theology denied that the Bible was inspired, and alternative theories of the origin of the Christian faith were being explored.</p>
<p>After comparing <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grammar.html" title="Grammar">grammatical</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/n/Linguistics.html" title="Linguistics">linguistic</a> styles found within the Bible itself, modernist scholars suggested that because the human authors had clearly contributed to the writing of the biblical text, the Bible was written by people alone, not God. Warfield was a central figure in responding to this line of thinking by arguing that the supernatural work of the <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holy_Spirit_e4ea.html" title="Holy Spirit">Holy Spirit</a> did not lead to a form of "mechanical" inspiration (whereby the human authors merely wrote down what God dictated to them) but one in which the human author's intellect was fully able to express itself linguistically, while at the same time being supervised by the Holy Spirit to ensure its inspiration. This approach is essential to understanding the view of inspiration held by many Reformed and <a href="../../../e/v/a/Evangelicalism.html" title="Evangelicalism">Evangelical</a> Christians today.</p>

<p>Warfield was a conservative critic of much religious <a href="../../../r/e/v/Revivalism.html" title="Revivalism">revivalism</a> that was popular in America at the time. He believed that the teachings and experience of this movement were too subjective and therefore too shallow for deep Christian faith. His book <i>Counterfeit Miracles</i> advocated <a href="../../../c/e/s/Cessationism.html" title="Cessationism">cessationism</a> over and against miracles after the time of the <a href="../../../t/w/e/Twelve_Apostles_56fc.html" title="Twelve Apostles">Apostles</a>. Such attacks did not go unnoticed, and even today Warfield is criticized by proponents of revivalism in the <a href="../../../p/e/n/Pentecostal.html" title="Pentecostal">Pentecostal</a> and <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charismatic_movement.html" title="Charismatic movement">Charismatic</a> movements. For example, <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_Deere_3a4f.html" title="Jack Deere">Jack Deere</a> wrote <i>Surprised by the Power of the Spirit</i> with the intention of refuting <i>Counterfeit Miracles</i>. Warfield's book was published before the worldwide spread of <a href="../../../p/e/n/Pentecostalism.html" title="Pentecostalism">Pentecostalism</a> and addressed the issue of false claims to the possession of miraculous gifts under the headings, "Patristic and Mediǣval Marvels", "Roman Catholic Miracles", "Irvingite Gifts", "Faith-Healing" and "Mind-Cure".</p>
<p>His book <i>Perfectionism</i> is a detailed critique of what he saw as false theories of <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sanctification.html" title="Sanctification">sanctification</a>. It includes an analysis of the <a href="../../../h/i/g/Higher_Life_movement_4e85.html" title="Higher Life movement">Higher Life movement</a> and the <a href="../../../k/e/s/Keswick_Convention_68d4.html" title="Keswick Convention">Keswick movement</a>, as well as a rebuttal of earlier schools of thought, such as that of Asa Mahan and <a href="../../../o/b/e/Oberlin_College_8aa2.html" title="Oberlin College">Oberlin College</a>, and in particular the theology of <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_G._Finney_0b96.html" title="Charles G.

<p>Underpinning much of Warfield's theology was his adherence to <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calvinism.html" title="Calvinism">Calvinism</a> as espoused by the <i>Westminster Confession of Faith</i>. It is sometimes forgotten that, in his battles against Modernism on the one hand, and against revivalism on the other, he was simply expressing the Reformed faith when applied to certain situations.</p>
<p>It was Warfield's belief that the 16th century Reformers, as well as the 17th century Confessional writers, were merely summarizing the content and application of scripture. New revelations, whether from the minds of celebrated scholars or popular revivalists, were therefore inconsistent with these confessional statements (and therefore inconsistent with Scripture). Throughout his ministry, Warfield contended that modern world events and thinking could never render such confessions obsolete. Such an attitude still prevails today in many <a href="../../../r/e/f/Reformed.html" title="Reformed">Reformed</a> churches and Christians who embrace <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calvinism.html" title="Calvinism">Calvinism</a>.</p>

<p>Warfield had an unusual view of <a href="../../../d/a/r/Darwinism.html" title="Darwinism">Darwinism</a> for a conservative in his day. Unlike most people who believed that the Bible's creation narrative was meant to be read literally, he was willing to accept that <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Darwin_74f3.html" title="Charles Darwin">Darwin</a>'s theory was true, provided that one believe that God was the one who guided the process of <a href="../../../n/a/t/Natural_selection.html" title="Natural selection">natural selection</a> in order to create the various <a href="../../../s/p/e/Species.html" title="Species">species</a>. This came from his avid interest in amateur science and led to his being both a convinced Calvinist and a convinced <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theistic_evolution.html" title="Theistic evolution">theistic evolutionist</a>. He was thus one of the first theologians that tried to bridge the gap between Christian faith and emerging <a href="../../../s/e/c/Secular.html" title="Secular">secular</a> <a href="../../../s/c/i/Science.html" title="Science">science</a>.</p>

<p>Unlike his contemporaries at Princeton, and perhaps due to his invalid wife, Warfield never cared much for churchmanship. While he was certainly supportive of political moves within various churches to strengthen and push conservative theology, he was never interested in the actual process itself, preferring to use his work at Princeton to influence future generations of Presbyterian ministers.</p>
