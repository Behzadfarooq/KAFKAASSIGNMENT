<p>[[User:Ben MacDui/Scotland/Geography redraft Mais oui!,</p>
<p>Here is a first draft, with one deliberate mistake.</p>
<p>(NB I am continuing to edit and am now using the 'alternative version' which puts geology and geomorphology together.)</p>
<p>The net result is similar in size to the existing piece, excluding references. Not absolutely everything is referenced, but hopefully it passes muster. Better than none at all anyway.</p>
<p>Structural issues: the more I look at it, the more incoherent [Scotland] is (ambiguity intended).</p>
<p>I have incorporated 'demographics' into 'Human Geography' to avoid repitition. Language and religion are, absurdly, sub-sections of demographics. Amend to sections.</p>
<p>'Subdivisions' should be renamed 'Geographical sub-divisions' and placed within the 'Geography' heading.</p>
<p>I have created a short flora and fauna section. I am thinking of merging this with climate. A Scotland article without the wild cat is a poor show.</p>
<p>Most of the stuff I removed is at the end for ease of reference. I will delete it prior to offering a more public viewing.</p>
<p>Do you think the National archive ref will wind the nationalists up unduly? It's quite accidental.</p>
<p>Why do we have endless ramblings about long-forgotten medieval kings in the main article (very little of it referenced), and nothing about Watt, Kelvin and Fleming? Or Hume, or Adam Smith. Nothing that I can see about renewable energy either - I will add something elsewhere although I can see why trying to keep track of 'Scotland' could be a wearisome task. I'm back off to the [Flannan Isles asap!</p>

<p>Scotland comprises the northern third of the island of [[Great Britain, which lies off the coast of north west [[Europe. The total land mass is 78,772 [[square kilometres|km<sup>2</sup> (30,414 [[square mile|mi<sup>2</sup>).<sup id="_ref-Whitaker_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Whitaker" title="">[1]</a></sup> Scotland's only land border is with [[England, and runs for 96 [[kilometres (60 [[miles) between the [[River Tweed on the east coast and the [[Solway Firth in the west. The [[Atlantic Ocean borders the west coast and the [[North Sea is to the east. The island of [[Ireland] lies only 30 kilometres (20 mi) from the south western peninsula of [[Kintyre], [[Norway] is 400 kilometres (250 mi) to the north east, and the [[Faroes] and [[Iceland] are to the north.</p>

<p>{{main|Geology of Scotland The whole of Scotland was covered by ice sheets during the [[Pleistocene [[ice ages and the landscape is much affected by [[glaciation. From a [[geology|geological perspective the country has three main sub-divisions. The [[Highlands and Islands lie to the north and west of the [[Highland Boundary Fault, which runs from [[Arran to [[Stonehaven. This part of Scotland is largely comprised of ancient rocks from the [[Cambrian and [[Precambrian which were uplifted during the later [[Caledonian Orogeny. These foundations are interspersed with many [[igneous intrusions of a more recent age, the remnants of which have formed mountain massifs such as the [[Cairngorms and [[Skye [[Cuillins. A significant exception to the above are the fossil-bearing beds of [[Old Red Sandstones found principally along the [[Moray Firth coast. The [[Scottish Highlands|Highlands are generally mountainous and are bisected by the [[Great Glen. The highest elevations in the [[British Isles are found here, including (though it pains me to admit it) [[Ben Nevis, the highest peak at 1,344 [[metres (4,409 [[Foot (unit of length)|ft). Scotland has over 790 islands, divided into four main groups: [[Shetland Islands|Shetland, [[Orkney Islands|Orkney, and the [[Hebrides, sub-divided into the [[Inner Hebrides and [[Outer Hebrides. There are numerous bodies of [[freshwater including [[Loch Lomond and [[Loch Ness.</p>
<p>The [[Central Lowlands is a [[rift valley mainly comprised of [[Paleozoic formations. Many of these sediments have economic significance for it is here that the coal and iron bearing rocks that fuelled the industrial revolution are to be found. This area has also experienced intense [[vulcanism, [[Arthur's Seat, Edinburgh|Arthur’s Seat in [[Edinburgh being the remnant of a once much larger [[volcano active in the [[Carboniferous period some 300 million years ago. Also known as the Midland Valley, this area is relatively low-lying, although even here hills such as the [[Ochil Hills|Ochils and [[Campsie Fells are rarely far from view.</p>
<p>The Southern Uplands are a range of hills almost 200&#160;km (125 miles) long, interspersed with broad valleys. They lie south of a second fault line running from [[Stranraer towards [[Dunbar. The geological foundations are largely comprised of [[Silurian deposits laid down some 4-500 million years ago.<sup id="_ref-Keay_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Keay" title="">[4]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[5]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>

<p>The [[Central Lowlands|Central Belt is where most of the population reside and the most industry is located. The [[Glasgow conurbation is to the west whilst the other three main cities of [[Edinburgh, [[Dundee and [[Aberdeen lie on the east coast. The Highlands are sparsely populated although the main town of [[Inverness and environs has experienced rapid growth in recent years. In general only the more accessible and larger islands retain human populations and fewer than 90 are currently inhabited. The Southern Uplands are essentially rural in nature and dominated by agriculture and forestry.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[7]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>

<dd>I have a copy of Murray, W.H. (1977) <i>The Companion Guide to the West Highlands of Scotland</i>. London. Collins, which may provide some verification of a few facts and perhaps some additional evocative sentences. I don't want to start making unsolicited edits in the middle of a GA process as I have none of the history of the article. He makes the following statements:</dd>
</dl>
<p>From the car park in Glen Nevis "the open slope on your left runs four thousand feet to the summit of Ben Nevis at an angle of thirty-five degrees - the longest and steepest hill-slope in Britain."</p>
<p>"the Nevis gorge is the finest example of its kind in in Great Britain. It is only four hundred feet high, but the immense walls to its right and left are wooded in pine, oak birch and rowan. These sprout in profusion from the crags, giving the rock gorge a Himalayan character not seen elsewhere in this country."</p>
<p>The Steall waterfall "is 350 feet high and one of the three biggest in Scotland."</p>
<p>From the summit, "On exceptional days, Ireland can be dimly discerned a hundred and twenty miles away."</p>
<p>He insists that although it has "aroused much conjecture" the name Ben Nevis "derives from a Gaelic compound word Beinn-neamh-bhathais. 'Neamh' means the heavens or clouds; 'bathais', the top of a man's head (between crown and brow). A free translation is 'The mountain with its head in the clouds'."</p>
<p>"Atmospheric condensation tends to cover the summit with a cloud-cap when the rest of the sky is clear, hence it gets an average of only two hours of bright sunshine per day and an annual rainfall of 157 inches. The mean monthly temperature is half a degrees below freezing point. Snow may thus fall on the mountain at any day or month of the year."</p>
<p>"The summit area has an average of two hundred and sixty one gales per annum. Many of these reach hurricane force."</p>
<p>"The old Observatory near the cliff's edge was built in 1883 .... and closed down in 1904."</p>
<p>I suspect that an early un-referenced version of the article may have been based in part on this book.</p>
