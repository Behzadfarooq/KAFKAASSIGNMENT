<p>Hi Ben. I noticed your edits and page moves on Chicoutimi—Saguenay electoral district. Please do not mess at this time with the page titles for electoral districts... People involved with creating these articles are quite aware that while Emdashes are correctly used for the separator, the use of these (and ndashes as well) are deprecated in article titles, although a consensus has not yet emerged on how to deal with this. You have now created a series of page moves that cannot be undone without administrator privileges, which will cause a nuisance when automated procedures are used later to standardize the names. The problem is that some district names properly have both hyphens and mdashes, especially for Quebec districts (a fictional example: St-Henri—St-Denis) <a href="../../../f/a/w/User%7EFawcett5_8093.html" title="User:Fawcett5">Fawcett5</a> 15:40, 9 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sory about that. I won't do it again. I saw what I thought was an error and then it got out of hand—and it may not have been an error. (By changing it to "Chicoutimi–Saguenay", I was going by the typography rule that symmetric relations are "hyphenated" with an en-dash rather than a hyphen.) Anyway, I'll stop. —<a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenFrantzDale_c7e5.html" title="User:BenFrantzDale">BenFrantzDale</a> 20:14, May 9, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It should not be followed by a comma unless the sense requires one, to introduce a parenthesis for instance. "He attacked reactionaries, i.e. those whose opinions differed from his own," BUT "He attacked reactionaries, i.e., it would seem, those whose opinions etc."</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Non-latinists are apt to think tht it does not matter whether e.g. or i.e. is used.</dd>

<dd>Italics, and a following comma, are unnecessary, but not wrong. Both abbreviations should be reserved for footnotes or very concise writing; in open prose it is better to write for example or for instance; namely or that is to say.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I would say that both of the above examples need the comma in as much as "i.e." can be read as "that is". We have "He attacked reactionaries, that is those whose opinions differed from his own". Without the comma after "that is", I think this sentence isn't <i>defining</i></dd>

<p>reactionaries", it's just saying that reactionaries are "those wose opinions..." whereas I would read "He attacked reactionaries, that is, those whose opinions differed from his own" as <i>defining</i> "reactionaries" at a higher level.</p>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The second version, the one with the parenthetical "it would seem", is a <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_herring.html" title="Red herring">red herring</a> because the commas on both sides of "it would seem" are there to make it parenthetical; after removing "it would seem", it is unclear if "i.e." is followed by a comma. —<a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenFrantzDale_c7e5.html" title="User:BenFrantzDale">BenFrantzDale</a> 18:45, 22 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't understand why you feel this isn't encylopedic. The factor-label method of using dimensional analysis for conversion of units has been in use by chemists and engineers for decades. Do a Google search on the keywords and phrases "units conversion", "factor-label", "dimensional analysis" and you will get a great many hits including very many high school and university course sources. The Wikipedia already includes an article on the more formal and rigorous use of <a href="../../../d/i/m/Dimensional_analysis.html" title="Dimensional analysis">dimensional analysis</a> but it doesn't include the technique of conversion of units ... which I believe merits an article of its own.<br /></dd>

<p>Hello Ben,</p>
<p>Thank you for your note.</p>
<p>With reference to the two hazards sections of the PETE article and the placeholder to refer to discussion page.</p>
<p>1) My understanding from <a href="../../../r/e/v/WP%7EREVERT_1079.html" title="WP:REVERT">WP:REVERT</a> is that "reverting is used primarily for fighting vandalism" and <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVandalism_70f0.html" title="Wikipedia:Vandalism">Wikipedia:Vandalism</a> "Any good-faith effort to improve the encyclopedia, even if misguided or ill-considered, is not vandalism." Ben if you find my placeholder is vandalism according to this official policy please explain in detail why if not please replace the placeholder and let the discussion unfold on the disscussion page.</p>
<dl>
<dd>1a) As what is in my opinion a suboptimal alternative perhaps you could find a way to empower the discussion from the article page that you find more appropriate than the placeholder I edited.</dd>
</dl>
<p>2) Please be more specific about how the two hazard sections moved to discussion are inconsistent with wikipedia policy. (FYI as I recall at least two others have copy edited in that area including User:217.136.253.220 who added a well cited and linked section headed "No hazards in food contact applications demonstrated"</p>
<p>3) Please consider saying more about yourself on your user page.</p>
<p>4) When I work on an article I really try focus on asking questions (I need to learn the comment tags), clarifying, re writing in a neutral voice, adding information as opposed to deleting or removing information</p>
<p>FYI I believe that this is a <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_interest.html" title="Public interest">public interest</a> and a <a href="../../../r/i/g/Right_to_know.html" title="Right to know">right to know</a> issue as billions of people seem to be eating and drinking foods that have been in intimate contacte with PETE and other polymers. I percieve a structural obstacle to the disemmination of this type of information that may even be extending to the exact situation which we find ourselves in now. I intend to help disemminate the little that is know from reliable sources about the potential food contact hazards of plastics.</p>

<dd>I reverted your change and added mention of "Metropolis Monte Carlo simulation" which is a particular algorithm. Still, unless that particular versiono fmolecular modeling is enough to fill an article, I think the actual title should be general so there is a place for information on all molecular Monte Carlo methods.

<p>Ben, I absolutely love the pigeonhole picture, and was in the middle of placing it up for <a href="../../../p/i/c/Wikipedia%7EPicture_peer_review_c4f6.html" title="Wikipedia:Picture peer review">featured picture peer review</a> when a thought struck me, causing a mild concussion. After recovering, I came here to discuss it: would it be in any way feasible to take another 'pigeon picture,' but with 10 pigeons in 9 holes, so that one contains 2 pigeons? The two pictures together would then make a completely awesome demonstration of the principle. Let me know; if not, I'll just continue the process with the current picture, since it's still both adorable and cool. Mineralogy 08:14, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm sory to hear about your <a href="../../../c/o/n/Concussion.html" title="Concussion">concussion</a>; I hope you are recovering well. Thanks for your interest in the picture. I don't have access to pigeons in general so I can't make up an <i>n</i>=10 picture easitly. I suspect you could take one at any good zoo, though, at least if you waited long enough for the pigeons to arrange themselves like that, which might take a while. (Also the picture I took could do with being reproduced; it was done in low light through glass so is grainy and low-contrast.) <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenFrantzDale_c7e5.html" title="User:BenFrantzDale">—Ben FrantzDale</a> 11:21, 31 May 2006 (UTC)

<p>Have to go now. Will look back at this later today/tonight.</p>
<p>Are there and specific problems you have with the content relative to correct/incorrect knowledge?</p>

<dd>Ben, Thanks again for your help. WikiPedia has been a Godsend as I'm constantly asked by newer programmers the difference between MII, II and VI and funcitonal normalization. I want to focus on getting the knowledge and content in the articles complete as well as finalize the articles in the WikiPedia style.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>After the code and references are in I believe their should not be any knowledge disputes. The initial versions may be a little bloated (I'm still trying to be minimal, closed, complete) and poor style but the in final editing process I'll cut and reformat as per WikiPedia conventions.After that others can take up the banner (as I have limited time) but I expect everything of core relevance should be in the articles.</dd>

<p>Ben,</p>
<p>Thanks for your input on the VI article. Please hold off on the clean up for a few more days.</p>
<p>In the mean time I'd like to discuss content thesis and citations with you since you actually seem like a nice guy who can focus on the problem professionally.</p>
<p>I have citations, etc. but you may wish to review codeproject.com.</p>
<p>I have over 1000 projects downloaded from that site (no not kidding) and I think its the best test of current industry practice aside from the books, etc.</p>
<p>Will get back to you in a few days (Wednesday, Thursday) to discuss the language independence aspect along with virtual code elements and the virtual control mechanism.</p>
<p>Have moved some other content out to other sections (still in progress). If you could focus on the the questions I posted in the discusssion of Virtual Inheritance relative to content I think we can get to your core concerns quickly. Please feel free to site references if you want. However I think a look at www.codeproject.com is good for both of us this week.</p>
<p>Good luck on the current degree efforts (looked over your bio).</p>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I will open a short section in the VI disscussion on the article NOT being another shallow regurgitation of VI.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The stratified approach, style, etc is secondary to the code and phenomena of VI. I want to come to a concensus on the code phenonmena and article thesis. If we can agree on the current intro (language independent phenonmena of VI) all the other stuff will fall into place.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I really hate wading through so much junk on the internet and I am hoping that WikiPedia can prove to be the single world best resource for major programming concepts.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Again, I'm very focused on the code, the core VI phenonmena. This includes coexistance with other key phenomena to separate the keyword/phenomena issue (which is a learning curve level with college summer hires).</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I have the same concern on citations. We need to agree on the intent and thesis (code phenomena Vs. keyword) and then we can do a keyword/phenomena listing prior to citations search and alternatives to phrasing.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Also I want to keep the article as minimal overall but especially minimal at the top end with drill down links at the bottom end.</dd>

<p>By adding a spot of "natural" surfactant to "natural solvents" you can dissolve just about anything. The trick here is that the use of the word natural is slightly missleading.

<li><b>Comment</b> Hi Ben, thank you for posting a comment on the subject. Did you try searching for (IIM) or (IIM USA) in google, MSN and Yahoo? their website come in the first or second page. There are several institutes with the same name in other countries. The iim.org is in Hong Kong. However iim-edu.org is the only one in USA and the name is a registered trademark. Also if you conduct a search about EUMEDIS you can find how notable is this organization and validated their claim to international network. It seems to me you are working in good faith rather than being an extreme deletionist. If the solution is editing the article and adding more references, I kindly ask you to help me with this article.

<p>Hmm. Just noted your comment on the cyanoacrylate page, when in the bottle the adhesive exists only as the monomer form, it couldn't be sticky even if it wanted to. Once exposed to air there should be sufficient water (even surface wetting should suffice) to initiate the chain polymerisation, the rest is just sticky.<a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreatMizuti_d63b.html" title="User:GreatMizuti">GreatMizuti</a> 12:56, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Right, but does it bond to a surface by chemical bonding or just by wetting the surface and then hardening, forming only a mechanical bond. That is, if I had an atomically-smooth metal crystal surface, could I superglue to it or would the glue fall off? <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenFrantzDale_c7e5.html" title="User:BenFrantzDale">—Ben FrantzDale</a> 13:23, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Urm, it's pretty much completely unlikely that you'd have a surface that was perfectly smooth. I think there are some STM images around there that show that even surfaces that are created by boiling metals onto a receptor are fairly imperfect. As to your question, unless the surface has been coated by something that has something the monomer can join to, no, there's no covalent bond to the surface.<a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreatMizuti_d63b.html" title="User:GreatMizuti">GreatMizuti</a> 08:41, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have reverted your edit to <a href="../../../n/o/r/Normal_matrix.html" title="Normal matrix">normal matrix</a>. Please do not change it back. It is a convention in mathematical writing to use "if" and <b>not</b> "if and only if" in definitions. If you would like a style reference, a popular one is Nick Higham's "Handbook of Writing for the Mathematical Sciences." On page 20 of the second edition it says:</p>
<dl>
<dd>By convention, <i>if</i> means <i>if and only if</i> in definitions, so do not write "The graph <i>G</i> is connected if and only if there is a path from every node in <i>G</i> to every other node in <i>G</i>." Write "The graph <i>G</i> is connected if there is a path from every node in <i>G</i> to every other node in <i>G</i>" (and note that this definition can be rewritten to omit the symbol <i>G</i>).</dd>

<p>Regarding your concern about symmetric versus normal matrices:</p>
<p>To be clear, let's distinguish between the complex spectral theorem and the real spectral theorem. The complex spectral theorem says that a complex-valued matrix has an orthonormal basis of eigenvectors if and only if it is normal. On the other hand, the real spectral theorem says that a real-valued matrix has an orthonormal basis of eigenvectors if and only if it is symmetric. Certainly it's true that one can consider a real matrix as a complex matrix (as the real numbers are a subset of the complex numbers). This is no contradiction since a symmetric matrix is certainly normal. However, a normal matrix is not necessarily symmetric. A normal matrix with real entries, then, need not have an orthonormal basis of eigenvectors.</p>
<p>The reason the distinction is important is since if we are referring to symmetric matrices, it is assumed that the entries are real. Otherwise, it doesn't really make sense to speak of symmetric. The analogue in the complex case is called a hermitian matrix, but a hermitian matrix is equal to its conjugate transpose, not its transpose.</p>
<p>I hope that's helpful. I may take another look at the article and try to clear up wherever I can that we need to be looking at real entries. <a href="../../../v/e/c/User%7EVectorPosse_35ae.html" title="User:VectorPosse">VectorPosse</a> 04:38, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>to see that you pulled the Angel of Grief EP cover from the article. The picture of the monument in Rome is mine and i am charging all over the place trying to research more about this work and the effect that it had on subsequent cemetery works [or were some similar ones earlier?] but felt that the ccover that you'd posted was a good thing in the article. I've posted a lot of my old EP covers various places - - <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manfred_Mann_517f.html" title="Manfred Mann">Manfred Mann</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Hollies_a38f.html" title="The Hollies">the Hollies</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Shadows_969f.html" title="The Shadows">the Shadows</a> and more - - and was disapointed that this one is gone.

<dd>I'll put it back up. My sense is that the fair use under which cover art is used here means they should be used primarily to illustrate the album. When it was the only illustration of the <a href="../../../a/n/g/Angel_of_Grief_1e17.html" title="Angel of Grief">Angel of Grief</a>, it seemed a bit inappropriate. Now that there's a real picture of it, those album covers actually illustrate the album covers, which is interesting. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenFrantzDale_c7e5.html" title="User:BenFrantzDale">—Ben FrantzDale</a> 15:17, 21 September 2006 (UTC)

<p>For Ben, from Ben I have watched the changes that you made to the external links listings for "Blinds". There were 4 listings there: Yourblinds.com, therighttrackinc.com, bestbambooblinds.com, blindsfactorydirect.com, and a german language site. Clearly the German language site does not belong and is spam, the bestbamboo site is a page of ads from a parked site, the righttrack site is a promotional site for their business, yourblinds contains definitions, and blindsfactorydirect links to a range of articles related to the topic. I think that there is spam on this document, but it is not in yourblinds or blindsfactorydirect. I have family in the Blinds business, which is why I have the expertise on this topic. Your thoughts?</p>

<p>Hi Ben. Thanks for all your work.

<dd>Jitse, I appreciate the criticism. Those were on the very-short side. In my experience, tiny articles like that can grow or can wind up redirecting somewhere appropriate. I don't know too much about these topics so I don't have much to add to them right now. I was reading documentation that mentioned these terms and since Wikipedia couldn't explain them to me, I figured I'd add them as sub-stubs. I generally add more than a sentence, though.

WikiProject Metal music is important in expanding encyclopedic coverage of the metal. It brings attention to the lesser-known bands, and significantly improves the quality of the famous ones. Five Featured articles and two formers is proof of that.<br />
This is the stuff I wish to achieve with the somewhat recently resurrected <b><a href="../../../r/o/c/WP%7EROCK_79c1.html" title="WP:ROCK">WikiProject Rock music</a></b>. I hope to also attract attention to <a href="../../../r/o/c/Rock_music.html" title="Rock music">rock music</a> articles of all sorts, and hopefully change some to GA or FA status. I invite you to come join us, and embrace the links between metal and rock music in general.<br />
<i><b>Rock on.</b></i><br />

<p><b>Described</b> -- <i>to tell or depict in written or spoken words; give an account of: He described the accident very carefully</i>.<br />
<b>Reported</b> -- <i>To make or present an often official, formal, or regular account of</i>.<br />
<b><a href="../../../w/i/k/Wiki.html" title="Wiki">wiki</a></b> is <i><a href="../../../d/i/c/Dichotomous.html" title="Dichotomous">dichotomous</a></i>: it is either wiki or it is not wiki -- there is no base. you might consider citing something that is wiki-based.<br />
Usage of <i>self-described</i>and <i>wiki-based</i> in the instant article is, at a minimum, less correct.<br />
Commas deleted are used to distinguish the only self-reported term used in the sentence, <i>self-reported conservative</i>.<br />
During editing disputes, proper etiquette requires both editors to prepare themselves before undermining an edit by others:</p>
<ol>
<li>become technically familiar with article's content, including context, discussions, and pertinent external sources</li>
<li>acquire additional editing information about the specific editing conflict</li>
<li>communicate with the other editor</li>
</ol>
<p>when i revert contributions, i notify the editor of the revert and perceived problems. it is my responsibility as a collaborator, and a courtesy they deserve because they could be correct.</p>

<dd>Thanks for the feedback, but I respectfully disagree. Perhaps I should have contacted you directly rather than reverting your change. However, I don't think this disagreement is due to a lack of background in the subject on my part; this is entirely a matter of language.</dd>
<dd>I don't disagree with your definitions of "described" and "reported", but "self-described" and "self-reported" have their own meaning. When I hear "self-reported conservative", I think "Conservapedia reports as 'conservative' when asked on a form". When I hear "self-described conservative" I think "Conservapedia proudly and openly says 'hey, look at me, I'm conservative'" which seems to be the case.</dd>
<dd>I see the desire to set off the adjective that Conservapedia uses to describe itself, but I don't think commas can do what you are asking them to do. Commas can set off parenthetical phrases but in "Conservapedia is a, self reported conservative, wiki online encyclopedia project..." it just doesn't work. Perhaps we should rephrase that sentence entirely.</dd>
<dd>I agree that something is either a wiki or not, but an encyclopedia is not a wiki. The text originally said "wiki online encyclopedia project", which makes no sense. I say it is a "wiki-based encyclopedia project" which is to say it is an encyclopedia project which is based around wiki technology. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenFrantzDale_c7e5.html" title="User:BenFrantzDale">—Ben FrantzDale</a> 02:33, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
