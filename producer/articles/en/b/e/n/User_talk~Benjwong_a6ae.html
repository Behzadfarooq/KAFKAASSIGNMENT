So people helpfully take their time to do just that and *then* we say "Oops... doesn't apply to disambigs".

<p>I just thought I'd mention that the word "animation" is not really the same thing as "animated film" (<a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/animation" class="external text" title="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/animation" rel="nofollow">definition on wiktionary</a>); it refers to the <i>technique</i>, rather than the film itself. It is used to mean "animated film" sometimes, but not all dictionaries list this definition - I think only the American ones do (the Oxford dictionary doesn't, for one). It might be better to use "animated film" instead of "animation" when you're referring the film(s) and not the technique, because this term has wider acceptance among English speakers internationally.</p>
<p>Oh, and thank you very much for your excellent work on Chinese animation. You're doing a great job! <a href="../../../e/s/n/User%7EEsn_d244.html" title="User:Esn">Esn</a> 19:01, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yeah no prob. About the animation thing, if you go by wiktionary it's fairly generic. I have been using the term animation extremely loosely. It technically should be split into films, series, stop-motion, puppets, 3D. Well you get the idea. That are more categories than there are productions. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenjwong_5487.html" title="User:Benjwong">Benjwong</a> 03:46, 4 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>In that case it would be better to just call all of them "Chinese animation" or simply "animation" - it doesn't need to be pluralized - and clarify if they are "films" or "series" if the need arises. For example, "animation continued to be created in the 19xxs, and some well-known films and series were created during this time". I didn't use wiktionary as my only source - as I said, I checked a number of other dictionaries, and only the American ones defined the word "animation" as something which could be pluralized and could also mean "animated films". Webster (American) has that definition; Oxford (British) doesn't.</dd>
<dd>Stop-motion and 3D is animation as well (see the "animation techniques" section at the <a href="../../../a/n/i/Animation.html" title="Animation">animation</a> article. The kind of animation seen in <i><a href="../../../h/a/v/Havoc_in_Heaven_ead8.html" title="Havoc in Heaven">Havoc in Heaven</a></i>, for instance, is called <i>cel animation</i> or <i>traditional animation</i>). Puppets (unless animated with stop-motion techniques) are not considered to be animation.</dd>
<dd>P.S. Please reply on my talk page as well next time (or <i>only</i> on my talk page, whichever you prefer) - that way I get a little orange notice that tells me I got a reply.&#160;:) <a href="../../../e/s/n/User%7EEsn_d244.html" title="User:Esn">Esn</a> 03:41, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>These are not considered animation. CG animation is only used for special effects in both the Pili TV series and the movie. The rest is puppetry. That's like saying that the new Superman movie is animated when it only uses CG animation for special effects and the rest is human actors.</p>
