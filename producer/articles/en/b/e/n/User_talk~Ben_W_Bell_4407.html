<p>Have been checking out the Ballymaguigan page of this site and must say it is very good&#160;! It's a pity you can't get the county's name correct&#160;!! It should be County Derry and as Ballymaguigan is 100% nationalist you should respect the people who live there&#160;!! I have followed the history of this page and see that edits made by user martinglee were changed back by yourself. All the edits which this user did were 100 percent correct&#160;! The housing development is not known as the Island Hill, it is located on the Island Hill, completely different. Martin Lee did not die when he was 19, he died when he was nearly 18 if fact it was 1 week before his 18th birthday. I think if you looked at the user's name martinglee - it would have given you a clue that this user might know a bit more about the Troubles and the Ballymaguigan Martyrs than you do. Oh and finally, there is no such word as thsi, that's why it was changed to 'this'. Don't insult my or martinglee intelligence and put all those edits back&#160;!! <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Uigan Exile (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Uigan_Exile_261c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Uigan Exile">contribs</a>) 07/02/2007.</small></p>

<dd>I have corrected the spelling and the local knowledge edits, but I have not changed the county name. The county is called County Londonderry, and has never been called County Derry, that is simply a local name put upon it by people who do not like the inclusion of the word London in the name of the county. County Londonderry it is and on Wikipedia it is called County Londonderry as that is the only official name that it has. Changing of County Londonderry to County Derry is considered POV pushing and is not accepted on Wikipedia.

<p>Has never been called County Derry???? You must be out of your mind son. The County is still called county Derry by the entire nationalist population of the North as well as virtually the entire population of the south. I think the context of the article should be the basis of which version to use. Article about the north of ireland in general should use Londonderry so as not to offend those who see themselves as british. Similarily, if an article is distictly about a nationalistic subject, place, person etc, it makes sense to use County Derry. When giving place name in irish, theren is no version of Londonderry. Derry is the anglicised version of Doire, whetherit refers to the county or the city. Londonderry has no irish equivalent, Therefore i feel it should be excluded from this page. Nevertheless, I am fully aware that my point of view will be hotly contested, and as a consequence I suggest a compromise for both sides. Both versions should be given, out of respect for both side of the argument, and both groups of people who live in ulster. To simply say Londonderry is the only correct term is pure bigotry, with a side helping of stubborness and ignorance for dessert. Anyway, i have now updated the article to reflect this change. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 155.137.0.9 (<a href="../../../1/5/5/User_talk%7E155.137.0.9.html" title="User talk:155.137.0.9">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_155.137.0.9_7de0.html" title="Special:Contributions/155.137.0.9">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<dd>Okay, it took me a while to figure out what you were talking about. Infuture could you state which article you are discussing especially with such an old edit. I removed the reference as it had nothing to do with the article, it was simply an external link added showing a person making a power loader halloween costume. As such it had no encyclopaedic content whatsoever to add to the article. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBen_W_Bell_a229.html" title="User:Ben W Bell"><font color="blue"><b>Ben W Bell</b></font></a> <strong class="selflink"><i><font color="blue">talk</font></i></strong> 08:10, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I was referring to myself after Arcayne called me a right wing nutjob and a loony, my edits paranoid nonsense. This was because I added a movie review by a Catholic and was told that doing so violated NPOV because he was Catholic. Check the history first and you'll see both the prior provocation and my subsequent attempt to make the peace despite my continuing disagreement over interpretation of NPOV. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_Cooper_70dd.html" title="User:Agent Cooper">Agent Cooper</a> 19:44, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi. Thanks for the reverts and I appreciate the concern. I get this a lot, some people on both sides of the Northern Ireland argument don't appreciate my neutrality in the topic. I get accused of being a Republican stoolpigeon and a Unionist bigot in the same day some times by some people.

<p>Hello, I wonder if you could assist. Before my actions there were two articles about people named Jeff Stewart, one was the American soccer player called simply Jeff Stewart and one about the Scottish actor (in <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Bill_cabc.html" title="The Bill">The Bill</a> called <a href="../../../j/e/f/Jeff_Stewart_%28actor%29_be85.html" title="Jeff Stewart (actor)">Jeff Stewart (actor)</a>.</p>
<p>After suggesting a move and receiving no responses I moved the soccer player to <a href="../../../j/e/f/Jeff_Stewart_%28soccer_player%29_34bb.html" title="Jeff Stewart (soccer player)">Jeff Stewart (soccer player)</a> and made Jeff Stewart simpliciter a disambiguation page. Fine.</p>
<p>However the talk page at the disambiguation page is still the soccer player's (which means that talk page is at 2 places).</p>
<p>Can you</p>
<ol>
<li>delete the disambiguation page's talk page &amp;</li>
<li>tell me how to avoid this happening in the future?</li>
</ol>

<dd>Ah I think I know what happened here. Did you actually MOVE the page using the move function at the top of the page, or just create a new page and copy and paste the items across? If you actually move it it will ask you if you wish to move the talk page as well (or at least it should do) which will allow the history to be transferred with it. Checking it though it appears it has been properly moved. A fix you can do, since there wasn't must discussion on these people, is just to delete everything on the talk page for the disambiguation and explain why in the edit summary. Other than that I'm not sure what else to suggest. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBen_W_Bell_a229.html" title="User:Ben W Bell"><font color="blue"><b>Ben W Bell</b></font></a> <strong class="selflink"><i><font color="blue">talk</font></i></strong> 07:53, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>So you're saying that if I say something and want to take it back, I can't if someone else responds first? It's obvious I wanted to retract an earlier statement - I doubt Hong cares if his comments are removed to.

<dd>Sorry but those comments are a matter of record. I can't stop you removing your comments, but you can't remove someone else's without their permission.

<p>Ben, are you an administrator, because I couldn't see the administrator globe on your user/talk page? Second, this IP was a shared address. Third, if you know how to make bots, could you please weigh into the discussion of having a bot to put the <a href="../../../b/o/t/Wikipedia%7EBot_requests_273d.html#Shared_IP.2FSchool_IP_bot" title="Wikipedia:Bot requests">Shared IP addresses</a> on IP's talk pages. I notice that vandalism is high right around 12-3 p.m. EST. So, if we have a bot tagging all of these IPs as shared, this will lessen collateral damage for users on the network who want to edit Wikipedia. <b><a href="../../../r/e/a/User%7EReal96_8494.html" title="User:Real96"><font color="#6495ED" face="georgia">Real96</font></a></b> 19:40, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>1 - Yes I am an administrator, but no I don't advertise that fact on my User page, I don't see the need to tell people I am one. 2 - Yes it is a shared address, but it has a lot of vandalism, it won't affect people who have accounts though only the anons who are vandalising. 3 - I could weigh in, but I'm one of the people that think that people who seriously want to edit should have accounts, and if they have an account they won't be stopped when an IP gets blocked due to the default being only IPs only on the blocking now (and I see no reason to ever turn that off).

<p>For people born before 1920 in the area that now constitutes Northern Ireland, are you suggesting that they should be categorised as Irish people or what? If so how do we denote their being part of the heritage of Northern Ireland, or their Ulsterness, or whatever you want to call it.

<p><a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBen_W_Bell_a229.html" title="User:Ben W Bell">Ben W Bell</a>, first an d foremost, I apologise for my lack of experience in relation to my edits. Through my inexperience, I appear to have got your back up, on a subject that you obviously view as very important to you, i.e. Londonderry. I see by your web page the you are proud to be Northern Irish, I respect that, that is your point of view, and you are entitled to have it. In any reference that I should use contains the term Londonderry, I will not hesitate to use it. I thought the link for Derry being changed to Londonderry, was very good. But you have changed a reference, i.e. attributed to P.S. O’Hegarty which doses not exist. P.S. O’Hegarty, never referred to “Londonderry.” I know you are not accusing me of being sneaky or disruptive, but through my own admission i.e. lack of experience, I could hardly be accused of using “every editing trick in the book.” I have put together a couple of quotes, in relation to this subject matter. There are a couple of more, though they omit all mention of both Derry and Londonderry, if you would like me to put them forward? Since any edits on this page will revolve around the biography by William Dillon, which is seen by almost every book written on the subject as being the authority on the subject, since it is quoted in almost all, surely the consensus should be to use the term defined. Regardless of the outcome, your “prompting,” has encouraged to produce the best page I possibly can.

<p>Ben, I would appreciate it if you'd discuss your rather contentious editing of the categories of the 'Irish Roads' series of articles and reach some consensus before changing them. Regards (<a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarah777_29d4.html" title="User:Sarah777">Sarah777</a> 20:23, 24 February 2007 (UTC))</p>
<p>Ben, if we are going to straighten this out I suggest every road get cat&gt; Roads in Ireland &gt;Roads in RoI &gt;National Primary Route/secondary/regional; the full categorisation; not just making a political point by focusing on "RoI" only.</p>
<p>Otherwise simply use the third sub-cat, as I have been doing (Primary/Secondary/Regional). I have no intention of doing this myself (too much work) - but if you adhere to this policy of correct cat and sub-cats I will agree to the changes. Except that I am still assuming good faith I would suspect that your focus on getting RoI into every article I have created or edited was related to your insistence on retaining the status quo regarding the misnaming of my country. (<a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarah777_29d4.html" title="User:Sarah777">Sarah777</a> 23:24, 24 February 2007 (UTC))</p>
<p>Ben, I think your pov in the naming matter is on the record (correct me if I'm wrong here). Could you please create a category "secondary roads"; these will be the focus of my work for the next few months? That will allow us implement a rational and acceptable categorisation scheme for 'Irish Roads'. Examination of the roads articles indicates that with the exception of 'primary roads' there was no consistent categorisation over the various articles. While I had not been paying due attention to this issue until recently in most of the pages I created I categorised as 'regional' or 'secondary'; without either 'Roads in Ireland' or 'Roads in RoI'. You have chosen to arbitrarily add 'RoI' to many of these articles, which I removed for the sake of consistency. To further the standardisation process I have alter the categorisation of 'primary roads' to comply with this standard. The remaining work required is as outlined on my <a href="../../../s/a/r/User_talk%7ESarah777_c970.html" title="User talk:Sarah777">talkpage</a>. If you prepared to assist in this project I ask you to adhere to the structure I am establishing. (Perhaps you could reference the 'policy' on the categorisation of Irish Roads that you cite if you have a problem with my solution?). Regards (<a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarah777_29d4.html" title="User:Sarah777">Sarah777</a> 09:23, 25 February 2007 (UTC))</p>
<p>Ben, it would be polite to actually read and take on board the points I have made before merely repeating your request (and ignoring mine). I have provided for a much better, more balanced and more comprehensive solution. As one who has been doing, and intends to continue doing much of the donkey work I find your attempt to exclude my views on how the articles should be categorised is rather high-handed. With respect - (<a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarah777_29d4.html" title="User:Sarah777">Sarah777</a> 20:30, 25 February 2007 (UTC))</p>

<dd>Okay, lets move the Northern Ireland ones up a level then into Roads in Ireland (makes no sense having just NI subcategorised when the RoI ones are a level higher.

<p>Yes Ben, that's fine. Though maybe not necessary to have "Roads in Ireland" confined to the South only. As I have said on the NI talk page I am quitting the naming row for a month. Call it a trial separation. It is way too distracting and with increasing numbers piling into the row I don't want to be fingered as the one who started a civil war here. My point on the 'road' categories was for the full set; see <a href="../../../r/7/5/R752_road.html" title="R752 road">R752 road</a> for example. It has "Roads in Ireland"; "Roads in RoI" and then "Regional road" Likewise you'd have "Roads in Ireland"; "Roads in NI" and "A-roads" (or whatever). Combined with this the "See also" links should include:</p>

<p>This would give a full set of linkages. Some problems - - we need 3 subcategories of 'Roads in RoI' called National Primary, National Secondary and Regional Roads. Two of these exist but the link to the sub-cat 'Regional Road' doesn't seem to work.</p>
<p>- we would (ideally) want a parallel set of NI roads divided into the appropriate classes.</p>
<p>If you can follow what I'm getting at all this is required is for someone to add a lot of links and categories; but this needs to be done anyway to integrate all the various roads articles.</p>
<p>You could add sub-cats of NI or RoI called Motorways and Local Roads (RoI); some editors seem to use those classifications and some don't. What I'm advocating is using the full set of categories (rather than one or two or none according to taste); plus the three standardised links, in the case of RoI roads.</p>
<p>Mind you, this would only be a start; much more standardisation needs to be done and, for example, a separate article on 'National Primary Roads' would make the categorisation much neater.</p>

<p>Ben, You are confusing me. I have just spent (on and off) the past week adding "Roads in Ireland" and "Roads in the RoI" categories to all relevant roads articles because I thought that was what we agreed!! (<a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarah777_29d4.html" title="User:Sarah777">Sarah777</a> 21:47, 9 March 2007 (UTC))</p>
<p>Ben, regarding your reply on <a href="../../../s/a/r/User_talk%7ESarah777_c970.html" title="User talk:Sarah777">User talk:Sarah777</a> - I wasn't the least bit annoyed! Just a tad confused. I am more than happy to go with your view on the lowest sub-category only; it's less cluttered. I just mistakenly thought you wanted ALL of the chain. So now I have some work to undo my previous misunderstanding!</p>
<p>So we agree: looking at my slide above we put in only the LOWEST sub-cat; thus the R113 is categorised a "Category:Regional Road" and the A5 in NI would be "Category:A Roads" (though that system needs to be set up; it is currently categorised as "Category:Roads in Northern Ireland".</p>
<p>Ben - we'll crack this yet! Regards (<a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarah777_29d4.html" title="User:Sarah777">Sarah777</a> 11:16, 10 March 2007 (UTC))</p>
<p>Ben, replying to your latest suggestion; I've been looking around - many articles have several lines of categories - so maybe we should, for clarity, stick with the three cat system (apart from the fact I've inserted it into so many articles and you've put it back in R113).</p>
<p>A wee bit of clutter up on the category line is of little importance. I would prefer this solution to renaming the sub-categories. As they use A-roads in the UK maybe the sub-cats for NI should read "A-roads (NI)"; "B-roads (NI)"; "C-roads (NI)". The terms 'National Primary', 'Secondary' and 'Regional' seem to be unique to Ireland.</p>
<p>That still leaves the the work of setting up a "Roads in Ireland" category page with with the subs listed. Are you busy? :) (<a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarah777_29d4.html" title="User:Sarah777">Sarah777</a> 18:11, 10 March 2007 (UTC))</p>

<p>Can you prevent Astrotrain from ignoring the debate on the <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northern_Ireland_a52b.html" title="Northern Ireland">Northern Ireland</a> talk page, he has been trying to ignore the discussion that is ongoing there and imposing his on POV on this article, he is also following me around the wiki, undoing my edits, I put a warning on his talk prior the my last revert. I would report him for his actions, but I am unsure of the procedure here to do so.--<a href="../../../p/a/d/User%7EPadraig3uk_dbac.html" title="User:Padraig3uk">padraig3uk</a> 12:45, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Astrotrain has been warned the same as you, if he reverts that one more time he'll be temporarily blocked. I'm aware of the debate, and have been only mildly involved in it. I've also noticed the way you are both ending up editing the same articles though haven't looked into it in any detail. Unfortunately we cannot stop users from doing any edits they want, but we can punish afterwards. If you have something specific about his actions that you wish to report feel free to let me know. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBen_W_Bell_a229.html" title="User:Ben W Bell"><font color="blue"><b>Ben W Bell</b></font></a> <strong class="selflink"><i><font color="blue">talk</font></i></strong> 12:47, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>He is constantly undoing any edits I make on articles, such as here <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monument_to_the_Great_Fire_of_London_d999.html" title="Monument to the Great Fire of London">Monument to the Great Fire of London</a> I added the image and he moved it to the gallery, I replace the image with another, he moved that to to the gallery, I restored it and he moves it again. On this aricle <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Fire_of_London_0aa9.html" title="Great Fire of London">Great Fire of London</a> he removed a image I added, replacing it with a much larger one, which I find ironic as one of his reason for for moving my images on the other article as he claimed thery were too big. On the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_British_flags_640a.html" title="List of British flags">List of British flags</a> article he tried to revert my edits, when I warn him on his talk page that I would report him if he didn't stop he left a meesage on <a href="../../../j/o/n/User_talk%7EJonto_20ec.html" title="User talk:Jonto">User talk:Jonto</a> talk page asking him to watch the article, then Jonto started reverting my edits as well, I then had to request that the page be protected to stop them. I could add more but that will give you a ide whats going on. I don't know the correct procedure to report his behaviour.--<a href="../../../p/a/d/User%7EPadraig3uk_dbac.html" title="User:Padraig3uk">padraig3uk</a> 13:14, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks for the revert at <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canterbury.html" title="Canterbury">Canterbury</a> - as someone who has lived in Canterbury, you will be only too aware how ridiculous the idea of there being over 100,000 people in the city is!

<dd>Hi Ben... you asked a question on Mikel-Fikel´s talk page.. Here´s at least part of the answer..from the refs in the article.</dd>
<dd>"..what used to be called the "British Isles," although that is now a politically incorrect term." Finnegan, Richard B.; Edward T. McCarron (2000).

<dd>Warning noted. Thanks. I've been on the talk page where my use of refs from books published by Oxford and Cambridge University Presses has resulted in them being characterised as having a "Republican oriented POV". There is serial ref blanking going on.<a href="../../../h/u/g/User%7EHughsheehy_b679.html" title="User:Hughsheehy">Hughsheehy</a> 12:57, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yep. I'm trying to sort it out there. I left a proposal on the talk page for 4 days before including it in the article. Not only did it get reverted but the refs got deleted too. A hunt back through the page history showed that the same person had deleted refs before. I'm not saying that this is "simple" vandalism either. If anything it's more like "sneaky vandalism", but that's not for me to decide. <a href="../../../h/u/g/User%7EHughsheehy_b679.html" title="User:Hughsheehy">Hughsheehy</a> 13:04, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There is nothing sneaky about it. I'm disputing your right to claim that there's a majority opinion behind the disputed term "British Isles". There is no such majority but you have multiply tried to insert text into the lead that "sneakily" to use your term does imply there is such a majority. The references you use are essentially irrelevant since they either represent, as I have openly stated, Republican opinion, or else simply mention that there is such a dispute. You have totally rejected rational argument in favour of accusations against me, yet in fact I have been editing on behalf of majority opinion on the talk page, which you only choose to go to when your serial edits to the lead are challenged. Your opinion that this is all my misbehaviour is frankly tripe. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkThomas_730d.html" title="User:MarkThomas">MarkThomas</a> 13:37, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Ben, could you count my reverts again please. I'm either going blind or I only see two actual "reverts". I changed the page, which was then reverted, but unless I'm counting wrong I only see two reverts as such done by me. Not saying I'm going to do one more, but wanting to make sure I'm counting properly. <a href="../../../h/u/g/User%7EHughsheehy_b679.html" title="User:Hughsheehy">Hughsheehy</a> 13:43, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I am not trying to break either the letter or the spirit.

<p>The Irish goverment say were not appart of the British Isles.When the French government said it he was quickly corrected by Bertie Ahern,Our Taoiseach that we are not apart of them.It is a Geological mistake,If it were refered to the Anglo-Celtic Isles then that would be k,But saying that calling u apart of the British Isles is the same as calling it like Scandinavia is totally incorrect.The term British Isles means that we are all British when we are not.Mikel-Fikel 82 (<a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikel-Fikel_82_b04d.html" title="User talk:Mikel-Fikel 82">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mikel-Fikel_82_5dc9.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mikel-Fikel 82">contribs</a>) 15:59, 28 March 2007 (UTC).</p>

<p>How come you removed the introduction of foreign prints of the novel? Isn't there an interest in knowing where and when a book has been printed? The article contains a list of reprint dates, why are those more interesting? --194.22.4.101 11:45, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
