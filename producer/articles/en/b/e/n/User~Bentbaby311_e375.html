<p><b>Manuel B. Gonnet</b> takes its name from Manuel Benito Gonnet, who was the prime minister of Public Works of the province (after the federalization of the city of <a href="../../../b/u/e/Buenos_Aires_8e35.html" title="Buenos Aires">Buenos Aires</a>) and outstanding provincial legislating.</p>
<p>On July 13, 1882 the provincial government began the construction of new branches of the railroad that communicated to the new provincial capital with the West Railroad and the South Railroad. The La Plata line- Empalme Pereyra (soon Villa Elisa) was inaugurated the first of January of 1889.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/8/8/1889.html" title="1889">1889</a>, soon to be inaugurated the railway stations <a href="../../../a/d/o/Adolfo_Alsina_17c4.html" title="Adolfo Alsina">Adolfo Alsina</a> in that layout, the proprietors of the small farms of the zone decided to conform a society, to divide the lots and to create a town. The station is released on February 15th and 24th of that month the inauguration of Villa announces Maximum Peace, names of the then governor.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the undertaking was not awaited and many years were required to obtain a stable population nucleus. Initially, the constructions were in their majority aim houses week of inhabitants of the near city of <a href="../../../l/a/_/La_Plata_2dab.html" title="La Plata">La Plata</a>.</p>
<p>When the population began to settle down, in <a href="../../../1/9/0/1909.html" title="1909">1909</a>, Luis Castells, proprietor of the earth that were “across of the routes” (to the north of the station), decide to divide his property and to create a new nucleus, denominated at the present time Villa Castells.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/3/1931.html" title="1931">1931</a> the name change of the station by Manuel B.

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBentbaby311_e375.html" title="Edit section: The Children’s Republic">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Children’s Republic</span></h2>
<p>The magician and charmer the Children’s Republic rose half a century ago in an estate of 53 hectares located in Manuel B. Gonnet, on the dirt road Belgrano, party of <a href="../../../l/a/_/La_Plata_2dab.html" title="La Plata">La Plata</a>, in earth that belonged to the old golf course of the “Swift Golf Club” destined to the seated English refrigerators in the region.</p>
<p>The construction, that began in 1949 during the government of the Cnel. Merchant Domingo, was made by financed company CAPRESA and with provincial resources through the Investing Institute of the Province of Buenos Aires with the intention of being able to construct to the complex in a time record. In the construction 1600 workers worked and lodged in the cabins within the same estate. After two years of continuous work, finally it was inaugurated on November 26, 1951 by the then president of the Nation Tte. Gral. Juan Domingo Perón. To start off that moment, numerous contingents of students of the city, with participation of schools of Buenos Aires province, choose the authorities of the Infantile Government and debate in the enclosures different interest subjects from an infantile approach.</p>
<p>Considered the greater undertaking infantile of Latin America and first thematic park of America, the Children’s Republic was founded with a double intention: the one of creative relaxation in a world of dreams and stories related to the childhood and the one to learn to exert the rights and obligations that in all democratic country have the citizens. By those years, <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walt_Disney_627d.html" title="Walt Disney">Walt Disney</a> visited the place and surprised by as much beauty he was inspired to construct the <a href="../../../d/i/s/Disneyland.html" title="Disneyland">Disneyland</a> later.</p>
<p>The landscape of the Children’s Republic presents/displays waved zones, green spaces, aged woods with variety of species and a central depression that by natural drainage of waters conforms a lake to islands.</p>
<p>The estate is sectored in three areas: urban, rural and sport. The urban area has footpaths, streets and singulars buildings that constitute a central axis denominated Civic Center where the constructions are concentrated that lodge the institutions of the Government of the Republic. Being the children the addressees of this wonderful undertaking, the original objective went to construct the buildings to its scale so that they can experience the operation of the republican institutions, forming in the democratic principles.</p>
<p>Eastern castles, palaces, restaurants, public buildings and a Chapel in where usually it celebrates mass, respect that law just like their furniture. The agreed reduction to children of 10 years has not cleared enchantment or the possibility of enjoyment of the stroll on the part of the adults but that, on the contrary, force them to antedate itself to its childhood.</p>
<p>The equipment designer and executor of works was headed by the architects Lima, River basin and Rooster that took like source from inspiration stories from Andersen, the Grimm brothers and the legend narrated by Tennyson and Mallory to plan and to direct their construction with influences of medieval styles, European and Islamic.</p>
<p>The building of the Infantile Municipal Bank located in front of the main seat, Seat San Martín, is an retort of the Ducal Palace of Venice; near another construction, the Palace of Culture rises there, inspired by the Taj Mahal de Agra, of India, in where the Museum has its seat the International of the Doll.</p>
<p>In the Chapel, under the invocation of the Virgin of Lourdes, with great plans of lateral galleries and towers with bell towers; the House of Government with windows of gothic style crowned by a ceiling of imaginative forms elevated to way of towers and viewpoints, close the Seat San Martín. Around the seat of Americas, located in the end opposite and communicated by a pedestrian street, flanked by commerce, is the Legislature inspired by the English Parliament, that lodges the enclosures of the Houses of Representatives and Senators of the Infantile Government of the Republic, conformed by students of the local schools.</p>
<p>A great space of games faces the building of the Palace of Justice its room of hearing, offices and in the subsoil a small jail. In addition it counts on a wireless study "Radius Republic", the first infantile radio of the country, with exit to the gallery that separates the seat with the surrounding space.</p>
<p>Outside this sector constructions like the Stage are located, the House of the Boy, the buildings of Navy, Army and Aeronautics.</p>
<p>The Children’s Republic, that as of 1979 happens of the provincial scope to the policeman, is unique in the world constituting an infantile place where the citizen formation, recreational, educative, cultural, social, scientific and sport the activities coexists.</p>
