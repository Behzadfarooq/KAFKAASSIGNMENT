<p>Hey there Beneaththelandslide! Thanks for your support of the "Happy easter" message on the portal page. Still, its removal doesn't really matter that much, and I guess that cyberjunkie meant well - he started the featured portal process so maybe he thinks the message lessens the professionalism of the portal or something. Anyway, have a blessed, safe and relaxing Easter, and I hope to see you round!

<p>Hey people! New to wikipedia, got a message to leave a note on here so i'm hoping i'm doing it the right way&#160;:P In regards to the work on the politics articles, i'm not sure if you're being sarcastic! I know i'd be, they were by no means wikified and were only small contributions. I have made contributions (re: politics) to the 2006 election page, the legislative council page (to include info on the 2010 referrendum to abolish the legislative council (upper house)), lindsay simmons, and anne bressington's page. I have an interest in politics and tend to sway more to the left. In state politics, although whilst I do feel Rann is a populist leader who hasn't really done all that much, he's still the better choice for this election. The state liberals are a joke. It's a pity that family first holds two legislative council positions, although Nick Xenophon may help somewhat - but Bressington's views aren't known too well so that's another factor all together. I feel sorry for the Democrats and all the infighting that occured after Meg Lees agreed to the GST which has lead to their demise. The Greens are picking up their vote, let's see if they can do something more than blow hot air. In regards to federal politics, whilst I still vote Labor (because theres simply no way I can vote for a government who gets involved in such activities as Iraq, IR, VSU, etc) I think that Beazley is a weak man and needs to go for the sake of his party and the 07/08 election. A strong leader would have labor in front by a mile after the IR reforms - but no, we have baby beazley. Rudd is too uptight, and I don't think Australians would be ready for a woman PM like Gillard. I'm sure as time goes on I will contribute more to wiki politics on both tiers of Australian government. My 2c&#160;:) <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimeshift9_7a50.html" title="User:Timeshift9">Timeshift</a> 05:28, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>May I have some help? I am considering starting a page on the Westfield Marion shopping centre. What do I do? Mention it in the Adelaide project's discussion page? Just go ahead and write it? Or should I wait unitl I'm a bit more experienced before I make a page? Am I right in saying that only administrators can make new pages?

<p>What about places such as Elizabeth in your home city? That's a city in its own right but also a suburb of Adelaide. <a href="../../../p/n/a/User%7EPnatt_7e2f.html" title="User:Pnatt">Pnatt</a> 15:09, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yeah I'm happy to talk about. I think that Cranbourne should be considered a city in it's own right. I realized that there's really no such thing as a 'city suburb'. Although Cranbourne is in the Metropolitan Area of Melbourne, it's often referred to as a city. I was thinking of putting "Cranbourne is a city in the Melbourne Metropolitan area, etc, etc. <a href="../../../p/n/a/User%7EPnatt_7e2f.html" title="User:Pnatt">Pnatt</a> 15:28, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>There's no city called "Casey" that's just the name of the council. Cranbourne is a city, end of story. <a href="../../../p/n/a/User%7EPnatt_7e2f.html" title="User:Pnatt">Pnatt</a> 15:36, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yes, but "City of Casey" refers to the municipality. City used in municipality names doesn't reflect that suburbs within the municipality are part of the city just because of the fancy name of the municipality. <a href="../../../p/n/a/User%7EPnatt_7e2f.html" title="User:Pnatt">Pnatt</a> 15:51, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Do you have proof? <a href="../../../p/n/a/User%7EPnatt_7e2f.html" title="User:Pnatt">Pnatt</a> 15:57, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Well, Cranbourne is a city and I'm not baseing that on the former "Shire of Cranbourne" <a href="../../../p/n/a/User%7EPnatt_7e2f.html" title="User:Pnatt">Pnatt</a> 16:06, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I know that Cranbourne is a city <a href="../../../p/n/a/User%7EPnatt_7e2f.html" title="User:Pnatt">Pnatt</a> 16:10, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>If you read the Cranbourne article you'll notice that it mentions it is a city. And that wasn't written by me. <a href="../../../p/n/a/User%7EPnatt_7e2f.html" title="User:Pnatt">Pnatt</a> 16:12, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Schools in Cranbourne include St Peters College, St Agatha's Catholic School, Cranbourne Secondary College, Cranbourne Christian Community College, Cranbourne Primary School, Cranbourne West Primary School, Rangebank Primary School and Cranbourne Specialist School. Chisholm TAFE also has a campus in Cranbourne, to the city's east. <a href="../../../p/n/a/User%7EPnatt_7e2f.html" title="User:Pnatt">Pnatt</a> 16:32, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I never said that I think Cranbourne is a city in the form of a local government area. I know that it's in the City of Casey which is a municipality, NOT a city. Cranbourne is a suburb of Melbourne however it's ALSO a city in its own right. <a href="../../../p/n/a/User%7EPnatt_7e2f.html" title="User:Pnatt">Pnatt</a> 16:37, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Michael I was reading your featured article nomination on the history of Burnside, If I read between the lines and some of the articles linked within the article is TB Penfold the person who founded Penfolds Winery (arguably Australias Best) definately it best known, which was first situated in Wattle Park, dont you think this is worthy of a mention.. <a href="../../../g/n/a/User%7EGnangarra_faa9.html" title="User:Gnangarra">Gnangarra</a> 16:26, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Mi Michael, I'm a Mt Osmond resident, and I tripped over the Mt Osmond page that looks like it's mostly your (very well done) work. It's good to see such a comprehensive effort for such a small place as this, thanks.</p>
<p>I did find something that grated though, and it was in the "Aboriginal Culture" section. "The Kaurna people were Stone-Age hunter gatherers..." This is a sentiment shared by western culture upon first encountering Australian Aboriginals, but it has been roundly dis-proven, and is an un-necesary comment in an otherwise useful topic. I took it out, hope you don't mind. Did you lift that description from anywhere? What is the history of that section, I couldn't find anything apart from it's appearance in January..</p>
<p>Anyway, thanks for a top effort.</p>
<p>ps. Have you walked overland between Mt Osmond and Waterfall Gully? I'm interested to do so, but I'm having trouble finding information on tracks to take. Any idea? Regards, Michael</p>
<p>pps. I notice the stone-age reference is on Hazelwood Park as well. I can fix it, but I'd rather hear from you first...</p>
<p>Mi Michael, I eventually found your response on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:202.6.138.34#Stone_Age" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:202.6.138.34#Stone_Age" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:202.6.138.34#Stone_Age</a></p>
<p>Seems strange that you did not answer here, it makes the converstation somewhat disjointed, but never mind.</p>
<p>My understanding of Stone Age is different to yours, and I think if any people of Aboriginal descent read your description of the Kaurna people as 'Stone Age' they would be roundly insulted. Stone Age refers to pre-historic man, and ignores other development that might have taken place in a society beyond that which might have occurred to our ancestors while they were living in caves. In fact, a simple search on wikipedia would suggest that it has fallen out of favor because it is a term used to discuss a period that occurred before the bronze age in Europe, and may not be appropriate to be used on other cultures: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone_age#Modern_use_of_the_term" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone_age#Modern_use_of_the_term" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone_age#Modern_use_of_the_term</a></p>
<p>I'm definitely not going to get into an edit fight about it, but I respectfully suggest that to use the term on these pages is really an editorial comment now contained within wikipedia that is inappropriate and should be removed. It suggests a disregard of Aboriginal culture. You're not alone, but I think you are mistaken&#160;:)</p>
<p>Moving along, I walked Waterfall gully to Mt Lofty today via Cleland, and picked up a trail map from the Gully Cafe. I think it will help with basic navigation between Mt Osmond and Waterfall gully. I've posted some photos of my trips to the gully in my photo blog at www.bellavist.com</p>
<p>I'll think about the account thing, thanks for suggesting it. And please do not take this critisism of stone age as general. I respect your work and effort.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Michael</p>

<dd>Also not interested in arguing about it, but happy to discuss. The point is that upon first inspection, western people could see no difference between what they thought of as Stone Age people and the Australian Aborigines. As you point out, this was reported in 19th century History books, but it has since changed, and not because of a wish to 'sugar coat' the activities of the Aboriginal Population. It has changed because we understand a whole lot more about them since then, and we have learned about their culture, and we have learned to treat them with respect and afford them dignity as fellow humans on this planet.</dd>

<dd>If your reference to the Stone Age was qualified as the first impression of visitors several hundred years ago, then it may be acceptable, but the wikipedia is about what we know now. It is incorrect both factually and culturally to describe the Kaurna people as 'Stone Age' as well as insensitive to their race. As already pointed out, the Wikipedia itself supports my position, as would many scholars of Australian History and Aboriginal Culture.</dd>

Should you feel that I am a lone voice offering an incorrect viewpoint, I can bring people into the discussion who could be considered authorities on the subject of Aboriginal Culture. My own exposure has been sufficient to know that a label of 'Stone Age' is unjustified. regards, Michael</dd>

<p>You've done an incredibly detailed article there. I'll see what I can do. As usual, I can't do it straight away though. I might just start from scratch from Google earth, but your idea of tipping the map 45 degrees to the northwest is a good idea. I think we can mark the route, the stations and interchanges and then the remaining route into the CBD with dotted lines with a shape to show the CBD itself.

<p>I would be interested to know why you removed it. Is there a specific reason? I certainly don't consider the section irrelevant, and how on earth is it innapropriate?!?! It has just as much relevance and appropriateness as having the number of people who are living there. <a href="../../../e/n/i/User%7EEnigmatical_a9c5.html" title="User:Enigmatical">Enigmatical</a> 04:31, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Michael, I believe that Cyberjunkie will be along shortly on your talk page to quote to you about your error in telling me about a change you made to the template. "Apparently" its against the rules, and as he is very fond of quoting rules to people, "good faith" would suggest that he informs you of this as well. <a href="../../../e/n/i/User%7EEnigmatical_a9c5.html" title="User:Enigmatical">Enigmatical</a> 23:02, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Perhaps I need to explain this further. I used your Waterfall Gully article as the basis for creating the template in the first place, then added what I personally considered to be useful information. I call it useful because it has been my experience when people look for suburbs to live in, one of the key features is "how quickly can I get to town?". This is because a large percentage of people actually work within the main CBD. Thus it seems monumentally important to have this figure which gives people an indication of exactly how long their morning commute is. Now you have called this irrelevant, redundant, and now that it means absolutely nothing. What I find incredibly hypocritical however is that you tell me I should <b>argue</b> the point for having it included, so why shouldn't you argue the point for having it removed? It seems to me that it does actually make sense, and if you think it doesn't then <b>argue the point</b> instead of just removing it.</p>
<p>Just to provide additional supporting information (because both yourself and CJ seem to be very sparce in any reasoning given other than just throwing adjectives at it), explain to me how the population from <b>5 years ago</b> is actually more relevant than the time it takes to get to the major city? What is worse is that the information is not even for Waterfall Gully.. but instead is for the entire POST CODE (if I am reading the census data correctly)... as well as the Median property value. This means that both figures are grossly innacurate, both in the fact they fail to tell a person how many people are there now (people could have moved out and the entire suburb could be empty in 5 years), or it could have boomed. Likewise, the median property value could be incredibly skewed due to the other suburbs within the same post code... and in this case I believe Burnside is one of them. So is $510,000 a median value for Waterfall Gully? I think not...</p>
<p>So I hope you can understand my shock and possible displeasure at being told my addition means absolutely nothing, having it removed wholesale only to see even <b>worse</b> information listed and now I am told I have to argue to get it put back in!!!!</p>
<p>So where is this "good faith" from your behalf? Why not take it on good faith that there may be some benefit in the information being provided and see how you can <b>add</b> to it rather than arbitrarily remove it with an excuse of "irrelevant and inappropriate"???? I have no problem with people mercilessly editing an article, you will notice I have several articles which have been modified... I just take exception to people who do so with immediately inflamable comments, then throw rules in my face only to break them constnatly in the process... smacks incredibly of <a href="../../../h/y/p/Hypocricy.html" title="Hypocricy">hypocricy</a> to me and certainly isn't what I would call polite or beneficial to wikipedia. Now if you dispute the validity of this piece of information, why not raise it for discussion instead of taking it out? It seems only fair considering you are doing the exact same thing to me? <a href="../../../e/n/i/User%7EEnigmatical_a9c5.html" title="User:Enigmatical">Enigmatical</a> 05:04, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Conservatism, as the article reflects, means different things to different people. One strong strain of conservatism is the preservation of a state religion, a landed upper class, and a hereditary aristocracy. You object that one of my quotes isn't even "modern". But the article is not about "modern conservatism" but about conservatism throughout history. Instead of just rejecting the "criticisms of conservatism" section out of hand, let's discuss it in the appropriate talk page. Meanwhile, I'll continue to add the references you requested. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERick_Norwood_6566.html" title="User:Rick Norwood">Rick Norwood</a> 14:15, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>You have done a lot of good work in Wikipedia on Australian articles, but I think your assertions that my contributions to Conservatism are POV are unfounded. In any case, I am working with others to eliminate POV from the section in question, and to carefully provide appropriate references for everything. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERick_Norwood_6566.html" title="User:Rick Norwood">Rick Norwood</a> 14:22, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This is from the Heinemann Australian Student Dictionary...</p>
<p>LANGUAGE NOTE: Program or Programme? In recent times the shorter of the two spellings has become dominant and is to be preferred because it reflects a more common form of words in English such as telegram, diagram and anagram. "Program" was considered to be an imported Americanism. The "me" was not attached to this word in English until the 1800s, however, and lingers as an unnecessary embellishment, perhaps reflecting the Greek "programma" meaning "public written notice"), from which the modern word is derived.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../p/n/a/User%7EPnatt_7e2f.html" title="User:Pnatt">Pnatt</a> (<a href="../../../p/n/a/User_talk%7EPnatt_2961.html" title="User talk:Pnatt">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Pnatt_c523.html" title="Special:Contributions/Pnatt">contribs</a>) 23:33, 5 June 2006 (UTC).</small></p>
<dl>
<dd>Program is also used throughout the article and spellings are supposed to be matched in the same article.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../p/n/a/User%7EPnatt_7e2f.html" title="User:Pnatt">Pnatt</a> (<a href="../../../p/n/a/User_talk%7EPnatt_2961.html" title="User talk:Pnatt">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Pnatt_c523.html" title="Special:Contributions/Pnatt">contribs</a>) 23:40, 5 June 2006 (UTC).</small></dd>

<p>But the spelling of words in the article have to match. Both program and programme are used interchangeably in the article. <a href="../../../p/n/a/User%7EPnatt_7e2f.html" title="User:Pnatt">Pnatt</a> 13:20, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
