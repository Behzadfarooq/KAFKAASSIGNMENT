<p>On June 22, 1941 the <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazi_Germany_add9.html" title="Nazi Germany">Germans</a> launched an intense attack against the <a href="../../../s/o/v/Soviet_Union_ad1f.html" title="Soviet Union">Russians</a> over the <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_River_f417.html" title="San River">San River</a>. In short order the Germans conquered all of Eastern <a href="../../../p/o/l/Poland.html" title="Poland">Poland</a> and large swaths of Russian territory. Thousands and thousands of Jews became subject to German authority because of this conquest. They too suffered the decrees and the liquidations; they were also part of the <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazi.html" title="Nazi">Nazi</a> master plan to destroy all the Jews.</p>
<p>The metropolis of <a href="../../../l/e/m/Lemberg.html" title="Lemberg">Lvov</a>, where the Rebbe then lived, also fell under Nazi control in July, 1941. The Rebbe’s residence was in the home of Eliyahu Avigdor Brinner, who was one of his Hasidim. For about a month the Rebbe hid in a room whose door was secretly blocked by a large bookcase. But a friend convinced him to come out of hiding, on the theory that the Germans were harsher to people who were found hiding. The friend also argued that the Germans would honor the Rebbe’s official papers that declared he was a foreign resident. The Rebbe didn’t accept these arguments at first, but ultimately acquiesced. On Friday, July 25, <i><a href="../../../p/a/r/Parsha.html" title="Parsha">Parshas</a> <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matos.html" title="Matos">Matos</a>-<a href="../../../m/a/s/Masei.html" title="Masei">Masei</a></i>, on <i><a href="../../../r/o/s/Rosh_Chodesh_780e.html" title="Rosh Chodesh">Rosh Chodesh</a> <a href="../../../a/v/_/Av_%28month%29.html" title="Av (month)">Av</a></i>, he left his place of hiding and established himself openly in a separate room in the apartment.</p>
<p>As July 25 approached, an unusual bustle was noticed among the <a href="../../../u/k/r/Ukrainians.html" title="Ukrainians">Ukrainian</a> police in the city. Jews tried not to step outside. Early in the morning of July 25, groups of peasants from nearby villages began to flow into Lvov. They assembled on the premises of police stations; set out from there to the streets accompanied by Ukrainian policemen, and assaulted any Jew whom they encountered with clubs, knives and axes. Groups of Jews were taken to the Jewish cemetery and murdered brutally. A roundup of Jews from their homes, coupled with looting, began in the afternoon. The proportion of Jewish intellectuals was high. Ukrainian police circulated in groups of five and consulted prepared lists. The <a href="../../../p/o/g/Pogrom.html" title="Pogrom">pogrom</a> was known as the <i>"Petliura Days"</i> in commemoration of Symon (Semyen) <a href="../../../p/e/t/Petliura.html" title="Petliura">Petliura</a>, the Ukrainian President and military leader, a notorious <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Semite_6134.html" title="Anti-Semite">anti-Semite</a>, who had organized massive pogroms (900 pogroms of which about 40% were perpetrated by the forces led by Petliura) against Jews in 1919 and was killed by a Jewish <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchist.html" title="Anarchist">anarchist</a> (<a href="../../../s/h/o/Sholom_Schwartzbard_ae1f.html" title="Sholom Schwartzbard">Sholom Schwartzbard</a>) in revenge for the murder of fifteen members of his family, on a Street in Paris in 1926, who calmly handed over his weapon to the police, saying "You can arrest me, I've killed a murderer", and was acquitted by a Paris court.</p>

Rabbi Ben Zion of Bobov seated next to his son before WWII</div>

<p>The Germans had authorized the Ukrainians to celebrate this anniversary with a murderous rampage against the Jews. For three days, Ukrainian mobs went on a rampage through the Jewish districts of Lvov. They took groups of Jews to the Jewish cemetery and to Lunecki prison and shot them. The Ukrainian mobs decided that they would concentrate on Jews who were prestigious, wealthy and distinguished. Eliyahu Avigdor’s name was on this list because of his wealth and status.</p>
<p>At about 6 p.m. that very day, while the Rebbe was removing his <a href="../../../r/a/b/Rabbeinu_Tam_0896.html" title="Rabbeinu Tam">Rabbeinu Tam</a>'s <a href="../../../t/e/f/Tefillin.html" title="Tefillin">Tefillin</a>, the door opened suddenly and a Ukrainian youth entered together with the building’s gentile superintendent. The youth carried a red whip with the <a href="../../../i/n/s/Insignia.html" title="Insignia">insignia</a> of the Symon <a href="../../../p/e/t/Petliura.html" title="Petliura">Petliura</a> bands. The two were conducting a search of Mr. Brinner’s house.</p>
<p>The youth took one look at the Rebbe and immediately realized that this was a distinguished personage. He ordered the Rebbe to accompany him. The Rebbe's youngest son, Moshe Aaron, saw his father being led away, and pleaded to come along to help his father. At first the Ukrainian youth objected, but then he acceded and took along Moshe Aaron.</p>
<p>They were joined on the street corner by other distinguished prisoners from other areas in the city. Soldiers stood guard to prevent escape. When the number of captives reached a hundred, the guards arranged them in a row, three abreast, and ordered them to march. The Rebbe was too weak to keep up with the rapid pace and moved to the back. The guards beat him with their <a href="../../../c/l/u/Club_%28weapon%29.html" title="Club (weapon)">batons</a> and demanded that he hurry up. Eliyahu Avigdor held one of his hands and his son Moshe Aaron held the other until they reached <a href="../../../g/e/s/Gestapo.html" title="Gestapo">Gestapo</a> headquarters at Polczinski 4. An eye-witness writes that <i>"he saw from his window how the Rebbe, dressed in his Sabbath clothing was attacked by the soldiers. The cruel Ukrainians beat him on his head with their rifle-butts and his yarmulke fell to the ground. From time to time the Rebbe bent over and stooped to pick it up, and they beat him even more."</i> (<i>Eilah Azkerah</i> by Naftoli Eherenberg, V. 1, ed., page 141)</p>
<p>On <i><a href="../../../s/h/a/Shabbos.html" title="Shabbos">Shabbos</a></i> there was another action. The captives this time included Mr. Itche Leser, who was a Bobover Hasid, and three sons-in-law of the Rebbe who had been hiding in Mr. Leser’s house; they were, Rabbi Yecheskel Halberstam (son of Rabbi Yeshayale Tchechoiver), Rabbi Moshe Stempel and Rabbi Shlome Rubin. All four were brought to the Gestapo building.</p>
<p>The entire household, led by the Rebbe's son Rabbi Shlome, moved heaven and earth to secure the release of the prisoners, and offered huge bribes. But the <i>gezeira</i> (Heavenly decree) had been issued, and all efforts were to no avail.</p>
<p>After three days, on Monday <i><a href="../../../p/a/r/Parsha.html" title="Parsha">Parshas</a> <a href="../../../d/e/v/Devarim.html" title="Devarim">Devarim</a>, <a href="../../../d/a/l/Dalet.html" title="Dalet">Dalet</a> <a href="../../../a/v/_/Av_%28month%29.html" title="Av (month)">Av</a></i> (July 28); four weeks after the Germans entered Lemberg; the Jewish captives were shot in the Yanover forest behind the city. 20,000 Jews were shot that day, the Rebbe, his son and his three sons-in-law included.</p>
