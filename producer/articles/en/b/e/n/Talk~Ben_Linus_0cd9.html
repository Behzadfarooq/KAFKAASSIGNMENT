<p>I think that Ben's first flashback appearence should be <a href="../../../a/_/t/A_Tale_of_Two_Cities_%28Lost%29_6447.html" title="A Tale of Two Cities (Lost)">A Tale of Two Cities (Lost)</a> as the opening scene was about events that happened in the 'present' (in Lost). If the scene had been played in the Pilot, I would agree it was not a flashback, but I think it is one.</p>
<p>I have just recently watched reruns of season 1 and in them I saw Ben as a Janitor in the mental instition. The episode was when Hurley had won the lotto and went back to see Lenard about the cursed numbers. Ben was changing a light globe on a very unstable ladder and Hurley told him to stop and do it someother time.(4/12/2006)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I don't know about A Tale of Two Cities being Ben's first flashback, but Ben was not the janitor in the mental institution. If you have a closer look at hi-def pictures of the scene online, it's clear that it isn't him. Michael Emerson was not involved in Lost until his first episode as Henry Gale, One of Them. -- <a href="../../../f/l/u/User%7EFlummery_9fac.html" title="User:Flummery">Flummery</a> 00:55, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It's my understanding that Emerson (who plays Henry Gale) has been casted as a main character in season 3 per Damon Lindelof.

I find it of interest that, in the pilot/debut of "The Night Stalker" starring Stuart Townsend, victims of the beast attack are HENRY and EMILY GALE! Now, if their little girl's name had been Dorothy... (Yes, I know the originals were aunt and uncle.) I just think it's an oddity that two Henry Gales have shown up relatively recently. Cyn Lankford 7/28/06 I should mention my WOZ Theory: The film is so engrained in our memories that you will hear a reference to the film nearly every day, sometimes several times a day.

<dd>Though I think that in time, the name may switch to "Ben" everywhere, for now, I think we should stick with the rule of "using the name that the individual is most commonly known as", per <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28common_names%29_764d.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (common names)">Wikipedia:Naming conventions (common names)</a>. In other words, even though President Clinton's full name is "William Jefferson Clinton", he's most commonly referred to as "Bill Clinton". We should watch outside sources to see how the character is referred to. If he's being written up in reviews as "Ben", then we should follow that lead. But if most people are still referring to him as "Henry Gale", then it makes sense to continue using the name that most people are familiar with. --<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EElonka_d4b2.html" title="User:Elonka">Elonka</a> 17:38, 12 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>A major part of my criticism is the quotaion marks around his name (<i>Ana Lucia takes a gun to kill "Henry" but cannot bring herself to do it</i> looks terrible, IMHO).

<dd>I disagree with the idea of using the name "Ben", to refer to an incident that occurred when he was going by a different name. For example, it would be very odd to go into Season 2 plot summaries, and change all references to "Henry Gale's" name to Ben. --<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EElonka_d4b2.html" title="User:Elonka">Elonka</a> 22:17, 13 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I agree that he shouldn't be referred to as Ben in episode articles before A Tale of Two Cities or in other character articles before AToTC. But on his own page, where his real name is revealed in the title, it just seems silly to refer to his as "Henry" throughout. Especially with those quote marks which I also think looks terrible. On his own article he should always be called Ben. On every other article it should depend on when it takes place.

<p>In all honesty, most of that stuff should just be removed from the article. It's practically a complete plot synopsis for every scene Michael Emerson's ever been in, which is complete overkill. It's also nothing but spoilers for anyone who isn't current with the series. I think it needs to be pared down to the significant events, probably no more than two paragraphs.

<p>In the first episode of the third season, when the others are seeing what happens to the plane in the air, "Henry Gale"/Ben turns around and says he wants a list within three days. When looking at his eyes when he says this, he appears to have slit shaped pupils. Is it just a reflection of what is in front of him, or is it really his pupils? 217.68.114.116 16:02, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That is his full name, but is it the most commonly used name for the character? Which name is used more on the show?

<p>Should Kate become Katherine, Walt become Walter, Libby become Elizabeth, Batman become Bruce Wayne and Prue Halliwell become Prudence Halliwell?
