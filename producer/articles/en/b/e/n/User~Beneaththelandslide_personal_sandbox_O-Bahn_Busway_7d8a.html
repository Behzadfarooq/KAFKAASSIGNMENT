</div>
<p>The <b>O-Bahn Busway</b> is the world's longest, fastest and most heavily patronised <a href="../../../g/u/i/Guided_bus.html" title="Guided bus">guided busway</a>. The O-Bahn (from <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latin.html" title="Latin">Latin</a> <i>omnibus</i> meaning "for all people" and <a href="../../../g/e/r/German_language.html" title="German language">German</a> <i>bahn</i> meaning "way" or "road") design was originally conceived by <a href="../../../d/a/i/Daimler-Benz_86e1.html" title="Daimler-Benz">Daimler-Benz</a> to make use of former <a href="../../../t/r/a/Tram.html" title="Tram">tram</a> tunnels in the <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germany.html" title="Germany">German</a> city of <a href="../../../e/s/s/Essen.html" title="Essen">Essen</a>. While this plan did not come to fruitition, the system was applied in the <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Australia_b9ad.html" title="South Australia">South Australian</a> capital city of <a href="../../../a/d/e/Adelaide.html" title="Adelaide">Adelaide</a> to deliver services to its rapidly expanding <a href="../../../c/i/t/City_of_Tea_Tree_Gully_a9c4.html" title="City of Tea Tree Gully">north-eastern suburbs</a>, replacing an earlier plan to create a <a href="../../../g/l/e/Glenelg_Tram_743c.html" title="Glenelg Tram">tramline extension</a>.</p>
<p>The design is unique among <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_transport.html" title="Public transport">public transport</a> systems; typical busways make use of dedicated bus lanes or separate carriageways, while the O-Bahn runs on specially built tracks, combining elements of both bus and rail systems. The track is at a length of 12 <a href="../../../k/i/l/Kilometers.html" title="Kilometers">kilometers</a> and contains one station and two interchanges; <a href="../../../k/l/e/Klemzig_Station_5b1d.html" title="Klemzig Station">Klemzig Station</a> in <a href="../../../c/i/t/City_of_Norwood_Payneham_St_Peters_e9be.html" title="City of Norwood Payneham St Peters">Payneham</a>, <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paradise_Interchange_1d99.html" title="Paradise Interchange">Paradise Interchange</a> in <a href="../../../c/i/t/City_of_Campbelltown%2C_South_Australia_3ff6.html" title="City of Campbelltown, South Australia">Campbelltown</a> and <a href="../../../t/e/a/Tea_Tree_Plaza_Interchange_68e2.html" title="Tea Tree Plaza Interchange">Tea Tree Plaza Interchange</a> in <a href="../../../c/i/t/City_of_Tea_Tree_Gully_a9c4.html" title="City of Tea Tree Gully">Tea Tree Gully</a>. Interchanges allow buses to enter or exit the system and continue on with suburban routes, avoiding the need for passengers to change service. Buses travel at a top speed of 100 km/h, and the system is capable of ferrying 18,000 passengers an hour from the <a href="../../../c/i/t/City_of_Adelaide_ff46.html" title="City of Adelaide">Central Business District</a> to Tea Tree Plaza at a travel time of 15 minutes.

<p>The city of <a href="../../../a/d/e/Adelaide.html" title="Adelaide">Adelaide</a> has enjoyed robust population and economic growth since industrialisation following <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a>. Concurrent with this growth, future transport plans, developed with <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">American</a> assistance, were presented in 1968; the <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metropolitan_Adelaide_Transport_Study_5106.html" title="Metropolitan Adelaide Transport Study">Metropolitan Adelaide Transport Study</a> (MATS). The plan envisioned a large network of <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freeway.html" title="Freeway">freeways</a> crossing the city, together with an underground city loop <a href="../../../r/a/i/Railways_in_Adelaide_1475.html" title="Railways in Adelaide">railway</a>. One of the freeways to be constructed was the <i>Modbury Freeway</i>, connecting a city bypass route with the then predominantly barren and undeveloped north-eastern suburbs. The Freeway was to be built in the <a href="../../../t/o/r/Torrens_Linear_Park_865c.html" title="Torrens Linear Park">Linear Park</a> that lay alongside the <a href="../../../r/i/v/River_Torrens_6663.html" title="River Torrens">River Torrens</a>. <sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>The MATS plan was met with huge and unprecendented public opposition, brought about by the size of the project - several suburbs were to completely disappear under <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freeway_interchange.html" title="Freeway interchange">interchanges</a>, Hindmarsh in particular was to be removed to make way for a gigantic multi-entry interchange. Widespread images of <a href="../../../t/r/a/Traffic_congestion.html" title="Traffic congestion">gridlock</a> in similar overseas freeway networks also contributed to the negative public opinion. The plan was soon shelved by successive governments, both <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Labor_Party_d687.html" title="Australian Labor Party">Labor</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberal_Party_of_Australia_e08b.html" title="Liberal Party of Australia">Liberal</a>, and much of the land held by the Highways Department was sold off for housing developments. However, the land for the Modbury Freeway was not sold, and its name changed from "Modbury Freeway Corridor" to "Modbury Transport Corridor". The Modbury Corridor was left to degrade, eventually becoming foul <a href="../../../l/a/n/Landfill.html" title="Landfill">landfill</a>.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>

<p>The population of the <a href="../../../c/i/t/City_of_Tea_Tree_Gully_a9c4.html" title="City of Tea Tree Gully">Tea Tree Gully</a> region had seen exceptional population growth, even without rail infrastructure that was common throughout the Adelaide area. Between 1954 and 2001, a half century, its population had increased from 2,561 to 91,921 through new housing developments. In 1973, knowing that the area was indequately served with regard to transporation, the State Director General of Transportation spoke on using the Modbury Corridor for public transport. His initial suggestion was for a heavy rail line to connect to <a href="../../../r/a/i/Railways_in_Adelaide_1475.html" title="Railways in Adelaide">Adelaide's existing rail system</a>. The Department started research on the corridor the following year with the North East Public Transport Review (NEAPTR). NEAPTR considered heavy rail, light rail, busways and freeways in the four years of its research. When presented in 1978, it had narrowed down to two options: light rail or a busway. The governing Labor Party, under the stead of Premier <a href="../../../d/o/n/Don_Dunstan_1851.html" title="Don Dunstan">Don Dunstan</a>, decided on a <a href="../../../l/i/g/Light_rail.html" title="Light rail">light rail</a> proposal for an extension of the historic <a href="../../../g/l/e/Glenelg_Tram_743c.html" title="Glenelg Tram">Glenelg Tram</a>. The new route was to continue along <a href="../../../k/i/n/King_William_Street%2C_Adelaide_233b.html" title="King William Street, Adelaide">King William Street</a> beyond the present terminus in <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victoria_Square%2C_Adelaide_2a1b.html" title="Victoria Square, Adelaide">Victoria Square</a> and weave through the <a href="../../../a/d/e/Adelaide_Park_Lands_6b3a.html" title="Adelaide Park Lands">Adelaide Park Lands</a> to the Modbury Corridor.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[7]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>New light rail vehicles would have been bought to replace the ageing 1929 H-Class vehicles. The light rail system would connect with feeder buses at stations along the length of the corridor to transfer passengers onto suburban routes. Public opposition was broad to the project; the <a href="../../../c/i/t/City_of_Adelaide_ff46.html" title="City of Adelaide">Adelaide City Council</a> objected to the plan on the basis that it would interfere with the well-designed layout of the CBD. In response, the Government adjusted the plan to construct the line underneath the city, hugely increasing the cost. Local residents in near-city suburbs such as <a href="../../../s/t/_/St_Peters%2C_South_Australia_c449.html" title="St Peters, South Australia">St Peters</a> were concerned about the noise of the light rail vehicles, and objected to the disruption of the Torrens Gorge, which lay in the Modbury Corrdior and was at this point still landfill. The <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberal_Party_of_Australia_e08b.html" title="Liberal Party of Australia">Liberal</a> MP for <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electoral_district_of_Torrens_011d.html" title="Electoral district of Torrens">Torrens</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Wilson_%28Australian_politician%29_b41e.html" title="Michael Wilson (Australian politician)">Michael Wilson</a>, representing the north east inner suburbs, vocally opposed the project on behalf of his constituents.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[9]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p>Drilling commenced with the underground proposal, but the Labor party suffered heavily in 1979 with the resignation of the charismatic Dunstan, widespread bus strikes and community concern with the light rail project. In elections held that year, incumbent Labor Premier <a href="../../../d/e/s/Des_Corcoran_f107.html" title="Des Corcoran">Des Corcoran</a> ran a disasterous campaign and the Liberal Party gained power with a swing of 11%. Interestingly, Wilson, who so opposed the light rail proposal, attained the position of Transport Minister in the new <a href="../../../c/a/b/Cabinet.html" title="Cabinet">cabinet</a>. Light rail construction was immediately halted at the start of his tenure.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>

<p>The new Transport Minister sought to find a replacement for the light tail proposal. At the same time, the <a href="../../../g/o/v/Government_of_Germany_b871.html" title="Government of Germany">Government of Germany</a> was also exploring new public transport options. <a href="../../../d/a/i/Daimler-Benz_86e1.html" title="Daimler-Benz">Daimler-Benz</a> had developed a guided bus system for use in former tram tunnels in <a href="../../../e/s/s/Essen.html" title="Essen">Essen</a>. The South Australian Government, interested in the new idea, sent experts to observe the system and provide information on whether it could be effectively applied in the Modbury Corridor. After extensive consultations with the German authorities, State Transport Department Engineers decided the O-Bahn could be used as a replacement. The system was seen as far superior; it used less land, made less noise, was faster and cost less. In addition, its unique feature of a non-transfer service direct from suburban streets to the CBD made it more attractive. Plans were drawn up for a length of 12 kilometers, 3 of which would be constructed using O-Bahn track, the rest of the route using a conventional busway. The public again made their voices heard in 1981, and because of this, and safety reasons, O-Bahn track was to be in place for the entire length. Construction began in 1983 for the first section to <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paradise_Interchange_1d99.html" title="Paradise Interchange">Paradise Interchange</a>. In 1982 the <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Tonkin_34e9.html" title="David Tonkin">Tonkin</a> Liberal Government that oversaw the O-Bahn's development was removed from office and replaced by the <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Bannon_208f.html" title="John Bannon">Bannon</a> Labor Party. The future of the O-Bahn, which was concieved in political circumstances, was in doubt. The Bannon government, after consultations, continued with Stage One (City to Paradise) and in 1986 the green light was also given for Stage Two (Paradise to Tea Tree Plaza).<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[12]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[13]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>

<p>The cost of the project ended up at <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Dollar_42f0.html" title="Australian Dollar">AU$</a>98m, including the cost of the buses. $6 million was spent alone on landscaping the <a href="../../../r/i/v/River_Torrens_6663.html" title="River Torrens">River Torrens</a>, transforming what was <a href="../../../l/a/n/Landfill.html" title="Landfill">landfill</a> into a spectacular <a href="../../../t/o/r/Torrens_Linear_Park_865c.html" title="Torrens Linear Park">Linear Park</a> that runs the length of the O-Bahn. 150 000 trees and shrubs were grown, creating a lengthy urban <a href="../../../p/a/r/Park.html" title="Park">park</a> wholly different from the barren landfill of before.<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[15]</a></sup></p>
<p>There have been a number of proposals to extend the current O-Bahn track to <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golden_Grove%2C_South_Australia_742a.html" title="Golden Grove, South Australia">Golden Grove</a> or to create newer systems in Adelaide, specifically for the <a href="../../../c/i/t/City_of_Onkaparinga_f179.html" title="City of Onkaparinga">southern suburbs</a>. An extension to Golden Grove would require the purchase of large tracts of property as there is no available transport corridor in the area. Future population increase in the area is neglible, although sprawl does continue for another eight kilometers to the <a href="../../../a/d/e/Adelaide_Hills_650a.html" title="Adelaide Hills">Adelaide Hills</a> from <a href="../../../t/e/a/Tea_Tree_Plaza_Interchange_68e2.html" title="Tea Tree Plaza Interchange">Tea Tree Plaza Interchange</a>.

<p>The proposal for a southern O-Bahn has seen the most attention and has been the subject of various studies and Parliamentary Committees as to its viablity. The rail route through Adelaide's far south is broadly off center and fails to achieve a large catchment area that a more central transport route would attain. An O-Bahn running direct through the region would be able to take advantage of an already large population and the still-continuing growth in the area. The most common route for an O-Bahn construction has been for an alignment adjacent to the <a href="../../../n/o/a/Noarlunga_Centre_railway_line%2C_Adelaide_f843.html" title="Noarlunga Centre railway line, Adelaide">Noarlunga rail line</a> from the city to the <a href="../../../t/o/n/Tonsley_railway_line%2C_Adelaide_233a.html" title="Tonsley railway line, Adelaide">Tonsley branch line</a>, which it was to replace.

Guide-wheel</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>In the case of bus malfunction a specially designed vehicle nicknamed 'Dumbo' is used to tow them off the track. In the early stages of design it was intended for all buses to have a tow ability; this was soundly rejected by the drivers union and 'Dumbo' was purchased. If a bus <a href="../../../t/i/r/Tire.html" title="Tire">tyre</a> blows during a trip the guide-wheel prevents the bus from any erratic movement and a smaller aluminimum inner tyre allows the bus to be driven to the nearest station at a speed of 40 km/h.<sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[22]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[23]</a></sup></p>
<p>The guide-wheel is the most important part of the bus when travelling on the O-Bahn, it protudes from the front sides and aligns with the track. Connected directly to the bus' steering system, it 'steers' the bus while on the track and prevents the other main tyres from rubbing against the sides of the track. Drivers do not need to hold the <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steering_wheel.html" title="Steering wheel">steering wheel</a> when travelling on the O-Bahn because of the guide-wheel, and a <a href="../../../r/u/m/Rumble.html" title="Rumble">rumble</a> strip before stations is a purpose-built reminder that they need to again assume control. The guide-wheel is the most delicate part of the system and is designed to snap off in the case of sharp impact; before the O-Bahn was in place a number of buses were fitted with guide-wheels for their ordinary routes to test their durability. After numerous guide-wheel/curb impacts drivers soon learnt to be much more cautious on their trips.<sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[24]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#_note-24" title="">[25]</a></sup></p>

<p>The establishment of the O-Bahn to replace the previously touted Modbury Freeway was an environmentally conscious decision from the start; making public transport a replacement for car dependancy. Six million dollars of the total cost was used exclusively for the redevelopment of the <a href="../../../r/i/v/River_Torrens_6663.html" title="River Torrens">Torrens Gorge</a> and the <a href="../../../t/o/r/Torrens_Linear_Park_865c.html" title="Torrens Linear Park">Linear Park</a> was created. 150 000 trees, plants and shrubs were grown alongside the track for both aesthetic, environmental and noise-reduction purposes; plantings were only completed in 1997. Because of the environemental considerations, the O-Bahn development is carbon neutral.<sup id="_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#_note-25" title="">[26]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#_note-26" title="">[27]</a></sup></p>

<p>A standard off peak single-trip ticket costs $3.50 and is valid for two hours from validation. In addition, tickets are available as unlimated day-trips and 10-use multitrip. Tickets can be used across all Adelaide Metro services, including <a href="../../../g/l/e/Glenelg_Tram_743c.html" title="Glenelg Tram">trams</a> and <a href="../../../r/a/i/Railways_in_Adelaide_1475.html" title="Railways in Adelaide">railways</a>; they require validation upon entry to a vehicle.

<p>The O-Bahn track is made out of solid <a href="../../../c/o/n/Concrete.html" title="Concrete">concrete</a> and elevated above ground. The elevation is necessary because of the poor quality of soils along the <a href="../../../r/i/v/River_Torrens_6663.html" title="River Torrens">River Torrens</a>, which regularly move due to seismic shifts. Large concrete <a href="../../../p/y/l/Pylon.html" title="Pylon">pylons</a> were drilled into the ground, at a depth of 4 metres, to ensure stability. On top of the pylons are concrete sleepers and above that, the L-shaped track runs. 5,600 pylons are drilled in place at a depth of three metres to support 5,600 sleepers and the 4,200 pre-fabricated track peices. The track peices are applied at constant 12 metre intervals. The width of both track carriageways, sitting on the sleepers, is 6.2 metres.<sup id="_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#_note-34" title="">[35]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="#_note-35" title="">[36]</a></sup></p>
<p>The track at the city end begins at Hackney Road, opposite the <a href="../../../a/d/e/Adelaide_Park_Lands_6b3a.html" title="Adelaide Park Lands">eastern parklands</a>, where it enters a 60 metre tunnel at a speed of 40 km/h due to the large initial corner. The speed is gradually increased to 80 km/h for most of the trip to <a href="../../../k/l/e/Klemzig_Station_5b1d.html" title="Klemzig Station">Klemzig Station</a>. The comparatively low speed at this point is to ensure the back tyres do not 'scrub' against the track. Once en route to <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paradise_Interchange_1d99.html" title="Paradise Interchange">Paradise Interchange</a>, the speed is 100 km/h, with 90 km/h for some tighter corners. The average speed for the twelve kilometers of track to be run, including stops, is about 60 km/h. On some sections 115 km/h has been easily achieved in tests. When entering interchanges, the track ends and the speed is 40 km/h. In the interchange area, the speed limit is 20 km/h.<sup id="_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="#_note-36" title="">[37]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#_note-37" title="">[38]</a></sup></p>
<p>The track is officially considered a South Australian road due to a court ruling in the early years of the system's operation. This ruling also gave the green light for the <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Australia_Police_9704.html" title="South Australia Police">South Australian Police</a> to set up speed cameras on the track and actively fine speeding drivers.<sup id="_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#_note-38" title="">[39]</a></sup></p>
<p>It is possible for cars to enter the track from Hackney Road or any of the interchanges. This is deterred by a large number of signs at entrance points, and finally, a large device that rips out a cars' oil tank if it gets onto the track. The <a href="../../../s/u/m/Sump.html" title="Sump">sump</a> buster, as it is known, ensures that a car is unable to get far on the track. On average, four cars enter the track each year and have to be removed by crane.<sup id="_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#_note-39" title="">[40]</a></sup></p>
