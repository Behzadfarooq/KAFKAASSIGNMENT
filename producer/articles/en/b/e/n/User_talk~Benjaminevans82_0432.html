<p>Thanks for uploading <b>Image:Polzeath.jpg</b>. I notice the image page currently doesn't specify who created the image, so the <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copyright.html" title="Copyright">copyright</a> status is therefore unclear. If you have not created the image yourself then you need to argue that we have the right to use the image on Wikipedia (see copyright tagging below). If you have not created the image yourself then you should also specify where you found it, i.e., in most cases link to the website where you got it, and the terms of use for content from that page.</p>
<p>If the image also doesn't have a copyright tag then you must also add one. If you created/took the picture then you can use {{<a href="../../../g/f/d/Template%7EGFDL_bb04.html" title="Template:GFDL">GFDL</a>}} to release it under the <a href="../../../g/f/d/GFDL_75b9.html" title="GFDL">GFDL</a>. If you can claim <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_a984.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">fair use</a> use {{<a href="../../../f/a/i/Template%7EFairusein_19b9.html" title="Template:Fairusein">fairusein</a>|article name}} or {{<a href="../../../f/a/i/Template%7EFairuse_cee7.html" title="Template:Fairuse">fairuse</a>}}. See <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_copyright_tags_f6dd.html" title="Wikipedia:Image copyright tags">Wikipedia:Image copyright tags</a> for the full list of copyright tags that you can use.</p>
<p>If you have uploaded other images, please check that you have specified their source and copyright tagged them, too. You can find a list of image pages you have edited by clicking on the "<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Benjaminevans82_namespace%3D6_e063.html" title="Special:Contributions/Benjaminevans82?namespace=6">my contributions</a>" link (it is located at the very top of any Wikipedia page when you are logged in), and then selecting "Image" from the dropdown box. Note that any unsourced and untagged images will be deleted one week after they have been uploaded, as described on <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriteria_for_speedy_deletion_81ee.html#Images.2FMedia" title="Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion">criteria for speedy deletion</a>.

<dd>Thanks. I do think that there's too much of the original left in the page; but equally I've dropped a mail to the owner of the source site asking if she/he minds - I suspect they'll be cool with it, since they borrowed from a number of sources to get their info. And who knows; we might be able to snag some of their images. However we should continue to make it diverge if we can. Oddly, I came across Gurney last night &amp; couldn't find anything on him in wikiepedia, via google; that only 16 hours after you'd started your article. Nice coincidence. (Oh. And there seems to be discrepency between the first two biogs listed in External Link, one of which gives him credit for limelight, the other of which says that he improved/replaced limelight with the bude light. Some more work needed there to clarify. best wishes --<a href="../../../t/a/g/User%7ETagishsimon_49c0.html" title="User:Tagishsimon">Tagishsimon</a> <a href="../../../t/a/g/User_talk%7ETagishsimon_9445.html" title="User talk:Tagishsimon">(talk)</a></dd>

<dd>Yup, it's a creditable enough article, though I would like to tie down the limelight business &amp; see some more fact checking done.

<p>Hi, I was a bit surprised to see those section headings. They might be a good idea; those lists are getting cluttered. My concern, though, is that there are 366 date pages...and the formatting needs to stay consistent across all of them. There's probably a discussion area somewhere for talking about the overall format and contents of those pages. That would be the place to talk about making structural changes like inserting section headings. (I have my own concerns about those pages, like the flood of stupid non-days added to the holiday sections...it would be nice if we could trim those down a bit.) -- <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJim_Douglas_5faf.html" title="User:Jim Douglas">Jim Douglas</a> 18:16, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, think your FIDO name is incorrect. Not only does it make zero sense, but its not the one seen most often. I suspect the 49 Times Magazine got it wrong, something the media is wont to do. Whereas the people who worked with the system who have given their histories since are more likely to get it right.

<dd>You have raised a interesting point. If you read the the section on fog dispersal on <a href="http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/news/hearallsides/letters/display.var.1121605.0.january_13th_2006.php" class="external text" title="http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/news/hearallsides/letters/display.var.1121605.0.january_13th_2006.php" rel="nofollow">this link</a>, it seems to suggest that the acronym FIDO was referred to as both "Fog Investigation and Dispersal Operation" and "Fog Intensive Dispersal Of". Also I have just noticed that there seems to be a duplicate article on FIDO at <a href="../../../f/i/d/FIDO_%28device%29_89f6.html" title="FIDO (device)">FIDO (device)</a>, we really should combine it with <a href="../../../f/o/g/Fog_Investigation_and_Dispersal_Operation_%28FIDO%29_4805.html" title="Fog Investigation and Dispersal Operation (FIDO)">Fog Investigation and Dispersal Operation (FIDO)</a>. In the <a href="../../../f/i/d/FIDO_%28device%29_89f6.html" title="FIDO (device)">FIDO (device)</a> article it says that FIDO stands for "Fog Intensive Dispersal Operation". It seems as if there is no consensous as to what FIDO really stood for take a look at the bottom two paragraphs of <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,30430-2555814,00.html" class="external text" title="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,30430-2555814,00.html" rel="nofollow">this link</a>. I think we should call the new article "Fog Intensive Dispersal Operation (FIDO)" as this sounds the most accurate. We can combine the two existing articles (putting in redirects) explaining in the opening lines that FIDO has also been referred to as "Fog Investigation and Dispersal Operation" and "Fog Intensive Dispersal Of". This is important as we do not want someone writting another article on FIDO under a different name when it is really the same thing. Let me know what you think--<a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenjaminevans82_7c6f.html" title="User:Benjaminevans82">Benjaminevans82</a> 19:05, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree. I was thinking, also, that its possible the Investigation terminology may actually have been correct when one considers the nature of the project. While the others make sense, perhaps initially the term was used to describe not just the working item, but the project which created it? As a research project, they may well have been "investigating" how to disperse Fog, and when they came up with this concept the project name just moved over to the final product without change. Then as it was used those users just adjusted the name to make a better fit to the product and its use. Speculation either way, so listing both names and noting the conflict is probably the best way to go. Perhaps eventually we can find a source document from the British archives to give us a more definitive answer. Till then, list em all. And definitely redirect and combine.

<p>Okay, that sounds reasonable.

<li>It seems to me that the best bet is #3 (software written for the linux operating system). The problem with #4 is that linux ports of just about anything are exceedingly common these days, and aside from that there is a plethora of emulators that let other-system stuff run under Linux. E.g. I can grab a nintendo emulator and run Super Mario under linux. As you say #1 and #2 have some gray areas, but then most categories tend to get a gray area or two so that may not be as much of a problem. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!"><b><font color="#DD0000">&gt;<font color="#FF6600">R<font color="#FF9900">a<font color="#FFCC00">d<font color="#FFEE00">i</font>a</font>n</font>t</font>&lt;</font></b></a> 10:53, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Hi there - I like the work you've put in to the Uni. of Exeter and related articles, it really needed it. Just one thing, I notice you created an article for XTV. As an old-XTVer myself I think this is great, however it's worth noting that recently pretty much all UK student TV stations articles got deleted (XTV didn't have an article at the time). Only a couple of the bigger stations with good sources on them survived, and the <a href="../../../n/a/s/NaSTA_0ebd.html" title="NaSTA">NaSTA</a> article has been acting as a kind of refuge for information on everyone else</p>
<p>I'm reluctant to add to the article with the threat of deletion hanging over it, and I'm actually undecided wether a real standards-compliant article can be written at all due to shortage of sources. We've got enough independent sources (newspaper articles) to confirm XTV's existence and purpose, but that's about all.</p>
<p>Still, I'm not going to prod it or anything, as I'd like to see articles on UK student TV. But I'm not sure where to go from here - I can't see it lasting too long with the text copied from the NaSTA page.

<dd>Tom. Firstly Thankyou for drawing this to my attention. I did not realise that student television stations had been deleted in the past in favour of a central article at <a href="../../../n/a/s/NaSTA_0ebd.html" title="NaSTA">NaSTA</a>. On wikipedia generally there are people who like to see central articles on a topic i.e <a href="../../../n/a/s/NaSTA_0ebd.html" title="NaSTA">NaSTA</a> then there are people who like to see individual articles i.e <a href="../../../x/t/v/XTV_0e5a.html" title="XTV">XTV</a>. I am personally in favour of individual articles. I know it has been suggested at some point in having an x-media article containing <a href="../../../x/-/n/X-Net_e8d4.html" title="X-Net">X-Net</a>, <a href="../../../e/x/e/Exepos%C3%A9.html" title="Exeposé">Exeposé</a>, <a href="../../../x/p/r/Xpression_FM_1491.html" title="Xpression FM">Xpression FM</a> and <a href="../../../x/t/v/XTV_0e5a.html" title="XTV">XTV</a>. But again I am in favour of having individual articles. The current text on <a href="../../../x/t/v/XTV_0e5a.html" title="XTV">XTV</a> is a copy from <a href="../../../n/a/s/NaSTA_0ebd.html" title="NaSTA">NaSTA</a> which is not ideal. If you would like to contribute to XTV then I would encourage you to do so. The page is currently on my watchlist so if anyone wants to delete the page they will have to put a deletion notice on the article which will flag up on my watchlist. I can then defend the article saying that I am against it being deleted. If you do contribute to the XTV article I would strongly recommend that you add the article to your watchlist.</dd>

<dd>Aside from wikipedia I think I used to demonstrate to you in second year lab in the school of physics at Exeter. I was a PhD student in Roy's group as well, under the supervision of Alastair. --<a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenjaminevans82_7c6f.html" title="User:Benjaminevans82">Benjaminevans82</a> 13:27, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Heh - small world no? I realised you were a fellow Exeter physicist, and sort of vaguely remembered the name but that was it - didn't realise you were ex-Photonics group too!</dd>
<dd>I think the X-Media article could be a good idea in some respects, but XTV would have a hard time fitting in both X-Media and NaSTA. It's OK for Xpression/Exepose as there are too many student papers and radio stations for them to be included in their relevant Association articles. But there are only a few student TV stations, so they fit in the NaSTA article.</dd>
<dd>For now, I'm going to draft (on my personal page) 'Student Media at the University of Exeter' - depending on how it turns out, I may suggest redirects and links instead of the XTV article, just to avoid having what boils down to the same content on multiple pages. I'm inclined to do this rather than have a separate article as I'm not sure there's more than a couple of paragraphs of encyclopedic text to be written about XTV. But there's no rush. Thanks for your help.<a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomisaac_a693.html" title="User:Tomisaac">Tomisaac</a> 12:54, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Personally I prefer to see individual articles even if it means that they are relatively small. But if you want to create "Student Media at the University of Exeter" then that would be fine. Do the Guild still use the term X-media for all four media organisations? If they do it might be worth called the article x-media. Let me know once you have finished and I can take a look at it. --<a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenjaminevans82_7c6f.html" title="User:Benjaminevans82">Benjaminevans82</a> 13:07, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
