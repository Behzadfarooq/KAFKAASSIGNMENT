<dl>
<dd>And this is what I don't understand. Why are you bringing up that they are a charitable organization? What does this have to do with theism or atheism? You gave the example of a PTA, and yeah, it makes sense that you can't join a PTA unless you are a parent or a teacher. But there's nothing that stops atheists from being "benevolent" or "protective". So the discrimination can only be described as prejudice. Try this one: "<i>What it is about blacks that makes them unqualified to join BPOE, is that <b>they're blacks</b>.</i>" The prejudice and hatred is obvious there, but you're saying the same thing about the BPOE and atheists and yet saying that it's <i>not</i> prejudice. I can't see what the difference is. You're not making any sense. —&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/e/User%7ECoelacan_3233.html" title="User:Coelacan">coe<span style="font-variant:small-caps">l</span>acan</a> <a href="../../../c/o/e/User_talk%7ECoelacan_3858.html" title="User talk:Coelacan"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">t</span>a<span style="font-variant:small-caps">lk</span></a> — 08:26, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It isn't that I am not making <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/sense" class="extiw" title="wikt:sense">sense</a>, it is your inability to <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/discern" class="extiw" title="wikt:discern">discern</a> sense from my simple statements, &amp; <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/descry" class="extiw" title="wikt:descry">descry</a> the same meaning from them which I intended in writing them, despite references &amp; links added.

<dd>Of course people's beliefs do change. But like catching influenza or winning a door prize, it is something that <i>happens</i>, not something one <i>does</i>. If one can simply change one's beliefs at will, prove me wrong: stop believing in your God right now, for five minutes. When you've done it, you can change right back and start believing again, since it's just a matter of choice, according to you. The fact is that you can't do it, no more than you can choose to believe that your keyboard is actually an apple pie. If you wanted to become an atheist, you could investigate the evidence, but if or when your beliefs actually changed, it would be an occurrence that you experienced, not something you did. It is prejudicial to deny membership to a person based on something that is beyond their control, and it is bigoted to say "you can't be in our club because you're incapable of believing what we do without sufficient evidence." And it is shameful to imagine that atheists are unable to act charitably and contribute positively toward the community, which can be the only legitimate criterion of membership for the Elks. It is truly sad that you are so eager to make all these excuses in defense of bigotry. To deny that prejudice is prejudice is to contribute further to it. —&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/e/User%7ECoelacan_3233.html" title="User:Coelacan">coe<span style="font-variant:small-caps">l</span>acan</a> <a href="../../../c/o/e/User_talk%7ECoelacan_3858.html" title="User talk:Coelacan"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">t</span>a<span style="font-variant:small-caps">lk</span></a> — 22:28, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I just asked why the BPOE discriminated against atheists. I was hoping for some answers that would be included in the article. You started using rhetoric to explain it all away and I disagreed with your premises. My intent was to clarify the issue as readily as possible so that it can be discussed in the article. I'm sorry if you felt I was soapboxing. I do not believe I have been at all incivil or made any personal attacks against you. The only thing I have said directly <i>to</i> you in any regard was that "<i>It is truly sad that you are so eager to make all these excuses in defense of bigotry.</i>" That is not a personal attack. And I'd appreciate it if you stop altering my talk page posts to add wikilinks that I did not add. It's very misleading. —&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/e/User%7ECoelacan_3233.html" title="User:Coelacan">coe<span style="font-variant:small-caps">l</span>acan</a> <a href="../../../c/o/e/User_talk%7ECoelacan_3858.html" title="User talk:Coelacan"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">t</span>a<span style="font-variant:small-caps">lk</span></a> — 00:32, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<s>Just another bunch of bigots. If a similar organization banned Christians from membership, it would become a national outrage and the cable news networks would be covering this 24-7. Of course, they're just discriminating against atheists, so no one cares and the general response is "get over it." Biggest Pigs on Earth.</s> Benfea 01:12, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Interesting that God issue was discussed so much at length. On that subject, you should note that much of the Elks rituals makes reference to God. I don't agree with the policy, but I wanted to explain why.</p>
<p>When my father belonged to the Elks, in the 60s and 70s, the race issue was a big one. The by laws specifically stated that the BPOE was a club for white men.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> I see that this has changed but I am suprised there is no discussion on the page of how that got changed. I do know it was very controvertial.</p>
<p>In their defence, I want to say, a significant ascpect of the Elks was charity work, which often benefitted people who were racial monorities.</p>
