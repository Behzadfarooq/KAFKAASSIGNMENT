<p>First of all, I apologize for having put this section at the top but it is the most important thing to discuss presently and it sort of sums up some discussions that have already been held elsewhere. The page has been blocked and now we need to solve each single point that generated the conflict (revert war). I propose that we take separate decisions on each question, that's why I will divide this section in subsections.</p>
<p>Let's use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Benito_Mussolini&amp;diff=72501036&amp;oldid=72441232" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Benito_Mussolini&amp;diff=72501036&amp;oldid=72441232" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> as a reference point. --<a href="../../../m/a/u/User%7EMauroVan_d285.html" title="User:MauroVan">MauroVan</a> 09:43, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There are many questions here. Most of them are triviliaties which I don't consider of vital imprtance to the article.

<p>New Comment - I agree. There is definitely an extent to which Mussolini's atheism is uncertain. So far all we have is a link to a page which makes the bald assertion that not only Mussolini, but also many other facists (unnamed) were atheists. People who have looked into Adolf Hitler will have noticed that Mein Kampf has all sorts of claims to his Christian beliefs, so I think a bit more evidence is required to show that Mussolini didn't have religious beliefs too. The other article linked to (the second reference) also makes the claim that Mussolini was an atheist, yet also gives no evidence.</p>
<p>Wait a minute: I badly remember details, but a famous anecdote tells that Mussolini (probably during his leadership in socialist party) once publicly was rudely blaspheme and said (more or less): "if God exists, then I am challenging him to incinerate me by a thunder in a minute time. If he will do it, I will believe he exists" and after a minute he conluded that God didn't exist. Now, this seems to have some compatibilty with the hypothesys tha Mussolini was an atheist...&#160;:-) --<a href="../../../g/i/a/User%7EGianfranco_7271.html" title="User:Gianfranco">g</a> 22:57, 17 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>There is little or no evidence that Mussolini was ever a practicing Catholic in adult life, though for political reasons he would certainly wish to give the appearance of religious orthodoxy. I know this is not really the place to discuss this issue, but since you have raised the question of Hitler and his beliefs, I would just like to say that there is little or nothing in <i>Mein Kampf</i> that would indicate any meaningful Christian understanding. References to religion tend to be of the 'providential' and 'supreme being' variety, along the lines promoted by Robespierre during the French Revolution. <a href="../../../w/h/i/User%7EWhite_Guard_fe26.html" title="User:White Guard">White Guard</a> 23:23, 17 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I find it very difficult to believe that Mussolini was a practicing Catholic, but this is not an important issue in politics and history. "Religion" for a politician and a statesman is quite a different thing than "personal religious beliefs". The same could be told about Hitler, nevertheless Hitler did attend religious events including the Mass, even if this is hardly remembered by the Catholic Church, for obvious reasons. --<a href="../../../m/a/u/User%7EMauroVan_d285.html" title="User:MauroVan">MauroVan</a> 18:18, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>My goodness; where do I start? Consider this "Naturally there is no such pure race...not even a Jewish one...Race: it is a sentiment, not a reality; it is 95% sentiment. I do not believe it is possible to prove biologically that a race is more or less pure...Anti-semitism does not exist in Italy. The Jews have always behaved well as citizens, and as soldiers, they have fought courageously." Who said this? Why, Mussolini in a conversation in 1932 with Emil Ludwig, the German-Jewish historian. Or what about the 1935 entry in the <i>Enciclopedia Italiana</i> under the heading Race;"..a race does not exist, but only a people and an Italian nation. There does not exist a Jewish race or nation, but a Jewish people; there does not exist, the gravest error of all, an Aryan race." In February 1934 when Il Duce met Chaim Weiseman, the leading Zionist, he gave him, at at Weiseman's request, a signed photo, and told him "Look after yourself. We still have need of you." I could go on in this vein.</p>
<p>What about the anti-Jewish laws (and they were anti- Jewish rather than anti-Semitic) of September 1938? This is the point from which Mussolini, out of a combination of fear and envy, was drawing closer to Hitler; but these measures fell well short of Nazi race laws. When Mussolini insisted that Roberto Farinacci dismiss his Jewish secretary-in case the Germans did not take his new measures seriously-he still gave him 50000 lire, then a large sum, to pay to her in redundancy money. If you really want to know the true character of racial anti-Semites I suggest you have a look at a copy-any copy-of <i>Der Stürmer</i>. Mussolini, I repeat, was not anti-Semitic. It is important we understand words and definitions and apply them properly; or do you really see him in the same bracket as Julius Streicher? <a href="../../../w/h/i/User%7EWhite_Guard_fe26.html" title="User:White Guard">White Guard</a> 22:48, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There's a big problem when talking about how Benito Mussolini "was". The problem is that this man was clearly an extreme opportunist. His personal opinions were always at striking variance with his public declarations and activity. Just consider the debate about his faith: he had himself baptized, he pursued a pro-Vatican policy, he was closely related with the conservative Roman Catholic Establishment, but one can hardly doubt that personally he didn't care much about religion. The same could be told about his attitude to traditional "family values" (combined with official mistresses etc.), his opinion on Adolf Hitler (whom he clearly disliked while being his closest ally and <i>de facto</i> puppet since the Axis was forged) etc.</dd>
<dd>I think we should bear this in mind while talking about he being or not an anti-Semite (by the way, "anti-Semite" is the same as "anti-Jewish", in the current meaning of the expression). We shouldn't try to read his mind about the Jews, we should consider his public actions because he was a public person. His public actions were: financing anti-Semitic propaganda in state-owned publications, enforcing anti-Semitic laws, assisting the Nazis in the deportation of Jewish families (babies included) to Auschwitz, Dachau etc. This makes Benito Mussolini, the dictator of Italy, an anti-Semite; if Benito Mussolini, the man, was dropping crocodile tears on his crimes when being alone (or maybe together with a "Jewish mistress") in his bed, that's not for the historian, that's for the psychiatrist. --<a href="../../../m/a/u/User%7EMauroVan_d285.html" title="User:MauroVan">MauroVan</a> 10:01, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There is no evidence of any negative action against Jewish people in the first sixteen years of the Fascist regime. Indeed, at the beginning of 1938 more than 10000 Jews, about a third of the adult population of Italy at the time, were members of the PNF. All the examples you mention are from the later years. Was <i>everything</i> Mussolini did opportunist; are you prepared to concede him nothing? Possibly not; but then you have to recognise your own POV. Can you read German? If so, I urge you to have a look at <i>Der Stürmer</i>. That could tell you far more about the difference between anti-Semitic and anti-Jewish than I ever could. <a href="../../../w/h/i/User%7EWhite_Guard_fe26.html" title="User:White Guard">White Guard</a> 12:24, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><i>"There is no evidence of any negative action against Jewish people in the first sixteen years of the Fascist regime"</i>... This is not a good argument. Do 16 years of "good behaviour" on Mussolini's part towards the Jews allow him to deport them in later years without being considered an anti-Semite?!</dd>
<dd>The sudden anti-Semitic turn of Mussolini just show the opportunist personality of the man and, more important for the historian, that racism and such ideologies are created on purpose when they are needed. Racism is not the result of the ignorance of a country's rulers, it's a conscious plan to find a scapegoat, to oppress a section of the population in order to exploit them economically etc.</dd>
<dd>About my personal opinion on Benito Mussolini, I consider him nearly without any positive quality. So what? Of course this is a POV and mine is extremely negative toward the dictator who ruled my country for more than 20 years. Once more: so what?</dd>
<dd>I can read a little German, in any case there's no difference in the current usage of "anti-Semitic" and "anti-Jewish".</dd>

We must be able to tell the difference between genuine, pathological Anti-Semitism (I gave the example of Julius Streicher) and opportunists like Mussolini; otherwise the whole thing risks sinking in a bog of relativism. <a href="../../../w/h/i/User%7EWhite_Guard_fe26.html" title="User:White Guard">White Guard</a> 22:59, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><i>The sudden anti-Semitic turn of Mussolini just show the opportunist personality of the man and, more important for the historian, that racism and such ideologies are created on purpose when they are needed. Racism is not the result of the ignorance of a country's rulers, it's a conscious plan to find a scapegoat, to oppress a section of the population in order to exploit them economically etc.</i>.</p>
<p><br />
No, this is backward reasoning, MauroVan. Racism is not the result of opportunism or conscious planning to manipulate people. Conscious planning to manipulate people and opportunism often <b>exploit</b> racism, sexism or other isms in order to achieve power . Racism itself is the erroneous belief that some human beings are superior to others based on their descent from certain sub-populations of the human species rather than others. There is no evidence, indeed there is evidence to the contrary, that Mussolini and the early fascists were anti-Jewish or racist in this sense. After 1938, he simply fell in line with the Nazi view because that was politically expedient. I oppose the categorization as Anti-Semite.

<dd>This is not a serious approach. A historian should deal with public behaviours and not with the psychology of individual prominent leaders. I don't think Mr Ahmadinedjad truly believes the things he says against the Jews, we should read his mind to know what he really thinks. The Czarist forgers of the Zion Protocols surely didn't, because they were perfectly conscious to be lying. Anyway, both are - of course - evident cases of anti-Semitism.</dd>
<dd>Listing <i>"pathological anti-Semites"</i>, as <a href="../../../w/h/i/User%7EWhite_Guard_fe26.html" title="User:White Guard">White Guard</a> named them (BTW, the Russian White Guard was a good example of anti-Semitism), has no historical interest, it would just reduce the whole issue to a mental pathology and no more a social phenomenon. If we were to use the same criterion elsewhere, we should tell that some Popes were not Christians, because they didn't seem to be intimately convinced, that Alcide De Gasperi was not an anti-Fascist since he voted in favour of Mussolini in 1922, that Vladimir Putin is probably an Atheist and not an Orthodox Christian as he pretends to be... and who can tell whether Lady Thatcher was really a <i>laissez-faire</i> Conservative and not an Anarchist in the secret inner core of her most intimate beliefs?</dd>
<dd>This is not history, this is gossip. I don't care what Mussolini thought about the Jews, he probably didn't care much too; in general this man didn't care at all about his ideas, he just wanted to reach his aims and ideas were mere tools.

<p>Quoting from a comment on the <a href="../../../f/a/s/Fascism.html" title="Fascism">fascism</a> talk page:</p>
<p><i>Richard Griffiths says, "Just as their was little anti-Semitism in Italy, there was equally little anti-Semitism in the movement, which benefited from Jewish founders in its early days, and which was joined by a higher percentage of the small Italian Jewish population than that of the Gentile population. It was only by the late Thirties, under the influence of Hitler's Germany, that that anti-Semitism was to play any important part in Mussolini's policies." (Fascism, pg. 38). Kevin Passmore says the same thing (he also gives instances where Italian policy was explicitly anti-anti-Semitic) except he says it's due also in part to a wave of anti-Semitism that arose all across Europe in '38 due to fear coming from the rise of Hitler (Fascism: A Very Short Introduction, pg. 117).

<p>It's a complex issue, but we have to proceed by way of example, and real history will always make room for motivation and, for that matter, gossip where it is relevant to the matter under debate. Was Nicholas II anti-Semitic and should he be included in this category? Was Phillipe Petain, for that matter? Well, they should be included if some of the above reasoning is followed, for both men were associated with states far more vigorous in their persecution of the Jews than Mussolini's Italy. But, as I say, as a historian I would always choose to proceed by way of example, and here are some more to add to those I have given above.</p>
<p>1. The Italians prevented the Vichy authorities rounding up Jews in those areas of France under their control. They also cancelled the Vichy law obliging Jews to wear the Star of David. In Rome the Foreign Office issued instructions to the consul-general in Nice, saying "It is not possible to permit the forcible transfer of Jews. The measures to protect the Jews, both foreign and Italian, must be taken exclusively by our organs." To ensure that Jewish people were not arrested the Italians insisted that only they, and not the French police or the <i>Milice</i>, could take such action. Aware of this many refugees fled south; in May 1943 some 4500 had entered the Isere area alone.</p>
<p>2. The occupying authorities in Athens likewise did not require the wearing of the yellow star, and Italian guards were placed outside the central synagogue to protect people from pro-Nazi Greeks.</p>
<p>3. Italian generals in the occupied areas of Yugoslavia refused to hand over the Jews to the Germans.</p>
<p>In none of these cases were the civilian or military authorities reprimanded by Mussolini, nor did he countermand their actions. When pressed by Himmler and Ribbentrop in February 1943 he said that he would comply, ordering the commanders in Croatia to round up the Jews and send them to Trieste for deportation to Poland. Only a few days after this order was issued it was followed by a telegram, "It is true that I have been obliged to give my consent to the expulsion. But you can use all the excuses that you like, so as not to hand over a single Jew. Say that we don't have the means to transport them by sea to Trieste, and that transport by land is impossible." Not long afterwards the commanders in France received fresh instructions from the High Command in Rome: "As regards the measures proposed by <i>Il Duce</i> in reference to the Jews: no. 1 priority is to save the Jews living in French territory occupied by our troops whatever their nationality, be they Italian, French or foreigners."</p>
<p>This is what he <i>did</i> about the Jews. Is this the action of an anti-Semite? The extraordinary action against the Italian Jews came during the German occupation of the north, not at the behest of Mussolini. Again I ask for this issue to be looked at dispassionately, free, if possible, from residual hostility and political prejudice. Sadly, I am not optimistic. <a href="../../../w/h/i/User%7EWhite_Guard_fe26.html" title="User:White Guard">White Guard</a> 23:56, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>very hard for us, Europeans of XXI century, to fully understand the social and political climate of the pre-WWII Europe (and not in Germany, Italy and allied countries only). What to us appear now unacceptable and unforgivable, on those times seemed almost normal (at least, "normal" and acceptable in that exceptional pre-bellic situation). No doubt that anti-semitism is absolutely far away from the vast majority of Italians, and of their rulers as well (Mussolini included), and no doubt that Mussolini's anti-Jewish acts were inspired <b>only</b> by his mighty German ally, and absolutely <b>NOT</b> by Italian public opinion. But, all the same, those acts <b>were</b> made, and the responsibility of them is on him too.

<dd>Victor Emanuel II signed off on the racial laws, thus giving his seal of approval under extraordinary pressure. In the sense that you are talking about, wouldn't this would make him too an anti-Semite? And what about Marshall Petain and the many other collaborator regimes who were more actively and enthusiastically anti-Semitic in their policies? I think there should be some way to distinguish this kind of ideological anti-semitism from the obvious opportunism of Mussolini and co. I simply do not find the case for anti-semitism convincing. Here's another admittedly imperfect analogy that might be useful: many governors and politicians in the south of the US supported segregation out of concern for state's rights and/or political opportunism. Many of these same people were absolutely NOT racist. Should they all be classified as anti-black because the consequences of their positions were destructive toward blacks. How do we distinguish such people from obvious ideological racists in the Ku Klux Klan and similar organizations? --<a href="../../../l/a/c/User%7ELacatosias_a9d0.html" title="User:Lacatosias">Francesco Franco aka Lacatosias</a> 07:38, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have considerable experience of archives. Those who work with documents will know that there are all sorts of false leads, and it is important to recognise them as such. If this document really exists-and is not a forgery-it is a definite false lead. Why on earth should Hitler care about excommunication? He had been baptised as a Catholic, true, but he never once in his adult life attended church or took confession. In 1934 Mussolini, by positive action, had prevented German intervention in Austria. Why, four years later, was he simply content to refer the matter in such a lame way to the Vatican? It simply makes no sense. We know from his conversations with Prince Philip of Hesse that he accepted Hitler's 1938 intervention in a 'friendly manner'; why do that and then attempt such an intrigue with the Pope, which was bound to have negative results? <a href="../../../w/h/i/User%7EWhite_Guard_fe26.html" title="User:White Guard">White Guard</a> 23:01, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>My first comment on this excommunication story was <i>"It's a hoax"</i>. I don't think it's so relevant and once more it looks to me like a subtle attempt to depict Mussolini as a better man than he was. I just disagree on the relation between Hitler and the Roman Catholic Church: this is an aspect of Adolf Hitler that's been constantly manipulated for decades by post-war Vatican propagandists wishing to hide their connection to the Fascist regimes, which were (almost always, I can only recall the exception of Orthodox Christian Fascism in Rumania) all widely seen as Roman Catholic regimes (Mussolini, Franco, Salazar, Hitler, Pavelić...).</dd>

<p>The worst 'Fascist' regime (was Salazar really Fascist; was Franco for that matter?) was Protestant, not Catholic, if such regimes can be truly said to have any confessional basis. If you look at voting patterns in Germany prior to 1933 you will see that Nazi support is concentrated in the Protestant north of the country. Most of the Catholic south, and that includes Munich, the Nazi <i>Hauptamt</i>, remained solid behind the Catholic Centre Party. <a href="../../../w/h/i/User%7EWhite_Guard_fe26.html" title="User:White Guard">White Guard</a> 12:31, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Salazar and Franco are not properly Fascists, in my strict vision of what Fascism really is, they're more the leaders of Pinochet-like military dictatorial regimes giving Fascist-like speeches.

<p>I can assure that this is quite representative of the average opinion in Italy: this can be testified by anyone that has a familiarity with Italian comical entertainment, where humorous depictions of Fascist party members and Mussolini himself can be seen often; those are used not only to make an anti-fascist statement but much for their pure satiric value. An example is the "Fascists on Mars" <a href="../../../m/o/c/Mockumentary.html" title="Mockumentary">mockumentary</a> by Guzzanti, created as a protest against historical <a href="../../../r/e/v/Revisionism.html" title="Revisionism">revisionism</a>, but also just for making fun of the pompous fascists spewing early-thirties rhetoric on a ridiculous and pointless quest.</p>

<dd>I'm Italian and I can assure that Mussolini isn't considered an idiot at all. A big part of Italian people consider Mussolini as an evil man, but there's also a significant number of people who consider Mussolini in a "neutral" way: he made many mistakes, but he also improved italian industry and realized Stazione Centrale in Milan, railways, roads and the whole city of Latina.</dd>
</dl>
<p>I'm not talking about a revaluation of Mussolini (that's a neo-fascist creation) but it's really important to know that Mussolini wasn't a "monster" a "non-human creature" a "Hitler's weaker clone". He was a man that was loved and hated at the same time.</p>

<dd>In Greek and Albany italian army was often defeatet. The german army came to help italian people and did the in-famous disaster. In Ethiopia italian army defeated a poor nation and THAT has no excuse. But italian also built bridges, wells and roads in that few years of the colony. Ethiopian people are still using italian infrastructures today. French who invaded a lot of island in the pacific, then Morocco, Senegal, Algeria, etc. are excused. Mussolini is a monster. Why? I got the answer: because we lost the war and French won. Mussolini made many mistakes, some of them terrible mistakes. But I do not understand: Mussolini ordered to invade Albany and Ethiopia and he has not to be excused. Truman ordered the atomic bomb and he is "good". CNL in Italy killed 80 innocent people in Schio and they are celebrated as "heroes who defeated facism". Can you tell me why only some massacres and people are "good"?</dd>

<dd>Actually, I didn't know he invaded <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albany.html" title="Albany">Albany</a>, <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_3da4.html" title="New York">New York</a>!! That's interesting news. I'll have to look that one up. The rules here are to sign your name on talk pages. Many Italians, like yourself, make me feel profoundly ill and ashamed that I wasn't born of a different nationality. It's bacially the only country that refuses to face up to its hideous totalitarisn past. As somone correctly pointed out below, the only difference between Musso and AH is that Musso was a failure even at evil. If he had had the capabilities of the Luftwaffe, the German panser division and so on, he would have done worse than Hitler. So what you're basically saying, anyway, is that Hitler was not so very bad after all, since Truman dropped the A-bomb (appropiately in my opinon, saving the hundered millions of lives that wuld have been lòst in a full invasion of Japan))? Give me a break. Some people are fundemnatally evil and othere are not. It's as simple as that. Ted Bundy was evil. People who spend their lives working to save other's lives and engaining on other self-sacrificing activities are not. Why? That's a very complex question there: bad genes, bad social eniroment, some combination of the two, free will? The debate goes on. But the fact rests that some folks do horrible, destructive things and others do not.--<a href="../../../l/a/c/User%7ELacatosias_a9d0.html" title="User:Lacatosias">Francesco Franco aka Lacatosias</a> 10:25, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You have to be ashamed cause you're talking about "race". I'm italian but you don't know the color of my skin.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Ashamed to be Italian? Franco, it's people like you that weaken nations. To say that Italy is the only country that "refuses to face up to its hideous totalitarisn past" is a joke. Look at Japan. Does that country face it's past? Absolutely not. To even compare Hitler and Mussolini is beyond stupidity. Where as Hitler was "cleanseing" Europe of Jews, Mussolini was saving them. Yeah, he really sounds like a monster. But wait! What about alledged Italian war crimes committed under the Fascist government? Oh right, no one was tried or convicted. Hmm...what about the alliance with Hitler? That was bad, wasn't it? Yes, it was a bad decision, but with that decision, Mussolini spared a German occiupation of Italy for four years. As well, what option did he have? Yes, England, America, and France would sure have welcomed him as an ally right? Right after they shunned him and forced him to an alliance with the only other power in Europe that was not trying to sanction Italy in some way. That is common historical fact. Oh, and on your little "fact" about Truman and the A-Bomb on Japan, it would not have cost "hundered millions of lives that wuld have been lòst in a full invasion of Japan". Calculations by the American government came to a total of ten thousand Allied troops would be killed on an invasion of the mainland, and that was without the Soviet Union intervieneing in the war. Well now, those ten thousand were sure as hell worth the over half million killed with two drops of the Atomic Bomb. I am both shocked and appaled that you are able to edit wikipedia, with both your ovbious bias against fact, as well as Italy. Maybe you should read a book, or better yet READ the website that you edit. You may learn something. - Izzo (and stop deleting this post without reason or cause, I'll just post it back again)</dd>

<p>These 2 sentences made me choke on my miso:</p>
<p>"In fact, Mussolini has been said to have saved more Jews than even <a href="../../../o/s/k/Oskar_Schindler_3baa.html" title="Oskar Schindler">Oskar Schindler</a>. Later, he would refuse to allow Jews to be deported to concentration camps until Germany occupied Italy during the war (a period depicted in the movie, <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Garden_of_the_Finzi-Continis_d818.html" title="The Garden of the Finzi-Continis">The Garden of the Finzi-Continis</a></i>)."</p>
<p>...and I would like to see the assertion footnoted if it's true. Who said it? <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChaikney_4f05.html" title="User:Chaikney">Chaikney</a> 22:25, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>It's a well know historical fact that Jews weren't deported from Italy. Jews in Vichy France, which was policed by the Italians, weren't required to wear the Yellow star.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Mussolini <i>did</i> persecute the Jews in order to impress Hitler; I was unaware of any claims that he was a savior to the Jews in Europe.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Mussolini gave 6000 jews circa to Gestapo. One of them was <a href="../../../p/r/i/Primo_Levi_c5e0.html" title="Primo Levi">Primo Levi</a>. So he did persecute the Jews. Some people said that he wanted to impress Hitler, others that he was under pressure. It's also a fact that facism did not persecute jews in its "dogma": in fact Mussolini had a jew lover and many jew friends.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Absolutely true that Mussolini did persecute the Jews. Absolutely false that Italian Fascism had no anti-Semitism in its "dogma": just consider that a state-funded magazine called <i>La difesa della razza</i> (<i>The defence of the race</i>) was published by prominent Fascist "intellectuals". I even saw with my own eyes original propaganda posters from the Fascist era depicting a "Jewish embryo" (with big nose, <i>kippah</i> and everything) and a label reading something like <i>"1950. Jew, a race now extincted thanks to some very wise men"</i>. Italian Fascism was much more similiar to German Nazism than is usually recognized. The fact that Mussolini, as a man, was such a ridiculous clown didn't make him, as a dictator, less dangerous and blood-thirsty than Hitler. His regime was just weaker and less organized (like all Italian governments in history). Example: <a href="http://www2.varesenews.it/articoli/2003/giornomemoria2003/memoria/memoria/difesa/difesa00.htm" class="external text" title="http://www2.varesenews.it/articoli/2003/giornomemoria2003/memoria/memoria/difesa/difesa00.htm" rel="nofollow">Some covers and pictures from <i>La difesa della razza</i></a> --<a href="../../../m/a/u/User%7EMauroVan_d285.html" title="User:MauroVan">MauroVan</a> 08:53, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My impression, perhaps wrong, was that overall Italian Fascism was more cultural than racial and viewed Jews as a foreign culture and hated them for that reason but allowed Jews if they acted Italian. Primo Levi's example shows that deportation of Jews did not pick up until the Italian Social Republic was installed and it became a Nazi puppet, Primo Levi himself didn't realize the extent of the anti-Semitism because he thought he would be punished more for him being a partisan than for him being a Jew. There was definitely less of a genetic obsession in Italian Facism than in Nazism. Though given the extreme nationalism that defined Facism, large scale anti-Semitism of both cultural and genetic types would easily florish, and whatever the official dogma of the Facist party, both types of anti-Semitism would find plenty of very nationalist intellectuals willing to make propaganda. I think it really would be a mistake to equate Italian Facism as Nazism lite, they differ in emphasis and some areas of dogma and policy in my mind, though they are alike enough to be placed in the umbrella term Facism. And I think that it would a mistake to regard Mussolini's regime as weak, it had widespread popular support and while corruption weakened it, it had a powerful state apparatus. A simple of its power can be seen in the fact that it accomplished an age old goal of Italian governments, suppressing the Sicilian Mafia (through massive civil rights violations, and the Mafia was able to start up quickly after the war due to mistakes of American occupation, anti-communism, and the lessening of the state power and civil rights violations of the post-WWII Italian government) Jztinfinity 18:54, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Could someone please cite a source for this quote? - japhyfoo@backword.net</li>
</ul>
<p>I have spent several months trying to find this quote. It appears to be a very bad translation of a section on corporatism supposedly written by Mussolini for the Enciclopedia Italiana (1932), but several English translations do not contain anything like this quote. Chip Berlet &lt;cberlet@igc.org&gt;.</p>
<p>moved off main page left quote on that page <a href="../../../s/m/i/User%7ESmith03_8e63.html" title="User:Smith03">User:Smith03</a></p>
<p>Berlet: I have tracked down the original 1935 English version of Mussolini's pamphlet, Mussolini, Benito. 1935. "The Doctrine of Fascism." (Firenze: Vallecchi Editore), which is listed as a translation of Mussolini's article in the Enciclopedia Italiana (1932). The quote above does not appear. Nor does it appear in a longer booklet which contains "The Doctrine of Fascism" as a chapter:</p>
<p>Mussolini, Benito. 1935. "Fascism: Doctrine and Institutions." (Rome: 'Ardita' Publishers).</p>
<p>I asked a scholar in Europe to find the quote in the Enciclopedia Italiana (1932), and he said he could not find a sentence that translates into the quote above. Until someone who reads Italian, and checks the Enciclopedia Italiana (1932), and finds there is a sentence that can be accureatly translated into the above quote, I think the quote should not be listed. Chip Berlet &lt;cberlet@igc.org&gt;.</p>

<p>I went and copied the original article in the <i>Enciclopedia Italiana</i>, in case anyone wants to pick a page it is supposed to be on. If someone wants to argue this quote exists, please cite the page and paragraph from this or another original document. In the meantime, here are some actual quotes from English tranlations.</p>
<dl>
<dd>The Fascist conception of the State is all-embracing; outside of it no human or spiritual values can exist, much less have value. Thus understood, Fascism is totalitarian, and the Fascist State--a synthesis and a unit inclusive of all values--interprets, develops, and potentiates the whole life of a people. (p. 14)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Fascism recognises the real needs which gave rise to socialism and trade-unionism, giving them due weight in the guild or corporative system in which diverent interests are coordinated and harmonised in the unity of the State. (p.15)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Yet if anyone cares to read over the now crumbling minutes giving an account of the meetings at which the Italian <i>Fasci di Combattimento</i> were founded, he will find not a doctrine but a series of pointers… (p. 23)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>"It may be objected that this program implies a return to the guilds (<i>corporazioni</i>). No matter!... I therefore hope this assembly will accept the economic claims advanced by national syndicalism." (p. 24)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Fascism is definitely and absolutely opposed to the doctrines of liberalism, both in the political and economic sphere. (p. 32)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The Fascist State lays claim to rule in the economic field no less than in others; it makes its action felt throughout the length and breadth of the country by means of its corporate, social, and educational institutions, and all the political, economic, and spiritual forces of the nation, organised in their respective associations, circulate within the State.

<p>This biography goes into a lot of detail about Mussolinis death, etc. He and his mistress were shot outside the Villa Belmonte. The guns didnt work properly. His mistress was shot first as she grabbed the barrel of the gun. Mussolini held back the lapels of his jacket and said "Shoot me in the chest" (his last words). It took another shot to finish him off. They were taken in a removals van along with the bodies of 15 other high-ranking fascists and dumped in the Pizzale Loreto. Eventually Mussolini and his mistress (and two other people according to the photo) were strung up upside down so that the large crowd which had gathered could see them. I think this book is well worth reading if your interested in Mussolini. I've only read the final part so far. It also gives several pages evaluating the worth of the various sources, plus a very long bibliography. I do not know how to edit the article page, hence putting it here. Sorry, been having a lot of problems trying to add to this page without erasing other peoples comments. What I thought was a 2 minute job has now taken over an hour. If this final edit does not work, perhaps someone else can sort it out for me, as I'm giving up. Thanks. Archie.</p>

I am a left-winger myself, so I have no special need to slander the socialists (as I assume people using "Roman-Catholic" vs. "Atheist" or vice-versa have had), nor is this connected with the idiotic pretense that state ownership=fascism. Mussolini's activities in the PSI cover an important part of his life, and the controversies he had with the rest of the party are covered only too well here and in other articles - so no one should view this as somehow incriminating the rest of the PSI. However, if I am wrong and this was erased by fascists who want to cover their tracks according to the demands of their own ideology, then I ask them to go and dunk their heads in pools of crap.

<p>This seems undeserving of a section, it seems like a historical curiosity than an important facet of Mussolini's life, unless he says somewhere that this was the love of his life, this should be lessened in importance, given maybe a sentence or two.

<p>The section, and also the biographic article on Sarfatti herself, doesn't mention a not uninteresting fact about her: she wrote the first biography of Mussolini, published first in England as <i>The life of Benito Mussolini</i> in 1925 and the following year in Italy as <i>Dux</i>. --<a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETridentinus_b0bf.html" title="User:Tridentinus">Tridentinus</a> 10:16, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><i>Pensive</i> is not an appropriate description, unless Mussolini actually <i>told</i> the photographer that he felt pensive and the photographer noted that somewhere.

<p>In the section "Early Years" we read the following: "After his return to Italy ... he joined the staff of the "Central Organ of the Socialist Party", Avanti!... Mussolini had a brother, Arnaldo, who would later become the editor of Il Popolo d'Italia, the official newspaper of Benito Mussolini's Fascist Party (November 1922)." The section ends, and the next section, entitled "Birth Of Fascism" has the following "These syndicalists formed a group called Fasci d'azione rivoluzionaria internazionalista in October 1914. Massimo Rocca and Tulio Masotti asked Mussolini to settle the contradiction of his support for interventionism and still being the editor of Avanti!..." Firstly, the line about his brother seems to have no relation to the rest of the paragraph, and is misplaced in that it is out of chronologically out of context too. I.e. we are reading about events of 1910, we then read a mention of his brother and 1922, and then we are again reading about 1914 and Mussolini's attitude towards intervention. The next problem is, that when we left him in the previous section Mussolini had merely joined the staff of Avanti, and now he is the editor; a mention should be made of his accession to the editorship, I should think.Hi There 08:48, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The last half of the last paragraph in the section "Fascist Dictatorship" contains the following sentence: "But his "axis" with Germany was confirmed when he made the "Pact of Steel" with Hitler in May 1939. Clearly the subordinate partner, Mussolini followed the Nazis in adopting a racial policy that led to persecution of the Jews and the creation of apartheid in the Italian empire. Before this, Jews were not specifically persecuted by Mussolini's government, and were permitted to be high members of the Party. Members of TIGR, a Slovene anti-fascist group, plotted to kill Mussolini in Kobarid in 1938, but were unsuccessful. One of Mussolini's famous quotes is "If I retreat, kill me"". I have removed this sentence because it is repeated nearly verbatim in the following section "The Axis of Blood and Steel." Hi There 17:46, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Let's go through a bit of the history of what haappend in the last 20 minutes or so. User:Kurt changed the photo in the infobox to the current version. In the editbox, he wrote that someone had called him a fascist. I certainly had not called Kurt a fascist as far as I can remember. However, I did not like the photo and reverted back, sugessting that it was "too propanganstic" and might give an impression of bias. Kurt reverted back and explinaed that the milairy uniform was more appropoate. I accepted the point, but then I removed some of the other photos because I though the article was starting to look gaudy and shrine-like. Kurt disagrees. That's all there is to it. I will leave it up to the consensus of editors to decide. There should be no edit-warring about the matter.--<a href="../../../l/a/c/User%7ELacatosias_a9d0.html" title="User:Lacatosias">Francesco Franco aka Lacatosias</a> 14:29, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>It was just a small point of-neutral-clarification, and I had really no wish to enter into a debate over semantics. Let it remain as 'executed' if you wish. I do, however, contest your point about the Fascist state simply being the will of one man; it was far more complex than that. And for a murderous collection of Communist bandits to be defined as 'the law' is, I think, a statement rich in irony. I have always wondered why they were in such a hurry to 'execute' Mussolini rather than to have him face trial Nuremberg style? There may, I suspect, have been some fears about the possible outcome of such a process. <a href="../../../w/h/i/User%7EWhite_Guard_fe26.html" title="User:White Guard">White Guard</a> 22:41, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I can assure you of one thing, comrade: I am not your friend. I care nothing about your-or your grandfather's-political affiliations. You gave obvious clues to your true loyalties by your ludicrous rant about Ceausescu and the Catholic Church. I started this discussion over a quite innocent point about the nature and circumstances of Mussolini's death. I did not expect that, in so short a space of time, it would lead me to the intense dislike and suspicion of someone I have never met, or ever likely to meet. You really are a very emotional and immature individual, too much so, I suspect, for rational adult debate. You must be under a lot of stress. Might I suggest you take a break, have a rest and calm down? Before replying to any of this-if reply you desire-have a seditive or count slowly up to a hundred: it may help you to think rationally.

<p>The Partisans were ordered to kill Mussolini by the leadership of the Resistance movement. The man who's widely considered to be the material executor of the killing, the Communist Walter Audisio, declared to have received the order from general Raffaele Cadorna who was hardly a Communist.</p>
<p>In my opinion, killing Mussolini was the best thing to do in that context and I really don't care whether it was the decision of some wise individuals or the decision of an official body.</p>
<p>Had not he been killed, he would have probably be freed by the Allies or by the Italian "Antifascist" state itself, as happened to most Italian war criminals. There was never anything like a Nuremberg trial in Italy after the war, on the opposite the Fascists found an easy way to freedom and hundreds of former Partisans and Antifascists were put in jail. The far-sighted act of cutting short Mussolini's life managed at least to prevent the man from being recycled later.</p>
<p>However, I would use the word <i>"kill"</i> which doesn't convey any moral judgement on the action. <i>"Murder"</i> does, therefore it's absolutely unacceptable. --<a href="../../../m/a/u/User%7EMauroVan_d285.html" title="User:MauroVan">MauroVan</a> 13:46, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

Comrade, comrade, you condemn yourself by your own words, which you seem incapable of understanding. I quote&#160;; "...Ceacessu (sic) the Communist, on the other hand, was given a <b>phony trial</b> (why??? couldn't find anything on him?) and assasinated (sic) by the White Guards of the Catholic Church." They are your words; read them over if you wish, just to make sure. And you say you are not a Communist? I find that hard to believe. You are certainly highly irrational, which, for a student of philosophy, must be a real handicap. I have no intention of joining you on your talk page, or anywhere else, and as far as I am concerned this debate is at an end. I repeat, however, that I have an eye on you, and will be immediately aware of any Red distortions of the truth. Go on, have the last word; it is not in your nature to resist. <a href="../../../w/h/i/User%7EWhite_Guard_fe26.html" title="User:White Guard">White Guard</a> 22:41, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Read and try and make sense of some of his ranting-the suggestion, amongst other things, that I might just be a Fascist and Holocaust denier, and his ludicrous conjecture about the Catholic Church and Ceausescu. If he dosen't want his opinions discussed he should not offer them; I certainly did not ask to receive them. You are a Communist? You have my deepest sympathies, comrade; I've always considered it more as a political disease rather than a system of ideas. Mussolini, in his early days, did much to save Italy from this contagion. My point of view, of course. <a href="../../../w/h/i/User%7EWhite_Guard_fe26.html" title="User:White Guard">White Guard</a> 09:46, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thank you for drawing my attention to that interesting 'debate'. I can assure you, comrades both, that I will never descend to petty personal abuse-unlike Mr. Franco-which I believe to be a sure sign of a childish and incoherent mind.

<p>Since it appears that this discussion resulted into nothing more than a fight, I have taken to reverting the edits myself. In order not to lean to one view, with the term "murdered", not to lean to the other view with the term "executed", I have replaced the word executed with the word shot/killed. This is neutral in both senses, neither leaning towards the left or right, nor conveying any kind of political agenda. It creates and gives the artical the atmosphere of neutrality, which should and hopefully remain with this article always. - Izzo</p>
<p>Once again someone has reverted the areticle to say "Execution" instead of the agreed upon "shootings". Please, DO NOT REVERT this part of the article. It is there for the sole purpose of objectivity, that neither "murdered"or "executed" can deliver. If it is reverted again without reason, I will request protection for this page. If you disagree with me, please say so on this part of the article where your ideas can be expressed. (December 28, 2006) - Izzo</p>

<p>pls remember that <b>History books are always written by winners</b> ... besides that, no-matter if "murdered or executed", the exact circumstances of Mussolini and Petacci deaths are not clear at all, after over 60 years. There are also serious speculations and witnesses that they were killed by British intelligence, to take possession of secret documents proving that Mussolini and Churchill were negotiating a separate peace, in anti-soviet function. The it.wiki article deals with this theory, which has been also told in some Italian state television broadcasts. According to this theory the partisans arrived too late, and only made a "dummy" execution, to carry on the sentence issued by Italian CLN.

<dd>Quick and simple answer: Are you seriously suggesting that the <i>The Italian wikipedia</i> is to be taken seriously. I have yet to come across an article there that would even pass GA status over here. I once consulted the The Italian wikipedia article on fascism and found that it claimed "Garibaldi, a member of the masonic lodge blah, blah, blah, invented the term fascio." I asked for a citation in three or four places and received no response for about three weeks. So, I then proceeded to cut it out. No one noticed for about three months!!</dd>
<dd>I translated an FA article on David Hilbert from that.....thing.....and, as a result, I have been bombarded by questions about the sources of various ridiculous statements. There are only two references on the bottom of the page (no in-line cites, nothing!!) and, since they were on mathematics and not biography, they were almost certainly not the sources of the statements. Please take a look at the Italian wiki article on Giacomo Leopardi. It looks like it was done by a group of seven-year-olds. the explanation for the deletion is that, on the English wikipeida, if you don't provide a credible, verifiable source for any text, it can be deleted spot on. Period. Mediaset is NOT a credible source, BTW.--<a href="../../../l/a/c/User%7ELacatosias_a9d0.html" title="User:Lacatosias">Francesco Franco aka Lacatosias</a> 08:35, 6 September 2006 (UTC)

The reportage of RAI 3 channel "La grande Storia" broadcast (in 2004) was based also on the work of an American journalist, Peter Thompkins, who was an <a href="../../../o/f/f/Office_of_Strategic_Services_f08f.html" title="Office of Strategic Services">OSS</a> agent in <a href="../../../m/i/l/Milan.html" title="Milan">Milan</a> in the end of WWII. He claimed to have tried to get info from British official archive, but he was told that the documents on this matter (existing) remain still nowadays classified top secret. As far as I know the exhumation of Mussolini's body has the goal to prove that the position of the bullets holes don't correspond to the positions of the holes in the military uniform M wore in Piazzale Loreto, a discrepancy witnessed by others as well before he was interred. The conclusion of the "British path" supporters is that M (already arrested by the partisans) was killed in the morning of April 28, after he spent his last night, by two British agents (one of whom was the Italian partisan Bruno Giovanni Lonati, still alive and interviewed by RAI 3, who got information of the house where he and Petacci were under custody). The partisans formation lead by Colonnello Valerio, charged with the task to execute the death sentence issued by CLN, arrived in the afternoon and should have organized the scene of an "official" execution for reasons of political convenience. In my opinion, even if there is so far not enough evidence to give this theory more credit than the official ones, it has enough to be quoted on WP has an "alternative one". -- <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarius_b7cc.html" title="User:Marius">@</a> <a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarius_d603.html" title="User talk:Marius"><sup>_</sup></a> 04:31, 7 September 2006 (UTC)

<p>yeah, I close to left (even not being "commy"). Why do you think that this "British path" theory concerning Mussolini's death is somehow "anti-American"? If you want "anti-British", NOT anti-American. The core question is: everybody was interested to endorse this version of Mussolini's death: Britons, who don't want to be accused of betraying the anti-Nazi pact stipulated with their allies, other allies, who didn't want to deteriorate their relations with Soviet-Union, Italian communists, who wanted to be accepted in the post-war western countries, and so on (other Italian parties, for instance). In every crime, when you have a "motive" and some "witnesses", their is a growing possibility you're getting closer to the truth. I repeat: it's worth while going on with investigations. Just another clue: why Churchill spent most of his post-war holidays seasons in Italy exactly on the same places (Garda Lake, Como Lake) where Mussolini spent his last times, followed by a lot of his former wartime intelligence collaborators? -- <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarius_b7cc.html" title="User:Marius">@</a> <a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarius_d603.html" title="User talk:Marius"><sup>_</sup></a> 08:09, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Because Italian are notorious for conspiracy theories and are never willing to take responsibility for anything that happens in theory own country. It's always the fault of some external influences: the old Soviet Union, the US, the British, the Church, international Freemasons. Who killed Aldo Moro? The BR did. Period. Italians kill other Italians. Who's behind Provenzano? Other Italian mafiosi. Who was responsible for all the violence in the seventies: Italian fascist and communist terrorist organizations. Who killed Matteoti? Mussolini's henchman. Who is responsible for war crimes committed against the partisans and viceversa during the public of Salo and after the war: not the Germans or the british or the Americans. Italians did it to themselves. Who killed Pope John Paul I? He died of natural causes!!

But you're right that I cannot deny the opportunity to other people to know about this and judge for themselves. I have not been feeling well lately, and consequently have been taking out my anger with the universe on the rest of humanity. But never mind. You know what I would like from you, and perhaps Maurovan or others who can write Italian infinitely better than I can, is to help me translate some of the FA and GA philosophy articles I have written (well, mostly written, since I do not OWN them unfortunately) into Italian when I get the time and energy. I think this might possible be extremely useful since there is not much exposure to analytic philosophy in Italy and they are also extremely good articles. You would not have to translate them yourself. I would try to do that.

<dd>Francesco I respect your opinion, but just let me do an obvious (by common sense) reasoning. I agree that some people see conspiracy everywhere, ruling-out the possibility that a single person, without the background of some big organisation, is able to perpetrate big crimes or spectacular actions: that's a nonsense of course, history is full of "free-lance" actors like this. But, at least, can you concede that sometimes and somewhere, some kind of conspiracy might also happen? Or do you think that an intelligence service very seldom makes "aimed" killings? Your position seems to me (but it's just a personal opinion) based on some a-priori skeptical attitude against any kind of hypothesis that contains some conspiracy element, that is against a "working hypothesis itself", without any attempt to examine the facts and fonts available, even with possibility to find out that they are weak -- <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarius_b7cc.html" title="User:Marius">@</a> <a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarius_d603.html" title="User talk:Marius"><sup>ciao</sup></a> 05:03, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You Wikis just love to argue for the sake of arguing. Someone once said that "Wikipedia is just an enormous forum for endless arguments on any topic you can imagine"-. I often think this is not far from the truth. Anyway, NO I don't believe that conspiracies never happen. The Watergate conspiracy, for example, was a conspiracy to undermine the opposition. But it was eventually revealed and shown to be a bumbling, foolish act of nonsense. I DO, however, have an a priori skeptical attitude toward conspiracy theories in general. I am a member of CICAP and believe that conspiracies are extraordinary claims similar to supernatural phenomena. And extraordinary claims, as Carl Sagan put it, require extraodinary evidence. I don't see that here. There are 35,000 we site devoted to conspiracy theories about the death of Princess Diana alone. Am I supposed to examine all of these possibilities one by one and determine whether there is some validity to them? No, I can simply reject them until such time as the evidence becomes so substantial and <b>superior to the evidence for the current explanation</b> that I am literally forced to accept it as the better explanation. This is how science works. To use an analogy that Karl Popper once used to explain this sort of thing, I just this moment invented the "theory" that cause and effect do not really exist in the currently accepted sense. Instead, what happens is that a tiny elf steps in and makes sure that each "effect" is carried out according to his plans. This is hypothesis 1. Now, here's the point. I can then formulate a second hypothesis that there are actually two elves involved. I can formulate 3,4,5,6,7......aleph null and beyond hypotheses about infinite infinitesimal elves. Is it appropriate to eliminate them a priori? Of course. Nothing would be accomplished otherwise. As to conspiracy theories, most of them are based on the fallacy of finding connections and coincidences and then imagining that they are significant.

<dd>Absolutely on your same line: this theory is, so far, "weaker" than the "official" one.

<dd>As to Verifiability, I just briefly scanned over the three sources you cite above. The book review is, to my mind, a solid source. It is a book by a professional historian published by a reputable publishing house. Even the RAI article could serve as a verifiable source. The problem it that these are in Italian and may not be consideree verifiable on an English-langauge article. The English article is intersting but seems unclear about what exactly the British did (supply weapons and training, what't the big deal about that?) and the resistence did. I'm also unsure about the source. Seriosuly, Is the CIA.gov a reliable source? I don't know. I would allow it. But I'm sure there will be a great brouhaha here.

<p>There is far too much detail here on atrocities in Ethiopia. This information would be better placed in an article on the Italian war in East Africa rather than in an page which proports, after all, to be a biography of Mussolini. Also I would like to see some better treatment on Mussolini's approach to foreign policy as a whole; in particular his clash with Hitler during the Dolfuss crisis in 1934 and the reasons behind the decline of the Stresa Front. More information, too, on Il Duce's social policy would be helpeful. The 'Facist Dictatorship' section is a mess: it needs to be split up into sub-sections, seperating out domestic and foreign policy. His attitude to racial policy might also be of some use, in particular his early perceptions of National Socialism. I seem to remember him saying if Nazi logic on this question were followed the only 'pure' race in Europe would be the Laps. Why, moreover, is there not more on the meeting in July 1943 of the Fascist Grand Council, surely one of the great turning points in his career. Instead we get a wholly unecessary section on his Jewish mistress. Overall I find this whole article at best second rate and suffering from some serious political and conceptual distortions. <a href="../../../w/h/i/User%7EWhite_Guard_fe26.html" title="User:White Guard">White Guard</a> 05:50, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Consider the points I made above about the various absences and omissions in this article. The only proper criterion for inclusion in any biography is importance and relevance; otherwise the whole thing becomes hopelessly distorted. To have a whole section on one of Mussolini's mistresses and only a passing reference to the Grand Council of 1943 is <i>absurd</i>. There is a whole host of interesting-and relevant-information I could incorporate on Mussolini's foreign and domestic policy; but I am not now prepared to take the risk. It is quite obvious that-like so many others here-you have a quite extraordinary level of intellectual immaturity. I have certainly no intention of entering into any form of exchange with you on this or any other matter. <a href="../../../w/h/i/User%7EWhite_Guard_fe26.html" title="User:White Guard">White Guard</a> 00:05, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Every now and then one meets the absurd type of person who, instead of writing down more information on other topics, decides to delete a whole section of perfectly valid things "to ballance things out".

<p>This article is in desperate need of treatment, as I have indicated above. Much needs to be pruned, and much needs to be added. However, no sooner had a started the preliminary work, than my editing was subject to what I would describe as a form of counter-attack, the first initially without any explanation whatsoever. I have been accused of having 'an agenda', whereas my only agenda, as a historian, is to serve the truth. But I do have a point of view, which I would never allow to 'pollute', if that is the right word, the pursuit of objectivity. However, for those who are interested, I will make my POV plain: I loath and despise Communism in all its forms. I have always found it richly ironic that Fascism has become a term of abuse, whereas Communism has not, as the contribution of Lenin, Stalin, Mao Zedong and Pol Pot to the sum total of human misery is at least as great as that of Hitler-if not greater, and considerably greater than that of Benito Mussolini, for all his many faults. I will make my point of view even plainer by saying I retain a residual sympathy for Mussolini, Fransisco Franco and Jose Antonio Primo de Rivera; I have none whatsoever for Hitler and I do not admire Fascism as a doctrine in the abstract, so to speak. My political inclinations are right wing, but of a conservative variety. I would not, under any circumstances, allow my POV to influence, in any direct sense, my historical work, and I have published on Mussolini, as well as other historical figures in academic journals without adverse comment.</p>
<p>However, this is all getting away from the point. I indicated above that this present page is a <i>very</i> poor contribution to the life of Mussolini. Here are the main points again;</p>
<p>1. There is far too much on Fascist atrocities in East Africa, which simply do not belong on this page.</p>
<p>2. There needs to be a clear separation between domestic and foreign policy.</p>
<p>3. Above all, what is needed is a clear account of the shifts in Italian foreign policy between the two Austrian crises, that of 1934 and that of 1938. We have to understand why, in other words, Mussolini moved from a deep distrust-and open contempt-of Hitler towards an alliance whch was against his own best interests and those of Italy. If you want to understand his original view of Hitler you could do no better than read his contributions to <i>Il Popolo d'Italia</i> in August and September 1934.</p>
<p>4. There is so much that could be said about his domestic policy, which does not appear here.</p>
<p>5. The evolutions in his social policy, with particular reference to the Jewish question, needs to receive a far better handling.</p>
<p>6. Ask most people what the great turning point in Mussolini's personal career was and I imagine the Grand Council meeting of July 1943 would figure very highly. Here it receives a mention in passing. Instead what do we get?: a whole section of tittle-tattle on one of his mistresses-not, incidentally, the most significant.</p>
<p>Overall there is imbalance and inaccuracy, and for these reasons I put on a NPOV tag, which, as a newcomer, I thought the most appropriate. Since my work is to be received with hostility and suspicion-even by someone with administrative powers-I then put on a subsquent tag calling for expert intervention. Both were removed. I do not now know what the way forward is to be. <a href="../../../w/h/i/User%7EWhite_Guard_fe26.html" title="User:White Guard">White Guard</a> 08:26, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

I urge White Guard to make bolder moves towards what he considers as an improvement. Editing is much better than criticizing and putting tags around, even if much more difficult. On the contrary, talking here is OK. --<a href="../../../m/a/u/User%7EMauroVan_d285.html" title="User:MauroVan">MauroVan</a> 09:41, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>He was heavily involved with her to the the extent that she dictated his foreign policy until 1935 (Richard Washburn Child). I think that's pretty significant.

<p>I have changed the date to 7 April 1926 as that seems the most likely.</p>
<p><br />
I didnt add this to the main article because I can not remember the episode but there was an X-files episode in the fifth or sixth season where there was a woman who was a genie or something that could grant people wishes but they would always backfire if they were selfish. At some point mulder finds a stack of photos with her alongside past victims, one of which is Mussolini. Its a hoot but not a particularly profound reference. The cultural section seems a little thin for a dictator made fun of in so many circles.</p>
<p>There was a character on the BBC comedy program "the Young Ones" who bore a profound resemblence to Mussolini</p>

<dd>False dilemma. Here's the real issue: They were both dictators or the concept has no meaning and should be</dd>

<p>completely abandoned. It does have a meaning which is determined by its use (obviously) and it will NOT be completely abandoned. Two errors are worse than one. The fact that some ideologiaclly motivated radicals control the page on Jospeh Stalin and prevent a perfectly accurate term from being used does not logically (or morally or epistemolgoically) justify not using the accurate term to describe Mussolini. Stalin was a dictator (witness purges, cult of personality, paranoia and annihilation of even closest advisors arbitrarily). So was Mussolini. So was Saddam Hussein. So was Pinochet. It's obvious. So was Pol Pot. So was Mao. So is Castro. What's the problem? POV-pushing results when people try to <i>mitigate</i>, <i>revise</i>, or otherwise play semantic games to try to reverse the common historical judgement. BTW, this is extremely common in Wikipedia for obvious reasons. But allowing it, because of tyrnnay of the majorty, for one article, does not jutify allowing it for others. --<a href="../../../l/a/c/User%7ELacatosias_a9d0.html" title="User:Lacatosias">Francesco Franco aka Lacatosias</a> 09:47, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Straw man. I don't hold any such view. My point above was obviously that Pinochet, for example, may be not quote fit into the category of dictator. I may even be willing to grant that much.... But that doesn't take anything away from my fundamental argument. There ARE dictators. And many people on Wikipedia don't want to accept the existence of that fact at all when it comes to their particular <i>side</i> of the idelogical divide. That is all that is really going on when people refuse to acknowledge such obvious cases as Mussolini, Hitler, Stalin, etc.. But this semantic BS is discussed all the time here. Use what you like. It will almost certainly be changed by the next crop of editors that comes along in a few months and decides that "autocrat" is too POV or something. <i>Words, in themsleves, can have no POV. Only speakers communicative intentions can have a bias in a context of utterance. If I pronounce the morpheme "socialism" with a certain tone of voice in the midst of a group of US conservative, they will take it as an insult (or as something neagtive in any case. If I say the word "socialismo" with a slightly different tone of voice in the midst of a group of Italian left-wingers, they will take it as a compliment (or respond with some other positive reaction).</i> Either Mussolini was the prototypcal dictator or the word has no meaning at all. If I say "dictator" what pops into most people's minds is almost certainly "the little German fellow with the weird moustache" and "the fat, bald guy who ruled Italy with an iron hand", "the Russian guy with the big moustache" and so on. Thus would have to be verified exprimentally, but I have a string suspicion that it would turn out approximately true. So the word obviously has meaning, and, in fact, Mussolini is part of the meaning of the word itself. --<a href="../../../l/a/c/User%7ELacatosias_a9d0.html" title="User:Lacatosias">Francesco Franco aka Lacatosias</a> 09:30, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Another bizarre coincidence. This story pops up today in the New York Times about Pinochet heart attack. I'm experiencing so many of these coincidence in the last months that, if I weren't such a dogged atheist, I would think I have special powers. But there can be no such nonsense, since I can predict nothing and hence make no money or otherwise take advantage of such abilities. Just contant coindences (sometimes quite frighthening actually) which sometimes drive me to the point of near-lunacy, since there is no rational explantion, no point or meaning to them that I can see, and nothing I can do about them.

<p>The introductory paragraph states that Mussolini was "captured and hung near Lake Como by Communist Resistance units". This is not so. He was captured and shot. His body was subsequently brought to Milan where, together with that of his lover, Clara Petacci, it was hung upside-down. However, I saw no possibility of editing this slight error, and it would be good if someone in the know could take care of it. --Jimbolone 15:00, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree with you about the Denis Mack Smith biography. I ended it realizing that I had <i>less</i> grasp on what Italian Fascism was as a coherent ideology than I had previously imagined. A sign of a good book! Nonetheless I don’t quite see why A Mussolini would want to have anything to do with a party which which was not in some clear sense a successor party to that of her illustrious namesake. She has hardly done a lot to distance herself from him! Essentially, once the Blair-mirror-image moderniser Gianfranco Fini had re-positioned the MSI as merely post-Fascist she was obliged to split. Certainly fascist parties are outlawed in Italy, just as fraud is legally discouraged in the UK. I suppose we could call it a follower of the pre-post-fascist tendancy. But simply neo-fascist does seem simpler. —<a href="../../../i/a/n/User%7EIan_Spackman_9ce0.html" title="User:Ian Spackman">Ian Spackman</a> 03:13, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The King of Italy Victor Emmanuel III appointed Mussolini in an attempt to prevent a communist revolution in Italy. He did not appoint himself, thats fasle information.</p>
<p>On October 29, 1922, King Vittorio Emmanuele III (1869-1947) phoned Mussolini to come to Rome and form a government. <a href="http://www.comandosupremo.com/Mussolini.html" class="external free" title="http://www.comandosupremo.com/Mussolini.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.comandosupremo.com/Mussolini.html</a></p>
<p>Mussolini was in no way relate to Hitler or was not influence by him, this information on his bio is fasle, its the other way around. The hand gesutre was Mussolini idea, Hitler copy him. Arm cloths was Mussolini idea, Hitler copy him. ---- I am right here</p>
<p>Adolf Hitler had been inspired by Mussolini's achievements and once he gained power in Germany he sought a close relationship with Italy. In October 1936 the two men signed a non-military alliance. ---- I am right <a href="http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/2WWmussolini.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/2WWmussolini.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/2WWmussolini.htm</a></p>
<p>Mussolini did not escape to German controlled Austria, fasle information.</p>
<p>The truth was Benito Mussolini was helping the poor people in the South of Italy, he was going set up business there, which they had a big disgreement. The Italian partisans arrested Mussolini and Clara Petacci, and both were killed.</p>
<p>On April 28, 1945, Mussolini and his mistress Clara Petacci, were arrested again by Italian partisans by Lake Como. <a href="http://www.comandosupremo.com/Mussolini.html" class="external free" title="http://www.comandosupremo.com/Mussolini.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.comandosupremo.com/Mussolini.html</a></p>

<p>In recent interview with young Italian, they stated he was the greatest Prime Minister of all time.</p>
<p>I listen to my mother, father, uncle, anunt who know him in person. You can write a million books on Benito Mussolini. Authors have not spoken to him or interview him, they have no fact and no proof, just gossip.</p>

<p>They did a inteview with young people and they stated Benito Mussolini was the greatest Prime Minister in 2007. RAI International has did a bigraphy on Benito Mussolini, which is 100% spot on in information in 2007.</p>
