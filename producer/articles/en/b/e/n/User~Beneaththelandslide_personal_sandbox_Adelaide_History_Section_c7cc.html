<p>Prior to European settlement, the Adelaide area was inhabited by the <a href="../../../k/a/u/Kaurna.html" title="Kaurna">Kaurna</a> Aboriginal tribe. Their name for the area known as Adelaide was <i>Tarnda(r)nya</i>, deriving supposedly from the Kaurna word <i>tarnda</i>, which means <i>Red Kangaroo</i>. Adelaide is still unofficially referred to by some, by this name. The Kaurna people were stone-age hunter gatherers who inhabited the Adelaide Plains and surrounding regions - from <a href="../../../c/a/p/Cape_Jervis_3d9e.html" title="Cape Jervis">Cape Jervis</a> in the south, and to <a href="../../../p/o/r/Port_Wakefield%2C_South_Australia_232e.html" title="Port Wakefield, South Australia">Port Wakefield</a> in the north. Among their unique customs were burn-offs (controlled <a href="../../../b/u/s/Bushfires.html" title="Bushfires">bushfires</a>) in the Adelaide Hills which the early Europeans spotted before the Kaurna people were pushed out by settlement. By 1852, the total population (by census count) of the Kaurna was 650 in the Adelaide region and steadily decreasing. During the winter months, they moved into the <a href="../../../a/d/e/Adelaide_hills.html" title="Adelaide hills">Adelaide hills</a> for better shelter and firewood. <span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_cathuni"><sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../b/e/n/User%7EBeneaththelandslide_personal_sandbox_Adelaide_History_Section_c7cc.html#endnote_cathuni" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../b/e/n/User%7EBeneaththelandslide_personal_sandbox_Adelaide_History_Section_c7cc.html#endnote_cathuni" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></sup></span> <span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_placenames"><sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../b/e/n/User%7EBeneaththelandslide_personal_sandbox_Adelaide_History_Section_c7cc.html#endnote_placenames" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../b/e/n/User%7EBeneaththelandslide_personal_sandbox_Adelaide_History_Section_c7cc.html#endnote_placenames" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></sup></span></p>

<p>Adelaide's early history was wrought by economic uncertainty and incompetent leadership. The first governor of South Australia, <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Hindmarsh_3cc0.html" title="John Hindmarsh">Hindmarsh</a>, clashed frequently with Col Light. The rural area surrounding Adelaide city was surveyed by light in preperation to sell, a total of over 405 km² of land. Adelaide's early economy started to get on its feet in 1838 with the arrival of livestock from <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_South_Wales_238d.html" title="New South Wales">New South Wales</a> and <a href="../../../t/a/s/Tasmania.html" title="Tasmania">Tasmania</a>. The wool industry served as a early basis for the South Australian economy. Light's survey was completed in this period, and land was promptly offered to sale to early colonists. Wheat farms ranged from <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encounter_Bay_edda.html" title="Encounter Bay">Encounter Bay</a> in the south to <a href="../../../c/l/a/Clare%2C_South_Australia_4b7b.html" title="Clare, South Australia">Clare</a> in the north by 1860. <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Gawler_1b25.html" title="George Gawler">Governor Gawler</a> took over from Hindmarsh in late 1838 and promptly oversaw construction of a governor's house, jail, police barracks, hospital, and customs house and a wharf at <a href="../../../p/o/r/Port_Adelaide_285a.html" title="Port Adelaide">Port Adelaide</a>. In addition houses for public officials and missionaries, and outstations for police and surveyors were also constructed during Gawler's governorship. Adelaide had also become economically self-sufficent during this period but at heavy cost: the colony was heavily in <a href="../../../d/e/b/Debt.html" title="Debt">debt</a> and relied on bail-outs from London to stay afloat. Gawler was recalled and replaced by <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Edward_Grey_0db0.html" title="George Edward Grey">Governor Grey</a> in 1841. Grey slashed public expenditure against heavy opposition, yet it's impact was neglible at this point: Silver was discovered in <a href="../../../g/l/e/Glen_Osmond%2C_South_Australia_881d.html" title="Glen Osmond, South Australia">Glen Osmond</a> that year, agricultural industries were well underway and other mines sprung up all over the state, aiding Adelaide's commercial development. The city exported meat, wool, wine, fruit and wheat by the time Grey left in 1845, contrasting with a low point in 1842 when one-third of Adelaide houses were abandoned.</p>

Adelaide saw South Australia became a <a href="../../../s/e/l/Self-governing_colony.html" title="Self-governing colony">Self-governing colony</a> in 1856 with the <a href="../../../r/a/t/Ratification.html" title="Ratification">ratification</a> of a new <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constitution.html" title="Constitution">constitution</a> by the British parliament. <a href="../../../s/e/c/Secret_ballot.html" title="Secret ballot">Secret ballots</a> were introduced, and a <a href="../../../b/i/c/Bicameralism.html" title="Bicameralism">bicameral</a> parliament was elected on 9 march 1857, by which time 109,917 people lived in the province. In 1860 the Thorndon Park reservoir was opened, finally providing an alternative water source to the <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turbidity.html" title="Turbidity">turbid</a> River Torrens. In 1867 gas <a href="../../../s/t/r/Street_light.html" title="Street light">street lighting</a> was implemented, the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Adelaide_ca80.html" title="University of Adelaide">University of Adelaide</a> was founded in 1874, the <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Australian_Art_Gallery_df41.html" title="South Australian Art Gallery">South Australian Art Gallery</a> opened in 1881 and the <a href="../../../h/a/p/Happy_Valley_Reservoir_ebdd.html" title="Happy Valley Reservoir">Happy Valley Reservoir</a> opened in 1896.

<p>Electric street lighting was introduced in 1900 and electric <a href="../../../t/r/a/Tram.html" title="Tram">trams</a> were transporting passengers in 1909. 28,000 men were sent to fight in <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_I_9429.html" title="World War I">World War I</a>. Adelaide enjoyed a post-war boom but with the return of droughts, entered the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Depression_3776.html" title="Great Depression">depression</a> of the 1930's, later returning to prosperity with strong government leadership. <a href="../../../s/e/c/Secondary_sector_of_industry.html" title="Secondary sector of industry">Secondary industries</a> helped reduce the state's dependence on <a href="../../../p/r/i/Primary_sector_of_industry.html" title="Primary sector of industry">primary industries</a>. The 1933 census recorded the state population at 580,949 which was less of an increase than other states due to the state's economic limitations. <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a> brought industrial stimulus and diversification to Adelaide under the <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Playford_IV_5367.html" title="Thomas Playford IV">Playford</a> Government, which advocated Adelaide as a safe place for manufacturing due to its less vulrenable location. 70,000 men and women enlisted and shipbuilding was expanded at the nearby port of <a href="../../../w/h/y/Whyalla%2C_South_Australia_c008.html" title="Whyalla, South Australia">Whyalla</a>.</p>
<p>The South Australian Government in this period built on former wartime manufacturing industries. International manufacturers like General Motors <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holden.html" title="Holden">Holden</a> and Chrysler make use of these factories around Adelaide completing it's transformation from an agricultural service centre to a twentieth century city. A pipeline from <a href="../../../m/a/n/Mannum%2C_South_Australia_7820.html" title="Mannum, South Australia">Mannum</a> brought <a href="../../../r/i/v/River_Murray_26c3.html" title="River Murray">River Murray</a> water to Adelaide in 1954 and an <a href="../../../a/i/r/Airport.html" title="Airport">airport</a> opened at <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Beach%2C_South_Australia_fe48.html" title="West Beach, South Australia">West Beach</a> in 1955. An assisted migration scheme brought 215,000 emigrants of all nationalities to South Australia between 1947 and 1973. The Dunstan Government in the 1970's saw something of an Adelaide 'cultural revival' - establishing a wide array of social reforms and overseeing the city becoming a center of the arts. Adelaide hosted the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Grand_Prix_e5ce.html" title="Australian Grand Prix">Australian Grand Prix</a> between 1985 and 1996 on a street circuit in the city's east parklands, before losing it in a controversial move to <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melbourne.html" title="Melbourne">Melbourne</a>. The 1992 <a href="../../../s/t/a/State_Bank_of_South_Australia_5fcb.html" title="State Bank of South Australia">State Bank</a> collapse plunged both Adelaide and South Australia into economic recession, and it's effects can still be felt today.
