<p>the exact reference was not at the bottom of the page at the time, nor did the anon actually refer to any reference. as such, it would not be prudent to just leave an unreferenced change to statistics like that. However unreliable this type of encyclopaedia is, it can be made more reliable by referencing edits which change details. <a href="../../../x/t/r/User%7EXtra_5b60.html" title="User:Xtra">Xtra</a> 09:49, 24 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>So you like the more precise reference? I'm glad. It really didn't take long to find. But I was a little unsure of the convention - to be as specific as possible, or to link to the publication and let the reader find their own way from there.

<p>I see no problem at the moment. but the shoot to kill provisions only apply where it is to prevent serious injury or death to someone else. I think that needs to be made clear as someone who doesnt know the provissions may think it allows shoot first in any circumstance, which it does not. <a href="../../../x/t/r/User%7EXtra_5b60.html" title="User:Xtra">Xtra</a> 03:41, 25 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>My alternative</p>
<p>" One particular clause has drawn the ire of the state premiers, the so called Shoot to kill clause. Based on a similar provision in existing legislation, the clause treats people wanted under detention orders in the same way that current law treats wanted suspects and allows police to shoot where they believe there is a threat to life.

<p>I noticed your David Hicks edit got reversed. I agree the whole "has not expressed regret for his actions" thing sounds POV. I mean how would we know if he's expressed regret for his actions?

<p>But there would be no terrorists in Iraq had not been because of the US-led war. The insurgents entered Iraq to fight the invasion.

<p>Hi Copperchair,</p>
<p>I'm still curious to know how you define "terror".</p>
<p>I confess, I'm hard put to pick an exact definition myself, though I think that unexpected running and screaming should figure somewhere.</p>

<p>Yeah. I thought <a href="../../../i/l/a/User%7EIlayathalapathyvijay_6afb.html" title="User:Ilayathalapathyvijay">user:Ilayathalapathyvijay</a> was creating a new article with a completely random title because it wasn't the first one (eg becoming a star), though you caught it before I did. I've warned them, but the edits seem to have already stopped. I don't think it qualifies for administrator intervention/vandalism in progress unless they do something after being warned, if it does, it'll have to wait until you're back. Then again, apparantly they're an alt of user:Actor Vijay who has the same talk page and created becoming a star previously (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Undelete/Becoming_a_star" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Undelete/Becoming_a_star" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>), so if that's grounds for reporting them, let me know for next time. <a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndium_9d5c.html" title="User:Indium">Indium</a> 09:43, 7 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hmm. I just noticed that the alt user:Actor Vijay was suspended for doing that, so I reported Ilayathalapathyvijay anyway.

<dd>In fairness, the page he overwrote could easily be a candidate for deletion, and he's not actively making people miserable the way some POV warriors do. But, having been suspended once, there's almost certainly grounds for a repeat punishment. I've db-bio'd Vijay (Actor).

<p>I suggest you look at this: Notability It is tempting for some people to set a bar of notability for schools, such as by age, size or press coverage. However, any such criteria have proven to be controversial. Thus, the only fitting criterion is how much verifiable, NPOV information can be found on the school.</p>
<p>Thankyou, I would ask you to keep personal attacks out of Wikipedia, we both know that there is no room for that on this site.</p>

<p>I know I shouldn't feed the trolls, and normally I do refrain from giving trolls the literary trouncing that they deserve and seek, yet don't listen to, and some seem capable of even understanding simple wiki-concepts. You're right of course, they (and in particular Ben, this one, not you, you couldn't possibly ever be confused...) should not be fed.

<p>I know that it's been closed as no consensus now, but I don't see the problem with it being kept. You could look at it the other way and say that: "Oh, look, now that we've deleted List of results of the England rugby league team, there is a precedent for deleting <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Scotland_national_football_team_results_8437.html" title="List of Scotland national football team results">List of Scotland national football team results</a>" which would, IMO, be a complete travesty. To the point - I can certainly see that the list of rugby league results would certainly be useful to some people (to answer questions like "When did England last beat France?", "What was England's longest run of victories?") - and if a list is verifiable, NPOV and useful, then I certainly don't see why it shouldn't be included in Wikipedia.

I agree that piling on about error isn't effective it happens once, but since this is the third time in a couple weeks I feel that Ed needs to know that his actions are not appropriate. Unfortunately, telling someone you feel their actions are wrong are pretty much the only recourse on Wikipedia. I agree that it may not help resolving the issue, as Ed has continued to block in this manner despite others' protests. Do you have a better suggestion? I had hoped that this wouldn't go to RfC, as I'm sure being the subject of an RfC would be unpleasant, but it looks like that might be what happens. If you have any other ideas, I'd be glad to hear them—I'm still hoping the situation can be salvaged. — <a href="../../../k/n/o/User%7EKnowledge_Seeker_08dc.html" title="User:Knowledge Seeker">Knowledge Seeker</a> <a href="../../../k/n/o/User_talk%7EKnowledge_Seeker_711b.html" title="User talk:Knowledge Seeker">দ</a> 23:12, 29 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I assume you saw that the third was <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaschroeder_9392.html" title="User:Joshuaschroeder">User:Joshuaschroeder</a>; he said that in response to Ed's "bullying", he was leaving the project and asked his name to be changed to <a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7EScienceApologist_b6a9.html" title="User:ScienceApologist">User:ScienceApologist</a>. I don't understand what you mean by thicker skins. Are you suggesting that those who feel they are blocked unfairly should not complain? Or that other users should not protest but should just tolerate what they see as abuse? Incidentally, Ed has indicated that he is open to suggestions and willing to modify his behavior, so hopefully we can resolve the situation and prevent matters from approaching such a breaking point again. — <a href="../../../k/n/o/User%7EKnowledge_Seeker_08dc.html" title="User:Knowledge Seeker">Knowledge Seeker</a> <a href="../../../k/n/o/User_talk%7EKnowledge_Seeker_711b.html" title="User talk:Knowledge Seeker">দ</a> 05:04, 30 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yup, I have now seen that. I haven't looked into the details of it, so I can't make an informed comment on it. I was mainly thinking of Ed and Dunc. How to put this?

<p>You write: "In short, unless we can find something more, I don't see anything significant to say."</p>

<p>I really do want some reasonable action - and for that - everything needs to be taken into account. Chronological order is neutral - it focuses on no particular incident, out of many (I question why the 5000 mob should be first up, when the retaliatory violence was far more severe). I'd keep it that way.

<p>[Moved from FM's talk page] It's trolling if the main reason he's doing it is to get a reaction. As far as I can tell, what he most wants to do is make some changes to the article. He's frustrated and doesn't know what to do because he doesn't understand why you keep rejecting his changes, and he's become convinced that you're collectively out to get him. Maybe he is trolling. But only he knows that for sure. I don't. You don't. Neither does FM. If he is trolling, 'warning' him isn't going to make him stop. And if he isn't trolling, then accusing him of trolling isn't likely to get the reaction you want either, unless the desired reaction is an explosion.

<dd>It's nice of you to make excuses for such a foul-mouthed person (it's really fun to work with someone who calls you a "shit" and a liar, and lots that's much worse), but if Ben were actually doing what you claim he was doing, why would be use dishonest edit summaries and revert war? As far as desired reactions go - I would much rather never have to edit the same page as someone who acts as disgustingly as Ben does - I feel soiled just editing the same page as him. He's there to make trouble, to launch personal attacks, to insult me and Slim and Jim and everyone else who doesn't share his narrow religious beliefs. It doesn't take a mind-reader to see through that sort of behaviour and call it what it is. Trolling is too kind a term - most trolls don't behave as badly as Ben does. <a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuettarda_9de6.html" title="User:Guettarda">Guettarda</a> 08:47, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There's a difference between an explaination and an excuse. My point is that it doesn't matter if he is a good person or a bad person, you will get a better response if you treat him with respect. Certainly, be firm, but do so without personal attacks. I suggest this to you not because it will make him happier (though it would) but because I believe it would make you happier. ICBW.

<p>In answer to your question, I think it is inappropriate for you to continue questioning Kelly over a Simpsons quote in the way you have. You asked her a question, if she wants to answer it, she will; if she doesn't want to, she doesn't have to. Just leave her alone.</p>
<p>Am I to take it from the topics on this page that you are an Australian? If so, I find that very disappointing. I like to think that most Australians believe in giving people a fair go, regardless of whether we like or support them, and don't believe in putting the boot in when they're down.</p>
<p>I urge you to back off, leave Kelly alone and stop harassing her. Just give her some space. She's withdrawn from the elections, there's no need for people to keep hounding and interrogating her.</p>
<p>By boorishly and repeatedly demanding Kelly justify her use of a quote from a cartoon series, you're actually acting like the people Mr Burns is talking about in that quote. I'm surprised you can't see that for yourself. Sarah Ewart 03:51, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I wouldn't go so far as to describe it as "un-Australian behaviour" lol. Just disappointing. I had no problem with your asking Kelly about the quote or expressing your opinion about it. My problem was with your repeated demands that she answer you. She doesn't have to answer if she doesn't want to.</dd>
<dd>My basic opinion about the quote is that it's her userpage and if she wants to put it there, she should be allowed to. And no, I don't think she owes you or anyone else an apology. It's a bit of a stretch to conclude that it was somehow intended to be a slight directed at you. As I understand it, you were not eligible to vote, so you did not have any influence in "costing" her the election. Furthermore, you're not an anonymous voter. Neither were any of the people who voted. And I agree with what Mike said about it being intended as a joke.</dd>
<dd>She's not running for ArbCom anymore, it's time for everyone to stop interrogating her over every little thing and just get over it all.</dd>
<dd>By the way, when you were in primary school, did you ever learn the song about the Kelly Gang? "There's no crime too great or small, to blame Ned Kelly...Shame, shame upon the name, blame it all on the Kellys." Funnily enough, I'm starting to get the feeling that people have started seeing Kelly like that, and they think they can use any "crime," great or small, as an excuse to get stuck into her with the old jack-boot. Sarah Ewart 06:43, 12 January 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The problem I have is that I think the quote was an attack on wiki-democracy, for getting the 'wrong' result. I know I can't change that attitude by myself, but I would like to register a protest against her behaviour. It's then up to her to decide what to do about it. I appreciate you're trying to protect her, either from me, or from herself. But if I understand where she is comming from, the message she hears is not what you said, but "he's the one with a problem".

<dd>Okay, Ben, I think we're going to have to agree to disagree on the intention behind Kelly's decision to use the quote. I believe it was a joke, and maybe a little poke, but I have trouble believing it was an attack on specific people or on "<a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wiki-democracy</a>."</dd>
<dd>You say you just wanted to "register a protest against her behaviour." Okay, you did that with your first comment. There was no need to hassle her and repeatedly demand her response.</dd>
<dd>I can assure you that I was not attempting to defend Kelly. I don't even know the woman. I simply believe that it was wrong to hound and continue kicking her. That is all. Sarah Ewart 02:01, 14 January 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Hi. I don't think we do actually disagree about Kelly's intention. I agree it was a joke - many a true word is spoken in jest and all that. And also I agree it was not aimed at specific people, so much at the class of people who (she thinks) dislike her.</dd>
<dd>I suspect that she holds two contradictory views: emotionally she tends towards assuming that anyone who disagrees with her is doing so for invalid reasons; intellectually she knows this is sometime true and often false. I don't know if this is so or not, but I have met people who use this pattern, and I can see similarities both in her behaviour and in the reaction she receives from people.</dd>
<dd>Of course, where we differed was the question of what was to be done. I wanted her to face the issue and issue a response. I expect if she were to make a response then that response would be "OK, I accept that some of those who opposed me had legitimate reasons". Until she says something like that in public, I think that she will continue to act in ways that hurt other people and lead to her being hurt in response. And I don't like seing people do things that lead to them being hurt. So I think your original position of say nothing would have been wrong for me.</dd>
<dd>My suspicion, based on past experience, is that so long as other people are prepared to speak for her, she will not answer. Only when no one else defends her behaviour will she actually examine it. Of course, there <i>is</i> a large body of people prepared to defend her behaviour. So I have to agree with your latest message - repeating the question was pointless and even damaging because she has now seen her behaviour endorsed by so many people.</dd>
<dd>Thanks for the conversation. I appreciate it. Regards, <a href="../../../b/e/n/User_talk%7EBenAveling_584c.html" title="User talk:BenAveling">Ben Aveling</a> 12:06, 14 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sigh. I think we've annoyed him by 'correcting' his (I assume) signatures. But while there's no rule against editing from an IP and from a user, it's not kosher to cross-sign when nobody knows if the two accounts are the same person or not.

<dd>Changing another user's signed comments is generally a no-no. The section headings are generally fair game, particularly on one's own talk page. Being insulting is a personal attack wherever it happens, and in a section heading is just the same as being insulting in an edit summary - in fact worse, because the section heading is likely to get copied into other people's edit summaries. While "goes nuts" is a pretty weak insult, it hardly helps advance peace and understanding. <a href="http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?DefendEachOther" class="extiw" title="meatball:DefendEachOther">I'll change it back</a>, he might accept me as relatively neutral.</dd>

<p>Thank you for helping out.

<p>Adding the link twice is indeed a bit silly. I will take it out, has no added value at all.</p>
<p>As to the removal of McCarthyism from unlawful combatant, does this mean you do not agree the latter could also be described as a witchhunt? --<a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_Netherlands.svg_7dec.html" class="image" title="Holland"><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/2/20/Flag_of_the_Netherlands.svg/25px-Flag_of_the_Netherlands.svg.png" alt="Holland" width="25" height="17" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_Netherlands.svg_7dec.html" /></a> <a href="../../../n/e/s/User%7ENescio_e53e.html" title="User:Nescio">Nomen Nescio</a> 16:14, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>I can see a connection, but on balance, no. The characteristics of a witchhunt are (IMHO)
<ol>
<li>that the accused are considered guilty until proved repentant; there is no need to prove guilt, and no way to prove innocence</li>
<li>that the only way to prove repentance is to confess to things you didn't do and accuse other people close to you of sins at least as bad as your own, perpetuating the cycle.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>I'm assuming here that (most) 'unlawful' combatants are people I would consider to be prisioners of war. Regards, <a href="../../../b/e/n/User_talk%7EBenAveling_584c.html" title="User talk:BenAveling">Ben Aveling</a> 19:29, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>To that I agree. However, it is not the position of the Bush administration. They determine detainees to be enemy combatant (on what grounds exactly?) and as such, the administration claims, they can be <b>denied</b> POW status (the infamous memos refuting the Geneva Conventions). Clearly the position is that these people are not POW and therefore are not entitled the usual legal protection.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>As justification for their extrajudicial treatment the Bush administration has repeatedly stated these people were the "worst of the worst." This comes very close to being guilty untill proven innocent.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Furthermore, it has been shown people are held as enemy combatant but were arrested outside the battlefield and without them being engaged in combat, i.e. Padilla. Two major violations of international law. By definition these prisoners cannot be POW.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>As it turns out, many of these enemy combatants are either released without any indictment(!!), or are still (years) waiting for such a procedure. The latter another violation of US and international law.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I will leave it at that, but there is sufficient cause to conclude enemy combatants are not infrequently "bought" from Afghan troops, or apprehended based upon information gathered through torture (I know Bush says the US does not torture) and are not guaranteed legal protection as has been defined in US and international law. To me, this is very similar to a witchhunt.--<a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_Netherlands.svg_7dec.html" class="image" title="Holland"><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/2/20/Flag_of_the_Netherlands.svg/25px-Flag_of_the_Netherlands.svg.png" alt="Holland" width="25" height="17" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_Netherlands.svg_7dec.html" /></a> <a href="../../../n/e/s/User%7ENescio_e53e.html" title="User:Nescio">Nomen Nescio</a> 12:01, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There are some of the same 'parts'. I think they've been assembled into a different creature. A witch hunt is mostly an internal thing, and almost all 'combatants' are foreigners. In a witch hunt, anybody could be accused, and that doesn't seem to be the case here.

I assure you, I only intended to be polite. Rather than the delete/restore cycle, I was hoping that something a little less factually inaccurate might be more acceptable to all.

<dd>The "block" refered to the fact that you altered the page <i>after</i> Voice of All threatened to block anyone who perpetuated the edit war. Hence the link to the talk page. What you did wasn't blockable (nor was the rest, IMO) but it seemed rather bold to go forth and make the change so soon after the warning was issued.

<dd>I have to say that Nescio and others had understandable grounds on which to suspect you of sockpuppetry.

<dd>I don't know if you've noticed but when both VinnyCee's and Nescio's actions were investigated, it was VinnyCee who got blocked - twice, I think, the second time for a week. I advised both Vinny and Nescio to step back and calm down. Nescio took that on board, Vinny apparently did not. There is a long-established precedent for dealing with controversial content on Wikipedia: talk about it until consensus is reached, <i>then</i> change the article. Hacking at the article just results in silly edit wars and gets nowhere at all. Vinny was trying to add the USA to the list of modern police states, if memory serves, which is ludicrous by any rational definition of police state. There is no point even trying to do that, whereas expanding on the freedom issues resulting from the PATRIOT act is productive, since the terms in which this was stated a week or two back were far too accepting of an internal terrorist threat for which there is little credible evidence; Guantanamo Bay is also highly problematic for those of us brought up on the Geneva Convention and the concept of fair play. I've said all this before in various places, I think. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 18:44, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I am back now. The <a href="../../../p/o/l/Police_State_bc81.html" title="Police State">Police_State</a> article has been changed in the same manner that started this whole argument in the first place.

<dd>interesting, as I remember VinnyCree's contributions, he wanted to include the USA as police state and that, and nothing else, started the ludicrous debate.

<p>It is not a vote, it is a seeking for consensus; the admin is authorized to make judgement calls; but, in general, if the number of opinions stated in favor of any opinion is less than roughly 70% of the total of those who logged in, then the result should be recorded as no consensus. I have that correct, right?</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Adil_Said_Al_Haj_Obeid_Al_Busayss_d78d.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Adil Said Al Haj Obeid Al Busayss">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Adil Said Al Haj Obeid Al Busayss</a> we have seven opinions stated -- one from an IP user.</p>
<p>IP users don't count, correct?</p>
<p>3 delete votes, 2 keep votes, 1 merge. That would be exactly 50% offering an opinion choosing delete. So, in theory, <a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyan_Delaney_f359.html" title="User:Ryan Delaney">User:Ryan Delaney</a>, the admin who closed the discussion, should have had a good reason to not record the result as keep -- no consensus, correct?</p>
<p>Well, "mistakes happen" I think you said. And there has to be a "statute of limitations" on these things. And if we are going to keep our wikistress under control, we shouldn't sweat the small stuff.</p>

<p>Sir, 2nd Piston Honda not only impersonated me and deleted comments of mine <i>more than once</i> but if you check his edit summaries he also states that: "<i>none of your previous posts have been deleted, but thanks for the unnecessary update</i>" How can that possibly be considered 'Good Faith' under <i>any</i> circumstances&#160;? I will let it go (<i>once</i>) if <i>he</i> puts <i>all of my comments</i> back on that talk page; otherwise I will not let it go. I'm under the impression that I have to allow him a certain amount of time before I can take the next step in the process.

<dd>Yes, you're right, he shouldn't have removed those comments. At the same time, they should have been placed on his talk page, not on GWB's.</dd>
<dd>He claims to have (mis)copied a comment of yours. If that is the case, then I could still AGF. Either way, blocks are about preventing future misconduct, not about punishing past behaviour. He has admited he made a mistake. While he hasn't (in my opinion) really apologised for that, so long as he doesn't repeat the misconduct, there's no action to be taken against him.</dd>
<dd>I don't see anything in the deleted comments that talks about GWB, just about people's behaviour on the talk page.

<dd>I don't think the language was helpful, but I don't think it was especially bad. Yes, we've seen people react badly to being insulted, even indirectly. But we've also seen people being overly demanding of good behaviour in other people, and I think that's caused more problems. You've got to pick your battles in this life, and I'm not going to the barricades over something as small as that.

Re copy editing, what I did was shuffle some stuff around, try to improve what's there without adding or removing any content. As part of that I flagged one or two places where I felt more information is needed. It felt like a copyedit job at the time.

<dd>I don't think the language was helpful, but I don't think it was especially bad. Yes, we've seen people react badly to being insulted, even indirectly. But we've also seen people being overly demanding of good behaviour in other people, and I think that's caused more problems. You've got to pick your battles in this life, and I'm not going to the barricades over something as small as that.

<dd>Thanks for the message, I've put an explaination of my issues with the 'low sulphur' comment on <a href="../../../a/r/c/Talk%7EArch_Coal_ad36.html" title="Talk:Arch Coal">Talk:Arch Coal</a>. Re copy editing, what I did was shuffle some stuff around, try to improve what's there without adding or removing any content. As part of that I flagged one or two places where I felt more information is needed. It felt like a copyedit job at the time. Leaving aside whether or not you would have added the tag, what edit summary would you have prefered?

<p>Thanks for the tag, it was an interesting look. The article's only source are from the person who apparently coined the term. Since it's a self-published Tripod page, I deleted it as an unreliable source. Now as for the actual content of the article, it seems to present the view that pseudoterrorism is essentially being an undercover operator. So I added a merge tag to the page with undercover. Finally, since the article does not appear to have any valid references, and is basically a POV fork of undercover (since its not really neutral to call undercover agents "terrorists") I also prodded the page. If the prod is disputed, I'll list it at AFD.</p>

It is clearly a <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neologism.html" title="Neologism">Neologism</a>, but it does get just enough google hits that I wouldn't speedy delete it, and the concept of undercover counter terrorists is clearly a notable concept.

<p>Ben, thank you for your comments regarding Duke53 and his allegations of personal attacks. I agree that I have been harsh with him, but I certainly did not start out harshly with him. It was only after a multitude of interactions on several articles did I become harsh. He has an axe to grind and I think he abuses the placement of warnings on other editors' pages. I should not have said he was not intelligent, the rest of my comments I do not regard as a personal attack. I should have been more positive, but if you review the long edit history on <a href="../../../m/o/u/Mountain_Meadows_Massacre_79b8.html" title="Mountain Meadows Massacre">Mountain Meadows Massacre</a>, for example, you will see that he does not compromise his position on anything. It is very frustrating.</p>
<p>I would ask you to montior his edits and coach him. He does not take counsel easily, but someone has got to take him in hand so that he becomes an asset rather than a nusance. I have found that achieving a NPOV position is difficult for him. Thanks again and I will strive to be more positive, even though it is very difficult with this editor.

<p>Admins are definitely not infallible. However, they do deserve the benefit of the doubt and an ordinary user should never revert an admin if the admin is stating they are taking an action AS an admin (this has nothing to do with regular content editting). If the ordinary user feels the admin has made a mistake, they should discuss it with the admin first. If that fails to satisfy them, then they should file a complaint at <a href="../../../a/n/i/WP%7EANI_afbb.html" title="WP:ANI">WP:ANI</a> or some other appropriate venue.</p>
<p>I stand by my statement: "[One] should never, however, revert an action made by an admin if the admin has stated that are acting in their administrator capacity." <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohntex_d2fe.html" title="User:Johntex"><b>Johntex</b></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohntex_fdb3.html" title="User talk:Johntex">talk</a></sup> 03:31, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Also, I see Duke is trying to claim that I did not answer his question, but he is twisting the situation. Here is the chronology. Since it is still visible on his Talk page, I will not provide diffs, but I can do so if they are needed:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Initially, Duke did not ask me about my removal of the comment, he simply reverted me. I left him a message on his Talk page advising him not to do that. Here left a message <i>on his talk page'</i> (not on my talk page, which would ensure I saw the reply). Thhe question was "Why wouldn't you want the entire exchange documented?" If he wanted an immediate answer, he should have left a message on my page so that I would get a message indication.
<ol>
<li>Before I had a chance to answer that question, he asked a second question, again on his talk page. "Are you telling me that by reverting that I was breaking a Wikipedia rule? "</li>
<li>I answered the first quesiton by saying "As I said, if you want it for evidence, then you can use a diff - you don't need to revert the change." I felt this was a sufficient answer.</li>
<li>Duke apparently disagreed. He asked again here "Why wouldn't you want the entire exchange documented? Are you telling me that by reverting that I was breaking a Wikipedia rule?"</li>
<li>I answered again "I'm telling you just what I said "You should not revert that sort of edit. If you want a record of that comment for some reason - use a diff." You knew you were reverting an administrative action and you did it anyway. That wasn't a good thing to do."</li>
<li>He still didn't like that answer, he said "I consider you deleting his comment 'not a good thing' to do. I consider your commenting 'don't revert me like that' 'not a good thing to do'. You're right, I knew what I was doing; I also couldn't find a rule telling me that I couldn't do it. Now I'm asking an admin (you) to show me that rule."</li>
<li>I expanded on my answer "Clearly, policy encourages administrators to use discretion in defusing situations. Interfereing with an administrator is against policy. If you disagree with my actions, you should talk to me about your complaint rather than reverting. If discussion fails to satisfy your concern, then you can report me. You should never, however, revert an action made by an admin if the admin has stated that are acting in their administrator capacity."</li>
<li>Duke then replied "<i>If you disagree with my actions, you should talk to me about your complaint rather than reverting"</i>.. I believe that your idea of 'talking' is quite different than mine; I have asked you numerous questions to which you have never given a straight answer. Your idea of 'talking' is simply for me to 'listen' to you and not expect any answers; I don't feel that admins should act in that manner. You ignore my questions but continue to be evasive; why?" <b>This is a complete red herring</b>. He is twisting things around. I was referring to his initial decision to revert me, instead of talking about it. He <b>did not</b> discuss first. He reverted first. I began the converstaiton, not him. Also, by this time I have answered every question he has asked. I have not been evasive at all.</li>
<li>I explained this to him.</li>
<li>He replied "<b>Quote the rule to me.</b></li>
<li>I explained "I removed someone else's comments, not yours. You had no reason or right to restore them. You are being argumentative and you keep wanting to distract from the issue at hand, which is that you were wrong to remove my change. This conversation is not going anywhere so I'm taking a break from it. As I said, if you feel I've acted inappropriately, file a complaint. From my perspective, this converation is over. You may have the last word if you want. Just be aware that you have been warned and that if you do such a thing again, I will block you."</li>

<dd>Hi Johntex, thanks for putting in such a full summary of what happened. A couple of points in response I want to make. Firstly, <a href="../../../w/h/e/Wikipedia%7EWheel_war_ce1d.html" title="Wikipedia:Wheel war">Wikipedia:Wheel war</a> is a guideline, not policy, and it's mainly talking about real admin actions as "unblocking or reblocking a user; undeleting or redeleting; or unprotecting and reprotecting an article". I don't believe that just nominating the revertion of another users comments as an admin action makes it an admin action, especially if one is already 'involved' in the discussion. Reverting comments is something that all users can and should do, in certain circumstances. Further, wp:ww doesn't say "never revert", it says "talk first". Basically, it's 3RR for admins. It certainly does not give Admins more rights than other users to decide which comments on a talk page are permissable and which are not. You say that "Interfereing with an administrator is against policy". Which is true, to the extent that interfereing with any user is against policy. It's no more or less wrong to mess people around if one is an admin and the other isn't. Admins have extra tools, not extra rights. Duke was wrong to revert your change, but no more so than if you were not an admin.

<dd>Hi Duke, I'm sorry, but I'm not going to complain about his behaviour; the only issue I had with him we've discussed and we've reached agreement on. I think the some of the problems you've had in filling out forms may be because your expectations are quite high. Wikipedia is wonderful and getting better, but it isn't always everything we might like it to be. There are always going to be vague and messy areas, places where the rules don't quite say what to do, even places where the spirit of the rules and the letter of the rules contradict. There are going to be times when other people do slightly the wrong thing, and we have to decide if we live with it or if we spend our time trying to fix it. Sometimes people need us to explain things to them in detail, and sometimes people just tell us things and expect us to work out the detail for ourselves. It's a bit of balancing act, but with a bit of give and take, things generally come out OK.

<p>Hi Ben,</p>
<p>Sorry I haven't gotten back to you sooner, I live in Fort Erie, Ontario and keep an apartment in Buffalo, New York where I was born and raised. I 've spent the last 6 weeks in Buffalo and my internet connection is here in Canada. Like I said i was born and raised in Buffalo and I've read the local news paper every day since I was 15 years old. My father was also a bookmaker and professional gambler (more of a hustler, cards, pool, ponies, sports). He still goes to the occassional late night poker games with some of the "boys" in Buffalo and Cheektowaga. I was raised on the Westside of Buffalo, living on Fargo Ave., Rhode Island Ave., Abbotsford Place and now my apartments on Parkside Ave. by the zoo. The Westside of buffalo was predominately Italian from the early 1900's to the late 1960's, early 1970's and then became predominately Hispanic, I win both ways since my father was born in Italy and my mother in Puerto Rico. I'm researching as much as I can about the Buffalo Family. They had a great site a few years ago by supercrack, but it disappeared right away. I been inside La Nova Pizza a million times, it's a Buffalo landmark, not to mention a $25,000,000 a year business. Can you believe that shit and to be perfectly honest i think they have the second best pizza, with Mr. Pizza on Elmwood Ave. being #1. I did the write up on Joseph Todaro Sr., but I did it more for myself and I'm thimking about doing a buffalo Family page. I'm starting to get that Wikipedia wants short, sweet and to the point when you write so thats what I'll give' em from now on. Anyway take care and by the way, you must have checked the Alexbonaro page, if not it's got alot of good Family charts.</p>

<dd>Hi Joe, Do you still have copies of the pages from the Buffalo Family website? Is the other stuff you wrote about online somewhere, or do you know which editions of the paper contained the information? Basically, I think if we can find something that backs up the mafia connection, a lot of the rest of the details can be taken on trust. We just don't want him suing us because we said he has mafia links. &#160;:-) Regards, <a href="../../../b/e/n/User_talk%7EBenAveling_584c.html" title="User talk:BenAveling">Ben Aveling</a> 04:14, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>We'll get there. What usually happens is that we have to put something together in user-space, then move it later. I'll wait for Zoe's OK to suggest it to Little Joe, but I think that will work here. I don't think anyone is worried about the claim that Joe T is a gangster, so much as worried that Little Joe might put in something that he knows about that isn't documented elsewhere, eg, that Joe T did something that no-one else knows he did. So it's not enough to show he's a gangster, we need to support each and every claim. Which is a pain, but that's the way it is.

<p>I'm asking questions of candidates I'm thinking of voting for. Some I've made up my mind to vote 'yes', based on experience. (George, Flo). Some I've currently expecting to abstain, sometimes because I don't know them at all, sometimes because I expect a pile-on oppose. And some, I'm thinking about voting for, so I'm asking questions. I've read (confession: skimmed) what's already been asked and answered, so I sometimes adjusted on the fly, but the basic questions were</p>
<p>1. Which of the following roles should arbcom members fulfil: judge, jury, executioner, detective, lawyer, psychoanalyst, teacher, leader, parole board, parole officer, weighing machine, opinion poll, weathervane, policeman, keeper of the vision, guardian of the peace, visionary, psychic, nurse, other?</p>
<p>2. What would wikipedia lose if you were appointed to the ArbCom?</p>
<p>3. An individual question. Sometimes tailored to the candidate, sometimes just a random question.</p>
<p>The answer I would give to the first question are judge, jury and none of the others. And also, now that I think of it, asker of questions. What I want to know, and credit to anyone who visits here before answering, is to what extent they see the role of arbcom as weighing the evidence presented, which is my view, vs the more activist role some people seem to imagine.</p>
<p>The answer to the second question should be 'something significant', and preferably something wikipedia related. If you don't expect joining the arbcom doesn't reduce the time you spend on other aspects of wikipedia, then I want to know why.</p>
<p>I'm happy to discus any of the other questions I've asked. Sometimes I have an answer in mind, sometimes I don't. I just want to see how people respond.</p>

Geogre and Flo I've had interactions with before, and I've been impressed. The others on this list, I've seen around, and I liked their answers for different reasons.

There are others I'd be glad to see get up, but I think I'm going to limit myself to 5 yes votes, mainly because there are 5 places on offer.

<p>Hi there. I noticed that you added a few comments to other people's comments in the ArbCom elections. Well, I seem to remember a few, but can only now find one (would you be able to track down the other ones?). The general agreement seemed to be that comments on votes belonged on the talk page of the voting page, though your comments seemed to be of the "corrective" sort. The example I noticed was here:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../a/r/b/Wikipedia%7EArbitration_Committee_Elections_December_2006_Vote_Geogre_98ef.html" title="Wikipedia:Arbitration Committee Elections December 2006/Vote/Geogre">Wikipedia:Arbitration_Committee_Elections_December_2006/Vote/Geogre</a></li>
</ul>
<p>...where you commented on the first oppose vote, by Cyde. Looking at the history, Cyde removed the comment with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Arbitration_Committee_Elections_December_2006/Vote/Geogre&amp;diff=94285106&amp;oldid=94273008" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Arbitration_Committee_Elections_December_2006/Vote/Geogre&amp;diff=94285106&amp;oldid=94273008" rel="nofollow">this edit</a>, and placed it on the talk page with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Arbitration_Committee_Elections_December_2006/Vote/Geogre&amp;diff=94285168&amp;oldid=92861173" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Arbitration_Committee_Elections_December_2006/Vote/Geogre&amp;diff=94285168&amp;oldid=92861173" rel="nofollow">this edit</a>. I happen to agree with your pointing out that Cyde's comment was not a balanced presentation of what happened. Would you consider asking him to correct his comment himself? More generally, how do you think such matters should be handled in future. Also, if you do find any of the other comments you made and whether they were similarly moved, could you let me know?

<p>For one, there is a long-standing rule that anyone publishing IRC logs from any WMF channels without consent from all people involved will be banned from all WMF channels. I can give you my assurances that not all of the people involved have given their consent for logs to be republished.</p>
<p>Also, you seem to be under the misconception that #admins is public. It's not. It's private in all definitions of the word: limited access, disclaimers of privacy, prohibitions against breaching that privacy, etc. Legally, privacy is protected per telecommunications laws (which have since been found, by precedent, to apply to electronic communications as well). Some states are one-party states, meaning that one side can record a conversation unilaterally. Some states are two-party states, meaning that both parties have to agree before a conversation can be recorded. I can assure you that some of the participants in #admins live in two-party states. Additionally, even in one-party states, lurkers wouldn't be allowed to record the conversation anyway, because they're not a party at all. Giano has no right to be sending around other people's private communications, and neither does whoever this lurker was who gave him the logs.</p>
<p>As you can see, it's a mess, and the correct solution is to clean up whatever alleged abuse is taking place on WMF-sanctioned IRC channels. But making these channels public is a non-starter; first of all, that certainly can't be done retroactively, meaning that none of the logs in existence right now can be published. Also, making the channel public will destroy the use of it in the first place — dealing with issues that, for legal reasons, cannot be handled transparently. --<a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde"><font color="#FF66FF"><b>Cyde Weys</b></font></a> 07:28, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>We don't need the whole logs, just the contentious bits. And while there may be contractual issues between whoever leaked and the other members of the channel, that doesn't bind anyone not present at the time. That's the thing about secrets. If you don't keep them secret, they stop being secret.

<p>That is, <b>TWO ISLAMIC sheiks</b>, who represent Islam in Australia, teach that "uncovered meat" attracts "street cats" and that it is not up to the "street cat" to stop itself.</p>
<p>In that context, young Australian gilrs, some as young as 14, were raped by Islamic men who stated "you deserve it because you are an Australian"...</p>
<p>AND "you deserve [to be raped for 5 hours] because you are an Australian" is <b>EXTREMELY RACIST</b>!!</p>
<p>RACIST MIDDLE EASTERN ISLAMISTS, stated that to a young Australian Anglo girl, the Italians, the Vietnamese, the Indonesians etc have not raped an Australian girl because of a racial hatred for Australia.</p>
<p>IT is NOT racist to discuss that Islamic Middle Eastern men in Australia and Europe (Norway, France, Holland etc) attack and rape local girls because of a racial hatred.</p>
<p><br />
ALSO - the highest authority in the Islamic Egyptian ministry states that a Muslim may kill and take the money of a Christian and non-Muslim...</p>
<p>If the nazis had held Hitler to be a prophet of a religion does that mean that to hate nazism is racist because it is a religion, regardless of whether that religion is racist or not......???</p>

<p>Hi Ben. Thanks for your brief pointer/correction on the NLP article a few weeks back. I'm currently editing on the Computing journalism article <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Computer_and_video_game_journalism" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Computer_and_video_game_journalism" rel="nofollow">[15]</a> and there is the use of the "N" word there. I'm not sure which policy to refer to in this regard. I know Wikipedia says objectionable subjects should be covered but I am not sure exactly what to refer to regarding the use of possibly inflamatory words. Any suggestions? <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlanBarnet_91d4.html" title="User:AlanBarnet">AlanBarnet</a> 04:03, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Assuming the facts check out, there's possibly not much I'd suggest doing. But do we know why the article in question has that name? It might be worth discussing, maybe.

<p>Ben <s>Firstly: <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> does <i>not</i> link to the text you quote in AfD discussions. Where <i>should</i> I go to find that text (...Sportspeople/athletes/competitors who have played in a fully professional league, or a competition of equivalent standing in a non-league sport such as swimming...)&#160;?</s> (oops - found it I was looking for the formatting you used.) <s>Secondly:</s> How can you reasonably compare <i>pro-wrestlers</i> to the sports-people section? Pro-wrestlers are entertainers participating in a scripted performance. They aren't sportspeople competing to the best of their ability in a contest of skill. Compare them to the actors section, because that's what they are.<a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGarrieIrons_a500.html" title="User:GarrieIrons">Ga</a><a href="../../../g/a/r/User_talk%7EGarrieIrons_ba7c.html" title="User talk:GarrieIrons">rr</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_GarrieIrons_2eb8.html" title="Special:Contributions/GarrieIrons">ie</a> 23:30, 10 January 2007 (UTC) <span id="63293965208"></span></p>

<p>Not sure what I think of that, Ben. To my mind there's a displeasing lack of logic in "fixing" the permitted behaviour (the socking) while tacitly allowing the abusive behaviour (the stalking and harassment). After the user's egregious rudeness to myself I'm hardly the right person to make these distinctions, however, so I've asked somebody with more experience of puppeteering, <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackensen_13da.html" title="User:Mackensen">User:Mackensen</a> (a checkuser), to take a look at the case. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 07:55, 15 January 2007 (UTC).</p>

<p>I think it's a great thing you are doing, not because of any personal prejudices towards or against any user in particular, but because I think you are keeping a level head and objective stance despite the baying for blood all around. My key objection is that a (IMO less) disruptive user is being repeatedly blocked at the instigation of another (IMO more) disruptive user, who gets off scott free. But I think it'll be hard "rescuing" Guardian Tiger, given the built up animosity and his editing style, not to mention the relentless pursuit of User:Certified.Gangsta. --<a href="../../../s/u/m/User%7ESumple_b35a.html" title="User:Sumple">Sumple</a> (<a href="../../../s/u/m/User_talk%7ESumple_b763.html" title="User talk:Sumple">Talk</a>) 00:22, 21 January 2007 (UTC) <span id="63294980885"></span></p>

<p>Why are you getting involved in a discussion that has obviously either been resolved or has died a painful death? Did you just add anything that several others have not already said? Did you bother to read the entire discussion?
