<p>That's furigana. It's meant to show how the name is pronounced. That's a given for all names in Kanji (including Light Yagami of Death Note, since his name is written in kanji) <a href="../../../w/h/i/User%7EWhisperToMe_201b.html" title="User:WhisperToMe">WhisperToMe</a> 04:26, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>"Netto" is technically "Engrish" while "Net" (And I'm meaning the guy's name) is English. If the intended name is Net, the only way the Japanese can write his name is "Ne-tto".</p>
<p>"In the Japanese version, Netto's name is a pun on the word "net." Official sources [1] have sometimes referred to him as "Net," though the pun is more evident due to the phonetics of his name when written in Kanji and Hiragana, as well as nuances in pronunciation by the seiyÅ« involved."</p>
<p>I'm changing this to "Official Japanese sources state his name in roman characters as "Net Hikari"" - remember that "Net" and "Netto", whichever one is the intended name, would be pronounced the same. <a href="../../../w/h/i/User%7EWhisperToMe_201b.html" title="User:WhisperToMe">WhisperToMe</a> 04:28, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>1. Do not use "u" in place of "you" on Wikipedia.</p>
<p>2. "Urutapu" now sides with me.</p>

<p>I just noticed that you're another MegaMan NT/BN fan. Can you help me out with <a href="../../../m/e/g/MegaMan_Battle_Network_5_8265.html" title="MegaMan Battle Network 5">MegaMan Battle Network 5</a>? In particular, I'm looking for print references on its critical reception or any references on its creation, and I'm coming up with almost nothing. I could really use some help. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Blâck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 08:51, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I would love to help, but I don't believe I know of any print reference for its critical reception (since I only play the Japanese games), and anything that I do have regarding its creation is just drawings/schematics of the characters, places, etc. from several guidebooks that I own (which I assume is not what your looking for anyways). If you do need to find these images, however, the official Japanese sites for most of the games do have some of them on display. --<a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenten_dad8.html" title="User:Benten">Benten</a> 23:17, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>I don't suppose you can scrounge up Japanese reviews of it, at least? I know it got lukewarm reviews in English, but the series is usually better-recieved in Japan.</p>
<p>By the way, regarding MMBN/NT images, the sources you gave don't suffice. For source, we need both original publishing <i>and</i> where it was posted online. www.exehq.com isn't any better for www.atomic-fire.com for all of the character art; they obviously didn't originally publish these images, so we need to know who did and where. Likewise for the screencaps; it's all well and good that they can be found on this site or that site, but we need to know what episodes they're from.</p>
<p>Additionally, a number of these images do need to go. The galleries in <a href="../../../c/r/o/Cross_Fusion_11b8.html" title="Cross Fusion">Cross Fusion</a> and <a href="../../../s/o/u/Soul_Unison_3f7d.html" title="Soul Unison">Soul Unison</a> and such need to be reduced to a representative example, with the rest of the described fusions described in prose. This is per <a href="../../../f/u/c/WP%7EFUC_7b76.html" title="WP:FUC">WP:FUC</a>; we need to keep use of fair-use images to a minimum. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Blâck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 00:35, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Oh, okay I see then how there should be a minimum. Although I can't provide a good enough source on the net, the official art for most of the other images come from Japanese guidebooks, though that may mean next to nothing in this case. --<a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenten_dad8.html" title="User:Benten">Benten</a> 03:46, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Hrm. If you could peg it to a specific book, it wouldn't need to be a wikilink. Otherwise, I don't think we can use them.&#160;:/</p>
<p>Oh! That reminds me. The screenshots can be saved; they just need episode numbers or names rather than just the series. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Blâck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 04:10, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>As far as I can remember, the images correspond to the book of the game in which the character in question first appears (the pic of Regal would be in the <i>BN4</i> guide for example). The img of the main characters in the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_MegaMan_Battle_Network_characters_f131.html" title="List of MegaMan Battle Network characters">List of MegaMan Battle Network characters</a> can be found in multiple books, <i>Secret of Rockman EXE - Official Illustrated Guide</i> (ã­ãã¯ãã³ã¨ã°ã¼ã®ã²ã¿ã¤âãªãã£ã·ã£ã«è¨­å®ã¤ã©ã¹ãã¬ã¤ã) being the most recent release (I know this because I own a copy, and it is particularly good for documenting the various advertisements throughout the series, though I do not know exactly how I should reference it. Should I just leave the name of the book on the img's pg in this case?). For the screencaps, since most of them are going to end up being deleted anyways and won't have a purpose on those pgs anymore, I don't see a pt. in fitting each with an ep #. There are a few, however, that I'll add to, like the one of R-Laserman and Slur, since they have their own importances on their respective articles. --<a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenten_dad8.html" title="User:Benten">Benten</a> 04:25, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>I can't believe I forgot about this, but upon flipping through the book again, <i>every</i> official pic from each game is in the index of the guide. So I'll just source it in all the applicable imgs; I may not get them all though, as there are probably some obscure pgs I don't know about aside from the ones I frequent.

<li>It doesn't say the chips are based on DM because of the dual billing. I meant that it was the source for the names of the chips themselves. It is known that the two are based on DM because the Phoenix/Death Phoenix monsters originate from DM, and that around the same time, the series reciprocated by creating a card in their card game based on Bass (or Forte). I don't think I would be able to find a source for you on this point, however. I do not believe any of the guides specifically listed this info; it was really a matter of whether or not one could see the connection.

<p>There has to be something. I know that there were promotional cards for both films: e-Reader cards for MMBN5, and cards for Duel Masters.

<li>I was thinking about the size issue as well. Usually it is the DVD sections that get seperate pages. I will split it off and put a link in the article. As for the short sentence summaries, I think that'd be fine, as long as they concern plot, rather than the battles that take place in each episode. (The names should be the English-language version's as well; no need to mention the original names here, as the page would just get bigger). --<a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenten_dad8.html" title="User:Benten">Benten</a> 15:02, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I wonder if there's a way we could combine the DVD and episode pages together... I remember seeing something like this on the Fullmetal Alchemist pages (though it seems they've since reverted it... probably meaning it's not a good idea after all). But basically, they did the short episode summaries like I suggested, except they had the episodes grouped together by the DVDs with an image of the DVD on the side of the table containing the summaries. (If that doesn't make much sense, I can try to elaborate.) I think that'd be a good way to keep the DVDs and episodes unified... On another note, I'm not sure what you mean by <i>The names should be the English-language version's as well; no need to mention the original names here, as the page would just get bigger.</i> Elaborate please? -<a href="../../../c/r/i/User%7ECrimsonseiko_0a02.html" title="User:Crimsonseiko">Crimsonseiko</a> 15:13, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Well, for the DVDs, I was going by model lists for media and release information like those of <i>South Park</i> or <i>The Simpsons</i>; it's much more space-preserving. The DVD lists are either very compressed on the main episode article (and still have a seperate page), or completely separate. I do understand what you mean for the grouping of the DVDs with the corresponding episodes, but it's probably best to keep it in the aforementioned fashion. For <i>The names should be the English-language version's</i>, I meant that, when the summaries are written, they should employ the English version's name changes (ie. using "Lan Hikari" as opposed to "Hikari Netto," but with no mention of the original names at all). --<a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenten_dad8.html" title="User:Benten">Benten</a> 15:20, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>OK, that's fine. Question, though... when writing summaries for Stream and on, what names should be used for the new characters, like Nenji? Their English game names? (On a similar note, I suppose that means that characters like Asteroid Plantman and Asteroid Napalmman should be changed to Asteroid VineMan and Asteroid MoltanicMan?) -<a href="../../../c/r/i/User%7ECrimsonseiko_0a02.html" title="User:Crimsonseiko">Crimsonseiko</a> 15:24, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I would go with the English game names to be consistent with the <a href="../../../m/e/g/MegaMan_NT_Warrior_d42b.html" title="MegaMan NT Warrior">MegaMan NT Warrior</a> article.

<li>I'll get back to work on this later; gotta take my lunch break. However, I wanted to ask another question while I'm away. I know all of the EXE series's art directors, but I'm awful with Wiki-code. Do you know how to edit the code so we can place the art director's name in for the episode summaries list? Thanks! -<a href="../../../c/r/i/User%7ECrimsonseiko_0a02.html" title="User:Crimsonseiko">Crimsonseiko</a> 17:00, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The tables work from templates. The standard Japanese/English template for anime doesn't include art directors, so trying to add them would not work out. I had thought about this in regards to the <i>Ryusei</i> episode list (after it gets its English version), and I figured that we could just add up the number of episodes each director does on the whole and list it in the production section on the <i>Ryusei</i> page. Anyways, altering tables beyond the points already in the template isn't wise given this situation. --<a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenten_dad8.html" title="User:Benten">Benten</a> 17:05, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Instead of just adding up how many episodes each director does, why don't we list the episodes they did? Like, for <i>Ryusei</i>, say... "Adachi Shingo (episodes 11, 18, 23)." That way, readers can compare episodes' art styles together. On another note, where should we put this information for EXE? This series has a LOT more art directors than Ryusei. Would it go best in the individual summary pages for each series? -<a href="../../../c/r/i/User%7ECrimsonseiko_0a02.html" title="User:Crimsonseiko">Crimsonseiko</a> 18:07, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>The EXE summaries are done. I'll have to tackle Axess-Beast+ another day. Add/omit/revise anything you need to. On another note, how do you feel about a screenshot for each episode? Like this: <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Fullmetal_Alchemist_episodes_00b0.html" title="List of Fullmetal Alchemist episodes">List of Fullmetal Alchemist episodes</a>... -<a href="../../../c/r/i/User%7ECrimsonseiko_0a02.html" title="User:Crimsonseiko">Crimsonseiko</a> 20:08, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Hmm...For the <i>Ryusei</i> directors, I still think that a total # would be better than individual episodes (as it would become very much like a list by the time things are tallied up). I would just forget about the art directors for EXE (listing the individual episodes which they directed); it is a somewhat messy affair and may even be a little crufty. And for screenshots for each episodes, I would opt against it since screenshots for episode guides usually require lots of work on the fair use rationale of each image for the article to be considered above start rating. --<a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenten_dad8.html" title="User:Benten">Benten</a> 01:07, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Edit: Oh, forgot to mention: the summaries for <i>Beast</i> and <i>Beast+</i> can (probably should) be in a combined article, probably titled <i>List of MegaMan NT Warrior episodes (Beast and Beast+)</i>. --<a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenten_dad8.html" title="User:Benten">Benten</a> 01:47, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>The movie needs some kind of plot summary, but I'm having trouble deciding where to place it. There's not quite enough content in the movie for its own article (if we did that, it'd just be a big plot summary and useless trivia like Shun's background cameo)... What Sukecchi and I were considering is placing it on Stream's summary page. I think that's the best place for it, but what do you think? -<a href="../../../c/r/i/User%7ECrimsonseiko_0a02.html" title="User:Crimsonseiko">Crimsonseiko</a> 13:56, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Benten, What follows is the letter I sent to both Makimi and Ryulong:</p>
<p>Makemi, Thanks for getting back to me (and unblocking me). I'm relatively new to contributing to Wikipedia and the procedures around here are baffling to say the least. To answer your question...YES... this IS Davd Wills the voice actor. My ID and e-mail address is "ghostysshow" because, aside from my voice acting career, I also host a show on Sirius Satellite Radio on channel#32 Sirius Disorder and a Saturday night show on WFDU fm out of Teaneck, NJ under the on-air name of "Ghosty"...hence "Ghosty's Show"...get it? Here's what happened over the weekend. While trapped at the radio station as a result of the snowstorm, I began browsing around online. While I was aware of various forums and websites related to another TV show I work on, Viva Pinata, I decided to see if there was anything about Yu-Gi-Oh GX. Well, yes indeed there was, but on all of the aforementioned sites and forums I was not credited with playing Hassleberry. Now I'm not really one for self-promotion (especially true when GX is heading into season 3 and I've never bothered to look and see what's out there). Research into how and why this incorrect information has spread all over the internet led me to Wikipedia. I logged in and made the correct changes where applicable. Of course, my corrections were undone and the false information has once again reappeared. While not getting credit for the role of Hassleberry on Wikipedia will probably not be injurious to my career in the long run, I do take a certain amount of pride in my work and at the very least would appreciate having the correct information listed on both the Hassleberry and Yu-Gi-Oh GX pages. As a disc jockey, I've often used Wikipedia for show prep purposes but now after having been the subject of bad information, I'll refrain from taking Wikpedia's word as "gospel" (something I'm sure the other sites, forums and fan pages made the mistake of doing too).</p>
<p>I don't know what else you need from me (and is this OTRS?) but I hope I've made it clear who I am (although I'd hardly call myself "notable". LOL</p>
<p>If you have any questions feel free to contact me either via e-mail or phone which I can also give you.</p>

<p>Thru episode 29. From what I can gather... 27 is "Cygnus Corps," 28 is "Radio Wave Crisis," and 29 is "Miracle of Satellite." I'm pretty sure on those translations, but I'm not able to supply the Romaji, so I'll let you just do it all. -<a href="../../../c/r/i/User%7ECrimsonseiko_0a02.html" title="User:Crimsonseiko">Crimsonseiko</a> 02:16, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Benten, i have noticed your activity on some of the Yu-Gi-Oh! set articles. On the Power of the Duelist, Cyberdark Impact, Strike of Neos, and Force of the Breaker articles, I have noticed you have trimmed up the format that the set articles currently have. I have reverted your edits to this, because there is no trace of a discussion to do this to the articles. Not all the set articles have five notable cards that would fit. I would be glad to discuss this matter on my talk page or yours. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERed_Director_41c6.html" title="User:Red Director">Red Director</a> 20:38, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I changed the format because it's more encyclopedic to cover a selection of the set rather than just list every single card. With the newer format, the articles are also divided into sections that address the set's mechanics (etc.), as well as the release dates, chronology, and other details. For the notable cards, I think there are five notable cards that could fit per set (either because of them being used for publisizing the expansion, being the lead cards or demonstrations of new archetypes and mechanics, having an impact on professional play, etc.) I just haven't gotten around to every set as of yet to introduce the new format; up until now, I've only gone from <a href="../../../p/o/w/Power_of_the_Duelist_3b49.html" title="Power of the Duelist">Power of the Duelist</a> to <a href="../../../t/a/c/Tactical_Evolution_1b71.html" title="Tactical Evolution">Tactical Evolution</a>. --<a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenten_dad8.html" title="User:Benten">Benten</a> 23:11, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Benten, there is no problem with what your doing. I have thought it over and your idea seems good other than the 5 notable cards. There could be more or less in some sets. We could make a project on the Yu-Gi-Oh! Wikiproject to change the format of all the articles. Message back if you think this could work. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERed_Director_41c6.html" title="User:Red Director">Red Director</a> 20:00, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>I'm currently considering a joint page based on Duel Spirits and Duel Energy for GX, dealing with the spirits and the energy. However, currently I have not enough data for such a page, and thus will not create one at the time. As you have access to the Japanese episodes, is there further data in the Japanese version on the two subjects that could be put towards an encyclopedic, notable article? <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDrake_Clawfang_c8e4.html" title="User:Drake Clawfang">Drake Clawfang</a> 02:03, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I don't think they need a seperate article. Duel Spirits and Duel Energy are both pretty self-explainatory, and the latter is covered pretty thoroughly already on the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martin_Empire_d8e1.html" title="Martin Empire">Martin Empire</a> page (they are also addressed in numerous others). Creating a joint page would not be the best course; if needed, we could just expand on either of them on the existing pages. --<a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenten_dad8.html" title="User:Benten">Benten</a> 02:07, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
