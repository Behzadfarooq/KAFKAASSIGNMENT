<p>At 09:21 ET (13:21 <a href="../../../u/t/c/UTC_9234.html" title="UTC">UTC</a>), a little over half an hour after the first attack, <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transport_Canada_8929.html" title="Transport Canada">Transport Canada</a> activated its Situation Centre (SitCen), their operations center, in Ottawa, which quickly filled up with key Transport Canada personnel. In addition, several other critical organizations, including <a href="http://www.navcanada.ca" class="external text" title="http://www.navcanada.ca" rel="nofollow">NavCanada</a>, the Canadian air navigation agency, <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Defence_808a.html" title="National Defence">National Defence</a>, the <a href="../../../r/c/m/RCMP_2336.html" title="RCMP">RCMP</a>, <a href="../../../c/s/i/CSIS_1f34.html" title="CSIS">CSIS</a>, <a href="../../../c/i/t/Citizenship_and_Immigration_Canada_67d0.html" title="Citizenship and Immigration Canada">Citizenship and Immigration Canada</a> (CIC), and <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada_Customs_and_Revenue_Agency_a38d.html" title="Canada Customs and Revenue Agency">Canada Customs and Revenue Agency</a> (CCRA) assigned staff to the SitCen to lend support.</p>
<p>The SitCen staff established contact with other key members of the Canadian aviation community, including the Air Transport Association of Canada and local airport authorities, with American regulators – notably, the FAA, and international civil aviation authorities.</p>
<p>The operation officially began at 09:45 ET (13:45 <a href="../../../u/t/c/UTC_9234.html" title="UTC">UTC</a>), when the FAA closed down U.S. airspace as a result of the attacks. After learning that the FAA had closed down U.S. airspace, <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minister_of_Transport_%28Canada%29_7a93.html" title="Minister of Transport (Canada)">Transport Minister</a> <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Collenette_7305.html" title="David Collenette">David Collenette</a> gave orders that Canadian airports be open only for outgoing police, military, and humanitarian flights, and incoming U.S.-bound international flights. This was the first time Canada had to shut down its airspace.</p>
<p>About 500 flights were en route to the United States at the time of the attacks. Transport Canada instructed NavCanada to give permission for U.S.-bound international flights that were at least halfway towards their destination to land at the nearest Canadian airport, depending where they were coming from and how much fuel they had. Planes were entering Canadian airspace at a rate of one to two planes per minute.</p>
<p>SitCen staff were working on two things during the operation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Where to land the aircraft</li>
<li>How to screen, deplane, and clear tens of thousands of passengers through immigration and customs.</li>
</ul>
<p>The first airport to receive diverted flights was <a href="../../../c/f/b/CFB_Goose_Bay_c72e.html" title="CFB Goose Bay">CFB Goose Bay</a>, which received 7 aircraft; fourteen other airports from coast to coast would also receive the diverted flights.</p>

Halifax International Airport</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>NavCanada instructed flights coming from Europe to avoid the major airports in Central Canada as a security measure, because they were among the busiest airports in the country. Pilots were asked to avoid both <a href="../../../l/e/s/Lester_B._Pearson_International_Airport_0756.html" title="Lester B. Pearson International Airport">Lester B. Pearson International Airport</a> in Toronto and <a href="../../../d/o/r/Dorval_International_Airport_cd35.html" title="Dorval International Airport">Dorval International Airport</a> in Montreal, although they did take some diverted flights.</p>
<p><a href="../../../g/a/n/Gander_International_Airport_c818.html" title="Gander International Airport">Gander International Airport</a>, which was the first North American airport on the trans-Atlantic route, took in 39 wide-body aircraft, mostly heading for U.S. destinations. The total number of passengers and crew accommodated at Gander was about 6,600. The total population of <a href="../../../g/a/n/Gander%2C_Newfoundland_and_Labrador_5a5d.html" title="Gander, Newfoundland and Labrador">Gander</a> is less than 10,000 people, so needless to say, the effort in accommodating all of these unexpected guests was monumental.</p>
<p><a href="../../../h/a/l/Halifax_International_Airport_10d8.html" title="Halifax International Airport">Halifax International Airport</a> handled 44 flights in a similar manner. The <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_Forces_Air_Command_05cf.html" title="Canadian Forces Air Command">Canadian air force base</a> at CFB Goose Bay, as well as <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._John%27s%2C_Newfoundland_and_Labrador_2caf.html" title="St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador">St. John's International Airport</a>, <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greater_Moncton_International_Airport_010e.html" title="Greater Moncton International Airport">Greater Moncton International Airport</a>, and the <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stephenville%2C_Newfoundland_and_Labrador_96bd.html" title="Stephenville, Newfoundland and Labrador">Stephenville</a> airport handled the remainder of the trans-atlantic flights.</p>

<p>Most of the flights coming from Asia to destinations on the United States west coast and points beyond had no other choice but to land at <a href="../../../v/a/n/Vancouver_International_Airport_cfc9.html" title="Vancouver International Airport">Vancouver International Airport</a>, because it was the only major Canadian airport on the West coast capable of handling the large airplanes used for trans-Pacific flights.

<p>There were also several incidents in which the military escorted jets into Canadian airspace. <a href="../../../n/o/r/NORAD_7fc6.html" title="NORAD">NORAD</a> used U.S. and Canadian fighter jets to intercept and escort civilian passenger flights to <a href="../../../w/h/i/Whitehorse_International_Airport_3b88.html" title="Whitehorse International Airport">Whitehorse International Airport</a>.

Due to concerns about the plane being crashed into Anchorage, buildings in that city were evacuated, as well as several buildings in <a href="../../../w/h/i/Whitehorse%2C_Yukon_b5b1.html" title="Whitehorse, Yukon">Whitehorse</a> where the flight was diverted as a precaution. The incident turned out to be a misunderstanding caused by a malfunctioning <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transponder.html" title="Transponder">transponder</a>. The flight ended up running low on fuel and a public affairs official at the airport later said there was also a communication problem with the air crew. Witnesses said that when the plane landed, the RCMP ordered the crew out at gunpoint.</p>

Security is tight at Lester Pearson International Airport in Toronto following the attacks</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Before the planes landed, most of the pilots did not tell their passengers about the attacks, fearing that it would cause fear and shock among the passengers. On some planes, the pilots were not told what had happened. One pilot told Global: "When we were in the air, we really didn't know what was going on. All we heard was security measures and we were diverted. That was all we knew, so."</p>
<p>Only after landing did the pilots tell their passengers what had happened, and on some planes, the pilots walked into the cabin and told their passengers what had happened. Due to security concerns, passengers waited for hours to get off the planes. Inside some of the airports, the passengers watched the television coverage. At others, stranded passengers wanted to talk to the airport chaplains, like at Pearson <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/clips/ram-lo/ormiston_planes010911.ram" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cbc.ca/clips/ram-lo/ormiston_planes010911.ram" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.</p>
<p>Some of the passengers were surprised to be in Canadian airspace. One woman at <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calgary_International_Airport_c787.html" title="Calgary International Airport">Calgary International Airport</a> told the <a href="../../../c/b/c/CBC_d905.html" title="CBC">CBC</a>: "We were going to San Francisco, but unfortunately, we've come to Calgary, instead."</p>

<p>Over the time that has followed, there were conflicting reports as to how many aircraft and how many passengers landed. Transport Canada said over 33,000 passengers on 224 flights, NavCanada said 239 flights. <a href="../../../j/e/a/Jean_Chr%C3%A9tien_401f.html" title="Jean Chrétien">Jean Chrétien</a>, who was <a href="../../../p/m/o/PMOC_bd0a.html" title="PMOC">Prime Minister</a> at the time, and the current prime minister, <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Martin_629b.html" title="Paul Martin">Paul Martin</a>, both said the number of flights was anywhere between 225 and 250 and that the number of passengers was anywhere between 30,000 and 45,000.</p>
<p>Generally, these numbers are accepted: In all, 44,519 passengers, most of them Americans, on 255 flights were diverted to airports in Canada, with more than half landing in Atlantic Canada airports - <a href="../../../g/o/o/Goose_Air_Base_69fa.html" title="Goose Air Base">Goose Bay</a>, <a href="../../../g/a/n/Gander%2C_Newfoundland_4e17.html" title="Gander, Newfoundland">Gander</a>, <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._John%27s%2C_Newfoundland_05da.html" title="St. John's, Newfoundland">St. John's</a>, and <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stephenville%2C_Newfoundland_and_Labrador_96bd.html" title="Stephenville, Newfoundland and Labrador">Stephenville</a>, all in <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newfoundland_and_Labrador_4e85.html" title="Newfoundland and Labrador">Newfoundland and Labrador</a>, and in <a href="../../../h/a/l/Halifax%2C_Nova_Scotia_4233.html" title="Halifax, Nova Scotia">Halifax</a>, all of which took in flights that were coming from Europe.</p>
<p>The airport that received the highest number of flights was Halifax International – 44, while Vancouver International received the highest number of passengers – 8,500.</p>
<p>Transport Canada and airports involved in the operation also reported a surge in traffic at their web sites for up-to-the-minute information concerning news releases, FAQ's, and diverted flight information. Just to name a few:</p>
<ul>
<li>Transport Canada reported that on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_12.html" title="September 12">September 12</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2001.html" title="2001">2001</a>, the day after the attacks, there were 47,000 visits to their web site on that day alone.</li>
<li>Halifax International Airport reported that in the month of September alone, there were 2.1 million visits to their web site, and in October, half a million, both are far above the 40,000 to 50,000 visits a month.</li>

<p>Operation Yellow Ribbon saw the best of Canadians as they helped the stranded air travelers during a time of tragedy for their American friends and neighbours down south. Over the months that followed, Chrétien and his wife, <a href="../../../a/l/i/Aline_Chr%C3%A9tien_cc85.html" title="Aline Chrétien">Aline</a>, lauded the Canadians for opening their hearts and homes to the stranded. The U.S. ambassador to Canada, <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Cellucci_a3c6.html" title="Paul Cellucci">Paul Cellucci</a>, Transport Minister David Collenette, <a href="../../../g/o/v/Governor_General_of_Canada_3270.html" title="Governor General of Canada">Governor General</a> <a href="../../../a/d/r/Adrienne_Clarkson_1680.html" title="Adrienne Clarkson">Adrienne Clarkson</a> and her husband, <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Ralston_Saul_c104.html" title="John Ralston Saul">John Ralston Saul</a>, and provincial premiers would also do the same. Airports also received thank-you messages from the passengers, airlines that had flights diverted, and U.S. <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._Citizenship_and_Immigration_Services_7def.html" title="U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services">immigration</a> and <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._Customs_and_Border_Protection_0fae.html" title="U.S. Customs and Border Protection">customs</a> officers for the kindness and generosity. The operation also resulted in numerous stories about the kindness and generosity given to the stranded passengers.</p>
<p>Some airports were cited for how they handled the crisis. To name a few:</p>
<ul>
<li>The British Columbia Aviation Council presented its 2001 Airport Management Award to Vancouver International for how they handled the situation, citing that it overcame many challenges in a professional and compassionate way.</li>
<li>The Canadian Public Relations Society (Nova Scotia) presented Halifax International an Amethyst Award in the Crisis Communications category, for best program honours for the authority’s crisis communications response to the situation.</li>
</ul>
<p>On <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_11.html" title="September 11">September 11</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002.html" title="2002">2002</a>, to mark the first anniversary of 9/11, about 2,500 people who were among 6,600 passengers on 39 flights that were diverted to Gander, Newfoundland and Labrador, gathered at Gander International Airport for Canada's memorial service to mark the first anniversary. Chrétien said to them that "9/11 will live long in memory as a day of terror and grief.
