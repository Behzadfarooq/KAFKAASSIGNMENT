<p>This article could do with a bit of cleanup. The first reference to Pah Wraiths doesn't make clear what they are, only later. (Okay, it's a bit fussy.) I'd also suggest, given his position as Emissary, more about the relationship with Bajor's religious establishment, notably Kai Wynn. All the "STNG" &amp; "DS9" pages need changes to the intro section. The "info box" is interfering with the character's name. --trekphiler, 16/11/05</p>

<dd>If all you're suggesting are minor tweaks I suggest you go ahead and start doing it, instead of waiting for some ad hoc committee to approve your ideas.

<p>Someone at an anonymous IP address has thrice removed "Sisko is the first <a href="../../../a/f/r/African-American_b405.html" title="African-American">African-American</a> lead character in a Star Trek series." from the article. The first removal had the edit comment "LaForge was on "The Next Generation", and Uhura was on "The Original Series". Sisko is NOT the first African-American lead character in Star Trek" to which I made the response that the operative word in the excised sentence is "lead" -- Sisko is the lead character, La Forge and Uhura play supporting roles in their respective series. The second time around, s/he replaced "lead character" with "captain." This is factually inaccurate: the captain of the Yamato in Contagion and of the Saratoga in STIV are both African-American. The third time around, s/he removed the entire sentence again. I am, again, putting the sentence back in. Please don't trim it again without offering a substantive rationale for it. (FYI, as I pointed out in an edit comment, the Kathryn Janeway article identifies her as the first female lead in a Trek series -- why aren't you hopping over there editing that article?). --<a href="../../../e/e/m/User%7EEEMeltonIV_6dc8.html" title="User:EEMeltonIV">EEMeltonIV</a> 05:14, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Webishtar contends that "By definition, if you appear in the opening credits, you are a lead character, which the characters of Geordi and Uhura both did". Whose definition? Wikipedia'own definition of lead (which, granted, doesn't say TV series): "A leading actor, leading actress, or simply lead, plays the role of the protagonist in a film or play. The word lead may also refer to the largest role in the piece...". Sisko's role seems to fit this definition. But, anyway, I've already reverted this three times, and will leave it to someone else to insert the material. If the hang-up is on the word "lead", then let's find another way to rephrase it, as Sisko being the first AA [whateverthehellitis] is significant. --<a href="../../../e/e/m/User%7EEEMeltonIV_6dc8.html" title="User:EEMeltonIV">EEMeltonIV</a> 14:56, 20 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I have changed the wording to "first African-American commanding officer to be a lead character in a Star Trek series." This is correct according to wiki's definition of lead character while still keeping the original premise of the line.<a href="../../../g/d/o/User%7EGdo01_992f.html" title="User:Gdo01">Gdo01</a> 15:22, 20 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>While this is better, Gdo01, some might take issue with the term "African-American". The nation of America is no longer in existence in the time of Star Trek, meaning that Sisco is not an American. This may seem like a small complaint, but I know many black people outside of the U.S. who get offended when they are labelled African-American, particularly since many of them have no connection to Africa or America. I'm not going to correct it, but I would like to point this out. --Wabishtar 16:35, 20 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>He was born in New Orleans, so he would be a man of African descent who was born in the continent of North America, hence African-American. I see nothing wrong with African-American since in the future it could still refer to geographical America rather than the country USA. <a href="../../../g/d/o/User%7EGdo01_992f.html" title="User:Gdo01">Gdo01</a> 15:50, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>And for what it's worth (which may not be much), Avery Brooks himself referred to his character as being African-American. --<a href="../../../e/e/m/User%7EEEMeltonIV_6dc8.html" title="User:EEMeltonIV">EEMeltonIV</a> 15:55, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
