<p>Does anybody have any authoritative ref on the psychoactive duration of BZP? Anecdotally it is reported to be 4-8 hours, but I haven't been able to google anything more substantive than that. Pubmed doesn't yield any definitive kinetic studies and even the DEA website doesn't say anything re: duration. --<a href="../../../b/k/0/User%7EBk0_a429.html" title="User:Bk0">Bk0</a> (<a href="../../../b/k/0/User_talk%7EBk0_24c3.html" title="User talk:Bk0">Talk</a>) 18:06, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<i>"BZP and TFMPP are central nervous system (CNS) stimulants. For BZP, doses of 20 to 100mgs produce euphoria, wakefulness and increased vigilance. The duration of action is 6 to 8 hours (Erowid, 1997). A combination of BZP and TFMPP is reported to produce effects similar to MDMA (Bedford, 2001), a substance that is sometimes referred to as an “entactogen”, (meaning ‘to touch within), (Nichols, 1996). Dehydration may be associated with BZP therefore risks of over re-hydration may be present. This effect is not discussed in the literature. However, anecdotes from the community suggest that it can be problematic if used in conjunction with alcohol. The duration of action for a 100mg dose is 6 – 8 hours. However, information from one user/distributor suggests that if 500mgs is taken, then wakefulness can last up to 48 hrs, however such a dose is likely to also cause nausea."</i><br />

<p>I've just experienced taking BZP and psychoactive effects were still present 14 hours after taking only 1 pill, the recommended dose. I now have the headache from hell and although I was able to sleep at various points during the day, I spent all the time after the first few hours wishing for it to wear off. re: the headache, <a href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/stuff/dailynews/3986354a7144.html" class="external free" title="http://www.stuff.co.nz/stuff/dailynews/3986354a7144.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.stuff.co.nz/stuff/dailynews/3986354a7144.html</a> indicates that demand is going down, at least in NZ. I'm in the UK and I bought some from an NZ site (which is clearly geared up to posting to anywhere) and it arrived after just 4 days. If my opinion were to be sought, I would *not* take this drug again; it's incredibly powerful and because of its status as a 'legal high', I really thought it would have little to no effect. I was overwhelmed by the effects (although the initial rushing was very nice), however the experience drags on and on to a kind of buzz that you can feel that won't go away. I'm in bed now (with laptop) 16 hours after taking it with a splitting headache, diminished cognitive ability, hunger is making an appearance today after not eating anything.. In short, it was unpleasant and I'm going to flush the other 3 pills down the toilet.</p>

<p>It is often claimed that BZP was first synthesised and/or patented as an anthelmintic in 1944. Can anybody find the patent?</p>
<p>Wellcome's 1944 patent 9828/44 from the London patent office related to a process for making a wide range of piperazines, not just BZP.</p>
<p>Wellcome states that the purpose of the patent was "to create new compounds" as well as "creating a new and novel way of making piperazine derivatives" there is no mention of application.</p>
<p>Staack RF, Maurer HH. Metabolism of designer drugs of abuse. Curr Drug Metab. 2005;6:259–74 says "BZP was originally synthesized as a potential anthelmintic agent" and provides no reference. Does anybody have other references for the "anthelmintic" rclaim to show that it is not an error? <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStargateinternational_7664.html" title="User:Stargateinternational">Stargateinternational</a> 08:08, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>It is commonly stated that “Benzylpiperazine was developed in 1944…” or “BZP was patented in 1944…” The primary reference used to support this statement was a paper published in 1973 (Bye et al, 1973).</p>
<p>A US Patent application number 2,415,785 dated 24 February 1943 refers to a method for making BZP, but we could find no patent application protecting benzylpiperazine itself. A paper received for publication in August 1943 refers to benzylpiperazine and references the removal of benzyl groups from piperazines as early as 1941.(Buck and Baltzly, (1941) cited in Feb., 1944) The fact that BZP is mentioned in this patent is evidence that it was a known substance prior to this date.</p>
<p>References to BZP in the literature predate interest in piperazines as anthelmintics. The earliest clinical trials in the literature relating to piperazine use as an anthelmintic are two articles in the British Medical Journal in 1953.</p>
<p>Bye’s 1973 paper is the only reference found linking BZP development to anthelmintic potential but it provides no reference to substantiate its claim. It is likely that in the early 1950’s all known piperazine derivatives were screened for anthelmintic use as they were for a number of potential treatments. Only a few, including piperazine citrate, and adipate salts were found to be useful and commercialised as both human and animal anthelmintics.</p>
<p>I'm adding a line to point out that BZP being first synthesised as a cattle wormer in 1944 is a myth.</p>

<p>Are we sure it's illegal to sell BZP in the UK? It's very easy to obtain online (prepackaged in gel-caps or compressed into tablets and sold as "dance pills"), and even in certain high-street 'headshops...' --Shalroth 12:49, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Piperazine based products are classified as Prescription Only Medicines (POM) in the UK. Any products containing salts of the ingredient, e.g. Benzylpiperazine (BZP) would be licensable under the Medicines Act and consequently anyone manufacturing and supplying it legally must hold the relevant licences to do so. Licensing records indicate that Benzylpiperazine has never been licensed by the MHRA as a medicine. Therefore, at present BZP pills would be classified as unlicensed and any advertising and sale would be in contravention of the Act. The MHRA has Enforcement powers and can take action against any organisations or persons found to be in contravention of the law.</p>

<dd>My understanding on the Act is that possession and import for personal use are still allowed under UK law. However, the main exporter of piperazine products is New Zealand which has made them schedule 4 meaning they can only be sold under strict conditions none of which are met. There is no loophole regarding the sale of piperazines as piperazines are now medicines by definition in the UK. <a href="../../../t/u/r/User%7ETurkeyphant_c67c.html" title="User:Turkeyphant"><i><b><span style="color:#0808C8">Tu</span><span style="color:#0606BE">rk</span><span style="color: #040488">ey</span><span style="color:#020264">ph</span><span style="color:#000064">an</span></b></i></a><a href="../../../t/u/r/User_talk%7ETurkeyphant_1d49.html" title="User talk:Turkeyphant"><sup><big>t</big></sup></a> 23:43, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The UK MHRA may have based some statements on a false premise: that BZP is a salt of piperazine. It isn't. Unless a product also contained a salt of piperazine their statement holds no value. This doesn't mean that it can't be classified as a medicine though due to its physiological effect, but not as a salt of piperazine. I cannot see any "strict condition" under NZ's MOD Act that prohibits an offshore sale at the present time. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStargateinternational_7664.html" title="User:Stargateinternational">Stargateinternational</a> 23:25, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I was wondering if anyone knew anything about other piperazines like "flippiperazine", "paraperazine", and "fluopiperazine". They are in many party pill brands but I can't seem to find anything about them - not even their chemical formulae, let alone details of their pharmacology. These may have to be in separate articles.</p>

<dd>Ironically even tho it appears to be difficult to find out what they are, a lot of people take them without second thought&#160;:-P <a href="../../../n/i/l/User%7ENil_Einne_a722.html" title="User:Nil Einne">Nil Einne</a> 03:50, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
