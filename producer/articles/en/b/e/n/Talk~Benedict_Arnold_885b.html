<hr />
<p><i>An event mentioned in this article is a June 1 selected anniversary</i></p>
<hr />
<p>The whole treatment of Benedict Arnold in this, as in most other studies, is exceptionally biassed. It assumes, wrongly, that the breach with Britain was the only honorable course open to Americans. It is probable that most people in America wanted to mainatin their ties to Britain and were loyal to the King. On that basis, it is the early part of Arnold's life which is regrettable, not his attempts to undo the damage he had done. The great economist Adam Smith was once asked if the United Sates posed a threat to Britain. He replied that it could not, because the colonies differ so much that they are obviously ungovernable as a single country. Recenet events seem to bear him out.</p>
<p>Hmmm... the "Eggs Benedict" story is at best questionable. The usual story is that the dish was invented at Delmonico's in Manhattan. The Swedish mistress thing could use some verification too, I suspect.... -- <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomeone_else_bc03.html" title="User:Someone else">Someone else</a> 03:02, 3 Sep 2003 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Both in the same edit by an anon IP, I'm guessing it was a joke and took it out. - <a href="../../../h/e/p/User%7EHephaestos_c32a.html" title="User:Hephaestos">Hephaestos</a> 03:12, 3 Sep 2003 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Good call, I think. A websearch shows that lots of people seem to associate the dish with Mr. Arnold, but best evidence so far suggests it was invented about 1894, when he was long dead, and unearths no evidence that he ever displayed any personal cooking prowess. Now, if I can get the bonus question ("When was hollandaise sauce invented?").... -- <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomeone_else_bc03.html" title="User:Someone else">Someone else</a> 03:16, 3 Sep 2003 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>I question the legitimacy of Arnold being considered a traitor-turned-patriot in Canada. I reside there and see no evidence of that at all. <a href="../../../o/b/e/User%7EOberiko_30df.html" title="User:Oberiko">Oberiko</a> 19:15, 20 Jun 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Regarding the above. I live in Canada as well, and my generation was taught that in school, that Arnold was a traitor, turned patriot to the british empire.... We were also taught "The sun never sets on the british empire" though.</p>
<p>Please check the history of Arnold in the Beauce area of Quebec where hotel (still existing) is named in his honour. It also the area he resided after the revolution for many years.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I have a feeling that's a result of reaching beyond the facts in an attempt to create a <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a>. As another example, the current intro of the article describes Arnold's actions (changing sides for money, selling out his comrades) as "rejoining the British." That's not a NPOV -- that's a <a href="../../../e/u/p/Euphemism.html" title="Euphemism">euphemism</a>. (And not really accurate, since he was not previously a British officer, so he can't "rejoin" them.) Set aside the American POV, and even by British military standards of the day, in which honor was highly regarded, Arnold's actions were in no way honorable. The British and Canadians may have found Arnold useful, but not respectable. --<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Myers_58fc.html" title="User:Kevin Myers">Kevin Myers</a> 05:05, 27 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p><br />
Also, this article has a clear american bias.</p>
<p>Referring to the 7 Years War, as it was known internationally, vs. the "French and Indian War" which is the american designation.</p>
<p>Benedict Arnold is not "best known" for plotting to surrender a fort to the british outside of america.</p>
<dl>
<dd>The "French and Indian War" and the "7 Years War" are not synonyms. For one thing, the former lasted 9 years (and not just 7). Secondly, it refers specifically to the theater of war in North America - the very theater that is referenced in the article, whereas the latter is a more general term.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As to what Benedict Arnold is "best known" for outside the US, I'd say that if people outside the US have heard of him at all it's because of his switching sides during. It's unlikely that people would be familiar with him for other stuff and not that, even if they don't have an opinion about the American Revolution. HowardW Feb 27, 2007.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I have to agree with Howard, there is no question that Benedict Arnold is best known for his betrayal. I'm American, and although I personally know of his military success, I know that most people do not, and to be called a Benedict Arnold is an insult not because he was a great military leader...</dd>

<p>My understanding is that Shippen herself was probably non-political (though she had a prior relationship with Major Andre). I believe that the Shippen family was considered "neutral" and that she pushed Arnold to treason not out of convinction but ambition.</p>
<p>Also, with respect to Arnold's treatment in England, he was somewhat shunned by the establishment there. --<a href="../../../a/m/c/User%7EAmcalabrese_64a8.html" title="User:Amcalabrese">Amcalabrese</a> 16:45, 10 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Since i'm supposedly directly related to Arnold i've read quite a bit about him and all i have read suggests that she was a loyalist, though the family wasn't all that involved in the war. So i seems like your half-right, but so is the article</p>

<p>Just plowed through a history channel documentary on Arnold, and decided to drop on by to enlighten myself a little more. I thought I'd note that Benedict Arnold's grave was (and still is) marked. I also question the suggestion that the British and Canadian colonists regarded him as a patriot after his defection to the British side. His fellow officers in the British army reportedly regarded him with contempt, which is partly why he didn't experience the military success that he had while fighting on the side of the American colonists. Even after the war, when he returned to England, people remained suspicious of him. He recieved a pension from the king for his "efforts", but never really fully integrated into English society (certainly not to the degree he had in the colonies). -- Kyle 09:00, 02/23/05</p>

<p>The article says that General Arnold defeated the British at Valcour Island. Unless he fought there on two occasions, I'm fairly sure he suffered a tactical defeat in that battle, being forced to beach his surviving ships in shallow water and strip them of their guns and stores. It could be considered a strategic victory though because the battle and the necessary preperation beforehand delayed the British forces from their planned offensive on Fort Ticonderoga until the next spring, when the Continentals were better prepared to face them. I'll find a cite for it when I can get a hold of the textbook for my friend's naval history class if anyone feels it's needed. -- <a href="../../../r/a/g/User%7ERaguleader_6976.html" title="User:Raguleader">Phil</a> 10:48, 03/23/05</p>

<p>This article was previously in dire need of categorizing. Although I'm certain that more can be done in this regard, I have gotten things started by breaking things down a little bit. On that subject, the article also seems somewhat fragmented, in that it tends to jump back and forth when discussing Benedict Arnold's personal life and wartime career. The article should be rewritten so that it has one section devoted to his personal life, while having another that discusses his wartime career and anything particularly relevent to that end. At a later date, if someone doesn't get to it first, I may take the time to restructure the content so that it better maintains its focus. - Ridan Krad 4/2/2005 @ 11:50 PM PST.</p>

<li>Looks good - but there's a limit to how much personal &amp; miltary life can be separated with Arnold.

<p>What does a picture of a capybara (or whatever that thing is) have to do with Benedict Arnold? I do not really care per say, it just seems odd to have this random picture go with this article. Especially with the caption reading "Benedict Arnold". I think someone is trying to be clever, I hope they got a laugh out of it but that undermines what Wikipedia is all about. How can people take this seriously when stuff like this happens, it destroys the crediblity of this whole organization. I could be mistaken however, maybe this picture is appropriate, can someone confirm?</p>

<p>This article is currently blissfully unaware of the historical debate about Arnold's role at Saratoga. Here's what the article says:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Historians agree that Arnold played an instrumental role in the outcome of the Saratoga campaign, showing courage, initiative and military brilliance. He is said to have almost singlehandedly cut off Burgoyne's attempt to escape in the decisive Battle of Bemis Heights.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Here's what Mark M. Boatner's <i>Encyclopedia of the American Revolution</i> says:</p>
<dl>
<dd>It is amusing, however, that while some writers credit Arnold with winning the two battles of Saratoga almost singlehanded, others question whether he even was on the field in the first battle and maintain that the second was won before he charged in to lead a costly, useless attack. (p. 31-2)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Our article goes on to say that "neither can there be doubt as to his crucial role in the Battle of Saratoga...", but of course, as Boatner's article indicates, there's been a lot of doubt about it. Ward's <i>The War of the Revolution</i> has an appendix devoted to the topic, and like most historians, he concludes that Arnold was present at the battle. But a number of historians in the past doubted it.</p>
<p>Boatner also regards the story of Arnold being buried in his Continental Army uniform as "improbable".</p>
<p>Hopefully someone familiar with the historiography will someday write a well-informed article on this guy, covering the way Arnold's actions have been debated over the years. --<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Myers_58fc.html" title="User:Kevin Myers">Kevin Myers</a> | <a href="../../../k/e/v/User_talk%7EKevin_Myers_d288.html" title="User talk:Kevin Myers">(complaint dept.)</a> 03:28, 19 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>The consensus still seems to be he was instrumental. But of course thers those that disagree, and that should be in there. But either way, Arnold was instrumental in the colonies defeating Britain even if he later defected. 12.220.94.199 01:23, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>By then Arnold was an embittered man, disdainful of his fellow officers and resentful toward Congress for not promoting him more quickly and to even higher rank. A widower, he threw himself into the social life of the city, holding grand parties, courting and marrying Margaret Shippen, "a talented young woman of good family, who at nineteen, was half his age" and failing deeply into debt. Arnold's extravagance drew him into shady financial schemes and into disrepute with Congress, which investigated his accounts and recommended a court-martial.

<dd>By then, Arnold was an embittered man, resentful toward Congress for not approving his wartime expenses and bypassing him for promotion. A widower, he threw himself into the social life of the city, hosting grand parties, and falling deeply into debt. Arnold's extravagance drew him into shady financial schemes and into further disrepute with Congress, which investigated his accounts. On June 1, 1779, he was court-martialed for malfeasance.

<dd>At the end of March, 1779, he met Peggy Shippen, the boisterous 18 year old daughter of Judge Edward Shippen. [8] Arnold and Shippen wed quickly on April 8, 1779. It is interesting to note that Peggy had previously been courted by British Major John André during the British occupation of Philadelphia.</dd>

<p>Excellent article in my opinion.</p>
<p>The Arnold plot began to unravel just as George Washington, his Commander in Chief, friend and rival, decided to "drop in" on the Arnolds! He found a nearly hysterical Peggy Arnold, whom Arnold had left to fend for herself, trying desparately to keep herself from being hung yet trying to "buy time" for Benedict to get away! Few people seem to mention Washington's appearance.

I also think that if the link is kept the home page with the donation request should be skipped and the link point directly to the New London &amp; Groton page (in keeping with our guidelines). My own opinion is that a wikilink to the Wikipedia article on the Battle of Groton Heights would be most appropriate, but I'm not a regular editor of this article and do not know how important that battle is in Arnold's career.

<p>The article as it stands today skips directly from "Pre-revolutionary activities" to "West Point", and makes no mention of anything between the death of his first wife in 1775 and his obtaining command of West Point in 1780 - a fairly crucial 5-year gap. I understand there is controversy regarding his role at Saratoga (according to the discussion above); the document history shows large passages regarding this period of his career being added and then deleted, in between frequent episodes of vandalism and reversion. My knowledge here is spotty (I came to read about Benedict Arnold, not to edit). I make the humble suggestion that someone work up a section on Arnold between 1775 (or 1770) and 1780, and that this article be semi-protected on account of the frequent vandalism. --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavecampbell_a2f7.html" title="User:Davecampbell">Davecampbell</a> 20:09, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I added a few sentences on Arnold's last years. Someone may want to find a better location. -- <a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAstrochemist_94ac.html" title="User:Astrochemist">Astrochemist</a> 14:29, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>There was nothing in the article about Arnold's important Valcour Island campaign. I added a description based on the Wikipedia article.</p>
<p>There were some serious style problems. A lot of run-on sentences, too much use of passive voice, and wordy phrasings. I corrected many of these.</p>
<p>The initial summary paragraph went off into excessive details. I moved these details down into the body of the article, and rewrote the summary to be concise.</p>
<p>I made no substantive changes whatever.</p>
