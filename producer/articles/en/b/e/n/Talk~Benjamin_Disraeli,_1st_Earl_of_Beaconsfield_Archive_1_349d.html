<dd>The cure for ignorance is more knowledge. That you don't yet see why these cross-references are meaningful means that I have not yet explained the connection well enough. I shall continue to keep re-writing the article, adding more explanatory information each time, until it meets with your approval.

<dd>It is a matter of wording, yes, but also straining a bit to make a "contemporary" reference to somewhat <i>pass√©</i> examples. Mr. T. wasn't emulating Disraeli, so the most you could say would be "much like <a href="../../../m/r/2E/Mr._T._207d.html" title="Mr. T.">Mr. T.</a> a century later". As for the <a href="../../../g/r/a/Gracie_Allen_876b.html" title="Gracie Allen">Gracie Allen</a> comparison, you have to be over 50 to get it, so I think <i>airhead</i> takes care of it.

<dd>The English considered Jewishness a race as well as a religion, which many others also did and do. His father raised his family in the synagogue until Benjamin was 11, whereupon he baptized his children in the C of E. Although Disraeli was a committed Christian, he never denied his Jewishness (which was often thrown up to him) and, in fact, did much to popularize the modern notion of the Judeo-Christian tradition. This Jewishness is certainly relevant to this article as it is always mentioned in <b>any</b> discussion of Disraeli. <a href="../../../o/r/t/User%7EOrtolan88_d8ce.html" title="User:Ortolan88">Ortolan88</a></dd>

<p>Could we say that he's the first, and only <b>Jew</b> to serve as Prime Minister? I feel like to say someone is a Jew is to make an ethnic statement, while to say they are Jewish implies a religious commitment, as well.

<dd>Perhaps you could say that he was the first and only person of Jewish ethnic origin to serve as Prime Minister. Some people feel that the word 'Jew' as a noun is derogatory. -- <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrancs2000_6420.html" title="User:Francs2000">Francs2000</a> 07:04, 4 Jan 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Incidentally I read somewhere that Disreali's conversion to C of E from Judaism was marked by the alteration of his surname from <b>D'Israeli</b> to <b>Disreali</b>.

<dd>Unknown. As late as 1837 Greville referred to him as "D'Israeli," on the occasion of his maiden speech. On the other hand, Disraeli himself released the book <i>Vindication</i>, by "Disraeli the Younger." Even on into the early 1850's D'Orsay wrote to him as "D'I", so the usage certainly seems inconsistent. Disraeli was baptized om July 31, 1817. According to Robert Blake, Disraeli first altered his surname in a letter to John Murray in 1822. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackensen_13da.html" title="User:Mackensen">Mackensen</a> 16:22, 4 Jan 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Would it not be appropriate to move the page to <a href="../../../b/e/n/Benjamin_Disraeli%2C_1st_Earl_of_Beaconsfield_74ac.html" title="Benjamin Disraeli, 1st Earl of Beaconsfield">Benjamin Disraeli, 1st Earl of Beaconsfield</a>?</p>
<p>I dunno...he's better known as just Disraeli... <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john</a> 06:57, 4 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>For most of his political career he was just called Benjamin Disraeli, and was awarded the earldom much later. As he achieved his fame before becoming the Earl of Beaconsfield I say leave it as it is. -- <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrancs2000_6420.html" title="User:Francs2000">Francs2000</a> 07:02, 4 Jan 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>On the other hand, he was Earl of Beaconsfield (and called such) for the majority of his time as Prime Minister (1876-1880 as opposed to 1868 and 1874-1876). <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john</a> 07:13, 4 Jan 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well then it's just a question of whether the article should go under the name he was better known as (<a href="../../../b/e/n/Benjamin_Disraeli_2257.html" title="Benjamin Disraeli">Benjamin Disraeli</a>) or his actual name and full title (<a href="../../../b/e/n/Benjamin_Disraeli%2C_1st_Earl_of_Beaconsfield_74ac.html" title="Benjamin Disraeli, 1st Earl of Beaconsfield">Benjamin Disraeli, 1st Earl of Beaconsfield</a>).

<dd>Well, I think we'd really need to have a much clearer policy on these things to come to any firm decision. The easiest and most consistent thing would be to just have all hereditary peers listed under their highest title, but that would result in a lot of weirdness, like <a href="../../../a/r/t/Arthur_James_Balfour%2C_1st_Earl_of_Balfour_48b5.html" title="Arthur James Balfour, 1st Earl of Balfour">Arthur James Balfour, 1st Earl of Balfour</a>, or what not... <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john</a> 07:22, 4 Jan 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Well now I'm not so sure, I just looked at the talk page for <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28names_and_titles%29_dca3.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (names and titles)">Wikipedia:Naming conventions (names and titles)</a> and there it says that <a href="../../../b/e/n/Benjamin_Disraeli_2257.html" title="Benjamin Disraeli">Benjamin Disraeli</a> is preferable, which goes against what the convention says.

<dl>
<dd>The talk page also mentions Stanley Baldwin, but Baldwin was created a peer <b>after</b> resignation as PM, so the title of a commoner would be more commonly used and ought to be used. However, Lord Beaconsfield became a peer during his tenure as PM, and would have been known by such a title during his prime ministership, so the page could be acceptably located where the title is also mentioned. -- <a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELord_Emsworth_c212.html" title="User:Lord Emsworth">Lord Emsworth</a> 15:28, Jan 4, 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>In the 1898 edition of <a href="../../../p/e/a/Pears_Cyclopaedia_e255.html" title="Pears Cyclopaedia">Pears Cyclopaedia</a>, if you look up 'Disraeli' it says "See Beaconsfield". Benjamin Disraeli, 1st Earl of Beaconsfield is the most sensible place. <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMintguy_d760.html" title="User:Mintguy">Mintguy</a> 15:51, 4 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Books treating his second premiership usually refer to "Beaconsfieldism," certainly Lowe and Bright did when attacking Disraeli. This is probably best. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackensen_13da.html" title="User:Mackensen">Mackensen</a> 16:08, 4 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>I moved it back here. The discussion both here and at the WikiProject Peerage discussion has led towards that conclusion, and all the redirects point here. Unless someone is willing to put in the work to change the redirects, it should stay here. (Especially since, as we've noted several times at the WikiProject Peerage page, most other encyclopedias list his peerage title). <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john</a> 02:32, 8 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>I don't object to the current location, but to make things clearer for people who make be confused about why he is referred to by various names at various times, would it make sense to modify the intro from:</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>Benjamin Disraeli, 1st Earl of Beaconsfield</b>...</dd>
</dl>
<p>to</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>Benjamin Disraeli</b>, after <a href="../../../1/8/7/1876.html" title="1876">1876</a> the <b>1st Earl of Beaconsfield</b>...</dd>
</dl>
<p>This would give our readers some hint as to why he might sometimes, especially earlier, be known simply as <i>Benjamin Disraeli</i>, and later be known as <i>Beaconsfield</i>. --<a href="../../../d/e/l/User%7EDelirium_b0dc.html" title="User:Delirium">Delirium</a> 19:15, Jan 12, 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>I can't understand the need this dumbing down. It is not a convention followed by any other encyclopaedia. What would you have for <a href="../../../a/r/t/Arthur_Wellesley%2C_1st_Duke_of_Wellington_10be.html" title="Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington">Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington</a>, "Arthur Wellesley, after 1809 Viscount Wellington, after February 1812 Earl Wellington, after October 1812 Marquess Wellington, after 1814 Duke of Wellington"? The bulk of his military activity occured before he was elevated, and he was known to many of his contemporaties simply as Wellesley. <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMintguy_d760.html" title="User:Mintguy">Mintguy</a> <a href="../../../m/i/n/User_talk%7EMintguy_20fd.html" title="User talk:Mintguy">(T)</a> 21:02, 12 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'd actually prefer that chain of "after [x] known as [y]", since it clarifies what's what. Simply calling someone by the name they had when they died is confusing, as they may have been known by a different name through most of their career. --<a href="../../../d/e/l/User%7EDelirium_b0dc.html" title="User:Delirium">Delirium</a> 01:43, Jan 15, 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think it needs to be judged on individual merit, depending on who the article is about. By this virtue I believe this page is in the right place, going by comments made above with regard to his politics and I agree that the "after 1876 known as 1st Earl of Beaconsfield" suggestion is dumbing it down a little too much. Also Mintguy's comment is valid, as many distinguished people in history went through many titles, and to list them all in the article title would be confusing and totally unnecessary. -- <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrancs2000_6420.html" title="User:Francs2000">Graham :)</a> 21:16, 17 Jan 2004 (UTC)</dd>
