<p>Parsons spent his childhood years in the <a href="../../../b/l/u/Blue_Ridge_Mountains_e511.html" title="Blue Ridge Mountains">Blue Ridge Mountains</a> of <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_Carolina_5c52.html" title="North Carolina">North Carolina</a> and played football for Millers Creek High School (now known as West Wilkes High School) in <a href="../../../w/i/l/Wilkes_County%2C_North_Carolina_4606.html" title="Wilkes County, North Carolina">Wilkes County</a>. Following high school, he moved to <a href="../../../d/e/t/Detroit%2C_Michigan_ae78.html" title="Detroit, Michigan">Detroit, Michigan</a> where his father operated a <a href="../../../t/a/x/Taxicab.html" title="Taxicab">taxicab</a> company. Parsons worked at a gas station and drove cabs in Detroit before beginning his racing career. While working at the gas station one day, a couple of customers towing a race car invited him to a local race track. The driver of the car never showed up for that evening's race, and Parsons drove the car in a race for the first time later that night.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>

<p>Parsons began his NASCAR career by running one race in 1964 for <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holman-Moody_4e84.html" title="Holman-Moody">Holman-Moody</a> with a young <a href="../../../c/a/l/Cale_Yarborough_0927.html" title="Cale Yarborough">Cale Yarborough</a>.</p>
<p>Parsons won the 1968 and 1969 <a href="../../../a/u/t/Auto_Racing_Club_of_America_85c1.html" title="Auto Racing Club of America">ARCA</a> championships.</p>
<p>Parsons had three top-10 finishes in four NASCAR races in 1969.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/n/Benny_Parsons_9457.html" title="Edit section: 1970s">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">1970s</span></h3>
<p>He joined the circuit full-time in 1970 with Pit Crew Chief, <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Hill_902e.html" title="John Hill">John Hill</a>. He had 23 top-10 finishes in 45 races, a pole at Langley Field Speedway, and finished eighth in the points. He raced in the #72 L.G. DeWitt/DeWitt Racing car.</p>
<p>Parsons had 18 top-10 finishes in 35 starts in 1971, including his first win at <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Boston_Speedway_f443.html" title="South Boston Speedway">South Boston Speedway</a>. He finished eleventh in the points.</p>
<p>In 1972 he had 19 top-10 finishes in 31 races. He finished fifth in the final points standings.</p>
<p>In 1973 he won the <a href="../../../n/a/s/NASCAR_Championship_4276.html" title="NASCAR Championship">NASCAR Championship</a> with only one win, even though <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Pearson_90a8.html" title="David Pearson">David Pearson</a> won eleven races (but Pearson only entered eighteen events). Parsons consistency likely won him the championship: he had 21 top-10 and 15 top-5 finishes in the 28 events. His improbable return to the track after an early crash cemented his championship at Rockingham, North Carolina. He saw his championship hopes start to fade as he was involved in a lap 13 crash and his car was heavily damaged. He took to the pits to muster whatever he could out of the car and hope for a top five finish in the final standings. The rest of the garage was hoping to see the underdog unseat the mighty <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Petty_5d34.html" title="Richard Petty">Richard Petty</a> and joined in to help Parsons' crew put the car back together. Parsons miraculously got back on the track 136 laps later and completed enough laps to finish 25th and take the 1973 championship. Richard Petty, with the championship in his sights after winning the pole and seeing Parsons' accident, had engine trouble and was relegated to a 35th place finish. The poor performance dropped Petty all the way to fifth in the final standings, as Cale Yarborough took the runner up spot on the season with his third place effort. He finished 67.15 points behind the champion. Cecil Gordon's 11th place finish was good enough for third in the standings and James Hylton finished 19th, enough to overtake Petty for fourth.</p>
<p>1973 is considered the start of the modern era in NASCAR, so Parsons is considered the first modern era champion. Parsons also became the only person to win both ARCA and NASCAR championships.</p>
<p>Parsons finished between third and fifth in the final points from 1974 to 1980. He won the 1975 <a href="../../../d/a/y/Daytona_500.html" title="Daytona 500">Daytona 500</a>. He switched to the #27 car for M.C. Anderson starting in 1979.</p>

<p>He won the 1980 <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_600.html" title="World 600">World 600</a> at <a href="../../../l/o/w/Lowe%27s_Motor_Speedway_3581.html" title="Lowe's Motor Speedway">Charlotte</a> and finished 3rd in points.</p>

He ran the first half of the season for Harry Ranier, and ran some of the other races between four other teams.</p>
<p>Parsons raced in about half of the races between 1983 and 1986 for owner <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johnny_Hayes_8041.html" title="Johnny Hayes">Johnny Hayes</a>.

<p>He began announcing as a pit reporter in the 1980s on ESPN and TBS while he was still racing part-time. After permanently retiring from racing in 1988, Parsons became a broadcaster – first on <a href="../../../e/s/p/ESPN_7b0e.html" title="ESPN">ESPN</a>, and then with <a href="../../../n/b/c/NBC_Sports_cf05.html" title="NBC Sports">NBC</a> and <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turner_Network_Television_1fb6.html" title="Turner Network Television">TNT</a> in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2001.html" title="2001">2001</a>. He received a ESPN Emmy in 1996, and the ACE Award in 1989.</p>
<p>Parsons co-hosted coverage of Winston Cup Qualifying on North Carolina radio station <a href="../../../w/f/m/WFMX_2685.html" title="WFMX">WFMX</a> with Mark Garrow in the early 90s. He continued to host a radio program called "Fast Talk with Benny Parsons" on <a href="../../../p/e/r/Performance_Racing_Network_a635.html" title="Performance Racing Network">Performance Racing Network</a> (PRN) until his death. He also had a podcast available on iTunes, in conjunction with <a href="../../../c/n/n/CNN_2435.html" title="CNN">CNN</a> called "The CNN Radio Racing Report with Benny Parsons," who talks about NASCAR with CNNRadio's Michael Jones.</p>

<p>Parsons began having trouble breathing in the summer of 2006. He was diagnosed with lung cancer. He announced later that the treatment had been successful, and that he had a clean bill of health. He then had difficulty breathing, and it was said the <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radiation.html" title="Radiation">radiation</a> had damaged his left lung, making it unable to function properly. Doctors said his body would adjust to his good lung. Parsons had stopped smoking in 1978.</p>
<p>His health prevented him from attending a ceremony in November 2006 where he was to be presented with the Myers Brothers Award, honoring his contributions to racing.</p>
