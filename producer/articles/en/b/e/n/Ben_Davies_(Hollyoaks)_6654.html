<p>Ben arrived in the village and was a big hit as the hunky new <a href="../../../f/i/r/Fireman.html" title="Fireman">fireman</a>. Ben was an immediate hit with <a href="../../../m/a/n/Mandy_Richardson_f02f.html" title="Mandy Richardson">Mandy Richardson</a> and <a href="../../../c/i/n/Cindy_Cunningham_64da.html" title="Cindy Cunningham">Cindy Cunningham</a>, although Mandy was a bit miffed when he brushed her off for Cindy. Ben instantly fell for <a href="../../../c/i/n/Cindy_Cunningham_64da.html" title="Cindy Cunningham">Cindy Cunningham</a>, as his relationship with Cindy lasted a while, until social services contacted her, with reports that she had been mistreating her daughter, Holly.</p>
<p>Cindy believed that the social services wanted to put Holly with foster parents, and decided to run away to Spain and flee the country and Ben had helped her by driving her to the airport but on the accidentally ran <a href="../../../a/n/n/Anna_Green_0d51.html" title="Anna Green">Anna Green</a> over after saying good bye to Cindy he came back to Village. Anna remembered Ben had driven the car that knocked her down after Ben almost ran her down for a second time and she remembered he was in the car the first time.</p>
<p>Ben tried to apologise to her but his apologies fell on deaf ears but he proved to be a good friend to Anna when she was pregnant and the two shared a bond. Ben soon turned his attentions to <a href="../../../m/a/n/Mandy_Richardson_f02f.html" title="Mandy Richardson">Mandy Richardson</a>, even though he knew that his best friend <a href="../../../l/u/k/Luke_Morgan_a429.html" title="Luke Morgan">Luke Morgan</a> wanted her back. Despite his affair with Mandy, Ben proved to be a vital friend to Luke, helping him get over his rape ordeal.</p>
<p>However, when Luke found out about Mandy and Ben, he felt devastated and betrayed, leaving the guilty pair to reconsider their future. Ben and Luke had not been on best of terms and Luke tried to muscle in on the running of Mandy's business, which he invested in. However, Ben was rather jealous of this, and told Mandy that she should just pay Luke back all of the money and tell Luke to leave the business alone.</p>
<p>However, Ben and Luke made up, thanks to <a href="../../../a/d/a/Adam_Morgan_%28Hollyoaks%29_6113.html" title="Adam Morgan (Hollyoaks)">Adam Morgan</a>'s <b>Game 4 It video</b>, on which they saw themselves fighting, and realised how ridiculous their disagreement was. Ben soon grew tired out of Mandy’s impetuous behaviour and reverted to being a ‘lad about town’. Ben embarked on a love/hate relationship with <a href="../../../i/z/z/Izzy_Cornwell_8bb5.html" title="Izzy Cornwell">Izzy Cornwell</a> as the pair often winded each other up, but despite many attempts to sleep with Izzy, Ben failed.</p>
<p>Ben’s character had turned into a sex mechanic and pulled anything with a pulse. He had a brief relationship with <a href="../../../e/l/l/Ellie_Hunter_06c1.html" title="Ellie Hunter">Ellie Hunter</a> but the relationship never seemed to go anywhere and Ben was to face a tough challenge in his life. During a Potholig Trip, Ben suffured a sequence of horrific consequences when their was a rock fall which left <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theo_Sankofa_330b.html" title="Theo Sankofa">Theo Sankofa</a> and <a href="../../../j/a/m/Jamie_Nash_53e7.html" title="Jamie Nash">Jamie Nash</a> dead. Ben felt responsible as he took the wrong actions in attempts to save Jamie's life, which resulted in his death.</p>
<p>This experience left Ben devastated, but both his father Will and sister Abby helped him get over the tragedy and Ben also found support from Izzy as well. Just as Ben seemed to be getting his life back on track, he was not pleased when he discovered that his dad's police colleague, Dale Jackson, had moved in with the Davies household.</p>
<p>Ben hated the idea of another womenin the house, knowing that his father, Will, fancied her and sister Abby thought Dale was like a mother figure. However, Ben soon succumbed to Dale’s charms and ended up in bed with her! After trying to avoid her charms, Ben again managed to sleep with her, only to be caught by his father.</p>
<p>Feeling guilty, Ben was surprised at his father's reaction which was that he refused to get involved, although Ben had learnt his lessons when Dale made another final attempt which this time Ben avoided as she left Hollyoaks. Ben realised his true love of his life Izzy, but found it difficult to tell her as she left for a trip around the world.</p>
<p>Instead Ben turned his attentions to Emma Chambers and after a one night stand, Ben still knew that Izzy is the one for him. When she returned Ben managed to do the unthinkable and asked her to marry him and she accepted. However, Izzy was unaware about Emma and that she was pregnant with Ben's child, a secret well kept by Ben away from her.</p>
<p>During the night before the wedding Izzy found out about Emma's pregnancy but still decided to go ahead with the wedding- much to Ben's relief. But the marriage was not to last as Izzy found it hard to cope with the birth of Ben's child Arthur, and after knowing she was unable to have children, she decided to end their marriage by sleeping with Scott Anderson, Ben's enemy. Despite this Ben decided to forgive her, but Izzy was adamant that the marriage was over and left him.</p>
<p>More struggle was to follow for Ben as he also lost his best friend <a href="../../../d/a/n/Dan_Hunter_7acc.html" title="Dan Hunter">Dan Hunter</a> who died in a rally car explosion, which made his younger sister, <a href="../../../l/i/s/Lisa_Hunter_c05f.html" title="Lisa Hunter">Lisa</a>, grew closer to Ben and he pair both shared a kiss, but Ben was adamant that the relationship was not to work because of the age gap. Lisa the started having an affair with <a href="../../../j/a/k/Jake_Dean_1f1a.html" title="Jake Dean">Jake Dean</a>, one Dan's other friends, who was dating Ben's friend <a href="../../../b/e/c/Becca_Dean_aa43.html" title="Becca Dean">Becca Hayton</a>.</p>
<p>Jake confessed the affair to Becca and told her she was the only woman he wanted. Jake turned to Ben for help to win Becca back and was even there when Jake proposed to Becca in the village. Ben would serve as Jake's best man at the wedding. Meanwhile another fling was on the cards for Ben as he dated Louise Summers but still he could not fight his feelings for Lisa. Eventually Ben dumped Louise and began to date Lisa as the pair confirmed their relationship which shocked a few including The Hunter family.</p>
<p>As the relationship went from strength to strength, both Ben and Lisa decided to move away from their friends and family and to move in together as the pair said farewell to Hollyoaks.</p>

<p>The pair then went to live in the big city and crossed over into their own spin off show Hollyoaks:Let Loose.</p>
<p>They currently reside in Liverpool Where Ben works as a Doorman for a nightclub. Ben was shot dead by Lisa in the final episode of <i><a href="../../../i/n/_/Hollyoaks%7E_In_The_City_b9e6.html" title="Hollyoaks: In The City">Hollyoaks: In The City</a></i>.</p>
