<h2><span class="mw-headline">Theme song voice talent</span></h2>
<p>I was wondering who sings the theme song for Ben 10? It's Musicaly like Puffy Ami Yumi, but sounds like it was sung by someone else. - <a href="../../../t/a/l/User%7ETalenSoti_2004.html" title="User:TalenSoti">Talen Soti</a> 05:51, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Credits don't say. They only list Andy Sturmer as the writer. In fact, no matter how much I search, I can't find any information on the singers. - <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomeguy0830_d67f.html" title="User:Someguy0830">Someguy0830</a> 09:32, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>It cold be that the actresses from the show sing it, one of the voices sounds like Tara Strong. - <a href="../../../t/a/l/User%7ETalenSoti_2004.html" title="User:TalenSoti">Talen Soti</a> 03:49, 21 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Finally! Screenshots! I was gonna add them myself, but I can see someguy0830 did already. They are copyrighted, but should fall under the fair use of copyrighted material, since they are in low quality JPEG format.

<ul>
<li>The licences on each one are clearly and accurately marked and the source properly documented. The other three will show up when they give the last three transformation sequences. As for the quality, blame the sequences. Had I used random images they'd look a lot better. Having those specific images just seemed appropriate. - <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomeguy0830_d67f.html" title="User:Someguy0830">Someguy0830</a> 07:44, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Yes, the screenshots of the aliens with the transformation sequences are most appropriate for a screenshot. I was going to add the pictures when I acquired all the sequences, but I'm just too busy from school work and whatnot. Anyway, thanks again! You're a great help to us! <a href="../../../a/r/u/User%7EArukun14_7d40.html" title="User:Arukun14">Arukun14</a> 07:59, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Connection with "Dial H for Hero</span></h2>
<p>I was wondering; the premise of this show seems remarkably similar to the comic book "Dial H for Hero". Is this a coincidence, or is there a connection?</p>
<p>The idea fo "H" is multiple super-hero identities for each sitaution. Ben 10 has these rules significantly smaller, as for only 10 instead of infinite. "H" is most liklely an inspiration. - Mishy DIshy</p>
<p>Ben 10 is essentially what Dial H would need to be like for television, limiting the character to a few recognizable superheroes/aliens with a little variation here and there. I love Dial H for Hero, and I'm a fan of the Man of Action creators, so it's nice to see Ben 10 on the air. --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisGriswold_2071.html" title="User:ChrisGriswold">Chris Griswold</a> 13:46, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I know that they will never discuss this on the show (and I'll probably thought of as a troll), but if an alien's bone is broken, will it break Ben's bones? Same concept applied to Diamondhead's limbs, the timer expires before he can finish regrowing his limbs, what will happen?</p>
<p>he would probabl just revert to how he was before like his dna returns to the way it was before the transformation...oh i was also looking on tv.com and they said that ben 10 has been renwed for a 4th season which was apparently information told to them by meagan smith the voice of gwen isn't that great&#160;:D</p>
<p>yeah well Ben's Dna wouldn't change so he would have no broken bones and then if he changed back into the same alien it would be like it always would. A ingurey doesn't affect Dna.</p>

Have you ever looked in the <a href="../../../a/n/i/Anime-influenced_animation.html" title="Anime-influenced animation">Anime-influenced animation</a> section of wikipedia? You'll find it there. Also, it is more Anime-like than Avatar: The Last Airbender, The Boondocks (tv series), Fantastic Four (2006 TV series), Code Lyoko, Xiaolin Showdown, Shuriken School, Winx Club, W.I.T.C.H. (tv series), Super Robot Monkey Team Hyperforce Go!, Hi Hi Puffy AmiYumi, Kappa Mikey, Æon Flux, or even A.T.O.M. could ever hope to become.

<p>I know, but i wouldn't do this if it wasn't an anime-related show. it just seemed like an anime-influenced show to me. Thats all. I mean no harm. I swear. Anyone could have been fooled. I know i was.</p>

<dd>I think that some of the confusion might be in the style of the animation. Gwen and Ben seem to have large eyes, perhaps slightly out of proportion to their face. This is a common techniques of anime which was developed to express more emotion on the faces of the characters.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>That might hint of anime influence or it could be a case of animation convergance evolution (Where two animals from different parts of the world have many similarities).</dd>

<p>I see very little anime-influence in Ben 10. What I DO see is <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_Kirby_cae4.html" title="Jack Kirby">Jack Kirby</a> influence. You have the Kirby Krackle in the logo and opening seen (that stuff in the middle of the 0 of Ben 10 is Kirby Krackle). The 'Plumbers' seem similiar to Kirby's <a href="../../../c/h/a/Challengers_of_the_Unknown_67f8.html" title="Challengers of the Unknown">Challengers of the Unknown</a>.

<p>I don't find it anime-influenced at all. Nor do I find half the stuff listed there anime-influenced (unless you're going for the "it's action/plot based, so it must be anime-influenced!" angle) You must remember the anime style originated from American animation. Disney and MGM cartoons did the whole "big eye" concept which Osamu Tezuka borrowed and did for his work. Just because a show has detailed or stylized character designs doesn't mean it's trying to be like anime. Now Teen Titans is anime-influenced, sure, because of all those wacky expressions and what not, but Ben 10 doesn't have any of those.<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmibite_d059.html" title="User:Amibite">Amibite</a> 9/24/06]]]</p>
