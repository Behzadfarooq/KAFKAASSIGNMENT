<dd>No you don't understand, this is an encyclopedia, not a news website. Peoeple are looking Ben up on Google because he's in the news right now while John Reaves is not. This subject does not warrant its own page as interest will tank in just a couple months - just imagine how 10 years from now no one will even recall Ben's name. I suggest adding Ben and his fellow kidnappee to the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_kidnappings.html" title="List of kidnappings">List of kidnappings</a> articlee and then creaeting a re-direct for any "Ben Ownby" search queries.SirLamer 00:48, 14 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>How do you know "interest will tank". We have articles on Steven Staynor and Elizabeth Smart. In the years to come we will see trials, interviews, books and movies. The article stays-no merge, no re-direct. What is wrong with you people! We have articles on obscure Slovenian poets that not even 5 people know but you want to censor a story that is on the front page world wide. Give me a break.

<dd>Um, this article hasn't even been nominated for deletion yet. IMO, if the one kid who was missing for 4 years gets deleted, then Ben, who was missing for 4 days should as well. I have nothing against either, and it's truly a sad story. However <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_not_a_crystal_ball_01e8.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not a crystal ball">Wikipedia is not a crystal ball</a>. Do we know for a fact that they'll become more notable? Not yet. That's basically why the Shawn article was nominated.

<dd>I was going to use the not a crystal ball argument the other way. Right now he *IS* notable and wikipedia does not know that he will become less so. Since its not a crystal ball should be keep (well we will see how the other AfD comes out) and if in the future it becomes approprate the article could go. Though I think right now all three articles (both boys and the man) should be merged into one article simply because I think it would make a better article and they shoudl be split out as needed if needed. <a href="../../../d/a/l/User%7EDalf_cbb4.html" title="User:Dalf">Dalf</a> | <a href="../../../d/a/l/User_talk%7EDalf_cae6.html" title="User talk:Dalf">Talk</a> 23:45, 15 January 2007 (UTC)

Policy says that because we are "in doubt about the notability of the person in question", we should "err on the side of caution and simply list the year of birth rather than the exact date". That is what is currently on the page. <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elizabeth_Smart_ac0a.html" title="Elizabeth Smart">Elizabeth Smart</a> and the others you mentioned, are currently over 18 or are "famous people" such as actors and musicians, in which case, they are not the same. The smart thing to do would be to just include the birth year or the month, which is what was done. As I am an administrator, my only opinion is policy, and I am, therefore, quite neutral on this topic. <a href="../../../c/b/r/User%7ECbrown1023_a728.html" title="User:Cbrown1023">Cbrown1023</a> 21:31, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>On the <a href="../../../s/h/a/Talk%7EShawn_Hornbeck_2735.html#Alleged" title="Talk:Shawn Hornbeck">Shawn Hornbeck talk page</a>, there's a "discussion" regarding whether Shawn is an "alleged" kidnapping victim or a kidnapping victim. Pointing out the discrepancy here that Ben is listed as a kidnapping victim, not alleged. So which is it? I believe the two articles should be consistent on this point whichever label is ultimately decided. Gschrive87 16:55, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Personally, I think it should be said that he is a kidnapping victim. There doesn't seem to be much dispute that he was actually kidnapped; the reason we'd use "alleged" is because Devlin is innocent until proven guilty. Saying "alleged kidnapping victim" seems akin to saying "alleged stabbing victim" or something along those lines... <b><a href="../../../2E/v/2E/User%7E.V._5c4f.html" title="User:.V."><span style="color:purple">.</span><span style="color:green">V</span><span style="color:purple">.</span></a></b> <sub>[</sub><sub><a href="../../../2E/v/2E/User_talk%7E.V._d46b.html" title="User talk:.V.">Talk</a>|<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_.V._ddc5.html" title="Special:Emailuser/.V.">Email</a>]</sub> 12:33, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
