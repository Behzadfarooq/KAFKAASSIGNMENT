<p>I have tried to contribute as much as i can and time allows, it seems to me that adding info is a good idea, and to discuss deletions and removals here. Its great to see such interest in kiwi wiki articles and projects, we can benefit from positive activity, that will increase our articles content and improve the spirit of collaboration. I have to agree that more isnt always good, but when there is little to begin with, the surgeons knife is likely to cripple the patient.. its certainly an interesting experiment in a kind of democracy... thank guys, appreciate the efforts, either way, it will ultimately benefit if it all stays available here, whether its in the historic pages, or in the article itself. <a href="../../../m/o/z/User%7EMozasaur_fb9c.html" title="User:Mozasaur">moza</a><a href="../../../m/o/z/User%7EMozasaur_fb9c.html" title="User:Mozasaur">moza</a> 06:12, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The image with the police car and Ben Hana sitting on a car was recently removed from the article, but in my oppinion it should be reinserted and the blurry image to the top be removed instead.

<dd>Ok well i didnt actually 'go down to Courtenay Place..' in truth i was simply driving through as usual enjoying the rich textures.. and stopped for a red light, as I often do, and the opportunity presented itself to me. Th efull image is stunning, possibly the best content i ever got in an image, and i am up to 20,000 image s a year (last two years). I trust that Ben approves. <a href="../../../m/o/z/User%7EMozasaur_fb9c.html" title="User:Mozasaur">Mozasaur</a> 13:35, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Added a picture I shot, will keep in mind this article if I get anymore Dwayne Kirkwood 09:33, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Removed the long skinny shot again, this shot doesn't really add much as it's blurred and horribly cropped, lets leave it off for now and perhaps get some better shots if possible. Also, are two photos of Courtney place really required? Specifically the blue sky picture which doesn't really concentrate on the area at all. Dwayne Kirkwood 08:06, 25 February 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>look you may be right, but wiki is a strange place... i regard this environment as somewhat of a toy, a plaything, a learning experience, an experiment, a pathway to new knowledge of things not tried before, etc etc.. maybe in the end we are the only two people that care enough about this article, and we should find the common path to both enjoying and 'working' in it. so thanks for your adjustments, i am grateful under it all that someone finally has seen fit to add another pic. one idea i had was to take my laptop down there and collaborate with Ben to add as much as I could to the article, using cafenet, 802.11, its quite possible, even to see ourselves on the cameras above there, streamed to the web. cheers Dwayne.. on ya mate..</dd>

<dd>"One in particular, Jerry Collins, is often seen talking and mingling with Hana and others of the homeless community around Cuba and Manners Mall. Dressed in his shirt and tie he always has time to stop for a chat or spare some change, He can also be sometimes seen cruising the mean streets of Wellington in the 'Te Waka' or partaking in a friendly push up competition with fellow Manners Mall locals."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Keeping in mind that this is supposed to be encyclopedia article, this piece of text needs to be changed at the very least to example what 'Te Waka' is, and removing things like 'cruising the mean streets'.</p>
<p>Also, the two photos of Courtney Place are mostly irrelevant, and should probably be placed within it's own article rather than Ben's.</p>
<p>Finally,</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"In late 2005, coverage in the Dominion Post noted Blanket Man among a group of vagrants who are causing considerable concern for retailers and shoppers in the Cuba Mall/Manners Mall district. By December 2005, the neighbouring businesses had employed security guards in order to keep Hana and his colleagues away from his normal abode in Courtney Place."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>So - the 'vagrants' are causing trouble in Cuba and Manners Mall. So, in reply, businesses hire security guards to keep Hana away from Courtney Place? Doesn't really make much sense. Would be good if someone could pull up an article off the net on this incident, there were a few around at the time. Dwayne Kirkwood 09:33, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"In 2002 he was arrested..." "....he spent several weeks living with other vagrants on the base of the Wellington cenotaph. This abode was visible from the offices of many Members of Parliament, and before long New Zealand First leader Winston Peters complained about Hana's presence to police, saying that the vagrants were desecrating an important monument. They were subsequently moved on."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>

<p>I used to see Ben regularly (daily) sleeping on the same park bench within the grounds of Parliament Buildings before he moved down to the Cenotaph with others. This was back when he had his first leopard-skin type blanket, which at the time was in mint condition. I suspect the cronology of events in this article are not entirely accurate. Does anyone else remember seeing him sleeping on the bench there for many weeks at a time? I'm sure it must have been prior to 2002... <a href="../../../f/o/n/User%7EFonetikli_aade.html" title="User:Fonetikli">fonetikli</a> 05:19, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>What sort of amazing person is he? Looks like a homeless bum who contributes nothing. People work hard and contribute to there lives and family. A person who sits on the ground in a busy public space is what is know in the old days as the village idiot.</p>
<p>I met a guy who worship the sun once, he walked around with solar panels on his head and was always trying to call the mother ship. He dressed tidy and did not get in peoples way. Was always keen if you asked him what he was doing. In general a nice bloke. Why isn't he in the Wikipedia? Maybe it is because he lives in Patia and does not seek public attention.</p>
<p>Get rid of this Wellington nobody who does nothing but add conformity to being a bum.</p>
<p>Well done to all those people who think of him as some kind of spiritually amazing person, Your life must now be so rich in culture and your intellect must bustle with creation.</p>
<p>Get rid of him.</p>

<dd>You don't have to be an amazing person to feature on Wikipedia. Ben has an article because he's a well known figure. Yes you are correct, he is a homeless person. But this doesn't make him any less of a human being than anyone else. He's pretty much famous in Wellington, and for this reason he has a page on Wikipedia, for those looking for more information on him. Dwayne Kirkwood 04:09, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You dont have to be an amazing person to get rid of stuff, and the truly incredible thing is that we are still here adding, and thats good. Thanks to both of you, your comments stimulate discussion and thought. To the person that wants him gone, there is due process, but your chances of success are fairly remote, in my judgement. Re-read and you will see there is a fair amount of tongue in cheek, albeit dry, ie easy to fool, and why not just add something worthwhile, to substantiate your opinion. The sevens fans did their bit for promoting Ben, and that is significant and notable. I think Ben represents our precious freedom to more or less do what we want, if we are not hurting anyone. He portrays an image that provokes our thinking as to why, that makes him living art, and that is of some value to society. Who will ever know the truth? and what does that matter so much anyway, its a <i>personal</i> experience that is happening here as much as public. check out the image of 'Tribute to Ben Hana' or is it a worshipping of the sun that gives us light and fabulous images to see and share? I have a core concept of Rakiura, (mis)translated by myself as 'works of light in the land of the glowing skies'. If you think thats unrelated verbosity, you need to speak with Ben, he sees the colourful stuff in the clouds, that I record, and that most people miss on their 'busy' and 'important' daily missions. and by the way where's Patia? officially it doesnt exist, (there are 55,000+ place names, I'm a digital cartographer licensed to the crown) there is a place called Patia Point, PNT. I guess you mean Patea, but hardly anyone looking here would be able to make that quantum leap.. Its probably correct to say that most of us (including me) know very little about Ben. <a href="../../../m/o/z/User%7EMozasaur_fb9c.html" title="User:Mozasaur">moza</a> 06:13, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>- Ra - Well actually it might; as an Indengious people( known as the Mauri; recorded by the LIbrary of Alexandria in Egypt; ) to what would be modern day Libya; were known as sea navigators ( sailing as far as the isle of gold; Java to bring back gold for the Egyptians) setting out to circumnavigate the earth (at this time it was accepted in Egyptian History that the world was round; Eratosthenes:cira 276-192 b.c proved the the world was round; using rods, shadows and mathmatics ) Thus a flotilla; led by a rather conifdant chap ...

<p>I Spend alot of my time hanging out with mates on Cuba Mall/Courtney Place and i just dont see why the blanket man.Some one has bothered to write about a homeless man who wears a blanket. Well koodos to that guy but really the artical is all wrong, the blancket man is not a nice person. every time i see him he is sitting in the gutter yelling, swearing and spitting at people and when you're by yourself it can actually be quite scary. Is this the kind of person we want representing our city along with the likes of Peter Jackson??? If your going to write an article about the homeless make it the nice homeless of Welington like the bucket man who was nice and never did anything to any one. As for Ben Hana hes had enough publicity.(203.173.150.208 03:28, 4 March 2006 (UTC)).</p>

<dd>Using this logic, should we remove Hitler from Wikipedia, as Germany don't want that sort of person representing there country? Should we write just about the nice germans? Blanket Man is an icon of Wellington, and though through different eyes people think different things about him, this entry in Wikipedia isn't about 'opinion', I think this or I think that. It's a factual representation of a famous personality, without bias to his social caste. Dwayne Kirkwood 07:23, 4 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>yes agree to ojectiveness; The Blanket man was written about today in the Wellington Regional Newspaper, with photo, and is rapidly becoming nationally infamous. It's all about media news now, and that is a separate issue to the person. The sevens tribute was quite funny, and seriously creative, I look at that bunch on my desktops and smile, often. look for yourself <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:TributeToBenHana.JPG" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:TributeToBenHana.JPG" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> I dont agree with some aspects, but then I get hate email as a result of having a POV here, and demanding objectivity, some really despicable stuff, true. I think there are many symbols in this article, that kiwis relate to, maybe we need them, I am still figuring it out, so dont really know. I am more of an observer / reporter. I confess to wondering out loud, but really, dont take it too seriously until its verifiable... or thats what they tell me over and over. Ben is subject to the same law as us, and we all know that, and i'm sure we all would expect it to be upheld.

<p>The article is a bit out of control at the moment, not all the content is very relevant to the subject, and considering this is an encylopedia article it's a bit loose around the edges. I propose we remove the following sections</p>
<ul>
<li>Food For Thought</li>
<li>Locality characteristics</li>
</ul>
<p>and we combine "Poetic justice" into "History". The picture of someone's computer needs to go, and I'd still like to remove the sky picture of Courtney Place. Finally there is a typo with the date that the Wikipedia article appeared in the Newspaper. Dwayne Kirkwood 18:21, 5 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think all the pics and words work together, and I'm biased of course, but ive been thinking for myself for about 50 years, so i have good grounds for seeeing it wholistically. Good to see discussion first but i think typos could be fixed without it. its bound to be a bit loose given that its wikipedia and the subject matter. I cant see too many people taking it too seriously, but i do think that somebody could make the effort to find better pics... really i still dont understand cutting stuff. why not 'transwikify' elsewhere? whatever, you are free to do what you want here, and my experience is that if the group of editors that may swoop through at any time are like I have seen before, the whole thing will change out of recognition, or be killed dead. Less is more in some art-forms and some educational and sales situations, true; but if you par it down and just leave the references, then it's posssibly unlikely that the simplistic visitors will learn anything significant about an important aspect of our society. They will probably continue to think that we are dumb or dumber for having a site about an 'apparently' less than deserving human. My belief is that the images stimulate further thought, short sections may stimulate further reading. Really, theres not all that much to say about the subject now, is there. But look, feel free, whatever you dont like out there could be moved in here just to keep it intact, until it can go somewhere else. How about a wiki page like Wellington_Attitudes or Kiwi_Attitudes etc... Hey!! I want to acknowledge that at least someone cares about how this article should be, and I'm prepared to appreciate, support, and trust that. So thanks Dwayne. I'm still confused as to why a lot of editors have been so vicous with their character assinations, and apparently not read or cared about Jimmy Wales concept of less focus on credentials, more on what they do and have done. There is another wiki type encyclopedia in the mill for scholars to be peered by peers. Let them go there. How about everyone is equal as a foundation for action. The head of wikipedia has a lot of interesting stuff to say on anti-eliteism and what he envisages as a flatter community. You gonna start an article on Courtenay Place? I'm moving out of the city over the next few weeks, and I doubt if i'll ever be back, and its of not much importance, kind of like watching tv, only interactive. <a href="../../../m/o/z/User%7EMozasaur_fb9c.html" title="User:Mozasaur">moza</a> 10:25, 6 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>saw the new pic, like it, nice and sharp. someone fixed the date, cool. I ask again, can someone go and discuss Bens ideas about what is said in his article? I think that might be the key to a really good article, before we strip it of value. The sun and sky played an amazing cloud opera on Sunday the 5th of April, did anyone else witness that? Does Ben really worship the sun, or the sky, or anything? does anyone actually KNOW? and where do you propose i relocate the desktop pic? to an article called Fans_of_Ben_Hana? tell ya what, I'll change the heading. Looks like I'm going to create my own web site about Ben, to cover the important issues that he stimulates us into thinking about. what could be more important than the re-structuring of society for long term survival of the planet?

<dd>well i thought that if you wanted to know about a human subject such as Ben Hana, then knowing about his chosen location would assist in some way. It could be simply that there is a high percentage of pedestrian traffic of people with food and money in their hands and pockets, both locals and tourists. There are plenty of buskers around and some beggars. The buildings indicate shelter from the harsh environment. Its cold and often wet and extremely windy outside of that shelter belt. The concrete and tarseal store the days heat and moderate the evening temperatures, that plummet in the open. My point is that while we are not supposed to say that stuff out there in the article, its the best way to build it. let someone else go and collect the data, its easily available. The sociology discussion isabout Bens human location, the attributes of the people around him, what they think. Again, there is little hard data, and that article may stimulate someone into collection. That he has fans, is probably saving his wiki article from deletion, coupled with the documentary. The pics are intended to illustrate those concepts. The fan pic is quite awesome, but someone has to sort the copyright and get it submitted. In the meantime the desktop pic will do.

The artwork is a tribute to Ben and the locality, culture, setting etc.. given with un-conditional love guys. so tear it up or value it for what it has to say, your choice.

<p>Before Ben became a feature of Wellington he resided in front of the court house in Tokoroa. I remember he caused some controversey with memebers of the town wanting him to move on. He carried a bible with him and if I recall correctly used to preach, he also used to wear his tattered pants (mentioned in the article) then. I think he was in Tokoroa around 1999-2000 possibly even 2001. It would be interesting if someone could dig up any articles of the South Waikato News, Tokoroa's local rag. It would be helpful to search Newstext which is available to University students on the database. Looking through the newspapers from this time, which should be available at the National library in Wellington. It would be iteresting to see where Ben came from and where he visited before he came to Wellington. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 203.184.12.13 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_203.184.12.13_0fa1.html" title="Special:Contributions/203.184.12.13">contribs</a>) 05:59, 11 March 2006 (UTC).</small></p>

Ben seems to have gotten a new blanket. I would add this to the article but i'm annoyed it's out of focus. If no one else manages to shoot anything soon and he remains with this blanket, I suggest we use this. Also to note is that this is on Manners/Willis corner, he was off somewhere, but I didn't bother following him. Dwayne Kirkwood 01:46, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>any chance of some discussion prior to removal of material? when I first arrived at this page it was almost not an article, a long paragraph. Since building it into something at least apppearing to be an article, it has been hijacked and messed with to the state where it no longer contains lots of information that I consider important to it. There's almost nothing about Bens Fans for instance. There's still no image of his immediate environment, and anybody that dares add stuff may as well not bother. This article hardly has any verifiable references, and really needs to be allowed to mature by following the normal international wiki procedure of discussion PRIOR to surgery.Its called good faith. <a href="../../../m/o/z/User%7EMozasaur_fb9c.html" title="User:Mozasaur">moza</a> 02:12, 26 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Ben and the existence of his world-wide notability says more about us than about him. How about a piece in his article covering that aspect, perhaps written by a respected artist or sociologist, whatever.</p>

<p>He <b>is a living art installation</b>, whether we like it or not. Another famous kiwi artist, <a href="../../../l/e/n/Len_Lye_1bdb.html" title="Len Lye">Len Lye</a>, did some pretty objectional things, to mainstream society thinking, in Edinborough, funded by art. I dont think that you have to conciously be an artist to be one. Yet another famous Kiwi artist recently said to his artist daughter, "Art is what it is". (well thats what she told me). In the meantime I have created a web page that collects the relevant points that I think are important to make about Ben, in an eclectic, non-peered manner, in an place that no-one can edit ever, except me.</p>

<p>It may be of interest to some of you, to see some of the visitor data to Bens web sites,it certainly was enough to me to pursue this.

<p>You can see a chart of Bens web presence near the bottom of the Fan site. I am manually searching periodically and tracking the results. I expect the Fan page to appear in the results somewhere between 3 and 14 days from the creation of the page. Whether you agree with what I'm doing or not, whether you have any understanding or not, you can still choose to allow this process time to develop and give the sociologists some hard data to work with. This is about an incredibly interesting set of circumstances in our society. That table also provides a quick reference to other websites that refer to Ben Hana. I'm happy for any of my contributions to be copied to wiki, apart from the single image labelled as such, but past experience is that sociology is unwanted on his site, and removed, so now you all have access anyway. <a href="../../../m/o/z/User%7EMozasaur_fb9c.html" title="User:Mozasaur">moza</a> 03:27, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Could be the best thing that happened to this article, but I havent observed the process so simply dont know.

<li>My comments:
<ul>
<li>The lead is too short, remember that it should summarize the rest of the content.</li>
<li>Does anyone now his age or birth date?</li>
<li>Specially in the history I noticed that the grammar could be improved, unfortunately, mine is not very good either. Someone else could probably check the writing.</li>
<li>Try not to place one image after another, because that causes the edit buttons to be placed incorrectly near the bottom (at least in <a href="../../../f/i/r/Firefox.html" title="Firefox">Firefox</a>). Instead, place the images individually in each section. You could place some in the left side too.</li>
<li>References seemed to stop after the sociology section. Also, using the <a href="../../../f/o/o/Wikipedia%7EFootnotes_5088.html" title="Wikipedia:Footnotes">&lt;references/&gt;</a> tool would be better, though not necessary.</li>
<li>I'm not 100% positive about this, but is it a good idea to talk about that Wikipedia article in the Wikipedia article?</li>
