<p>I saw your change to <a href="../../../p/e/a/Peak_oil_theory.html" title="Peak oil theory">peak oil theory</a>, and while, as you say, "Peak oil is the general theory - Hubbert's theory is his own work", I don't understand why you copied the contents of <a href="../../../h/u/b/Hubbert_peak_theory.html" title="Hubbert peak theory">Hubbert peak theory</a> into the article. I have restored the redirect. If you want to contribute a new article on peak oil theory that is different from Hubbert peak theory, I'm all for it, but I don't find the duplication really useful. --<a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimc_6767.html" title="User:Timc">timc</a>&#160;|&#160;<a href="../../../t/i/m/User_talk%7ETimc_362b.html" title="User talk:Timc">Talk</a> 03:04, 2 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think that the current article contains both the general and the specific theory - My intent would have been to excise the Hubbert specific paragraphs - but see Talk:Hubberts peak oil theres a consensus afoot to accomplish this, so 'i've let that run its course - let's see where we are in a few. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenjamin_Gatti_fee8.html" title="User:Benjamin Gatti">Benjamin Gatti</a></dd>

<p>Hi Benjamin. I felt I should drop you a note personality to explain why I reverted your edit to <a href="../../../h/u/b/Hubbert_peak_theory.html" title="Hubbert peak theory">Hubbert peak theory</a>; I see you've been through a similar discussion before. I understand where you're coming from; when I first got here, the article was just called "Hubbert peak"—I really wanted to restrict it to just Hubbert's work and make a new page for "Peak oil". A arguably disruptive user preventive any move at the time, and since then the compromise of "Hubbert peak theory" has been reached. As Timc says above, there's no problem with splitting the article into two, but it's such a heavily edited article that it might be best to find a consensus on the talk page before going ahead with it.</p>
<p>On a different note, I noticed on your user page that you're interested in renewable technologies. One of my pet projects of late has been working on launching a sustainable technologies wikiproject. I've yet to get enough support to make it worthwhile, but <a href="../../../j/w/a/User%7EJwanders_Sustainable_technologies_7b97.html" title="User:Jwanders/Sustainable technologies">check it out</a> if you think you might be interested.—<a href="../../../j/w/a/User%7EJwanders_e4e6.html" title="User:Jwanders">Jwanders</a><sup><small><a href="../../../j/w/a/User_talk%7EJwanders_e394.html" title="User talk:Jwanders">Talk</a></small></sup> <a href="../../../1/_/_/1.html" title="1"></a> 21:13, 13 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>It does appear to be his strong suit, and he appears to prefer playing golf to leading the nation in times of crisis - his other job. I think the Edit is accurate, factual and neutral. His commitment to golf is second to nothing - including his county in its time of need. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenjamin_Gatti_fee8.html" title="User:Benjamin Gatti">Benjamin Gatti</a></p>

<dd>Given that the english language lacks perjoratives capable of adequately describing Michael D. Brown, I can hardly see how vandalism could occur on that page. Even blanking could be described as an oriental form of appropriate sanctions.

<dd>The prior state in which "looting" is renamed "stealing" with images of Africans distributing stores of food to starving villagers was perverse and a POV shared only by the most ignorant, self-righteous, and ironcally members of groups which have most benefitted by the "looting" of Africa for free labor. If you wish to engage in a dialogue to find a workable neutral ground - you would do more good to edit first and criticize last. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenjamin_Gatti_fee8.html" title="User:Benjamin Gatti">Benjamin Gatti</a></dd>

<dd>I edit first because one of Wikipedia main strengths is its struggle for NPOV. Your statements can contain useful informations, but they're a quite particular POV. What it should be done is to present facts according to common definitions (and by common definitions, looting <b>is</b> technically theft, somehow). If you feel there's another POV worth to be presented, you can add a section of the article and expose this POV by writing "By some looting is considered..." with clear external references and so on, and stating cleary this is just a (respectable) POV, not dogma.</dd>

<dd>If you don't agree with Wikipedia NPOV policy, you can consider joining <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikinfo.html" title="Wikinfo">Wikinfo</a>. Wikinfo's policy on point of view is different from Wikipedia: rather than adopting a neutral point of view, the set of articles about a particular topic are split into a number of articles with a specified point of view—thus it tries to have several points of view on each topic. The main article is written from a sympathetic point of view which is described as "a way of encouraging a pluralism of content, rather than limiting content to an unattainable encyclopedic goal."</dd>

<dd>I believe you are simply out of touch with reality. MSNBC has gathered a plurality of experts on ethics to discuss this issue, and not one of them has asserted that "looting" is one and the same as theft. It is always the suspension of commerce denominated in liquid currency, it can be done morally or immorally - and in this respect has much in common with other forms of redistribution. capitalism, communism, and totalitarianism all have a range of moral implications - and should probably be judged on a case-by-case basis where a moral determination is to be made. Theft is no such animal. theft is a perjorative term exclusively used to prejudice a transaction as violate. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenjamin_Gatti_fee8.html" title="User:Benjamin Gatti">Benjamin Gatti</a></dd>

<p>Benjamin, I've reported you for a violation of 3RR. Not only have you violated 3RR, but your additions have been rejected by three editors (so far), meaning you're also violating consensus. Please stop. · <a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKatefan0_967f.html" title="User:Katefan0"><b>Katefan0</b></a><sup><a href="../../../k/a/t/User_talk%7EKatefan0_4566.html" title="User talk:Katefan0">(scribble)</a></sup> 20:53, September 11, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'd be surprised if I violated 3RR - but if i did , then i deserve the consequences. In the meantime consensus, when it rejects cited alternative facts which are relevent without discussion is not inspiring. I wish the other editors would back up the baloney they are protecting with citations. To the extent that has not happened, editing has not been in good faith. IMO. good luck on your 3RR. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenjamin_Gatti_fee8.html" title="User:Benjamin Gatti">Benjamin Gatti</a>
<dl>
<dd>I reviewed it and it doesn't look like you have violated 3RR... the report was rather confusing as Katefan0 listed on of his/her reverts as one towards your 3RR... anyways, just saying that you haven't done anything wrong though try not to engage in edit wars... as a general rule of thumb, use the one revert rule. <b><a href="../../../s/a/s/User%7ESasquatch_97db.html" title="User:Sasquatch"><font color="#89CF19">Sasquatch</font></a></b><span style="background-color:#C1FF5F"><a href="../../../s/a/s/User_talk%7ESasquatch_36e0.html" title="User talk:Sasquatch">t</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Sasquatch_3b68.html" title="Special:Contributions/Sasquatch">c</a></span></dd>

<p>Hey there - on Sept 3 you placed a paragraph on the Accident article essentially arguing that Chernobyl wasn't an accident (but an 'incident'). I have removed this paragraph as I think it is very clear that Chernobyl was an accident as defined in the article. I felt it fair to let you know about that. Now I have just noticed in the Nuclear Power article that you refer on Sept 1 to "a sever nuclear accident such as occurred at Chernobyl." Isn't that a bit of a contradiction? Two days and an accident becomes a non-accident "incident"? <a href="../../../p/p/e/User%7EPpe42_7a69.html" title="User:Ppe42">Ppe42</a> 05:27, 26 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I would argue that what occurred at Chernobyl was not an accident - as in an unforeseeable result driven by random inconsistency between engineering expectations and reality. It was in fact the predicted result of the actions taken, which is why the rules specifically indicated that those actions were impermissible. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenjamin_Gatti_fee8.html" title="User:Benjamin Gatti">Benjamin Gatti</a></p>
<p>An <a href="../../../a/c/c/Accident.html" title="Accident">accident</a> is defined as <i>something going wrong unexpectedly</i>, where the event was unforeseeable or very unlikely. Given perfect information, the Chernobyl operators might have foreseen or expected things to go terribly wrong. However, they lacked engineering knowledge of the reactor's design flaws (possibly because said flaws were covered up). There are several reasons why everything went wrong; but the sum total is that the experiment was designed to <i>increase</i> the safety of the reactor (by improving the safety systems). The operators did not expect things to go wrong in the way they did, and therefore it was an accident. This is consensus: the article is labelled <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chernobyl_Accident_a469.html" title="Chernobyl Accident">Chernobyl Accident</a> and described as the most important example of a <a href="../../../n/u/c/Nuclear_accident.html" title="Nuclear accident">nuclear accident</a>. <a href="../../../p/p/e/User%7EPpe42_7a69.html" title="User:Ppe42">Ppe42</a> 02:26, 27 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As if by an overwhelming majority, the editors of wikipedia could declare that the moon is made of cheese. Consensus - in itself - is unpersuasive. The facts uncontested are that the rules required a given number of control rods remain out at all times, and in short that while they did not foresee the effect of breaking the rules, they did in fact foresee that their actions were a violation of the rules. Further that had they followed the rules (as they both knew and understood them), the incident would not have happened. Anyone who builds a nuclear reactor must understand that everything can go very wrong. A nuclear reactor is an atom bomb balanced precariously between doing nothing, and taking out an entire city. Children at age 8 understand this. The idea that reactor operators are unaware of the game they are playing is fanciful at best. In reality, Chernobyl was the intrusion of the politically powerful into the sanctity of the scientifically informed. The Operators were aware of the danger, but overruled by ambitious political superiors. Such is not an accident. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenjamin_Gatti_fee8.html" title="User:Benjamin Gatti">Benjamin Gatti</a></dd>

<dd>I think you overstate the case, my friend. The vast majority of nuclear reactor designs are utterly incapable of producing a thermonuclear explosion; at most, a core meltdown and steam explosion could cause the leakage of some radioactive material. The idea of nuclear reactors suddenly, disastrously exploding and "taking out an entire city" may indeed be believable to an eight year old, but you are a grown man. I guess we'll just have to agree to disagree about what constitutes an accident. <a href="../../../p/p/e/User%7EPpe42_7a69.html" title="User:Ppe42">Ppe42</a> 04:49, 27 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>in 1987, 1200 people lived in Chernobyl, today all residents have been evacuated. Just explain this. Why is in impossible for all the insurance companies in the world to privately insure even a single nuclear plant? - That is the argument behind the Price Anderson suspension of liability protections. If you really believe tat nuclear energy is safe - tell me were I can purchase adequate private insurance to operate a nuclear plant. I'll wait.

The reason for insurance is that the insurance is affordable while the accident, would it happen immediately, is not. At the time, insurance companies wouldn't be able to cover these costs either, thus they were legally prohibited to insure the accident. Another reason could be they were not competent to evaluate neither possibility or cost of extreme accidents. Thus the state took responsibility for the insurance costs. The insurance fee would actually be very low, had the US chosen to collect it. In other countries, the state DO require insurance payment.--<a href="../../../s/i/n/User%7ESinus_1085.html" title="User:Sinus">Sinus</a> 10:22, 1 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Honestly, I think the best thing for you to do would have been to raise the question on RFPP. You can still do that. And we can have one of the uninvolved admins there like Jossifresco, Tony Sidaway, or Thryduulf look at it. What I don't get is that even if it was an honest misunderstanding on my part, nad there shouldn't have been protection, the answer is to <i>fix</i> that, not arbitration. I'm perplexed by your actions, because I'd like to think that if you had <i>asked</i> me I would have been able to explain myself to your satisfaction. <a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a>·<a href="../../../d/m/c/User_talk%7EDmcdevit_b359.html" title="User talk:Dmcdevit">t</a> 23:19, 7 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This is far more about the idea of Protecting an article in order to effect censorship than it is about any one individuals actions or behavior. This is not the first time the Page was protected without just or given cause, and the issue has already been mediated twice.

<dd>You said in the arbitration that I knew you disagreed. But, honestly, I didn't and I wonder why you feel that way. If you had left me a note, I would have looked at it again. If you had made a request for unprotection, someone else would have looked at it again. I'm still not clear as to what your objection is. I think it's either that the page was protected on one version and not the other (it is policy to make no preference but to leave it where it was at protection time), that you think there wasn't an edit war going on or not one severe enough to warrant protection, or whether you disagree with the principle of protecting during edit wars? The fact is that page protection is one of the processes I'm most intimately involved in here on Wikipedia, and I take it very seriously. I reject probably 80% of the requests of RFPP, and believe very strongly that protection is harmful. Please help me understand your position. <a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a>·<a href="../../../d/m/c/User_talk%7EDmcdevit_b359.html" title="User talk:Dmcdevit">t</a> 05:35, 8 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Dear Dmcdevit, I wonder if you paged through the fifteen edits by six different people on Dec 5 before jumping to the conclusion that an unreasonable edit-war was going on? I wonder if you realize that the <i>only</i> editor involved in unexplained reverts was the same Woohoo who requested the censorship? I wonder if you care about the edit war policy which clearly separates <i>interested parties</i> from <i>users</i> and states only that the later may request protection? There wasn't an edit-war at all, there was a community process of editing an divisive issue. I would suggest that you could name the issues which the Supreme Court has disagreed with the appellate courts on a single hand - this is one of them, and it is unreasonable to presume stability as normative. There are no personal attacks, the debate is wide open and yet both respectful and productive (mediation has not helped much). The arguments are heavily sourced. This is a work in progress, and you have poured cold water on it - at the behest of one of the more opinionated and less informed editors. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenjamin_Gatti_fee8.html" title="User:Benjamin Gatti">Benjamin Gatti</a> 05:53, 8 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Unfortunatley, I think you misread the protection policy. It doesn't matter who requests protection, and in fact there doesn't even need to be a request in practice, just admin discretion. It could be a party or an anon, because, the truth is, other than a little background, I don't much care what the requester says, but I go look at the article's recent history myself. This is not "<a href="../../../c/e/n/Censorship.html" title="Censorship">censorship</a>" and that kind of language is just inflammatory. This is just a temporary cool-down, while saying "censorship" implies malice (and <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">asumes bad faith</a>). I did nothing at the behest of anyone, but because of my own determination of edit warring. I counted 15 <i>reverts</i>, not just edits (&gt;20 edits) in 24 hours. I consider that serious enough to warrant protection. If you disagree, please make a ]]WP:RFPP#Current_requests_for_unprotection|request for unprotection]] so we can get a neutral admin to look at it. <a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a>·<a href="../../../d/m/c/User_talk%7EDmcdevit_b359.html" title="User talk:Dmcdevit">t</a> 06:14, 8 December 2005 (UTC)

<p>The place to ask for unprotection is <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_protection_2397.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for protection">Wikipedia:Requests for protection</a>. It's not the arbcom page. "Mike, because I am arguing that interested parties should not initiate page protection". Um Ben? That's how almost all requests for protection work. It's almost always someone working on the article who is asking for protection to stop an edit war or vandalism or whatever. I used the correct process to a T. I'm an admin, but instead of protecting it myself, I asked for protection on the requests for protection page. The admins who patrol that page actually turn down more than 50% of the requests. Dmcdevit turns down probably 80%. But he saw a major revert war going on and decided to stop it via protection. What you did was against policy because it belongs on RfP or ANI NOT Arbcom.

<p>For the comments on User:Fluterst. As I've said before, what amuses me is that I have a liberal type (you) telling me how pro-nuclear I'm making P-A but at the same time I have these conservatives (Fluterst is the latest in a long line that includes BigDaddy777 and Rex) who are convinced that I am part of this liberal cabal trying to "rule" Wikipedia. I'm actually neither. Anyway, this website he sites is full of crap. Completely full of crap. Wikipedia is a completely non profit company (even Jimbo takes no salary) which actually does a good job of keeping crap off of the site given it's open nature. A lawsuit would be pointless. Wikimedia's budget for this year is all of 700 grand and literally all of it goes into infrastructure. It would just be pointless to sue Wikipedia or Wikimedia. Anyway, thanks for the comments. At the moment, I'm trying to avoid all NPOV stuff, so I'm going to leave him alone for now but I have a feeling we'll cross paths soon. --<a href="../../../w/o/o/User%7EWoohookitty_27d9.html" title="User:Woohookitty"><i>Woohookitty</i></a><sup><a href="../../../w/o/o/User_talk%7EWoohookitty_9ae9.html" title="User talk:Woohookitty">(cat scratches)</a></sup> 23:29, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm not convinced that Wikipedia is as worthless as you propose, though in no way does an increase in worth significantly increase its culpability - unless and this is probably where you're going - WP directly benefits from the publishing of BS, and therefore is motivated to encourage its users to contribute BS - neither of which is even remotely the case so far as I know. I hardly think of myself as a liberal - which in the end suggests that such terms may have outlived their utility.

<p>Look at the DeeCeeVoice case - you'll see it can work. There are better ways to avoid edit wars (like growing up for example) than trying to respond to personal attacks in a parallel universe. The Long established practice for such is to respond to each witness at the end of their evidence. I haven't see a good reason for that recommendation. I think it defies logic and creates an atmosphere in which ridiculous accusations go unanswered - in fact, I reject that format out of hand. (speaking of rules - what about the rule that says one should file an RfC and an RfM before filing an RfArb? - ah I see, shoe on other foot, now rules are made to be broken.

<dd>I think you misunderstand the purpose of my comment. This is not a debate, nor am I asking for your input as to how we should format arbcom evidence pages. I am telling you that if you want that evidence introduced, you will follow the format as we have layed it out, or the evidence you have introduced will be summarily deleted without being considered. <a href="../../../r/a/u/User%7ERaul654_54a3.html" title="User:Raul654">Raul654</a> 21:26, 2 January 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I think you also misunderstand. If a person <i>wants</i> to enjoy the privilege of "no response to evidence" than '<i>that</i> person must confine their rants to evidence and evidence alone - as soon as one inserts conclusorary statements or <i>analysis</i> of the evidence <i>into</i> the evidence section, then in my book, it becomes a legitimate target for response in-line. This isn't negotiable. If the Arb wishes to ban people for defending themselves when and where they are attacked; that is their choice and pleasure - and I would sooner give them that option, than leave conclusory statements undefended. What about that do you fail to understand? If WP is to become a place for taking indefensible pot-shots at individuals, I wish it good day and good riddance. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenjamin_Gatti_fee8.html" title="User:Benjamin Gatti">Benjamin Gatti</a> 22:14, 2 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Agreed - but you will agree that an "Evidence" Section ceases to be an "Evidence" section when argument, accusation, or analysis enter the picture. The safe harbor extends only to evidence.

<dd>Mostly it's not personal because it doesn't include your name. If you want to go write mother goose rhymes which make fun of me - that's not personal unless you use my name. All of the laws at Raul's place are inspired by people's behaviour, in that sense they are all personal, but they are not personal attacks. Notice how seldom I use editor's names when making complaints (read the ArbCom evidence for example.) Note the rules (which you so glibbly ignore, require that you posit and RfC and an RfM before going to Arbom - where is your RfM? - Wikilawyering!.

<p>To be clear, I have <i>never</i> accused you of "blackmail." I stated that your statements were "threatening," or something to that effect, (I'm sure there's some kind of important distinction between the two, but at the moment I don't feel like pondering it and "blackmail" is quite a severe word). Truth is, I don't care much whether you reveal the emails (which I've never seen) or not, but what concerns me is that you felt the need to mention it beforehend, especially the "You've still got time" typr of comment. To me, either you should have done it because you felt it was necessary, or not because you felt it was improper, but to do otherwise, to entertain the <i>possibility</i> of either based on a behavior change in Woohookitty, strikes me as unnecessary and even threatening. If you look at my comment though, I didn't say I support the FoF, since I think that was relatively minor. I can also assure you that ArbCom most likely won't touch it either. I've seen you characterize this arbitration as mudslinging, but I want you to know that's not what I, at least, am doing at all. It's understandable that having evidence presented against you is disconcerting, but I think there is genuinely a problem, and, to be sure, none of my comments on that page have ever reached the level of personal comments about you, but commentary on your editing. I don't think it's "mudslinging." In fact, the ultimate irony here, for me, is that we probably have similar real-world POVs (I disdain talking politics on Wikipedia, but let's just say I was a Green party volunteer for the last election, which is not easy in red Arizona), but I'm fairly certain you wouldn't know it by my article edits. <a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a>·<a href="../../../d/m/c/User_talk%7EDmcdevit_b359.html" title="User talk:Dmcdevit">t</a> 07:28, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The decision to go the way of a mud sling has been made by the others. Case in point, pretending that edits were personal attacks when they quite obviously weren't anything of the kind. Yes - I am making an effort to correct a systemic bias in favor of false statements regarding renewable energy, but in <a href="../../../p/e/a/Peak_oil.html" title="Peak oil">Peak oil</a> my edits would be interpreted as correcting an opposite bias - by arguing that nuclear power could lessen the impact of less cheap oil (much as I would hope for a cleaner option). Giving the opposition time to avoid a mud sling by refusing to throw mud, even when you could, is not a threat. Someday you will have the experience to understand this - I promise you that. In the meantime, be more cautious about making unfounded accusations. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenjamin_Gatti_fee8.html" title="User:Benjamin Gatti">Benjamin Gatti</a> 08:03, 9 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>A mudsling is just that - a prurient exercise in mutual tarnishing - my offer was an invitation to deescalate the personal horsepucky and focus on the meaningful differences. It was a stick and carrot offer, and perfectly fair. You should notice that I stayed out of the personal mudslinging. I in fact threw no mud whatsoever. And I had enough mud to get the complainant de-admined. I have no interest in such. I am however interested in the content dispute - and while I was uninviting Mike from the mudsling, I was in no way asking him not to participate - only to channel his participation on the subject matter rather than the personal. Your failure to separate the two draws into some question your ability to follow a mature dialogue, so I'll leave it at that. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenjamin_Gatti_fee8.html" title="User:Benjamin Gatti">Benjamin Gatti</a> 02:02, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yeah - well it has been predicted by the application of simple game theory to the free-ridership vulnerabilities created by Price Anderson.

<p>The probations don't contradict each other because they are 2 different types of probation, Ben. General probation is to stop general disruptive edits. So if there is a pattern of edits across several articles that 3 admins say are disruptive, you can be banned for short periods. The other one is less severe though all it needs is one admin, not 3. It only blocks you from any particular article that you are being disruptive at. So there are 2 different probations. If the pattern used for zen is any indication, the blocks from articles typically last for a week or two, though that can vary. The general bans usually start at 24 hours. And before you complain, kate and I have no intentions of using our powers just like we haven't used them from the start. Any banning or blocking requests will be made at WP:AN or WP:AN/I. --<a href="../../../w/o/o/User%7EWoohookitty_27d9.html" title="User:Woohookitty"><i>Woohookitty</i></a><sup><a href="../../../w/o/o/User_talk%7EWoohookitty_9ae9.html" title="User talk:Woohookitty">(cat scratches)</a></sup> 05:36, 7 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Arbcom is law around these parts, whether you agree with their decision or not. So. If you violate the terms of your probation, you will be blocked from articles or worse. And actually, the rules are not made up as they go along. Your case was very similar to other POV pusher cases brought to the ArbCom. Probation and/or general probation are the usual remedies for that along with a short ban but you didn't get that. You are being given another chance here, Ben. That's why you only got probation. I would suggest accepting the punishment and trying to change your tactics on here. Otherwise, you will be blocked from articles and/or banned from the site for short periods.

<dd>It hardly matters - My disappointment with the Arbcom has to do with competence, not outcome. I would have been more inspired by a lifetime ban with really solid logic, instead the Arbcom failed to engage or instruct on the core issues. Sure, I'll avoid the .01% of edits which are controversial and stick to straight ahead edits (like Ed), and what is better - find more productive venues for my time: I've already taken up micro-controller engineering, and built a model of my wave device. I have no complaints or regrets, and I stand behind every edit.

<dd>Thanks for the armchair diagnosis, and after giving it a fair hearing, it doesn't fit. My personal view of psychosis is that in the simplest sense, we are not a mutually sane species - an uncomfortable fact which we are more inclined to ignore than to confront. Subjects which are taboo are such because the tend to expose the the incompatibility of any three people to share common ground. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenjamin_Gatti_fee8.html" title="User:Benjamin Gatti">Benjamin Gatti</a> 01:20, 9 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>No one diagnosed you, no one mentioned psychosis, and psychosis is not known to be related to PAPD. Some personality disorders are more prone to psychosis than others, particularly the Cluster A (odd, eccentric) personality disorders. PAPD is a Cluster C (anxiety) personality disorder. Personality disorders are rarely self-diagnosable since they are all ego-syntonic (compatible-with or acceptable-to the ego; "i.e., these individuals do not particularly see anything wrong with their personality. In treatment, they usually want relief from anxiety or depression. They do not seek help for character-related issues. [...] Personality-disordered individuals have difficulty imagining being any other way. Their problems are synonymous with their identities. To change may feel like virtual personal annihilation."<a href="http://www.toad.net/~arcturus/dd/pdsa.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.toad.net/~arcturus/dd/pdsa.htm" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>). --<a href="../../../h/i/t/User%7EHitssquad_f0af.html" title="User:Hitssquad">hitssquad</a> 02:05, 9 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>My guess is that given the chance you would diagnose each of the founding fathers as PAPD for having a profound distrust of totalitarian regimes. I would also suggest that you could construct a religion out of the same logic as above. In other words - the great unknowable "eco-syntonic" fact could serve as a foundation for emotional dependency, from which a mountain of irrational trust may grow. Intelligence alone will produce the symptoms of many so-called "personality disorders". Personally, I find refuge and companionship in the logic of the best minds (ie read a Supreme Court opinion some time) and I am disheartened by the pablum of pedestrian minds (ie read a different Supreme court opinion (Bush v. Gore is a good start). Such is undoubtedly equivalent to a personality disorder while in the company of the latter, but is conducive to pleasurable communication amongst the former. If we fail to connect in a mutually rational plane, it doesn't mean that one of us is insane, it only means that we don't share a compatible rational framework - a lot of people don't. So we move on, peaceable if possible. A note for separating incompatible logic from "disorders": Incompatible frameworks define a community of people which can intercommunicate, "Disorders" are by constitution isolating, and do not accumulate "adherents" but lead to increased isolation. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenjamin_Gatti_fee8.html" title="User:Benjamin Gatti">Benjamin Gatti</a> 02:54, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Perhaps you forget the fourteen words in the previous State of the Union - which were subsequently retracted as false. I suggest that these four words are quite clearly fictitious, and deserving of similar scrutiny. Were we to build such a device, and were it to explode ala Chernobyl, then this lie would be equal in magnitude to the 14 words. A Lie in a SOTU speech is in my opinion a topic.

<dd>You silly person, I don't disagree with what you wrote. It was just blatantly non-encyclopedic. I think documenting what the president says is extremely important, and pointing out when he's inconsistent or dishonest. Putting your documentation in a Wikipedia article called Clean and safe nuclear energy]] is the wrong way to go about it, though. First of all, it wasn't an article about clean and safe nuclear energy, it was an article about something said in Bush's SOTU address. Why not add information to the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006_State_of_the_Union_address_fcba.html" title="2006 State of the Union address">article on that</a>?

<p>Hi! As a contributor to WikiProject Energy development, I thought you might like to be aware of the opportunity to contribute to the new <a href="../../../e/n/e/Portal%7EEnergy_92fe.html" title="Portal:Energy">Energy Portal</a>, now that there is one...

<p>Hi Ben,</p>
<p>While roving around Wikipedia, I found your user page and the link to <a href="http://www.windwavesandsun.com" class="external text" title="http://www.windwavesandsun.com" rel="nofollow">your site</a> on wave energy generation. I thought you might want to take a look at an elegant concept design named "Wave Garden" by Japanese architect Yusuke Obuchi. I originally learned about the project two and a half years ago from <a href="http://www.kottke.org/04/06/wave-garden-obuchi" class="external text" title="http://www.kottke.org/04/06/wave-garden-obuchi" rel="nofollow">this post</a> by well-known blogger <a href="../../../j/a/s/Jason_Kottke_1894.html" title="Jason Kottke">Jason Kottke</a>. It appears that the original link to the project's page in his post is dead, but I dug up <a href="http://pruned.blogspot.com/2005/06/wave-garden-by-yusuke-obuchi.html" class="external text" title="http://pruned.blogspot.com/2005/06/wave-garden-by-yusuke-obuchi.html" rel="nofollow">this page</a> which provides a few details and some computer-generated sketches, not entirely disimilar to those illustrating your "WaveBlanket" concept. Hope you find this interesting!</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Jordan</p>

<p>Hi! Over the past couple of months I've been spending much more time than I should developing the <a href="../../../e/n/e/Portal%7EEnergy_92fe.html" title="Portal:Energy">Energy portal</a>, and intend asking for a <a href="../../../p/o/r/Wikipedia%7EPortal_peer_review_9ac7.html" title="Wikipedia:Portal peer review">portal peer review</a> within the next day or so.<br />
<br />
The portal provides a showcase for energy-related articles on Wikipedia. One of the most prominent ways is via a the <a href="../../../e/n/e/Portal%7EEnergy_92fe.html#Selected_article" title="Portal:Energy">selected article</a> that is currently changed every 6 weeks or so. It would be good to increase this turnover, and with three Wikiprojects dedicated to energy-related topics and a good number of articles already written, I'd like to suggest that members of each Wikiproject might like to use the 'selected article' to feature some of their best work.<br />
<br />
With this in mind, I'd like to suggest that your Wikiproject bypasses the normal <a href="../../../e/n/e/Portal_talk%7EEnergy_Selected_article_a386.html#Nominations_for_.27selected_article.27" title="Portal talk:Energy/Selected article">selected article nomination page</a> and decides collectively which articles are worth featuring - or these may be self-evident from previous discussions - and add short 'introduction' to the selected article at the appropriate place on page <a href="../../../e/n/e/Portal%7EEnergy_Selected_article_Drafts_506b.html" title="Portal:Energy/Selected article/Drafts">Portal:Energy/Selected article/Drafts</a>, which includes further information. Your personal involvement would be welcome!<br />
<br />
Please make any comments on your Wikiproject talk page, <a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGralo_c4bf.html" title="User talk:Gralo">my talk page</a>, or on <a href="../../../e/n/e/Portal_talk%7EEnergy_Selected_article_Drafts_3d9a.html" title="Portal talk:Energy/Selected article/Drafts">Portal talk:Energy/Selected article/Drafts</a>, as appropriate. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGralo_8037.html" title="User:Gralo">Gralo</a> 15:31, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
