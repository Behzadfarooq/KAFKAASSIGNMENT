<h2><span class="mw-headline">CIFAL</span></h2>
<p>I have no idea what "CIFAL" refers to or what exact failings I pointed out. You are going to have to show me.--<a href="../../../r/m/k/User%7ERmky87_07f5.html" title="User:Rmky87">Rmky87</a> 19:53, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I reviewed the <a href="../../../c/i/f/CIFAL_ecc1.html" title="CIFAL">CIFAL</a> page, and the changes look good, thank you. In answer to your questions, <a href="../../../a/w/b/WP%7EAWB_c695.html" title="WP:AWB">AWB</a> is an "AutoWikiBrowser" tool which I use to do semi-automated scans through new Wikipedia pages, looking for those which are missing essential elements (such as categories), so that I can place tags on them. The tags either alert the original author of an article that changes are required, or, if the original author is unable or unwilling to make the change, it also puts the articles into a category or queue, so that other Wikipedians can eventually make the necessary modifications. The date changes that Rmky87 made were not significant -- they were administrative only, as he's in a different timezone than I am, and he was keeping things tidy for another list elsewhere on Wikipedia that he's personally interested in. &#160;;) In terms of edits to the CIFAL page, the next thing I would ask you to concentrate on, would be supplying references that confirm notability via outside sources, and not just CIFAL's own websites. For example, include a link to a newspaper or magazine article that talks about CIFAL's importance, or some other newsworthy-event that CIFAL was involved with. For more information, see <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Wikipedia:Notability</a> and <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a>. For example, the statement that CIFAL forms a "key part" of the U.N. should probably be cited to an outside source that confirms the organization's relative importance. And if you have any questions, let us know! --<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EElonka_d4b2.html" title="User:Elonka">Elonka</a> 20:57, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Dealing with vandalism</span></h2>
<p>Hi Ben, thanks for the question you left on my talk page. Typically, vandals are warned four times and, if they persist, can then be reported at <a href="../../../a/i/v/WP%7EAIV_b7f6.html" title="WP:AIV">WP:AIV</a>. Administrators monitor that page and can block the user from editing Wikipedia for a period of time. For further information on this policy, see <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVandalism_70f0.html#Dealing_with_vandalism" title="Wikipedia:Vandalism">Wikipedia:Vandalism#Dealing with vandalism</a>. Links to the warning templates can also be found on this page. Additional templates for all kinds of issues are available at <a href="../../../u/t/m/WP%7EUTM_f81f.html" title="WP:UTM">WP:UTM</a>. I placed the second warning {{<a href="../../../t/e/s/Template%7ETest2_cdb7.html" title="Template:Test2">test2</a>}} on the talk page of the user you mentioned. If you have any additional questions, please drop me a note. Thanks for reverting vandalism on Wikipedia. Regards, <a href="../../../a/c/c/User%7EAccurizer_605d.html" title="User:Accurizer">Accurizer</a> 21:16, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi again, the anon vandal template is more specific than test1, it is directed towards an anonymous user (IP address) who has vandalized. Unlike a registered account, IP addresses can be used by numerous people, and they would all see the warning message. Anon users who receive a test1 but did not themselves vandalize might not understand this and could be put off by the warning. The anon vandal template explains to any innocent users why they are seeing the message and invites them to create an account to avoid receiving warnings (and possible blocks) that were intended for others. Since there is no "anon vandal 2", we follow anon vandal with test2. And yes, you can place it yourself. I added it only because I was online and did not know whether you still were and, if not, when you would return. Warnings are most effective when placed quickly. When using these templates, just be sure to substitute them like this: {{subst:test1}}. This places the text of the template on the page instead of establishing a link back to the template.

Do you know <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Waterboys_3fe6.html" title="The Waterboys">The Waterboys</a> song using the Yeats poem as lyrics (The Stolen Child)?

<ul>
<li>There is another, later Waterboys song that also uses a Yeats poem as the lyrics, but it was not as memorable (for me at least).</li>
<li>To get the peer review javascript, add {{subst:js|User:AndyZ/peerreviewer.js}} to your monobook.js, and save it. You also have to bypass your browser cache afterwards (I think it gives you a message how to do this). After that, when you edit an article click on the peer review link right next to the log out button. The peer review comes in template form, so you have to paste it into a page to really read it. Let me know if you have trouble / questions and I will see what I can do to help.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Islands of the Inner Hebrides</span></h2>
<p>I see that you've added a number of additional islands such as Handa and the Summer Isles to this category. Whilst I agree that they didn't seem to be well categorised under Islands of Scotland, I din't think that they are normally included within the Hebrides. Indeed <a href="../../../i/n/n/Inner_Hebrides_b7cf.html" title="Inner Hebrides">Inner Hebrides</a> does not include them. Do you have another source which says otherwise? --<a href="../../../j/b/e/User%7EJBellis_bd93.html" title="User:JBellis">JBellis</a> 17:31, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The Encylopedia Britannica (free bit) says the Inner Hebrides are from from Skye in the north to Islay <a href="http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9042446/Inner-Hebrides" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9042446/Inner-Hebrides" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. You may also want to consider how you would categorise the small islands off the north coast of Sutherland which clearly don't belong in Orkney. It's very difficult to prove a negative - on that logic, Gruinard was the brithplace of Jack the Ripper and Iceland has a territorial claim on the Summer Isles. --<a href="../../../j/b/e/User%7EJBellis_bd93.html" title="User:JBellis">JBellis</a> 18:15, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><i>...confirm that the artist is Sam Bough...this Scottish painter died in 1878...</i></p>
<p>This means {{pd-art}} definitely applies. It also means you can take that book cover image and crop the releavant part from it for the article. The logic behind this is that the artist is dead over 100 years so the picture is offically public domain in the US. This makes it public domain for english wikipedia (US based) and therefor due to bilateral trade agreements the UK respects this copyright law. You can take the photo of the picture and use it, because this case <a href="../../../b/r/i/Bridgeman_Art_Library_v._Corel_Corp._c4bb.html" title="Bridgeman Art Library v. Corel Corp.">Bridgeman Art Library v. Corel Corp.</a> means the copyright of the original picture is the copyright in question (not the copyright of the photo of the picture). If you want a second opinion you can ask here <a href="../../../m/e/d/Wikipedia%7EMedia_copyright_questions_04f1.html" title="Wikipedia:Media copyright questions">Wikipedia:Media copyright questions</a>.

<p>I unfortunately never got around to fully rewriting the article (my contribution to Wikipedia tends to come in spurts). So, take a try at it. If you looked at the old article, you'll see why I deleted--it basically read like something out of a true ghost stories book. If you're going to write a detailed article, I'd certainly suggest describing the various paranormal interpretations and their history. After all, you're right--they are still of great interest. The problem with the old article wasn't that it described those theories, but that it fancifully championed them, and this is Wikipedia, not Unsolved Mysteries. I agree with you on the theory that the sea took them, and if I remember correctly, it seems that this is the most widely accepted of the more plausible explanations. <a href="../../../h/a/v/User%7EHavardj_0bce.html" title="User:Havardj">havardj</a> Jack 06:26, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Reply to Scottish Island template/infobox question...</span></h2>
<p>"I have been working on a new infobox to use for Scottish islands. A draft of the infobox is here (on the rhs of the page). Clearly there is something I have not understood, and I am sure it is something simple, but I can't find what I am looking for amidst the blizzard of Help jargon. I tried copying it to Template:X1 and then posting {X1} (with two braces) to a page. The infobox appeared but with the data fields presented as in the template (e.g. {{{area}}}), and when I went to edit the box on that page all there was, was {X1}. Looking at other templates transcluded into pages I imagine I should see a nice user-friendly list to add data too. I have not therefeore had the confidence to post a new page 'Template:Infobox Scottish island' yet. Apologies if I am being dense - any assistance gratefully received.

<dd>I'm not really sure what you're asking. If you need to copy something from a sandbox, don't. By the time you copy it, it will probably be deleted. Second, to copy something into a page (template-wise), instead of saying, for example, {{welcome}}, add "subst:" in front of "welcome" so it says {{subst:welcome}}. (And to make it so you see the template code instead of the actual template, place and around the template code.) Plz reply on my talk page. --<a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStonedChipmunk_4b73.html" title="User:StonedChipmunk">StonedChipmunk</a> 02:36, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You can include non-template pages with double brace too, which makes experimentation in the User space possible. The syntax {{User:Ben MacDui/Infobox Scottish island}} will include the page User:Ben MacDui/Infobox Scottish island as if it were a template. <a href="../../../g/a/m/User%7EGameKeeper_fab7.html" title="User:GameKeeper">GameKeeper</a> 08:53, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Oops, that "place and around the template code" isn't what I meant. The codes I put didn't appear. When you are editing, check the Wiki markup list of codes below the Save Page button and look for the one that says nowiki. That's the one that keeps a template code from being actually used (just makes it displayed). And GameKeeper makes a good point too. --<a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStonedChipmunk_4b73.html" title="User:StonedChipmunk">StonedChipmunk</a> 15:40, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Dun</span></h2>
<p>Hi Ben. I'm fascinated by your entry on the St Kilda page: the bit about Dun having been joined to Hirta until a galleon from the Spanish Armada crashed into it. Do you have a reference for that? Dhmellor 11:19, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yes, of course. It's Maclean again, p18. "one of the galleons lost in St Kilda waters was driven through the channel in a storm. The ship's mast caught the arch as it passed underneath it and brought a massive fall of rock down on its decks, sinking the ship and destroying the arch." He does not cite his source, although Martin Martin is a possibility. It sounds far-fetched and awfully like a resident of the gaeltacht winding up a sassenach, but as <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> makes it clear "the threshold for inclusion in Wikipedia is verifiability, not truth." I'd have cited it but I am reluctant to start adding the &lt;ref&gt; tags in the middle of an article that doesn't use the system. I am not in a position to attempt such a revision for the whole article as I don't have all the source books. There is a wonderful quote I might add about the landscape in which case I'll probably add the ref tags for the Name and Geography sections. Thinking aloud, the See also - <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_places_with_fewer_than_ten_residents.html" title="List of places with fewer than ten residents">List of places with fewer than ten residents</a> seems to me to be be irrelevant and surely 'Notes' should be 'Miscellany'.

<p>I don't know the Lachlan MacLean book so I can't comment on whether he can be regarded as a reliable source. However, I don't remember any Spanish galleons in Martin Martin (though that doesn't mean it isn't there!) and I agree it sounds extremely unlikely. I would go for your 'winding up a sassenach' theory! Happy Hogmanay! Dhmellor 17:57, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>PS When I wrote the above yesterday, I assumed you must have meant Lachlan Maclean (1838), because the passage which you cite does not appear on p.18 of my copy of Charles Maclean's book. However, I have now found it - in my edition it is on p.5. However, I still can't trace the story in Martin Martin or anywhere else in the copious St Kilda literature, and I suspect it may be one of the more recent instances of the old tendency to romanticise about St Kilda!

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Black Rats in Scotland</span></h2>
<p>Hi Ben. Apologies for querying something of yours again, but I think your amendment to the Shiant Isles page, referring to two other islands in Scotland which also have Black Rats, is unreliable. Having been to North Rona and probably read most if not all the literature on it, I can't see how there could be rats there - black or brown - as they would surely have wiped out the nesting Storm Petrels. The same goes for St Kilda, of course. I know Niall Benvie's book claims that North Rona has Black Rats, but I have never seen this claim anywhere else, and frankly I don't believe it. Benvie is a fine photograpther, but...... regards Dhmellor 14:58, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>No problem at all. Checking on the facts is (hopefully) a welcome event. Benvie's book (which it sounds like you have) comes with a NTS badge on it, which may be worth something. I did a quick search for more information. According to the NHS, "the black rat is now extremely rare in Scotland and is absent outwith port areas." <a href="http://www.documents.hps.scot.nhs.uk/environmental/guidance-notes/rats.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.documents.hps.scot.nhs.uk/environmental/guidance-notes/rats.pdf" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> which is probably true from their point of view as I suspect they only visit the Shiants occasionally. Darling, F.F. &amp; Boyd, J.M. 1964. <i>Natural History In The Highlands and Islands</i> record a story that <i>Rattus rattus</i> is said to have "cleared North Rona of its human population of thirty soon after 1685," but that "the rats also starved thereafter." So it is possible that Benvie is failing to recollect the facts accurately. The SNH is usually authoratative. "(Rattus rattus) was introduced to Britain (and presumably Scotland) by the Romans by the 3rd century. There now (post-1983) appear to be no self-sustaining populations on the Scottish mainland, although they may be present on Westray in Orkney and the Shiant Islands of Skye (Corbet &amp; Harris, 1991; Arnold, 1993). <a href="http://www.snh.org.uk/publications/on-line/aliens/audit/fulltext.doc" class="external text" title="http://www.snh.org.uk/publications/on-line/aliens/audit/fulltext.doc" rel="nofollow">An Audit Of Alien Species In Scotland</a> (May 2004). Westray! This is news to me. The JNCC's 1999 <i>Developing a mammal monitoring programme for the UK</i> <a href="http://www.jncc.gov.uk/PDF/bto2_report223.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.jncc.gov.uk/PDF/bto2_report223.pdf" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> states that the Scottish population is an estimated 1,300 and that the species is "Confined to ports and to Lundy Island (Bristol Channel) at least the three larger of the Shiant Isles (Key et al 1998), and Inchcolm and possibly other Firth of Forth islands."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Thus the statement "The Shiants are one of only three places in the Scotland where the Black Rat (Rattus rattus) can still be found" may be true even if Benvie is not accurate. "The Shiants are one of <u>perhaps</u> only three places.." may be a useful compromise. If North Rona is free of them (and I don't doubt you are right about this), they are probably also on Incholm and may also be on Westray and/or elsewhere in the Firth of Forth. It also sounds like there are regular arrivals in the ports, but we can probably gloss over that. I am disappointed in Benvie tho'. --<a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBen_MacDui_7612.html" title="User:Ben MacDui">Ben MacDui</a> <small><a href="../../../b/e/n/User_talk%7EBen_MacDui_4891.html" title="User talk:Ben MacDui">(Talk)</a></small> 20:32, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Ben, your sources (and others) suggest that Inchcolm and perhaps other nearby islands in the Firth of Forth may have (or have recently had) Black Rats. I was as surprised as you about Westray, so I googled westray and rats, and found this fascinating link: <a href="http://216.239.59.104/search?q=cache:PGgSB6LTihsJ:www.westraypapawestray.co.uk/resources/files/5-%2520mammals.pdf+westray+rats&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=uk&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=1&amp;ie=UTF-8\" class="external autonumber" title="http://216.239.59.104/search?q=cache:PGgSB6LTihsJ:www.westraypapawestray.co.uk/resources/files/5-%2520mammals.pdf+westray+rats&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=uk&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=1&amp;ie=UTF-8\" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> Sounds credible, I think, and indicates that although Westray has had them in recent memory, it is now clear. So I reckon the best we could do on the Shiants page would be something like 'Apart from one or two small islands in the Firth of Forth, the Shiants are believed to be the only place in the UK where the Black rat (Rattus rattus) can still be found'. I don't think we should be too hard on Niall Benvie - it's a bit of a 'coffee table book' really (sorry if that sounds patronising!) Dhmellor 17:41, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Good find on the Westray front. I occasionally manage a visit there and will save this anecdote up. I have never managed North Rona however - that's quite a trip. I added something about the 1685 rats there - I am hoping my confidence in FFD will not also be dented! I will however treat Mr. Benvie's contributions with more caution in future. If you have an interest in Scottish wildlife generally as well as the islands there is a draft I have of a new article I could do with a hand on. --<a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBen_MacDui_7612.html" title="User:Ben MacDui">Ben MacDui</a> <small><a href="../../../b/e/n/User_talk%7EBen_MacDui_4891.html" title="User talk:Ben MacDui">(Talk)</a></small> 10:21, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm sure we can have every confidence in FFD! I've done a bit more work on the North Rona article, inspired by your example. I'm more seriously into islands than wildlife, but the one does tend to lead to the other. If your wildlife article is already posted I'll certainly have a look and contribute if I can.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Fauna draft</span></h2>
<p>Hi, I was looking at your draft of Fauna of Scotland and the following excerpt concerned me:</p>
<p><i>Scotland is the remaining European stronghold for the Freshwater Pearl Mussel (Margaritifera margaritifera), supporting populations in over 50 rivers, mainly in the Highlands.</i></p>
<p>This sentence is very similar to the referenced JNCC page; I would suggest finding a way to paraphrase this information. The draft looks good so far but I just wanted to inform you of this before you post it in mainspace. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuarma_8c0e.html" title="User:Quarma">Quarma</a> 20:14, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p><a name="Location_map_of_Scotland" id="Location_map_of_Scotland"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">Location map of Scotland</span></h2>
<p>Can I ask why you keep reverting the location map of Scotland which is in line with all other UK location maps and keep replacing it with one not showing Scotland as part of the UK and out of line with all other UK location maps? <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomethingoranother_1921.html" title="User:Somethingoranother">Somethingoranother</a> 22:09, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>By all means. There are three main reasons.</p>
<p>1) The Scotland page is prone to more-or-less endless vandalism and POV pushing. More effort seems to go into simply keeping it stable than in improving it. It is therefore my view that any changes of significance ought to be discussed on the Talk page first, (ideally reaching consensus) if for no other reason than to help that silent brigade of watchers who are trying to keep the article stable. It is all too easy for things to fall apart, especially if there are complex edits with no clear strategy behind them going on.</p>
<p>2) It does not matter to me what other home countries do on their pages, only what is the best thing for this page. Following the herd is not necessarily better.</p>
<p>3) I can't see any purpose in confusing the map with an extra shading for the UK. Definitions of Scotland, England, UK, Europe etc. are all a click away. Many people already confuse 'England' and the 'UK' and I don't think the England map does anything other than re-inforce that condition. Maybe a better map with clearer colours would work, but what is the point? The UK map does not show 'Europe' in a subsidiary shade.</p>
<p>Thank-you for asking, and I hope we will find a positive way to work together to improve this article. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBen_MacDui_7612.html" title="User:Ben MacDui">Ben MacDui</a> <small><a href="../../../b/e/n/User_talk%7EBen_MacDui_4891.html" title="User talk:Ben MacDui">(Talk)</a></small> 08:59, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
