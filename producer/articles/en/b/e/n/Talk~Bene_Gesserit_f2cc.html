<p>The Bene Gesserit are more than just shepherds of humanity, or manipulators of breeding lines throughout human history. They represent the mystical qualities that cannot be refuted as impossible. Their capabilities may be fictional in origin, but it does not necessarily imply that they cannot be attained.</p>
<p>As mentioned throughout the Dune series, the Bene Gesserit use many different techniques to become the potential of what is human... to distinguish themselves as more than just animals who can think. There are many abilities to which the Bene Gesserit attach purpose and self-sufficiency.</p>
<p>First, there is Voice. This weapon of sorts allows the Bene Gesserit to manipulate those around them by adjusting the inflection of their voice to extract the susceptible vulnerabilities of the person with whom they are speaking. People are capable of doing this, and many do it everyday. People will adjust the tone of voice to reassure, intimidate, make secret, insult, etc. But the Bene Gesserit have taken this use of exercising influence through speaking to a unique level, which speaks volumes about the emphasis on control within the Bene Gesserit ranks.</p>
<p>Second, control is the guiding force behind the Bene Gesserit's power and many characters within the Dune series are afraid of the Bene Gesserit's especially controlling trademark ability: the observation of minutae. When a person's voice rises, this indicates that they are either angry or need the attention of those around them. When looking at underlying pressures, this can also be seen as an unconscious effort to intimidate others into ignoring the insecurities of the speaker. But that is only one analysis compared to a very extensive amount of readable expressions. A Bene Gesserit recognizes underlying pressures out of instinct incited by intense training. This training is primarily focused on prana musculature and bindu nervature--control of muscles and nerves to the point where every movement and feeling is susceptible to their control. Evidence of this can be seen in the practices of Buddhist monks, who were probably a significant influence in the development of the Sisterhood.</p>
<p>Finally, women aren't the only ones capable of this, even though the Bene Gesserit believed this very strongly at one point. Supreme Bashar Miles Teg, the Bene Gesserit's military commander in the Heretics of Dune, was trained by his Bene Gesserit mother. He became a superb Mentat capable of reasoning with both Mentat and Bene Gesserit abilities. He was a figure almost equal to the Mother Superior, in terms of differentiating between the abilities of separate genders. The Bene Gesserit Sisterhood is an equalizer in the society of the book and our own society today. It describes a possibility concerning the evolution of the human species and the innate capabilities of all people. If anything else can be said, they hold within them the memory of the past itself, and that in itself, is the paving to an eclectic future.</p>
<p>"Religion is the emulation of the adult by the child. Religion is the encystment of past beliefs: mythology, which is guesswork, the hidden assumptions of trust int th universe, those pronouncements which men have made in search of personal power, all of it mignled with shreds of enlightenment. And always the unspoken commandment is 'Thou shalt not question!' But we question as a matter of course. The work to which we have set ourselves is the liberating of the imagination, the harnessing of imagination to humankind's deepest sense of creativity.</p>
<p>-Bene Gesserit Credo</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>With this, it becomes clear whose obligations define the latent purpose of humanity, and whose control will see those purposes through to their end. The Bene Gesserit are simply the microcosm of a perfected humanity; who can attach negativity to such potential?</p>
<p><br />
In systhesis, the Bene Gesserit Order is simply a manifestation of the deepest desires of humans to use the fundamental changing character of the universe, and to use these changes to the advantage of an evolving humanity, Bene Gesserit are very likely to be around the time when humans begin assume godlike qualities, such as immortality and omnicience, this is hinted at through the series, the final maturity of humanity, beyond survival, comes happiness, beyond happiness, godliness.</p>

<p>It has been stated several times during the original <i>Dune</i> series that the Bene Gesserit cannot apply the Voice on those who are unable to hear them. We've seen several characters take advantage of this fact -- both House Harkonnen (in <i>Dune</i>) and House Corrino (in <i>Children of Dune</i>) employed deaf people to guard Jessica of the Bene Gesserit, knowing that she could not control them via the Voice.</p>
<p>I added in the bit about the Bene Gesserit needing to know <i>something</i> about their targets for them to use their Voice effectively, because I believe it was implied in the books, or at least in the first book. The scene in <i>Dune</i> in which Jessica and Paul attempt to escape their captors after the Atreides palace in Arakeen fell is the clearest example in mind right now. It's not very clear-cut -- while Paul certainly was inexperienced in the Voice at that time, there was certainly an implication that different people could only be manipulated with the Voice in different ways, and that you needed to know your target well enough before performing the Voice on 'em. What do you folks think?--<a href="../../../t/-/b/User%7ET-Boy_4523.html" title="User:T-Boy">T-Boy</a> 19:02, 9 Jun 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Doubtful. Jessica and Paul escaped a 'thopter piloted by two anonymous Harkonnen thugs by use of Voice. Maybe we're getting a little too crazy about this?<a href="../../../y/e/a/User%7EYeago_6121.html" title="User:Yeago">Yeago</a> 00:34, 23 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hmmm, ok. In some very dry sense I suppose you're right. Like, in order to know this communication with you will be useful at all, I will need to know <i>something</i> about you. I suppose I find that people are always coming to these Dune articles looking to make deep inferences ... sure, add whatever. Just keep in mind fellas... <i>its fiction!</i> All this blah blah blah'ing is missing the point. The stated similarities between voice and say, Hitler's power of vocal command are pretty relevant.

<p>The Bene Gesserit began around the time of the Butlerian Jihad by incorporating together the groups of sorceresses such as those on Rossack. They operated behind the veil of a mystical school that served the Empire by training woman who were perceptive and physicly able, were often Truthsayers (that is they could detect sincerity and falsehood), and made good mates for royalty. However, the Bene Gesserit in reality acted as a secret society with its own motives. The motives were in short to mature humanity and guide it along to avoid its innevitable stagnation or destruction.</p>
<p>Bene Gesserit Reverend Mothers were made so by changing an illuminating drug within their body which was achieved only after many years of training to have complete control of their body as an acolyte. The drugs differed throughout history the first being found on Rossack, and more powerful and effective ones were often found. The Reverend Mothers had the ability to see their entire female ancestry and held all of their memories which they would pass on if possible at death. They had plaes though that they could never looked based on their female physiology.</p>
<p>[It was not untill after the Arrakis incident that it was discovered that the Water of Life (bile from a drowned Sandworm), Melange in its purest form could be used to greatly increase the powers of the Bene Gesserit. The use of Water of Life was most likely first discovered by a Reverend Mother in extremis working towards the ends of the Sisterhood's Missionaria Protectiva.]</p>
<p>The Missionaria was a program that planted religons and superstitions among mankind in order to allow the Bene Gessetit to capitalize on them when necessary. they protected sister stranded among different peoples and also paved the way to their eventual use of the Kwisatz Haderach.</p>
<p>It should be noted that the title of Reverend Mother used by Fremen for their religous leaders does not mean that these people are part of the Bene Gesserit sisterhood. they deserve the title due to the fact that they changed the Water of Life but the title was implanted by the Missionaria and the Mothers serve no allegiance to the B.G.</p>
<p>The Sisterhood did not wish to control humanity directly from the throne because they knew that all who held power eventualy lost it. therefore, they worked behind the rulers of the Empire usually as their mates of wives. A way was seen to put a Bene Gesserit pawn on the throne however by creating a male Bene Gesserit called the Kwisatz Haderach. This male would be able to see what the women could not and have powers far beyond the typical revernd Mothers. They concocted a massive breeding program over millenia on order to arrive at this end. However due to the actions of a failed sister (Jessica) the Kwisatz Haderach arrived earlier than anticipated with far greater powers, and worst of all was independent. He ascended to the throne by his own means and his oracular powers guided his actions.</p>
<p>The Kwisatz Haderach (Paul Muad'Dib) was hated by the Bene Gesserit for his srtrict rule and because he ruined their plans. The rulers son (Leto II) however was hated far more. The son ruled the Known Universe for 3500 years as a religous figure after taking on the body of a sandworm. He took the Bene Gesserit breeding program from them and severly limited the availability of Melange to them. He set humanity on a path for survival he called the Golden path which and made it so that no one ruler would ever again have a complete hold on mankind by breeding to protect people from prescient searchers. After Leto II died the Bene Gesserit had been greatly matured and eventually gained a large ammount of direct control over many planets.</p>
<p>The Bene Gesserit sisterhood was faced with severe problems though when a seemingly infinite number of people from the Scattering of Humanity during Leto II's reign began coming back to the Old Empire. The Reverend Mothers that went out to Scatter seemed to have changed to something terrible in the face of new elements out in the scattering and returned as Honored Matres. Around this time a message from Leto was discovered accusing the Bene Gesserit of having no noble purpose and saying that they too will one day end. He challenged them to openly defend his Golden Path. the Mother Superior of the Sisterhood made a drastic decision to end Leto's hold on humanity and destroy Dune hoping that they could make spice on another planet. To do so they goaded the Honored Matres to attack by making a ghola capable of duplicating their sexual abilities. It was these abilities that had allowed the Hionored Matres to enslave planets and have such power.</p>
<p>The Honored Matres though hunted the Bene Gesserit down destroying planet after planet untill the Sisterhood's current leader Darwi Odrade made a risjy plan to unite both groups under a single Revernd MOther who was once an Honored Matre named Murbella. Murbella did so and the hope was to stop the violence that threatened to destroy humanity. It ws found that a great foe existed out in the scattering that had shaped the Honored Matres and caused their return and it was thought that the foe were Face Dancers who had achieved godlike abilities.</p>

<dd>In the prelude book <i>Battle for Corrin</i> it is explained that the Sorceresses of Rossak started recording genetic information in an attempt to protect humanities gene pool from the <b>Omnius Scourge</b> (A plague released by the thinking machines in an attempt to wipe out humanity). They gained their powers from years of living on Rossak where its exotic flora had a mutating effect which seemed to effect only the women. I couldn't find any of this information in the beginning section at all. <a href="../../../e/n/i/User%7EEnigmatical_a9c5.html" title="User:Enigmatical">Enigmatical</a> 22:34, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, I know nothing about Dune, and it may be a coincidence, but in Latin it means "he will have acted well". <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Bishop_face.html" title="User:Adam Bishop">Adam Bishop</a> 02:09, 14 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Huh--"acted"? I bet you know more Latin that I do (most anybody does), but my vaaague Latin-class recollections plus some online dictionary-poking suggests that "gero" means "to carry, bear, wear / bear, give birth to / to carry about" (and "wage war on," per another source). So I wonder if the "carry" (in this case, responsibility for human welfare and the human genome) or "give birth to" meanings might be more to the point. "He/she/it will have born [an unspecified object] well"--it's pretty bad Latin, but that might even be deliberate in the book's context. Shoot, it could even be SUPER-bad Latin for "well-born."

<dd><i>Gero</i> is one of those verbs that means a variety of things. According to <a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3D%2319513" class="external text" title="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3D%2319513" rel="nofollow">Lewis and Short</a>, it can mean "to bear about with one, to bear, carry, to wear, have" or "to bear, have, entertain, cherish" or "to bear, deport, behave, or conduct one's self, to act" (cf. their multitudionous references to classical authors). There are a few explicit references to Latin in the Dune chronicles, and the Bene Gesserit know the language. Perhaps Herbert selected the word for its ambiguity so that the name of their order included the ideas of bearing, producing, cherishing, waging, and acting. Then again, there are the <a href="../../../b/e/n/Bene_Tleilax_87d5.html" title="Bene Tleilax">Bene Tleilax</a>, the name of which is not a Latin phrase and which is more of a religious order.

<p>I added a small additional note on translation: "gesserit" can also be subjunctive mood. It's a less likely use for a stand-alone phrase like that, but technically possible. SanchoPanza 20:02, 22 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The name can be interpreted in hebrew as 'sons of bridge' or 'bridging children'. It might relate to the 'Kwisatz Haderach', which means 'shortcut' in hebrew. --Nushoin 21:27, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Is the <i>bene</i> pronunciation of בני a Modern Hebrew thing? Isn't it more commonly transliterated "b'nai" or "benai" (where the 'e' represents schwa)? The only use of "bene" I have seen is to refer to Indian Jews.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>More importantly, why would a group of women choose a name containing a word meaning "sons of"? (I know, another meaning is "children", but given the predominant male nuance....) <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandChigger_69b3.html" title="User:SandChigger">SandChigger</a> 02:20, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>i removed the claim of hebrew or arabic origin. it's obvious original research and doesn't belong. (anyway, a form "beni geziret" would not occur with the supposed meaning of "nomadic tribe"; it could only occur in "beni geziret el X..." = sons of the island of X.)</p>

<p>"A Semitic origin of the name should also be strongly considered i.e., Hebrew/Arabic. The closest resemblance to 'Bene Gesserit' would be a 'Beni Geziret' (Egyptian pronunciation). "Beni" literally means "sons", but specifically it can mean "nomadic tribe". In Frank Herbert's application of Arabic it may denote a "religious order" bound by strong ties. "Geziret" or "Jazira" means in general "island", or the land between the waters; as a specific geographic term it denotes currently an island in the <a href="../../../n/i/l/Nile.html" title="Nile">Nile</a> within <a href="../../../c/a/i/Cairo.html" title="Cairo">Cairo</a>, the Arabian peninsula and Northern Mesopotamia (today the region of northern Iraq, southeast Turkey and east Syria). In Frank Herbert's application it might be understood as the order which is a stable island between the flowing forces of the universe. As for Hebraic origin, Bene Gesserit might stem from "B'nai Gesher" (בני גשר), "the Sons of the Bridging," an allusion strongly emphasized in the <i>Dune</i> series: one of Bene Gesserit's function is to be the bridge between humanity and <a href="../../../k/w/i/Kwisatz_Haderach_d65c.html" title="Kwisatz Haderach">Kwisatz Haderach</a>."</p>

<p>I'm skeptical we should include anything about Hebrew at all. We already have a much better explanation as it being Latin, and we have it sourced and quoted from an actual professor who wrote on Herbert's actual works. The Hebrew analogues strike me as forced, unlikely, and totally unsourced (and thus probably OR). I'm not normally in favor of removing information, but when we have correct and better information, why do we want wrong fancruft? --<a href="../../../g/w/e/User_talk%7EGwern_64b9.html" title="User talk:Gwern">Gwern</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Gwern_077f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Gwern">(contribs)</a> 20:32 <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_18.html" title="February 18">18 February</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2007.html" title="2007">2007</a> (GMT)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The reason I left it in was <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> that there was some rationale behind the info. But since it kinda looks like fancruft or OR, I put on the fact tag. Given the Latin with the source, I'm satisfied to remove it completely and say the term comes only from the Latin. I was under the impression that Herbert revealed the source or provided his rationale. Re-reading, the whole section kinda looks like OR except for the W.F.Touponce ref. <a href="../../../w/l/u/User%7EWLU_ad34.html" title="User:WLU">WLU</a> 20:39, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I reverted all the edits that switched "ego" with "soul". Even if "soul" is considered metaphorically, it's still inappropriate. Herbert didn't go into much detail about what the exact entity was in other memory, but there's strong implications all over the books that, whatever it was, it was present to the carrier as an ego in memory, and it was carried genetically. It's clearly stated that other memories exist only to the point where the next ancestor was conceived; later in the series, when the Bene Gesserit make a ghola of Miles Teg, Miles doesn't remember his own death because the flesh that was sampled was taken by Darwi Odrade prior to that. Other memories are definitely not souls in any religious sense, and the use of the term is misleading, at best. <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustin_Johnson_9c76.html" title="User:Justin Johnson">JJ</a> 23:42, 15 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

I would point out though that Duncan Idaho (post God Emperor) had other memories of selves that he was not created from. He said himself that he did not contain physical aspects of all previous Duncans yet he contained all of their memories.</p>

<p>Note that the water of life was not the awareness drug used by the Reverend Mothers untill after it was found to be in use by the Fremen by Jessica and Muad'Dib. Until then they used other narcotics.</p>

<dd>I disagree. although it is true that they have used other narcotics in the past. Bene Gesserit Reverend Mothers probably had access to the Spice Agony even prior to Jessica's encounter with the Water of Life. I would sift through the original novels for some more concrete evidence but as of now I don't have the time to.

<dd>I was just reading Jessica's spice agony scene in <i>Dune</i>, and though she is admittedly a bit in the dark on the nature of the equivalent Bene Gesserit ritual on Wallach IX, she specifically notes that the B.G. back home don't do it that way, refers to Rossak drug, and is genuinely surprised at the source/nature of the Water of Life (I've cut out unrelated material in between these excerpts):</dd>

<dd>I have about 200 pages left of the 3rd prequal and I have to admit that unless they "suddenly" reveal the origin within those pages teh above is not "totally" accurate. The "Sorceresses of Rossak" always had telepathic powers due to the fact that it was only females who possess this ability. They certainly were <b>not</b> bred to fight the machines (and in reality they can only fight <b>Cymeks</b> not machines), though they "volunteered" to train to be used as psychic weapons against them. Yes they were also responsible for starting the genetic recording program, but at this stage there is absolutely no reference to the KH at all. Whats more, Norma Cenva (who has now become the first Guild Navigator) was a daughter of one of the sorceresses. She was able to see prescient visions which included a reference to other memory (though not directly). Add to this Vorian Atriedes grand daughter who contracted the rossak's modified version of the Omnious Scourge and who was able to convert the virus in her body into an innert substance (something reverend mothers must do during the rite of passage) and it appears as if the origins of the Bene Gesserit is a little more complex. Either way, they were certainly not bred for the task and before they realised they could use their telepathic powers as a weapon they were not even warriors!!! I will report back here when I have finished the book. <a href="../../../e/n/i/User%7EEnigmatical_a9c5.html" title="User:Enigmatical">Enigmatical</a> 22:35, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Just to clarify by what I meant in the first sentance. It is already not totally accurate (ie they were not bred for it , they were never warriors, and it was not the machines they fought) regardless of what happens in the end of the last book, but due to the confusion between the Sorceresses of Rossak, Norma Cenva and Vorian's Grand daughter which all show aspects of the Bene Gesserit there may be something revealed near the end which sheds light on exactly their origin or how these 3 things get tied together. That is what I am hoping to find in the end of the book... if that doesn't happen then all we have is speculation as to how the different aspects came together. <a href="../../../e/n/i/User%7EEnigmatical_a9c5.html" title="User:Enigmatical">Enigmatical</a> 01:59, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Perhaps it might be mentioned in the article that Bene Gesserit Reverend Mothers and sisters in the time before Emperor Leto seemed to have a naming scheme, i.e., a masculine Roman <a href="../../../p/r/a/Praenomen.html" title="Praenomen">praenomen</a>/<a href="../../../n/o/m/Nomen.html" title="Nomen">nomen</a>, followed by an English female given name, followed by an (invented?)

<p>This is a technicality that I'd normally just fix, but I wanted to confirm it first. Does Frank Herbert ever refer to Jessica as Jessica Atreides? She's not actually married to Leto, and thus not really Atreides. The article on the character never refers to her as Jessica Atreides (except in a citation). This article, however, repeatedly refers to her as Jessica Atreides. --<a href="../../../a/c/i/User%7EAciel_d73d.html" title="User:Aciel">aciel</a> 20:37, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Interestingly, neither Brian nor Frank Herbert use the term "Jessica Atreides", specifically.
