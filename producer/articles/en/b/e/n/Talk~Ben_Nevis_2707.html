<p>I have difficulty with the referencing in this article. 355 days of the year no visibility from the top, with a reference to a BBC news page about the Ben Nevis. However, no word about it's weather conditions in there... That makes me wonder how true the statement is, and why teh reference has been put there. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Marije (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Marije_1ffa.html" title="Special:Contributions/Marije">contribs</a>) 17:43, October 2, 2005 (UTC)</small></p>

<dd>Aah yes, that would be my fault, well spotted. The problem was that I thought it took the keys you type in for references, so if you have {ref|bbc} it would automatically tie this up with {note|bbc}. It seems that the references at the end also (for some reason) need to be in the same order as the references appear in the article, rather than alphabetical as I had ordered them.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Hopefully they should all make more sense in relation to the sentences they refer to now that I've re-ordered the references at the end. Thanks again pointing it out. — <a href="../../../p/m/c/User%7EPmcm_a5d3.html" title="User:Pmcm">pmcm</a> 20:41, 2 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm inclined to doubt these statistics. Granted they come from a "reliable source", but the source looks more reliable on geology than on climate, which is only circumstantial to the article. I find it hard to believe that the summit is covered in cloud for 355 <i>full</i> days a year; more likely it sees <i>some</i> cloud at <i>some point</i> during 355 days. In any case the weather isn't that remarkable; it may be worse than on most Scottish mountains due to the extra altitude, but I doubt it's that much worse. I've updated the weather section to reflect these doubts and moved it to the section on ascents, where it surely has more relevance than in the lead section, with a bit more about navigational difficulties. -- <a href="../../../b/l/i/User%7EBlisco_5543.html" title="User:Blisco">Blisco</a> 22:22, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Point taken about the cloud incidence, which is incidentally quite a bit higher than for other Munros, not just because of the altitude and location, but also because of its size and shape which forces airstreams upwards so generating significant extra cloud and precipitation. It seems to me that a summit cloud incidence statistic would be better (the figure of 75% sticks in my mind although I cannot source it). But I do not agree with the transfer of the weather section. Weather does not come under ascent routes. The right place for the weather information is in the lead section, directly under the fatalities information to which it is highly relevant. Also why were the additional rainfall comparisons removed? These were useful and did not occupy too much space. Any further comments? <a href="../../../v/i/e/User%7EViewfinder_116d.html" title="User:Viewfinder">Viewfinder</a> 08:00, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>OK, the ascents section is not the ideal place for it, but I think it was overbalancing the lead section and being given too much prominence as the second paragraph (<i>before</i> the bit about fatalities). To be honest this article could do with a major restructuring - at present it seems to share the common fault of many Wikipedia articles, that of having grown organically from a stub, with short snippets of information held together fairly loosely. (I'm prepared to undertake such a task but won't have time for the next week or few.) The proper place for the weather - in an expanded form with additional comparisons - is probably in a "Geography" section, or perhaps under "Safety". As a stopgap how about putting the heading "Weather" above the relevant paragraph? -- <a href="../../../b/l/i/User%7EBlisco_5543.html" title="User:Blisco">Blisco</a> 08:40, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The article does need restructuring, not least to remove the empty spaces around the "other facts" header. I will do nothing for 24 hours, then, barring further comment, I will create a weather heading as suggested, and remove the empty spaces. You can then overhaul the article when you have the time. <a href="../../../v/i/e/User%7EViewfinder_116d.html" title="User:Viewfinder">Viewfinder</a> 09:06, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree that these statistics, especially regarding cloud cover, seem highly unlikey. During the past twelve months, I've spent about 15 days walking in this area of the western highlands. I think on 12 of these days, I've been able to the summit of Ben Nevis free from the clouds, perhaps only for a few minutes. Admitedly I've had very good luck with weather this year, but if these stats were true, I shouldn't have seen the summit on 12 occasions even if I'd been there every day. I know this is against the <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">no original research</a> rule, but I think it casts enough doubt on the statistic that it should be removed. -- <a href="../../../r/a/s/User%7ERas52_fca8.html" title="User:Ras52">ras52</a> 10:07, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

A <a href="../../../g/o/o/Googlefight.html" title="Googlefight">Googlefight</a> gives 41 hits for <i>Nebhis</i> and 1200 for <i>Nibheis</i>. I'm inclined to change this unless anyone can find supporting evidence for the former spelling. <a href="../../../r/a/s/User%7ERas52_fca8.html" title="User:Ras52">ras52</a> 11:58, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>As half-promised above, I've finally got round to doing a major rewrite and restructuring of this page. Parts of it still leave something to be desired, but the structure should provide a better framework for future improvement. I hope it meets with general approval.

<blockquote>
<p>The origin of the name Ben Nevis is unclear. The word <i>ben</i> is certainly from <i>beinn</i>, the <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scottish_Gaelic_language_83df.html" title="Scottish Gaelic language">Gaelic</a> word for 'peak', and Ben Nevis is sometimes referred to as 'The Ben'. Possibilities for the meaning of <i>nevis</i> include 'venomous' (from <i>nimheil</i>), 'burst' or 'flow' (from <i>neb</i>) and 'brow of keen air' (from <i>neamh</i> meaning 'keeness of air' and <i>bathais</i> meaning 'brow'). A locally popular suggestion that the name derives from <i>nèamh</i> meaning 'heaven' is rejected by <a href="../../../e/t/y/Etymology.html" title="Etymology">etymologists</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This bit has been part of the article since very early on, and was written by the same contributor who inserted the erroneous Gaelic name 'Beinn Nebheis' (as questioned by ras52 above). I'm inclined to treat it as suspect; I've never seen the 'brow of keen air' theory anywhere else, and I don't think the anonymous 'etymologists' necessarily reject 'heaven' out of hand. I've moved here in case anyone can find any supporting references, and replaced it with a shorter, referenced etymology. --<a href="../../../b/l/i/User%7EBlisco_5543.html" title="User:Blisco">Blisco</a> 18:52, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I meant to say this when I made the relevant edit on 5 November, but better late than never. I removed mention of the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Three_Peaks_Challenge_2be8.html" title="National Three Peaks Challenge">National Three Peaks Challenge</a> from the <a href="../../../l/e/a/Wikipedia%7ELead_section_3c3e.html" title="Wikipedia:Lead section">lead section</a>, because, while notable, I didn't think the bare mention that "Ben Nevis is one of the mountains climbed as part of the Three Peaks Challenge" contributed much to the lead. I meant to try and incorporate it somewhere else in the article (e.g. under "Ascent routes"), but forgot. However, I think it would be better to contextualise it a bit: i.e. give some indication of how many people do the challenge and when, and whether or not it's considered to have a significant environmental impact. (According to the article, 29,000 people did the challenge in June 2003, which is a fair proportion of the 100,000 people who climb the Ben!) But if anyone wants to put it back straight away, with or without context, please do. --<a href="../../../b/l/i/User%7EBlisco_5543.html" title="User:Blisco">Blisco</a> 17:54, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I've been trying to find a way of working in a brief mention of the standard long walks / fell runs that include Ben Nevis: the Lochaber Traverse (i.e. the whole of the north side of Glen Nevis: the Grey Corries, Aonachs, CMD and Nevis — a not too hard long day's walk), Tranter's Round (that plus the Mammores — which seems common amongst the serious fell runners) and Ramsay's Round (a modern extension to Tranter's). Perhaps these together with the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Three_Peaks_Challenge_2be8.html" title="National Three Peaks Challenge">National Three Peaks Challenge</a> would naturally fit into a new section? Incidentally, I'd love to see a source for 29,000 people doing the National Three Peaks in June 2003 — I simply don't believe that figure! — <a href="../../../r/a/s/User%7ERas52_fca8.html" title="User:Ras52">ras52</a> 10:48, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Are "Ascent routes" and "Climbing on Ben Nevis" necessary as separate sections? "Climbing..." has a <i>stub section</i> tag (how would it be a GA with stub sections?). The picture in the infobox has too long a caption (there's a guideline stating thet captions should be concise). That is the case with most pictures. "(See External links below for the full view.)" is not encyclopedic. Trivia should not be present in a GA candidate. Please fix this issues before receiving a full GA review. --69.19.14.26 03:11, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>What's wrong with trivia in a GA candidate? The <a href="../../../g/a/3F/WP%7EGA__abdf.html" title="WP:GA?">GA criteria</a> merely states "no <i>non-notable</i> trivia" [my emphasis]. The Ben Nevis distillery is moderately well known and is named after this mountain, so it is sufficiently <a href="../../../n/n/_/WP%7ENN_28a7.html" title="WP:NN">notable</a> and relevant, and its inclusion encylopedic. The same is true of the New Zealand mountain (also named after this mountain). I know nothing about the ship of Wendish settlers, so can't comment on them. I'd be slightly sorry to see the removal of the piano story, but I'd agree it isn't terribly notable or encylopedic.</dd>

The piano could probably be incorporated somewhere else; the best place for the time being is probably "The summit", but it would be nice if we could find enough information to create a section on notable ascents, charity stunts and the like. (When I was there there was a man dressed as a moose on the summit, and this is no doubt a fairly regular phenomenon.) I'm not sure what to do with the rest of the Trivia section; maybe it would be enough to give it a different title? --<a href="../../../b/l/i/User%7EBlisco_5543.html" title="User:Blisco">Blisco</a> 18:46, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Think I've solved this. The ship is pretty non-notable; relevant to the history of the Wendish people, perhaps, but not to this article, for the same reason that a certain bridge over the Thames isn't considered notable enough for inclusion in <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elizabeth_II_of_the_United_Kingdom_e66a.html" title="Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom">Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom</a>. I've shoved The Remarkables in a See also section: a cop-out perhaps, and I dislike such sections in general, but it's mostly harmless. The piano is now under the summit (so to speak). That just leaves the distillery, which I've turned into a proper section with some more information.

Personally, I'm not sure I agree, but that's irrelevant: this is a Wikipedia guideline, and we should try to stick to it where possible. In my browser "The steep south face of Ben Nevis…" takes up five lines, and "The lower part of the Ben Path", seven (due to the narrowness of the image); a number of others take four. The points that you mention — that the tourist route is well maintained; the summit cairn is lower than the observatory; cornices are a hazard; the Nevis Partnership is repairing paths — are all true and worthy of inclusion in the article. And if it weren't for <a href="../../../c/a/p/WP%7ECAP_97cb.html" title="WP:CAP">WP:CAP</a>, I'd agree with you about putting them in the captions.

<dd>I'm surprised at the Ben Path caption taking up seven lines; on my screen it takes up four. What are your monitor settings, and what do other people reading this page see? (I've got a 15-inch monitor at 1024x768 resolution, which is fairly small by modern standards.) Perhaps the solution in this case would be to widen the image a bit? Other than that one, none of the other captions take up more than three lines on my screen. I think it's unlikely that any article would fail a GA nomination for having captions this long; see for example the FA <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slate_industry_in_Wales_9176.html" title="Slate industry in Wales">Slate industry in Wales</a>, in which all of them are much longer. Having said that, I've looked through some of the recently Featured articles and most of them tend to use much shorter captions, so perhaps there is a case for keeping them short and sweet as a rule. -<a href="../../../b/l/i/User%7EBlisco_5543.html" title="User:Blisco">Blisco</a> 00:11, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>This article looks quite good. A lot of excellent work has been put into it, and I really have almost nothing to complain about. There were a few mildly glowing adjectives here and there that made the article sound just a bit like a pamphlet promoting tourism, but nothing unforgivable.</p>
<p>I put a few {{fact}} tags on the article, particularly on historical events. If I happened to put a tag on a fact that is actually referenced in a nearby sentence, please remove the tag and explain the deletion in a detailed edit summary.</p>
<p>In all, though, this article will be GA with just a bit of work. I don't think it should take the whole 7 days.</p>
<p>Good work!</p>

<dd>Which bits did you think suffered from glowing adjectives and tourist-speak? My impression was that the language is pretty sober and neutral; I'd say "classic rock climbs" is about the only phrase that might be construed as glowing, but it's used in the factual sense of one that's been well known and renowned for a long period. --<a href="../../../b/l/i/User%7EBlisco_5543.html" title="User:Blisco">Blisco</a> 23:10, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The statement "it is often known simply as The Ben," is true if unsourced, but the same is also true of many other 'Bens'. Generally speaking 'Ben' is the honorific given to the highest mountain in any particular area. If you stand in the high streets of Alness, Dalwhinnie, or Tobermory, and ask for directions to 'The Ben' you will not end up in Lochaber. The statement is thus not so much untrue as misleading. Rather, I think it is true that in Lancastrian rock-climbing circles 'having a crack at The Ben' is a phrase that is unlikely to be ambiguous. I deference to these hardy souls I think it may be acceptable to amend the wording rather than remove it. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBen_MacDui_7612.html" title="User:Ben MacDui">Ben MacDui</a> <small><a href="../../../b/e/n/User_talk%7EBen_MacDui_4891.html" title="User talk:Ben MacDui">(Talk)</a></small> 10:16, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've rejigged the referencing system a bit. General (especially printed) sources that apply to the whole article are now cited separately at the top of the references section, which means that notes referring to these sources can use a short form followed by a page number, e.g. "Hodgkiss, <i>The Central Highlands</i>, p. 117". This should make the refs a bit easier to digest, and allows you to cite multiple pages of the same book without having to give the full details each time. I'm not sure whether or not to carry on using the &lt;ref name="foo"&gt; business with such notes; it's probably easier not to, but having a new footnote each time would increase the length of the notes section.</p>
<p>On a related matter, would anyone object if the citation templates ({{<a href="../../../c/i/t/Template%7ECite_book_c666.html" title="Template:Cite book">cite book</a>}}, {{<a href="../../../c/i/t/Template%7ECite_web_57d4.html" title="Template:Cite web">cite web</a>}} et al) were dispensed with? I find them confusing and irritating to use and would much rather format the reference myself, but I can see that they make it easier to fill in the blanks without having to worry about consistent formatting. --<a href="../../../b/l/i/User%7EBlisco_5543.html" title="User:Blisco">Blisco</a> 20:11, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks. I support the general references, but not extending the list of references by repeating footnotes. Does the OS map need to be in both general and footnote refs? Citation templates do encourage people to give full details, but are not easy to use - a standard layout is the goal, and I don't know how else we encourage that. <a href="../../../f/i/n/User%7EFinavon_5d04.html" title="User:Finavon">Finavon</a> 23:49, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The article states that the summit cliffs are granite but it's my understanding that they are lavas. They are certainly of that character as a climbing rock and the enclosed citation seems to confirm this (see 1.2 - this file is a 2.6Mb download)</p>

<dd>I'm inclined to agree that those on the <i>northern</i> cliffs look more like lavas than granite, but then I'm no geologist. The rocks round on the CMD arête, Carn Mòr Dearg itself, and to some extent those in Coire Leis, <i>do</i> look like granite, though. My (rather hazy) recollection is that those on the <i>southern</i> crags look like granite too. — <a href="../../../r/a/s/User%7ERas52_fca8.html" title="User:Ras52">ras52</a> 15:21, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>For those wanting to avoid downloading this large file, the relevant quote is "<i>the summit and northern cliffs of Ben Nevis are made of andesite and basaltic lavas and tuffs. A granite intrusion forms the southern slopes of Ben Nevis and also the ridge of the Carn Dearg peaks.</i>" (I presume that by "Carn Dearg peaks" it means "<i>the ridge of Carn Beag Dearg, Carn Dearg Meadhonach and Carn Mór [sic] Dearg</i>".) This is in agreement with the reference cited in the article (Miller's <i>Ben Nevis Geology</i>); the article simply mis-quotes the reference. I've now fixed this in the article. — <a href="../../../r/a/s/User%7ERas52_fca8.html" title="User:Ras52">ras52</a> 17:33, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for fixing my error. I'm even less of a geologist, as you can probably tell. Incidentally, if anyone wants to write about vegetation and land use this article would be a good place to start. --<a href="../../../b/l/i/User%7EBlisco_5543.html" title="User:Blisco">Blisco</a> 18:28, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>What do folks think should be done with <a href="../../../t/o/w/Tower_Ridge_9e7b.html" title="Tower Ridge">Tower Ridge</a>? I put the merge tags on, but I'm having second thoughts. I'm generally against the proliferation of articles, and don't want to encourage the creation of an article on every classic climb on the Ben, but I reckon it would unbalance this article to include such a detailed description. A more sensible option might be to create Climbing on Ben Nevis into which the stuff on Tower Ridge could be merged, but I doubt such an article would get much attention at the moment. Perhaps we should just leave it for six months and see what happens? --<a href="../../../b/l/i/User%7EBlisco_5543.html" title="User:Blisco">Blisco</a> 20:28, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I oppose merging <a href="../../../t/o/w/Tower_Ridge_9e7b.html" title="Tower Ridge">Tower Ridge</a> into <a href="../../../b/e/n/Ben_Nevis_baa0.html" title="Ben Nevis">Ben Nevis</a>. Leaving it where it is for now seems fine. It will probably never be a long article. If there is a proliferation of articles on other routes then Climbing on Ben Nevis would be appropriate. <a href="../../../f/i/n/User%7EFinavon_5d04.html" title="User:Finavon">Finavon</a> 19:28, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It seems quite similar to the detailed route information that used to live on the <a href="../../../a/o/n/Aonach_Eagach_44d2.html" title="Aonach Eagach">Aonach Eagach</a> page. <a href="../../../b/l/i/User%7EBlisco_5543.html" title="User:Blisco">Blisco</a> removed this, leaving a copy <a href="../../../b/l/i/User%7EBlisco_Salvage_cf78.html" title="User:Blisco/Salvage">in his user area</a> saying "I intend to move it to <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikibooks.html" title="Wikibooks">Wikibooks</a> at some point". Long term, I think the same should happen to the <a href="../../../t/o/w/Tower_Ridge_9e7b.html" title="Tower Ridge">Tower Ridge</a> page — the detail, beyond what's on this page, is not really encyclopedic. But until that happens, I suggest we leave it as it is. — <a href="../../../r/a/s/User%7ERas52_fca8.html" title="User:Ras52">ras52</a> 10:07, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
