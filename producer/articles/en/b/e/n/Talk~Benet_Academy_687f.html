<p>Added some. The graduation year for Jim Peterik is a guess, based on the fact that he would've been about 18 in 1969. Can anyone confirm when he graduated?</p>
<p>The singer of Survivor (Eye of the Tiger et al.) was Tom Doody, who graduated in 1963. Jim Peterik graduated from Morton East.</p>
<ul>
<li>Jim Peterik's website and several articles say that he went to Morton West (not Morton East) but Peterik, not Doody, was singer/songwriter/guitarist of Survivor. Tom Doody went to Procopius but was not in Survivor, but rather was a founder of the The Cryan Shames ("Sugar and Spice", "I Wanna Meet You", "It Could Be We're in Love"). -- <a href="../../../d/s/1/User%7EDS1953_d23a.html" title="User:DS1953">DS1953</a> <a href="../../../d/s/1/User_talk%7EDS1953_dfdb.html" title="User talk:DS1953"><sup>talk</sup></a> 15:04, 5 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>My understanding's always been that whoever wrote "Eye of the Tiger" went to Benet, but if there's no documentation to back it up then that's that. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThesquire_e70c.html" title="User:Thesquire">Thesquire</a> 20:29, 6 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Jim Peterik wrote "Eye of the Tiger". The lead singer was Dave Bickler, class of 1971. The song earned an Oscar for song of the year when it was the song for "Rocky". <small>—<i>the preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment is by</i> 68.249.187.99 (talk&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_68.249.187.99_a8d6.html" title="Special:Contributions/68.249.187.99">contribs</a>) 12:04, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</small></li>

<p>Do you think this article should include some mention of the January 15, 1997 car accident that killed three Benet students? (Stephanie Ramos, 14, of Darien; Jeffrey Wirtz, 16, of Darien. Sean O'Donnell, 16, of Bolingbrook) I'm not sure if that's encyclopedic, but it was a pretty major event for the school. (Comment by 134.173.92.223)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Having entered Benet a couple years after that accident, and since graduated, I can say that while the event was major at the time, it's had no real lasting affect on the student body. Most students now only know about it from the plaque in the lobby. It's unencyclopedic. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThesquire_e70c.html" title="User:Thesquire">Thesquire</a> 01:30, 15 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Although it was a very depressing incident, that accident has little effect on the student population. Out of all of my friends, only one knew about this incident.--67.173.123.48 05:44, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I noticed you deleted the recent ACT score as "not notable". I don't see why it shouldn't be up there. Good tests scores are one of the notable things about Benet. Check out the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Trier_High_School_240f.html" title="New Trier High School">New Trier High School</a> page and you'll see that their test scores are listed.</p>
<dl>
<dd>One, use four tildes (~) after your edits on a talk page so we can see who you are. Secondly, the New Trier article encludes a bunch of stuff not of an encyclopedic nature, including its Senior Prank list. However, if you can get some other fun statistics, like average GPAs, National Merit standings, ACT and SAT scores, then by all means create a separate section/paragraph on that. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThesquire_e70c.html" title="User:Thesquire">Thesquire</a> 04:39, 8 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>When'd the school administration decide to actually sponsor the Hockey team? My understanding was that Benet didn't want the liability and so wasn't about to sponsor it. Unless someone speaks up in a week or so, I'm going to assume the status quo is still in effect and revert that particular edit. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThesquire_e70c.html" title="User:Thesquire">Thesquire</a> 06:42, 17 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Update: Hockey is an approved club sport at Benet. If the hockey club had a website, it would be linked from the benet.org athletic site. Club sports are never financially sponsored but the contention has always been that the club was not allowed to use the school name. When the new principal started a couple years ago, the hockey parents met no resistance in allowing the club to finally use the Benet name...something that was prohibited prior (they were known as "Redwings"). The hockey team now makes the grade evidenced by their inclusion in announcements at 10:25am - their game results, leading scorers and upcoming games are some of the news carried over the school PA from the deans office. The fact that the school even has a hockey club is something not known to the general community in large part because of the refusal in the past to use the school name. Today, the hockey team wears a BENET branded hockey jersey on the ice.Wikime5706 14:39, 14 December 2006 (UTC)wikime5706</p>

<li>James McManus, author of the novel "Positively Fifth Street" and recognized poker player, is a Benet alum. I'm hesitant to add his name on the page because I don't know his year of graduation. I will continue to look - but if anyone knows this, please add it! Here is a link to a Chicago Sun Times article about him (check the middle of page two for the Benet Academy reference): <a href="http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4155/is_20030615/ai_n12506682" class="external text" title="http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4155/is_20030615/ai_n12506682" rel="nofollow">Article about James McManus</a></li>

<dd>They finished in 29th, actually. And it was a poor showing...only one girl made it through to the second day (and she only made it to consolation finals).

<dd>A copy of the Benet Herald can be found <a href="http://benet.org/html/news.html" class="external text" title="http://benet.org/html/news.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>. On Page 3 of the December issue, you can see that the girls swimming team made it 19th place in states. So there seems to be a conflict of information here. However, it that is enough to merit a placement on this article, I think that the information on the IHSA website should be used. If you say that the girls placed 29th in states (given that you looked it up on IHSA), then <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> says that the IHSA website should be sourced, <i><b>not</b></i> the Benet Herald.--67.173.123.48 04:27, 6 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>You're right, they were 19th, not 29th. I think I may have been hallucinating that particular day - not an unusual occurrence sometimes. Still, I don't think it's a notable enough achievement - it seems the athletic milestones section is becoming reserved for state championships, state records, and unusual achievements. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheirishpianist_3be6.html" title="User:Theirishpianist">Theirishpianist</a> 06:51, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>OK...I don't think a 14th-place finish at a state meet (boys cross country) is notable, and I think the girls' third-place finish this year is barely notable (and only for the reason indicated in the article). I'm really stretching with this one, but I implore anyone editing the athletics portion - NOT EVERY ATHLETIC RESULT IS NOTABLE.
