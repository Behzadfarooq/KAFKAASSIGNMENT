During the period from 1926 to 1943 he had more <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stolen_base.html" title="Stolen base">stolen bases</a> than any other player, leading the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_League_6b8d.html" title="American League">American League</a> four times. After twelve seasons, during which he <a href="../../../b/a/t/Batting_average.html" title="Batting average">batted</a> .302 and led the AL in <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assist_%28baseball%29.html" title="Assist (baseball)">assists</a> and <a href="../../../d/o/u/Double_play.html" title="Double play">double plays</a> twice each, he spent two years in the minor leagues and returned to the majors as a <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_League_1c21.html" title="National League">National League</a> <a href="../../../p/i/t/Pitcher.html" title="Pitcher">pitcher</a> for three seasons, becoming manager of the <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philadelphia_Phillies_8565.html" title="Philadelphia Phillies">Philadelphia Phillies</a>, his final team. Although he made his name as a fast, ferocious and hard-nosed player, that reputation was eclipsed by the racist role he played in <a href="../../../1/9/4/1947_in_baseball.html" title="1947 in baseball">1947</a> as manager of the Phillies, opposing the presence of <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jackie_Robinson_5b0c.html" title="Jackie Robinson">Jackie Robinson</a> on a major league team on the basis of Robinson's ethnicity.</p>
<p>Born in <a href="../../../n/a/s/Nashville%2C_Tennessee_0fa5.html" title="Nashville, Tennessee">Nashville, Tennessee</a>, Chapman batted and threw right-handed. He was a teammate of <a href="../../../b/a/b/Babe_Ruth_8c7f.html" title="Babe Ruth">Babe Ruth</a>, <a href="../../../l/o/u/Lou_Gehrig_2b64.html" title="Lou Gehrig">Lou Gehrig</a>, <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Dickey_c810.html" title="Bill Dickey">Bill Dickey</a>, <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joe_DiMaggio_29be.html" title="Joe DiMaggio">Joe DiMaggio</a> and other stars on the Yankees from 1930 through the middle of 1936. In his <a href="../../../1/9/3/1930_in_baseball.html" title="1930 in baseball">1930</a> rookie season with the Yankees, during which he batted .316, he played exclusively in the infield as a <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_baseman.html" title="Second baseman">second</a> and <a href="../../../t/h/i/Third_baseman.html" title="Third baseman">third baseman</a>; although he played only 91 games at third, he led the AL in <a href="../../../e/r/r/Error_%28baseball%29.html" title="Error (baseball)">errors</a>, and after <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joe_Sewell_59bc.html" title="Joe Sewell">Joe Sewell</a> was acquired in the offseason, Chapman was shifted to the outfield to take advantage of his speed and throwing arm. He led the AL in stolen bases for the next three seasons (1931-33); his <a href="../../../1/9/3/1931_in_baseball.html" title="1931 in baseball">1931</a> total of 61 was the highest by a Yankee since <a href="../../../f/r/i/Fritz_Maisel_e500.html" title="Fritz Maisel">Fritz Maisel</a>'s 74 in <a href="../../../1/9/1/1914_in_baseball.html" title="1914 in baseball">1914</a>, and would be the most by any major leaguer between 1921 and 1961 (though tied by <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Case_09ca.html" title="George Case">George Case</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/4/1943_in_baseball.html" title="1943 in baseball">1943</a>). With the Yankees, he also batted over .300 and scored 100 <a href="../../../r/u/n/Run_%28baseball%29.html" title="Run (baseball)">runs</a> four times each, <a href="../../../r/u/n/Run_batted_in.html" title="Run batted in">batted in</a> 100 runs twice, led the AL in <a href="../../../t/r/i/Triple_%28baseball%29.html" title="Triple (baseball)">triples</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/3/1934_in_baseball.html" title="1934 in baseball">1934</a>, and made each of the first three AL <a href="../../../m/a/j/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game_584d.html" title="Major League Baseball All-Star Game">All-Star</a> teams from 1933-35, leading off in the 1933 game as the first AL hitter in All-Star history. In the <a href="../../../1/9/3/1932_World_Series_bc76.html" title="1932 World Series">1932 World Series</a> he batted .294 with 6 runs batted in as the Yankees swept the <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago_Cubs_c37b.html" title="Chicago Cubs">Chicago Cubs</a>. In one game on <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_9.html" title="July 9">July 9</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/3/1932_in_baseball.html" title="1932 in baseball">1932</a> he had three <a href="../../../h/o/m/Home_run.html" title="Home run">home runs</a>, two of which were <a href="../../../i/n/s/Inside-the-park_home_run.html" title="Inside-the-park home run">inside-the-park</a>, and on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_30.html" title="May 30">May 30</a>, 1934 he broke up <a href="../../../d/e/t/Detroit_Tigers_a55b.html" title="Detroit Tigers">Detroit Tiger</a> <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earl_Whitehill_5945.html" title="Earl Whitehill">Earl Whitehill</a>'s <a href="../../../n/o/-/No-hitter.html" title="No-hitter">no-hitter</a> in the ninth inning, making it a one-hit <a href="../../../s/h/u/Shutout.html" title="Shutout">shutout</a>; the two had brawled during a 1933 game.</p>
<p>In June 1936, Chapman – then hitting .266 and expendable with the arrival of DiMaggio – was traded to the <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minnesota_Twins_4085.html" title="Minnesota Twins">Washington Senators</a>; he rebounded to finish the year with a .315 average, again making the All-Star team and scoring 100 runs, and collecting a career-high 50 <a href="../../../d/o/u/Double_%28baseball%29.html" title="Double (baseball)">doubles</a>. In June 1937 the Senators sent him to the <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston_Red_Sox_8ec5.html" title="Boston Red Sox">Boston Red Sox</a>, and he led the AL in steals for the fourth time with 35. The following year he hit a career-best .340 with Boston, after which he was traded to the <a href="../../../c/l/e/Cleveland_Indians_918e.html" title="Cleveland Indians">Cleveland Indians</a>. After seasons hitting .290 and .286, Cleveland sent him back to Washington in December 1940; he hit .255 with the Senators before they released him in May 1941, and after he batted only .226 with the <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago_White_Sox_cecb.html" title="Chicago White Sox">Chicago White Sox</a> over the remainder of the year, his major league career appeared to be finished.</p>
<p>But after managing in the Class B <a href="../../../p/i/e/Piedmont_League_7c7a.html" title="Piedmont League">Piedmont League</a> in 1942 and 1944 - he was suspended for the 1943 season for punching an <a href="../../../u/m/p/Umpire_%28baseball%29.html" title="Umpire (baseball)">umpire</a> - Chapman resurfaced, following brief <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a> military service, as a pitcher in the National League with the <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles_Dodgers_bc90.html" title="Los Angeles Dodgers">Brooklyn Dodgers</a> in 1944, earning 5 <a href="../../../w/i/n/Win_%28baseball%29.html" title="Win (baseball)">wins</a> against 3 losses. After starting the next year 3-3, he was traded to the Phillies on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_15.html" title="June 15">June 15</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/4/1945_in_baseball.html" title="1945 in baseball">1945</a>, becoming player-manager on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_30.html" title="June 30">June 30</a>. He made three relief appearances for the team that year, and played his final game in <a href="../../../1/9/4/1946_in_baseball.html" title="1946 in baseball">1946</a> with one inning of relief. He appeared in 1,717 games over 15 seasons, batting .302 lifetime with 287 stolen bases (including 15 of home), 1,144 runs, 90 home runs, 407 doubles, 107 triples and 977 RBI, and winning eight of 14 decisions as a pitcher; his 184 steals with the Yankees placed him second in team history behind <a href="../../../h/a/l/Hal_Chase_1b6f.html" title="Hal Chase">Hal Chase</a>.</p>
<p>With the Phillies buried in last place in 1945 (winners of only 17 of 68 games), Chapman replaced <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freddie_Fitzsimmons_9171.html" title="Freddie Fitzsimmons">Freddie Fitzsimmons</a> as manager. The team improved somewhat through the end of the year, and climbed to fifth place in 1946, the first year of the postwar baseball boom and the last season in which the <a href="../../../b/a/s/Baseball_color_line.html" title="Baseball color line">color line</a> was in force. In April 1947, Brooklyn called up Robinson from the <a href="../../../m/o/n/Montreal_Royals_813f.html" title="Montreal Royals">Montreal Royals</a> and made him their regular <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_baseman.html" title="First baseman">first baseman</a>: he was the first <a href="../../../a/f/r/African-American_b405.html" title="African-American">African-American</a> to play in the major leagues in more than 60 years. Chapman's Phillies were hardly the only NL team to vehemently oppose integration - several Dodger players had tried to petition management to keep him off the team - but during an early-season series in Brooklyn, the level of verbal abuse directed by Chapman and his players at Robinson reached such proportions that it made headlines in the New York and national press. Chapman instructed his pitchers, whenever they had a 3-0 count against Robinson, to bean him rather than throw a ball and walk him. As it turned out, Chapman's attempts to intimidate Robinson backfired with the Dodgers ralling behind Robinson, and there was increased sympathy for him in many circles. The backlash against Chapman was so severe that he asked to pose in a photograph with Robinson when the two teams next met in Philadelphia in May (in the photo, the two do not shake hands; they hold opposite ends of a baseball bat).</p>
<p>Robinson went on to stardom and a ten-year career, a place in the <a href="../../../b/a/s/Baseball_Hall_of_Fame_4e80.html" title="Baseball Hall of Fame">Baseball Hall of Fame</a>, and a revered position in American sporting and <a href="../../../c/i/v/Civil_rights.html" title="Civil rights">civil rights</a> circles. Chapman's baseball career, however, was coming to an end. He survived the 1947 season, but the Phils fell to seventh place. In July <a href="../../../1/9/4/1948_in_baseball.html" title="1948 in baseball">1948</a>, with the team still in seventh, Chapman was fired and eventually replaced by <a href="../../../e/d/d/Eddie_Sawyer_a8aa.html" title="Eddie Sawyer">Eddie Sawyer</a>. He would surface one more time in the majors, as a coach for the 1952 <a href="../../../c/i/n/Cincinnati_Reds_7554.html" title="Cincinnati Reds">Cincinnati Reds</a>.</p>
<p>Chapman's career major league managing record was 196-276 (.415%). He died of a heart attack at age 84 at his home in <a href="../../../h/o/o/Hoover%2C_Alabama_9b4e.html" title="Hoover, Alabama">Hoover, Alabama</a>.</p>
