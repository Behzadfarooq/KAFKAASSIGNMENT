<p>Isherwood was born in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_City_1428.html" title="New York City">New York City</a>. He worked for the <a href="../../../u/t/i/Utica_and_Schenectady_Railroad_6c94.html" title="Utica and Schenectady Railroad">Utica and Schenectady Railroad</a> and trained under William C. Young, one of the most prominent engineers of that period. Isherwood then worked on the <a href="../../../c/r/o/Croton_Aqueduct_19f5.html" title="Croton Aqueduct">Croton Aqueduct</a>, followed by an engineering job on the <a href="../../../e/r/i/Erie_Canal_7b21.html" title="Erie Canal">Erie Canal</a>.

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/n/Benjamin_F._Isherwood_b846.html" title="Edit section: Early Naval career">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Early Naval career</span></h2>
<p>At the age of 22, Isherwood was appointed First Assistant Engineer in the Navy <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_23.html" title="May 23">23 May</a> <a href="../../../1/8/4/1844.html" title="1844">1844</a>. During the Mexican War, he served in <a href="../../../u/s/s/USS_Princeton_%281843%29_613a.html" title="USS Princeton (1843)"><i>Princeton</i></a> and later was senior engineer of <a href="../../../u/s/s/USS_Spitfire_%281846%29_2f71.html" title="USS Spitfire (1846)"><i>Spitfire</i></a>.</p>
<p>When the Mexican War ended, Isherwood was assigned to the <a href="../../../w/a/s/Washington_Navy_Yard_20e3.html" title="Washington Navy Yard">Washington Navy Yard</a>, where he assisted <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Stuart_8d6a.html" title="Charles Stuart">Charles Stuart</a> in designing engines and experiments with steam as a source of power for propelling ships. Throughout the 1850s, Isherwood compiled operational and performance data from steam engines in U.S. and foreign commercial vessels and warships. He used these empirical data to analyze the efficiency of engine types then in use.</p>
<p>In the twelve years between the Mexican War and the Civil War, Isherwood published 55 technical and scientific articles on steam engineering and vessel propulsion in the prestigious <i>Journal of the <a href="../../../f/r/a/Franklin_Institute_7a5b.html" title="Franklin Institute">Franklin Institute</a></i>. In 1859 the engineer published the results of his own original thermodynamic experiments in the two-volume <i>Engineering Precedents for Steam Machinery</i>. Isherwood was the nation's most prolific antebellum technical writer.</p>
<p>Isherwood went to sea during the period between the wars, serving as Chief Engineer of the steam <a href="../../../f/r/i/Frigate.html" title="Frigate">frigate</a> <a href="../../../u/s/s/USS_San_Jacinto_%281850%29_9cab.html" title="USS San Jacinto (1850)"><i>San Jacinto</i></a> on a cruise of more than 3 years on the <a href="../../../a/s/i/Asiatic_Station_6a48.html" title="Asiatic Station">Asiatic Station</a>. During this cruise he was stricken with <a href="../../../d/y/s/Dysentery.html" title="Dysentery">dysentery</a>, prompting his return to the United States.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/n/Benjamin_F._Isherwood_b846.html" title="Edit section: Civil War">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Civil War</span></h2>
<p>Shortly after the outbreak of the Civil War, Isherwood was appointed Engineer-in-Chief of the Navy, and so important were his services considered that the Bureau of Steam Engineering was created under his direction.</p>
<p>When the Civil War began, the Navy had 28 steam vessels, and during the war, the number grew to 600. Isherwood conducted the design and construction of the machinery necessary to accomplish this. He designed ships that were fast enough to pursue the <a href="../../../b/l/o/Blockade_runner.html" title="Blockade runner">blockade runners</a>.</p>
<p>In 1863 and 1865, Isherwood published the first and second volumes of <i>Experimental Researches in Steam Engineering</i>, which were translated into six languages and became a standard engineering text upon which future steam experimentation was based.</p>
<p><a name="Post-war_activities" id="Post-war_activities"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/n/Benjamin_F._Isherwood_b846.html" title="Edit section: Post-war activities">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Post-war activities</span></h2>
<p>Immediately upon the conclusion of the war, Isherwood was principally involved with organizing a new scientific curriculum for steam engineering at the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Naval_Academy_cecc.html" title="United States Naval Academy">United States Naval Academy</a> at <a href="../../../a/n/n/Annapolis.html" title="Annapolis">Annapolis</a>. By 1874, naval engineers refined this curriculum to the point that it served as the model for mechanical engineering education at most American universities.</p>
<p>In 1869 Isherwood ran afoul of former <a href="../../../u/s/s/USS_Spitfire_%281846%29_2f71.html" title="USS Spitfire (1846)"><i>Spitfire</i></a> shipmate Admiral <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Dixon_Porter_17d8.html" title="David Dixon Porter">David Dixon Porter</a>. During the war years Isherwood led a campaign to increase the rank and influence of engineering officers in the navy. Porter opposed this change in the service's class structure. After the inauguration of <a href="../../../u/l/y/Ulysses_Grant_a14c.html" title="Ulysses Grant">Ulysses Grant</a>, Isherwood's longtime patron, Secretary of the Navy <a href="../../../g/i/d/Gideon_Welles_6861.html" title="Gideon Welles">Gideon Welles</a>, could no longer protect him. Admiral Porter banished Isherwood to the Mare Island Navy Yard in <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Francisco_a4a4.html" title="San Francisco">San Francisco</a>.</p>
<p>Despite his diminshed stature, Isherwood continued to produce technical innovations. In 1870 and 1871, Isherwood conducted experiments that resulted in a <a href="../../../p/r/o/Propeller.html" title="Propeller">propeller</a> that was used by the Navy for the next 27 years.</p>
<p>He was a pioneer in the production of fast <a href="../../../c/r/u/Cruiser.html" title="Cruiser">cruisers</a>, producing this class against strong opposition. Following a tour of European dockyards, he became president of the Experimental Board under the Bureau of Steam Engineering until his retirement <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_6.html" title="October 6">6 October</a> <a href="../../../1/8/8/1884.html" title="1884">1884</a>.</p>
<p>Isherwood died in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_City_1428.html" title="New York City">New York City</a> at the age of 92.</p>
<p><a name="Legacy" id="Legacy"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/e/n/Benjamin_F._Isherwood_b846.html" title="Edit section: Legacy">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Legacy</span></h2>
<p>The Navy has recognized Isherwood's contributions in various ways. The steam engineering building at the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Naval_Academy_cecc.html" title="United States Naval Academy">United States Naval Academy</a> in <a href="../../../a/n/n/Annapolis%2C_Maryland_8650.html" title="Annapolis, Maryland">Annapolis, Maryland</a>, is named "Isherwood Hall" in his honor.</p>
<p>The Rear Admiral Benjamin F. Isherwood Award is awarded by the Navy to recognize "innovation and expertise in the effective assessment, development, execution, or deployment of technological solutions for operational Fleet needs."</p>
<p>Two ships have been named <a href="../../../u/s/s/USS_Isherwood_91aa.html" title="USS Isherwood">USS <i>Isherwood</i></a> for him.</p>
<p>In a 1941 article in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Naval_Institute_fc17.html" title="United States Naval Institute">United States Naval Institute</a>'s <i>Proceedings</i>, George W. Dyson stated that Isherwood might possibly be the greatest engineer the United States Navy had developed.</p>
<p>The revolutionary engineering program initiated by Isherwood at the U.S. Naval Academy became the template for professional American mechanical engineering education. That basic curriculum designed at Annapolis in the late 1860s and early 1870s still serves as the core of university mechanical engineering pedagogy.</p>
