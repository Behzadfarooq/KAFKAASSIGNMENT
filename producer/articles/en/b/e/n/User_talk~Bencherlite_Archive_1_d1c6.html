<p>8. Talk Page of pages that do not exist, unless they contain deletion discussion that isn't logged elsewhere. Subpages (including archive pages) are only deletable under this rule if the corresponding top-level page does not exist.

<p>Hi there - thought I'd pick your brains about this one. I reverted some vandalistic changes by two different anonymous users at People in quick succession, then went to leave warning messages at their talk pages. When I came to the second one, I found that you had left the warning there (unsigned, btw). I'm sure I've seen somewhere that the usual procedure is to let the reverting editor leave the warning, but I can't find that in a WP policy off-hand. Do you know whether there is such a policy? My experience (admittedly from only a few days of anti-vandalism fun) seem to suggest that that's how things are usually done, possibly because some people can do more things at once with their tools, but you may well know more than I do. (Just to be clear, I'm not bothered about missing out on leaving one warning - just wondered if there is a protocol for these things). TTFN Bencherlite 02:22, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'm going to break this up
<ul>
<li>Thanks for your work</li>
<li>Thanks for noticing it was unsigned comment I make mistakes</li>
<li>I have slightly more experience than you but not much more. I normally fix up <a href="../../../a/i/r/WP%7EAIR_f7cf.html" title="WP:AIR">WP:AIR</a> (Wiki Project Aircraft) and have checked recent changes on and off, but not really that much til' this week.</li>
<li>There isn't a policy I know of. There probably is one though. It might just be an essay. It is standard etiquette. A lot of people do whatever they can, but sometimes they cut you off. When I did that I got confused between Pop-Tarts and People. I tried to revert people but you already did. Then I fixed pop tarts. Then I hit back to go and fix up the people who messed up Pop-Tarts. Instead I left the message in People. So that's my fault. I know how it feels.</li>
<li>On a second thought it is procedure in <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVANDALISM_fbc5.html" title="WP:VANDALISM">WP:VANDALISM</a> for only one person to do it. Read the vandalism procedure. It says what to do in order implying that once you fix vandalism it's yours to fix unless you need the help of an admin. (Which I'm definitely not} So you are right they imply it strongly but I don't thing they really wrote it directly anywhere. And yes: with tools you can do everything at once w/ just about 3 clicks. Believe me I have seen a video of the software before. Don't go around yelling at people saying that it is your right, but you can leave a message on their talk page and kindly say whatever you think is best. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedskunk_9f8f.html" title="User:Redskunk">RedSkunk</a> 03:07, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I don't get what you mean by "after leaving the above (d'oh!)" Anyways I'm sure I've found another Wikifriend! See you around. BTW you have more edits than I do <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedskunk_9f8f.html" title="User:Redskunk">RedSkunk</a> 03:19, 15 February 2007 (UTC)

<p>Because of this new vandalism I felt like putting a new userbox on my page. This is what I have so far. Any input? <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedskunk_9f8f.html" title="User:Redskunk">RedSkunk</a> 20:04, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>How's that. I count myself as british, not scottish. I just went to university there. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedskunk_9f8f.html" title="User:Redskunk">RedSkunk</a></p>
<p>Sorry for wasting the time but I think I won't use it, but you never know!?!? <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedskunk_9f8f.html" title="User:Redskunk">RedSkunk</a> 20:33, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>It's hard for me to use babel. I've lost a lot of my (British) accent.&#160;:( I picked up some scottish accent and some American accent. Essentially I sound <b>REALLY</b> weird. Do you know a userbox like "This user has a very very strange accent" or an "undistinguishable" accent. Do you know if there is one? <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedskunk_9f8f.html" title="User:Redskunk">RedSkunk</a> 20:56, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>And thanks from me for the fine edit of the troublesome first sentence in the Wolf Larson article. I was blanking on how to fix it. I Still might change the word "stationed." That word is usually associated with military personnel, and it seems his dad was really a university prof or something like that. Actually, the entire article needs work. The writer goes overboard with using Mr. Larson's first name to start almost every sentence. I'll work on it someday.

<dd>Yeah. I gave him a level one warning saying he needed to source it and he got <i>really</i> mad.

<p>Thanks. Just ask if you want a sig&#160;:) I've been around and have seen more. (I think) though you have reverted more vandalism and done more cleanup.

(See talk page) Now I've got an angry person/IP adress after me and I don't know if they're the same or not. It's suspicious...

<p>Hey, I was wondering if there is anyway to look up categories that already exist... like an index of all the categories out there that have been created by others. I've been trying to categorize my article and the only way that I was able to do so, was to look at articles about similar topics and seeing if I can fit mine into one of their categories. This has worked to some degree but I thought I'd be better if I can put it in all/most of the right categories out there and perhaps do the same to other articles. I've cheked the wikipedia article on categories and couldn't find such a thing except a list of recently created categories.

<p>Thanks for adding all those articles! I was thinking about the de-linking you did on the unrelated article, and whether if they showed up on the 'recent changes' tool we could keep track on any organ related information that appears by people not finding the correct link. You may be right though and as long as the disambig links are clear enough, this should happen, or would be noticed by editors of that page.</p>
<p>On another note, I have suggested that we hold of linking the organists in <a href="../../../o/r/g/Category%7EOrganists_e855.html" title="Category:Organists">Category:Organists</a> until we can categorize them properly - it seems a bit of a mess. It will be easier to edit and note the links in one go rather than having to go through every organist two or three times. I have started a discussion on the project talk page so we can all agree first.</p>

<dd>Hi. I noticed that you asked whether <a href="../../../d/u/d/Dudley_Buck_6ecf.html" title="Dudley Buck">Dudley Buck</a> was a cathedral organist or not. I have probably been going against my own rules, but have used discretion in cases like this and included organists of large-ish/ or many parish churches in this category as well, not just for cathedrals. I know this might create problems, but save another Category:Church organists it kind of seemed logical! <a href="../../../m/d/c/User%7EMdcollins1984_1ad6.html" title="User:Mdcollins1984">MDCollins</a> (<i><a href="../../../m/d/c/User_talk%7EMdcollins1984_5836.html" title="User talk:Mdcollins1984">talk</a></i>) 11:52, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You two wrote me some positive comments following some editing I did last week on the Wiki article "Hendrik Niehoff" <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hendrik_Niehoff" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hendrik_Niehoff" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hendrik_Niehoff</a> As you may have discovered, I do not know very much about carrying out helpful upgrades to the Wiki website, so I ask you for help.</p>
<p>Since the previous Niehoff update, I have done considerably more updating. For example, in the meantime I've added a digital photo I took of the great organ Niehoff built for the Johanniskirche in LÃ¼neburg. I took that photo, there is no copyrite problem. But I would like to go further and add a group of photos showing more of Niehoff's work to that webpage. These will come from scans from several books, none of which to my knowledge are copyrighted. I do NOT want to invade the co pyrites, so I ask you to tell me what the limits are - how you can be sure the books are not protected at this time.</p>
<p>The one book is Maarten Albert Vente's "Die Brabanter Orgel" that was last published in 1963 and has no notice of a copyrite when published and Dr. Vente (a very close friend of mine) died in 1989. There are several good photos there from which I have prepared decent scans.</p>
<p>The other book is Jan van Biezen's "Het Nederlandse Orgel in de Renaissance en de Barok, in het Bijzonder de School van Jan van Covelens" that was published in 1995 with <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 90-6375-154-0</a> geb. Again, I do not see notice that this is copyrighted - unless I simply do not understand the Dutch. I have no means of contact with Heer van Biezen to enable discussion on this with him, and I do not want to do anything against the extremely valuable publication he has provided to us. Does anyone have information that will say how far I dare go by adding digital scans for this book to the Niehoff website.</p>
<p>Thank any of you for whatever information you can give me on these matters. IF the results you send are positive, I will glad to continue providing information I have on organ history and construction to the Wikipedia website.</p>

<dd>Sadly, I suspect that the answer is that the photos in the book are protected by Dutch copyright law, even if there's not actually a copyright indication in the book, since the book was published too recently for it to be in the public domain. There's a page at Wikipedia:Copyright FAQ which might help explain WP's approach to copyright issues. Question 1 is "Can I add something to Wikipedia that I got from somewhere else? and the answer is "In general, no. Most of the content people want to add is copyrighted, although some work has been made available by authors under an appropriate license (see below), and some work is in the public domain (see below). The absence of a copyright notice does not mean that a work may be freely used."</dd>
<dd>We will have to see if we can find some public domain photographs through the project - failing that, time to go on holiday and take our cameras!</dd>
<dd>I didn't reply by email as I prefer not to use my main (work) email for WP purposes, and I so rarely use my home email that it would be a pain to start to use it again for WP only! I'll leave a copy of this message on Mdcollins' page too. Best wishes, Bencherlite 01:46, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm afraid that, even though I am unsure about copyrighting, that Bencherlite is sadly right - as far as I know, book covers are ok, for referring to that book only, but for images contained within, I'd be very surprised if it was allowed.</dd>
<dd>Also, although John Brombaugh is well written and potentially a very good article, I'd advise you to read Wikipedia:Autobiography just to bring to your attention some concerns people may have. âMDCollins (talk) 08:54, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thank you for the above information. As you see, I don't know really how the Wikipedia works nor really the best way to respond back to either of you. I guess you guys are about the only ones reading this unless others want to come check your user pages.</p>
<p>Anyway, from what I see, I think it is best that we return both the Niehoff and JB articles back to what they were so there is no question about ethics or copyrights. This is one reason why you see so little in the regular organ magazines on my work because to get it in there requires that one toot ones own horn; I'd prefer to let history do that instead. The single reason why I was interested in making the alterations to both articles is because I know how difficult the historical surveys like Vente and van Biezen do to bring us more accurate information: they can no longer talk with the people they are writing about, so they don't necessarily have very reliable information. But history can worry about that. I'll remove the photo of the LÃ¼neburg organ and make other changes as much as possible so both articles are as much like I saw them about two weeks ago - except that I'll remove the information about myself that was in the Niehoff article written by someone else. I like the idea that you do all this with your camera to avoid the many problems you've pointed out. (I will carry out my part in making those reverse changes in the next day or so.)</p>

<p>Kudos on working on the harp cats. Thankfully the harp isn't as popular as the guitar so we don't have to worry about pages and pages of names in the main categories. Although I would say her training was classical (I think she studied some Salzedo stuff as well) LeBaron resides in the "new/avant-garde music" world, and is thus hard to categorize, as her work is ostensibly <a href="../../../c/o/n/Contemporary_classical.html" title="Contemporary classical">contemporary classical</a> but she also plays rock with a distortion pedal (and slide!) as well as free improvised music. She probably also does some jazz, though I'm not sure whether she does any straight-ahead stuff (soloing over changes, etc.) the way other better known jazz harpists do. And she's influenced by world musics such as Korean <a href="../../../k/a/y/Kayagum.html" title="Kayagum">kayagum</a> music. So which category she should go in? Unlike most harpists, who specialize in a genre such as Celtic or classical, I think LeBaron is primarily concerned with her own compositions (as well as the work she does with her improvisation ensemble), and as such is quite an eclectic musician. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadagnani_11ed.html" title="User:Badagnani">Badagnani</a> 12:29, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I just read the <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harpo_Marx_34e0.html" title="Harpo Marx">Harpo Marx</a> article. Fascinating. I suppose he played mostly in a classical style as I don't remember him doing ragtime, blues, or anything of the sort. I don't understand why the strings would have broken if he had tuned it up properly; in fact, I don't understand the whole bit about how he had mistuned it. If he tuned it up a few steps to the proper pitch I don't see how that would have thrown him off. By the way, <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andreas_Vollenweider_01df.html" title="Andreas Vollenweider">Andreas Vollenweider</a> doesn't have any type of harp cat, and I have no idea how that happened. He could be a bit hard to classify as well. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadagnani_11ed.html" title="User:Badagnani">Badagnani</a> 12:37, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
