<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/a/Baa_Baa_Black_Sheep_%28TV_series%29_8b93.html" title="Edit section: Fiction versus reality">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Fiction versus reality</span></h2>
<p>"Pappy" Boyington is the squadron-leader of a group of fighter pilots stationed on an island in the Pacific, during World War II. Pappy often intercedes in altercations at the base, but everyone seems to pull together when they are assigned missions in the air.</p>
<p>The series premise was very loosely based on a portion of the real-life military career of <a href="../../../p/a/p/Pappy_Boyington_3d2d.html" title="Pappy Boyington">Gregory Boyington</a>, known as "Pappy" due to his "advanced" age compared to the younger pilots under his command (he was 30 when he took command of VMF-214). The premise is misleading, in that the "Black Sheep" were not misfits or screwups. Boyington, who was a technical advisor for the series, commented that this was "fiction based on reality" and that no regular character in the series except for himself actually existed.</p>
<p>Popular character "Hutch" (Joey Aresco) was killed off during the second season, to be replaced as chief mechanic by "Micklin" (<a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_West_f9b6.html" title="Red West">Red West</a>). West appears on cover of the Volume 1 DVD collection, though he had not joined the cast during the first season.</p>
<p>At an aviation history symposium in 2002, members of the real VMF-214 were asked about the authenticity of the TV series. Retired Colonel Henry A. McCartney said the list of errors was too long to repeat. Among other things he observed, "On the show they had these marvelous conversations on the radio when I hardly ever remember a radio that worked." Speaking of flying technique, he opined that the movie pilots made "transport" landings on the main wheels whereas "A real Corsair pilot three-pointed that airplane if he had any self respect." However, during the time frame of the series (1943), the Corsair was in fact landed as shown, due to design problems with the early landing gear oleo struts. LCDR William N. Leonard, serving alongside the Marine Corsair squadron on Guadalcanal during 1943, reported that Corsair pilots landed "fast and tail high to remedy the bounce . . .you land full stall, then raise the tail and run-out on the main gear." [<i>CORSAIR,</i> Barrett Tillman, Naval Institute Press pg 17]</p>
<p>It should be noted that three-point landings in the Corsair were one factor in the above-average number of landing accidents experienced by units flying the F4U (especially early models), and were prohibited in a number of squadrons. Aware of this history, wheel landings are used by most private owners to protect the rare and valuable warbirds.</p>
<p>Other panelists noted the show's absence of gunsights, oxygen masks, and gloves.</p>
<p>Another retired officer smiled when he said, "If we'd had what they did on that show--decent chow, quonsets instead of tents, and hot and cold running nurses, I'd still be out there!" While the nurses are unrealistically portrayed, the series shows the pilots to be in tents (the officers' club is in a Quonset) and several episodes featured complaints about the food by one character or another.</p>
<p>Critics have noted that the planes used in the series had a number of different paint schemes. In fact, this is authentic. There were several paint schemes used by the Marines and the Navy during this period, and as newer planes replaced losses, they would arrive with the colors and markings which were in effect at the time that the plane was last painted. In addition, planes were transferred between units as needed, and painting was a low priority, thus a single flight might have planes with markings from two or three squadrons.</p>
<p>Other inaccuracies include the haircuts worn by the pilots. United States Marines have always been noted for their close-cropped hair, and pilots especially prefer short hair due to the discomfort created by long hair under flying helmets. One pilot in the third (final) season wore his hair in a long, late 1970s style intended to attract younger viewers, but which would not have been tolerated by any Marine commanding officer.</p>
<p>Likewise, the attitude openly displayed by Sergeant Micklin toward Major Boyington would have resulted in a rapid change of chief mechanic, and any officer who engaged in a fistfight with a sergeant to prove who was in charge would have been relieved as unfit to command.</p>
<p>Some subtle details were surprisingly accurate. One episode featured a visit to the Black Sheep by a movie star, based on the real-life <a href="../../../t/e/d/Ted_Williams_64ed.html" title="Ted Williams">Ted Williams</a>, who left major league baseball to fly Corsairs in the Pacific. During the visit (largely a publicity stunt, unlike Williams' real-life tours of duty) Boyington mentions that "kill flags" were only put on for publicity photos -- and removed before combat sorties -- because they attract extra attention from the enemy.</p>

<ul>
<li>Although the title <i>Baa Baa Black Sheep</i> comes from a <a href="../../../b/a/a/Baa%2C_Baa%2C_Black_Sheep_%28nursery_rhyme%29_ec6a.html" title="Baa, Baa, Black Sheep (nursery rhyme)">nursery rhyme</a>, the song heard at the beginning of the opening credits is actually the chorus to <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Whiffenpoofs_fb72.html" title="The Whiffenpoofs">The Whiffenpoof Song</a></i>, the "official" song of Yale University, written in 1909 as a parody of <a href="../../../r/u/d/Rudyard_Kipling_8a10.html" title="Rudyard Kipling">Rudyard Kipling</a>'s poem <i>Gentlemen-Rankers</i>.</li>
<li>The name of the island where the real-life Black Sheep were stationed was Vella la Vella, in the Solomon Islands of the southern Pacific, known as <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Slot_134b.html" title="The Slot">The Slot</a></i>; this was changed to Vella la Cava in the series for legal reasons.</li>
<li>The <a href="../../../c/h/a/Channel_Islands_of_California_7326.html" title="Channel Islands of California">Channel Islands</a> off the coast of <a href="../../../s/o/u/Southern_California_3bf5.html" title="Southern California">Southern California</a> provided an adequate substitute backdrop for flying scenes.</li>
<li>Filming of airfield scenes was primarily done at (the now closed) <a href="http://members.tripod.com/airfields_freeman/CA/Airfields_CA_SanFernan.htm#indiandunes" class="external text" title="http://members.tripod.com/airfields_freeman/CA/Airfields_CA_SanFernan.htm#indiandunes" rel="nofollow">Indian Dunes Airport</a> in Valencia, California. Occasionally, modern trucks can be seen passing in the background.</li>
<li>The <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chance_Vought_71ec.html" title="Chance Vought">Chance Vought</a> <a href="../../../f/4/u/F4U_Corsair_27dd.html" title="F4U Corsair">F4U Corsair</a> fighter planes were leased to Universal Studios by private owners. Many scenes showing repairs on the aircraft were filmed during actual preventative maintenance.</li>
<li>"Japanese" aircraft used in the series were actually American planes, which had been modified to resemble Japanese planes for the film <i><a href="../../../t/o/r/Tora%21_Tora%21_Tora%21_0204.html" title="Tora! Tora! Tora!">Tora! Tora! Tora!</a></i> and later purchased by collectors.</li>
<li>The <a href="../../../g/r/u/Grumman_J2F_Duck_7a0f.html" title="Grumman J2F Duck">Grumman J2F Duck</a> float biplane belonged to legendary stunt pilot <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frank_Tallman_d582.html" title="Frank Tallman">Frank Tallman</a> and his Tallmanz Aviation museum in <a href="../../../s/a/n/Santa_Ana%2C_California_893f.html" title="Santa Ana, California">Santa Ana, California</a>. Tallman often stated that this was his all-time favorite plane to fly, with the Corsair in a near-tie. Tallmantz provided or arranged for most of the aircraft used in the series.</li>
<li>Some air-battle scenes were actually short clips from the 1969 film <i><a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Britain_2389.html" title="Battle of Britain">Battle of Britain</a></i>, and German markings on the planes can clearly be seen. Other flying scenes pioneered the technique of mounting cameras on helmets worn by pilots, thus providing a pilot's-eye view never before seen in films featuring single-seat aircraft.</li>
<li>The pilot episode was shown as a stand-alone TV movie "Flying Misfits" through the 1980s and 1990s.</li>
<li>Due to reflections from the Plexiglas canopies, many close-ups were shot with the canopies removed.</li>
<li>During filming of the series, Gregory Boyington met Masajiro "Mike" Kawato, the one-time Japanese fighter pilot who claimed to have shot him down in 1943. It was later asserted that Kawato's claims were not true. Though Kawato's personnel records show that he had, in fact, been involved in the aerial battle, details that he provided of the action indicated that he had been involved in a different part of the fight.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></li>
