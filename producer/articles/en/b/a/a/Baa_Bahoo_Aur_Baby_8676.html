<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/a/Baa_Bahoo_Aur_Baby_8676.html" title="Edit section: Characters">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Characters</span></h2>
<p><b>Godavari "Baa" Thakkar</b> The matriarch of the family, she has brought up her children with an iron fist, and without the help of her husband Labhshankar. She is set in her ways, and is very determined, but she always thinks of her family before anything else. She is idolised by Arvind, her eldest son, and the only person who is not scared of her and her methods is Baby AKA Radhika Thakkar, her youngest child.</p>
<p><b>Labhshankar Thakkar</b> The artistic yet highly unhelpful husband of Godavari Thakkar, Labhshankar is a drunkard who, when the family lived in poverty (his children were pre-teen), did nothing to help and never got a job. Because of this he is despised by his eldest son, Arvind, who lost his childhood as he tried to help his mother in bringing up his brothers and sisters. Has improved recently with the increased involvement in Gattu's and Saumil's welfare, but his old habits remain.</p>
<p><b>Arvind Thakkar</b> The eldest child of Godavari &amp; Labhshankar, Arvind despises his father for ruining his childhood. He is a spoilsport, as well as an over-sensitive and boring person. When asked to dress up for a fancy dress party as part of Saumil's first wish, he put on a different coloured checked shirt, and waved his hand frantically. Upon being asked who he was pretending to be by his confused wife and daughter, he got angry and said he was the insurance broker he shares his desk with. Has an annoying, and rather frightening habit of grunting "hah" whenever someone says anything funny or remotely interesting. Only listens to Baa.</p>
<p><b>Leela Thakkar</b> The lively and daydreaming wife of Arvind. Liked by everyone, she is always jovial and ready for a good old gossip. She and her younger sister-in-law or <i><b>devrani</b></i> Pravina are always hatching schemes against Baa's wishes to try and modernise the house or get out of doing work. Fashion-conscious and educated, she wishes to move to America one day and see her daughter Dimple happily married to Anish. Often clashes with her sister-in-law Charubala, who lives in the town (as opposed to the Thakkar's in the suburbs) and tries to glorify this superior lifestyle in every way.</p>
<p><b>Dimple Thakkar</b> The modern, free-spirited daughter of Arvind &amp; Leela, Dimple one day wishes to be free of the ridiculous restrictions imposed upon her by her father. She is very much a family girl however. She in love with Anish, a rich <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indian.html" title="Indian">Indian</a> from America.</p>
<p><b>Jigar Thakkar</b> Son of leela &amp; arvind Thakkar.Studies at manipal university away from home</p>
<p><b>Pravin Thakkar</b> The second child of the family, Pravin's first and only love is money. He never contributes to any money-related crises, but will always grab a chance at <i>making</i> money. Owns a small sari(dress) business. Because of his tight-fistedness his wife Pravina and brother Subodh often con him into giving money to them for family purposes.</p>
<p><b>Pravina Thakkar</b> Pravina, the wife of Pravin, is the prankster of the family. She is always trying to get her brothers- and sisters-in-law, especially Meenakshi, into trouble with her schemes. Her authentic <a href="../../../g/u/j/Gujarati.html" title="Gujarati">Gujarati</a> accent immediately makes her one of the comedians of the show, and she obliges. Falters only in front of Baa, who eventually finds out what she has done. Called "bhulakad" or forgetful person by her family as she never seems to remember what needs to be done, but only what must be done next to change the Thakkar lifestyle.</p>
<p><b>Mehul, Mitali &amp; Chaitali</b> The children of Pravin &amp; Pravina, Mehul and Mitali are in their early teens, and Chaitali is around ten. Mehul is an average student who always gets on the wrong side of his father, sometimes deliberately. Mitali plays with the other kids but is fairly quiet. Chaitali is called "choti (small) Pravina" by Baa because of her cheekiness and her control freakery.</p>
<p><b>Subodh Thakkar</b> The third child, he is an actor. He is fun-loving and good to the core. Often helps Pravina in her schemes.</p>
<p><b>Meenakshi Thakkar</b> The dopey and deeply religious wife of Subodh, Meenakshi believes in fasting (almost every day), crying (constantly) and doing everything (albeit unintentionally it seems) incredibly slowly, earning her the sarcastic nickname "<a href="../../../k/o/l/Kolkata.html" title="Kolkata">Kolkata</a> Express" from Pravina. Drives her family mad with her uncontrollable crying, and complete lack of understanding of the outside world.</p>
<p><b>Mansukhlal (Manav)Thakkar</b> Child of Subodh &amp; Meenakshi, he plays with the other kids. He doesn't really feature in the series.</p>
<p><b>Harshad Thakkar</b> The fourth child. He is a doctor, and has been forced out of the house by Baa, as she thought the rest of the family was taking him for granted and not standing upon their own two feet, because he was always there to sort out their problems for them. A doctor, he is loyal and helpful.</p>
<p><b>Shilpa Thakkar</b> The wife of Harshad Thakkar.,she is a doctor by profession</p>
<p><b>Saloni Thakkar</b> The older child of Harshad, she is kind and jovial. Has not really featured yet.</p>
<p><b>Saumil Thakkar</b> The eight-year old son of Harshad, he has brain tumor. Because of this, Harshad returned to the Thakkar house to seek moral support from the rest of his family. A very intelligent child, he has a liking for writing poems. He asked for 5 wishes before he passed away. He told no one of his fifth wish, until near his death.</p>
<p><b>Charubala Bhayani</b> The fifth child. Egoistic and disillusioned by her husband's money, Charubala lives in the town, which she makes sure she impresses upon her family members every time she sees them. The only person who finds her husband's jokes funny. Has a double, a maid (Prema), who was employed by Pravina as a joke.</p>
<p><b>Tushar Bhayani</b> The infuriating husband of Charubala, he cracks painful jokes which only he and his wife find funny. Seems to have no purpose in life apart from annoying his in-laws. No one can stand him, but he has proved himself useful in difficult situations due to his power and contacts, and did a lot of work to get a surgeon for Saumil's surgery.</p>
<p><b>Simran Bhayani and her younger sibling</b> The daughter of charubala and tushar...she has a kid sibling..name is yet not known</p>
<p><b>Gopal "Gattu" Thakkar</b> The sixth child. He is mentally retarded, and has no job as he failed primary school. Plays with the kids. His innocent nature, combined with his continuous desire to eat, make him one of the public's favourite characters.</p>
<p><b>Hemal Thakkar</b> Not a child of Godavari and Labhshankar, but a son of the relative of Gurvanti, Godavari's sister-in-law. Gurvanti gave Godavari the house in exchange for raising Hemal. He is innocent and bashful, but good-hearted.</p>
<p><b>Radhika "Baby" Thakkar</b> The seventh and youngest child. She has polio and is on crutches. Strong-willed, righteous yet rebellious, she is known as "junior jogmaiya (instructor/leader/sergeant)" by her siblings (the senior "jogmaiya" being Baa), because of her strong attitude and fear of no one. She is the only one who has the guts to stand up to Baa. She secretly loves Anish.</p>
<p><b>Raja</b> The eccentric chef hired by the family, Raja spends more time singing and dancing than actually cooking. He does his work eventually, albeit grudgingly, but is always cheerful.</p>
<p><b>Narsi Kaka</b> Famous for never having smiled in many years, Narsi Kaka helps around the house. Grumbles and moans constantly, and is likened to Arvind in that he always goes to Baa to complain about something or other.</p>
<p><b>Prema</b> The exact look-a-like of Charubala, she was hired as a maid by Pravina as a medium by which to mock her sister-in-law. Her modest roots and lifestyle culminate in a heavy accent, and no real understanding of English, which keeps the audience entertained.</p>

<p>When the serial first aired in early 2006 the first episodes were purely devoted to the introduction of the Thakkar family, and the roles they played within the household. As the characters and their lives developed, many story arcs were generated from it.</p>
<p><a name="Anish.2C_Dimple_.26_Baby" id="Anish.2C_Dimple_.26_Baby"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/a/Baa_Bahoo_Aur_Baby_8676.html" title="Edit section: Anish, Dimple &amp; Baby">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline"><b>Anish, Dimple &amp; Baby</b></span></h3>
<p>Anish, a rich Indian from America, moves to Mumbai temporarily to set up a new business branch. On his visit he meets the Thakkar family. He slowly begins to develop a liking for Dimple, Arvind's daughter, and spends increasing amounts of time with her and Baby. Dimple also becomes attracted to Anish, and their love story starts. However, Baby has also fallen in love with Anish, and she believes Anish loves her, because of the time and attention he gives to her as well as Dimple. Half of the Thakkar family know that Dimple &amp; Anish wish to get married, whereas the other half believe Anish is in love with Baby. In the end, rather uncomfortably, at a function, Anish announces his love for Dimple, and Baby is heartbroken. Anish then leaves for America, saying that he has some important work to complete before he can return. Baby eventually accepts that Anish belongs to Dimple, and gets on with her life.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/a/Baa_Bahoo_Aur_Baby_8676.html" title="Edit section: Flashback">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline"><b>Flashback</b></span></h3>
<p>After Anish's return to America, the Thakkar family settle down to a quiet life once more. That is until a huge argument between Baa and Baby breaks the peace. Baa throws Pravin out of the house for never helping with family matters. Baby comes to defend Pravin. Baa stands firm until Baby says that it is this uncompromising aspect of her character that caused Gattu to become mentally retarded and her crippled. Baa breaks down, and retreats to her room. For a number of episodes hence we see numerous flashbacks from Baa as she reminisces about her past, when her children were not even teenagers bar Arvind and Pravin, and how she used to keep her family going by selling "tiffins" and making chapattis. It is here where we find out why Arvind hates his father so much, when we see his drunken state every evening. Pravin is eventually allowed back in the house, but Baa continues to look into her past, searching for something she had done wrong. In the end, Baby apologises to Baa and the storyline ends.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/a/Baa_Bahoo_Aur_Baby_8676.html" title="Edit section: Anish Returns">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline"><b>Anish Returns</b></span></h3>
<p>Soon after Anish returns from America, bringing gifts for everyone. Baby has now fully accepted that she cannot get Anish and treats him as a friend. However, Anish &amp; Dimple seem very awkward around each other, leading the audience to think their love has waned. Slowly the family start to notice, and they become worried at the prospect of a broken engagement. The audience is kept on tenterhooks for many weeks, until it is revealed that Anish &amp; Dimple are being awkward because neither want to go and live in America, but stay here with the Thakkar's. Soon the whole family comes to know, but it is kept from Leela, who had her heart set in seeing her daughter go to America. With the help of Baa, Pravina and Baby, Leela has a change of heart and both Anish &amp; Dimple are contented.</p>
<p><a name="Gattu" id="Gattu"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/a/Baa_Bahoo_Aur_Baby_8676.html" title="Edit section: Gattu">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline"><b>Gattu</b></span></h3>
<p>Anish slowly but surely becomes an integral part of the Thakkar family. Baa soon expresses her concerns about Gattu, and how he must learn how to be responsible and stand on his own two feet, because he could not rely on his family forever. She and Baby set out to try and make him mature, and get a job to secure his future. Baby tries to interview him as an initial assessment, but all he thinks about is food and playing with the kids. Baby loses her temper, and Gattu's case is given to Baa. Anish offers to give Gattu a job at his company. Baa refuses, saying she wanted Gattu to get a job through his own capabilities, rather than a family contact. Anish said he was prepared to interview Gattu. Baa agrees but says she will invigilate. Gattu passes and is given at the job. Initially, he irritates everyone at the workplace as his ineptitude and innocence makes him more of a hindrance than a help. But they slowly warm to him, and he brings the employees closer, turning them into a family. But when Baa hears that they are making him do pointless jobs, such as counting how many people enter the building throughout the day, she orders him to leave the office. Anish fires his manager and secretary, but changes his mind when he hears what Gattu has done for them. Nevertheless Baa's mind has been made up and Gattu will no longer work.</p>
<p><a name="Saumil" id="Saumil"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/a/Baa_Bahoo_Aur_Baby_8676.html" title="Edit section: Saumil">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline"><b>Saumil</b></span></h3>
<p>After the family settles down once more, Harshad arrives with his wife and kids for Diwali. They are accepted, but Baa asks the reason for their sudden arrival. Harshad says he will reveal it only after Diwali. When the family asks again after Diwali, he says it is because Saumil has brain tumor, and only has a maximum of 2 months to live. He said he wanted Saumil to be with his family in his last days. Baa forgets the past differences and welcomes Harshad. The family decide to make these 2 months the happiest 2 months of Saumil's life. Saumil announces "paanch sapnaa" (five dreams) he has which he wishes to be fulfilled before he dies. His first was to see a fancy dress show, which he would be the judge of. The second was to have a funfair at the Thakkar house. The third was to see a cricket match between the family. The fourth was to see Baa &amp; Bapuji (Labhshankar) married again. And the final one he said he would reveal later. All of Saumil's dreams were fulfilled, with some laughs along the way. When asked his fifth wish by Baa after the wedding, Saumil simply said, before he began to sink: he didn't want to die. Then, suddenly, his condition became critical. He was taken into hospital. The doctor said he only had hours to live. Tushar &amp; Harshad called a doctor to arrange a meeting in Chicago so an operation could be done. It was arranged. Saumil was then declared unfit for travel. The doctor was called to <a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">India</a>, but there was a hurricane in Chicago. In the dying moments, Baa convinced the Indian doctor to do the operation, and Harshad made an international appeal for people to pray for Saumil. After an 8-hour operation through which the ladies of Thakkar house prayed incessantly, the doctor came out and said the words "humara Saumil bacch gaya hai" ("Our Saumil has been saved")</p>

<p>Baa Bahoo Aur Baby has received very positive reviews on the whole from most viewers <sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup>. This is because it contains no vulgarity, as well as no particular "villains" (those who are bent on destroying the family due to a personal vendetta of sorts). It has received acclaim therefore from the older generation(s).</p>
<p>Because of the serial's focus on daily life and its various problems, some critics of the show claim that it lacks the excitement and tension of other serials (notably the "K" serials, produced under the <a href="../../../e/k/t/Ekta_Kapoor_e85e.html" title="Ekta Kapoor">Ekta Kapoor</a>/<a href="../../../b/a/l/Balaji_Telefilms_ec8c.html" title="Balaji Telefilms">Balaji Telefilms</a> banner), and so does not appeal greatly to the younger generations. But all in all reviews have been positive.</p>
