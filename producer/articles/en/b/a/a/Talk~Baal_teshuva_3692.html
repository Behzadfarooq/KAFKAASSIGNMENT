<p>Hi, I was the original writer of this piece on the Ba'al Teshuva Revolution now submitted. I have now officially logged in, so I look forward to more comments. 25 Dec. 2002 <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">User:IZAK</a></p>
<p>Hi, IZAK. It was a very interesting piece but one of the things we have to be careful of is NPOV (neutral point of view). Also, some of the facts are questionable. How widespread is the baal teshuva movement really? How does it compare with people leaving Orthodoxy? Other facts to be careful with--my mom graduated from Stern College before I was born and I am pushing forty. In other words, it is not a new institution, like you make it out to be (especially when compared to Drisha). <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanny_4e16.html" title="User:Danny">Danny</a></p>

<dd>I think it would be useful to contrast the return to Judaism with the spiritual odyssey of many Israelies who effectively had no Jewish religion, and instead turned to Indian forms of religion. Also, in the new list of names added to the bottom of the article, should the title <i>Rabbi</i> be part of their name? How would this work on a Wikipedia Search, if someone only typed in the name, without the title? <a href="../../../r/k/_/User%7ERK_21a9.html" title="User:RK">RK</a></dd>
</dl>
<p>Have edited the titles, the "Rabbi" of the rabbis. Yes, I agree,there should be some deeper insights into why and how Israelis turn to Oriental religions. As well as why Jews become "Messianics" such as "Jews for Jesus".<a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">User:IZAK</a></p>

<p>This section is routinely removing all text that doesn't promote this movement in a purely positive light. This si not a history of the movement, it is an advertisement for Jews to become Orthodox.66.108.169.109 04:03, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
This page is being manipulated to promote one form of Judaism above all others, and to deligitimize any form of religious Judaism other than Orthodoxy. The repeated deletions of material from non-Orthodox Jewish sources is a clear violation of Wikipedia NPOV policy. None of our articles on Christianity favor and support one particular denomination of Christianity, the same must be true with our articles on Judaism (and on all other religions.) Most galling is the editing which implies that someone who returns to observant Judaism must be becoming an Orthodox Jew. That implication is purely an Orthodox rhetorical attack; many non-Orthodox baal teshuvas exist, no mater how much Orthodox Jews might dislike this. <a href="../../../r/k/_/User%7ERK_21a9.html" title="User:RK">RK</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>With the exception of some conservative congregations, calling a non-orthodox Jew who observes more baal teshuva, is like calling a christian who starts going to church once in a while a born again christian. Where's the effort that signify's the action? <a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESpaceFalcon2001_2983.html" title="User:SpaceFalcon2001">SF2K1</a> 04:37, 24 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"They were confronted with the question of the importance of activity of the living or the primarity of the genotype in the vitality of an organism, or the consequences of the similarity of all living in their genotype." Keeves, I'm sorry, but what <i>is</i> it about this point that you don't understand, exactly?? More seriously, I think the anon editor is just trying to say, "many people believe baal teshuvas are just dumb people looking for answers. However, many baal teshuvas are highly intelligent, and it is in their intense intellectual inquiry that they have been persuaded of the truth of Judaism." Or something like that. Not sure how we could present that POV in the article. <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabajobu_ed0d.html" title="User:Babajobu">Babajobu</a> 16:36, 11 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The "online resources" section of the external links does not seem suitable for an encyclopedia.

<li>Hello Baba: Do not let <i>your</i> <a href="../../../p/o/v/POV_3e50.html" title="POV">POV</a> and bias show here. If you will look at the edit history of this article, you will see that many editors and contributors put those links together. The links help as a guide to show how <i>real</i> this <a href="../../../p/h/e/Phenomenon.html" title="Phenomenon">phenomenon</a> really is, and that this is not just some <i>shmatte</i> ("junky") topic. Furthermore, because there are a huge variety of organizations in this field with many competing approaches, the external links are meant to assist the reader <i>understand</i> this topic, and NOT as you claim: "and if you'd like to consider embracing the faith of your fathers, please join us at these websites!" Somehow I doubt very much that people who "want to embrace the faith of their fathers" are going to come looking in Wikipedia articles for inspiration, especially if the majority of Wikipedia readers are not Jewish and do not wish to embrace the faith of the Jews' fathers. So your logic is also full of holes. You know, when it's a subject like <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_11%2C_2001_attacks.html" title="September 11, 2001 attacks">September 11, 2001 attacks</a> that has tons of links no-one thinks it's a problem.

<dd>Hi IZAK, thanks for your comments. I think many of the external links <i>are</i> useful: for example, the list of Ba'al teshuva yeshivas is certainly relevant. Nor is there any reason not to have loads of external links, so long as they are all relevant. My concern is that some of the external links are duplicated--why is it important that we have two external links to the same page of the same Aish site, ditto as regards the Chabad site. Moreover, some of the links in the online resources section really have nothing specifically to do with ba'al teshuvas. Why a link to a site with d'var torahs or lectures regarding the mitzvot, for example? Those links are relevant to Jews generally, but do they really have specific relevance to ba'al teshuvas? I'm sorry you regarded my comment as an "attack". I only intended to be a question on a talkpage. <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabajobu_ed0d.html" title="User:Babajobu">Babajobu</a> 03:16, 5 January 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Baba: What you say makes sense, indeed, double links to the same sites, such as Aish and Chabad or links to just general Torah lectures should be removed, especially since we have no shortage of links here as it is, so go ahead and be my guest to cut down on duplicates and irrelevant ones. <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a> 05:57, 13 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks IZAK. I'd removed the duplicate links...and now went ahead and removed some links that I thought were generally relevant to Jews, but not specifically so to ba'alei teshuva. If I removed any links you think <i>are</i> specifically relevant to ba'alei teshuva, then go ahead and restore them. Thanks again. <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabajobu_ed0d.html" title="User:Babajobu">Babajobu</a> 06:12, 13 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Baba:...I glanced at it, wow, and <i>this</i> we call a "trimmed" list...well to be fair, how can we justify cutting links to some Baal teshuva organizations at the expense of others, everyone deserves their day in court I guess... <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a> 06:35, 13 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>IZAK, well, it's possible that other links should be cut as well, I don't know. I only focused on links in the "Online Resources" section that seemed either to duplicate links in other sections or to be relevant to Judaism generally but not ba'alei teshuva specifically. It's possible that some of the links to yeshivas and organizations should be cut as well, but I'm not knowledgeable enough in this area to know which are the makhers and which are the pischers.

<p>The intro is based on modern day Chabad usage of the term. The Jewish usage of the term is someone who mastered teshuva, not someone who did teshuva, even <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chasidut.html" title="Chasidut">chasidut</a> uses the term this way.

<p>The section titled "Orthodox rabbis in outreach - First generation" DOES mention the things which rabbis Schneerson, Kook, and Hutner did in the area of outreach. But it does NOT specify what rabbis Soloveitchik, Ruderman, Miller, Mendlowitz, and Lebowitz did for outreach.

<p>how come there is no mention of the fact, that since Schneerson died without anyone to inherit his position as head of Chabad Lubavitch, and that this has contributed to the development within Chabad of believing Schneerson to be ha Moshiach (Messiah). As far as I can tell parts of Chabad have become quite messianic nature over the last decade or so, is this only relevant to the Messianic Jews section?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Exactly! The article does accurately state that his chassidim are continuing his work in many areas. The controversies which have sprung up since his death are mentioned in other articles, but not very relevant to this one. If someone really wants to, I guess they can include a VERY short comment like "For the controveries about Chabad philosophy which has risen since his death, see xxxxx." but even that might be to much for here. Anyone who wants to can easily click on <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chabad-Lubavitch_9846.html" title="Chabad-Lubavitch">Chabad</a>. --Keeves 11:54, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
