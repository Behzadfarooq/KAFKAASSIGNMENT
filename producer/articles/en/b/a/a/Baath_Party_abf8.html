<p>The <b>Arab Socialist Baath Party</b> (also spelled <b>Ba'th</b> or <b>Ba'ath</b>; <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arabic_language.html" title="Arabic language">Arabic</a>: حزب البعث العربي الاشتراكي <i>Ḥizb al-Ba`ṯ al-`Arabī al-Ištirāki</i>) was founded in <a href="../../../1/9/4/1947.html" title="1947">1947</a> as a radical, secular Arab nationalist political party. It functioned as a <a href="../../../p/a/n/Pan-Arabism_9177.html" title="Pan-Arabism">pan-Arab</a> party with branches in different Arab countries (Yemen, Lebanon, Sudan), but was strongest in <a href="../../../s/y/r/Syria.html" title="Syria">Syria</a> and <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iraq.html" title="Iraq">Iraq</a>, coming to power in both countries in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1963.html" title="1963">1963</a>. In <a href="../../../1/9/6/1966.html" title="1966">1966</a> the Syrian and Iraqi parties split into two rival organizations. Both Baath parties retained the same name, and maintain parallel structures in the Arab world.</p>
<p>The Baath Party came to power in <a href="../../../s/y/r/Syria.html" title="Syria">Syria</a> on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_8.html" title="March 8">8 March</a> 1963 and attained a monopoly of political power later that year. The Baathists ruled <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iraq.html" title="Iraq">Iraq</a> briefly in 1963, and then from July <a href="../../../1/9/6/1968.html" title="1968">1968</a> until <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a>. After the overthrow of President <a href="../../../s/a/d/Saddam_Hussein_75a3.html" title="Saddam Hussein">Saddam Hussein</a>'s Baathist regime in the course of the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003_invasion_of_Iraq_768c.html" title="2003 invasion of Iraq">2003 invasion of Iraq</a>, the occupying authorities banned the Iraqi Baath Party on May 16, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a><a href="http://www.iraqcoalition.org/regulations/20030516_CPAORD_1_De-Ba_athification_of_Iraqi_Society_.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.iraqcoalition.org/regulations/20030516_CPAORD_1_De-Ba_athification_of_Iraqi_Society_.pdf" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. The Iraqi party has since then been associated with armed resistance to US, UK and cooperating Iraqi government forces. However, in a televised speech on January 10, 2007, US President George W. Bush told the American people that "to allow more Iraqis to re-enter their nation's political life, the government will reform de-Baathification laws - and establish a fair process for considering amendments to Iraq's constitution" <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/6250687.stm" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/6250687.stm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arabic_language.html" title="Arabic language">Arabic</a> word <i>Ba'th</i> means "resurrection" or "<a href="../../../r/e/n/Renaissance.html" title="Renaissance">renaissance</a>" as in the party's founder <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michel_Aflaq_19d9.html" title="Michel Aflaq">Michel Aflaq</a>'s published works "On The Way Of Resurrection".

The motto of the Party is "Unity, Freedom, Socialism". "Unity" refers to Arab unity, "freedom" emphasizes freedom from foreign control and interference in particular, and "socialism" refers to what has been termed <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arab_socialism.html" title="Arab socialism">Arab Socialism</a> rather than to <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marxism.html" title="Marxism">Marxism</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/a/Baath_Party_abf8.html" title="Edit section: Origins">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Origins</span></h2>
<p>The Baath party originated with two separate nationalist groups in Syria. The first of these, initially known as <i>harakat al-ihyaa al-'arabi</i> (the Arab Resurrection Movement), was set up by <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michel_Aflaq_19d9.html" title="Michel Aflaq">Michel Aflaq</a> and <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salah_al-Din_al-Bitar_5e1f.html" title="Salah al-Din al-Bitar">Salah al-Din al-Bitar</a> in the 1940s. It was a relatively small group of intellectuals and students, and Aflaq was its main theoretician. His ideology was essentially a form of romantic nationalism coupled with a vague socialism which rejected, however, the idea of <a href="../../../c/l/a/Class_struggle.html" title="Class struggle">class struggle</a>. The second group formed around <a href="../../../z/a/k/Zaki_al-Arsuzi_1bbe.html" title="Zaki al-Arsuzi">Zaki al-Arsuzi</a>, a prominent figure in the resistance to French plans to annex the Syrian province of <a href="../../../h/a/t/Hatay_Province_b0cc.html" title="Hatay Province">Iskandarun</a> to Turkey. Al-Arsuzi's conception of the Arab nation was essentially a linguistic one, and historian <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hanna_Batatu_937f.html" title="Hanna Batatu">Hanna Batatu</a> also charges him with racialism and a mystical tendency influenced by his <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alawite.html" title="Alawite">Alawite</a> religion. According to some sources, in <a href="../../../1/9/4/1940.html" title="1940">1940</a> Arsuzi founded a group known as <i>al-Baath al-'arabi</i> (the Arab Resurrection); in other sources, he only used this as the name of a bookshop he opened in <a href="../../../d/a/m/Damascus.html" title="Damascus">Damascus</a>. In any case, he seems to have been the first to adopt the name.</p>
<p>Al-Bitar and Aflaq were from middle-class Damascus families, the former a <a href="../../../s/u/n/Sunni.html" title="Sunni">Sunni</a> Muslim and the latter a <a href="../../../e/a/s/Eastern_Orthodox_Church_72f2.html" title="Eastern Orthodox Church">Greek Orthodox Christian</a>. Both had studied in <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paris.html" title="Paris">Paris</a>, coming under the influence of European nationalist and <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marxist.html" title="Marxist">Marxist</a> ideas, as well as the secular historicism of leading 19th century French thinkers such as <a href="../../../e/r/n/Ernest_Renan_5482.html" title="Ernest Renan">Ernest Renan</a> and <a href="../../../a/u/g/Auguste_Comte_931c.html" title="Auguste Comte">Auguste Comte</a>. The two men, along with al-Arsuzi and another major proponent of early Baathist ideology, <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shakeeb_Dallal_d16d.html" title="Shakeeb Dallal">Shakeeb Dallal</a>, had careers as middle-class educators.</p>
<p>These groups had formed in opposition to both <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">French</a> colonial rule and to the older generation of Syrian Arab nationalists, and advocated instead <a href="../../../p/a/n/Pan-Arab_unity_3d40.html" title="Pan-Arab unity">Pan-Arab unity</a> and <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arab_nationalism.html" title="Arab nationalism">Arab nationalism</a>. Their ideology blended non-<a href="../../../m/a/r/Marxism.html" title="Marxism">Marxist</a> socialism and nationalism. The early Syrian Bathists opposed the influence of Europe in their country's affairs, and used nationalism and the notion of unifying the Arab world as a platform.</p>
<p><a name="Foundation_of_the_Arab_Baath_Party" id="Foundation_of_the_Arab_Baath_Party"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/a/Baath_Party_abf8.html" title="Edit section: Foundation of the Arab Baath Party">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Foundation of the Arab Baath Party</span></h2>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/4/1943.html" title="1943">1943</a>, al-Arsuzi was deserted by most of his supporters, the bulk of whom, led by Wahib al-Ghanim, joined the Aflaq-al-Bitar group in <a href="../../../1/9/4/1945.html" title="1945">1945</a>. The Arab Baath Party came into existence the same year, when its first central committee was formed. Aflaq and al-Bitar were its leaders. The party was officially established two years later at its first party congress, held in <a href="../../../d/a/m/Damascus.html" title="Damascus">Damascus</a> on <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_7.html" title="April 7">April 7</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/4/1947.html" title="1947">1947</a>.</p>
<p>It remained a relatively small party, with a following essentially among intellectuals, until it merged with the Arab Socialist Party of <a href="../../../a/k/r/Akram_al-Hawrani_3ca7.html" title="Akram al-Hawrani">Akram al-Hawrani</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/5/1952.html" title="1952">1952</a>. The party's name was changed to the Arab Socialist Baath Party, while the constitution and rules of Aflaq and al-Bitar's party were adopted unchanged. A new national command was elected, composed of Aflaq, al-Bitar, al-Hawrani, and Antun Maqdisi, a supporter of al-Hawrani. In <a href="../../../1/9/5/1954.html" title="1954">1954</a> the second party congress ratified the merger.</p>
<p>Al-Hawrani was a popular figure known for his campaigns against the feudal landlordism prevalent in <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hama.html" title="Hama">Hama</a> province and his participation in the <a href="../../../r/a/s/Rashid_Ali_2ec2.html" title="Rashid Ali">Rashid Ali</a> movement in <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iraq.html" title="Iraq">Iraq</a> and resistance to <a href="../../../z/i/o/Zionism.html" title="Zionism">Zionism</a> in <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palestine_%28region%29.html" title="Palestine (region)">Palestine</a>. His support gave the Baath both a wider popular base and a foothold in the officer corps of the Syrian military. However, this was at best a mixed blessing: Batatu records that many of his followers retained a personal loyalty to him rather than becoming committed party men.</p>
<p>The Baath claimed to speak for the entire Arab nation and in the course of the <a href="../../../1/9/5/1950.html" title="1950">1950s</a> its influence spread to other Arab countries, with branches forming in <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iraq.html" title="Iraq">Iraq</a>, <a href="../../../j/o/r/Jordan.html" title="Jordan">Jordan</a>, and <a href="../../../l/e/b/Lebanon.html" title="Lebanon">Lebanon</a>. It was soon to play a prominent role in the turbulent politics of both <a href="../../../s/y/r/Syria.html" title="Syria">Syria</a> and <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iraq.html" title="Iraq">Iraq</a> in the 1950s and 1960s, a role that by the end of the <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960.html" title="1960">1960s</a> would lead it to power in both countries but also ultimately to its transformation from a competitive, ideological political party into an instrument of rule in one-party regimes in both countries.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/a/Baath_Party_abf8.html" title="Edit section: The Baath in Syria, 1954 - 1963">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Baath in Syria, 1954 - 1963</span></h2>
<p>Syrian politics took a dramatic turn in <a href="../../../1/9/5/1954.html" title="1954">1954</a> when the military regime of <a href="../../../a/d/i/Adib_al-Shishakli_623a.html" title="Adib al-Shishakli">Adib al-Shishakli</a> was overthrown and a democratic system restored. The Baath, now a large and popular organisation, gained representation in the parliamentary elections that year. Ideologically-based organisations appealing to the <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intelligentsia.html" title="Intelligentsia">intelligentsia</a>, the <a href="../../../p/e/t/Petty_bourgeoisie.html" title="Petty bourgeoisie">petty bourgeoisie</a> and the working class were gaining ground in Syria, threatening to displace the old parties that represented the notables and bourgeoisie. The Baath was one of these new formations, but faced considerable competition from ideological enemies, notably the <a href="../../../s/y/r/Syrian_Social_Nationalist_Party_6900.html" title="Syrian Social Nationalist Party">Syrian Social Nationalist Party</a> (SSNP), which was intrinsically opposed to Arab nationalism and was seen as pro-Western, and the <a href="../../../s/y/r/Syrian_Communist_Party_dca8.html" title="Syrian Communist Party">Syrian Communist Party</a> (SCP), whose support for class struggle and internationalism was also anathema to the Baath. In addition to the parliamentary level, all these parties as well as <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamist.html" title="Islamist">Islamists</a> competed in street-level activity and sought to recruit support among the military.</p>
<p>The assassination of Baathist colonel Adnan al-Malki by a member of the SSNP allowed the Baath and its allies to launch a crackdown on that party, thus eliminating one rival, but by the late 1950s the Baath itself was facing considerable problems, driven by factionalism and faced with ideological confusion among its base. The growth of the Communist Party was also a major threat. These considerations undoubtedly contributed to the party's decision to support unification with <a href="../../../n/a/s/Nasser.html" title="Nasser">Nasser</a>'s <a href="../../../e/g/y/Egypt.html" title="Egypt">Egypt</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/5/1958.html" title="1958">1958</a>, an extremely popular position in any case. In <a href="../../../1/9/5/1958.html" title="1958">1958</a> Syria merged with Egypt in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Arab_Republic_9aa5.html" title="United Arab Republic">United Arab Republic</a>. As political parties other than Nasser's <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arab_Socialist_Union_e6c2.html" title="Arab Socialist Union">Arab Socialist Union</a> were not permitted to operate, the Baath along with Syria's other parties faced the choice of dissolution or suppression.</p>
<p>In August <a href="../../../1/9/5/1959.html" title="1959">1959</a> the Baath Party held a congress which, in line with Aflaq's views, approved of its liquidation into the Arab Socialist Union. This decision was not universally accepted in party ranks, however, and the following year a fourth party congress was convened which reversed it.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a small group of Syrian Baathist officers stationed in Egypt were observing with alarm the party's poor position and the increasing fragility of the union. They decided to form a secret military committee: its initial members were Lieutenant-Colonel Muhammad 'Umran, majors <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salah_Jadid_1a0c.html" title="Salah Jadid">Salah Jadid</a> and Ahmad al-Mir, and captains <a href="../../../h/a/f/Hafez_al-Assad_55ae.html" title="Hafez al-Assad">Hafez al-Assad</a> and 'Abd al-Karim al-Jundi</p>
<p>The merger was not a happy experience for Syria, and in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1961.html" title="1961">1961</a> a military coup in <a href="../../../d/a/m/Damascus.html" title="Damascus">Damascus</a> brought it to an end. Sixteen prominent politicians signed a statement supporting the coup, among them al-Hurani and al-Bitar (although the latter soon retracted his signature). The party was in crisis: the secession was extremely controversial among Syrians in general and most unpopular among the radical nationalists who formed the Baath membership. A large section of the membership left in protest, setting up the <a href="../../../s/o/c/Socialist_Unionists_dfff.html" title="Socialist Unionists">Socialist Unity Vanguard</a> and gaining considerable support. The leadership around Aflaq was bitterly contested for its timidity in opposing the separation. Al-Hawrani, now a determined opponent of reunification, left the Baath and re-established his Arab Socialist Party.</p>
<p>Aflaq sought to reactivate the splintered party by calling a Fifth National Congress held in <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homs.html" title="Homs">Homs</a> in May <a href="../../../1/9/6/1962.html" title="1962">1962</a>, from which both al-Hawrani's supporters and the Socialist Unity Vanguard were excluded. A compromise was reached between the pro-Nasser elements and the more cautious leadership. The leadership line was reflected in the position the congress adopted in favour of "considered unity" as opposed to the demands for "immediate unity" launched by the Socialist Unity Vanguard (later the Socialist Unity Movement), the Nasserists and the <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arab_Nationalist_Movement_66cf.html" title="Arab Nationalist Movement">Arab Nationalist Movement</a>. Meanwhile the Syrian party's secret Military Committee was also planning how to take power, having been granted considerable freedom of action by the civilian leadership in recognition of its need for secrecy.</p>

<p>On February 8 1963, the Iraqi Baath took power after bloodily overthrowing <a href="../../../a/b/d/Abdul_Karim_Qassim_864d.html" title="Abdul Karim Qassim">Abd al-Karim Qasim</a> and quashing communist-led resistance.</p>
<p>That same year, the Syrian party's military committee succeeded in persuading Nasserist and independent officers to make common cause with it, and they successfully carried out a military coup on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_8.html" title="March 8">8 March</a>. A National Revolutionary Command Council took control and assigned itself legislative power; it appointed Salah al-Din al-Bitar as head of a "national front" government. The Baath participated in this government along with the Arab Nationalist Movement, the United Arab Front and the Socialist Unity Movement.</p>
<p>As historian <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hanna_Batatu_937f.html" title="Hanna Batatu">Hanna Batatu</a> notes, this took place without the fundamental disagreement over immediate or "considered" reunification having been resolved. The Baath moved to consolidate its power within the new regime, purging Nasserist officers in April. Subsequent disturbances led to the fall of the al-Bitar government, and in the aftermath of Jasim Alwan's failed Nasserist coup in July, the Baath monopolised power.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/a/Baath_Party_abf8.html" title="Edit section: Ideological transformation and division, 1963 - 1966">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Ideological transformation and division, 1963 - 1966</span></h2>
<p>The challenges of building a Baathist state led to considerable ideological discussion and internal struggle in the party. The Iraqi party was increasingly dominated by Ali Salih al-Sa'di, an unsophisticated thinker according to Batatu, who took a hardline leftist approach, declaring himself a Marxist. He gained support in this from Syrian regional secretary Mahmud al-Shufi and from Yasin al-Hafiz, one of the party's few ideological theorists. Some members of the secret military committee also sympathised with this line.</p>
<p>The far-left tendency gained control at the party's Sixth National Congress of <a href="../../../1/9/6/1963.html" title="1963">1963</a>, where hardliners from the dominant Syrian and Iraqi regional parties joined forces to impose a hard left line, calling for "socialist planning", "collective farms run by peasants", "workers' democratic control of the means of production", a party based on workers and peasants, and other demands reflecting a certain emulation of Soviet-style socialism. In a coded attack on Aflaq, the congress also condemned "ideological notability" within the party (Batatu, p. 1020). Aflaq, bitterly angry at this transformation of his party, retained a nominal leadership role, but the National Command as a whole came under the control of the radicals.</p>
<p>The volte-face was received with anger by elements in the Iraqi party, which suffered considerable internal division. The Nationalist Guard, a paramilitary unit which had been extremely effective, and extremely brutal, in suppressing opposition to the new regime, supported al-Sa'di, as did the Baathist Federation of Students, the Union of Workers, and the bulk of the membership. Most party members among the military officer corps were opposed, as was President <a href="../../../a/b/d/Abdul_Salam_Arif_4a04.html" title="Abdul Salam Arif">Abd al-Salam 'Arif</a>. Coup and counter-coup ensued within the party, whose factions did not shrink from employing the military in settling their internal differences. This eventually allowed 'Arif to take control and eliminate Baathist power in Iraq for the time being.</p>

<p>From 1963, the Baath functioned as the only legal Syrian political party, but factionalism and splintering within the party led to a succession of governments and new constitutions. On <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_23.html" title="February 23">23 February</a> 1966 a military <a href="../../../m/i/l/Military_dictatorship.html" title="Military dictatorship">junta</a> led by <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salah_Jadid_1a0c.html" title="Salah Jadid">Salah Jadid</a> took power, and set out on a more radical line. Although they had not been supporters of the victorious far-left line at the Sixth Party Congress, they had now moved to adopt its positions and displaced the more moderate wing in power, purging from the party its original founders, Aflaq and al-Bitar.</p>
<p>At this juncture the Syrian Baath party split into two factions: the "progressive" faction, led by <a href="../../../n/u/r/Nureddin_al-Atassi_6890.html" title="Nureddin al-Atassi">Nureddin al-Atassi</a>, which gave priority to neo-Marxist economic reform, and the so-called nationalist group, led by <a href="../../../h/a/f/Hafez_al-Assad_55ae.html" title="Hafez al-Assad">Hafez al-Assad</a>. Assad was unenthusiastic about the radical and increasingly unpopular <a href="../../../s/o/c/Socialism.html" title="Socialism">socialist</a> line the Baath was pursuing. He also favoured a more cautious approach in external affairs: he viewed a reconciliation with the conservative Arab states, notably <a href="../../../s/a/u/Saudi_Arabia_53d2.html" title="Saudi Arabia">Saudi Arabia</a>, as essential for Syria's strategic position. Despite constant maneuvering and government changes, the two factions remained in an uneasy coalition of power until 1970, when, in another coup, Assad succeeded in ousting Atassi as prime minister. The Baath Party in Syria became virtually indistinguishable from the state, with membership numbers well over one million reflecting the fact that party membership was vital to advancement in many sectors. Other socialist parties accepting the basic orientation of the regime were permitted to operate again, and in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1973.html" title="1973">1973</a> the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Progressive_Front_921f.html" title="National Progressive Front">National Progressive Front</a> was established as a coalition of the legal parties; the Baath remained firmly in control. Meanwhile, supporters of the far-left line formed the Democratic Arab Socialist Baath Party, which remains in existence to this day as an illegal opposition party in Syria and in exile.</p>
<p>The Syrian Baath and the Iraqi Baath were by now two separate parties, each maintaining that it was the genuine party and electing a National Command to take charge of the party across the Arab world. However, in Syria the Regional Command was the real centre of party power, and the membership of the National Command was a largely honorary position, often the destination of figures being eased out of the leadership.</p>
<p>Assad, one of the longest-ruling leaders of the modern <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middle_East_c1c7.html" title="Middle East">Middle East</a>, remained at Syria's political helm until his death in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2000.html" title="2000">2000</a>, when his son <a href="../../../b/a/s/Bashar_al_Assad_9c2c.html" title="Bashar al Assad">Bashar al Assad</a> succeeded him as President and as Regional Secretary of the party.</p>
<p>The Baath holds 135 of the 250 seats in the Syrian parliament, a figure which is dictated by election regulations rather than by voting patterns.</p>

<p>Iraqi and Syrian Baathism today differ widely and partially oppose each other, though they only split a short time after their creation. They share one common feature in that under Saddam Hussein Iraq also moved away from Baathist principles.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/a/Baath_Party_abf8.html" title="Edit section: History">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h3>
<p>In Iraq the Baath party remained a civilian group and lacked strong support within the military. The party had little impact, and the movement split into several factions after 1958 and again in 1966. It lacked strong popular support, but through the construction of a strong party apparatus the party succeeded in gaining power.</p>
<p>The Baathists first came to power in the coup of February, 1963, when Abd al-Salam 'Arif became president. Interference from the historic leadership around Aflaq and disputes between the moderates and extremists, culminating in an attempted coup by the latter in November, 1963, served to discredit the party. After Arif's takeover in November 1963, the moderate military Baathist officers initially retained some influence but were gradually eased out of power over the following months.</p>
<p>In July, 1968, a bloodless coup brought to power the Baathist general <a href="../../../a/h/m/Ahmad_Hassan_al-Bakr_1461.html" title="Ahmad Hassan al-Bakr">Ahmad Hassan al-Bakr</a>. Wranglings within the party continued, and the government periodically <a href="../../../p/u/r/Purge.html" title="Purge">purged</a> its dissident members. Emerging as a party strongman, <a href="../../../s/a/d/Saddam_Hussein_75a3.html" title="Saddam Hussein">Saddam Hussein</a> eventually used his growing power to push al-Bakr aside in 1979 and ruled <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iraq.html" title="Iraq">Iraq</a> until 2003. Although almost all the Baathist leadership had no military background, under Hussein the party changed dramatically and became heavily militarized, with its leading members frequently appearing in uniform.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/a/Baath_Party_abf8.html" title="Edit section: Structure">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Structure</span></h3>
<p>The Party cell or circle, composed of three to seven members, constitutes the basic organisational unit of the Iraqi Baath Party. Cells functioned at the neighborhood or village level, where members would meet to discuss and execute party directives introduced from above. Since individual cells had little contact with one another, those higher up could vigorously enforce party loyalties from the top down. As the U.S. and its allies discovered in Iraq in 2003, cell organization also made the Party highly resilient.</p>
<p>A Party division comprised two to seven cells, controlled by a division commander. Such Baathist cells occurred throughout the bureaucracy and the military, where they functioned as the Party's watchdog, an effective form of covert surveillance within a public administration.</p>
<p>A Party section, which comprised two to five divisions, functioned at the level of a large city quarter, a town, or a rural district.</p>
<p>The branch came above the sections; it comprised at least two sections, and operated at the provincial level.</p>
<p>The Party congress, which combined all the branches, elected the regional command as the core of the Party leadership and top decision-making mechanism.</p>
<p>The national command of the Baath Party ranked over the regional command. It formed the highest policy-making and coordinating council for the Baath movement throughout the Arab world at large.</p>

<p>In June 2003, the U.S.-led multinational <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003_occupation_of_Iraq_d045.html" title="2003 occupation of Iraq">occupying</a> forces in Iraq banned the Baath party. Some criticize the additional step the <a href="../../../c/o/a/Coalition_Provisional_Authority_0d21.html" title="Coalition Provisional Authority">CPA</a> took — of banning all members of the Baath party from the new government, as well as from <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_school.html" title="Public school">public schools</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/l/College.html" title="College">colleges</a> — as blocking too many skilled people from participation in the new government.

After the fall of the Saddam government, many branches have distanced themselves from the central party, such as the branches in <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arab_Socialist_Rebirth_Party_%28Yemen%29_7eb0.html" title="Arab Socialist Rebirth Party (Yemen)">Yemen</a> and <a href="../../../s/u/d/Sudanese_Ba%27ath_Party_8cb3.html" title="Sudanese Ba'ath Party">Sudan</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../l/e/b/Lebanon.html" title="Lebanon">Lebanon</a>, the party is led by Liberal Sunni MP for Tripoli Abdul-Majeed Al-Rafei and Nicola Y. Firzli, Beirut-based real estate entrepreneur and scion of a prominent <a href="../../../e/a/s/Eastern_Orthodox_Church_72f2.html" title="Eastern Orthodox Church">Greek Orthodox Christian</a> family that fought against <a href="../../../o/t/t/Ottoman_Turks_1d9f.html" title="Ottoman Turks">Ottoman</a> Turkish rule in the <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middle_East_c1c7.html" title="Middle East">Middle East</a>.</p>
<p>The party works amongst the Palestinians through the <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arab_Liberation_Front_efb0.html" title="Arab Liberation Front">Arab Liberation Front</a> (<i>Jabhat al-Tahrir al-'Arabiyah</i>). ALF formed the major Palestinian political faction in <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iraq.html" title="Iraq">Iraq</a> during the Saddam years. It is numerically small, but gained some prominence due to the support given to it by the Iraqi government. It is a member organization of <a href="../../../p/l/o/PLO_68c8.html" title="PLO">PLO</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../b/a/h/Bahrain.html" title="Bahrain">Bahrain</a>, Rasul al-Jishi leads the local faction of the Baath Party, the <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nationalist_Democratic_Rally_Society_77f1.html" title="Nationalist Democratic Rally Society">Nationalist Democratic Rally Society</a> (<i>Jami'at al-Tajammu' al-Qawmi al-Dimuqrati</i>), which in an alliance with radical <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamists.html" title="Islamists">Islamists</a> opposes the Bahrain government.</p>
<p>An Iraq-oriented Baath Party branch formerly existed in <a href="../../../s/y/r/Syria.html" title="Syria">Syria</a>, which the Syrian government severely repressed. It was led by former Sunni president <a href="../../../a/m/i/Amin_al-Hafez_93ab.html" title="Amin al-Hafez">Amin al-Hafez</a> who returned to <a href="../../../a/l/e/Aleppo.html" title="Aleppo">Aleppo</a> in 2003, after having lived in exile in Iraq for more than three decades.</p>
