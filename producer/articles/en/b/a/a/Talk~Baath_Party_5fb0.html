<p>I removed "by the United States" as of course the UK and others had something to do with it as well; those needing a listing of the cast of characters can follow the Iraq war link. The Iraqi Ba'ath predated Saddam, and at this point it's future seems better described as uncertain than over. It seems that the coalition forces are making some use of mid-level Ba'ath officials; see for example this article from <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Guardian_d79f.html" title="The Guardian">The Guardian</a> April 21: <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/Iraq/Story/0,2763,940335,00.html?=rss" class="external text" title="http://www.guardian.co.uk/Iraq/Story/0,2763,940335,00.html?=rss" rel="nofollow">Ba'athists slip quietly back into control</a> -- <a href="../../../i/n/f/User%7EInfrogmation_bc10.html" title="User:Infrogmation">Infrogmation</a> 06:59 Apr 21, 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>i wish you would talk about the CIA and its involvement in the Ba'ath party in the 1960s. this matter is a bit shrouded in mystery and debate, but most of it in the doldrums of obscurity rather than sunshiney public places like wikipedia.</p>

<p>What is the actual meaning of the word "Ba'ath"? By that I refer mainly to its etymology. From what little I know of the language, I guess it has something to do with land. <a href="../../../s/w/e/User%7ESweetfreek_088b.html" title="User:Sweetfreek">Sweetfreek</a> 23:06, 21 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It means "resurrection" and it's used in the Qur'an. Aflaq originally called his group "al-ihyaa' al-'arabi" which has the same meaning, though without the Qur'anic echo I think; it was Zaki al-Arsuzi who first called his organisation (or just his bookshop, depending on your source) "al-Ba'th al-'arabi". <a href="../../../p/a/l/User%7EPalmiro_d72a.html" title="User:Palmiro">Palmiro</a> 17:38, 9 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I noticed that in the "post saddam" section it states that there were "widespread but unreported protests", but this makes no sense. If they were unreported, how did the author know about them. This sounds like an attempt to fabricate facts, since we could try to verify the fact but will of course fail, because the protests went unreported. They must have been reported somewhere, I would like to see some documentation of this claim. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdamRetchless_d1d6.html" title="User:AdamRetchless">AdamRetchless</a> 05:19, 18 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The ideal Wikipedia links to pages that are high content, neutral, and from sources with strong credentials. The link added to this page and, to the one placed in Micheal Aflaq, meet none of these standards. - <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonP_1010.html" title="User:SimonP">SimonP</a> 03:47, Jan 27, 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>OK, now I understand but where is it agreed that external links must be NPOV. I can't read arabic but I doubt whether the link to Alfak's writings are NPOV and indeed many links I'v seen in Wikipedia are not remotely NPOV. I read "External Links" as a warning that you are leaving the NPOV zone. If you do think that all NPOV links need to be deleted would you like to delete this: <a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/801925.cms" class="external text" title="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/801925.cms" rel="nofollow">Saddam a hero: Daughter</a> which you will find on the <a href="../../../s/a/d/Saddam_Hussein_75a3.html" title="Saddam Hussein">Saddam Hussein</a> page. <a href="../../../d/e/j/User%7EDejvid_f1a9.html" title="User:Dejvid">Dejvid</a> 13:03, 27 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Primary sources, such as both those you mention, are always acceptable as external links, as they always present information that is not present in our articles. What is also important is how we describe an external link. A link saying "Saddam is a hero" is unacceptable but one saying "Saddam's daughter thinks he's a hero" allows a reader to better evaluate the claim. Ensuring that there is a diversity of points of view in the external links section is another essential method of being NPOV. For instance see <a href="../../../g/l/o/Global_warming.html" title="Global warming">global warming</a> where the links are sorted by their affiliations. - <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonP_1010.html" title="User:SimonP">SimonP</a> 16:15, Jan 27, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Then I'll clearly label them as from opponents. Deal? <a href="../../../d/e/j/User%7EDejvid_f1a9.html" title="User:Dejvid">Dejvid</a> 22:55, 27 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Not really, but perhaps you could find some links from a notable opponent of Ba'athism like the INC, Qutb, or Sadr. The fellow who wrote your piece is a known critic of the Iranian government, but no expert on Iraq or Baathism. - <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonP_1010.html" title="User:SimonP">SimonP</a> 23:03, Jan 27, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I think you are missing the bias that is implicit in the criteria you giv. Links from an organization automatically gain the status "primary" and they are, usually, pro. Syria remains a dictatorship so no Syrian opposition parties exist except in exile. Hence your definition of "primary" excludes partisan anti links but allows partisan pro links. It is true that there are now politically parties hostile to the Ba'ath in Irak but they are not involved in a struggle with the Ba'ath so their criticism of the Ba'ath is likely to be motivated by a need to prove their anti-Ba'ath credentials rather than anything deeper. And tell me, what qualification does Saddam's daughter have to assess Saddam as a ruler? Father yes, ruler no.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>But more than that you seem to have a preference for political leaders over independent (albeit partisan) writers and journalists. The skill of being a good politician is not the same as that of a writer. Case in point Aflaq. Brilliant writer (even Makiya concedes that) - dead loss as a politician. <a href="../../../d/e/j/User%7EDejvid_f1a9.html" title="User:Dejvid">Dejvid</a> 12:56, 29 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The name of the party translates into "resurrection" not "rebirth" for example the same word is used in the bible (in arabic) to descibe Jesus's resurection not rebirth.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Every source I've ever seen gives <i>rebirth.</i> Do you have any references for <i>resurrection?</i> If the same word is used in the Arabic versions of the Bible it might mean that Arabic does not have a word for <i>resurrection</i>, and instead uses <i>rebirth</i> there as well. - <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonP_1010.html" title="User:SimonP">SimonP</a> 21:29, July 21, 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>A good source would be the party's founder Michel Aflaq's own book "On The Way Of Resurrection". In addition I am fluent in both Arabic and English. The Arabic word for birth is woulida ÙÙØ¯. The correct way to say rebirth would be equivalent to saying âborn anewâ in English. I used the bible use of the word as an example of ressurection.</p>
<dl>
<dd>The source you cited again depends on your Arabic translation. Does the word you are translating literally mean "return from the dead?" Which is what resurrection means. Most of the scholarly sources I check give rebirth, for instance William L. Cleveland's <i>History of the Modern Middle East</i> states that Ba'ath literally translates as "rebirth or renaissance." Some people do seem to use "resurrection," and perhaps it should be mentioned as an alternate translation. - <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonP_1010.html" title="User:SimonP">SimonP</a> 22:28, July 21, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Actually all Arabic-English dictionaries (e.g Al-Manhal)I looked in translate the word into "resurrection" as in "return from the dead". Furthermore the writings of the party founders explain the name as such because it refers to the period under colonial rule as the time when the nation was dead. In that respect the word can carry the meaning renaissance. Keep in mind that the Arabic word for renaissance is "nahda". I found an online dictionary (it's bit clunky)www.sakhr.com. Choose arabic to english translation then type the word Ø§ÙØ¨Ø¹Ø«</p>

<p><a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESoman_c37c.html" title="User:Soman">User:Soman</a> suggests that we could consider giving the Syrian and Iraqi Ba'th parties separate articles (given that they are indeed separate parties) and retain this article for the original Ba'th (up until 1966 if memory serves).</p>
<p>Personally I think there is a strong argument for this, though perhaps such an article should include brief summary treatment of the two successor parties. There is enough to be written about the Ba'th to easily fill three articles. However, it does pose some logistical difficulties: clearly, what the Ba'th was up to in Mosul in 1959 (as one example) had more impact on the future of the Ba'th in Iraq than on the national party, and falls more logically with a treatment of the Ba'th in Iraq.

<dd>To add some more confusion. I found a catalogue printed by PASSIA (like around 1999) listing ALF and a Palestian Baath Party (led by Jamal Bustami, in Nablus). Several websources seem to confirm that Baath and ALF are separate structures, although ALF is under (was?) the leadership of Baath. One source says Bustami's party is pro-Iraqi. Thus is fair to conclude that the Palestian Baath Party is the branch of the Iraqi-led party? --<a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESoman_c37c.html" title="User:Soman">Soman</a> 16:31, 1 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>We need to get the spelling of this party's name consistent. The article title, at the time I'm typing this, is "Ba'ath Party". But the introductory sentence spells it "Ba'th", with "Ba'ath" given as one of the alternate spellings. Thereafter, both spellings are seen in different places. We should only see one spelling in the whole article, with the exception of the part where alternate spellings are given, etymological sections, etc.</p>
<p>I don't know a word of Arabic, and I believe that qualifies me to strongly endorse the spelling "Ba'ath"&#160;:-) Seriously, it is by far the preferred spelling in English-language media, and my understanding and experience is that that is the overriding criterion in the Wikipedia guidelines for deciding on spelling. --<a href="../../../r/s/c/User%7ERschmertz_214b.html" title="User:Rschmertz">Rschmertz</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>Thanks for the comment. I did my best to standardise the spelling inside the article on "Ba'th", as being the best of the three versions. I was sort of summoning up my energy to suggest a move of the actual article, which I agree should correspond with what's used in the title.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The thing is, there is no real justification for the spelling "Ba'ath". The apostrophe represents an Arabic consonant that doesnt exist in English, and that most English-speakers would probably hear as a long 'a' in this word or might possibly confuse with a glottal stop. The reason for the spelling "Baath" is simply this similarity, to the non-Arabic-speaking ear, with a long 'a'. There's no good reason for the spelling "Ba'ath": it's effectively transliterating the Ø¹ twice, and the apostrophe doesn;t serve any helpful phonetic purpose for someone who doesn't speak Arabic. After all, how do you pronounce " ' "?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>So I would support either "Baath" or "Ba'th", but not Ba'ath, which is simply wrong because it effectively transliterates the arabic letter twice without making things at all clearer for the average English speaker. It may well be (I seem to recall doing a google-test myself that confirmed this) that Ba'ath is the more common spelling on the internet. On the other hand, my impression is that it's rather less common than Ba'th in serious books on related topics. The internet isn't necessarily the best guide to what's right, the media is often lazy and simply wrong&#160;;) and just because something is widespread doesn't make it correct.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I've now standardised the spelling throughout the article to Ba'th, as a temporary measure pending any decision we may reach. <a href="../../../p/a/l/User%7EPalmiro_d72a.html" title="User:Palmiro">Palmiro</a> | <a href="../../../p/a/l/User_talk%7EPalmiro_7aea.html" title="User talk:Palmiro">Talk</a> 22:31, 18 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Re "just because something is widespread doesn't make it correct": that actually is debatable, strange as it may sound. Though I'm all in favor of encouraging spellings that map as closely as possible to the original language (an inexact science in itself), we sometimes have to make a determination that the widespread usage is the "correct" one, for purposes such as ours. I once followed a long WP discussion on <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hangul.html" title="Hangul">hangul</a>. The Korean government had promoted the English/Latin spelling "hangeul" for their esteemed alphabet, which does somewhat clarify the pronunciation, but the consensus (or was it the loudest voices?) was that the latter spelling was almost never seen in English print, and that the former, which nearly always was, was therefore the standard English spelling. It happens. The word Czech, for example, is not Czech at all; it would be nice if we could spell it as we pronounce it (something like "chek") or as they spell it (Äesko, for the country name), but I don't see that happening.</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Anyway, this case doesn't seem as dire; I've looked around a bit more, and it seems that "Baath" occurs at least as often as its apostrophied version, so it looks like a good candidate to me. Meanwhile, most of your arguments against "Ba'ath" would seem to apply equally to "Ba'th".<a href="../../../r/s/c/User%7ERschmertz_214b.html" title="User:Rschmertz">Rschmertz</a> 02:19, 20 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>How did "Ba'ath" come to be so widely used? That is not how it is pronounced in Standard Arabic or any Arabic dialect I know of. I think "Ba'th" is the best transliteration, but "Baath" could be an official spelling: <a href="http://www.baath-party.org/eng/news.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.baath-party.org/eng/news.asp" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. --<a href="../../../y/o/d/User%7EYodakii_63f2.html" title="User:Yodakii">Yodakii</a> 03:16, 5 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>If you added the diacritics, would it be Ø¨ÙØ¹Ø« or Ø¨ÙØ¹ÙØ«? For the former, I would say Ba'th, and for the latter, I'd say Ba'ath. But I really want to come up with a good way to differentiate between Ø¡ and Ø¹ in transcriptions. --<a href="../../../l/a/k/User%7ELakeHMM_45b4.html" title="User:LakeHMM">LakeHMM</a> 06:36, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>: Generally it would be the full correct name. However, in some case preference is given to the name most commonly used in English-language media. This has some strange twists, as there seem to be an opinion that shifting articles like <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shining_Path_bc8e.html" title="Shining Path">Shining Path</a>, <a href="../../../k/h/m/Khmer_Rouge_98c5.html" title="Khmer Rouge">Khmer Rouge</a>, etc. to the new officially used by respective organisations is perceived as an endorsement to that particular faction. However, I would strongly suggest using the full name for the article, as it that has been used by both the main parties in international relations. Still Baath Party, Ba'ath Party, Ba'th Party would redirect to the main article. It might also be a good idea to separate the whole into separate articles, one about Baathism in general and the development of Baathist movement and separate articles for the parties born out of it. Especially since many branches of the movement are starting to function independently (such as Sudanese Baath Party, etc.). 'Baath Party', etc. could redirect to 'Baathism', with links to 'Arab Socialist Baath Party (Syria-based)', 'Arab Socialist Baath Party (Iraq-based)', Sudanese Baath Party, Arab Democratic Socialist Baath Party, etc. --<a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESoman_c37c.html" title="User:Soman">Soman</a> 20:13, 25 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Fascism is a vague term that can be applied to many things, but I don't think the Syrian Baath Party is especially fascistic.

<dd>on the contrary, i would say they were definitely more influenced by fascism than marxism. The ba'th was always strongly anti-marxist, but some of its early ideologues i think had flirtations with fascism. also, the vague socialism, nationalism, militarism, leadership cult (a later addition, maybe), etc, all makes it ideologically similar to national socialism, if not mussolini-style fascism. however, it would of course be grossly POV to say that it <i>is</i> a fascist movement, but its relations to the 1930s/40s european nationalist movements could be better covered. <a href="../../../a/r/r/User%7EArre_fee4.html" title="User:Arre">Arre</a> 02:15, 15 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I definitely am not an expert in this area. However, I would like to add Bernard Lewis said "the Baath Party was founded, as a kind of clone of the Nazi and Fascist parties" in an article in the National Post of Canada, I believe on 4/8/03. In addition, on 2/7/06 the HistoryChannel broadcast a 100 minute documentary copyrighted in 2005 entitled "Saddam and the Third Reich" which goes into significant detail about the Nazi Party's influence on M. 'Aflaq's ideology, and Saddam Hussein's uncle K. Tulfah. It goes on to discuss the tight relationship between the Nazis and the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, Amin al-Husseini, and describes his impact on all Arab political thought.

<dd>Whatever the credentials of Bernard Lewis, his judgement has considerable merit in this case.

<p>To me this debate is far from the truth. To be Fascist a movement must have tendencies towards corporatism in the style found in both Mussolini's party. Franco's Spain and Adolf's Germany. There is no corporatism in either Syria's or Iraq's Ba'th party. If there was one thing the founders fought it was the corporatism of the previous regimes based on family and clan influences. Please can we stop putting European/American history labels on non first world processes? In my view it is a silent extension of the superiority ideas of the Victorians. Arab Political history is influenced by its occupiers, but that doesn't mean it is following the same vectors. Thanks Wolfje</p>

<p>TammamS/Fares keeps inserting passages. I can't speak for the other reverting their insertions, but I'd like to motivate my behaviour: 1. "While it was controlled by the Sunni minority and ruling the Shi'a majority in Iraq, the Baath Party is controlled by the Alawite minority in Syria and rules the Sunni majority. " I hardly dispute that Alawites dominate Syrian politics, or that Sunnis dominated the Saddam regime, but 1) there's no source, 2) the text fails to differentiate that the two parties are separate structures, 3) is this a particular Baathist characteristic? (which would motivate its inclusion in the initial presentation) nis it the only system of governance in the Middle East were minorities dominate over majorities? 4) whilst the groups mentioned (alawites in syria, formerly sunnis in iraq) have disproportionate influence over the Baath parties, the picture is actually much more complicated. Notably other minorities support/supported Baath (like christians, druze, etc.)</p>
<p>2. "(as usual in this country)", is a strange wording</p>
<p>3. "Practically, the Baath Party is mainly a political framework that allowed the accession of dictators to power in several <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arab.html" title="Arab">Arab</a> countries. By monopolizing power and controlling freedom of speech in these countries, the Party was institutionalizing a "police state" and establishing a reign of terror on the <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arab.html" title="Arab">Arab</a> populations.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup>" Is two 'several'? Is this a NPOV description of Baathist history? "reign of terror" hardly NPOV wording. Text passage entirely argumentative</p>
<p>4. "The Baath Party was responsible for multiple massacres against innocent <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arab.html" title="Arab">Arab</a> populations. In 1982, the <a href="../../../s/y/r/Syrian.html" title="Syrian">Syrian</a> Baath Party of <a href="../../../h/a/f/Hafez_Al-Assad_e2d0.html" title="Hafez Al-Assad">Hafez Al-Assad</a> massacred more than 20,000 <a href="../../../s/y/r/Syrian.html" title="Syrian">Syrian</a> citizens in the town of Hama. The <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hama_massacre.html" title="Hama massacre">Hama massacre</a> was aimed at controlling the <a href="../../../m/u/s/Muslim_Brotherhood_ed9f.html" title="Muslim Brotherhood">Muslim Brotherhood</a> movement that was opposed to the policies of the Baath Party. The massacre of Hama allowed the ruling party to suppress the <a href="../../../m/u/s/Muslim_Brotherhood_ed9f.html" title="Muslim Brotherhood">Muslim Brotherhood</a> from the <a href="../../../s/y/r/Syrian.html" title="Syrian">Syrian</a> political life, and to terrorise any political party that would dare challenging the Baathist regime.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup>" Again this is not put under the Syrian section. Moreover, it has clear POV marks (like "innocent"). Furthermore, this article is about a political movement, not Syrian political history in general.</p>
<p>5. "The Baath Party is completely opposed to any form of democracy. For example, during the rule of the Baathist regime, <a href="../../../s/y/r/Syria.html" title="Syria">Syria</a> never experienced any free presidential election. There was always a unique candidate (<a href="../../../h/a/f/Hafez_Al-Assad_e2d0.html" title="Hafez Al-Assad">Hafez Al-Assad</a>), and he always won the elections with 99.99% of the votes. If any candidate dared to present his nomination against Assad, he was directly killed by the powerful <a href="../../../s/y/r/Syrian.html" title="Syrian">Syrian</a> intelligence." The last sentence would definately need a source to back it up. The first sentence is factually incorrect. Baathists have worked for democratic change in several countries (like Sudan).</p>
<p>6. "In the Baathist regime, the ruler should always be succeeded by his son." Original research? Basing assumptions upon two existing cases?</p>
<p>7. "By setting an ideology that does not accept any form of opposition, the Baath Party was in fact forbidding popular participation in decision-making, and discouraging the emergence of "new ideas". The results of this policy was catastrophic for the socio-economic development of the <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arab.html" title="Arab">Arab</a> countries." Original research. Private interpretations of causes of economic development.</p>
<p>8. "The existence of a unique ideology is considered as the main reason behind the "failure of the Baathist regimes to face the <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israeli.html" title="Israeli">Israeli</a> expansion" in the <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arab.html" title="Arab">Arab</a> world.", "This negative attitude of the Baathist regimes prevented the participation of all the educated <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arab.html" title="Arab">Arab</a> populations in the struggle against <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israel.html" title="Israel">Israel</a>."

<dd>Thanks for adopting a more constructive attitude. This would be more helpful in order to address your concerns.</dd>
<dd>Based on your comments, it seems that you are not challenging the facts that are stated (otherwise you would have included few documented COUNTER-EXAMPLES), but you are questioning some generalizations.</dd>
<dd>Your concerns could be addressed by re-phrasing and re-organizing the data in the article, and by adding more references to improve the article's accuracy</dd>
<dd>I hope we will be able to work together on these issues in the upcoming days</dd>

<dd>I agree that these additions are problematic, and seem like original research. They also seem to present all random similarities between the two regimes as integral to Baathism. - <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonP_1010.html" title="User:SimonP">SimonP</a> 02:49, 10 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>On the whole I agree with Soman. Also, not everything that happened in Syria or Iraq under Baathist rule (good or bad, though I see we have only bad here) needs to be mentioned in the Baath Party article. The article <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_the_CPSU_484f.html" title="History of the CPSU">History_of_the_CPSU</a>, although not by any means perfect, is an example of an article about a ruling party that does not go into everything that happened in the state. <a href="../../../p/a/l/User%7EPalmiro_d72a.html" title="User:Palmiro">Palmiro</a> | <a href="../../../p/a/l/User_talk%7EPalmiro_7aea.html" title="User talk:Palmiro">Talk</a> 13:43, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
