<p>Dear caretaker team of the "Baud" WIKIPEDIA collaborative webpage, I found the following page's "Jean-Maurice-Émile Baudot, and teleprinting" section very useful (from which I quote below): <a href="http://www.compkarori.com/dbase/bu07sh.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.compkarori.com/dbase/bu07sh.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.compkarori.com/dbase/bu07sh.htm</a></p>
<p>In the (original) telegraph case, a system's Baud is the electro-mechanical maximum signal rate, and since each signal is one bit and about 1/3 are used-up for overhead (see below), the user sees a bits per second transmission rate that is less than the Baud of the transmission system. Shame on the long history of ignorant (or worse) modem speed sales pitches to consumers for the confusion.</p>
<p>If each signal was set and measured more precisely, say at four levels (0,1,2,3) instead of two (0,1) (as was quickly figured-out for modems but not inside computer processors for some reason) the Baud of the system would stay the same while the theoretical transmission speed of the system would increase by eight times, as each signal could represent one of sixteen states instead of two. AVOID CONFUSION, USE BITS PER SECOND, NOT BAUD. NATE88 BETTERDIFFERENT DOT COM <a href="../../../n/8/8/User%7EN888_0b2b.html" title="User:N888">N888</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Normally, when current is flowing, the line is said to be “marking”, and the machine is sitting there with the motor running, waiting for a character to arrive. To prepare the machine to receive a character, a special zero bit is sent, called the start bit. This bit starts the wheels of the machine turning, and the machine counts and records each of the five bits as they arrive on their fixed schedule. When all five bits have arrived, the bits are used to position a print head or piece of type, which strikes the paper through an inked ribbon, marking the character on the page. After the last bit has arrived, the line is kept in the one state (marking) long enough for the decoding mechanism to reset. In Baudot teleprinters, this was 1.42 times as long as the bit time. It became known as the stop bit, although it was required at the end of each character and really did not stop anything. With the start bit, five data bits, and 1.42 stop bits, the Baudot code took 7.42 bit times to print each character. Although the speed of different machines varied, a common standard was for a bit time to be .022 second, for a rate (in Baud) of 45.5 bit times per second. At this rate, a teleprinter could print just over six characters every second, so if you are printing five letter words with spaces in between, that is just over 60 words every minute, a very respectable typing speed, and faster than almost all telegraph operators.</p>

<hr />
<p>Isn't it true to say that "baud rate" actually refers to the <i>potential</i> number of signal changes/symbols transmitted per second? Since, if one second's worth of 0's are transmitted for some reason, the baud rate of the given channel isn't 0, is it?</p>
<dl>
<dd>done -- guest</dd>
</dl>
<p><br />
"baud rate" is a redundant phrase. "baud" is the commonly accepted word for "symbol rate", in so many symbols per second. a "baud rate", then, is a "symbol rate rate", which can only imply symbol acceleration (equivalently, deceleration).</p>

<p>'symbol rate rate' == the rate of change of symbol rate. In this context, it was probably used to illustrate why term "baud rate" is, more often than not, nonsensical.</p>

<p>600 events/second * 2 bits/event = 1200 bits/second, right? [drd]</p>
<p>yep 600baud with four values which means log(4)/log(2)=2 bits per value, if there is 600 of this values in one second then it transmits 1200bits/second</p>

<p>I recommend the addition of a statement to the effect of "Modems have been errounously marketed for years and years using the term 'baud' when in fact the measured speed is in bps". Cause I've bought 9600baud, 19.2Kbaud, 33.6Kbaud and 56Kbaud modems. I've learned a couple times that baud=bps. Bleh. thought the wikipedia way was to acknowledge and refute common misconceptions rather than delete them. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomCerul_1102.html" title="User:TomCerul">TomCerul</a> 18:55, 10 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>The example of a semaphore flag having 8 possible states and thus conveying 3 bits of infomation each second ignores the situation where there is no information in those 8 states to convey and thus the semaphore flag isn't hoisted or is held straight out; e.g., a space between words, no answer yet, etc. The 3-bit-per-second signal rate only holds when a signal is being sent, but the pauses between signals may be equally significant. This is fine where the signals are totally asynchronous, but where the signals are synchronous, there needs to be a null state, which would require 4 bits.</p>

<p>What is the baud for a system such as CDMA, where the channel is modulated at chip rate, with each data symbol comprised of several chips and each data symbol carrying multiple bits, using PSK or QAM to convert bits to symbols? Does it even make sense to ask what the baud is, or is baud only meaningful for a point-to-point channel carrying a single modulated datastream?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Forgetting about the details of the technology for a moment, what is the rate at which symbols are transferred between the sender and receiver? Each symbol may contain multiple bits of information - in the semaphore example, each symbol carries three bits of information. <a href="../../../w/e/s/User%7EWest_London_Dweller_79a2.html" title="User:West London Dweller">WLD</a> 08:13, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>OK. I did refer to it slightly later in the article, but more references aren't a problem. Incidentally, if you move articles, it's normally good practice to check what links to the article (use the "What links here" link on the left) and edit all the linking articles so they point directly to the moved article and don't have to go through redirects. Obviously, in this case, I'm glad you didn't, because it made the task of moving back easier, but I just thought I'd let you know.

<p>In some books ( Tannenbaum, computer networks as example ), I 've found the asseveration that the sample rate should correspond to the boud rate. However, if the boud rate should be interpreted as the symbol rate that is not necessarily true. If you are transmitting by modulated amplitude it is possible that you should have to obtain many samples to obtain one symbol, is not it?. I would appreciate if someone who knows about the subject could explain this.</p>
<dl>
<dd>It would be more correct to say "at least". If you start with many samples, and compute amplitude from that, you can then reduce to one sample per symbol. If the amplitude detector is analog, you can sample its output at one sample per symbol; more typically, with coherent PLL-based detectors in analog, sampling one sample per symbol is very typical, with a symbol-sync PLL to keep the sample phase right where you want it. At least, that's how I used to build them back in the 1970s; nowadays starting with more samples and doing all the synchronization digitally is probably more common. <a href="../../../d/i/c/User%7EDicklyon_1405.html" title="User:Dicklyon">Dicklyon</a> 15:17, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
