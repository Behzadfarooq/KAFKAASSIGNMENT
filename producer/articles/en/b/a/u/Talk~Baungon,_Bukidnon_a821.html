	    <p>Baungon, Bukidnon is a place torn by political rivalry usually between very close families. I know this being a resident of the area.</p>
<p>The first missionaries to arrive in Baungon were the Jesuits (Society of Jesus). They helped a lot in the formation of the different Barrios and Barangays. They would travel to these Barrios riding on a horse and by these means converted the locals to Christianity. Much has been done by the Jesuits for it was through their efforts that the formation of barrios and the Christianization of Baungon came about. They should be mentioned along with the history of Baungon. The Jesuits who had been assigned to the parish were:</p>
<pre>
  1958-1965  Gregory Horgan
  1965       Thomas Connolly
  1968-74    Eduard Van Groenendael
  1974-75    Jose Dacanay
  1975-77    Teodoro Urrutia
  1977-1980  Joseph Bittner
  1980-85    Romeo Serrato
  1985-86    Buddy Wee
</pre>
<p>Our place is home also to the rare <a href="http://botu07.bio.uu.nl/images/Kassen/Amorphophallus%20paeoniifolius%2099GR006890%20a.jpg" class="external text" title="http://botu07.bio.uu.nl/images/Kassen/Amorphophallus%20paeoniifolius%2099GR006890%20a.jpg" rel="nofollow">amorphophallus paeoniifolius</a> which grow tremendously well in Nicdao. We have a very good irrigation system which waters many farms in our area. Two rivers divided the plateau that is Baungon... one is called Bubunawan, and living to its name is very cold. Bugnaw in our language means Cold. The other is Tumala-ong, a good place for swimming and passing time.</p>
<p>After the Jesuits, six filipino secular priests served the parish namely:</p>
<pre>
  1986-89 Gonzalo Pimentel
  1989-92 Danilo Paciente
  1992-95 Rudy Porras
  1995-2000 Erap Nazareno
  2000-2001 Cosme Almedilla
  2001-2006 Diomedes Brigoli 
</pre>
<p>From among the local residents, we have produced 3 women religious: Srs. Wilma Olango, MCJ; Ruth Linaac, RVM; Adie Vallecera, RVM and another three religious missionaries among the men; they are: <a href="http://www.geocities.com/jaranilla/totopix.html" class="external text" title="http://www.geocities.com/jaranilla/totopix.html" rel="nofollow">Fr.

<p>1757 - Apo Mandapagun arrived from Lambaguhon, Kagayha-an (Cagayan de Oro City today) and resided in Buenavista. Apo Mandapagun's brothers and sisters came along with him, they were: Inay Quirenaw, Apo Man-utok, Apo Malughod and Inay Linda Dialangan.</p>
<p>Apo Mandapagun is the father of Apo Dapagun. Apo Dapagun is the father of Apo Matulis. Apo Matulis' children are:</p>
<pre>
 1. Apo Tulis
 2. Apo Amay Tomas Lilangan
 3. Apo Mandintuhan
 4. Apo Ilumon
 5. Inay Botis
 6. Inay Miayana
 7. Inay Musal
 8. Apo Sungkayaw
 9. Inay Laum
10. Apo Mateo Hukmayan 
</pre>
<p>1902 - Old Imbatug was founded.</p>
<p>1918 - an epidemic swept many lives in Old Imbatug</p>
<p>Due to this epidemic, the residents decided to cross back Cagayan river, some hid in the mountains. Those who decided to stay chose Apo Manlibanda as their leader. He called a meeting and proposed that they leave old Imbatug and transfer to Brgy. Imbatug which eventually became the Poblacion.</p>
<p>On their way to Brgy. Imbatug, they stopped at a stream "Pandaug" (Pandahug today) and performed Panlitub - a ritual to drive away the evil spirits symbolizing the epidemic. "Daug" is Victory thus, Pandaug is named to commemorate their victory over the sickness. The land adjacent to the river they named "Mando". "Mando" is TO COMMAND" from the latin word, "Mandatum". This symbolized their command over the evil spirits to leave them in peace. In those days, there were two Mando: Upper and Lower. Mansumina Lilo lived in lower Mando, the part across the mando river near the cemetery now. Upper Mando was the place under the direction of Apo Simbo. The chapel standing now in Mando was constructed by Apo Simbo.</p>
<p>May 6, 1920 - New Poblacion, Imbatug at present is founded</p>
<p>Apo Amay Tomas Lilangan became the first Datu that ruled the New Poblacion. His offspring are:</p>
<pre>
 1. Maria (Laque) Layawan (Inay Bawi)
 2. Rosita Malinawon (Inay Damit)
 3. Cypriano Lilangan (Apo Simbo)
 4. Juliana Oblad (Inay Ombad)
</pre>
<p>1950's the Jesuits came to do Missionary work in Baungon. Apo Simbo built a Chapel in Mando. The story was that an old man appeared to Apo Simbo in a dream urging him to build a Chapel so that the people will be Christianized. This happened and many were converted to Christianity. Since he had three wives, the Jesuits advised him to select only one in conformity with the Christian tradition of monogamy. He chose the second, Inay Apay Laque. Inay Apay had three children from Apo Simbo. These are:</p>
<pre>
 1. Rufino Lilangan
 2. Felomina Bacarro
 3. Oding Cadete
 4. Petronila Jaranilla
</pre>
<p>Important Note: Apo Simbo also adopted the son of his sister Inay Bawi. Adopted was Patricio Layawan which later on kept the maiden name of his mother, thus he became known as Patricio Lilangan.</p>
<p>Patricio Lilangan married Esperanza Nagac. Their children are:</p>
<pre>
  1. Irma Lunaan
  2. Erwina 
  3. Rey Lilangan
  4. Paz Rosaci√±a
  5. Alta Rita Waban
  6. Gemma 
  7. Perla Rara
  8. Nictum Lilangan
  9. Cypriano Lilangan
 10. Teresita Lago
</pre>
<p>The inter-marriage from the tribe of Talakag can be presented this way:</p>
<p>Amay Kalinaw, a prominent family of talakag was the father of Amay Lantungan, Amay Malaque (who became the first husband of Inay Bawi) and the third, Amay Salicobay.</p>
<p>Amay Malaque and Inay Bawi had a son with the name of Juanito Laque.</p>
<p>The second husband of Inay Bawi was Marcos Layawan who begot three children: Eusebio Layawan, Patricio Layawan (later on Lilangan) and Bernabe Layawan.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Amay Salicobay married Carmen Bisang and they bore a son with the name Simeon Salicobay. Simeon married Martina Man-inotao and their children are:</p>
<pre>
  1. Violeta Iway
  2. Felomina Pacana
  3. Anastacia Salicobay
  4. Sonny Boy Salicobay
</pre>

<p>Who is Teodoro Urrutia, SJ?</p>
<p>Fr. Teodoro Urrutia, SJ was born on November 20, 1913 in Nanclaves de Gamboa, Spain. Perhaps because of the influence of the Jesuit education he obtained from St. Francis Xavier at Sanguesa, in Navarro, Fr. Urrutia entered the Society of Jesus on June 7, 1934. He pronounced his first vows two years later and after years of studies and formation was ordained to the priesthood on July 30, 1948. The following year he made his tertianship and then pronounced his final vows on February 2, 1951. As his first assignment, he taught religion, math and literature at the Escuela Profesional Cristo Rey in Burgos, Spain.</p>
<p>Later, he was made principal of that school. In 1962, his dream of being sent to the missions was realized when he was allowed to go to the Philippines. In this country which would become the dominant passion of his Jesuit life, Fr. Urrutia was first assigned to the island of Olutanga in Zamboanga del Sur. There he would be involved in running the Loyola High School in Subanipa while at the same time acting as assistant parish priest of the town. After more than ten years on the island, his missionary zeal would bring him to Bukidnon as where he would serve as assistant parish priest to the different towns of the province, he would stay longer in Baungon, Bukidnon where he became the voice of the poor against the powerful.</p>
<p>In 1977, he was back to his beloved Olutanga island. His apostolic work would take its toll on his health and so in 1988, he was transferred to the Loyola House of Studies in Manila. Despite his health condition however. he would still engage in active ministry, doing pastoral work in the Quezon Institute and then chaplaincy work for the Sisters of Mary Boystown and Girlstown in Silang, Cavite and Sta. Mesa, Manila. In 2003, his health condition worsened and on August 26, 2004, Fr. Teodoro Urrutia, SJ, finally joined his Creator whom he had faithfully served with his outstanding dedication to the missionary work of the Society of Jesus.</p>
<p>Hasta Luego, Don Teodoro!</p>
