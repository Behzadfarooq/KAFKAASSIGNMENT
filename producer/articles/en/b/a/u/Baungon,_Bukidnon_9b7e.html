<p>HIGAONON TRIBE AS FOUNDERS OF IMBATUG</p>
<p>1757 - Apo Mandapagun arrived from Lambaguhon, Kagayha-an (Cagayan de Oro City today) and resided in Buenavista. Apo Mandapagun's brothers and sisters came along with him, they were: Inay Quirenaw, Apo Man-utok, Apo Malughod and Inay Linda Dialangan.</p>
<p>Apo Mandapagun is the father of Apo Dapagun. Apo Dapagun is the father of Apo Matulis. Apo Matulis' children were:</p>
<pre>
1. Apo Tulis
2. Apo Amay Tomas Lilangan
3. Apo Mandintuhan
4. Apo Ilumon
5. Inay Botis
6. Inay Miayana
7. Inay Musal
8. Apo Sungkayaw
9. Inay Laum
</pre>
<p>10. Apo Mateo Hukmayan</p>
<p><br />
In the year 1902, Old Imbatug was founded by the family that descended from Apo Mandapagun. The year 1918 was a turning point of Imbatug’s history. An epidemic swept many lives in Old Imbatug. Due to this epidemic, the residents decided to cross again Cagayan river and left Old Imbatug. Some hid in the mountains wary of the curse of the evil spirits of the place. Many died that it is even told, “so sickly were the people that those who bury the dead in the morning were the ones buried in the afternoon.” The few who decided to stay despite the odds chose Apo Manlibanda as their leader. He called a meeting and proposed that they leave old Imbatug and transfer to Barangay Imbatug which eventually became the Poblacion.</p>
<p>On their way to Barangay Imbatug, they stopped by the river "Pandaug" (Pandahug today) and performed Panlitub. Panlitub was an important ritual to drive away the evil spirits symbolizing the sweeping epidemic. "Daug" is “victory” thus, Pandaug is named to commemorate their victory over the sickness. The land adjacent to the river they named "Mando". "Mando" is “TO COMMAND” from the latin word, "Mandatum". This symbolized their command over the evil spirits urging these to leave them in peace. In those days, there were two Mando: Upper and Lower Mando. Mansumina Lilo lived in Lower Mando, the part across the Mando river near the cemetery now. Upper Mando was the place under the direction of Apo Simbo. The chapel standing now in Mando was first built by Apo Simbo.</p>
<p>It is said that Apo Simbo prior to the Christianization of Imbatug had a dream. In this dream, he saw a beautiful lady approached him from the direction of the river Mando. She told Apo Simbo to construct a Chapel that the people under his care would receive sacraments and became Christians. Due to this dream, Apo Simbo’s family decided to choose the Lady of Fatima as the patroness of Mando.</p>
<p><br />
COMMUNING WITH THE SPIRITS</p>
<p>Even before Christianity arrived in Baungon, the elders already commune with the Spirit World. When sickness visited them, they would consult the spirits of the earth, the air, the balete tree, the forests, the river and all elements that have to do with nature. For example, Mansumina Lilo and Apo Simbo are called when children of the tribe suffer from ailments. They would consult their spear (bangkaw) and let it identify the spirits hurt by the child who is ill. They called this process “Bala-on” (Stopping the spirits from doing further damage). This is done by stretching the both arms between the spear. It is said that if they identify the spirit who is giving suffering to the child, the spear can be arm stretched from tip to tip. If the fingers will not reach the two tips of the spear then the spirits are not yet identified. When the spirits are identified, for instance, the spirit of balete tree allows itself be identified as the cause of ailment, only then will they look for herbal medicines appropriate for those hounded by the spirits and cure will come to the ailing child.</p>
<p><br />
ANIMISM THE OLD WAY OF HIGAONONS</p>
<p>Animism ruled the land before the coming of the Christian Missionaries. Strange to say but they ascribe everything that is going on around them to the spirits that surround the people. When a child drowns, they say he/she was pulled by the spirits of the water. Spirits lurks in places not visited often by people. In fact, they say these spirits did not want to be disturbed that’s why they inflict misery to those who will disturb them.</p>
<p><br />
CHRISTIANIZATION BY THE JESUITS</p>
<p>The first missionaries to arrive in Baungon were the Jesuits (Society of Jesus). They helped a lot in the formation of the different Barrios and Barangays. They would travel to these Barrios riding on the back of horses and by these means converted the locals to Christianity. Much has been done by the Jesuits for it was through their efforts that the formation of barrios and the Christianization of Baungon came about. They should be mentioned with the history of Baungon. The Jesuits who had been assigned to the parish were:</p>
<pre>
 1958-1966                 Gregory Horgan
 1966-67        Thomas Connolly
 1967-74                Eduard Van Groenendael
 1974-75                Jose Dacanay
 1975-77                Teodoro Urrutia
 1977-1980              Joseph Bittner
 1980-85                Romeo Serrato
 1985-86                Buddy Wee
</pre>
<p>But we need to take note that before the parish was even founded, the parish of Talakag helped in the missions. Frs. Neri, Dulalas, Martinez and Cebrero were invited to help in the sacramental work of Imbatug. Imbatug was declared a Parish on May 15, 1959. After the Jesuits, six filipino secular priests served the parish namely:</p>
<pre>
 1986-89           Gonzalo Pimentel
 1989-92                Danilo Paciente
 1992-95                Rudy Porras
 1995-2000              Flordelito Nazareno
 2000-2001              Cosme Almedilla
 2001-2007              Diomedes Brigoli 
</pre>
<p>From among the local residents, we have produced 3 women religious: Srs. Wilma Olango, MCJ; Ruth Linaac, RVM; Adie Vallecera, RVM and another three religious missionaries among the men; they are: Fr. Sirenio Jaranilla, O.Carm; Bro. Ransom Rapirap, OCD; and Fr. Ritche Catubo of the Military Diocese.</p>
<p>APO TOMAS LILANGAN, FIRST DATU</p>
<p>May 6, 1920, the New Poblacion Imbatug was founded. As the clouds of the epidemic cleared away, Apo Amay Tomas Lilangan became the first Datu appointed by the elders to rule the New Poblacion. His offspring were:</p>
<p>1. Inay Bawi. Her Christian name was Maria.</p>
<pre>
      (She first married the Laque family and later on the Layawan
       family)
</pre>
<p>2. Rosita Malinawon (Inay Damit) 3. Juliana Oblad (Inay Ombad) 4. Cypriano Lilangan (Apo Simbo)</p>
<p>The side of Mando was awarded by their father Datu Tomas Lilangan to Cypriano Lilangan (Apo Simbo) It was in 1950's that Apo Simbo built a Chapel in Mando. Many of the Higaonons were converted to Christianity through the efforts of Apo Simbo in collaboration with the Jesuits. Since Apo Simbo had three wives, the Jesuits advised him to select only one in conformity with the Christian tradition of monogamy. He chose the second, Inay Apay Laque. Inay Apay had four children from Apo Simbo. Other wives were Teodorica Lilo and Inay Juliana Atlawon. The children of Inay Apay are:</p>
<p>1. Rufino Lilangan 2. Felomina Bacarro 3. Leonora Cadete 4. Petronila Jaranilla</p>
<p>An important addendum to the Historical Note: Apo Simbo also adopted the son of his elder sister Inay Bawi. Adopted was Patricio Layawan which later on kept the maiden name of his mother, Inay Bawi thus he became known as Patricio Lilangan.</p>
<p>Inay Bawi, the mother of Patricio Lilangan, married first Amay Malaque and they had a son with the name of Juanito Laque. Juanito Laque married Salud Sacal. Their daughter was Remedios Laque who married Meling Catubo.</p>
<p>The second husband of Inay Bawi was Marcos Layawan. From Marcos, Inay Bawi begot two children: Patricio Layawan (later on Lilangan) and Bernabe Layawan. Bernabe Layawan studied in Bethel School in Talakag. Thus, he embraced the protestant religion different from his relatives. His son, Arquipo Layawan is now serving also as a Protestant Minister in Baungon.</p>
<p>Marcos Layawan before he married Inay Bawi had a son with the name of Eusebio Layawan.</p>
<p>Patricio Lilangan married Esperanza Nagac. Their children are:</p>
<p>1. Irma Lunaan 2. Erwina 3. Rey Lilangan 4. Paz Rosaciña 5. Alta Rita Waban 6. Gemma Cadevero 7. Perla Rara 8. Nictum Lilangan 9. Cypriano Lilangan 10. Teresita Lago</p>
<p>INTERMARRIAGE WITH THE TALAKAG TRIBE</p>
<p>The inter-marriage from the tribe of Talakag can be presented this way:</p>
<p>Amay Kalinaw, a prominent family of Talakag was the father of Amay Lantungan and Amay Malaque. Amay Malaque of Talakag became the first husband of Inay Bawi. As the family of Talakag transferred to Imbatug through inter-marriage, an offspring of prominence was also formed. This is the family of Amay Salicobay. It was this Amay Salicobay who married Carmen Bisang and they bore a son with the name Simeon Salicobay. Simeon married Martina Man-inotao and their children are:</p>
<p>1. Violeta Iway 2. Felomina Pacana 3. Anastacia Salicobay 4. Sonny Boy Salicobay</p>
<p>THE COMING OF THE DUMAGATS</p>
<p>Before the outbreak of World War II, Baungon was a forestal and pasture land. With its rich natural resources, fertile soil and favorable climate condition, many migrants from the provinces of Lanao and Misamis Oriental settled in Imbatug. Progress has highlighted not only the area of Imbatug but it expanded to the entire Baungon area. After the Higaonons came the Dumagats. First Dumagat settlers were the family of Alejandro Linaac. It was during his time that the government granted the division of first settlers with 24 Hectares every family. Two teachers came, they were Mr. Lope M. Rara and Mr. Meliton Magdales. They served as public school teachers. They were the first to teach letters to the local people. The first group of farmers who came were the family of Mr. Mano Pabillaran and the Bacarro’s. Later on Liborio Jangao, Sr. followed suit.</p>
