<b>Summary of Napster Case</b></p>
<p><br />
-Napster is a program developed by Shawn Fanning to trade high-quality digital copies of music files (mp3s) over the net.</p>
<p>-Began operations on June.1 1999.</p>
<p>-From the beginning Napster was controversial. They were sued by (RIAA) Recording Industry Association of America, which represents major music labels Universal, BMG and Sony, for violating copyright laws.</p>
<p>-RIAA sought an injunction to stop the downloading of copywritten songs and for damages from lost revenue.</p>
<p>-July.26,2000 judge granted request for injunction to stop making copywritten music files available for download. -Napster appealed so the case went to trial</p>
<p>- Napster found guilty, and were ordered to stop allowing users to share copywritten recordings without properly compensating the owners of the material.</p>
<p>- Napster offered $1 billion to record industry to settle lawsuit. Record executives refused to accept this. They would settle for nothing less than shutting Napster down.</p>
<p>- Company could not shut down immediately without negatively affecting the artists who gave consent for their material to be on Napster. Napster therefore had to immediately block the sharing of all songs on a list of 5000 provided by the RIAA.</p>
<p>- After failed attempts at reaching a compromise with the record industry and the blocked sale of Napster to a German company, Napster was eventually shut down on Sept.23, 2002. - Napster laid off entire staff and company entered liquidation</p>
<p>-Napster was relaunched as Napster 2.0 on Oct.29, 2003 by German CD burning software company Roxio.</p>
<p>-New rates of $.99 per track and $9.95 per album. 500,000 plus songs to choose from.</p>
<p><br />
<b>Problem posed by case</b></p>
<p>Can Napster 2.0 regain the dominance in the online music industry that it once enjoyed as Napster, despite recent regulations and heavy competition?</p>
<p><br />
<b>Position and Logic behind it</b></p>
<p><br />
NO, we dont think that Napster will be able to return to its spot as market leader in the online music indusrty in the near future, under current conditions.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br />
HI&#160;! I put the part of Sunny and I would like to make some modifications... you can see them in italics. I was wondering what form our case must have&#160;? maybe we can write a case like Sunny did and prepare our oral presentation like Adam did. Is is okay for everybody&#160;?</p>
<p>Thank you for your work&#160;!</p>

<p><b>I. Situational Analysis</b></p>
<p>A. Nature of Demand</p>
<p>- Most of people like to listen to music. - Many of them do not want to purchase Album before they actually try. (These people will use Naptster)</p>
<p>B. Extent of Demand</p>
<p>-The extent of demand is quite broad (people listen music regardless of age) - Some people may listened different types of music, not specific singer or album -However, people with old age, especially who are not good at computer, will not able to use Napster. -Some people who are sensitive on quality of music will not use Napster. -Also, people who afraid of security of their computer will not use Napster</p>
<p>C. Nature of competition</p>
<p>- Many of similar programs were available after Napter enter the market. - Other competitors may set up similar program easily. - Demand of program is elastic. (Consumer could simply change their choice of selecting program</p>
<p>D. Environmental climate ??? (I am not sure what this mean is)</p>
<p>-the market boomed with rapid speed “Napster became one of the most popular sites on the internet, claiming some 15 millions users in little more than a year” (p316) )=&gt; <i>in the extent of demand</i></p>
<p>(Market was heated quickly)</p>
<p>E. Stage of Product Life Cycle</p>
<p>• Product Development- Shawn Fanning, founder of Napster, left college to develop a technology to trade music over the internet. • Market Introduction -began operation on June 1, 1999, allowed computer user to share high-quality digital copies of music recordings via internet. • Market Growth- ( I am not sure ….. ) )=&gt; <i>in the extent of demand</i> • Market Maturity- “Napster became one of the most popular sites on the internet, claiming some 15 millions users in little more than a year” (p316) • Sales Decline-after RIAA sue them for infringement of its copy right and court ordered to stop Napster’s operation.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>F. Skills of the firm - allies with many different firms (MS, YAHOO, GATEWAY, and SAMSUNG) - Napster was a first mover in market (entered in the market first, and had opportunity to introduce and improve their system earlier than its competitors. Thus they had strong brand name reputation) - agreement with five major recording label. - <i>innovative, practical, free...</i></p>
<p>G. Financial resources of the firm - partnerships by advertising</p>
<p>H. Distribution structure via internet</p>
<p><b>II. Problems and opportunities</b></p>
<p>A. Key problem areas</p>
<p>- Napster did not take the legal steps. - low entering barrier ( other competitors entered market easily, # of competitors exist in a year.) - Consumers are elastic ( change program with simple decision making) - The program effected revenue of music industry; music industry claim that Napster and similar firms had cist the music industry more than $300 million in lost. (p316) – resulting these industry to sue the company.</p>
<p>B. Key opportunities--</p>
<p>Demand was high, had quick growth. - First mover in the market&#160;: company growth with rapid speed. - had good relationship with other company. - <i>based on a no limit demand&#160;: everybody listen to music</i></p>
<p>C. On balance, the situation is....</p>
<p>Naptster had many problems to change&#160;: <i>the image, the trust, the credibility</i> it has to restructure its image and marketing policy in order to convince again the new and former customers.</p>
<p><b>III. Generation and evaluation of alternative marketing programs</b></p>
<p>A. Objectives defined <i>to restrucure the image of the firm</i></p>
<p>B. Marketing Mix/program decisions <i>to concentrate to the legal side</i></p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/3/User_talk%7EBA3304_fdf5.html" title="Edit section: Championship Auto Racing Teams">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Championship Auto Racing Teams</span></h2>
<p>Case 4: CART</p>
<p>The following recommendations were created with the goal in mind of Championship Auto Racing Teams restore its prestige and become leader of open-wheel racing. CART was created in 1978 by racing team and dominated auto racing in United States the first 17 years of its existence. But 1994, Tony George, President of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, decided to compete with CART and created Indy Racing League. Only IRL league could participle to the Indianapolis 500. Few years after the creation of IRL, CART started struggling with troubles. So this is to propose that the company do a partnership with the IRL to create a unified “open-wheel racing championship”, which could be called OWRC. The company could operate in United States of America and international markets and race both in oval and road tracks. So it will give to the market something new and different from what still exist today. The company position and advertise get broad recognition as having the best and must complete drivers. What it can also do, is to establish a “top drivers” as fan favorites for commercial events etc…</p>
<p>First of all let’s talk a little bit about the company. The strengths of the company are the following. First the company organizes international events. It holds events in several countries and has international drivers. The firm has also a partnership with Speed Channel, with extra coverage before and after race. CART has a long history and experience in this area. And it detains some of the best and more competitive drivers. Nevertheless it appears is the past years that the company has many weaknesses. In fact it lost three major partnerships (Honda, Toyota…) and lost FedEx as sponsor. CART has some problems to deal on some aspects and suffer from a lack of brand recognition and of racers personalities, because several drivers quit the team in the past few years. Finally we can see that the management of the team is weak, because of the constant change of leader, sponsor and drivers.</p>
<p>Now let’s take a look at the racing market. The major competitor of CART is IRL, even if both company present many differences. But the market has still many opportunities. In United States of America road courses are not too famous and in foreigners markets oval courses are less common. So to increase the popularity of the racing events, it could develop a festival atmosphere and exploit the excitement atmosphere some as NASCAR. The company could also use the long week end to develop activities before and after the actual races. The main threats for CART are that they cannot compete in the Indianapolis 500, which is one of the more important racing event of the years and that some of the former popular CART drivers are now with the competitors.</p>
