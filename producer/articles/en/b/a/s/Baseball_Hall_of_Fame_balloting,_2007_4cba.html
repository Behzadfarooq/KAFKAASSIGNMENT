<p>The BBWAA was again authorized to elect players active in 1987 or later, but not after 2001; the ballot, announced on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_27.html" title="November 27">November 27</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006_in_baseball.html" title="2006 in baseball">2006</a>, included candidates from the <a href="../../../b/a/s/Baseball_Hall_of_Fame_balloting%2C_2006_b83c.html" title="Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 2006">2006 ballot</a> who received at least 5% of the vote but were not elected, along with selected players, chosen by a screening committee, whose last appearance was in 2001. All 10-year members of the BBWAA were eligible to vote.</p>
<p>Voters were instructed to cast votes for up to 10 candidates; any candidate who received votes on at least 75% of the ballots would be honored with induction to the Hall. Results of the 2007 election by the BBWAA were announced on <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_9.html" title="January 9">January 9</a>. The ballot consisted of 32 players; a record 545 ballots were cast, with 409 votes required for election. A total of 3584 individual votes were cast, an average of 6.58 per ballot. Those candidates who received less than 5% of the vote will not appear on future BBWAA ballots, but may eventually be considered by the Veterans Committee.</p>
<p>Candidates who were eligible for the first time are indicated here with a †. There were 15 candidates returning from the 2006 ballot; <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steve_Garvey_7b83.html" title="Steve Garvey">Steve Garvey</a> was on the ballot for the 15th and final time. The two candidates who received at least 75% of the vote and were elected are indicated in <i><b>bold italics</b></i>. The 15 candidates who received less than 5% of the vote, thus becoming ineligible for future BBWAA consideration, are indicated with a *.</p>

<p>The newly-eligible candidates included 26 All-Stars, eight of whom were selected at least five times, and ten of whom were not even included on the ballot. For only the second time (equalling 1982), three players with 400 home runs were among the new candidates; the five newly eligible players with 300 home runs were a new high (exceeding the 1980 total), and the twelve new candidates with 200 home runs shattered the previous high mark of eight, set in 1992. With the exception of the first balloting in 1936, it was the second time that two players with 3000 hits debuted on the ballot (<a href="../../../t/o/n/Tony_Gwynn_d76d.html" title="Tony Gwynn">Tony Gwynn</a> and <a href="../../../c/a/l/Cal_Ripken%2C_Jr._167a.html" title="Cal Ripken, Jr.">Cal Ripken, Jr.</a>), and also the second time that two players with 1500 RBI made their initial appearances (Ripken and <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harold_Baines_593b.html" title="Harold Baines">Harold Baines</a>). Again excepting 1936, the numbers of newly eligible candidates with 2000 hits (7), 2500 hits (3), 1000 RBI (9), 1200 RBI (5), 3000 total bases (11), 3500 total bases (5) or 4000 total bases (3) all tied or broke previous records. As expected, Gwynn and Ripken were elected on the first ballot; the other first-time candidates were generally seeking simply enough votes to remain on the ballot for the 2008 election, when a much less crowded field is expected. However, of the first-timers who were not elected, only two—McGwire and Baines—received enough votes to make the 2008 ballot, and had Baines received two fewer votes, he also would have become ineligible for BBWAA consideration.</p>

<p>Performance-enhancing substances, which had made headlines in the sport for the past several years, became a factor in voting for the first time. Two <a href="../../../m/l/b/MLB_Most_Valuable_Player_Award_8b7f.html" title="MLB Most Valuable Player Award">MVP</a> winners who later admitted to <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anabolic_steroid.html" title="Anabolic steroid">steroid</a> use – <a href="../../../j/o/s/Jos%C3%A9_Canseco_a441.html" title="José Canseco">José Canseco</a> and <a href="../../../k/e/n/Ken_Caminiti_fbf0.html" title="Ken Caminiti">Ken Caminiti</a> – were both among the first-time candidates. More prominently, McGwire was appearing on the ballot for the first time; considered a highly likely first-ballot selection following his record-setting home run feats in the late 1990s, his candidacy was heavily debated more recently as observers of the sport considered both his admitted use of legal dietary supplements (particularly <a href="../../../a/n/d/Androstenedione.html" title="Androstenedione">androstenedione</a>, which he stopped using in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1998_in_baseball.html" title="1998 in baseball">1998</a> and was banned in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004_in_baseball.html" title="2004 in baseball">2004</a>), as well as suspicions in some quarters that he had also used steroids. The voters took these matters into consideration, individually determining how recent offensive totals should be regarded by the Hall, as the first players from the sport's offensive explosion in the late 1990s now began to appear on the ballot in significant numbers.</p>
<p>In November 2006, the <a href="../../../a/s/s/Associated_Press_9ff2.html" title="Associated Press">Associated Press</a> received responses from 125 baseball writers they had asked about their voting plans; about 3/4 of those who had decided were against electing McGwire, at least for the time being.<sup id="_ref-Blum_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Blum" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p><i><a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Daily_News_8d56.html" title="New York Daily News">New York Daily News</a></i> sportswriter Bill Madden, who has also been part of the Veterans Committee selection process since 2003, said he will not vote for any player he even suspects of using steroids, citing the ballot guidelines which include a player's integrity as being among the five criteria voters should consider: "I'm not voting for any of those guys – <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barry_Bonds_ea55.html" title="Barry Bonds">Bonds</a>, McGwire, <a href="../../../s/a/m/Sammy_Sosa_e94a.html" title="Sammy Sosa">Sosa</a>, <a href="../../../r/a/f/Rafael_Palmeiro_7c56.html" title="Rafael Palmeiro">Palmeiro</a>, any of them.

<p><i><a href="../../../u/s/a/USA_Today_69f3.html" title="USA Today">USA Today</a></i> writer Bob Nightengale stated that even proof of steroid use would not cause him to withhold his vote, noting, "So many other guys were taking them, including pitchers. So it's almost like a level playing field ... everybody was allowed to cheat, you still choose the best of that particular era." He nonetheless indicated that he would likely withhold his vote from McGwire for at least a year or two, saying, "The biggest trouble I have with McGwire, he hit so many home runs in such a short period of time.

Observing that candidates initially have 15 years in which to be elected, Boswell added, "McGwire's name will still be on the Hall of Fame ballot.

<p>Some writers were sharply critical of McGwire for his remarks in Congressional hearings in March 2005, in which he stated: "I will not participate in naming names and implicating my friends and teammates. Asking me, or any other player, to answer questions about who took steroids in front of television cameras will not solve this problem. If a player answers, 'No,' he simply will not be believed. If he answers, 'Yes,' he risks public scorn and endless government investigations." Many voters expressed concerns that his remarks constituted an implied confession.

<p>After the results of the writers' balloting were announced, Stark was sharply critical of most of the writers who chose not to vote for Ripken or Gwynn, though he mildly defended Ladewski's decision. On Ripken, he noted:</p>

<td valign="top" style="padding:4px 10px;">It sounds like a great thing to say that Cal Ripken attracted the third-highest vote percentage (98.53) of all time. But it's actually unfathomable — and indefensible — that it wasn't higher. There were two blank ballots submitted in this election, as steroid protest votes. But what's the excuse of those other six voters — none of whom had identified or explained themselves as of Tuesday afternoon? As someone who has said it makes more sense to vote for no players of that generation than it does to pick and choose based on guesses and suspicions, I at least have an understanding of why a voter would turn in a blank ballot. But there is no other responsible reason — none — to withhold a vote for Ripken.<sup id="_ref-Stark_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Stark" title="">[9]</a></sup></td>

<p>The following day, Bill Shannon of Sports Press Service stated that he had not voted for Ripken or Gwynn, solely because he felt there were ten other worthy candidates who needed his vote more: "I thought they were such obvious candidates they didn't need my vote. I wasn't thinking in terms of a 100 percent."<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>

<td valign="top" style="padding:4px 10px;">And the same goes for Tony Gwynn, who should have been an easier choice than Ripken.

<td valign="top" style="padding:4px 10px;">Once again, no one was voted into the Hall of Fame unanimously, but the good thing is that we're seeing a decline in the old curmudgeons who still believe that no one should be elected unanimously because Babe Ruth, <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christy_Mathewson_bb80.html" title="Christy Mathewson">Christy Mathewson</a>, <a href="../../../w/i/l/Willie_Mays_bc08.html" title="Willie Mays">Willie Mays</a>, blah, blah, blah, weren't elected unanimously.

<p>Among the newly eligible players who were <i>not</i> included were <a href="../../../r/i/c/Rick_Monday_fc91.html" title="Rick Monday">Rick Monday</a>, <a href="../../../b/u/c/Bucky_Dent_dce4.html" title="Bucky Dent">Bucky Dent</a>, <a href="../../../j/e/f/Jeff_Burroughs_226f.html" title="Jeff Burroughs">Jeff Burroughs</a>, <a href="../../../l/o/u/Lou_Piniella_4bdb.html" title="Lou Piniella">Lou Piniella</a>, <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richie_Hebner_dba5.html" title="Richie Hebner">Richie Hebner</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/k/Mike_Torrez_e3b0.html" title="Mike Torrez">Mike Torrez</a>, <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Splittorff_fbe9.html" title="Paul Splittorff">Paul Splittorff</a> and <a href="../../../o/s/c/Oscar_Gamble_a34c.html" title="Oscar Gamble">Oscar Gamble</a>. As in previous years, the 200 players were almost evenly divided between players retired less than 50 years (98 players retired from 1957 to 1985) and those retired over 50 years (102 players retired 1956 or earlier).</p>
<p>The list of 200 was almost identical to the list prepared for the 2005 election; apart from the twelve players who were newly eligible, only left fielders <a href="../../../s/h/e/Sherry_Magee_046c.html" title="Sherry Magee">Sherry Magee</a> and <a href="../../../c/l/y/Clyde_Milan_9a5e.html" title="Clyde Milan">Clyde Milan</a> and pitcher Slim Sallee (three players of the 1910s) were added, for a net change of 15 individuals. Perhaps due to the reliance on <i>official</i> statistics – often incomplete in the sport's early years – provided by the <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elias_Sports_Bureau_b33c.html" title="Elias Sports Bureau">Elias Sports Bureau</a>, the committee included very few players from the sport's first half-century, which remains poorly represented in the Hall; only 14 players were included who made their debut before 1893 (one fewer than in 2005). Although the Hall's current membership includes fewer than a dozen non-pitchers of the 1870s and 1880s, compared to nearly 50 from the 1930s and 1940s, the committee included over 40 more players from the period between 1920 and 1945, but only 7 who played primarily in the 25 years before 1893: first baseman/outfielder Harry Stovey, shortstop Jack Glasscock, outfielder Pete Browning, and pitchers Charlie Buffinton, Bob Caruthers, Tony Mullane and Will White. For the third time, Will White was included even though his brother <a href="../../../d/e/a/Deacon_White_07d0.html" title="Deacon White">Deacon</a> is widely accepted as having been a far greater player. In addition to Deacon White, stars of the 19th century who were omitted included <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Hines_ec98.html" title="Paul Hines">Paul Hines</a>, <a href="../../../d/e/a/Deacon_McGuire_12f9.html" title="Deacon McGuire">Deacon McGuire</a>, <a href="../../../c/u/p/Cupid_Childs_7e90.html" title="Cupid Childs">Cupid Childs</a>, <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bobby_Lowe_3426.html" title="Bobby Lowe">Bobby Lowe</a>, <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Gore_8cb6.html" title="George Gore">George Gore</a>, <a href="../../../h/a/r/Hardy_Richardson_84e2.html" title="Hardy Richardson">Hardy Richardson</a>, <a href="../../../e/z/r/Ezra_Sutton_c6b0.html" title="Ezra Sutton">Ezra Sutton</a>, <a href="../../../a/r/l/Arlie_Latham_501c.html" title="Arlie Latham">Arlie Latham</a>, <a href="../../../f/r/e/Fred_Pfeffer_6f09.html" title="Fred Pfeffer">Fred Pfeffer</a> and <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joe_Start_6d3e.html" title="Joe Start">Joe Start</a>. Broken down by primary position, the 200 players included:</p>
<p>Starting pitchers (67), relief pitchers (10), catchers (10), first basemen (21), second basemen (5), third basemen (11), shortstops (18), left fielders (17), center fielders (22) and right fielders (19).</p>
<p>Of the 15 players who were dropped from the 2005 list, nearly all were infielders (11) or pitchers (3), with <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hank_Sauer_a1d8.html" title="Hank Sauer">Hank Sauer</a> being the only outfielder dropped; as had been true in earlier years, the list of preliminary candidates seemed to have been developed based on raw offensive totals, with less regard for defensive ability or considerations of era.</p>

<p>53 of the 60 candidates were holdovers from the 2003 list; along with the three newly eligible candidates, the four additions were Bing Devine, John McSherry, Jake Ruppert, and Charlie Grimm (who had been included on the players' list in both 2003 and 2005). The candidates include 31 individuals who were primarily executives, 19 who were managers, and 10 who were umpires. Davey Johnson, like Grimm, was dropped from the players' ballot after being included there in 2003 and 2005; evidently the review committee members regarded Johnson (age 63) as having been retired since 2000 even though he had managed the U.S. team in the 2005 Baseball World Cup, and served as a bench coach in the 2006 <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Baseball_Classic_5e0b.html" title="World Baseball Classic">World Baseball Classic</a>.

The BBWAA screening committee failed to include any candidates from the era before 1910. This likely reflected a tendency among the voting writers to vote only for those players they had seen themselves, and to withhold votes from earlier players.</p>
<p>All 61 living members of the Hall were eligible to cast ballots in the final election, along with the 8 living recipients of the <a href="../../../j/2E/g/J.G._Taylor_Spink_Award_bed8.html" title="J.G.

Balloting was conducted by mail in January 2007, with voters permitted to vote for up to 10 candidates from each ballot; <i>all</i> candidates who received at least 75% of the vote would be elected. Results of the voting by the Veterans Committee were announced on <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_27.html" title="February 27">February 27</a>.</p>
<p>There were 84 eligible voters. 82 cast ballots in the players election, with 62 votes required for election; 81 cast ballots in the composite election, with 61 votes required for election. In all, 489 individual votes were cast on the players ballot, for an average of 5.96 votes per ballot, while 338 individual votes were cast on the composite ballot, an average of 4.17 votes per ballot. For the third consecutive Veterans Committee election, no one was elected. Of the 23 players who were also on the 2005 ballot, 14 received fewer votes in 2007, with only Jim Kaat (9), Don Newcombe (9), Maury Wills (7) and Ron Santo (5) increasing their totals by at least five votes. The 27 candidates on the players' ballot, with one player newly eligible since 2005 indicated with a †, were:</p>

<p>Following the third consecutive election in which there were no selections, and with only minimal gains by individual candidates over that period, Hall of Fame chairwoman Jane Forbes Clark suggested that the Hall's board of directors might make changes in the process before the next scheduled election in 2009, saying, "We are disappointed that no one has been elected in the three voting cycles. We will be evaluating this process and its trends at our next meeting, which is <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_13.html" title="March 13">March 13</a>, and discussing whether there should be any changes." She added, "The board may decide that the trends are not what we thought they were going to be. Perhaps this hasn't worked as well as some of the board members thought it would and maybe it needs a little bit of change."<sup id="_ref-Walker_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Walker" title="">[15]</a></sup> The board took no action at its March meeting, opting to continue discussions before its next meeting during induction weekend in July.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[16]</a></sup></p>
<p>Hall of Fame member and vice chairman <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joe_Morgan_fe7f.html" title="Joe Morgan">Joe Morgan</a> tried to deflect criticism, saying, "We're being blamed because something hasn't happened. If you're asking me, 'Do we lower our standards to get more people in?' my answer would be no." Noting that he voted for the maximum 10 players, he added, "I feel there are some guys out there that belong in the Hall of Fame," but also said, "The writers voted on these people for 15 years and they weren't elected. Why are we being criticized because we haven't elected someone?"<sup id="_ref-Walker_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Walker" title="">[15]</a></sup></p>
<p>Joe Torre, who received less than half the required number of votes (but is widely expected to be elected once he is eligible for consideration as a manager), expressed disappointment that no one was selected and said, "I'm not exactly sure what process they use. Don't forget, you've got the old guard and the young guard. People with different interests."<sup id="_ref-Walker_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Walker" title="">[15]</a></sup></p>
<p>And Hall of Famer <a href="../../../m/i/k/Mike_Schmidt_edb6.html" title="Mike Schmidt">Mike Schmidt</a> noted his support for Jim Kaat and observed that other members also had "their guys," admitting, "Maybe that is the problem when you are trying to evaluate 'bubble' players on entrance.
