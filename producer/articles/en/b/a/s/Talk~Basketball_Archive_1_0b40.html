<h2><span class="mw-headline">Restructured Article</span></h2>
<p>I largely restructured this article, since I found many parts that were non-NPOV or had a largely American bias. However, some of the part I cut out may still be interesting and may be included again in rewritten form. I list them here:</p>
<p>"Once in Scranton, Pennsylvania, a player got a bleeding cut from a plug of tobacco thrown by a spectator. Another time, a female spectator along the baseline stabbed a player after removing the hatpin from her hat."</p>
<p>"Today, the professional teams are far fewer; the game is tightly controlled by the League office; players are not allowed to jump from one team to another, except at certain times in certain circumscribed ways. The arenas are so large and well-lit as to have lost much of their soul."</p>
<p>"Basketball reminds many spectators of jazz, and both art forms have been heavily influenced by African-American rhythms. Both require a series of fundamental skills but are improvisatory; each has about five players, playing together, with frequent solos by the star players."</p>
<p>"If basketball's origins are Scottish-Calvinist and Presbyterian, its greatest players and innovators have been from distinctly different backgrounds. <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hank_Luisetti_6965.html" title="Hank Luisetti">Hank Luisetti</a> introduced the running one-handed shot; <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Mikan_3c97.html" title="George Mikan">George Mikan</a> pioneered the dominant inside play at the center position; <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Cousy_6456.html" title="Bob Cousy">Bob Cousy</a> revolutionized the point guard position with his remarkable dribbling and passing. All three were the children of immigrants."</p>
<p>"People often call basketball "the city game" and it's certainly accessible to poor urban children because the equipment is so minimal. But in rural Indiana and Wyoming, to name just two states, basketball has been almost a religion. City players tend to have more confidence and court savvy, but some of the greatest basketball players have been from small towns."</p>
<p>"Though only five players on each side can play at any one time, the "sixth man" has an important place in winning basketball. A sixth man is the first substitute in the game, and a good one can instantly change the tempo of the game, by speeding up the scoring of his own team, or clamping down on the scoring of the opponent. Officiating basketball well is quite an art, as too many calls break the flow of the game but too few calls inhibit the players' artistry and invite thuggery."</p>
<p><a name="Replaced_street_game_text" id="Replaced_street_game_text"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">Replaced street game text</span></h2>
<p>I replaced the following text. The winning score for street games varies a lot; I doubt "usually" is really valid for any one score. Mark Foskey</p>
<p>Usually, the first team to reach fifteen points wins, but this is based on a system where each short range basket counts for one point, long range ones for two. When the universal scoring system is used (2 points for short range shots, three for long range ones), street teams might set the game to be played for the first team to reach 30 points, although sometimes they play for 20, 40, 50, 60 or any amount of points that the players desire to play up to. Free throws (one point shots in the professional leagues and tournaments) are usually waved off on street games.</p>

<i>Basketball is a ball sport played by two teams of five players on a side</i> - does anybody play half-court any more, with six players on each team but only three can cross the halfcourt line? <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickK_c665.html" title="User:RickK">RickK</a> 05:14, 27 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, that was an interesting addition to the original rules, which required players to advance the ball only by passing it. Someone decided to "pass it to himself", and this idea became modified to require that the ball hit the floor before one caught his own pass.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Team foul penalty situation</span></h2>
<p>Contributor 128.172.213.85 posted a change saying that the team foul limit, by NBA rule changes, is 5. I just want to verify a source for that - I did a quick <a href="http://www.google.co.nz/search?hl=en&amp;q=site%3Awww.nba.com+Rules+and+Regulations&amp;meta=" class="external text" title="http://www.google.co.nz/search?hl=en&amp;q=site%3Awww.nba.com+Rules+and+Regulations&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">search of the NBA website on Google</a> which returned no rule changes since 2002; and according to NBA's <a href="http://www.nba.com/analysis/rules_12.html?nav=ArticleList" class="external text" title="http://www.nba.com/analysis/rules_12.html?nav=ArticleList" rel="nofollow">rules and regulations section 12</a> the limit is still 4.</p>
<p>The team foul limit of 4 does mean that free throws don't occur till the fifth team foul. A team must <i>surpass</i> the limit in order to be penalized with the penalty situation, thus the 4th foul, which is the limit, incurs no extra penalty. Both FIBA and NBA rules account for this.</p>
<p>That's what I think. Correct me if I'm wrong. —<a href="../../../n/e/o/User%7ENeonumbers_9199.html" title="User:Neonumbers">Neonumbers</a> 10:32, 28 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Basketball Court</span></h2>
<p>The international basketball rule change in I think is was 2003 means that the broken semicircle inside the key is no longer there. The jump ball circles at either end are never used because it has been replaced by the alternating posession rule. The solid line semicircle is still there as it determines the zone where the free throw shooter is allowed (and maybe to maintain the traditional look of a court).</p>

<p>In <i>The Lone Ranger and Tonto Fistfight in Heaven</i>, Sherman Alexie hints that basketball may predate Naismith's "invention"--is there any evidence to support this or is he just taking poetic license?</p>
<ul>
<li>A long time ago, I read about an ancient game played by the Aztecs (or maybe the Mayas, I don't remember). The game involved a ball and a ring placed on a wall, but the ring was rotated 90 degrees, such that a ball would have to travel horizontally and parallel to the wall to go through the ring. Whether this could be considered a precursor to basketball is debatable. As I recall, the game was closer to soccer, as the ball had to be kicked through the ring. <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimishag_daa2.html" title="User:Simishag">Simishag</a> 01:17, 3 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">information in article</span></h2>
<p>I'm going to pull a minor deletionist stunt, despite being a mergist, and propose that information about official aspects of non-competitive or non-regulated games (or their lack of official-ness) need not be in an encyclopaedic article. I don't think the elaberation on some aspects of this article is necessary, it puts the relative section lengths out of proportion (with their importance). I'd even go as far to say that the equipment section should be way shorter and should be a subsection of regulations. Equipment commonly used but not regulated should go in common techniques in practice. The idea of having an entire section on just equipment seems a bit strange to me. <a href="../../../n/e/o/User%7ENeonumbers_9199.html" title="User:Neonumbers">Neonumbers</a> 8 July 2005 11:12 (UTC)</p>

<p>I don't think it's a good idea to emphasise rule differences at different levels too much. That just makes things confusing. Only FIBA and NBA rules are needed when necessary, everything lower can just be left out, except for some common practices. On that note, try not to go on about rules too much either. I think we need to look at common practice more...

<dd>Is there a page where we can place the rules of basketball? BTW – in <i>most</i> instances, the rules are similar between all levels. Most of the differences I noted in my earlier edits had to do with game length, roster size, etc. To get into all the rules differences ... well, you'd obviously need a forum that's different from Wikipedia.&#160;:-) [[<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBriguy52748_613a.html" title="User:Briguy52748">Briguy52748</a> 23:24, 9 July 2005 (UTC)]]</dd>

I think that the rules of basketball - and, for that matter, those of different organisations (I read a summary on that in FIBA Assist 14, it was 5 pages long!) - have a place in this encyclopedia, and well, that's the place.</dd>
<dd>I don't know if I mentioned anything about the section "equipment" and how I think it shouldn't be there, that should be in the rules page and a summary, without measurements, on this page.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Hole in the basket?</span></h2>
<p>Is it true or a myth that in the first games of basketball, a complete basket, without a hole at the bottom, was used? The story goes on to say that someone ended up breaking through the bottom of the basket. Once the players realized the significance of this change, they went ahead and punched a hole through the other one. This doesn't seem very likely to be true, but still funny. -- Myria 04:32, 20 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Well, I read that there was originally a ladder set up next to the basket to retrieve the ball. That got old really quick, so Naismith cut out a trapdoor in the bottom of the basket, which could be opened by pulling on a rope which hung below the basket. I have no idea when they started using nets, though. <a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMiraculouschaos_d696.html" title="User:Miraculouschaos">Miraculouschaos</a> 21:39, 5 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">the greatest intramural basketball team ever</span></h2>
<p>- Many have debated the value of intramural basketball only to arrive at the same answer every time. Intramural basketball is the only place where true basketball lives. The teams are better than that of any organized teams and the skills of the players are unsurpassed by anyone ever to hold a basketball. But the true debate doesn't end there. Who is the best intramural basketball team. Well, the votes have been taken. The tournament is over. The best intramural basketball team in the world is the Pandemic of Purple Panda Pandamonium. This all-star intramural team is based out of Hutchinson, MN. Led by many sexy and very talented players, the Quad P's, as the are reffered to as, absolutely destroy any team they face on the court. The Pandemic of Purple Panda Pandamonium will reign as the greatest intramural basketball team ever to walk the earth.</p>
