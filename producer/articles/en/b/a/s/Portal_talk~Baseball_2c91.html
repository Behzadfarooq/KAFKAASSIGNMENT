<p>I would like to start an important discussion on the stylistic nature of this portal. Any one reading the portal can certainly pick up on the approach used by the portal’s maintainer <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">User:Jahiegel</a>. And said approach, while certainly encyclopedic in the <a href="../../../b/r/i/Britannica.html" title="Britannica">Britannica</a> sense, is sometimes archaic in its wording. This I believe this contributes to a lack of readability; a quality championed in all <a href="../../../f/p/o/WP%7EFPO_dcbe.html" title="WP:FPO">featured portals</a> and <a href="../../../f/a/_/WP%7EFA_2cf5.html" title="WP:FA">featured articles</a> of Wikipedia.</p>
<p>While I acknowledge the current style’s encyclopedic merit, and I appreciate the work that jahiegel has contributed to this portal since late May/early June, I think a generally more readable structure to the page would take it to the next level.</p>
<p>Let me say that some elements of the portal should remain the way they are. For example the definition of baseball is perfectly acceptable the way it reads now. It defines what the sport is in “black and white” rulebook language.</p>
<p>However there are some parts of the portal that should remain less convoluted than they currently are, and have been. For example:</p>
<p><br />
<i>(Copied from the “Did you know…?” section, 8-14-06)</i> Did you know… “that, as ascribed to a Major League Baseball rivalry, Subway Series, a locution derived from New York City's use of a rapid transit subway, was first used to reference the rivalry between the New York Yankees and Brooklyn Dodgers, which teams, between 1941 and 1956, contested eight World Series, and the matchup of which teams is the most common in Series history?”</p>
<p><i>Did you know…</i>“...that, whilst seven Major League Baseball players—Christy Mathewson, Grover Cleveland Alexander, Sandy Koufax, Walter Johnson, Lefty Grove, Lefty Gómez, and Roger Clemens—have, by at least twice leading either the American or National League in earned run average, wins, and strikeouts in a single season, achieved multiple pitching Triple Crowns, only two Saint Louis Cardinals second baseman Rogers Hornsby, pictured, and Boston Red Sox left fielder Ted Williams—have, by twice leading one league in home runs, runs batted in, and batting average in a single season, achieved multiple batting Triple Crowns?”</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>While these are two brief examples, other parts of the portal (including the news section) are also unnecessarily complex at times in its syntax.</p>
<p>We need to ask ourselves, are we writing to the general <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public.html" title="Public">public</a> in a professional, yet clear style? Or, frankly, are we writing to <a href="../../../h/e/r/Herman_Melville_9326.html" title="Herman Melville">Herman Melville</a>?</p>
<p><br />
In order as this to be a general introduction to a conversation, I’ll simply bullet some of the general points I’d like to make.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<ul>
<li>Baseball in the English Wikipedia should generally default to <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_English_16a3.html" title="American English">American English</a> in its wording. As per the recommendations of <a href="../../../m/o/s/WP%7EMoS_1f61.html#National_varieties_of_English" title="WP:MoS">WP:MoS#National varieties of English</a>, I think this fits best for most English articles on baseball. The game as its known today grew up in the United States, and has its jargon steeped in American English. While the game is described in some corners of the world in <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_English_ebb4.html" title="British English">British English</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_English_79ce.html" title="Canadian English">Canadian English</a> or <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_English_375b.html" title="Australian English">Australian English</a>, the majority of articles you will find on baseball are in American English. This portal should adhere to same style.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Verbs should not necessarily be confined to the basic “rulebook terms”. Words like “slug”, “crush”, “snare”…etc. are not jocular but are part of the very fabric of baseball and the way it is described. These words do not lack encyclopedic merit, but are probably more appropriate in describing events that occur during the game. Yet, these terms are constantly removed from the portal to preserve some antiquated style the portal was overwhelmed with earlier this year. As all editors are aware of there are always exceptions to the rule.</li>
</ul>
<p>I certainly have assumed <a href="../../../g/o/o/WP%7Egood_faith_c568.html" title="WP:good faith">good faith</a> in the edits that have been made, and I do not assume that the maintainer is attempting to <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">own</a> the portal. Still, I am a bit dismayed that a small grammar error here or there, needs the entire submission to be entirely reworked, into said forced style.</p>
<p>I hope that this post can begin a discussion from several editors who are both involved an uninvolved with Baseball on Wikipedia. I also hope this will lead to an overall resolution to an issue where attempted compromise has not been successful.</p>

<dd>I'll address the issue—one that certainly merits a discussion—more generally in a bit, but it should be observed that <i>slug</i>, <i>snare</i>, and <i>crush</i> are, as used here, IMHO, emphatically unencyclopedic (toward which, see, e.g., <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_NoseNuggets_b1fe.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/NoseNuggets">Wikipedia:Requests for comment/NoseNuggets</a>). In any event, I'm quite glad that Wwthewx99 has so decorously begun this discussion, and I look forward to the community's discussing the issue (even as I fear that Wwthewx99 and I might be the only ones ever to come to this page). <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 20:29, 14 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>This certainly is topic that should be discussed, as in it may set some sort of example for other sport portals as well.

<dd>I didn't mean to suggest that Wxthewx99's edits shared the deficiencies of those of NoseNuggets about which the RfC was taken; they surely do not. I meant, though, to suggest that <i>connects for</i>, <i>slugs</i>, <i>crushes</i>, and <i>snares</i>, though frequently used with respect to baseball, are plainly unencyclopedic, consistent with the <i>Wikipedia is not "<a href="../../../s/p/o/SportsCenter_52cb.html" title="SportsCenter">SportsCenter</a>"</i> proposition toward which I understand the RfC to go.

<li>A portal serves principally to present quality articles in order that a prospective editor, having happened upon the portal, will conclude that Wikipedia doesn't suck and that he or she ought to join the project. Ancillarily, though, portals serve to present thematic articles on which editors might work, in view of which I often craft lengthy DYK entries, attempting to include copious links in order that an editor might, having followed one of the links, find an article that he might improve. I think the syntax employed in the DYKs adduced is exceedingly simple and altogether encyclopedic; I do, it should be observed, use <i>whilst</i> in place of <i>while</i>, and that ought to be redressed.</li>
<li>I do not seek to impose my (idiosyncratic) style on the portal, but I do, as ought any editor, try to <a href="../../../c/l/e/Wikipedia%7ECleanup_89e0.html" title="Wikipedia:Cleanup">cleanup</a> certain additions. I have not, to my recollection, edited any Wxthewx contribution exclusively in view of stylistic concerns, save for on those occasions when certain formulations were plainly unencyclopedic. When I do cleanup grammar and syntax, though, I might happen to rework text, but I think such reworking to be altogether reasonable. The MoS principle that Wxthewx adduces supra ought, I think, to extend to this issue; where an editor has made a substantive contribution that otherwise meets encyclopedic standards, another editor should not undertake to rework text solely because he prefers a different style. Here, though, each time I've revised the style of an entry, I've done so either in an effort to comport such entries with encyclopedic standards or only tangentially in an effort to remedy grammatical and syntatic problems. Where my work is replete with solecisms, I expect that other editors will undertake to improve my work, and I accept that they may make certain stylistic revisions—revisions that would not be justified were my initial work devoid of error—in pursuance of such improvement. In the Hafner edit, there were two minor errors—Hafner was inappropriately set off by commas and the <i>Hafner's...Hudson</i> phrase was inappropriately followed by a comma—and several other minor problems (<a href="../../../m/a/j/Major_League_Baseball_9421.html" title="Major League Baseball">Major League Baseball</a> to have been capitalized [here as a league rather than as a descriptor, in view of the global nature of the portal], for example), and concomitant to the cleaning up of such edits I may have made stylistic revisions, which I think to be understandable. I suppose I ought to set out clearly what principle I think ought to control: <i>Where user A prefers to write in style A and user B prefers to write in style B, where <b>style A and style B are equally appropriate for encyclopedic text</b>, and where user A makes a given substantive contribution first, user B ought not to edit that contribution <b>exclusively</b> to impose his style but understandably may make stylistic changes passim when he undertakes to address grammatical and syntactic problems.</i> Is that an idea with which most agree? <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 22:44, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>And whether the "SportsCenter style" (you've unfairly and unceremoniously tagged my writing fashion) is not encyclopedic is simply your opinion jahiegel. I don't believe the style I have introduced is similar to some Sports Talk drivel, nor do I believe it to be that far from an acceptable encyclopedic entry. Also, I've laid out my defense for a less verbose style, and that still has not been addressed.</dd>

<dd>I certainly didn't mean to suggest that Wxthewx's contributions are altogether of the <i>SportsCenter style</i>; it is, I think, quite fair to say that <i>snagged</i>, <i>crushed</i>, and <i>snared</i> are unencyclopedic and fair to ascribe the appellative <i>SportsCenter</i>ish to such locutions, and I can't imagine that anyone would quarrel with such ascription.</dd>

<dd>As to the <i>less verbose style</i>, I apologize for not having better addressed the issue; I think the "verbose" style I use to be neither better nor worse than the less verbose style for the use of which Wxthewx advocates, and I don't think it appropriate that either of us edit the other's contributions <i>solely</i> toward the imposition of another valid style. Once more, though, were I to make a contribution that employed terms that were plainly unencyclopedic (consider, for example, the <i>blockbuster</i> formulation of the Lee, et al.-Mench, et al., trade) or that were marked by grammatical or syntactic error, I'd think it appropriate that others edit my work and would understand if, in the course of such editing, those users made stylistic changes.</dd>

<dd>There is, to be sure, not one reversion or revision of Wxthewx99's work that I undertook that served only to change the style in which such work was written. I'm not certain that there's any better understanding to which we might come than that prose that is perfectly encyclopedic ought not to be rewritten solely for stylistic reasons. I make plenty of errors here, but I don't know that one can point to any plainly unencyclopedic or ungrammatical edits in the DYK or news items Wxthewx presents.</dd>

<dd>Perhaps we ought to put the issue succinctly (a first for me): Do the editors of this portal agree that neither of the two styles here discussed is superior to the other, such that there is no need for one to rework edits that are otherwise encyclopedic in tone and syntax? If so, I think we've no problem. <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 06:33, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Am I right in assuming this Portal's been abandoned. I'd like to revive it in time for Opening Day. I'm planning on looking through the other portals and seeing what choices they've made that we can steal, so if anyone's still watching this and is married to some content or design element here let me know. Or just leave a note if you're interested in helping me revive this. I prefer to decide things by consensus, but I'll go ahead and start making unilateral decisions if no-one else shows an interest. --<a href="../../../d/j/r/User%7EDjrobgordon_ce64.html" title="User:Djrobgordon">Djrobgordon</a> 01:04, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I took a look at the portal and at your sandbox. Dropping the background color was a good move -- much easier to read.

<p>A couple of notes, for anyone who's paying attention to this portal: 1) The archives are not permanently gone. They're necessary for a portal to be featured, as I hope this will be at some point. Right now I'm looking at how some featured portals have formatted their archives in order to figure out how best to do the ones here.</p>
<p>2) I'm experimenting with queuing future content using <a href="../../../v/a/r/Help%7EVariables_1ccd.html" title="Help:Variables">variables</a>. It should cut down on the need for regular maintenance, and in particular will enable us to update "Did you know..." daily. With the obvious exception of News, I think all of the content sections could benefit from this.</p>
<p>The downside is that the method requires a bit more know how on the part of editors. One solution could be to provide links to the queued article on a nomination page (also in the works), as <a href="../../../a/r/c/Portal%7EArchitecture_4dc7.html" title="Portal:Architecture">Portal:Architecture</a> has done <a href="../../../a/r/c/Portal%7EArchitecture_Selected_article_candidates_cf3a.html" title="Portal:Architecture/Selected article candidates">here</a>. That way any editor will be able to find future articles, without figuring out our naming scheme.</p>
<p>I'll leave more notes as I think of them. Any questions, here's the place. --<a href="../../../d/j/r/User%7EDjrobgordon_ce64.html" title="User:Djrobgordon">Djrobgordon</a> 01:36, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>If you're interested in how I'm setting up the archives, check out <a href="../../../b/a/s/Portal%7EBaseball_Did_you_know_Archive_05c6.html" title="Portal:Baseball/Did you know/Archive">Portal:Baseball/Did you know/Archive</a>. This one will be the most complicated, since it's the only section that automatically updates daily.

<p>Hello, I have a few comments.</p>
<ul>
<li><s>I would recommend rotating content for the Article, Picture, and Biography sections.</s>
<ul>
<li>Portal is currently set up for all material to be rotated out weekly.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Your current article as well as some of the archived ones have been rated start class, I would recommend only displaying Wikipedia's best work, preferably FA-Class or GA-Class.</li>
<li><s>The bold article name in each section should be a link to the article you could still use the more option at the end.</s>
<ul>
<li>Linked all article subjects.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><s>Your selected pictures need an image credit.</s>
<ul>
<li>Added credits to current and future selected picture.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A few of your topics are categories and should be moved to that section.</li>
<li><s>In your quotes section I see no reason for there to be an external link for each quote this would lead people away from Wikipedia.</s>
<ul>
<li>Links removed, as per explanation below.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><s>Some of the links to your Associated Wikimedia lead to create pages on the sister projects the should either be correctly linked or removed.</s>
<ul>
<li>Redirected dead links.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These are just a few off the top of my head. Cheers — <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilsbadkarma_6706.html" title="User:Wilsbadkarma"><font color="#25185D"><b>Wils</b></font><font color="#BC8D00"><b>Bad</b></font><font color="#25185D"><b>Karma</b></font></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../w/i/l/User_talk%7EWilsbadkarma_5e83.html" title="User talk:Wilsbadkarma"><font color="#BB8900"><b>Talk</b></font></a>)</sup> 03:08, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Thanks for the quick response. If you don't mind, I have a couple of question about your suggestions:</p>
<ul>
<li>As of now, there are only fourteen articles under <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Baseball_14a2.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Baseball">WikiProject Baseball</a> listed as good or featured articles. In addition, one is a list and two are only tangentially related to the sport. On the nomination pages for selected bios, I have the lowest acceptable class as B. Is this acceptable, when there is a lack of peer-reviewed articles, or would it be better to rotate the few top-quality articles in more frequently?</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>That is a matter of debate. Personally I believe that all Portals should have FA or GA class articles for the selected article, however you will find some reviewers that don't have a problem with a B-class article. The problem that you will run into is; when you put the portal up for featured you will need support from all kinds. So I would recommend rotating the better articles and working to get more featured or GA class articles.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>The reason for the external links in the "Quotes" section is that there are very few baseball quotes on Wikipedia or Wikiquote, so I had to get them from outside. Is it necessary for me to source the quotes, or is it okay to let them stand? I could add the sourced quotes to the applicable articles, but I don't really have the time to integrate them properly, and creating a "Quotes" section for one quote seems tacky. Perhaps I should add them, with refs, to WikiQuote?</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>There aren't really any portals that cite quote references, having a link to the quotes author is adequate. Not to mention that having an external link in the quote section could draw people away from wikipedia and since a portals purpose is to be a "portal" to certain parts of Wikipedia then having those links defeat the purpose.Cheers — <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilsbadkarma_6706.html" title="User:Wilsbadkarma"><font color="#25185D"><b>Wils</b></font><font color="#BC8D00"><b>Bad</b></font><font color="#25185D"><b>Karma</b></font></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../w/i/l/User_talk%7EWilsbadkarma_5e83.html" title="User talk:Wilsbadkarma"><font color="#BB8900"><b>Talk</b></font></a>)</sup> 16:25, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
