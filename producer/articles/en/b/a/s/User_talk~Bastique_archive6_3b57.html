<p>Hello, Bastique. Congratulations for becoming administrator in last month. I wanted to apologize you for telling <i>Conguratulation</i> lately. Sorry for that. I'm just interested that you visited <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Francisco_a4a4.html" title="San Francisco">San Francisco</a>. There is Golden Gates in <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Francisco_a4a4.html" title="San Francisco">San Francisco</a>. I have never heard that Someone visits <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Francisco_a4a4.html" title="San Francisco">San Francisco</a> for Wiki Break. So, Where did you visit during WikiBreak in <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Francisco_a4a4.html" title="San Francisco">San Francisco</a>? When I was about 7 or 8 years old I visited <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Francisco_a4a4.html" title="San Francisco">San Francisco</a> after I visited <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles_983d.html" title="Los Angeles">Los Angeles</a>. It was great place as much as <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europe.html" title="Europe">Europe</a>. Did you visit the <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Jose_c7dc.html" title="San Jose">San Jose</a>, when you traveled in <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Francisco_a4a4.html" title="San Francisco">San Francisco</a>. Ahh, I also visited <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Francisco_a4a4.html" title="San Francisco">San Francisco</a> from school for Trip by Science Class. Anyways, I hope you could reply on my talk page.</p>

Even if the IP wasn't blocked for being a proxy (which his malformed attempts and impersonating a system administrator have yet to convince me was not the case) it would have been blocked for abusive use by a sockpuppeteer. I'd greatly appreciate being consulted, either on my talk page, or via email, before unblocking; I don't randomly block IPs without cause, and I tend to know a lot more about what a given IP is doing than the average user. <span style="font-family: Verdana"><a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE"><b>Essjay</b></font></a> <font color="#7B68EE">(<small><a href="../../../e/s/s/User_talk%7EEssjay_a39e.html" title="User talk:Essjay"><font color="#7B68EE">Talk</font></a> • <font color="#7B68EE">Connect</font></small>)</font></span> 04:38, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If the information was "MONGO works in office 111A at 2222 33rd street and his real name is Dexter" I'd agree with you, as such information could put you at risk. "MONGO works for the government" does not meet that threshhold. Bastique is not trying to discredit or personally attack MONGO.

<dd>Bastique comes along and reposts info that I removed, as it was, I repeat, an attempt to discredit or personally attack me. The stuff I removed has zero to do with the article, and had no business being there anyway...did you bother to read it...explain to me how it is isn't insulting. I never said I was at risk or my safety was threatened. And as far as "yet-unanswered questions about the motive of MONGO's edits"...what does that mean? The articles related to 9/11 are just one area I work on at wiki...a quick look at my userpage claerly demostrates that it isn't even my primary focus...land management is.--<a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMONGO_8e88.html" title="User:MONGO">MONGO</a> 18:03, 25 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Actually, it's a matter of whether or not MONGO can act objectively in the blocking of individuals whom you feel have insulted you. Frankly, although the dialogue between the two seems childish at best, it hardly seems an attack. I did repost the information, as Tom says below, to maintain integrity of the talk page. However, it is entirely credible to assume that one would quickly be able to remember your government connection if one had read it in an article on 9/11. That's the sad truth of the matter—you said it, and no matter what the reason, it will always be out there. It's the nature of things on Wikipedia. Furthermore, it's also easy to reconcile someone being apt to use it on an article that specifically involves your department of the government. You can't use your employment status as credibility in one article and not be prepared to lose that credibility, by reasons of who you work for, in another article.</dd>
<dd>And, God, that's not even the issue. You should NOT be blocking users because you feel they insulted YOU. <a href="../../../b/a/s/User%7EBastique_e135.html" title="User:Bastique"><b>B</b>astique</a><span class="Unicode" style="color:#FF72E3;">▼</span><b><sup><a href="../../../b/a/s/User_talk%7EBastique_d47c.html" title="User talk:Bastique">parler</a></sup></b> <sub><b><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bastique_7452.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bastique">voir</a></b></sub> 18:24, 25 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>They didn't insult me...they are misusing information to try and discredit me.

<dd>I assume Bastique is acting in good faith to preserve the integrity of the talk page, but the result it to restore a deliberate attack that's using personnal information to discredit Mongo. The material Bastique re-added uses fairly broad innuendo to do it. I remember a similar comment a few months ago about a promiment administrator that was even less direct, that was promptly and correctly nuked off the RfA page with near unanimous support. I think the principle of removing these things and blocking if neccessary is well-established and supported by precedent. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETom_harrison_ffb8.html" title="User:Tom harrison">Tom Harrison</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/o/m/User_talk%7ETom_harrison_de49.html" title="User talk:Tom harrison">Talk</a></sup> 18:00, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I saw you were involved with SVGs on Wikimedia, so I hope you can answer my question. I'm thinking of converting CIA maps to SVG to make all country maps in SVG format. It would be really useful if these maps could be used as more than just images. Two things I had in mind, which should be easy to implement, are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Allow substituting words (placenames), thus making the same maps usable in many languages.</li>
<li>Allow words or shapes to link to wikipedia articles.</li>
</ul>
<p>From what I understand, right now wikimedia transforms SVG images into PNG when they are embedded using the [[Image:...]] format, and they do not support links. While I understand that supporting links could be a problem, the first item I suggest should be fairly simple to implement. I was thinking about something like [[Image:some_map.svg|subs Spain-&gt;España|subs Italy-&gt;Italia|subs France-&gt;Francia|...]], causing the map to be displayed with the Spanish names instead of the original (English) names. This can be implemented by substituting the relevant strings in the SVG file before rendering. This could be extended in the future to something like ...| subs Italy-&gt;[[Italy]] | subs Georgia-&gt;[[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]|... to allow links for placenames at least, if this becomes possible. Do you happen to know who handles the issues of SVG support? Can I help somehow? Thanks,--<a href="../../../e/n/t/User%7EEnthus_35e1.html" title="User:Enthus">Enthus</a> 08:48, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I happen to believe that English should be used when working in the English wikipedia. It's this thing I have. English names in English. Silly, I know. Many cities and towns across the world have other names in their native tongues. I don't think, for instance, you'll find <a href="../../../r/o/m/Rome.html" title="Rome">Rome</a> as the official name of the capital of Italy, but we still happen to keep our article under that name. Because it's the English name.</dd>

<dd>You may wish to visit <a href="../../../i/m/o/WP%7EIMOS_0e4c.html" title="WP:IMOS">WP:IMOS</a> to understand why we don't use the official names of Gaeltacht cities on the English wikipedia.</dd>

<dd>You'll be pleased to know that I'm all for the use of Irish names in Irish, however. I personally, despite not knowing Irish, have contributed myself a great deal.

<p>Hi B please read my contribution to the discussion on the use of Irish names for Gaeltacht areas, as opposed to the anglicised versions. While I can see where you are coming from I feel you are a little behind the times in regard to this issue. The enactment of the languages act has already lead to the removal of all signposts using the anglicised versions of the names. This should surely be a key factor in name usage, although I would suggest we continue to put these out-of-date name references in italics in brackets accompanied by a reference to the act itself etc.) <a href="../../../t/a/i/User%7ETaibhdhearc_5237.html" title="User:Taibhdhearc">Taibhdhearc</a> 15:13, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You're missing the point. The official name of <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a> is just that, but you don't see any of use nipping over to <a href="../../../../fr/l/o/n/Londres.html" class="extiw" title="fr:Londres">fr:Londres</a> and attempting to move it, do you? On this wikipedia, we use the English names for things, just as on <a href="../../../../fr/index.html" class="extiw" title="fr:">frwiki</a> they use French names.

<p>This does however raise an interesting question (though I don't really have an opinion either way)...English is an official language of Ireland (along with Gaelic). It is also by far the predominant language used in Ireland. If Ireland renames a city within its borders, isn't that new name then, even if Gaelic in origin, also the correct English name of that place? I mean, (although i know this is not completely analogious) our page for <a href="../../../b/o/c/Boca_Raton%2C_Florida_6a7d.html" title="Boca Raton, Florida">Boca Raton, Florida</a> is not called Mouth of the Rat, Flower, is it? In short, if an English speaking country adopts a non-English place name, doesn't it make sense to use the non-English name? Just a thought. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptaintruth_4f96.html" title="User:Captaintruth">Captaintruth</a> 20:59, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I tend to agree with you. I just thought it was an interesting point worth raising. BTW, did you ever get a chance to have a look at the FAU controversy I pointed out to you? It seems to have resolved itself anyway. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptaintruth_4f96.html" title="User:Captaintruth">Captaintruth</a> 22:08, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This was exactly the point I was raising when I said: "I'm afraid that isn't a point that I missed. If we in Ireland decide to call a town 'Z' and then proceed to use this name on all our signposts and goverment publications surely it makes perfect sense to adapt to this situation. In fact the word 'rosmuck', for example, is not an English word per se. A name is a tag to aid someone in recognising a location, particularly important if you are trying to find a place. I wouldn't recommend an article on Kingstown, Queenstown or Marysborough although a reference to the use of these names for an historic period might aid someone beginning to research history on a given area.

<dd>Personally, I was opposed to the eviction of userboxes from template space <i>altogether</i>. However, that's not how things have played out.

<dd>Bastique, if Khoikhoi wants to display the former names of the cities, he should do it in the history section. When he places it in the introduction section, it makes a messy look. In addition, he displays the modern day Greek name in the introduction section which would not be appropriate. Because, if we display all of the foreign names (French, Italian, Korean, etc.), can you imagine how the introduction will look like&#160;:D So, in case of displaying foreign names of the cities, it would be more appropriate to create new pages. And, put the link to it in the 'See also' section. Thanks.&#160;;-) --Zeytin 03:31, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>No offense, but just because you don't consider yourself to be irrational doesn't mean that all of your beliefs are not irrational. There are plenty of highly "intelligent" people who are irrational when it comes to their own personal beliefs. Rationality in terms of claims of observability is demarcated by science not by the beliefs of the intelligent. --<a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7EScienceApologist_b6a9.html" title="User:ScienceApologist">ScienceApologist</a> 19:02, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

Not only is it incivil, but it will probably just incite the person to vandalize more. I've seen it time and time again that insulting them just feeds the trolling.

<p>Bastique, regarding your unblock of Netscott, can I ask you please not to take administrative action regarding content disputes you're involved in? If it were all right for you to unblock Netscott, then it would have been all right for Jayjg to block him in the first place, rather than report the violation on AN/3RR. When we're in a content dispute, we're there as editors only. I know that can be frustrating, but it's best to try to stick to it. Also, we're not supposed to undo blocks without first thoroughly discussing the issue with the blocking admin, so your unblock violated <a href="../../../b/l/o/WP%7EBLOCK_89b0.html" title="WP:BLOCK">WP:BLOCK</a> in that regard too. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 17:59, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Thanks for your note. It's not a question of not being able to be objective. If that were the only problem, involved admins would be allowed to block for 3RR, because a 3RR violation requires very little subjective evaluation and often none at all. Therefore, Jayjg could have gone ahead and performed the block himself rather than reporting it. You did the equivalent of that by unblocking when involved. In future, if you believe a block is too harsh, raise it with the blocking admin, and if you can't persuade him to alter it, post on AN/I. That pertains even if you have no involvement in the content dispute, by the way, but even more so (in fact, absolutely so) if you do.

<dd>Also, I think you ought to take seriously that the regular editors on a page may know more about the issue that someone who has just arrived at it and has no specialist knowledge. That doesn't mean the regular editors must be deferred to (this is a wiki, after all), but it makes sense to give them the benefit of the doubt, especially when you see that they're experienced editors. What was happening on that page was an attempt to disrupt it, pure and simple, and it's important that admins don't inadvertently lend their weight to such efforts. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 18:50, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
