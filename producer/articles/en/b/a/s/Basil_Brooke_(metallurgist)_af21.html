	    <p><b>Sir Basil Brooke</b> (1576-1646), metallurgist and recusant, inherited the manor of <a href="../../../m/a/d/Madeley%2C_Shropshire_fc96.html" title="Madeley, Shropshire">Madeley</a> from his father. This contained iron and steel works and coal mines. The coal mines had been worked in his father's time, coal being transported on the river Severn to cities and towns from <a href="../../../s/h/r/Shrewsbury.html" title="Shrewsbury">Shrewsbury</a> to <a href="../../../g/l/o/Gloucester.html" title="Gloucester">Gloucester</a>.</p>
<p>About 1615, he obtained an interest in a patent for making steel by the <a href="../../../c/e/m/Cementation_process.html" title="Cementation process">cementation process</a>. This led to his building steel furnaces at <a href="../../../c/o/a/Coalbrookdale.html" title="Coalbrookdale">Coalbrookdale</a>, which certainly existed by the 1640s, and perhaps from 1615. The patent contained a clause prohibiting the import of steel, but he was unable to meet demand and was required to surrender his patent, but he evidently continued making steel, probably using iron from the Forest of Dean, though this was subsequently found not to be quite the best raw material.</p>
<p>In 1615, he and Richard Chaldecott of London took over two <a href="../../../b/l/a/Blast_furnace.html" title="Blast furnace">furnaces</a> and a <a href="../../../f/i/n/Finery_forge.html" title="Finery forge">forge</a> of the king's ironworks in the <a href="../../../f/o/r/Forest_of_Dean_5f1b.html" title="Forest of Dean">Forest of Dean</a>, but in 1618, they were accused of illegal felling and their lease was suspended. The same accusation was made against the next farmers, but their lease was allowed to run its course. Brooke (with George Mynne and Thomas Hackett) leased all the king's works (four furnaces and three forges, but in 1633, new claims were made that the ironworks were having a disastrous effect on the Forest. By that stage they had build one or two more forges adjoining the Forest. Their lease was suspended, and at the following enquiry at the Forest Eyre, he and his partner were fined heavily, being deprived of their lease, and the works were let to others. The fine was subsequently abated somewhat. Every farmer of these works was accused of misfeasance; it is not clear that Brooke and his partners did anything wrong, or anything worse than any other farmer.</p>
<p>Sir Basil probably had ironworks at <a href="../../../c/o/a/Coalbrookdale.html" title="Coalbrookdale">Coalbrookdale</a> on his own estate of <a href="../../../m/a/d/Madeley%2C_Shropshire_fc96.html" title="Madeley, Shropshire">Madeley</a>. There was a 'smithy', that is a <a href="../../../b/l/o/Bloomery.html" title="Bloomery">bloomery</a> forge there when Wenlock Abbey was dissolved, but how long this continued in use remains unknown. However it is likely that there were (at least) forges there in his time. He certainly had ironworks somewhere in Shropshire in 1622, including Bromleys Forge near the mouth of the <a href="../../../r/i/v/River_Perry%2C_Shropshire_da76.html" title="River Perry, Shropshire">River Perry</a>. He and his ironworks partners were also concerned in Shelsley Forge (in <a href="../../../s/h/e/Shelsley_Walsh_91d5.html" title="Shelsley Walsh">Shelsley Walsh</a>).</p>
<p>Brooke, Mynne, and Hackett were also farmers of the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Company_of_Mineral_and_Battery_Works_76b4.html" title="Company of Mineral and Battery Works">Company of Mineral and Battery Works</a> wireworks at <a href="../../../t/i/n/Tintern.html" title="Tintern">Tintern</a> from (or by) 1627, Hackett having been farmer since 1613. Brooke remained a farmer until his <a href="../../../s/e/q/Sequestration.html" title="Sequestration">sequestration</a> during the <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_Civil_War_6bfe.html" title="English Civil War">Civil War</a>.</p>
<p>Brooke was also one of the leading English Roman Catholics of his time, and was said to have personal contact with James I and Charles I. In 1635, he supported the <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Catholic_3b40.html" title="Roman Catholic">Catholic</a> clergy against <a href="../../../c/h/u/Church_of_England_2cc6.html" title="Church of England">Anglican</a> episcopal oversight. He was treasurer for contributions collected from English Catholics towards the cost of the <a href="../../../b/i/s/Bishops_Wars_ba8e.html" title="Bishops Wars">Bishops Wars</a> of 1639-40. In 1641, he was summoned by the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_House_of_Commons_bbac.html" title="British House of Commons">House of Commons</a>, but fled and was arrested at York and imprisoned in London. Late in 1643, he was implicated in a plot to divide <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parliament.html" title="Parliament">Parliament</a> and the City of <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a> authorities with a view to preventing the Scottish army taking part on the <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_Civil_War_6bfe.html" title="English Civil War">English Civil War</a>. His correspondence was discovered and on <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_6.html" title="January 6">6 January</a> <a href="../../../1/6/4/1644.html" title="1644">1644</a>, he was imprisoned again. His estate was sequestrated in 1645 as a papist delinquent. He died on <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_31.html" title="December 31">31 December</a> <a href="../../../1/6/4/1646.html" title="1646">1646</a>, leaving debts of £10,000 and an estate worth £300 p.a. His wife was Etheldreda Brudenell, daughter of Sir Edmund Brudenell. His son Thomas later recovered his estate, which passed down the family for several generations.</p>
