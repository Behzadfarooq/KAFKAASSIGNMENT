<p>The BBWAA was again authorized to elect players active in 1986 or later, but not after 2000; the ballot, announced on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_28.html" title="November 28">November 28</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005_in_baseball.html" title="2005 in baseball">2005</a>, included candidates from the 2005 ballot who received at least 5% of the vote but were not elected, along with selected players, chosen by a screening committee, whose last appearance was in 2000. All 10-year members of the BBWAA were eligible to vote.</p>
<p>Voters were instructed to cast votes for up to 10 candidates; any candidate receiving votes on at least 75% of the ballots would be honored with induction to the Hall. Results of the 2006 election by the BBWAA were announced on <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_10.html" title="January 10">January 10</a>. The ballot consisted of 29 players; 520 ballots were cast, with 390 votes required for election. A total of 2933 individual votes were cast, an average of 5.64 per ballot. Those candidates receiving less than 5% of the vote will not appear on future BBWAA ballots, but may eventually be considered by the Veterans Committee.</p>
<p><a href="../../../p/e/t/Pete_Rose_8e17.html" title="Pete Rose">Pete Rose</a>, who last played in 1986, was again not included on the ballot due to his banishment from baseball in what was theoretically his final opportunity, as players retired over 20 years can not be considered by the BBWAA under current rules; however, Hall of Fame chair Jane Forbes Clark indicated prior to the ballot announcement that if Rose is ever reinstated by Major League Baseball, the Hall's board of directors might review the rules in light of the fact that Rose never had an opportunity to appear on a BBWAA ballot.</p>
<p>Candidates who were eligible for the first time are indicated here with a â€ . The candidate who received at least 75% of the vote and was elected is indicated in <i><b>bold italics</b></i>. The 13 candidates who received less than 5% of the vote, thus becoming ineligible for future BBWAA consideration, are indicated with a *.</p>

<p>In July 2000, the Hall was given a $250,000 grant from <a href="../../../m/a/j/Major_League_Baseball_9421.html" title="Major League Baseball">Major League Baseball</a> to begin a comprehensive study on <a href="../../../a/f/r/African_American_5c73.html" title="African American">African Americans</a> in baseball from 1860-1960, with the hope of enhancing the Hall's collections in these areas. In February 2001, the Hall selected three historians â€“ Dr. Larry Hogan, Dick Clark and Larry Lester â€“ to conduct the study, which involved over 50 other researchers and authors. The resulting study was a narrative, bibliography, and statistical database, including 3,000 day-by-day records, league leaders and all-time leaders, collected from <a href="../../../b/o/x/Box_score_%28baseball%29.html" title="Box score (baseball)">box scores</a> in 128 newspapers of sanctioned <a href="../../../n/e/g/Negro_league_baseball.html" title="Negro league baseball">Negro League</a> games played from 1920-1954. The box scores reflect almost 100% of games of the 1920s, over 90% of the games played in the 1930s, and 50-70% of games in the 1940s and '50s. In February 2006, <i><a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Geographic_Society_03a9.html" title="National Geographic Society">National Geographic</a></i> published a book featuring material from the study, in conjunction with the Hall, called <i>Shades of Glory</i>; it covers not only the development of the game, but also its impact within the African American community. <i>Pride and Passion</i>, an exhibit focusing on the history of African American baseball, will debut at the Hall's museum in April 2006.</p>

<p>In July 2005, the Hall's Board of Directors appointed a screening committee to construct a ballot, and a larger voting committee to cast ballots in February. Former Commissioner of Baseball <a href="../../../f/a/y/Fay_Vincent_3ed2.html" title="Fay Vincent">Fay Vincent</a> served as the non-voting chairman of both committees, and Hall of Famer <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frank_Robinson_d405.html" title="Frank Robinson">Frank Robinson</a> served as an advisor and assistant to Vincent and the committees. Written recommendations from fans and non-committee members were accepted through October 2005. Using statistics and other historical material from the Hall's earlier study, the 5-member screening committee met in November at Dodgertown in <a href="../../../v/e/r/Vero_Beach%2C_Florida_2fdb.html" title="Vero Beach, Florida">Vero Beach, Florida</a> to create two ballots â€“ one for Negro League players, managers, umpires and executives, and another for candidates whose careers preceded the Negro Leagues. The screening committee members, with their areas of expertise, were: Adrian Burgos (Latin America), Dick Clark (Negro leagues), Larry Hogan (overall history), Larry Lester (Negro leagues) and Jim Overmyer (eastern teams and 19th century).</p>
<p>Of the many candidates who were recommended, the 94 who were considered by the screening committee were: <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newt_Allen_f172.html" title="Newt Allen">Newt Allen</a> - Walter Ball - Sam Bankhead - Bernardo Baro - <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Beckwith_%28baseball_player%29_b961.html" title="John Beckwith (baseball player)">John Beckwith</a> - <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Bell_%28baseball_player%29_565a.html" title="William Bell (baseball player)">William Bell</a> - Ed Bolden - <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chet_Brewer_2fe8.html" title="Chet Brewer">Chet Brewer</a> - Chester Brooks - Dave Brown - Larry Brown - <a href="../../../r/a/y/Ray_Brown_%28baseball_player%29_4d25.html" title="Ray Brown (baseball player)">Ray Brown</a> - <a href="../../../w/i/l/Willard_Brown_ed7e.html" title="Willard Brown">Willard Brown</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Byrd_8192.html" title="Bill Byrd">Bill Byrd</a> - Rev Cannady - Bill Cash - Phil Cockrell - Pancho Coimbre - <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andy_Cooper_0c56.html" title="Andy Cooper">Andy Cooper</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/n/Bingo_DeMoss_985e.html" title="Bingo DeMoss">Bingo DeMoss</a> - <a href="../../../r/a/p/Rap_Dixon_b97f.html" title="Rap Dixon">Rap Dixon</a> - <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Donaldson_8aa0.html" title="John Donaldson">John Donaldson</a> - Frank Duncan - JosÃ© Fernandez - <a href="../../../b/u/d/Bud_Fowler_781b.html" title="Bud Fowler">Bud Fowler</a> - Jelly Gardner - Charlie Grant - <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frank_Grant_36ec.html" title="Frank Grant">Frank Grant</a> - <a href="../../../g/u/s/Gus_Greenlee_b980.html" title="Gus Greenlee">Gus Greenlee</a> - Vic Harris - <a href="../../../p/e/t/Pete_Hill_7fc9.html" title="Pete Hill">Pete Hill</a> - Bill Holland - <a href="../../../s/a/m/Sammy_T._Hughes_16e3.html" title="Sammy T.

<p>After the screening committee completed its work, Hall president Dale Petroskey stated, "The screening committee did a great job of handling the first step of narrowing the list of candidates to those who should be seriously considered for election to the Hall of Fame."</p>
<p>Vincent added, "I'm very satisfied with the work done by the screening committee. The committee members had some difficult choices to make, but because they are extremely knowledgeable, had strong research at their disposal and spent a great deal of time reviewing all candidates thoroughly, they did a tremendous job. The final ballots represent players, managers, executives and builders who are top-tier candidates and worthy of review for consideration for election to the Hall of Fame."</p>
