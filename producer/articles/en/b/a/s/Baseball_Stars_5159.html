<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/s/Baseball_Stars_5159.html" title="Edit section: Features">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Features</span></h2>
<p><i>Baseball Stars</i> was one of the first <a href="../../../s/p/o/Sports_game.html" title="Sports game">sports games</a> to have data memory, therefore players could create a team, configure baseball league &amp; play a season, and throughout the CPU stored cumulative statistics. <i>Baseball Stars</i> was also the first sports game for the NES to have a <i>create a player</i> feature; giving gamers the power to name their players, as well as their teams. The game also introduced a <a href="../../../c/o/m/Computer_role-playing_game.html" title="Computer role-playing game">role playing</a> element; as each game played earns the winning team money, and the amount won is directly related to the sum of the <i>prestige</i> ratings of the players from both teams (as prestige determines how many paying fans attend the game). The money can be used to purchase upgrades to the various abilities of players currently on the roster, or it can be used to purchase pre-designed players (available in the <i>Rookie</i>, <i>Veteran</i>, and <i>All-Star</i> categories). A hidden feature allows players to purchase <i>female</i> baseball players (also a first).</p>
<p><a name="Gameplay" id="Gameplay"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/s/Baseball_Stars_5159.html" title="Edit section: Gameplay">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Gameplay</span></h2>
<p>Simple graphics are coupled with repetitive upbeat 8-bit music. The pitching is simple: curve balls, fast balls, off speed pitches, and sinkers. The batting is a swing on a level plane, thus it is simply a question of timing. The fielding, at the time, was a revolution in arcade baseball; it achieved a level of realism unseen prior to its release. This realism, coupled with ease-of-fielding features contributed to the game's popularity. These ease-of-fielding features are characterized by examples such as: off-screen fielders automatically drifting towards fly balls, fielders catching balls anywhere near them, the ability to jump and dive, infielders shifting to prevent extra base hits down the line when men are on base, etc.</p>
<p>The game has a 10-run <a href="../../../m/e/r/Mercy_rule.html" title="Mercy rule">mercy rule</a>. Thus, if at the end of any inning, one team is up by a total of 10 runs, the game is called in favor of the leading team. In addition to the 10-run mercy rule, there is also a 100-run mercy rule. If at any point in the game one team attains a lead of 100 or more, play is immediately stopped and a winner is declared, even though the inning is not over. For example, if the visiting team scores 100 runs in the top of the first inning, the visiting team will be declared the winner and the home team will not even have the chance to bat. If the game remains tied after 18 innings, the game is over and no winner is declared; all hits and other stats are not saved - as if the game never happened.</p>

<p><i>Baseball Stars</i> includes a simple one-off versus mode, but more interestingly it provides the option of creating a mini-league of up to six teams, with each team playing up to 25 games against every other team. That means a season with a maximum 125 game schedule can be created. When making a season, one chooses how many teams, how many games, and which teams are controlled by the AI (computer) and which are controlled by the gamers. In vs. mode no stats, such as wins, losses, hits, or home runs are kept but money can still be won when a <i>player</i> controlled team plays against an <i>AI</i> controlled team. No money is won in this mode when it is player vs. player. Versus mode games can be considered exhibition games.</p>
<p><a name="Teams" id="Teams"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/s/Baseball_Stars_5159.html" title="Edit section: Teams">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Teams</span></h3>
<p>There can be a total of 14 teams. Eight teams come with the game and six more teams can be created. The original eight cannot in any way be edited or changed.</p>
<p>Although the game does not use any real <a href="../../../m/a/j/Major_League_Baseball_9421.html" title="Major League Baseball">Major League Baseball</a> teams, one of the default teams, the American Dreams, included players with names that are based on real (former) baseball players such as Pete (<a href="../../../p/e/t/Pete_Rose_8e17.html" title="Pete Rose">Pete Rose</a>), Hank (<a href="../../../h/a/n/Hank_Aaron_0d82.html" title="Hank Aaron">Hank Aaron</a>), and Babe (<a href="../../../b/a/b/Babe_Ruth_8c7f.html" title="Babe Ruth">Babe Ruth</a>).</p>
<p>The other seven default teams are the Ninja BlackSox, Brave Warriors, Japan Robins, World Powers, Ghastly Monsters, Lovely Ladies (an all-women's team), and SNK Crushers.</p>
<p>When creating a new team, one is given the option of choosing its main strength (for example: defense, running, batting, balanced, etc). This does not mean that a chosen strength will remain with the team forever. The option simply favors the chosen attribute when the computer randomly generates the players. Each new teams gets about $30,000 to start and 18 players (5 pitchers, 8 batters, and 5 pinch hitters). From there, games are played and games that are won earn money for the team. Players on created teams can be modified and improved as well as traded amongst other created teams. It must be noted, though, that a pitcher cannot be traded for a batter; it must always be batter for batter or pitcher for pitcher. There is also a <i><a href="../../../f/r/e/Free_agent.html" title="Free agent">free agent</a></i> market in which players can be bought ranging in price from $5,000 to $2,980,000. Since there is a limit of 18 players per team, before a free agent can be bought, a player must be fired.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/s/Baseball_Stars_5159.html" title="Edit section: Statistics">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Statistics</span></h3>
<p>In season play, the game conveniently keeps track of various stats. By going into the SEE STANDINGS menu, it can be seen how each team fairs compared to each other team, each teams' win/loss records, top ten batting averages, top ten <a href="../../../h/o/m/Home_run.html" title="Home run">home run</a> batters, top ten <a href="../../../r/u/n/Run_batted_in.html" title="Run batted in">RBI</a> hitters, top ten <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earned_run_average.html" title="Earned run average">ERA</a> pitchers, top ten winning pitchers, and top ten save leaders.</p>
<p>Each individual player's batting average and home run totals can be seen when that player is up to bat and individual pitcher's ERA is shown when that pitcher is pitching. With the exception of a pitcher's ERA, stats are current when a player steps into the batter's box.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/s/Baseball_Stars_5159.html" title="Edit section: Player improvements">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Player improvements</span></h2>
<p>As stated above, when money is won, it can be applied to upgrade a player. For batters, there are six abilities that can be augmented. For pitchers, there are eleven. Each ability can be assigned up to 15 points. Each player has a maximum number of points allowed and the higher the "max" of the player, the more valuable he could become.</p>

</div>
<ul>
<li><b>Hitting</b> (batting average): This ability is directly linked to the "length" of the player's bat. The longer the bat the greater the chance of making contact with the ball, therefore the greater the potential batting average. An actual change in the appearance of the bat is not seen when points are added to this category, but it is noticed that balls no longer go <i>through</i> the bat.</li>
<li><b>Batting</b> (home runs): More points put to this ability will increase the player's chances of hitting a home run as this ability puts power directly into the bat. The ball is hit harder and farther.</li>
<li><b>Running</b> (base running speed): The higher the player's running, the faster he/she can go around the bases and the better he/she is at stealing. Running does not affect any aspect of the player's defense; not even his ability to track down fly balls.</li>
<li><b>Defense</b> (speed in the field and distance of throw): Higher defense allows players to easily track down fly balls and close the gaps in the infield. Increased defense also allows infielders to dive for longer distances. Outfielders can jump, dive and climb walls to catch balls (which means a home run could be robbed with correct timing and placement). Players with a high defense rating will be able to throw the ball proportionally. However, a fastball pitcher with great baserunning speed will neither run fast nor throw hard when fielding - if his defense rating is low. <i>A tip for fielding - Not only does a player's defense rating have an effect on the speed of his throw, but the timing of your fingers also plays a part. To maximize a fielder's throwing ability, tap the direction of the throw and the "throw" button simultaneously.</i></li>
<li><b>Luck</b>: This statistic was a purely defensive statistic that would place your fielder closer to the location of a fly or ground ball. A player with maximum defense and luck was a perfect defender</li>
<li><b>Prestige</b> (money): The higher the total prestige on the team, the more fans there are in the stands. With more fans, tickets sales go up and that means more money for the winning team. Just like in real sports, if there are players worth watching, fans will come out just to see the players even if the team isn't very good.</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Stamina</b> (endurance): More stamina allows a pitcher to throw more pitches at high velocity before getting tired.</li>
<li><b>Speed</b> (miles per hour of pitch): The higher the speed, the faster a pitcher will throw the ball. This affects all pitches, not just fastballs.</li>
<li><b>L Curve</b> (left curve): This determines how much of a left hook the pitcher has when throwing a curve ball.</li>
<li><b>R Curve</b> (right curve): This determines how much of a right hook the pitcher has when throwing a curve ball.</li>
<li><b>Drop</b> (breaking ball): All pitchers have the ability to throw a breaking ball by holding "Up" on the D-Pad while releasing the ball (indicated by a slide whistle sound when thrown), but the higher the "Drop" rating, the greater the chance that the sinker will actually sink - rather than hanging in the strike zone for an easy hit. Furthermore, a pitcher with a high "Drop" rating can keep his/her pitch from dropping by holding "Down" on the D-Pad while the pitch is in flight with greater success.</li>
<li><b>Prestige</b> (money): This is the same as above.</li>
</ul>
<p>Pitchers both pitch and bat. Like the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_League_1c21.html" title="National League">National League</a>, there are no designated hitters in Baseball Stars. The pitcher's batting abilities are exactly the same as a regular player with one exception. The prestige in pitching ability is directly linked to the prestige in batting ability. So, if a player has a prestige of 10 in batting, he will also have a prestige of 10 in pitching. If two or more points are added to prestige in pitching, it will automatically add two more to batting as well. This does not mean that pitchers get double the prestige.</p>

Reasons for this included the inability to name players or teams, and unimproved graphics over the original. Two more sequels were made for SNK's <a href="../../../v/i/d/Video_game_console.html" title="Video game console">console</a>, the <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neo_Geo_%28console%29_b873.html" title="Neo Geo (console)">Neo-Geo</a>:</p>

<li><i>Baseball Stars Professional 2</i> (<a href="../../../1/9/9/1992.html" title="1992">1992</a>) featured 12 teams across 2 leagues (exciting league &amp; fighting league) and put more emphasis on graphics and actual gameplay (for example, being able to change pitchers or batters and powering up batters which increased the size of your bat).</li>
</ul>
<p>Two additional games were made with the Baseball Stars title for SNK's handheld systems, <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neo_Geo_Pocket_e708.html" title="Neo Geo Pocket">Neo Geo Pocket</a> and <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neo_Geo_Pocket_Color_58e7.html" title="Neo Geo Pocket Color">Neo Geo Pocket Color</a>: <i>Baseball Stars</i> and <i>Baseball Stars Color</i>.</p>
