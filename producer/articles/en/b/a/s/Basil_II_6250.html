<p>Basil was the son of Emperor <a href="../../../r/o/m/Romanos_II_cf2f.html" title="Romanos II">Romanos II</a> by <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theophano_%28Byzantine_Empress%29_5049.html" title="Theophano (Byzantine Empress)">Theophano</a>. In 960, he was associated on the throne by his father, but the latter died in 963, when Basil was only five years old. Because he and his brother, the future Emperor <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constantine_VIII_532f.html" title="Constantine VIII">Constantine VIII</a> (ruled 1025–1028), were too young to reign in their own right, Basil's mother <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theophano_%28Byzantine_Empress%29_5049.html" title="Theophano (Byzantine Empress)">Theophano</a> married one of Romanos' leading generals, who took the throne as the Emperor <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nicephorus_II_9f24.html" title="Nicephorus II">Nikephoros II</a> Phokas several months later in 963. Nikephoros was murdered in 969, only to be succeeded by another general, who became Emperor <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_I_Tzimisces_6d04.html" title="John I Tzimisces">John I Tzimisces</a> and reigned for seven years. Finally, when John died on <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_10.html" title="January 10">January 10</a>, <a href="../../../9/7/6/976.html" title="976">976</a>, Basil II took the throne as senior emperor.</p>

<p>Basil was a brave soldier and a superb horseman; he was to prove himself a strong ruler and an able general. He did not at first display the full extent of his energy. In the early years of his reign, the administration remained in the hands of the <a href="../../../e/u/n/Eunuch.html" title="Eunuch">eunuch</a> Basil Lekapenos (an illegitimate son of Emperor <a href="../../../r/o/m/Romanos_I_ba11.html" title="Romanos I">Romanos I</a>), president of the senate, a wily and gifted man, who hoped that the young emperors would be his puppets. Basil waited and watched without interfering, and devoted himself to learning the details of administrative business and instructing himself in military science.</p>
<p>Although Nikephoros II Phokas in particular had proven to be a brilliant military commander during his reign, both he and John I Tzimiskes had proven to be lax administrators. As a result, Basil found himself with a serious problem as soon as his reign began. The great landowners of <a href="../../../a/s/i/Asia_Minor_99e3.html" title="Asia Minor">Asia Minor</a>, <a href="../../../b/a/r/Bardas_Skleros_8927.html" title="Bardas Skleros">Bardas Skleros</a> and <a href="../../../b/a/r/Bardas_Phocas_2c1c.html" title="Bardas Phocas">Bardas Phokas</a> – who provided many of the empire's soldiers and taxes – were in open revolt against the empire. Basil, showing the penchant for ruthlessness that would become his trademark, took the field himself and suppressed the rebellions of both Skleros (979) and Phokas (989).</p>
<p>To do so Basil formed an alliance with Prince <a href="../../../v/l/a/Vladimir_I_of_Kiev_8f12.html" title="Vladimir I of Kiev">Vladimir I of Kiev</a>, who had captured the main imperial base in the <a href="../../../c/r/i/Crimea.html" title="Crimea">Crimea</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chersonesos.html" title="Chersonesos">Chersonesos</a>, in 988. Vladimir offered to evacuate Chersonesos and to supply 6,000 of his soldiers as reinforcements to Basil. In exchange he demanded to be married to Basil's younger sister <a href="../../../f/a/m/Family_life_and_children_of_Vladimir_I_a6ad.html#Anna_Porphyrogeneta" title="Family life and children of Vladimir I">Anna</a> (963–1011). At first, Basil hesitated. The Byzantines viewed all the nations of Northern Europe, be they <a href="../../../f/r/a/Franks.html" title="Franks">Franks</a> or <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russians.html" title="Russians">Russians</a>, as <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barbarian.html" title="Barbarian">barbarians</a>. Anna herself objected to marrying a barbarian ruler, as such a marriage would have no precedents in imperial annals. But when Vladimir promised to baptize himself and to convert his people to Christianity, Basil finally agreed. Vladimir and Anna were married in the Crimea in 989. The Rus' recruitments were instrumental in ending the rebellion, and they were later organized into the <a href="../../../v/a/r/Varangian.html" title="Varangian">Varangian</a> Guard.</p>
<p>The fall of Basil Lekapenos followed the rebellions. He was accused of plotting with the rebels and punished with exile and the confiscation of his enormous property. Seeking to protect the lower and middle classes, Basil II made ruthless war upon the system of immense estates which had grown up, in Asia Minor and which his predecessor, Romanos I, had endevoured to check.</p>

<p>Having put an end to the internal strife, Basil II then turned his attention to the empire's other enemies. The Byzantine civil wars had weakened the empire's position in the east and the gains of Nikephoros II Phokas and John I Tzimiskes came close to being lost, with <a href="../../../a/l/e/Aleppo.html" title="Aleppo">Aleppo</a> besieged and Antioch threatened by the enemy. In the 995, Basil II launched a campaign against the <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam.html" title="Islam">Muslim</a> <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arabs.html" title="Arabs">Arabs</a> and won several battles in <a href="../../../s/y/r/Syria.html" title="Syria">Syria</a>, relieving Aleppo, taking over the <a href="../../../o/r/o/Orontes.html" title="Orontes">Orontes</a> valley, and raiding further south. Although he did not have the force to drive into <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palestine_%28region%29.html" title="Palestine (region)">Palestine</a> and reclaim <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jerusalem.html" title="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>, his victories did restore much of <a href="../../../s/y/r/Syria.html" title="Syria">Syria</a> to the empire. No emperor since <a href="../../../h/e/r/Heraclius.html" title="Heraclius">Heraclius</a> had been able to hold these lands for any length of time, and they would remain Byzantine for the next 75 years.</p>

<p>Basil also wanted to restore to the empire territories that it had long lost. At the start of the second millennium, he took on his greatest adversary, <a href="../../../s/a/m/Samuil_of_Bulgaria_cc39.html" title="Samuil of Bulgaria">Samuil of Bulgaria</a>. <a href="../../../b/u/l/Bulgaria.html" title="Bulgaria">Bulgaria</a> had been partly subjugated by John I Tzimiskes, but parts of the country had remained outside Byzantine control, under the leadership of Samuel and his brothers. As they raided into Byzantine lands from 976, the Byzantine government sought to cause dissention by first allowing the escape of the captive emperor <a href="../../../b/o/r/Boris_II_of_Bulgaria_aa3c.html" title="Boris II of Bulgaria">Boris II of Bulgaria</a>. This having failed, Basil used a respite from his conflict with the nobility to lead an expedition into Bulgaria and besiege Sredets (<a href="../../../s/o/f/Sofia.html" title="Sofia">Sofia</a>) in 986. Taking losses and worried about the loyalty of some of his governors, Basil lifted the siege and headed back for <a href="../../../t/h/r/Thrace.html" title="Thrace">Thrace</a> but fell into an ambush and suffered a serious defeat at Trajan's Gate on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_17.html" title="August 17">17 August</a> <a href="../../../9/8/6/986.html" title="986">986</a>.</p>
<p>Basil escaped with the help of his Varangian Guard and attempted to make up his losses by turning Samuel's brother Aron against him. Aron was tempted with Basil's offer of his own sister Anna in marriage, but the negotiations failed when Aron discovered that the bride he was sent was a fake. By 987 Aron had been eliminated by Samuel, and Basil was busy fighting both Skleros and Phokas in Asia Minor. Although the titular emperor <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_of_Bulgaria_21c8.html" title="Roman of Bulgaria">Roman of Bulgaria</a> was captured in 991, Basil lost <a href="../../../m/o/e/Moesia.html" title="Moesia">Moesia</a> to the Bulgarians.</p>
<p>From 1000, Basil II was able to focus on his war with Bulgaria again. Samuel had extended his rule from the <a href="../../../a/d/r/Adriatic_Sea_c752.html" title="Adriatic Sea">Adriatic Sea</a> to the <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_Sea_23fa.html" title="Black Sea">Black Sea</a> and raided into central <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greece.html" title="Greece">Greece</a>, and Basil was determined to reverse the fortunes of the empire. In 1001–1002, the Byzantines were able to regain control of Moesia, and in 1003 he raided into <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macedonia_%28region%29.html" title="Macedonia (region)">Macedonia</a>, taking <a href="../../../s/k/o/Skopje.html" title="Skopje">Skopje</a>. In 1005, the governor of <a href="../../../d/u/r/Durazzo.html" title="Durazzo">Durazzo</a> surrendered his city to the Byzantines. During the next several years, the Byzantines failed to make any significant gains.</p>
<p>Finally, on <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_29.html" title="July 29">July 29</a>, <a href="../../../1/0/1/1014.html" title="1014">1014</a>, Basil II outmaneuvered the Bulgarian army in the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Kleidion_a178.html" title="Battle of Kleidion">Battle of Kleidion</a>, with Samuel separated from his force. Having crushed the Bulgarians, Basil was said to have captured 15,000 prisoners and blinded 99 of every 100 men, leaving 150 one-eyed men to lead them back to their ruler, who fainted at the sight and died two days later suffering a stroke. Although this may be an exaggeration, this gave Basil his nickname <i>Boulgaroktonos</i>, "the Bulgar-slayer" in later tradition.</p>
<p>Bulgaria fought on for four more years, but finally submitted in 1018. This victory and the later submission of the <a href="../../../s/e/r/Serbs.html" title="Serbs">Serbs</a> fulfilled one of Basil's goals, as the empire regained its ancient <a href="../../../d/a/n/Danube_River_00e7.html" title="Danube River">Danube River</a> frontier for the first time in 400 years. Before returning to <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constantinople.html" title="Constantinople">Constantinople</a>, Basil II celebrated his triumph in <a href="../../../a/t/h/Athens.html" title="Athens">Athens</a>.</p>

More victories followed, and Armenia rejoined the Byzantine empire for the first time in two centuries. Basil created in those highlands a strongly fortified frontier, which, if his successors had been capable, should have proved an effective barrier against the invasions of the <a href="../../../s/e/l/Seljuk_Turks_bec0.html" title="Seljuk Turks">Seljuk Turks</a>.</p>
<p>In the meantime, other Byzantine forces restored much of <a href="../../../s/o/u/Southern_Italy_a479.html" title="Southern Italy">Southern Italy</a>, lost to the <a href="../../../n/o/r/Normans.html" title="Normans">Normans</a> over the previous 150 years, to the empire's control.

<p>Basil was to be buried in the last sarcophagus available in the rotunda of <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constantine_I_d3a2.html" title="Constantine I">Constantine I</a> in the Church of the Holy Apostles. However, he later asked to his brother and successor <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constantine_VIII_532f.html" title="Constantine VIII">Constantine VIII</a> to be buried in the Church of St. John the Theologian (i.e. the Evangelist), at the Hebdomon Palace complex, outside the walls of Constantinople. The epitaph on the tomb celebrated Basil campaigns and victories.<a href="http://homepage.mac.com/paulstephenson/trans/epitaph.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://homepage.mac.com/paulstephenson/trans/epitaph.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> During the pillage of 1204, Basil's grave was ravaged by the invading Crusaders of the <a href="../../../f/o/u/Fourth_Crusade_1f82.html" title="Fourth Crusade">Fourth Crusade</a>.</p>

The Byzantine Empire under Basil II, <i>c.</i> 1025</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Basil was a short, stocky man with ascetic tastes, who cared little for the pomp and ceremony of the imperial court, and typically held court dressed in military regalia. Still, he was a capable administrator, who unique among the soldier-emperors, left a full treasury upon his death.</p>
<p>He was worshipped by his army, as he spent most of his reign campaigning with them instead of sending orders from the distant palaces of Constantinople, as had most of his predecessors. He lived the life of a soldier to the point of eating the same daily rations as any other member of the army. He also took the children of deceased officers of his army under his protection, and offered them shelter, food and education. Many of them later became his soldiers and officers, and came to think of him as a father.</p>
<p>Besides being called the "Father of the Army", he was also popular with country farmers. This class produced most of his army's supplies and soldiers. To assure that this continued, Basil's laws protected small agrarian property and lowered their taxes. His reign was considered an era of relative prosperity for the class, despite the almost constant wars. On the other hand, Basil increased the taxes of the nobility and the church and looked to decrease their power and wealth. Though understandably unpopular with them, neither of them had the power to effectively oppose the army-supported Emperor.</p>
<p>Basil never married or had children that we know of. A young man he was a womanizer, but when he became emperor, chose to devote himself to the duties of state. Unfortunately, this meant that he was succeeded by his brother and his family, who proved to be ineffective rulers. Nevertheless, 50 years of prosperity and intellectual growth followed because the funds of state were full, borders were not in danger from exterior intruders, and the empire remained the most powerful political entity of the Middle Ages.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/s/Basil_II_6250.html" title="Edit section: In literature">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">In literature</span></h2>
<p>During the <a href="../../../2/0/t/20th_century.html" title="20th century">20th century</a> in <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greece.html" title="Greece">Greece</a>, interest in the prominent emperor led to a number of biographies and historical novels about him. Arguably the most popular is <i>Basil Bulgaroktonus</i> (<a href="../../../1/9/6/1964.html" title="1964">1964</a>) by historical fiction writer Kostas Kyriazis (b.<a href="../../../1/9/2/1920.html" title="1920">1920</a>). Written as a sequel to his previous work <i>Theophano</i> (<a href="../../../1/9/6/1963.html" title="1963">1963</a>), focusing on Basil's mother, it examines Basil's life from childhood till his death at an advanced age, through the eyes of three fictional narrators.</p>
<p>The first one is Areti Skylitzi, a girl from a noble family whom John I brought to young Basil to be his friend and playmate. She becomes the confidant of his deepest thoughts, and later the only woman who truly loves him. Basil can never marry her, because he was traumatized by the murders of his father Romanos and step-father Nikephoros by their wife and his mother, Theophano. He associates marriage and trust with death and murder. Areti stays by his side, as his unofficial consort, till his death. She alone hears his private thoughts, often filled with self-doubt, sorrow, inner conflict, while dealing with hard decisions. For Areti, Basil is her life-long consort, needing to be comforted.</p>
<p>The second narrator is Nikolaos, one of Basil's generals. He has followed Basil's campaigns through his life, and witnessed his major battles and later his death. For him Basil was his leader, a lord to be respected and served, a "father" of his army.</p>
<p>The third narrator is a Bulgarian general of Samuel who spend most of his life serving his Tsar and fighting Basil. He tells their side of the battle of almost 40 years. For him Basil is the enemy, the slayer of his people, the man responsible for his own leader's death. Accurately describing the historical events and adding fictional to fill in the blanks, it has been considered the best introduction to Basil and his age for a casual reader. It has been continuously reprinted since 1964.</p>
<p>For his part, commentator Alexander Kiossev wrote in "Understanding the Balkans: "The hero of one nation might be the villain of its neighbour (...) The Byzantine emperor Basil the Murderer (sic) of Bulgarians, a crucial figure in the Greek pantheon of heroes, is no less important as a subject of hatred for our [Bulgarian] national mythology "<a href="http://www.scca.org.mk/utb/utb2000/syn_alex.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.scca.org.mk/utb/utb2000/syn_alex.htm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>.</p>
