<h2><span class="mw-headline">Blaxthos</span></h2>
<p>Blaxthos is sitting on this article and trying to make sure that any criticism of bash.org is marked up as POV. If you want an unbiased article, you need to find a way to stop him editing it -- he's obviously incapable of being objective about the issue. 81.1.73.247 11:01, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>He claims on his comment on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bash.org&amp;oldid=68314887" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bash.org&amp;oldid=68314887" rel="nofollow">this edit</a> that "criticism is not encyclopedic content", and that therefore he feels the need to tag the section. However, anyone who looks around Wikipedia can clearly see that very, very many articles have criticism sections, yet are not marked up this way. 81.1.73.247 02:02, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I will assume in good faith that your deletion of my response to your first paragraph was either accidental, or you just don't know any better...</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><b>One</b>, thanks for participating in talk instead of just unliaterally making changes. &#160;:-) Next step: join the wikipedia community by registering!</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><b>Two</b>, "criticism" is not usually considered encyclopaedic content. However, after some back and forth (which was resolved years ago and has since been archived), the criticism section remained in place, along with an explaination section. Due to the unencyclopaedic nature, an off-topic notice is apppropriate tag.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><b>Three</b>, I think you're confusing POV and appropriate content... open up the encyclopedia britannica... I seriously doubt you'll see a criticism section in any article at all. One, criticism is often leveled by people of unknown identity and uncertain motives. It would be very easy for a Ford exec to go and mark up a Toyota article with criticism... but once one weighs the <b>source</b> of the criticism it loses credibility. Likewise, the guidelines of wikipedia on appropriate material are fairly clear. There is no "why toyota sucks" section on the toyota page. That one resides here is, in some peoples' opinions, a violation of wiki guidelines in and of itself. At the very least, it deserves an off-topic notice.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><b>Four</b>, Just because it exists on other pages does not mean it is encyclopaedic content. Go look in an actual encyclopedia instead of justifying your viewpoint by pointing to other articles.</dd>
</dl>

<dd>Hope this helps. &#160;:-)</dd>

<dd><b>P.S.</b> -- doesn't criticism <i>necessarily</i> introduce bias?</dd>

<dd>The fact is, Wikipedia DOES include criticism. The reason it does this is to maintain NPOV. Articles can end up as big puff pieces, and having criticism avoids that -- but criticism can also overwhelm an article, which it's why it's often kept to that one section if there is enough to warrant it. What Britannica does is hardly relevant here.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>And I never intended to get involved in this, really -- this is a public IP and I prefer it that way. But I think marking up criticism of yourself on Wikipedia as being somehow 'irrelevant' is very, very wrong.</dd>

There are many, many ENTIRE ARTICLES devoted to criticism of something or other. If you're right, why haven't all these articles been deleted? 81.1.73.247 11:13, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>does</b> and <b>should</b> are two seperate animals. Wikipedia articles include criticism because anyone can edit them and add their opinion (unencyclopedic) without accounting for their motives, revealing their bias and relation to the subject (*COUGH*).</dd>

<dl>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Also, please note that there is a difference between information that <i>strays from an articles topic</i> (as in an off-topic notice) and <i>challenging the validity or truthfulness of information</i> (there is a completely seperate tag for that). In fact, how can you even claim criticism is "true" or "false" -- <b>it's all opinion, which is necessarily biased</b>!</dd>

<dd>Britanica is the premier encyclopedia, and it is <b>very</b> telling that there is absolutely no "criticism" in a true encyclopedia. Encyclopedias are a catalogues of information, not places for people to air their petty bitches, spite, or anger over how a website is run.

<dd>Just chiming in to say that Blaxthos' rant on 'bias' is humorous since he's the administrator of bash.org. View his contributions to the article over the years to get a living example of the definition of hypocrisy. Also, yeah, you're almost as insecure and petty as you are paranoid, Blaxthos. I'm not 81.1.73.247, and I only knew of this stuff after having your accusations brought to my attention (by yourself and others). Just relax, dude. It's a website. I mean, seriously. Think about that for a minute. Try not being so confrontational and pretending like you're mister wikipedia by linking everyone to policy and their assumed violations of it every 5 minutes.

<dd>My apologies if you are not josh... wouldn't be the first time he has used meatpuppets to start shit regarding bash.org... Britannica does not have hyperlinks because it utilizes a print medium. The comparison there is laughable... Britannica is an encyclopedia (probably the most prestegious one in the world). It does not contain criticism because criticism is unencyclopaedic content. Wikipedeia aims/claims to be an encyclopedia, and has guidelines dictating what encyclopaedic content is. I would imagine that criticism is so rampant because of the sheer volume of people who want to criticize various topics... however, you bypass my main point: criticism is <i><b>necessarily</b></i> biased, and as such, deserves an off-topic tag (if not removed entirely). If your only point is "it should be here because other articles have criticism too" then your logic would also rationalize that posession of drugs is okay because other people possess them. Either way, that doesn't address that (1) criticism is unencyclopaedic, (2) criticism is necessarily biased, and (3) it is not "on-topic." Let's keep in mind here the issue is an off-topic tag, not the existance of criticism. /<a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlaxthos_9d7e.html" title="User:Blaxthos">Blaxthos</a> 05:43, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Right, nice presumed need to throw in the accusation. Before I give you credence, I'll ask that you learn how to spell "unencyclopedic" and "prestigious." At any rate, now that I'm here, many pages on Wikipedia have criticism sections -- even whole articles dedicated to criticism of a particular topic. View Microsoft's article, any page on religion, any page on a politician, any page on an artist, etc. The better articles don't have a 'criticism' section, but they do incorporate popular criticisms with the relevant content.</dd>

<dd>Wikipedia is based on policies and guidelines, not personal beliefs. Did you even read the proposed policy? It is ironic you reference the it, because it says that there should <i>not</i> be a criticism section. I would also like to direct you to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Village_pump_(policy)#Criticism_Sections" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Village_pump_(policy)#Criticism_Sections" rel="nofollow">Village Pump</a>, where uninvolved observers have said in no uncertain terms that the criticism section on this article is quite inappropriate, does not meet wiki guidelines for <i>several</i> reasons (research, sources, NPOV), and should be removed immediately. Finally, please note that I do not desire a "<u>pristine</u>" article; I desire what we should <b>all</b> be striving for -- an <u>encyclopaedic</u> article, not a place to air criticism and spite.</dd>
<dd>P.S. -- "encyclpaedic" is the old english spelling. Google for it. Please forgive my misspelling of "prestigious", it's not a word I often use. &#160;:-) /<a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlaxthos_9d7e.html" title="User:Blaxthos">Blaxthos</a> 13:12, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I'll say again, I'm all for removing the criticism section, but not for removing the criticism content. Work it into the article's content.</dd>

<dd>I also believe you meant to say <b>observer</b> instead of observers when you referenced the Village pump policy.

I also believe that <b>observer</b> went on to say that it was his opinion, and that the article has been tagged for more work -- not that the content should be "removed immediately." If you immediately start trying to spin some trivial reply in another discussion -- replying here with outright lies -- then how can you be NPOV on an article about a project you admin? This is a pretty glaring example of your inability to be NPOV. Your spin machine is off the hook, seriously.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Original Research</span></h2>
<p>I tagged this article as <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">Original Research</a> for items mainly in the criticism section but on the whole the article needs to be on a more solid footing in regards to reliable sources. In the Criticism sections all the "References" are actually <i>examples</i> of quotes from the website. This is a red flag for OR because it reads as a research paper with the examples highlighting a particular point. There is also some hints of "weasel words" which I will tag with a source request. <a href="../../../a/g/n/User%7EAgne27_b326.html" title="User:Agne27">Agne</a> 06:23, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">The <i>Observer</i></span></h2>
<p>I have no vested interest in the subject of this article, in fact I never even heard of Bash.org till the discussion on Criticism section. My interest lies in having quality, sourced and verified articles in Wikipedia. Here is what I observe with the articles.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ol>
<li>Above all it needs to be better sourced. From the Criticism section throughout, you need more then just <i>examples</i> from postings from the website. In every way those are <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">Self published sources</a> that fails WP:RS. An example can be presented as just that--an example but it will not back up and verify a claim by itself. It needs to be connected with an independent secondary source-not personal user blogs. Look for things more along the lines of C-net and maybe a student newspaper like MIT's The Tech.</li>
<li>The Criticism section, if properly sourced, should be intergrated throughout the article. It serves as a lightening rod as a section on it's own. Anything that can't be sourced should not be in the article.</li>
<li>The Response section would probably need to go. This is completely Original Research--even the title sets it up to be that. Now if the independent sources that verify the criticms <i>also</i> verify the response, then it is appropriate to mention that in the article. However, like with the criticism section, anything that can't be sourced should not be in the article.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>I know I'm sounding like a broken record at this point but the key is <i>Sources! Sources! Sources!</i>. Flame wars start over personal opinion because it invites emotions to take part. Being diligent in attaching reliable, independent sources to your edits encourages you to take a step back and see how the "Outside World" views your subject and it makes it easier to keep level heads.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><b>My Recomendation</b> Everyone take a week to work on putting reliable sources in the article--no massive deletes, no unsourced addition. After that week, any unsourced comments (be they positive or negative) should be deleted.<a href="../../../a/g/n/User%7EAgne27_b326.html" title="User:Agne27">Agne</a> 20:01, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>It looks like no one has tried to add any reliable sources to the article. Tomorrow, I will review the article and edit it to conform to NPOV standards in accordance to what is reliably sourced. <a href="../../../a/g/n/User%7EAgne27_b326.html" title="User:Agne27">Agne</a> 23:54, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><a name="Removing_Sections" id="Removing_Sections"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">Removing Sections</span></h2>
<p>I spent an extra couple of days pondering if there was anyway to clean up the Criticism and Response section with a <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">NPOV tone</a> and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>. The big stumbling block was the sources and despite my best Google Foo, I could not find any reliable independent sources to back up any of the claims in either section. Looking at the article's edit history, the only growth since the Criticism section was introduce has been to add more POV claims which the addition of the equally POV response section doesn't balance. Again, the area it falls flat in is with sources. For the time being, I think it's best for the sections to be removed from the article with no prejudice for recreation of a referenced, NPOV successor. However, I do think the more proper place for the criticism is to be intergrated in the article. As a side note, I was sorely tempted to remove the other other unsourced comments (or comments sourced with the unreliable blog/bash.org postings) but decided against for the time being because they were not POV oriented. <a href="../../../a/g/n/User%7EAgne27_b326.html" title="User:Agne27">Agne</a> 06:34, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

So therefore, you use that same reasoning to remove a vast majority of the article's content (most of which was correct, and verifiable had you done a little digging or asking instead of swinging the axe).

<dd>Actually, what's really counterproductive is a luser rolling up and trying to intimidate talk participants with threats of "I WILL GET YOUR ACCOUNT BANNED."

Please try to make yourself seem/feel important elsewhere -- though the conversation may have appeared heated, it was also civil and suspiciously devoid of insults (in either direction) and worked towards resolving a dispute.

<p>Blaxthos, while you may not believe you were uncivil with Markus in calling him childish (Personally, I think that was borderline), you are being quite antagonistic and patronizing to Saxifrage.

(Remember, that the text base medium we deal with gives ways to many interpretation of how words come accross). A proper course would have been to acknowledge his concern, politely state that it wasn't your intent to be uncivil (which I garner was the case) and then go on with the conversation.

<dd>Sorry Agne, but I don't react well to someone throwing down a warrantless threat of "banning an account" on first interaction. Neither am I easily intimidated, nor do I appreciate people who try to make themselves sound important via bullying and fear. It is one thing to have concern for the wikiway/wikicommunity, but it's another entirely to bust up with the "BE NICE OR I WILL HAVE YOU BANNED" over a "<i>borderline</i>" comment. Admittedly, antagonism was not the best reply, but I know the rules well enough to know where the line is.

<dd>As you seemed to be unfamiliar with Wikipedia, I was trying to impress upon you that behaving badly is a serious offense, enough that it can result in blocking. I think how I tried to convey that message wasn't effective: noting that it's a blocking offense, from my perspective, was just a measure of how little name-calling is tolerated; obviously, from the perspective of the person getting the "warning", it sounded like a threat. For that I'm sorry as I didn't mean to emphasise that part of it. And, on that note, I have to thank you for making me consider this, because I'll be able to better avoid miscommunicating that way in the future. It's also a relevant point that "blocking" isn't the same thing as "banning" at Wikipedia (blocks tend to be very short), and I have to keep in mind that someone I'm warning because I think they're unfamiliar with the rules is unlikely to appreciate the difference. So, thanks for that too. — <a href="../../../s/a/x/User%7ESaxifrage_6800.html" title="User:Saxifrage">Saxifrage</a> <a href="../../../s/a/x/User_talk%7ESaxifrage_324d.html" title="User talk:Saxifrage">✎</a> 17:29, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Blaxthos, if you have a problem with me, take it up with me. Don't go editing peoples talk pages to try and garner support. I'm an ex-mod, but I'm currently completely unaffiliated with the site. Be mature. I completely stand by my edits, and I think they're completely fair and more in line with what you desire: "a factually accurate article." For instance, here's plenty of examples of non-neutral tone:</p>
<ul>
<li>bash.org has been enjoying a virtually non-stop queue of submissions</li>
<li>...bash.org and offered all resources necessary to ensure the continued success of bash.org</li>
</ul>
<p>And here's some examples of things that aren't true, which I fixed:</p>
<ul>
<li>with an approval rate of 5% being average (the actual scores show the average being less than that -- the mod test notes are not a statistical document)</li>
<li>or X for a quote which they feel should be removed from the database entirely. If the latter option is selected, the quote is subject to re-moderation. (can you prove to me that this functionality exists?)</li>
</ul>
<p>There's also things which are entirely non-notable themselves:</p>
<ul>
<li>XML feed (we're going to list all sites that have xml feeds now? how is this uniquely important or notable?)</li>
<li>Mod app</li>
</ul>
<p>If you disagree, then awesome, I'm all for hearing a different opinion, and I'll totally own up to being wrong about any of these assumptions (like the counterstrike/quake thing). Feel free to dispute these edits in a proper fashion, but don't presume to go around with completely libelous, incorrect stories and assumptions about me, Blaxthos. You're expected as an adult to resolve your own disputes and handle your own affairs, and as a wikipedian you're expected to limit the amount of times you cry wolf. (Copied to bash.org/Talk page since it discusses the edits), reply there. -<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkusbradley_3543.html" title="User:Markusbradley">Markusbradley</a> 19:23, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
