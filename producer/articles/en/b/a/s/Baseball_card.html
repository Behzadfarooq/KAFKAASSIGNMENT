<p>While baseball cards were first produced in the United States, as the popularity of <a href="../../../b/a/s/Baseball.html" title="Baseball">baseball</a> spread to other countries, so too did the production of baseball cards. Sets appeared in <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japan.html" title="Japan">Japan</a> as early as 1898<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup>, in <a href="../../../c/u/b/Cuba.html" title="Cuba">Cuba</a> as early as 1909<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup> and in Canada as early as 1912<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>The obverse, or front of the card, typically displays an image of the subject with identifying information of that subject. This includes, but is not limited to, player name and team affiliation. The reverse of most modern cards displays statistics and/or biographical information. Many early <a href="../../../t/r/a/Trade_card.html" title="Trade card">trade cards</a> displayed advertisements for a particular brand or company on the back. Although the function of trade cards had much in common with <a href="../../../b/u/s/Business_card.html" title="Business card">business card</a>, the format of baseball trade cards also often resembled that of <a href="../../../p/l/a/Playing_card.html" title="Playing card">playing cards</a>.</p>
<p>While there are no firm standards that limit the size or shape of a baseball card, most cards of today are 2-½ inches by 3-½ inches (6.35 cm by 8.89 cm) and in the shape of a rectangle.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>

<p>Since early baseball cards were produced primarily as a marketing vehicle, collectors began to classify those cards by the 'type' of company that produced the set. The system implemented by Jefferson Burdick in <i><a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Card_Catalogue_1e48.html" title="American Card Catalogue">American Card Catalogue</a></i> has become the de facto method in identifying and organizing trade cards produced in the <a href="../../../a/m/e/Americas.html" title="Americas">Americas</a> pre-1951. The catalogue itself extends into many other areas of <a href="../../../c/o/l/Collecting.html" title="Collecting">collecting</a> beyond the sport of baseball. There are two major shortcomings of this system: it does not include classifications for non-American cards and there are numerous mistakes and inconsistencies in the system. However, sets like 1909-11 White Borders, 1910 Philadelphia Caramel’s, and 1909 Box Tops most commonly referred to by their ACC catalogue numbers. They are respectively T206, E95, and W555.</p>

<p>During the mid-19th-Century in the United States, <a href="../../../b/a/s/Baseball.html" title="Baseball">baseball</a> and <a href="../../../p/h/o/Photography.html" title="Photography">photography</a> were both gaining popularity. As a result, baseball <a href="../../../t/e/a/Team.html" title="Team">clubs</a> began to pose for group and individual pictures, much like members of other clubs and associations posed. Some of these photographs were printed onto small cards similar to modern wallet photos. As baseball increased in popularity and became a <a href="../../../p/r/o/Professional.html" title="Professional">professional</a> sport during the late 1860s, <a href="../../../t/r/a/Trade_card.html" title="Trade card">trade cards</a> featuring baseball players appeared. These were used by a variety of companies to promote their business, even if the products being advertised had no connection with baseball. In 1868, Peck and Snyder, a sporting goods store in New York, began producing trade cards featuring baseball teams.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup> Peck and Snyder sold baseball equipment, and the cards were a natural <a href="../../../a/d/v/Advertising.html" title="Advertising">advertising</a> vehicle. The Peck and Snyder cards are sometimes considered the first baseball cards.</p>
<p>Typically, a trade card of the time featured an image on one side and information advertising the business on the other. Advances in color printing increased the appeal of the cards. As a result, cards began to use photographs, either in <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black-and-white.html" title="Black-and-white">black-and-white</a> or <a href="../../../s/e/p/Sepia_tone.html" title="Sepia tone">sepia</a>, or color artwork, which was not necessarily based on photographs. Some early baseball cards could be used as part of a <a href="../../../g/a/m/Game.html" title="Game">game</a>, which might be either a conventional <a href="../../../c/a/r/Card_game.html" title="Card game">card game</a> or a <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simulation.html" title="Simulation">simulated</a> baseball game.</p>
<p>By early 1886, baseball cards were often included with <a href="../../../c/i/g/Cigarette.html" title="Cigarette">cigarette packs</a> and other tobacco products. This was partly for promotional purposes and partly because the card helped protect the cigarettes from damage. By the end of the century, baseball had become so popular that production had spread well beyond the Americas and into the Pacific Isles<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>

<p>By the turn of the century, most baseball cards were produced by confectionary companies and tobacco companies.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[7]</a></sup> The first major set of the 20th century was issued by the Breisch-Williams Company in 1903.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[8]</a></sup> Breisch-Williams was a confectionary company based in <a href="../../../o/x/f/Oxford%2C_Pennsylvania_2dd5.html" title="Oxford, Pennsylvania">Oxford, Pennsylvania</a>. Soon after, several other companies began to advertise their products with baseball cards. This included, but was not limited to, the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Tobacco_Company_46cd.html" title="American Tobacco Company">American Tobacco Company</a>, the American Caramel Company, the <a href="../../../i/m/p/Imperial_Tobacco_Company_53cc.html" title="Imperial Tobacco Company">Imperial Tobacco Company</a> of Canada, and <a href="../../../c/a/b/Cabanas.html" title="Cabanas">Cabanas</a>, a Cuban cigar manufacturer.</p>
<p>The American Tobacco Company decided to introduce baseball advertising cards into their tobacco products with the issue of the <a href="../../../t/2/0/T206.html" title="T206">T206</a> White Border Set in 1909. The cards were included in packs of cigarettes and produced over a three-year period until the ATC was dissolved. The most famous, and most expensive card for the grade, is the <a href="../../../h/o/n/Honus_Wagner_4380.html#Baseball_card" title="Honus Wagner">Honus Wagner</a> card from this set.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p>At the same time, many other non-tobacco companies started producing and distributing baseball trade cards to the public. Between 1909 and 1911, The American Caramel Company produced the E90-1 series and 1911 saw the introduction of the ‘Zee Nut’ card. These sets were produced over a 28-year span by the Collins-McCarthy Company of California. By the mid-teens companies such as <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Sporting_News_afe1.html" title="The Sporting News">The Sporting News</a></i> magazine began sponsoring card issues. <a href="../../../c/a/r/Caramel.html" title="Caramel">Caramel</a> companies like Rueckheim Bros. &amp; Eckstein were among the first to put 'prizes' in boxes. In 1914, they produced the first of two <a href="../../../c/r/a/Cracker_Jack_90ef.html" title="Cracker Jack">Cracker Jack</a> card issues, which featured players from both major leagues as well as players from the short lived <a href="../../../f/e/d/Federal_League_7300.html" title="Federal League">Federal League</a>. As the teens drew to a close, the Boston Store Department company even issued a set. Interestingly, the company was based in Chicago &amp; the mid-west region, not in <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston%2C_Massachusetts_d688.html" title="Boston, Massachusetts">Boston, Massachusetts</a> as the name would imply.</p>

<p>After the end of <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_I_9429.html" title="World War I">World War I</a> in 1918, baseball card production lulled for a few years as foreign markets were not yet developed and the United States’ economy was transitioning away from wartime production. This trend would continue until the late 30’s when the effects of the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_depression.html" title="Great depression">Great depression</a> finally hit. The twenties produced a second influx of caramel cards, a plethora of postcard issues, and a handful of cards from different regions of the world. During the first two years, an influx of strip cards hit the market. These cards were distributed in long strips and often cut by the consumer or the retailer in the store. The American Caramel Company re-emerged as a producer of baseball cards and started to distribute sets in 1922-23. Few, if any cards, were produced in the mid-twenties until 1927 when companies like York Caramel of <a href="../../../y/o/r/York%2C_Pennsylvania_14fd.html" title="York, Pennsylvania">York, Pennsylvania</a> got in on the fun. In 1921, the Exhibit Supply Company of Chicago started to release issues on post card stock. Although they are considered a post card issue, many of the cards had statistics and other biographical information on the back.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[10]</a></sup> 1922 saw the emergence of the foreign markets after what was essentially a 10-year hiatus. Several Canadian products found their way to the market including products branded by Nielson’s “Big League” Chocolate bars and Willard’s Chocolate Company. Billiken Cigars, a.k.a. “Cigarros Billiken”, were distributed in Cuba, and England, a longtime home to non-sports <a href="../../../c/i/g/Cigarette_card.html" title="Cigarette card">tobacco cards</a>, got into the baseball card market.</p>

<p>Early thirties production soared culminating in 1933 with the <a href="../../../g/o/u/Goudey.html" title="Goudey">Goudey Gum Co.</a> issue from that year. Goudey, National Chicle, and a handful of other companies flooded the market with cards until <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a> began. 1933 also saw the delivery of the World Wide Gum issue. World Wide Gum Co. was based in Montreal and clearly had a close relationship with the Goudey Gum Company. All Four issues put out by WWG closely resemble some of the Goudey issues.</p>
<p>After 1941, cards would not be produced in any significant number until a few years after the end of the war. Wartime production transitioned into the post-war civilian <a href="../../../c/o/n/Consumer_goods.html" title="Consumer goods">consumer goods</a>, and in 1948 baseball card production resumed in the US with issues by the <a href="../../../b/o/w/Bowman_Gum_7dbb.html" title="Bowman Gum">Bowman Gum</a> and the <a href="../../../l/e/a/Leaf_Candy_Company_088e.html" title="Leaf Candy Company">Leaf Candy Company</a>.

By 1950, Leaf had bowed out of the industry.</p>
<p>Toward the end of the decade, Japanese baseball cards began appearing in large quantities. Many of them were produced and associated with <a href="../../../m/e/n/Menko.html" title="Menko">Menko</a>, a popular Japanese card game. More conventional sets from Japan would appear several decades later.</p>

<p>Bowman was the major producer of Baseball cards from 1948-1952. In 1952, Topps began to produce large sets of cards as well. The 1952 Topps set is the most sought-after post-World War set among collectors because of the scarcity of the Mickey Mantle card, the first Mantle card issued by Topps.</p>
<p>Topps and Bowman then competed for customers and for the rights to any baseball players' likeness. Two-years later, Leaf stopped producing cards. In 1956, <a href="../../../t/o/p/Topps.html" title="Topps">Topps</a> bought out Bowman and enjoyed a largely unchallenged position in the US market for the next two decades.</p>
<p>This did not prevent a large number of regional companies from producing successful runs of trading cards. Additionally, several US companies attempted to crack into the market at a national level. In 1959, <a href="../../../f/l/e/Fleer.html" title="Fleer">Fleer</a>, a gum company, signed <a href="../../../t/e/d/Ted_Williams_64ed.html" title="Ted Williams">Ted Williams</a> to an exclusive contract and sold a set of cards featuring him. Williams retired in 1960 forcing Fleer to produce a set of <i>Baseball Greats</i> cards featuring retired players. Like the Topps cards, they were sold with gum. In 1963, Fleer produced a 67 card set of active players, which was not successful, as most players were contractually obligated to Topps. Post Cereals issued cards on cereal boxes from 1960 to 1963 and corporate sibling Jell-O issued virtually identical cards on the back of its packages in 1962 and 1963.</p>
<p>In 1965, Topps licensed production to Canadian candy maker <a href="../../../o/-/p/O-Pee-Chee_a91e.html" title="O-Pee-Chee">O-Pee-Chee</a>. The O-Pee-Chee sets were essentially identical to the Topps sets until 1969, when the backs of the cards were branded O-Pee-Chee. In <a href="../../../1/9/7/1970.html" title="1970">1970</a>, due to federal legislation, O-Pee-Chee was compelled to add <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_language.html" title="French language">French-language</a> text to the backs of its baseball cards. <sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>
<p>In the 1970s, several companies took advantage of a new licensing scheme, not to take on Topps, but to create premiums. <a href="../../../k/e/l/Kellogg_Company_e5f6.html" title="Kellogg Company">Kellogg’s</a> began to produce 3D-cards inserted with cereal and <a href="../../../h/o/s/Hostess.html" title="Hostess">Hostess</a> printed cards on packages of its baked goods.</p>
<p>In 1976, a company called TCMA, which mainly produced minor league baseball cards, produced a set of 630-cards consisting of Major League Ball players. The cards were produced under the name the Sports Stars Publishing Company, or SSPC. TCMA published a baseball card magazine named Collectors Quarterly which it used to advertise its set offering it directly via mail order. However, the set was basically a failure, as it was unlicensed and brought about a cease and desist order from Topps.<sup class="noprint">[<a href="../../../a/t/t/Wikipedia%7EAttribution_916a.html" title="Wikipedia:Attribution"><i><span title="The material in the vicinity of this tag needs to be fact-checked with the cited source(s)." style="white-space: nowrap;">verification needed</span></i></a>]</sup></p>
<p>This type of power provided Topps with the ability to thwart competitors from seriously threatening their market share.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Donruss issued its <a href="../../../l/e/a/Leaf_Candy_Company_088e.html" title="Leaf Candy Company">Leaf</a> brand in 1990; Fleer followed with Fleer Ultra sets in 1991; and Score issued Pinnacle brand cards in 1992.</p>
<p>In the late-1990s, companies began inserting cards with swatches of uniforms and pieces of game-used <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Baseball_equipment|baseball" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Baseball_equipment|baseball" rel="nofollow">equipment</a> as part of a plan to generate interest. Card companies obtained all manner of memorabilia, from uniform jerseys and pants, to bats, gloves, caps, and even bases and defunct stadium seats to feed this new hobby demand.</p>
<p>The process and cost of multi-tiered printings, monthly set issues, licensing fees, and player-spokesman contracts made for a difficult market. Pinnacle Brands folded after 1998. Pacific, which acquired full licensing in 1994, ceased production in 2001. In 2005, <a href="../../../f/l/e/Fleer.html" title="Fleer">Fleer</a> went bankrupt and was bought out by <a href="../../../u/p/p/Upper_Deck_abdf.html" title="Upper Deck">Upper Deck</a>, and <a href="../../../d/o/n/Donruss.html" title="Donruss">Donruss</a> lost the MLB license in 2006 (they also did not produce baseball cards in 1999 and 2000). At that time, the MLBPA limited the number of companies that would produce baseball cards to offset the glut in product, and to consolidate the market. As a result of the measure that included revoking the production license from Donruss, only two companies remained.</p>
<p>Topps and Upper Deck are the only two companies that retained production licenses for baseball cards of major league players. In a move to expand their market influence, Upper Deck purchased the Fleer brand and the remnants of its production inventory. After purchasing Fleer, Upper Deck took over production of the remaining products that were slated to be released. <a href="../../../u/p/p/Upper_Deck_abdf.html" title="Upper Deck">Upper Deck</a> continues to issue products with the <a href="../../../f/l/e/Fleer.html" title="Fleer">Fleer</a> name, while Topps continues to release Bowman and Bazooka card products. Topps is also the only company that continues to produce pre-collated factory sets of cards.</p>
<p>Card companies are trying to maintain a sizable hobby base in a variety of ways. Especially prominent is a focus on transitioning the cards to an online market. Both Topps and Upper Deck have issued cards that require online registration, while Topps has targeted the investment-minded collector with its eTopps offering of cards that are maintained and traded at its website.</p>
<p>During the same time period, MLBPA also introduced a new guideline for players to attain a rookie card. For years, players had been highlighted in previous sets as a rookie while still in the Minor Leagues. Such players would sometimes remain in the Minor Leagues for considerable time before attaining Major League status, making a player's rookie card released years before their first game as a major leaguer. The new guideline requires players to be part of the a Major League team roster before a rookie card would be released in their name, and a designated "rookie card" logo printed on the face of the card.</p>
<p>In early 2007, two developments in the industry occurred within 24 hours of each other, both of which garnered national media attention. First, it was found that Topps' new Derek Jeter card had been altered just prior to final printing. An apparent prankster inside the company inserted a photo of Mickey Mantle into the Yankees' dugout and another showing a smiling President George W. Bush waving from the stands.</p>
<p>Shortly afterward, the hobby's most expensive card, a near mint-mint professionally graded and authenticated T206 Honus Wagner, was sold to a private collector for $2.35 million. It is believed to be the highest price ever paid for a baseball card of any kind.</p>

<p>Baseball cards in the United States have gone through numerous changes in everything from production and marketing to distribution and use. The earliest cards were targeted primarily at adults as they were produced and associated by Photographers selling services and Tobacco companies in order to market wares. By the early teens, many cards were issued as part of games and confection companies began to distribute their own card sets. The market in the United States has been particularly affected by political issues both sports and non-sports related. Economic effects of World War I, World War II, and the Great Depression have all had a major impact on the production of cards. For example, <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_I_9429.html" title="World War I">World War I</a> suppressed baseball card production to the point where only a handful of sets were produced until the economy had transitioned away from wartime <a href="../../../i/n/d/Industrialization.html" title="Industrialization">industrialization</a>. By that same token, the <a href="../../../1/9/9/1994.html" title="1994">1994</a> players' strike caused a decline in interest and industry consolidation.</p>

<p>Topps' purchase of Bowman led to a stranglehold on player contracts. Since Topps had no competition and there was no easy way for others to break into the national market, the company had a de facto monopoly. However several regional sets featuring players from local teams, both major league and minor league, were issued by various companies.</p>
<p>Over the years, there was also a great deal of resistance from other companies. In 1967, Topps faced an attempt to undermine its position from the <a href="../../../m/a/j/Major_League_Baseball_Players_Association_d786.html" title="Major League Baseball Players Association">Major League Baseball Players Association</a>, the League’s nascent <a href="../../../t/r/a/Trade_union.html" title="Trade union">players' union</a>. Struggling to raise funds, the MLBPA discovered that it could generate significant income by pooling the publicity rights of its members and offering companies a group <a href="../../../l/i/c/License.html" title="License">license</a> to use their images on various products. After initially putting players on <a href="../../../c/o/c/Coca-Cola_916a.html" title="Coca-Cola">Coca-Cola</a> <a href="../../../b/o/t/Bottlecap.html" title="Bottlecap">bottlecaps</a>, the union concluded that the Topps contracts did not pay players adequately for their rights.</p>
<p>Fleer even filed a complaint with the <a href="../../../f/e/d/Federal_Trade_Commission_eba7.html" title="Federal Trade Commission">Federal Trade Commission</a> alleging that Topps was engaged in unfair competition through its aggregation of exclusive contracts. A hearing examiner ruled against Topps in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1965.html" title="1965">1965</a>, but the Commission reversed this decision on appeal. The Commission concluded that because the contracts only covered the sale of cards with gum, competition was still possible by selling cards with other small, low-cost products. However, Fleer chose not to pursue such options and instead sold its remaining player contracts to Topps for $395,000 in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1966.html" title="1966">1966</a>.<sup class="noprint">[<a href="../../../a/t/t/Wikipedia%7EAttribution_916a.html" title="Wikipedia:Attribution"><i><span title="The material in the vicinity of this tag needs to be fact-checked with the cited source(s)." style="white-space: nowrap;">verification needed</span></i></a>]</sup></p>
<p>Soon after, MLBPA executive director <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marvin_Miller_64a7.html" title="Marvin Miller">Marvin Miller</a> then approached Joel Shorin, the president of Topps, about renegotiating these contracts. At this time, Topps had every <a href="../../../m/a/j/Major_League_Baseball_9421.html" title="Major League Baseball">major league</a> player under contract, generally for five years plus renewal options, so Shorin declined. After continued discussions went nowhere, before the <a href="../../../1/9/6/1968.html" title="1968">1968</a> season, the union asked its members to stop signing renewals on these contracts, and offered Fleer the exclusive rights to market cards.<sup class="noprint">[<a href="../../../a/t/t/Wikipedia%7EAttribution_916a.html" title="Wikipedia:Attribution"><i><span title="The material in the vicinity of this tag needs to be fact-checked with the cited source(s)." style="white-space: nowrap;">verification needed</span></i></a>]</sup>. Although Fleer declined the proposal, by the end of 1973, Topps had agreed to double its payments to each player from $125 to $250, and also to begin paying players a percentage of Topps' overall sales. The figure for individual player contracts has since increased to $500. Since then, Topps used individual player contracts as the basis for its baseball cards.</p>

<p>In April <a href="../../../1/9/7/1975.html" title="1975">1975</a>, Fleer asked for Topps to waive its exclusive rights and allow Fleer to produce stickers, stamps, or other small items featuring active baseball players. Topps refused, and Fleer then sued both Topps and the MLBPA to break the Topps monopoly. After several years of litigation, the court ordered the union to offer group licenses for baseball cards to companies other than Topps. Fleer and another company, <a href="../../../d/o/n/Donruss.html" title="Donruss">Donruss</a>, were thus allowed to begin making cards in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1981.html" title="1981">1981</a>.

<p>The history of baseball cards in Canada is somewhat similar to that of baseball cards in the United States. The first cards were trade cards, then cards issued with tobacco products and later candies and gum. World Wide Gum and <a href="../../../o/-/p/O-Pee-Chee_a91e.html" title="O-Pee-Chee">O-Pee-Chee</a> both produced major sets during the 1930’s.</p>
<p>In 1952, Topps started distributing its American made cards in Canada. In 1965 O-Pee-Chee re-entered the baseball card market producing a licenced version of the Topps set. From 1970 until the last Topps based set was produced in 1992 the cards were bi-lingual <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_language.html" title="French language">French</a>/<a href="../../../e/n/g/English_language.html" title="English language">English</a> to comply with Canadian law<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[14]</a></sup> <sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[15]</a></sup></p>
<p>From 1985 until 1988, <a href="../../../d/o/n/Donruss.html" title="Donruss">Donruss</a> issued a parallel Canadian set under the <a href="../../../l/e/a/Leaf_Candy_Company_088e.html" title="Leaf Candy Company">Leaf</a> name. The set was basically identical to the Donruss issues of the same years however it was bi-lingual. All the Leaf sets were produced in the United States.</p>
<p>There were several promotional issues issued by Canadian firms since Major League Baseball began in Canada in 1969. There were also several public safety sets issued, most notably the <a href="../../../t/o/r/Toronto_Blue_Jays_5982.html" title="Toronto Blue Jays">Toronto Blue Jays</a> fire safety sets of the 1980s and early 1990s and distributed in the Toronto area.

<p>The first baseball cards appeared in Japan in the late 19th-century. Unlike American cards of the same era, the cards utilized traditional Japanese pen and ink illustrations. In the 1920s, black and white photo postcards were issued, but illustrated cards were the norm until the 1950s. The 1950s brought about cards which incorporated photos of players, mostly in black and white. <a href="../../../m/e/n/Menko.html" title="Menko">Menko</a> cards also became popular at the time.</p>

<p>In 1987 and 1988 the American company <a href="../../../t/o/p/Topps.html" title="Topps">Topps</a> issued two series of American baseball cards featuring cards from American and Canadian <a href="../../../m/a/j/Major_League_Baseball_9421.html" title="Major League Baseball">Major League Baseball</a> teams in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>. The full colour cards were produced by Topps <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_Republic_c12d.html" title="Irish Republic">Irish Republic</a> subsidiary company and contained explanations of baseball terms. Given the unfamiliarity of baseball in the United Kingdom, the issues were unsuccessful.</p>

<p>Topps issued licensed sets in <a href="../../../v/e/n/Venezuela.html" title="Venezuela">Venezuela</a> from 1959 to 1977. Most of the set had Spanish in place of the English text on the cards and the sets included winter league players. There were locally produced cards depicting players from the winter leagues produced by Offset Venezolana C.A., Sport Grafico, and others which were in production until the late 1990s.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../c/u/b/Cuba.html" title="Cuba">Cuba</a>, sets were issued first in the early 1900s. By the 1930s various candy and chocolate makers were offering cards, most notably Baguer Chocolate. The post-World War Two era had cards issued by magazines, candy makers, <a href="../../../c/o/c/Coca-Cola_916a.html" title="Coca-Cola">Coca-Cola</a>, and of course a gum company. In post <a href="../../../c/u/b/Cuban_revolution.html" title="Cuban revolution">revolution</a> Cuba, baseball cards were still issued.</p>
<p>Several sets of <a href="../../../m/e/x/Mexican_League_70a6.html" title="Mexican League">Mexican League</a> baseball cards have been issued in the past few years.</p>
