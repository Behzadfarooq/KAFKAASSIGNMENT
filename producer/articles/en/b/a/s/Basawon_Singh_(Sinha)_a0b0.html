And after his son along with other nationalists was gone she used to wash the place with gangajal so that their feelings were not hurt.</p>
<p>The room of his house where he was born has fallen down and the whole house was in a dilapidated condition till recently when it was renovated to some extent by his descendants rather than the Government.</p>
<p>Basawon Singh (Sinha) was an extremely handsome personality with six feet five inches in height and extremely sharp featured with wheatish complexion.</p>
