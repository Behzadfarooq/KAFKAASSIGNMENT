<p>Thanks to Sikon and all the others who helped revise the article so that it's no longer direct plagiarism.

<p>There seems to be some dispute over whether Bastila was ever the Dark Lord/Lady of the Sith. To avoid an all out edit-war, I have started a discussion at <a href="../../../k/f/a/User_talk%7EKFan_II_ebd6.html" title="User talk:KFan II">KFan II's user page</a> about this topic. Any contributions to the discussion would be helpful. --<a href="../../../n/u/f/User%7ENufy8_2e28.html" title="User:Nufy8">Nufy8</a> 00:50, 15 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Edit</b>: The user who added the content about Bastila being the Dark Lord/Lady of the Sith is unable to verify this account, as per the user talk page linked above. Playing through KotOR suggests nothing about Bastila being the Dark Lord/Lady, merely the Dark Lord's (<a href="../../../d/a/r/Darth_Malak_bb21.html" title="Darth Malak">Malak</a>) apprentice for a short while, and neither does her Databank entry suggest her taking on this title. As for print sources, the only ones dealing with KotOR are strategy guides. If this user or anyone else cannot verify this content in one week, I will remove it in accordance with Wikipedia's <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Verifiability Policy</a>.</p>

<p>Did Bastila survive the Jedi purge between KOTOR I and KOTOR II? And if she did, why?</p>
<ul>
<li>If you indicate that Revan returned to the light in the beginning of KotOR II, Bastila appears near Carth in a scene where the Jedi Exile briefly discusses Revan's whereabouts with him. Bastila converses with Carth briefly in this scene. She most likely went into hiding like the other Jedi Masters that the Exile must locate, allowing her to survive in the same way they did. If you indicate that Revan fell to the dark side, and are playing as a female Jedi Exile, you can catch a brief glimpse of Bastila's hologram imagine discussing Revan's whereabouts. Either way, it seems she most likely went into hiding. <a href="../../../n/u/f/User%7ENufy8_2e28.html" title="User:Nufy8">Nufy8</a> 15:39, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Jedi Purge in between KOTOR I and KOTOR II? what are you talking about? The Jedi who were killed then were killed in the <a href="../../../j/e/d/Jedi_Civil_War_348b.html" title="Jedi Civil War">Jedi Civil War</a> there was no purge. -- <a href="../../../p/s/i/User%7EPsi_edit_6b78.html" title="User:Psi edit">Psi edit</a></p>

<dd>There were still Jedi left standing when the Jedi Civil War ended; the remaining Jedi were "purged" after the war (primarily due to the destruction of <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Star_Wars_planets_03ca.html#Katarr" title="List of Star Wars planets">Katarr</a>), save the <a href="../../../j/e/d/Jedi_Exile_61ab.html" title="Jedi Exile">Exile</a> and the four Jedi Masters he encounters in <i><a href="../../../k/n/i/Star_Wars%7E_Knights_of_the_Old_Republic_II%7E_The_Sith_Lords_a2c1.html" title="Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords">KotOR II</a></i>. <a href="../../../n/u/f/User%7ENufy8_2e28.html" title="User:Nufy8">Nufy8</a> 01:41, 24 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>After the Jedi Civil War there were about one hundred Jedi left in the galaxy. By the start of <i>The Sith Lords</i>, Nihilus and Sion had killed all of them except Revan, Bastila, Ood Bnar, the exile, and the surviving members of the Jedi Council. -- <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJon_Hart_0932.html" title="User:Jon Hart">Jon Hart</a>

<dd>The 100 Jedi figure is given during one of the KOTOR2 loading screens. Those seven are the only survivors we know of, and, considering that most of the galaxy at this time believes the Jedi to be extinct, it's unlikely that there are very many more.</dd>

<p>Hey Jon Hart actually Ood Bnar went into a deep sleep 30 years before KOTOR so he really wasnt part of it. -- <a href="../../../p/s/i/User%7EPsi_edit_6b78.html" title="User:Psi edit">Psi edit</a></p>
<p>Psi, I belive you are sadly mistaken. I mean, do you honestly think that all those Jedi died in the Jedi Civil War? I mean, theres still Coruscant, and other Jedi places.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Actually I think the editor is completely right. Coruscant at this time likely had few if any Jedi. Why do you think the council had go into hiding if they had a safe place to go on Coruscant? The academy at Taris was leveled and it was hinted that almost every Jedi was convened to go to Katarr. Even then, if all the Jedi had survived the war there is still at most 100 of them. Sorry to say that that number is hardly impressive and they are basically extinct at this time in the game. <a href="../../../g/d/o/User%7EGdo01_992f.html" title="User:Gdo01">Gdo01</a> 19:07, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In this article there is much info about how double bladed lightsabers where used. I think it shoould be cut from the Bastila paragraph and made into a separate section of the article? what do you think?</p>

<p>I don't know who the hell figured out Bastila's age as 23. in <b>KotOR</b> Mission (who's a 14-16 year old teenager) says that "You aren't much older than me!" which means that Bastila's age is probably between 18 and 21 (max). Also padawans are mostly rather under than over age of 20 (Anakin became a knight when he was 21) so what's the sense in making non-canonical statements? Don't try to be better informed than Lucasfilm please! I changed her birth date to "circa 3975 BBY" as more reliable.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Mission is fourteen, as is stated in the game. Anakin was almost twenty-three when he was Knighted. <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJon_Hart_0932.html" title="User:Jon Hart">Jon Hart</a> 23:16, 24 October 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Mission can be wrong in estimating Bastila's age. We know, however, that Bastila was already a Jedi when Revan and Malak entered the Mandalorian Wars, and furthermore she was opposing their intent to disobey the council (source: Exile's vision). Besides, Bastila is the male Revan's love interest and Carth (age 38) is the female Revan's love interest, so Bastila can't be that young (although certainly quite younger than Carth, as she's still a Padawan in K1). But I don't know of any source that states her age as 23. - <a href="../../../s/i/k/User%7ESikon_a19b.html" title="User:Sikon">Sikon</a> 04:06, 20 February 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The Exile's vision only took place about seven years before KOTOR1, so she could have been in her late teens or even early twenties at the time and still have acted the same way. <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJon_Hart_0932.html" title="User:Jon Hart">Jon Hart</a> 01:35, 25 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>A developer of Kotor 1 said in the Bioware forums that Bastila was around 19- 23 years old in the first Kotor. If that's true then in the vision to the Exile, Bastila would have been around 12- 16 which can't be right. She must have been in her mid twenties in Kotor 1.<a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarwarsrulez_0754.html" title="User:Starwarsrulez">Starwarsrulez</a> 02:45, 7 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Still, she had to have been at least 21, since Obi-Wan was 21 when he became a Knight, and so was Anikan. I have no clue in hell how you got that he's 23! He was a knight for at least 3 months, since the battle on Praelystin is about 3 months befor Order 66. So I conclude that Most Jedi had to be a knight at 21. <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarthan_the_destroyer_6e62.html" title="User:Darthan the destroyer">Darthan the destroyer</a> 17:54, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The section with the "Spoiler Warning" and the spoiler that the player character is Revan needs to be moved below the table of contents so that it will not appear "above the fold" on the initial page viewing. This is probably the biggest spoiler of the entire game. It should be farther down the page so that it isn't accidentally viewed when the page loads.

<dd>I changed the wording to <i>the player</i> rather than <i>Darth Revan</i>, so that this game will not be wasted for any people who are lead in by the italics, like me.
