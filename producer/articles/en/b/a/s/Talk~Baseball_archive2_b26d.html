<p>Yeah, I was just wondering, the 90 feet to first/second/third/home is what is used in MLB. But perhaps we should state that that may be different in Little League (I know it's different in LL) or high school (not sure). I know that college uses the same difference. But I think we should mention what the other variations. are.--Gamingboy 17:54, Nov 4, 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think its probably only worth mentioning the very common one here. Yes, high schools do use 90 feet, so do all professional leagues I know of besides MLB. Using smaller size fields is pretty traditional for childrens sports, including soccer, and american football, I don't know if we should confuse people by simply calling this an mlb regulation field, when basically everyone but childrens leagues use it. Perhaps a good place to add the rare exceptions would be <a href="../../../b/a/s/Baseball_field.html" title="Baseball field">Baseball field</a>. <a href="../../../s/i/r/User%7ESiroxo_bc18.html" title="User:Siroxo"></a>—<a href="../../../s/i/r/User%7ESiroxo_bc18.html" title="User:Siroxo"><font color="#627562">siro</font></a><a href="../../../s/i/r/User_talk%7ESiroxo_a930.html" title="User talk:Siroxo"><font color="#627562"><i>χ</i></font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Siroxo_49da.html" title="Special:Contributions/Siroxo"><font color="#627562">o</font></a> 21:31, Nov 4, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"mlb regulation field"--no. Most BB is played outside of mlb (high school, college, pony league, AAU etc etc etc) and all use 90 feet. It is said by those who wax poetic or spiritual about baseball that there is something mystical about the 90-foot distance--just right for all manner of great, bonehead, and esp. close plays--and always has been!--Buckboard 18:18, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Congratulations on this being a featured site! That is fantastic. Sports shopping and sports store are valid categories I believe, and was surprised they were taken out. What do other people think? Do you know how many people buy sports gifts for others (not to mention themselves) in this country (world), and those topics contained resource value talking about shopping comparison sites etc. and several examples. Any post we do has to be valuable for the Wikipedia reader on that topic otherwise we don't do it. Thanks!</p>

<p>I object to the inclusion of <i>God Bless America</i> on the main page. Don't get me wrong: I love the song, I love God, I love America; I just don't think this is important enough to baseball. It is not (yet) an established tradition, nor is it so readily identified with the stretch as the article implies. (For example, in Minnesota we sing <a href="../../../g/o/d/God_Bless_the_USA_10c5.html" title="God Bless the USA">God Bless the USA</a> after <a href="../../../t/a/k/Take_Me_Out_to_the_Ball_Game_a30a.html" title="Take Me Out to the Ball Game">Take Me Out to the Ball Game</a>).

<p>(One more thing: if six umpires are used, what do the extra two do?)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The fifth and sixth umpires are stationed in the outfield near the foul lines. They make fair/foul and catch/no catch calls in the outfield, as well as watching for the ball going out of play or fan <a href="../../../i/n/t/Interference_%28baseball%29.html" title="Interference (baseball)">interference</a>. Also, if a base umpire needs to leave the infield to make a call (like near the foul fence), the right field umpire may "rotate" in to cover a potential play at first base. All in all, the details of six-man umpiring mechanics are far too much detail for this article. Maybe umpire mechanics (baseball)?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>No I do not wish it be up here, I was just curious about the umpires, as it wasn't covered in the umpire article. I edited some of the text which I found to be a little unclear.

<dl>
<dd>I reverted your edits regarding this, Nick. Please focus on asking questions on what is unclear to you, because I think everything you addressed is crystal clear. Here's the existing text, with relevant sections bolded:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The ultimate goal of the team at bat is to score runs. The team at bat sends its nine players up to home plate as batters in an order called a <i>lineup</i>. Each team sets its batting lineup at the beginning of the game and may not change the order, except by sending in substitute players. A substitute player fills the same spot in the order as the player he replaced; however, he is not required to play the same position in the field. <b>After the ninth player has batted, the order returns to the beginning with the first player in the lineup.</b> <a href="../../../b/a/t/Batting_out_of_turn.html" title="Batting out of turn">Batting out of turn</a> is not allowed. Once a runner reaches home plate, they score a run, and then are "removed" from the bases <b>(they go sit down)</b> and the next player in the lineup bats.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Each player's turn at the plate is a <i><a href="../../../p/l/a/Plate_appearance.html" title="Plate appearance">plate appearance</a></i>. When the batter hits a fair ball, he must run to first base, and may continue or stop at any base unless he is put out. A successful hit where the batter reaches only first base is a <i>single</i>; if he reaches second base, a <i>double</i>; or third base, a <i>triple</i>. A hit that allows the batter to touch all bases in order on the same play is a <a href="../../../h/o/m/Home_run.html" title="Home run">home run</a>, whether or not the ball is hit over the fence. Once a runner is held to a base, he may attempt to advance at any time, but is not required to do so unless the batter or another runner displaces him.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Depending on the way the ball comes off the bat, the play is called something different. A batted ball is called a <i>fly ball</i> if it was hit in a way causing the fielder to catch it on its descent, or a <i><a href="../../../l/i/n/Line_drive.html" title="Line drive">line drive</a></i> if it is hit in the air, but on a line. A batted ball which is not hit into the air, and which touches the ground within the infield before it can be caught, is called a <i>ground ball</i>.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Once the batter and any existing runners have all stopped at a base or been put out, the ball is returned to the pitcher, and the next batter comes to the plate. This continues until three outs have been recorded, at which point <b>all runners are removed from the bases</b> and the teams exchange sides for the next half-inning. <b>After the opposing team bats in its own order and three more outs are recorded, the first team's batting order will continue again from where it left off.</b></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Locarno, the reason why I edited the text was that the current text did not convey the exact information I was looking for (Alas, I know I am getting on yor nerves). It did not strike me that the runners are seated. To clarify what happens, I expanded the sentence. (I hope that my edit was not misleading). As I have never watched a baseball game, I thought that my edit would be more clear to people like me (especially people from <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Asia_cf77.html" title="South Asia">South Asia</a>). Anyways, that was all that I needed to know in the page, so let me know when you are fully done, I'll give another reading to the article. If the page size is &lt;32 kb, I'll vote in affirmative, the next time it comes.

<dd>I think your question is still answered by the <i>(they go sit down)</i> part in the article. Does this answer all your objections? I'm going to try to fix all the other objections that others stated, but I could use some help from Siroxo or anyone else. This article is almost ready. Also, I've worked on a lot of the linked articles; I invite you to come criticize them as well, if you feel like it--particularly <a href="../../../i/n/t/Interference_%28baseball%29.html" title="Interference (baseball)">Interference (baseball)</a>, <a href="../../../o/b/s/Obstruction_%28baseball%29.html" title="Obstruction (baseball)">obstruction (baseball)</a>, or anything in the Baseball rules category.

<p>Regarding this "They go sit down" section, I've reworded that sentence a bit, to convey that the next batter does not necessarily come up (passe d balls/wild pitches, or even stealing home). Also I changed the notion of "sit down" to "leave play". Also, sorry for my absence, I was away from computers for a few days. <a href="../../../s/i/r/User%7ESiroxo_bc18.html" title="User:Siroxo"></a>—<a href="../../../s/i/r/User%7ESiroxo_bc18.html" title="User:Siroxo"><font color="#627562">siro</font></a><a href="../../../s/i/r/User_talk%7ESiroxo_a930.html" title="User talk:Siroxo"><font color="#627562"><i>χ</i></font></a><a href="../../../s/i/r/User%7ESiroxo_bc18.html" title="User:Siroxo"><font color="#627562">o</font></a></p>

<li>"In the United States, baseball has often been called the "national pastime", and the total attendance for Major League games is more than that of all other American professional sports combined." Surely, this is because each team plays 162 games each season? The article should make mention of the same.
<dl>
<dd>I don't think this matters as much. Clearly there is a demand for these games. I often wonder what baseball attendance would be if each team only played 8 home games per year...probably would also get 60,000 or more just like football--or if the NFL played 6 games per week, attendance would probably fall below the average for baseball--there's no way to say for sure, but that's my hypothetical situation. Anyway, the statement is factually correct, and I believe the article does a good job at saying that Baseball is very popular in the U.S. while also stating that the NFL is more popular by some measurements. Nichalp, as an East Asian, would not likely think that football or baseball are necessarily more popular from this article alone---right? --<a href="../../../p/s/z/User%7EPSzalapski_f9a8.html" title="User:PSzalapski">Locarno</a> 18:29, 24 Sep 2004 (UTC)

<dd>As the article stands at this moment, it is not presenting the fact that the NFL can be more popular; it's simply stating that MLB is the most popular bar none no questions asked. The most recent edit to this statement mentions that it was discussed in here, but I do not see any discussion regarding the phrasing of this. I'd like to point out that the phrase "by any measurement" sounds a lot like something a baseball fan would say. Nothing wrong with baseball fans, but it's not entirely a neutral statement in my mind.

<dd>Well ... no. Because in terms of games played, the NBA and NHL swamp all the other (non-baseball) sports. There aren't enough NFL games to register (and college football, which is often fantastically well attended, and probably as good quality as AAA baseball, is conveniently omitted by virtue of its amateur status. College baseball is neither as popular or as good. (Almost no one jumps from college to the majors, <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Olerud_94ed.html" title="John Olerud">John Olerud</a> not withstanding) . So you *might* argue that baseball was more popular than hockey or basketball. Except, those two games are usually played in tiny arenas, so total the attendance, it might be argued (I've no idea either way) does not actually reflect the popularity. It's a meaningless claim, with no useable metric to decide it one way or the other, so lets leave it out. <a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGareth_Owen_3dfc.html" title="User:Gareth Owen">GWO</a></dd>
</dl>
<p>The above figures do not count the very small leagues (arena football, lacrosse, etc.) If you count these, then technically the others combined just slightly surpass baseball, by a couple million at most. The average attendance edge would not be changed, though. And I think the "major 5" (MLB, NFL, NBA, MLS, and NHL) are what most people have in mind.</p>
<p>I just reverted a change that took auto racing as a sport that has surpassed baseball. Auto racing gets better ratings on average than the "Game of the Week" broadcasts for baseball. --<a href="../../../w/o/o/User%7EWoohookitty_27d9.html" title="User:Woohookitty">Woohookitty</a> 8 July 2005 18:56 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Pitching</span></h2>
<p>I know next to nothing about Baseball, but I was curious about this when I read the article:</p>
<p>Is there a limit on how many times a pitcher can pitch the ball? The article mentions that there is no limit on the number of pitchers that can be used. Is there a limit on how many times a pitcher can pitch? For example, in one-day <a href="../../../c/r/i/Cricket.html" title="Cricket">cricket</a>, a bowler (the cricket analogue of a pitcher) can only pitch 60 balls in a game (that is an over-simplified statement, but that is the general idea).</p>
<p>Also, can the pitcher keep pitching continuously until the pitcher is changed? Again, in cricket, you can only pitch 6 times in a row, and then another pitcher takes your place. He will pitch 6 times and then you can come back and pitch another 6 times, and so on. Is there anything like that in Baseball, or can you keep pitching?</p>
<p>Also, who makes the decision on when to change the pitcher, etc? The coach?</p>

<dd><i>No, there's no limit on how many pitches a pitcher can throw, except that his arm will eventually fatigue. These days, most starting pitchers will throw around 90-110 pitches per start, but could throw as many as 150. There's some evidence that these workloads can cause serious arm damage though. A pitcher will usually pitch continuously, until he is replaced ("relieved") because of tiredness or ineffectiveness. Once he leaves the game, he can't come back and pitch again. He could, in theory, stay in the game playing another position, and then return and pitch again later. This never happens.</i> -- <a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGareth_Owen_3dfc.html" title="User:Gareth Owen">GWO</a></dd>

<p>WELL, YES IT DOES HAPPEN, JUST NOT VERY OFTEN. At all levels the game is played you may sometimes see a fielder go out of the game (usually an outfielder) and the pitcher go out to play that position. A relief pitcher is used to get a specific batter out, then a double switch is pulled with the original pitcher going back to the mound and a new fielder inserted. AS I said, not often, but I've seen it many times over the years, including MLB.--Buckboard 18:25, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As this article is about more than professional baseball, the same applies to amateurs, except that most amateur leagues have a reentry rule which allows any starter, even the pitcher, to reenter the game after being removed. Pitchers in amateur leagues will more often stay in the game after they are done pitching. The manager (baseball's name for the head coach) makes the decision at all levels. --<a href="../../../p/s/z/User%7EPSzalapski_f9a8.html" title="User:PSzalapski">Locarno</a> 16:06, 22 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Fielding positions</span></h2>
<p>Just had a question about the naming of fielding positions in Baseball - the article says that the second baseman and the shortstop stand on either side of the second base (one to the right and one to the left). Is that right and left from the catcher's perspective? For instance, in <a href="../../../c/r/i/Cricket.html" title="Cricket">cricket</a>, fielding positions are named from the batter's perspective, so the naming of fielding positions depends on whether the batter is right-handed or left-handed. Is that true in Baseball too? If they are being named from the catcher's perspective, the batter being right-handed or left-handed obviously doesn't matter. --<a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshwatham_1c63.html" title="User:Ashwatham">ashwatha</a> 16:42, 12 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I don't feel expert enough to edit the article, but it seems to me it lacks explanations on force situations and force outs.</p>
<p>Should the history section include something about Abner Doubleday and Cooperstown?</p>
<dl>
<dd>According to Bill Bryson's "Made In America" p276, Abner Doubleday nor Cooperstown had anything to do with baseball until the National League stated that baseball's rules had been layed down by Doubleday in Cooperstown but supplying no substantiation. Bryson goes on "For one thing Doubleday was not at Cooperstown in 1839... At his death, Doubleday had left sixty-seven diaries, and not once in any of them did he mention baseball... not once in their thirty years of close friendship had Doubleday thought to mention to Mills [president of the National League] that he had invented the game." He goes own to show that the story was dug up twenty years later by a Cooperstown businessman to promote his flagging hotel. "Today even the Hall of Fame doesn't pretend that Doubleday has any connection with the birth of the game." So it seems like one of those bits of Americana made up to bolster a small town. Yes, this probably should be discussed on the main page given how many people think Doubleday invented baseball, but it should rely on more than my single source. --Schwern</dd>

<p>Dealing with the Green Monster at Fenway Park, catching a popup in the vast foul territory off third base in Oakland, hitting one off a catwalk at the Metrodome .. the hill in Houston.. From 1932 to 1973, there were stone monuments in fair territory in Yankee Stadium's center field. What sport can compare to that?</p>
<p><br />
Actually, I started a section on it, but I really think it should be its own article, so I will have a short summary in the baseball article and then I'll point it to the full article on baseball parks.

<p>Can anyone explain MLB's roster and trading rules?

<h2><span class="mw-headline">overbloated and romantic</span></h2>
<p>IMHO, the article has become overbloated with esoteric (to the beginner) details which could be addressed in other pages, and also has several sections which do little more than rhapsodize about the virtues of the game. While I would agree, these romantic passages are kind of out of place in an encyclopedia article. (Think of it this way: EVERY game is "not just a game", and everyone knows this. Also, everyone thinks there is something special and romantic and unique about their favourite sport, so going on about it here doesn't add much. I don't care much for basketball or American football, so when I read an encyclopedia article about it, I primarily want information and a minimum of preaching. The latter could go on Baseball mystique, e.g.)</p>
<p>In short, some editing is needed. <a href="../../../r/e/v/User%7ERevolver_5a6c.html" title="User:Revolver">Revolver</a> 03:38, 17 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Looking back, it's not *that* bad. But still, it's 50K and a just getting large to handle. I'm an avid baseball fan, and reading through it from top to bottom seemed to tax my concentration, so I'm just thinking about someone not familiar. (I'm not saying that anything is irrelevant...just that sometimes the heart of the matter can be more straightforward, even just a rewording or combining 2 sentences into one.) <a href="../../../r/e/v/User%7ERevolver_5a6c.html" title="User:Revolver">Revolver</a> 04:04, 17 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>What struck me about the article is its inconsistency. It starts by trying to explain the game to someone from Mars who has never heard of baseball, then gets into details of the game's history (the part I like) and then off on the romantic tangent (which is perhaps a bit much). I wonder if a separate section is needed for the <i>rules</i> of baseball and other important games like rounders, cricket, etc. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 04:07, 17 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That's interesting. I don't know if there are any other articles dealing with rules. I think there should be a brief explanation of rules, but not complete detail. (Is someone who only knows cricket really going to appreciate the "3rd strike when the ball hits the ground first" rules? This seems to be something that could go on a separate article. Baseball history, statistics, and positions (which are more than just rules) etc. all have their own longer articles, so why not rules? If I were explaining the rules to someone who knew nothing (which I've done), I don't mention the "3rd strike when ball hits the ground first" or foul tips or interference, generally. <a href="../../../r/e/v/User%7ERevolver_5a6c.html" title="User:Revolver">Revolver</a> 04:23, 17 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>For starters, I don't much care for the intro to the article, although I'm not quite sure how I would word it precisely. However, I think it would take me fewer than 5 paragraphs and the TOC box to get to the <i>point</i> of the game, which is to win by outscoring the other team. In the official baseball rules, the first rule generally defines the game in a single sentence, and the second rule defines the objective, which is to win by outscoring the opponent, again in one sentence. That, of course, is the objective for most any team sport. However, in that rule the term "runs" is introduced, thus distinguishing the game right away from other sports (aside from cricket) where terms like "goals" and "points" are used. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 04:35, 17 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>My two cents:</p>
<ul>
<li>Anyone interested in trying a simplistic explanation of the game can find an attempt toward that end at <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simplified_baseball_rules.html" title="Simplified baseball rules">Simplified baseball rules</a>. Good luck.</li>
<li>I am not convinced that the article is too long, but am open to suggestions. Encyclopedia articles on major topics are often long, even longer than this one. I cannot remember ever reading a long encyclopedia article from beginning to end. Is that really the point?</li>
<li>Seems to me that the detail of game play is appropriate, it certainly needs to be somewhere other than <a href="../../../b/a/s/Baseball_rules.html" title="Baseball rules">Baseball rules</a> and/or <a href="../../../o/f/f/Official_Baseball_Rules_42f3.html" title="Official Baseball Rules">Official Baseball Rules</a>. Please take note the number of questions in the Talk above, even with this level of detail, suggesting the need for such detail.</li>
<li>All romance aside, I believe the baseball's influence on culture is important. If the romance is too thick, thin it, but there is more to baseball than the game, and where that content should be included is a matter of discussion. The content is not meant to preach, but provide information relevant for an encyclopedia. Currently, the content captures the essence of baseball in our modern culture. We miss part of the point to say that baseball is just about the game: in other words, baseball has an influence on culture, outside of the game. To say that soccer, football, tennis, NASCAR, have other impacts on culture is precisely the point for placing those impacts in those articles.</li>
<li>The article needs an introduction to bring cohesion to the many topics explored.</li>

But if you're suggesting that Cuba's having won 6 World Cups makes their baseball program superior to the American major leagues, keep in mind that major leaguers as a general rule would not be playing in those World Cups. The American major leagues are the epitome of the game. However, I can't argue that there needs to be a lot more written about baseball in other lands, such as Japan, Cuba, the Dominican Republic and other Latin American countries where there is fervor for the game. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 13:27, 2 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>This article is amateurishly US-centric, considering that baseball is (apparently) the single most popular sporting game in Japan, is the national game of Cuba (olympic baseball champions), etc. If the US really is the de facto centre of baseball in the world, and the importance of the olympic baseball medal is (like the olympic soccer medal) relatively unimportant, then this should be stated in the opening paragraph of an article called 'Baseball in the USA', rather than sort of tacitly acknowledged...</p>

<dd>Greetings! Great suggestion, however even though I do agree that the article is US-centric, I am concerned about renaming it. My concerns is that part of the reason for baseball's US-centricity is that baseball started in the US-a historical fact. Therefore, of necessity, the history of baseball is going to begin in the US. I am not opposed to moving some parts of the article to a 'baseball in the USA' page, but those moves could hurt this page, so I recommend caution. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStevenwmccrary58_d710.html" title="User:Stevenwmccrary58">Steven McCrary</a> 14:55, 20 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I second this opinion. Yogi has become a kind of walking urban legend; anything anybody hears (or makes up) that has a kind of comical, self-contradictory, Zen-like flavor automatically gets attributed to him. I think it probably has something to do with Joe Garagiola making him the butt of his after-dinner comedy shtick. Anyway, as Yogi never said but gets endlessly quoted anyway, “I never said half them things I said.” And then even the misquotes get misquoted, like the one attributed to him here: ”Baseball is 90% mental—the other half is physical,” a mangled (and weaker and less funny) version of the original line, ”Ninety percent of baseball is half mental.” I say chuck ’em all out, except on <a href="../../../y/o/g/Yogi_Berra_6200.html" title="Yogi Berra">Yogi’s own page</a>—and even there, only with a disclaimer to the effect that falsely attributing these things to him has become a widespread popular pastime.

Possible related discussions could include (a) comparing the current MLB doping penalties to those in other sports and (b) the controversy surrounding statistics on implicated (or potentially implicated) players, whether or not such players should be inducted into/removed from the Hall of Fame, etc.</p>
<p>2. This article needs a link to the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum (<a href="http://www.nlbm.com/s/index.cfm" class="external free" title="http://www.nlbm.com/s/index.cfm" rel="nofollow">http://www.nlbm.com/s/index.cfm</a>).</p>
<p>3. The paragraph on the World Series has many typos, but I don't have time to correct them right now.</p>

<dd>Actually, scandals works better as a separate article that we can link from here or from the history of baseball page. I can see mentioning it in the history of baseball section, but beyond that, it should be its own article. As for the Negro League Museum, we have an article on the <a href="../../../n/e/g/Negro_Leagues_54ee.html" title="Negro Leagues">Negro Leagues</a> where that would fit better.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">2 questions</span></h2>
<p>Hi!I'm a baseball fan from Austria. I have 2 questions, and I would really apprechiate it, if you can answer me!1.:Is the strikezone between the two knees of the batter? 2.: How is the Team LOB calculated? Mfg, --<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilG_62ea.html" title="User:PhilG">PhilG</a> 13:04, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi Phil! The <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strike_zone.html" title="Strike zone">strike zone</a>'s vertical dimensions run from the mid-point of the torso (around the uniform numbers) to the "hollow below the knee," according to the official definition at MLB.com. I don't know if that means the top knee or the bottom knee or somewhere in-between. Because the batter stands up when preparing to hit, I can't imagine the vertical distance between the knees would be that much. I suggest writing a message on the <a href="../../../u/s/e/Usenet.html" title="Usenet">Usenet</a> group rec.sport.officiating if you need further clarification.
<dl>
<dd>The bottom of the strike zone should be determined by the front knee; that is, the knee closest to the pitcher.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Team left-on-base is calculated simply by adding all the runners stranded at the end of each inning. For example, if a team has runners on first and third with two out, and the batter then strikes out, the team is "credited" with 2 LOB. If the bases were loaded at the time, it would be 3 LOB. -- <a href="../../../m/w/a/User%7EMwalcoff_a391.html" title="User:Mwalcoff">Mwalcoff</a> 04:12, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Extra Innings</span></h2>
<p>The main article states:</p>
<p>"In the case of a tie, additional innings are played until one team comes out ahead at the end of an inning (if the visitors are ahead) or in an incomplete inning (if the home team scores to take the lead in its half of an extra inning, the game ends at that point)."</p>
<p>This sentence is confusing, but I read it to mean that an extra inning can be incomplete, which is incorrect. A game going into extra innings is, by definition, tied. An incomplete inning can only occur when the home team leads going into the top half of the ninth inning and the visiting team fails to score any runs. Am I missing something?</p>
<dl>
<dd>"Incomplete" as opposed to "complete" which means both teams had a chance to bat. So if one team does not get a chance to bat (which happens often) it is thus incomplete.

<dd>I'm not quite sure what complete means but, there can't be an incomplete extra inning because the visiting side always bats first and they are tied when they do.

<dd>Lol, I don't think I know the point anymore. What are we discussing? My explanation above was to defend that there is no such thing as a tie. If the away team is ahead, the home team has the last chance. Whether the home team pulls through with that <i>last chance</i> or not, it still makes the inning complete. If the home is team is ahead, then the Top of the 9th inning is the away team's last chance. If it the chance is lost, that inning goes <i>incomplete</i>. If tied, they go into extra innings, playing by the rules above. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETommyBoy76_0526.html" title="User:TommyBoy76">tgs</a></dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">origins....again (I know, very boring)</span></h2>
<p>I just took a look at the entry for football (soccer) [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soccer" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soccer" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>]. It references the origins of that sport as over 2000 years old in the form of the chinese game of cuju. I suggest this is a description of a generic activity but nonetheless it gets into the article. Other points of historical reference are the first use of the name of the sport and the first published rules. Naturally these are historical references and do not tally with modern usage or experience. The first published rules of football for example describe a game rather different to the modern game of soccer.</p>
<p>Applied to baseball:</p>
<p>Generic bat and ball games (already covered) [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origins_of_baseball" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origins_of_baseball" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>]</p>
<p>The first rules of 'baseball' - would appear to be 'Ball mit Freystäten (oder das englische Base-ball' (1796).</p>
<p>The first use of the name - apparently 1748 letter (as in article)</p>
<p>It seems to me if baseball had remained and developed on the European Continent (with further codification etc.) the origins of baseball would nonetheless have remained clear and as set out above. The origins of baseball can only be described as 'murky' or 'vague' (as they often are) from an American point of view.</p>
<p>As it is baseball as organised competition and professional sport developed in the United States and this should be referenced distinctly from 'origins' as with other sports.</p>
<p>There have always been a couple of competing mythologies surrounding baseball, one English which has baseball descending from 'rounders' [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rounders" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rounders" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>] and the other American which has baseball as an American invention. If there's one place on the web you should be able to escape this kind of thing it should surely be here.</p>
<p>Basically, the origin of baseball seems to be English baseball (which also gave rise to rounders, rather than the other way round). So in summary baseball was invented as a pastime and a game in England and revived (or maintained) as a pastime and a game in the United States, and further, created there as a modern sport.</p>

<p>Comparisons to democracy and the human condition</p>
<p>Baseball is a demanding sport in which perfection is impossible: Baseball's best batters gain hits only 30% of the time, while even poor batters will manage to get a hit 20% of the time. The difference between heroes and failures lie within that narrow band of performance. Success in baseball, as in life, requires perserverance in spite of repeated failures. This results in the slow accumulation of small differences that differentiate players and teams from each other. This characteristic has invited comparison to both democracy and the human condition in general. George Will expressed this by saying:</p>
<pre>
   Baseball suits the character of this democratic nation. Democracy is government by persuasion. That means it requires patience. That means it involves a lot of compromise. Democracy is the slow politics of the half loaf. Baseball is the game of the long season where small incremental differences decide who wins and who loses particular games, series, seasons. In baseball, you know going to the ballpark that the chances are you may win, but you also may lose. There is no certainty, no given. You know when the season starts that the best team is going to get beaten a third of the time. The worst team is going to win a third of the time. The argument over 162 games is that middle third. So it's a game that you can't like if winning is everything, and democracy is that way, too."

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Some questions</span></h3>
<p>Good evening,<br />
Please forgive me for I know nothing about editing text in Wikipedia or asking a question at the proper place in this discussion page, and so on... plus, forgive me once again for I am french, so I may write not intelligible english ! But I swear, I'll do my best. I love baseball, and I love to think about the rules, to imagine some situations in order to extend my experience - quite unclear, I know. Anyway. Here's my question : <i>"there is no upper limit to the number that may bat in rotation before three outs are recorded"</i>. Does that mean that when the whole team has played/hitted, you can start again from the first player ? Or the maximum limit is yet set to the nine ones ?<br /></p>
<p>Nobody answered to me at this time, and yet I already have another question ! (Yes, actually I'm reading the full pages related to baseball, because if some friend may ask me anything about it and I couldn't answer, I'd rather die) : <i>"The right fielder generally has the strongest arm of all the outfielders due to the need to make throws on runners attempting to take third base"</i> I don't understand why especially the third base and not the other ones ?<br />
Since this message is quite amateurish, please don't hesitate to delete it after you gave me the answer.<br />
Thank you, good night.</p>
<dl>
<dd>You French dudes also have a hard language so forgive me if I am not speaking proper French, Lol. ;). In regards to the first question: The players, in their batting order, can bat until three outs have been made. As you have suggested, the whole team start again from the first player. The second question: Now that you point it out, I would say that that statement is POV. If it is <i>not</i>, I am curious myself. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETommyBoy76_0526.html" title="User:TommyBoy76">TommyBoy76</a> 01:44, 8 May 2006 (UTC)TommyBoy76</dd>
<dd>The right fielder is farthest, physically, from third base, and it is more likely that the right fielder will need to throw to third--such as to get a runner out who is attempting to score--than it is that the left fielder will need to throw to first. The left fielder is phsycally farthest from first base, but by the time a throw made it in from left, the runner would very likely already be safe on base, so the throw would not be attempted. However, the defensive advantage of having the right fielder throw out a runner at third is an important one (since that puts the runner one base away from scoring). Just so you know, there's no stupid questions at all, so don't worry about it. :) <a href="../../../w/e/s/User%7EWesmills_8936.html" title="User:Wesmills">Wesmills</a> 07:28, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks to both of you, that's very kind. Alright for the detail, TommyBoy, even if I guess this situation doesn't happen very often (?). And come on, french is not that hard ! I mean, you're the ones who invented baseball, aren't you, now that's some hard stuff !<br />
Ok, Wesmills, great explanations, I got it. And now that you mention it, I remember this is an event which occurs a lot, I think.<br />
I'm gonna keep reading those pages and let you know if something gets me "doubtful" again (you can say that ?).</p>
<p>Here it is : <i>"In baseball, a foul tip is a batted ball that goes sharp and direct from the bat to the catcher's hands and is legally caught."</i> Then why is this considered as a strike and not as some kind of fly out ? Because it is the catcher who caught it ? Because it is written in the official rules and that's the way it is ? I mean, in these circumstances, it seems quite similar to these foul balls which get high above the umpire's head but not far, these that the catcher always try to catch in case they don't fall among the public behind... I find this situation kind of odd.</p>
<dl>
<dd>It's because foul tips are not considered fly balls. My guess is that the original rule was a protection put in as a compromise to hitters. Strikeouts at first didn't exist and then took 4 strikes and then 3, but fouls weren't considered strikes until the dawn of the 20th century. I have a feeling that the foul tip rule was a compromise for letting foul balls become strikes. But you know, baseball sometimes has kept oddities in the rule that don't necessarily make logical sense. Look at the batter reaching 1st on a wild pitch. I mean. Why is it possible with no one on first but it isn't with a man at first (unless there are 2 outs)? --<a href="../../../w/o/o/User%7EWoohookitty_27d9.html" title="User:Woohookitty"><i>Woohookitty</i></a><sup><a href="../../../w/o/o/User_talk%7EWoohookitty_9ae9.html" title="User talk:Woohookitty">(meow)</a></sup> 11:34, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Well, ok, thanx, Woohookitty, that sound fine to me.<br />
Oh, by the way, while I decided to "reread" (to read one more time !) the "Batting" part, I found some guy who wrote "Go Cardies" or some odd stuffs like that, which I didn't get, but I guess that was vandalism, so I put the old text back. I don't know if I did good and if it was good that I do so, so tell me.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Hahaha, somebody get this French dude a cookie.

<dl>
<dd>A<a href="../../../f/o/u/Foul_tip.html" title="Foul tip">foul tip</a> is indeed a strike and not an out only because of the special rule for it. The reasoning for this is that a foul tip looks like a strike, acts like a strike, and feels like a strike. To call the batter out for a ball caught <a href="../../../i/n/_/In_flight.html" title="In flight">in flight</a> would be quite odd in the case of a foul tip. You will see a foul tip and think its a strike--because of this rule, you will be correct.

<p>Ok, thank you, TommyBoy, then you may help with something : I watched some old match yesterday (that's the best I can do, in France, since we got absolutely nothing about baseball), the Yankees vs the Marlins, and there is something I still don't understand quite well : the errors. In the score pannel, you got runs, hits, and then errors, right ? and there was just one error, for the Yankees, which I guess was some very bad catch Jeter had made. But that is still not quite clear in my mind : what is exactly an error ? Thanks, bye. (Oh, and what are cardies and cubbies, anyway ?)</p>
<dl>
<dd>An error is an <a href="../../../e/r/r/Error_%28baseball%29.html" title="Error (baseball)">error</a>. In Jeter's case, it was obviously a playable/catchable ball.

<p>Hi there, guys. Thanx for the info, TommyBoy. Gee, Locarno, to tell if you guys' articles are confusing ? How could I do more than just asking my amateurish questions since I'm not even an english talking guy ? I'm not the one to tell if these articles are clear or not, I'll let you know when I'll reborn as an american ! For now, let's just say I really appreciate the big work everyone did for this baseball page, I'm reading it everyday like crazy. Ok, just watched some D-Backs vs Rockies old match, and I've come to think to new questions, if you kind guys don't mind :<br />
- Suppose all bases are loaded. Then the hitter got 4 balls. Does he gain a walk ? So there would be a run thanks to the third base runner ? How is this event solved ?<br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>A walk with the bases loaded indeed forces in a run. <a href="../../../v/s/l/User%7EVslashg_16cb.html" title="User:Vslashg"><span style="font-family:Georgia,serif"><b>V</b>slash<b>g</b></span></a> (<a href="../../../v/s/l/User_talk%7EVslashg_99ee.html" title="User talk:Vslashg">talk</a>) 23:31, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">More Questions</span></h3>
<p>Hi there. Ok Locarno, got the play on words, sorry about that, oh, and about the game too, I got it. Ah, today was the Randy Johnson's perfect game ; quite pleasant. Ok, now here are some new questions :<br />
- When it is nineth inning time, why the winning team doesn't play its turn, after the last inning of the opposite team ? Is it just a matter of choice for them ? Is it up to them, if they got more runs, to stop it or to finish the game in order to gain more runs ? There is no rule about that ?<br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>There is indeed a rule. When the home team is winning after 8.5 innings, the bottom of the ninth is not played because it is the last inning, and the losing team has no way to win--only the batting team can score.<br />
<dl>
<dd>Alright, but then does it always happen like that ? Does the rule prevent the home team playing the last half inning ? I mean, maybe the home team might perform some more runs in this last half inning, no ? Aren't runs that important ? <a href="../../../h/e/m/User%7EHemux_e344.html" title="User:Hemux">Hemux</a> 09:28, 14 May 2006 (UTC)<br />

<dd>The home team always bats in the bottom of the inning. The visiting team always bats at the top of the inning. So, in games where the home team is winning at the close of the top-half of the ninth inning, there is no need to play the bottom half of the ninth, since the only possible outcome of the game is that the home team will win. Having them play the bottom of the ninth could only increase their margin of victory, which is unsportsmanlike. Also, if the home team begins the bottom of the ninth behind in points, and then they make runs that put them in the lead, the home team is immediately declared the winner and the game ends. <a href="../../../d/p/o/User%7EDpotter_b94e.html" title="User:Dpotter">dpotter</a> 14:23, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi Hemux- In general when the game is won it doesn't mater if it is by one run or ten runs, it's won. However in some adult amature leagues I umpire in, the playoffs are two or three game total points series. In this case all innings of the first games are played (with no extra innings for a tie) and the rule is in effect only for the last game. But this is not an official rule. --<a href="../../../d/v/8/User%7EDV8_2XL_8587.html" title="User:DV8 2XL">DV8 2XL</a> 09:56, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>- I've got one last video, and then that will be over, I won't be able to watch any more games, for french interest on baseball is simply null right here - "oh, u mean these guys hitting some ball with a woodstick ?" ...ah, man, I'm really sad about that. Anyway, I wanted to know, do you know any comic, webcomic, or even manga dealing serisouly about baseball, so I might keep an everyday's link with this sport ? Even if it is a webcomic with jokes and comical situations, cause if I am able to understand baseball jokes that will mean I understand the rules too.

<dd>Hi there Locarno. I've got a very good connection, right, but you're wrong, I fear I can't afford the subscription to mlb.tv since I haven't got any job, for I am a student. Plus I'm not really interested on sites about baseball : I'm interested on watching baseball games, yes, wondering about rules and situations too, and of course dreaming of myself, playing baseball - for french people don't get out in the nearest city's park to play baseball as lot of american do between friends. So sad, I tell you. I'm not really interested too on these kind of comical movies, I'm sorry but in my opinion they're often quite dumb. Don't you know any that are "serious comical" ? Or even serious. Or webcomics ?<br />
I think after that we will erase all of the text about my questions, since it will be over - and it takes too much place for nothing really that useful !<a href="../../../h/e/m/User%7EHemux_e344.html" title="User:Hemux">Hemux</a> 16:17, 13 May 2006 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline">BASEBALL IN EUROPE</span></h2>
<p>There are no professional baseball teams im Germany and I have never heard of professional teams in any other European country. Nevertheless, I did discover a baseball league in Germany, but had to look it up on the internet. There is a northern league and a southern league containing 5 or 6 teams each, mostly from hick-towns nobody knows. Due to a total lack of public interest there is absolutely no news coverage thus making professional baseball in Germany impossible. As far as I can tell, this is the case in all of Europe. Reading the present wikipedia article on baseball one might come to think that the whole world in crazy about it. This is only the case in very few countries. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 84.161.176.18 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_84.161.176.18_fc69.html" title="Special:Contributions/84.161.176.18">contribs</a>) .</small></p>
<p>"Reading the present wikipedia article on baseball one might come to think that the whole world in crazy about it" I don't think it's quite that bad.

<p>If the runner is heading for a base but one of the opposition catches the ball while covering the base that runner is running to, is that runner out as soon as he touches the base or does the player covering the base need to physically tag him? im british and dont understand. i see players keep their foot on a base when they catch the ball and assume that base is then tagged and so the runner will be automatically out when he touches it, but need clarification :thumbs up: *thanx*— ChocolateRoses <sup><a href="../../../c/h/o/User_talk%7EChocolateRoses_0ac5.html" title="User talk:ChocolateRoses">talk</a></sup></p>

<dd>It depends whether the runner is "forced" to advance because there is another runner (or the batter) on the base directly behind him. For example, if a runner is on first base, and the batter hits the ball, then that runner <i>must</i> try to advance to second. In that case, a fielder would only have to touch the actual second-base bag to get him out. On the other hand, say there is <i>only</i> a runner on second, and nobody on first. In that situation, the runner has the <i>option</i> of trying to advance to third, and they must physically tag him out. If a fielder were to simply touch third base, this accomplishes nothing. Hope this helps. <a href="../../../d/a/k/User%7EDakern74_d8cc.html" title="User:Dakern74">Dakern74</a> 21:18, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Hit by Pitch while attempting to hit a pitch</span></h2>
<p>Hello! I have never submitted a question before so I hope I am doing this right. I have searched for an official answer to this question without success. While batting, if a batter swings at an inside pitch and subsequently the ball hits the knuckles of the batter and the ball is hit in fair play is the play dead and the batter awarded first base as a result of a hit by pitch or is the ball live as it was "hit" in fair play during an attempted swing? Thank you for your reply!</p>

<dd>Part of rule 6.08 <a href="http://mlb.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/mlb/official_info/official_rules/batter_6.jsp" class="external autonumber" title="http://mlb.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/mlb/official_info/official_rules/batter_6.jsp" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> states that in order to be awarded first base, the batter can't be trying to hit the ball. If he swings, the pitch counts whether it later hits the batter or not. If he swings and misses for strike three, even if it hits him after the fact, he's out. I saw that challenged in a minor-league game I think last season. If he makes contact, then the ball's in play. Of course, if it hits the bat first and <i>then</i> his knuckles, it's probably going to be called a foul tip (assuming he's still in the batter's box). Hope this helps. <a href="../../../d/a/k/User%7EDakern74_d8cc.html" title="User:Dakern74">Dakern74</a> 19:26, 27 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Not quite right. This would never be a <a href="../../../f/o/u/Foul_tip.html" title="Foul tip">foul tip</a>. Also, any time a pitched ball hits a batter, the <a href="../../../d/e/a/Dead_ball.html" title="Dead ball">ball is dead</a>--it can never be hit in play or a foul, etc. If the pitch first hits a player's hands (or any part of the body) while he is taking a full swing, it is a <a href="../../../d/e/a/Dead_ball.html" title="Dead ball">dead ball</a> and a <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strike.html" title="Strike">strike</a>, even if the ball is hit. No runners may advance. If a pitch first hits the hands while the swing is a half-swing but "he didn't go", and the umpire judges that the batter didn't try to avoid it, then it is a dead ball and a ball (a pitch not in the <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strike_zone.html" title="Strike zone">strike zone</a>). If he did try to avoid it, then it is a <a href="../../../h/i/t/Hit_by_pitch.html" title="Hit by pitch">hit by pitch</a>. I think these are clear in the articles I've linked. If not, edit them or let me know. If you're confused, just remember this one thing: The hands are NOT part of the bat--ever. --<a href="../../../p/s/z/User%7EPSzalapski_f9a8.html" title="User:PSzalapski">Locarno</a> 14:31, 28 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Batters foul balls off parts of themselves all the time. Usually it's their legs, but still. As long as it hits the bat first, it's foul. However, after looking up the definition of a "strike" in rule 2, I'll agree that it can't ever be put in play. The rule I referenced (6.08) is silent about that. Thanks for the clarification. <a href="../../../d/a/k/User%7EDakern74_d8cc.html" title="User:Dakern74">Dakern74</a> 14:58, 28 July 2006 (UTC)
