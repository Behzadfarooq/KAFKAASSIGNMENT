<dd>Regarding my edits, the fact remains that notability was not claimed at all in any way in the article in queston for Capt. Sunil Khokhar. If someone were to simply write two sentences and say they received the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Congressional_Medal_of_Honor_e881.html" title="Congressional Medal of Honor">Congressional Medal of Honor</a> I would react the same way. Both are proud achievements, but <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">notability</a> requires more than hearsay: "A topic is notable if it has been the subject of at least one substantial or multiple, non-trivial published works from sources that are reliable and independent of the subject and of each other." --<a href="../../../b/a/s/User%7EBaseballDetective_9e4c.html" title="User:BaseballDetective">BaseballDetective</a> 12:23, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Well, then your interpretation of notability is incorrect. If someone wrote an article about a person getting the medal of honour, and if you tag it with csd-a7, then I suggest you stop tagging articles and read <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> first. If a "person has received notable awards or honors" then he/she is notable. Now you could argue with the fact that there are no references on the article. But that is not a csd criteria yet for a good reason. - <a href="../../../a/k/s/User%7EAksi_great_bb76.html" title="User:Aksi great">Aksi_great</a> (<a href="../../../a/k/s/User_talk%7EAksi_great_f9ab.html" title="User talk:Aksi great">talk</a>) 12:26, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>You are simply wrong. Even following your links to <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> it clearly states "The following criteria make it likely that sufficient reliable information is available about a given person. People who satisfy at least one of these criteria may merit their own Wikipedia articles, as there is likely to be a good deal of verifiable information available about them and a good deal of public interest in them." It does not say that it should be done in absence, but it in fact states that outside verifiability should be EASIER if someone falls in such catategory because there would be pubically accessible records. In this case there is (1) a link to a dead page and (2) a link to a bodybuilding competion in the name of the person. Nowhere near notable or verifiable. --<a href="../../../b/a/s/User%7EBaseballDetective_9e4c.html" title="User:BaseballDetective">BaseballDetective</a> 12:31, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You need to keep in mind the fact that this is an article about a person in India. There may not be much material about it on the web. I noticed that you summarily removed two links from the page. And I'm not debating the fact that in the end this may be a non-notable person. Just that these articles should not be tagged under csd-a7. Do remember that CSD-A7 was created to deal with vanity articles and not to get rid of bio-stubs which may or may not have references. - <a href="../../../a/k/s/User%7EAksi_great_bb76.html" title="User:Aksi great">Aksi_great</a> (<a href="../../../a/k/s/User_talk%7EAksi_great_f9ab.html" title="User talk:Aksi great">talk</a>) 12:37, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Nowhere near notable or verifiable. But do I enjoy reading each excuse you're making for what is simply a poorly put together article that has no notability cliams whatsoever. --<a href="../../../b/a/s/User%7EBaseballDetective_9e4c.html" title="User:BaseballDetective">BaseballDetective</a> 12:39, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've no views on whether Capt. Sunil Khokhar is notable or not, but you're wrongly tagging the article. Please review the <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">deletion criteria</a>. The article says that he has won <a href="../../../v/i/r/Vir_Chakra_d9a0.html" title="Vir Chakra">Vir Chakra</a>. Even if doesn't provide any references, it cannot be deleted as <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">CSD</a>. In such cases you should tag the article with {{<a href="../../../u/n/r/Template%7EUnreferenced_31dd.html" title="Template:Unreferenced">unreferenced</a>}} and <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROD_dadf.html" title="WP:PROD">PROD</a> it.</p>

Anybody except the creator of the article can remove the tag.

<dd>Regarding my edits, the fact remains that notability was not claimed at all in any way in the article in queston for Capt. Sunil Khokhar. If someone were to simply write two sentences and say they received the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Congressional_Medal_of_Honor_e881.html" title="Congressional Medal of Honor">Congressional Medal of Honor</a> I would react the same way. Both are proud achievements, but <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">notability</a> requires more than hearsay: "A topic is notable if it has been the subject of at least one substantial or multiple, non-trivial published works from sources that are reliable and independent of the subject and of each other."</dd>

<dd>Dude, I know your edits are in <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">good faith</a>, and the subject doesn't seem to be notable. But, {{<a href="../../../d/b/-/Template%7EDb-bio_ac6d.html" title="Template:Db-bio">db-bio</a>}} should be used only when there is no assertion of notability. A claim of being President of United States can be tagged with {{<a href="../../../n/o/n/Template%7ENonsense_9794.html" title="Template:Nonsense">nonsense</a>}} and deleted.

<p>Hi<br /></p>
<p>I'm thinking your work is secondary to your Bot (or copy/pasted) warnings as your warning to me quoted above was to "please... not add" info. The edit I did not-logged-in (sorry about not being logged in) which is the revision you reverted was to <b>REMOVE info</b> that I personally had placed there. My edit was neither vandalism, nor experimentation; it was after careful consideration for the subject of the biographical article who is living.</p>

<dd>Thank you for the info. But unfortunately the claim that these are valid edits makes no sense. It's quite extreme to say Academy Awards and the mention of them is 'advertising'. And this user refuses to engage in discussion about the topic on actors pages or on the proper <a href="../../../a/c/a/Academy_Award_136f.html" title="Academy Award">Academy Award</a> page. They would rather simply edit from an anon IP as a troll, ignore warnings from me and others and generally not add positively to the Wiki.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It was never my intention to let it get to simply posting warning upon warning, but how exactly do warnings work? Don't they alert admins somewhere on somepage something is up? If so, then why was it allowed to get to that state? If they don't work that way, are they simply a form of social shaming?</dd>

<dd>Warnings by themselves do nothing, the only thing that matters is how an editor responds to them. Some vandals stop after one warning, some don't even after twenty. Sometimes warnings even encourage vandalism (through validation, see <a href="../../../d/e/n/WP%7EDENY_da3a.html" title="WP:DENY">WP:DENY</a>). Other times the very insinuation of vandalism can bring out hostility in contributors who have a reasonable argument. Point is, the whole Academy Award thing is up for debate as a legitimate content dispute, even if that editor has little chance in successfully making his case. If you direct the contributor to a talk page to discuss their desired edits, you then offer a fair opportunity for debate. Sure, sometimes it turns out to be mere trolling, but it's much better to err on the side of good faith. Most people, even trolls, will react better if you treat them with respect and a sense of humility. ˉˉ<sup><a href="../../../a/n/e/User%7EAnetode_cbff.html" title="User:Anetode"><b>anetode</b></a></sup><a href="../../../a/n/e/User_talk%7EAnetode_6721.html" title="User talk:Anetode">╦╩</a> 05:28, 16 March 2007 (UTC)

Of course, the warnings do still "count" whether they are removed or not. If someone you report is engaged in talk blanking, just note that on the report.
