<p>The part that's supposedly written in Basic English uses the words "adjust" and "grammar", which are forbidden. --AxelBoldt</p>

<dd>You forgot the number 10 rule: '<i>10. Use the words of an industry or science. For example, in this grammar, some special words are for teaching languages, and not part of Basic English: grammar, plural, conjugate, noun, adjective, adverb, qualifier, operator, pronoun, and directive.</i> Further, "adjustment" *is* in the list. I'm not clear enough on Basic English to know whether that makes the verb form "adjust" fair game, or if you have to go to "had adjustments made on them". <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrion_VIBBER_bae4.html" title="User:Brion VIBBER">Brion VIBBER</a></dd>

<p>It occurs to me that since the most important feature of Basic English is adherance to the 850 words, it would be easy to write a Web page (or a computer program, etc.) to test a given text for compliance and even help the writer to edit it by highlighting the incorrect words. It's too bad that Basic English does not seem to have caught on anywhere that I know of. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_spector_3e6f.html" title="User:David spector">David</a> 10:36 Aug 3, 2002 (PDT)</p>

<dd>That's not a half-bad idea! Actually, this could probably be accomplished pretty easily using any syntax-highlighting text editor: define a new style where the 850 words and their standard inflections are listed as keywords, and anything else will stand out in a different color. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrion_VIBBER_bae4.html" title="User:Brion VIBBER">Brion VIBBER</a> (neat! <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_spector_3e6f.html" title="User:David spector">David</a>)</dd>

<p>Yes, and this is discussed in the article under <b><a href="../../../b/a/s/Basic_English_33a0.html#Historical_references" title="Basic English">Historical references</a></b>. -- <a href="../../../t/o/b/User%7EToby_Bartels_e090.html" title="User:Toby Bartels">Toby Bartels</a> 20:30, 6 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>--- Can the article itself be linked to a version in Basic English (for comparison purposes)?</p>
<p>The difference between Basic English (and Simple English), and Newspeak is that the former provides a starting point for full English, and the latter is a closed (and reducing) system.</p>
<hr />
<p>Looking at the article history, I see that single words are added to the base vocabulary ("lovely", "whom") by people who did not log in. Currently the 850 words is 851. Could someone verify the base vocabulary and correct this? --Mozai 18:52, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>It seems like the introduction missed 2 key points about Basic English 1.) that the 850 words selected were those that are selected to be those words from a person's total experience needed for communication. And 2.) that as such Ogden made a significant contribution to linguistics. Simplified English owes a debt to him.Jbottoms76 18:48, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Just because they aren't the same exact thing doesn't mean the link shouldn't be there... After all, there is a "See also" section which is about related subjects. It makes sense to link to the Simple English Wikipedia because it's related to the subject of the article. It's likely that a person who's reading about a synthetically simplified version of the English language on the English Wikipedia will be interested in knowing there is another Wikipedia in simpler English (and they may not notice the "in other languages" area). <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael%25Sappir_58a2.html" title="User:Michael%Sappir">Michael Sappir</a> 10:05, 15 October 2005 (UTC)

<p>The faux arguement in the second section is completely one-sided. It seems to be an attempt to discredit the criticism (whether deserved or not.)

<dd>I think that a small amount information in the "Criticisms" section should be saved; for example, I found that the discussion about how "world" can be rendered in different ways served as a useful example of the language in action. Perhaps this example could be worked in after the clause "Ogden did not put words into Basic English that could be said with a few other words" in the first section, or perhaps someone more familiar with Basic English could create a section of examples. The rest of the "Criticisms" section is clearly not NPOV, and I don't think it provides any useful information. I think the section should be deleted, and the relevant information it contains (minimal though this may be) should be moved elsewhere in the article. --<a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabcockd_3ad3.html" title="User:Babcockd">Babcockd</a> 09:33, 21 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In Rule 7 that explains the grammar of Simple English, it states that the operators and pronouns "conjugate." Isn't a better word <i>decline</i>?

<p>Concerning the spelling: There seems to be uncertainty whether Ogden used British or American spelling in his original list. Some lists of the 850 words that can be found on the internet use American English <a href="http://ogden.basic-english.org/words.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://ogden.basic-english.org/words.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> <a href="http://esl.about.com/library/vocabulary/bl850_basics.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://esl.about.com/library/vocabulary/bl850_basics.htm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, others use British spelling <a href="http://www.langmaker.com/wordlist/basiclex.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.langmaker.com/wordlist/basiclex.htm" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> <a href="http://www.geocities.com/checkbahbah/basic.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.geocities.com/checkbahbah/basic.html" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>. On the Simple Wikipedia, there was a dispute about this issue. The so-called "Basic English Institute" (<a href="http://www.basic-english.org" class="external text" title="http://www.basic-english.org" rel="nofollow">www.basic-english.org</a>) only uses American spelling. But this is not surprising, as the website is based in the US. Some people argue that "Basic English" is officially spelt in American English, but I doubted that, because after all, Ogden was from England...</p>
<p>So I did some research in a university library and consulted the original publications, in which Ogden introduced his list of words and his system of "Basic English". The three books are: <i>Basic English</i> (1930), <i>The ABC of Basic English</i> (1932) and <i>The Basic Words</i> (1932, a kind of dictionary with detailed definitions and examples), published by Paul Treber &amp; Co., Ltd.</p>
<p>The answer to the question what kind of spelling is used: consistently <i>British</i>, in all three books. I also noticed that no 'variant spellings' are presented. (On www.basic-english.org, there are two variant spellings included in the word list: plough for plow and grey/gray.)</p>
<p>For the words in the 850-word-list, where two variants exist, Ogden uses the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>BEHAVIOUR</li>
<li>COLOUR</li>
<li>HARBOUR</li>
<li>HUMOUR</li>
<li>PLOUGH</li>
<li>GREY</li>
<li>ORGANIZATION</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that organization is used, not "organisation" (the more common variant in British English nowadays). Ogden does not list any variant spellings. As far as the "international words" are concerned: He provides a preliminary list, the spelling is consistently British (e.g. encyclopaedia, theatre). He says the list should be expanded with time. In "The ABC of Basic English", there is a very nice chart with all the 850 words, grouped into categories. A very exact HTML representation of this chart can be found at <a href="http://www2.educ.fukushima-u.ac.jp/~ryota/word-list.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www2.educ.fukushima-u.ac.jp/~ryota/word-list.html" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>.</p>
<p>So why does the "Basic English Institute" use American spelling and doesn't even mention that the original list as created by Ogden uses British spelling? Probably because the institute is US-based and focuses on a US readership. But they should (IMHO) mention that their "spelling standard" deviates from Ogden's original list...</p>
<p>There is also another publication "Basic English: international second language", published in New York for the American market (to promote Basic English there). It was published more than thirty years later (in 1968) than Ogden's "Basic English" trilogy. I've had a look at it as well, and in a footnote, the editor says that in this book the spellings were changed to the American form. The editor also mentions that Ogden like the idea of spelling reform. However, at the beginning of the book, there is the same chart as in the original "The ABC of Basic English" with British spellings. <a href="../../../d/u/m/User%7EDumbledore_756a.html" title="User:Dumbledore">Dumbledore</a> 15:29, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The language used in Heinlein's science fiction story "Gulf" is very much like John Quejada's Ithkuil (q.v.). It is in no way like Basic English.</p>

<p>I concur "Speedtalk" in "Gulf" is in no way like Basic English. He references Basic in several stories set in space, used by non-first language speakers. Also note that Ithkuil postdates "Gulf" by three decades, and the website credits the story as an influence. 209.43.10.224 01:08, 15 November 2006 (UTC)Mike Williamson</p>
