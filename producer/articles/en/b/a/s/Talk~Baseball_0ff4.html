<hr />
<p>There appears to be a missing segment (marked [***] below) in the section "Team at Bat -- Batters and Runners", [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball#Batters_and_runners" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball#Batters_and_runners" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>]:</p>
<p>A batter always drops his bat when running the bases— otherwise, the bat would slow him down and could give rise to a call of [***] fielder to catch it on its descent.</p>
<p>The missing part would logically include the potential penalty for carrying the bat, followed by a description of a fly ball/pop-up.</p>

<p>Bottom line, America is a very racist country, all humans should be treated equally. With that being said, if one wants to quesion say Barry Bond's records, then the manipulation of who played in the MLB can also be questioned. Specifically the records of all whites before Robinson broke the color barrier in 1947. Therefore, the numbers of Gehrig, Cobb, Hornsby, Ruth, part of Ted Williams, etc.. every player that played before does not have relaible or viable numbers because the statistics of blacks who potentially were better, but did not have the opportunity to play, were not credited. Furthermore, as far as stats, Hank Aaron was the greatest, as far as how the game was played Willie Mays was the greatest but with a white majority the white player is still held in highest regard.</p>

<p>Discussions aren't for ripping on America. If you want to talk about the article, then go ahead, but the only thing it says about Bonds is that he sparked the steroid controversy, which is an unbiased, neutral statement.</p>

<p>The article says an innings is over when three batsmen are out.

<p>Seems to me like this main article gets vandalized like every 4 to 6 hours, nearly always (of course) by anonymous addresses.

<dd>No. Links about collecting specific items aren't even relevant to a general article like this.

<p>Interesting perspective. I would agree that specific items, such as the t206 wagner, or a ball signed by the 27 yankess should not be linked to. However, collecting baseball cards and other related materials are very popular amongst fans of the game. An entire section of the article could even be dedicated to the hobby in general. I would again think that something should be included. Image Repositories, Checklists, and sites that allow one to further their knowledge of the hobby are as relevant as any stat site or film site IMHO. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Wolverinegod (<a href="../../../w/o/l/User_talk%7EWolverinegod_b39a.html" title="User talk:Wolverinegod">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wolverinegod_2b07.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wolverinegod">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

<dd>It's less a perspective than the currently accepted guidelines. We're here to create actual content, not to accumulate links. Feel free to start a section about collecting! I think it would be best to begin with taking the link to <a href="../../../b/a/s/Baseball_card.html" title="Baseball card">baseball card</a> out of the <i>seealso</i>. Put it in the <i>popularity</i> section and write a paragraph around it to introduce the hobby (…or business?), then further expand from there. Split it <a href="../../../s/u/m/Wikipedia%7ESummary_style_1b75.html" title="Wikipedia:Summary style">summary style</a> to its own article when there is enough content (though I predict it will be a commercial spam magnet). Until then, there will be enough time to decide which links are appropriate or not.

<p>It is my thinking that the 'History of Baseball' section should/could have a short paragraph summarising its history instead of just a link?

<dd>Probably couldn't hurt to have a short paragraph, but it would be tricky to put the whole history of the whole sport worldwide into a few sentences. In fact, I don't so much mind the disambiguation page, considering it has about a dozen different countries on it, and you could easily click on the one you're interested in. Not everyone is going to be looking only for the U.S. version, although that also has its own section/link further down (why aren't they together?).

<dd>I don't think there's a huge problem with leaving this since it does say "most" teams. However, I notice that nothing in this section specifies that it's MLB. I'm sure other leagues and other countries have different numbers of players and different deadlines and all that. Except now I'm afraid that if we make this MLB-specific, thirty more well-meaning editors will come along and make this article even looooooooooonnnnngggggger than it already doesn't need to be. It takes forever to load the whole thing, and frankly, I end up looking at it a lot since it gets vandalized every six hours.

<dl>
<dd>I am confused. Your argument would support the idea of removing the list but you say it should stay. Since there is no distinct rule, and various leagues in various countries all have different tendencies, I would again think that supports removing the informaiton. This is also a problem if you look at the habbits of teams over the history of the game. In the US MLB for example, the role of Relief Pitcher has changed dramatically over the past few years. It was not uncommon for a starter to pitch a complete game during the early parth of the 20th century. More feedback would be appreciated. --<a href="../../../t/e/c/User%7ETecmobowl_41d9.html" title="User:Tecmobowl">Tecmobowl</a> 06:41, 2 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yeah, I know, I'm arguing with myself. I guess it's a way of saying that I'm not very fervent one way or the other. I think it should stay for right now, but definitely needs some more clarifying words like "nowadays" or "most" or "Major Leagues". I'm just scared of what will happen down the road.

MLB itself has initiated a program to encourage more American boys to play baseball, pointedly intended to prevent further reduction of the number of black Americans in the pipeline to the majors. Saw a brief story about this on TV including some interview footage with a former major leaguer who is one of the people working on this project. Sorry but I don't have any more specifics. But just ask yourself, does your favorite major league team have even two black Americans on it? I'd guess, possibly not! Those of us who got to see the great black stars of the 50s and 60s, so many of whom are now in the hall of fame, regret this trend. <a href="../../../p/u/b/User%7EPublius3_57ea.html" title="User:Publius3">Publius3</a> 08:45, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The image, as displayed on my fairly cheap system, shows the distance 60 feet 6 inches between the center of the pitcher's plate and the center, more or less, of home plate. This is wrong. The rules require a distance 60 feet 6 inches as measured from the edge of the pitcher's plate nearest home plate, and the corner of home plate that is nearest the catcher. The two points displayed in this image are less than 60 feet 6 apart, and more importantly, neither of the two displayed points is referenced in the rule book. <a href="../../../p/u/b/User%7EPublius3_57ea.html" title="User:Publius3">Publius3</a> 21:49, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>MLB is the standard, so I think that issue would be resolved by noting in the caption something like: "Dimensions given are per MLB regulations" or similar. As for outfield distances, I would have two lines: "Distance down foul lines varies between XXX' and XXX'" and "Distance to straightaway center field varies between XXX' and XXX'" filling in with--as you previously suggested--the min and max distances of current MLB fields (or the current MLB min and max regulations, which I believe are explicitly stated). In any case, the distinction between foul line distance and center field distance should, I think, be made clear.—<a href="../../../d/c/g/User%7EDCGeist_4ed5.html" title="User:DCGeist">DCGeist</a> 19:45, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Looks great! Just need to change minimum foul line distance from 290' to 302' feet. The 290' is probably a reference to the right-field line at Cleveland's old League Park, which the Indians abandoned after 1946. Anyway, the right-field fence was even closer at the New York Giants' Polo Grounds: 258'. Sticking to current figures seems preferable.—<a href="../../../d/c/g/User%7EDCGeist_4ed5.html" title="User:DCGeist">DCGeist</a> 21:33, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I agree with some others that the fence distance should not be MLB-centric--this diagram should cover typical high school/college/amateur/central American/Carribbean/Japanese/etc. fields as well. I would say "fences must be at least 250 feet from home plate, but typically are 300 to 360 feet down the lines and 350 to 430 feet to center field." We should add the MLB distances to the <a href="../../../b/a/s/Baseball_field.html" title="Baseball field">Baseball field</a> article. --<a href="../../../p/s/z/User%7EPSzalapski_f9a8.html" title="User:PSzalapski">PSzalapski</a> 15:43, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'm not clear on the rationale for these proposals: (a) "Fences must be at least 250 feet from home plate." That does happen to be the rule of the International Baseball Federation. But there is no universal authority that can declare a high school or amateur baseball field not "official" (or not a baseball field!) if the fences are 230 feet from home plate, whether it's in Podunk, Panama, or Pyongyang; (b) "[Fences] typically are 300 to 360 feet down the lines and 350 to 430 feet to center field." How did you determine these "typical" distances for the entire globe and at all levels of play?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I agree that using the MLB ranges (clearly identified) is not ideal, but as it provides an actual basis for hard figures that serve to inform the reader, it remains better than all the alternatives proposed to date. We could possibly replace it with the rule and guidelines of the IBF (clearly identified): "The distance from home base to the nearest fence, stand or other obstruction on fair territory shall be 250 feet or more. A distance of 320 feet or more along the foul lines, and 400 feet or more to center field is preferable." <a href="http://www.baseball.ch/2003/as/he/re/rule4.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.baseball.ch/2003/as/he/re/rule4.htm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> Perhaps, to avoid wordiness, phrasing thus: "According to IBF rules, fences must be at least 250 feet from home plate. At least 320 feet down the lines and 400 or more to center field is considered 'preferable.'"—<a href="../../../d/c/g/User%7EDCGeist_4ed5.html" title="User:DCGeist">DCGeist</a> 17:53, 13 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I don't think IBF rules are the standard either. I would guess the majority of leagues in the world play OBR, NCAA, or NFHS rules (all similar), but I don't really know. Any way, you are of course correct. I'd like to see a range of fence distances that cover 90% of the world's "serious" leagues. That seems impossible to quantify, so I just conjectured the distances. I thought it was better than providing MLB-centric distances, which, while being objective and verifiable, isn't the information we want to convey. --<a href="../../../p/s/z/User%7EPSzalapski_f9a8.html" title="User:PSzalapski">PSzalapski</a> 13:59, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I love the fact that the description of baseball's actual play is now more clear. I don't think the huge paragraph on the composition of the Major Leagues needs to be in the introduction. It is too specific to be placed there. I am being bold and deleting/editing it.

<dd>Oh, I didn't notice this before I reverted. Still, I think that content should appear somewhere.

<p>Thanks for being polite about this. To my mind, in an article about baseball which purports to treat the topic on a broad level, two entire paragraphs about the American professional league are not needed in the intro and give it an overly specific tone that will run off the casual/uninformed reader. I think one or two sentences, as I placed them, are appropriate. I will happily see the paragraphs moved farther into the article. <a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParvatiBai_695d.html" title="User:ParvatiBai">ParvatiBai</a> 18:10, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Has baseball's popularity in Australia really grown in recent years. Baseball's main competitor cricket dominates the national attention during the summer months. Baseball's popularity in Australia was at its greatest in the early nineties but as was the case with other American sports like basketball, the popularity took the form of a ephemeral fad. There is delapidated and long disused baseball stadium in the suburb of Auburn in Sydney, Australia built around this time. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../i/m/a/User%7EImalegend_cc14.html" title="User:Imalegend">Imalegend</a> (<a href="../../../i/m/a/User_talk%7EImalegend_4925.html" title="User talk:Imalegend">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Imalegend_4bbd.html" title="Special:Contributions/Imalegend">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<dd>No baseball does not match cricket or any of the other prominents sports in Australia. The most popular summer sports are cricket, tennis and basketball which is also the most popular "American" sport. Cricket is only the most popular sport overall because the football codes are divided into four: <a href="../../../r/u/g/Rugby_Union_a947.html" title="Rugby Union">Rugby Union</a>, <a href="../../../r/u/g/Rugby_league.html" title="Rugby league">Rugby league</a>, <a href="../../../a/u/s/Aussie_Rules_Football_ec06.html" title="Aussie Rules Football">Aussie Rules Football</a> and <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football_%28soccer%29.html" title="Football (soccer)">Football (soccer)</a>. Otherwise, the football codes as a whole overwhelm cricket in terms of popularity. Apart from tennis (maybe basketball in terms of number of people playing it, but definitely not in watching it), there is no other summer sport that competes with cricket. <b><a href="../../../d/a/g/User%7EDaGizza_4a9b.html" title="User:DaGizza"><font color="teal">Gizza</font></a></b><i><sup><a href="../../../d/a/g/User_talk%7EDaGizza_180b.html" title="User talk:DaGizza"><font color="teal">Chat</font></a></sup></i> <sup><b><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_DaGizza_583c.html" title="Special:Contributions/DaGizza"><font color="teal">©</font></a></b></sup> 07:03, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The article currently does not specify whether the handsignals used are universal, or whether each team has their own secret code. I would also like some more text on what precise kind of hand signals are used, like for instance touching the nose, sweeping the rim of the baseball cap etc. This should of course be written into the article by someone who has the requisite backround to know. -- <a href="../../../c/i/m/User%7ECimon_Avaro_6721.html" title="User:Cimon Avaro">Cimon Avaro; on a pogostick.</a> 06:16, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If the hand signals were universal there would be no point to using them.

<p>The following question is not answered in the article:</p>
<p>Does "automatic home run" mean the batter gets a home run without having to [*] actually run around the bases? [*unnecessarily, for someone like me who understands cricket and doesn't understand baseball much beyond "a variation of rounders" - in cricket if you hit a boundary you always get 4 or 6 runs w/o running, may even get 5 or even 7 or more with an overthrow] 59.93.247.165 03:08, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>By "automatic home run", I'm assuming you mean a home run hit out of the field of play. Yes, a batter must still run around the bases, as well as any players that were on base at the time. Usually they just jog a bit, though. :) <a href="../../../b/o/z/User%7EBoznia_5d1f.html" title="User:Boznia">Boznia</a> 03:30, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Lah, me: "Again, there is a technical difference; properly speaking, the outfield consists of all fair ground beyond the square of the infield and its bases. The area between the foul lines, including the foul lines (the foul lines are in fair territory), is fair territory, and the area outside the foul lines is foul territory." Says who? "Infield" and "outfield" are not defined in the rules. I say "Outfield" is all fair ground beyond the grass line, which is defined in the rules, as well as the foul ground nearby (ever heard of an outfield foul ball?). Infield is everything else on the playing field. I don't know about all of this, but I also am sure there is no way you can call the dirt between the direct baseline and the grass line the "outfield". --<a href="../../../p/s/z/User%7EPSzalapski_f9a8.html" title="User:PSzalapski">PSzalapski</a> 15:56, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
