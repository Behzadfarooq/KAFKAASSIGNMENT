<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/s/Basketball_moves.html" title="Edit section: Crossover Dribble">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Crossover Dribble</span></h3>
<p>The crossover is a dribbling technique that involves a motion by which the player, before or while dribbling the ball, changes the dribbling direction by moving or bouncing the ball from one side of the body to the other. It is generally used quickly so that the defender's momentum renders him or her unable to stay with the player's new dribbling direction. This move provides the player a space to pass the defender. Players famous for their crossovers include <a href="../../../t/i/m/Tim_Hardaway_7465.html" title="Tim Hardaway">Tim Hardaway</a>, <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allen_Iverson_ffb9.html" title="Allen Iverson">Allen Iverson</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Jordan_c952.html" title="Michael Jordan">Michael Jordan</a>, <a href="../../../k/o/b/Kobe_Bryant_69d8.html" title="Kobe Bryant">Kobe Bryant</a>, <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steve_Francis_63f2.html" title="Steve Francis">Steve Francis</a>, <a href="../../../d/w/y/Dwyane_Wade_565b.html" title="Dwyane Wade">Dwyane Wade</a>, <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stephon_Marbury_9553.html" title="Stephon Marbury">Stephon Marbury</a>, <a href="../../../b/e/n/Ben_Gordon_e278.html" title="Ben Gordon">Ben Gordon</a>, <a href="../../../r/a/f/Rafer_Alston_2d9d.html" title="Rafer Alston">Rafer Alston</a>, <a href="../../../t/r/a/Tracy_McGrady_234a.html" title="Tracy McGrady">Tracy McGrady</a>, <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joe_Johnson_af22.html" title="Joe Johnson">Joe Johnson</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/r/Chris_Paul_9e71.html" title="Chris Paul">Chris Paul</a>, <a href="../../../t/2E/j/T.J._Ford_8923.html" title="T.J.

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/s/Basketball_moves.html" title="Edit section: Behind the Back Crossover">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Behind the Back Crossover</span></h4>
<p>The behind the back crossover is a variation of the crossover, whereby the player, while dribbling the ball with one hand, bounces the ball behind his back to the other hand in order to switch the direction of dribbling. It is a more flamboyant way to evade the defender while protecting the ball and can also be used to one's advantage when the defender unsuccessfully tries to steal the ball.</p>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/s/Basketball_moves.html" title="Edit section: Under the Legs Crossover">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Under the Legs Crossover</span></h4>
<p>The under the legs crossover is another variation of the crossover, also known as the between the legs dribble. The move is done when the player dribbles the ball in between his legs from one hand to another. It's an effective way to change the direction of dribbling while protecting the ball from the defender.</p>
<p><a name="Spin_Move" id="Spin_Move"></a></p>
<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/s/Basketball_moves.html" title="Edit section: Spin Move">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Spin Move</span></h4>
<p>A spin move is performed when a player spins his body in an effort to change the direction of the dribble or the layup while evading his defender. The spin move can be used while dribbling or in a post position. Post players usually use the move many times during a game in order to lose the opponent. Guards with better ball handling ability can use the spin move when dribbling (commonly known as a "Reverse Pivot"). The spin move gets the body in between the ball and the defender to prevent him from reaching the ball. The drawback of the move is that the ballhandler can be disoriented after performing the move. A slowly executed spin move can also allow a defender to position himself ideally to make a steal by surprising the offensive player, whose back had been momentarily turned.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/s/Basketball_moves.html" title="Edit section: Hesitation Dribble">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Hesitation Dribble</span></h3>
<p>The hesitation dribble is a dribbling action with an intentional change of pace or, like a stutter-step, intended to confuse or freeze a defender. The change makes it more difficult for the defender to predict the movement of the ball and so it is harder for him to make a steal. The move is often performed by street players. In the professional league, players like <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allen_Iverson_ffb9.html" title="Allen Iverson">Allen Iverson</a> are known to use this move in order to generate an easy layup or jump shot. The hesitation dribble is most effective in open-court situtations, and is usually used in half-court sets to sucker a defender closer to the ball before the dribbler blows past him.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/s/Basketball_moves.html" title="Edit section: Bounce Pass">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Bounce Pass</span></h3>
<p>The bounce pass is a fundamental passing technique. The player passes the ball to a teammate by bouncing the ball off the floor. A successful bounce pass can easily result in an assist because a bounce pass is harder for defenders to intercept. At the same time, a bounce pass may still be intercepted due to its slower speed. Thus, a player is required to use his or her best judgement when determining whether or not to throw such a pass. The move has to be executed perfectly because a bounce pass just in front of the defender will result in a turnover or a hard catch for the receiver of the pass.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/s/Basketball_moves.html" title="Edit section: Overhead Pass">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Overhead Pass</span></h3>
<p>An overhead pass is another fundamental passing technique. It is used by throwing the ball over the head with two hands, like a soccer throw-in.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/s/Basketball_moves.html" title="Edit section: Baseball Pass">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Baseball Pass</span></h3>
<p>A baseball pass is usually a pass used to throw the ball at a long distance. Performed with one hand, the user pulls his arm back at a comfortable position behind his shoulder, and thrusts his arm up and forward for velocity and length to the pass.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/s/Basketball_moves.html" title="Edit section: Jump pass">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Jump pass</span></h3>
<p>A jump pass is a pass performed while the passing player's feet are off the floor. When done intentionally, it can sometimes confuse the defender, causing him to believe that the passer is shooting instead of passing. However, it at times is done as a result of the player having their shooting lane blocked and often leads to the player turning the ball over to the opposing team.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/s/Basketball_moves.html" title="Edit section: No-Look Pass">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">No-Look Pass</span></h3>
<p>Also known as a <b>blind pass</b>, the blind pass is performed when a player looks in one direction but passes the ball to his target in another direction. No-look passes are risky and as a result are not often performed. However, when done correctly, no-look passes often confuse the defender(s). The no-look pass has been popularised by players such as <a href="../../../p/e/t/Pete_Maravich_6bd8.html" title="Pete Maravich">Pete Maravich</a>, <a href="../../../i/s/i/Isiah_Thomas_368d.html" title="Isiah Thomas">Isiah Thomas</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magic_Johnson_b171.html" title="Magic Johnson">Magic Johnson</a> , and recently <a href="../../../j/a/s/Jason_Kidd_8d49.html" title="Jason Kidd">Jason Kidd</a>.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/s/Basketball_moves.html" title="Edit section: Behind-the-back">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Behind-the-back</span></h3>
<p>Behind-the-back passes are passes dealt to a target behind the passer's back. Usually done to confuse the defender, behind the back passes can either be bounced off the floor or passed directly to a teammate. However, most behind-the-back passes are direct. <a href="../../../c/h/r/Chris_Webber_6397.html" title="Chris Webber">Chris Webber</a> is famed for using this move down in the paint.</p>
<p><a name="Elbow_Pass" id="Elbow_Pass"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/s/Basketball_moves.html" title="Edit section: Elbow Pass">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Elbow Pass</span></h3>
<p>Introduced to much hype by <a href="../../../j/a/s/Jason_Williams_ec0f.html" title="Jason Williams">Jason Williams</a>, the Elbow Pass is one of the most difficult trick passes to execute. The Elbow Pass serves as a devastating compliment to the Behind-the-Back pass and can be used with varying no-look elements. Most effective on a fast-break, the Elbow Pass entails what appears to the defender as a simple Behind-the-Back pass, but as the ball crosses the passer's back, the passer hits it with his elbow, redirecting the ball back toward the side it started on and hopefully leaving the defender(s) flatfooted. Williams was able to pull off this pass at a full sprint during a Rookie All-Star game, but most amateurs have trouble hitting the ball with their elbow while standing still.</p>

<p>"Give and Go" is an offensive play that involves passing the ball (give) and then running (go) to an open spot to receive the ball back, usually near the basket, for an easy score. This play can be effective when the defender pays too much attention to the ball instead of the player who moves after passing the ball.</p>

<p>A back door play is when a player without the ball gets behind the defense and receives a pass for an easy score. This can be executed if the defenders are unaware of the open space behind them. Also, when a defender overcommits on defense (e.g. tries to steal or deny a pass), they are vulnerable to a backdoor play.

<p>A finger roll is performed when a player holds the ball with one hand during a layup and then lifts his fingers, rolling the ball into the basket. The rolling motion provides the ball with a soft touch, and the ball will roll around the rim and then drop into the basket.

A player usually starts the layup procedure from a distance further away from the basket. The ball is generally released earlier and in a higher arch then the normal layup. The ball is usually away before the taller defender has the chance to block it. It is so named because the ball drops down from the high point of the arch like a falling tear drop. <a href="../../../g/a/r/Gary_Payton_db55.html" title="Gary Payton">Gary Payton</a> of the <a href="../../../m/i/a/Miami_Heat_9ca0.html" title="Miami Heat">Miami Heat</a> and <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Stockton_cac4.html" title="John Stockton">John Stockton</a> of the <a href="../../../u/t/a/Utah_Jazz_5c87.html" title="Utah Jazz">Utah Jazz</a> during their primes in the early-to-mid 90s were considered to have the best tear drops in the game.

<p>Power drive is a continuation move in which a player stops dribbling and makes a huge leap forward, in the mean time securing the ball from the dribbling hand to both hands, then making a layup. The move is generally used as a layup because the huge movement coming from the forward leap provides the momentum for the player to jump forward for a layup. The move is a great way to squeeze the player under the basket for a fast layup.</p>

<p>A <b>bank shot</b> in <a href="../../../b/a/s/Basketball.html" title="Basketball">basketball</a> is a shot that relies on the ball bouncing off backboard and into the basket. It is mostly used for mid-ranged <a href="../../../j/u/m/Jump_shot.html" title="Jump shot">jump shots</a> from an angle (usually at the elbow) and <a href="../../../l/a/y/Layup.html" title="Layup">layups</a>. It is less used for long-ranged shots or shots from the middle. The purpose of using the backboard is to try to hit the backboard at an angle, thus slowing the speed of the ball and increasing its chances of falling into the hoop. Other terms for a bankshot are "off the glass". <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Basketball_Association_2e33.html" title="National Basketball Association">NBA</a> players known for using the bankshot often are <a href="../../../t/i/m/Tim_Duncan_b8df.html" title="Tim Duncan">Tim Duncan</a>, <a href="../../../d/w/y/Dwyane_Wade_565b.html" title="Dwyane Wade">Dwyane Wade</a>, <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scottie_Pippen_8c4b.html" title="Scottie Pippen">Scottie Pippen</a>, and <a href="../../../t/o/n/Tony_Parker_20bb.html" title="Tony Parker">Tony Parker</a>.</p>

<p>A putback describes a situation where a player secures an offensive rebound then immediately scores a basket. If the player secures the rebound while in the air, then, to be considered a putback, the player can land on the ground before shooting and cannot dribble before taking the shot. If the player does not secure the rebound but instead taps the ball into the basket, it is considered a <b>tip-in</b>. There is a point where a putback and a tip-in are a matter of subjective difference (e.g. a one-handed rebound in the air followed by a score before touching the ground). A <b>putback jam</b> is a spectacular alternative to the tip-in where the ball is slam-dunked off the rebound in the same motion.</p>

<p><b>Triple threat</b> is the position when a player facing a defender receives a pass but has not dribbled yet. The offensive player's feet are slightly wider than shoulder width, his knees flexed, with both hands on the basketball in front of him, presenting the defender with an opponent able to move in any direction. One foot is held as the pivot. From this, the player can choose from three options: to <a href="../../../j/u/m/Jump_shot.html" title="Jump shot">shoot</a>, to <a href="../../../d/r/i/Dribble.html" title="Dribble">dribble</a> past the defender or to <a href="../../../p/a/s/Pass.html" title="Pass">pass</a> it to a teammate. There are also options to get the defender out of his defensive stances by using <b>jab steps</b> and <b>pump fakes</b>.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/s/Basketball_moves.html" title="Edit section: Jab Step">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Jab Step</span></h3>
<p>Jab step is performed when a player holds onto the ball before dribbling while his non-pivot leg performs a routine jabbing. This move is used to test defender's defensive weaknesses and stance. A combination of the pump fake, the drive, the shot and the crossover drive can be performed along with the jab step to lure the opponent out of his defense. <a href="../../../d/e/n/Denver_Nuggets_e448.html" title="Denver Nuggets">Denver Nuggets</a> forward <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carmelo_Anthony_92f0.html" title="Carmelo Anthony">Carmelo Anthony</a> is well-known for taking the jab step. When he does this, the defender falls off from his defensive stance, creating a space between him and the defender, allowing him to take a quick mid-range jumper, a three-pointer, or a drive "to the lane".</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/s/Basketball_moves.html" title="Edit section: Pump Fake">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Pump Fake</span></h3>
<p>Pump fake is a fake shooting motion in which a player pretends to shoot by quickly moving the ball upwards. The player does not jump nor release the ball. It is a move intended to get the defender to jump for a block. If the defender is baited to jump and the player hasn't dribbled yet, the player can dribble past the defender while the defender is still up in the air. If the player has dribbled, he can use this gap of defense to shoot or to pass the ball. Relative to this type of play, the player can draw a foul from the defender baited to jump up. On that sequence, the player would draw contact on the defender and shoot the ball up to the ring. On that note, the shooter would either get a chance for a bonus free throw (if the player successfully made the shot) or a chance for an act of shooting at the <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charity_stripe.html" title="Charity stripe">charity stripe</a> (if the player wasn't able to make the shot). <a href="../../../r/e/g/Reggie_Miller_cb21.html" title="Reggie Miller">Reggie Miller</a>, with his high free throw percentage, was very successful with the pump fake and drawing the foul.</p>

<p>An offensive move intended to produce a foul call on the defensive player. A typical strategy is to drive into a defensive player whose feet are not stationary. When the two players make bodily contact, a foul can be called on the defensive player. If the defensive player has a set position (ie, both feet are stationary and arms are not in a downward motion) the contact can result in a charging foul against the offensive player.</p>

<p>To "post up" is to establish a position in the low post, the area near the basket below the foul line, usually in order to take advantage of a smaller defender. The offensive player usually faces away from the basket, so that his body can protect the ball from the defender. From this position, options such as spinning or backing down the defender to close in to the basket for better scoring opportunities become available to him.</p>

<p>The up and under is a move consisting of two parts, a shot fake (the up) and a step-through (the under). First the player with the ball fakes a shot by thrusting the ball above his head as if to take a shot, then when the defender jumps in an attempt to block the shot, the offensive player steps by him and attempts a clear, unguarded shot. <a href="../../../k/e/v/Kevin_McHale_4bf8.html" title="Kevin McHale">Kevin McHale</a> was considered a master of this move, generally used by post players<sup id="_ref-Thorpe_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Thorpe" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>

<p>The hook shot is one of the most effective inside moves, but it is also quite difficult to execute. A hook shot begins when the player with the ball puts his body between the ball and the opponent. The shooter then releases the ball towards the basket with his outside hand in an arcing "hook" motion. The hook shot and variations such as the jump-hook and skyhook are effective because they are very difficult for the defender to block, although it is harder to hit the shot with precision. The advantage that a hook shot offers is the space between the offensive player and the defender, which can make defense more difficullt. The hook shot is most often used by post players, because it is difficult to make the shot from a distance. <a href="../../../k/a/r/Kareem_Abdul-Jabbar_2fd7.html" title="Kareem Abdul-Jabbar">Kareem Abdul-Jabbar</a> of the <a href="../../../m/i/l/Milwaukee_Bucks_51ef.html" title="Milwaukee Bucks">Milwaukee Bucks</a> and later of the <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles_Lakers_c195.html" title="Los Angeles Lakers">Los Angeles Lakers</a> was a great exponent of the skyhook.</p>

<p>When a player posts up, in order to shoot he has to turnaround to face the basket.

<p>A <a href="../../../f/a/d/Fade_away.html" title="Fade away">fade away</a> shot is a jump shot while jumping away from the basket. This makes it difficult for the defender to block the shot.
