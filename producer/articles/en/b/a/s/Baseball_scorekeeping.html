<p><b>Baseball scorekeeping</b> is a shorthand method to record all the details of a <a href="../../../b/a/s/Baseball.html" title="Baseball">baseball</a> game. A game's <a href="../../../o/f/f/Official_scorer.html" title="Official scorer">official scorer</a> will use this method, as will amateur scorers. The scorecard produced by the amateur scorer has no importance in the official record keeping of <a href="../../../b/a/s/Baseball_statistics.html" title="Baseball statistics">baseball statistics</a>, but is done for enjoyment. <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_Chadwick_4349.html" title="Henry Chadwick">Henry Chadwick</a> and, to a lesser extent, MJ Kelly are responsible for defining the foundations of this shorthand in the late 1800s.</p>
<p>A scorekeeper can track the result every play in a game, though most amateurs opt not to record some of the smaller details. Each <a href="../../../r/u/n/Run_%28baseball%29.html" title="Run (baseball)">run</a>, <a href="../../../h/i/t/Hit_%28baseball_statistics%29.html" title="Hit (baseball statistics)">hit</a>, <a href="../../../o/u/t/Out_%28baseball%29.html" title="Out (baseball)">out</a>, <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stolen_base.html" title="Stolen base">steal</a>, and even <a href="../../../p/i/t/Pitch_%28baseball%29.html" title="Pitch (baseball)">pitch</a> can be recorded.</p>
<p>There is no definitive system for scoring a baseball game, but the foundations are fairly universal. Many fans make modifications to the systems to suit their own tastes: some scorekeepers use none of these symbols, and others use all of them.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/s/Baseball_scorekeeping.html" title="Edit section: The scorecard">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The scorecard</span></h2>
<p>One scorecard is used to record the offensive play of one team and the defensive play of the other, so at least two scorecards are needed to record one game, one for the visiting team and one for the home team. During the top of an inning, when the visiting team is at bat and the home team in the field, the offensive accomplishments of the visiting team (hits, runs, and outs) and the defensive accomplishments (outs and how they occurred) of the home team are both recorded on the visiting scorecard. In the bottom of the inning, the home offense and visiting defense is recorded on the home scorecard.</p>
<p>On the left side, there is are columns to record <b>player information</b>: the names, <a href="../../../b/a/s/Baseball_positions.html" title="Baseball positions">positions</a>, and uniform numbers of the players. In the center is the <b>game information</b>: a grid of cells used to mark actions during the game. At the right and bottom are areas to record <b>game totals</b>. For one game, two scorecards are needed, one for each team.</p>
<p>The location of a hit is noted by a line drawn in its direction, emanating from home plate. This is especially important to a coach who wishes to track a hitter's tendencies.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/s/Baseball_scorekeeping.html" title="Edit section: Scoring the card">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Scoring the card</span></h2>
<p>Scoring a baseball game is done one at-bat at a time. Each cell in the <b>game information</b> contains the lifetime of an offensive player, from batter to runner, to an out, a run, or a stranded runner. While these notations follow a certain set of rules, the specific style varies from scorer to scorer.<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> For example, one scorer may record a base hit with the notation 1B along the right-bottom edge of the diamond while another might use a single horizontal line. There are many variations, but the important things (outs and runs) should be prominent when looking at a scorecard. It is important to know the number of each <a href="../../../b/a/s/Baseball_positions.html" title="Baseball positions">position</a> for recording putouts.</p>
<p><a name="Outs" id="Outs"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/s/Baseball_scorekeeping.html" title="Edit section: Outs">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Outs</span></h3>
<p>When an out is recorded, the combination of defensive players executing that out is recorded, and the out that this player represents is written in the middle of the diamond and circled.<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> For example:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>If a batter hits a ball on the ground to the shortstop, who throws the ball to the first baseman to force the first out, it would be noted on the scoresheet as <b>6-3</b>, with <b>6</b> for the shortstop and <b>3</b> for the first baseman. A <b>1</b> would be written and circled.</li>
<li>If the next batter hits a ball to the center fielder who catches it on the fly for the second out, it would be noted as <b>F8</b>, with <b>F</b> for <i>flyout</i> and <b>8</b> for the center fielder. A <b>2</b> would be written and circled.</li>
<li>If the following batter strikes out, it would be noted as <b>K,</b> with the <b>K</b> being the standard notation for a strikeout. If the batter did not swing at the third strike, a "backwards K" is traditionally used. A <b>3</b> would be written and circled and a slash should be drawn across the lower right corner to indicate the end of the inning.</li>
<li>If in another inning, a baserunner is caught stealing second base, the basepath between first and second is filled-in halfway, then ended with a short stroke perpendicular to the basepath. It is then noted <b>CS</b>, with some scorers adding the uniform number or batting position of the batter to indicate when the runner was put out. Then the out number is written and circled, and the defensive combination of the put out, normally <b>2-4</b> or <b>2-6</b> for a catcher-to-second-base play.</li>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/s/Baseball_scorekeeping.html" title="Edit section: Reaching Base">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Reaching Base</span></h3>
<p>If a batter reaches first base, either due to a walk, a hit, or an error, the basepath from home to first base is drawn, and the method described in the lower-righthand corner.<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> For example:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>If a batter gets a basehit, the basepath is drawn and <b>1B</b> is written below.</li>
<li>If a batter gets a walk, the basepath is drawn and <b>BB</b> is written below.</li>
<li>If the batter reaches base because the first baseman dropped the throw from the shortstop, the basepath is drawn and <b>E3</b> is written below.</li>
<li>If the batter hits a <i>triple</i> however, the basepaths from home to first, first to second, and second to third are all drawn, and <b>3B</b> is written in the <i>upper lefthand corner</i>. This change of position is done to indicate that the runner did not advance on another hit.</li>
</ul>
</dd>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/s/Baseball_scorekeeping.html" title="Edit section: Advancing">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Advancing</span></h3>
<p>When a runner advances due to a following batter, it can be noted by the batting position or the uniform number of the batter that advanced the runner. This kind of notation is not always done by amateur scorers, and there is a lot of variation.<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>

<li>If a runner on first is advanced to third base after the 4th batter, number 22, hits a single, either a <b>4</b> or <b>22</b> is written in the upper lefthand corner.</li>
<li>If a runner steals second while the 7th batter, number 32, is up to bat, <b>SB</b> followed by either a <b>7</b> or <b>32</b> is written in the upper righthand corner.</li>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/s/Baseball_scorekeeping.html" title="Edit section: Runs">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Runs</span></h3>
<p>In order to score a run, a runner must touch all 4 bases and cross all four basepaths, so the scorer draws a complete diamond and, usually, fills it in.

<p>When a substitution is made, a vertical line is drawn after the last at-bat for previous player, and the new player's name and number is written in the second line of the Player Information section. A notation of <b>PH</b> or <b>PR</b> should be made for pinch hit and pinch run situations.</p>

<p>After the ninth batter has batted, the record of the first batter should be noted in the same column. However, if more than nine batters bat in a single inning, the next column will be needed. Draw a diagonal line across the lower left hand corner, to indicate that the original column is being extended.</p>
<p>There are extra columns on a scoresheet that can be used if a game goes to extra innings, but if a game requires more columns, another scorecard will be needed for each team.</p>

<p>Some scorers also track balls, strikes, and foul balls during an at-bat, using a <b>B</b> for each ball, an <b>S</b> for each strike, and an <b>F</b> for each foul with two strikes.</p>
<p>After each half-inning, the total number of hits and runs can be noted at the bottom of the column. After the game, totals can be added up for each team and each batter.</p>

<p>Using this example scorecard, let's examine the Milwaukee Brewers' 1st inning of play:</p>
<ul>
<li>Leadoff hitter, #10 Ron Belliard (the Brewers' 2nd baseman) grounds the ball to the Giants' 3rd baseman (5), who fields the ball and throws it to 1st base (3) for the out. Thus the play is recorded as "5-3."
<ul>
<li>The notation ("3-2") in the lower right corner of the "Belliard:Inning 1 cell" indicates the pitch count at the time Belliard put the ball into play (3 balls, 2 strikes; a statistic that this particular scorekeeper got tired of keeping track of after the first inning).</li>
<li>There are a couple of widely used forms for keeping track of ball and strikes. One of the easiest formats is to use two rows, the first for balls and the second for strikes. As the pitches are delivered a B, S, or F records (respectively) balls, strikes, and two-strike foul balls. (Some pre-printed scoresheets have dedicated boxes that can be checked off for balls and strikes.) In the case of Belliard's at bat, the 3-2 count could have this appearance:</li>

<li>2nd (2nd spot or 2nd hole) batter, #9 Marquis Grissom (the Brewers' Center Fielder) on a 2-ball, 2-strike count grounds out 5-3 (3rd baseman to 1st baseman).</li>
<li>3rd batter, #5 Geoff Jenkins (the Brewers' Left Fielder) grounds the ball to the 1st baseman (3) who takes the ball to the base himself for an unassisted put out (3U).</li>
</ul>
<p>One hard and fast rule of baseball scorekeeping is that <i>every</i> out and <i>every</i> time a baserunner advances <b>must</b> be recorded. The scoring can get a little more complicated when a batter who has reached base, is then "moved up" (i.e. advanced a base or bases) by the actions of a hitter behind him, or as is the case in the Giants' first inning by his own subsequent actions. Let's examine the Giants' first inning:</p>
<ul>
<li>Leadoff hitter, #7 Marvin Bernard (the Giants' Center Fielder) hits a fly ball that is caught by the right fielder (9) for an out. Other scorekeepers might abbreviate this out using "F9" for fly out to right field.</li>
<li>2nd batter, #32 Bill Mueller (the Giants' 3rd baseman) hits a single, i.e., he hits the ball into play and makes it safely to first base. This is denoted by the single line running from "home" to "1st" next to the diamond in that cell. Commonly, scorekeepers will place some abbreviation, such as "1B-7", to designate a single hit to left field. In addition, many scorekeepers also place a line across the diamond to show the actual path of the baseball on the field.</li>
<li>3rd batter, #25 Barry Bonds (the Giants' <b>Left</b> Fielder; editor's note: yes, the scorekeeper was aware at the time that Bonds was playing left field, but accidentally put RF on his card) strikes out (K) on a 1-ball, 2-strike count (the 1-3 notation was this particular scorekeeper's method of indicating that Bonds struck out "looking", a practice the scorer has now become too lazy to continue). However, at some point during Bonds' at-bat, Bill Mueller, the runner on 1st base, stole 2nd base. His advancement was recorded in "his" cell by writing the notation "SB" next to the upper-right edge of the diamond.</li>
<li>4th batter (clean-up hitter), #21 Jeff Kent (the Giants' 2nd baseman) hit a fly ball that was caught by the Brewers' Right Fielder (9) for the 3rd and final out of the inning. Bill Mueller was stranded on 2nd base.</li>
</ul>
<p>Stranded baserunners might be notated as being "LOB" (Left On Base) for that inning, with a number from 1-3 likely at the bottom of the inning column. For example, if two runners are left on base after the 3rd out, the scorekeeper might note "LOB:2", then at the end of the game calculate a total number of LOB for the game.</p>
<p>For a more complicated inning, let us examine the bottom half of the 5th inning:</p>
<ul>
<li>5th batter, #6 J.T. (Jack Thomas) Snow (the #5 hitter in the Giants' lineup and coincidentally the son of LA Rams Pro-Bowl wide-receiver <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/SnowJa00.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/SnowJa00.htm" rel="nofollow">Jack Snow</a>) advances to first base on a walk (base-on-balls; BB).</li>
<li>6th batter, #23 Ellis Burks (the Giants' Right Fielder) grounds out 5-3 (3rd baseman to 1st baseman), but in the process, advances J.T. Snow to second base.</li>
<li>7th batter, #25 Rich Aurilia (the Giants' shortstop) flies out to the center fielder (8) for the second out of the inning.</li>
<li>8th batter, #29 Bobby Estalella (the Giants' catcher) draws a walk (BB) to advance to first base. J.T. Snow remains at 2nd base.</li>
<li>9th batter, #48 Russ Ortiz (the Giants' starting pitcher) hits a single (diagonal single line drawn next to the lower-right side of the diamond). J.T. Snow advances to home on that single (the diagonal line drawn next to the lower left side of the diamond in Snow's "cell") to score the game's only run. Ortiz is given credit for an RBI (run batted in), denoted by the "R" written in the bottom left corner of his cell (incorrectly, I might add, since "R" indicates a 'run scored' and would more appropriately been noted in JT Snow's cell. RBI could have been used, or a circled number representing the number of runs scored by that batter in that at-bat. The scorekeeper believes that he failed to add the BI because he was trying to prevent mustard from dripping on his shirt at the moment the run was scored. Some scorecards have a specific place to note RBI's). Bobby Estalella advances from 1st to 3rd base on Ortiz's single (the diagonal line drawn next to the upper left side of the diamond in Estalella's "cell").</li>
<li>Leadoff hitter, Marvin Bernard, up for the third time in this game, draws a walk (BB). Ortiz advances to 2nd base on that walk (the BB written on the "1st to 2nd" portion of the diamond in his "cell".</li>
<li>2nd hitter, Bill Mueller hits into a 6-4 (SS to 2nd baseman) "fielder's choice" for the third and final out of the inning. A "fielder's choice" is the situation where a player puts the ball into play, an out is recorded, but a different player than the hitter is put out. In this case, Marvin Bernard was "forced out" at 2nd base (surmised because it was the 2nd baseman who made the put-out). Had the shortstop thrown to first base to put out Mueller, it would have been a simple 6-3 ground out. But since the shortstop "chose" to get the out at 2nd base instead, it is a Fielder's Choice. Since this was the final out of the inning, no baserunners advanced.</li>
