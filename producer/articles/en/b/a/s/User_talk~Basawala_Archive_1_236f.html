<p>In response to your comment on my user page and the reverting of my edits, I did not make a biased claim or place inaccurate information on the <a href="../../../u/r/d/Urdu.html" title="Urdu">Urdu</a> page. I actually put the Grammar info in the article because Hindi and Urdu grammar are almost identical. It was not directly inserted in the article either. I edited the text before placing it in the article. The statement: "Sociolinguists also consider Urdu itself a variant of <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindi.html" title="Hindi">Hindi</a>" is a FACT and is taken directly off the Hindi page. Keep in mind, the subject of that sentence, 'SOCIOLINGUISTS'. Ethnologue also supports this statement. I also wrote the statement about vocabulary based on Hindi and Sanskrit being colloqial as well. Please do not revert my statements without discussing them beforehand. Thank you.</p>

<dd><a href="../../../b/a/s/User%7EBasawala_1ef6.html" title="User:Basawala">Basawala</a>, thanks for your concern on this issue. I just placed what I found and researched to be correct on the <a href="../../../u/r/d/Urdu.html" title="Urdu">Urdu</a> article. I have two sources for Urdu being a variant of <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindi.html" title="Hindi">Hindi</a>: (1) [<a href="http://www.ethnologue.org/14/show_language.asp?code=HND" class="external text" title="http://www.ethnologue.org/14/show_language.asp?code=HND" rel="nofollow">Ethnologue: Comments</a>] (2) [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindi#Sociolinguistics_of_Hindi" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindi#Sociolinguistics_of_Hindi" rel="nofollow">Sociolinguistics of Hindi</a>]. For the second issue regarding <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sanskrit.html" title="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a> loanwords in Urdu I, as native speaker of Urdu and Hindi, found there to be a significant amount of Sanskrit borrowings in the Urdu language, such as dant (tooth), dhuan (smoke), nakhun (fingernail), aag (fire), etc. Also, since 60% of Urdu uses vocabulary from Hindi, which is based on Sanskrit (as all Indo-Aryan/Indian origin languages are), one could deduce that Urdu would also have some Sansktrit borrowings. The same is true of <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persian.html" title="Persian">Persian</a> words in Urdu. Urdu is also based on Persian, which has a singificant amount of loanwords from Arabic. Hence, we can say that Urdu (which has a large number of borrowings from Persian) also has a significant amount of loanwords from Arabic. A source that I found hepls support this argument: [<a href="http://www.geocities.com/sikmirza/arabic/hindustani.html" class="external text" title="http://www.geocities.com/sikmirza/arabic/hindustani.html" rel="nofollow">Hindi-Urdu FAQ: What are the origins of Hindi and Urdu?</a>]. Thanks for not reverting the Urdu page. I also hope there will be another expert to help us. Thank you again for all your understanding in this matter. --Jdas0706:23, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Basawala???</span></h2>
<p>Um, the correct transliteration for "language person" from Devanagari is "Bhaashawaala" (spelled with the letter 'Bha' rather than 'Ba', and the 'madhyannah sha' rather than the 'danta sha'). "Basawala" is somebody who sells "Basas" (whatever they might be) for a living&#160;:) . To a native speaker of any North Indian language, 'Basawala' is hilarious.(<a href="../../../s/u/b/User%7ESubhash_bose_945d.html" title="User:Subhash bose">Netaji</a> 20:50, 1 July 2006 (UTC))</p>

<p>Thanks for pointing out a possible error in the spelling of my middle name. I replaced انوپام with اَنُپم Do you think that makes a better translation of my name in Urdu from the original अनुपम? If not could you please provide me with an accurate translation. Thanks Jdas07 00:28, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Thank you very much for taking the time to respond to my querey. It was really helpful and I changed my name (in the Urdu translation) to match my Hindi script with the translation you provided. Even though I know the Devanagari script a little better, I still have a great love for the Urdu script (my family is from Lucknow and I am a part of the Methodist Church, which has used Urdu as its language in India). However, I am able to speak both Urdu and Hindi very well. When I originally put my name in the Urdu script, I was slightly unsure about the translation so I verified it with someone else's. I even put my name in a Hindi to Urdu transliterator. That is how I got the vowel marks. I'm sorry I don't know how to get them on the Urdu keyboard. However, when I find out, I will let you know. Thanks also for the insight on the alif ا and the alif madd آ. That was also very helpful and much appreciated. Thank you once again for all your help. -Jdas07 07:20, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Re:Hateful comments</span></h2>
<p>Hi Basawala - I saw your comments on Anonymous editor's talkpage. You should not do anything, becoz a person's views are his/her own to hold. The only thing Subhash Bose did wrong was to discuss his personal views here - Wikipedia user and talkpages aren't to discuss non-Wikipedia business. I could be mistaken in that Subhash's comments were probably a deviation during a discussion about article content. <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERama%27s_Arrow_544a.html" title="User:Rama's Arrow"><font color="blue"><b>Rama's arrow</b></font></a> 13:08, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>No, I am indeed sorry but Bose's comments are a criticism of a religion, not a personal attack - it is a sensitive thing to say, but its his right. Only thing is, Wikipedia is not for passing judgment on issues, so its "non-Wikipedia business," unless it concerned some article's content.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Hindi movies</span></h2>
<p>Thanks Basawala! While you were on your Wikibreak in the summer, I was actually thinking of asking you to add Hindi and Urdu translations of the Bollywood films since you do such a great job. I also thought "translation" would be better than "English" because the movie title isn't in English but Hindi/Urdu. I really appreciate your help in contributions (and your help and suggestions before your wikibreak as well). I also think its great you are working with <a href="../../../k/i/t/User%7EKitabparast_98b3.html" title="User:Kitabparast">Kitabparast</a> on many Hindustani related articles. He is very knowledgeable in the subject and is a very altruistic person. Khuda Hafiz. Jdas07 01:20, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Salaam Basawala! You did a great job of creating the <a href="../../../u/r/d/Urdu_alphabet.html" title="Urdu alphabet">Urdu alphabet</a> article. It is very comprehensive and is thorough in describing the Urdu script. Could you please tell me the differences between the <a href="../../../n/a/s/Nasta%27liq_script.html" title="Nasta'liq script">Nasta'liq script</a> and the <a href="../../../u/r/d/Urdu_alphabet.html" title="Urdu alphabet">Urdu script</a>? I was wondering about this earlier. From my new understanding, the Urdu script is a variant to the Nasta'liq script which is in turn a variant of the Perseo-Arabic script. Is this correct? Thanks again. Khuda Hafiz. Jdas07 05:04, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for your response! It did indeed help. I am wondering if you could make more mention of <a href="../../../n/a/s/Nasta%27liq.html" title="Nasta'liq">Nasta'liq</a> on the <a href="../../../u/r/d/Urdu_alphabet.html" title="Urdu alphabet">Urdu alphabet</a> article since it is the preferred style for writing <a href="../../../u/r/d/Urdu.html" title="Urdu">Urdu</a>.

<p>It's a term used to define the proposed North American Union.</p>
<p>Why do you want to delete this information?</p>
<p>I've requested some people who are more expert in the matter to expand the article.</p>
<p>It is very suspicious that first North American Union was deleted and locked, and now American Union is at risk for deletion.</p>
<p>Is there a reason you don't want information about this to get out to the public?</p>
<hr />
<p>I've requested experts to add information to the entry for American Union.</p>
<p>You say the exact term is not at Google--you're not correct.

<p>Thanks for your comment. I know the difference between Urdu and Persian, and usually, a Persian-speaker does not understand Urdu. In this case, however, the entire lyrics is deffinitly Persian, totally understandable for a Persian-speaker, and that one little Hindustani word was integrated because of poetical devices.</p>
<p>It's deffinitly more correct to say that the lyrics is in Persian than in Urdu - just compare it to other "normal" Urdu songs and texts.</p>
<p>However, it you want to name it Urdu, then you have to explain that it is extremely Persianized, to an extent, that it is totally understandable for a Persian-speaker, while it might be difficult for a native Urdu-speaker.</p>
<p>The best solution would probably be calling it both Persian and Urdu.</p>
<p>For now, I will revert it back to the "Persian" version. Maybe you can find a better solution.</p>
<p>PS: the pronounciation of "a" is not really a reason to call it Urdu. In Iran, for example, they pronounce the "a" like a "u" or "o". They say "Iroon" instead of "Iran", "joon" instead of "jaan". It's a matter of regional dialects, not that of the entire language.</p>
