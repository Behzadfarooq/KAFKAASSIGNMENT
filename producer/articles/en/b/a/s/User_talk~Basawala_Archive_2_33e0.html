<p>Regarding your last address to me on <a href="../../../b/a/j/Talk%7EBajrang_Dal_a5c6.html" title="Talk:Bajrang Dal">Talk:Bajrang Dal</a> you seem very agitated and seem to show certain tendencies to belive that the editors involved are trying to work against you and have a bias. Nothing could be further from the truth. Don't get so annoyed. Bear in mind that the foundation of your edits have been retained on account of satisfying verifiability. Some of your details are from unreliable sources, that is all. I'm sure that, if you regard those tall tales as truth, then you can find Multiple Sources to that effect, can't you? Surely a non-partisan org has published something. The fact that you can;t find one should invite you to some introspection.<a href="../../../h/k/e/User%7EHkelkar_b268.html" title="User:Hkelkar">Hkelkar</a> 02:03, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, making controversial edits is great, but it seemed to me like he was just trolling at some places (eg. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Eurabia&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=74786916" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Eurabia&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=74786916" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, claiming all the major US news media is "far-right" isn't helpful to anyone). And like you said he did break the 3rr on at least three different articles in an hour. If your problem is the template I used on his talk page, I'll try to find a more specific one in the future, thanks. - <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobet_31bb.html" title="User:Bobet">Bobet</a> 08:32, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>YOu keep reverting sourced edits articles like <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kancha_Ilaiah_e7d5.html" title="Kancha Ilaiah">Kancha Ilaiah</a> that point to his rhetoric as being anti-Hindu (even by muslims) and <a href="../../../d/a/l/Dalitstan.html" title="Dalitstan">Dalitstan</a> as not being an anti-Hindu org when it so clearly is. Your OR doesn;t count as I point to the article on wikipedia about jewwatch.com, another similar hate-site. It is listed on wikipedia as a hate site even though the site itself repeatedly insists that it is not an antisemitic hate site.<a href="../../../h/k/e/User%7EHkelkar_b268.html" title="User:Hkelkar">Hkelkar</a> 20:15, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You are exaggerating my edits. It is really irrelevant to say that the critics of Kancha Ilaiah are both Hindu and Muslim, after all, Kancha Ilaiah is a Dalit and not related to Islam, so what are you suggesting by vying for 4 words <i>"both Hindu and Muslim"</i>. You bring jewwatch into question here, but I have no clue what that is and how its supposed to affect me, so that's a really original accusation. And how is Dalistan <i>cleary anti-Hindu</i>? It's critical of Hindu society, but that's as far as it really goes. And I even kept Dalitstan's article that way, since I knew others would revert it back, and I only posted on the talk page. It seems that you are really trying to attack and undermine me with very limited basis. <a href="../../../b/a/s/User%7EBasawala_1ef6.html" title="User:Basawala"><font color="forestgreen"><b>Mar de Sin</b></font></a> <a href="../../../b/a/s/User_talk%7EBasawala_bd91.html" title="User talk:Basawala"><font color="navy"><sup><b>Talk to me!</b></sup></font></a> 20:29, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Hindi and Urdu scripts</span></h2>
<p>Thanks for your input on the scripts. Even though I am able to speak Urdu and Hindi, I am learning the scripts and have been using software for some of the edits. I will take your advice on this though. Your removal of Devanagari scripts from Pakistani films was justified for the reasons you gave. However, for Indo-Muslim articles such as <a href="../../../s/a/w/Sawm.html" title="Sawm">Sawm</a> and <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chand_Raat_660d.html" title="Chand Raat">Chand Raat</a>, I feel it is appropriate to use Devanagari scripts as well. Though many Indian Muslims speak Urdu, they may be unable to write it (especially the younger generation). Instead, they use the more widely accepted Devanagari script. This is because the Urdu script is not taught in most public schools in India and many Indian Muslim youth do not learn it unless they receive private tutoring or go to a madrasah. I personally know cases like this. In light of these facts, I think it would be appropriate to retain Devanagari on these articles. Thanks for your understanding.

<dd>Thanks for your prompt reply! According to the article, "Many historians believe that the Brahmi script and the subsequent Indic alphabets are derived from this script as well, which would make it the ancestor of almost all major writing systems in use today..." Maybe we could try Devanagari as the script is used in quite a few Indo-European languages? Let me know what you think!

<dd>Thanks for the information. It really helped. I see your point that all the writing systems in the chart were abjad. I didn't notice that the statement about Indic scripts was unsourced. Originally, I thought giving an example of an Indic script would be a good idea. However you made several well thought out assertions. I'll leave it up to you to add/fix the Devanagari or remove it. Thanks for all your help! Also, thanks for your support in the <a href="../../../a/b/r/Talk%7EAbrar-ul-Haq_bfcb.html" title="Talk:Abrar-ul-Haq">Talk:Abrar-ul-Haq</a> discussion.

<dd>I cant remember (m)any other instance of me using 'damn' and that too I have used it only against mw. that is not because he holds an <i>opinion</i> different from mine, but because he is downright incivil and whats worse, neither has he mended his ways in spite of several request by several others in the past <b>nor has</b> <i>any</i> <b>of the admins taken</b> <i>any</i> <b>action against him or so much as even adviced him to refrain from using that word and hurting people. I didnt use the word 'damn' the first time he used that word. My first request to him was polite, later it was stern(not incivil) and I even pleaded my case on Admin:Sundar and admin:Blguyen's pages. On Aksi Great's talk page too.</b></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>While he was pulled up for his zillion other offences(which included other instances of incivility), he was <b>never</b> pulled up for this. that is what has fuelled my angst. If you admins want everyone to remain sane, you need to put down incivility like mahawiki's with an iron fist. WP is not a course in Anger Management(like the movie) where you give incivil people like mahawiki a long long leash and test at what point the victims might turn incivil themselves. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarvagnya_680d.html" title="User:Sarvagnya">Sarvagnya</a> 20:43, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>I need to give you some background. It all started with a content dispute on <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belgaum.html" title="Belgaum">Belgaum</a>. Mahawiki called for AMA. But before AMA could arrive, Aksi Great arrived and brokered a truce which lasted all of 48 hours and it was back to square one. He called out for AMA again. The AMA(<a href="../../../a/m/e/User%7EAmerique_6b89.html" title="User:Amerique">User:Amerique</a>) arrived and long drawn arguments ensued in his presence. And even with his own advocate mediating, Mahawiki slipped back into his old uncivil ways. So much so, that I abruptly withdrew from the debate and so did User:Amerique. User:Amerique stayed off for a couple of days and then while giving his opinion on the debate, he told Mahawiki that he felt that he(mahawiki) should apologise to people he had hurt(me, dinesh etc.. - if u insist i will take the trouble of digging up the link for this for you). No apology was ever tendered.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Infact, the uncouth behaviour continued. Admin:Blnguyen who was somehow observing all this, stepped in and blocked mahawiki for 6 hours. He responded with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Bakasuprman#Kannada_vs_Hindi" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Bakasuprman#Kannada_vs_Hindi" rel="nofollow">this</a>. Unless, my eyes are cheating me, he seems to have called Admin:Blnguyen a 'nut'! for being partial to 'vandalisers'(sic) like me!!(p.s: I saw this just now, a few minutes ago).</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Even after that, his uncivil behaviour hasnt stopped. I have given an account of all that to Blnguyen <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Blnguyen/Archive24#Mahawiki" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Blnguyen/Archive24#Mahawiki" rel="nofollow">here</a>.

</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>After that, he was away for a couple of days. Then, he inexplicably landed on the <a href="../../../k/a/v/Kaveri.html" title="Kaveri">Kaveri</a> page I was editing and started a frivolous content dispute. You can check the talk page there.</li>

<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;I dont give a damn what Maratis call Kannadigas or what is written on Marati wikipedia. This is english wikipedia and the only right term to use is the native term. Using your own hoary term is like using angrezi/ angrez/ firang/ firangi etc., to refer to English speaking people on Wikipedia. And dont hide behind meaningless google hits which only maratis can read. Interestingly, google also gives a hit for Chatripati Shivaji. So right, Chatripati Shivaji(wow.. the name sounds so coooool), he is and will be from now on&lt;&lt;&lt; Now u see how civil and sane person he is.He just wants get me blocked so that he can continue his Kannadi POV imposition everywhere. Plz ask him to stop abusing Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj.He is also deleting my msgs on his talk page.<a href="../../../m/a/h/User%7EMahawiki_4ad2.html" title="User:Mahawiki">mahawiki</a> 07:26, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello! Thanks for ur answers.Just hope the admin comes back of wikibreak soon and look into the matter.More nice if Sarvagnya stops his incivil behavior.If it doesnt happen,I will approach to the link u mentioned. Perhaps he has undeleted it himself,as he gave me the link today and its working.I and another editor at <a href="../../../k/a/v/Kaveri.html" title="Kaveri">Kaveri</a> was unable to find it yesterday. Thanks. <a href="../../../m/a/h/User%7EMahawiki_4ad2.html" title="User:Mahawiki">Mahawiki</a> 16:46, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Its amazing to what lengths mahawiki will go to slander me. That I deleted the <a href="../../../k/a/v/Kaveri_River_Water_Dispute_a09a.html" title="Kaveri River Water Dispute">Kaveri_River_Water_Dispute</a> page and then undeleted it myself is the most ridiculous thing I have heard from him so far.

<p>Me slandering u???U r being on mission of <i>kill mahawiki</i> since a week. If u look at the talk page of <a href="../../../k/a/v/Kaveri.html" title="Kaveri">kaveri</a> u will find that a user,Bostonma was himself not able to find that article and so do i and hence I thought it is being deleted.I request Sarvagnya stop his bitching and dont assume that a newbie should know each and everything about deletion and undeletion.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yet then a point needs to be clarified...why didnt u give the link of that article when the user was asking it??u were giving responses like I am working on it etc etc...was that to save the embarassment since that article contains Kannadi POV?</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Pl. try to understand the difference in self-study and study of one's own self.</span></h2>
<p>Dear Mr.Basawala,</p>
<p>Every time when I write the meaning of Swadhyay as study of one's own self, somebody corrects it as self-study. This time I could see, you have done so.</p>
<p>Dear Mr.Basawala, there is difference in meaning of self-study and study of one's self. Self-study meaning could be vague that a person studying alone in any subject. Where as Study of one's own self is answers to questions like "Who am I?" "Who is my creator?" "What is my relationship with other objects of the world and space?", "Who is creator of the world, sun, moon etc?"</p>
<p>"Swadhyay" is a Sanskrut word. It's origin can be seen in Taiteriy Upnishad" and "Srimad Bhagwad Geeta". The word "Swadhyay" has a specific meaning. If you are a Mohmedian, let me give you an example. I may feel "Namaj" means bowing down to Almighty but The Word "Namaj" may have the different connotation, it may have very deep sense than I could perceive. Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, the correct connotation of an important word should be allowed to the viewer. By your edits of meaning of "Swadhyay" as self-study, you are depriving the viewers of sacrosanct meaning of "Swadhyay".</p>
<p>I hope you will understand my view-points and stop editing the meaning given here. I had written a rough article but somebody removed it. I am going to re-write after obtaining some information.</p>

<p>First, pl. accept my apologies if there is any difference in Muslims and Mohamedians, in particular if the later term is offensive.</p>
<p>I would like to understand how this term is offensive as I have seen this term being used in number of writings. Are you from India?</p>
<p>After writing my comments on your page, I too was confused as probably you had not changed the meaning of "Swadhyay" to Self-Study from Study of one's self. However, I am not able to make out whether someone could change and yet it could not reflect in history?</p>
<p>Thanks to let me know that the term Mohammdian may be felt offensive to someone.</p>

<dd>Rural people's knowledge of Chinese characters were very basic, and Chinese characters are not phonetic and also the time was before the invention of Zhuyin Fuhao and Hanyu Pinyin, so people relied on their knowledge of Arabic and Persian alphabets and used Xiao'erjing. But in recent years, education of Chinese characters improved and Hanyu Pinyin is implemented in the education system, there is less need for Xiao'erjing. Most people's knowledge of Arabic and Persian is passive at best, so the tendency for someone to use Xiao'erjing instead of Chinese characters or Hanyu Pinyin is very low. The usage of Xiao'erjing becomes very very limited, and mostly limited to the older generation using it on a personal level. The younger generation may know of it's existence but they can only learn it from their parents or grandparents. There are also plenty of inexpensive dictionaries and reading material in Chinese characters for the people to buy or read. These are some of the reasons why Xiao'erjing is nearing extinction. --<a href="../../../../zh/s/h/i/User_talk%7EShibo77_2383.html" class="extiw" title="zh:User_talk:Shibo77">Shibo77</a> 10:51, 29 September 2006 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Comments from Sarvagnya</span></h2>
<p>Hi dear Admin,</p>
<p>This is to bring to your notice the wiki-feud I've been having with <a href="../../../m/a/h/User%7EMahawiki_4ad2.html" title="User:Mahawiki">User:Mahawiki</a> for almost one month now. It started with the <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belgaum.html" title="Belgaum">Belgaum</a> page which went to mediation, warnings were handed out to both parties, and when Mahawiki's incivil ways continued, Admin:Bluyugen handed him a warning and then a block. Find that <a href="../../../m/a/h/User_talk%7EMahawiki_Archive_Archive_01_07f6.html#Remain_civil" title="User talk:Mahawiki/Archive/Archive 01">here</a>.</p>
<p>I do not want to turn the clock back and go through all those content disputes again. Infact, I dont want to present to you the details of <b>any content dispute</b> we've had. All I want to present to you is the brazen incivility and personal attacks being committed by <a href="../../../m/a/h/User%7EMahawiki_4ad2.html" title="User:Mahawiki">User:Mahawiki</a> either in the course of his content disputes or even simply just out of spite.</p>
<p>All the diffs(exhibiting his incivility and personal attacks) I provide below are from <b>AFTER, <u>I REPEAT, "AFTER"</u>. ADMIN BLUGYUEN INTERVENED, WARNED ALL OF US, AND HANDED MAHAWIKI A BLOCK.</b></p>
<p>Please find below dozens of instances of blatant incivility and personal attacks by <a href="../../../m/a/h/User%7EMahawiki_4ad2.html" title="User:Mahawiki">User:Mahawiki</a> either on me or on <a href="../../../d/i/n/User%7EDineshkannambadi_c09f.html" title="User:Dineshkannambadi">User:Dineshkannambadi</a> and all <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kannadiga.html" title="Kannadiga">Kannadigas</a> in general. His remarks are in extremely bad taste and counterproductive resulting in undermining of the good faith efforts of the other editors to carry on editing their articles.</p>
<p>While I dont want to go into each and every diff and explain it, just to give you a sample of his incivility, he has made edits where, even if only in jest or sarcasm, he makes atrocious claims like, I am on a <i><b>kill Mahawiki</b></i> mission, that User:Dineshkannambadi is the <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kannada.html" title="Kannada">Kannada</a> (Bin) Laden(sic). In another edit, even if only for jest(which I certainly dont find amusing nor appreciate esp., when it comes from him), he has threatened to <b>sue me</b>. He has called us <i>cultural</i> <b>TERRORISTS</b>, losers, notorious, shameless etc., etc. He uses the word vandalism like one would use 'Hi' and 'Hello'.</p>
<p>Find all the above and much much much more in the diffs I've provided below. <b>Whats worse is his antics are going unchecked because Admin:Blugyen who knows about our feud is on a wikibreak and Admin:Sundar whose intervention I've sought more than once, is busy with other things(I presume, in real life) - which ofcourse, I dont hold against either of them.</b></p>
<p>But wikipedia will be a poorer place if brazen incivility like this goes unchecked for weeks simply because many admins dont know about it or the ones who know are by force of circumstances, too busy to deal with it.</p>
<p>I request immediate and harsh action on Mahawiki.</p>
<p>Once again, let me remind everyone that in the links below, <b>none</b> of them pertain to any content disputes. I belive in dealing with the content disputes on the relevant talk pages and dont usually bring it out on user talk pages.</p>
<p>Infact, I have even not listed below, the atrocious claim he made a couple of days ago that I had <b>deleted and later undeleted</b> an article. Also not listed below is his blatant removal of {{fact}} tags I had added in a couple of articles without even clarifying or providing a citation for the claim which I had tagged. Also not listed below may be umpteen other instances of incivility and npa violations on his part that I might have missed.</p>
<p><b>All the diffs</b> below deal <b>purely and only</b> with his brazen incivil comments and personal attacks not just on me, but on User:Dineshkannambadi and also highly respected historians like Mr. Suryanath Kamath et al(who have been cited in some articles by Dinesh) whom he has trashed and dismissed in the most uncivil manner possible.</p>
<p>Apart from this he also makes disparaging remarks on <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karnataka.html" title="Karnataka">Karnataka</a> and <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karnataka.html" title="Karnataka">Karnataka</a> politicians who he keeps claiming are oppressing and torturing <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marathi.html" title="Marathi">Marathi</a> speaking people in <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belgaum.html" title="Belgaum">Belgaum</a>. This is not a content dispute, this is plain nonsense and insanely belligerent language.</p>
<p>His incivility apart, he has made it a habit and a routine to go around all over wikipedia branding me and Dinesh as 'Kannadi' vandals bent on <i>Kannadizing</i> all articles we touch. Ask him if we have included any uncited material or if we has ever cited any references for his numerous claims or whether he has taken it up on the article talk page instead of on a random user talk page. His answer will be negative. And yet, that doesnt stop him from going around shouting that we have been vandalising articles!!</p>
<p>Anway, I dont want to veer this towards the 'content disputes' which is a whole different matter altogether. Content disputes can always be discussed and agreements reached. Let me present to you just his brazen incivility and personal attacks.</p>
<p>Here we go -</p>
