<p>Thanks for removing that part again. It's not as if the talk page discussion on it was hard to find.&#160;;-) Hopefully, we won't have to revert it too many more times. Thanks for letting me know about your changes to the article; I hadn't seen it right off hand on my watchlist (it has over 500 pages on it at present, so sometimes I miss individual changes). I'll keep watching the article to see if it comes back. --<a href="../../../i/d/o/User%7EIdont_havaname_acde.html" title="User:Idont havaname">Idont Havaname</a> 03:51, 10 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Actually, it's pretty rare that I put pages up for AfD. I haven't been participating on there nearly as much lately as I have in the past, though I do still try to contribute often to discussions about changing AfD (e.g. <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_reform_5862.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion reform">Wikipedia:Deletion reform</a>). In my view, Dan Hoyt probably deserves his own article since he's had a fairly good amount of news coverage; I'd say weak keep in an AfD for that article. As for the main <a href="../../../a/s/i/Asian_fetish.html" title="Asian fetish">Asian fetish</a> article, I've thought several times about AfDing it (List of ethnic stereotypes attracted a lot of different editors, but it was deleted as inherently POV / not citing its sources, which is the problem Asian fetish has), but I've tried to stay optimistic that it would turn into a well-written, well-cited, NPOV article. --<a href="../../../i/d/o/User%7EIdont_havaname_acde.html" title="User:Idont havaname">Idont Havaname</a> 04:06, 10 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>I think that stereotype regarding "weaker" white men is probably common, but it certainly does need one or more scholarly references, as does everything else in the article, if it wants to stay. Personally, I've seen some Asians using this stereotype and others not. And there may be some truth to saying that white women reject the geeky guys before they get their jobs and get rich, but I would say that the term "who <i>settle for</i> Asian women because white women reject them" is definitely author's POV. "Settle for" is used more by people gossiping about their relatives; it should stay out of an encyclopedia article. You're every bit right in raising a criticism about that remark in the article; I'd say the article could use to explain some of the reasons behind that stereotype. (maybe it could start by mentioning Asians' usually higher emphasis on education and college degrees) --<a href="../../../i/d/o/User%7EIdont_havaname_acde.html" title="User:Idont havaname">Idont Havaname</a> 05:13, 10 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you haven't seen already, I nominated the Asian fetish article at <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticle_Improvement_Drive_cef6.html" title="Wikipedia:Article Improvement Drive">Wikipedia:Article Improvement Drive</a>. After an comment war took place over there between myself and an anonymous editor, the probability that the AID will be effective has most likely dropped off. Since you have taken some interest in trying to improve the article in the past, I would like to encourage you to help regain a level of professionalism at the AID page with your supporting vote. Thank you. --<a href="../../../h/o/w/User%7EHowrealisreal_0e4e.html" title="User:Howrealisreal">Howrealisreal</a> 13:15, 12 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>In general, yes, especially for images that don't fall into one of the blanket categories for which we have a specialized template (logo, movie poster, etc.). A "fair use rationale" that explains how the image meets those four criteria is needed to ensure that our use is indeed fair. See <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_description_page_4215.html#Fair_use_rationale" title="Wikipedia:Image description page">Wikipedia:Image description page#Fair_use_rationale</a> for examples.

<dd>thinking about it, we don't have any excuse to use these commercial images as it is only fair use if you can't get a photo yourself or it is a non reproducable important event. As it is physically possible to take photos of actors at premieres and festivals I don't think we can claim fair use for any of these images. Arniep 21:33, 28 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Bash. Just wanted to point out that tagging a photo as {{<a href="../../../n/o/_/Template%7ENo_source_a38c.html" title="Template:No source">no source</a>}} might be easier than listing it for deletion at <a href="../../../i/f/d/WP%7EIFD_bb01.html" title="WP:IFD">WP:IFD</a>. After a week, if the uploader hasn't provided the source, the photo can be speedy deleted. (To make the deletion happen quicker, you can add {{<a href="../../../d/b/_/Template%7EDb_645c.html" title="Template:Db">db</a>|no source for more than a week}}, but it's not required.)
