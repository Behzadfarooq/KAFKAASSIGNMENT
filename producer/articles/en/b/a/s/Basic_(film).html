<p>A helicopter circles over the <a href="../../../p/a/n/Panama.html" title="Panama">Panamanian</a> jungle. On board is a team of <a href="../../../a/r/m/Army_Ranger_509c.html" title="Army Ranger">Army Ranger</a> trainees, and their commander, Sergeant Nathan West (<a href="../../../s/a/m/Samuel_L._Jackson_663e.html" title="Samuel L. Jackson">Samuel L. Jackson</a>). The team consists of six trainees: Pike, Dunbar, Kendall, Mueller, Nuñez, and Castro. Their objective is to move through the jungle while a hurricane rages above, use live fire to hit targets, then rendezvous at a small shanty, where West will be waiting for them.</p>
<p>Seventeen hours later, Dunbar emerges from the jungle carrying a wounded Kendall on his back. He exchanges fire with Mueller, killing him, before being picked up by another military helicopter. Apparently, the mission has gone horribly wrong. The rest of the team, and West, are presumed dead.</p>
<p>Back at the base interrogation room, Captain Julia Osborne (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Connie_Nielsen_2d11.html" title="Connie Nielsen">Connie Nielsen</a>) makes little headway with Dunbar, who refuses to talk. Dunbar insists on speaking to a fellow Ranger from outside the base, and draws a mysterious "8" on a piece of paper. Upon seeing the 8, base commander Bill Styles (<a href="../../../t/i/m/Timothy_Daly_498f.html" title="Timothy Daly">Timothy Daly</a>) calls in an experienced interrogator and friend, Tom Hardy, (<a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Travolta_d5f5.html" title="John Travolta">John Travolta</a>) an ex-Ranger and a DEA (Drug Enforcement Agency) investigator, albeit one under suspicion of corruption. Hardy and Osborne, initially wary of each other, are forced to work together in a 6-hour time limit - the CID from Washington will arrive to take Dunbar and Kendall away and initiate an investigation. Styles does not want people "swarming over them like ants" for this affair.</p>
<p>Shortly after arriving, Osborne witnesses Styles taking Hardy aside for a private conversation. The nature of this conversation is not revealed. Hardy begins to work on Dunbar:</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/s/Basic_%28film%29.html" title="Edit section: Dunbar's Story">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Dunbar's Story</span></h3>
<p>Sergeant West was famous for being tough-as-nails and hated by his cadets. One cadet in Dunbar's unit, a black man named Pike, earned West's wrath more than any other.</p>
<p>Pike was selected for the Panama training mission, along with Dunbar, Kendall, Mueller, Nuñez, and Castro, immediately after they returned from a grueling hike. Since he seemed to have plenty of reason to hate West, it is suggested that Pike might have had a murderous motive.</p>
<p>At this point, Dunbar refuses to say anything more.</p>
<p><a name="Kendall.27s_Story" id="Kendall.27s_Story"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/s/Basic_%28film%29.html" title="Edit section: Kendall's Story">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Kendall's Story</span></h3>
<p>Hardy and Osborne then go to the other surviving team member, Kendall, who is in the hospital. At the hospital, Hardy meets up with Dr. Peter Vilmer (<a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_Connick_Jr._1dcf.html" title="Harry Connick Jr.">Harry Connick Jr.</a>), an old friend. Apparently, Vilmer is also Osborne's on-again, off-again lover.</p>
<p>Kendall is the son of an influential general. It is revealed that he is <a href="../../../g/a/y/Gay.html" title="Gay">gay</a>. He tells Hardy and Osborne that West always hated him. In the helicopter, shortly before the mission, Kendall began fearing that West might try to kill him while they were in the jungle below.</p>
<p>In the jungle, Kendall claims Pike killed West with a phosphorus <a href="../../../g/r/e/Grenade.html" title="Grenade">grenade</a>, freely admitting to the rest of the team his actions when he showed up at the rendezvous bunker. He had hoped the rest of the team would sympathize. However, the team decided to turn Pike in when they would be picked up the next morning. In the middle of the night, Pike tried to rouse Kendall's sympathies by playing to their mutual hatred of West. Pike proposed they kill Nuñez and Castro, saying Mueller and Dunbar would be easy to convince to side with them. Kendall dismissed Pike, then went back to his sleeping area, but later spotted Pike whispering to Dunbar.</p>
<p>According to Kendall, Dunbar then went back to his bag, extracted his pistol, and aimed at Mueller. Kendall warned him, Mueller deviated the shot which killed Castro. A firefight ensued, in which most of the team was killed and Kendall shot. Dunbar then carried the wounded Kendall on his back through the jungle, exchanged fire with Mueller, and was picked up, as seen in the beginning of the movie. When asked why Dunbar would go through all the trouble of taking Kendall out of the firefight when Kendall had witnessed what had transpired, Kendall suggested that perhaps Dunbar expected Kendall to cover for him in gratitude.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/s/Basic_%28film%29.html" title="Edit section: Dunbar's Second Story">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Dunbar's Second Story</span></h3>
<p>Dunbar, upon further questioning, says that Kendall is lying. He claims that Mueller and Kendall were taking illegal steroid cocktails, and that it was Mueller that shot Sergeant West, then detonated Pike's grenade, which he had stolen. He then tried to pin blame for the murder on Pike. However, when Pike began pointing out evidence that threw suspicion on Mueller, a fierce argument began, Mueller shot Pike, and all hell broke loose. Dunbar rescued Kendall with the intent of turning him in, hiked through the jungle, and was picked up by the helicopter.</p>
<p>Osborne is also uneasy when she learns that Hardy once trained under West and hates him almost as passionately as his current recruits. However, Hardy proves to be an excellent interrogator, as he corners both Dunbar and Kendall for what really happened in the jungle. With time running out, Hardy and Osborne call a temporary, if uneasy, truce. Hardy cajoles a confession out of Dunbar, who claims that Sgt. West and the missing Rangers have been murdered and their bodies blown away by the hurricane. He also reveals that it was Vilmer who supplied steroids and drugs to Mueller and Kendall. Hardy is initially doubtful, thinking that Dunbar may be trying to use the knowledge of Hardy's role as a DEA agent to sell a story, however Dunbar produces a needle containing the steroid cocktail that he had hidden on his body as proof of his story.</p>

<p>When Osbourne and Hardy return to the hospital, they speak briefly with Dr. Vilmer. After a short - and illegally brutal - interrogation, he admits that he provided Mueller and Kendall, who also pushed the drugs for him, steroid cocktails, and would switch their urine during drug tests he himself administered. Vilmer is placed under arrest.</p>

<p>Hardy and Osborne then go to confront Kendall, who refuses to give them any useful information and insists that Dunbar is the guilty one. Suddenly, Kendall starts vomiting blood and dies. However, right before Kendall dies, he uses his blood to draw an "8" on Osborne's hand. She shows this to Hardy, who first denies knowing what the 8 may symbolise, then, under pressure, he takes her aside and explains the conversation he had earlier with Styles. There is rumored to be a vicious group of rogue Rangers trained under West who turned and started dealing drugs, calling themselves Section 8. (After the part of the military code where a soldier can be dismissed from service for reasons of insanity).</p>
<p>Styles, incensed with Osborne and Hardy's tactics in interrogating Vilmer, relieves them of duty. Dunbar and Vilmer will be shortly flown away on the transport plane that has arrived from the U.S. so that they will face a court martial, and the investigation is closed.</p>
<p>Hardy and Osborne go to release Vilmer to transport. At one point, Vilmer remarks in an offhand manner that he will be sharing the same plane back to Washington as Pike. Hardy corrects him, saying that he'll be on the same plane as <i>Dunbar,</i> but Vilmer persists - Dunbar, he says, is black. This means that the "Dunbar" Hardy and Osborne have been questioning is in fact Pike, the man whom West so hated during training. Since the military dog tags don't list race, all Pike had to do was switch his tags with Dunbar's in order to throw off the local authorities, then disappear after being transported for trial. Hardy and Osborne rush back to the base just as Pike is being taken onto a transport plane. Hardy grabs Pike and holds his face dangerously close to the plane's whirling propeller. The two engage in a brief screaming match, although what they say is inaudible to anyone just a few feet away. Afterwards, Hardy leads Pike away to a third round of interrogations.</p>
<p><a name="Pike.27s_.28.22Dunbar.27s.22.29_Third_Story" id="Pike.27s_.28.22Dunbar.27s.22.29_Third_Story"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/s/Basic_%28film%29.html" title="Edit section: Pike's (&quot;Dunbar's&quot;) Third Story">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Pike's ("Dunbar's") Third Story</span></h3>
<p>In Pike's new story, West was not shot, but had figured out the drug plot also involving cocaine smuggling by Vilmer, and showed up at the rendezvous bunker confronting the team. He tells the team that he had his suspicions but chose not to go to Colonel Styles until he knew for sure, and that he would turn them in to authorities in the morning. West kills Castro and a <a href="../../../m/e/x/Mexican_standoff.html" title="Mexican standoff">Mexican standoff</a> ensues. West then escapes the bunker. Nuñez chases after him, and gets shot. After some time, in the jungle where everybody went to look for West, Pike finds Dunbar dead, West shoots Kendall, wounding him, and tries to convince Pike to give himself up. Mueller manages to kill West. Pike shoots at Mueller, and then, knowing that he would be blamed if West died, took Dunbar's dog tags. He managed to escape, carrying Kendall through the jungle, and killed Mueller who vengefully came after them, and was picked up by the helicopter. To prove the drug story, he gives Hardy, Osborne, and Styles, who was also present at this last interrogation, the number of a crate where Vilmer would stow the cocaine.</p>
<p>Hardy relates this story to Styles, but mentions that West's choice to wait doesn't add up. He tells Styles that he suspects West <i>did</i> in fact go to Styles, but that Styles was behind the drug dealing operation the whole time. Rather than side with West, he ordered him killed. With Kendall and Mueller dead and Vilmer behind bars, Styles says that he can be back in business in no time and offers Hardy a bribe in order to keep him quiet. As Hardy turns to leave, Styles pulls a gun on him; he is shot and killed by Osborne, though, who had overheard the entire conversation.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/s/Basic_%28film%29.html" title="Edit section: Final twist">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Final twist</span></h3>
<p>After the military police wrap up the matter, Hardy passes a phrase to Osborne, "All we have to do is tell the story right", which had been used earlier by both Kendall and Pike, particularly in describing how members of the conspiracy planned to cover up West's death. This makes Osbourne suspect that there is more to Hardy than meets the eye. She tails him and sees him pick up Pike, and the two of them enter a doorway with a big <a href="../../../e/i/g/Eight_ball.html" title="Eight ball">eight ball</a> hanging above it. Osborne sneaks up behind Hardy and pulls a gun on him, believing that he has masterminded Section 8's drug deals from the beginning. However, West comes up behind her and admonishes her. It is revealed that Section 8 is actually a special anti-drug unit led by Hardy. Now that West and his team are all "officially" dead, the unit can operate with much more freedom than before. "Hardy," "Nuñez," "Castro," "Pike," and "Dunbar" are all members. West offers Osborne a job. Osborne says she needs a beer. Suddenly, one of the members refers to Hardy as "Colonel". Osbourne is confused, but Hardy just winks at her right at the film's end.</p>
