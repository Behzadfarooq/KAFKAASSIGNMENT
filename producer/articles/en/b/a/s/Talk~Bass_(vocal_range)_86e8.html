<p>I cannot believe someone was stupid enough to purt Mark Knofler on the popular bass list! Do you really know what a Bass is? Do you really know who Mark Knofler is? Tell, me in which song has Mark Knofler demonstrated he fits or can sing in the bass range? Mark Knofler barely even has a vocal range.

<p>Mark Knopfler has a very low and short vocal range. I know he cannot pitch higher than D4 but can reach F2 easily. As for an example try listen to the 'Rudiger' song from the Golden Hart album. There are plenty of F2's by Mark Knopfler. <a href="../../../d/o/x/User%7EDoxent_a17d.html" title="User:Doxent">Doxent</a> 22:40, 06 Aug 2006 (CEST)</p>
<p>Not because he reaches the F2 does it mean he is a bass! To be a bass you have to at least confortable reach the E below the bass cleff...at least, and a majority of basses go a lot lower than that!...Mark Knofler is probably a baritone, but reality is that he has a very limited vocal range. <a href="../../../k/i/s/User%7EKiske_c42b.html" title="User:Kiske">Kiske</a> 00:42, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think the upper range may be inaccurate on some of these vocal range pages; <a href="../../../b/a/s/Basso.html" title="Basso">basso</a> says that range generally rises to the E above middle C (although the image shows a D), <a href="../../../b/a/s/Bass-baritone.html" title="Bass-baritone">bass-baritone</a> to the F#, and <a href="../../../b/a/r/Baritone.html" title="Baritone">baritone</a> only to the F? <a href="../../../k/e/p/User%7EKeppa_ff7d.html" title="User:Keppa">Keppa</a> 20:33, 3 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Specifically, the top end of the bass register that I usually hear is middle C (C4) (<a href="http://www.library.yale.edu/cataloging/music/vocalrg.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.library.yale.edu/cataloging/music/vocalrg.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.library.yale.edu/cataloging/music/vocalrg.htm</a>). I sing up to the E above middle C myself, and I've been called a baritone or a bass-baritone, never a bass. <a href="../../../k/e/p/User%7EKeppa_ff7d.html" title="User:Keppa">Keppa</a> 03:41, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I think usually bass singers are able to reach the D right above the middle C. If my memory serves me correct, even the aria of Sarastro reaches D (or #C?). Leporello reaches E and stays on D for a long time in the catalogue aria. Bartolo reaches at leat D in <i>La vendetta</i>. My personal view is, human register varies smoothly among different people, so the classification of voice part is a matter not only of register but also of timbre, etc... Don Ottavio's aria <i>Dalla sua pace</i> has a highest note only G, which many Baritones can reach, but it is still a Tenor aria. Schpnhr 20:30 September 3 2006 (EDT)</p>

<dd>I sing in an amateur choir, and I can give lots of examples of music that requires E above middle C for the basses. F and F# above middle C can also be seen, but that is not common. <a href="../../../a/p/u/User%7EApus_40c6.html" title="User:Apus">Apus</a> 11:03, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>First off let me say that bass is mostly about where the voice sits. You can be a bass singer and have a range where your lowest note is an F2. However, all of the basses i have met have at least a D2 as their lowest note. A profondo is usually lower than a cantante, but is almost soley determined by the texture and tessitura of the voice. Bass-baritones are a not always higher than a bass. I have met a few with lower ranges than some profondos. Bass-baritones are generally categorized for their high notes and their comfort in the higher baritone tessituras, as well as in the lower register. - La Vendetta goes up to an E above middle C and down to a G#. - Sarastro's aria (O isis und osiris) goes up to middle C and down to F2. In diesen heil'gen Hallen; his other aria also goes up to middle C but down to F#2. - The lowest note demanded of a bass in an aria is a D2, (Omins aria "O, wie will ich triumphiren" from Die Entfurhung aus dem serail) This aria goes up to an E above middle C as well, -which i believe is the highest demanded note of any bass aria as well (but i'm not totally sure on that) and therefore: A low bass range should be classified (once developed of course!) as D2-E4 While a higher one, such as a cantante, could be F2-E4. (I am a young operatic bass singer with a C2-D4 range at the moment; please correct me if any of this information is wrong and thanks)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Range varies between singers, there is no correct range. My attempt to add additional opinions is because many is better than one which we are all forced to agree on. Your lowest c is a note I would die for (well i'm exaggerating but you get the message). It is likely your passaggio engages at a slightly lower top note than mine. The Oktavists of Russia make your C2 look pathetic, and my E2 pitiable, but they make us no less basses than we already were. Range is given as a rough guide. A friend of mine goes no lower than Bb2 and is clearly a tenor, yet he can't go above G4 because nobody has taught him to cover his tone. He is still a tenor however, and there are range estimates for people like him out there, just as the article describes me and you more or less, give a few notes.--<a href="../../../i/27/l/User%7EI%27ll_bring_the_food_9bbe.html" title="User:I'll bring the food">I'll bring the food</a> (<a href="../../../i/27/l/User_talk%7EI%27ll_bring_the_food_063e.html" title="User talk:I'll bring the food">Talk</a> - <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_I%27ll_bring_the_food_8850.html" title="Special:Contributions/I'll bring the food">Contribs</a> - <a href="../../../i/27/l/User%7EI%27ll_bring_the_food_other_1668.html" title="User:I'll bring the food/other">My Watchlist</a>) 01:25, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Alright, listen up folks. Range doesn't really mean much when it comes to bassdom.</p>
<p>What to look for to determine bassdom is a noticably deep and resonant timbre, and a large lower register!</p>
<p>Just because someone hits a D2 does not mean they are a bass.</p>

<p>i used to sing bass in a choir and have studied voice as a baritone. i don't think the comments about the range of chest/middle/head are very accurate, if such a distinction can even be said to exist at all; the only obvious bass ranges are chest voice and falsetto. even the article on <a href="../../../h/e/a/Head_voice.html" title="Head voice">head voice</a> seems to disagree about where the "head voice" begins. most basses sing in what's essentially a single voice (chest voice) all the way up to e4 or so; i think the "authorities" who make claims about "head voice" are making confused analogies with women singers, where the situation is very different. i heard (once) a bass who sang all the way from f2 to f5, moving smoothly from chest voice to a sort of middle or head voice (around e4-c5) to what was clearly a falsetto above this; but this is *not* normal for bass singing. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenwing_4140.html" title="User:Benwing">Benwing</a> 04:38, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>nor is the assertion that a bass is weakest in their upper range very accurate. all good male singers have strong upper ranges (that's why pop singers often sing so high); it's just that basses (esp. true basses) can also project a strong lower range (below c3). <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenwing_4140.html" title="User:Benwing">Benwing</a> 04:45, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>To clarify, middle and head voice are types of modulations in the cords, for some reason there seems to be a misunderstanding in the fraternity over what head voice is. Head voice is not a more connected falsetto, and Brett Manning does little to help the cause by offering EQ'd falsetto as an example of what the head register is. The head register is simply a voice in which a technique called "covering" is used above a certain threshold, where depth is lost and a less boomy tone is produced. In tenors, the head range begins at G4 and goes to about E5 or occasionally as far as F5. The head register article does not disagree, it merely has a multitude of pedagogists who have their own ideas and methodologies. The person you speak of simply has a good head voice that he can project over a tenor range. Chris Cornell, a baritone, possesses something similar. --<a href="../../../i/27/l/User%7EI%27ll_bring_the_food_9bbe.html" title="User:I'll bring the food">I'll bring the food</a> (<a href="../../../i/27/l/User_talk%7EI%27ll_bring_the_food_063e.html" title="User talk:I'll bring the food">Talk</a> - <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_I%27ll_bring_the_food_8850.html" title="Special:Contributions/I'll bring the food">Contribs</a> - <a href="../../../i/27/l/User%7EI%27ll_bring_the_food_other_1668.html" title="User:I'll bring the food/other">My Watchlist</a>) 00:56, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'll also address other things from you:</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>One friend going to C5 isn't a notable source.</li>
<li>What you have studied as is not a reliable source, if you have books, they however, are.</li>
<li>Richard Miller has similar views to the author of Singing for Dummies, there is no reason to doubt her.</li>
<li>"most basses sing in what's essentially a single voice (chest voice) all the way up to e4 or so;" Is totally and utterly incorrect. At C#-Db4 the majority of basses engage their head voice. They begin covering the tone. Sometimes this is called mixed voice, sometimes this is called voce piena in testa, sometimes it's called belting. They are <b>all</b> the same thing. Don't let the deluded masses of SLS and Brett Manning make you think head voice is anything other than a full voiced belt lacking some depth. All the top voices in "pop" have a high range because they either use falsetto, belt, have a tenor range or scream, a lot. Females can get away with a falsetto on the high notes (whistle register) and people even treat that as part of their range in pop. The top notes of a bass are not chest voice.--<a href="../../../i/27/l/User%7EI%27ll_bring_the_food_9bbe.html" title="User:I'll bring the food">I'll bring the food</a> (<a href="../../../i/27/l/User_talk%7EI%27ll_bring_the_food_063e.html" title="User talk:I'll bring the food">Talk</a> - <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_I%27ll_bring_the_food_8850.html" title="Special:Contributions/I'll bring the food">Contribs</a> - <a href="../../../i/27/l/User%7EI%27ll_bring_the_food_other_1668.html" title="User:I'll bring the food/other">My Watchlist</a>) 01:08, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, do you notice how one source says the bass goes up to a mere C4? That's because that source does not include head voice. It also says the tenor goes up to a mere G4. that is the tenor's top notes in chest, before the passaggio forces them to belt voce piena in testa over that limit. --<a href="../../../i/27/l/User%7EI%27ll_bring_the_food_9bbe.html" title="User:I'll bring the food">I'll bring the food</a> (<a href="../../../i/27/l/User_talk%7EI%27ll_bring_the_food_063e.html" title="User talk:I'll bring the food">Talk</a> - <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_I%27ll_bring_the_food_8850.html" title="Special:Contributions/I'll bring the food">Contribs</a> - <a href="../../../i/27/l/User%7EI%27ll_bring_the_food_other_1668.html" title="User:I'll bring the food/other">My Watchlist</a>) 01:14, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
