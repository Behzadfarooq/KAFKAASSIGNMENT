<p>I reverted back to the disambig version of the article, as <a href="../../../b/a/s/Bass_guitar.html" title="Bass guitar">Bass guitar</a> is definately not the most widely used term, and <a href="../../../b/a/s/Bass_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Bass (disambiguation)">Bass (disambiguation)</a> being harder to search for, already redirected here. Rather than fixing all the double redirects when the user redirected, they did nothing. I feel this page should not be any specific item and better serves as the disambig page. Also, many articles already refer to this page as the disambig page, including redirects. <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Who_d857.html" title="Special:Contributions/Who"><font color="#FF0033">∞</font></a><a href="../../../w/h/o/User%7EWho_d957.html" title="User:Who">Who</a><a href="../../../w/h/o/User_talk%7EWho_fe12.html" title="User talk:Who"><font color="#00FF00">?</font><font color="#FF00FF">¿</font><font color="#0033FF">?</font></a> 18:51, 31 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>While "Bass guitar is definately not the most widely used term" in the world, it is by far the most widely used term here on Wikipedia (because of all the articles about bands and songs -- check the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Whatlinkshere/Bass&amp;limit=500&amp;from=0" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Whatlinkshere/Bass&amp;limit=500&amp;from=0" rel="nofollow">links</a> if you don't believe). I support moving the pages around to make <a href="../../../b/a/s/Bass_guitar.html" title="Bass guitar">Bass guitar</a> the main entry just to deal with the (ever-growing) problem of links to this disambiguation page. <a href="../../../e/w/l/User%7EEwlyahoocom_d1b9.html" title="User:Ewlyahoocom">Ewlyahoocom</a> 09:48, 11 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think part of the problem is that most people in the greater rock community, at least in my experience, don't think of "bass" as a shortened form of "bass guitar." They typically don't even think of them as guitars at all but as a whole separate instrument. I've even witnessed a number of occasions where they poked fun at (seemingly) musicly ignorant folks who called them guitars. They were all like "that's not a guitar! - it's a bass!" And I was like (thinkin to myself) "well it's really a bass guitar..." I guess it's really just a matter of semantics, and most bands prefer to think of themselves as having three completely different instruments in their band (guitar, drums, and bass) rather than just two.</p>
<p>And in discussions of rock music, you almost never hear the phrase "bass guitar" used - it's always something like "Matt on <a href="../../../l/e/a/Lead_guitar.html" title="Lead guitar">lead guitar</a> and vocals, Jeff on <a href="../../../r/h/y/Rhythm_guitar.html" title="Rhythm guitar">rhythm guitar</a> and vocals, Sarah on <a href="../../../d/r/u/Drums.html" title="Drums">drums</a>, and Nick on <a href="../../../b/a/s/Bass.html" title="Bass">bass</a>." So it's natural that people would like to it like that for all the multitude of rock bands on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../e/n/p/User%7EENpeeOHvee_d3f3.html" title="User:ENpeeOHvee">ENpeeOHvee</a> 23:49, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I certainly support having bass guitar as the main entry. Too many editors to band articles will never realise that this disambig page exists. It would be hopeless to try to inform them. <a href="../../../p/i/c/User%7EPicaroon9288_bfd0.html" title="User:Picaroon9288">Picaroon9288</a> 21:20, 25 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>When the links in the band articles show up in maroon, won't that hint that the page being linked to is a disambig page? (Or is that just one of the extra settings that I've customised along the way that does that?) Just because one particular group is unaware/uninformed, doesn't mean we should make an exception. It would be easier for Australians if we could just link to <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victoria.html" title="Victoria">Victoria</a>, but we understand that although it is the most obvious meaning for the word for us, it isn't for everyone. -- <a href="../../../c/h/u/User%7EChuq_73ab.html" title="User:Chuq">Chuq</a> 03:21, 26 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You have a point, it isn't right to make bass the main entry just to make it easier on editors to band articles. However, I, at least, see no other solution. (And that must be one of your settings, as I need to run my cursor across the link and wait for one of Lupin's popups to tell me it's a dab page.) If anyone has another idea, I'm all ears. <a href="../../../p/i/c/User%7EPicaroon9288_bfd0.html" title="User:Picaroon9288">Picaroon9288</a>|<a href="../../../p/i/c/User_talk%7EPicaroon9288_6280.html" title="User talk:Picaroon9288">ta</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Picaroon9288_8e3f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Picaroon9288">co</a> 18:35, 26 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The best idea IMO is for people talking about a bass guitar to use <a href="../../../b/a/s/Bass_guitar.html" title="Bass guitar">bass guitar</a> - "bass" is just a shortend form of this anyway - and if they don't, there is a link to there from the <a href="../../../b/a/s/Bass.html" title="Bass">bass</a> article. -- <a href="../../../c/h/u/User%7EChuq_73ab.html" title="User:Chuq">Chuq</a> 00:39, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Greetings from <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Disambiguation_bf59.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Disambiguation">Wikipedia:WikiProject Disambiguation</a>. <b><a href="../../../b/a/s/Bass.html" title="Bass">Bass</a></b> showed up with 214 links at <a href="../../../d/i/s/Wikipedia%7EDisambiguation_pages_with_links_2ad7.html" title="Wikipedia:Disambiguation pages with links">Wikipedia:Disambiguation pages with links</a>. I looked down the list of <a href="../../../w/h/a/Special%7EWhatlinkshere_Bass_1dbb.html" title="Special:Whatlinkshere/Bass">Special:Whatlinkshere/Bass</a> and clicked about 20 that looked liked they might not be music related (though <i>anything</i> can be a band or album or song name). I pointed six links to <a href="../../../b/a/s/Bass_%28fish%29.html" title="Bass (fish)">bass (fish)</a>, one to <a href="../../../b/a/s/Bass_%28beer%29.html" title="Bass (beer)">Bass (beer)</a>, and two to nowhere. I believe 98% of the rest would better be <a href="../../../b/a/s/Bass_%28musical_term%29.html" title="Bass (musical term)">bass (musical term)</a>. Many of those could be better still directed to <a href="../../../b/a/s/Bass_guitar.html" title="Bass guitar">bass guitar</a>, a few could be pointed elsewhere. I suggest moving the existing <a href="../../../b/a/s/Bass.html" title="Bass">bass</a> to <a href="../../../b/a/s/Bass_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Bass (disambiguation)">bass (disambiguation)</a>, and redirecting to <a href="../../../b/a/s/Bass_%28musical_term%29.html" title="Bass (musical term)">bass (musical term)</a>. There are new rock pages every day, and they are not going to stop ambiguously linking <a href="../../../b/a/s/Bass.html" title="Bass">bass</a>. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarticus88_0fa5.html" title="User:Barticus88">-- Randall Bart</a> 12:44, 14 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Through my experience as well, I think that <a href="../../../b/a/s/Bass_guitar.html" title="Bass guitar">bass guitar</a> is the primary topic for this page and that the disambiguation page should be moved to <a href="../../../b/a/s/Bass_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Bass (disambiguation)">bass (disambiguation)</a>. This page accumulates ambiguous links at just about the fastest rate of any in Wikipedia, except for nationality/ethnicity adjectives. <a href="../../../d/e/k/User%7EDekimasu_4909.html" title="User:Dekimasu">Dekimasu</a><font color="darkgreen"><small><a href="../../../d/e/k/User_talk%7EDekimasu_df11.html" title="User talk:Dekimasu">よ!</a></small></font> 17:22, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
