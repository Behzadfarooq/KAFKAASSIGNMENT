<p>As you edit articles linked from here, try to express the matter as the general case as opposed to a specific application and add a link back to basic process. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFredbauder_859e.html" title="User:Fredbauder">User:Fredbauder</a></p>
<hr />
<p>Wow, this, alongside <a href="../../../p/r/o/Process.html" title="Process">Process</a>, is so broad as to be surreal! I don't suppose Fredbauder or someone else could clarify what sort of theoretical perspective this is meant to embody? Is there some academic/philosophical school represented here, or is this Fredbauder's original synthesis? At this point, it looks like practically <i>anything</i> could qualify as a "basic process". Unless someone can place this in some kind of context, I'd say that <a href="../../../b/a/s/Basic_process.html" title="Basic process">basic process</a> and the pages linked off of it look more like an experimental new kind of dictionary than anything else. While this effort looks interesting, it does not seem in the spirit of an encyclopedia, and I'm not sure wikipedia is the correct medium with which to pursue it. -- <a href="../../../r/y/g/User%7ERyguasu_fbf3.html" title="User:Ryguasu">Ryguasu</a></p>
<p>Yes, I'm afraid this is to an extent, perhaps wholely, original work. I don't think just anything could qualify as a basic process. Essentially it is work on a basic pattern language. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFredbauder_859e.html" title="User:Fredbauder">Fredbauder</a> 14:53 Oct 30, 2002 (UTC)</p>
<p>Wikipedia is (unfortunately?) not the place to create new theories and concepts, things should be published other places and be acknowledged before they find their place in an encyclopedia. Fredbauder, please try to link your stuff with some existing school of thought, for example patterns in architecture and <a href="../../../d/e/s/Design_pattern_%28computer_science%29.html" title="Design pattern (computer science)">design patterns</a> in <a href="../../../s/o/f/Software_engineering.html" title="Software engineering">software engineering</a>. --<a href="../../../g/u/p/User%7EGuppie_bc0a.html" title="User:Guppie">Guppie</a></p>
<p>Alternatively, there seem to be other forums more conducive to experimentation, including meta.wikipedia and everything2. Is there some reason you prefer wikipedia to these other forums, Fredbauder? Granted, switching from one to another is a pain. But is wikipedia somehow a superior medium? --<a href="../../../r/y/g/User%7ERyguasu_fbf3.html" title="User:Ryguasu">Ryguasu</a></p>
<hr />
<p>I ran across the notion of a pattern language in this book:</p>
<ul>
<li><cite>Pattern Language Towns, Buildings, Construction</cite>, Christopher Alexander, Oxford University Press, 1997, hardcover, 1216 pages, <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0195019199</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Probably not further reading for the article however as it is limited to architecture. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFredbauder_859e.html" title="User:Fredbauder">Fredbauder</a> 13:00 Oct 31, 2002 (UTC)</p>
<p>-Alexander's books are not only about buildings, it is truly an example of a pattern language (see <a href="../../../d/e/s/Design_pattern.html" title="Design pattern">design pattern</a>). His books "A Timeless way of building" (1979) and "Pattern language..." have inspired pattern thinking in other fields as well, for example in software engineering. --<a href="../../../g/u/p/User%7EGuppie_bc0a.html" title="User:Guppie">Guppie</a></p>
<hr />
<p>Is this article really suitable for Wikipedia?</p>
<p>I've gone back and forth on this. Obviously it is a vulnerable article as the term basic process is not in general use; however, in scientific, technical and engineering literature information has been developed of the processes which underlie phenomena and which "make things work". Collected, that information is established knowledge. I'm in it for the fun of attacking a difficult and interesting question, but eventually I think a useful and interesting article will result. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFred_Bauder_e542.html" title="User:Fred Bauder">Fred Bauder</a> 11:09 Nov 5, 2002 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>Fred, it's good that you're having fun with this, but it is most certainly your original research, and original research has no place in Wikipedia. Develop it somewhere else, write a book or article about your ideas, but do not add them to Wikipedia until they are well received.</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>in scientific, technical and engineering literature information has been developed of the processes which underlie phenomena and which "make things work". Collected, that information is established knowledge.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>In other words, many people have written about many things, and now you want to put everything together and give it structure and a unified presentation. A laudable and grand project, other people have tried it before; most definitely original research.</p>
<p>I vote for deletion. <a href="../../../a/x/e/User%7EAxelBoldt_4306.html" title="User:AxelBoldt">AxelBoldt</a> 22:04 Nov 26, 2002 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>I tend to agree with Axel, original research, even when it tries to find broader concepts for existing ones, is best done elsewhere. But nobody would have a problem if you moved this page to meta.wikipedia.org. (Interestingly, when we come across these border cases, we often think about Wikipedia spin off projects that could be used to store that type of knowledge -- for dictionary terms, a "Wiktionary" is being planned, for source material, we're thinking about "Project Sourceberg" (a terrible name, IMHO), perhaps we need something for original research as well -- a kind of explorepedia&#160;;-) --<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_6468.html" title="User:Eloquence">Eloquence</a></p>
<hr />
<p>I have blanked this page and copied the original article over to meta; see <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Basic_processes" class="extiw" title="m:Basic_processes">m:Basic processes</a>. The reasons for doing so are basically given above; such original work, at least before gaining legitimacy through, say, being published in a book or on a widely popular web site, does not belong in an encyclopedia. (Even when work has gained legitimacy in this manner, it seems best for someone <i>other</i> than the original author to write the wikipedia article.)</p>
<p>I think <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFred_Bauder_e542.html" title="User:Fred Bauder">Fred</a> has had enough time to counter this argument, and has not done so effectively. He has mentioned <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christopher_Alexander_cb8d.html" title="Christopher Alexander">Christopher Alexander</a>, <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Searle_2395.html" title="John Searle">John Searle</a>, and <a href="http://howstuffworks.com" class="external text" title="http://howstuffworks.com" rel="nofollow">howstuffworks.com</a>, but it appears, at least on a superficial glance, that none of these sources use the term "basic process" in the way he does. A connection has been made to <a href="../../../d/e/s/Design_pattern_%28computer_science%29.html" title="Design pattern (computer science)">design patterns</a>, but what I know of that concept (from <a href="../../../s/o/f/Software_engineering.html" title="Software engineering">software engineering</a>) suggests that it, too, is quite different from a "basic process". The term "pattern language" has been mentioned, but it has not been explained what that means, or how it is different from design patterns.</p>
<p>Note that no one has seriously argued that, if the work is as original as claimed, it really does belong in an encyclopedia.</p>
<p>I hope this does not seem overly hostile. I wish the basic processes essay the best as it continues its life on meta, and I hope Fred will contribute to the articles on Alexander, Searle, design patterns, etc.. If one of the above authors <i>does</i> use the term "basic process" in a technical way, I would also invite Fred to replace this article with an explanation of that technical concept.</p>
