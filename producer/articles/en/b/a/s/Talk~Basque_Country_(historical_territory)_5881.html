<p>I think this article has no neutral point of view, since it has a strongly basque nationalist point ov view.</p>
<p>First, most of Navarrese didnÂ´t consider themselves basques, and support UPN project to eliminate the possibility of joining basque country (fuente: navarrÃ³metro) This is a very important thing that is no said in the article. I donÂ´t know in Iparralde, but I think is the same.</p>
<p>I think really basque ethnic are a minority in the basque country, and people with basque surnames in some territories, like in Alava, are a historical minority; and really basque nationalinm only is a majority in Biscay and Guipuzcoa, and continous reference to the self-determination (including ETB reference in the final part of the article) gives an idea of the strong nationalist point of view in this article.</p>
<p>I think it must be re-editated. --Ioritak 12:59, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>The map of the seven provinces is good, but in Araba, the TreviÃ±o county is marked. TreviÃ±o county is part of Araba, but is administratively part of Castilla-Leon. Despite, itÂ´s part of the historical territory. So, if somebody takes that map and erases the TreviÃ±o countyÂ´s distinction, it will be better. At least, somebody can explain in the caption why thereÂ´s a purple hole in the middle of Araba.</p>
<p>Actually it should not be removed because Euskal Herria even if it's the 7 provinces for us (BASQUE) is always taught Euskal Herria to be it all, TreviÃ±o included.</p>
<p>It's important to denote that Euskal Herria is meant to be the land where at some point in history used to be basque speaking territory (more or less) and so TreviÃ±o is inside Euskal Herria (even if it's not inside Euskadi). Euskal Herria is nothing oficial is just some land punt together to make sense to an idea, to an identity. It has never been a provice all together or whatsoever.</p>
<p><br />
If Euskal Herria is considered basque speaking territory, Alava and South of Navarra are not Euskal Herria because traditionally are spanish speaking territories and basque language desappeared from there a lot of centuries ago. --Ioritak 12:39, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I would be very strongly interested about any information about the "borders" of the Basque Country (mostly for use on <i>:fr</i> Wikipedia). By information I mostly mean <b>sources</b> for this information. Lists of "Basque country" communes can be found on a great number of websites -among which Wikipedia- see for instance <a href="../../../l/a/p/Template%7ELapurdi_c097.html" title="Template:Lapurdi">Template:Lapurdi</a> whose origin I could not understand.

<p>I think that, as someone sort-of-said above, this article's definition of Basque Country is a little confusing. While it admits halfway through that Basque Country extends into France, it opens with âThe Basque Country ([â¦]) is an autonomous community of the Spanish stateâ and includes all kinds of charts on top and bottom describing it as such. In my experience, when people talk about âBasque Countryâ in English they always mean the traditional Basque territory that lies both in France and Spain. How about moving all the Spanish political stuff to <a href="../../../b/a/s/Basque_Country_%28Autonomous_Community_of_Spain%29_06d6.html" title="Basque Country (Autonomous Community of Spain)">Basque Country (Autonomous Community of Spain)</a> and having the current address be for the larger area? <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENathan_Hamblen_0375.html" title="User:Nathan Hamblen">Nathan</a> 20:04, 25 May 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>The second paragraph of the History section has more to do with the <a href="../../../b/a/s/Basque.html" title="Basque">Basque</a> people than the geography of the Basque Country, and its information on fueros, etc., already appears in that article. Any objections to removing it? <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENathan_Hamblen_0375.html" title="User:Nathan Hamblen">Nathan</a> 09:46, Jun 2, 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Ok, I've removed it from the page (<a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENathan_Hamblen_0375.html" title="User:Nathan Hamblen">Nathan</a> 06:20, Jun 4, 2004 (UTC)). Here's the paragraph:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Until the French Revolution (and, to some extent, beyond that in Spain), <i>Euskal Herria</i> retained its <i><a href="../../../f/u/e/Fuero.html" title="Fuero">fueros</a></i> -- separate laws, taxes and law courts -- respected by both French and Spanish monarchs. With the fall of the <i><a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancien_r%C3%A9gime.html" title="Ancien rÃ©gime">ancien rÃ©gime</a></i>, the <i>fueros</i> were completely abolished in France, which came under a central government that abolished all local privileges. In Spain, with some irony, through the various civil wars of the <a href="../../../n/i/n/Nineteenth_Century_caaa.html" title="Nineteenth Century">Nineteenth Century</a> the <i>fueros</i> were upheld by the nominally <a href="../../../a/b/s/Absolute_monarchy.html" title="Absolute monarchy">absolutist</a> <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carlism.html" title="Carlism">Carlists</a> and opposed by the victorious constitutional forces. Thus the same wars that brought relative liberty to most of Spain abolished most of the traditional liberties of the Basques.</dd>
</dl>
<p>However, the Spanish provinces remained with the widest autonomy in Peninsular Spain. After the <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spanish_Civil_War_7a30.html" title="Spanish Civil War">Spanish Civil War</a>, the regime of <a href="../../../f/r/a/Francisco_Franco_4235.html" title="Francisco Franco">General Franco</a> considered Biscay and Gipuzkoa as "traitor provinces" abolishing the remains of their autonomy, but Navarre and Alava maintained small local police forces and some tax self-government.</p>
<p>"Since the time of Sancho III, there has been no single government over all seven territories".<br />
The Napoleonic Empire directly governed the French Basque Country, and by taking over the kingdom of Spain, oficially also governed the Spanish Basque Country. Nowadays European Union governs over the whole Basque Country on some issues. Maybe it should read sort of <i>no single <b>independent</b> government over all seven terriroties</i> or <i>no single government over all seven territories based on the Basque Country</i>.--<a href="../../../e/r/r/User%7EErri4a_65f5.html" title="User:Erri4a">Erri4a</a> 22:55, 12 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>The entry of Spain in the European Union and the regionalization of France has led to meetings among the Basque Autonomous Comunity, Navarre and Aquitaine within the Atlantic Arch.</dd>
</dl>
<p>At first I was stuck by âregionalization of Franceâ as I've never heard that phrase, and Google barely has, but the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_regions_in_France_ee0b.html" title="List of regions in France">List of regions in France</a> article does have some info on administrative changes that served to decentralize the French government. (According to the French version of that page those laws were put into place in 1982.) Ok, so maybe we rephrase and link to the other article. But then what's this âAtlantic Archâ? At first I assumed it was literally an arch, some Basque monument. But apparently <a href="http://basque.unr.edu/07/7.3.1t/7.3.1.3t/7.3.1.3.2.lesson1.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://basque.unr.edu/07/7.3.1t/7.3.1.3t/7.3.1.3.2.lesson1.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> it's the Atlantic coastline between Santiago de Compostela and Bourdeaux.

<p>An anonymous user has removed reference to Navarre as a region of Basque Country. I too think that it's inaccurate to take the modern Navarre AC's borders and claim all of it as "Basque Country" when the majority of that territory has probably never been inhabited by Basques.</p>

<p>And reporting the population and square km of Basque Country including all of Navarre was even worse (I apologize for bringing those cooked figures over from an article I folded in to this one; the truth is I was afraid to remove them.)</p>
<p>On the other hand, every map I've ever seen of Basque Country includes all of Navarre. I included it in the red area map on this page too, because I wouldn't know where else to draw the line. (Amusingly, the distinctive hammer shape of the <i>Euskal Herria</i> outline comes from territory that â by my reckoning, seeing as it's the southeast fringe of Navarre â probably never heard much Basque spoken.)</p>

Is there maybe a name for that part? And where do we draw the map line?</p>

<dd>The whole of Navarre is considered part of <a href="../../../e/u/s/Euskal_Herria_6146.html" title="Euskal Herria">Euskal Herria</a> by those that use the concept.

<p>The problem is you're taking Basque Country as the translation of both PaÃ­s Vasco (the autonomous comunity), and Euskal Herria (the nationality, ethnicity, or whatever you want to call it). I've seen Euskal Herria translated as Basque Homeland in some other places, i don't like the translation personally, but it can be very helpful when it comes to distinguishing the two concepts. Navarre is not part of the Basque Country, but it is without any trace of doubt part of Euskal Herria regardless of how does part of the navarrese people feel about it. It's like the Basque Country, most basque people wont say they're part of spain, but right now, the Basque Country is part of Spain. Then we can argue wether the basques are more or less spanish and wether the navarrese are more or less basque, but that doesn't change the meaning of the words and what do they stand for today. Tha, Mikel.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Besides, <i><a href="../../../p/a/y/Pays_Basque_fa9d.html" title="Pays Basque">Pays Basque</a></i> is (I think) mostly understood as just the sea part of <a href="../../../p/y/r/Pyrenees_Atlantiques_2746.html" title="Pyrenees Atlantiques">Pyrenees Atlantiques</a>.</dd>

</dl>
<p>In this case I really do think we should use Basque Country for the autonomous comunity and Euskal Herria for euskal herria, picking a name won't make it really exist. Even in spanish the term euskal herria is not translated, personally i think this is because they don't want people to know the difference but that's apart from this. So I think we should just use Euskal Herria as we (BASQUE people) call it, it will all make a lot more sense and not mess up things and words.</p>

<p>Hi there, just a couple of things, first of all, It wouldn't make sense to remove Navarre, not in my opinion at least, since it's the original basque territory, and where the basque language comes from (lingua navarrorum in latin). Also, where it says that the basque nationalism emerged in the early 20th century, it should say middle 19th (1850's), if by basque nationalism it means the ideology, or late 19th (1876), if it means Basque Nationalist Party. Also, It would be better to use the english names, this is the english version of the encyclopedia, and it saves the hassle of having to change them again each time some spanish/basque nationalist visits the page. Cheers, Mikel.</p>
<p>Hi again, if no one has anything against it I'm going to change the century to 19th. Done.</p>

<p>Re: Dividing History and Description of France</p>
<p>Consider dividing the history into historical time periods (sections). It might help to discuss the internal Spanish politics happening during the 20th Century, instead of just obscurely referring to major event such as the Spanish Civil War and political developments afterward that seemed particularly absent in this article. Also, at the end of the history section, there could be a piece that talks about "the current political status of Basque Country." This is current events, not history.</p>
<p>One other thing is that I personally would not catagorize Franco as a fascist. He was certainly an autoritarian conservative dictator, but not in the style of Germany or Italy. However, I don't know how other people feel about this.</p>

<p>Where comes the flag from and why does it look very similar to the danish flag.</p>
<p><br />
Hello!</p>
<p>The flag, called "ikurriÃ±a" (from basque "ikurrin" = "flag") was created by Sabino Arana, founder of modern Basque independentist movement.</p>
<p>It looks similar to the Danish flag because both zones are traditionally Christian and the cross is a symbol for Christendom. In the Basque flag the white cross is meant to represent Catholicism, which has always been closely related to Basque separatist movements. The green "X", I do not remember what it stands for, but the cross and "X" together resemble the disposition of the chains at the coat of arms of Navarre.</p>
<hr />
<p>Hi!</p>
<p>OK, only a few specifications:</p>
<p>1- The catholicism has been related to basque separatism only in the first half of the 20th centurty. The early left-nationalism in the 1930's (the party called EAE-ANV) and ETA in the decade of 1950 weren't catholic but marxist. Catholicism has not too much importance nowadays on the independentist movement.</p>
<p>2- The meaning of the three colours in the flag is: - Red: Because of Bizkaia. The flag was designed by Sabino Arana, who firstly only wanted the independence for one province. The red colour has been historically the one that appears in the coat-of-arms of Bizkaia. Some people believes that it also represents the blood of basque people.</p>
<p>- Green cross: Is a St Andrews cross like in the scotish flag. It reminds the battle of St Andrews (San Andres) in the IX century, when Bizkaia become independet from the Kingdom of Leon.</p>
<p>- White cross: It's, like you say, because of catholicism, but we have to understand thar when the flag was created, Basque Country was a extremely catholic nation. Nowadays only a few people keeps that.</p>
<p>3- I also want to add that the ikurrina is not the only flag for the basque people: the "arrano beltza" (black eagle) and the chain flag of Navarre, "nafarroako bandera" (with no spanish crown of course) are also simbols of basque independentism.</p>
<p>You can get mor information about the Basque Country and its culture in the book "Orhipean, The Country of Basque": <a href="http://www.pamiela.org/liburuakbi/Orhi_ing.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.pamiela.org/liburuakbi/Orhi_ing.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></p>
<p><br /></p>
<hr />
<p>Even the fact that I AM basque and I am nationalist, I strongly think the IKURRIÃA should be removed, since this article is talking about EUSKAL HERRIA and not euskadi. Euskal Herria has no ikurriÃ±a for itself or whatsoever since it is nothing oficial. IkurriÃ±a is for euskadi and so the ikurriÃ±a is not for all the euskal herria land. I strongly recoment the erase of the ikurriÃ±a it is erroneous to have it here.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I disagree. Everybody who thinks in Euskal Herria as a unity, wethere from a nationalist or merely culturalist viewpoint accepts the IkurriÃ±a as modern common banner, maybe along that of Navarre as historical state that included most of those territories.</dd>
<dd>I'd like it would be different. Personally I find the IkurriÃ±a too ideological in the Christian sense but it's almost universally accepted. --<a href="../../../s/u/g/User%7ESugaar_6002.html" title="User:Sugaar">Sugaar</a> 12:21, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Hope you will have a look. <a href="../../../b/e/r/User%7EBertilvidet_529b.html" title="User:Bertilvidet">Bertilvidet</a> 12:00, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>Ok, there is a conflict, but there should NOT be, for us Basque people we have Euskadi and Euskal Herria, meaning both different things, in spanish they don't make (or don't want to make) such a difference. If we attach to what WE (basque) define Euskadi and Euskal Herria they are two quite different terms. Euskadi is just the Basque Country Autonomous Comunity while Euskal Herria is the 7 provinces AND treviÃ±o. It's nothing official, never has been is just a made up term to make reference to the basque identity land.</p>

<dd>I doubt it's your intention because you seem very one sided, but it's clear that Basque Country and Navarre (before 1200) are about the same thing. Yet Basque Country also existed (arguably if you wish) before Navarre and Basques have always called it Euskal Herria: Basque People-Nation-Country. If Labourd wasn't in Navarre (it was only a for a few years) it was still in the Basque Country because it is ethnical identity what makes it, not political borders. --<a href="../../../s/u/g/User%7ESugaar_6002.html" title="User:Sugaar">Sugaar</a> 12:37, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have a book called <i>The Basque History of the World: The Story of a Nation</i> by Mark Kurlansky, who, at the very least, has a non-Basque last name.

<p>The name of this article is far from neutral. The "historical territory of the basque country" is a traditional basque nationalists aspiration, but itÂ´s far away from the real territoryÂ´s history. The entity called Euskal Herria has never been "historical", or "traditional". LetÂ´s read the Kingdom of NavarraÂ´s real history, to terminate with this kind of very extended lies.</p>

<p>I've edited <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFrench_Tourist_3313.html" title="User:French Tourist">French Tourist</a>'s last "apportations" in the following sense and for the following reasons:</p>
<p>1. FT replaced <i>The <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_provinces.html" title="French provinces">French provinces</a> lost their political meaning after the French Revolution</i> by <i>The <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_provinces.html" title="French provinces">French provinces</a> are nowadays just cultural divisions</i>.

<p>3. <a href="../../../l/a/b/Labourd.html" title="Labourd">Labourd</a>: I've changed the reference to the "bailiwick" by the term "traditional capital". Labourd was a semi-independent county for a time and, in fact Ustaritze was made capital because the English conquered Baiona (see the province's article). Hence I've also stated that both are tarditional capitals - though, in fact, it is Baiona the one that is usually considered the capital not just of Lapurdi but of the whole Iparralde, being the oldest city (from Roman times at least) and for some time the seat of a modern French sub-prefecture. --<a href="../../../s/u/g/User%7ESugaar_6002.html" title="User:Sugaar">Sugaar</a> 07:54, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think your reverts are quite problematic seen from the NPoV and sourcing policies. I shall comment them.</dd>
<dd>1) The sentence you reestablished is certainly "more precise" but seems to me a bit doubtful. Defining what a "<a href="../../../f/r/e/French_province.html" title="French province">French province</a>" is is quite a tricky task&#160;; I have recently read quite a lot of litterature about it, and this is a nightmare. I don't think it is quite accurate to say they "lost their political meaning" after the French Revolution, since they have been durably used with political aims. In the XIXth century, the notion of "province" is used by republican "jacobine" historiography, especially historiography using simplifications towards a general audience&#160;: provinces are a manifestation of "evil" and they are a traditional argument in favour of the "rational" policies of the modern Republic. On the other hand, "provinces" are a manifestation of "good" for reactionary forces in the XIXth (some royalists), and for quite different circles of opinion nowadays (regionalists)&#160;; it is hard to say that "provinces have lost their political meaning" nowadays while Basque nationalists feel so important to write that Northern Basque Country is made of seven provinces.</dd>
<dd>Hence I think provinces have certainly not lost their political importance nowadays. More concretely, what about replacing <i>political</i> by <i>administrative</i>&#160;?</dd>
<dd>2) I don't know what a "traditional capital" is. Which tradition is this&#160;? For instance what is the "traditional" capital of <a href="../../../c/a/s/Castille.html" title="Castille">Castille</a>&#160;? Is it <a href="../../../m/a/d/Madrid.html" title="Madrid">Madrid</a>, as the most recent one, or on the other hand is it one of the ancient seats of the counts of Castilla and which one&#160;? Your assertion can be kept as long as it is <b>sourced</b>, and gives explanation of what is meant by "tradition". Certainly <a href="../../../s/a/i/Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port_cac0.html" title="Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port">Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port</a> was the seat of most institutions of the area when it was a <a href="../../../m/e/r/Merindad.html" title="Merindad">merindad</a> of Spanish <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kingdom_of_Navarre_4da2.html" title="Kingdom of Navarre">kingdom of Navarre</a>, but I hardly see why the situation around <a href="../../../1/4/0/1400.html" title="1400">1400</a> should be more "traditional" that the situation around <a href="../../../1/7/0/1700.html" title="1700">1700</a>.</dd>
<dd>3) Same thing about "traditional". There I can only concede that it is true that Bayonne was for a short time, around <a href="../../../1/1/0/1100.html" title="1100">1100</a> a town in Labourd. Borders were quickly changing in this time, and, which is more important, I have not read sources proving that Bayonne was in any meaning a "capital" of the Labourd in these times. I have nothing about stating that Bayonne was a capital of Labourd in the XIIth century... as long as somebody can give a <b>source</b> for this assertion. Later on, Ustaritz remained the seat of the Bilzar until its dissolution with the French Revolution, hence I am quite suprised to find another "traditional" capital... Why <a href="../../../1/1/0/1100.html" title="1100">1100</a> rather than <a href="../../../1/5/0/1500.html" title="1500">1500</a> or <a href="../../../1/7/0/1700.html" title="1700">1700</a>&#160;? As long as you can <b>source</b> it, I have nothing against that, but the important matter is <b>sourcing</b> I think. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFrench_Tourist_3313.html" title="User:French Tourist">French Tourist</a> 08:39, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

(But I fully agree that a not totally relevant source is much better than no source at all). <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFrench_Tourist_3313.html" title="User:French Tourist">French Tourist</a> 12:37, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think "Pilota" should be "Pelota" if it is intended as the usual Spanish term corresponding to Jai-Alai. However I did not change it because I'm not sure - "Pilota" might be the correct spelling for some special Basque sense of the word.</p>
