<dd>Your arguments are regarding something else.bollywood is also marketed towards all other indian languages , so that doesnt prove anything. Can you provide any references which shows bollywood films are made in Urdu language like the Film certificates given by Censor board of India which clearly mentions the language of the Film.-<a href="../../../b/h/a/User%7EBharatveer_2e1b.html" title="User:Bharatveer">Bharatveer</a> 04:01, 2 October 2006 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Mall Sainthwar Rajputs</span></h2>
<p>Shalendra Singh MALL SAINTHWAR RAJPUTS</p>
<p>The Malls are Vishen Rajputs of Majhauli who got the area of Madhuban following administrative division of the Majhauli kingdom at the time of Akbar. These Mall-Vishen Rajputs are one of the most prominent and old Rajput families of eastern U.P. In Ancient India they were very strong and were rulers of the Mall Mahajanpad.</p>
<p>The Sainthwars are not a single family but they comprise of 36-37 clans of Rajputs who had to migrate to easern u.p. from Punjab , Rajsthan and Kashmir during the reign of Jahangir. In 1625 Jahangir was taken into custody by his ex General Mahawat Khan in Kashmir . He was assisted by Raja Nattha Mall of Majhauli and other Rajputs including Raja Moti Das of Sihat in Jalandhar ( Punjab ).However the rebel was crushed by Noorjahan's skill and force. The defeated Rajputs had to flee in different parts of the country. A group of 36-37 types of Rajput families led by Raja Moti Das of Sihat fled to eastern u.p. and took shelter in Majhauli and nearby regions at the invitation of Raja Nattha Mall of Majhauli as they were in the same army led by Mahawat Khan. these 36-37 clans of Rajputs were later on called as Sihatwars or Sainthwars on the name of their leader Raja Moti Das's old estate Sihat See for details&#160;: <a href="http://rajputms.co.in" class="external free" title="http://rajputms.co.in" rel="nofollow">http://rajputms.co.in</a></p>
<p>The Gaharwars are descendents of Raja Jai Chand's (of Kannauj) younger brother Manik Chand. They established a kingdom at Raj Kantit in south of Allahabad . In 1564 Raja Dadu Rai of Raj Kantit was killed by Ali Kuli Khan and Bahadur Khan. His son Bhual alais Bupal Rai took shelter in Majhauli as Raja Madhav Mall was his fufa. Raja Madhav Mall was later on given the area of Madhuban (named after him). Majhauli was ruled by his nephew Bheem Mall after he became adult.Bhual Rai helped Raja Majhauli in dethrowing Makwani Raja and was given 5 villages at Sidhua Jobana in Padrauna. Thus Bhual Rai became the founder of Padrauna estate. The area ruled by these Rais is also known as Raikkar.Luxmipur,Shekhwania,Semara, Bishunpura,Shivrajpur etc villages are well known.</p>
<p>The Sainthwar Rajputs were outsiders and were not accepted as such by local Rajputs except a branch of Mall-Vishen Rajputs of Majhauli (later on Madhuban) and Gaharwar Rajputs of Padrauna. As Nattha Mall of Majhauli was known to them before they came to this place and were oblized to him they made marital ties with a group of Malls.</p>
<p>The Sainthwars considered themselves to be of purest breed of Rajputs and they made marital ties with only those Rajputs who according to them were of so they kept on marrying within these 36-37 clans of Rajputs who were later on known as Sainthwars. These clans are described in AINE-AKBARI at different pages.( for details see VISHEN VANSH DARPAN . Please scan it from the book.)</p>

<p>Raj Bali Pandey in his book 'Gorakhpur ke Kshatriyon Ka Itihas' made a new theory about the origin of Sainthwars.He called them as Sansthagarik Kshatriya of Mall Mahajanpad who had taken to Buddhism.However no book written before him has ever mentioned this word Sansthagarik. There is no resemblence between the word Sainthwar and Sansthagarik neither by pronounciation nor by words.So Raj Bali Pandey's theory is not acceptable. The Sainthwars derive their name from 'Sihat' where their leader Raja Moti DAS ruled. see the resemblence Sihatwar - Sainthwar.</p>
<p>During the period of Aurangzeb a lot of Rajputs were forced to accept Islam.Raja Bodh Mall of Majhauli was also forcefully made Muslim and was given the name 'Salim'. When he returned to Majhauli his Rani asked him not to enter the palace. so he shifted to border and made Salempur his capital after his new name Salim. When he expired many of his relatives and pattidars bycotted his Brahm Bhoj. Madhuban was nearest pattidar and were strongly bycotting this. Theywere supported byVishens of Gonda,Pratapgarh and Kalankakar. Thus the Rajputs at that time were divided into two groups.Later on as time passed and Majhauli becama stronger many Rajputs gave bribe to Raja Majhauli and ate 'BHAT' with him but their nearest pattidars Madhuban and their supporters were still opposed to Majhauli. So the rift continued and worsened. A plot to defame Madhuban and their supporters mainly Sainthwars and Gaharwars was made. The Gaharwars of Padrauna were among the main targets as Rai Nath. Rai had not accepted Raja Bodh Mall's request to help. Rai Nath Rai was known to have good contacts in Aurangzeb's Darbar and was considered to be in his good faith. But he could not help Raja Majhaul;i who finally had to accept Islam. So Majhauli always thought that Nath Rai was responsible for this. Therefore his descendents had to face Majhauli's anger.Some wrong facts were written about Madhuban, and Padrauna by Lal Khadag Bahadur Mall in Vishen Vansh Vatika. No reply was given by ourside at that time.</p>
<p>Khadag Bahadur Mall denied Nattha Mall as his ancestor. The name of Raja Nattha Mall has been written at many pages including page38-39 of chapter 1 by Badshah Jahangir in his book TUZUK -E -JAHANGIRI. Khadag Bahadur Mall says Nattha Mall is actually Bheem Mall. He explains that due to change of positions of points Bheem Mall has become Nattha Mall . But this is not accepable as in Pharsi even if positions of points are changed Bheem can never become Nattna. (see Vishen Vansh Darpan page 39,4. Aina -e - Awadh page 270.</p>
<p>As differences between the two factions of Rajputs continued, efforts by some like minded people were made to unite them,a conference of all Kshatriyas was held under the leadership of Raja Awadhesh Singh of Kalankankar,Pratapgarh.The conference concluded that Raja Nattha Mall was son of Raja Madhav Mall of Majhauli. Their descendents known as Malls are Vishen Rajputs.It also held that Sainthwars and Padrauna are also Rajputs and are related to Malls.</p>
<p>A writ petition was filed by Sainthwar Rajputs in 1942 in the court of collector, Gorakhpur for the correction of papers in matter of caste. The court ordered that corrections be made as demanded. The word Sainthwar to be replaced by Kshatriya. Following this,correction were made accordingly. ( Please scan page 103,104.105&amp;106 of Vishen Vansh Darpan ).</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Thus this communityis perhaps among the few communities who have so clear-cut historical facts about their originality yet because of certain persons malintentions the community is facing identity crisis and inthe name of taking advantage by becoming O.B.C., the truth is not only being forgotten but has also been made to be subcaste of such caste with whom it has had no connection.</p>
<p>Serious thinking about the situation seems to be necessary. <b>See for details&#160;: <a href="http://rajputms.co.in" class="external autonumber" title="http://rajputms.co.in" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></b></p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Re: Diwali</span></h2>
<p>I think there are some Buddhist communities especially in Nepal and India which do celeberate Diwali. However, I am pretty sure that Diwali has no historical significance in Buddhism though some followers of Buddhism celeberate it. Also note that there are a lot of Hindus who regard Buddha as an avatar of Vishnu (similar to <a href="../../../r/a/m/Rama.html" title="Rama">Rama</a>). Buddh Purnima is a popular Hindu festival. Hence, there is no clear line of distinction between certain sects of Hinduism and Buddhism in India and Nepal. However, I do share your concern and will raise the issue on the talkpage of Diwali. Happy Diwali to you too&#160;:) --<a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeepak_gupta_071e.html" title="User:Deepak gupta">Incman</a>|<a href="../../../d/e/e/User_talk%7EDeepak_gupta_f27b.html" title="User talk:Deepak gupta">वार्ता</a> 21:00, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">occurring vs occuring</span></h2>
<p>I can see that you are going about to various pages on Wikipedia changing the spelling of "occured"/"occuring" with "occurred"/"occurred" ("r" vs "rr"). The former is not incorrect, it is a British/Commonwealth style of spelling the word. The general policy when it comes to this sort of thing is not to change the spelling of the word unless the article is specific to a particular <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia%7EManual_of_Style_350a.html#National_varieties_of_English" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style">national variety of English</a>. As "occured"/"occuring" is an accepted British spelling, unless the article is specifically American the spelling should not be arbitrarily changed.</p>

<dd>Hello there:
<p>Sorry for not responding sooner! For an online reference regarding occurring/occuring, see: <a href="http://www.xpdnc.com/moreinfo/orlabour.html" class="external free" title="http://www.xpdnc.com/moreinfo/orlabour.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.xpdnc.com/moreinfo/orlabour.html</a>. This is the only reference I can find that covers the word online. I have seen offline references in the past, but my Concise Oxford is apparently too concise in this matter.&#160;;-) It is admittedly a small point, but I wouldn't want anyone to waste their time fixing British/Commonwealth variations of words for their American spelling when the time can arguably be better spent elsewhere in Wikipedia.</p>
