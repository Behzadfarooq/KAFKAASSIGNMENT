<p>The <b><a href="../../../p/i/t/Pitcher.html" title="Pitcher">pitcher</a></b> is the player who throws the baseball from the <a href="../../../p/i/t/Pitcher%27s_mound.html" title="Pitcher's mound">pitcher's mound</a> toward the <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catcher.html" title="Catcher">catcher</a> to begin each play. In most cases, the object of a <a href="../../../p/i/t/Pitch_%28baseball%29.html" title="Pitch (baseball)">pitch</a> is to deliver the ball to the catcher without allowing the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Batter.html" title="Batter">batter</a> to hit it. Nearly all action during a game is centered around the pitcher for the defensive team. A pitcher's particular style and skill heavily influences the dynamics of the game and will often determine the victor. The type and sequence of pitches chosen depends upon the particular situation in a game. Because pitchers and catchers must coordinate each pitch, a system of hand signals are used by the catcher to communicate choices to the pitcher, to which the pitcher either vetoes or accepts. Baseball is one of few games in which the defense has control of the ball, with <a href="../../../c/r/i/Cricket.html" title="Cricket">cricket</a> being another notable example.</p>
