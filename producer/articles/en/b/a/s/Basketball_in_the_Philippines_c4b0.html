<p>Around 1898-1900s, the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">Americans</a>’ <a href="../../../y/o/u/Young_Men%27s_Christian_Association_82ab.html" title="Young Men's Christian Association">Young Men's Christian Association</a> (YMCA) introduced the newly invented sports of "Basketball" in the Philippines. During this period, <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football_%28soccer%29.html" title="Football (soccer)">football (soccer)</a> was the most popular sport in the <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philippine_Islands_44d4.html" title="Philippine Islands">Philippine Islands</a> due to its history as a <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spain.html" title="Spain">Spanish</a> colony (influenced by <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">British</a> sailors from <a href="../../../h/o/n/Hong_Kong_6282.html" title="Hong Kong">Hong Kong</a>), even during the <a href="../../../f/a/r/Far_Eastern_Championship_Games_696e.html" title="Far Eastern Championship Games">Far Eastern Games</a>. Nevertheless, basketball went on to replace soccer (football) with other American sports like <a href="../../../b/a/s/Baseball.html" title="Baseball">baseball</a>.</p>
<p>According to <a href="../../../h/i/s/Historian.html" title="Historian">historian</a> and national artist <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nick_Joaqu%C3%ADn_6f20.html" title="Nick Joaquín">Nick Joaquín</a>, basketball was first introduced to Filipinos within the historic walls of <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intramuros.html" title="Intramuros">Intramuros</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manila.html" title="Manila">Manila</a>.</p>

<p>In 1936, the Philippines played in the <a href="../../../1/9/3/1936_Olympic_Games_08c2.html" title="1936 Olympic Games">Berlin Olympic Games</a> <a href="../../../b/a/s/Basketball_at_the_1936_Summer_Olympics_a823.html" title="Basketball at the 1936 Summer Olympics">basketball tournament</a>, the first time basketball played as an official sports.

The 5th place finish was the best finish by an Asian country in the Olympic Games men’s basketball tournament. If not for controversial rulings, the Philippines could have at least won silver or bronze medal.</p>
<p>In 1938, the <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manila_Industrial_and_Commercial_Athletic_Association_fef3.html" title="Manila Industrial and Commercial Athletic Association">Manila Industrial and Commercial Athletic Association</a> (MICAA) was formed and went on to dominate Philippine basketball for almost 40 years.</p>

The Philippines finished with a 5-2 win-loss record in the Final Round games, and captured the bronze medal.

<p>Before the end of the decade, the country retained the Asian Games basketball gold medal in 1958.

<p>Meanwhile, the Philippines won the right to host the third <a href="../../../f/i/b/FIBA_World_Championship_c25f.html" title="FIBA World Championship">FIBA World Championship</a> but were suspended after then President <a href="../../../d/i/o/Diosdado_Macapagal_abab.html" title="Diosdado Macapagal">Diosdado Macapagal</a>, father of current President <a href="../../../g/l/o/Gloria_Macapagal-Arroyo_5c03.html" title="Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo">Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo</a>, refused to issue visa to players from communist countries (notably basketball powerhouse <a href="../../../y/u/g/Yugoslavia_national_basketball_team.html" title="Yugoslavia national basketball team">Yugoslavia</a> and the <a href="../../../s/o/v/Soviet_Union_ad1f.html" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a>).</p>
<p>In the Asian Games, after Carlos Loyzaga’s retirement, the Philippines' dominance declined but the country continued to play competitively in the Asian and World Championships. While in the Olympic Games, the country played poorly, unable to reach the top 10.</p>
