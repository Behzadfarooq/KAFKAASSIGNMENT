<p>I've updated the page a little. In particular, there is a growing consensus that the basal ganglia has many more roles than just movement related, and I thought that should be expressed. Also added a bit on its history (lots more could be done there). I am planning to add some digital pictures of the anatomy soon, I think that should make anatomically locating them clearer. Comments/complaints welcome.</p>

<dd>Yes. In fact there are many more connections than are shown in the diagram. The diagram is of the classic model of basal ganglia function, as proposed by Albin, Young and Penney (TINS 1989 vol 12:366–375). This model used a simplification of the anatomy of the basal ganglia in order to propose the mechanisms underlying both the normal function of the basal ganglia and the changes that occur in diseases such as Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease. An anatomically correct diagram would not only have a STR-&gt;SNc connection, it would also need (amongst others) cortex-&gt;STN; STN-&gt;GPe; GPe-&gt;GPi; GPe-&gt;SNr; SNc-&gt;STN; and SNc-&gt;GPe. <a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJeremyA_6669.html" title="User:JeremyA">JeremyA</a> <a href="../../../j/e/r/User_talk%7EJeremyA_a1b0.html" title="User talk:JeremyA">(talk)</a> 03:42, 22 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Technically you are correct - there are not supposed to be ganglia in the CNS. But the terms are used interchangeably, and frankly I've heard "basal ganglia" more often than "basal nuclei". <a href="../../../j/f/d/User%7EJfdwolff_9ea6.html" title="User:Jfdwolff">JFW</a>&#160;|&#160;<a href="../../../j/f/d/User_talk%7EJfdwolff_aee2.html" title="User talk:Jfdwolff"><small>T@lk</small></a> 13:10, 31 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>JFW is right. Although there is a small group of people (myself included) who prefer the term "basal nuclei", almost no one in neuroscience refers to them as such. Technically the ganglia of the mesencephalic nucleus of V are located within the CNS, but that is an exception to the rule. <font color="#6D603B">semiconscious</font> (<a href="../../../s/e/m/User_talk%7ESemiconscious_7225.html" title="User talk:Semiconscious"><font color="#6D603B"><small>talk</small></font></a> · <a href="http://socrates.berkeley.edu/~btvoytek" class="external text" title="http://socrates.berkeley.edu/~btvoytek" rel="nofollow"><font color="#6D603B"><small>home</small></font></a>) 21:21, 31 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Terminologia anatomica (1998) the international authority for anatomical naming only retain "nuclei basales" (p.130) but there is a "pars basalis telencephali" p. 129 which comprises the amygdala and many basal ganglia. The term basal ganglia is certainly awkward as the term ganglion (also used for the habenula) should not be used in the central nervous system. The problem is that the delineation of the particular system made up by the GB is relatively recent. It had to be clearly differentiated from other elements such as the thalamus, the amygdala..If a better term could be found and internationally accepted this would be a great improvement. For the moment there is an active International Basal Ganglia Society IBAGS dealing with cerebral parts and systems for which there is a consensus. This comprises the striatum, pallidum (2nuclei), substantia nigra and nucleus subthalamicus, to which I add the central complex (centre median parafascicular) and probably the pedunculopontine complex. This ensemble must not be seen as a collection but as a major cerebral system. <a href="../../../g/e/r/User%7EGerard.percheron_e128.html" title="User:Gerard.percheron">User: Gerard.percheron</a> perchero@ccr.jussieu.fr</li>

<p>I have reverted the extensice recent changes to this article because I think that they are written at too complex a level for the general audience of wikipedia.

By all means correct any factual errors, or update the articles as you see fit, however keep in mind that you are not talking to a scientific audience, so you have to be very careful to use clear wording, define any terms, and link these terms to other WP articles.

<p>Im a med student, and in lectures, the basal ganglia's constituents were grouped differently to the way they are grouped in the article. Is this article correct?

<p>This is the proof that the usual descriptions are wrong. The thalamus is an output not a part of the BG. No one today considers the lentiform nucleus or the corpus striatum or neostriatum. Wake up! <a href="../../../g/e/r/User%7EGerard.percheron_e128.html" title="User:Gerard.percheron">User:gerard.percheron</a></p>
<p>In the wikipedia arborescence you find: striatum (caudate nucleus, putamen) (comment they are one single thing), lentiform nucleus (putamen, globus pallidus) (comment they have nothing in common), <a href="../../../c/l/a/Claustrum.html" title="Claustrum">claustrum</a> (this has never been considered as belonging to the basal ganglia), <a href="../../../e/x/t/Extreme_capsule.html" title="Extreme capsule">extreme capsule</a> (even not a neuronal ensemble), <a href="../../../a/m/y/Amygdala.html" title="Amygdala">amygdala</a> (this also is not and has never been considered as belonging to the basal ganglia), <a href="../../../n/u/c/Nucleus_accumbens.html" title="Nucleus accumbens">nucleus accumbens</a>( which is only a part of the striatum). In the same time there is no mention of the substantia nigra!!!!!!!! or of the <a href="../../../s/u/b/Subthalamic_nucleus.html" title="Subthalamic nucleus">subthalamic nucleus</a>!!. With such a base there will be no satisfactory description of the basal ganglia system. <a href="../../../g/e/r/User%7EGerard.percheron_e128.html" title="User:Gerard.percheron">User:gerard.percheron</a></p>

<p>If you consider that works published in the 80s are original then I think that your encyclopedia is simply a compendium of past believes. With Malcom Carpenter and John McKenzie we founded in 1983 the International Basal Ganglia Society of which I have been the President for a three years term. Every three years there is a book on the basal ganglia system. If the scientific community (or badly educated students or clinicians) does not follow us this is a pity. This is probably partly our fault. However others should accept simple data that make clearer and simplify the description of the system. Sincerely. User:Gerard.Percheron</p>
