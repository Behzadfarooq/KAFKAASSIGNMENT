<p>REHupa published Image:Nyumbani.gif in a fanzine from 1978, that is where the original image appeared. Which is why the organization was given as a reference. The map was reproduced here <a href="http://www.dodgenet.com/~moonblossom/Iatlas.html" class="external free" title="http://www.dodgenet.com/~moonblossom/Iatlas.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.dodgenet.com/~moonblossom/Iatlas.html</a> and this was my source.

<dd>The problem was not that you didn't list a source (you did), but that you claimed without evidence that the copyright holder had relinquished all rights to it. You have to assume that all rights are reserved unless there is <b>explicit</b> written permission by the copyright holder. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStevenj_40e5.html" title="User:Stevenj">—Steven G.

<dd>What could you change it to? The problem is that the image is copyrighted and probably unusable to Wikipedia.

<dd>Seeing as there is about a seven day wait in this matters how about I email REHupa and ask them for their permission to use the image? I'm pretty sure I can get the author of the Imaro novels to give his permission for its use as well.

See: <a href="../../../b/o/i/Wikipedia%7EBoilerplate_request_for_permission_3446.html" title="Wikipedia:Boilerplate request for permission">Wikipedia:Boilerplate request for permission</a>. Realize, however, that you must get the permission of the <i>copyright holder</i>, which is probably not REHupa if they republished the map from a book, and may not even be the book author since it could be the publisher that holds the copyright to the illustrations. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStevenj_40e5.html" title="User:Stevenj">—Steven G.

<p>Hey, thanks for your help on the <a href="../../../t/o/p/Toph.html" title="Toph">Toph</a> article, but some general advice for any Wiki editing: please use the "Show preview" button more. I noticed that you tested out the different sizes of Toph's picture, which is fine except you saved each test. This adds unnecessary entries into the article's History, possibly cluttering the database, too. So just a suggestion to keep things efficient, Preview is your friend. =) --<a href="../../../c/r/i/User%7ECrisu_ca1c.html" title="User:Crisu">Crisu</a> 22:21, 6 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>While it is a bot, this was not a true false positive. The problem is that, in converting the page to a redirect, you did not correctly format the redirect. The bot recognizes some of the more common mal-formed redirects, but it's impossible to predict every single way someone could mess up a redirect. And if the redirect is not correct, and not one of the bad redirects that the bot does recognize, then as far as the bot is concerned, the page has simply been nearly blanked, which is one of the most common forms of vandalism. Anyway, the page is now a correctly formatted redirect, so that is taken care of, and I have struck the above warning, as vandalism was obviously not the intent here.

<p>Hiya, <a href="../../../b/a/s/User%7EBasique_8925.html" title="User:Basique">Basique</a>. Good catch if the Panther wasn't the first Black superhero. (I know he wasn't the first Black series star in American comics -- the earliest known so far is Dell Western character Lobo, who had his own namesake series.) I haven't been able to track down any earlier Black superheroes in mainstream American comics. (What little I've been able to find re: <i>All-Negro Comics</i> has been vague as to superpowers, and that was a niche publisher anyway.)</p>

<dd>Hey Tenebrae, I inherited the unlucky task of updating <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_black_superheroes.html" title="List of black superheroes">List of black superheroes</a>, and while updating it my research brought to me to black newspaper strips from the 1920's and 1930's that had their own two fisted heroes. The Panther is the first "Modern" black hero though, so you could use that. I'm also thinking of changing this page's name to "Black superheroes in comics". --<a href="../../../b/a/s/User%7EBasique_8925.html" title="User:Basique">Basique</a> 14:50, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Many of the cases you edit are well established LGBT characters (which stands for <a href="../../../l/e/s/Lesbian.html" title="Lesbian"><b>L</b>esbian</a>, <a href="../../../g/a/y/Gay.html" title="Gay"><b>G</b>ay</a>, <a href="../../../b/i/s/Bisexuality.html" title="Bisexuality"><b>B</b>isexual</a>, or <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transgender.html" title="Transgender"><b>T</b>ransgendered</a>). I'd encourage you to read up on those categories to educate yourself on what they stand for and how they may apply to the characters.

<dd>First comment on my page in the correct order. Second If you are incapable of justifying an LGBT link with proven history, you don't get to spam that category. Spamming a cat just to build up your page is not the Wikipedia way, you need a lot more justification than your personal feeling that a character is gay, if it wasn't on teh page in black and white it doesn't get the cat, if you continue to put this category on pages where it does not belong, I will push for a review of the validity the category.--<a href="../../../b/a/s/User%7EBasique_8925.html" title="User:Basique">Basique</a> 23:39, 15 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Many of the characters you removed have their LGBT history detailed right on the character page. And yet you still remove them from the category. Do you dispute what the article says? It'd also be helpful for you to check the discussion page in many of those instances to see what other users have to say about what is apparently a contentious topic. Some in particular, like Captain Metropolis, has two sources right in the article referencing the character's LGBT status. That doesn't seem to stop your rampage. Are you going by this in gut feeling? P.S. Please stop assigning ulterior motives to me and I won't do the same to you. <a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPerceive_ed7e.html" title="User:Perceive">Perceive</a> 23:54, 15 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well what's interesting about that history in the case of Jenny Sparks, Hooded Justice and Captain Metropolis is that it was inserted by you. That's all the proof I need to bring that Cat up for review. You skewed the character histories using undocumented speculation.

<dd>I never edited the biography of Jenny Sparks, Hooded History or Captain Metropolis. I was not the original one who put them in the LGBT category either. The only one I edited prior to today was Jenny Sparks, apparently to make her name fit in the "heroes without costumes" and "heroes without aliases" category in the alphabetical order of her last name.

<p>Hi Basique, didn't mean to offend when correcting the creator credits on Helix (Marvel Comics character). It's understandable you would assume the character was created by DeFalco and Frenz since Helix's first appearance was in their title; it's an assumption other sources on the Web have made too due to a lack of proper creator credit provided in the issue in question. However the reality is that Helix was created by the New Warriors creative team of that time (Skolnick and Zircher) for ongoing use in their own title. However due to a lack of in-print crediting this is difficult to "verify" by Wiki standards, and so it seems like this erroneous crediting will continue to be repeated.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well we go by print credit, so erroneous or not his first recorded appearance in Maximum Clonage Alpha. Unless you can provide at least one verifiable reference showing Skolnick as the character's creator, credit will stay with the Clonage team. --<a href="../../../b/a/s/User%7EBasique_8925.html" title="User:Basique">Basique</a> 17:27, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Spiderfan.org was already cited as a legitimate resource on the page... now suddenly it's just a "blog"? In any case it's the only source on the web that lists ANY creators for this character. The others you've cited simply list a creative team for the issue STORY. Unless you can find at least one verifiable reference specifically listing any "Helix created by" credit that contradicts this, it should stand. --Get it write 03:46, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Listen I didn't call it a blog, I wrote what I did because it is not a good enough source for creator credit that contradicts the creator credit <b>in the actual printed book</b>. If there was no actual writer's credit on the book then we could use Skolnick, but the book has a writer hence Skolnick does not get creator's credit.
