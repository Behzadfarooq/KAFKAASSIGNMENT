<p>I don't know where to post this: while there was considerable overlap between pulp and comics illustrators, I'm not aware of Finlay as a comics artist, and you posted him as part of the comics project. Would you mind pointing me to where he's discussed as that?

<p>It's a coincidence of timing. When people have similar interests, they will inherently wind up editing some of the same pages on multiple occasions. Whenever pages on my watchlist pop up as having been edited, I peek at what's happening. Had I noticed the time on your edits, I'd have realized you were editing right at that particular moment and would have checked it some other time.</p>
<p>But again, you're just too ready to talk about taking issues to other people. There was no reason for you to talk about bringing in anybody else. Just ask a person a question. Remember, you asked people to take a look at the prison page on the WikiProject Comics discussion page, so don't be surprised when some of those who check it out stay interested. Remember also, I backed you up in your disagreement with JC-whatever number he/she/it is.</p>
<p>Anyway, like I said, if I'd noticed you were editing at that moment, I wouldn't have risked edit conflicts, which just waste people's time regardless. <a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoczilla_1c36.html" title="User:Doczilla">Doczilla</a> 21:12, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Interesting title. That conflict was resolved quite some time ago, in fact you saw it resolved. My watchlist is empty so i can't really empathize. Requesting an arbritator in a situation where I feel uncomfortable is entirely my prerogative, and one I exercise when and if I so choose. A question was asked, and you answerd it. My concerns were voiced so now you understand them, I trust there will be no further "edit conflicts" between us. --<a href="../../../b/a/s/User%7EBasique_8925.html" title="User:Basique">Basique</a> 21:33, 2 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Of course there can be edit conflicts. It just happens sometimes. So what? Who seriously looks at the exact minute the last person made a contribution every single time they edit an article?
<p>On a separate note: If you actually want a person to read what you say to them, say it on their own talk page. The only reason I knew to check here for your reply to me this one time was that, when I came to post my previous reply, I noticed what you said to Wryspy (check spelling) above. I find it hard to think anyone regularly checks someone else's talk page. <a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoczilla_1c36.html" title="User:Doczilla">Doczilla</a> 21:39, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm not a bot. Putting "Yeah. It's Chris. Used to wear the toilet bowl helmet 'n' all. I'm in the middle of his story now" in the ref line appears as an unconstructive edit, and probably belongs on the talk page for the article. Nonetheless, I assumed good faith and only reverted the edit, along with a "test 1" notice. The text simply seemed out of place (and it was). Unfortunately, during RC patrolling, we won't always know when a user isn't finished with an edit, so it's generally best to use the "preview" function unless you're satisfied that the edit is constructive. Again, no malice was assumed or intended by the revert. Regards. <a href="../../../s/k/e/User%7ESkerHawx_2728.html" title="User:SkerHawx">SkerHawx</a> 13:47, 4 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Don't remove the cleanup tag again, until it's actually cleaned up. It's alot of bulleted lists still: that's clutter. When only a small part of the article isn't a list, that's a problem.

<p>Hi I just reverted your edit that changed the position of the New Universe series infobox and I figured I'd give you my reasons so that there would be no hard feelings.</p>
<p>The infobox was originally where you put it, but there was a problem. Some editors saw the infobox at the beginning and began changing the opening to talk only about the New Universe series when most of the articles is about the Star Brand after that series ended. I moved it to where it is now to avoid this confusion.</p>
<p>I believe it should be where it is as its the best way to avoid this confusion in the future.</p>
<p>There is also the fact that that is the section that directly talks about the informtion in that infobox. Thanks for your time&#160;:-) <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephen_Day_d3f3.html" title="User:Stephen Day">Stephen Day</a> 04:56, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, Basique! When you get a chance, would you review the documentation for {{<a href="../../../t/a/l/Template%7ETalkheader_069e.html" title="Template:Talkheader">Talkheader</a>}}? Specifically, it should only be used on talk pages that are very active or have had policy violation problems, and should not be added to every talk page. In particular, it should not be added to otherwise empty talk pages. Thanks for all your work - I noticed from your edit history that you're quite active!

<p>Fair enough.</p>
<p>I assume you are talking about the Jihad/Onslaught article? If so, my apologies. I saw the change to Nightshade and got curious and the Roman numerals/succession is a bit of a personal pet peeve.</p>

<dd>Oh and lets understand each other, I'm not getting into a revert war with you just because you don't understand how to balance an article. But I will contest any change you make that damages the integrity of a Wikipedia article. I've just looked through your entire contribution history and this seems to be a trend with you. Disharmonious behavior until sufficiently chastised or blocked.

<p>That just may be. It's kind of hard to tell since it looks like the editor is in a situation, by choice or lack there of, where s/he is subject to a "wandering" IPA.</p>
<p>Apparent <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">WP:OWN</a> issues aside, I really find the editor's attitude that an IPA edit doesn't need an "Edit summary" very frustrating. But s/he isn't the only one, there's at least one editor with a stable IPA who does the same thing when he doesn't log in.</p>
<p>As a side note... is there a problem with the Wiki auto log in on some browsers? (Asked since you tend to edit under both an IPA and an account, even going to the extent of redirecting the IPA talk page.)</p>

<dd>I'm a security nut I have Firefox set to autowipe everything when I close my window. And since I pre-build my pages in the text editor on my PDA, laptop or HTPC, I usually only log in to build a new page or upload an image. I remember every page I've ever built, edited or lurked at, so I don't have to log in and check a Watch page. --<a href="../../../b/a/s/User%7EBasique_8925.html" title="User:Basique">Basique</a> 02:44, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
