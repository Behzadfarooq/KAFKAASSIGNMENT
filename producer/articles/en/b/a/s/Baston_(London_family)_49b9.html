<p><b>Bastons in London</b> from 1790</p>
<p>There are three possible explanations for the origins of the English Surname “BASTON”.</p>
<p>The spelling Bacstune and Bastune appear in the Domesday Book and the “ton” ending was in use in England by 1188. In the first instance, the name may be of local origin; being one of those names where a man once lived or where he held land. In this case it could be based on the village of <a href="../../../b/a/s/Baston.html" title="Baston">Baston</a> in <a href="../../../l/i/n/Lincolnshire.html" title="Lincolnshire">Lincolnshire</a>. From the “Dictionary of Lincolnshire Place Names” Baston is described as an Anglo-Danish personal name hybrid and probably represents an earlier <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglo-Saxons_e82f.html" title="Anglo-Saxons">Anglo Saxon</a> settlement taken over and partially renamed by the Danes.</p>
<p>Alternatively, another explanation is that the name originated in the area of <a href="../../../p/o/i/Poitiers.html" title="Poitiers">Poitiers</a> in <a href="../../../p/o/i/Poitou.html" title="Poitou">Paitou</a>, France where a Martin Baston and a Thomas Baston are first recorded as living in the town of Parthenay. The Chateau “L’Age Baston” was founded in 1309 (built in the time of the Bastons) and can be found in La Rochefoucauld, Charente, France and is described as being full of charm and character, with its own courtyards and grounds standing within 20 acres.</p>
<p>It might well be the family came over from France as part of the French <a href="../../../h/u/g/Huguenot.html" title="Huguenot">Huguenot</a> exodus to England to escape from religious oppression of the time.</p>
<p>Finally, the explanation may refer to a person’s occupation or some physical character or type. It appears that the origin of the name in this case may refer to the French word for stick being “baton” with the origin being linked to a profession which made or used a stick, a spear carrier or fence maker for instance. This theory may also be backed up by the Spanish word for a stick being “bastone” and the Italian word for a stick-like thin finger biscuit being a “bastoncini”. Baston is also the named used for a form of martial art using sticks used throughout Europe and a breed of mountain dog. I have also come across a war game called “Baston”.</p>
<p>There appear to be four distinct Baston families in London in the early 1800’s and it was only too easy to see a name and think it was one of the family tree, but by careful research, I have, I hope, eliminated all the red herrings. The various Baston families are ours, who are shown as living in Whitechapel, Shoreditch and Southwark who originate from Oxfordshire; a Joseph &amp; Emma Baston also in the Shoreditch area from about 1835 who originated from Nottinghamshire and was a brewer by trade: a John &amp; Mary Baston in the Pancras area, originating from Bristol and formerly Devon arrived about 1840, who were tin plate workers with a very large extended family, and finally; a John Baston who originated from Truro, Cornwall who first appeared in London in about 1875 when he married a Charlotte Collis in St Marks Church, Old Street in 1878, he was also a Cordwainer, just to make matters more difficult.</p>
<p>The name Baston is first recorded in the Bampton, Oxfordshire parish with a “Walter Baston” living at Claywell Farm, Ducklington near Whitney. There is also a widow Baston and a William Baston both recorded in the Oxfordshire Hearth Tax Tax records for the Aston and Cote Parish in 1665, proving residence within the parish and having property of value.</p>
<p>There are still families of Baston’s and Bassons living at Ducklington, Witney and Ashton today. However, we do lose several generations before we come to a John Baston (or Basson) who is recorded at St Mary’s Church, Bampton as being married to Elizabeth Thatcher in 1526.</p>
<p>Bampton also has a connection with France in that in 1069 King William 1 (the Conqueror) granted seven “hides of land” free of taxes to Leofric, Bishop of Exeter for “the good of the Church and the Community. Later, Henry II (William’s son) also visited Bampton and was present at a dedication in the church, Bampton’s prosperity in the Middle Ages being based on the making and sale of gloves, sheepskin jerkins and gaiters. Witney is still famous for its blanket manufacture.</p>
<p>Provisional research shows that a William Baston, born about 1680 and had a William Baston christened in Bampton in 1704. This William then had a son Jonathan Baston christened in 1739, this Jonathan is probably our direct ancestor.</p>
<p>The fully documented proven tree so far for the Baston’s of Hackney, Shoreditch, Whitechapel and Southwark goes back to when Jonathan Baston married an Ann Crips in June 1761 at Bampton. Our Francis was their first child and was baptised in December of the same year. Francis Baston married an Ann Smith in 1782 at Ipsden, Oxfordshire. There is a record of Francis’ burial at Bunhill Fields Cemetery, Whitechapel in 1813 age 52. Francis &amp; Ann Baston had a son John in 1783 who was christened at Checkendon, Oxfordshire and they then, according to the rest of the Oxfordshire family historians disappeared from the area.</p>
<p>The first record of Francis &amp; Ann Baston in London is on the Baptism Register at St Leonard’s Church, Shoreditch, when a George Thomas Baston was baptised there in 1796. There was also a Joseph Baston born in 1799, but the only record, is of his burial at Bunhill Fields Cemetery, aged 11 months in 1800.</p>
<p>The names Francis &amp; Ann Baston appear on John Joseph Baston’s Baptism record at St Leonard’s Church, Shoreditch in 1802. The name Francis Baston also appears in the Marriage Register when John Joseph Baston married Mary Ann Browne in 1827 at Christ Church, Blackfriars Road, Southwark, but this cannot be his father, but is probably his brother Francis who was married 1810 at St Mary’s Church Islington and who died in 1828 and was buried in Christ Church, Spitalfields. John’s brother William James Baston also married into the same Browne family when he married Ann Browne. John &amp; Mary then appear in the Registers at Christ Church, Spitalfields, first for the Baptism of Mary Ann Baston in 1828 and then again for Frederick William Baston in 1831. John is shown in both cases as a Painter.</p>
<p>The next record found mentioning Frederick is in the 1841 census for 6 Little Suffolk Street, Southwark where he is shown as aged 10, not with any of the family but living with a Mary Cole. His mother, Mary died in 1832, 7 months after he was baptised, his father may have died as well, as I can find no trace of him after the baptism of his son in 1831, the name Mary Cole appeared on the marriage certificate of John &amp; Mary in 1827 as a witness, so she was probably a family friend and guardian and is shown as living in the next street to John Joseph Baston at her baptism. Frederick next appears in the 1851 census aged 20 when he was a Boot Maker’s Apprentice to a Mr Tandy, Master Boot Maker, at 10 Essex Street, Shoreditch. He is shown as unmarried, but by 1855 his first child; also called Frederick was born to Mary Ann Baston, nee Sayers, his wife. As yet, I have been unable to find a record of the marriage of Frederick Baston to Mary Ann Sayers. The names of Frederick and Mary are shown on the young Frederick’s death certificate as alas, he died 16th March 1855 aged 10 weeks. Frederick (1831) appears on the 1861, 1871, 1881 and 1891 Census’. Thomas, our direct ancestor was their fourth child and was born 15th August 1862 first appearing on the 1871 Census. Frederick and Mary had 8 known children although there may still be some to find. Frederick William died 3rd July 1899 aged 68 years; his wife Mary died less than a year later on the 20th February 1900. Incidentally, there is a design of shoe still being sold today called a “Baston”.</p>
<p>Thomas also became a Boot maker, probably learning from his father and he appears on the 1871, 1881, 1891 and 1901 Census’. Thomas married Sarah Noble 16th May 1881 St Thomas’ Church, Bethnal Green. Frederick was their 2nd child born 9th August 1885. Thomas died quite young 5th July 1903 aged 40.</p>
<p>Frederick broke the family tradition by becoming a “Wood Worker Cabinet” aged 15 according to the 1901 census for 16 Victoria Grove Hackney. He married Emma Euesden 25th December 1908 and they had 2 children, Frederick John, born 18th March 1911 and Alice Emily born 29th August 1913. Alice Emily died aged 9 months 25th June 1914. Frederick joined the army 23rd June 1915 with the 8th Battalion, Royal Fusiliers and fought in the Great War 1914 – 1918. Frederick fell at the Battle of the Somme 7th July 1916 and is interred at the Ovillers Military Cemetery in France. His name appears in the roll of honour on the War Graves Commission web site.</p>
<p>Frederick John Baston, the only surviving child from the marriage of Frederick &amp; Emma, married Clara Lilian May, 17th September 1939 just before his call-up into the Second World War 1939 – 1943. Gratefully he survived the war and had 3 children, Roger John Baston, Carol Anne Baston and Martyn John Baston.</p>
<p>Roger John Baston married Velma Elaine Bissett 2nd February 1963 and they had two children, Stuart John Baston in 1964 and Denise Ann Baston 1966.</p>
<p>Stuart John Baston married Elizabeth Sarah Pegrum in June 1991 and from this marriage Jane Louise born 1997 and Adam Luke John born 1999 became the latest members of the Baston Family.</p>
