<p>I do not think that descriptive prose (other than band memberships) belongs in the bassists index - that material belongs in the relevant entry for the bassist where it can be expanded upon. How would people feel if the descriptive material were removed?</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think it should be included in both places. I think putting descriptive material here helps to keep the addition of "everyone who ever picked up a bass" to a minimum. Then again, we might consider keeping only a few key notable figures here and moving the rest to a <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_bassists.html" title="List of bassists">List of bassists</a> or <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_bass_guitarists.html" title="List of bass guitarists">List of bass guitarists</a>... — <a href="../../../c/a/t/User%7ECatherineMunro_0200.html" title="User:CatherineMunro">Catherine</a>\<sup><a href="../../../c/a/t/User_talk%7ECatherineMunro_06c5.html" title="User talk:CatherineMunro">talk</a></sup> 03:41, 3 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I prefer this page to the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_bass_guitarists.html" title="List of bass guitarists">List of bass guitarists</a>. I think <b>short</b> descriptive text helps the reader; otherwise you're left with a list of names that is effectively anonymous unless you're already well versed in the pantheon of famous bassists and thus able to mentally add your own descriptions to each name. Of course, short is the operative word - if someone wants to go into detail about a bassist's career they should edit the appropriate page. Perhaps the other page could be redirected to the appropriate section here or at least have a crosslink and be reserved for a names only list? <a href="../../../b/a/s/User%7EBasswulf_56fc.html" title="User:Basswulf">Basswulf</a> 07:27, 3 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<dd>By all means, add or delete from the short list I left if you disagree with my choices, but I think this bit should remain fairly small, no more than a dozen or so names -- everything else should go on the other list. Ideally, perhaps, this short list should be converted to prose paragraphs discussing their influence; it would not only explain their importance better, it would discourage people from idly adding another name to the list, but I don't feel I'm widely enough versed in music to do it justice.

<dd>I'm torn. You've done an excellent job of properly alphabetising and laying out the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_bass_guitarists.html" title="List of bass guitarists">list of bass guitarists</a>. On the other hand, how do you select who to include in the short list on the <a href="../../../b/a/s/Bassist.html" title="Bassist">Bassist</a> page? Some names, like <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jaco_Pastorius_bac7.html" title="Jaco Pastorius">Jaco Pastorius</a> and <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Jamerson_046c.html" title="James Jamerson">James Jamerson</a> are probably beyond dispute but it quickly gets fuzzy! I'd rather see the style of formatting for the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_bass_guitarists.html" title="List of bass guitarists">list of bass guitarists</a> used here (including a lot more people but perhaps with the stipulation that each should have a <i>short</i> descriptive text) and keep the other page for a names-only list that functions more as an index rather than giving any explanatory text. I also think that both lists would be improved by weeding out anybody who doesn't have at least a stub article of their own. <a href="../../../b/a/s/User%7EBasswulf_56fc.html" title="User:Basswulf">Basswulf</a> 15:21, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree that it's a fuzzy thing. I feel fairly strongly that the list should remain on a separate page, or it overwhelms the rest of the content on this page. The list is only going to grow longer as more people writing about their favorite bands discover the list; I think it was overdue for sectioning by alphabet which would only further overwhelm this page and its table of contents.</dd>

Why is the acoustic bass left out? The fact that it's said (a few times) that electric bass/double bass are the instruments that define a bassist it's like acoustic bass players don't come into this category.

<p>Hi folks, I think the description of 'Electric Bassists' is a bit narrow. They're not always introverts. Motorhead's bassist would be a good example of a band leader. They can write songs (Paul McCartney (Beatles), John Deacon (Queen), Roger Waters (Pink Floyd), Cliff Burton (Metallica)...), they can contribute lyrically (Nicky Wire (Manic Street Preachers)). The description makes a generalistaion that is not necessarily true in all cases.</p>

<p>I've just removed <a href="../../../l/e/s/Les_Claypool_738b.html" title="Les Claypool">Les Claypool</a> from the <i>Electric Bass and Double Bass</i> section of the page. As far as I know (including checking out the extensive article about him) he plays <a href="../../../b/a/s/Bass_guitar.html" title="Bass guitar">bass guitar</a> and is not at all known for his work on <a href="../../../d/o/u/Double_bass.html" title="Double bass">double bass</a>. Therefore, he belongs in the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_bass_guitarists.html" title="List of bass guitarists">list of bass guitarists</a> and not on the list of doublers. I'm getting a little frustrated because it really doesn't seem all that hard to make the distinction!</p>
<p>Of course, I may well be wrong. Mr Claypool may also have released a whole slew of albums on which he plays bluegrass upright bass and I'd love to know about that.

Somebody like <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Patitucci_a275.html" title="John Patitucci">John Patitucci</a> belongs there because he regularly performs on both <a href="../../../d/o/u/Double_bass.html" title="Double bass">double bass</a> and <a href="../../../b/a/s/Bass_guitar.html" title="Bass guitar">bass guitar</a>.

<p>Claypool, I think you can argue, doubles at least a little, but on record, we're mostly talking about little things like "Seas of Cheese" on "<a href="../../../s/a/i/Sailing_the_Seas_of_Cheese_195c.html" title="Sailing the Seas of Cheese">Sailing the Seas of Cheese</a>". I've seen him play it a little live, as well, but I think he's something like 80% an electric player. He is a player of some historic magnitude and, as such, maybe he belongs on the list, but <a href="../../../f/l/e/Flea_%28musician%29.html" title="Flea (musician)">Flea</a> and a misspelled <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jaco_Pastorius_bac7.html" title="Jaco Pastorius">Jaco</a>?

<dl>
<dd>I think the criteria for someone to belong in the list of doublers is that they have have a wikipedia article devoted to them that makes clear that they play both instruments. The name of the game is accurate information, not just posting the name of your favourite bassist in as many places as possible. <a href="../../../b/a/s/User%7EBasswulf_56fc.html" title="User:Basswulf">Basswulf</a> 10:07, 3 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

This article and each of the lists should have prominent links to all the other lists.

<dd>I like the idea of sourcing the list of influencial bassists, but I dislike the idea of ripping off someone else's list wholesale, especially one published 13 years ago. I think a better approach would be to let editors complie their own list, but source <i>every entry</i> on the list to a reliable publication that has presented the bassist one of the greatest in his field. It would be more work, but I think it would result in a better list that would be unique to this article.--<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Fat_Man_Who_Never_Came_Back_7df6.html" title="User:The Fat Man Who Never Came Back">The Fat Man Who Never Came Back</a> 08:36, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm not sure what the "Unknown" section is meant to accomplish. If no one knows what someone plays, it seems as though a little research would be appropriate before adding him/her to the list (they also ought to, at minimum, have their own page, it seems to me). If "unknown" is meant to mean something like "the bassist in question is not well-known," it doesn't seem like they belong on this page, which, I believe, is meant to highlight a few of the most prominent players in each category. We have larger, more comprehensive lists of bassists elsewhere; it seems that players who are lower in profile belong on those lists, rather than here. Adbarnhart 18:37, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Does Wikipedia have any information about this? Aside from possibly vocals (which isn't an instrument), bass (and keyboard too in some instances) appears to be the most common instrument taken up by women in rock bands. Talking Heads, Sonic Youth and The Smashing Pumpkins are just a few examples but there are many others. Female drummers are less common and female guitarists outside of all-women bands are rare, with notable exceptions like <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charlotte_Hatherley_a550.html" title="Charlotte Hatherley">Charlotte Hatherley</a>.--<b><a href="../../../h/i/s/User%7EHisSpaceResearch_9ccf.html" title="User:HisSpaceResearch">h i s</a></b> <i><a href="../../../h/i/s/User_talk%7EHisSpaceResearch_e5e1.html" title="User talk:HisSpaceResearch">s p a c e</a></i> <b>r e s e a r c h</b> 22:28, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, female guitarists who are solo artists (i.e. singer songwriters) are more common, but female lead guitarists in rock bands are relatively rare.--<b><a href="../../../h/i/s/User%7EHisSpaceResearch_9ccf.html" title="User:HisSpaceResearch">h i s</a></b> <i><a href="../../../h/i/s/User_talk%7EHisSpaceResearch_e5e1.html" title="User talk:HisSpaceResearch">s p a c e</a></i> <b>r e s e a r c h</b> 22:34, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
