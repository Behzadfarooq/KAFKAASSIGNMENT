	    <p>The Greatest Amateur Basketball Team Ever:</p>
<p>One of the many highlights of the 1960 Rome Olympics, and there were many, was the U.S. Olympic basketball team, composed entirely of collegians and other amateurs. College basketball was producing some of the greatest players in history at this time. The U. of Cincinnati had all-time scorer Oscar Robertson, a shooting-passing swingman who could also rebound missed shots very well at 6'5. He was two-time NCAA Player of the Year. The U. of West Virginia had Jerry West, a near match for Robertson offensively, but also an outstanding defender with 80" of reach. He was 1959 Final Four MVP. Both seniors were named Co-Captains. Indiana offered near-seven footer Walter Bellamy, a tremendous athlete at center. Purdue All-American Terry Dischinger was an outstanding 6'7 shooter. Adrian 'Odie' Smith of the Air Force was a former Kentucky Wildcat, now an Air Force captain. He was also a dead-eye shooting guard. A.A.U. national champion Catapillars of Peoria, Illinois offered former Kansan Bob Boozer, a solid all-around 6'8 forward and athlete. Given that Bellamy, Robertson and West are in the Hall of Fame, and that Smith, Boozer and Dischinger were each NBA all-stars, this alone would be enough to have an impressive roster. But there was more. California's coach Pete Newell was then considered the dean of college coaches. He was tabbed to lead this team a year in advance. His impact as a scout, coach and general manager would be felt in the NBA for the next two plus decades. He's a Hall of Famer too. He also brought his prize project, 6'10 shot blocker Darrall Imhoff, to the team as a backup center. Imhoff would later have a solid NBA career as a starting center. He was a backup only to a center the caliber of Bellamy. Ohio State University had actually routed California with their high-paced offense for the NCAA title in 1960. During the Trials, sophomore forward John Havlichek impressed as the best rebounder and defender among forwards. Amazingly, the future Celtics legend was a final cut for the Olympics. Rated better than Havlichek was 6'3 junior guard Larry Siegfried, Ohio State's captain, who excelled at both guard spots and at both ends of the floor. He was cut also. Shooting guard Mel Nowell, an outstanding scorer, was a Final Four all-star in 1960. Somehow, he never rated a look from the selecting committee. All three Buckeyes would have rated solid additions. The lone Buckeye selected was the U.S. star, 6'9 center Jerry Lucas. All he did was score 27 points per game on 60% shooting, pull down 17 rebounds per game, and anchor Ohio State's nation-leading 91 point-per-game offense with his outlet and high-post passing. Like West, Robertson, Dischinger, and Smith, he could shoot from nearly anywhere, but he could also kill you near the basket with his deadly hook shot. His duels with both Bellamy and Imhoff proved he was the best center on the club. The only sophomore on the team, the 20-year-old phenom would lead America's greatest ever amateur team in scoring, rebounds, and shooting while playing a selfless team-oriented game that drew raves from coach Newell. " He's the greatest player I ever coached." Lucas, a future record-setting NBA forward, was mostly still a center here, with Dischinger, West and Robertson the other key starters. When all four were on the court, West and Robertson often played guard, the positions they would become NBA legends at. The politics of the trial process meant that there were several other A.A.U. players who filled out the roster ahead of the other Buckeyes and other talents who played for a spot on the team. Nonetheless, there was enough talent selected here to make the team legendary.</p>
<p>At the time, basketball was the chief Summer Olympic team sport, and many still believe it is. The America-invented game was the sublect of much debate by the International Olympic committee, who agreed to change facets of the competition so that other countries might have a better chance to medal. The ball was a slippery leather unlike the American ball. Inbounding did not require the ref to touch the ball. Shooting fouls nixed any shot that went in. This figured to confuse the Americans a little. But these were not just any Americans. The bracketing was stacked against the U.S. also. The Soviets, who had the committee ear, led a European group with little resistance. Host Italy somehow led an African group they easily won. Brazil led an average group, while the U.S. had clearly the toughest draw. But it all barely slowed this team at all. Averaging over 100 points per game, and winning by an average of 40 points per game, the U.S. often jetted to an early lead and put in their subs. The U.S. would have to defeat each group winner to get their gold in the curious playoff sequence. This included a full-house match with the Russians, who would pit 7'3 320-pound Jan Kruminsch against Lucas at center. Despite some hesitation from Newell, Lucas took the assignment. His speed, skill and athleticism exposed the Russian as a lumbering giant, and the U.S. team sped to victory. This somehow put them up against Italy next, and then Brazil for the gold. Good as all three opponents were, they never had a chance against these Americans. Noteworthy during the Games was Lucas, a future memory expert, writer and educator. Lucas had learned paragraphs of Italian, Russian and Japanese so that he could converse with his opponents during the Games. It was an act of sportsmanship not lost on many. Lucas shot an amazing 80% for the Games, an all-time Olympic record, and was awarded just six free throws in the entire Games despite absorbing countless elbows near the basket. Either way, his near-stoic expression never changed. He was widely considered the Olympic MVP of these Games. Lucas, in fact, is probably the greatest U.S. player ever, which adds to his rare high school, college and pro legend. But his selfless game allowed several other teammates to make solid contributions as well. It truly was a team victory.</p>
<p>At the time, more than a few suggested keeping the group intact and turning them pro together to take on the vaunted Boston Celtics in the NBA. Lucas, Robertson, Boozer and Smith did play together as Cincinnati Royals, but Boozer was inexplicably traded before that team could win their NBA title. Still, the idea of a Bellamy - Lucas - Dischinger - West - Robertson starting five, with Boozer, Smith and Imhoff among the reserves, and Pete Newell as coach, might have had the chance to become the greatest team ever on any level. Too bad we will never know for sure. But, in 1960, they collectively owned the world basketball stage, and would carry the game forward as pros over the next two decades. A reunion of sorts took place when Lucas, West and Robertson were inducted in the Basketball Hall of Fame in Springfield, Massachussetts in 1980. More than forty years later, this team is still legendary.</p>
