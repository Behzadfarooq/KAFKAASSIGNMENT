<p>luck????</p>
<p>I have been playing baseball stars for years. i no longer use my old NES, but rather, i have it downloaded on my computer using nesticle.</p>
<p>i have a question that has boggled me and my friends ever since we started playing it way back when...</p>
<p>What does 'luck' actually do? i mean, i can't figure it out. A player with 0 luck seems no different that a player with 15 luck. Does anyone out there know? Is it just a filler? <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMasterhatch_66e9.html" title="User:Masterhatch">Masterhatch</a></p>
<p>How is the spelling chance from defence to defense not necessary? 12.34.246.4 18:23, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>There is currently a revert war going on here. I believe that your edits were correct, and I am defending them. For many reasons, american spelling should prevail. Baseball is an american game, and the spelling within the game is american. If reverting continues, I will file an RFC for a greater scope of consensus. As it stands, it's 2 (me &amp; you) to 1. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThemindset_22b6.html" title="User:Themindset">Themindset</a> 20:18, 25 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>LOL it looks like you are looking for a war! funny. anyways, i really don't care enough. By the way, your reasoning that since baseball is an american sport, this article should use american spelling still doesn't hold water. Hockey is a Canadian sport but (as i have pointed out before) there are dozens and dozens of articles here on wiki that use American spelling in hockey articles. I was just holding onto the idea that the original article's spelling is the spelling to be used throughout. I am always on the lookout for bad and useless edits and I have always considered an edit to merely change from one style of spelling to another a useless and bad edit. I don't really care enough, but if you really want a war, i can play the game with you. Have a good day and happy hunting! <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMasterhatch_66e9.html" title="User:Masterhatch">Masterhatch</a> 20:32, 25 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>sorry about my overly negative comments. I have had a bad day and it i found it rather annoying that someone would so quickly call for an RFC before a proper discussion took place. It just seemed that you were out looking for a war. I apologise. <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMasterhatch_66e9.html" title="User:Masterhatch">Masterhatch</a> 20:38, 25 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Understood. If you are suggesting that we discus the edits before reverting them... yours was the first revert. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThemindset_22b6.html" title="User:Themindset">Themindset</a> 21:32, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, mine was the first revert, but i was reverting back to status quo. I don't see your point in telling me that i reverted first as I was just reverting unneccessary editing and reverting back to status quo. Logically, it would have been your revert that would have needed discussing, not mine. You shouldn't have reverted it back until a discussion was completed (since you are the one who was so quick to jump to RFC). I have been involved in enough disputes here on Wikipedia to know that usually status quo is held until an agreement is made. But, like I said, i really don't care that much. <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMasterhatch_66e9.html" title="User:Masterhatch">Masterhatch</a> 22:43, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I re-read the article and even though i was one of the principle authors, i admit that this article needs a lot of work. For example, this paragraph
<dl>
<dd>"The graphics themselves are simple and the music can be a bit annoying, but the game itself is almost perfect in a simple kind of way. The pitching is simple: curve balls, fast balls, off speed pitches, and sinkers. The batting is a simple swing on a level plane. Gamers don't have to worry about swinging up or swinging down; just swing. The fielding, though, is the best. It is very realistic in that if the ball is catchable or gettable, it can be caught or got. The programming does not put the fielders in strange positions and they always seem to be in the right spot, especially the out-fielders. The in-fielders are a bit different, though. When there is a man on base, they do the "shift" to prevent extra base hits down the line. This can be annoying at times as it opens up holes between the in-fielders. The ability to control the shift would make the game a little better."</dd>

<dd>is written with POV language and needs to be re-written. There are other examples too of POV writing. I suppose if the article was cleaned up a bit, i wouldn't have a problem with it being featured.

<p>Overall, i would say it reads much better now. I do have two concerns, though. If this gets suggested as a featured article, people are going to come in and pick the entire article apart. For most of the article, this won't be a problem, but the section about the cheats might be viewed as POV. Much of that entire section of the article might get gutted. Also, some people might suggest that there aren't enough sources to back up the article. Personally I think it is a great article and I would love to see it as a featured article. <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMasterhatch_66e9.html" title="User:Masterhatch">Masterhatch</a> 02:40, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>They <i>will</i> find all kinds of problems, and that's fine. I don't think the cheats are POV, they are cheats. And I don't think we need to worry about sources, I mean the game itself is the source, and I've played it many many times, as I believe you have. I'm going to give it a once over, and then suggest it for peer review... <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThemindset_22b6.html" title="User:Themindset">Themindset</a> 03:58, 13 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>When i came to Wikipedia back in June of 2005, i was still new to the whole concept of how wikipedia works and so when i added and re-wrote much of this article way back when, I could have done a better job. Themindset, you have done a wonderful job at cleaning up this article. Thanks! Oh, and yes, i am an avid fan of baseball stars and i have been playing it for over 15 years. It is the only baseball game that i have never gotten bored of. I guess you never figured out what luck did either, eh? <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMasterhatch_66e9.html" title="User:Masterhatch">Masterhatch</a> 19:22, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It can take a long time to build up a team playing game after game after game. This process can be greatly sped up by "cheating". First, make a new team and then fire all the players with a "max" less than 80. Then spend all of the allotted money on $5000 rookies with a max over 80. Next, make a two team season set at 25 games and make sure that both teams are player controlled. Set it up so that your team pitches first. Send nine pitches down the middle of the plate striking out all three batters. Then, take control of the pitching for the other team and hit (bean-ball) each batter until 10 runs cross the plate. This ends the game in less than two minutes and the winning team gets all the cash. The best team to do this with is the Lovely Ladies (as they have the highest prestige of all preset teams). Do this a few times and make sure only rookies are purchased with a max greater than 80 and a superstar team will be born!</p>

<p>There is a way to get a $999,999,000 pitcher without buying him. First, hire a $5,000 rookie with a max over 80. Next, use the "traditional cheat" to acquire lots of money. Power up the pitcher as normal, but <i>do not</i> put any money on prestige or batting abilities. Leave prestige at "0". After the pitcher is full (except for prestige and batting abilities), go to his "batting abilities" and power up the prestige. When the prestige is full on the batting side, the prestige will automatically fill up on the pitcher side too. And voila, you have a pitcher with a max of 90 worth $999,999,000. This method is much cheaper than spending $2,980,000 on a superstar.</p>
<p>This also works on the reverse. If a pitcher is desired who can really hit (with a max of up to 67), do just the opposite. Hire a $5000 rookie pitcher. Most $5000 rookie pitchers have a batting max of between 46 and 52. Fill up the batting (but don't touch prestige) abilities first. Then, go to the pitching abilities and fill up prestige. This will give his batting abilities 15 more max points. If the pitcher's max batting abilities started out at 52, then the added 15 will bring him up to 67.</p>
