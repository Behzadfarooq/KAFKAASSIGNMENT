	    <p>The <b>baseball color line</b> was the policy, unwritten for nearly its entire duration, which <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racial_segregation.html" title="Racial segregation">excluded</a> <a href="../../../a/f/r/African_American_5c73.html" title="African American">African American</a> <a href="../../../b/a/s/Baseball.html" title="Baseball">baseball</a> players from organized baseball in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> before <a href="../../../1/9/4/1946.html" title="1946">1946</a>. As a result, various <a href="../../../n/e/g/Negro_League_baseball_cd14.html" title="Negro League baseball">Negro Leagues</a> were formed, which featured those players not allowed to participate in the major or minor leagues.</p>
<p>The separation's beginnings occurred in 1868, when the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Association_of_Base_Ball_Players_0c86.html" title="National Association of Base Ball Players">National Association of Base Ball Players</a> decided to bar "any club including one or more colored persons." As baseball made the transition toward becoming a professional sport over the next decade, and the NABBP dissolved into competing organizations in 1871, professional players were no longer restricted by this rule, and for a short while – in 1878 and again in 1884 – African American players played in the big leagues. Over time, they were slowly excluded more and more. As prominent players such as <a href="../../../c/a/p/Cap_Anson_c163.html" title="Cap Anson">Cap Anson</a>, <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_McGraw_%28baseball%29_d7fb.html" title="John McGraw (baseball)">John McGraw</a>, and <a href="../../../t/y/_/Ty_Cobb_62bb.html" title="Ty Cobb">Ty Cobb</a> steadfastly refused to take the field with or against teams with <a href="../../../a/f/r/African-American_b405.html" title="African-American">African-Americans</a> on the roster, it became informally accepted that African Americans were not to participate in <a href="../../../m/a/j/Major_League_Baseball_9421.html" title="Major League Baseball">Major League Baseball</a>. The minor leagues were segregated by the end of the 1898 season.</p>
<p>On May 28 1916, <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimmy_Claxton_d485.html" title="Jimmy Claxton">Jimmy Claxton</a> temporarily broke the professional baseball color barrier when he played one game for the <a href="../../../o/a/k/Oakland_Oaks_%28PCL%29_efe0.html" title="Oakland Oaks (PCL)">Oakland Oaks</a> of the <a href="../../../p/a/c/Pacific_Coast_League_795c.html" title="Pacific Coast League">Pacific Coast League</a>. Claxton was introduced to the team owner by a part-Indian friend as a fellow member of an <a href="../../../o/k/l/Oklahoma.html" title="Oklahoma">Oklahoma</a> tribe. Within a week, a friend of Claxton revealed that he had both <a href="../../../a/f/r/African_American_5c73.html" title="African American">African American</a> and <a href="../../../n/a/t/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States_7838.html" title="Native Americans in the United States">Native American</a> ancestors, and was promptly fired. It would be nearly thirty more years before another black man played organized white baseball.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../n/e/g/Negro_National_League_%28the_first%29_0d6c.html" title="Negro National League (the first)">Negro National League</a> was founded in <a href="../../../1/9/2/1920.html" title="1920">1920</a> by <a href="../../../r/u/b/Rube_Foster_7cce.html" title="Rube Foster">Rube Foster</a>. This created two parallel major leagues, and until 1947, professional baseball in the United States was played in separate homogeneous leagues.</p>
<p>During his term in office as the first <a href="../../../b/a/s/Baseball_commissioner.html" title="Baseball commissioner">baseball commissioner</a>, <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kenesaw_Mountain_Landis_737d.html" title="Kenesaw Mountain Landis">Kenesaw Mountain Landis</a> has been alleged to have been particularly determined to maintain the segregation. It is possible that he was guided by his background as a federal judge, and specifically by the then-existing constitutional doctrine of "<a href="../../../s/e/p/Separate_but_equal.html" title="Separate but equal">separate but equal</a>" institutions. He himself maintained for many years that black players could not be integrated into the major leagues without heavily compensating the owners of Negro League teams for what would likely result in the loss of their investments. In addition, integration at the major league level would likely have necessitated integrating the <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minor_league_baseball.html" title="Minor league baseball">minor leagues</a>, which were much more heavily distributed through the rural <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._South_3e7f.html" title="U.S. South">U.S. South</a> and <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._Midwest_bce5.html" title="U.S. Midwest">Midwest</a>.</p>
<p>One disincentive to desegregation was that strong players who were white sometimes threatened to quit any team that took on a black player.</p>
<p>In 1943, baseball executive <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Veeck_6016.html" title="Bill Veeck">Bill Veeck</a> attempted to buy the <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philadelphia_Phillies_8565.html" title="Philadelphia Phillies">Philadelphia Phillies</a> franchise; rumors began circulating that he intended to purchase the contracts of several Negro Leaguers in order to make the longtime also-rans more competitive in a period when war requirements had depleted most rosters. However, the franchise was instead sold to a different ownership group, and some historians have recently questioned the likelihood of Veeck's rumored intentions.</p>
<p>The color line was formally breached when <a href="../../../b/r/a/Branch_Rickey_9adb.html" title="Branch Rickey">Branch Rickey</a>, with the support of the new baseball commissioner, <a href="../../../h/a/p/Happy_Chandler_5523.html" title="Happy Chandler">Albert "Happy" Chandler</a>, signed the African American player <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jackie_Robinson_5b0c.html" title="Jackie Robinson">Jackie Robinson</a> in October 1945, intending him to play for the <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles_Dodgers_bc90.html" title="Los Angeles Dodgers">Brooklyn Dodgers</a> in the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_League_1c21.html" title="National League">National League</a>. After a year in the minor leagues with the <a href="../../../m/o/n/Montreal_Royals_813f.html" title="Montreal Royals">Montreal Royals</a> (<a href="../../../i/n/t/International_League_5797.html" title="International League">International League</a>), Robinson endured epithets and death threats and got off to a slow start in his first major league season in <a href="../../../1/9/4/1947_in_sports.html" title="1947 in sports">1947</a>, but his athleticism and skill earned him the <a href="../../../m/l/b/MLB_Rookie_of_the_Year_Award_d6a9.html" title="MLB Rookie of the Year Award">Rookie of the Year</a> award. Less well-known was <a href="../../../l/a/r/Larry_Doby_4b43.html" title="Larry Doby">Larry Doby</a>, who signed with the <a href="../../../c/l/e/Cleveland_Indians_918e.html" title="Cleveland Indians">Cleveland Indians</a> that same year to become the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_League_6b8d.html" title="American League">American League</a>'s first African-American player. Both men were later elected to the <a href="../../../b/a/s/Baseball_Hall_of_Fame_4e80.html" title="Baseball Hall of Fame">Baseball Hall of Fame</a>. Due to their success, teams slowly but surely integrated talented African-Americans on their roster.</p>
<p>Prior to the integration of the major leagues, the Brooklyn Dodgers spearheaded the integration of the minor leagues. Jackie Robinson and <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Wright_8326.html" title="John Wright">John Wright</a> were assigned to Montreal, but also that season <a href="../../../d/o/n/Don_Newcombe_45ab.html" title="Don Newcombe">Don Newcombe</a> and <a href="../../../r/o/y/Roy_Campanella_0d8d.html" title="Roy Campanella">Roy Campanella</a> became members of the <a href="../../../n/a/s/Nashua_Dodgers_1d28.html" title="Nashua Dodgers">Nashua Dodgers</a> in the class-B <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_England_League_db1e.html" title="New England League">New England League</a>. Nashua was the first minor-league team based in the United States to integrate its roster after 1898. Subsequently that season, the Pawtucket Slaters, the <a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlanta_Braves_4729.html" title="Atlanta Braves">Boston Braves</a>' New England League franchise, also integrated its roster, as did Brooklyn's class-C franchise in Trois Riviers, Quebec. The rest of the minor leagues would slowly integrate as well, including those based in the Southern United States. The <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carolina_League_42af.html" title="Carolina League">Carolina League</a>, for example, integrated in 1951 when the <a href="../../../d/a/n/Danville_Leafs_9dc9.html" title="Danville Leafs">Danville Leafs</a> signed <a href="../../../p/e/r/Percy_Miller_Jr._8731.html" title="Percy Miller Jr.">Percy Miller Jr.</a> to their team.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston_Red_Sox_8ec5.html" title="Boston Red Sox">Boston Red Sox</a> were the last major league team to integrate, due to the steadfast resistance provided by owner <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tom_Yawkey_75c5.html" title="Tom Yawkey">Tom Yawkey</a> and manager <a href="../../../p/i/n/Pinky_Higgins_a4d3.html" title="Pinky Higgins">Mike "Pinky" Higgins</a>. However, they too eventually conformed to the integrationist trend, signing <a href="../../../p/u/m/Pumpsie_Green_e05a.html" title="Pumpsie Green">Pumpsie Green</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/5/1959_in_sports.html" title="1959 in sports">1959</a>.</p>
