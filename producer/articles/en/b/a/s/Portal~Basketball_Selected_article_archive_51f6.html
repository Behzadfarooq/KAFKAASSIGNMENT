<p>The play begins with a ballhandler's, usually positioned on the <a href="../../../b/a/s/Basketball_court.html" title="Basketball court">court</a> external to the <a href="../../../t/h/r/Three-point_field_goal.html" title="Three-point field goal">three-point</a> (semi-<a href="../../../e/l/l/Ellipsoid.html" title="Ellipsoid">ellipsoid</a>) <a href="../../../a/r/c/Arc_%28geometry%29.html" title="Arc (geometry)">arc</a> and most frequently proximate to the <a href="../../../f/r/e/Free_throw.html" title="Free throw">free throw line</a> and separated from the <a href="../../../b/a/s/Basket.html" title="Basket">basket</a> by a defender, moving in the direction of a teammate, who obstructs the defender with his static body (or, <a href="../../../p/e/r/Personal_foul.html" title="Personal foul">impermissibly</a>, with his <a href="../../../a/r/m/Arm.html" title="Arm">arms</a> or <a href="../../../l/e/g/Leg.html" title="Leg">legs</a> or whilst moving), providing the teammate with open space.</p>
