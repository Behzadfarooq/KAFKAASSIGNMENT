<p>Hello Bastin,</p>
<p>I'm not sure I can agree with your recent change in the Luxembourg article. For those of us who grew up in Luxembourgish speaking families French was indeed harder to learn then German and most retained a greater degree of fluency in German then French. I myself consider myself both francophone and germanophone, but as you might have noticed on my user page I rated myself as native language Luxembourgish and German, near native for French and English, I believe the same applies to many others. Of course this is yet another issue for the large section of the population who have more recent migratory origins and therefore might have grown up with a romance language (best example are probably the Portuguese immigrants and Luxembourgers of Portuguese descent), these often have problems in school with German and English, but much less in French. This is probably one of the reasons for Luxembourg's bad scores in PISA tests, <i>old</i> Luxembourgers having trouble with one mandatory school language while immigrants or those of recent immigrant origin having trouble with two mandatory school languages and the unofficial vehicular language of school (Luxembourgish). I'm not sure how to remedy this in the article, but I found 208.50.126.126 useful. As an anecdote, like most kids of my generation I learned German from watching TV in the 1970's, I was more or less fluent in it before I ever was scholarised. We even used to play speaking German among ourselves. Of course I grew up in a mostly Luxembourgish (all my neighbours were actually Italian or Spanish immigrants, but they also spoke Luxembourgish by then) language area, which was already unusual back in the 1970's. French on the other hand came several years later and I only started to assimilate it's grammar around 7th grade (1st year of <i>highschool</i>). Even today I much prefer to speak Luxembourgish, German or English, though I indeed prefer to write French (as it's a beautiful language with a large and diverse vocabulary), at least for anything formal.--<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECaranorn_eafd.html" title="User:Caranorn">Caranorn</a> 12:58, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, it's definitely the case for those who grew up in a Luxembourgish speaking environment, which is a rapidly dwindling portion of the population. One reason for your experience might also be based on the fact that in every day life (especially working age and actual working people) Luxembourgish speaking people are definitely a minority. What's also correct is that indeed the Moselle region (one of my sisters lives there), but also the <i>Eisleck</i> tends to be more germanophone, the Minett is very francophone on the other hand, the center is more mixed... I will see whether I can edit that entry slightly to reflect this. If you get to it first go ahead, I'm a bit slow right now due to a cold that's been plaguing me for a few days.--<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECaranorn_eafd.html" title="User:Caranorn">Caranorn</a> 15:01, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Bastin. Sorry, I've just reverted the template before I realised you had written me a message. Anyway, although it is a decent idea, it's a bit of a problem to fit them on the same box (some countries' are huge already as they have a lot of national elections and referenda, <a href="../../../d/a/n/Template%7EDanish_elections_0501.html" title="Template:Danish elections">Denmark's</a> being one).</p>
<p>I think I will keep excluding the European elections, as the box is really for national elections, and the European ones are more like regional ones (as they are done by regions too). I intend to create a new box for them that will go by country and year (hopefully it won't look to awful!).

<dd>I don't like it myself, and do now regret giving it its current (provisional) title.

<p>I have been reading with some amazement the pages on Luxembourg (city) and Hollerich. There seems to have been a serious misunderstanding of the French <i>ville</i> and the German <i>Stadt</i> in the explanation of how Hollerich was given the status of a city. I feel very strongly that is should be corrected by translating <i>ville</i> as town is this context. City in the English language - and particularly in British English - has a very specific meaning which goes far beyond the French <i>ville</i>. Before I go ahead with making edits along these lines, I would like your reactions. Whoever added the information seems very intent on maintaining his view of the world! <a href="../../../i/p/i/User%7EIpigott_c534.html" title="User:Ipigott">Ipigott</a> 09:36, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd><a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECaranorn_eafd.html" title="User:Caranorn">Caranorn</a> was the one that <a href="../../../b/a/s/User_talk%7EBastin8_Archive_3_227f.html#Hollerich" title="User talk:Bastin8/Archive 3">pointed out</a> that Hollerich-Bonnevoie was granted the title of a city. If you want to argue the toss with him about usage of the French language, be my guest. Just as miserable is an attempt to argue the toss with me, since I understand the nuances of both 'ville' and 'stadt' perfectly well.</dd>
<dd>In this case, your translation is simply wrong. '<a href="../../../t/o/w/Town.html" title="Town">Town</a>' is a relatively uncommon legal definition in English, but '<a href="../../../c/i/t/City.html" title="City">city</a>' is one that is common to all. This is a translation that is universal, from both French and German, and to just about every language that does differentiate between the two. 'Ville' is the official designation in Luxembourg, and its usage with regards to Hollerich-Bonnevoie is identical to its usage with regards to Luxembourg City, Diekirch, Esch-sur-Alzette, or the nine other cities in Luxembourg. Hence <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_cities_in_Luxembourg_cd28.html" title="List of cities in Luxembourg">List of cities in Luxembourg</a>, the creation of which greatly predates my intervention. <a href="../../../b/a/s/User%7EBastin8_Signature_e263.html" title="User:Bastin8/Signature">Bastin</a> 19:50, 11 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks for your detailed explanations on this which I have read with interest. I have indeed been in touch with <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECaranorn_eafd.html" title="User:Caranorn">Caranorn</a> on this and he commented as follows: Concerning city and town, I feel city is appropriate though I've noticed that for instance in articles concerning dutch city grants these are called towns. But doing so actually risks leading to confusion. For me a town is a french bourg, a much less formal title (which can be attributed to a small rural community behind walls or of special status, to part of a larger city etc.). A city on the other hand is indeed the french ville, one granted that title and corresponding rights by charter. This once was a very important distinction and the reason why even today a small place like Vianden is called a city (my own village I seem to recall has a greater population then Vianden). The fact that Hollerich-Bonnevoie once was granted that status is also quite important (at that time city grants were of course for matters such as industrialization and population, but it was still a special grant), though by now it's mostly an anecdote (most locals probably don't know). In general, changing terminology from city to town could also create create a problem with Luxembourg City as I'm not sure any local place would bear the title based on size alone (we definitely do not fulfill the requirements for major city as applied in Germany, though I'm not sure what kind of population they require for minor city). But anyhow, it's largely a matter of tradition, places such as Vianden, Echternach or Luxembourg have had the status of ville for most of the past 7-8 centuries, while towns are often of much more recent origin and much less regional or local importance (particularly US use of town). Concerning Mamer and any other community without status of a 'ville' I'd agree that it should just be called a village or a municipality/commune. While these have grown relatively large in the past century they don't have any special status.</dd>

<dd>So I agree that in the case of Luxembourg we should translated the official status of ville as city. BTW this becomes more difficult in the case of Scandinavian places where the charter usually established a market town - similar in fact to market towns in England. In Spanish and Italian, with ciudad and cittá, every town is a city!<a href="../../../i/p/i/User%7EIpigott_c534.html" title="User:Ipigott">Ipigott</a> 22:42, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"Judgment" is not an incorrect spelling. "Judgement" is an alternative, but it is not more correct. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngryStan_75db.html" title="User:AngryStan">AngryStan</a> 06:43, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for pointing that out guys. It's actually a word I added to my corrections list just yesterday without checking it properly, so hopefully no major harm done. I've removed it from the list and made sure it won't be added again. Cheers, <a href="../../../c/m/d/User%7ECmdrObot_0605.html" title="User:CmdrObot">CmdrObot</a> 15:02, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Alright, I understand the "rediects with possibilities", but what is wrong with Lycée redirecting directly to the "lycée" section, thus helping the user by not haveing to scroll down to the intended section?

<dd>Re your mail: unfortunately this is all too late as the block has expired. But also... the RfC isn't relevant; nor are the warnings since you're experienced. Were AFDs edits vandalism? Not obviously so. And the usual answer to that is: get the other editor blocked for vandalism, if it is, rather than overdoing 3RR yourself <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_M._Connolley_7af8.html" title="User:William M.

<p>Now at AfD. Ignorant comments, but they will prevail unless you can get some cites in quickly for all 3 articles. The refs in Oxford don't display right, which doesn't help the article. Check the templates--You need to use one for each ref. Alternatively, do it inline . AND don't cite WP, I don't think anyone has noticed yet, but if they do it will sink the articles for sure. It has actually been challenged in each individual liked bio that the people are members, and actual refs will be needed. People are being thorough, andy ou will have to be.
