<p>Information contained was not factual. Organ pedals are not called "bass pedals". The stub was too short to be useful (see #2 at <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patent_nonsense.html" title="Patent nonsense">patent nonsense</a>). The only synthesizer bass pedals worth mention are the <a href="../../../m/o/o/Moog_Taurus_9b65.html" title="Moog Taurus">Moog Taurus</a>. The three pages that link to <a href="../../../b/a/s/Bass_pedals.html" title="Bass pedals">Bass pedals</a> are all refering to the Moog Taurus. Thus this page is redundant.</p>

<dd>I can't really agree with any of this. Numerous manufacturers produced stand-alone bass pedal units over the years.

<dd>Yes, and that's the point... It's only Moog who called this type of unit a <i>bass pedal</i>.

<p>Two things:</p>
<p>I'd like to change the text a little to clarify that the <b>bass pedal</b> units described here have two key (ha ha!) features: a <a href="../../../p/e/d/Pedalboard.html" title="Pedalboard">pedalboard</a> (for which there is a good article to which this one can refer) <i>and</i> some sort of bult-in sound generation device. This would distinguish things like the Taurus from pedal MIDI controllers (which are now more common).</p>
<p>And a minor quibble: I don't think Farfisa made electromechanical organs. AFAIK, all their organs had purely electronic sound generation (unlike Hammonds, for example). I'm open to correction on this, but I didn't see anything to the contrary in a quick web search.</p>

<dd>Quite right about <a href="../../../f/a/r/Farfisa.html" title="Farfisa">Farfisa</a> AFAIK too.

<dd>We are certainly making progress IMO. It's a complex story, in that many disciplines not noted for their intercommunication are involved... from <i>drug addled hippies</i> (see above) to pipe organ fans (I note that while one editor said that the pedal clavier <i>formed</i> part of a pipe organ, another has recently changed this to <i>form</i>, accurately reflecting the fact that <a href="../../../p/i/p/Pipe_organ.html" title="Pipe organ">pipe organs</a> do still exist...!). Actually, some early synth freaks fond of mood affecting substances were fond of pipe organs too, see <a href="../../../t/a/n/Tangerine_Dream_cbf2.html" title="Tangerine Dream">Tangerine Dream</a>. And of course <a href="../../../d/r/_/Dr_Moog_4532.html" title="Dr Moog">Dr Moog</a> was a physicist and engineer, and the first synth-dominated album to make an impact on mainstream charts was <i><a href="../../../s/w/i/Switched-On_Bach_cab3.html" title="Switched-On Bach">Switched-On Bach</a></i>, which was on the classical charts... to the disgust of many Bach fans. So it's no wonder that the terminology was and is something of a battleground. Sorting it all out is definitely a job for... <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewa_wikiman_9789.html" title="User:Andrewa/wikiman">Wikiman</a>! <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewa_c818.html" title="User:Andrewa">Andrewa</a> 23:40, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The language is too flowery and makes to many story-telling assumptions (e.g. manufacturers "realised" something, "began" to do something else) - this is not an encyclopaedic style of writing. Vocabulary such as "adjunct" is an overly elaborate way of saying something simple. Also, the useful links to Hammond and Farfisa have been removed.--<a href="../../../f/e/l/User%7EFeline1_dd6c.html" title="User:Feline1">feline1</a> 10:26, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"Adjunct" is a two-syllable word. How that is "elaborate" escapes me, but if you'd rather say "addition" or some other word more likely to be known by high school dropouts, again, have at it.</dd>
<dd>Any reference to Farfisa at all is irrlevant to this page, unless they did something interesting with pedals. The "useful" link to Hammond was to the <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hammond.html" title="Hammond">dab page</a> which required the user to scroll to the bottom to find the <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hammond_organ.html" title="Hammond organ">Hammond organ</a> link, which itself is only marginally relevant since this page is not about Hammond organs. If you want to add manufacturer links, Moog and other companies which actually made bass pedals would seem to be a higher priority. <a href="../../../m/r/r/User%7EMrRK_0d22.html" title="User:MrRK">MrRK</a> 21:35, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Feline1, do you own a dictionary? Given the fact that you think "adjunct" is a big word, probably not. Not to worry; you can look words up at <a href="http://www.m-w.com" class="external text" title="http://www.m-w.com" rel="nofollow">Merriam Webster</a>. Here's what they say about "tune":</p>
<p>Main Entry: <b>tune</b> Function: verb Inflected Form(s): tuned; tun·ing transitive verb 1&#160;: to adjust in musical pitch or cause to be in tune &lt;<i>tuned her guitar</i>&gt; 2 a&#160;: to bring into harmony&#160;: ATTUNE b&#160;: to adjust for precise functioning -- often used with up &lt;<i>tune up an engine</i>&gt; c&#160;: to make more precise, intense, or effective 3&#160;: to adjust with respect to resonance at a particular frequency: as a&#160;: to adjust (a radio or television receiver) to respond to waves of a particular frequency -- often used with in b&#160;: to establish radio contact with &lt;<i>tune in a directional beacon</i>&gt; 4&#160;: to adjust the frequency of the output of (a device) to a chosen frequency or range of frequencies; also&#160;: to alter the frequency of (radiation)</p>
<p>I refer you to the first part of definition 1, before the word "or", and to definition 4. Apparently, you were only aware of the second part of definition 1, but "tune" was a perfectly good word in this context, and in fact converys more meaning than your choice, "produced" - these pedals could in fact often produce higher frequencies as well, but were tuned (there's that word again...) by the musician to play in the bass range, which is why those musicians called them "bass pedals". Perhaps that connection eluded you.</p>
<p>If you want to quibble over the choice of a word, always check the dictionary first. I won't get into a pissing contest by changing the article back, but please check your facts a bit more carefully before further mutil-, er, editing it.</p>
<p>Looking up "adjunct" is left as an exercise for the reader. (I've always wanted to say that.) <a href="../../../m/r/r/User%7EMrRK_0d22.html" title="User:MrRK">MrRK</a> 08:48, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The most common meaning for "tuning" a musical instrument refers to making small pitch adjustments</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Nonsense. When a string is first put on an instrument, for example, it is nowhere near the correct pitch. The process of tightening it to bring up the pitch is called tuning even at this stage. It does not start off as something else and become "tuning" only when it gets close. This is why the non-redundant phrase "fine tuning" exists.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>to make it match a reference pitch, or other instruments, or its own other strings/oscillators/etc (as in the "tuned her guitar" example quoted). Since this is the most common sense of the phrase, but not the one intended here (where we are talking about setting the entire pitch register of the instrument), it immediately becomes potentially ambiguous and confusing. Therefore, it's better to replace it with a different phrase without the ambiguity. Similarly, "adjunct" is not a particularly common word and in this instance is a quite obtuse way of saying something very simple. Encyclopdia's are here to be informative, not smart arse or lofty or obscure. Please refer to wikipedia's bewildering array of policy and guidelines for further details... --<a href="../../../f/e/l/User%7EFeline1_dd6c.html" title="User:Feline1">feline1</a> 10:46, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"They [...] are usually tuned in the bass range" is neither ambiguous nor confusing. Then again, you mentioned getting confused above as well. Hmmm... never mind that, but I really have to question your level of skill with English if you find "adjunct" to be "lofty or obscure". I also note that you use apostrophes to form plural nouns, you use adjectives as adverbs, and you confuse "to" with "too", so you'll have to excuse me if I'm reluctant to take advice from you about writing. Your observations about detachable pedals on electric organs was, on the other hand, a potentially valuable addition to the article. Why not focus on that instead of making questionable quibbles over wording? <a href="../../../m/r/r/User%7EMrRK_0d22.html" title="User:MrRK">MrRK</a> 18:40, 11 January 2007 (UTC)

<dl>
<dd>You already gave the reference! You cited a dictionary entry where "tuning" has various meanings. So I edited the article to use a less ambiguous turn of phrase. It's really no big deal. Furthermore, the majority of the analogue bass pedal synths (such as the Taurus) have a knob for "tuning" (= fine tuning) and switch for octave transposition (ie overall pitch register). You can turn their "tune" knob to "tune" them to the bass register.--<a href="../../../f/e/l/User%7EFeline1_dd6c.html" title="User:Feline1">feline1</a> 19:53, 11 January 2007 (UTC)
