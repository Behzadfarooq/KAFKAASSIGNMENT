<p><b>Basic High School</b> Institute of Law, Justice, and Public Services; Institute for Health Wellness and Medical Technologies, is a nine-month <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public.html" title="Public">public</a> <a href="../../../h/i/g/High_school.html" title="High school">high school</a> that is part of the <a href="../../../c/l/a/Clark_County_School_District_3e83.html" title="Clark County School District">Clark County School District</a> and is located in <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henderson%2C_Nevada_98c0.html" title="Henderson, Nevada">Henderson, Nevada</a>.</p>
<p>Basic High School opened in <a href="../../../1/9/4/1942.html" title="1942">1942</a>; a year after Basic Magnesium Inc. built its wartime magnesium plant on 2,000 acres (8 km²) of desert land. The school, then located where the city hall of Henderson now stands, had its first graduating class -- 10 students -- in the spring of 1943.</p>
<p>The school closed after the war ended, and as a result, the major businesses that were driven to the area by the war, closed as well. It opened again in 1954, on Van Wagenen <a href="../../../s/t/r/Street.html" title="Street">Street</a> and Pacific <a href="../../../a/v/e/Avenue.html" title="Avenue">Avenue</a>. However, it later relocated in 1971 to its current location, 400 N. Palo Verde <a href="../../../d/r/i/Drive.html" title="Drive">Drive</a>, and the old site was renamed Burkholder Jr. High School, which also closed temporarily for reconstruction in 2003 (which closed down later after the building of Mannion Junior High <a href="../../../s/c/h/School.html" title="School">School</a>).</p>
<p>It is also one of the better-known high schools in the <a href="../../../l/a/s/Las_Vegas_Valley_c14e.html" title="Las Vegas Valley">Las Vegas Valley</a>, for its traditions and heavy influence on school spirit.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/s/Basic_High_School_aaa4.html" title="Edit section: School Name">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">School Name</span></h2>
<p>Unlike most schools in the <a href="../../../c/l/a/Clark_County_School_District_3e83.html" title="Clark County School District">Clark County School District</a>, Basic High School is not named after an individual. During the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a> era, numerous factories located themselves to the <a href="../../../l/a/s/Las_Vegas_metropolitan_area_7d8f.html" title="Las Vegas metropolitan area">Las Vegas valley</a> (among these factories were Basic Management Industries (Basic Magnesium Inc) and <a href="../../../t/i/m/Timet.html" title="Timet">Timet</a>). When the state of Nevada decided to create a city for the workers of these businesses, the name decided upon was “Basic”. The newly-found Basic, Nevada needed a school for their children to attend, hence Basic High School received the name of its city (the city of Basic is now the city of <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henderson%2C_Nevada_98c0.html" title="Henderson, Nevada">Henderson, Nevada</a>).</p>
<p><a name="Facts_.26_Trivia" id="Facts_.26_Trivia"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/s/Basic_High_School_aaa4.html" title="Edit section: Facts &amp; Trivia">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Facts &amp; Trivia</span></h2>
<ul>
<li>Basic High School is noted for having high standards for its football team and MC/<a href="../../../j/r/o/JROTC_2ba6.html" title="JROTC">JROTC</a> academy. A graduate of Basic High School, Henry Rolling, played professional football for 9 years. He had his start with the Wolves from 1978 to 1982. He ended up playing for the <a href="../../../t/a/m/Tampa_Bay_Buccaneers_437e.html" title="Tampa Bay Buccaneers">Tampa Bay Buccaneers</a>, the <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles_Rams_42e3.html" title="Los Angeles Rams">Los Angeles Rams</a>, and the <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Diego_Chargers_92bd.html" title="San Diego Chargers">San Diego Chargers</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Basic's "El Lobo" yearbook is also set to high standards, for it has won national praise for many years. The 2005 El Lobo Volume LXIII (63rd) yearbook was awarded Silver Medalist by the <a href="../../../c/s/p/CSPA_7879.html" title="CSPA">CSPA</a> and named All-American with four marks of distinction for the 16th consecutive year. The yearbook is published by Herff Jones publishing company.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The school's morning announcements are prerecorded and broadcasted over the television during 2nd period. All classrooms are essentially equipped with a television that plugs into a live feed cable that is only available throughout the school. This is not considered unusual in the <a href="../../../c/l/a/Clark_County_School_District_3e83.html" title="Clark County School District">Clark County School District</a>, because many schools in the district also use this method.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Basic High School offers many <a href="../../../c/l/u/Clubs.html" title="Clubs">clubs</a> which are primarily run by the student body (ex. <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chess.html" title="Chess">Chess</a> Club, Bible Club, Math Club, French Club, Spanish Club).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>It is one of the few high schools in the county to have a Robotics Club, which builds and designs high-tech robots and enters them at annual competitions at <a href="../../../u/n/l/UNLV_1ace.html" title="UNLV">UNLV</a>, and a Tech. Shop, which teaches car maintenance and repairs cars for free, at the expense of a much slower repair time.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>An <a href="../../../a/d/v/Advanced_Placement_Program_866e.html" title="Advanced Placement Program">Advanced Placement Program</a> is also offered at Basic High School.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>All students at Basic High School have an account on <a href="https://secure2.ccsd.net/cgi-bin/isis.exe?&amp;d=basicit" class="external text" title="https://secure2.ccsd.net/cgi-bin/isis.exe?&amp;d=basicit" rel="nofollow">In-Touch Online</a>, which is a program over the internet that allows students (and parents) to check their grades and attendance.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Basic High School has a "Freshmen Academy", which is a program that allows better communication between Freshmen teachers, parents, and students, to decrease drop-out rates. It works by having all the members of The 'Freshman Academy' in 3 classes together, (usually <a href="../../../b/i/o/Biology.html" title="Biology">Biology</a>, <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_studies.html" title="English studies">English</a>, and <a href="../../../a/l/g/Algebra.html" title="Algebra">Algebra</a>) which helps them make friends and build a better foundation for the rest of their stay at Basic.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>A three-story building is very noticeable on the Basic High School campus; most classrooms here are classes for Freshmen students, and it is referred to as the "800 Building" since all classes here are in the 800's.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Basic High School is one of the few schools in Henderson which still has an annual <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homecoming.html" title="Homecoming">Homecoming</a> parade.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>A large white "B" is painted on a local mountain during the week of Homecoming, which stands for Basic; it's visible throughout the entire City of Henderson year-long. A separate "B" was painted near the old Basic High School, now known as Mannion Middle School, which was also maintained for many years, long after Basic relocated to its current campus. In the past, students used to (after winning the Homecoming game), set the "B" on fire; the rock is limestone, and could be seen at night in a low glow. The CCSD had banned that due to hazardous conditions.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Basic High School students have a traditional wolf's howl that they use to show school spirit.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Until the opening of <a href="../../../g/r/e/Green_Valley_High_School_3363.html" title="Green Valley High School">Green Valley High School</a>, Basic was the only high school in the city of Henderson. A long-standing rivalry existed between Basic and Green Valley for several years.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Basic High School's school rival is now <a href="../../../f/o/o/Foothill_High_School_612a.html" title="Foothill High School">Foothill High School</a>, which opened in 1999.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Finally, a school pride statement that is written on the walls of the main hallway, states, "<i>For the strength of the pack is the wolf, and the strength of the wolf is the pack</i>," which is line from the popular poem "The Law for the Wolves" by <a href="../../../r/u/d/Rudyard_Kipling_8a10.html" title="Rudyard Kipling">Rudyard Kipling</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>"<i>The mission of Basic High School is to provide a varied instructional environment which empowers students to utilize <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communication.html" title="Communication">communication</a>, problem solving, and critical thinking skills in order to achieve their highest potential as productive citizens in an ever changing world.</i>"</p>
