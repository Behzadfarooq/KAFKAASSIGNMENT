<p>Is <i>haizkolaritza</i> what is shown several times in Julio Medem's film <i>Vacas</i>? -- <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 06:37, Nov 9, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Where have you found this word? I've been searching in Basque language online dictionaries and it didn't appear. I believe that surely the sufix -tza is bat a declination case of "aizkolari", without -h. Aizkolaritza is the sport of axe cut, and it appears in Vacas if I'm right. There is the famous scene where the axe is thrown away, a scene that he included also in his last work La Pelota Vasca. The root word is "aizkolari", which refers to the sporter man. Surely you know yet that "aizkora" is one of those Basque words with ethimological root on "stone", as other iron tools.<a href="../../../i/d/i/User%7EIdiazabal_2899.html" title="User:Idiazabal">Idiazabal</a> 00:13, 10 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Someone else put the word in the article, not me. As for "surely you know", nope. My Basque vocabulary is almost non-existent.

<p>Haizkolaritza is Aizkolaritza. In proper grammar with "H", traditionally without "H". Haitz=stone Haizkora=Stone made axe.<a href="../../../i/k/e/User%7EIkertxo_e5a5.html" title="User:Ikertxo">Ikertxo</a></p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Pre-Christian religion and mythology</span></h2>
<p>I've been reading this part of the article and there are some things I want to point out. First, it talks about Mari and then about Anbotoko Mari. Well, both are the same: Anbotoko Mari means "Mari of Anboto", which is mentioned before when it says that Mari resides in mount Anboto. Maybe we should put both paragraphs together.</p>
<p>And second, the main divinities are missing: Eguzki (the Sun), Ilargi (the Moon) and Amalur (Mother Earth). These three have a very strong value at basque mithology, specially the Sun. For instance, Ilargi means "Light of the deads" and it's believed to be very ancient (from the Mesolithic) and that the deads were guided by its light in the night. The Sun is even more important (as in most of ancient Europe).</p>
<dl>
<dd>Um, I read somewhere that the etimology of <i>ilargi</i> is not so clear. What we klnow about pre-Christian elements are recent reconstructions. It would be good to have some reference so that we can say "According to ..., " <a href="http://euskaldok.deusto.es/Muestra-indice.asp?codigoIndice=565&amp;codigoRevista=32" class="external text" title="http://euskaldok.deusto.es/Muestra-indice.asp?codigoIndice=565&amp;codigoRevista=32" rel="nofollow">Fontes Linguae Vasconum, enero/abril 2000</a> has an article <i>Análisis crítico de los desarrollos etimológicos de <a href="../../../u/h/l/Uhlenbeck.html" title="Uhlenbeck">Uhlenbeck</a> y Michelena para el vasco ilargi "luna"</i> by some Yuri Zitsar.

<p>As it says, cromlechs have religious significance, and so do the dolmens (trikuharri in basque). The bodies were buried inside them with the head towards the East, facing the Sun.</p>
<dl>
<dd>But megaliths are very old, aren't they? Is it sure that there is a connection between them and Basques? For example, we know that Celts found and integrated, but did not build, magaliths in Britain (as in <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stonehenge.html" title="Stonehenge">Stonehenge</a>. --<a href="../../../e/r/r/User%7EError_ca98.html" title="User:Error">Error</a> 02:03, 6 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm assuming the reason someone put this here with "compare" is to point out that the tables on Basque ethnicity and Basque language are identical. Offhand, I don't think that is a big problem -- this is a case where language is certainly the single best marker of ethnicity -- but certainly there are ethnic Basques abroad who do not speak Basque, and there are probably people who live in the Basque country who are native speakers (possibly bilingual native speakers) but don't consider themselves Basque. If someone has solid evidence to refine either set of numbers, great. But I don't think the present state of this is troubling. -- <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 18:26, Jun 4, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>'Basqueland' looks to be taken from German 'Baskenland' - but it isn't a received English word, and (apart from sounding a bit like the name of a theme park!) would cause quite as much confusion as anything else if it were used. Yes, 'Basque Country' is ambiguous: but it is the most recognisable term, and can be qualified easily enough if the precise meaning in a particular case isn't quite clear from the context. 'Euskal Herria' is of course a very sound Basque name, but again suffers from the fact that the non-specialist English reader won't know quite what it means [s/he may not have any clue at all, and even if s/he does, may be unclear whether it means current boundaries? old boundaries? boundaries of the Autonomia? area where Basque is spoken as a first/second language?...]. My vote is in general for 'Basque Country', on the grounds that it is an easily accessible term - and to qualify it as necessary.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Roman and mediaeval times</span></h2>
<p>The mediaeval section still needs more sorting out: there isn't quite a proper chronological sequence or consistency, and there is the wrong kind of emphasis given to Roncesvalles, which was a trivial skirmish in historical terms, though certainly meriting mention because of the Chanson de Roland. Moreover, "Only a small number of Roman traders would have come there" is clearly inconsistent with "At the same time, the Basques lost their lifestyle, which was dependent on trade with the Roman Empire".

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Ethnic composition of Basque Country</span></h2>
<p>As I understand, most of the Basque people in Spanish autonomous region Basque Country speak Spanish language, while only 27% of the population of the region speak Basque language. But, what is the ethnic (not language) composition of Basque country? How many of the inhabitants of this region are ethnic Basque (both Spanish and Basque speakers), and how many are ethnic Spanish? Why it is so hard to find information about ethnic composition of the regions of Western Europe, such are Basque Country, Alsace, Wales, etc...? <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPANONIAN_cecc.html" title="User:PANONIAN">User:PANONIAN</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>30 years ago, only 25% of inhabitants were basque originally(In spain). For example on the end of XX.century, only 10% of bilbao was born there. So, we could supose ethnic group composition must be similar. But currently most of population is mixed Basque-Spanish or Basque-French.--<a href="../../../i/k/e/User%7EIkertxo_e5a5.html" title="User:Ikertxo">Ikertxo</a> 09:05, 5 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>First you have to define what an "ethnic Basque" and an "ethnic Spanish" are.</li>
</ul>
<p>Well, I do not know how these things are defined in Spain, but in the countries of Eastern Europe, it is defined by the way how people declare themselves in census. For example, in Russia, you have people who declare themselves as Russians, while you also have people who declare themselves as Tatars, Chechens, etc, but they are also citizens of Russia. Is the question about ethnicity asked in Spanish census or not? <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPANONIAN_cecc.html" title="User:PANONIAN">User:PANONIAN</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Not sure about the census (if someone knows please chime in), but speaking as a person who has spent about half a year each in Spain and in Romania (which is to say, clueful but not expert), these things seem much more fluid in Spain. For starters, there has probably been more intermarriage. Also, whether they are religious or not, pretty much everyone (except recent immigrants) is from a Roman Catholic background, because 500 years ago those who weren't Catholic were kicked out. The Basques are certainly the most distinct but, except for racialists, pretty much everyone would agree that language is the main thing that makes them so: I would go so far as to say that other than language, the differences are on the same order one can find from region to region anywhere in Spain (or, for that matter, between Biscay and Navarre). -- <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 02:46, August 14, 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Not so in Spain. Actually, databases with racial data (like say one operated by a social researcher on <a href="../../../g/i/t/Gitano.html" title="Gitano">Gitano</a> discrimination) are very restricted if not forbidden by the Spanish <i>Ley Orgánica de Protección de Datos de Carácter Personal</i> (LOPD). You can infer from the census data on languages or place of birth or surname (for example a Ceutan with a surname <i>Mohamed</i> is almost certainly a Berber) or citizenship (for foreign residents or double nationality). But, from memory, the only official record that a Spaniard is a mulatto would be the face photograph. Probably police records for criminals hold more data.</dd>
<dd>When I found that in Eastern Europe people are officially declared as a Slovak in Czech Republic or a Hungarian in Romania, I thought very weird. Same, when I was asked to declare my ethnicity in a British benefits form. Apartheidish.
