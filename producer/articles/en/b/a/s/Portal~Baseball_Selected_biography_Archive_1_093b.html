An avid <a href="../../../f/i/s/Fishing.html" title="Fishing">sport fisherman</a>, he hosted a television show about fishing, and was inducted into the Fishing Hall of Fame.</p>
<p>Williams was born in <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Diego%2C_California_4c0a.html" title="San Diego, California">San Diego, California</a> as <i>Teddy Samuel Williams</i>, named after <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theodore_Roosevelt_3623.html" title="Theodore Roosevelt">Teddy Roosevelt</a> and Williams' father. At some point, the name on his birth certificate was changed to "Theodore", but his mother and his closest friends always called him Teddy. His father, Samuel, from New York, a soldier, Sheriff, photographer and great admirer of the late president, and his mother, May, a <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salvation_Army_4c99.html" title="Salvation Army">Salvation Army</a> worker of Spanish-Basque descent whose parents came from Mexico, were generally absentee parents whom he later came to resent. Early in his career, he stated that he wished to be remembered as the "greatest hitter who ever lived", an honor that he indeed achieved in many eyes by the end of his career.</p>
<p>He was also a world-class fisherman, who loved to fish just as much as he loved hitting a baseball — perhaps even more, because he didn't have to contend with boos and catcalls from fans while fishing on a river.</p>
