<p>Look, we got off on the wrong foot. Whoever cut down the Clay information on the <a href="../../../t/e/m/Tempest.html" title="Tempest">Tempest</a> page obviously agreed that the two articles contained excessively redundant material. I don't care which got cut. The Clay article needed so much cleaning up that keeping the one that was already well edited seemed the better choice. Obviously you and I have a LOT of the same interests and both want Joshua Clay to look good.</p>
<p>P.S. I'll bet he's not dead any more. Considering how much <i>Doom Patrol</i> history was undone by <i>Infinite Crisis</i> and other characters brought back from the dead, it's hard to see how his death would fit into their new history. Come of think of it, he needs the same note to that effect as appears in Celsius's article. <a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoczilla_1c36.html" title="User:Doczilla">Doczilla</a> 09:17, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I'm on that watch list as well. I think it's safe to say: anyone that edits one of his favorite pages will get put on the watch list. The watch list is just a way of tattling and being immature about editing. If you can't respect other's edits sometimes (AT LEAST), you shouldn't be on Wikipedia. Doczilla, don't let it get to you. Just ignore it, and keep editing like normal.

<dd>There's nothing rude or uncivil about using the term "watchlist" Kusonaga, and as for my behavior towards Duggy I was more than civil, and even offered an workable solution in the <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monarch_%28comics%29.html" title="Monarch (comics)">Monarch (comics)</a> discussion thread which evolvled into a palatable form after you mediated the issue. It's true that I could I have used a less reactionary title, i'll agree with you there, but calling me uncivil is a bit much. --<a href="../../../b/a/s/User%7EBasique_8925.html" title="User:Basique">Basique</a> 17:53, 15 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm not expressly talking about your behaviour towards Duggy, but the high-handed manner in which you instate a 'watchlist' is ridiculious. The term has a negative connotation to it when used to describe the actions of individuals (I seriously doubt you would like to be put on a 'watchlist' yourself). Therefore, it would be wiser to conduct yourself in a more polite (or as I put it, civil) manner, so as to not unnecessarily offend anyone. Like you have said yourself: It's polarizing. It easily reads as an attack. This is not about your methods, but the way in which you word yourself. That's what I meant with 'friendly'. <a href="../../../k/u/s/User%7EKusonaga_4c5d.html" title="User:Kusonaga">Kusonaga</a> 18:17, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I do agree with <b>Kusonaga's</b> sentiment here - The watchlist implies that the person is a vandal, and frankly, if that's the case, take it up with warnings on their talk page and report it through the normal channels. If it's not, then go to the talk page for the article and, if they don't reply their, the user's talk page. After that with no replies, all bets are off and I'll lean to calling someone a troll. -- <font color="green"><b><a href="../../../i/p/s/User%7EIpstenu_5894.html" title="User:Ipstenu">Ipstenu</a></b> <i>(<a href="../../../i/p/s/User_talk%7EIpstenu_7a4a.html" title="User talk:Ipstenu">talk</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ipstenu_a5b5.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ipstenu">contribs</a>)</i></font> 18:40, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>A watch list is immature. Everyone has a right to edit a page you work on, you don't own the page. If a bug happens, it happens. There is no reason to go off on someone about something they can't control. Accept others edits once in a while. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobJ1981_7eb7.html" title="User:RobJ1981">RobJ1981</a> 01:10, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I guess you didn't read the part that says this is my discussion page Rob? Go away now. --<a href="../../../b/a/s/User%7EBasique_8925.html" title="User:Basique">Basique</a> 01:56, 16 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Hate to break it to you Basique (really, because otherwise you are a fine editor), but the only page you 'have' is your own userpage. Your talkpage is a legitimate venue for people to give their thoughts on your behaviour. You can't try and forcefully shut them out by telling them it's your page, especially considering this is not in "your page", and it's not actually any form of vandalism (that you are 'allowed' to revert), otherwise, talk pages should remain as they are. If people want to discuss something that 'you' have deemed closed, they can, just like on any other talk page. <a href="../../../k/u/s/User%7EKusonaga_4c5d.html" title="User:Kusonaga">Kusonaga</a> 06:30, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I read that part, but anyone is welcome to post on talk pages (even if they are for a certain user}. Why can't you accept others opinions, instead of bashing them and telling them to go away because you don't like the negative comments? <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobJ1981_7eb7.html" title="User:RobJ1981">RobJ1981</a> 03:47, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I didn't find your behaviour all that civil, and was close to stopping contributing all together because of your attacks. Your reverting of good-faith changes for no reason (Batman) or for changing reasons (Monarch - originally claiming that the information was already on the page, later saying it wasn't needed on the page.) Starting discussions and when they aren't going your way claiming they are over. Note, also, that my compromise wording remains and Kusonaga's "workable solution" is actually in addition to mine.</li>
<li>It seems you went on the attack over the mistaken Conan blanking but at no point mentioned that until you put me on a Watchlist (exept for the patronising claim that you were monitoring my spree and I should behave.) The Monarch stuff needed work and a compromise, and I was willing to work towards that - reverting with false reasons is not working towards a compromise, starting a discussion and then claiming it is over is not working towards a compromise. The Batman stuff was a correction of someone else's mistake, and did not need constant, repeated reversion.</li>
<li>There is also an implication in your remarks to myself and others that all changes must be passed by you before they are made. You come off as arrogant and overly-possessive of the pages you monitor. I have apologised for any heat or errors on my part, but have seen no change in your behaviour, and am worried that again and again new contributors are going to be the victim of your attitude, negating the friendly air that should, I feel, exist here. A lot of people, to varying degrees, are telling you this, but you seem to be ignoring it.</li>
<li>Your reaction to the Conan page was a legitimate mistake, and we've covered it, but I'd really like some acknowledgement that there was no need to constantly revert my changes on Monarch &amp; Batman.</li>
