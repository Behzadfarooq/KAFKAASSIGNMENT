<p>The page <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hamel_basis.html" title="Hamel basis">Hamel basis</a> redirects here, and I'm not sure that is appropriate. If it is appropriate, important information about Hamel bases is missing from this article. Hamel bases are discussed most frequently as bases for the real numbers considered as a vector space over the rationals, and the article here omits that important idea. I'm going to remove the redirection and add "Hamel basis" to the list of requested mathematics article, and possibly supply a new "Hamel basis" article myself when I can. -- <a href="../../../d/o/m/User%7EDominus_070e.html" title="User:Dominus">Dominus</a> 18:46, 20 May 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>You have a point. But in the scheme of things I'd say the point made at length about orthonormal bases not being vector space bases is a more central topic.</p>
<p>A dedicated article about Hamel bases for R over Q would be fine, IMO. There is enough to say.</p>
<p>By the way, the introduction of the idea of basis by the four conditions that can be proved equivalent is a bad old Bourbakiste trick, unsuitable for WP. Basis od a vector space is something very fundamental in algebra. It needs a more gentle and readable introduction. <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharles_Matthews_cceb.html" title="User:Charles Matthews">Charles Matthews</a> 12:40, 6 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'm curious about the following statement: <i>Every Hamel basis of this space is much bigger than this merely countably infinite set of functions. <b>Hamel bases of spaces of this kind are of little if any interest.</b></i> I have the following problem in mind: let V be the space of infinite sequences of reals with finitely many nonzero components. The standard Hamel basis of this space is countably infinite. To prove that the dual of V, V*, is not isomorphic to V, one might show that any Hamel basis of V* is uncountable, no? 66.235.51.96 03:51, 12 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>More often than not bases are ordered. None of the examples uses set notation for the basis, all of them present an ordered basis. If nobody vetos, I will change the definition to "<a href="../../../f/a/m/Family_%28mathematics%29.html" title="Family (mathematics)">family</a> of vectors". As any set <i>X</i> is naturally a family (<i>x</i>)<sub><i>x</i>∈<i>X</i></sub> the current definition is included in the new one. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkus_Schmaus_dfb7.html" title="User:Markus Schmaus">Markus Schmaus</a> 21:24, 14 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Of course, elements in a set may not be ordered, and since a basis is a set, the basis may not be ordered. So I think I am not sure why we have to say a basis is a family of vectors not a set. Probably putting some example of non-ordered bases to the article is helpful for both us and readers. -- <a href="../../../t/a/k/User%7ETakuyaMurata_085a.html" title="User:TakuyaMurata">Taku</a> 22:11, Jun 14, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am trying to understand dirac notation by reading wikipedia, and I am finding that all the articles are very technical. Now, "basis" is an idea I can wrap my head around, so I'll add an informal thingo. If you find it inaccurate, tweak it by all means but don't just remove purely it on the basis that "this is so basic that everyone already knows it".</p>

<p>The editor said that this simplifies the definition. While the second definition is definitely shorter, it does not explain what "linearly independent" and "spans" means.

<p>The example of alternative proofs is terrific. However, the phrase <i>"By brute force"</i> sounds like a colloquialism, so I have changed it to <i>"By algebra"</i>.

<dd>Personally, I don't think 'brute force' is too colloquial, but on the other hand I on't think it is the right phrase to use in this case.

<dd><i>The phrase Hamel basis is sometimes used to refer to a basis as defined above, in which the fact that all linear combinations are finite is crucial.</i></dd>

<p>But what lies above is the definition for the ordered basis. Is this sentence implying the Hamel basis is a kind of ordered basis? If so, then this should be stated explicitly, instead of the vague "defined above" referent. The second part of the sentence, <i>...is crucial</i> is also confusing: the sections above don't really discuss finiteness, and so insisting that finiteness is now crucial is even more confusing.
