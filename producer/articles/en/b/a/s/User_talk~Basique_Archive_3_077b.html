<p>I've noticed that you've uploaded a lot of comic images in PNG format. While PNG is great for clean and/or low colour images thanks to its lossless compression, it is terrible for high colour images and/or images with lots of artifacts (like Jpegs). At a cursory glance at least a few of the images you have uploaded seem to come from Jpeg sources. Using the original images, or using a program like Jpegcrop to losslessly crop them would result in much smaller filesizes. For example, the current image used in the infobox of <a href="../../../g/r/i/Grim_Reaper_%28comics%29_31fc.html" title="Grim Reaper (comics)">Grim Reaper (comics)</a> would take 48 seconds to download on dialup (I'm glad those days are long behind me), under ideal circumstances. While the full size image would take more than twice as long, 48 seconds is still an incredible period for such a small image. In fact, the same image in standard bitmap format wouldn't take much longer.--<a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDrat_53ce.html" title="User:Drat">Drat</a> <small>(<a href="../../../d/r/a/User_talk%7EDrat_c90f.html" title="User talk:Drat">Talk</a>)</small> 10:04, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, but what is the point of converting from Jpeg to PNG? You don't get back quality. All it does is balloon out the filesize. And if you need to crop a jpeg without losing quality there is a program called <a href="http://sylvana.net/jpegcrop/" class="external text" title="http://sylvana.net/jpegcrop/" rel="nofollow">Jpegcrop</a> that can do that.--<a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDrat_53ce.html" title="User:Drat">Drat</a> <small>(<a href="../../../d/r/a/User_talk%7EDrat_c90f.html" title="User talk:Drat">Talk</a>)</small></dd>

<dd>Thank you for your suggestion Duggy. Did you have a question about a particular edit i've made? I'm asking this, because that is the primary use of this page. --<a href="../../../b/a/s/User%7EBasique_8925.html" title="User:Basique">Basique</a> 14:42, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>But if you want a question, sure. You prefer PNG, is there any reason? I know nothing about the issue involved, but Drat discussed pros and cons of it. You just said you'd do what you want, but what are your reasons? Does it make uploading easier, do you prefer editing, do you prefer the look... what?</dd>

<dd>And I'm certain not questioning your actions on this page. I'm questioning your style on this page, on other talk page and in comments on edits. I feel it's too harsh. It's too much about you being right and anyone who disagrees being wrong. I'd prefer to see more friendly discussion than anger.</dd>
<dd>Of course, there may not be actual anger there, and I'm hoping there isn't, but it comes off that way, so you may want to pull back a little, is all.</dd>

<dd>Nah. I see where you're coming from, Basi-Boy, but it's a perfectly fine term. No worse than "BTW" or "NPOV". I use it to quickly point out the difference between GIPUs and...say...registered Wikipedians. I'm not saying GIPUs shouldn't be allowed to edit, just know their accountless place. I mean...if you have an account, use it. Don't hide behind an IP address. Also, I've found that there are certain generalities relating to unregistered users. They do tend to make moire mistakes and be less aware of Wikipedia's policies. Also, they don't seem to respect registered users. I mean, if I didn't have the courage, integrity and/or dedication to register, I'd respect those who did. And you. You, yourself, seem to change (for the worse) when you're in that GIPU guise. What's up with that?</dd>
<dd>I'll admit, though, that I might take it too far sometimes. I'll try to tone it down a notch...at least for today. <a href="../../../a/c/e/User%7EAce_Class_Shadow_f213.html" title="User:Ace Class Shadow">ACS (Wikipedian)</a>; <a href="../../../a/c/e/User_talk%7EAce_Class_Shadow_3120.html" title="User talk:Ace Class Shadow">Talk to the Ace</a>. <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ace_Class_Shadow_7799.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ace Class Shadow">See what I've edited</a>. 19:02, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Arbitrary explanation doesn't explain the actual issue. Arkham isn't a correctional facility (look at the other facilities on the list of penal institutions, to see what I mean). It isn't a facility for simple incarceration, nor is it a "penal" insitution (penal = penalty). Please don't re-add without specifc instance citations/references which can show otherwise. (Broadmoor as an allegory is also uncited, btw.) - <a href="../../../j/c/3/User%7EJc37_cfd0.html" title="User:Jc37">jc37</a> 22:32, 24 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It's not a matter of "right and wrong" it's a matter of citation.</dd>
<dd>If I've been shown, I don't see it. First, can you show a reference from ANYWHERE that links arkham to broadmoor? Second, can you show a reference from ANYWHERE that arkham is a penal institution? Give me issue number, give me a quote from Finger, Kane, or Sprang. How about DC's Who's Who? There are <b>many</b> graphic novels on the subject, character arcs, not to mention the long publication history of the Batman franchise.</dd>
<dd>Without such evidence, it simply does not belong on the list. - <a href="../../../j/c/3/User%7EJc37_cfd0.html" title="User:Jc37">jc37</a> 22:48, 24 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>There are plenty of references in the comics to it being both a prison and a hospital, the term "incarcerated" at Arkham is used quite a few times, armed guards patrol Arkham for a reason. The comparison with Broadmoor is correct, if you personally do not wish to believe so that's fine, but the facts are the facts. According to the Who's Who entry the "patients" at Arkham are criminally insane "inmates" culled from Gotham's penal system. Arkham is divided up into Minimum Security and Maximum Security "Cell Blocks". I can post a scan of the article if you'd like. --<a href="../../../b/a/s/User%7EBasique_8925.html" title="User:Basique">Basique</a> 22:54, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>What exactly was disproven?

<p>They are described as <i>a combination hospital and prison for the "criminally insane,"</i>. I more than think my point is made, and I am perfectly willing to abide by the Project's judgement on the issue if we both can't come to an agreement.

<p>Here's the paragraph I mentioned from the Who's Who entry:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Founded in 1921 by Dr. Amadeus Arkham, on a parcel of land deeded to him by his mother, who had herself been a victim of mental illness, the asylum was the first such facility of its kind in Gotham county. Dr. Arkham, a vigorous social reformer, had been appaled by the conditions in the Gotham penal system, where those who were not mentally responsible for their actions were incarcerated side-by-side with hardened career criminals, and he was determined to improve the situation. To that end, hetransformed his ancestral home into a high-security mental facility, and staffed it with some of the most prominent psychologists and physicians of the time."</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>"...first such facility of its kind..."</li>
<li>"...appalled by the conditions in the Gotham penal system..."</li>
<li>"...a high security mental facility..."</li>
</ol>
<p>Your question: "What exactly was disproven?" - the contention that Arkham Asylum is a penal facility.</p>
<p>Your statement: "This is exactly what Broadmoor does did you read this description <a href="../../../p/s/y/Psychiatric_hospital.html#Hospitals_for_prisoners_with_mental_illness" title="Psychiatric hospital">psychiatric hospitals for the criminally insane</a>?" - Just because this is what broadmoor does (and I'm not making a judgement about it atm), does not mean that it's been <b>proven</b> that Arkham and Broadmoor are the <b>same thing</b>. To say so without citation (proof) constitutes <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>.</p>
<p>Your statement: "I'd think the penal schematics would be the icing on the cake", how many hospitals refer to sections as "maximum security cell block" or "isolation cell block"." - check out more information about other institutions for mental health.</p>
<p>This could become even more complex, when on considers that when some "regular" hospitals (as well as other medical institutions) have "lock down" sections (of various names), and some penal complexes have medical facilities, except that that simple paragraph states very clearly what Arkham Asylum <i>is</i>: "a high security mental facility"; as opposed to what it is <i>not</i>: an additional facility in the Gotham penal system. - <a href="../../../j/c/3/User%7EJc37_cfd0.html" title="User:Jc37">jc37</a> 23:45, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Ah I see where you're coming from now, but no one ever said it was part of the <i>Gotham Penal System</i>, it's just referred to as a "Penal Facility". Penal can mean</p>
<ul>
<li>of or relating to punishment; "penal reform"; "penal code"</li>
<li>serving as or designed to impose punishment; "penal servitude"; "a penal colony"</li>
<li>subject to punishment by law; "a penal offense"</li>
</ul>
<p>It does not have to be part of the penal system to be a penal institution, it can be military, or even an offshore corporate facility, or a part of the public health system. Inmates in such a state facility are not only kept there for their own personal welfare, they are kept there to protect the public. --<a href="../../../b/a/s/User%7EBasique_8925.html" title="User:Basique">Basique</a> 23:55, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>In other words, "penal = punishment". Which is <b>not</b> the goal of Arkham Asylum. While it could arguably be considered an incarceratory facility (in addition to a mental health facility, as most asylums were/are), it is <b>not</b> a penal facility. - <a href="../../../j/c/3/User%7EJc37_cfd0.html" title="User:Jc37">jc37</a> 00:07, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Asylums for the criminally insane rarely exist any more. Most were done away with in favor of placing those patients in forenic units in state mental hospitals. That said, an asylum specifically for the criminally insane, among those that still exist, must be licensed as both a hospital and a penal institution. However, I would recommend the more modern term <i>correctional facility</i> for the whole list. <a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoczilla_1c36.html" title="User:Doczilla">Doczilla</a> 03:19, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Better yet, just say "prisons and criminal asylums". But honestly, Basique, even though you're right that DC solicitations call it a prison, it's true that you've got to stop being so confrontational. You could easily have asked for an outside opinion without invoking a term like arbitration. <a href="../../../w/r/y/User%7EWryspy_d7ae.html" title="User:Wryspy">Wryspy</a> 08:11, 25 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Actually, I have to backtrack. I remembered legal opinions on the matter. Official stances are moving away from saying a hospital can be a prison. So either find a better name for the list or remove Arkham and Ravencroft. Or note within the article that it may be inappropriate for DC to refer to Arkham as a prison. <a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoczilla_1c36.html" title="User:Doczilla">Doczilla</a> 07:24, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>My apologies for leaving the discussion so abruptly yesterday. I went to my collection to look for my copy of 'Arkham Asylum<i>, and while doing that, "real life" intruded&#160;: )</i></p>
<p>I also was rather annoyed to find, or rather <i>not</i> find, my copy&#160;: (</p>
<p>I any case, before we "go on", I want to thank you (Basique) for keeping the conversation civil. When you reverted the change (again), even after the request for citations, I had little hope (though still hope indeed&#160;: )</p>
<p>(Back to topic) In a time, when even the writers at DC (or Marvel, for that matter) can't keep the continuity straight, and where even comic book issues are sometimes not even considered "canon", or at least "citable"; attempting to use an ad-writer's (or reviewer's, for that matter) choice of words as a reference isn't the strongest. (Part of the reasons I went looking for my copy, was to see what was actually printed in it/on it... sigh at its apparent loss.)</p>
<p>That aside, as I mentioned above, I have no arguement with anyone calling Arkham a "prison". Gotham itself has been referred to in comics as a "prison", not to mention <b>many</b> other euphemistic references. My concern is the word "penal". Root of "penalize"; meaning to punish.</p>
<p>Doczilla and Wryspy gave some good thoughts and examples above. While I'm not certain even "correctional facility" is correct in usage for a criminal asylum, it is <b>much</b> preferable to "penal" institution.</p>
<p>Let's see if we can find a better name for the list page. - <a href="../../../j/c/3/User%7EJc37_cfd0.html" title="User:Jc37">jc37</a> 11:54, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Duggy and Wryspry read the top of the page please, if you have nothing to contribute to the current discussion, then please refrain from personal attacks.</li>
<li>Considering this discussion between myself and JC was more about coming to a consensus than an actual arguement, both your comments are extremely out of place.</li>
<li>And Duggy please do not use "Basic-boy" in reference to me, that is definately a personal attack.</li>
<li>Going by this and the discussion on the relevant talk page I consider this rather silly matter amicably resolved.</li>
<li>Thank you for your suggestion Doczilla, but as has already been proven in the page's discussion there is no need to rename it. --<a href="../../../b/a/s/User%7EBasique_8925.html" title="User:Basique">Basique</a> 11:49, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>(Even though you apparently posted the above while I was typing my response, I posted my response unchanged.)</p>
<p>First, I don't know what past issues you all may have had in the past, but please, calm down. As I noted above, so far everything's been (mostly) civil. That said, Wryspy is correct that "arbitration" can sound worse than I presume you meant it (considering its current use on Wikipedia). I read the WikiProject talk page and brushed off the usage, so no worries, from me.</p>
<p>I disagree with your final presumption, obviously. Though I do appreciate that you finally have started looking for citations.</p>
<p>My concern (as noted several times above) is the use of the word "penal". I suggest that we find a more "inclusive" word. - <a href="../../../j/c/3/User%7EJc37_cfd0.html" title="User:Jc37">jc37</a> 12:02, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
