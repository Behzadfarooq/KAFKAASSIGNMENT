<p>These games are played with one or more <a href="../../../d/e/c/Deck_%28cards%29.html" title="Deck (cards)">decks</a> of cards, and usually two <a href="../../../j/o/k/Joker_%28playing_card%29.html" title="Joker (playing card)">jokers</a> per deck, although sometimes not all of the jokers are used. The jokers are separated into red and black, which have different values. Some card manufacturers will make jokers of the same color, which then have to be marked as "red" and "black." Variants labelled Bashi Fen, Tuo La Ji, or Zhao Pengyou are generally played with two or more decks, while the rest are played with one.</p>
<p>Which cards beat which depends on the <b><a href="../../../t/r/u/Trump_%28cards%29.html" title="Trump (cards)">trump</a></b> rank and suit. For example, suppose that kings and spades are trump. Then the order of the trump suit, from highest to lowest card, is <font color="red">J</font>, J, K♠, king of any other suit, A♠, Q♠, J♠, 10♠, 9♠, 8♠, 7♠, 6♠, 5♠, 4♠, 3♠, 2♠. Note that the king of clubs is no longer considered a club, but part of the trump suit. If two equally-ranked cards or combinations are played during a trick, the first one wins.</p>

<p>These games may be played with four players in fixed partnerships, or with four or more, where partnerships are fluid and determined as described below. Each player, or each partnership in a fixed-partnership game, has a rank that they are currently playing, henceforth referred to as their <b>score</b>. At the beginning of a match, everyone starts at a score of two, and each player advances by winning rounds. When a player or a partnership <i>passes</i> (rather than attains) a score of ace, a match usually ends. This usually takes several hours, so shorter games may end at a lower threshold, or begin with players' scores higher than two. If an even longer game is desired, players can wrap back around to two after passing ace.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/s/Bashi_Fen_9a11.html" title="Edit section: Dealing">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Dealing</span></h3>
<p>The cards are dealt out in Chinese fashion, where the players take turns drawing one card at a time in counterclockwise order. The deal is initiated in one of two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>One player shuffles the cards and lets any other player cut, then draws the first card.</li>
<li>One player shuffles the cards, then turns over one of them. He then counts, starting from himself and going counterclockwise, until he reaches the number equivalent to the card, where aces count as one, jacks as 11, queens as 12, and kings as 13. (If the card turned over is a joker, another card must be turned over.) The player who is reached draws the first card after the player to his left cuts.</li>
</ul>
<p>During the drawing phase, players decide the trump suit and rank.</p>
<p><a name="Deciding_trump_.28fluid-partnership_games.29" id="Deciding_trump_.28fluid-partnership_games.29"></a></p>
<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/s/Bashi_Fen_9a11.html" title="Edit section: Deciding trump (fluid-partnership games)">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Deciding trump (fluid-partnership games)</span></h4>
<p>If a player satisfies one of the following conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is the first round</li>
<li>In some games, he did not lose the previous game</li>
<li>In other fluid-partnership games, there are no restrictions</li>
</ul>
<p>he may play out one or more <i>identical</i> cards (i.e., of the same suit) equal in rank to his score. The suit and rank of that card become the trump suit, along with jokers, and the player becomes the <b>trumpmaker</b>. In many games, this is final: once trump is declared, no player may change it. However, in some multi-deck games, a player may overbid this in one of several ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>With a number of <i>identical</i> cards of his rank that is greater than the number currently taking.</li>
<li>With a greater number of <i>identical</i> cards of the current trumpmaker's rank than are currently laid out. This change the trump suit, but the old trumpmaker remains the trumpmaker. Of course, this only happens when the criteria for (1) are not satisfied. (only in some versions)</li>
<li>With a greater or equal number than how many are currently laid out--but at least two--<i>identical</i> (i.e. either all red or all black) jokers. This makes it so that none of the four standard suits is trump and the trump suit consists of jokers and the current trump rank only, but the old trumpmaker again remains the trumpmaker. (only in some versions)</li>
<li>With two or more identical jokers. In this case, there is no trump number or suit, and only jokers are trump, and this player becomes the trumpmaker. Sometimes this rule is used without (3); if both (3) and (4) are used, then (3) takes precedence. (only in some versions)</li>
</ol>
<p>Finally, in some versions, the trumpmaker may <b>reinforce</b> his bid by playing additional cards identical to the one(s) he has already revealed. However, in most versions--though possibly not all--a player may not overbid his own bid with a different one. Needless to say, a player is not required to bid if he can.</p>
<p><a name="Deciding_trump_.28fixed-partnership_games.29" id="Deciding_trump_.28fixed-partnership_games.29"></a></p>
<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/s/Bashi_Fen_9a11.html" title="Edit section: Deciding trump (fixed-partnership games)">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Deciding trump (fixed-partnership games)</span></h4>
<p>One player on the attacking team acts as the <b>starter</b>, who is equivalent to the trumpmaker in fluid-partnership games. Only the attacking team's rank may become trump, but anyone can decide the trump suit by playing out cards of the trump rank or jokers as per rules (2), (3), and (4) above, as well as the reinforcing rule, if such rules are used.</p>
<p><a name="Concluding_the_deal" id="Concluding_the_deal"></a></p>
<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/s/Bashi_Fen_9a11.html" title="Edit section: Concluding the deal">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Concluding the deal</span></h4>
<p>Drawing continues until a <b><a href="../../../k/i/t/Kitty.html" title="Kitty">kitty</a></b>, usually consisting of around six cards, remains. In versions with more than four players, the number of jokers may be adjusted so that the kitty is exactly six cards, or the size of the kitty may vary with the number of players. Often, the size of the kitty must be decided on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the scoring system, the number of players, and the number of decks in order to make the game as fair as possible. If the whole drawing phase passes without a bid, one of two things may happen:</p>
<ul>
<li>The deck is reshuffled and the game starts over.</li>
<li>The cards of the kitty are turned over one at a time and, if a card of the attackers' rank is found, its suit becomes trump. Otherwise, the deck is reshuffled. (fixed-partnership games only)</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, sometimes, a player who has no trump, or, in other versions, no point cards (fives, tens, or kings) in his hand, may force a redeal by showing his hand to everyone.</p>
<p>After all the cards are dealt, the trumpmaker picks up the kitty without showing it to anyone, integrates it into his hand, and discards the same number of cards. These cards are kept separate until the end of the game, because they may affect scoring.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/s/Bashi_Fen_9a11.html" title="Edit section: Calling partners (fluid-partnership games only)">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Calling partners (fluid-partnership games only)</span></h3>
<p>In a fluid-partnership game, the trumpmaker must decide on his partner(s). The maximum number of partners he can have is one for four- or five-player games, two for six- or seven-player games, and so on. He must choose that many non-trump cards whose owners he wants to be his partner(s). For each of these cards, he must also choose the precise copy of the card he is calling. For example, in a two-deck six-player game, where threes and diamonds are trump:</p>
<ul>
<li>The trumpmaker might choose the <i>first</i> ace of spades and the <i>second</i> ace of clubs. This means that the first ace of spades played makes its owner the trumpmaker's partner, and the ace of clubs that is played the later of the two does the same.</li>
<li>The trumpmaker might choose the first and second king of spades. This means that each of the kings of spades, when played during the course of the game, make their owners the trumpmaker's partner. Note that this is a risky manoeuver, because if the same player has both kings of spades, then the trumpmaker will only have one partner.</li>
<li>Of course, the orders of the cards need not be different, so the trumpmaker may choose the first ace of spades and the first king of hearts.</li>
<li>He may not call an ace of diamonds, a three of spades, or a red joker, as trump cards may not be called.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, there is nothing that prevents the trumpmaker from playing the card he called, or the same player playing more than one of the called cards, so that the trumpmaker does not always end up with the maximum number of partners.</p>
<p><br />
There are variants where the trumpmaker does not call precise copies of the deciding cards, but color and rank only. For example, in the same two-deck six-player game as above:</p>
<ul>
<li>The trumpmaker calls all black aces. This means the owner(s) of the first two black aces played, whether clubs or spades, becomes his partner(s). The other two have no effect on the partnership.</li>
</ul>
<p>This variant then allows players to choose whether to join the trumpmaker, as they may easily refrain from playing the deciding card. Usually trump cards are allowed to be called under this variant.</p>

<p>The trumpmaker leads the first trick, and the game proceeds like most trick-taking games. A lead may be of one of four types, each with different rules dealing with what can be played on it. As a general rule, a player must always play the number of cards that was led.</p>
<p><a name="Single_cards" id="Single_cards"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/s/Bashi_Fen_9a11.html" title="Edit section: Single cards">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Single cards</span></h3>
<p>Any single card may be lead. In this case, as in most trick-taking games, players must follow suit if they can, and the highest trump, or, if no trump is played, the highest card of the original suit takes the trick. In case of ties, the first of the highest cards wins.</p>
<p><a name="Multiple_identical_cards" id="Multiple_identical_cards"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/s/Bashi_Fen_9a11.html" title="Edit section: Multiple identical cards">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Multiple identical cards</span></h3>
<p>A player may lead a double, triple, and so on of <i>identical</i> cards (henceforth referred to as an <b><i>n</i>-tuple</b>.) However, there are two different possible sets of rules for what can be played during this trick. In any case, only another <i>n</i>-tuple of higher cards in the same suit or of trump can beat a lead of an <i>n</i>-tuple.</p>
<ol>
<li>Doubles force out triples. If an <i>n</i>-tuple is lead,
<ul>
<li>If a player has an <i>n</i>-tuple in the same suit, he must play it, even if this <i>n</i>-tuple is part of an <i>m</i>-tuple, where m&gt;n.</li>
<li>Otherwise, a player must follow suit with any <i>n</i> cards. If the player has fewer than <i>n</i> cards of the suit, he must play all of his cards in that suit and enough additional cards to add up to <i>n</i>.</li>
<li>If a player is out of the suit of the lead, he may play any <i>n</i> cards. He may take the trick by playing an <i>n</i>-tuple of trump, but he does not have to play an <i>n</i>-tuple under any circumstances.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Triples force out doubles. If an <i>n</i>-tuple is lead,
<ul>
<li>If a player has an <i>n</i>-tuple in the same suit, he must play it, but only if this <i>n</i>-tuple is not part of an <i>m</i>-tuple, where <i>m</i>&gt;<i>n</i>. Of course, he can still play it if he wants to.</li>
<li>If a player has <i>k</i>-tuples in the same suit, where <i>k</i>&lt;<i>n</i>, he must play them so as to play the largest possible amount of cards locked in these <i>k</i>-tuples. For example, if a quadruple is lead, and the player has a triple, two doubles, and some number of single cards in the same suit, he must play the two doubles. If he only has a triple, a double, and some singles, he must play the triple and a single. Finally, if he only has a double and singles, he must play the double and two singles.</li>
<li>If a player has no <i>k</i>-tuples in the same suit for any <i>k</i>≤<i>n</i>, he must play <i>n</i> cards of the same suit, even if this means breaking up <i>m</i>-tuples, where <i>m</i>&gt;<i>n</i>. If the player has fewer than <i>n</i> cards of the suit, he must play all of his cards in the suit along with enough additional cards to add up to <i>n</i>.</li>
<li>If a player is out of the suit of the lead, he may play any <i>n</i> cards. He may take the trick by playing an <i>n</i>-tuple of trump, but he does not have to play an <i>n</i>-tuple under any circumstances.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p><a name="Consecutive_n-tuples" id="Consecutive_n-tuples"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/s/Bashi_Fen_9a11.html" title="Edit section: Consecutive n-tuples">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Consecutive <i>n</i>-tuples</span></h3>
<p>A player may lead <i>m</i> <i>n</i>-tuples as one trick if they are consecutive in rank. Occasionally, these combinations are named after various vehicles, depending on <i>m</i>. If <i>m</i>=2, the combination is called a <b>tractor</b>, which gives the game one of its names, Tuo La Ji. For example, if sevens and diamonds are trump, a player may lead</p>
<ul>
<li><font color="red">3♥</font>-<font color="red">3♥</font>-<font color="red">4♥</font>-<font color="red">4♥</font>.</li>
<li>6♣-6♣-6♣-8♣-8♣-8♣ — these are consecutive since 7c is a member of the trump suit rather than of clubs.</li>
<li><font color="red">6♦</font>-<font color="red">6♦</font>-<font color="red">8♦</font>-<font color="red">8♦</font>-<font color="red">9♦</font>-<font color="red">9♦</font> — these are consecutive since 7d is higher than either.</li>
</ul>
<p>According to some rules, a consecutive double may not include high trump (cards of the trump rank or jokers.) According to other rules, however, the following are also valid leads, assuming once again that sevens and diamonds are trump:</p>
<ul>
<li><font color="red">K♦</font>-<font color="red">K♦</font>-<font color="red">A♦</font>-<font color="red">A♦</font>-<font color="red">7♥</font>-<font color="red">7♥</font>-<font color="red">7♦</font>-<font color="red">7♦</font>.</li>
<li><font color="red">7♦</font>-<font color="red">7♦</font>-J-J.</li>
<li>J-J-<font color="red">J</font>-<font color="red">J</font>.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, the following are never valid leads with this trump:</p>
<ul>
<li><font color="red">3♥</font>-<font color="red">3♥</font>-<font color="red">4♥</font>-<font color="red">4♥</font>-<font color="red">4♥</font> — <i>n</i> must be the same for the whole play.</li>
<li><font color="red">7♥</font>-<font color="red">7♥</font>-7♠-7♠ — these cards are equal, not consecutive, in rank.</li>
<li><font color="red">6♥</font>-<font color="red">6♥</font>-<font color="red">7♥</font>-<font color="red">7♥</font> — these cards are not consecutive because sevens are high trump.</li>
</ul>
<p>Rules also differ as to what plays may follow a consecutive <i>n</i>-tuple. According to some rules, if a player also has <i>m</i> consecutive <i>n</i>-tuples along with other <i>n</i>-tuples, he must play this combination, but according to others, this player may play any <i>m</i> <i>n</i>-tuples. Also, either (1) or (2) in the section on single <i>n</i>-tuples must be followed. If (2) is followed, and a player has no <i>n</i>-tuples, he must play as many <i>k</i>-tuples as fit into the whole combination. For example, if 333444 of hearts has been led, and a player has one triple and several doubles and singles of hearts, he must play the triple, a double, and a single. However, if he has no triples but three doubles of hearts, he must play all three doubles. Also, if 333444555 of hearts had been led instead, and a player has a triple and three doubles along with some singles of hearts, he must play the triple and the three doubles.</p>
<p>In some one-deck games, consecutive singles are allowed.</p>
<p>In any case, the only combination that can beat <i>m</i> consecutive <i>n</i>-tuples is another set of <i>m</i> consecutive <i>n</i>-tuples, and not, for example, a set of <i>n</i> consecutive <i>m</i>-tuples.</p>

<p>There are two main variations of this rule, although there may be others.</p>
<ol>
<li>A player may lead, as one play, any number of combinations of one suit that <i>individually</i> cannot be beaten within the suit. For example, when jacks and clubs are trump in a three-deck game...
<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2">
<tr>
<td>...the following combinations may be played as one trick...</td>
<td>...if the following cards have previously been played</td>

<tr>

<td>None; both the ace and the triple are already unbeatable within the suit, since the ace is in the same player's hand</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>K♠-K♠-Q♠-10♠-10♠</td>
<td>Three A♠ and one K♠ (to make the single queen unbeatable), and one Q♠ (to make the double tens unbeatable; jacks are trump and therefore don't matter)</td>
</tr>

<li>A player may lead, as one play, any number of <i>n</i>-tuples or singles of one suit as long as all other cards of the suit that are equal or higher have been played. However, he may not lead mixed plays, for example a single and a double.</li>
</ol>
<p>In either case, other players must follow suit to the extent possible, playing cards in such a way that if the trick were split up into single <i>n</i>-tuples their plays would still be valid. If another player plays all trump on this trick, with the same number of <i>n</i>-tuples as the original play for every <i>n</i>, he can take the trick. If more than one player does this, then the player with the <i>n</i>-tuple of the largest rank with the greatest <i>n</i> played wins the trick. For example, if jacks and clubs are trump, the initial player leads A♠-K♠-K♠, another player plays 3♣-3♣-Q♣, and a third plays 3♣-4♣-4♣, the last player wins, since he had the highest double of trump. On the other hand, if the last player had played 3♣-3♣-A♣, the second player would have won, because the earlier player wins in the case of a tie.</p>
<p>One way of ensuring that this rule is used in good faith is the following addition: if there are cards in another player's hand that can beat elements of the play (if using rule 1) or that are higher than or equal to an element of the play (if using rule 2), then he may reveal it, and the player who is leading must play only the lowest combination in his intended play.</p>
<p>There may be other variations of this rule, as well as other ways of enforcing it.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/s/Bashi_Fen_9a11.html" title="Edit section: Scoring">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Scoring</span></h2>
<p>Players receive points by taking tricks containing fives (worth 5 points), tens, and kings (worth 10 points each), making a total of 100 points per deck. Points received by the attackers are discarded along with all worthless cards, while points received by the defenders are put into a separate pile. If not all partnerships have been declared yet, the points each player who is not known to be the trumpmaker's partner earns are put in a pile in front of him.</p>
<p>If the defenders take the last trick, then the cards the trumpmaker discarded at the beginning of the game are turned over and any points in there are, depending on the rules used, doubled, multiplied by two times the number of cards in the last trick — e.g., by 6 if the lead in the last trick was a triple — or multiplied by the number of decks used, and added to the defenders' points.</p>
<p>There is a profusion of ways of converting the raw points into increases in score. A common one is shown below, where <i>p</i> is the number of points earned by the defenders and <i>d</i> is the number of decks used. Variations differ in the size and number of brackets. For example, in some it is impossible for a player's score to go up by more than two. In others, it is impossible for no one's score to go up, with the defenders' score increasing starting with either 40<i>d</i> or 50<i>d</i>.</p>

<ul>
<li>While the total point cards in the game add up to 100<i>d</i>, the defenders may earn more than that since points among the trumpmaker's discarded cards count for more than they would normally be worth.</li>
</ul>
<p>In some variations, the attackers' score increases more if there are fewer than the maximum number of attackers.</p>

<ol>
<li>When jacks are the trump rank, and a team wins the last trick with a jack of the trump suit, capturing the opposing team's minor jack, the scores of the members of the team whose minor jack is captured go back to two.</li>
<li>Some scores might be mandatory and cannot be skipped. For example, if ten is mandatory and player X is on nines and goes up 3 ranks, he moves to ten rather than queen.</li>
