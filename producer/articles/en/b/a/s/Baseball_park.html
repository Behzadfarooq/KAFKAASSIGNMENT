Diagram of a baseball infield.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The <a href="../../../b/a/s/Baseball_field.html" title="Baseball field">infield</a> is a rigidly structured "diamond" (actually a square) containing the bases, home plate, and the pitcher's mound. Two white foul lines run perpendicular along two of the sides from the plate, forming the boundaries of what's in play and what's out of play.</p>
<p>Next to first and third base, are two coach's boxes, where the first and third base coaches guide the baserunners. Farther on the other side of the foul lines are the dugouts where the teams and coaches sit when they're not out on the field.</p>
<p>Beyond the infield, and between the foul lines, is a large grass outfield, generally twice the depth of the infield. The other side of the outfield is set by the outfield fences, which end the field of play. There are also fences in foul territory, although these are significantly lower in most places, especially around the infield.</p>
<p>In modern days, a ballpark is mostly surrounded by a multi-tiered seating structure, a grandstand. This often ends a short distance into fair territory, the area beyond the outfield fences being a more open area, perhaps with a view of the buildings beyond. This open area may contain shorter disconnected grandstands, bleacher seats, scoreboards, fountains, or open-air museums, just to name a few. In some Jewelbox and multi-purpose parks, the grandstand completely surrounds the field.</p>
<p>Starting with <a href="../../../y/a/n/Yankee_Stadium_25aa.html" title="Yankee Stadium">Yankee Stadium</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/2/1923.html" title="1923">1923</a> (as an actual footrace track) and now present in all ballparks, there is a dirt (or in some parks, rubberized track surface) area roughly 10 feet wide which runs all about the perimeter of the field, called the "warning track". As the name indicates, this track is intended to warn fielders (especially <a href="../../../o/u/t/Outfielder.html" title="Outfielder">outfielders</a>) that they are approaching a boundary wall of the playing field.</p>

<p>The structure of the infield is very rigid. However, like its British relative <a href="../../../c/r/i/Cricket.html" title="Cricket">cricket</a>, there is significant amount of flexibility in the shape and size of the rest of the playing area. This is distinctive from "goal" games such as <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_football.html" title="American football">football</a>, <a href="../../../s/o/c/Soccer.html" title="Soccer">soccer</a>, and <a href="../../../b/a/s/Basketball.html" title="Basketball">basketball</a>, in which the entire playing area is fixed in size. In order to prevent "cheap" home runs, ballparks at particular levels of play usually specify a minimum distance from home plate to the outfield fences, along with recommendations for the size of the foul ground. Generally, the higher up the skill level, the deeper the minimum dimensions must be. In the major leagues, a rule was passed in 1958 (<a href="http://mlb.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/mlb/official_info/official_rules/foreword.jsp" class="external text" title="http://mlb.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/mlb/official_info/official_rules/foreword.jsp" rel="nofollow">official rules</a>) that compelled any new fields built after that point to have a minimum distance of 325 feet from home plate to the fences in left and right field, and 400 feet to center. Despite this rule (which was passed to prevent any more situations like the <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles_Memorial_Coliseum_f2f1.html#Other_notable_uses" title="Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum">Los Angeles Coliseum</a>), the modern parks have sometimes received "special dispensation" to skirt these rules somewhat. The older parks such as <a href="../../../f/e/n/Fenway_Park_891e.html" title="Fenway Park">Fenway Park</a> were "grandfathered."</p>

</div>
<p>As there is merely a minimum, and no set distance (and even the minumums aren't strictly enforced), there is a great amount of flexibility. These distances vary from park to park, and can even change drastically in the same park. This can be seen in <a href="../../../y/a/n/Yankee_Stadium_25aa.html" title="Yankee Stadium">Yankee Stadium</a>, whose odd-shaped plot of land caused right field to be over 100 feet shorter than left, although this has lessened over the years. The <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polo_Grounds_af11.html" title="Polo Grounds">Polo Grounds</a> had very short fences on the lines. It was 258 feet to right and 280 to left, and the upper deck hung over into the infield in left. In contrast, the deepest part of center field in the bathtub-shaped Polo Grounds was nearly 500 feet from home plate.</p>
<p>The heights of the fences can also change greatly, the best example being the 37-foot high <a href="../../../g/r/e/Green_Monster_6b23.html" title="Green Monster">Green Monster</a> in <a href="../../../f/e/n/Fenway_Park_891e.html" title="Fenway Park">Fenway Park</a>'s left field. Such tall fences were often used to stop easy home runs in a section where the fences were shorter, or there was little space between the fence and street beyond, although this practice has lessened in more recent years. Some in-play scoreboards and high fences reached 50 to 60 feet, whereas a few outfields were even lined with hedges rather than normal fences or walls. The <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metrodome.html" title="Metrodome">Metrodome</a>, the current home of the <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minnesota_Twins_4085.html" title="Minnesota Twins">Minnesota Twins</a>, has a 23-foot right field "fence" which is actually a relatively thin blue plastic sheet covering folded-up football seats. It is often called the "Baggie" or the "Hefty bag".</p>
<p>Some parks don't even have regularly shaped fences. While some parks may have round swooping fences or rigidly angled fences, some may have a big change in direction or irregular angle. Some retro parks, such as <a href="../../../r/a/n/Rangers_Ballpark_in_Arlington_c155.html" title="Rangers Ballpark in Arlington">Rangers Ballpark in Arlington</a>, throw in a sudden inward turn (often referred to as a jog) just to give a little quirkiness to the design.</p>
<p>Originally, and mostly in the Jewelbox Parks, these variations where the result of the shape of the property on which the park was constructed. If there was a street beyond left field, left field would be shorter, and if the distance was too short, the fence would be higher. Now, these variations are mostly influenced by the specifications and the whims of the designers. The retro parks, which try to recapture the feel of the Jewelboxes, are designed to have these quirks and variations.</p>

Elysian Fields.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The first baseball parks were literally open fields or public parks. The genesis of modern baseball is conventionally connected with the <a href="../../../e/l/y/Elysian_Fields%2C_Hoboken%2C_New_Jersey_2c13.html" title="Elysian Fields, Hoboken, New Jersey">Elysian Fields</a> in <a href="../../../h/o/b/Hoboken%2C_New_Jersey_7814.html" title="Hoboken, New Jersey">Hoboken, New Jersey</a>, a large public park where the businessmen of New York City gathered from time to time to play organized baseball games and cricket matches, starting around the mid-1840s. The name "Field" or "Park" was typically attached to the names of the early ballparks.</p>
<p>With the beginnings of professional baseball, the ballfield became part of a complex including fixed spectator seating areas, and an enclosure to restrict access to paying customers, as with a fairgrounds. The name "Grounds" began to be attached to ballparks, starting with the <a href="../../../u/n/i/Union_Grounds_aee4.html" title="Union Grounds">Union Grounds</a> in 1862. The suffixes "Field" and "Park" were still used, but many professional ballparks were "Grounds". The last surviving major league "Grounds" was the <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polo_Grounds_af11.html" title="Polo Grounds">Polo Grounds</a> in New York City, which was razed in 1964.</p>
<p>The term "Stadium" had been used since ancient times, typically for a running track and its seating area. As college football gained in popularity, the smaller college playing fields and/or running tracks (which also frequently had the suffix "Field") gave way to large stadiums, many of them built during the sports "boom" of the 1920s. Major league baseball enjoyed a similar boom. One of the first major league ballparks to be called a "Stadium" was actually the Polo Grounds, which was temporarily renamed Brush Stadium from its reconstruction in 1911 until the death of owner John T. Brush in the 1920s. By then, the most famous baseball "Stadium" of them all had been constructed: <a href="../../../y/a/n/Yankee_Stadium_25aa.html" title="Yankee Stadium">Yankee Stadium</a>. From that point until the retro building boom of the 1990s, the suffix "Stadium" was used for almost every new major league ballpark, and was sometimes applied to the old ones, such as <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shibe_Park_ac6c.html" title="Shibe Park">Shibe Park</a>, which was renamed Connie Mack Stadium in 1954.</p>
<p>The suffix "Dome" was also used for the domed stadiums constructed in the 1960s-1970s-1980s. The official names of those arenas also often included the word "Stadium", such as the Houston <a href="../../../a/s/t/Astrodome.html" title="Astrodome">Astrodome</a>, whose formal name was "Harris County Domed Stadium" in 1965; the <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kingdome.html" title="Kingdome">Kingdome</a>, whose formal name was "King County Domed Stadium; and the <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metrodome.html" title="Metrodome">Metrodome</a>, for which the Minneapolis highway signs direct the driver to "Metrodome Stadium". The retro era of the 1990s and early 2000s saw a return to the original arboreal terms, even to the huge domed structures, such as <a href="../../../s/a/f/Safeco_Field_0b97.html" title="Safeco Field">Safeco Field</a> and <a href="../../../m/i/l/Miller_Park_9238.html" title="Miller Park">Miller Park</a>.</p>
<p>There appears to have been no consistency in which suffix to choose, "Field" or "Park". It is apparently a decision based on which suffix "sounds" better for a given ballpark name. For example, Chicago's <a href="../../../w/r/i/Wrigley_Field_d92d.html" title="Wrigley Field">Wrigley Field</a> had been previously called "Cubs Park".</p>

<p>The original major league parks were large <b>wooden ballparks</b> with the seats mounted on wood platforms, although wooden parks some had iron columns for better support. There was usually only one deck, which was sometimes topped by a flat roof, sometimes with a small upper tier. The outfield was bordered by tall walls or fences covered with advertisements, sometimes fronted with bleacher seats ("bleaching boards"). Wood was a short-life but inexpensive material, and there was not necessarily any expectation that professional baseball was a long-term business.</p>
<p>However, the use of wood as the primary material set up a potentially major problem, especially as baseball continued to thrive and the wooden stands aged and dried. Many parks caught fire, and some were levelled completely. This problem, along with the realization that professional baseball was here to stay, were major factors that drove the change to steel and concrete construction. Some famous wooden parks, such as the <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polo_Grounds_af11.html" title="Polo Grounds">Polo Grounds</a>, burned to the ground and were rebuilt in fire-resistant materials. Others were simply abandoned in favor of new structures built elsewhere. Their replacements often lasted many decades and (retrospectively) came to be called "Jewel Boxes". The last of the primarily-wooden ballparks in the major leagues was <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robison_Field_c419.html" title="Robison Field">Robison Field</a>, which was closed in 1920.</p>

<p>The parks built or rebuilt in concrete and steel (albeit with wooden seats) after the days of the wooden ballpark are now known as the <b>Jewel Box Parks</b>. These parks are said by many to embody the golden age of baseball, and are known for their green seats, large roofs, intimate feel, and major use of exposed steel, brick, and stone. Although other sports, such as <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_football.html" title="American football">football</a> and <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football_%28soccer%29.html" title="Football (soccer)">soccer</a> were often played at these sites, the focus was on baseball, unlike the later multi-purpose parks, and so the seats were generally angled in a configuration suitable for baseball. The "retro" ballparks built in the 1990s and beyond are an attempt to capture the feel of the Jewel Box Parks.</p>
<p>Many (as well as their wooden predecessors) have plaques or monuments on their sites. Remnants of some Jewel Boxes still exist, such as <a href="../../../f/o/r/Forbes_Field_090c.html" title="Forbes Field">Forbes Field</a>, <a href="../../../l/e/a/League_Park_785b.html" title="League Park">League Park</a> and <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nickerson_Field_65a8.html" title="Nickerson Field">Braves Field</a>.

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/s/Baseball_park.html" title="Edit section: Multi-purpose stadiums">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Multi-purpose stadiums</span></h3>
<p>From the 60's to the 90's, baseball was dominated by <b>multi-purpose stadiums</b>. Also known as "concrete donuts", "Cookie cutters", or "giant ashtrays", they were usually tall circular or square structures made of plain concrete (one notable exception is <a href="../../../s/h/e/Shea_Stadium_9f78.html" title="Shea Stadium">Shea Stadium</a>). The parks were built to hold baseball as well as football, soccer, and other sports. The seats were not angled correctly for baseball, and the seating capacity was so large that many (especially Cleveland's <a href="../../../c/l/e/Cleveland_Stadium_630e.html" title="Cleveland Stadium">Municipal Stadium</a>) looked empty during baseball games, which don't draw as many people per game as the other tenants. While cost effective to put all teams in one park, these problems eventually caused the parks to become unfashionable.</p>
<p>Some multi-purpose parks, such as <a href="../../../d/o/l/Dolphin_Stadium_97dc.html" title="Dolphin Stadium">Dolphin Stadium</a>, <a href="../../../m/e/m/Memorial_Stadium_%28Baltimore%29_ed1d.html" title="Memorial Stadium (Baltimore)">Memorial Stadium</a>, <a href="../../../q/u/a/Qualcomm_Stadium_e9cc.html" title="Qualcomm Stadium">San Diego Stadium</a> and <a href="../../../m/c/a/McAfee_Coliseum_7c65.html" title="McAfee Coliseum">Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum</a>, began as solely a football stadium. Others, such as <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monster_Park_7dc0.html" title="Monster Park">Candlestick Park</a> and <a href="../../../c/l/e/Cleveland_Stadium_630e.html" title="Cleveland Stadium">Cleveland Municipal Stadium</a>, began as solely a baseball park.</p>
<p>A subset of the multipurpose stadiums were the so called <a href="../../../c/o/o/Cookie_cutter_stadium.html" title="Cookie cutter stadium">cookie cutter stadiums</a> which were all very similar in design. They featured a completely circular or nearly circular design, football fields that were placed home plate to center field over the baseball field, tall outer structures and often used <a href="../../../a/s/t/Astroturf.html" title="Astroturf">astroturf</a>. The first of these stadiums was <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_F._Kennedy_Memorial_Stadium_d0f4.html" title="Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium">RFK Stadium</a>. It was followed during the 1960's and 1970's by <a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlanta-Fulton_County_Stadium_123b.html" title="Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium">Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium</a>, <a href="../../../c/i/n/Cinergy_Field_7493.html" title="Cinergy Field">Riverfront Stadium</a>, <a href="../../../b/u/s/Busch_Memorial_Stadium_4e18.html" title="Busch Memorial Stadium">Busch Memorial Stadium</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/r/Three_Rivers_Stadium_8d1e.html" title="Three Rivers Stadium">Three Rivers Stadium</a>, and <a href="../../../v/e/t/Veterans_Stadium_4b72.html" title="Veterans Stadium">Veterans Stadium</a>. <a href="../../../r/e/l/Reliant_Astrodome_7610.html" title="Reliant Astrodome">The Astrodome</a> and the <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kingdome.html" title="Kingdome">Kingdome</a> are also often considered part of the cookie cutter subset due to their design conforming to the standard with the added addition of a roof. <a href="../../../s/h/e/Shea_Stadium_9f78.html" title="Shea Stadium">Shea Stadium</a> is also often included in the cookie cutter subset due to the original design specifications calling for Shea Stadium to have been circular. Shea shares much of its remaining design characteristics with the standard cookie cutter parks. All of these stadiums have either been replaced or in the case of RFK Stadium and Shea Stadium there are plans to replace them with sport specific parks in the near future.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/s/Baseball_park.html" title="Edit section: Modern stadiums">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Modern stadiums</span></h3>
<p>While most teams turned to multi-purpose parks, some instead chose to build baseball-only parks. While these <b>modern stadiums</b> went away from the Jewel Box Parks, and incorporated aspects from the multi-purpose parks (such as seating colors other than green and fairly plain concrete exteriors), they had a more elegant feel to them, and, more importantly, were built for baseball. While the multi-purpose parks have become all but extinct, some modern parks, such as <a href="../../../d/o/d/Dodger_Stadium_72ba.html" title="Dodger Stadium">Dodger Stadium</a> and <a href="../../../k/a/u/Kauffman_Stadium_5f13.html" title="Kauffman Stadium">Kauffman Stadium</a>, have been hailed for aging beautifully over the decades. Modern parks can be often be identified by cantilevered upper decks, which forgo the larger roofs of Jewel Box Parks with steel columns for smaller roofs that only cover the top rows.</p>
<p>In the 70's, <a href="../../../y/a/n/Yankee_Stadium_25aa.html" title="Yankee Stadium">Yankee Stadium</a>, a Jewel Box Park, was renovated, and architecturally turned into a modern park, although the stadium's historical roots cause it to still be considered a Jewel Box Park.</p>

<p>Although mostly multi-purpose parks, a unique and important type of ballpark is the <b>indoor park</b>. Mostly domes, these parks were covered with a fixed roof. Reasons for this varied. The Astrodome was built to escape parching heat, while the Kingdome was built to escape constant rains. There was little to no outside light, and this caused one of the most distinguishing aspects of an indoor park, the use of turf rather than grass. The <a href="../../../h/u/b/Hubert_H._Humphrey_Metrodome_d019.html" title="Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome">Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome</a> is unique in this aspect in that its roof admits light and it could possibly use natural grass, but uses turf instead.</p>
<p>A park of note is <a href="../../../o/l/y/Olympic_Stadium_%28Montreal%29_d551.html" title="Olympic Stadium (Montreal)">Olympic Stadium</a> in Montreal. The park was designed with a large tower over it, cables coming down to connect to the large oval center of the roof which was supposed to raise when the weather outside was pleasant. However, it never worked, and so what was supposed to be a retractable roof park became an indoor one.</p>
<p>Examples include the Astrodome, the Kingdome, Olympic Stadium, the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome, and <a href="../../../t/r/o/Tropicana_Field_f12b.html" title="Tropicana Field">Tropicana Field</a>.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/s/Baseball_park.html" title="Edit section: Retractable roof parks">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Retractable roof parks</span></h3>
<p>As mentioned before, the indoor parks were built for several different reasons, chief among those weather. However, as multi-purpose parks became unfashionable, so did the drab indoor parks. Therefore, <b>retractable roof parks</b> were born. These parks allowed shelter from the elements, but could be opened on a nice day. To be able to support the roof, most of these parks were closed in on all sides, although the walls feature openings or windows. Because the roofs need to go somewhere when retracted, most retractable roof parks have a large structure on one side of the park itself, which is used for things such as retail or parking. Notable exceptions include <a href="../../../r/o/g/Rogers_Centre_2434.html" title="Rogers Centre">Rogers Centre</a> and <a href="../../../m/i/l/Miller_Park_9238.html" title="Miller Park">Miller Park</a>, whose roofs fold upon themselves in a way that takes up little space when open. The roofs often still hang over the sides of the park, and cast large shadows on the field or stands. This is countered at Miller Park by large panes of glass under the roof.</p>
<p>Retractable roof parks can either be utilitarian and unadorned, such as <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chase_Field_a4ee.html" title="Chase Field">Chase Field</a>, or infused with retro elements, such as <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minute_Maid_Park_ff96.html" title="Minute Maid Park">Minute Maid Park</a>.</p>

<p>In 1992, <a href="../../../o/r/i/Oriole_Park_at_Camden_Yards_92b0.html" title="Oriole Park at Camden Yards">Oriole Park at Camden Yards</a> opened in <a href="../../../b/a/l/Baltimore.html" title="Baltimore">Baltimore</a> as the new home of the <a href="../../../b/a/l/Baltimore_Orioles_01d9.html" title="Baltimore Orioles">Baltimore Orioles</a>. Going in a different direction than the multi-purpose and modern stadiums, Camden Yards harkened back to the old Jewel Box Parks. This began the building of a series of parks known as the <b>retro-classic</b> or simply <b>retro ballparks</b>.</p>
<p>The retro parks shifted back to the green seats, use of exposed steel, brick, and stone, and quirky dimensions and features. The 325/400-foot rule mentioned above has been rarely enforced during this time.</p>
<p>Teams with multi-purpose parks longed for the beautiful and classic look, and began systematically demolishing them and moving to either retro or retractable roof parks. Since Camden Yards opened, 2/3rds of all major league teams have opened new ballparks, each of which contain unique features. Also, each of them were made to be baseball-only.</p>
<p><a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._Cellular_Field_6464.html" title="U.S. Cellular Field">U.S. Cellular Field</a> was the last modern park, and was built a year before Camden Yards was built. Just missing the retro movement, it was now viewed as obsolete, and a series of renovations were done, including the changing from a centilever to a flat roof with columns, and the change from a symmetrical outfield to an asymmetrical one.</p>
<p>Examples include Camden Yards, <a href="../../../c/o/o/Coors_Field_5118.html" title="Coors Field">Coors Field</a>, <a href="../../../r/a/n/Rangers_Ballpark_in_Arlington_c155.html" title="Rangers Ballpark in Arlington">The Ballpark in Arlington</a>, <a href="../../../a/t/%26/AT%26T_Park_3d25.html" title="AT&amp;T Park">AT&amp;T Park</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comerica_Park_872f.html" title="Comerica Park">Comerica Park</a>, and <a href="../../../b/u/s/Busch_Stadium_2185.html" title="Busch Stadium">Busch Stadium</a>.</p>

Fenway used to have a mound of dirt in left field that caused an outfielder to have to run uphill. It was called "Duffy's Cliff" after left fielder <a href="../../../d/u/f/Duffy_Lewis_59a9.html" title="Duffy Lewis">Duffy Lewis</a>. Fenway's right field is also notable, with "Pesky's Pole" (named for former Red Sox, <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johnny_Pesky_f509.html" title="Johnny Pesky">Johnny Pesky</a>) just 302 feet from home plate, but then the fence runs virtually straight away from home to 380 in deep right.</li>

The rest of the year, the vines are bare. From time to time, a batted ball will become lodged in the vines, or even its bare branches, and become a ground-rule double. The park's close proximity to <a href="../../../l/a/k/Lake_Michigan_0b4b.html" title="Lake Michigan">Lake Michigan</a> affects the wind currents from day to day or even hour to hour. When the wind is blowing <i>in</i>, the park becomes a "pitcher's park" despite its cozy power alleys. When the wind is blowing <i>out</i>, it can be "Bombs Away!" The lack of a second deck in the outfield seating further lets Mother Nature have its way with the wind. It also allows residents of the flats across the streets to get relatively unobstructed views of the field, and some owners have even installed small grandstands on top of their buildings. Wrigley Field was the last MLB park to install field lights; the first night home game for the Cubs took place in 1988.</li>

Beyond the left field fences, between the bullpens is <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monument_Park_8ef8.html" title="Monument Park">Monument Park</a>, containing monuments and plaques honoring Yankee greats as well as others who have had an impact on the team or city. Before 1973, the three original monuments were in the field of play. Another distinguishing characteristic is the Facade, a series of archways that originally ran across the stadium's roof, and now tops the wall behind the outfield bleacher seats. The 4 train, which runs diagonally behind this wall, gets a peek in through a large gap.</li>

There is also a large pillar sticking out beyond home plate atop the upper level seats, that bears the Dodgers logo. The setting sun reflects off those hills and can give the pitchers a distinct advantage, which the Dodgers have capitalized upon frequently.</li>

This is due to the upper deck conforming to a baseball layout rather than being a pure circle, resulting in stands of varying width instead of being uniformly wide.</li>

Shea is a perfect circle, with a section cut out with it. Originally, the circle was to be completed, but these plans were abandoned, and thus the area beyond the outfield fences is sparse, and gives the stadium a very open feel. In this area is a large scoreboard, topped with a silhouette of the New York City skyline, and a large top hat with an apple that pops out when a home run is hit by the Mets.</li>

At the top is three logs forming an "A". The roof over the dugouts continues, connecting the two to form a dugout-level seating.

The stadium also has speakers hanging from the roof which sometimes figure into play. Over the years the roof has become more and more soiled, and can be a nightmare for outfielders unused to it and trying to follow the flight of a batted ball. Designed with primarily football in mind, the result is a rectangular, rather an a square or oval, outfield.</li>

The stadium is completely closed in, with offices walling in the space beyond the outfield. This can create a swirling wind effect that gives some hits a bit of lift they wouldn't get otherwise, and sending them out. Right-center field fence has an inward "jog", a feature of artificial quirkiness that several recent ballparks have included.</li>

The area, which sits in front of a tall green wall, is a large rock outcropping with a few ponds and waterfalls, and a number of evergreen trees. Atop this "rockpile" is a standalone and very distant bleacher section.</li>

The major one has to do with its catwalks. Four catwalks encircle the dome's interior, with the two towards the infield being in play. A ball hit off of them can be caught for an out. The two towards the outfield are out of play, and, when hit, are either a home run or a foul ball, depending on where it hits in relation to the foul poles.</li>

While most retractable roofs form a complete enclosure, Safeco's forms more of an umbrella. The roof is supported by large steel structures that run on tracks, and these structures are very open, barely obscuring the view to the outside. The stadium is shielded from the rain, but is still very open.</li>

The area is called McCovey Cove (named for former Giants slugger <a href="../../../w/i/l/Willie_McCovey_589c.html" title="Willie McCovey">Willie McCovey</a>), and is often filled with boaters hoping to catch baseballs hit out of the park (a baseball will float in the water initially), just as fans used to empty the right field bleachers at <a href="../../../c/a/n/Candlestick_Park_664a.html" title="Candlestick Park">Candlestick Park</a> and gather on the flat ground when McCovey would come to bat. The right field line is rather close, and although the wall angles away sharply, a "jog" in right-center neutralizes that angle somewhat. There is a special scoreboard near the right field wall that counts how many fair balls have been hit into the bay during game play by the San Francisco Giants (called "Splash Hits"). Many of those have been hit by <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barry_Bonds_ea55.html" title="Barry Bonds">Barry Bonds</a>, the lefthanded slugger whose presence strongly influenced the design of the ballpark, as legend says Yankee Stadium's short porch was for <a href="../../../b/a/b/Babe_Ruth_8c7f.html" title="Babe Ruth">Ruth</a>.</li>

Above the left field wall, Comerica has its own monument park filled with large statues to the Tiger greats. Over the left field stands, one can see <a href="../../../f/o/r/Ford_Field_7d12.html" title="Ford Field">Ford Field</a> looming, which was built in the same project as the park. The scoreboard is topped by two large tigers, and when a homerun is hit, their eyes light up and the sound of a tiger growl is played over the speakers. Beyond the outfield is a great view of downtown Detroit, including the Wyland Whale mural, although this was covered with a Verizon ad during the 2006 postseason. The problem with this is that downtown is south of the stadium, and therefore gives the majority of the spectators and the batter an eyeful of sunlight as the sun sets. The park started its life with an extremely deep left-center field, but the fences have since been changed, parhaps having something to do with the sudden change in the teams fortune in 2006.</li>

It is the only park in major league baseball with a <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flagpole.html" title="Flagpole">flagpole</a> in play, another purely decorative feature borrowed from the old <a href="../../../t/i/g/Tiger_Stadium_%28Detroit%29_4914.html" title="Tiger Stadium (Detroit)">Tiger Stadium</a> in Detroit. First baseman <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richie_Sexson_9fb5.html" title="Richie Sexson">Richie Sexson</a>, then of the <a href="../../../m/i/l/Milwaukee_Brewers_b2f3.html" title="Milwaukee Brewers">Milwaukee Brewers</a> is the only player to have hit the flagpole during a game. Its cozy dimensions, especially in left field, have led to its being called the "Juice Box". The Astros have been competitive in the early years of the ballpark, and the stadium fans can be very noisy when the roof is closed.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../m/i/l/Miller_Park_9238.html" title="Miller Park">Miller Park</a> (<a href="../../../m/i/l/Milwaukee_Brewers_b2f3.html" title="Milwaukee Brewers">Milwaukee Brewers</a>) - In the left field corner houses "Bernie's Dugout", which is the home of the Brewers mascot, <a href="../../../b/e/r/Bernie_Brewer_ac0c.html" title="Bernie Brewer">Bernie Brewer</a>. At the beginning of the game, after every Brewers <a href="../../../h/o/m/Home_run.html" title="Home run">home run</a>, and if the Brewers win, fireworks go off and Bernie slides down his slide. He also hangs "K"s to signify strikeouts. In 2006, a picnic area was added in right field. The retractable roof is unique in that it folds and unfolds like a fan, from a single pivot point, rather than sliding in parallel sections as most do. The arc-shaped trusses needed to support this roof make the ballpark nearly twice as high as it would be without a roof, dominating its surroundings.</li>

<li><a href="../../../p/n/c/PNC_Park_b5c2.html" title="PNC Park">PNC Park</a> (<a href="../../../p/i/t/Pittsburgh_Pirates_22c6.html" title="Pittsburgh Pirates">Pittsburgh Pirates</a>) - The park was built on the <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allegheny_River_87c0.html" title="Allegheny River">Allegheny River</a>, and its low walls behind the outfield seats allow an amazing view of the river, and skyline of downtown Pittsburgh that rests on the other side.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_American_Ballpark_5ab2.html" title="Great American Ballpark">Great American Ballpark</a> (<a href="../../../c/i/n/Cincinnati_Reds_7554.html" title="Cincinnati Reds">Cincinnati Reds</a>) - Sitting on the <a href="../../../o/h/i/Ohio_River_8c4c.html" title="Ohio River">Ohio River</a>, the park has the same relationship to the water that AT&amp;T and PNC have. Beyond the right-center fence sits two large steamboat smokestacks that belch smoke, flash lights, and shoot fireworks to incite the crowd or celebrate an act of the home team. The most prominent feature is a large gap in the grandstand. As the outfield is towards the river, and away from downtown Cincinnati, there is a large gap in the grandstands that allow a view out to the city from the park, and vice-versa. To one side of the gap, there are three seating levels, and on the other, there are two.</li>

Outfield fence has a "jog" similar to the Ameriquest Field, except it's in left-center.</li>
</ul>

Instead of being demolished, the building was integrated into the stadium. In fact, its southeast corner serves as the left field foul pole.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../b/u/s/Busch_Stadium_2185.html" title="Busch Stadium">Busch Stadium</a> (<a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Louis_Cardinals_d4bc.html" title="St. Louis Cardinals">St. Louis Cardinals</a>) - The stadium is very open, allowing a great view of St. Louis, including its iconic <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Louis_Arch_e519.html" title="St. Louis Arch">arch</a>. The old manual scoreboards that showed the scores around the league, were installed up on the walls of the inside concourse, still in the same configuration they were in the day the Cardinals played their last game in the old stadium.</li>
