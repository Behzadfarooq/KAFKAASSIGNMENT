<p>Firstly say that my english is no good, so forgive my fauslts I think some of things in that article, are false First, if you are describing basques as "indigenous people" please don´t say there are 2.6 millions in Basque Country because is false; in Alava, there are not more than 100000 alavese (basque) indigenous; and most of them didn't speak basque since XIV century. Vitoria is similar to Burgos than to Azkoiti.</p>
<p>I think all the article has strongly basque-nationalist view-point an consequently, no neutral, The "Clasification" part seem a legend more than a reality; and the idea of isolate basque country and basques nowadays is totally false, and really ridiculous. --Ioritak 12:31, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hi, I must apologize, my english is very bad. What have to be changed in your opinion? You have problem with "indigenous people", so please, first you should read <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indigenous_people.html" title="Indigenous people">indigenous people</a>. If you think and speak in spanish you can read [RAE: indígena.(Del lat. indigĕna). 1. adj. Originario del país de que se trata] or in the spanish wikipedia [<a href="http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ind%C3%ADgena" class="external autonumber" title="http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ind%C3%ADgena" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>], but this is a english wikipedia. Then, we can read <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethnic.html" title="Ethnic">Ethnic</a> and you'll see that ethnic it isn't people who speak a language. I think that mark this article as POV is a nosense if you only discuss the number of people who are basque, we could do the same with spanish language, spanish people or english or another ethnic group. Where are your references to say that there are only 100000 basques in Alava? Maybe this is POV-article, but why? --anonimo 15 January 2007</p>

<dd>I have deleted the whole section with the politically biased claim that Encartaciones and Alava are "minorities". It was totally POV starting by the assumption that (implicit) Autrigones were of Celtic stock. That's very arguable and, in my opinion unlikely. Toponimy shows that at some point Basque was spoken in Enkarterriak and beyond. Those areas belonged to Pamplona-Navarre in the 10th and 11th centuries (and probably before).</dd>
<dd>The case of Alava (as long as not claimed that they are of different stock) can be argumented by the present (but not historical) linguistic and political situation. Anyhow Unidad Alavesa (always a very small party in Araba) is as dead as Neanderthals.</dd>
<dd>One could maybe argue that Basques that do not speak Basque are an ethnic minority in the Basque Country (a "minority" of 67% of the population in the Autonomous Community) but this is as much as saying that Irish who don't speak Gaelic are a "minority".</dd>
<dd>Whatever the case it was absolutely POV and the article is much better without it. --<a href="../../../s/u/g/User%7ESugaar_6002.html" title="User:Sugaar">Sugaar</a> 20:12, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In fact Galicians and Castilians are the two main immigrant communities in the Autonosmous Community of the Basque Country. Navarrese are not considered immigrants neither by themselves nor by their hosts. Navarre may have more immigration from Aragon and the Northern Basque Country has few immigrants, rather losing population.

<dd>So? A few people can create one of those: it's just a hostery local. The fact is that they are not any large group: immigrants to the Western Basque Country in the 20th century came basically from Castile and Galicia. Most of them are well integrated although, specially Galicians, keep their comunitarian identity and links to their homeland.</dd>
<dd>More recently immigration comes basically from outside Spain (Africa, Asia, some from Eastern Europe too), while some former immigrants are retiring in their home areas (back-migration). --<a href="../../../s/u/g/User%7ESugaar_6002.html" title="User:Sugaar">Sugaar</a> 08:38, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I wonder if this study is uncontested or what? It's known that many Spanish scholars are strongly biased when it comes to Basque questions. I can imagine this author caliming that surnames like Pérez de San Román or Salcedo are not Basque despite being deeply rooted in the Basque Country just because they have an obvious Castilian form. García, the most common Spanish surname has a Basque origin, for instance... I wonder if this author has had all that in account researching the roots of each family or just has taken the telephone gide and discriminated on his own feeling this is Basque and this is not.</p>
<p>I'd like to know the company doing the poll and the area sampled (it's not the same if they just sampled large towns, you know). Or better, I'd like to know if other studies are coincident with these data, that I suspect a little exaggerated, or divergent. Can anyone help?</p>
<p>Also, I'm very at odds with how the section treats the issue of immgrants. While it's clear that at the time of Arana (late 19th century) there was a xenophobic feeling, it's also clear that it has nearly vanished since then and the attitude today and for the last many decades has been of constructive assimmilation. In fact the ethnic divide is really a political one: are you nationalist or unionist, your surname doesn't really matter.</p>

<li>"those opposed to Basque nationalism" (this previously said "oppositors of Basque nationalism"; "oppositors" is not a word, but I assume this is what was meant). Several problems with this: (1) weasel words (2) This suggests that no Basque nationalists think ETA's violence is driving people out of the Basque Country; I would imagine that this opinion is widely held among the PNV, who are certainly Basque nationalists, and among many people who are neither for nor against Basque nationalism.</li>

<dd>While there may be some truth on this, there is basically no way to know. Someone could check the local municipality censa and count the number of people who moved out of the Basque Country. But obviously, there would be no way to deduct the reasons behind. Trying to do this on one's own is nothing but original research. Other thing would be to remove the arbitrary figures and quote instead any verifiable mention of particular individuals who have been forced out of the region due to threats or external pressure.

<dd>Local press has mentioned the issue now and then (can't source, talking from memory, sorry). It's basically a slow paced back-migration of retirees to their original homelands (Galicia, Castile). In a time (70s, early 80s) there was some emmigration of affluent people trying to escape the revolutionary tax, but the rich are always few. There is also economic emmigration (out-migration), specially in Biscay, because unemployement used to be very high (still somewhat high), housing is impossible and things like that. Claims that people has fled for basically political reasons probably refer to very few. --<a href="../../../s/u/g/User%7ESugaar_6002.html" title="User:Sugaar">Sugaar</a> 12:30, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, the Basque Antropologist Julio Caro Baroja doesn't agree with you. He states in his book "Los pueblos de España" that Encartaciones is <i>"la parte no vasca de Vizcaya"</i> (the non-Basque region of Biscay). If you want to describe the geographical distribution of the Basque People you should mention that facts: That not all the "Basque Country Automous Community" has euskara as its traditional language.</dd>
<dd>Encartaciones (at least its Western part) is not definitely a Basque region. Even the name of the country is Castillian: "Encartaciones" means, in Spanish language, <i>"Land which was granted with a Carta Puebla (Population Chart)"</i>. The traditional language of the area is not Basque, but montañés, a transition dialect which has Astur-leonese and Castillian features. It is the Basque Government who tries to <i>euskaldunise</i> the area, imposing the Basque language and culture to the native population. An exemple of that is the deformation of the original Castillian placenames: "Valmaseda" (which has the Spanish prefix "Val-" (valley)) and Cadagua (which derives from the Old Spanish phrase "Ca del agua" -near the water) were transformed in Balmaseda and Kadagua. 80.35.54.46 13:01, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've made some changes in the infobos. Please discuss:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some days ago I changed the pictures of <a href="../../../d/a/g/Daguerre.html" title="Daguerre">Daguerre</a> (French) and <a href="../../../s/o/r/Sor_Juana_de_la_Cruz_9951.html" title="Sor Juana de la Cruz">Sor Juana de la Cruz</a> (Mexican) for <a href="../../../j/u/a/Juan_Sebasti%C3%A1n_Elcano_f6b9.html" title="Juan Sebastián Elcano">J.S. Elkano</a> and Queen Joan III of Navarre.</li>
<li>I've now edited the demographic sections. Placing primarily the figure of 3 million (Basque Country historical territory) and in brackets "est. 7 million worldwide". The actual figure in the Basque Country could be of 2,933,000 (adding up the parts) but I have rounded it up to 3 million.</li>
<li>I've also edited the religious section: changed "predominantly Roman Catholic" by "traditionally Roman Catholic" and adding that "Atheism and Agnosticism are widespred nowadays". It's clear to me that religious practice and faith have sunk in the last decades but, please, confirm with statistic data, probably via Euskobarometro (I found above <a href="http://www.religionstatistics.net/noreleng.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.religionstatistics.net/noreleng.htm" rel="nofollow">this link</a> on all-Spain religiosity, that mentions statistics with only 22-27% of Catholics and 20-27% of atheist-agnostics, the situation is definitively not better for the Church in the Basque Country, that's clear). Notice that Basque Roma are now basically Evangelist but as they are a minority, I haven't mentioned it. Other minorities may be basically Muslim (recent immigrant wave).</li>
<li>In the related groups section I've placed Gascons primarily, as they are the only homogeneous ethnic group that actually shares history and even linguistic background (apart of genetics) with Basques. While some Northern Spaniards may be related to Basques I consider unrealistic to say that all Spaniards are, at least more than any other Western European group. Therefore I've added Western Europeans (getically, culturally and historically akin) and Latin Americans (that have some relevant share of Basque blood and surnames) in the other groups sub-area.</li>
</ul>

<p>The fact is, Basques share a common heritage with the people of Old Castile (Castilla la Vieja). The Basque language was spoken in the 10-12th centuries in round 50% of the territory of the Logroño, Burgos and Soria. In this sense, not only there are many Basque toponims in Old Castile: Moreover, the Basque tongue was known by many medieval Castillians. Two examples: In the <i>Cantar del Mio Cid</i> poem, <a href="../../../e/l/_/El_Cid_0a8a.html" title="El Cid">el Cid</a> calls her nephew <i>mio anaya</i>, a Castillian-Basque form which means <i>my brother</i>. In <i>Los milagros de nuestra Señora</i>, the writer <a href="../../../g/o/n/Gonzalo_de_Berceo_8ef4.html" title="Gonzalo de Berceo">Gonzalo de Berceo</a> gives one of the characters the name <i>Don Bildur</i>, which means, literally "Mr Fear". It is really really interesting to see how the early Castillian writers mixed in the Romance words of the Old Language that were understood by the audience.</p>
<p>On the other hand, many of the Castillian antroponimy has Basque origins, as this tables shows:</p>
<center>
<table class="wikitable">

</table>
</center>
<p>And, of course, the fact that most of people living in the Basque Country have Castillian names shows that their patrilineal ancestors came from <a href="../../../c/a/s/Castile.html" title="Castile">Castile</a>. <a href="http://www.gipuzkoakultura.net/ediciones/atzo/c152f24/" class="external free" title="http://www.gipuzkoakultura.net/ediciones/atzo/c152f24/" rel="nofollow">http://www.gipuzkoakultura.net/ediciones/atzo/c152f24/</a> In this document, dated in 1813, nearly all their signers have Basque names. Thus, we may deduce that most of the Castillian surnames that wear today the Basque Country citizens were brought by immigrants in the 19th and 20th centuries. Moreover, 40% of the Basque people have at least one parent born in other parts of Spain.</p>

<dd>I agree with much of what you say. But that's notjustification to place all Spaniards as related. Some Castilians (those living NE of the Burgos-Santander line, including Bureba, La Losa, 1/3 of Cantabria, Miranda and La Rioja), in the territory that once was Navarre), some Aragonese (High Aragonese) are clearly related, I'd even say that as related as Gascons. But you cannot even extend that for all Castile or all Aragon.</dd>
<dd>Much less for all Spain. What do Andalusians or Valencians have in common with Basques? Not much more than Danish or Belgians.</dd>
<dd>And you are the one denying that Enkarterri and Araba are even slightly Basque? That's capricious double standards!</dd>
<dd>Regarding apparent Castilian surnames that are clearly rooted in the Basque country, I reject that all are of recent immigration, though they could belong to older smaller population movements in some cases. Many composed surnames Pérez de San Román, as Castilian as it may sound, are Araban surnames of deep roots. Araba has been bilingual for long and closer to Castile than any other Basque province. Other are less clear: my great-great-granfather's surname was Salcedo (that also looks Castilian or maybe even Galician) but he was sufficiently rooted in the country in the early 20th century as to become the major of Portugalete (in the 19th century there was very few immigration, except maybe for the last decade or so).</dd>
<dd>If with that part of your discourse, you're trying to justify Aranda's one-sided conclussions, I must say that I'm not convinced at all. Western Basque Country has been under Castilian rule for centuries, if those are immigrant surnames, they may have come earlier, if they are not, the linguistic influence of Castile is to blame.</dd>
<dd>In any case, we are a very welcoming country: we consider Basques those that live and produce in the Basque Country and/or those that can speak Basque. Many Basques have foreign roots (not just Spanish and Galician but German or other) but most feel Basque like anyone else. --<a href="../../../s/u/g/User%7ESugaar_6002.html" title="User:Sugaar">Sugaar</a> 01:17, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's complex: the "Basque region" (autonomous community) was doubly constituted in the 30s and 80s.</dd>
<dd>In the 30s the Navarrese delegates had majority mandate of voting in favor but many were pressured to abstain, gaining the "no". (source: Mikel Sorauren, can check more if needed).</dd>
<dd>In the 80s all fundamental laws (Spanish constitution, Basque statute) provide for Navarre to join the Basque community at will. Despite promises and requests, the referendum on such possible union has never taken place. Some say that the will of Navarrese is represented by the Cortes (parliament) and others say that still the people must be asked, suggesting that a yes vote is likely (though I have no idea if that's true at this stage).</dd>
<dd>So the people of Navarre has never directly expressed itself in either sense directly. In 1932, the mandate was "yes" but the outcome was "no". Modernly the referendum has yet to be done, both on joining the BAC (in the federative manner that this community has) and on the very "amejoramiento del fuero" (Navarrese special statute). --<a href="../../../s/u/g/User%7ESugaar_6002.html" title="User:Sugaar">Sugaar</a> 00:13, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Yes at it's written it is confuse: the Western Basques do want/favor Navarre re-united with them and this has been contemplated as a possibility both in the 1930s and in the 1970s. But Navarrese never had the real opportunity of directly deciding themselves. When they did in 1932, their choice was apparently manipulated, since then they have never voted any proposal in this sense, despite the promises (always forgotten), specially by the PSN-PSOE.</dd>

<dl>
<dd><i>Meanwhile in (residual) Nabarra, an alliance of the Left (PSOE, Spanish Socialist Party) and the Right (UCD, Union of the Democratic Center and UPN, Union of the Nabarrase People) negotiated an autonomy statute with the central government. Three members of parliament, including Herri Batasuna's, member parliament, were banned from the negotiating Commission. In 1982 the law of Amejoramiento del Fuero Nabarro (approved by the Nabarrese parliaments and not by referendum) provided Nabarra with its own autonomy statute thus further dividing Nabarra from its truncated territories of Araba, Bizkaia and Gipuzkoa. Article 145 of the Spanish Constitution states that: "[u]nder no circumstances shall the federation of Autonomous Communities be allowed."</i></dd>
<dd><i>In this way, the institutional division of Nabarra's territories in Spain was finally consolidated.</i></dd>

<blockquote>
<p>«El País Vasco integrado por las actuales provincias de Alava, Guipúzcoa, Navarra y Vizcaya constituye una entidad natural y jurídica con personalidad política propia y se le reconoce como tal el derecho a constituirse y regirse por sí mismo como Estado Autónomo dentro de la totalidad del Estado español», rezaba el primer Estatuto de la Sociedad de Estudios Vascos, aprobado por la aclamación de 427 municipios en la fiesta de Lizarra del 14 de junio de 1931. Los socialistas y republicanos que presidían la nueva Gestora de Diputación propusieron otro proyecto similar de estatuto, en el que participaron desde la izquierda a los monárquicos navarros. Fue votado en cada ayuntamiento y luego conjuntamente el 10 de agosto del mismo año. Conviene repasar las cifras: de 220 ayuntamientos navarros presentados, 200 apoyaron el Estatuto Vasconavarro; hubo tres municipios en favor del Estatuto navarro, y 15 por ningún estatuto. Lo decía hasta Rafael Aizpún: Navarra era euskaldun. Tras nueva Constitución Española, que obligó a modificar el texto, en la asamblea en enero de 1932 el 64,46% de los delegados navarros se mostró de nuevo a favor, aunque aumentaron las deserciones, no por el Estatuto Vasco en sí, sino por sus contenidos más o menos laicos o religiosos, que lo dejaron al pairo de los huracanes que sacudían la República. Al final, el tema religioso y el enfrentamiento con las directrices republicanas hicieron que, después de tres asambleas con el voto abrumadoramente favorable, Navarra quedara fuera del Estatuto por una mínima diferencia. Y trampeada, según demostró Jimeno Jurío en su libro “Navarra jamás dijo no al Estatuto Vasco”. Quedan para la historia las palabras iniciales de Constantino Salinas, el líder histórico del socialismo navarro, que muestran lo lejos que estaba de imaginar el resultado de la asamblea: «Quiero ante todo dar la bienvenida en nombre de Navarra, saludaros en nombre de esta provincia que, como dice el artículo uno del proyecto de Estatuto que va a someterse a vuestra discusión, tiene con Alava, Guipúzcoa y Vizcaya estrecho parentesco de orden étnico, cultural, político y económicoŠ los lazos que, a juzgar por estas incontenibles aspiraciones del País Vasco al promulgar conjuntamente por la autonomía, serán tan fuertes, que es de presumir que a lo largo de la historia venidera de las cuatro provincias no habrá vicisitudes que puedan quebrantarlas».</p>

<p>Among other surely good edits, LSLM recently added this paragraph in the Culture section:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It should be noted though, that the majority of Basques have <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spanish.html" title="Spanish">Spanish</a> as their native tongue and not Basque, and are Roman Catholics, basic common features that they share with the rest of Spaniards. In fact the Spanish language developed in the north of Spain in close contact with Basque speakers, which is reflected in diverse features like the five Spanish vowels, which are of Basque origins. The oldest Spanish texts to be conserved are in the same documents that also contain the oldest Basque texts recorded, in the so-called Emilianenses and Silenses glosses. Besides, the Spanish Basque country has always been part of Spain, one of the oldest states in Europe, and even before that, it was part of the county of Castile first, and of the Kingdom of Castile, later.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I find it very confuse and rather POV:</p>
<ul>
<li>Language: it doesn't make any mention to colonization and cultural genocide. It focuses in southern Basque Country, ignoring the North (where Spanish is irrelevant).</li>
<li>Religion: Catholicism is part of historical tradition (though there was a Calvinist epysode in the North too) but nowadays most Basques are not practicant Catholics anymore. Religion suffered a lot with Franco's fundamentalism and also later with post-modernity.</li>
<li>Oldest Basque texts: that info is obsolete it seems. Check <a href="../../../i/r/u/Iru%C3%B1a-Veleia_7f35.html" title="Iruña-Veleia">Iruña-Veleia</a> the oldest Basque texts seem to be a lot older, from at least the 3rd century CE.</li>
<li>The claim that "the Spanish Basque Country has always been part of Spain" is 100% POV and again ignore the North. I must remind LSLM that the County of Castile was an annex of the Basque Country (<a href="../../../k/i/n/Kingdom_of_Navarre_4da2.html" title="Kingdom of Navarre">Kingdom of Pamplona</a>) long before it was otherwise. That the Basque territories were annexed by force in 1199-1200 and 1512-22, not witout resistence. Also the resulting provinces were virtually independent for all civil and economic matters until 1833 (in the South) and the French Revolution (in the North). --<a href="../../../s/u/g/User%7ESugaar_6002.html" title="User:Sugaar">Sugaar</a> 03:26, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I agree with you Sugaar, this is mostly irrelevancy. Insofar as they have Spanish as their native tongue, that is of some relevance but Catholicism? You have to go as far as Switzerland before you hit the next area that is not predominantly Catholic (other than a handful of cities in northwestern France). The vowels thing is true, to the best of my knowledge, but so what? By this sort of standard one could say that New York Puerto Ricans are some weird mixture of Irish, Italian, and Jewish by the form of English they speak. As for "always been part of Spain", I agree with how you've characterized it; until about 500 years ago (and arguably rather more recently) there was no nation state of "Spain" to be part of, and the <i>fueros</i> meant that in the case of the Basques that "arguably rather more recently" is particularly relevant. There may be a fact or two here that belongs, but putting them together like this amounts to the sort of synthesized polemic by juxtapostion that is specifically ruled out be <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>. It would be fine for the article to cite and discuss some ethnographer who has made the case that the Basques are more Spanish than not; it is not fine for a contributor to just string together a dubious argument to this effect. - <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 07:02, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have removed again "Old Castilians" and "Northern Aragonese". They are not any separate/homogeneous ethnic group as Gascons and it's more a matter of borders. While "Northern Aragonese" could be valid, depending where you place the border (Jaca and Ejea yes, Huesca very dubious, Zaragoza no way), Old Castilians are mostly not related to Basques significatively. Only the NE area (east of the Burgos-Santander line) that once belonged to Pamplona has a clear Basque background, but the people from Avila, Palencia, Aranda or Soria mostly don't. --<a href="../../../s/u/g/User%7ESugaar_6002.html" title="User:Sugaar">Sugaar</a> 03:34, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I strongly question who cares about U8 haplogroup? I mean: the most important western European haplogroup is H and Basques have plenty of it as far as I know. U is diverse but mostly a Mediterranean haplogroup.</li>
<li>Also the other study is mono-focused in V haplogroup ("sister" of H), typical of the Saami (Lapp), for instance. The study finds contradictory that Guipuscoans have high level of V (c. 11%) and Iron Age remains have 0%. Yet the arhceological remains studied are all from out of Guipuscoa (Ebro Valley and Biscay) and for instance Biscayans have only 3% of that haplogroup - and ironically that is clearly stated in that same study.</li>

<p>The most obvious related ethnic groups are Spaniards and French. Or maybe not, in fact most Basques are Spaniards themselves, like me, about 2.750.000 of them.

<p><i>The Basques are clearly a distinct ethnic group in their native region. They are culturally and especially linguistically distinct from their surrounding neighbors, etc</i></p>
<p>Facts: The vast majority of Basques have Spanish as their mother tongue (in France French). Only a minority of them have Basque as their mother tongue and they all speak Spanish in Spain. To say that they are not a Romance speaking people is typical of the kind of extremists whose role is to try and exaggerate what suits their agendas and ignore the facts, even if those lies are gross. Spanish is the natural language of the majority of the people of the Basque country. I am Basque myself and like the majority of my people, do not speak Basque, even if I would like to. Basque is a minority language that now is being promoted by the Regional Government. It is more than fair than Basque is promoted. It is one of the languages of the Basque country and it is certainly the oldest, but not the only one and certainly not the most spoken language. It is because of this and other clearly biased statements that I am posting that the neutrality of this article is very much in question. <a href="../../../l/s/l/User%7ELSLM_2f47.html" title="User:LSLM">Veritas et Severitas</a> 23:44, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

Basques have since long been considered quite unique, mainly because of the isolate pre-IE language but also for other reasons such as some rather unique customs (sometimes shared with other Atlantic peoples: regattas, stonelifting, sometimes totally unique: Basque yoke for instance).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Being aculturized and forced to speak another language doesn't make Basques necesarily more akin to the genocidal nations (Spain and France), in my opinion. Saying that Basques are mostly related to Spaniards as you sustain, LSLM, is like saying that Kurds are mostly related to Turks, Chechens to Russians or Navajos to White Texans. It's totally misleading and politically motivated. Surely Chechens can speak Russian, most Kurds do speak Turkish and Navajos necessarily must know English... but they are not the same thing as their cultural and political invaders.</dd>

<p>Well Sugaar, I think your extremist position is clear. You call the Spanish and the French genocidal nations! Most Spaniards and Basques are believed to come from the earliest inhabitants of Spain, whatever you say!. The Basques have certainly maintained more ancestral links and have been more isolated, but they have been aculturized and forced to speak another laguage the same as the rest of the Iberians when they were Romanized. But as usual, I will let you concentrate on the 20% that they may be different and ignore the 80% that they have in common (and that without taking into account that probably 50% of the people in the present-day Spanish Basque country come from other areas of Spain, due to 19th and 20th century immigration). That is typical of the extreme nationalists that I mentioned before. You call the Spanish and the French genocidal, but the hard fact is that it is people who do not think like you who have been getting a bullet in the back of their heads by extreme nationalists, many of them with fathers, mothers or grandparents who are not even from the Basque country. I am one of those Spanish Basques(for me being Basque and Spaniard are one and the same thing) who can express their opinions freely in a place like this, but not in the streets of the Spanish Basque country, which have been taken over by a fascist minority that will not tolerate that others do not think like them. We have to speak at home, the same as during the fascist Franco dictatorship. The tragedy of the Basque country is that while the rest of Spain has freed itself from Fascim, we continue to be suffering from it. The Fascists changed names, that is all. And in the best fascist tradition they like to manipulate reality, exaggerate what suits them, downplay, ignore or just deny what does not suit them. But of course, it is people like me who have a political agenda.</p>

<p>And that is just biological ancestry. Maybe we shall not say here that since Spain exists, the Basque country has been a part of it, or repeat that mosts Basques and Spaniards have inherited from the genocidal Romans the same basic cultural elements, like their Romance language and their religion.

<dd>Don't misunderstand me: <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genocide.html" title="Genocide">genocide</a> by the UN criteria can well be cultural genocide, and it's clear that this the Basque people has suffered and is still suffering out of the BAC (i.e. in Navarre and the North).</dd>
<dd>On genetics, notice that Hg12 is also part of R1b (along with most but not all Hg1). Now, look again at the same map<a href="http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com/~gallgaedhil/Haplogroups_In_Europe.jpg" class="external autonumber" title="http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com/~gallgaedhil/Haplogroups_In_Europe.jpg" rel="nofollow">[10]</a> and you'll notice that Basques still have some 25% more R1b than the average Spaniard. Aditionally it's worth mentioning (something I know you already know) that the cake posted in Eastern England is only about Norfolk people, who, as well as those of Yorkshire, are the most Nordic influenced of all Britons. If Spaniards show a good 60% R1b, English show rather 70% and Celtic peoples of the Atlantic are more in the line of 80-100%<a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6VRT-48PV5SH-12&amp;_coverDate=05%2F27%2F2003&amp;_alid=339895807&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_qd=1&amp;_cdi=6243&amp;_sort=d&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000049116&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=949111&amp;md5=9edf5ce1c39d4139af4c01733282fa82" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6VRT-48PV5SH-12&amp;_coverDate=05%2F27%2F2003&amp;_alid=339895807&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_qd=1&amp;_cdi=6243&amp;_sort=d&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000049116&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=949111&amp;md5=9edf5ce1c39d4139af4c01733282fa82" rel="nofollow">[11]</a>.</dd>
<dd>Other maps you posted just confirm what I say: that (re. Y-chromosmome haplogroups) Basques are closer to Western/Atlantic Europeans. And Spaniards are in that group, indeed, but not markedly closer to Basques or whatever.</dd>
<dd>You emphasize one study that says that Spaniards are 73-74% "Basque". Ignoring that the same study says that Portuguese are 64-71%, Britons 69-70% and Northern Italians 62-68%. What makes you emphasize Spaniards because of just 4 percentual points?</dd>
<dd>The other article does argue that British MtDNA is indeed closer to NW Europe. I agree, and I used it as argument against your Iberist viewpoints in the discussion in the <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_people.html" title="English people">English people</a> article if you remember. I said that the differences of MtDNA are not as larger as those of Y-DNA and that this study shows (in my opinion) that Western Europeans were more homogenous in the Y-DNA side before IE migrations and that Britain was at least partly colonized from the Rhin area (and not exclusively from "Iberia" as yo claimed).</dd>
<dd>It is probably true that there were two related but somewhat separated populations in Europe before Neolithic and IE migrations: one centered in the Franco-Cantabrian region (i.e. primeval Basque Country) and the other centered at the Rhin and the Upper Danub. While Northern Iberians and Occitans would be better candidates to be closest to Basques in the genetic aspect just because of neighbourhood, the fact is that in some aspects (i.e. Y-DNA and some autosomal PCs<a href="http://www.sitesled.com/members/racialreality/genetic_variation.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.sitesled.com/members/racialreality/genetic_variation.html" rel="nofollow">[12]</a>) Basques are closer to other Atlantic Europeans than Iberians. Why? Surely because, due to insularity, Britain was somewhat less affected by continental immigration and like Basques (but to a lesser extent) kept pretty well their ancient European aboriginal stock.</dd>
<dd>So the conclusion can only be that genetically (at least via Y-DNA) Basques belong to the same stock as Western Europeans in general. No reason to mention Spaniards specially as, at least in this aspect, they show no greater affinity with Basques than Britons and specially other isolated peoples like Gascons, Irish, Bretons or Welsh.</dd>

<p>I am not going to comment on some details of yours because people can read and see for themselves very well the links that I have provided. I think that you know that there is a hierarchy in genetic markers: The Y-Chromosome is the most reliable, then Mitocondrial DNA. Autosomal is the least reliable of the three. Still the more places you check the better. I have provided one study that includes the three of them plus up to 5 more genetic loci and is very recent, from 2004. In that respect it is the most reliable. According to that study Spain shows the highest concentration of Basque genetic markers, more than Britain. Still I think that it is not that important to argue about a few points, in any case it is clearly the majority population group in Spain. So, I did not say that genetically speaking other Western European peoples are not closely related. I said and continue to say that most Spaniards and most Basques belong basically to the same population stock and that most of them come from the earliest inhabitants of Spain. Besides I have said that Basques and the rest of Spaniards share a very long common history, a common language, a common religion etc. It does not mean that Basques do not have their own particular features and traditions, like many other areas in Spain. I am particularly proud of the Basque language, although I do not speak it, as a Basque and as a Spaniard. But all Spaniards have more things in common than things that separate them, including Basques. The problem lies, probably, in the fact that some people think that peoples have to be absolutely monolithic. That is a provincial, Romantic and dangerous concept. In any case I respect those who think differently but do not play along a version of the Basques as being clearly separated from the rest of the Spanish, in the same way as the Welsh are not clearly separated from the rest of the English. That idea has to do more with myth and politics than with reality. By the way, I insist on Spain because the Basque country is basically an area in Spain. I know that a lot of people like to emphasise that it is also in France. It is true that there are also French Basques, about 250.000. But about 2.750.000 live in the Spanish Basque country, in other words, more than 90 per cent of Basques live in the Spanish Basque Country and Navarre, so we are speaking basically of an area in Spain. I am not mentioning Spain arbitrarily. <a href="../../../l/s/l/User%7ELSLM_2f47.html" title="User:LSLM">Veritas et Severitas</a> 04:22, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm not going to discuss genetics more either. It's relatively irrelevant in any case: what defines an ethnic group is culture, often language and specially identification as such.</dd>
<dd>But I am going to question your reasoning that because a majority of Basques live in lands annexed by Spain (arguably against our will) that makes us "ethnically Spaniards" (whatever that means). I strongly disagree that "all Spaniards have more things in common than thing that separates them" and I'd say that's particularly clear in the Basque case if anyone: Spain is an amalgamation of peoples and the only thing that it has in common is an imposed Castilian culture, language and law. As you know well, the Basque people is not the only nation that wants to break apart nor the only country that Castile (aka Spain) has doblegated by force of arms and assimilated by means of cultural genocide. Spain has a constituent essential problem but that's politics anyhow.</dd>
<dd>Let's discuss culture and ethnic markers. And really: Basques have many things that are just plainly unique, specially the already mentioned language but not only: law, democratic tradition, music (most Basques strongly dislike Flamenco, naturally), traditional sports, original mythology, lack of militaristic/imperialistic drive, cuisine, mentality... all that (and many other things I forgot) is sufficiently different to make us a differentiated ethnicity (or nation).</dd>
<dd>Are Spaniards (Castilians) related to Basques? Surely in some levels. Are Basques related to Spaniards? Not really: not so much and only for recent colonization aculturation really. If Spain would not exist that would not affect the existence of the Basque people/country. The opposite I really don't know - but anyhow it's not my problem.</dd>
<dd>Your rationale is basically political, as I said: the same that makes Navajos "Texans", Sorbians "Germans" and Uygurs "Chinese". It's not a valid argumentation.</dd>
<dd>You can't just say: Tibetans are primarily related to Chinese because most of them live in RPC. That's not an ethnological argumentation - only a political one. --<a href="../../../s/u/g/User%7ESugaar_6002.html" title="User:Sugaar">Sugaar</a> 05:28, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Translation: <i>The Gaulish revolts against Romans and aristocracy were already important in the 3rd century. They continue with Claudius II and in the reign of Ciocletian, but it is now, near 435, when the Bagaudae proper caused an uprising, taking the way of the Alps and reaching the Pyrenees. Basques fight now for their freedom, slaughtering a corps of Romans near Calahorra. Differences arise between Visigoths and Romans that would culminate in the siege of Tolosa, seat of Recaredo, in 439. The definitive independence of the Gothic Kingdom of Tolosa is near. The Gaulish Bagaudae defeated and persecuted had already entered the Peninsula , probably by the coast and by Roncevaux along the Roman road Astorga-Bourdeaux. In the year "y" [typo] they fight general Asturio; in the year 433 count Merobaundes [a clear Visigothic name] fight them near Huarte-Arakil (Aracaeli). In 449 Roman general Basil fight the Bagaudae, allied of Rechiarius, near Turiasu [Tarazona], in the Basque-Celtic border. All the people refuged in the church, among them Leon, its bishop, die.

<p>My friend Sugaar, with whom I agree on many other issues, is accusing me of POV pushing while he is not only pushing an extreme point of view very well know by some sectors of Basque society, but a fundamentalist point of view:</p>
<p>1. I find it even ridiculous to discuss the fact that the Basque country is a Spanish region including 90 per cent of Basques.</p>
<p>2. It has always been part of Spain since Spain exists, about half a millenium.</p>
<p>3. An important percentage of people come from other parts of Spain, and that is close to 50%.</p>
<p>4. If it comes down to feelings, we have the following situation.</p>
<p>5. While there are people who support Basque independence there are people who do not.</p>
<p>a) In the Spanish Basque territory there are people who feel only Basque and people who feel both Basque and Spanish. In the French area the same situation, but the Frech feeling is much greater.</p>
<p>b) In Navarre the Spanish feeling is even stronger.</p>
<p>Conclusion: The extremist position that I am pointing out, is not only the one of an independentist who says that Basques are not Spanish, <b>but that they are not even related!. I know that fundamentalism knows no boundaries and responds to no reason. But fundamentalism should not be allowed in this place.</b></p>
<p>In the best tradition of the most radical Basques he wants to impose his fundamentalist point of view on all Basques in this place, in the same way as these extremists do in the streets of the Spanish Basque country. I am a Basque, and like me, about 50% of Basques in the Spanish Basque country feel both Basque and Spanish, like the vast majority of Navarrese. Do not insult me and millions of Basques by saying not only that we are not Spanish, but that I we are not even related to the Spanish. <a href="../../../l/s/l/User%7ELSLM_2f47.html" title="User:LSLM">Veritas et Severitas</a> 13:27, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>In our case, I feel it's very clear that the only homogeneous group that shows a clear relation with Basques are Gascons.

<p>I cannot silence fundamentalist positions and the attempts to exaggerate differences while at the same time try to downplay, ignore and deny the basic similarities. I have already expressed my points in the comments above and in the links that I provided. The genetic connections among all Spaniards are clear, but if you knew better you would know that language, culture, shared history, etc. are even more important than genetics for ethnicity. I have said that Basques are a group with their own peculiar and important unique characteristics, but from there to jump to the conclusion that Basques and Spaniards are not even related surpasses all boundaries of common sense and can only have a strong political motivation.</p>
<p>You are defending an extremist position that is very well known in Spain. In fact we have two similar positions:</p>
<p>1. The one of the Spanish Fascists that say that Spaniards are a monolithic group. They are all Spanish an that is it..</p>
<p>2. The ones of extreme regional nationalist who do the same. Example: Basques are all a monolithic group. They are Basques and that is it.</p>
<p>If we call the former Fascists I see no reason why we should not call the latter the same way. <a href="../../../l/s/l/User%7ELSLM_2f47.html" title="User:LSLM">Veritas et Severitas</a> 14:14, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>My position, sorry, it's merely ethnological. You have been unable in many paragraphs to bring forward a single argument in favor of a special ethnical vincle between Basque and Spaniards other than the political one.</dd>
<dd>And then you dare to accuse me of politizing the issue, falling in what I can't but start to consider <i>ad hominem</i> attacks, for lack of arguments.</dd>
<dd>Please reconsider your attitude. You can't impose a POV just because you think so and bring out of your sleeve arbitrary political rationales and equally arbitrary disqualifications.</dd>
<dd>Sorry, but the only one that is disqualified with that for of faulty reasoning (and continued imposition of a non-fundamented POV) is yourself.</dd>

<li>Linguistic: Basque language is unrelated to Romance and, in general, IE languages. Gascons and possibly Riojans are only somewhat homogeneous ethnic groups that can be considered as Romance-speaking Basques.</li>
<li>Genetic (look for sources above): while some aspects of genetic research may appear to give greater closeness between Basques and Iberians, most of it rather points to give more closeness to other Atlantic peoples like Celtic-speakers. In general all these groups (Basques, Gascons, modern Celtic peoples) are less diluted remnants of what once was the standard of Western/Atlantic Europe.</li>
<li>Other ethnic groups' infboxes follow all an ethnological and not political rationale, i.e. Uyghurs are not claimed as related to Chinese, Kurds are not claimed as related to Turks, etc. --<a href="../../../s/u/g/User%7ESugaar_6002.html" title="User:Sugaar">Sugaar</a> 14:50, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>1. Most Iberians (Most Basques and most other Spaniards and Portuguese) and Britons and other Europeans seem to have all a prehistoric common ancestry, but Iberians and Britons are not related ethnic groups. They have been isolated from each other for thousands of years.</p>
<p>2. Spaniards have all a common history. A common language (Basques are more a Romance people than anything else. The vast majority of us have Spanish as our native language, although we are also proud of our Basque language, spoken by about 25% of us, although very few have it as their first native language). A common religion and a common feeling of identity as Basque and Spaniards, that is shared at least by 50% of the population in the Spanish Basque country and by the the overwhelming majority in the Basque Spanish region of Navarre.</p>
<p>By the way, in the capital of the Basque Spanish region of Navarre, Pamplona, the most celebrated bullfighting festivals are held, as everyone knows: the Sanfermines. Although I am myself against bullfighting, one cannot negate that it is a very traditional festival deeply related to Spanish culture.</p>
<p>3. Spaniards are not a monolithic group. They are diverse, like the Basques themselves.</p>
<p>4. Even if we ignore the ancestral relationships among Basques and the rest of Spaniards, close to 50% of them come from Castilians, Calicians, Andalusians, etc who immigrated into the Basque country during the 19th and 2oth centuries for economic reasons.</p>
<p>5. Basques (well more thatn 90% of them) are Spanish citizens and have always been since Spanish citizens exist. By the way, before that they were part of the Castilian county, first, and of the Castilian Kingdom, later.</p>
<p>6. This is not about negating Basque identity. If someone tried to negate Basque identity I would be even more tough. This is about a simple concept: "related". Since I think that we all understand English, it can be clearly understood. <a href="../../../l/s/l/User%7ELSLM_2f47.html" title="User:LSLM">Veritas et Severitas</a> 15:09, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Yes, I would like to comment on this. First of all, Sugaar's statements about the Basque people's relationships are correct. Of course that is my opinion (and Sugaar's), and also that of a great many other people, but there will also naturally be individuals who entertain different opinions, and if that were really the issue we could probably just have a quite civilised discussion and sort the business out. But obviously that is not really the issue, and it is not the reason why Sugaar has had to ask for help here. What is really the issue is that Sugaar is being attacked by somebody representing an extremist position in the Spanish nationalist camp. As an outsider with a lot of inside knowledge about this situation and therefore some credentials for playing an "ambassadorial" role, I feel it is my duty to clarify for the benefit of observers less acquainted with this affair that for generations, right-wing Spaniards have invariably been obsessed with the need they perceive to deny the facts about ethnic diversity that are intrinsic to the makeup of the present-day political entity called Spain. That is what is being played out here (once again). It is quite unjust for Sugaar to be accused of pushing a "point of view" here. I repeat: what he is saying is objectively the case. Whoever insists on denying the obvious is the only one pushing a point of view in this instance. Doing so by accusing others of POV-pushing is intolerable, and Sugaar is quite right to complain and request assistance.

<dd>Although the issue is complex because of the concept of ethnicity and relatedness between peoples is impossible to define in a sensible way I will support the first viewpoint - mostly from a linguistic point of view. My opinion is that if we have to say which peoples are related then we have to do it on a basis that makes sense and that doesn't dilute the concepts of ethnicity and relatedness into something uninformative. Language is often the best way to define ethnicity and in the basque case it seems to be the only unequivocal way. Think about it this way american indians have lived together with europeans for 500 years - does that make them ethnically related to europeans? Mixing of ethnicities, linguistic borrowing etc has taken place in all cases but native american ethnicity remains intact and distinct from the european ethnicity. In my opinion the same is the case for Basque although basque and romance have coexisted for a longer time. Saying that basque and spanish people are relaed is simply not informative - while it is the case on at least two levels (intermixing and prolonged coexistence) it does not tell us anything useful about the roots of the basque ethnia. I say that the infobox should say "gascons, riojans and, in general, Western Europeans." Or a pehaps even better alternative solution: leave out the related peoples field in the infobox altogether.<a href="../../../m/a/u/User%7EMaunus_7503.html" title="User:Maunus">Maunus</a> 08:55, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I would agree that this underlines the fact that ethnicity is a mushy category. While there are people whose ethnicity is clear (many generations of people from within a group, speaking the same language, practicing the same relition, etc.) there are many whose ethnicity it is not (someone living in Bilbao whose family is mostly Galician, but who speaks good Basque and has one indisputably Basque ancestor, for example). - <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 19:47, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Some comments:
<ul>
<li>Why Castilians specially? Aragonese have at least as much influence from Basque. Catalans are closer genetically and Galicians share some usages +/- common to the the northern strip and sometimes beyond to the British islands (the "pseudo-Celtic" connection that is actually pre-Celtic). Extremadurans, Andalusians, Murcians and Canarians are Castilians in the historical sense, yet they are not very much related to Basques, almost the same for Leonese and all Castilians <i>strictu sensu</i> south of Burgos). What does Ávila or Segovia (Old castile) have to do with the Basque Country/people? Not more than Venezuela or California.</li>
<li>Creole peoples. The same as above: while some of them may have a noticeable Basque apportation basically this is diluted enough and can't be clearly differentiated from other European inputs. It's much better dealt with in the Basque diaspora article that needs a lot of attention and expansion.</li>
<li>Agirre is basically a Biscayan surname (though also found in the north in the form of Daguerre or even Guerre). Basque surnames are generally very localized in origin: one <i>baserri</i> or village maybe. Anyhow, Madrid has 6 million inhabitants, all the Basque country only 3 million or so. Additionally Madrid as "imperial capital" since some 4 or 5 centuries ago has attracted many immigrants and can't be considered representative of Castile. It's like defending the Indian-ness or Irish-ness of England because there are so many people of these origins in some of its major cities... Not serious, really.</li>
<li>García (and other Castilian surnames of Basque origin, like Velasco, Vélez, Velázquez and Vela, all derived from <i>Bele/a</i>, attested since the Aquitainian slabs) are very interesting. García is the most common Spanish surnmae (like Chang or Smith in other languages) but having that surname is not guarantee of Basque-ness, considering the medieval cultural interactions that gave these first names and corresponding patronimics their disffusion. Surely when dealing with the identity of Castilian people you can't help talking of Basque influences but the opposite is not so clear. In other words: the Castile (or Aragon for the case) we know would not have existed without Basques but Basques did indeed exist long before the very idea of Castile existed at all. To each one what is his/her own. --<a href="../../../s/u/g/User%7ESugaar_6002.html" title="User:Sugaar">Sugaar</a> 04:47, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I saw the ETB report mentioned above on the TV news, including the assertion that <i>En Madrid hay más Aguirres que los que encontramos en Gipuzkoa, Álava y Navarra.</i> I'm not sure what the (political?) agenda behind the report was, or if it was just the usual journalistic sloppiness at work, but it struck me at the time as a very muddled and confusing report. To start with, the statement we are quoting doesn't tell me anything significant, except to remind me that there are a lot of people in Madrid. If there are more Jews (and also more people) in New York than in the state of Israel, does that mean that New York is "more Jewish" than Israel? Does it tell me anything at all about Israel? If there are more Basque speakers in Bilbao than in Ondarroa, can I draw any conclusion from that fact about the presence of the Basque language in Ondarroa? I don't think so. So what does this fact (about Aguirres in Madrid) tell us? Does the journalist who wrote the report even know? I certainly don't.</p>
<p>As for Error's phrase 'I take that as a sign that a relevant part of Spaniards have some Basque ancestry', I'm sorry but I have to ask in this context: 'Who are the Spaniards?'</p>
<p>If we're going to start counting Aguirre's in Spain then we must also count the Basque surnames in Latin America, where they are all over the place. For all I know there might be more there than in Spain. Meaning what?</p>
<p>By the way, for those who do want to play this game, counting Basque surnames no doubt gives too conservative a figure for "Basque presence" (or whatever we're supposed to be measuring here, I think I've forgotten), because not all Basques have always had Basque surnames (the ETB told us that) and because, futhermore, people with Basque-origin surnames living in Spain have at times been forced to register a hispanicised version of their names. I am told that a lot of people in northern Castile with the surname Palacios were originally Jauregis whose real names were censored by local government officials.</p>
<p>Anyway, to get back to the point: are New Yorkers listed as an ethnic group closely related to the Jewish people? And if they are not, then I ask (with Sugaar): why Spaniards? --<a href="../../../a/_/r/User%7EA_R_King_3ae3.html" title="User:A R King">A R King</a> 09:26, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>It is suggested in the article that the French term <i>basque</i> (from which the English <i>Basque</i> has been borrowed) comes from a Gascon word <i>basco</i>. Although I don't know very much Gascon, what I do know leads me to question the historicity of this. While in modern Gascon a Basque is apparently referred to by the word <i>basco</i>, this looks very odd as an originally Gascon word. I would have expected it to be <i>basc</i> (the same as in Catalan). In Occitan (and Catalan), masculine nouns do not normally end in an <i>-o</i>. So Gascon <i>basco</i>, to my unexpert eyes at least, looks suspiciously like a loan from Castilian, and the question then arises: how long has this word been in Gascon (in the form <i>basco</i>)? And was it already in Gascon when French borrowed it? If not, than French <i>basque</i> would not come from Gascon <i>basco</i>, although it might have come from an older Gascon *<i>basc</i>, of course. I wonder if there is anyone out there who knows enough about this to resolve the matter (or throw some more light on it, at least). Or perhaps someone can explain where the idea came from in the first place that French <i>basque</i> &lt; Gascon <i>basco</i>? --<a href="../../../a/_/r/User%7EA_R_King_3ae3.html" title="User:A R King">A R King</a> 20:07, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I can't help much here -- I don't have any sources at hand. As you may already know, Alain Rey's recent <i>Dictionnaire historique de la language française</i> (1998 compact edition, vol. 1 p. 343) says that French <i>Basque</i> comes ultimately from Latin <i>Vasco</i>. It adds, non-committally, "le passage du v au b signale probablement un emprunt à l'espagnol ou au gascon". I agree with you that <i>basco</i> does not look like a native Gascon word; moreover, if Rey and collaborators thought this form <i>basco</i> likely to be the origin of French <i>Basque</i>, they would have said so. <font face="Gill Sans"><a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Dalby_694d.html" title="User:Andrew Dalby"><font color="green">And</font></a><b><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndrew_Dalby_2d43.html" title="User talk:Andrew Dalby">rew D</a></b><a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Dalby_Bibliography_d500.html" title="User:Andrew Dalby/Bibliography"><font color="green">alby</font></a></font> 21:56, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

"La forma basque --coincide Tovar, 1987-- yo creo que hay que ponerla en relación con la declinación del antiguo francés y de muchos de los dialectos de Galia". Basque emigra de la mano de los escritores francófonos prenacionalistas de finales del s.XVIII, principalmente Bela, Sanadon (1785) y Dominique Garat, prendiendo en el exiliado J.A. Zamacola (1818).

<p>In old authors like Ameyric Picaud we find a soemwhat casual distinction between <i>Basques</i> (northerners) and <i>Navarrese</i> (southerners). It's quite curious because it may be one of the oldest mentions of "navarrese". It's not clear though in which category would Western Basques fall in. In general it does seem that the term Basques and its equivalents was first used to refer to the Northern Basques, so I suspect that the Gascon-Occitan trail is the correct one. --<a href="../../../s/u/g/User%7ESugaar_6002.html" title="User:Sugaar">Sugaar</a> 05:08, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Error asks a good question above which had already occurred to me: is the Gascon form really <i>basco</i> (which looks anomalous for Occitan), or might it not really be *<i>bascó</i>? I didn't mention this doubt when writing my original query because I checked it out ahead of time and found out that it is in fact <i>basco</i>, accent on the <i>a</i>. You can see an example of this word in use in the article on <a href="http://oc.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piren%C3%A8us_Atlantics" class="external text" title="http://oc.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piren%C3%A8us_Atlantics" rel="nofollow">Pirinèus Atlantics</a> in the <a href="http://oc.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acu%C3%A8lh" class="external text" title="http://oc.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acu%C3%A8lh" rel="nofollow">Occitan Wikipedia</a>.</dd>

<dd>Conclusions: (1) Occitan does indeed show the expected "regular" form <i>basc</i>. (2) The unexpected Gascon form <i>basco</i> is confirmed as far as present-day usage is concerned. (3) The origin of this Gascon usage remains unexplained. The hypothesis that it is borrowed from a Romance language/dialect from the southern side of the Pyrenees (Castilian or Aragonese) would seem to be an option, but of course this assumes that the word existed in the source language at the time of the hypothetical borrowing, which would be unlikely if the entry of <i>basco</i> into Gascon were not recent and if the spread of the term 'Basque' took place in the north-south direction, as is suggested by some sources quoted. (4) On the face of it (looking at the linguistic evidence), French <i>basque</i> could have been borrowed from Gascon <i>basco</i>, or just as easily from Occitan (and perhaps earlier Gascon) <i>basc</i>. (5) There is no reason why Gascon might not have borrowed <i>basco</i> from the south <i>after</i> French had borrowed <i>basque</i> from Occitan (including Gascon) (*)<i>basc</i>.</dd>

<dd><b>Final conclusion:</b> None of this really affects the issue of who borrowed from whom. The only part of the text of the article that is affected is the assertion that the source of the French term is the Gascon form <i>basco</i> (with an <i>-o</i>). That is the part that I was questioning (and still am). --<a href="../../../a/_/r/User%7EA_R_King_3ae3.html" title="User:A R King">A R King</a> 08:58, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Just a note: Gascon is not so clearly just a dialect of Occitan. Many consider it should be dealt with as a separate Romance and that Catalan is much closer to Occitan than Gascon. For what I know: I've read the "Parabole of the prodigal son" in several Occitan dialects <a href="http://www.lexilogos.com/francais_enfant_prodigue.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.lexilogos.com/francais_enfant_prodigue.htm" rel="nofollow">[13]</a> and are all about the same and not very different from Catalan but quite different from Gascon. Unlike Occitan or Catalan, Gascon is numbered among the romances with strong Basque influences, along with Aragonese and Castilian (Spanish). Among them it seems to be most strongly influenced by Basque (somewhat loically). Krutwig considered it was "the national Romance". --<a href="../../../s/u/g/User%7ESugaar_6002.html" title="User:Sugaar">Sugaar</a> 13:54, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>To quote the article <a href="../../../g/a/s/Gascon.html" title="Gascon">Gascon</a> in Wikipedia: "The Gascon language ... is an Occitan dialect mostly spoken in Gascony." With a background like that, obviously no matter whether I call it a dialect or language, someone like Sugaar is sure to pull me up on it&#160;:-) (Only joking.) Personally I don't care whether we call Gascon a language or a dialect, and fortunately for me, as far as I can see it is so irrelevant to the present disucussion that I can't imagine why Sugaar wants to bring it up here. But since he has... Sugaar, if you have read several Occitan dialects, then perhaps you are also aware of the sociolinguistic context of Occitan and how different it is from that of Basque (or even Catalan). It is my understanding that all of Occitan (include Gascon or here or not, as you wish) is more a cluster of closely related dialects than anything else, and that Occitans are on the whole quite happy for it to be this way, notwithstanding any lower-level ideological differences among its proponents. Historically, Occitan dialects (and Gascon) have consolidated at their respective regional levels rather than doing so at a national level. Thus there is no dialect or variety of Occitan that is not, in a sense, "different from Occitan" understood as an abstract ideal. And in that sense, Gascon is very much like all the (other) "Occitans", although we might want to add that within Gascon too there has been a notable crystalisation of (sub)dialects, e.g. that of the mountain valley of Béarn/Biarno, to the east of Zuberoa. Now it is obvious, it doesn't prove anything, that each form of Occitan (and Gascon) has acquired some linguistic traits of its own (otherwise they wouldn't even be distinct dialects) and that each has been subject to and influenced by different language contact phenomena, including substratum influence. I agree with Sugaar (and so does the whole scholarly community) that Gascon displays what appears to be evidence of Basque-like substratal features (unless we just want to call them areal features and leave it at that). It also seems to be the case that in some sense the Gascons can be thought of as being, in origin, Romanised Basques (or Aquitanians, perhaps). As a linguist, none of that stops me from calling Gascon an Occitan dialect if, in the context of the discussion, such a phrase is coherent. Indeed, in some contexts it is coherent to speak of Castilian as a Romance dialect. --<a href="../../../a/_/r/User%7EA_R_King_3ae3.html" title="User:A R King">A R King</a> 15:57, 5 December 2006 (UTC)

<p>1. Obsession with blood dilution to refer to ethnicity.</p>
<p>2. Refer to entire peoples as having one quality that can be applied to all of them: Spaniards are not sincere, by Basque standards.</p>
<p>3. Radical views: Other Spaniards are as related to Basques as Venezuelians or Californios.</p>
<p>Serve yourselves and read the previous contributions in the related peoples sections here. The drama is how badly Basque Fascism is ignored outside of Spain, and how Basques have to suffer from it every day.

<p>And as to R. King, an Englishman who is so interested in endangered languages and peoples and independence for other peoples, according to his personal page, why don´t you try your own country!. Basque is much healthier than Welsh, by the way, or Scottish or Irish, and Basque people or any other people in Spain and their languages have been granted much more autonomy and respect than any region in the United Kingdom can ever dream of. Why don't you support Welsh or Scottish independence or the return of Northern Ireland to Ireland or say that the Irish, the Scots, the Welsh and the English are not even related people.

And that's not realistic. --<a href="../../../s/u/g/User%7ESugaar_6002.html" title="User:Sugaar">Sugaar</a> 18:41, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well, user King has deleted it altogether. I must admit that it is probably a good solution. This part seems to be always controversial in the people´s articles. Still I cannot help reading between lines. In line with some very radical view points in the Spanish Basque country, which obviously do not represent all Basques, although some people would like to impose their ideas on all of us, some people would go to all lengths to avoid some concepts related to the Basques like Spanish or Spaniard. This is not a place for an extension of that political propaganda, although some people with a clear political agenda use these pages and then accuse others. I think that this is another example of what I said, and I feel it is my moral duty to denouce it. In any case, let it be like that. On the whole I am not in favour of those boxes myself anyway.</p>
<p>Still I would like to congratulate both King and Sugaar. Altough it is already clear that I do not agree at all with some of their view points that are influencing this article, in other respects they are also doing a good job with the article, in my opinion.

<dd>I don't see why that's necessary, the reasons, explanations and arguments have already been laid out quite explicitly enough on this page, surely we're not going to start all over again (I hope not)? Secondly, "relatedness" as a general concept is only an approximative and highly relative concept anyway, and as for more specifiable or "scientific" notions such as linguistic relatedness (whether "genetic", typological, areal or via other contact phenomena), I think these have mostly already been discussed but there will always remain the debatable issue of how much relevance these have, or how decisive they are, for the general ethnic relatedness referred to in the infobox, so there is not much more to be said on that score; in consequence, unless there is a will on all parts to reach a balanced consensus, which there obviously isn't here at the moment, we can all go on arguing for ever and never reach a satisfactory solution. Therefore, at this point I would like to second the proposal made by somebody earlier in this discussion (I forget by whom) that the "relatedness" parameter be omitted from the infobox. I'm sure it isn't really necessary anyway, at least in the Basque case, but at least one good thing about this solution is that it does not force us to keep trying to reach an all-round agreement that we're not getting any closer to. As a matter of fact, at this stage it looks like those who keep wanting to bring the subject up are practising an obstructionist strategy that is damaging for the article. I would strongly suggest that if anyone doesn't like this way of resolving the problem they take their gripes to some other, better suited forum and let us get on with our serious, constructive, encyclopaedic work here, thank you very much. --<a href="../../../a/_/r/User%7EA_R_King_3ae3.html" title="User:A R King">A R King</a> 15:50, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Sugaar, I am not going to get into a discussion which I think is being absolutely arbitrary. Now, suddenly, we have here a new ethnic group, Riojans. In the opinion of some people, it seems that all ethnic groups are possible, except for using the term Spanish or Spaniard. Now everything exists except Spain or in the mind of the extreme regional nationalists Spaniards are the others, maybe, but not us.</p>
<p>OK, I am not going to discuss these things that belong to some arbitrary and agenda-like dogmas, therefore I agree with King here. Continue with the article, you are not doing a bad job after all. I just hope that you will maintain an objective head and will not try and distort facts in one direction. I should repeat: Veritas in re res ipsa est, which in a free translation here is something like: Things are the way they are, not they way they should be or the way some people would like it to be. In other words, the Basque country is what it is, now, in 2006, not what it should have been, according to some people or what we would like it to be.</p>
<p>Personally I want it to be just what it is now and what it has been since Spain was created about half a millennium ago, following an idea that was much older than that, just Spain (well about 90 per cent of us, again). In fact I am an Iberist Socialist (I am a weird guy, aren't I), then of course an Europeist. I believe that all Spaniards (including the Basques of course) and Portuguese are basically the same people, the Iberian people, diverse of course, not monolithic, and I think that Lisbon would make a much more beautiful capital than Madrid, even Barcelona would. Iberism is by the way much more popular in Portugal than in Spain. Interesting, is it not?. We seem to have forgotten them.</p>
<p>You probably want the Basque country to be independent and even include many more territories than the present Basque country. All that is politics. all of them respectful ideas, if we do not want to impose them on others, but all that should neither negate nor distort objective facts. Unfortunately for me, Portugal is what it is and will probably continue to be like that.</p>
<p>In short, I hope that you do a good job and are capable of distinguishing between your desires and subjective view of the world and the objective facts that are required in an Encyclopaedia. <a href="../../../l/s/l/User%7ELSLM_2f47.html" title="User:LSLM">Veritas et Severitas</a> 02:20, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>As part of the cleanup of this section, I have removed the following material because it seems out of place, considering that the article's previous section is specifically about the Basque diaspora (but shorter than the text copied below) and, furthermore, that there exists a main article on the same subject of the <a href="../../../b/a/s/Basque_diaspora.html" title="Basque diaspora">Basque diaspora</a>.</p>
<p>Please note that I have not had time to check whether the information contained in the following paragraphs is already covered by the Basque diaspora main article, or whether information from here needs to be integrated there. I would appreciate it if someone else (perhaps the original editor of the diaspora article?) could worry about that, so that I can be free to carry on working on the cleanup and improvement of the Basque people article, where there is a lot of work to be done. And notice that I haven't finished with the geography section yet: some missing information still needs to be added. There can also be a short reference (one phrase) to the diaspora, referring readers to the appropriate place for more information.</p>

The example of Pinochet was discussed in <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Basques_665f.html" title="List of Basques">List of Basques</a> and removed because we decided that something more than a Basque surname was necessary to be listed as Basque (recent ancestry or residence in the Basque Country, continued connection with the Motherland...).

<p>I don't know if it belongs somewhere else (and I am copying it here to "save" it in case it may), but I don't think it's right here. First, because I don't think anyone can define "Basque feeling" rigorously enough to clarify what this really means. Secondly, because of course the way Navarre and "nearby parts of France" are referred to is all wrong, and in any case, these areas are covered by the two paragraphs I have inserted in place of this one. The other information here, if it is important enough to be provided at all, can perhaps be fit in somewhere else. --<a href="../../../a/_/r/User%7EA_R_King_3ae3.html" title="User:A R King">A R King</a> 15:31, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes. It's too confuse. Obviously many Navarrese and nearly all Northern Basques feel Basque. The "Basque feeling" in La Rioja is probably not very strong though. Nevertheless some border towns like Miranda de Ebro and Castro-Urdiales used to have important political groups claiming (Izquierda Castreña, Izquierda Mirandesa) for incorporation into the BAC. Not sure if such groups exist anymore. --<a href="../../../s/u/g/User%7ESugaar_6002.html" title="User:Sugaar">Sugaar</a> 18:23, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Just browsing through these articles, as a Frenchman quite critical about Basque nationalism. I happen to stumble on quite a number of very PoV formulations in some articles, I shall do some tidying myself&#160;; but here I would like to underline there is certainly a problem of Basque identity on the territory of so-called «&#160;<a href="../../../b/a/s/Basque_country.html" title="Basque country">Basque country</a>&#160;» proper. I notice the article here I am now commenting gives a number of "Basques" on the Basques territories proper as 3 million. But 3 million is the total population of the area called «&#160;<a href="../../../b/a/s/Basque_country.html" title="Basque country">Basque country</a>&#160;», and people leaving there are far from all considering themselves as Basque. I had similar concerns about the <a href="../../../../fr/b/a/s/Basques.html" class="extiw" title="fr:Basques">article on <i>fr</i></a> and had a debate with a very competent editor there, who produced (sadly without sources) a very interesting image, that is <a href="../../../../fr/e/u/s/Image%7EEuskal_identitatea.jpg_cd75.html" class="extiw" title="fr:Image:Euskal_identitatea.jpg">fr:Image:Euskal identitatea.jpg</a> (Question "Do you consider yourself as a Basque&#160;?" Red = No&#160;; Dark Green = Yes, more or less&#160;; Light Green = Yes). As you can see on this image, significant numbers of people leaving in the area called «&#160;<a href="../../../b/a/s/Basque_country.html" title="Basque country">Basque country</a>&#160;» do not consider themselves as Basque, especially in Navarra and in Bayonne area. This should be taken in consideration in the article contents, and especially the ethnic infobox. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFrench_Tourist_3313.html" title="User:French Tourist">French Tourist</a> 20:02, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Actually, the danger of getting into this kind of discussion (which I don't think leads us anywhere useful as far as encyclopaedic writing is concerned) was one of the best reasons I could think of for my suggestion that we remove the paragraph that I left out. This doesn't mean that French Tourist is right about this, of course (does the article on France includes a section about how many people in France "consider themselves French"?...). I imagine the justification for there not being one is about the same: that to start with, an encyclopaedia is hardly the place for such a discussion. But of course it will help to avoid such a discussion if the article also omits references to how much "French feeling" there is in other parts of the world outside France. Personally, I believe that there is about as much of a consensus in the Basque Country about "considering oneself Basque" as there is in France about "considering oneself French" or in Spain about "considering oneself Spanish", but as can be seen here, we each tend to tell the story as it best suits us. Which is why sometimes it's best to just smile and walk on. --<a href="../../../a/_/r/User%7EA_R_King_3ae3.html" title="User:A R King">A R King</a> 09:16, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I disagree with your analogy. There seems to be very little about French ethnicity on the <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">France</a> article, which is quite reasonable since it does not parallel <a href="../../../b/a/s/Basque_people.html" title="Basque people">Basque people</a>. An article <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_people.html" title="French people">French people</a>, though, exists, completed by a quite sketchy <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_citizenship_and_identity.html" title="French citizenship and identity">French citizenship and identity</a>. The article <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_people.html" title="French people">French people</a>, however, does NOT try to give a number of «&#160;French people&#160;» but gives THREE different possible counts, precisely distinguished&#160;: French citizens (the count being totally unaccurate, but this is not a matter for the present discussion page), French speakers and people "claiming French ancestry". Here, paralelling the infobox with the text of the article introduction brings me to understand that the «&#160;3 million&#160;» I read is an estimate of the people belonging to the Basque «&#160;ethnic group&#160;» (or «&#160;nation&#160;») and leaving in the area known as «&#160;<a href="../../../b/a/s/Basque_country.html" title="Basque country">Basque country</a>&#160;».</dd>
<dd>If the "3 million" means something else, this should be clarified. If it means the number of ethnic Basque, it seems quite dubious to me, it should be sourced or replaced by something sourceable. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFrench_Tourist_3313.html" title="User:French Tourist">French Tourist</a> 18:27, 25 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Let's see Basque Country is a disambiguation page that leads to <a href="../../../b/a/s/Basque_Country_%28autonomous_community%29_ebd9.html" title="Basque Country (autonomous community)">Basque Country (autonomous community)</a>, AKA Western Basque Country, to <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northern_Basque_Country_6dd6.html" title="Northern Basque Country">Northern Basque Country</a> and to <a href="../../../b/a/s/Basque_Country_%28historical_territory%29_1ab7.html" title="Basque Country (historical territory)">Basque Country (historical territory)</a>, that includes both plus (High) <a href="../../../n/a/v/Navarre.html" title="Navarre">Navarre</a>. Obviously the 3 million figure refers to people living in the historical territory or the Basque Country as modern Basques usually define it.</p>
<p>There's no way of defining "ethnic Basque" because censal data does not ask people for ethnic identification, yet it's clear that Basque identity is absolutely mainstream among Western and Northern Basques and surely a more confuse issue in Navarre. Basque identity does not mean nationalism, just feeling Basque: some feel Basque and Spanish/French and others exclussively or primarily Basque. In general the most accepted concept is that "Basque is who lives and works in the Basque Country", hence the 3 million figure is merely the adition of the population of the three administrative dvisions that adds up to 2.93 million.</p>
<p>The term Basque seems to have a northern origin by the way. The socio-political situation in the North is that virtually everyone feels Basque, that all majors claim a separate Basque department (something that is systematically ignored by Paris) and greater presence of Basque language in administration and schooling and that Basque nationalism is a growing trend despite the difficulties of the non-proportional representation system and lack of Basque-specific electoral circunscriptions. --<a href="../../../s/u/g/User%7ESugaar_6002.html" title="User:Sugaar">Sugaar</a> 13:44, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>"There's no way of defining "ethnic Basque" because censal data does not ask people for ethnic identification" -&gt; I agree more or less ("more or less" because there seems to exist data due to various investigations outside the census sphere - see the <a href="../../../../fr/e/u/s/Image%7EEuskal_identitatea.jpg_cd75.html" class="extiw" title="fr:Image:Euskal_identitatea.jpg">fr:Image:Euskal identitatea.jpg</a> ). This should be anyway a reason to give no data at all and not an irrelevant data.</dd>
<dd>"the most accepted concept is that "Basque is who lives and works in the Basque Country"" -&gt; this assertion should be sourced, since I don't feel it as correct. My (now deceased) grand-mother, grand-aunt and uncle lived in the so-called <a href="../../../b/a/s/Basque_country.html" title="Basque country">Basque country</a>, both in <a href="../../../b/a/y/Bayonne.html" title="Bayonne">Bayonne</a>, and would definitely not have felt themselves as Basque. This concept is not accepted outside Basque nationalist-friendly spheres. To me it seems as odd as definining as a <a href="../../../n/a/t/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States_7838.html" title="Native Americans in the United States">Native Americans in the United States</a> people "who live and work in the United States of America". Of course the proportion of ethnic Basque among "people living and working in the Basque country" is much stronger than the population of "Native Americans in the United States" in the American population, but it seems to me nonetheless as irrelevant to annex the total population of the <a href="../../../b/a/s/Basque_country.html" title="Basque country">Basque country</a> (which would be of course a relevant information in the <a href="../../../b/a/s/Basque_country.html" title="Basque country">Basque country</a> page) on the <a href="../../../b/a/s/Basque_people.html" title="Basque people">Basque people</a> article.</dd>
<dd>"The socio-political situation in the North is that virtually everyone feels Basque" -&gt; I strongly disagree on this precise assertion, but I don't think it is useful for the article to launch a discussion about this precise point. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFrench_Tourist_3313.html" title="User:French Tourist">French Tourist</a> 17:25, 26 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I consider there are three about million Basques simply because this is the figure given as a rule by authors and sources on this. I think there is a general consensus. I also understand that the figure reflects the population of the (whole) Basque Country. As far as I am concerned this is not controversial. Personally I'm not interested in fighting over something I believe is already consensual and about which I have no specialised knowledge or additional information, so I am not going to get involved in an argument and I won't spend my time looking for sources to back up what I have just said. If somebody else feels like doing that, go ahead. All I can and will say is that in the Basque Country it is generally known that this country has a population of approximately three million. --<a href="../../../a/_/r/User%7EA_R_King_3ae3.html" title="User:A R King">A R King</a> 17:30, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Totally agree with French Tourist, that paragraph was no neutral. I think sugaar comentaries are ridiculous. I am alavese (but I don´t consider basque myself), but I live in Castro-Urdiales and calling "Izquierda Castreña" important political group is pathetic, it has no political representation in the council and our mayor is from anti-basque party PRC, (he proposes "not more basques in Castro"), and he won the elections, curious...in Miranda also the same (0% basques); so please don´t be pan-basquists. I think, as French Tourist says, that the article has to get that many people (most in Navarre) and Bayonne didn´t consider themselves basques, and basque nationalists are high minority in Alava (they have 19 seats of the total of 51 in provincial parlament and 1 of 8 seats in spanish parliament) and in France. That´s autodetemination, isn´t it?</p>

<dd>Even in the twentieth century, some mountainous regions escaped Christianity.</dd>

<p>I find this difficult to believe. Actually it should be big cities where you could find some atheist or Jew, but since it is attributed to Gimbutas, I don't dare to remove it. --<a href="../../../e/r/r/User%7EError_ca98.html" title="User:Error">Error</a> 23:30, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>unique social institutions startlingly different from those of feudal Europe. The Basques never developed an elitist culture, instead appointing a 'Lord of Biscay' by democratic election....</dd>
</dl>
<p>AFAIK, Navarre developed French-style feudalism. The Late Middle Ages were known by the battles between family leagues (Oñaz vs Gamboa, Agramont vs <a href="../../../b/e/a/Beaumont.html" title="Beaumont">Beaumont</a>). And until the 20th century, the jauntxos marked the life of each village. The election of a lord reminds me of Vikings and other Norsemen. So it is not the Chinese empire, but there have been social classes among Basques, see <a href="../../../a/g/o/Agote.html" title="Agote">Agotes</a>. Since it is attributed to Hadington, I don't know how to counteract it. --<a href="../../../e/r/r/User%7EError_ca98.html" title="User:Error">Error</a> 23:46, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
