<p>Two things regarding the most recent edit...</p>
<ol>
<li>Do you have a cite for crystal ball comment that she'll appear in WW3? That may be a better cite than the one you used (see next).</li>
<li>The cite you've linked to supports the inference of her not being called "Copperhead". It's unlikely that this crop of writers would create what appears to be a national hero and name her after an animal not native to that continent, let alone that country.</li>

<dd>I'll see if I can find the cite about the Freedom of Power treaty signers showing up in WW3. Newsarama has a horrible search engine and Google doesn't seem to go deep into the site. I put that ref/ cite in there because it provided important info, it doesn't call her Copperhead but it does state that she is from India. Actually there are three types of Copperhead snake and the <a href="../../../e/l/a/Elaphe_radiata.html" title="Elaphe radiata">Elaphe radiata</a> is native to India. --<a href="../../../b/a/s/User%7EBasique_8925.html" title="User:Basique">Basique</a> 23:39, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>hrm... Didn't know that and I was running on the "general knowledge" of the North American snake. Still unlikely given the cobra motife of the costume. The Australian is in the right family, but wrong region.</dd>

<p>I just want to check something on your logic here:</p>
<p>Are you suggesting <i>all</i> <a href="../../../f/i/c/Category%7EFictional_demons_e14b.html" title="Category:Fictional demons">fictional demons</a>, in the parent and all the subs, be dupe catted as <a href="../../../f/i/c/Category%7EFictional_magic_users_4314.html" title="Category:Fictional magic users">fictional magic users</a>, again by parent and appropriate sub?</p>
<p>That seems to be your inference with your edit summary at Demons Three.</p>
<p>I also get the impression that you see the fictional demon cats as unusable, or at least poorly structured. Am I reading that right?</p>

<p>In DC Comics as we've seen, all Demons are magical by nature and action, and I can cite the issues where every one of those Demons I tagged used magic, in fact according to christian fiction/mythology their very existence is magical. So yes they get double tagged as Demons and Magic Users especially since DC Comics Demons is such a small category and the average user won't know to look there. <b>Project members</b> would, but the Demons Three are fairly obscure so I see the average <b>User's</b> search tree as something like this ("Search for character I recognize -&gt; <a href="../../../z/a/t/Zatanna.html" title="Zatanna">Zatanna</a> -&gt; search Zatanna &lt;&gt; categories -&gt; "Ah Demons Three maybe thats them?" -&gt; <a href="../../../d/e/m/Demons_Three_69c1.html" title="Demons Three">Demons Three</a> &lt;&gt; "Hey there's a demon category!")

<dd>Then the category is miss named. It implies mages, wizards, witches, sorcerers, and the link. <b>Fictional characters from comics based on magic</b> (or the supernatural) would be a better fit for a cat that includes praticioners of magic, those endowed by magic, magical creatures, and deities. — <a href="../../../j/_/g/User%7EJ_Greb_e233.html" title="User:J Greb">J Greb</a> 20:51, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Just 2¢, but I could understand the Power Girl and Superman ads, X-Ray vision after all reads as radiation. The stuff that pushes it for me is when the cat looks like it's getting added based on an assumed component of a power or the characters origin/theme w/o a power component. <i>Those</i> are symptomatic of the reason the cat is in CfD. — <a href="../../../j/_/g/User%7EJ_Greb_e233.html" title="User:J Greb">J Greb</a> 05:18, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>CovenantD you shoould probably read the description on Kryptonians. X-Ray vision for one, their heat vision is concentrated solar radiation, they absorbs and converts solar radiation (as do Daxamites). Same goes for Hyperion except his is called "atomic vision". JGreb in the most recent issue of Uncle Sam and the Freedom Fighters it's pretty explicity stated that the Human Bomb's powers are nuclear. Read the description of Multiplex's powers it's "nuclear fission" (and duplication). As for Damage I based that on the fact that his powers come directly from the original Atom (Al Pratt) and he was nuclear powered. So Damage might be a bit dubious. --<a href="../../../b/a/s/User%7EBasique_8925.html" title="User:Basique">Basique</a> 16:55, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As I pointed out in the edit summary for the Human Bomb: add the power to the body of the article <i>along with</i> the category. Otherwise you are abusing the category system.</dd>
<dd>Mutiplex: most of the editors arguing to save the category are being very explicit that the definition is limited to absorption (taking radiation into the character), generation (character is a source of "hard" radiation), and projection (projection of a concentrated form of "hard" radiation). At best Multiplex's power is "based on a nuclear process" and does not fall into that grouping. Inclusion based on theme or origin just bolsters the "overly broad" argument.</dd>
<dd>Damage: Adding the category on fan assumption undermines the category and the article as objective, reliable, and verifiable.</dd>
<dd>Kryptonians: While I agree with the X-Ray vision, and would also agree with "heat" vision as it was originally written in the comics (concentrated use of X-Ray vision), inclusion based on "concentrated solar radiation", which is concentrated light, chips away at arguments of support based on "doesn't include light manipulators".</dd>

<p>I understand your reasoning on the Human Bomb and won't re-add the cat without citing in his powers section. Multiplex I based on the description given in his first appearances which I think i'm going to have to enter into his article. On Damage I totally see your point while he is supposedly a clone of Al Pratt they've never explicitly stated he had nuclear powers, I didn't add Nuklon for the same reason. Wait, so part of their argument is that radiation manipulation categories cannot cover light? That doesn't make any sense seeing as solar radiation is both <b>electromagnetic radiation</b> and <b>particle radiation</b>, light is <b><a href="../../../r/a/d/Radiant_energy.html" title="Radiant energy">radiant energy</a></b> and radiant energy is a byproduct of "electromagnetic radiation". I don't think most of the people voting there really understand what radiation is. "Electromagnetic radiation" covers light (infrared, ultraviolet) and gamma rays but "particle radiation" covers the nasty charged particle alpha, beta and neutron family. There are three types of emissive <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radiation.html" title="Radiation">radiation</a>, and I only need one. I'm pretty sure the category will be deleted but I wanted a screenshot of the category filled in, so I wouldn't have to hunt all those characters down again when we finally get a title that even CovenantD can agree on. Have you noticed that he hasn't offered any viable solutions to the situation? What do you think of "<b>Fictional characters with the power to manipulate particle radiation</b>". It's direct it's focused, and it's to the point. --<a href="../../../b/a/s/User%7EBasique_8925.html" title="User:Basique">Basique</a> 17:42, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'll try to bring this down to a nutshell: The original presentation of the cat was delete in part to the argument that it was overly broad and would include any character that could manipulate light, heat, electricity, etc. Counterarguments in later presentations have boiled down to "those already have cats" and what I read as limiting the cat to "hard" radiation (alpha, beta, gamma, and fictional relatives).</dd>
<dd>I'd suggest waiting a few months after this CfD closes before re-upping the cat, name change or not. Other wise you run the risk of what kicked this round off -- Speedy as recreation of previously deleted.</dd>
<dd>It also may be a moot point. At least one editor has made it clear in the "...power of flight" CfD that he intends to put the parent cat and all the subs up for List &amp; Delete.</dd>

<dd>Addendum: Characters that likely shouldn't be in the current list, or your revised list:
<ul>
<li>Comet Queen (Needs the powers described in-article to justify cat.)</li>
<li>Galactus (Lacks specific reference to rad manip, unless it is a subset of reality warping or the "Power Cosmic". If the latter all the Heralds should be in, not just the Surfer.)</li>
<li>Lectronn (Clarification of the "electron bursts" being electricity or not.)</li>
<li>Microwavebelle (At least in your redefined cat, as microwaves are not particle radiation.)</li>
<li>Onslaught (Same as Galactus.)</li>
<li>Vibranium (Needs a cite that "many other types of energy" includes particle radiation.)</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>Also, I can think of two that would need to be added based on the Sunfire "family": Cyclops and Havok (conversion of solar radiation into other superhuman powers).</dd>

<dd>Don't worry about that, I've never had any reason to subject myself to heartache of creating a category, it's easier to wait until the Project gets around to realizing we need it. I thank Srstorey for trying it this time though. Hey thanks for the Addendum. In the Marvel Universe guide for Lectronn it's "electron bursts" not electricity, but your right it is "electromagnetic radiation". And thanks for Cyclops and Havok, it looks like i'm going to have to make a list sometime soon. For Comet Queen I'll have to find my Who's Who in the Legion, I wish there was a Doctor Regulus page. The "Power Cosmic" I tried to stay away from because it is so vague so I may leave him and all the Heralds off. Microwavebelle not one of mine, but I left her because I have no idea how broad the final category may be. Vibranium, Kryptonite, White Dwarf Star matter, Nth Metal, and Prometheum are all in that radioactive Twilight Zone. Apparently they all give off hard (electromagnetic) radiation but not enough to kill humans unless concentrated over time so he's probably off unless I get the three radiation categories we need. In the real world if you're in the presence of an unshielded transuranic that is radioactive and radiant then you're most likely dead or dying. --<a href="../../../b/a/s/User%7EBasique_8925.html" title="User:Basique">Basique</a> 18:47, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>A lot of the fictional elements you have to be careful with from the standpoint of the cats. Some, like Kryptonite, have been directly equated to real radioactive elements/isotopes. Others, like Vibranium, are less clear since the emissions aren't clearly stated in the primary or, if they exist, secondary sources. — <a href="../../../j/_/g/User%7EJ_Greb_e233.html" title="User:J Greb">J Greb</a> 19:41, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

With regards to the reversions, listing the credits for the <a href="../../../t/a/l/Tales_of_the_New_Gods_48bc.html" title="Tales of the New Gods">Tales of the New Gods</a> series in the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Gods_fa08.html" title="New Gods">New Gods</a> page I thought was overkill for that particular article, as TOTNG ran as a backup feature in the Orion comic book, and I think there are more apt things available to throw in the New Gods article (that haven't been put in yet) than a mention of professionals almost entirely unconnected with the Fourth World (Liefeld, Larsen, Miller, basically everyone on that list), save for the pencilling on a 5 page story. I have also added a link from the <a href="../../../o/r/i/Orion_%28comics%29.html" title="Orion (comics)">Orion (comics)</a> page to the <a href="../../../o/r/i/Orion_%28comic_book%29.html" title="Orion (comic book)">Orion (comic book)</a> page, as the latter article still existed, though portions were gutted without regard to keeping the article coherent.

<li>There hasn't been much "merged" into the pages. I still haven't had explained to me why my points are invalid. I understand I lost the vote, but there were only 3 voters, and one of them was you! Can this article somehow be kept? Going after the Orion (comic book) article seems like such a random thing to be hating on. <a href="../../../t/o/o/User%7EToodiesel_6073.html" title="User:Toodiesel">Toodiesel</a> 17:06, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
<ul>
<li>The decision had nothing to do with the article being "hated on" it was considered redundant and crufty. The page seemed to be less about Orion and more about Walt Simonson. If you have information you would like to add to the <a href="../../../o/r/i/Orion_%28comics%29.html" title="Orion (comics)">Orion (comics)</a>, <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Gods_fa08.html" title="New Gods">New Gods</a> or <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walt_Simonson_969f.html" title="Walt Simonson">Walt Simonson</a> pages then please do so, that is where the information from <a href="../../../o/r/i/Orion_%28comic_book%29.html" title="Orion (comic book)">Orion (comic book)</a> was put. If you feel a need to help the project with your knowledge, many of the New Gods pages need an accurate going over and expansion, take for instance <a href="../../../t/i/g/Tigra_%28DC_Comics%29_bbc6.html" title="Tigra (DC Comics)">Tigra (DC Comics)</a>. --<a href="../../../b/a/s/User%7EBasique_8925.html" title="User:Basique">Basique</a> 17:11, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>I would disagree, as Simonson is mentioned only in context to his duties on the book, except for once in reference to "Walt Simonson's Orion series". I feel that there is no gushing. Anyways, how is one NOT going to mention Simonson, since he was the writer/penciller, and half of the time inker, on the book? "Redundant and crufty"? The design is not different than any other wikipedia article, and the information originally presented in <a href="../../../o/r/i/Orion_%28comic_book%29.html" title="Orion (comic book)">Orion (comic book)</a> is found nowhere else on wikipedia. You've also asked me to add information to the <a href="../../../o/r/i/Orion_%28comics%29.html" title="Orion (comics)">Orion (comics)</a> page, yet when you did the merge, you left out the entire article that you were supposedly merging! You simply redirected the page! Tut, tut! Where's the merge? <a href="../../../t/o/o/User%7EToodiesel_6073.html" title="User:Toodiesel">Toodiesel</a> 17:27, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
<p>The relevant text that you removed was put back into both the pages we merged into yesterday. The rest of the text in that article was filler, which is why it wasn't added to either of the <i>Merge</i> pages. If you can add relevant material, not filler then please do so. The design was no different, but the content was. --<a href="../../../b/a/s/User%7EBasique_8925.html" title="User:Basique">Basique</a> 17:33, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Filler would be nonsensical, irrelevant stuff. If you could actually cite examples of filler, maybe I would be inclined to agree with you, but I have simply provided data about the Orion series on its page. Nothing more. <a href="../../../t/o/o/User%7EToodiesel_6073.html" title="User:Toodiesel">Toodiesel</a> 17:36, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
<p>This is filler: <i>Orion ran for 25 issues, from June 2000 to 2002. Issues #15 and #25 were oversized and priced at $3.95 instead of the usual $2.50. Sales of the title would see a gradual decline in preorders, averaging under 14,000 copies mark during the second half of the book's run. Sample sales are 14,372 copies for issue #15, and 11,891 for the last issue, #25.</i> Anything else you need cleared up? That pretty much is the only bit of info not carried over, everything else was added in a post-merge cleanup just now. --<a href="../../../b/a/s/User%7EBasique_8925.html" title="User:Basique">Basique</a> 17:41, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p><br /></p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>I noticed the merge you did with Orion (comic book) and the New Gods articles. For some reason, your merges are horribly mangled. The first merge you did with <a href="../../../o/r/i/Orion_%28comics%29.html" title="Orion (comics)">Orion (comics)</a> had numerous copy mistakes that had to be fixed. Additionally, your <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Gods_fa08.html" title="New Gods">New Gods</a> merge for some reason took a random sentence from The Gates of Apokolips portion, without even giving context that the reprint was TGoA. Have a look. As for your filler: Giving an account of the publishing dates, as well as pricing and sales information is not filler. It is perfectly appropriate under Publishing history portion of the article. What else could be more relevant than the price, dates, and sales information? <a href="../../../t/o/o/User%7EToodiesel_6073.html" title="User:Toodiesel">Toodiesel</a> 17:44, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Listen guy, as I wrote up above if you feel there are minor corrections in the articles that need to be made. Then - fix - them. It's perfectly appropriate in a <b>Publication Title Page</b>, which Orion and New Gods are not. I'm walking away now, but I will be keeping an eye on both those pages as part of a general New Gods cleanup. --<a href="../../../b/a/s/User%7EBasique_8925.html" title="User:Basique">Basique</a> 17:49, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>New Gods "cleanup"? No offense, but why bother when it's the merge that has to be cleaned up? I was trying to make my own publication title page, where such info, as you've agreed is perfectly pertinent, but it appears that you do not like having one. Where does this information go, then? <a href="../../../t/o/o/User%7EToodiesel_6073.html" title="User:Toodiesel">Toodiesel</a> 18:17, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>I've looked under the wikiproject comics guidelines and I see that eponymous publications are allowed as separate articles, but should be listed under (publication), while I've listed Orion under (comic book). Would that be an ok place to put such information?</li>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>As with point one: editorial has made comments that some of the inconsistencies are deliberate. It is possible that Simonson and the artist got "marching orders" to use the Gilotina image and this is part of what ever they are building to. At this point we just don't know.</dd>

<dd>Also, I think you may have miss understood my concern about the phrase "Most recently". <a href="../../../d/a/t/WP%7EDATED_d285.html" title="WP:DATED">WP:DATED</a> is fairly clear: avoid phrasing and situations that become dated quickly. This phrase does just that, as does the section header "Current status" you added. Her "current status" is unconscious as of the end of <i>Hawkgirl</i> #61. If she doesn't appear next month, it becomes "unused, fate unexplained" and will sit that way until her next appearance. This seems bad form for the article.</dd>

<p>"What I find it funny that you keep coming back to this page expecting me not to keep an eye on it." is a weird and unnecessarily confrontational thing to say. Don't assume anyone is "expecting" anything about you. The Joshua Clay article is one of many on my watch list. Therefore I'll wind up revisiting it at times. You didn't remotely cross my mind. Certainly you could have (after the disagreements we had over it a long darn time ago). You just didn't. If I thought about it, I wouldn't have been stupid enough to "expect" that the article's not on your watch list too, given your history of possessive behavior regarding the article. I'll try to assume you didn't mean for that remark to sound as confrontational or egotistical as it did, but you need to be conscious of how your wording can strike other people. (And yes, I realize that this reply can come across as confrontational and give the impression of not showing good faith, but honestly, the only alternative is to say nothing.) <a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoczilla_1c36.html" title="User:Doczilla">Doczilla</a> 05:41, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
