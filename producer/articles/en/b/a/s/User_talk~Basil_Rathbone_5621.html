<dd>The basic rule of Masonic Editors is to remove any contribution by Non-Masonic editors demanding it be discussed while allowing all Masonic Editors to make contributions as they like without similar discussion. Similarily any information that already existed on page that is critical of Freemasonry is deleted without discussion while demanding discussion before deleting any information that is pro-masonic. Masonic editors combine their numbers to go-around 3rr rules, acting as a group, and harrass and attempt to get banned non-masonic editors who refuse to accept their hegemony of the pages. Additionly Masonic editors make false 3rr, vandalism, and sockpuppet allegations against any editor who is known to make contributions that are critical of freemasonry. So good luck <a href="../../../h/i/p/User%7EHipocrite_bee6.html" title="User:Hipocrite">Hipocrite</a>, I wish you well.<a href="../../../b/a/s/User%7EBasil_Rathbone_9abb.html" title="User:Basil Rathbone">Basil Rathbone</a> 17:59, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Step 1. Do not comment on other editors until you have enough experience here to understand that the above comment is not helpful.</dd>
<dd>Step 2. Do not add any content to the page that fails any of our three important policies -&gt; <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>.</dd>
<dd>Step 3. When chaning the article, do not delete, only add. Deletions are much harder than addtions.</dd>
<dd>Step 4. When adding, make sure all of your statements were made by someone else first. All additions must be cited. If you are the person who found out about the conspiracy, then it's not acceptable for publication here. You must find a source that said what you want to say, and then quote it.</dd>
<dd>If you follow those 4 steps, I will make sure your edits stick. <a href="../../../h/i/p/User%7EHipocrite_bee6.html" title="User:Hipocrite">Hipocrite</a> - <a href="../../../h/i/p/User_talk%7EHipocrite_6b44.html" title="User talk:Hipocrite">«<small>Talk</small>»</a> 18:11, 9 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It is the large group of Masonic editors which keep deleting Material critical of Freemasonry with no discussion. They refuse any contributions by non-masonic editors, deleting them every time, again with no discussion. This is where the problem is. I am causing no difficulties on that page, other than having the 'temerity' to contradict and challenge the Masonic Editors complete control of Freemasonr related pages, a situation that has existed for two years, a situation which Wikipedia has done little if anything to recitify.<a href="../../../b/a/s/User%7EBasil_Rathbone_9abb.html" title="User:Basil Rathbone">Basil Rathbone</a> 18:29, 9 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Hipocrite, William and Malthusian are <i>not</i> in the habit of issuing warnings lightly, and I have no reason to doubt the <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">good faith</a> of the others either. Sometimes when a large number of poeple tell you that you're wrong, it's because you are. Deleting comments from your Talk page is frowned on, for good reason. Apart from anything else, the more you delete comments the more you will have to delete other comments from other people telling you the same thing - you can't have adebate if one party gives every appearance of not listening. I strongly recommend you take the advice you have been given to stop blanking this page, and also that you seek consenssu on the Talk pages of the freemasonry articles. There is an established way of achieving consensus on Wikipedia, and neither edit warring nor deleting talk pages are part of it. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_75dc.html" title="User:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid">&#160;Guy,</span> you know?</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">[T]</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JzG_1e67.html" title="Special:Contributions/JzG">[C]</a></sub> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg_b083.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/a/ae/Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg/25px-Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg_b083.html" /></a> 19:16, 9 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The Masons are always posting their slander on my talk page. I on the other hand don't make posts on their pages. I don't vandalize their pages with 'suspected sockpuppet'. But if I remove their trash from my page? Fine, I don't really care. I've seen for the last two years how the Masonic Editors have run off any non-masonic editor using their Wiki lawyering skills, making hypocritical accusations and use of the rules. No one has ever stopped them at 'Wiki Central', and you know what, I bet dollars to donuts you won't stop them now either. Your just scared of them, what they will do to Wikipedia if they don't get there way. And your're probably right, they are that powerful. They can and probably will turn Wikipedia's lights out if they don't get there way, just like they are trying to do all over the internet.<a href="../../../b/a/s/User%7EBasil_Rathbone_9abb.html" title="User:Basil Rathbone">Basil Rathbone</a> 20:41, 9 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>People are getting very tired of this continuous stream of <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">personal attacks</a>.

<dd>Their suspicions appear at this point to be well-founded. If you are, as you assert, not a sockpuppet of <a href="../../../l/i/g/User%7ELightbringer_ee74.html" title="User:Lightbringer">Lightbringer</a>, your best route to proving it is to make constructive edits to other areas of the encyclopaedia, and to engage in constructive debate withotu accusing absolutely everybody who disagrees with you of being a mason. Aside form making you look paranoid, that is a sure-fire way to get yourself blocked for incivility. Oh, and as far as I can tell (without actually undergoing psychoanalysis) I have never given so much as a passing thought as to what the Masons can do to Wikipedia. I suspect that it amounts to the square root of fuck-all. - <a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_75dc.html" title="User:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid">&#160;Guy,</span> you know?</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">[T]</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JzG_1e67.html" title="Special:Contributions/JzG">[C]</a></sub> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg_b083.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/a/ae/Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg/25px-Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg_b083.html" /></a> 20:49, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I want to be very clear - I am not a Mason, I know nothing about Masons, nor do I care about Masons. I saw your posting at AMA requests for advocacy, and while I am unwilling to advocate for you, I felt that I would be able to help resolve a conflict, or at least make the article better and not make a conflict worse. I will do this, regardless of how much of my time is wasted fixing what was once a featured article. You can either get on the bus by helping me fix your edits for inclusion in the article, or you can get thrown off of it either when ArbCom or an admin blocks you from the article or the project. I intend to give this self-same offer to the scores of disruptive pro-side editors who you have been in a constant edit war with. Since the whole lot of you do little more than POV war over Masonic article, I really could care less if any of you get banned or stick around. I will fix the article with or without you. <a href="../../../h/i/p/User%7EHipocrite_bee6.html" title="User:Hipocrite">Hipocrite</a> - <a href="../../../h/i/p/User_talk%7EHipocrite_6b44.html" title="User talk:Hipocrite">«<small>Talk</small>»</a> 21:33, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks for uploading <b>Image:Mason_penalsigns.gif</b>. The image page currently doesn't specify who created the image, so the <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copyright.html" title="Copyright">copyright</a> status is therefore unclear.
