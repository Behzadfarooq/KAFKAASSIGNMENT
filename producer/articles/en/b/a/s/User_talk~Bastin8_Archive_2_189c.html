<p>Would you mind taking a look at the Dominion_of_British_West_Florida article. I thought I had done a pretty good job of bringing it up to the Wikipedia's standards (using your suggestions) with my last revisions, but user:Centauri quite obviously did not. I do have a lot of 'pride of authorship' in the article as it was before, and am afraid that my bias may actually be showing in the article as I wrote it. Could you do a comparison of the last revision by user:bo and the current edition, and help me figure out how to address his legitimate concerns while still giving a more 'even handed' description of what the micronation claims to be?</p>

<p>Hi, you moved the Luxembourgish river Syre to Syr. I'm not completely sure, but I think it should be at Syre (and Roodt-sur-Syr at Roodt-sur-Syre). The Michelin map of Luxembourg has Syre (see for instance <a href="http://www.viamichelin.com" class="external free" title="http://www.viamichelin.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.viamichelin.com</a>), and the municipality of Betzdorf (see <a href="http://www.betzdorf.lu" class="external free" title="http://www.betzdorf.lu" rel="nofollow">http://www.betzdorf.lu</a>) has Syre (also for Roodt). <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkussep_658a.html" title="User:Markussep">Markussep</a> 21:10, 7 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'm not at all sure, either. I initially thought that it was 'Syre', hence why I created the article there. However, I have been told that it's 'Syr' by someone from Luxembourg (whom, admittedly, I know only via the Internet). Having now looked at the links that you've provided, and re-Googled it, I can see that it is likely that it is indeed 'Syre'. Perhaps my Luxembourgish source is confusing it with the Lëtzebuergesch name ('Sir'), is unfamiliar with the spelling, or is simply having me on. I will ask whether he has any proof that the spelling is as he says it is. I should have an answer by tomorrow, or maybe Tuesday. Until then, I suggest that we stick with 'Syr', simply for expediency. Thanks for the heads-up, and your continued interest in a subject on which you have contributed so much. <a href="../../../b/a/s/User%7EBastin8_Signature_e263.html" title="User:Bastin8/Signature">Bastin</a> 22:42, 7 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"Syr" might be the (old?) German name, see for instance <a href="../../../../de/s/y/r/Syr.html" class="extiw" title="de:Syr">de:Syr</a>, but also <a href="../../../../de/l/i/s/Liste_der_Fl%C3%BCsse_in_Luxemburg_a2db.html" class="extiw" title="de:Liste_der_Flüsse_in_Luxemburg">de:Liste der Flüsse in Luxemburg</a>. Syr and Syre are both used in German and in French texts, but Syre is more frequent in both languages according to Google (I searched for the combination with Mertert). But let's await your source. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkussep_658a.html" title="User:Markussep">Markussep</a> 17:51, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>He was quite adamant that 'Syr' is correct, but, having directed him to your links and various Google combinations, he 'conceded' that there's probably more than one version and that he might be on the other side of a dialectic divide. He did point out a couple of site that supported his case (<a href="http://www.luxembourg.co.uk/nutshell.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.luxembourg.co.uk/nutshell.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, <a href="http://www.eu2005.lu/en/savoir_lux/lux_publications/tt_savoir/tt_savoir.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.eu2005.lu/en/savoir_lux/lux_publications/tt_savoir/tt_savoir.pdf" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>), which ought to use the correct English language spelling (being a UK-based tourist office and the EU presidency site respectively). Having said that, the sheer weight of sites demands that 'Syre' be preferred. I suggest moving it back to 'Syre' and noting 'Syr' as a possible alternative spelling. <a href="../../../b/a/s/User%7EBastin8_Signature_e263.html" title="User:Bastin8/Signature">Bastin</a> 15:58, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree. Same for <a href="../../../r/o/o/Roodt-sur-Syre_8842.html" title="Roodt-sur-Syre">Roodt-sur-Syre</a>, I'll move both and note the alternative spellings. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkussep_658a.html" title="User:Markussep">Markussep</a> 16:07, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>On the off-chance that there are any residual niggles over this:</p>
<ul>
<li>You are right in concluding that the correct spelling is <b>Syre</b>.</li>
<li>The alternative spelling of <b>Syr</b> does also exist, which can be ascribed to the linguistic overlap between the formal French and the colloquial Luxembourgish or German.</li>
<li>The French spelling of Luxembourg place names takes official precedence over the (nevertheless acknowledged) Luxembourgish-language spelling (for instance, street signs feature the former in bold script above the latter in italics).</li>
<li>Besides this hierarchical distinction, the <b>Syre</b> spelling is in more widespread use than <b>Syr</b>: a Google.lu search for <b>"syre"</b> gives <b>54,700</b> results, compared to <b>28,900</b> for <b>"syr"</b>.</li>

<p>Please stop throwing around terms like "vandalism". You use the word much too freely, particularly given your own record. The point I was making was that you should treat other users with some civility and respect; they may well have made a useful contribution to this site which goes beyond pointless and ill-informed meddling. But I can see from the tone of your reply, that this has again passed you by.</p>
<p>The problem is that your changing "Britain" to "the United Kingdom" is not in any way an "improvement". It alters the meaning of a sentence, which I thought you would realise. It is ironic that someone so obsessively pedantic on the use of these terms should themselves substitute one for another as if they have the same meaning, when they obviously don't. It is also clumsy writing to constantly use three words instead of one, when the meaning is already clear and accurate.</p>
<p>And yes, Britain is correct. It is a real place, and a real term. It does not mean "absolutely nothing", so please don't tell me to stop using it. If you so desperately feel we should always say "Great Britain" and not "Britain", you can always raise this on the manual of style talk page. But "Britain" is perfectly correct, and you can check any reference. It may shock you, but the word is in everyday usage and is accepted by everyone in the world except you. If you really want to argue that it should never be used, you can start by going on to the Battle of Britain page and insisting they change the title to "Battle of Great Britain".</p>
<p>Oddly enough, you don't appear to have noticed that your favourite term "the United Kingdom" is itself "shorthand", which makes your arguments against other terms on the grounds of "accuracy" all the more absurd. <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeff_Watts_14b9.html" title="User:Jeff Watts">JW</a> 19:01, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have no idea what the initial comment is supposed to mean. Maybe it's an insult, but it's definitely not a valid criticism. I made a <i>constructive</i> amendment to an article to which you made a great contribution. Sure, all Wikipedians should be grateful that you did that, but one can't just claim <a href="../../../o/w/n/Wikipedia%7EOwnership_of_articles_36eb.html" title="Wikipedia:Ownership of articles">ownership</a> of an article. With the exception of the word 'vandalism', I have been perfectly civil; given your subsequent <i>bad faith</i>, in twice undoing my edit and then throwing accusations in return, perhaps I shouldn't make that exception.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Now, actually onto the kernel of the matter. It's good that you realise that changing 'Britain' to 'United Kingdom' does qualitatively change the meaning of the sentence. If it didn't, I wouldn't do it. I don't change them 'as if they have the same meaning'; I change them <i>because you used one of the terms incorrectly</i>. That is to say, <i>precisely because they have different meanings, and you don't know them</i>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Since you so carefully ignored what I have already written, I'll reiterate what is painfully obvious to everyone else (even those with whom I have had this discussion at Wikipedia in the past). 'Britain' is shorthand for several different things, all of which have different meanings and are often confused. 'Britain' is <b>not</b> a real place. It is shorthand for several different real places, but 'Britain' itself is not any of them. Hence, if one took the time to look up <a href="../../../b/r/i/Britain.html" title="Britain">its Wikipedia article</a>, it would produce a fancy disambiguation that directs one to the terms commonly confused with 'Britain'. At no point in the '<a href="../../../b/r/i/Britain.html" title="Britain">Britain</a>' article does it state that 'Britain' is a country, an island, an archipelago, a province of the Roman Empire, or anything <i>other than a commonly misused term and an historical and etymological oddity</i>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The fact that its use is accepted it in informal circles is irrelevant, because it is incorrect in <i>all</i> formal, academic, and official circles. Furthermore, Wikipedia is supposed to <i>disambiguate</i> between commonly confused terms, and, as the page at <a href="../../../b/r/i/Britain.html" title="Britain">Britain</a> suggests, other Wikipedia users have agreed with my position of clarity, not yours of simplicity. Your comment on 'Battle of Britain' is borne out of either ignorance of history (that the term used by Churchill was 'Battle of Britain', as it ought to remain) or ignorance of the problem (that Wikipedia is an encyclopaedia).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Finally, 'United Kingdom' is not shorthand, but an <i>official short version</i>. If you think that it's shorthand, you need to brush up on the Act of Union 1800, which refers to 'Britain' not a single time, 'United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland' just the once, and 'United Kingdom' (without qualification) 24 times. The past 200 years have unambiguously deemed this country to be called the United Kingdom, in formal terms as well as in informal; that's why the Wikipedia article on the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_of_Great_Britain_and_Northern_Ireland_013e.html" title="United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland">United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland</a> redirects to <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>, whereas <a href="../../../b/r/i/Britain.html" title="Britain">Britain</a> produces a disambiguation page, rather than a redirect. If you want to continue to direct users to that disambiguation page for no reason, be prepared for it to be considered vandalism by me and plenty of others beside.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>You have demanded the same explanation of me twice. Now, explain in which way 'Britain' is superior. If you can find one, I advise you to go to <a href="../../../u/n/i/Talk%7EUnited_Kingdom_651d.html" title="Talk:United Kingdom">Talk:United Kingdom</a> and suggest moving the article to <a href="../../../b/r/i/Britain.html" title="Britain">Britain</a>. <a href="../../../b/a/s/User%7EBastin8_Signature_e263.html" title="User:Bastin8/Signature">Bastin</a> 23:08, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As long as the community consensus is that personal userpages <i>by themselves</i> do no harm, my userpage in particular is not one of the main issues concerning Wikimedia. After all, it's not a blog (and I don't advertise the ones for which I have written), a needy MySpace page (I never publish my real name), or a massive drain on Wikimedia's resources. It is an gathering of eclectic scraps of information, which makes the seven letters that appear after my contributions into a human being, without contravening any of the fundamental tenets of Wikipedia.

<p>and the word 'has been appointed' mean he is already apponinted as an ambassador, so he is the ambassador, there is no two ambassador at the same time .</p>

<li>and offical name for the country is Myanmar, not Burma , you should consider writing it again</li>

<dd>It states, "Mr Canning will take up his new appointment in July 2006." I don't know whether his credentials have been accepted, nor do I know the terms of acceptance if they have. However, it is common for credentials to be presented many months after the home government appoints the diplomat, and also common for the conditions of acceptance to stipulate a later date on which the title of 'Ambassador' is conferred (for example, while the diplomat is undergoing language training). Therefore, whilst is it correct that there cannot be two ambassadors at once, that press release does not explain who is the ambassador at the moment. That is why I asked for confirmation from a source other than the FCO. If you have seen another source stating that he is now Ambassador Canning, I'll accept the change. Unless I have confirmation that the new ambassador has taken up the title, it is my usual practice to update the list only when he or she takes up office.</dd>

<p>To start off being perfectly frank, after reading your userpage and the comments here, I admire you enormously. I think you're amazingly intelligent, witty, and have the right ideas about how Wikipedia and the world should be run. That's why I'm here, partly to boost your narcissistic ego, and partly to ask if I might be able to nick a couple of your funnier userboxes. Reason: They're VERY witty, and I believe they have the right idea. Especially the American English, teetotal, grammar Nazi, Python, Carnivore, and evolution ones. I'm not asking to use all of them; just, say, five; with a few modifications. Please? I'm also going to (whether you like it or not) add you to my newly created (in about five minutes in fact) list of Wikipedians I admire. This really isn't going to help that Narcissism, is it? —<a href="../../../v/a/n/User%7EVanderdecken_b54d.html" title="User:Vanderdecken">Vanderdecken</a>∴<b><font color="#007700"><a href="../../../v/a/n/User_talk%7EVanderdecken_d50c.html" title="User talk:Vanderdecken">∫</a><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Vanderdecken_34d8.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Vanderdecken">ξ</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Vanderdecken_9929.html" title="Special:Contributions/Vanderdecken">φ</a></font></b> 18:21, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello Bastin8, My name is J Dogg and I am trying to clean up the Seven Years' War article. My issue is that while you are right about the "United Kingdom" being the correct term that should be used, when refering to the Seven Years' War, the correct term to be used is "Great Britain". This is the term used by all of the books I have read on the Seven Years' War. Some of these books include: "History of Europe Since 1500" by Hayes and Coles (Published in 1956, "Empires at War" by William H. Fowler Jr (published in 2005) and "With Wolfe to Quebec" by Oliver Warner (Published in 1972). (William H. Fowler Jr. is a history professor in the United States.)T hese are just a few of the books that I have read concerning the subject and if requested I could provide a full list of my references. <a href="../../../j/_/d/User%7EJ_Dogg_9038.html" title="User:J Dogg">J Dogg</a> 15:07, 30 June 2006 (UTC)J Dogg</p>
<dl>
<dd>First thing is that 'Great Britain' is not the correct term for wikilinking in the circumstances. The article at Great Britain (quite correctly) is the island, which is not what is being discussed.</dd>
<dd>However, whilst it is <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kingdom_of_Great_Britain_5d2d.html#Name" title="Kingdom of Great Britain">a valid name</a> for the country at the time, I didn't use the term 'United Kingdom' to refer to the Kingdom of Great Britain; if you will review the edit that I made, you'll see that I changed references of actions during the war from 'Britain' to 'Great Britain' and 'England' to 'Kingdom of Great Britain'. Meanwhile, I used the term 'United Kingdom' to refer to the country that experienced the consequences of the Seven Years' War. When referring to the long-term consequences of the Seven Years' War (which last to this day, particularly with regards to the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">True North, Strong and Free</a>), it is unacceptable to refer to 'Great Britain'. In those contexts, 'United Kingdom' ought to be used, since the term is the short version of all three British countries since 1707. <a href="../../../b/a/s/User%7EBastin8_Signature_e263.html" title="User:Bastin8/Signature">Bastin</a> 21:21, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Dear Bastin8,</dd>
<dd>I am truly sorry. Shortly after I wrote you a letter I went back to the page in discussion. I quickly realized that it was not you that had changed the names to "Britain" and "England" but an un named user with an IP address listed. I am sorry for the confusion. As to the wikilinking, I realize my mistake and if you have not undid the linking I will. You are quite correct about the term "United Kingdom" being used to refer to the long-term consequences of the Seven Years' War. I am confused about with this statement however," ...to the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">True North, Strong and Free</a>)..." because, being from Canada, I don't understand why you just didn't say Canada instead of saying True North Strong and Free. Although I do agree that Great Britain is not the correct term.</dd>

<dd>It's no problem. Really, it's my misunderstanding, too; as you can see from previous comments on my talk page, Neanderthals have complained about my pedantry in this area. Hence, when you made an honest mistake, I answered tersely and impolitely, without thinking that you actually have two brain cells to rub together. I apologise for that.</dd>
<dd>I referred to the 'True North, Strong and Free' because I prefer a poetic and complimentary turn of phrase when referring to another person's country. Except France; that, I can't do.

<p>Hey there Bastin8, You seem like a really nice person and I appriciate your reply. I also enjoyed your poetic name for Canada and I am glad to hear that you enjoy my country. Here in Canada we have strong ties to the United Kingdom and the Monarchy. In the news you might have heard that Canadians wanted to part with the Monarchy, but that is only a minority of us.

<p>I know! But do you think we should spell out in full "Great Britain and Northern Ireland" each time we refer to the Olympics team? What we can't do is treat this formula as being the same as "United Kingdom". The different names these antique teams went under are fairly important as they are implicitly being used as a sort of precedent for the argument that a team should be formed in the future. I'll be happy to let you edit the article towards accuracy on the subject of names, or I may correct your criticism myself. --<a href="../../../g/u/i/User%7EGuinnog_5d26.html" title="User:Guinnog">Guinnog</a> 18:10, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The names of the past teams are relatively immaterial (although they ought to be pointed out). No-one argues that there ought to be a team including English, Scottish, and Welsh (but not Northern Irish) players, on the grounds because there was a team <i>called</i> 'Great Britain'. What is important is making sure that one implies the correct nature of the team, as a representative of the whole of the United Kingdom, because that does provide a precedent.</dd>
<dd>Since the teams that played the three friendlies between 1947 and 1965 included Northern Irish players, they did not 'represent Great Britain' in any way, shape, or form. The team was <i>called</i> 'Great Britain', and that is addressed in the relevant section. However, it <i>represented</i> the United Kingdom.</dd>
<dd>Similarly, the team at the Olympics is <i>called</i> 'Great Britain and Northern Ireland', yet it <i>represents</i> the United Kingdom. Hence, if one can't be bothered to write it in full, one should simply write 'United Kingdom', since that is the only option that is correct on either ground.<a href="../../../b/a/s/User%7EBastin8_Signature_e263.html" title="User:Bastin8/Signature">Bastin</a> 18:29, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That page is wrong. The United Kingdom has always taken part as a single country, and only ever used a variation on the country's official name; hence, until 1924 (inclusive), the UK took part under the name 'Great Britain and Ireland', changing only after the Royal and Parliamentary Titles Act 1927.

<dd>Yes. Except that the Irish Free State (i.e. what is now the Republic of Ireland) was not a republic, but a self-governing dominion of the British Empire. King George V remained the Head of State (in the capacity as King of the United Kingdom until 1927, as King of Ireland from 1927 onwards). <a href="../../../b/a/s/User%7EBastin8_Signature_e263.html" title="User:Bastin8/Signature">Bastin</a> 17:40, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Most people have been using it for even those within political parties, considering that they are still successive titles. They just write things like 'Leader of the Conservative Party', etc. But if you don't like that, we can try to set up something else. The point of the templates it to try and avoid more templates and especially seemingly redundant ones. Most other succession boxes across wikipedia are actually running these templates via short links in the code. We tried to remove them all but it was too tedious so just undermining the original code had to do. Suggest to me something and I will see what I can set up.<br />

<dd>I wasn't criticising the fundamental of using the succession boxes for party political positions, but rather their categorisation with s-off (were I to do it now, I'd use s-off, but only out of lack of a better one). Actually, I was just thinking in writing, so I haven't worked out exactly how frequently it would be used. Certainly, for many individuals that held two or more posts, it would be worthwhile: <a href="../../../k/i/m/Kim_Beazley_97c0.html" title="Kim Beazley">Beazley</a>, <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jacques_Chirac_001d.html" title="Jacques Chirac">Chirac</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Dewey_6dcc.html" title="Thomas Dewey">Dewey</a> <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Ewart_Gladstone_b6ab.html" title="William Ewart Gladstone">Gladstone</a>, <a href="../../../a/r/t/Arthur_Henderson_b5e4.html" title="Arthur Henderson">Henderson</a>, <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrew_Jackson_463e.html" title="Andrew Jackson">Jackson</a>, <a href="../../../r/a/m/Ramsay_MacDonald_9a2f.html" title="Ramsay MacDonald">MacDonald</a>, <a href="../../../p/a/d/Paddy_McLogan_2a06.html" title="Paddy McLogan">McLogan</a>, <a href="../../../a/r/t/Arthur_Meighen_f2e1.html" title="Arthur Meighen">Meighen</a>, <a href="../../../l/a/r/Larry_O%27Brien_8f35.html" title="Larry O'Brien">O'Brien</a>, <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrew_Peacock_5f7d.html" title="Andrew Peacock">Peacock</a>, <a href="../../../f/r/a/Franklin_D._Roosevelt_eea3.html" title="Franklin D. Roosevelt">Roosevelt</a>, and hundreds of others around the world.</dd>
<dd>Thus, in the same mould as the other succession boxes, I suggest something like this:

<dd>It may well be ready. Right now, I'm looking through old Luxembourgian newspapers for appropriate photos (!). I think that the only barrier to it becoming an FA would be images.

<dd>I consider this to be a personal attack; accusing an established editor of such a breach of protocol, when there is none (read the first criterion), is insulting in the extreme. Perhaps I flatter myself that you pick me out for a petty squabble (I know that you'd like to think of it that way), but this isn't the first time that we've disagreed, nor will it be the last. Your edits on the article at hand were crude, and it was purely chance that I was the first person to see them.
