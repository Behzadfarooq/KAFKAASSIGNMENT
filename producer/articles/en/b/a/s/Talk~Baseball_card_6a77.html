<p>If you would like to add content on foreign cards, no arguments here. Please do so without refrencing commercial sites and by keeping the content relavent to the overall theme of the article. While there is a market for foreign cards [I own some], the market is very small. As such, they should not be used as the "standard example" of the modern industry. Thank you.<a href="../../../t/e/c/User%7ETecmobowl_41d9.html" title="User:Tecmobowl">Tecmobowl</a> 22:52, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

</ul>
<p>This is ridiculous, yes there is some room for content regarding the foreign production of baseball cards. However, 99.9% of all cards are produced in the US for US distribution. Therefor, it is not appropriate to plaster the page with international information. Again, a small section devoted to the foreign production of cards is fine. This however, is not acceptable, please consider submitting suggestions before an commencing with rewritting of the article sections<a href="../../../t/e/c/User%7ETecmobowl_41d9.html" title="User:Tecmobowl">Tecmobowl</a> 16:11, 11 September 2006 (UTC).</p>
<ul>
<li>I am not plastering the page with international information, I am adding relevant content to the article and through that removing the regional bias in it because baseball cards are not just an American thing, something you would have never thought if you read the version of the article you keep reverting to. Please refrain from vandalizing the article! <a href="../../../t/b/t/User%7ETBTA_143b.html" title="User:TBTA">TBTA</a> 23:43, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>If you would like to, please feel free to add a small section on foreign cards and you can then add your content. It would also be acceptable to add one image of an international card in that section.<a href="../../../t/e/c/User%7ETecmobowl_41d9.html" title="User:Tecmobowl">Tecmobowl</a> 00:00, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Please do not replace images simply to replace images. For the benefit of the article, it woud be best to make sure that cards depicted are easily identifiable to most card novices. Certainly, an image of a foreign card is appropriate for the foreign cards section.<a href="../../../t/e/c/User%7ETecmobowl_41d9.html" title="User:Tecmobowl">Tecmobowl</a> 06:09, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I see no problem with the images. They all seem to be good as of the 16:08, 19 September 2006 revision<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Baseball_card&amp;diff=76603121&amp;oldid=76602920" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Baseball_card&amp;diff=76603121&amp;oldid=76602920" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. The image at the top of the page shows several modern types from all over the world. If this article was American baseball card I think I could see why you think that "foreign" cards would be inappropriate. Considering this is not the American Wikipeida, the foreign cards are needed and even better if they are used to illustrate the design of baseball cards.

</ul>
<ul>
<li>I cannot agree with you at all. I cannot identify a single one of those images. Per my user page, this is the english version of the wiki site and the grammer needs to reflect that. The rewrite is poorly written and there are a number of unsubstantiated facts. Additionally, there are a number of valuable sections that have been removed (the list of type cards for example). I will find better images and correct the mistakes as soon as i have a chance.<a href="../../../t/e/c/User%7ETecmobowl_41d9.html" title="User:Tecmobowl">Tecmobowl</a> 16:56, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I have taken the liberty to add the USA-centric tag to the article, in the hopes of getting a wider global perspective, something TBTA was trying to do with his edit along with those who have followed him. When you use the term "foreign" it shows your bias, since there should be nothing "foreign" in any language's version of Wikipedia.</p>
<ul>
<li>Good point, foreign has been dropped. Per the USA-centric tag, I don't believe you actually read what I contributed as opposed to what I edited. <a href="../../../t/b/t/TBTA_02f5.html" title="TBTA">TBTA</a>'s rewrite was heavily weighted toward card markets that are very very small when compared to the production levels of American cards. I suggested that a section for international cards should be added. I even took this a step further and developed a section where different markets could be appropriately discussed.</li>
</ul>
<p>I feel that the the list of type cards is just <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information" title="WP:NOT">an indiscriminate collection of information</a> and has no point even being in the article. As for your mention of the 1948 Topps "Magic Photos" you just provide a checklist from a commercial site, which somewhat ironic given your history. This site does not give any context for the item and doesn't even say if it is even a baseball card. For all we know it could be some sort of temporary tattoo or some sort of gum product.</p>
<ul>
<li>Type cards are a substantial part of the way people organize their collections and classify them. It is the basis for organization most, if not all, pre-1950 cards from the <a href="../../../a/m/e/Americas.html" title="Americas">Americas</a>. Please note that Americas does not mean just the United States. I believe it should stay and have even substantiated this further in the article. I added an article reference on the Magic Photos, but if you were unsur of it, the <sup class="noprint">[<a href="../../../a/t/t/Wikipedia%7EAttribution_916a.html" title="Wikipedia:Attribution"><i><span title="The material in the vicinity of this tag needs to be fact-checked with the cited source(s)." style="white-space: nowrap;">verification needed</span></i></a>]</sup> tag would have been appropriate.<a href="../../../t/e/c/User%7ETecmobowl_41d9.html" title="User:Tecmobowl">Tecmobowl</a> 03:04, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>You state: <i>Baseball cards are an international item.</i> Yes, this is true and the aticle should reflect this.</p>
<ul>
<li>agreed.<a href="../../../t/e/c/User%7ETecmobowl_41d9.html" title="User:Tecmobowl">Tecmobowl</a> 03:04, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Then you state: <i>However, anyone that collects them would agree that the market is predominately American (see 95% or more). Presenting information that would lead one to believe that is not the case is counter productive.</i> Here you introduce your bias assuming that the article is written for baseball card collectors. The article should not be and if you want to write articles for baseball card collectiors may I suggest <a href="http://www.sportscardpedia.org/index.php/Main_Page" class="external text" title="http://www.sportscardpedia.org/index.php/Main_Page" rel="nofollow">sportscardpedia.org</a>, which is by for and of collectors and not an encylopedia for a general audience as Wikipedia is.</p>
<ul>
<li>I disagree. That has nothing to do with my perspective or bias as you call it. The fact remains that baseball cards are predominately produced, distributed and handled in the United States. To write an article on baseball cards in which most of the displayed images are of no great significance to the industry not good.<a href="../../../t/e/c/User%7ETecmobowl_41d9.html" title="User:Tecmobowl">Tecmobowl</a> 03:04, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>You then claim: <i>[The article has] an unfair bias toward cards not produced in Canada or the United States.</i> How so? The majority of the article deals with American baseball cards. If anything that would reflect a bias towards cards produced in the United States.</p>
<ul>

<p>Finally, you act as if you own the article, which again, is in violation of the <a href="../../../o/w/n/Wikipedia%7EOwnership_of_articles_36eb.html" title="Wikipedia:Ownership of articles">Wikipedia:Ownership of articles</a> policy. I suggest that you review that and the various policies I have mentioned above and take a Wikibreak of a few days to clear your head so we don't wind up having someone take this up on <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_dbd4.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment">Wikipedia:Requests for comments</a>.

<li>Nope, I don't. Much of the edited in information was incorrect. It was removed for that reason. The edit I put in place was not an original work. It was an encyclopedic article with Just get the information right and i won't say a thing. I'll fix this misinformation and hopefully instead of you just overwriting it with other information you will add to and enhance the sections. It is targeted towards people who have an interest in learning more about baseball cards. Stop the anger and just make it better. I don't own the article and in fact most of the information that I used was already in the article or put there by <a href="../../../t/b/t/TBTA_02f5.html" title="TBTA">TBTA</a>. There is an article on wikipedia called <a href="../../../c/i/g/Cigarette_card.html" title="Cigarette card">Cigarette card</a>. Much of the information in this revised version is a direct copy of that article. That article is incorrect. Just make it better guys.<a href="../../../t/e/c/User%7ETecmobowl_41d9.html" title="User:Tecmobowl">Tecmobowl</a> 22:43, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>First off, you should not be posting comments in the middle of someone else's comments. It disrupts the flow of who is saying what and may be thought of as vandalism.</li>
</ul>
<p>No you have a biased idea that the be all and end all of baseball cards is those of the United States, which again reflects the almost defalult bias of Wikipedia to be American centred. I spent a lot of time in the UK and my mother is a Mancunian, so I am ever aware of this bias. I am not angry at you, but I am pointing out a fundamental flaw of the article, it is not written in a global context and it is not written for someone who knows little to nothing about baseball cards.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Of the top of my head, here is what needs to be done</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Have more people giving input on article content, perferably some non-Americans</li>
<li>Internationalize the article.</li>
<li>Split off the history of American baseball cards into a Baseball cards in the United States article and have a brief summary of it on the baseball card page</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>I agree that it's appropriate to include information about any part of the world where baseball is a significant professional sport. NPOV would probably weight this pretty heavily toward the United States and Canada. Baseball has a long and prominent history as a professional sport in these countries, more so than elsewhere, and the best players from Latin America, the Caribbean, and Japan often come to the North American major leagues for better compensation. Although baseball is no longer the most popular sport in the United States, it was dominant there for a long time, and I don't think it ever overshadowed soccer (or to use the non-U.S. term, football) in Latin America. Does this seem like a fair compromise to all involved? <b><a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova"><font color="blue">Durova</font></a></b> 14:44, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
