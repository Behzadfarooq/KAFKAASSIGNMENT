<p>In the anime, the six episodes tell of the awakening of Dark Schneider (also called Darsh or Darshu by those who know him well) and his subsequent attempts to destroy his old allies (The Four Lords of Havoc) and take over the world, whilst winning over multiple love interests. Dark Schneider had been imprisoned fifteen years earlier, trapped inside the body of Yoko's friend Lucien following a failed attempt to take over the world. In the meantime, his four generals attempted to resurrect the god Anthrasax, who would bring about an <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apocalypse.html" title="Apocalypse">apocalypse</a> and create the Sorcerer's Kingdom from the ashes of the old world. The story takes place in the future, a <a href="../../../p/o/s/Post-apocalyptic.html" title="Post-apocalyptic">post-apocalyptic</a> time following the release of Anthrasax at the height of <a href="../../../m/o/d/Modern_Civilization_7ee9.html" title="Modern Civilization">Modern Civilization</a>. Technology is gone and magic has asserted itself as a force in the world. Shortly after the fall of the modern world, demonic creatures began to appear en masse and forced humans to revert to a feudalistic, <a href="../../../c/i/t/City-state.html" title="City-state">city-state</a> based society.</p>

<p>Much like in <a href="../../../b/a/s/Basara_%28manga%29.html" title="Basara (manga)">Basara</a>, another anime, this series was never finished. The two final episodes (which would bring the total to eight) are expected to never be created and/or released. As a result, the story ends on a <a href="../../../c/l/i/Cliffhanger.html" title="Cliffhanger">cliffhanger</a>, unlike in the manga.</p>

<p>The version of Bastard!! released in <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_America_e7c4.html" title="North America">North America</a> differs in a few ways from that released in <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japan.html" title="Japan">Japan</a>. The major differences are the changing of place names. The manga and anime both name places, spells (and some people) after various <a href="../../../h/e/a/Heavy_metal_music.html" title="Heavy metal music">Heavy Metal</a> bands, such as <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metallica.html" title="Metallica">Metallica</a>, <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judas_Priest_a37d.html" title="Judas Priest">Judas Priest</a>, <a href="../../../w/h/i/Whitesnake.html" title="Whitesnake">Whitesnake</a>, and <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anthrax_%28band%29.html" title="Anthrax (band)">Anthrax</a>, and the spells <a href="../../../m/e/g/Megadeth.html" title="Megadeth">Megadeth</a>, <a href="../../../v/e/n/Venom_%28band%29.html" title="Venom (band)">Venom</a> and <a href="../../../h/e/l/Helloween.html" title="Helloween">Helloween</a>. Fearing lawsuits, Pioneer took the Japanese forms of the band names and changed them somewhat when they were put back in English: Megadeth become Megadeath, Helloween became Haro-Wing, Whitesnake became Whiteos-Neiki, and Anthrax became Anslasax. The main city in which the adventure takes place, Meta-Ricana, is actually Metallicana. In addition, there is little swearing in the <a href="../../../d/u/b/Dubbing_%28filmmaking%29.html" title="Dubbing (filmmaking)">dub</a> translation.</p>
<p><a name="Magic" id="Magic"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/s/Bastard%21%21.html" title="Edit section: Magic">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Magic</span></h3>
<p>Magic in the series is used by various people, seemingly anyone can invoke it. Magic appears to have been more common formerly, as spells of the "High Ancient[s]" are often spoken of. Magic is invariably called forth by speaking a spell, which may or may not be actual words of an <i>ancient language</i>. Magic may also be embedded in objects, such as the Sword of <a href="../../../e/f/r/Efreet.html" title="Efreet">Efreet</a>, or by calling upon what appear to be deities. Most characters have spells unique to themselves.</p>
<p>Dark Schneider's signature spell is Venom (爆霊地獄 ベノン <i>benon</i>), which only he knows. It causes the person it is cast upon to liquefy. It goes thus, in the English version:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"Burning in the depths of the pits of darkness,</dd>
<dd>"let the fires of hell take you!</dd>
<dd>"Let the fires become my sword</dd>
<dd>"and strike you down! Venom!"</dd>
</dl>
<p>The most powerful spell in the Bastard!! <a href="../../../u/n/i/Universe.html" title="Universe">universe</a> is Hellion (七鍵守護神 ハーロ・イーン <i>hāro īn</i>, or, in the English translation, Harowing), which is the "forbidden spell of utter and unknown destruction from the ancient days".</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/s/Bastard%21%21.html" title="Edit section: Characters">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Characters</span></h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Tia Noto Yoko</b> (ティア・ノート・ヨーコ <i>tia nōto yōko</i>) - Yoko is the main female role: A mildly lecherous, strong-willed and somewhat temperamental redhead, daughter of the Great Priest (and an <i>80% chaste virgin</i>), self-appointed guardian and friend of Luche. She is the primary love interest of Dark Schneider.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Dark Schneider</b> (ダーク・シュナイダー <i>dāku shunaidā</i> aka Darshu, D・S) / Rushe (ルーシェ・レンレン <i>rūshe renren</i> aka Lucien, Lushe) - Dark Schneider is the most powerful sorcerer in the world, which he almost completely took over before being imprisoned in the body of a little boy by Grand (or Great) Priest Geo. Rushe is soft spoken and had a crush on Yoko, which carried over to Dark Schneider. Rushe and Dark Schneider share the same soul, which means they love what each other loves, but that is where it ends: Dark Schneider can be incredibly evil, heartless and lecherous, whereas Rushe is faithful, quiet and friendly. Dark Schneider is <a href="../../../i/m/m/Immortality.html" title="Immortality">immortal</a> (though whether this is conferred upon Rushe is unclear) - he can resurrect himself through willpower alone. In the English version, he is also called the Mage of Fire, and, in the Japanese, <i>The Exploder Wizard</i>. Whenever Rushe is kissed by Yoko, Dark Schneider is released, and when Dark Schneider is kissed, Rushe is released, and so on, though Dark Schneider can break the seal himself when extremely angry, and he can control Lushe's body at certain times of night (re-gaining his powers for a while in the process).</li>
<li>Side Note: Schneider is German for "Tailor". So his name can be translated as "Dark Tailor", which is appropriate considering how he can seemingly conjure clothing out of nowhere. Dark Schneider's name is a reference to the German metal vocalist <a href="../../../u/d/o/Udo_Dirkschneider_af85.html" title="Udo Dirkschneider">Udo Dirkschneider</a>. The spell that releases D.S., "Accept", is a reference to <a href="../../../a/c/c/Accept.html" title="Accept">Accept</a>, Udo's band.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Ninja Master Gara</b> (ガラ <i>gara</i>) - Gara is a master of <a href="../../../n/i/n/Ninjitsu.html" title="Ninjitsu">Ninjitsu</a>, and at least the third (possibly the fourth) General that Dark Schneider took on. He attempted to slay Dark Schneider, who easily defeated him. Dark Schneider was moved by the boy's impetuous and strong-willed attacks, and so offered to take him on as a servant and fighter. Gara agreed. He commands a sword which can draw its life force directly from the swordsman, allowing almost unbeatable magic attacks. Unfortunately, the strongest attack is usually fatal to use. When he learned Dark Schneider had been re-awoken, he kidnapped Yoko; Dark Schneider became enraged by this and tracked down the Ninja Master, at which point they battled- at the end of the battle Dark Schneider and Gara both lost an arm, prompting Gara to up the stakes by claiming he had intercourse with Yoko; he was hoping it would make Darsh lose his fighting spirit, only to make the wizard horribly angry. It was at this point that Dark Schneider destroyed Gara's base but kept everyone alive, and restored Gara's arm. Gara realized the error of his ways and rejoined Dark Schneider (the first Lord to do so). It is later learned that a favored quote of his is "I have the ire of a man on fire", which he constantly repeats in the later English-released volumes.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Thunder Empress Arshes Nei</b> (アーシェス・ネイ <i>āshesu nei</i>) - A half human, half Dark Elf who was kept as a slave by the Wood Elves, Dark Schneider found her after she was abandoned by her tribe and took rare pity. She became both his <i>daughter</i> and his <i>lover</i>, being apparently similarly immortal (or at least long lived). She was his major confidante and as such is aware of most of the same spells he is. To prove her loyalty to the Four Divine Kings in the manga, she let herself be cursed with the spell <i>Accused</i> by Abigail; in the anime, this compelled her to fight against Dark Schneider whilst her army marched on Meta-Rikana. In the middle of a magical showdown using Helloween, Lucien's spirit made Dark Schneider aware of what was driving his daughter to attack. DS was outraged and tore out his own heart to drive off the power of the Accused spell (later resurrecting himsef). Arshes rejoins him at this point, and they destroy the advancing armies. She was the first Lord of Havoc to join Dark Schneider originally, and the second to rejoin. Her name is based either on the hard rock band Y&amp;T 1983 album <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earthshaker_%28album%29.html" title="Earthshaker (album)">Earthshaker</a> or the Japanese heavy metal band Earthshaker combined with the UK hard rock band <a href="../../../w/h/i/Whitesnake.html" title="Whitesnake">Whitesnake</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hagiwara made notes that the child of a human and a Dark Elf was the most powerful of any human and elf mating, capable of intense magic.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Kall-Su</b> (カル=ス <i>karu su</i>) - Kall-Su was the second general of Dark Schneider; he commands the Ice-Falchion, a great sword, and is innately magically powerful. His past is revealed in the manga, but not in the anime- this was presumably scheduled for episodes five and six. Kall-Su was born in a distant village, his father being an Ice-Dragon in human form. He was feared by the villagers for this, as well as bullied and beaten. He disposed of the bullies through instinctive use of magic, and was condemned to a cave to die. At one point, in shame and fear, his mother attempted to slay him with the Ice-Falchion. Though the blow nearly cleaved Kall-Su's head in half, he slew her, and upon leaving the village, was stopped by a torch-bearing mob. He destroyed the mob with a glance, as well as the entire village, and was left to wander the ruins of the village. Dark Schneider found him, and took him aboard, declaring him a son, but mostly a slave and servant (in the manga, he evidently says <i>You are mine.</i>) He boasts extreme power, and is capable of transforming into an Ice-Dragon at will. He destroys the entire city of Whiteos-Neiki with his spell, Vizkaya, which freezes everyone in the Kingdom into solid ice. He is the last general left standing when the series unexpectedly terminates, and wishes for the apocalypse. It is explained in the manga that he was sexually molested (somehow) by the spirit of Anslasax, and manipulated into hating Dark Schneider, with most of his memories modified. Kall-Su name is a reference to Kal Swan of Lion (band) fame.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Dark Priest Abigail</b> (アビゲイル <i>abigeiru</i>) - Abigail is a bit of an enigma: He is the Fourth Lord of Havoc, and quite powerful. He claims to be the Priest and the Hand of Anslasax, and explains that he has existed since the days of the Old World, and exists to facilitate the resurrection of Anslasax. He curses Arshes with the <i>Accused</i> spell, which forces her to obey him, as if she does not, her body will be destroyed, and she will return as an immortal <a href="../../../t/o/a/Toad.html" title="Toad">toad</a>. Alone of all of the group he is able to take the "three keys" which seal the God of Destruction in sleep, and begin the spell to resurrect her. Abigail is destroyed by Dark Schneider in the end, though he almost succeeds in killing Dark Schneider, Yoko, Arshes and Gara. In the "Requiem of Hell" (a second part of <i>BASTARD!!</i>), he is seen communing with Dark Schneider and his friends, the <i>Samurai</i>. Abigail is a reference to <a href="../../../k/i/n/King_Diamond_4014.html" title="King Diamond">King Diamond</a>'s best selling solo-album, <a href="../../../a/b/i/Abigail_%28album%29.html" title="Abigail (album)">Abigail (album)</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Lars/Rarz</b> (ラーズ <i>rāzu</i>) - Lars is a small blue dragon (Dark Schneider calls the type of animal a <i>Pseudo-Dragon</i>) apparently known to Dark Schneider: he calls himself <i>Rarz</i>, and says he was the <i>Greatest Enemy</i> Dark Schneider had ever faced. Dark Schneider does not dispute this, but does observe he had died and been reincarnated as a Pseudo-Dragon. He shows up as the apparent pet of Gara. In the manga it is revealed that he was known as the 'Dragon Knight', powerful enough to take on whole armies by himself, and the only warrior capable of stopping Dark Schneider's plan of world domination. After the Golen Wars, as that battle was known, Rarz was punished for using the powers of the Dragon Knight before the time (the Dragon Knight was a machine created to defeat the Destruction Goddess, not Dark Schneider), being turned into a little dragon. Rarz is also the brother of Princess Sheila, making him the Prince of Metallicana. Lars' name (Lars Ulu) is a reference to <a href="../../../l/a/r/Lars_Ulrich_e766.html" title="Lars Ulrich">Lars Ulrich</a>, drummer for Metallica.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Bon Jovina/Von Jobina</b> - The unfortunate Captain of the Guard of Meta-Ricana. He is constantly being crushed by enemies, but appears to be quite durable, because he survives being smashed by a Hydra, pummeled by a Minotaur with a giant war hammer, flattened by two walls, and blasted through two walls by the <i>Hurricane Sword</i>. He dislikes Dark Schneider greatly, but is very loyal to the princess. His name is an obvious reference to <a href="../../../b/o/n/Bon_Jovi_6e76.html" title="Bon Jovi">Bon Jovi</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>The Princess Sheila</b> (シーラ 姫 <i>shīra hime</i>) - Princess of Meta-Rikana, she is strong and determined, but only somewhat magically powerful. Sister of Rarz. Sheila has also been taken in by Dark Schneider's charms, even going as far as admitting that she "loves" him.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Geo Noto Sort/Soto</b> - The powerful cleric father of Yoko, he transformed and imprisoned Dark Schneider in the form of Rushe at the end of the Great War which occurred twenty years before the main storyline. His name is a reference to <a href="../../../j/e/f/Jeff_Scott_Soto_439a.html" title="Jeff Scott Soto">Jeff Scott Soto</a> from <a href="../../../r/i/s/Rising_Force_4173.html" title="Rising Force">Rising Force</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Sean Ari</b> - Featured only in the manga, Sean Ari was described by Hagiwara as a war orphan who was probably raised and taught High Ancient Magic by Arshes Nei, employing talismans to aid her and becoming one of the three Sorcerer Generals under Arshes' command. When DS' first resurrection was discovered, Sean Ari was ordered to assassinate him: Disguising herself as a lord's daughter, using her feminine wiles and virgin body, she very nearly succeeded; DS only realized how much trouble he was in when he noticed marks made by armor on Sean Ari's upper body. The lecherous wizard proceeded to seduce Sean Ari, and her loyalties shifted from Arshes to him. (It is interesting to note that whether or not Dark actually took Sean's virginity is up in the air.) Sean's name is a reference to Sean Harris (musician), from the UK heavy metal band <a href="../../../d/i/a/Diamond_Head_%28band%29_250e.html" title="Diamond Head (band)">Diamond Head (band)</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Kai Harn</b> - Featured in the manga and a small role in the anime, Kai Harn is a wizard-warrior, the second Sorcerer General. She is a master of the ancient Hariken style of swordsmanship and forgotten magic, and her magical skill is greater than that of Sean's. Dark Schneider encountered her in a town where the citizens had been turned to stone, at first mistaking her for a boy with a crush on Sean Ari, and proceeded to taunt Kai with misinformation about Sean's virginity. Using a spell that turned humans into statues, the enraged Kai gained the upper hand in their fight and would have killed DS, had Sean Ari not interfered and stalled her long enough for DS to find out the source god of Kai's magic (Yng Wie, obviously a reference to the musician) and overpower it with the power of his patron god, Black More. On the verge of defeat, Kai summoned a cockatrice to petrify both DS and Sean Ari, only to have victory snatched away as she was injured by the cockatrice. Dark Schneider helped "care for" her wound against her protests, seducing and winning her in the process. Her name is a reference to <a href="../../../k/a/i/Kai_Hansen_985e.html" title="Kai Hansen">Kai Hansen</a>, from the German metal band <a href="../../../h/e/l/Helloween.html" title="Helloween">Helloween</a>(but is now with <a href="../../../g/a/m/Gamma_Ray_%28band%29_9e86.html" title="Gamma Ray (band)">Gamma Ray (band)</a>).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Diamond/Di-Amon</b> - The third Sorcerer General, a wizard who turned himself into a vampire before he joined the dark army. He sought the power to overthrow Arshes Nei and Kall-Su by drinking the blood of many virgins. In the anime, Yoko, who was sent to find the absent wizard, was captured by a werewolf working for Di-Amon; in the manga, the werewolf was killed by Dark Schneider as Lucien, prompting Di-Amon to step in and imprison Yoko, Larz, and Lucien. Sean Ari and Kai Harn were also captured, but this was a ruse that lead to a magical battle with Di-Amon. Unfortunately, Di-Amon was very nearly invincible, which lead to Kai being bitten, and Sean would have shared that ordeal, had Yoko not defended her. After a struggle against the seal and Lucien's will, Dark Schneider broke free on his own when Yoko was injured by Di-Amon, and proceeded to defeat the vampire with superior cunning (and egoism). Di-Amon was turned into dust by the light of dawn, then rose as a giant bat, which DS promptly placed under the Accused spell. His name is a reference to <a href="../../../k/i/n/King_Diamond_4014.html" title="King Diamond">King Diamond</a>. Amusingly enough, he is illustrated with King Diamond's typical face painting, and in the original Japanese OVA, Di-Amon speaks imitating King Diamond's unique voice.</li>
</ul>
<p>In later issues of the manga, Di-Amon has reappeared, working his hardest to fight for Dark Schneider, whom he now calls his "beloved master". His nail remains bright blue.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Ung Vwei</b> - there is reference to a god named Ung Vwei, which when spoken in Japanese, sounds like Yngwie. A reference to <a href="../../../y/n/g/Yngwie_Malmsteen_3fbd.html" title="Yngwie Malmsteen">Yngwie Malmsteen</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Two Years Later:</li>
</ul>
<p>After the fall of Meta-Rikana, Kall-Su's forces swept in to capture all the major towns of the kingdoms, becoming the High King of Ice; under his reign, supernatural creatures such as orcs and hobgoblins could roam freely in the day, and his new generals, the Sorcerer Shoguns, enforced heavy taxes that no one could pay. Under the oppression, many lost hope, and the legend of the "Lord of the Fiery Explosion" was nearly forgotten. However, Hagiwara revealed that many people thought to be killed in the explosion of Abigail's defeat were still alive and well: Yoko had become an extremely proficient cleric, and she and Lucien had thrown their lot in with the remaining samurai forces of Aien-Meide/Iron Maiden, who had sworn vengeance for their late sovereign, King Harris, and raised a rebellion to help the people survive. Also among them was Kai Harn, who retains her attraction to Dark Schneider and does not know what to make of the now mature Yoko.</p>
