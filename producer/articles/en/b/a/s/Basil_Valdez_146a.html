	    <p><b>Basil Valdez</b> is one of the Philippines' most captivating balladeers. Though he wasn't formally "retired," he had conspicuously kept a low profile in recent years for a number of personal reasons. That hasn't diminished the stature held by such popular tunes as "Ngayon At Kailanman," "You," "Kahit Ika'y Isang Panaginip Lang," "Sometime, Somewhere," and "Nais Ko." With 10 albums, 20 certified platinum songs, and numerous concerts worldwide to his credit, what he is most proud of his "being able to record songs which are considered classic songs."</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/s/Basil_Valdez_146a.html" title="Edit section: Biography">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Biography</span></h2>
<p>Starting in 1970, Basil embarked on a solo career as, of all things, a folk singer. He mostly performed cover versions of songs by the likes of <a href="../../../j/o/a/Joan_Baez_b724.html" title="Joan Baez">Joan Baez</a> and <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simon_and_Garfunkel_812e.html" title="Simon and Garfunkel">Simon and Garfunkel</a>.</p>
<p>In 1972, he joined the Circus Band, which greatly contributed to increasing his profile. After several years, he and the other band members felt it was time to separate and pursue solo careers.</p>
<p>Soon after, Basil released Ngayon at Kailanman , his first solo album which subsequently catapulted his career to new heights. The memorable title song is one of more than 20 <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Canseco_b70e.html" title="George Canseco">George Canseco</a> compositions that made Basil a pop radio mainstay. He credits Canseco and another popular composer with propelling and solidifying his career.</p>
<p>While in the Circus Band, he encountered a pianist named <a href="../../../r/y/a/Ryan_Cayabyab_c372.html" title="Ryan Cayabyab">Ryan Cayabyab</a>, who was then part of another band. When Basil was preparing tracks for Ngayon , he contacted Cayabyab to donate a few songs, which the composer did. That was the start of a fruitful collaboration which extends up to this day; Cayabyab has been Basil's musical director for the past 27 years. In the 80's, Basil re-invented himself as the undisputed King of Movie Theme Songs.</p>
<p>Among the most memorable were "Paano Ba Ang Mangarap," "Muling Buksan Ang Puso" and "Paraisong Parisukat." In 1985, at the height of his career, when the songs "You" and "Lift Up Your Hands" were blazing the airwaves, a near tragedy stuck, as he was operated on in his kidney, which halted his career.</p>
<p>Having sung for more than 15 years - since the 70's - he felt he wanted to do something else. He began painting and, in a most peculiar move for a popular singer, started teaching. He taught philosophy in <a href="../../../a/t/e/Ateneo.html" title="Ateneo">Ateneo</a> and Religion at Xavier School.</p>
<p>Another circumstance which sidelined his singing career occurred in 1990, when he found himself with an extraordinary, some would say unbelievable, "gift." It started when a friend of his was stricken with whiplash, and was feeling ill for six months. He asked Basil to take a look at his ailment. Basil, with his right hand, held onto the part that was swollen, and after a few moments, his friend was healed.</p>
<p>Confused with this inexplicable predicament, Basil sought the help of <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesuit.html" title="Jesuit">Jesuit</a> friends. They explained to him that what he had was the gift of healing, and people will naturally come to him for help. In a span of 11 years, more than 3,000 patients visited him at his home, in all hours, with an assortment of ailments for him to cure.</p>
