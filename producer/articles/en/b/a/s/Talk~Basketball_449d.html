<dd>Hi, and welcome to Wikipedia! Thank you for your edits and contributions, but on this matter, I disagree. The article is, as it is, overlength — a few months ago I put a lot of effort into ensuring it was at the 32kb recommended limit, a good guideline for article length in my opinion, and I quite simply haven't had the time or effort to keep an eye on it first. I've noticed heaps added to the history section but I don't know enough to know what's significant and what's not.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Nevertheless, I concur with the edits of <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_203.214.91.5_5d35.html" title="Special:Contributions/203.214.91.5">203.214.91.5</a>. The content of that paragraph is not so much to do with an overview of basketball as a game as it is to do with trivia, or more specifically, world records. Close reading of that section indicates more a description of that one game than a contribution to a reader's understanding of basketball.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If it is truly common practice among other sports, then you would do us the honour of showing us where. On <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football_%28soccer%29.html" title="Football (soccer)">football (soccer)</a>, <a href="../../../f/i/e/Field_hockey.html" title="Field hockey">field hockey</a>, <a href="../../../t/e/n/Tennis.html" title="Tennis">tennis</a>, <a href="../../../t/e/a/Team_handball.html" title="Team handball">team handball</a>, <a href="../../../w/a/t/Water_polo.html" title="Water polo">water polo</a>, <a href="../../../c/r/i/Cricket.html" title="Cricket">cricket</a>, <a href="../../../r/u/g/Rugby_union.html" title="Rugby union">rugby union</a>, <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_football.html" title="American football">American football</a>, <a href="../../../n/e/t/Netball.html" title="Netball">netball</a>, <a href="../../../v/o/l/Volleyball.html" title="Volleyball">volleyball</a>, <a href="../../../b/a/d/Badminton.html" title="Badminton">badminton</a>, I couldn't find any mention of attendance records. The only mentions I could find were <a href="../../../i/c/e/Ice_hockey.html" title="Ice hockey">ice hockey</a>, which was added recently by <a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAStudent_37fe.html" title="User:AStudent">User:AStudent</a>, and <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_rules_football.html" title="Australian rules football">Australian rules football</a>, which has a rather extensive discussion on the sport's popularity (as opposed to a trivia on world records).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The purpose of this article, as the main basketball article, is to provide a overview of the sport to give a relatively new enthusiast a good understanding of the sport (more specialised understanding is delegated to more specialised articles). It is therefore important to be selective with information presented. Ultimately, a trivial world record for most people at a match doesn't show the reader anything. If need be done, basketball's popularity is better demonstrated using average turnouts, or some other measure. The trivia does not tell the origins or life story of basketball either.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Thanks again for your edits. In this post I don't mean to imply that the edits are completely worthless — I just mean to say that for this article, this addition doesn't quite fit in.

<p>I've largely simplified the rules section — as I've done on many occasions now — and placed messages requesting editors to be careful here.</p>
<p>My reasoning is this: this article (which was 38 kilobytes long before my edit) can only capture a summary of the game; as some of us know the FIBA rules are a good 80 pages long and of course most rules simply cannot be listed here. To show differences between college, high school, FIBA and NBA, as I have mentioned in <a href="../../../b/a/s/Talk%7EBasketball_archive1_6356.html#Levels_in_Basketball" title="Talk:Basketball/archive1">/archive1#Levels in Basketball</a>, only complicates things — such distinctions are not necessary in this overview. Rules that are technicalities can generally be avoided.</p>
<p>There is a page, <a href="../../../r/u/l/Rules_of_basketball.html" title="Rules of basketball">Rules of basketball</a>, that I created for the rules of basketball. I haven't had any time to edit it at all; and I don't know how much progress it has made, but a more detailed explanation of basketball's rules can be written there. While it can be tempting to clarify and even expand on rules here, I ask that we don't do so.</p>
<p>On this note, I think it would be a good idea to work to reduce this article to about 30 kilobytes. In fact, once it's simplified a bit, it could have a go at featured article status. Please reply. <a href="../../../n/e/o/User%7ENeonumbers_9199.html" title="User:Neonumbers">Neonumbers</a> 05:15, 5 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>I've made a couple minor changes to make the rules section flow better with the limit of FIBA/NBA rules (a good limit, I believe). I'll try to avoid adding anything that's not essential. <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimishag_daa2.html" title="User:Simishag">Simishag</a> 20:40, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Awesome. I just had to reverse the changes to the uniform section (just the part about numbers); I felt it was getting wordy (and we didn't need to go into unambiguousness and language barriers in that much detail). I think the best thing is actually to make sure things are worded concisely, when I think about it. (Thanks for your edits, btw. I know articles are never "owned" by anyone, but I'm inclined to keep an eye on this one because it's happened so many times now.)&#160;:-) <a href="../../../n/e/o/User%7ENeonumbers_9199.html" title="User:Neonumbers">Neonumbers</a> 23:24, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Fair enough. I'd actually even go so far as to say that the specific numbers don't need to be mentioned; the only really crucial point is that every player wears a unique number. But I'll leave it alone for now. <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimishag_daa2.html" title="User:Simishag">Simishag</a> 23:32, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I guess, in a way, this is arguably part of basketball. But I don't think so. Variations aren't "basketball" as such, games like 21 and horse aren't even variations of basketball: they are games invented to practise or use basketball skills. I know I'm treading on dangerous ground here. I ask, however, which "spin-offs" are actually common - I have heard of few, it seems to me that games like 21 and horse are basically a game for children (or adults) who are just playing around. I may well be alone in that little of this merits entry in this article (even if it merits entry in the encyclopedia). I don't refer to the practise of playing 3 on 3 or half-court, et cetera. What are views among editors about this section? <a href="../../../n/e/o/User%7ENeonumbers_9199.html" title="User:Neonumbers">Neonumbers</a> 05:26, 5 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>The current variations section seems way too long. It might actually be worthy of its own article. I think the section here should be limited to really, REALLY common variations on the game. The half-court variation is critically important; in a crowded gym it may be the only option for players. It should be noted that reduced roster sizes are common. However, all that could be covered in a few sentences. Horse is interesting because probably every kid has played it at some point, but I don't think we need to get into every version of 21 and horse, nor every street scoring rule. If you agree, I'll have a go at moving that section into its own article. <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimishag_daa2.html" title="User:Simishag">Simishag</a> 20:38, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I'm right behind you. I actually think "variations" is a misleading name; games like horse aren't really variations, just, well, basketball-skill-related games... can't think of a better name myself though!

<p>Not real sure about the new intro. The original intro was short &amp; sweet and did a decent job of introducing the game. The current one has 2 more long paras that basically just summarize the rules, which is essentially redundant info that's already summarized in the main body.

<p><b>There is a problem with source citing in this article.</b></p>
<p>While the rules and regulations section is properly referenced, the other two sections are not. The history section was written a very long time ago; most users who contributed to this were IP addresses who have probably left or other users who have lost interest. Furthermore, unlike the other sections, this section was written bit by bit, almost sentence by sentence. Given the article in its current form, unless the original authors of this section can be contacted, it is difficult to cite sources, unless the entire section is rewritten with references.</p>
<p>The common techniques and practice section generally didn't have references; these sections were written mostly by people with experience in the sport, who didn't need references to write the sections. While it is good practice to always cite sources, we face a problem here with that.</p>

<p>Do they really change baskets or do they defend the opposite end of the court for the second half. Think of how it looks to someone whos English is poor or has no understanding of the game. I rewrote (badly) the sentence before and I see it's changed back now. It envokes the image of a little centre court ceremony at half time where the teams exchange baskets.

<dl>
<dd>That's a fair point; my opinion is that that wording is fine.</dd>
<dd>The teams "own" a basket, namely the one they defend. They attack their opponents' basket. "<i>Teams shall exchange baskets for the second half</i>" is the exact wording from the FIBA rulebook, 2004.</dd>
<dd>The reason I chose that wording (if it was me... can't remember) is because it was concise — I have a concern with article size and I have tried, especially in the rules section, to get to the point as quickly as possible without over-elaboration. (It wasn't because that's how it's worded in the rulebook, it just gave me a nice wording.)</dd>
<dd>I think it's fine, but if there's a better way that doesn't increase the length of the sentence (much) then I'll stick with it. <a href="../../../n/e/o/User%7ENeonumbers_9199.html" title="User:Neonumbers">Neonumbers</a> 03:15, 21 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>"exchanging" goals at the end of a period is a well-known concept in <i>many</i> sports; non-english speakers understand soccer and hockey games perfectly well. "swap" or "switch" might be better but if the FIBA rulebook says "exchange" I think that's fine. <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimishag_daa2.html" title="User:Simishag">Simishag</a> 03:31, 21 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>It was a bit longer after I changed it and I can't think of a short way to say it. All I can think of is "Teams defend the opposite end of the court in the second half." The rule book is written for those that understand the basic rules. It's probably a minor point and I'm not really sure that anyone would mistake it. <a href="../../../c/a/m/User%7ECambridgeBayWeather_aa30.html" title="User:CambridgeBayWeather">CambridgeBayWeather</a> <a href="../../../c/a/m/User_talk%7ECambridgeBayWeather_e92a.html" title="User talk:CambridgeBayWeather">(Talk)</a> 03:33, 21 December 2005 (UTC)

<p>On a somewhat related matter, under American rules (NBA, NCAA, etc.), a team's basket is the one it attacks, not defends. This is probably because there is no designated goalkeeper in basketball. In practice, of course, this distinction would only occur in discussions among officials, and most spectators in North America or abroad would probably be unaware of it. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 71.131.243.115 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_71.131.243.115_015d.html" title="Special:Contributions/71.131.243.115">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

<dl>
<dd>I was taught that a cut is made in order to receive a good pass? Hence, a cut may be made right through the keyhole, if the defenders are poorly concentrated, or there is some open space on the other side — and, a cut isn't much use if you cut into the keyhole where all the tall guys are and you've got no space. <a href="http://www.hickoksports.com/glossary/gbasketball.shtml#ctop" class="external text" title="http://www.hickoksports.com/glossary/gbasketball.shtml#ctop" rel="nofollow">This page</a> says its to elude a defender or find an open space... which in a more general sense is to find an advantageous position... correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm fairly certain on this.

<dd>I think the best place to discuss this is on <strong class="selflink">Talk:Basketball</strong> rather than here. The glossary you linked actually looks like a pretty good reference to link into the page. I don't want to get too pedantic about it, but my experience with the term "cut" suggests that it is a move <i>toward</i> the basket. The cutter is trying to break down the defense and is looking to take a shot immediately after receiving the ball. I've heard lots of sportscasters use "cut in" and "cut to/towards the basket" but never "cut outside" (I've heard "break out/outside" a few times). It's not just a move into space to receive a pass; the goal is to shed or beat the defender(s) and take a shot. <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimishag_daa2.html" title="User:Simishag">Simishag</a> 06:46, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Talking in the absolute sense about how the "grace" of the game as the reason the game is popular sounds like POV. In fact, is anyone really sure why people like what they do? No other major sports article on wikipedia has a statement like this, so I altered it:</p>

<dd>Hi, and welcome along. I understand your concerns (that sentence has been edited before) — I believe some slack should be cut here. This is not a controversial issue; there is not an issue with proponents and opponents like there is with, for example, <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intelligent_design.html" title="Intelligent design">intelligent design</a>.</dd>

<dd>After thinking about it, I changed the sentence to "Basketball is a popular spectator sport". It's not referenced yet, but I don't think anyone could dispute it (most of this article is unreferenced and I'm sure figures could be found to support it). Reasons for it, perhaps, are diving into unverifiability. So, I guess I see your point.

<p>I've changed the stament "even though it was an American game" to "North American game". Some may not agree, but Canada played a strong part in the origins of Basketball. The inventor of the game was Canadian, 10 of the players that played the first basketball game were Canadian, the game was played a lot in the early years in Canada, and the first NBA game was played in Canada with a Canadian team playing. By refering to it exclusively as an American game I feel it does not give credit to these facts (can be referenced from NBA.com's history section, or many other sources).</p>

<dd>Disagree. The reader should get an immediate look at a <i>game</i> of basketball being played from a normal spectator's viewing angle. The current image meets that, and also reflects the international nature of the game, the fact that women's teams are prominent and that the game is widely viewed and played in stadiums. I agree that the image is blurry and could stand to be replaced. Personally I think an image of an NBA game would be better due to the quality of the league and its influence on the sport. Your suggested image has some aesthetic qualities but that doesn't make it appropriate for the lead. I do not think a pickup game or someone practicing is acceptable. <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimishag_daa2.html" title="User:Simishag">Simishag</a> 23:42, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Good points all -- perhaps I'm just of the few that associate baskeball more as a backyard sport than a business, maybe that's why the alternative resonates more with me. Looking around at some of the professional NBA photos that are used as fair use on Wikipedia, I still think we can do better than the title image currently featured. Another option to consider is the simple currently at <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_football.html" title="American football">American football</a>. --<a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuasipalm_6524.html" title="User:Quasipalm">Quasipalm</a> 02:15, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually, no, I'm not the one who added the image. If you check that edit, you'll notice the image was moved from the bottom of the page to the top; the purpose of that was to balance the images throughout the article (the current image was in the "see also section", the old title image is now in the "college" section.) Please do not imply that I am responsible for the image; I assumed it was worthy of being on the article because it was already there.</dd>
<dd>That all said, I don't necessarily think that the current image is ideal, and am happy to see it changed. For me, any photo that is of a high-level (professional or international) game of basketball, that has a good (spectator) view, will do — but personally, I prefer an international (men's or women's) game over NBA/professional (NBA does have significant influence, no doubt about it, but as the lead image I'd prefer one that shows international-ness.) <a href="../../../n/e/o/User%7ENeonumbers_9199.html" title="User:Neonumbers">Neonumbers</a> 06:30, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Why are there no NBA photos - is it fair use issues?

<p>Edit summary, just in case anyone's wondering why I made those edits (primarily for those whom I haven't met before). Objections should be posted below and discussed first.</p>
<p>Please, people, because of space restrictions, not college rules here! A more detailed summary of rules and regulations should go on <a href="../../../r/u/l/Rules_of_basketball.html" title="Rules of basketball">rules of basketball</a>. For this overview of the subject, FIBA and NBA rules are by far the most relevant to the <i>world</i> as a whole. This was explained earlier, scroll up to the other "Rules and regulations" section.</p>
<p>"team personal fouls" is incorrect, the correct term is "team fouls".</p>
<p>FIBA rules dictate that a men's ball circumference is between 749 and 780 millimetres, and that a women's ball circumference is between 724 and 737 mm. These have medians of 76.45 and 73.05 cm respectively, which I rounded to two significant figures and converted to inches. Arguably, it could be necessary to have "76 centimetres (30 in)" rather than "30 inches (76 cm)" but I haven't done this.</p>
<p>"These rules are designed to reward good defense." -- it is not immediately obvious why these rules exist, and each of the time limits (except maybe 3 seconds) is intended to reward defense.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous details were also removed. My intention is to keep this article as brief as it possibly can — within 31 kilobytes — while covering what needs to be known by a beginning enthusiast. <a href="../../../n/e/o/User%7ENeonumbers_9199.html" title="User:Neonumbers">Neonumbers</a> 12:44, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I would disagree that college rules should be entirely excluded. In the U.S., which of course has more basketball fans and players than any other country, college basketball is at least as popular as the NBA and probably more so. I wouldn't be surprised if, considering basketball's status as a major sport in the U.S., there was more interest in NCAA basketball than in all FIBA-rules basketball combined. -- <a href="../../../m/w/a/User%7EMwalcoff_a391.html" title="User:Mwalcoff">Mwalcoff</a> 23:12, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>At the risk of sounding cliché, basketball is an international sport — if I remember correctly, the most popular indoor sport. And, let's be fair, most people outside the U.S. care about the NBA, but not about college. And, of course, the article is written for everyone, not just Americans.</dd>
<dd>College basketball rules are welcome to go on <a href="../../../r/u/l/Rules_of_basketball.html" title="Rules of basketball">rules of basketball</a> because they are a significant part of basketball. However, the rules section is to be short and to the point, and the only true differences little technicalities, like the 24/35-second clock, free throw administration, time-outs — things which are the same in principle but different in detail, that is, things that really aren't worth going on for ages about when you're providing a summary.</dd>
<dd>My point is that I'm not trying to exclude college basketball outright — I'm just trying to be realistic with space and the patience of the reader, who cares more about the principles than the differences between leagues. Yeah, college basketball's big, but I'm still convinced the NBA is bigger and FIBA rules are played worldwide. The reader who wants picky details goes to <a href="../../../r/u/l/Rules_of_basketball.html" title="Rules of basketball">rules of basketball</a> to find out — not here. <a href="../../../n/e/o/User%7ENeonumbers_9199.html" title="User:Neonumbers">Neonumbers</a> 11:26, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The article before said that the NBA foul limit was four.... which was, clearly and obviously, simply wrong. I changed it to 6; the correct number.<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_123_08df.html" title="User:Daniel 123">Dan</a> 22:02, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The context of the paragraph seems to be with regard to team fouls ("in the penalty") for a quarter - not the limit for individuals in a game, which is mentioned later in the paragraph. I can't seem to recal the exact number before they start shooting free throws - will verify that it's four before reverting. <a href="../../../k/u/r/User%7EKuru_b024.html" title="User:Kuru"><font color="#CD853F"><b>Kuru</b></font></a> <a href="../../../k/u/r/User_talk%7EKuru_f68a.html" title="User talk:Kuru"><font color="#F5DEB3"><sup><i>talk</i></sup></font></a> 22:29, 20 August 2006 (UTC)

<p>The history section's getting rather long, with all sorts of additions in recent weeks. I expect there is heaps and heaps more to say on the history of basketball, and, like the rules — perhaps more so than the <a href="../../../r/u/l/Rules_of_basketball.html" title="Rules of basketball">rules of basketball</a> — this merits its own article.</p>
<p>I don't know much about the history of basketball and I really don't have time at this point to do anything about it. But if anyone's interested, knows something about the subject, or has time to do anything about it, I encourage them to create history of basketball, link to it from this article, and delegate any other additions to the history section here to there.</p>
<p>On creation of the history of basketball page, a good target for its length on this page is about 9.5 kilobytes. (At present, it is about 12.8 kilobytes.)</p>
<p>Perhaps one day, if no-one else does, I'll find the time, but if anyone's interested, there's an idea. <a href="../../../n/e/o/User%7ENeonumbers_9199.html" title="User:Neonumbers">Neonumbers</a> 05:55, 22 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Also in the History of Basketball Section: "Interestingly basketball and netball are the only ball games which have been identified as being invented by North Americans." Where's this come from? It doesn't ring true. Any sources? What about <a href="../../../l/a/c/Lacrosse.html" title="Lacrosse">Lacrosse</a>? The wikipedia article on it says "The sport was invented by Native North Americans." Or <a href="../../../w/a/l/Wallyball.html" title="Wallyball">Wallyball</a>? And this doesn't put in any qualification for "popular" or "major" sports. Surely there are hundreds of ball-sports invented by North Americans? I didn't want to just change it, because I hardly know anything about sports or basketball, but it doesn't sound right to me. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 70.39.98.79 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_70.39.98.79_92ef.html" title="Special:Contributions/70.39.98.79">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

<p>The US team again has failed to win the world title, even though they should have the best players. Is this due to different tactics that are used in international games vs. NBA?

<dd>Well, to be fair, the NBA is very international now -- Pau Gassol, Dirk Nowitski, Yao Ming, Steve Nash (he's Canadian), and many more wouldn't be playing for the US team. See this <a href="http://www.nba.com/players/international_player_directory.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nba.com/players/international_player_directory.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> list of international NBA players. It's a pretty big list. I did notice Dwayne Wade was on the US team, but I haven't actually seen any of the action on TV (UK bball coverage sucks).</dd>
<dd>Having said that, the NBA rules have always put a lot of emphasis on man-on-man defense, quick possessions, and recent rule changes have shifted that emphasis further still. For example, there is now a 3-second defensive violation, and also illegal defense (I believe that's double-teaming an offensive player without the ball). International rules, I believe, are much more flexible on the type of defensive formations allowed. The centre <i>can</i> simply stand under his ring all day long, if he wanted to. You <i>could</i> have 3 guys mark Shaq for an entire game.</dd>
<dd>I'd like to see this addition, but I'm not 100% certain of my characterisation of the rule differences, and actually, the article at the moment seems to be including the most common, bare essential rules that define the game. Perhaps a section on differences between national leagues (I'm sure the Australian league differs slightly from the Chinese league from the NBA from the etc etc) and international rules would be informative. I will try to spend some time looking up some references. <a href="../../../t/e/z/User%7ETezh_cdc5.html" title="User:Tezh">Tez</a> 14:13, 1 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks for the explanation. I agree the article lists the major differences in rules, but I didn't see how they affected the tactics. Your three lines above have made it a lot clearer.

<dd>Oh, and further (for those interested), there is a zone in the key, right under the basket, where an offensive player may charge into a defensive player without being called for a foul in the NBA (and this is certainly absent from every other non-NBA game I've seen). The threshold for the amount of contact before the ref blows his whistle in the NBA is now very low (eg. you can't put you open palm on a player anymore, even if you're just doing so to gauge and maintain a good defensive distance). Also, the amount of carrying (where the hand is technically beneath the ball while dribbling) and travelling that NBA players get away with is pretty atrocious.</dd>
<dd>Of course, all this is my own charaterisation and opinion. Again, I will endevour to look for some rulebook links, or something more instructive, <i>but I ain't guaranteeing anything</i>! <a href="../../../t/e/z/User%7ETezh_cdc5.html" title="User:Tezh">Tez</a> 15:02, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Shooting fouls and free throws</p>
<ul>
<li>If a fouled shooter misses his shot but not because of the foul, the basket will not count, but he/she will get two or three free throws.</li>
<li>If a missed shot was because of the foul, the basket will count and there will be two or three free throws.</li>
<li>The same rules (the basket plus one free throw) will apply if the shot was still made, however if the shot was made because of the foul, only the free throw will count.</li>
<li>Free throws may not be cancelled at any time.</li>
<li>If a shooting foul was committed in the last 2 minutes of a quarter, the scores will be switched around if the fouling team is ahead, and then any baskets and free throws will be awarded to the new leaders.</li>

<p>Fouling out</p>
<ul>
<li>If a player fouls out, he must shoot four free throws into his own basket before leaving the court. Anyone on the same team who interferes with the throws will also foul out and have to shoot four free throws as well. If an opponent interferes with the throws, they will get 100 points per second.</li>
<li>If two players from a team foul out, the game will then be forfeited.</li>

<p><i>"In early December 1891, Dr. James Naismith, a Canadian physician of McGill University and minister on the faculty of a college for YMCA professionals (today, Springfield College) in Springfield, Massachusetts, USA, sought a vigorous indoor game to keep his students occupied and at proper levels of fitness during the long New England winters."</i></p>

<p>The English article states that Naismith was inspired by the medieval game <a href="../../../d/u/c/Duck_on_a_Rock_2059.html" title="Duck on a Rock">Duck on a Rock</a>. However, the <a href="../../../../fr/b/a/s/Basket-ball.html" class="extiw" title="fr:Basket-ball">French article</a> speaks of Naismith being inspired by "an old Maya ballgame", the <a href="../../../m/e/s/Mesoamerican_ballgame.html" title="Mesoamerican ballgame">Mesoamerican ballgame</a>. Is any of them unfounded? Are they both only theories? The Duck on a Rock article already presents it as an hypothesis. If so, it should be mentioned, explained. --<a href="../../../l/i/b/User%7ELiberlogos_df62.html" title="User:Liberlogos">Liberlogos</a> 07:20, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, the Duck on a Rock statement from this article is referenced, and the one on the French article isn't...</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>That said, the Duck-on-a-Rock thing is a rather recent thing and whether it has backing by most historians is probably another story... It is, however, founded on his "handwritten diaries". The French article doesn't seem to mention a similar sort of backing (then again, my French isn't that great).</dd>

<dd>This article (as far as I'm aware) isn't really watched by anyone who knows what they're talking about (I don't really know what I'm talking about), but you can visit the page listed in note 1 if you want to see where we got the Duck on a Rock thing. <a href="../../../n/e/o/User%7ENeonumbers_9199.html" title="User:Neonumbers">Neonumbers</a> 09:49, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In the section "History", paragraph three, it is stated when the first official basketball game was played. Then this statement follows: "'Basket ball', the name suggested by one of Naismith's students, was popular from the beginning." Was the name indeed suggested around the time of the first official game? If not, should this statement possibly be moved to an earlier paragraph? There could be some confusion as to when the name "basket ball" was suggested.

<p>Though he was born in Canada and adapted rules from a Canadian childhood game, James Naismith was an American and stayed in the US -- getting a medical degree in THE US, working in THE US, and serving in the US MILITARY. Therefore, he was not a 'Canadian physician from McGill' for two reasons: number one, that is irrelevant, if true. Number two, he wasn't a physician, he got his medical degree in the US many years later. All of his jobs listed were held in the US. The only reference to McGill that makes sense is the Doctorate degree from McGill. HOWEVER, Google shows that it was an HONORARY doctorate, which means that the only Canadian reference after he moved to Springfield, MA, is an honorary degree, which means even that wasn't completed in Canada (it's an honorary degree, there are no classes to attend.)</p>
<p>To recap: Any information about where he went to college should be in his own page, not basketball's. And, he was not a Canadian physician. He just had a four year degree at the time he moved to the US, so how could he be a physician. He went to medical school in the US many years later, living all over the US, as well as served in the Kansas (US) state military. Therefore, he's not a Canadian Physician from McGill but a Canadian-born college graduate from McGill, which has nothing to do with Basketball, so I omitted it from the Basketball page.</p>
<p>I moved the new discovery reported in ESPN to the next page, and mentioned that he was born in Canada, in that same paragraph, for comprehension. The way it was right now, saying Naismith was a Canadian Physician from McGill who happened to be working at the YMCA is incorrect. It's actually more correct to say he was an American Physician from Colorado, US who invented Basketball, because that's where he went to medical school and he was an American, but Canadian born. But even that is not accurate (nor relevant) because he wasn't actually a physician at the time, NOR is what he is known for. So even if you mention the exact school he went to, that is irrelevant because he is not KNOWN for being a physician, nor was he a physician when he invented it (it was many years later.) <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Volleyball123 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Volleyball123_edba.html" title="Special:Contributions/Volleyball123">contribs</a>) 04:02, 15 February 2007 (UTC).</small></p>

<dd>Naismith's mother and her parents came to Canada from Scotland in 1852, and his father arrived (also from Scotland) in 1853. Naismith was born in Canada, which would make him Canadian. He did not become a naturalized American citizen until 1925, in order to fulfil a requirement of his military service. That event occurred <b>34 years</b> after he invented basketball. You cannot retroactively declare him to be an American in 1891, plus you haven't indicated whether or not he retained dual citizenship after 1925. In short, before making what is a fairly significant change to commonly understood details about his life, you should probably discuss them here first and get some feedback. --<b><a href="../../../c/k/a/User%7ECkatz_0c62.html" title="User:Ckatz">Ckatz</a></b><i><small><sup><a href="../../../c/k/a/User_talk%7ECkatz_91bf.html" title="User talk:Ckatz"><font color="green">chat</font></a></sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ckatz_cb51.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ckatz"><font color="red">spy</font></a></sub></small></i> 05:30, 15 February 2007 (UTC) (info sourced from the <a href="http://www.naismithmuseum.com/naismith_drjamesnaismith/main_drjamesnaismith.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.naismithmuseum.com/naismith_drjamesnaismith/main_drjamesnaismith.htm" rel="nofollow">Naismith Museum</a>)</dd>

<p>Volleyball123 14:04, 17 February 2007 (UTC)I was not arguing that he is not Canadian or from McGill. The point is that the mcGill reference is still unnecessary and irrelevant (nothing to do or relating to basketball of physical education.) It is also not true that he was a Canadian physician. If you move to the US and invent basketball at 30, are you automatically a Canadian physician from McGill? No--he was not a physician. The way the article reads right now, Naismith was a doctor from Canada who received a medical degree from McGill who then invented Basketball while in the US. That is not correct. If you get a medical degree from UConn but you went to Harvard for undergraduate, it is misleading to say you are a physician from Harvard (plus unnecessary to mention the college name except for those alumni from that college.) The only college on that page that should even be mentioned is Springfield College. Next year, his high school will want representation at the top of the basketball page, too. Why Springfield College? Because that is where it was invented. What was? Basketball. It's a page about basketball, not James life history. Plus he got a degree from four places, not just McGill. To repeat, there is no way "a Canadian physician from McGill" is accurate or necessary to the Basketball article.</p>
<p>A lot of Canadians think the sport was invented IN Canada. Literally. Saying Canadian-born would clarify to everybody that he was born in Canada, but give hint that it was only as a child. He lived in the US almost his entire life, and that's where he invented basketball. I can't believe you can't see how the statement "a Canadian physician from McGill" is accurate or necessary to the Basketball article in any way. Plus, since he was an American SOLDIER (keyword American and keyword Soldier), it makes no sense to say Candian when you can say "Canadian-born" instead. It is more accurate.</p>
<p>Right now, the article has a heavy Canadian slant. And, the McGill reference has no reason to be there. Springfield College earned the right to be there. It's an article about Basketball. The way it is right now, anybody who glances at the Basketball page will think that Naismith was born in Canada, became a physician in Canada, and had nothing to do with the US except inventing it in Springfield. And, that the McGill reference is more important than the YMCA reference. This is an article about BASKETBALL. The first line is extremely unreadable.</p>
<p>Plus, not only was Springfield College the birthplace of basketball, but that's where Naismith got his physical education degree. He got a philosophy degree from McGill. Completely irrelevant to the basketball article! He also got a medical degree from Colorado, why not mention that? It would be more accurate to say he's a physician from University of Colorado than physician from McGill.</p>

<dd>I'll leave the rest of your changes to see what others think. However, I have replaced the word "Canadian" as it accurately describes Mr. Naismith, and is supported by references throughout the article (including the one you used.) Further to this, I think it is stretching things to claim that the article has <i>"a heavy Canadian slant"</i> - either in the previous version or as it is now written. There are currently only six references to Canada, including a mention of the sport spreading throughout the U.S. and Canada; examples of players from nations other than the U.S.; and that the first NBA game was played in Toronto. --<b><a href="../../../c/k/a/User%7ECkatz_0c62.html" title="User:Ckatz">Ckatz</a></b><i><small><sup><a href="../../../c/k/a/User_talk%7ECkatz_91bf.html" title="User talk:Ckatz"><font color="green">chat</font></a></sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ckatz_cb51.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ckatz"><font color="red">spy</font></a></sub></small></i> 18:29, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Volleyball123 12:07, 20 February 2007 (UTC) It is much easier to read and understand the first sentence right now. The introductory sentence is no longer three lines long. And, it no longer states that Naismith was a physician or minister at the time, in "December of 1891." Nationality-wise, he's 100% scottish, though, as his parents were from Scotland and he was born 10 years after his parents moved to Canada, and after 30 years, he seems to have resided in the US for the rest of life. Should we say Scottish-Canadian&#160;? There is a page on Wikipedia about scottish-canadians. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish-Canadian" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish-Canadian" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish-Canadian</a></p>
