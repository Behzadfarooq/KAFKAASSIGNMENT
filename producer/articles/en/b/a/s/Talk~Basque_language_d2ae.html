<p>The section on higher-level connections is not precise, and the way it is written, it may sound biased as well. First, I'd like to comment on the sentences used, then I'd like to suggest some corrections:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i><b>Many scholars have tried to link Basque to Etruscan, African languages, Caucasian languages and so on.</b></i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Well, this is a style used by children. We should either list no proposed languages or all of them.</p>
<dl>
<dd><i><b>A connection with the Iberian language gave some hope, but it is unclear whether similarities are due to genetic relations or mere vicinity.</b></i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Any claim should be backed up with references. Moreover, the language isn't neutral ("gave some hope", "mere vicinity").</p>
<dl>
<dd><i><b>The Caucasian hypothesis is widespread in Georgia as a link between Basques and Georgians, but there is little evidence to support it. (See Caucasian Iberia.) One of the few practical consequences is that the former mayor of Bilbao José María Gorordo made the city and the Georgian capital Tbilisi twin cities, and Euskal Telebista (Basque Television) co-produced a version of Don Quixote with Georgian Television.</b></i></dd>

<p>This is not precise either. The hypothesis should be called "Kartvelian" (or "Georgian", at least), since "Caucasian languages" is an areal bundle of three distinct genealogical groups considered unrelated (actually, the hypothesis linking the Northeast Caucasian with Northwest Caucasian, or either of the two with Kartvelian/South Caucasian is just as controversial as linking Basque to Georgian or any other language family in many linguists' opinions).</p>
<p>So, although this is an interesting piece of information, it is by no means more valuable than others that are missing.</p>

<p>Again, this is not precise. Caucasian languages should be rewritten as North Caucasian (or Northeast and Northwest Caucasian at least) to avoid ambiguity and confusion with the above-mentioned Kartvelian/Georgian hypothesis.</p>
<p>In addition, <i>This superfamily would also include the North American family of Na-Dené languages.</i> is a sentence that immediately manipulates the reader into an impression that the Dene-Caucasian hypothesis is obscure itself. I think we all agree that judging hypotheses should be up to the readers. At least, an article on Basque is not a place to inform of a details about a different matter.</p>
<p>So, why is only <i>Na-Dene</i> mentioned? To be balanced, we should either list all the proposed branches (like Northeast Caucasian, Northwest Caucasian, Burushaski, Yeniseian, Sino-Tibetan and Na-Dene) or none at all, leaving it wholly up to the reader.</p>

</dl>
<p>The impossibility to link Basque with its Indoeuropean neighbours in Europe made many scholars to search its possible relatives elsewhere. Besides many pseudoscientific comparisons, the appearance of long-range linguistics gave rise to several attempts at connecting Basque with geographically very distant language families. While the link with the ancestor of Basque, the ancient Acquitanian language, was proven beyond reasonable doubt by Michelena and Trask, other hypotheses are considered controversial and the suggested evidence is believed to be as yet undecisive.</p>

<p>The Georgian hypothesis, linking Basque to South Caucasian or Kartvelian languages, is widespread in Georgia. One of the few practical consequences is that the former mayor of Bilbao José María Gorordo made the city and the Georgian capital Tbilisi twin cities, and Euskal Telebista (Basque Television) co-produced a version of Don Quixote with Georgian Television. Despite its popularity, there is little evidence to support it.</p>

<p>Besides Kartvelian, Basque has been unsuccessfuly compared with many other Nostratic language families, among them Altaic, Uralic, Indoeuropean, Dravidian and even Eskimo-Aleut. None of these attempts have succeeded in proving such link.</p>

<p>Several scholars (Trombetti, Bouda, Bengtson, Blažek) have independently proposed a connection with the other two Caucasian families, Northwest and especially Northeast Caucasian. John D. Bengtson and Václav Blažek have proposed the so-called Macro-Caucasian hypothesis, suggesting a closer link with Burushaski, Northeast Caucasian and Northwest Caucasian, and, in accord with earlier findings of Sapir, Shaffer and S. A. Starostin, consider them all a part of the Dene-Caucasian macrofamily. Although this is one of the most elaborate theories, based on both typological (such as ergativity) and historical-comparative (phonological correspondences, lexical parallels, morphological similarities) evidence, it has not gained wider acceptance among the traditionalist, who consider the evidence as yet undecisive. The question of the affinity of Basque thus remains open.</p>

<dd>It's not very clear what you mean by "maintains relation to the stone age". Basque is like most languages, it has a very long history but has undergone many changes throughout that history. It surely does preserve some words that are thousands of years old, but then, so does English and so do most languages.

<p>Answer: Standard Galician has seven vowels (it distinguishes between <i>"closed" e</i> and <i>"open" e</i>, and between <i>"closed" o</i> and <i>"open" o</i>. Nevertheless, some Galician-speakers use more vowels in their speech (in the Ancares mountains, the nasal vowels haven't dissappeared yet), and many Galician-speakers (especially new-speakers, snobs, TV and radio hosts) don't make any difference between "closed" vowels and "open" vowels. Sardinian is a romanica language with merely 5 vowels. Hence, Dante wrote that Sardinians speak like monkeys imitating humans. --Yerrux</p>

<p>I have trouble understanding this sentence. "in this instance a null case 0 equates to the " nork ", which in most European languages would be the subject. " What does a "null case 0" mean? It seems that it has something to do with "nothing", but I don't understand exactly what that should be, maybe someone with a knowledge of Basque grammar could rewrite this, so it would be clearer and easier to understand...</p>

<p>I have reverted the Latin cases to accusative. As far as I know, the form of Latin words when they become Spanish (and probably other Romance languages) come from the erosion of the accusative, not from nominative. I guess that it is the same for Basque. Hence <i>flos</i> (N), <i>florem</i> (Ac) becomes <i>flor</i>, <i>fleur</i>, <i>fiore</i>, <i>lore</i>, <i>flower</i>. --<a href="../../../e/r/r/User%7EError_ca98.html" title="User:Error">Error</a> 00:58, 19 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This is an interesting idea to me. I speak Italian and used to teach Latin. I have long assumed [perhaps wrongly]that Italian used the ablative case. Most examples that come to mind would work by eroding the accusative too: of course 2nd &amp; 4th declension u's not surprisingly would show up as o's in Italian [e.g. spiritu[m]=spirito]. But if there is a neuter 3rd declension noun whose accusative is the same as the nominative, then it's interesting indeed. What comes to mind is nomen with Italian nome; but then what about genus which in Italian is genere?</dd>

<dd>The Sante Fe Institute is well-respected...for its speculative research in complex adaptive systems. This is not the Institute's area of expertise. Basque is considered a language isolate by the majority of linguists. The entry should reflect that consensus view, and the minority opinions should be noted in passing.</dd>
<dd>I think we need to reach a conclusion on the classification, because Basque language is often mentioned as an example of a <a href="../../../l/a/n/Language_isolate.html" title="Language isolate">language isolate</a>.

<dd>Yes, yes and yes! The Dene-Caucasian superfamily is a myth. <b>M - Y - T - H</b>&#160;!!!!!! The similarities in structure are the consequences of mere coincidence. The Basque, Caucasian and Dene peoples have been seperated from each other for myriads of years. All the same, why don't we unite the Turkic languages and Quechua in one superphylum?

<dd>The "pop garbage" includes the work of the late Larry Trask, who was both a respected historical linguist and one of the world's leading authorities on Basque. As for "linguistic sites", the Santa Fe Institute is not one, and in any case the presence of two sites claiming living relatives for Basque doesn't change the fact that the great majority of linguists don't agree. 67.101.96.244 17:54, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Majority has nothing to do with truth. What was the majority's opinion on the Earth and the Sun and their position in the Solar system 500 years ago? Was it really the correct one? What counts is the evidence. Larry Trask, a respected Vasconist, can't have avoided certain mistakes. The argument that the geographical distance between Na-Dene and Basque is too large is very weak. Just look at the other language families and macro-families. The Basque izolationism has much more to do with politics than linguistics.</dd>
<dd>I also wonder why there's a mention of Georgian-Basque connections. Georgian is a Kartvelian language and belongs to the Nostratic macro-family. "Caucasian hypothesis" is about Vasco-North Caucasian comparisons.</dd>
<dd>Now, the evidence: I won't give you all the comparisons here (visit the Dene-Caucasian article where it's all going to be presented soon), but (1) regular (recurrent) sound correspondences have been found (including some non-trivial ones), (2) morphological correspondences have been found, (3) hundreds of cognates (based on (1)) have been found, including those that belong to the stablest ones, as far as semantics is concerned, which IS a strong argument against look-alikes and chance resemblances</dd>
<dd>Larry Trask's search for internal explanations and Latin/Germanic/Celtic etc. loans was by all means legitimate, but if Irish and Hindi are related (what's the geographical distance between them?), why not search for Basque's relatives in the same distance? Typologically (although typology may have little to do with genealogy), some clues pointed to the Caucasus, so the choice wasn't arbitrary. Larry Trask often used what we know as "folk etymology", just because he didn't compare the forms to their possible cognates outside Basque. Nobody says the D-C hypothesis is perfect. It's far too young and innocent. But there's no point in rejecting it just because a few (out of hundreds!) of the etymologies may have other explanations (and not neccessarily better!).--Pet'usek 18:07, 18 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>During the days when I was closer to linguistics than I am now, I often heard stories about how difficult a language Basque is. I've added a reference to "The Devil Wanted to Learn Basque" to the external references section. Could someone who's more familiar with the language add a description to the article on the relative complexity of Basque as compared with other languages, if you think it's appropriate? <a href="../../../w/a/i/User%7EWaitak_08e1.html" title="User:Waitak">Waitak</a> 07:01, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The issue of the difficulty of learning a language is often best approached in relative terms, both with respect to the L1 (mother tongue) of the learner and to two different L2 (target languages). Thus, "English speakers find it easier to learn Spanish than Romanian," would be a good way to compare. The problem with making statements about absolute difficulty--"Chinese is hard to learn"--is that for all human languages, children master the phonology and grammar around the age of 4-5. This is hard to reconcile with any notion of major absolute differences. Also, such absolute statements obscure the importance of L1. For a Cantonese speaker, learning Mandarin isn't all that hard, certainly easier than it is for an English speaker.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>You mentioned "relative complexity" but I think "relative distance" would be a better approach. I think that a strong case can be made that Spanish grammar is more complex than Hindi, certainly for the verbs (more forms, more irreguarlities). Despite this, English speakers find it much easier to attain a given level of fluency in Spanish than they do in Hindi because the distance, especially in terms of vocabulary, is less for English-Spanish than for English-Hindi.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>For English speakers, certainly Basque is going to be harder to learn than Romance or Germanic languages and quite likely harder than for any Indo-European languages. It's possible that, for example, speakers of Quechua or the Mayan languages might find learning Basque easier than learning English. Why? They use polypersonal verbal constructions like Basque. Also, the Mayan languages are ergative-absolutive not nominative-accusative.<a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInterlingua_47a8.html" title="User:Interlingua">Interlingua</a> 04:08, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<hr />
<p>Basque is also said to be hard to learn by basque people. Even nowadays for all the existing different basque dialects even kids study basque verbs and correct grammar (rarely used in street live then). It is usually hard even for native basque speakers sometimes to know the correct verb and sometimes even the correct word. Been basque such and old language makes it difficult to even use commonly used words for, for example ballpen. The word in basque exists but it has been made up by the regulating organization, and most people just use a local dialect word or the spanish word (boligrafo or just boli). And that's just an example. Discussions happend when deciding a word for a cell phone (mobile phone) which ended in "mugikorra" which just means mobile and nowadays everyone uses it. Just an example to show some of the problematica due to the quite recent creation of the unified basque.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Claims of this sort are often made for many languages, and confuse the idea of <b>learning a language</b> (which almost all human infants do effortlessly) with <b>learning a standard variety of a language</b>. The difficulty of the latter depends on many factors, including the degree of divergence of one's native dialect from the standard, the frequency with which the standard is encountered, and the status of the standard. This status itself has many components, including its prestige within the community, whether it is regarded by the community as favouring one group, whether there are more cosmopolitan (or more prestigious) other languages in competition with it, and so on. <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColinFine_20a8.html" title="User:ColinFine">ColinFine</a> 22:01, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>For people whose maternal (only) language is Spanish (or French), Basque is as difficult as for speakers of any other language, it doesn't matter much if they are born in the conventional geographic boundaries of the Basque Country. Most of the vocabulary is totally different and the grammar, while very logical in most cases, is complex enough to make it relatively difficult. For Spanish-speakers is much easier to learn Catalan or French or even English than Basque, that's clear.</dd>
<dd>Aditionally, while you can submerge youself in other languages (for instance if you're learning Finnish you may spend some time in Finland), getting submerged in Basque is not that easy, as even where Basque is dominant, everybody knows either Spanish or French or both and, in the end, people switch to them too easily.</dd>
<dd>Personally I have only felt "forced" to use Basque with one Basque monolingual in the Pyrenees and when crossing to the North (as my French is quite worse than my Basque). Some people do favor using Basque with bad speakers as myself but most just prefer to switch languages in benefit of immediate communication but in detriment of Basque conservation. --<a href="../../../s/u/g/User%7ESugaar_6002.html" title="User:Sugaar">Sugaar</a> 23:44, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I dindn't read the entire text,it seems like western-dialect or so, but it's very near to standardized basque (euskara batua). Nowadays it's not usual to find texts written in non-standardized basque, but remember that euskara batua only exists since some decades ago. Before that, people used to write as they spoke. The <i>j</i>s are usually read as <i>y</i>, that's why <i>y</i>s are used in this example. In all modern published texts, <i>y</i> only exists as a letter for foreign words. Well, when writing to my friends I write in our dialect and I may use some <i>y</i>s, but it's definitely non-standard.&#160;;) <a href="../../../k/e/t/User%7EKeta_890b.html" title="User:Keta">Keta</a> 15:18, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Numbers say most kids enroll in the D model, that is THEY STUDY IN BASQUE. Which doesn't mean they use it in the street. The % of kids enrolled in the D model is even rising (even if there is starting to be some inmigrants at schools). So definetly not dying. These numbers vary through provinces been Gipuzkoa the most pro D model then Bizkaia and then Araba. The numbers I am talking about are the overall in the basque country autonomous community.</dd>

<dd>The problem is when you grow older only 47% of the university majors can be studied in basque, you make the math. Not everyone wants to study in basque and even if you want to you only have 47% the oportunity to do so. OLAIA 2006/08/26</dd>

<p>In the Western Basque Country is NOW official and protected and as Olaia says, teached in schools regularly with most children (their parents, I guess) chosing the Basque D model, as it is the one that makes sure that your children learn good Basque, even if at home or in the town the main language is Spanish.</p>
<p>But in Navarre and the North the situation is very different. In the North Basque has near to zero official presence and only recently a few decorative changes have been made under pressure from EU cultural watchdogs. The lack of any form of self-government doesn't help at all, naturally. Still some 40% of the people does speak it.</p>
<p>In Navarre there's the situation graphically defined as <i>Napartheid</i>, with a bilingual "Basque-speaking" area where Basque is considered almost in parity with Spanish, a "mixed" strip where Basque has only limited rights and a "non-Basque" area that comprises most of the territory, where the situation is as pitiful as in the North legally. Only some 20% of Navarrese can speak Basque as per 2001, what is highly ironic for the language of Navarre.</p>
<p>Some municipalities are trying to get into the "mixed" or "Basque-speaking" area, so their children can access public schooling in Basque, yet the Navarrese goverment (pro-Spanish right wing) always puts all kind of obstacles.</p>
<p>But, while officiality could help, what most handicaps Basque is that everyone is bilingual and that knowledege of Spanish or French is not just compulsory but also necessary for most bussiness. If you can't go to the city and buy or work in Basque, as normally happens... in he end your only motivation is affective. So, in the end, I, a quite mediocre Basque speaker, probably will only use Basque when travelling to the North (as my Basque is much better than my French), meeting one of those isolated monolingual farmers or falling in the middle of a conversation in Basque.</p>
<p>While many Catalans have pushed for daily usage of Catalan by keeping talking in Catalan when replied in Spanish, Basques normally don't do that but rather switch to Spanish or French. --<a href="../../../s/u/g/User%7ESugaar_6002.html" title="User:Sugaar">Sugaar</a> 23:42, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>What is the report on the number of Basque speakers who have limited Spanish or French?

<dd>I could say I have only met basque speakers with limited Spanish in old people living in farms (Baserriak). Must know that spanish is an official language and the spanish constitution says every spanish citizen has the right AND THE OBLIGATION of knowing spanish (even if there are inmigrants that know shit), so there is no way a kid doesn't get it at school. Maybe he/she doesn't use it at home or with friends (spanish) but definetly must learn it at school and plus at schools they don't really teach spanish as a language but more the spanish literature and stuff. Plus it is a fact that if you don't limit you tv channels to ONE, you watch spanish TV, and if you go to the movies more than onces in a year, you watch movies in spanish.</dd>

<dd>So I would definetly say it is extremely difficult to find someone with limited Spanish. Another point is we usually (basque people) make mistakes in spanish, but not due to lack of knowledge more to just the use, just the way Andalusian's (south spain) make mistakes in spanish.

<p>This section was recently much elaborated, but I think these edits have done more harm than good. The problem is that the section devotes too much space to fringe / pseudoscientific theories of Basque language origins. For example, of the Dené-Caucasian connection it is said that the hypothesis is "perhaps the only one supported by some knowledgeable historical linguists". Well, if the others aren't supported by any knowledgeable historical linguists, why are they listed here in the first place - especially as the section lacks references? Most of these should be outright deleted, or if the information is to be kept, then it should go to a separate article like "Theories of Basque language origins" or something similar. But speculations that are uniformly rejected by specialists are hardly worth including in a broad-scope general article on the language. --<a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnte_Aikio_9bb9.html" title="User:Ante Aikio">AAikio</a> 13:08, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You're right, of course. My aim was to reach some consensus (I have nothing against the idea of making a separate article for the theories) and to avoid hurting somebody's pride&#160;:-). And, I didn't write this sentence: ""perhaps the only one supported by some knowledgeable historical linguists". I don't know who did. I will gladly delete it.</dd>
<dd>It has been repeated many times that the Dene-Caucasian (or Macro-Caucasian) hypothesis is the most promising of the theories, but it hasn't been explained why this can be so: (1) regular phonological correspondences (including the very important non-trivial ones) have been proposed, (2) almost 250 potential lexical cognates have been found so far (majority of which belong to the stablest semantic cathegories), (3) common grammatical morphemes have been identified (see the Talk page of the DC languages), (4) typological features seem to be an indirect (which should be stressed) evidence of an old (be it areal or genetic) bond with the Caucasus.</dd>
<dd>I added some references (I'm not sure how to format them in the Wiki markup language). Since the DC theory is (if I am not mistaken) the only one that gives some references, I don't mind deleting the others, which seem to lack them. Anyway, I have nothing against replacing the whole section with a brief mention of the individual theories. The DC article is growing constantly and the Basque section is being worked on at the moment. So, it is quite unnecessary to include any long passages here.</dd>
<dd>What if we replace the section with a sentence of the type: <i>"There have been many attempts at linking Basque with other languages and language families, such as..."</i> (list of the names of the theories and links to the individual articles dealing with them) <i>"..., but the majority of linguists still consider the Basque language to be a language isolate, unrelated to any other language or language family."</i>. Or something like that?</dd>
<dd>Oh, and, in order to save some space here, in the Talk section, <b>I will delete my old proposal for the new version of the section mentioned above + the Old talks of the Basque's affinities, ok?</b> Anyone can look in the history of the Talk section or send me an email. I saved the discussions in a file if somebody wants them.</dd>
<dd>All in all, I think making a separate article will be the best option indeed. Really. Thanks for any comments and criticisms. What should be the title of the separate article? So the talks can be inserted in the Talk section there, once the article is created.</dd>

<dd>In my understanding of the matter, most of the theories are roughly valid. The case for Iberian was largely dropped for lack of clear evidence but when reading some Iberian texts one can't help having the impression that they sound somehow lik Basque and seem to share terms and the like.</dd>
<dd>Georgian is probably the less valid nowadays. It is with NE Caucasian languages, like Chechen, that the link is made. NE Caucasian languages and Georgian have no clear link and are actually postulated as hypothetical members of different super-families. The comments on the brothership between Bilbao and Tiblisi are just frivolous and should be removed.</dd>
<dd>Dene-Caucasian is based in the link with NE Caucasian, what seems the most suggestive hypothesis in itself.</dd>
<dd>Vasconic theory is pretty good actually and explains many things that otherwise have no explanation. As the related article on <a href="../../../p/r/e/Pre-Indo-European_a0f8.html" title="Pre-Indo-European">pre-Indo-European</a> says, not all pre-IE substrate has to be Basque, specially in the Mediterranean, but there is a good ground for this theory.</dd>
<dd>In my opinion, I'd reformat the section in a more comprised space, without separate titles for the different hypothesis. I'd mention Iberian. But would only mention Georgian as entry to pass to NW Caucasian. I'd ignore the extremely hypothetical Dene-Caucasian proposal (more proper of other articles surely, as Basque has ever been directly related, even in tentative manner, with any Sino-Tibetan or Na-Dene language) and go directly into Vasconic substratum theory.</dd>
<dd>In fact Vasconic languages theory must surely be mentioned as something growing in credibility and based in the findings, not just of linguistics, but with good archeological and genetical backing - and compatible with possible Caucasian and even Iberian links.</dd>
<dd>Not sure how to do that but while NW Caucasian and Iberian (and maybe even Georgian, but I'd like to see a source for that) deserve a mention, these would be better presented as apreritiff to the growing paradigm of Vasconic-Paleolitic substratum.</dd>
<dd>In any case, no separate sections but just paragraphs and links. Three or four paragraphs would do, making justice to these theories and cleaning up the section a little bit.

<dd>Basically, what can be said about Basque from the genetic perspective? You can be almost perfectly sure, where Basque comes from, but you still have two choices:</dd>
<dd>1/ judging from the dominant R1b lineage in Basque males, it can be a descendant of the Cro-Magnon language from Central Asia. Hence its closest relatives are Burushaski (descendant of R2?), and then Paleoindian languages in Siberia (Ket, Nivkhi, Yukaghir, Eskymo-Aleut) and Amerind languages. However, the relationship with some Caucasian languages can't be excluded, because during the last ice age R1b was present in the Caucasus as well.</dd>
<dd>2/ Judging from the dominance of H-lineage in Basque females, it can be a descendant of the Gravettian language from Asia Minor. The Gravettian mammoth hunters (Y-haplogroup I) brought mtDNA haplogroup H to Europe 28 000 years ago. We shouldn't forget that Gravettian culture was present in today's France and the dominance of R1b can be a genetic drift that can't tell anything certain about the ethnic composition of the population that gave rise to modern Basques. If this theory is true, then Basque can be very, very distantly related to Etruscan (J2).</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>But this all is even more confusing, when we take into consideration the unresolved origin of Indo-European languages. If they come from today's Ukraine, they would be of Cro-Magnon origin (R1a1) and hence the most closely related languages to Basque (which doesn't seem too probable). If they came from Asia Minor, they could be distantly related to either Etruscan or perhaps to some Caucasian languages. Again, they could be related to Basque, if Basque came from Asia Minor.

<dd>Nah. It really seems another of those far fetched <i>amateur guesses</i> based in a list of words with wrong (twisted, opportunistic) meanings. For example:
<ul>
<li><i>Ama</i> is mother, mun in Basque, not goddess (except by extesion). Ama is also mother in many other languages. In fact it seems quasi-universal (with some variants, like amma, mamma, mum, etc.).</li>
<li><i>Lur</i> is not dirt but earth, soil</li>
<li><i>Kuraia</i> is courage, but it is an obvious loanword</li>
<li><i>Jaso</i> is to bear not "to get better"</li>
<li><i>Etapa</i> is a Spanish loanword</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>Many are composite words, like <i>tontordun</i>, derivate from <i>tontor</i> (point, promontory) or <i>sukor</i>, derivate from <i>su</i> (fire).</dd>
<dd>Many others are just far fetched comparisons:
<ul>
<li><i>yasumi</i> (to rest) - <i>jaso</i> (to bear, to support)</li>
<li><i>kema (leg, foot) -</i> kemen <i>(vigour, strength)</i></li>
<li><i>oka</i> (man) - <i>oka egin</i> (to eat in excess)</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>A couple of them could pass the test maybe (aske-esku, for instance) but they are not enough to build up any minimally solid theory.</dd>
<dd>Aditionally the words are arbitrarily selected, they have no system: where are the numbers?, the basic words like fire or water?</dd>
<dd>The Berber theory was something like this one, maybe a little better.</dd>
<dd>Still some phonetic simmilarities may be found between Japanese (don't know enough about Ainu) and Basque, but 'P' and 'F' (very rare sounds/letters in Basque actually) are not among them.</dd>

<p><b>lack of "v" sound (replaced by "b")</b></p>
<p>It is highly questionable if it is really due to Basque influence. Remember that Sardinian language considered to be the closest romance language to Latin even today, does NOT have a bilabial V sound either, only B. Plus, bilabial V sound has never existged in Latin either. So I don't think it is Basque influence in Spanish. 80.85.50.28 16:49, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Not sure where you got that idea that Sardinian is closest to Latin in its original form. Sardinian seems the only Romance without direct Basque influence that also shows another "Vascoid" trait: only 5 vowels.</dd>
<dd>Notice that Romances do not derive directly from classical Latin but from <a href="../../../v/u/l/Vulgar_Latin_f200.html" title="Vulgar Latin">Vulgar Latin</a>, which ignored declensions and had a lot of other modifications like pronouncing "v" as consonant:</dd>
</dl>
<blockquote>
<p><i>The former semivowels written in Latin as V as in vinum, pronounced /w/, and I as in iocunda, pronounced /j/, came to be pronounced /v/ and /dʒ/, respectively</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<dl>
<dd>There are exceptions to this rule obviously but, apart of odd and isolated Sardinian all are in the fringes of the Basque speaking area (Spanish, Gascon, Aragonese), the same that happens with the reduction of the 7 vowels of "standard" Vulgar Latin to the 5 of Spanish, Gascon, Aragonese and Western Catalan dialects. Plus other clearly Basque-influenced modifications like the initial F&gt;H transformation (<i>fablar</i>&gt;<i>hablar</i>) or the differentiation between two aceptions of "to be" (1. to exist, to have qualities; 2. to be in/on/at, to stay), natural in Basque and also normal in Basque-influenced Romances (only). --<a href="../../../s/u/g/User%7ESugaar_6002.html" title="User:Sugaar">Sugaar</a> 02:13, 28 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The two forms of "to be" in Romance languages have existed since Latin: most of them came from <i>esse</i> and <i>stare</i>. Also, Romanian features the same pair of copulas, though one is derived from <i>fiere</i> instead of <i>esse</i>, and there's no Basque influence there. <a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESupadawg_20b8.html" title="User:Supadawg">Supadawg</a> (<a href="../../../s/u/p/User_talk%7ESupadawg_408a.html" title="User talk:Supadawg">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Supadawg_7e3c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Supadawg">contribs</a>) 20:15, 29 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment:</b> Also "stay" exists in English (sometimes can be used as alternative to "be in/on/at") but no Romance I know of (maybe Romanian?) makes such a radical distinction between the two verbs except Basque-influenced ones, it seems.

<dd>The difference does exist in Catalan, Italian, and Portuguese (see <a href="../../../r/o/m/Romance_copula.html" title="Romance copula">Romance copula</a>). As for French, the difference did exist until the two verbs merged through phonetic change. By the way, which languages are you referring to by "Basque-influenced ones"?

<p>I also heard that some linguists consider this F&gt;H transformation a normal insider transformation, as similar transformations happened also to several other languages regardless of their origin. The most particular is, e.g., the S&gt;H transformation in Greek and other Eastern languages, that also happened in Spanish in some words: Latin BASSUS &gt; Spanish BAJO [báxo], Latin SAPO &gt; Spanish JABÓN [xawón], etc. so maybe the initial F&gt;H transformation is just another insider and proper evolution form.<br />
Another good example could be the modern Greek language, that has almost EXACTLY the same fonetical system that Castillian Spanish, however, modern Greek has nothing to do with Spanish neither with other romance languages, nor with Basque influence. If you listen to Greek speech, it sounds like Castillian Spanish, but you will not understand the words. Fonetics are almost exactly the same with the same particularities. (Aspirated and week [d] and [g] like in Spanish, the [s] is alveolar but not dental, closer to English "sh", like in Spanish, the original Ancient Greek B is pronounced V, you can also find the English "th" sound like in Castillian Spanish spelled Z or C before E and I, the [x] sound like the one spelled in Spanish as J, etc.)<br />
Besides, don't forget that Basque as a minority language has also been influenced by the Romance languages surrounded during its long history, and this influence may be larger than the substrate Basque had in Spanish and other languages. The main problem is that we don't know if basque language in its original form had or didn't have the F and H consonants, and in modern Basque dialects H is also mude like in Spanish, but it DOES have F!<br />

<dd>We do know that Latin loans have lost <i>f-</i>. <i><a href="../../../f/i/c/Ficus.html" title="Ficus">ficus</a></i> → <i>piku</i>, <i><a href="../../../f/a/g/Fagus.html" title="Fagus">fagus</a></i> → <i>pagu</i>. However I do not remember cases of Latin <i>f-</i> → Basque <i>h-</i> as in Castilian and Gascon. I read somewhere of some Basque scholar with an alternative explanation for some of the coincidences, but could not find it again. If you can provide a reference to an alternative explanation mention it in the article. --<a href="../../../e/r/r/User%7EError_ca98.html" title="User:Error">Error</a> 03:42, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have just found the following article section in the classical Latin Wikipedia, it is worth to read:</dd>
<dd><a href="http://la.wikipedia.org/wiki/H_%28littera%29#H_venit_a_littera_.22F.22" class="external text" title="http://la.wikipedia.org/wiki/H_%28littera%29#H_venit_a_littera_.22F.22" rel="nofollow">H venit a littera F</a> (H which comes from letter F).</dd>
<dd>I don't know if you speak Latin; the article explains that some latin words beginning with H had F in their oldest forms, like HOSTIA and HOSTIS. If it is true, the basque influence in Spanish can be questionated again. —Zoltan</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The transformation rule is different but the aversion for the letter "f", specially at the beginning of word, is the same one.</dd>
<dd>Whatever the case, it is Spanish scholars who defend the Basque influence in the formation of Castilian language, and explain on it its unusual "dynamism" that makes it evolve faster and more innovatively than other Ibero-Romance languages that have remained somewhat closer to Vulgar Latin. --<a href="../../../s/u/g/User%7ESugaar_6002.html" title="User:Sugaar">Sugaar</a> 09:31, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Let me tell you that my native language is Hungarian, and maybe it sounds funny, but I have found some definitive common characteristics that would make people consider Basque to be an Uralic language (as Hungarian and Finnish). Let's see some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>In both languages (Basque and Hungarian) the plural mark is a -k.
<ul>
<li>B: euskaldun, euskaldunak / H: baszk, baszkok; B: mendi, mendiek, mendiekin / H: hegy, hegyek, hegyeket [hedj, hedjek, hedjeket]</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There are some words that sound similar.
<ul>
<li>B: bake / H: béke [be:ke]</li>
<li>B: hiru / H: három [ha:rom]</li>
<li>B: zortzi / H: nyolc [njolts]</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Besides, there are some similarities in the morphology and sintaxis, too. Zoltan 88.209.204.157 21:35, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>This is total nonsense. These kinds of random similarities are absolutely irrelevant in comparative linguistics, and they do not indicate any historical connection between these languages: they're just due to chance.

<p>I've restored the section. Even if these comments can be considered far-fetched there's no reason to delete content from a talk page. If you wanted to delete your comments you should rather use <s>strike-through text</s> (&lt;s&gt;text&lt;/s&gt;). Or just make a further comment retracting.</p>
<p>Personally I have read on this before and there seems to be very little to connect. Nevertheless I am also skeptic of coincidences and when there is some more than annecdotic connection, even if the languages are clearly not related, the hypothesis of substrate or distant indirect connection can well be explored, rather than just pretending that "Basque is Uralic".</p>
<p>Hungarian is said to be the more "Turkic" among Uralic languages, whatever the reason, and I have also found the odd connection with Turk (<i>aita-ata</i>, for instance). While it's obviously not enough to get anything consistent, the data should not be just ignored. After all proto-Basques, must have come from Asia at some point in prehistory (c. 35,000 BCE probably) and also one can think in other pan-European (see <a href="../../../v/a/s/Vasconic_languages.html" title="Vasconic languages">Vasconic languages</a> or Neolithic substrates (iri/iru/uri-ili/ilu-urbs-ilion-iri-uri for town/city for instance). All very hypotehtical but... who knows?</p>

Hello Im Basque/Spanish young man but in fact my euskara is not as good as I´d like. Anyway, I can tell by now that the song you have linked here its just a basque version of the famous dragon ball Z opening theme, broadcast some years ago in the ETB - Euskal Telebista. The author of the song refers to a man (goku) that begins this journey across the planet (banoa banoa... im leaving...) and... well... you know, I´will talk with some friends of mine in order to provide you a decent traslation. See you.</p>

<p>I read somewhere that Spanish overall stress and pitch is based on the Basque one (as Spanish as a separate language seems to be born in a former Basque speaking area in La Rioja). Is this correct? if so, it may be interesting to note it in the article. <a href="../../../m/o/u/User%7EMountolive_175f.html" title="User:Mountolive">Mountolive</a> | <a href="../../../m/o/u/User_talk%7EMountolive_3eea.html" title="User talk:Mountolive">Talk</a> 02:25, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The Basque stress varies regionally, so it would be difficult to decide. --<a href="../../../e/r/r/User%7EError_ca98.html" title="User:Error">Error</a> 00:24, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
