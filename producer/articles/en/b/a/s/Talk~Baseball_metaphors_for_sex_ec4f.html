<p>This should not redirect to <a href="../../../b/a/s/Baseball_euphemism.html" title="Baseball euphemism">Baseball euphemism</a>, as a metaphor is not the same as a euphamism, and baseball metaphors are much broader and more widely applicable than the more specific and explicitly sexual baseball euphamism.

<p>Who put the citations thing there? As I know, euphamisms that have existed in common knowledge for generations don't usually have an easy-to-find source. Look it up yourself, instead of sticking up a box and making it everyone else's problem.</p>

<p>I agree with the changing to "euphemism" By no means are these metaphors. Also, 1/2 of these are made up, guys.</p>

<p>Can an expert of these metaphors remove those that are never used? There are way too many elements in the list like if someone wanted to make a metaphor with every single baseball term. <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanjth_35fe.html" title="User:Canjth">Canjth</a> 13:57, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>This is just like those lists of "100 Things to Do in Wal-Mart", it's supposed to be funny. Does it belong on Wikipedia? Maybe, I have no probelm with it, infact I printed off a copy to show my buddies.</p>
<p>I think that noting that some of them were created simply for comedic effect (rather than actually being common slang or euphemisms) will suffice. <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustin_Eiler_f9c0.html" title="User:Justin Eiler">Justin Eiler</a> 17:29, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Elements that are made up should not be on a Wikipedia page, period. This article cannot be both a serious encyclocpedic entry on the topic and a comedy riff on it. Maybe some of these made-up terms would work out well at <a href="http://uncyclopedia.org/wiki/Main_Page" class="external text" title="http://uncyclopedia.org/wiki/Main_Page" rel="nofollow">Uncyclopedia</a>. But why are we leaving them here? I'm inclined to move a whole bunch of them to the talk page at the very least, but since I'm new to this page, I'll hang back and see if anyone makes a case for leaving them in. --<a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikkiTikkiTavi_aec1.html" title="User:WikkiTikkiTavi">WikkiTikkiTavi</a> 04:12, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Regarding the recent adding the "needing an expert tag", I don't think someone can be an "expert" on baseball metaphors for sex. It should be either removed, or replaced with an alternate tag. <a href="../../../u/n/d/User%7EUnDeRsCoRe_0e72.html" title="User:UnDeRsCoRe">UnDeRsCoRe</a> 01:48, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Well I mean that someone who knows which ones are actually used and the ones that are entirely made up should come and delete the ones that are never user. There are too many elements in the list. It's like if someone wanted to make a metaphor with every single baseball term. I know it is not really an "expert" but it's the best tag possible. <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanjth_35fe.html" title="User:Canjth">Canjth</a> 02:24, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>True, I understand now. Also though, most of these are fake and are not actually real. Clean up? <a href="../../../u/n/d/User%7EUnDeRsCoRe_0e72.html" title="User:UnDeRsCoRe">UnDeRsCoRe</a> 02:35, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yeah, cleanup is necessary and go ahead if you want to change the</dd>
<dd>expert needing tag by a cleanup tag. I think cleanup should begin by eliminating all the euphemisms below rain delay (they look ridiculous...) and should continue as we would get opinions from other people. <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanjth_35fe.html" title="User:Canjth">Canjth</a> 21:31, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I concur with the flow of discussion here, but I respectfully suggest that the problem goes beyond mere cleanup to more fundamental questions about the encyclopedic nature of the article and the importance of the topic. I want to be respectful of the individual(s) who've worked on this page, but I suggest nominating the page for deletion entirely. --<a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikkiTikkiTavi_aec1.html" title="User:WikkiTikkiTavi">WikkiTikkiTavi</a> 17:47, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No. Baseball metaphors for sex are an important part of English language culture in North America and Wikipedia needs an article about it. I suggest, as a compromise, to remove all metaphors except the "traditional" four bases. What do you think of that? <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanjth_35fe.html" title="User:Canjth">Canjth</a> 21:39, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree that removing all but the traditional four bases would be a big help and quite possibly salvage the article, if sources can be found for what remains. Do you think that the assertions about the traditional four bases can indeed be properly <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">verified</a>?

Go ahead if you want to remove all the metaphors except the traditional four bases.

<p>Since no one has objected to Canjth's compromise suggestion in the previous discussion section, I've moved all the "nontraditional" items off the article page and posted them below. If we end up not keeping them, the list below should probably be deleted. Feel free to dispute this edit by discussing it here, but please respect the process and participate in the discussion, rather than blindly reverting. My rationale for removing this chunk of content is that this material is unsourced, unfocused, a sprawling list, and largely made up of terms which many editors suspected were really just jokes. None of these traits should characterize a Wikipedia article. I'm not saying there could never be serious expansion of this article with more terms, but doing so is going to take a lot more work than just starting an unsourced list based entirely on hearsay or original research. I don't mean to sound grumpy or denigrate the interest other editors have for this article; in fact, I am trying to help salvage it from being deleted by much more experienced editors or admins who would very likely frown on (if not scowl at) the article in its most previous form. --<a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikkiTikkiTavi_aec1.html" title="User:WikkiTikkiTavi">WikkiTikkiTavi</a> 03:46, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>The phrase "if there's grass on the field, play ball!" commonly refers to how young a girl should be to have intercourse. Another take on it is "if there's no grass on the field, play in the mud!"</li>
<li>A <b>Batboy</b> is one who has never reached first base. (see <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Pie_5f6b.html" title="American Pie">American Pie</a>)</li>

<p>It should be noted that many of these euphemisms were created for comedic effect, and may not be commonly used.</p>

<p>I've removed the unsourced "in the U.K." content. Although I've found sources from the United States and from Australia, I've yet to come across a single source from the U.K., let alone one that supports that content. The entire paragraph appears to have been based upon a misunderstanding, anyway. <i>According to the sources</i>, the addition of <a href="../../../o/r/a/Oral_sex.html" title="Oral sex">oral sex</a> is not a variation between countries, but a variation over time. It is something that has changed since the 1960s. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 17:26, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>those euphemisms are used all around the world.. not only usa and australia, i live in costa rica and some people use them over here -betoelbicho</p>
