<p>This article is far too UK based. Heinz for instance is an American company - but the article only talks about its British product. <a href="../../../r/m/h/User%7ERmhermen_d338.html" title="User:Rmhermen">Rmhermen</a> 20:22, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The article is not UK-Centric, it explains the history. However, I have been told by many people that Baked Beans/z are UK produced only and then they export them to the rest of the world. If this is the case and the article is UK-Centric then its got rigour and it would be acceptable to focus on the UK as a main theme for the topic involved. Maybe somebody could research the origins and producers of baked beans to make the article more academically sound?</dd>
</dl>

<dd>Baked beans <i>are</i> UK centric, therefore one would expect the article to reflect this.</dd>

<dd>I agree, and I have removed the tag. The article is clearly categorized as <i>British cuisine</i>. The fact that Heinz is an American company is hardly relevant; it is well established in the UK. If someone thinks there is more to be said about the US (or any other) angle, please add it. --<a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShantavira_6f6b.html" title="User:Shantavira">Shantavira</a> 15:06, 7 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Baked beans in cans are an American invention, to be fair, and baked beans are available in the USA - but the UK is the highest consumer of said beans in the world. <a href="../../../m/a/g/User%7EMagic_Pickle_06a3.html" title="User:Magic Pickle">Magic Pickle</a> 19:20, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Don't forget about New England, which produces a distinct variety of baked beans and is a traditionally huge consumer of said beans. B&amp;M Baked beans are the best example of these on the market (the beans are pea beans rather than navy beans, and they are slow cooked in brick ovens in the New England manner). Nobody in Boston would eat any bean but this type, and I've never known anybody who ate those awful Heinz beans regularly around here. Baked Beans are just as significant to the Boston area and New England as they are to the UK, if not more so, and thus the article is indeed UK-centric.</dd>

<ul>
<li>C'mon, The UK is a whole country. As ace as Boston and New England are, they are only <i>one</i> state. Therefore the UK bias is fair, because Baked Beans are an integral part of UK mass culture. Baked Beans on toast is probably the first thing most British kids learn to make for themselves, meal-wise. Another point: The UK eat a lot of hamburgers, yet it would be wise to make the hamburger article US centric because of the cultural link to the country. Although Baked Beans in tins were not a UK invention, the whole population consumes them with gusto. One state may also love its beans - fair enough, but one country versus one state? The UK-centricity is fair. <a href="../../../m/a/g/User%7EMagic_Pickle_06a3.html" title="User:Magic Pickle">Magic Pickle</a> 18:39, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Yes, the article is too UK-centric.</p>
<p>The Heinz baked beans in tomato sauce you get in Canada (and presumably the US too - someone else will have to confirm this) is a different recipe to that you get in the UK, Ireland etc. (other brand baked beans available in the British Isles arebroadly similar to the Heinz recipe). It is sweeter, with fewer savoury flavours (spices, onion etc.). The difference is enough that a lifelong baked-bean lover such as myself will not buy the Canadian version, choosing instead to buy Amy's organic baked beans, or to eat home-made. I understand that homesick English-speaking Europeans from all over <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greater_Vancouver_09b5.html" title="Greater Vancouver">Greater Vancouver</a> will visit the British shop in <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steveston%2C_British_Columbia_a5e3.html" title="Steveston, British Columbia">Steveston</a> to get their fix of baked beans that aren't sickly sweet to their palates.</p>
<ul>
<li>Eh? Why would Europeans go to a UK store to get their fix of British beans? Are you confusing Greater Europe with UK here? Secondly, while I respect your discerning love of beans, your elite bean tastes perhaps alienate you from what the article is trying to achieve - a description of the mass-market foodstuff that is an integral part of UK culinary culture. I mean, you can buy pasties filled with baked beans in this country. We love it. <a href="../../../m/a/g/User%7EMagic_Pickle_06a3.html" title="User:Magic Pickle">Magic Pickle</a> 18:43, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>In Canada you will find beans in tomato sauce displayed alongside beans with tomato sauce and pork (i.e. a tin of baked beans with a small lump of fat in it) and beans in maple syrup. I don't know whether or not it is the same in the U.S., or whether this is another <a href="../../../c/u/i/Cuisine_of_Quebec_1e4f.html" title="Cuisine of Quebec">Quebecois</a> fast food that, like <a href="../../../p/o/u/Poutine.html" title="Poutine">poutine</a>, has spread to the rest of Canada.</p>
<p>One should also bear in mind the farting scene in <a href="../../../b/l/a/Blazing_Saddles_d431.html" title="Blazing Saddles">Blazing Saddles</a>. As far as I know (someone will need to do some research to prove me right or wrong), this is based on a historical fact, that canned beans were a common item in a U.S./Canadian cowboy diet, as were some other canned foods, such as tomatoes. (This would not have been true, incidentally, in Argentina, where the eating of food other than meat was regarded by the <a href="../../../g/a/u/Gaucho.html" title="Gaucho">cowboys</a> as a sign of homosexuality, and a lot of the cowboys therefore had <a href="../../../r/i/c/Rickets.html" title="Rickets">rickets</a>.) There was certainly a phase in U.S. cowboy culture when meals were prepared from dried beans on the chuckwagon. As I said, it is my belief that canned beans would have replaced dried beans as they became available, but someone will need to prove me right or wrong. It would be great if the person who does so could also ammend the <a href="../../../c/h/u/Chuckwagon.html" title="Chuckwagon">chuckwagon</a> article.</p>
<p>What I know of cowboy diet comes from having read <i>Cowboys of the Americas</i> by Richard W. Slatta a few years ago.</p>

<dd>Agreed, it needs to be less UK-focused. It would also be very nice if the article explained the differences between the various recipes, and didn't focus so heavily on <i>canned</i> beans (in my opinion, the canned product does no justice to the original). Boston-style beans (which are really the <i>only</i> kind commonly found in New England, as far as I know) would <i>never</i> contain tomatoes (the very thought would horrify most New Englanders), but would be based on either maple syrup or molasses (my mother usually uses molasses) and would <i>always</i> contain chunks of salt pork, but very few spices and no onions. The beans to be used are disputed: my mother uses soldier beans, or navies if she can't get soldiers (which are an heirloom variety), and would never use pea beans; but some others would swear by pea beans. By the way, some New Englanders (including myself) do find the Boston beans too sweet, and it is not uncommon for individuals to put vinegar on them at the table. -GSwift 07:45, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>Baked beans are also part of an <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_breakfast.html" title="Irish breakfast">Irish breakfast</a></li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>According to the Irish breakfast article, baked beans are not part of the traditional Irish breakfast an indeed may be frowned upon due to their connection with the English. While baked beans may appear in some non-traditional Irish breakfasts I would suggest this is largely irrelevant as they also appear in many other breakfasts styles with British influence. In any case the above line clearly does not fit in to the description (Traditional cuisines of many regions claim such recipes as typical specialities, for example) <a href="../../../n/i/l/User%7ENil_Einne_a722.html" title="User:Nil Einne">Nil Einne</a> 15:22, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
