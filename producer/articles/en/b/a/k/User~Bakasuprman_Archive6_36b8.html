<p>Hey, thanks for fixing the WP Bangladesh template, and adding it to several places. I also noticed that you've added your name to WP Bd... welcome there. Perhaps you might do some googling and work on some temples of BD? We have only 4-5 temple articles now ... but there should be more to represent the others.</p>
<p>To get you started with something related to Bengal and Bengali renaissance, how about <a href="../../../k/a/l/Kaliprasanna_Singha_e9d3.html" title="Kaliprasanna Singha">Kaliprasanna Singha</a>? He is credited with one of the first Bengali prose "Hutom Penchar Noksha" (Recollections of an owl?). That's sort of a collection of essays on contemporary events in the 1850s Calcutta ... I've read it and it's interesting. What might interest you is that he is also credited with translation of <a href="../../../m/a/h/Mahabharata.html" title="Mahabharata">Mahabharata</a> into Bengali prose form. --<a href="../../../r/a/g/User%7ERagib_55a5.html" title="User:Ragib">Ragib</a> 08:04, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I did not quite understand your message on Kannada literature. Did you mean to say you will create a page for it containing the names of poets? or their works? or both?. There is already a page for Kannada literature. I had created a page called <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karnataka_literature.html" title="Karnataka literature">Karnataka literature</a> that contains both Kannada and Sanskrit scholars from the Karnataka region. Is this the page you were writing about?</p>

<p>if you are thinking so than i must clarify that I am not a hardline Atheist like, say Salman Rushdie. And we are not claiming that there are hindu atheists (though there are), we are just saying that even an atheist can be a hindu. This is important in the intro section as it is something unique to Hinduism. We are just talking about the philosophy part, so we dont need to have evidence for atheists among contemporary hindus. The other statement is this, which claims that majority of contemporary hindus are vedanta followers and they worship Even vishnu and Shiva in a form of cosmic spirit called brahmana. I guess it is completely wrong. Because this is just a view of Advaita vedanta and if there is a census, they wont find more than 1% followers.

<p>HOW DARE YOU ACCUSE ME OF HAVING AN AGENDA TO DISCREDIT HINDU CULTURE! I may be Pakistani but that does not mean I'm here to discredit it or I'm naturally biased. I'm stating what most academics accept as the truth. To tell you the truth, I'm ONE OF THE FEW PAKISTANIS ON THIS BLOODY ENCYCLOPEDIA THAT STILL ACKNOWLEDGES THE FACT THAT PAKISTAN AND INDIA WERE HISTORICALLY THE SAME CIVILIZATION. ASK User: Freedom Skies FOR PROOF. I'VE RECEIVED HARSH CRITICISM FROM MANY PAKISTANIS ON HERE FOR "ACCEPTING INDIAN POV" UP TO THE POINT WHERE THEY ACCUSE ME OF BEING INDIAN! YOU ARE FOOLISH FOR MAKING SUCH ASSERTIONS! With regards to this theory, I think you've looked at the original version way too much and have completely ignored what modern mainstream academics show. The modern, updated version of this theory states that a linguistic group of Eurasian nomads who may have referred to themselves as "Arya" but were perhaps a tribal confederation of several old racial stocks speaking a common tongue, migrated to the subcontinent gradually in family groups. They gradually displaced the local population, driving them either south or absorbing them into their own society via the caste system. From genetics, it is proven that the majority of the migrants were probably male, so they intermarried with local women extensively. As a result, ALL SOUTH ASIAN PEOPLE have a common mitochondrial base dating back to the earliest homo sapien migrants to the subcontinent 30,000-50,000 years ago. It is in terms of y-chromosomes, that differences appear. Upper castes and northern indians tend to exhibit greater quantities of Eurasian genes in their Y-chromosomes. The greatest frequency, in fact, comes from the Punjabis, whose y-chromosomes are 40%-50% derived from ancient Eurasian nomadic migrants and invaders that came within the last 3000 years and later. The same is true for Kashmiris and other north indian groups, but it gets lesser as you go down the country. The languages, however, are known to have spread greatly beyond the genes, into Bengal, Assam, Maharashtra and the central regions, where probably only a few "Aryans" came and mingled with a mostly indigenous population who took on the languages. The same is true for the Sinhalese and the Maldivians. ( I think I butchered the latter nationality's spelling). This was probably more to do with the cultural influence of the Indo-Aryans and how their cultures spread through trade and acquisition, rather than through further population replacements. Thus, the peoples of the subcontinent are greatly mixed, yet all are the same and have the same mitochondrial ancestors from the dawn of human habitation in the subcontinent. Nevertheless, in the north and south, there do exist racial types that wouldnt be found in the other region. Many Punjabis in Northwest India and Pakistan have prominent, Afghan-influenced faces that wouldnt be found in say Tamil Nadu. Kashmiris have a racial type that most definetely would not be found anywhere within the south (except maybe <a href="../../../h/y/d/Hyderabad.html" title="Hyderabad">Hyderabad</a> where alot of Muslims came from similar regions anyway). You see, being located where it is, Indians and Pakistanis have a color tone that varies depending on how far or close you are to the equator. The closer you are, you will be more dark. Likewise, the more south your traditional homeland is in India, the more closer to the equator you are, and of course, you will be bound to be darker than someone from further north, such as a Kashmiri, Punjabi or even a Pashtun. Nevertheless, most Indians having the same mitochondrial base, also have similar genes in their y chromosomes, mixed in of course in varying degrees with invader ones, leading them to look more or less the same with variations. Now with regards to Hindu culture not existing outside of India. Actually, the modern version of this theory (which has archaeological and genetic proof)does not say in any way that Hinduism was brought to the subcontinent. It says that the nomads had a culture of their own that had several nature-based deities such as Indra and Varuna, and this religion mixed with the local Dravidian and tribal religions to form Hinduism. All the scriptures were written in the subcontinent, all the developments in the faith were made in India. The only foreign element are the Rig Vedic gods of Indra, Varuna, Agni, Mitra and others. And there is archaelogical proof showing these gods were worshipped outside of India, with no predating Indian contact. The Mitanni, an Indo-Aryan people who went west instead of going to the subcontinent, carried these deities with them to what is now Syria and Iraq. There is a treaty a Mitanni king made with the Hittites, that has been discovered that invokes these deities. Also, some of the verses in the Rig Veda (not the entire Rig Veda itself) are known to have come from the outside, as the Iranian Aryans used them in their Zoroastrian holy book, the <a href="../../../a/v/e/Avesta.html" title="Avesta">Avesta</a>. Also, discoveries in <a href="../../../b/m/a/BMAC_eccf.html" title="BMAC">BMAC</a> have also shed light on Indo-Aryan/Iranian practices being followed outside of both Iran and India. Nevertheless, what is now Hinduism is entirely rooted in India, most of its core concepts, such as Karma, reincarnation, yoga, and Dharma, as well as the main trinity, are rooted in the Dravidian civilization in the Indus Valley.

I think its best if we leave all columnist reactions out of it, as ensuring balance will lead to undue bloating. We can concentrate on the reports for now. I think that's reasonable. Also, I have no intention of reporting anyone for 3RR if they simply discuss things on the talk page. I dont want the investigation section of a current news event to have an npov tag on it, and its best to try and avoid that by scrupulously keeping to reporting.

<p>Hi - see <a href="../../../d/y/k/Template%7EDYK_11c4.html" title="Template:DYK">Template:DYK</a> and its talkpage. You should write a new article and propose an interesting fact from it on the template talkpage (it should be interesting in the eyes of others) - the new entries are listed there. Make sure that the article is of a proper size (not a stub, but no need to be too lengthy), layout and without grammatical and spelling errors. Clear references must be provided and no POV. All entries hang around for 5 days, during which admins that manage DYK will decide to put it up for display. <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERama%27s_Arrow_544a.html" title="User:Rama's Arrow"><font color="blue"><b>Rama's arrow</b></font></a> 20:23, 17 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Bakaman, thanks for your message on my page. The Rana Bhagwandass article has turned out very well and is a real good DYK.</p>
<p>As for myself, I usually skim through stubs of my interest (mostly history and geography of India) and try to get them in decent shape. Along the way, every topic throws up something really interesting.</p>

<dd>Hi Bakaman, I see you're on a roll now!! One more advice. While creating a new article, try to do it in a single day so that the nomination can go out the same day. It increases the chances of it getting into DYK. Plus you get more time to respond to objections during the nomination. If creating within one day is not possible, then create it in your sandbox first and then move it to the actual article. Will check out the Nanavati article as soon as I have time -- <a href="../../../l/o/s/User%7ELostintherush_780a.html" title="User:Lostintherush"><font color="olive"><b>Lost</b></font></a><a href="../../../l/o/s/User_talk%7ELostintherush_4204.html" title="User talk:Lostintherush"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 06:27, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Further, it is a very ugly and depressing part of India's history for which all Indians are embarrassed and uncomfortable with the whole hideous sage. The whole affair should never have taken place and for a nation with such amazing moralistic leaders it brought a terribly low point in its history and all the Mahatma Gandhis, the bhagats, and saints must be "turning in their graves" --<a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarisingh_c8a5.html" title="User:Harisingh">Hari Singh</a> 18:50, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

So unless you are bluffing and crying wolf like Mahawiki always does, post the relevant links to the relevant diffs. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarvagnya_680d.html" title="User:Sarvagnya">Sarvagnya</a> 22:45, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>hmm.. well now i know what hinduvavadi(did i get that right?) means... looks like it is somebody's personal definition of hinduness. Well I have my own definition for 'hinduness' and it works fine for me. I dont believe in wearing my 'hindu' identity on my sleeve as I see no point in doing that. As for hindi, arent you the guys who make movies in urdu and pass it off as hindi movies? arent you the guys who make movies which is financed by terrorists and acted in by murderers? arent you the guys who support the terrorists and murderers by promoting such movies in the name of hindi? hmmm... questions questions.. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarvagnya_680d.html" title="User:Sarvagnya">Sarvagnya</a> 23:07, 22 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>what makes you think i am acting incivil? is there anything in my prev reply(above) that is factually untrue? Please point out. as for tipu, you're helping coz, in all fairness you ought to anyway. That you have your own agenda, seems to be the real reason though. If you are so bent on supporting me, support me against Mahawiki.</dd>

<p>Mahawiki has been bluffing all over wikipedia that I(and DK) are 'kannadi vandalising' or 'kannadising'(whatever that means) various articles. I am sure you would have seen him claiming that in many places.</p>
<p>So do me a favour, go through all those articles he is mentioning and point out even one single inappropriate edit by me. If you cant point out anything, stop supporting him blindly and spoiling the atmosphere on Wikipedia. I dont even remember how you entered the pic in (in me vs mahawiki) and why you are supporting him.</p>
<p>being a hindu<b>t</b>vavadi(did i get it right?) you might be interested in a glorious 'hindu rashtra'. I have also heard that people from your school of thought wish to have an akhanDa bharata or something. if that is the case, why are you driving a wedge between kannadigas and marathis for no reason. if you keep doing this maybe by the time you guys annexe all the lost territories(like pak, afghanistan) etc., you might have ended up breaking up into pieces the hindu rashtra as it stands today. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarvagnya_680d.html" title="User:Sarvagnya">Sarvagnya</a> 23:25, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Dear Baka, As u have understood by now,the above user is only capable of bitching and badmouthing others.He calls names like bluff,shameless,troll etc etc.I cant belive one can be so arrogant and incivilised.He is asking everyone to stand against me so that he can push his state's POV everywhere.He has problems with Hindi Marathi Tamil Belgaon Kaveri etc etc etc!He doesnt love Hinduism or India,he is all for his beloves state Karnataka!</p>
<p>I do think u should feel closer to Thackeray as he is not a pseudo-secular like that Gowda who is good for nothing!In fact,Gowda has pronounced that Tipu was hero and he will break the alliance with BJP if they dont adhere to secularism!</p>
<p>One more thing I must add,I simply detest Bollywood movies.I am not exactly in love with Hindi and Tipu has not united Maharashtrians-Kannadis as they are against Tipu just because 'he used Persian instead of Kannada'language in courts!Intresting na? <a href="../../../m/a/h/User%7EMahawiki_4ad2.html" title="User:Mahawiki">mahawiki</a> 04:03, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Baka, The user Sarvagnya is just hellbent on badmouthing Marathi people and non-Kannada people. He doesn't even spare <a href="../../../t/i/p/Tipu_Sultan_c2f4.html" title="Tipu Sultan">Tipu Sultan</a>, who as far as I know, wasn't against any <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindus.html" title="Hindus">Hindus</a>. I know he came to <a href="../../../m/a/r/Maratha.html" title="Maratha">Marathas</a> (Nanasaheb Peshwa was the ruler then), and the Marathas declined support to him. But still he is against Tipu just because "he preferred Persian to Kannada". It shows his mentality. He has also been stalking us, me and mahawiki and bringing troubles in development of our Marathi-related articles.</p>
<p>Secondly, I am proud to be a <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindu.html" title="Hindu">Hindu</a>, but I am even more proud to be a <a href="../../../m/a/h/Maharashtrian.html" title="Maharashtrian">Maharashtrian</a>. My primary identity is <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marathi.html" title="Marathi">Marathi</a>. As it is, I am a <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marathi.html" title="Marathi">Marathi</a> first and I can never compromise on my Marathi identity. I still feel that Thackeray made a mistake by embracing Hindutva and putting Marathittva in the back burner. I think Marathittva should come first. The Marathi identity is more closer to me. So, Marathi Muslims and Marathi Christians are more closer to me than North Indian Hindus. An identity is based on Shared Culture. An identity based on Shared Religion is farcical and is bound to fail. Simply because, as a Hindu, I have been told that "All paths lead to same Destination". Thus all religions lead to the same "Spiritual Palace".</p>
<p>Thirdly, Tipu hasn't united Maharashtrians-Kannadis, because his being anti-Kannada means nothing to us.</p>

<p>Hi Bakasuprman!</p>
<p>The word "Swadhyay" is a Sanskrut word. That is what I want to tell. What you are trying to focus is Swadhyay practice and what I am trying to do is give the meaning of Swadhyay. I had elaborately explained about the connotation of Swadhyay but someone removed it and at leisure I want to write it again.</p>
<p>There is difference in self-study and study of one's self. Self study is an individual effort to study any subject whereas study of one's self is related to learn about one's self even in a group.</p>
<p>Swadhyay is not a central idea of Jainism. "Swadhyay" goes back to thousands of years back history. I am not knowing period but Jainism is comparatively few hundred years old religion. Swadhyay means Swa+Adhyayan.</p>
<p>Should I correct your last edits?</p>

<p>You are absolutely right. The Ramayan and the Mahabharat have not been revised, nor do they mention of any kingdoms which are in Tamil Nadu, or Kerala. As a matter of fact in Mahabharata it mentions of the 16 Mahajanapadas. The southern most was in the Maharashtran state and parts of Central India called <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assaka.html" title="Assaka">Assaka</a>. The Ramayana mentions of how Hanuman crossed over to Lanka, true in the mythological story. Homer's Iliad speaks of the Trojan war between the Athenians and the Trojans. Does that mean that Troy was part of Athens at the time? Just because Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, Java and Bali Indonesia dance the Ramayana or have arts depicting the Ramayana, doesn't mean they are part of India. Just because Islam is practices all over the Middle East, does not mean they are one country either... Stop living in a fantasy... Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Tripura, Mizoram, Pondichery, Assam, and Nagaland became part of India through the British. When the British left, they gave the princely states a choice to be part of India or not. Those who chose not to be part of India, were over run by the Indian army and taken over.

<p>Here are some more facts for you:</p>
<pre>
1. Mizo Hills were formally declared as part of the British-India by a proclamation in 1895.[<a href="http://mizoram.nic.in/about/history.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://mizoram.nic.in/about/history.htm" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>]

3. The 'Tripura' is a small state within the union of India. It was an independent country till the merger with independent India 
   in 1949 A.D.[<a href="http://www.tripurasociety.org/historyfinal.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.tripurasociety.org/historyfinal.htm" rel="nofollow">[10]</a>]
4. Manipur was not a Part of India. It was forcibly annexed by India. In 21 September 1949 the king of Manipur was forced to sign 
   the Marger Agreement.[<a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/manipur.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/manipur.htm" rel="nofollow">[11]</a>]
5. Pondicherry becomes part of India in 1963. [<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/5365248.stm" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/5365248.stm" rel="nofollow">[12]</a>]
</pre>
<p>These are not the only states which did not become part of India until the arrival of the British or after the British left. If India was actaully one Empire during ancient times, how come there are over 23 distinct languages, and thousands of dialects? Why are there three major families of ethinic groups Dravidians (of African/ Australian roots), Indo-Aryans (of Persian roots - and of course where the name India came from), and the Mon-Kmher (of Burmese/ Cambodian roots)?[<a href="http://www.geocities.com/indrancroos/drav-arya-mon.JPG" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.geocities.com/indrancroos/drav-arya-mon.JPG" rel="nofollow">[13]</a>]</p>

<p><b>To Bakasupran:</b> You are sounding like a Fascist Nazi now.

<p>In response to your question on my talk page -Are you familiar with the Swadhyay Parivar? We need another set of eyes on the article. Bakaman Bakatalk 14:55, 24 September 2006 (UTC)- I am somewhat familiar with the Swadyay Parivar, but hardly and expert.

<p><i>"Fascist Nazi" - Congrats to making yourself look like a Troll</i></p>
<p>Does it ever occur to you that there is a growing trend of people who make you out to be a Facist, racist, Ignorant, Fanatical, Vandal, Brahmin, Hater? So far, I am the second one who has classified you as a Facist. I was going to make number two in regarding you as a Brahmin. But I see someone else has accused you of that too. How did I know you were a Brahmin? I wonder... hmmm... I so happen to have a couple of Brahmin friends, unlike yourself. You give Brahmins a bad name. It's a shame that a majority of Brahmins so happen too... Why do you praise Sanskrit so much when it is not even your mother tongue? I understand that everyone has a right to their opinions... Here is mine, stop calling yourself a Tamil!</p>

<p>Baka, first of all, if you want your talkpage semiprotected, you should ask someone. There seems to be a bit of ethnic anger directed at you in the above posts by new users. Secondly, I notice you again reverted Gautier; in particular the line which says he is "sympathetic to Indian culture" and to Hindutva. Why is this a problem? The links at the bottom of the article go to pages that say (chosen at random) "There is no doubt that under Prime Minister Vajpayee, India had entered her Golden Period, her second Renaissance. But will the BJP remain faithful to its original aspirations, or will it become 'Congressized' as Nostradamus has predicted?". There are many more. Would you like to suggest an alternative line that can summarise the fact that (a) Gautier is interested in Indian culture and (b) Gautier is sympathetic to a certain political viewpoint? Thanks. <a href="../../../h/o/r/User%7EHornplease_3cdc.html" title="User:Hornplease">Hornplease</a> 06:08, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Can you show any sources that Tamil was not even a language until the second millienium. I will tell you what brand of Tamil you are, you are a modern-day confused Brahmin. They have a tendency to discredit Tamil and to uplift Sanskrit. Why, because they lost power in Tamil Nadu during the early 1900s. By the way, can you tell me when the Tolkapiyam was written? This is one of the earliest forms of Tamil grammar and literature. Let me quote:</p>
<pre>
"In the earliest Tamil Grammar extant, which was composed by a Brahmin named Tholkappiyan, in the first or second century B.C."
</pre>
<pre>
Source: Pillai, V. Kanakasabhai (1997)<i>The Tamils Eighteen Hundred Years Ago</i> New Delhi; Madras: Asian Educational  Services p. 116
</pre>
<p>I do not use blogs as sources, but only to upload documents from legitimate sources. I have a good question for you. If the Tamils did not introduce Hinduism, Buddhism, and other customs into Southeast Asia, then who did? Freedom fries? Hey, guess what! Did you know that it was the Tamils who not only introduced Tamil, but also introduced your Dorai's language of Sanskrit into Southeast Asia too... The reason why "Indian" history is so shadowy is because there are a lot of Nationalistic Ding Dongs modifying their own history just to look big. Why? Because of a diagnosis of inferiority complex...</p>
<p>Here are a few charts on the similarities of Tamil and Malay words. By the way, these were scanned from an actual book. and the only way to get this onto wikipedia is to upload it to Geo-Cities. Enjoy... <a href="http://www.geocities.com/indrancroos/Tamil-Malay1.jpg" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.geocities.com/indrancroos/Tamil-Malay1.jpg" rel="nofollow">[19]</a><a href="http://www.geocities.com/indrancroos/Tamil-Malay2.jpg" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.geocities.com/indrancroos/Tamil-Malay2.jpg" rel="nofollow">[20]</a><a href="http://www.geocities.com/indrancroos/Tamil-Malay3.jpg" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.geocities.com/indrancroos/Tamil-Malay3.jpg" rel="nofollow">[21]</a></p>
<p>Here is the source of the material:</p>
<pre>
Arokiaswamy Phd., Celine W.M. (2000) <i>Tamil Influences in Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines.</i> Manila: Mary Martin  p. 52-57.
</pre>
<p>Brahmins in the past have contributed to Tamil, however, they are now in the trend of discrediting Tamil. Parrots can say they are Tamils too. So, what does that mean that you are a Tamil? When the "Northern Indians" run out of ideas to discredit Tamil, they always have the so called modern-day confused Brahmin Tamils to do their dirty work for them. Just like amongst the Afro-Americans, there are those that they consider sell-outs amongst their people "Token Blacks", you are no different. Yes you are a Tamil, a "Token Tamil". There are three types of people in every culture. They are the <i>good</i>, the <i>bad</i>, and the <i>ugly</i>... I assume that you are not a <i>bad</i> guy, nor are you <i>good</i>...</p>

<dd>Perhaps persons involved are capable of sorting out the issues without any one's intervention. As such, I am requesting them to resolve the issues themselves, and failing that they may initiate further action at a better and at the proper place. I am not a party to the dispute, and I am also not interested in taking the role of a mediator as I do believe that editors involved are capable of resolving the issues themselves. Moreover, my knowledge of the "things" they are talking about is very limited, and an expert is required to deal with the contents. As regards civility and language, such things sometimes happen, and editors learn to talk nicely in the long run or face the consequences. I also thank you for your suggestions.
