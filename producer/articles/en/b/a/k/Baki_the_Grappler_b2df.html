<ul>
<li><b>Baki Hanma</b> (範馬刃牙 <i>Hanma Baki</i>): The main character, and son of Yujiro Hanma. He has been training in martial arts since the age of three, and has trained under various teachers and coaches throughout his life. At the age of thirteen, he decided to take his training into his own hands and left the coaches to perform more intense training "in his father's footsteps." He later meets with his father and becomes disillusioned as to his father's true character, and afterwards, aims to defeat and kill him. His fighting style is called "total fighting," and includes techniques from many different martial arts. He fights Arudi Regan in round 1, Zool in round 2, Igari Kanji in round 3, Retsu Kaioh in round 4 before facing his brother in round 5 and the finals of the tournament. He eventually develops the demon face on his back when fighting his brother, but manages to suppress it. Unlike Yujiro, he chooses to control his killing intent and fight his battles fair &amp; honorably no matter what the outcome.</li>
<li><b>Yujiro Hanma</b> (範馬勇次郎 <i>Hanma Yūjirō</i>): The father of Baki and Jack Hammer/Hanma. He is the strongest creature in the world, and is known to have mastered all styles of unarmed combat. His repertoire apparently includes all of the well-known fighting styles (such as boxing, tae kwon do, judo, jujutsu, wrestling, street-fighting, and so on) as well as some more esoteric ones (such as the udonde or uzunde style, an actual system used in the Motobu style of karate). He has been fighting on the battlefields, using only his bare hands, since the age of sixteen, when he fought against both American and Vietcong in the Vietnam War. Since then, it appears that he has obtained respect from the American forces, and has begun fighting as a kind of mercenary for them. It is said that when he stopped fighting for survival but for pleasure during the wars the image of the demon's face appeared on his back. He refuses to fight "weaker" foes (or those unwilling to fight) and will only fight when anyone retaliates against him.</li>
</ul>
<p>Below is a list(no order) of styles Yujiro has fought and won against:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Brazilian Jiu-jitsu</li>
<li>Karate</li>
<li>Kickboxing</li>
<li>Judo</li>
<li>Sumo Wrestling</li>
<li>Greco-Roman Wrestling</li>
<li>Various forms of Karate including Doppo's Shinshinkai</li>
<li>Aikido</li>
<li>Street Fighting and Baki</li>
<li>Jujutsu</li>
<li>Boxing</li>
<li>Military fighting tactics of Green Berets, Navy Seals, and Army Airborne Ranger</li>
<li>Muay Thai</li>
<li>Yoga</li>
<li>Tae-kwon-do</li>
<li>Tonfa</li>
<li>Chinese Kung Fu</li>
<li>The Forces of Nature itself</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Doppo Orochi</b> (愚地独歩 <i>Orochi Doppo</i>): A karate master and head of the shinshinkai-kan (a karate style which seems to be inspired by the real-life style of kyokushin karate). One of the only people in the world able to stand toe-to-toe with Yujiro. He whips his students into shape by fighting them regularly, and practices all of his karate techniques at least one thousand times daily. A very devoted karate practitioner, and a mentor of Baki's. Also the instructor of Katou and father of Katsumi. He eventually fights the escaped American convict Dorian in the 'Search of our Strongest Hero' manga series. Dorian manages to cut off Doppo's hand with a strange wire-cutting technique in which he uses a wire blade projected from a lighter. Doppo later avenges this loss when he, Katsumi, and Retsu track Dorian down. Shortly after this however, Dorian escapes from the hospital and uses an explosive that is implanted into his hand to blow off part of Doppo's face. He fights Richard Phyllis in round 1, Amanai Ryu in Round 2 before facing another master Gouki Shibukawa in round 3 which he loses after a brutal match.</li>
<li><b>Gouki Shibukawa</b>: Master of the ancient jujutsu arts used by the samurai soldier-warriors of feudal Japan. Is sixty years of age, and has trained since prior to WWII, in the "old days" of the martial arts. His art makes use of the martial arts principle of aiki, which uses the opponents' attacks against him. Manages to make it all the way through to semi-finals in the Maximum Tournament series and battles against Jack Hammer. He later teams up with Baki to face the Japanese convict Yanagi Ryukou in the 'Search of our Strongest Hero' series. He faces Roger Harlon in round 1, Shinogi Koushou in round 2 before facing Doppo in round 3 and losing to Jack Hammer in round 4. When not fighting, he's quite eccentric (as well as a bit senile) as he lives the day and fears nothing.</li>
<li><b>Kaoru Hanayama</b>: Fifteen-year-old yakuza leader and strongman. His grip is so strong that if he grabs an opponent's arm, he can usually cause it to explode from restricting the blood flow. He is also a street fighter and it is unknown if he has trained in martial art styles. He broke Yuri Chakosky's arm, thus ending his boxing career, but when then cross paths again they hold no grudge against each other understanding each other's warrior spirit. He has memorable battles with Baki Hanma, Katsumi Orochi, and the infamous showdown with the convict Speck. Speck manages to place a handful of bullets into Hanayama's mouth and slam it shut, causes them to explode and creating two large holes in Hanayama's mouth. Although Hanayama won the battle, he wears a facemask for most of the series. Later on, he is shown surgically treated. His code of honor is great as he chooses not to fall in battle even if it means his death; a family vow which has been held in a long tradition passed from generations. Even after 3 direct strikes from Katsumi, he still chose not to fall and chose to risk death. Katsumi even admitted that he lost his battle to him despite winning the match. He faces Bunnoshin Inagi in round 1, before losing to Orochi Katsumi in round 2.</li>
<li><b>Amanai Yuu</b>: Yujiro's apprentice. Yujiro meets him in America, where he is serving as a bodyguard to the President. It is unknown whether he is Japanese or American, but it is most likely that he is American but of Japanese descent. His style is based on "love," in contrast to Yujiro's style, which is more aggressive and based on rage. He fights Yamamoto Minuru in round 1 before battling Orochi Doppo in the Maximum Tournament.</li>
<li><b>Retsu Kaiou</b>: Kenpo practitioner. Trained in China and became the heir to the kenpo style in his temple. He fights Sergei Tactorof in round 1, Mount Toba in round 2, and destroys Orochi Katsumi in round 3 he then makes it to the semi-finals of the Maximum tournament and is pitted against Baki Hanma where he loses. Despite his great knowledge in his style, there is one flaw in his system that Baki seems to possess. In the 'Search of our Strongest Hero' saga, he has encounters with the British convict Hector Doyle and American convict Dorian. Teams up with Baki, Yujiro, and Mohammad Ali Jr. in the Chinese tournament saga.</li>
<li><b>Jack Hammer (or Jack Hanma)</b>: Baki's half brother, like Baki, must follow the Hanma path. He's Pitfighter from Canada. He is the son of Yujiro and a Canadian soldier woman who Yujiro met in Vietnam, during the Vietnam War. Like Baki, he has since childhood wished to surpass his father Yujiro in strength and martial ability. His obsession to defeat his father led to extreme over training and overworking of his body which led to the deterioration of his body, claiming he will never be able to defeat his father with normal training. After his encounter with the Yujiro inspired scientist, he received from him steroids to match his overtraining and has gained his immense power. One of his main techniques is biting, and he can bite hard enough to easily crush wood with his teeth. He fights Shenusiba in round 1, Misaki Kengo in round 2 before beating the unbeaten Andre Ancof Gerrard in round 3.In round 4 he fights Gouki Shibukawa and fights Baki Hanma in the finals of the Maximum Tournament where he congratulates his brother for a well fought victory. Afterwards, he takes on his father and his soundly defeated. Makes an appearance in the "Search of our Strongest Hero' series and battles against the Russian convict Sikorsky and Mohammed Ali Jr.</li>
<li><b>Strydum</b>: An American soldier and Yujiro's companion and comrade-at-arms. Originally met Yujiro as an enemy in the Vietnam War. Developed an admiration for Yujiro, and now he travels, fighting with him on the battlefields of the world. He somewhat understands Yujiro's mentality and mentions that he is the only person to bring the United States to its knees. He is also a friend and mentor of Baki's, who keeps him up to date about Yujiro's whereabouts.</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Artemis Regan</b>: A man of immsense size, he is over 12 feet tall and weighs over 600 pounds, easily the biggest man in the tournament he makes Mount Toba look small. He fights using professional wrestling and loses to Baki in round 1. According to Toba, just one small strike from Regan can knock a person out and because of it many Wrestling Promoters got angry at him for ending matches quickly. Baki convinces him to use all of his might which surprises him because no one has ever asked him to use all his power.</li>
<li><b>Zool</b>: More of a beast than a man, he is a large fighter from Africa that uses Vale Tudo. He beats Danny Shubaka in the first round before losing to Baki in the second.</li>

Later almost has his back broken by Yujiro.</li>
<li><b>Sergei Tactarof</b>: A sambo fighter from Russia, he breaks Regan's arm before his match with Retsu Kaioh as a show of strength. Though he is almost killed by Retsu in round 1, he is again brutally beaten by Andre Ancof Gerrard.</li>
