As part of the project, the tallest concrete-faced rockfill <a href="../../../d/a/m/Dam.html" title="Dam">dam</a> in the world would be built. This would also be the largest dam in <a href="../../../a/s/i/Asia.html" title="Asia">Asia</a> outside of <a href="../../../c/h/i/China.html" title="China">China</a>. It is expected to generate 2,400 <a href="../../../m/e/g/Megawatts.html" title="Megawatts">megawatts</a> (MW) of <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electricity.html" title="Electricity">electricity</a> once completed.</p>
<p>The purpose for the dam was to meet growing demand for electricity. However, most of this demand lies in <a href="../../../p/e/n/Peninsular_Malaysia_75ac.html" title="Peninsular Malaysia">Peninsular Malaysia</a> and not <a href="../../../e/a/s/East_Malaysia_f417.html" title="East Malaysia">East Malaysia</a>, where the dam is located. The original idea was to have 30% of the generated capacity consumed in East Malaysia and the rest sent to Peninsular Malaysia. This plan envisioned 660 km of overhead <a href="../../../h/v/d/HVDC_6904.html" title="HVDC">HVDC</a> transmission lines in East Malaysia, 670 km of undersea <a href="../../../h/v/d/HVDC_6904.html" title="HVDC">HVDC</a> cable and 460 km of <a href="../../../h/v/d/HVDC_6904.html" title="HVDC">HVDC</a> transmission line in Peninsular Malaysia.</p>
<p>Future plans for the dam include connecting it to an envisioned Trans-<a href="../../../b/o/r/Borneo.html" title="Borneo">Borneo</a> Power Grid Interconnection, which would be a grid to supply power to Sarawak, <a href="../../../s/a/b/Sabah.html" title="Sabah">Sabah</a>, <a href="../../../b/r/u/Brunei.html" title="Brunei">Brunei</a>, and <a href="../../../k/a/l/Kalimantan.html" title="Kalimantan">Kalimantan</a> (<a href="../../../i/n/d/Indonesia.html" title="Indonesia">Indonesia</a>).

<p>Initial survey was conducted in early 1960s and more studies were conducted in early 1980s. The studies cover the masterplan &amp; feasibility report, rock &amp; soil studies, hydro potential, detailed design &amp; costing, environmental &amp; socio-economic studies and HVDC transmission studies. Notable consultants involved were SAMA Consortium German Agency for Technical Cooperation, Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation &amp; Maeda-Okumura Joint Venture, Fitchner and Swed Power Swedish Agency for Technical Cooperation.</p>
<p>The project was first approved by government in 1986, it was shelved in 1990 due to decreased projection of electricity demand due to recession of 1985 and the decision to use the then low-cost natural gas a fuel for developing the petrochemical industry.</p>
<p><a name="Second_attempt" id="Second_attempt"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/k/Bakun_Hydroelectric_Project_1093.html" title="Edit section: Second attempt">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Second attempt</span></h3>
<p>It was revived in September 1993 by Malaysian Federal Government led by then-<a href="../../../p/r/i/Prime_Minister_2cf9.html" title="Prime Minister">Prime Minister</a> <a href="../../../m/a/h/Mahathir_Mohammad_0c91.html" title="Mahathir Mohammad">Mahathir Mohammad</a>. In January 1994, privatized contract was awarded to Ekran Berhad. In April 1995, Ekran completes the EIA of the project. The project was to cost US$2.4 billion and was originally scheduled for completion in 2003.</p>
<p>The dam was to be built beginning in 1994 by a privatised joint-venture consortium called Bakun Hydroelectric Corporation, comprising Ekran Berhad, <a href="../../../t/e/n/Tenaga_Nasional_Berhad_7309.html" title="Tenaga Nasional Berhad">Tenaga Nasional Berhad</a> (TNB), the government of <a href="../../../s/a/r/Sarawak.html" title="Sarawak">Sarawak</a>, <a href="../../../s/a/r/Sarawak_Electricity_Supply_Corporation_f50e.html" title="Sarawak Electricity Supply Corporation">Sarawak Electricity Supply Corporation</a> (Sesco), and Malaysia Mining Corporation Bhd (MMC). Ekran awarded the electromechanical works and the transmission portion to <a href="../../../a/b/b/ABB_8c0d.html" title="ABB">ABB</a>. ABB`s consortium partner for the civil works will be Companhia Brasileira de Projetos e Obras (CBPO) of Brazil, a large civil engineering company belonging to the Odebrecht Group, responsible for the construction of the dam and power house. Engineering consulting firms involved in the project then were TNB Hydro, a subsidiary of <a href="../../../t/e/n/Tenaga_Nasional_Berhad_7309.html" title="Tenaga Nasional Berhad">Tenaga Nasional Berhad</a> and KLIA Consult.</p>
<p>Ekran launched a rights issue to finance the building of the dam, but it was undersubscribed and Ting Pek Khing (Ekran's chairman) had to put up $500 million to take up the unsubscribed portion as part of his agreement with the <a href="../../../u/n/d/Underwriter.html" title="Underwriter">underwriters</a>. Ekran was a company of Ting Pek Khing, himself a timber businessman. Neither he nor his company had built a dam before. The entire project was not tendered publicly, and instead was awarded by government contract.</p>
<p>The project was halted in 1997 in the face of the <a href="../../../a/s/i/Asian_financial_crisis.html" title="Asian financial crisis">Asian financial crisis</a>. When the project was shelved, the Malaysian government took back the project from this consortium. By this time, RM 1.6 Billion had already been paid out by the government. The completed works were the river diversion tunnels by Dong Ah of Korea for RM 400 million, and to Global Upline for work completed on the auxiliary coffer dams for RM 60 million. Other works are for selective clearing of biomass, and relocation of the affected native residents. The government had also turned over RM 1 billion for the purchase of 8 turbines.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/k/Bakun_Hydroelectric_Project_1093.html" title="Edit section: Third attempt">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Third attempt</span></h3>
<p>In May 2000 it was revived through a 100% government owned company, Sarawak Hidro, but the transmission of power to Peninsular Malaysia was not part of the revived project. The construction work was tendered out as a <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turnkey.html" title="Turnkey">turnkey</a> contract. The completion date has been revised to February 2008.</p>
<p>The new civil builder is the Malaysia-China Hydro JV consortium, led by <a href="../../../s/i/m/Sime_Darby_c601.html" title="Sime Darby">Sime Engineering Berhad</a> of Malaysia (a subsidiary of <a href="../../../s/i/m/Sime_Darby_c601.html" title="Sime Darby">Sime Darby</a> and Sino-Hydro Corporation of China. Other members of the consortium are WCT Berhad, MTD Capital, Ahmad Zaki Resources, Syarikat Ismail and Edward &amp; Sons. It targeted a completion date of September 2007. The total sum to be paid to this consortium was budgetted at RM 1.8 billion. The electromechanical works for the turbines were awarded in two contracts to <a href="../../../i/m/p/IMPSA_4f24.html" title="IMPSA">IMPSA</a> of Brazil and <a href="../../../a/l/s/Alstom.html" title="Alstom">Alstom</a> of France.</p>
<p>In 2004, engineering consulting firm JW Knowles, was hired to study the delays in construction. Other engineering consulting firms involved in the project were Snowy Mountain Engineering Corporation, of Australia and <a href="../../../o/p/u/Opus_International_Malaysia_0b87.html" title="Opus International Malaysia">Opus International Malaysia</a>.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/k/Bakun_Hydroelectric_Project_1093.html" title="Edit section: Items of temporary interest during third attempt">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Items of temporary interest during third attempt</span></h3>
<p>In May of 2004 Ting Pek Khing's name again was raised in connection with the project. A Ting-owned company, Global Upline, was rumoured to be awarded a contract to undertake "biomass removal" in the flood basin. This would allow him to harvest timber in the area without a separate permit. Issuance of timber permits has come under increased scrutiny due to political conditions and environmental concerns. However, as of December 2006 it has not been awarded.</p>
<p>Usage of the generated capacity was to have been by a proposed aluminium smelting plant in Similajau, near <a href="../../../b/i/n/Bintulu.html" title="Bintulu">Bintulu</a>, approximately 180 km inland from the dam. The project is a joint venture between Dubai Aluminum Co, Ltd (Dubal) and Gulf International Investment Group (GIIG), an investment fund jointly set up by Malaysian tycoon Syed Mokhtar, and Dubai-based international financier Mohamed Ali Alabbar. This plant was expected to consume 50% of the power generated. The government has agreed in principle that 60% of Sarawak Hidro, the entity which owns the dam, will be sold to GIIG. Due to delays in dam construction, the plans for the smelter have since been shelved. The agreement for this smelter was originally signed in 2003 and some conditions have lapsed due to delays in construction.</p>
<p>At the end of 2004, the minor partners in the Malaysia-China Hydro JV consortium (Ahmad Zaki Resources Bhd, WCT Engineering Bhd and MTD Capital) will report quarterly losses due to the Bakun project. Discounting this project, they would all be operating profitably for the quarter.</p>
<ul>
<li>For Ahmad Zaki Resources Bhd, this is the first time it will report losses since 1993. Ahmad Zaki estimates net losses suffered for nine months ending September 30 2004 at RM4.55 million.</li>
<li>WCT has reported a net loss of RM13.08 million for the quarter ending September 30 2004 due to the Bakun project.</li>
<li>MTD Capital reported a RM4.04 million loss in the quarter ending September 30 2004 and attributed it to "a major project undertaken by the company in joint venture with both local and foreign partners" without specifically naming Bakun.</li>
<li>The lead partner in the project, Sime Engineering reported a profit of RM521,000 for the same quarter versus a profit of RM4.18 million for the same quarter in 2003. Declines in profit were attributed to cost overruns and project delays.</li>
</ul>
<p>In November 2007, Sime Darby, the parent company of the contractor Sime Engineering will be merged with Golden Hope and Guthrie into a new company with a market capitalization of RM 31 billion (USD 8 billion). <a href="http://biz.thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2006/11/28/business/16149148&amp;sec=business" class="external autonumber" title="http://biz.thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2006/11/28/business/16149148&amp;sec=business" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>Concurrently with the merger, the contractor Sime Engineering will takeover the ownership of the Bakun Dam project. <a href="http://www.biznewsdb.com/english/newspage/newspage.asp?ID=6121886&amp;file1=6&amp;bulan=12&amp;kw=wwqq" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.biznewsdb.com/english/newspage/newspage.asp?ID=6121886&amp;file1=6&amp;bulan=12&amp;kw=wwqq" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></p>
<p>As of February 2007, there are three developments affecting the Bakun project. The first is the merger of the Sime Darby, Guthrie and Golden Hope into a new entity named Synergy Drive. The second is the proposed takeover of the Bakun project by the contractor, Sime Engineering. The third is the revival of the submarine HVDC cable under the South China Sea to transport electricity from Borneo to Malaya.</p>

<p>Construction of the dam required the relocation of more than 9,000 native residents of the indigenuous peoples who lived in the area to be flooded. The residents have been relocated to a longhouse settlement named Sungai Asap in Bakun.</p>

<p>There are three major transmission lines sections:</p>
<p>The first is the Bakun to <a href="../../../b/i/n/Bintulu.html" title="Bintulu">Bintulu</a> <a href="../../../h/v/a/HVAC_6ace.html" title="HVAC">HVAC</a> double circuit overhead lines for a distance of 160 km.

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/k/Bakun_Hydroelectric_Project_1093.html" title="Edit section: Revival of submarine cable component">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Revival of submarine cable component</span></h3>
<p>The revived <a href="../../../s/u/b/Submarine_cable.html" title="Submarine cable">submarine cable</a> portion is to transport the electricity generated at Bakun Dam in Borneo to Malaya, possibly by year 2012. The consortium partners equity possibly will be <a href="../../../s/i/m/Sime_Darby_c601.html" title="Sime Darby">Sime Darby</a> (60%), <a href="../../../t/e/n/Tenaga_Nasional_3a95.html" title="Tenaga Nasional">Tenaga Nasional</a> (20%) and the malaysian Ministry of Finance (20%). The consortium is exploring financing facilities of up to 80% of the planned investment.</p>
<p>The cable is planned to transport 1600 MW of power from the Bakun Dam to <a href="../../../y/o/n/Yong_Peng_2bd9.html" title="Yong Peng">Yong Peng</a> via undersea HVDC power cables and then via land line onto the Malaysian <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Grid%2C_Malaysia_677c.html" title="National Grid, Malaysia">National Grid</a>. The use of HVDC cables would ensure the energy loss is minimal, at about 5% to 6% only. The cost of the undersea cable is estimated at RM 9 billion. The proposed concept is for 2 x 800 MW cables being laid about 660 km under the <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_China_Sea_9e9c.html" title="South China Sea">South China Sea</a> from the Sarawak shore to Yong Peng on Malaya.</p>
<p>Sime Darby would take ownership of the submarine cable project but not undertake its construction. The contractor is rumoured to be Malaysian Resources Corporation Berhad (MRCB), a public listed company on the <a href="../../../k/l/s/KLSE_7f39.html" title="KLSE">KLSE</a>.</p>
<p>The buyer of electricity is <a href="../../../t/e/n/Tenaga_Nasional_3a95.html" title="Tenaga Nasional">Tenaga Nasional</a>. The rate proposed is RM 0.17 per kilowatt hour at the intake onto the National Grid. Analysts estimated that generation cost using world market rate natural gas would cost RM 0.22 per kilowatt hour. A 4% increase every 4 years is envisaged over the 35 year concession period.</p>
