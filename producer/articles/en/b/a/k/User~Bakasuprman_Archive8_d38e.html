<h2><span class="mw-headline">Raja Yoga controversy</span></h2>
<p><b>Dear Hinduism Project editors</b>,</p>
<p>There is a controversy on the Hinduism regarding <a href="../../../r/a/j/Raja_Yoga_0eff.html" title="Raja Yoga">Raja Yoga</a>. Please read the debate on the Hinduism discussion page. Your comments are requested on the <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hinduism.html" title="Hinduism">Hinduism</a> discussion page to help resolve the controversy. Thank you. <a href="../../../h/e/b/User%7EHeBhagawan_f506.html" title="User:HeBhagawan">HeBhagawan</a> 15:16, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Do you know why user Swadhyayee is vandalising Hinduism article? I mean (just in case) do you know him personally? I am extremely annoyed about his allegations of sockpuppetting etc. on me just because a user RamRamji joined newly and made an edit and then never came back. I am extremely annoyed. He is another Sarvagnya. Can you help me by providing which Admins I should write to, about this allegation of sock puppetting&#160;? --<a href="../../../a/p/a/User%7EApandey_6f90.html" title="User:Apandey">Apandey</a> 15:57, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Have I been uncivil at any single place in the article or on the talk page. If you believe any one instance is incivil, I will acknowledge it because I believe you are having a NPOV here and would remain fair. Whether these should be in the article or not is a different question but whatever is there, it has to be correct. Everyone except him is saying the same thing. Even other individual articles are also claiming the same. Anyway alleging me for sockpupettng is something I will not tolerate. If you can not(do not wish to) provide the names of good/ relevant admins, it is fine. I will try to search myself. Thanks. --<a href="../../../a/p/a/User%7EApandey_6f90.html" title="User:Apandey">Apandey</a> 16:07, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Thanks Bakasuprman,</b></p>
<p>I am insisting as I feel I am right. To me Raj Yoga is physical and mental process to meditate whereas Jnan, Bhakti and Karma as it seems to me are sciences. The end result of Raj Yog is attaining Jnan. My fight is supplementary to the goals of HeBhagawan and A.Pandey. I simply could not bear the bullying language of A.Pandey. Some composure and reading would have made them accept my view point or alternatively their logical arguments (except it is in Patanjali Yogsutra) would have benefited me with some additional knowledge. How am I to give citations from Geeta? Do I give them all Geeta available on internet? Should a person writing or editing article on Geeta, not have fundamental knowledge of doctrines of Geeta? A.Pandey is trying to bullying as he feels himself senior to me. I have to bear with this teething problems.Swadhyayee 16:51, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Can you tell me how to include talk/contrib in signatures. Like for you it comes as Bakaman bakatalk. I wanted my signature to appear like Apandey(talk|contribs) or something similar. Can you help please&#160;? Thanks. --<a href="../../../a/p/a/User%7EApandey_6f90.html" title="User:Apandey">Apandey</a> 19:09, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for responding but it will not help. What I am trying to say is that my current signature is Apandey (in the text box of preferences), which is expanded to become <a href="../../../a/p/a/User%7EApandey_6f90.html" title="User:Apandey">Apandey</a> when I sign. So what should I put in the text box of preferences to get the desired effect. If I put what I see in the source of my talk page (as per your edits), I will not get the desired output. Can you please send me the exact text of your signature edit box in preferences. I hope I will be able to deduce it from there. Many thanks. --<a href="../../../a/p/a/User%7EApandey_6f90.html" title="User:Apandey">Apandey</a> 21:50, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Immigration</span></h2>
<p>What is wrong with you? Why are you being so difficult about this? You went on a rampage adding the Indian American cat randomly to anyone who ever spent any time here. Unless you <b>immigrate</b> here, rather than living here on a visa clearly deemed temporary, you do not qualify to be an Indian-American <i>unless you self-identify</i> as one. That is what is stated on the Indian American page. Note that <i>immigration</i> from this point of view does not mean simply living here, but doing the paperwork to indicate a permanent move. That is why visas are relevant, in the absence of self-identification. Is that clear? I cannot understand why you persist in labeling this <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>. It would help the rest of us if you didnt try and keep on misapplying WP policy once it has been pointed out to you how you are wrong. <a href="../../../h/o/r/User%7EHornplease_3cdc.html" title="User:Hornplease">Hornplease</a> 22:59, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Do not overuse the word 'useless'. You use it far to often, and I suggest that you attempt to find a word that more accurately fits the sense in which you use it, namely "something I did not read". About 'rest of us' I mean anyone who actually has an encyclopaedia to write.</dd>
<dd>In this case in particular, I once again <i>urge you read the immigration page</i>. You can be a professor at Columbia while being on a <i>short-term</i> visa. Many, many people are. The immigration page says very, very clearly in the second sentence - and I reproduce it here to save you the obviously great trouble of actually going there - "Immigration implies long-term permanent residence by the immigrants". So unless you are a permanent resident, with a green card, or a citizen, you have not immigrated to the US. Is that clear? 'Domiciled' is not the word mentioned here, and nor is it mentioned anywhere. And I recommend that you had best care what other people on WP think of you, because this is a collaborative community, and it can be very frustrating if people lose trust in you and start viewing every edit you make as POV-pushing.<a href="../../../h/o/r/User%7EHornplease_3cdc.html" title="User:Hornplease">Hornplease</a> 23:12, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Also, I mentioned an 'MBA' in the Naveen Andrews edit summary as an obvious analogy for another reason why someone would come here, for work-related reasons, temporarily, and for the same period Andrews has been here so far. If you failed to understand that point, I apologise. I should have realised that you would be reading it irritably and made it simpler. <a href="../../../h/o/r/User%7EHornplease_3cdc.html" title="User:Hornplease">Hornplease</a> 23:17, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Don't think that I havent observed this very carefully. Ragib and the other people involved in Bengal Wikiproject have taken the decision to trust you, and your little DYK project must have given them the impression that you're worth the investment. I personally admire your stamina, but think that your edits have shown a willingness to re-orient citations to serve whatever direction you wish an article to take too often. That in itself would not be a problem, if you werent so incredibly combative at the same time - something which I notice you carefully avoid when talking to other admins interested in India or Bengal. Fascinating. And where have I voted delete on avery Hindu-related AfD? I voted keep on Hindu Unity, I think, the second time it came up, and on many, many others. I voted delete on all religion-and-occupation cats, not just Hindu ones, and made the same argument on them all. Once again, you have chosen to be combative when it was unnecessary. <a href="../../../h/o/r/User%7EHornplease_3cdc.html" title="User:Hornplease">Hornplease</a> 23:25, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My objections arent to you removing citations that arent wp:rs. its that you, repeatedly, mischaracterise and misrepresent wp:rs sources. Over here, similarly, you are missing the point; you do this with such regularity that one is forced to assume you do it deliberately. While they are not tourists, they are <i>not immigrants</i> unless they are on an immigrant visa, which should be cited. Immigrants shows <i>inclination to settle</i>, a long-term permanent residency, as is explained on the appropriate page. This <i>does not apply</i> in this case. Please accept that and move on to your next little McCarthyesque war on the Marxists under every bush.<a href="../../../h/o/r/User%7EHornplease_3cdc.html" title="User:Hornplease">Hornplease</a> 23:42, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Also, about the CfD, my only contribution was to point out the <i>joint notability</i> criterion. That was all, and to suggest that you keep it in mind. <a href="../../../h/o/r/User%7EHornplease_3cdc.html" title="User:Hornplease">Hornplease</a> 23:42, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Please keep that article on your watchlist. I tried making some changes and was reverted. Apparently, some editors believe Pakistan was an independent country prior to 1947 and the spread of migrants from the IVC was an example of Pakistan having control and influence over India. Users try to make it seem like the Indus Valley Civilization was a Pakistani land which was far superior to a Gangetic Civilization which represented India. Wierd that we call ourselves Indians when the Indus Valley was a superior Pakistani civilization that had control over our lands. It also used to state something along the lines of "Ancient Pakistan as an Independent Country did..." when there was no such thing as Ancient Pakistan as an independent country. I discussed this with AfghanHistorian who agreed with my views. The so-called nation of "Ancient Pakistan" should be referred to as the Punjab region or you can say that the IVC lies in what is present day Pakistan and then refrain from mentioning either India or Pakistan.

<dd>I have done as you requested. My argument nevertheless remains weak, as there is so little evidence that says directly that SJSA is considered a national song of India, or that even Hindi speakers sing it, both of course which I'm pretty sure are true. If you have evidence for either point, could you provided it on the talk page?

<dd>It was a choice between assuming that you hadnt read it and that you had chosen to ignore it. I assumed good faith, as always, and attempted to help in my small way. Participating in a Hindu ceremony is not sufficient to indicate religious preference. You know as well as I do that Hindu politicians go to Sikh services, that Muslims attend church ceremonies, that atheists get married under Hindu rites. This is why the BLP category specifically states that they must self-identify. Find a statement where JS describes himself as a Hindu, and its fine. And having a BJP relative is no criterion! What, are Sikander Bakht's nephews Hindu now? <a href="../../../h/o/r/User%7EHornplease_3cdc.html" title="User:Hornplease">Hornplease</a> 21:35, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes but scope of the cat says "born as Hindus". Since he had a Hindu <b>coronation</b> (Nawabs dont have Hindu ceremonies), its obvious he was born a Hindu. Unless you find proof to the contrrary (meaning he converted to Islam, Xtianity, etc), he still is by law a Hindu. Therefore, he fits the guidelines of the cat. I think you are forgetting also <b>which</b> family he belongs to, that makes a difference. As a politician in <a href="../../../m/a/d/Madhya_Pradesh_a149.html" title="Madhya Pradesh">Madhya Pradesh</a>, religion based politics is the rule, with people like <a href="../../../u/m/a/Uma_Bharti_0f19.html" title="Uma Bharti">Uma Bharti</a> and <a href="../../../a/r/j/Arjun_Singh_7f0d.html" title="Arjun Singh">Arjun Singh</a> using religion to get votes.

<dd>I was pointing out the absurdity of your statement that he had a BJP relative as proof of his Hinduism. I think that he uses his family to get votes&lt; not his religion. (He is in the Congress, after all. Family, not religion, get it?) Be that as it may, my only point here is that wp:blp is stringent about it. The cat was written for anyone 'born Hindus', but that is insufficient per wp:blp, which was made policy after the cat was written.

<p>I am sure that JMC is a Hindu. But we cannot mark him as a Hindu politician without atleast one source confirming that he is. After all, our knowledge is OR. On that point Hornplease is correct.</p>
<p>"The subject's beliefs or sexual preferences are relevant to the subject's notable activities or public life" is a point with which I agree too. As far as I can see JMC's religion has nothing to do with his political life (or public life for that matter). But the scope that I defined made it open to include all Hindu politicians. I think we (as in you, hornplease, me and others) need to come to a consensus on whom to include in the cat. If we decide to include all hindus, irrespective of whether hinduism plays any role in their lives, then so be it. If that is the decision we come to, then also we need to make sure that there are sources confirming the fact.

That Tequendamia guy got blocked, used a sock to evade the block, vandalized the article and it got protected. It is a total disaster and I have requested unprotection.

<p>In the future, please do not substitute templates (or copy their code from the template page) unless you are directed to because they normally employ conditional code. I am aware that you may not normally do that, you only did it when you couldn't find the proper syntax for the {{<a href="../../../m/e/-/Template%7EME-project_fc5e.html" title="Template:ME-project">ME-project</a>}} tag (by typing {{ME-project}}, you would get the right tag).

<dd>Could you take a look at it? BhaiSaab was revert-warring there just now and I got confused as to which version says what.<a href="../../../h/k/e/User%7EHkelkar_b268.html" title="User:Hkelkar">Hkelkar</a> 03:57, 19 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Wahoo. I could also sign up for umpteen projects as well, anything to show for it? Any DYK's, FA's, or Stub to normal articles? Any actual edits that werent bad-faith reverts? By your logic I should join WikiProject Pakistan (at least I have two DYK's for that WP), or maybe even Wikiproject India, or for your purposes, Wikiproject Islam.<a href="../../../b/a/k/User%7EBakasuprman_bbab.html" title="User:Bakasuprman">Bakaman</a> <font color="blue"><sub><a href="../../../b/a/k/User_talk%7EBakasuprman_b63a.html" title="User talk:Bakasuprman">Bakatalk</a></sub></font> 04:25, 19 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm not assuming anything, I'm merely asking what you have to show for it. I actually wikified/wrote/expanded quite a few Bengal related articles before joining WP Bengal and WP Bangladesh, and I've been on wiki for way less time than you.<a href="../../../b/a/k/User%7EBakasuprman_bbab.html" title="User:Bakasuprman">Bakaman</a> <font color="blue"><sub><a href="../../../b/a/k/User_talk%7EBakasuprman_b63a.html" title="User talk:Bakasuprman">Bakatalk</a></sub></font> 04:30, 19 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm merely saying that you flaunting your membership at WP Hinduism like a badge is not fooling anyone, and challenging you to disprove me.
