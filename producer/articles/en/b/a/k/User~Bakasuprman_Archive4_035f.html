<p>Do you have more information about the temple? Unfortunately, Banglapedia doesn't list any ... I was wondering if you had any more info. I'll write to people from the region that I know if they have pictures of the temple.</p>

I've managed to get free-licensed pictures of the first, but not of the 2nd. Also, both articles could do some expansion / enhancement as well.

<p>Calling an organization "Anti-Hindu" on the first sentence only would work if the organization claims itself anti-Hindu.

<p>Hey, I thought you'd be interested in writing about the Sakta Pithas of Bengal, and Bangladesh. More information can be found <a href="http://banglapedia.search.com.bd/HT/S_0033.htm" class="external text" title="http://banglapedia.search.com.bd/HT/S_0033.htm" rel="nofollow">here</a>. I don't know much about the Shakta religious rituals and pithas, so perhaps you can add more, or ask others in WP Hinduism to help out there.</p>
<p>Also, there is a place called <a href="../../../l/a/n/Langalbandh.html" title="Langalbandh">Langalbandh</a> in <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bangladesh.html" title="Bangladesh">Bangladesh</a> which attracts the largest snaan's of Hindu devotees in Bangladesh.

Perhaps an article is due ... I've started it, but you can help in expanding it with info from other sources.</p>
<p>Sitakunda (in <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chittagong.html" title="Chittagong">Chittagong</a>) is another place. I don't know much about the mythology, but it seems like the naming has something to do with Sita. Of course, that'd be interesting, because <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chittagong.html" title="Chittagong">Chittagong</a> has a large Hindu population, but also a very large Buddhist population, and was one of the last bastions of Buddhism in the Subcontinent until the resurgence of the last century.</p>
<p>Hinduism in Bangladesh definitely has a long history. Too bad most people are ignoring that, and focusing on writing only about the recent negative events. So, if you have time, please help out forming these articles.</p>

<p>Hi, I'll try to get around to doing something on Muang Tum soon. I'm afraid I'm not a fan of the box- it's a bit ugly, and most of the Khmer temples have rather complex histories involving both Hinduism and Buddhism, which don't really fit into simple box categories. <a href="../../../h/e/n/User%7EHenry_Flower_de0f.html" title="User:Henry Flower">Henry</a><a href="../../../h/e/n/User_talk%7EHenry_Flower_b54b.html" title="User talk:Henry Flower"><sup>Flower</sup></a> 19:22, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Several issues. Temples such as the Bayon were remodelled several times over a long period, so to state one 'creator' or date is misleading. 'Primary deities' changed with each change of use, often several times (and in any case, Buddha is not a deity). And the orange colour associates the boxen with the other Hinduism boxen, which is hardly appropriate for the substantially Buddhist temples (and it's ugly). <a href="../../../h/e/n/User%7EHenry_Flower_de0f.html" title="User:Henry Flower">Henry</a><a href="../../../h/e/n/User_talk%7EHenry_Flower_b54b.html" title="User talk:Henry Flower"><sup>Flower</sup></a> 19:35, 31 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>1. I don't see the relevance, but since the sites had been inhabited for centuries before these temples were built, it seems unlikely. 2. A 'first completion' is hardly a completion, and is certainly not a completion of what one sees today. 3. Yes, but a deity and an idol are not the same thing. AFAIK Buddhists don't regard Buddha images as idols or deities anyway. 4. It was constructed as a Hindu temple, but has spent most of its existence as a Buddhist temple. (Mount Meru, incidentally, also occupies a rather significant place in Buddhist mythology). Trying to categorise it as Hindu or Buddhist is a gross oversimplification. 5. It is. <a href="../../../h/e/n/User%7EHenry_Flower_de0f.html" title="User:Henry Flower">Henry</a><a href="../../../h/e/n/User_talk%7EHenry_Flower_b54b.html" title="User talk:Henry Flower"><sup>Flower</sup></a> 19:47, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello and Thanks for your assistance.</p>
<p>Regarding this article - I posted my reasons for justification as to why there is no copyright violation. I also wrote this to Sfacets on his page. I have still not received any reply showing me why this reasoning is invalid. I think you have a situation here where Sfacets has unilaterally decided that there is a copyright violation.</p>
<p>Consequently, I believe a rewrite is not justified for two reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the legal sense, if indeed there is a copyright violation (one which as I state before has not been proven)</li>
</ul>
<p>just rewording an article does not remedy the problem</p>
<ul>
<li>An individual's "feeling" that there may be a copyright violation should not suffice as reason enough to</li>
</ul>
<p>zap an article and cause a whole lot of work for somebody else</p>
<p>A civil and just procedure would suggest that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sfacets provide his objective justification negating the validating items that I mention or</li>
<li>If he strongly feels a rewrite is necessary - he should commit the effort to pen this rewrite himself</li>
</ul>
<p>Else, this forum becomes much more a dictatorship than a democratic forum that it is meant to be.</p>
<p>Once again, thanks for your assistance and look forward to hearing your thoughts</p>

<p>I'm sorry. You've warned Freedom skies about blanking his page and have thus demonstrated your fairness on that issue. However, I feel obliged to point out that Rama's Arrow already warned Freedom skies against blanking his page in early July<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Freedom_skies&amp;diff=61964203&amp;oldid=57132845" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Freedom_skies&amp;diff=61964203&amp;oldid=57132845" rel="nofollow">[20]</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Freedom_skies&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=61964203" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Freedom_skies&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=61964203" rel="nofollow">[21]</a> and, to be frank, Freedom skies could use a word about civility as well.</p>
<p>Perhaps he'll be more receptive to someone he regards as a friend and ally. "Not assigning motives to users" is an issue that you might particularly discuss with him.</p>
<p>I was not accusing Rama's Arrow of being a sockpuppet of Freedom skies, nor you of being a sockpuppet of Subhash bose. I was pointing out how Rama's Arrow felt that, whatever else they had in common, Freedom skies needed to be reined in, much as you felt that Subhash bose needed to be reined in, despite whatever else you may agree on.<br />

<p>Hi - forgive the lengthy reply but verbosity is a disease that I am condemned to suffer.</p>
<p>Your improvement over civility is very good and encouraging, but the disputes are long-standing and intricate. Your comments are still tense. Its ok to feel outrage, but its not good to bottle it up. I can talk to you man-to-man about civility, but I just recently blew up at <a href="../../../r/l/e/User%7ERlevse_2b5d.html" title="User:Rlevse">user:Rlevse</a>, so its not like I can judge you or be a role model. I was bottling stuff up, so when he came along I couldn't keep it in even though I knew it was wrong. Although we universally stand against POV and incivility here, I know its pretty hard to control oneself.</p>
<p>You should study the way <a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen">Blnguyen</a> and <a href="../../../a/k/s/User%7EAksi_great_bb76.html" title="User:Aksi great">Akash</a> operate - these are the most civil people I know. They do a lot of work here, and are able to keep their emotions under full control despite many provocations. A good idea I can recommend for you is to take 2 weeks off, completely. I know its hard to not think about stuff happening on Wikipedia, but you can divert such temptations into something you love to do. Simply sit back and analyse what NPOV really means, not just here but in the real world. I did the same thing in October-November 2005, in order to find the correct way to end a very messy dispute I was in with <a href="../../../g/u/r/User%7EGurubrahma_62f8.html" title="User:Gurubrahma">Gurubrahma</a>. I did a lot of wrong stuff a year ago, and it was pretty hard to turn myself around but I did.</p>
<p>NPOV has many important implications in the real world, and working according to Wikpedia's goals can change the way you look at the world. It was very difficult, but I did succeed in changing my behavior and enjoy my work here. I know you feel a slight sense of loyalty to Subhash bose (which is ok, nothing wrong in that), which should help you help him. But you should relax generally, and the quagmire you're in is very thick. Take a short wikibreak. Then come back and work under the flag of <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a>, <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> and <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>.

<dd>Well its possible that Hindu politicians was voted to be deleted before Muslim politicians was voted to keep. Nichalp re-deleted the cat in August to uphold the previous decision. But if Muslim politicians exists, then obviously Hindu politicians is justified. I know it appears unreasonable, but Nichalp is a very good admin. Another point to take care of - you shouldn't have made such a comment, becoz it appears as if you are questioning his integrity becoz he's an Indian Christian.
