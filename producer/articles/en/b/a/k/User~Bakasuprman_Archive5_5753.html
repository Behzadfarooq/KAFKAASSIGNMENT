<p>There are an equal amount of users who don't support making wiki a soapbox for peoples anti-Hindu hatred.

<dd>You had posted this on User whoohookitty's page, at that time I wanted to stay of the topic, hence did not respond, now I will.</dd>
</dl>
<p>So what has anti Hindu hatred got to do with me&#160;? You and Neta called me a sock about a month ago, I responded, so if I deserve a block so do you. The discussion between Neta and me is between him and me, you are baiting by jumping in here so please do not go aound pointing out things that you are yourself indulging in.( and on every issue Neta get's involved in). So either get a life of your own and then maybe someone would think that you have some edits and you are not following one user around like a newbie or live with the tag of a lackey. You may have 5000 more edits, but to follow others lead shows a lack of confidence.<a href="../../../h/a/p/User%7EHaphar_4edd.html" title="User:Haphar">Haphar</a> 22:38, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>"Dada witnessed in his vision the destruction. He saw that very powerful bombs had been manufactured and were being fired. He saw guided missiles with warheads of such devastating potency that whole regions of earth were burnt up in a moment. Gigantic fireballs, cities in flame, unbearable storms of fire were raging everywhere. When he received his visions, America had not dropped the first atomic bombs:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Dada also saw how the death came slower through wars and civil wars, culminating in an awesome wave of natural catastrophes: floods and tidal waves, earthquakes of every kind wreaking havoc on the scarred face of the earth. Dada began to tremble uncontrollably upon witnessing the scenes of this great world wide destruction. Humans and animals were running wildly about, trying to save their lives, to escape from the jaws of death. But there was no escape. The wail of horror, the rivers of blood and pus, the panic and the desperation, and then, the final death." <a href="http://brahmakumaris.com/aboutus/divinevisions.htm" class="external free" title="http://brahmakumaris.com/aboutus/divinevisions.htm" rel="nofollow">http://brahmakumaris.com/aboutus/divinevisions.htm</a></dd>

<dd>Destruction was predicted for 1975/6 first, then 86 to 96 ... then 2000 ... they are still using it to encourage folk this year. Big re-write going on. Oh, let me tell you the bit about how at Destruction when all the billions are killed how the souls of the dead will all be trying to enter the bodies of any living human beings that are left ... Yup, it is all true.

<dd>Hello. I put the db tag as per the rule. The category had previously been deleted by consensus - See <a href="../../../c/a/t/Wikipedia%7ECategories_for_deletion_Log_2006_May_14_7a9d.html#Category:Hindu_politicians" title="Wikipedia:Categories for deletion/Log/2006 May 14">this</a>. Hence the db tag. It should have been sent to deletion review first. - <a href="../../../a/k/s/User%7EAksi_great_bb76.html" title="User:Aksi great">Aksi_great</a> (<a href="../../../a/k/s/User_talk%7EAksi_great_f9ab.html" title="User talk:Aksi great">talk</a> - <a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_Review_Aksi_great_4751.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor Review/Aksi great">review me</a>) 18:24, 2 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Till a clear criteria for inclusion is defined, I will keep my delete vote. It is good that you removed the sentence about the Sangh parivar and BJP. At present it is very unclear. Look at the reasoning given by <a href="../../../s/u/b/User%7ESubhash_bose_945d.html" title="User:Subhash bose">User:Subhash bose</a>. I have nothing against him, but you can see that what confusion can arise in the mind of anyone who visits the category. "There are many politicians in India and in other countries who are both of the Hindu faith as well as who campaign for issues that are pertinent and relevant to all Hindus regardless of sub-denomination". Does that mean that you are going to include people who are not Hindu but affiliated to Hindu causes (people like Shahnawaz Hussain - in BJP but not Hindu). "Members of the previouss center-right coalition govt, as well as members of various parties such as BJP definitely come under the category of Hindu politician." That means you, or others who will add people to the category are limiting yourself to certain kinds of people. Who should decide which people were center-right or otherwise? The main reason why the earlier category was deleted was because many politicians were added who were not Hindu. And what about Hindu politicians outside of India? Is this limited to India alone? If you can clarify the criteria for inclusion and keep a regular check on who should make it to the cat and who doesn't, then I am ready to change my vote. Hope you can see why I am concerned. - <a href="../../../a/k/s/User%7EAksi_great_bb76.html" title="User:Aksi great">Aksi_great</a> (<a href="../../../a/k/s/User_talk%7EAksi_great_f9ab.html" title="User talk:Aksi great">talk</a> - <a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_Review_Aksi_great_4751.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor Review/Aksi great">review me</a>) 18:57, 2 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>It would be reassuring to know that you will keep an eye on it. Anyways, I have gone ahead and expanded the criteria for inclusion. I am changing my vote to neutral on your assurance that POV will be kept out of this cat, and that all politicians will at some point be included to be a category of real importance. - <a href="../../../a/k/s/User%7EAksi_great_bb76.html" title="User:Aksi great">Aksi_great</a> (<a href="../../../a/k/s/User_talk%7EAksi_great_f9ab.html" title="User talk:Aksi great">talk</a> - <a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_Review_Aksi_great_4751.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor Review/Aksi great">review me</a>) 19:13, 2 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>By POV I would mean keeping politicians in the cat for only reasons that they have a pro-Hindu bias or are part of the Sangh or otherwise. In other words the cat should not end up with only politicians of the Hindutva ideology, because then it would not jusify the aim of the cat. But I can see now that this will not happen, as there are more people looking at the issue than previously. - <a href="../../../a/k/s/User%7EAksi_great_bb76.html" title="User:Aksi great">Aksi_great</a> (<a href="../../../a/k/s/User_talk%7EAksi_great_f9ab.html" title="User talk:Aksi great">talk</a> - <a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_Review_Aksi_great_4751.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor Review/Aksi great">review me</a>) 19:18, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Crazy Kenny has also written <i>Freedom skies, you should really watch out for what you put in big black bold letters about other people. Write another title like that and it's called vandalism... anyways, you're taking what i wrote out of context... first of all, the removal of bobby jindal occured late at night after a few beers and really, you must agree that bobby jindal really is not the most attractive person in the world. look at the guy's face! second, i did not state that i believe that the indian martial arts came from the middle east... nor have i ever written or edited a wikipedia article to that effect. what i did state was that the sources YOU quoted stated that the indian martial arts came from the middle east and yet you are not willing to put that on the last page. If you did your homework, and looked at the history of greek wrestling, the greek statues, pictures, sculptures and greek writing describes activities similar to greco-roman wrestling... pankration or something like that was what the greeks called it. as far as I can tell, you are the one who is prejudiced from your statements about the british destroying all martial arts in india and so forth along with you stating that you don't believe someone's scholarship is worthy because they are white.

<p>Thanks for your being frank and sporty.</p>
<p>With due apology, I take liberty to discuss something that one may consider to be personal. Since, you said you are NRI &amp; go to Swadhyay Kendra, I left because I feel that you are viewed or judged from the company you keep. I left more because, I prefer to be a sinner than hypocrite. I saw Dada using goondas in a meeting I was invited.</p>
<p>To me this was a medium of bringing back Vedic Culture or Ram Rajya for which I gave my young life at the cost of necessary entertainment, basic necessity, duty towards family, business and consequential earning and even submitting to blokes like people. There are thousands who did so.</p>
<p>I think, each one is right in not allowing this medium to rot. Where you see wrong, you have to speak that's your duty to your conscience and your Lord. I spoke, I am speaking.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Been in touch with Subhash Kak</span></h2>
<p>I asked Dr. Kak himself for a few sources, and he has written that if I took a look here<a href="http://www.ece.lsu.edu/kak/hist.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ece.lsu.edu/kak/hist.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> I should find a lot more info.</p>
<p>Plus, as for nationalist/biased POV, he said that his work has also appeared in many encyclopedias. For example, Stanley Wolpert - edited Encyc. of India (Scribner's, 2006). You can see the list of topics there at this site<a href="http://www.galegroup.com/pdf/Contributors/EncyIndiaContrib.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.galegroup.com/pdf/Contributors/EncyIndiaContrib.pdf" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>.</p>
<p>As you know, Wolpert is a very conservative historian, and not a supporter of "Hindu nationalism."</p>
<p>Make use of the list, and don't let anyone vandalize cited material because it's out of their comfort zone, I'll be involved in a tour and may not be able to do so for the next two or three days, but you should be abe to find a bit more of citations and other material using Dr. Kak's information, as well as cite the Wolpert endorsement if Dr. Kak.</p>

<p>Dear Bakaman,</p>

Some Freakofnurture claiming to be administrator removed my writing about "Swadhyay" and re-directed the page to "Swadhyay Pariwar". Superdosh tried to talk to me and did not do any edit.</p>
<p>I fail to understand why Freakofnurture did so? I am worried that suppose I revert his actions and as he claims to be administrator, could he ban me?</p>
<p>Could you advise me what should I do. He does not seem to be Indian and I think neither cares to understand right meaning of "Swadhyay" and my preventing the page to be re-directed to "Swadhyay Pariwar". I am putting a note of his page.</p>

<p>Hey Baka:</p>
<p>I've reverted the original content and posted some text from the two companies (who used this on their website) e-mails I received verifying there is no copyright issue here.</p>
<p>There is also a posting from user Sanevoice regarding this on the Wiki page.</p>
<p>Appreciate your effort in trying to at least replace some text in the interim period.</p>
<p>It would be good if you (or forward to admin) could ensure that this content does not get deleted at the whim of some self-appointed copyright expert.</p>
<p>Thanks and Best Regards</p>

<p>Zora is wrong in her reasoning and in stereotyping you like this, but I don't see any need to create Hindu categories without prior discussion. In the CfD discussion about Hindu politicians it was clear to me that many see such categories as fragmentation and over-classification, so it will be helpful if you create categories after talking to some people, on a need basis. At least this way the categories won't have to end up facing 5-day heated CfD debates.</p>

I'm not entirely sure about the evacuation, as Israel has done a number of those from different places; is there anything in Category:Non-combat military operations of Israel that matches? <a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirill_Lokshin_7618.html" title="User:Kirill Lokshin">Kirill Lokshin</a> 01:52, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

I am copy pasting a blog which has media articles and pictures regarding murder of Pankaj Trivedi. All the media articles are in Gujarati - a language of State of Gujarat, India and you may not be able to see the fonts or understand them. The pictures showing fat lady in Saree is Jayshree Talwalkar. She is projected as God Mother. The pictures do contain snap of Pankaj Trivedi. The murderers. Lady with folded hand is a snap of funeral time. The Sadhu in orange cap and clothes is Swami Sachchidandji who protested against police in-action. The old man is Pandurang Shashtri Athavale. In initial two pictures and in the end you can see Jayshree Talwalkar and behind her is Bharat Bhat (in circle) who is now arrested and have confessed ploting of the murder of Pankaj Trivedi. He is one from the closest circle of Jayshree Talwalkar. Picture of Pankaj Trivedi follows the funeral pictures. The bare chested person in funeral snap is Pankaj Trivedi's son Himanshu.</p>

<p>I hope that you went through the blog. It's giving pictures of magazines and articles. The writing is in Gujarati but it's convincing that the claim of murder of Pankaj Trivedi by Swadhyay Pariwar is no bluff.</p>
<p>The actual source like Yahoo etc. is being removed by some un-named user along with critical links of Jagrut Parivar or swadhyayee.org</p>
<p>Anyway, thanks for the interest and suggestion.</p>

<p>12/09/2006.</p>
<p>Someone changed my neutral article on Swadhyay and you have modified the same, wrongfully glorifying and identifying SP as Swadhyay. Now, they have started killing people in the name of protection of Vedic Culture. They have threatened to rape daughter-in-law of Prof.S.K.Joshi in front of her husband and father-in-law if his father-in-law did not stop exposing wrongs. What Prof.S.K.Joshi on Dada's asking said that the Mahalaxmi of Prayogs should be used in villages.</p>
<p>If, their malicious motives are not achieved with moderate means they surpass any criminal organisation to achieve their goals.</p>
<p>Swadhyay is a word having a different meaning.</p>
<p>Pl. don't help them in creating black history.</p>
