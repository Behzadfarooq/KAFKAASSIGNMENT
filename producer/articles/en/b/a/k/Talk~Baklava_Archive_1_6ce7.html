<p>The first and third paragraphs contain somewhat redundant and sometimes conflicting material. The third paragraph is also non-grammatical. Possible solutions include merging them into one paragraph or creating two paragraphs: one on what baklava is and the other on how it is made.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Lebanese?</span></h2>
<p>At least now the bizarre version with an "r" in it (where did that come from?) has been fixed. But as "Arab" is already mentioned, surely adding "Lebanese" is unnecessary? In addition, giving the Lebanese (and Syrian and Palestinian) version of the name seems unnecessary when we already have the fusha.</p>
<p>Really, the whole list seems over-long and redundant. Could we not just say "Middle Eastern and Balkan" and cut out all the nationalities and different languages? I think there is no very good argument for giving 15 foreign language names of a type of food. <a href="../../../p/a/l/User%7EPalmiro_d72a.html" title="User:Palmiro">Palmiro</a> | <a href="../../../p/a/l/User_talk%7EPalmiro_7aea.html" title="User talk:Palmiro">Talk</a> 19:08, 4 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That would easily offend all the different countries that have developed their own subtle variations on what they consider <i>their</i> dish (shared among others). If it were a truly worldwide dish (like hamburgers or cornflakes) I could see the list being removed. But baklava is limited primarily to a (relatively) small geographical area that spans from Bosnia to Persia. However, if the list clutters the top too much, references to various national versions and their names can be placed further down. Additionally, the Arab identity of the <a href="../../../l/e/b/Lebanon.html" title="Lebanon">Lebanese people</a> <a href="../../../m/a/r/Maronite.html" title="Maronite">is</a> <a href="../../../p/h/o/Phoenicians.html" title="Phoenicians">controversial</a>, and (as would be the same case for Maltese topics) would deserve separate mention for those who do not regard (and would even be offended by the implication of) Lebanese tradition as being an Arab tradition. - <a href="../../../g/i/l/User%7EGilgamesh_f381.html" title="User:Gilgamesh">Gilgamesh</a> 02:35, 5 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hmm. Comparing the Arab identity of the Lebanese with the (non-existent) Arab identity of the Maltese, just because the latter speak an Arabic-derived language, strikes me as potentially even more controversial. What is the basis for the name given in Latin script after the citation of Lebanese?</p>
<p>I agree that if we have to mention all these variations then it should indeed be further down. Also, if we mention Lebanon separately then we should also mention Syria, Jordan and Palestine. <a href="../../../p/a/l/User%7EPalmiro_d72a.html" title="User:Palmiro">Palmiro</a> | <a href="../../../p/a/l/User_talk%7EPalmiro_7aea.html" title="User talk:Palmiro">Talk</a> 18:14, 5 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Agreed on Syria, Jordan and Palestine, if they indeed have traditions of baklava. (Though I Googled "Palestinian-baklava" and got nothing.) Anyway, I got the help of a friend from Beirut. She suggested that "Arab cuisine" is far too broad and divergent (like saying "European cuisine" or "African cuisine") and we should stick to the individual cultures that have baklava. Different parts of the Arab world have all sorts of different kinds of cuisine, and baklava can't be described as a universal "Arab cuisine" any more than falafel or couscous, which (like baklava) are largely regional and shared with neighboring cultures. The mention of the Standard Arabic word is still relevant, however, as almost <em>all</em> the different languages' names derive from it anyway. But it's still important to note that although the modern <i>words</i> for baklava are Arabic, the origin of the food is older than the Arab presence in the region. - <a href="../../../g/i/l/User%7EGilgamesh_f381.html" title="User:Gilgamesh">Gilgamesh</a> 06:25, 6 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually, I agree that "arab cuisine" is too broad a category, as there's only limited correspondence between, say, Moroccan, Syrian-Lebanese-Palestinian, and Yemeni cuisine (for example). There are even Yemeni restaurants here in Damascus, which appear to have a certain exotic allure (although it somewhat escapes me, as the choices on the menu amount to chicken and rice or meat and rice. Hope there are no Yemenis reading this and about to tear me apart for underappreciation of their culinary heritage). "Levantine cuisine" would be quite accurate. I can assure you that the Palestinians and Syrians have baklava, the Syrians in particular have some of the best in the world! <a href="../../../p/a/l/User%7EPalmiro_d72a.html" title="User:Palmiro">Palmiro</a> | <a href="../../../p/a/l/User_talk%7EPalmiro_7aea.html" title="User talk:Palmiro">Talk</a> 19:37, 6 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Really? Being from Yemen, I would know that rice and chicken is not the most popular dish in Yemen although it is good enough to eat everyday, don't know what problem you would have with that&#160;:); <a href="http://www.yementimes.com/article.shtml?i=727&amp;p=lastpage&amp;a=1" class="external text" title="http://www.yementimes.com/article.shtml?i=727&amp;p=lastpage&amp;a=1" rel="nofollow">saltah</a> is the national favorite. But, many Yemeni restaurants in Yemen and elsewhere do serve rice as the main choice because rice is universal as opposed to very "exotic" dish items like aaseed (cooked dough) with maraq (brown chicken stew) and saltah. Anyway, I agree that Arab cuisine is too broad of a catergory because Shami dishes are not usually made in Southern Arab coutries or North African countires, or not as much. Actually, while in Yemen I never seen a falafel, hummus, or baklawa; too bad they're missing out. --<a href="../../../i/n/a/User%7EInahet_e93c.html" title="User:Inahet">Inahet</a> 09:06, 28 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>And, I wonder if bakalawa has any "relation" to a very popular Yemeni pastry called sahn. Both consist of layers of thin pastry dough and melted clarified butter, and then topped with a sweet liquid (a little honey is used on sahn).

<dd>It's amazing how some people can turn a discussion about baklava into one about the Arab identity of the Lebanese. No offense, Gilgamesh. And about your friend's comment, if "Arab cuisine" is too wide of a descriptor, then "Lebanese cuisine" is much too narrow. I would suggest a "Levantine cuisine" category but that would be kind of original research. <a href="../../../y/u/b/User%7EYuber_3068.html" title="User:Yuber">Yuber</a><sup><small><a href="../../../y/u/b/User_talk%7EYuber_629b.html" title="User talk:Yuber"><font color="#FF8C00">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 20:25, 6 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I thought that was probably what had happened all right!

<p>What is traditionally used as fat in making baklava? Most stuff of good quality here in Syria says on the box "made with pure animal fat", and I suppose that could refer to butter, but I'm not sure.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
<p>The current history section traces baklava to the Assyrians and then the Greeks. What is the source for this? In Alan Davidson's 'Oxford Companion to Food', Charles Perry (called "the leading authority on early Arabic cookery") has a quite different story in the 'baklava' and 'filo' articles. He says that filo (yufka) is 'clearly of Turkish origin' and gives no indication that it existed before Ottoman times in Greece, Armenia, etc. Does anyone have better sources? (Note that cookbooks are usually 'terrible' sources for history, often repeating baseless legends....) --<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacrakis_14b1.html" title="User:Macrakis">Macrakis</a> 22:00, 28 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Well the source of the Oxford Companion to Food is well researched and referrs to the "Divan-i Lugat-it Turk" which is a massive compilation of Literature written over 1000 years ago in Kashgar which is in the Uygur region of China so it is reliable and historical.</p>

<hr />
<p>Baklava is not made out of Phillo pastry, this is incorrect it is made out of a special regional pastry of Damascus/Halab/GaziAntep.</p>
<p>The earliest record of baklava as we know it today locates it in Damascus, from which city it spread to Gaziantep and from there to the rest of Turkey. By the 17th century at least the fame of baklava had spread to Istanbul, since towards the end of that century baklava was being made by the palace cooks as a special treat for the janissaries in Ramazan. The janissaries carried the trays of baklava out of the palace in what was known as the Baklava Procession.</p>
<p>This desert is home to the region's I stated above, it is a speciallity. The reason for this is that there is a special type of Pistachio, it is called Antep Fistigi or Sham Fistigi in Turkey. This refers to GaziAntep Pistachio and Sham meaning Damascus region Pistachio.</p>
<p>It must be Fresh! not Dried, this is extremely expensive, the desert uses special regional spices and ingrediants, these can only be found with this taste in the region!</p>
<p>The price of real authentic Baklava of this region starts £15/20 a kilogram and rises depending on its quality.</p>
<p>Even in other area's of Turkey or the Arab World this desert cannot be made to the expertise of the region.</p>
<p>Everyone know's that the best Baklava can only be found in the three very close by area's I stated above this goes back to ancient Assyrian times!</p>
<p>The desert that is sold in other region's is not Baklava, I have visited other restaurant's this desert is not Baklava it is an imitation and would not be allowed in any kitchen of Antep/Halab/Damascus.</p>
<p>People fly this speciality dish over to their Wedding's and eat it on special occasions.</p>
<p>Sadly due to neglagence this food of the King's is being distorted and bastarsized into a cheap, non-cullinary dish in the West, which is a real shame to my home region.</p>
<p>However, the GaziAntepliler and Damascus and Halab/Allepo chef's will not allow this and we are on a mission to give you in the West the real Baklava and let you discover why it is the Food of the Sultan's.</p>
<p>I have a restaurant opening in London soon, my family has premises in Germany, the word baklava will become synomonous with GaziAntep.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Official Objective Source for Baklava, Filo pastry and its origins</span></h2>
<p>"Filo is the Greek name for a dough of many paper-thin layers separated by films of butter...Although known to Europeans and North Americans by a Greek name, the dough is clearly of Turkish origin. The medieval nomad Turks had an obsessive interest in making layered bread, possibly in emulation of the thick oven breads of city people. As early as the 11th century, a dictionary of Turkish dialects (Diwan Lughat al-Turk) recorded pleated/folded bread as one meaning of the word yuvgha, which is related to the word (yufka) which means a single sheet of file in modern Turkish. This love of layering continues among the Turks of Central Asia...The idea of making the sheets paper thins is a later development.The Azerbaijanis make the usual sort of baklava with 50 or so layers of filo, but they also make a...pastry called Baki pakhlavasi (Baku-style baklava) using ordinary noodle paste instead of filo...This may represent the earliest form of baklava, resulting form the Turkish nomads adapting their concept of layered bread--developed in the absence of ovens...If this is so, baklava actually pre-dated filo, and the paper-thin pastry we know today was probably an innovation of the Ottoman sultan's kitchens at Topkapi palace in Istanbul. There is an established connection between the Topkapi kitchens and baklava; on the 15th of Ramadan every year, the Janissary troops stationed in Istanbul used to march to the palace, where every regiment was presented with two trays of baklava. They would...march back to their barracks in what was known as the Baklava Procession." ---Oxford Companion to Food, Alan Davidson [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 1999 (p. 299)</p>

Etymology is replete with false derivations from naive researchers, and people often forget to account for historical cross-language mutation when assuming derivations based on modern tongues. This requires serious research of old texts, not scarfing casual website info.)

<hr />
<p>I don't think using a Greek author on such matter's is very reliable or objective <b>Vryonis (1971)</b> Especially regarding the 70's were highly charged years for Greek Nationalism, not to mention a bias slant may be added and they are quite well known for pretty audacious claims.</p>
<p>Therefore, non Greek/Turkish/Arab etc author's should be used as their bound to have a slight nationlist bias or slant.</p>
<p>The other two sources are objective and have some strong sources and facts to back up the claims. It seems that Baklava originated in Central Asia. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnstevens5_b4da.html" title="User:Johnstevens5">Johnstevens5</a></p>

<dd>The article as written <i>explicitly</i> says that Vryonis's identification was challenged by Perry. So what's the problem? --<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacrakis_14b1.html" title="User:Macrakis">Macrakis</a> 17:31, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>The problem is Vryonis is a Greek and therefore cannot be deemed objective or free of bias as he is taking Perry's objective work as some sort of challenge or attack while the author has simply researched and provided factual and very credible sources towards the matter.</p>
<p>Therefore Vryonis should not be used as a reliable source, it wouldn't be hard to find a Turkish or Arab author claiming the dessert to their own nation.</p>
<p>Its just Food Nationalism, very silly if you ask me and needless.</p>
<p>From the non-Greek objective source's there is a clear Central Asian link to Baklava and the Ottomans seemed to have had a Baklava Celebration day and created what is today known as the dessert mentioned, so there is a strong thesis to the Turkic origins of this dish.</p>
<p>Remember, this is an Encyclopedia its reliable source's and facts to back them up which matter not subjective opinions.</p>

<p>I agree entirely that food nationalism is very silly. But I ask that you re-read the text of the article. It says that Vryonis had a certain theory. It then says that Perry disproved the theory. Vryonis cannot have taken Perry's work as a challenge or attack because Vryonis's article was written <i>before</i> Perry's. As for Vryonis's credentials, after getting his Ph.D. at Harvard, he was a professor at UCLA then NYU. The cited book is a scholarly study. He was apparently wrong about baklava, but it is worth mentioning his book precisely so that people will understand which arguments have been refuted. --<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacrakis_14b1.html" title="User:Macrakis">Macrakis</a> 00:10, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Based on the recent EU debacle, food nationalism is clearly part of the history of baklava. Our responsibility is to provide a <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral</a> summary of the material available. It would be nice if we had a neutral source, but it is acceptable to include likely non-neutral sources so long as (A) they are <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable</a> by Wikipedia standards, which, very loosely speaking, means they are respectable enough for mainstream (not vanity) publishers; and (B) we make an effort to present all sides of the issue, citing these sources properly to allow readers to verify the information. Rather than simply delete properly sourced material, it would be better to add properly sourced balancing material. ~ <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffq_074c.html" title="User:Jeffq">Jeff Q</a>&#160;<a href="../../../j/e/f/User_talk%7EJeffq_cdb7.html" title="User talk:Jeffq">(talk)</a> 02:37, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The methodology with which I approach the topic is that it seems that especially the Greeks or Greek Cypriots are using nationalism in regard's to food by claiming a dessert shared by a wide geographical area as soley their invention.</p>
<p>This is the reason why I'm sceptacal of <b>Vryonis</b>, as a Greek there is a motivation there for bias and to be a little economic with the truth to present the food as being their's.</p>
<p>However, from the non-Greek/non-Turk author's it is very clear that most material, source's and factual evidence points towards Central Asia as the origins of the dessert.</p>
<p>The origins therefore seem pretty clear.</p>
<p>The next point to be highlighted is that Baklava as it is known today reached this stage in the Ottoman Kitchen's.</p>

<dl>
<dd>Johnstevens5, nothing is clear without <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>. Claiming bias neither proves the bias nor invalidates properly researched material. This is not a "methodology" for uncovering fact. All you say above is personal attestation without evidence, which anyone can do, saying anything they want. That's why we (A) don't accept personal opinions and theories, and (B) require material from reputable publishers. I know it's easier to make arguments than it is to prove them, but we need <i>all</i> sides of controversial issues to put forth the effort to back up their statements with evidence. From the current text of the article (per Perry, <i>not</i> Vryonis), it looks like the Turkish claims are not quite definitive. Surely there are reliable sources to fill in this apparent gap in the Turkish-origin argument? ~ <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffq_074c.html" title="User:Jeffq">Jeff Q</a>&#160;<a href="../../../j/e/f/User_talk%7EJeffq_cdb7.html" title="User talk:Jeffq">(talk)</a> 22:35, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>All I'm saying is that non-Greek/non-Turk source's and material point to a Central Asian connection, similar recipies were written in the <b>Diwan Lughat al-Turk</b> written around a 1000 or more years ago and in Yuan Dynasty Chinease cook book in 1330 and seen as though the first Turkic/Central Asian migrations to Azerbaijan area where sometime Before Christ, this thin pastry making tradition may have been bought some time during the migrations as its called the missing link.</p>
<p>Perry does include many sources and alot of evidence for his claims in the book writting directly about the subject, I'll pick these out and present them.</p>
<p><a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnstevens5_b4da.html" title="User:Johnstevens5">Johnstevens5</a></p>
<p>Johnstevens5 -- I <i>agree</i> with you. Perry's argument is good, and it is reported in the article. So what is the problem? Part of the historiography of 'baklava' is Vryonis's statement, which is still believed by many people. It is better, I think, to include the Vryonis claim and show that it has been superceded than to ignore it and have people think Perry didn't address it. Remember, NPOV means <i>reporting on</i> different claims. --<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacrakis_14b1.html" title="User:Macrakis">Macrakis</a> 17:13, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>since when turks knew baklava?? it was inrodused after the arab invasion to asia. mangolia where the turks or the ottoman presented. arabs roled the turks for more than 10 centures, and it was before the invasion of costantinapole or istanbul. as far as i know, assyria is the home land of arabs and we can say now the arabs knew it first. baklava widly known to turks and the rest of europe after the expansion of islam. same as other arabic food such as: mosaka'a(means:cooled in arabic), loqama(bit or swollow), halwa(means sweet in arabic), kanafa, tahene, etc. contains arabic meaning and not turkish or greek. as much as it has meaning in arabic language, then baklava arabic for sure. b.t.w all turkish and greek food is actuily&#160;:bayn nahrayn (mesopotamia) arabic food.</p>
<dl>
<dd>No, no, no. Baklava is either Turkish or Greek in origin. If it was Arabic in origin, then why is baklava and some of the other other dishes/items you named not an integral part of the cuisines of the Arabian Peninsula countries (the supposed native land of early Arabs)? And Arabs are NOT the originators of everything that comes from the Middle East.

<p>not trying to make an insult for any nation. It is arabic origin and the dishes i presented are the typical arabic cuisine in all arabian peninsula, it is syrian, lebanese, iraqi, saudi, jordanian, pelasinian, Kuwait etc. arabs lineage came from <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assyria.html" title="Assyria">assyria</a>, <a href="../../../p/h/o/Phoenicia.html" title="Phoenicia">phoenicia</a>, palestine and other parts from mesopotamia. another thing, if baklava and many many other dishes has turkish or greek origin, then why those dishes has arabic names and arabic meaning. i have many turkish and greek friends. i have asked them if this cuisine names does mean anything in their languages. they say NO IDEA WHAT DOES thos names mean. but when i asked my arabic friends they told me the meaning and that what make me think so. <i>useful web sites for arabic cuisine:</i></p>

<p>Are you implying that Assyrians and Phoenicians are Arabs? They are not, they are seperate Semetic peoples who may have migrated from their native land in the Arabian Peninsula to the Fertile Crescent and the Mediterranean. But they had their own language, culture, etc. I believe Assyrian is still spoken today in some parts of the Middle East. My point is that their contributions cannot be attributed to the Arabs because they are simply not Arabs and never were.</p>
<p>But, you're right about the dishes having Arabic names with Arabic roots. The only explaination that I can think of is that perhaps Arabs popularized the Arabic names for the dishes and then eventually the original names died out. Also, I do think that some of the Middle Eastern dishes are Arab in origin, but also some are from Turkish, Greek, Assyrian, etc. --<a href="../../../i/n/a/User%7EInahet_e93c.html" title="User:Inahet">Inahet</a> 22:44, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

i didn't mean that assyrians phoenicians are arabs, what i am saying is that <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arab.html" title="Arab">arab</a> are assyrians in origin, if we go further back in history. arabs and thier language origin came from assyria from petra( jordan nowaday) and petra was the first capital of arabs. that means we can call arabs as assyrian or the other way round. what i know all semetics are cousins, and their languages fairly similar. you may think arabs are yemenite, but in fact there are not, yemenite are mixed arabs. let's get back to our point. everything in this world is named after the people who invented it, and knew it first, and the name will never dies. i'll give you examples. i'll try to mention what could be turkish (dolma for example) it is turkish, and that due to the shape of dolma(more asian style), it look like more similar to japanese sushi, and it doesnt have arabic name. why didn't it changes to arabic name? how about greek food,feta is greek and the name feta is greek, why it not calling feta with arabic name? because it is not arabic. b.t.w all greeks beleive that all their food is turkish origin. why is that? due to the expansion of ottoman impire to greece, and no one can deny that. but what greeks may don't know that the ottoman was ruled by arabs for centureis , and no one can deny how arabs influenec turks in religion, culture, dressing, language etc. it goes like that, started from arabs then turks then greeks for. also from arabs then greeks then turks. arabs also borrowed turkish food such as dolma only. arabs borrowed feta only from greece, maybe i missed few, but the rest is arabic named food. starting from mezze's, main corse and ending up with dessert. as i said, everything in this world is named after the people who invented it, and knew it first, and the name will never dies. i know it's silly of talking about food nationalism but we all want to know the trueth. trueth can be figuered by studying history. --194.54.223.9 01:48, 8 July 2006 (UTC)memo</p>
<p>The etymology of a thing (food or other) is one useful piece of information in studying its history. But only one piece. Anyway, since Wikipedia is not a place for <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>, instead of making arguments like this, you should work on finding good published sources for your position, and cite them. --<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacrakis_14b1.html" title="User:Macrakis">Macrakis</a> 08:14, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>From what I know, <a href="../../../p/e/t/Petra.html" title="Petra">Petra</a>, the <a href="../../../n/a/b/Nabataean.html" title="Nabataean">Nabataean</a> capital, has nothing to do with Assyria or Assyrians. Petra was never part of the Assyrian realm. Although Assyrians and other Semite groups like Canaanites may have come from the Arabian Peninsula, it would be erroneous to call them Arabs because as I said before they have their own culture, language, history, so you cannot call Assyrians Arabs or Arabs Assyrians; see <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assyria.html" title="Assyria">Assyria</a>. You said that Arabs came from Petra -- well that is a new theory I never heard. Are you suggesting that Arabs originated in what is now West Jordan and groups of Arabs migrated south and eventually populated the Arabian Peninsula?</p>
<p>Anyway, it is suggested that Nabataeans migrated from Southern Arabia (Yemen) to what is now Wadi Musa, Jordan. So Nabataeans are (perhaps) Yemenites&#160;:D. Also, you say Yemenites are mixed Arabs yet some genealogists put Yemenites as the pure Arabs <a href="../../../q/a/h/Qahtan.html" title="Qahtan">Qahtan</a> and the north Arabs as Arabized Arabs <a href="../../../a/d/n/Adnan.html" title="Adnan">Adnan</a>. --<a href="../../../i/n/a/User%7EInahet_e93c.html" title="User:Inahet">Inahet</a> 04:38, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
as i said, if we go further back in history, and to keep in mind, i need you to look more about the history in <a href="../../../y/e/m/Yemen.html" title="Yemen">yemen</a> and <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arab.html" title="Arab">arab</a>, just to remind you that qahtanite origin came from the land of aram but they sattled in yemen. and adnatite are defined to the arabs who descent of ishmaeal. so all of them has an origin from mesopotamia. in nowadays they are known as arabs. simply, all part of mesopotamia are the known as the ancient arabs and hebrew, as long as they have semetic languages they are known as arabs and hebrew&#160;:) i think the conversation was converted to racism way instead of food nationalism, i was expecting from you to talk more about the exaples of the real turkish food (dolma) and why it was named in turkish language and not arabic??? while the others dishes has arabic names&#160;:) --194.54.235.2 16:22, 10 July 2006 (UTC)memo</p>
<p>What do you mean by racism??? Anyway I can't answer your questions regarding baklava and other dishes with Arabic names because I don't know the answers. You need reliable sources to back up your claims, as Macrakis suggested. The etymology is important but it reveals little of the development and origin of the dish in question. If you can find a good source, then you're welcome to make any additions to the article. --<a href="../../../i/n/a/User%7EInahet_e93c.html" title="User:Inahet">Inahet</a> 20:07, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

hey guys, sorry for not replying for long, I was in a vacation, it was absolutely fantastic&#160;:&gt; so where were we? ah, yeah ,first, what i meant by racism that our conversation was converted into race, and i've just suggusted to talk about the main subject.</p>
<p>now, i have some sources i want you to look at: this web site tells you the history of Arabs influence to the Turkish cuisine. And I've copied the article for you, and leave you to read it <a href="http://food.oregonstate.edu/ref/culture/chrones.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://food.oregonstate.edu/ref/culture/chrones.html" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>:</p>
<p>Through trade and eventual warfare, Turks encountered the Arabs, and eventually converted to Islam. Through exposure to the Arabs, Persians, and their conversion to Islam the Turkish culture underwent a great change. Islam stressed the community of believers over ethnic or language differences. Moslems accepted converted Turks as brothers upon their conversion. Turks gained entry into a culture that was urban, unified, and highly developed culturally. In addition, the Turks were linchpins for the ancient silk roads, which introduced the spices and eating styles of the far east into Anatolia. On the one hand, Turks encountered the highly developed culinary court culture of the Arabs. Islam celebrated the senses, in contrast to Christian Europe which often taught that life was to be endured upon earth, celebration of the senses means the physical, sensual, and poetic enjoyment of food. Additional exposure to the remarkable cargo of the silk road, introduced even more culinary nuances through exotic spices from Asia. The Turkish style of eating by the time the Ottomans came to power was a combination of Arabic refinement and nomadic Asiatic eating style. Portable flat low tables define nomadic mobility, a dining style still common in eastern Turkey today. Handkerchiefs, napkins, perfumed water for washing hands, and elegant speech at the table are direct Persian and Arabic court influences. The exposure to Arabic culture and conversion to Islam had a profound influence upon culinary culture. Turks changed from hunters and pastoral people to an urban sensibility and lifestyle. Through Arabic cuisine, Turks learned about sugarcane cultivation, distillation of sugar, and confectionery. Sugar syrup in desserts, jams, sherbets and fruit drinks came into their repertoir You can check it out at&#160;: <a href="http://food.oregonstate.edu/ref/culture/chrones.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://food.oregonstate.edu/ref/culture/chrones.html" rel="nofollow">[7]</a></p>
<ul>
<li>now since the arabs introduced syrup,sugar,spices and pestry to turkish, how come baqlawa is turkish in origin?</li>
<li>don't you agree that turkish are infuenced by arabic ciusine, culture, language etc?</li>
</ul>
<p>Other sources to provide you with information I've talked about: Unique specialties of Turkish cuisine make souvenirs from a trip. "Lokum," a gelled sweet often mixed with hazelnuts or pistachios, is cut into cubes and rolled in powdered sugar. In the United States it is commonly called Turkish delight. Rose, banana, and eggplant liqueur are savored. Sweet hot red pepper paste, Muhammara, notes the Arabic influence.<a href="http://www.cyprus.com/cyprus-culture-cuisine.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cyprus.com/cyprus-culture-cuisine.php" rel="nofollow">[8]</a> other more sources for you about turkish food and how it was influenced by arabic.

I need you now to explain to me what are your evidences of claiming baklawa is Turkish? Baqlawa has arabic name first of all, second, it has been known in the arab region since ancient time of Mesopotamia. Tell me which civilisation is older in history turk or mesopotamia?

<p>The History of Baklava</p>
<p>Many groups claim Baklava as their own. However, a check of the history of baklava yields surprising results. It is widely believed that it is of Assyrian origin.</p>
<p>Around approximately the 8th century B.C., Assyrians baked thin layers of dough with nuts, poured honey over it, and enjoyed this sumptuous treat.</p>
<p>Baklava was baked only on special occasions, usually by the rich who could afford such a luxury. A poor man used to exclaim, "I am not rich enough to eat Baklava in my house." Things have changed over the years. Now, you can order baklava anytime and you do not have to be a millionaire to enjoy the great taste.</p>
<p>Ancient Romans and other cultures threw walnuts instead of rice at weddings because they believed walnuts held aphrodisiac powers. They also used in in fertility rites. On a side note, chick peas (garbanzos) are also viewed as an aphrodisiac for men. Chick peas are the main ingredient in hoummous (hummus) bi tahini. Pine nuts have also been viewed as an aphrodisiac for over 2000 years. Whether these three foods help you or not, they are a very tasty part of the ingredients we use to make our Lebanese food.</p>
<p>The history of Baklava changed with the history of the land. The Near and Middle East saw many civilizations come and go. Baklava and the recipe had spread to the Near East, Armenia, and Turkey. With the advent of the Grecian Empire, it spread westward to Greece. Phyllo dough is named after the greek word for "leaf", being "as thin as a leaf". The thickness (or for that matter, the thinness) of Phyllo gives baklava is delicious crispy taste.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Surely Mesopotamian but not Turkish or Greek (??? who says that on which basis)</span></h2>
<p>A word doesnt become arabic cause somebody says that it is arabic seeming or sounds like arabic? "Bakla" is the same in Turkish and arabic but arabic dictionaries refute the link between bakla and baklava. I am sorry for that.</p>
<p>thats the funniest thing i've ever heared. (Arabic-seeming name, it is of Turkish origin). how come? then why not coffee,sugar and cotton are arabic-seeming name with turkish origin?</p>
<p>why don't we talk about what was turkey before the arab alliance with the mangolians. arabs shared thier culture, food, spices, and evrything they knew to the ottoman. i could say the ottoman empire was built thanks to the arabs. come on everybody know that</p>
<p>p.s Mesopotamia is the home of the semetics (Arabs, Hebrew) including all mesopotamian people.</p>

<p>Alan, welcome to Wikipedia. I see this is your first contribution. Wikipedia tries hard to find good-quality, ideally scholarly, sources for articles. The current baklava article references several scholarly sources on the history of baklava. These sources indicate that it is not originally Greek, but Turkic or Mongolian. If you have good sources for the theory that it is of Mesopotamian, Assyrian, or Arabic origin, please contribute them. Random Web pages are in general <i>not</i> good sources, especially since we currently cite scholarly material. --<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacrakis_14b1.html" title="User:Macrakis">Macrakis</a> 19:30, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Arabic word /baqlah/ and /baqlaawa/</span></h2>
<p><b>Etymology:</b>(<a href="../../../a/r/a/Arabic.html" title="Arabic">Arabic</a>: <i>بقلاوة</i>: <i>Baqlawa</i>): Legume or Nut. From Arabic: (<i>بقلة</i>: <i>Baqla</i> ) (<i>بقلاوة</i>&#160;: <i>Baqlawa</i>): <i>single bean' '. And its plural is: (</i>بقول<i>&#160;:</i> Boqoul<i>), (</i>بقوليات<i>:</i> Boqouliyat<i>).</i></p>
<p>The rule in <a href="../../../s/e/m/Semitic.html" title="Semitic">Semitic</a> languages of defining singular nouns is by Adding an (A) letter after the noun. Such example are shown below:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>plural: (بقلاو: Baqlaw: legume) and its singular (بقلاوة: <a href="../../../b/a/q/Baqlawa.html" title="Baqlawa">Baqlawa</a>)</li>
</ul>
</dd>

</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Baklava is also known in <a href="../../../m/e/s/Mesopotamia.html" title="Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a>, as well as many other Mesopotamian walnut or legume dishes.</p>
<p>The word's Etymology and utterance of baklava are Arabic and derived from ancient <a href="../../../s/e/m/Semitic_languages.html" title="Semitic languages">Semitic languages</a> of <a href="../../../m/e/s/Mesopotamia.html" title="Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a> including Ancient <a href="../../../a/r/a/Aramaic.html" title="Aramaic">Aramaic</a>, <a href="../../../a/k/k/Akkadian.html" title="Akkadian">Akkadian</a> in <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assyria.html" title="Assyria">Assyria</a>, <a href="../../../n/a/b/Nabatean.html" title="Nabatean">Nabatean</a>, <a href="../../../p/h/o/Phoenician.html" title="Phoenician">Phoenician</a>, etc.</p>
<p>The name Baklava is actually spelled and pronounced as <a href="../../../b/a/q/Baqlawa.html" title="Baqlawa">Baqlawa</a>. During the expansion of Islam in <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persia.html" title="Persia">Persia</a>, <a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">India</a> and <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anatolia.html" title="Anatolia">Anatolia</a>, <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arabic_language.html" title="Arabic language">Arabic language</a> expanded as well as their culture. There were some difficulties for Persian, <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turk.html" title="Turk">Turk</a> and some Indian tongues of pronouncing several Arabic alphabets, such as the arabic letter (و:W). It is replaced by ( ب: V in <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persian_language.html" title="Persian language">Persian language</a>) and ( ف as V in <a href="../../../o/t/t/Ottoman_language.html" title="Ottoman language">Ottoman language</a>). Both languages (Persian and Ottoman) replaced the original letter in order to use arabic Alphabets. Thus the Arabic name (Baqlawa) sounds more accurate than English (<i>Baklava</i>).</p>
<p><br />
A long section was recently added to the article claiming that baqlawa is related to b-q-l, an Arabic root meaning 'sprout', 'greens', and 'bean'. This is certainly possible, but no references were given to support it. A long list of dictionaries given as 'references' doesn't help. And the rules of Arabic morphology aren't relevant here. Can we find a reputable source for the ancient Mesopotamian source of baklava? Can we find a reputable etymology connecting it to baqlah? Until we do, we should stick to the published sources we do have. --<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacrakis_14b1.html" title="User:Macrakis">Macrakis</a> 21:26, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>The history of baklava goes back to ancient times in Mesopotamia, as it was mentioned in a cook book of Mesopotamian walnut dishes in particular.</li>

i really can't understand why was the section removed. my references were scholar and those dictionaries were listed to prove of the word existence in Mesopotamian languages. and if you want to find the word try to get a dictionary called mokhtar al sihah, it will show you as well where the word come from.</p>
<p>The Walnut Cookbook, By Jean-Luc Toussaint. check it out. i did listed with the references before.</p>
<p>don't remove the section, some people may find this information are useful. i think everyone has his own theories, as well as nations like (Hebrew, Arabs, greeks and turks)they have their own theories. Let's make everyone happy by posting each nation theories. you can't say you're 100% sure it is turkish. another thing. look at the references provided in (Origin) and (Name) Sections, they are poor and some of them are not good to lay on as a reference. could you please correct my writing mistakes, because it's my first distribution. regards. Alan 14:30, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Alan, the question is not whether the root b-q-l appears in various Semitic languages -- there is no question about that. It has meanings related to 'sprouting', 'greens', 'beans', 'vegetables', etc. But the question here is about the history of a particular dish called baqlawa/baklava.</p>
<p>Your text says "The history of baklava is well goes back to ancient time of Mesopotamia, as it was mentioned in walnut cook book of Mesopotamian walnut dishes in Particular". Are you referring to the Toussaint cookbook? What evidence does he have?</p>
<p>Finally, this section goes into far too much detail on Arabic morphology, and on the phonetics of the other languages of the region. Yes, Arabic "w" coresponds to "v" in Persian, Turkish, etc. but we don't need generalities, but specific information about this word (and food) baklava/baqlawa. --<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacrakis_14b1.html" title="User:Macrakis">Macrakis</a> 17:09, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Dear Macrakis, I do thank you very much for your quick reply. What i understood from the book is that baklava was known at the time of Assyrian empire and Mesopotamia. It has mentioned also that walnut cooking was widely popular since Babylon times. In addition from another source <a href="http://www.chicago-botanic.org/cafe/recipes/november_walnut.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.chicago-botanic.org/cafe/recipes/november_walnut.php" rel="nofollow">[20]</a> Walnut groves were part of the famed Hanging Gardens in Babylon.</p>
<p>Well, if you 100% sure that baklava is of Turkish origin, this means it's of Anatolia and Mongolian origin, but find me a strong source of proving that baklava was named once as different name than baklava..</p>
<p>Perhaps As we all know that Assyrian Empire was once part of turkey before the Byzantine Empire. Many Assyrians stayed and many of them are still living in turkey.and they might kept their food untill the ottoman invation to costantinapole. It could be possible but it's widley long time to be depending on this theory. And this means that baklava was intoduced to the greeks before the turks if it was true. But this is far to be true. Don' t know really. <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assyrians_in_Turkey_f634.html" title="Assyrians in Turkey">Assyrians in Turkey</a></p>
<p>It is believed that in Syria, Lebanon, Jordan and the rest of the middle-eastern countries that baklava was basically originated from ancient Mesopotamia.</p>
<p>Would you help me to find more about it please? And I'm thinking to post the article with regarding to all different countries theories (Mainly: Mesopotamian Arabs, Hebrew, Turkish, greeks and Cypriot), but I need your assistance. Good talking to you Alan 18:47, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Alan, unfortunately, cookbooks are really poor sources of historical information, so unless your walnut cookbook points to good historical sources, I don't think it will help us much. Of course, walnuts are grown in much of the region, as are other nuts used in baklava (such as pistachios). But that doesn't prove that the dish was invented in any particular place.</p>
<p>I am not "100% sure that baklava is of Turkish origin", and the Assyrians and others may have something to do with it. I really don't know. Anyway, it doesn't matter what I am sure of, since WP does not publish <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>. It reports on the current scholarly literature, and as far as I can tell, the Perry article referenced in the article is the best scholarly reference on this subject. Of course, if you can find other good sources, so much the better!</p>
<p>Would you agree now that the detailed explanations of Arabic linguistics are out of place in this article? Thanks, --<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacrakis_14b1.html" title="User:Macrakis">Macrakis</a> 22:19, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Dear Macrakis, I think I got your point. Thank you very much for your co-operation. I'll remove some parts of what I wrote (without mentioning it's origin) And drag it below the Content (Name). I will not mention baklava's history until I find a good source, and my point will be mainly about the word's etomology therefore ancient languages studies is part of my digree. Could you read it, and let me know if you have any inquiry about the content. Alan 17:45, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Alan, I don't understand why you re-inserted the Arabic language discussion. The possibility that baqlawa is from the root for 'bean' (b-q-l, same root as baqqal, a grocer) is already mentioned in the article. I don't see that more elaboration is needed on the detailed morphology, or the fact that the root b-q-l is shared by the other Semitic languages (like most roots), or on the well-known fact that Arabic /w/ is typically borrowed as /v/ in Persian and Turkish. --<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacrakis_14b1.html" title="User:Macrakis">Macrakis</a> 22:04, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Dear Macrakis, In every article there is a bit of history, pictures and information. Our article here is food , and I can see all the information you are interested on is just history. When a person want to get information about baklava, this person want also to know other information than just history. Don't you agree? Have a click on fish and chips and see how articles is usualy made: [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish_and_chips" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish_and_chips" rel="nofollow">[21]</a>]</p>

<dd>Sorry, I didn't notice this comment before. I am not sure if you're referring to something in particular; more good information would certainly be a good thing. There are limits to the scope of WP, though; in particular, recipes belong in the Wiki cookbook, not here (see <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>). --<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacrakis_14b1.html" title="User:Macrakis">Macrakis</a> 18:51, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
