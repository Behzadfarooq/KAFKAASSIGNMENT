<p>Hi Baku87, one more suggestion for photos you're uploading with your permission. As I mentioned on the Azeri Wikiproject page, you always need to add a tag in addition to your link to your own permission page. If you ever upload a picture that you took, you can add {{cc-by-sa-2.5}} to the bottom, or one of the very wide variety on this page: <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_copyright_tag_aa2e.html" title="Wikipedia:Image copyright tag">Wikipedia:Image copyright tag</a>. -- <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobak_55e4.html" title="User:Bobak">Bobak</a> 18:08, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I asked a different user about this once, he deleted all my pictures and I placed that permission link for him. He said to me to use give that link in the pictures from now on. My permission link is:</dd>

<dd>The problem with just using that link is that it doesn't stop bots. There are a number of automated bots that troll the photos on Wikipedia (<a href="../../../o/r/p/User%7EOrphanBot_88cf.html" title="User:OrphanBot">OrphanBot</a> is the most notorious) and place automatic deletion notices based on whether or not the bot "sees" a tag. Since it's only looking for tags, it will not know what that link is and simply mark the photo for deletion. That bot, and others like it, are what delete the vast majority of photos on Wikipedia. Using both would be a simple cut'n'paste and rid yourself of any future issues. Just looking out for others. -- <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobak_55e4.html" title="User:Bobak">Bobak</a> 21:08, 16 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Baku87 , Thanks for your message on my discussion page. Nice to see this kind of organized efforts going on behaf of our millions. The over all partisipation of Azeries from North and specially South Azerbajan does not seem to be very high. Hopefully with the availability of internet this change. Sağolun</p>

<dd>Yeah your absolutely right about that, hopefully Azeris will realise that alot of propaganda is written and used against them in the internet. By the way if you find some good international sources then please also add them in the project page. By the way Mehrdad which region are you from?

<dd>Independence, peace and prosperity. Rembember that Azerbaijan and Baku was one of Hitler's main targets in Barbarossa, and he did come close to taking them. As much as a million Azerbaijanis fought against the Nazi agressor, and 58,400 paid the ultimate price for the defence of their homeland. <a href="http://www.warheroes.ru/main.asp?mode=&amp;flt_vis=1&amp;birth_date=&amp;death_date=&amp;start_date=&amp;end_date=&amp;naci_right=12&amp;sort=1&amp;l=0&amp;all=50" class="external text" title="http://www.warheroes.ru/main.asp?mode=&amp;flt_vis=1&amp;birth_date=&amp;death_date=&amp;start_date=&amp;end_date=&amp;naci_right=12&amp;sort=1&amp;l=0&amp;all=50" rel="nofollow">Many</a> were given the highest award, the Hero of the Soviet Union. During the war Azerbaijani oil also supplied the lifeblood to Soviet planes and vehicles - petrol. Those facts are not empty and it is worth rembering all those veterans, because I doubt if the fascist regime would have had any sympathies for Azerbaijanis. --<a href="../../../k/u/b/User%7EKuban_kazak_c2e3.html" title="User:Kuban kazak">Kuban Cossack</a> <a href="../../../r/o/m/Image%7ERomanov_Flag.svg_2101.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/c/c0/Romanov_Flag.svg/25px-Romanov_Flag.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="13" longdesc="../../../r/o/m/Image%7ERomanov_Flag.svg_2101.html" /></a> 16:04, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I know about Azerbaijan her role in the WOII, the Battle of Stalingrad was also about Baku. Your right but man 20 million comrades died and half of them were civilians, that was a damn high price to pay. My grandfather and his brother also fought in the war, my grandpa was a tankcommander during the war and he lost his arm and all his best friends, his brother was a spy in Spain but he suddenly got lost in Spain and was never found or heard of him again. Do you know anyone personal who experienced the war, maybe you would like to tell me about him or her? Also Kuban maybe we should make some sort of a stub of this star for all the former Soviet Republic members what do you think? <a href="../../../b/a/k/User%7EBaku87_076f.html" title="User:Baku87">Baku87</a> 17:57, 9 May 2006 (UTC)Baku87</p>

<dd>Of course I do, both of my grandparents fought. From my mother's line, my grandfather was a frontal recons man, before every atack it was his job to crawl right up to the German frontlines and instal remote-operated smoke screens which right before the atack would be then activated and our tanks would have valuable time to approach the German positions and pop out of the smoke right in front of them. Five times he got wounded, but lived on. My fathers father was the commander of a Cossack company and started at 17 in Karachaevo-Cherkessia, when they employed old Cossack tactics of running down from the mountains onto the German columns along with the Cherkess people, then he participated in purging the Germans from our steppes and then along the South of Ukraine went all the way into Vienna (<a href="http://www.rkka.ru/uniform/images/kaz_08_bw2.jpg" class="external text" title="http://www.rkka.ru/uniform/images/kaz_08_bw2.jpg" rel="nofollow">here he is third row fourth from the left at the famous victory parade in 1945</a>).

<p>Hi Baku87, the photos you are uploading with the tag that you have given permission to have it used off of your website have me wondering if you had the right to use them on your website to begin with. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Khojaly_survivor.jpg" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Khojaly_survivor.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Khojaly_survivor.jpg</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Khojaly_Genocide.jpg" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Khojaly_Genocide.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Khojaly_Genocide.jpg</a> (among others) are scanned from a magazine and in black and white, respectively. Did you actually take these photos? Did you get permission from the photographers to use them? They are clearly not old enough to have had the copyright expire. Please clarify this issue, as I am tempted to put a tag for removal due to copyright violation. Now personally, I am sure that the authors would not mind your using them on this site, but that is not the same as actually giving permission. --<a href="../../../r/a/f/User%7ERaffiKojian_530a.html" title="User:RaffiKojian">RaffiKojian</a> 02:52, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I know you would love nothing else then to see these pictures to be removed but all the pictures are from my own site and I have already dealt with that issue. All the pictures are from the Heydar Aliyev Foundation were I have permission to use their materials. I already dealt with this once and all my pictures got removed, later I was able to proof them that I have permission.<a href="../../../b/a/k/User%7EBaku87_076f.html" title="User:Baku87">Baku87</a> 13:24, 12 May 2006 (UTC)Baku87</p>

<dd>Aw, don't be so paranoid - I just noticed that a number of pictures you have supplied (not just these) didn't seem likely to have been taken by you, so your release of rights seemed a bit strange to me. You have not archived older conversations here, so there is no way I could know that this has been addressed properly. I suggest you create archive pages - and even suggest you leave a note about the photos on this page at all times. I will assume (in good faith) that the Heydar Aliyev Foundation had the rights to the photos. This same issue had come up with Armenian Genocide photos (which are 90 years old), so when I saw such recent photos, which it seemed highly unlikely you had taken, I did feel the need to bring up the issue of copyright. Later, --<a href="../../../r/a/f/User%7ERaffiKojian_530a.html" title="User:RaffiKojian">RaffiKojian</a> 04:39, 13 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>How sad that politics spill into what is considered proper copyright citation. I've been helping Baku87 keep these photos online --he initially didn't put a tag alongside the links to the external links so OrphanBot, etc would auto delete them. Now, unless you can <i>prove</i> your claims, why not keep your issues with Baku87 to whatever content Armenians/Azeris/Turks and their allies like to "discuss" (really, it's quite entertaining to the rest of us). -- <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobak_55e4.html" title="User:Bobak">Bobak</a> 18:25, 13 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Baku, I don't have any business at all on the Caucasus articles, though I do know that contributers like you have been doing a good job on them. Please don't take what I am saying as the result of any hidden agenda! I have been getting wound up by a range dodgy, dubious, and false copyright claims all over Wikipedia, and now I have found by chance a couple of your pictures which are (I am sure) completely legitimate but which look just as bad on first discovery. You need to cover your back a little better&#160;:-) Image:Khojaly Genocide.jpg, for instance, has a "rights irrevocably removed tag" used on it, so at least it is tagged, and you source it to your own website, which is also a good step. The critical thing is that you still haven't shown that you had the right to put it on your own website. If I took any image I wanted, put it on my geocities site, then pointed a link to it from Wikipedia to show how "mine" it was, nobody would take me seriously. Of course, I believe you haven't actually done that, but it looks no different to an outside observer (like the overworked and wikistressed-out people who run the images for deletion and copyright violations pages - they do a fantastic job, against very hard odds, trying to keep this encyclopedia as genuinely "free" as possible, and in return get a lot of grief from people whose photos get deleted). If you are using the material on your website by permission, then you ought to say so (this is what happens in Wikipedia when we use media material from a 3rd party who licensed it to us after a request for permission - records are kept of the emails and they are available for display). One place you ought display this is the "permission" page on your own website. Another is actually on your uploaded files themselves (because your website may not be there forever, but Wikipedia should be!). But take care: you clearly <i>are not</i> the owner of the images if you are just using them by permission, unless you have actually had ownership transferred to you as well. You need to publish very clearly the exact terms you have been allowed to use those media under. If somebody has just licensed them for use on Wikipedia, they have to be deleted (per Jimbo Wales - "Wikipedia-only" permissions are no longer acceptable), and similarly if they were licensed specifically for your site. If they genuinely have had "all rights released" then (and only then) is the current template correct, though it wouldn't be correct to say the uploader is the owner. If you need to go back and ask for wider permission, you may be able to get the pictures released under a slightly more restrictive license instead (like GFDL or Creative Commons). Anyway, you really must publish the exact terms of the license that was granted so it is possible to check which template to be used. And it would help very much if you could show that the person you are negotiating with actually is the owner of the copyright!</p>
<p>Please remember: <b>images and other media are guilty until proven innocent</b> because there's really no other way round it can be. If you are making a claim that those works no longer have copyright restrictions on them, then you need to prove it - it's not for a would-be deleter to prove the other way round. Even though we assume good faith (and I am 100% definitely assuming good faith - after all the effort you've been through, it would be weird for you to be deliberately uploading material you know you don't have the rights to) it's true that a lot of people (in good faith) get the law wrong, so we delete it anyway. It doesn't matter how many people vote in your support to say your faith is good - claiming that something that clearly (under normal circumstances) belongs to someone else is actually yours to give away is something you need good evidence to back yourself up with. It's a bit like being caught handing out the crown jewels to poor children... a very worthy act, and 100% legitimate if the King had privately decided to give them to you to do what you will with, but you shouldn't be surprised if people who weren't in the room at the time demand to know exactly what the King ("if you ever met him at all", say they) did tell you you could do with the jewels, and not believe your word for it. And in this wiki, there will be people (and you have met them and they have probably annoyed the hell out of you) asking those questions not because they have any deep moral desire to uphold the laws of property, but because they don't want certain things to get out into the public eye. You're doing yourself, and the wider world that wants and needs to see these things for ourselves, a great favour if you take the care to get those copyright statuses dealt with thoroughly and publicly, so all can see and nobody can criticise or take them away.

<dd>All my pictures on my site are from the Heydar Aliyev Foundation, who's headquarters is in Baku, Azerbaijan. Even the tekst in my site is from them! I have permission of them to use their pictures and teksts, why else do you think I upload these pictures, I wouldnt have uploaded if I knew they were gonna be deleted, it would be pointless. Im not sure how to proof this to you as I dont have real proof at the moment. But <a href="http://www.heydar-aliyev-foundation.org/s14_photo/s02_fund/fund_01.jpg" class="external text" title="http://www.heydar-aliyev-foundation.org/s14_photo/s02_fund/fund_01.jpg" rel="nofollow">here</a> is a picture of the Heydar Aliyev Foundation headquarters in Baku, so you know it really exists and <a href="http://www.heydar-aliyev-foundation.org/index_e.html" class="external text" title="http://www.heydar-aliyev-foundation.org/index_e.html" rel="nofollow">here</a> is their official site. Im going to visit Azerbaijan this summer, I actually got some real plans but to solve this problem I will try to arrange some proof. What kind of proof would be enough? <a href="../../../b/a/k/User%7EBaku87_076f.html" title="User:Baku87">Baku87</a> 19:55, 31 May 2006 (UTC)Baku87</dd>

<dd>Maybe just a scanned letter from the director of the foundation that writes that they allow the use of the images for educational purposes (like Wikipedia) just so long as the author of the source is credited. That and probably a timestamp on it. By the way, the word "teksts" is written "text" and the term is both singular and plural.--<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarshallBagramyan_31db.html" title="User:MarshallBagramyan">MarshallBagramyan</a> 15:41, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, try and get let a letter! Thinking about this: it would definitely <i>not</i> be enough for them to agree for use for educational purposes. They would have to agree for commercial purposes too, and allow the photographs to be manipulated or edited in any way. This is part of what makes Wikipedia a "free content" encyclopedia - the content can be reused by anybody (including for-profit organizations) for any purpose. What you really could do with is for them to release under a license like the Creative Commons. One other problem (sorry, yet another...) - why do they have the copyright to license in the first place? They may have collected the physical photographs, but why do they actually have the <i>copyright</i> to the photographs, which usually belongs to the photographer? I can collect photographs of a famous event, make a gallery of them for people to visit, but without owning any of the copyrights, which would mean I could not license them to anybody else. So, basically there are two things you need to show: (1) the institute actually has the copyright (not obvious) and (2) they allow people to use the photographs under some kind of free license (<i>not</i> a "for educational purposes" license). Hope this helps. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheGrappler_4371.html" title="User:TheGrappler">TheGrappler</a> 01:51, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The female is Kristin Fraser who is of American ethnicy with Azerbaijani nationality and the male is Igor Lukanin he's of Azerbaijani ethnicy and naionality (but born in Russia). But I didnt report the ethnicy in the thumbtekst though. By the way Tombseye I got this real nice picture of Azeri dance, this one gives a much better view of the dance then the currect one in the Azerbaijani people article, should I replace that picture? <a href="../../../b/a/k/User%7EBaku87_076f.html" title="User:Baku87">Baku87</a> 14:53, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hello Baku. Okay that's fine. Although you might want to keep the people on the page ethnic Azeris (which Igor is and Kristin isn't), as other editors will wonder as well who they are. I mean since the page is about ethnic Azeris, it could create problems in the future. Wow, a better dance picture than the one already there? I gotta see this as I really like the current dance picture! Post it on the discussion page in Azeris. If it's a lot better than we should definitely replace the current one. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETombseye_7b4d.html" title="User:Tombseye">Tombseye</a> 21:45, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

The one you have used only works <i>if you can prove the photographer died before 1905</i>. Since the photographer isn't identified, and given the historical information available, this seems highly unlikely. Copyright goes back a long, long time in some instances. It is possible these are public domain for another reason but "photographer died 100 years ago" will almost certainly not be it&#160;:) <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheGrappler_4371.html" title="User:TheGrappler">TheGrappler</a> 01:57, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Unfortunately even the "PD-Soviet" template is highly disputed - the bad news is that anything published in the USSR is considered as co-published in all its successor states. Georgia applies the standard "70 years after creator's death" even though Russia has a more liberal release date. However, since this was a picture taken and published in Imperial Russia, I don't know whether only the modern Russian law applies or whether Georgian law does too (which would be silly, but the law is an ass; if the USSR was the successor state to Imperial Russia it may follow that Georgia is an indirect successor state to Imperial Russia too!) <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheGrappler_4371.html" title="User:TheGrappler">TheGrappler</a> 11:45, 29 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Actually, Russia is the only legal successor to USSR.

<p>Hi. You don't need to add "National parks" as a category to articles already categorised as "National parks of Azerbaijan", because the category "National parks of Azerbaijan" is already in any case a subcategory of the category "National parks", so it doesn't give any additional information.

<dd>Hello, yes we are aware of the Iranian POV agenda thats been developing here on wikipedia, several of WikiProject Azeri members have been activily discussing with the Iranian members to halt the POV. But I agree there must be more and better coorperation between the Turkic people, I have just recently created WikiProject Turkic, in order to have smoother coorperation between Turkic people we should work under one WikiProject. Im still working on the pages of WikiProject Turkic any help would be great.

<p>Hi - a couple of stub types which you have created have been nominated for deletion at <a href="../../../s/f/d/WP%7ESFD_4ddf.html" title="WP:SFD">WP:SFD</a>. Stub templates and categories should be proposed prior to creation at <a href="../../../w/s/s/WP%7EWSS_P_67de.html" title="WP:WSS/P">WP:WSS/P</a>, so that they can be discussed and checked to see whether they conform to the standards and hierarchies maintained for stub types. In the case of the two types you made (which were not proposed), they use very vague criteria of type which have previously been rejected: the definition of what could classify as "nature" or "culture" makes these stub types unworkable for most practical purposes, and neither fts comfortably within the hierarchy of stub types. Furthermore, it is unlikely at present that either type has the required threshold number of articles necessary for a stub category to be viable. Feel free to comment on the proposed deletion at <a href="../../../s/f/d/WP%7ESFD_4ddf.html" title="WP:SFD">WP:SFD</a> and please, in future, propose any new stub types you wish to create, as per the instructions at <a href="../../../s/t/u/WP%7ESTUB_7484.html" title="WP:STUB">WP:STUB</a> and at the top of <a href="../../../a/z/e/Category%7EAzerbaijan_stubs_ec46.html" title="Category:Azerbaijan stubs">Category:Azerbaijan stubs</a>. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<i><small><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness"><font color="#008822">wha?</font></a></small></i> 23:00, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
