<li>It's not called <b>British Airways Connect</b> though, it is actually going to be called <b>BA Connect</b>, with the BA officially being meaningless. Aircraft and merchandise will all display BA Connect (rather than the previous 'British Airways'), and the company itself refers to it as BA Connect.

<p>This appears to be more complex that just calling is British Airways Regional as prior to the forming of BACX is was not refered to as such, rather reference was made to British Airways Manchester, British Airways Birmingham and British Airways Scotland.</p>
<p>When Loganair moved away from its association from British Midland and joined up with Manx Airlines as part of the British Regional Airlines (partly owned by Michael Bishop - CEO of British Midland), British Airways Scotland (and its ATPs named after Scottish glens) were part of the BA Scotland fleet. However these ATPs were dispensed with and a new series registered in the G-MANx series with Shorts 360 and Jetstream J31 and Jetstream J41 formed the new setup. The first five Embraer ERJ-145EU in the UK then joined the fleet at the newly opened Southampton based. For example the previous Loganair Jetstream 41 based at Glasgow for the Southampton route (in 1994)was replaced with a Southampton based ERJ145 (by 1998). It is this base which BA Connect announced the closure of on 26 July 2006.</p>
<p>At some point BA Manchester incorporated British Airtour Boeing 737-200 aircraft (early 1990's) possibly coinciding with the withdrawal of the BAC1-11 from the BA fleet. By the time BA Scotland was incorporated into BRAL, BA Manchester started to replace its Boeing 737-200 with 737-500 (in the G-GFFx series). THese subsequently were swapped with the BAe146 of Cityflyer when BACX was formed.</p>
<p>The 737-200 fleet of BA Birmingham were replaced with Airbus 319. As part of the re-organisation of the BA fleet associated with the formation of BACX, the Airbus 319 fleet (G-EUPx series) went to LHR, the Boeing 737-436 at LHR (G-DOCx series) went to LGW to join the others already there. The BAe146 at LGW then went to BACX to BHX and MAN. The "non-standard" Boeing 737-400 series (previous with Dan-Air) were withdrawn subsequently from BA service.</p>

<p>Several on-line lists are showing G-BRYZ (c/n 464) as a DH8-202. It is in fact a DH8-Q311. I have flown on it several times and observed it on other occaisions. It is of -300 series length. the -200 series has a shorter fuselage.

<p>In the next few months, BA Connect will cease to exist. I would suggest that the BA Connect article is maintained as is to reflect the then historical company that had existed through from the formation or BA Citiexpress (i.e. the purchase of BRAL and combination with Brymon and the BA Regional operations).</p>

<dd>BA Connect Fleet vs Easyjet fleet - Somebody explain why this is relevant or encylopedic, different aircraft are certified for different things, even aircraft with the same avionics can have different company operating mimimum height vs visibility. Why compare the landing category of BA Connect to Easyjet at one airport on one occassion.

<dd>I agree with MilborneOne. In the article it says "...are not certified to the same low visibility category ..." but there is nothing to back that up. It could depend on the company requirement/rules. As an example, where I work we have two different airlines, both using B737s. But one company follows the NAV CANADA rules for landing/depart while the other has their own requirements which are stricter. This causes them to miss more often and has nothing to do with the aircraft certification. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/a/m/User%7ECambridgeBayWeather_aa30.html" title="User:CambridgeBayWeather">CambridgeBayWeather</a> (<a href="../../../c/a/m/User_talk%7ECambridgeBayWeather_e92a.html" title="User talk:CambridgeBayWeather">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_CambridgeBayWeather_0915.html" title="Special:Contributions/CambridgeBayWeather">contribs</a>) 2006-11-07T23:40:02 (UTC)</small></dd>

<dd>An intersting one, like others i'm left wondering about the relevance of the issue - why compare the EasyJet fleet to the BA Connect one at all - they're use different classes of aeroplanes to start with. The reference used is a primary one (the dry stats) and leaves me thinking of this as <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a> - is there a source out there drawing the same easyJet vs. BA Connect conclusions from the data? Ta/<a href="../../../w/a/n/User%7EWangi_79ab.html" title="User:Wangi">wangi</a> 09:49, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>BA Press office confirms - their Emb aircraft operating at Bristol are not able to land unless they can see 100ft above runway, and have an RVR of 300 metres or more. EasyJet can land with 50ft vis above runway, and have an RVR of 100 metres. This effects the operation into Bristol especially on the worse days.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yeah, but what's the relevance to the BA Connect article, and is that a published source? As I said above the airlines use very different fleets, you expect different operating characteristics.

<p>BA Connect flights cancel more often than Easyjet. Whether an article on "the demise of BA Connect" is or would be an interesting sub topic is debatable? JulianHensey 17:01, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I don't follow - what's the relevance of comparing BA Connect to one airline in particular? What's the point in comparing two airlines which have very different fleets? Every airline in the world has different operating characteristics due to the different fleets they operate and the airports they operate into. But most importantly we're not here to do <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">research</a>. And that worries me about your suggestion about the <i>"demise of BA Connect"</i> too, what demise? We can include history on airline, but the sale of an airline is hardly world changing. Remember this is an encyclopedia, not a news article. Thanks/<a href="../../../w/a/n/User%7EWangi_79ab.html" title="User:Wangi">wangi</a> 21:31, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
