<p>The Catholic Church, by default the 'original' Pauline-inspired Church of the Latinate peoples, considers any religion claiming to be both Christian yet not Catholic as both heretical as well as 'Protestant'. The Protestants do not determine who is a Protestant except by protesting against the teachings of the Catholics, thereby becoming Protestants. Simpatico.</p>
<p>This is a "no-brainer." First, it depends upon whether you're talking about German Baptists or English Baptists. German Baptists, better known as Anabaptists, are "Classical Protestants." English Baptists - like Methodists, Congregationalists, Salvation Army, and other offshoots of the Church of England, are "Neo-Protestants."</p>

<p>AD 41: Founding of the Church of Antioch, modernly the (West) Syrian Church. AD 43: Founding of the Church of Alexandria, modernly the Coptic or Coptic Orthodox Church. -- Additional founding churches (collections of congregations) included: Church of Rome, Church of Byzantium, Ethiopian Church, Chaldaen (or East Syrian, or Iraqi) Church, Armenian Church, and the Celtic Church. The Celtic Church was reputedly founded about the year AD 108, at Paris, by disciples of Saint Phillilp. It was shortly thereafter introduced to Britain and Ireland. Celtic Christianity essentially was, and remained for a good millenium, a Christianised form of Druidism. One important difference of the Celtic Church was its practice of ordaining women, and the establishment of "co-educational" monasteries, with celibate monks in one wing and celebate nuns in the opposite wing (a bit like an H-block prison), all presided over by one Lady Abbess. The most famous of these was Saint Bridget, Bishop and Abbess of Kildare. Note: Ireland was not a Roman Catholic country until the English took over in 1171; and the Irish did not embrace the imposition of Roman Catholicism by the English, until Henry VIII turned Protestant and made himself head of the Church of Ireland.</p>

<p>The conversion of Emperor Constantine made Christianity the "Ecclesia Catholica Romana" or "Universal Roman Church." Constantine then complicated the question by establishing two capital cities, so that the Church of Rome (Italian Christianity) and the Church of Byzantium (Greek Christianity) ultimately came to compete with each other, each claiming to be the true universal or "catholic" church of the Roman Empire.</p>
<p>Things came to a head in 1056 with the Mutual Excommunication (sometimes called "Great Schism," after which the Pope and the Patriarch of Constantinople (formerly Byzantium) refused to recognise each other as Christians until 1966.</p>

<p>Martin Luther, Ioannes Calvinus or John Calvin, the Anabaptist leaders, and, eventually, Henry VIII were instrumental in establishing the four lines of Classical Protestant thought: Lutheranims, Calvinism, Anabaptist (German Baptist - originally so radical that the other three Classical Protestant groups considered Anabaptists to be heretics), and Anglicanism.</p>
<p>The national churches established along Calvinist lines are usually called "Reformed Church," e.g., Swiss Reformed, Dutch Reformed, and so on. In France/Francophone cultures, Calvinists are called "Huguenot"; in Scotland/Scottish/Scots-Irish cultures, Presbyterian (or in the Province of Quebec, "Presbyterienne"); in Wales, Calvinistic Methodist (because the seminal church in Wales was supposed to be Methodist, but instead of getting a Methodist minister from England they ended up with a Presbyterian leader from Scotland); and in England, and colonial America, Calvinists were/are variously called "Puritans" and "Congregationalists" - the former, a broader term that also included some radical non-Calvinist Protestant Dissenters, and the latter a Neo-Protestant institution (like the Methodists) but with a prevailing Calvinist theology.</p>
<p>The Anglican Communion is unusual among Classical Protestant churches in being incredibly broad in theology and ritual. The very Low Church Anglicans are nearly indistinguishable from Presbyterians, Methodists, and so on, while Anglo-Catholic Anglicans are often described as "More Catholic than Roman Catholics." There is a full range of traditions and beliefs in-between, and there are number of practicing members of the Church of England and other branches of the Anglican Communion - including the occasional priest (who may be male or female) who are atheists, but they still go to church every Sunday because it's part of their cultural tradition (their disbelief in the basic theology is considered irrelevant to their faith in the church).</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">NEO-PROTESTANTS &amp; NEO-CHRISTIANS: c. AD 1600 to PRESENT</span></h3>

<p>These groups fall into three general categories, with founding dates as early as the seventeenth century and as late as the twentieth:</p>
<p>1. Neo-Protestant Church of England Dissenters: English Baptists, at least nominally including all American Baptist churches that do not trace to German origins; Methodists and Free Methodists; Salvation Army; and so on. If it broke away from the Church of England (or was founded by someone who broke away from the Church of England), it's part of this group. "Neo-Protestant" distinguishes these churches from the Classical Protestant churches, especially to the degree they broke away from a Classical Protestant church.</p>
<p>2. Other Neo-Protestant Churches: These are Christian churches founded since the eighteenth century which integrate the Unitarian tradition of the public lecture into their worship. Whereas Classical Protestant churches have well-defined liturgies, which may or may not include a sermon; *these* churches may not have a liturgy at all, and always have a kind of public lecture instead of a sermon, and may also have discussions of religious topics, magazine articles, etc., all typically bracketed by the singing of hymns. This is a common feature of all Neo-Protestant churches; these particular churches differ from the first group in NOT be break-away denominations of the Church of England. Examples of this type of Neo-Protestant denomination are Seventh-Day Adventist, Jehovah's Witnesses, and so on.</p>
<p>3. Neo-Christian groups: These are groups that are Christian, in one way or another, but they evolved completely independently of the Catholic and Protestant traditions, or have become too independent of any roots and that linear evolution to be considered Neo-Protestant. The oldest of these groups is probably the Religious Society of Friends, commonly known as "Quakers." Most but not all Quakers identify themselves as Christians; there is no creed; there are no sacraments; there is no officiation at meetings of friends as the term is usually understood, etc. The other major Neo-Christian organisation, of course, is The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, better known as "Mormons"-though that label includes a number of other related, small churchs, as well as the large LDS church.</p>
<p>NOW, from the perspective of any given organised religious faith itself, whether it calls itself Protestant or not is question of that organised faith itself. Jehovah's Witnesses, for example, do not consider themselves to be Protestants because they believe they adhere to the oldest religion in the world -- that the first of Jehovah's Witnesses was Abel, son of Adam and Eve, who was killed by his brother Cain. Many Baptist church associations hold similar beliefs about themselves.</p>
<p>But THIS is supposed to be an encyclopedia the recounts real, historical facts. And the real historical fact is that Jehovah's Witnesses got started in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1876, when Charles Taze Russell happened to pass by an Adventist Church service one evening, decided to go inside, and thereafter found himself filled with the Spirit. The "Russellite Adventists" were soon born, with their "Watchtower" magazine; and they ultimately adopted the name "Jehovah's Witnesses" in 1931. That they claim Abel as the first Jehovah's Witness is a core belief of the faith, and should be recited as such. But it should NOT be put forward by this encyclopedia as though it were a literal and real fact.</p>
<p>Likewise, any idea that Baptist churches predate the Roman Catholic Church founded about the year 330 is a pure nonsense in terms of real history. If you're talking Anabaptists, its a Classical Protestant chruch. If you're talking English Baptists, you're looking at Neo-Protestants. That is the REAL history. What the religion says about itself in history, is a different matter.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Too traditional?</span></h2>
<p>I'm a deacon (though we call it a board member) at my small Baptist congregation and have served as a delegate for Ohio in the American Baptist Churches / USA (which I believe is the third largest association of Baptists). I've been to many Baptist churches, and my father is a Baptist minister (D.Min). I find that the descriptions in here might make the denomination a little more 'stale' than my experience has shown it to be. For example, I've never seen a pulpit in the center of the stage, except in a few "ancient" Baptist churches. Those that have it haven't used it as the point of sermon. Our church is governed by the board, and the Pastor is only a spiritual leader, not an administrative one. This is also the style with most churches I'm exposed to, although sometimes the administrators *are* ordained ministers and paid positions. I'm also not used to the concept of a sermon lasting over 20-25 minutes.</p>
<p>Anyone else know where I'm coming from? The changes I'm imagining are far too big of an edit for me to take on personally.</p>

<p>We must have traveled in very different circles. All of the Baptist churches of which I have been a member (also ABC / USA) have had a pulpit at the center of the stage, and I'd only consider one of these to be "ancient" (it was founded in the late 1700s). Most of the Baptist churches I've visited have also had this pulpit configuration. If I recall correctly, all of the Baptist churches I've belonged to have had the pastor serve in administrative dutes, in addition to the spiritual ones. My experience with sermon length is similar to yours--most don't go over 20 minutes. Only at the old-timey "revival meetings" have the sermons I've heard gone much longer, and often with more than one preacher (these were at churches not officially affiliated with any other Baptist organization, as far as I know). It's tempting to think of our own experiences as being representative, especially if they have been extensive, but there is apparently a lot of space for differences, even within a group of affiliated churches. <a href="../../../r/o/h/User%7ERohirok_454f.html" title="User:Rohirok">Rohirok</a> 03:19, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree with Rohirok. There is a wide variety. I have been a member of Independent Baptist churches (i.e., not affiliated with any association or governing body) for many years. (I'm military, so I've been in several over the last 15 years). In the church I'm in now, the pastor founded the church 27 years ago. He is still the pastor and is very much the final authority for all matters, both administrative and spiritual. That being said, the deacons (of whom I was one until only recently) vote on any financial decisions, and for "major" financial decisions the entire church has to vote. As for sermons, the pulpit is in the center of the stage and the pastor preaches 30-40 minute sermons from it. This church is pretty typical of the ones I have been member of. Furthermore, most members of our church would consider it sacrilege to not have the pastor administratively lead the church, not preach from the pulpit, or preach less than 30 minutes. That, too, is typical of the churches I've been in.</dd>
<dd>I'm not making moral judgement here - I have been a member of both Southern Baptist and ABC churches in the past. I'm just saying that not all Baptist churches are equal, although within a particular "type" they may be similar. There is a wide range of church "personalities" that can be expected. <a href="../../../r/o/a/User%7ERoachmeister_8239.html" title="User:Roachmeister">Roachmeister</a> 14:24, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This sentence, or similar, has been in the Baptist article for quite a while, according to the history: "Participation may be either 'closed' where only members of that church can participate, 'cracked' where members of other Baptist churches may participate, but not of other denominations, or open' where anyone professing to be a Christian may participate." I would propose that it be changed to "Participation may be either 'closed' where only members of that church can participate, 'close' where members of other Baptist churches may participate, but not of other denominations, or 'open' where anyone professing to be a Christian may participate." We discussed this term quite a while back on the old Communion thread and decided to remove it. See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Eucharist/Archive_2#.22Cracked.22_Communion.3F" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Eucharist/Archive_2#.22Cracked.22_Communion.3F" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Eucharist/Archive_2#.22Cracked.22_Communion.3F</a> IMO, "close" is preferable to "cracked". Close and closed are often confused, and cracked offers the option of being clearly different. But it seems that this term probably has only limited usage in some area, is not in common use among Baptists, and is not particularly descriptive without the accompanying explanation. - <a href="../../../r/l/v/User%7ERlvaughn_1973.html" title="User:Rlvaughn">Rlvaughn</a> 20:14, 23 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I support this. I too have never heard the term cracked before but have heard the concept referred to as close. I don't believe anyone who practices a 'cracked' communion would ever refer to it as such since it implies a middle point between two other positions. <a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGold_Dragon_846c.html" title="User:Gold Dragon">Gold Dragon</a> 03:51, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">issues by anon</span></h2>
<p>There is a very important problem with this article -- it's too generic. It ignores the fact there is no one Christian group called "Baptist" but the term is used by many completely different Protestant lines of faith. The one thing they all have in common is avoidance of infant baptism. Otherwise, they are separate faiths - and NOT all of them are organised with a congregational-style administration. Neither do they all believe in separation of church and state, nor do they all agree on the definition of "Christian." In the United States alone, for example, the member churches of the Southern Baptist Convention are far more conservative than the American Baptist Church, which is very liberal. Among other differences, Southern Baptists do NOT support separation of Church and State but are among the strongest advocates for prayer in the public schools, while American Baptists are opposed to prayer in the public schools.</p>
<p>Historically, the two major divisions of "Baptists" were English Baptists, that is, the Baptists who broke away from the Church of England; and the German Baptists, better known as Anabaptists, who developed earlier and completely independently of the English Baptist tradition. The article should be reorganised to talk about the origins of the common name "Baptist," then discuss each of the major Baptist denominations separately.</p>

<p>I don't really agree. Even Richard Land, with the Faith and Ethics Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention, would agree that Separation of Church and State is important. The differences lie in how that is interpreted, of course.</p>
<p>I think the best way to consider the issue is this: there is a Baptist World Alliance. It is generally a more conservative organization, yet most of its members would have no problem agreeing to the description of Baptists put forward in this article. If you want another article, perhaps one on differences and controversies within the Baptist Tradition would be good, but I think this one is fine in its current form, even if tweaks are always welcome. <a href="../../../s/i/g/User%7ESighter_Goliant_2446.html" title="User:Sighter Goliant">Sighter Goliant</a> 05:43, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>James Dunn often said that no Baptist speaks for Baptists, they speak TO Baptists. Might it be possible to include a separate section, towards the top, which makes a disclaimer? It would concern the enormous diversity in the tradition, and make a statement concerning the attempt of the article to reflect the general feeling of what Baptists believe...generally. 05:47, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Baptists amd Slavery</span></h2>
<p>Do Baptists still practice slavery? It was(is?) a major part of there religion and belief.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Slavery was not and has not ever been a "major part of there [sic] religion and belief." There was a regrettable period of American history in which many Baptists of the American South chose to choose their culture over Christ, using the Bible to justify slave ownership, but this in no way constitutes a central tenet of belief. However, even in the South this opinion was not uniform -- the faculty of Furman University, for instance, split directly down the middle on the question, and only adopted a pro-slavery stance because of the President of that institution. Considering, however, that such support was a localized incident, I don't feel it has any importance in an article dealing with Baptists all over the world. <a href="../../../s/i/g/User%7ESighter_Goliant_2446.html" title="User:Sighter Goliant">Sighter Goliant</a> 05:22, 8 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well it was a really big issue for the Baptists in the 1830s and 1840s-- the Southerners split off from the North over the issue of slave ownership by missionaries.<a href="../../../r/j/e/User%7ERjensen_b7df.html" title="User:Rjensen">Rjensen</a> 05:24, 8 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>By all means, if it's that important edit the history section. However, I'm of the opinion that the article is US-heavy.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Membership</span></h2>
<p>Rjensen feels that a discussion on the membership of baptist in various conventions requires its own section while I believe it belongs in the section on the autonomy of the local church. My reasoning is that conventions have arisen from the doctrine of local autonomy and any discussion about the historical relationships between associations/conventions should be discussed in more detail in a baptist history section outlining different groups and movements from the time of English separatists to modern baptists. I believe giving global and national membership numbers while highlighting that the SBC is the largest assocation is enough introduction these ideas for the intro paragraph.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">did a checkup on the numbers</span></h2>
<p>I took at look at the 40 million number, the 90% and the 90 million figure. According to adherent.com (Which is recommended as a source by census.gov) there are an estimated 47 million baptists in the US (2004 estimate). The assertation of 90 million worldwide baptists was uncorroborated by anything I found, and it is unclear exactly how many there are. I would guess that the 90% figure is innaccurate, though, as baptist roots are clearly in europe.</p>
