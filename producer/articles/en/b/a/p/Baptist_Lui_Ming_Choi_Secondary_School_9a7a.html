<p>Under the Hong Kong Baptist Convention, the school was founded by the Lui Ming Choi Foundation. It is one of the five secondary schools operating under the supervision of the Convention. The School’s <a href="../../../m/o/t/Motto.html" title="Motto">motto</a> is "明道致知" in Chinese , derived from the idea of <a href="../../../z/h/u/Zhu_Xi_85e5.html" title="Zhu Xi">Zhu Xi</a>, a <a href="../../../c/o/n/Confucianist.html" title="Confucianist">Confucianist</a> in <a href="../../../s/o/n/Song_Dynasty_fcad.html" title="Song Dynasty">Song Dynasty</a> and incorporated this into <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian.html" title="Christian">Christian</a> belief, which means <i>understanding <a href="../../../g/o/d/God.html" title="God">God</a>’s teachings to become wise and intellectual</i>. This concludes the expectation for its graduates. The school aims at enhancing student's virtue (德), wisdom (智), physique (體), fellowship (群), aesthetics (美) and spirituality (靈). The Christian-styled education of the school is reflected in the quote from the <a href="../../../b/i/b/Bible.html" title="Bible">Bible</a> displayed at the main entrance of the campus. It says: <i>The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom, and the knowledge of the Holy One is understanding.</i> (Proverbs 9:10).</p>
<p>Though the School holds the spread of the <a href="../../../g/o/s/Gospel.html" title="Gospel">Gospel</a> to be one of its missions, the atmosphere is relatively open and <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberal.html" title="Liberal">liberal</a>, not only in the religious aspect, but also the socio-political. Till to date, the School and its Student Union hold memorial service and activities concerning the <a href="../../../t/i/a/Tiananmen_Square_protests_of_1989_f021.html" title="Tiananmen Square protests of 1989">Tiananmen Square protests</a> and <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_Fourth_Movement_1612.html" title="June Fourth Movement">June Fourth Movement</a> which happened in mainland <a href="../../../c/h/i/China.html" title="China">China</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1989.html" title="1989">1989</a>.</p>

<p>Situated at the bank of <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shing_Mun_River_b20f.html" title="Shing Mun River">Shing Mun River</a>, the campus development is restrained. Nonetheless, the school extended the new wing in 1999 and undertook renovation and classroom reshuffle in order to facilitate the setting up of its multimedia laboratory and language laboratory. In the construction plan, a <a href="../../../r/o/o/Roof_garden.html" title="Roof garden">roof garden</a> was included. The building of garden expanded the very limited space in where casual activities or even relaxation for students and staff could be taken place. Apart from classrooms and congregation hall, the school equips with science laboratories, playgrounds, rooms for various kinds of art, language and multimedia facilities for modern education.</p>

<p>The Baptist Lui Ming Choi Secondary School Student Union (also known as BLMCSSSU or LMCSU) has the longest history in its sort among schools in the East <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Territories_e5a9.html" title="New Territories">New Territories</a>. Formed in 1983, the <a href="../../../s/t/u/Student_Union_5939.html" title="Student Union">Student Union</a> has been playing a key role in students' activities, as well as external involvement. Departments of the Union organise ranges of programme and activity to enhance learning experience and campus life. It also connects the student population with other schools' fellows through joint schools functions and friendly dialogues.</p>
<p>The Union is a <a href="../../../d/e/m/Democratic.html" title="Democratic">democratic</a> organisation which consists of two main bodies: the Executive Committee, which is the cabinet executing mandated power, and the Representative Council, holding power of amending the Constitution of the Union, passing working plans, budgets, approving reports, debate and vote on Committee proposals. In principle, the Committee and the Council cooperate to enact and push forward any proposals and plans. The <a href="../../../s/c/h/School_principal.html" title="School principal">principal</a> acts as the President-in-Nomine. 2 to 3 teaching staff are assigned by the Principal to be Advisors to supervise and guide the operation of the Union, whom are seen to be real supervisors. The Committee coordinates working schedule and details with Advisors' consent, though not bounded in the Constitution.</p>
<p>The Constitution had been initially drafted in the early 1980s when several minor amendments were taken. It was until years around 1999 to 2001, the Constitution was completely reviewed. Two new drafts were proposed to the Council where the second one, which is the currently enforced one, were passed on the 19th Union Council. During those years, there was deep division among student leaders and head teaching staff. The conflict was ended up with a Committee concession to modify the more radical edition into a moderate one. Nevertheless, the period of quarrel divided the student leadership into polars that affected the politics in subsequent Committees.</p>
