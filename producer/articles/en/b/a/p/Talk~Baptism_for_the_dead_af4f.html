<p>Actually, the source for my addition was a lengthy discussion (4 hours) of the issue with a leading member of the church in Jerusalem. The topic of the discussion was possible Hebrew etymologies for names in the BoM and the problems involved in a Hebrew translation (which, except for select chapters, has never been done--attempted, rejected, but never completed). Sorry, but my sources are a little better than CNN, and I think RK's sources are too. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanny_4e16.html" title="User:Danny">Danny</a></p>

<dd>Hi Danny. I don't see any substantive contributions on this article by you and I wasn't referring to any contribution which you made. I'm sure that you and RK have good, extensive sources as do I and most active contributors here in general. I only noted the CNN link (which I wouldn't be surprised if it were merely a rehash of an AP or other wire) because of the similarity in language between it and RK's recent post.</dd>
<dd>Do you remember the name of the member with whom you had the discussion? Was he associated with BYU-Jerusalem? Just curious...a former president of BYU-Jerusalem, Truman Madsen, will be presenting a lecture here locally tomorrow. <a href="../../../b/o/n/User%7EBoNoMoJo_c7e6.html" title="User:BoNoMoJo">B</a></dd>

<p>I stumbled across this page and was more than slightly unhappy with its current state, so made a few changes:</p>
<p>Overall, I removed many of the POV type things (so much negativity in this article!), corrected the improper use of "mormon" (its a slang term... encyclopedias don't generally use slang terms in their entries...), and reworded several portions so that in the future, when "2002" is no longer "recently", the article will still be relevant.</p>
<p>I added several other current religions that practice baptism for the dead, but attempted to make it clear that this article deals exclusively (at least at the moment) with The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I also added in that baptisms for the dead must be performed in a temple by an endowed Melchizedek Priesthood holder.</p>
<p>I added in a few short paragraphs saying that historical documents DO in fact show that baptism for the dead isn't some strange new invention of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, but rather that is was practiced by many Christian groups for several centuries.</p>
<p>On to the "opponents":</p>
<p>The Christian opposition didn't need much tweaking. I changed it to "No other major Christian denomination..." from "No other Christian denomination..." because there are several Christian groups that practice baptism for the dead. It is just plain false to state otherwise. Also slightly modified the second paragraph in that section, because it sounded funny.</p>
<p>The Jewish opposition section was just plain silly. It made the Church sound like some omninious force that did whatever it wanted regardless of its agreements with others, and only changes its mind when public pressure is placed on it. Thats just bogus and doesn't belong in an article that is supposed to be NPOV. So I went through and fixed the spelling errors, changed the references to the Church and its members to reflect standard styles, added in dates instead of "recently", and softened the references to the Church to a more, IMHO, NPOV view.</p>
<p>The third paragraph of the Jewish opposition was just plain deceptive. I changed the first part of the first sentence to "In December 2002, independent research Helen Radkey...". The date is important, as that was practically a year ago. The "independent" part is important, because independent researchers commonly exaggerate their claims and so they should be taken with "a grain of salt" as the saying goes. I also changed the "promise...seems to have been broken" to the "promise...was not sufficient". The promise wasn't broken. The Church promised to remove 400,000 names from its index and it did, but the fact that other names are still in there show that the promise wasn't enough to satisfy independent researchers. I changed "over 20,000 Jewish Nazi victims" to "about 19,000 who had a 40 to 50 percent chance of having 'the potential to be Holocaust victims...in Russia, Poland, France, and Austria.'" That is a significant difference (about 10,000 people). I think it is reasonable to go with the lower estimate (since a nice rounded 20,000 sounds a bit strange) and the 40 to 50 percent clause is EXTREMELY important in showing that the Church shouldn't have to remove a name just because there is a 50/50 change that it was a Jewish holocaust victim. If the researcher doesn't know for sure that it was a holocaust victim, then obviously no Latter-day Saint is going to know if it was or not.</p>
<p>I did add in a quote, but then realized that it was already stated a few paragraphs up so removed it.</p>
<p>Cleaned up the references and external links a bit. Again, the word "recent" isn't really appropriate in most cases in an encyclopedia entry. How old is "recent"? When does "recent" become "old"? Who goes through and changes the "recent"'s to "old"'s? Also added in the title of the article to assist people in their research.</p>
<p>Anyways, these comments probably sound rude but quite frankly I was offended by the misleading and intentionally defaming statements made in this article. — <a href="../../../z/u/l/User%7EZulugrid_2056.html" title="User:Zulugrid">Zulugrid</a> 02:50, Nov 20, 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>Deletions: The Coptic church does not practise "baptism of the dead", hence i deleted this reference. A short search on Google will show that all references to such a practice are LDS sources, but none by the Coptic church themselves. Even Tvedtness article linked at the bottom of the page shows clearly that he has only hearsay on this practice.(one of the first footnotes)</p>
<p>Deletion&#160;: Unification Church&#160;: This is not a christian church at all, hence it is somewhat spurious to use it as evidence of a more general Christian consensus on this matter.</p>
<p>Tvetdness, described in the last addition as a Christian scholar is in fact a teacher at Brigham Young university, member of the LDS church and appears to act as an apologist for the LDS church. Use of this quote is obviously ok, but it should be attributed correctly.</p>
<p>General alterations&#160;: I am aware that the LDS church sees itself as "christian" but this is a perception not shared by any major Christian denomination. Hence I changed various places to make this clearer.</p>
<p>I do not try to be controversial but I feel these are important points. The LDS view on teh matter is clear , but it is disingenious to minimise the general Christian opposition to this practice.</p>

<dd>I do believe that there is enough evidence that the practice existed during the second century, aside from Tvetdness. Griggs and others have shown that it was practiced (I'll try to gather references later). I agree that I don't believe it is practiced by anyone today, outside of the LDS Church, but I am unsure. I also appreciate your edits to this article.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>However, I disagree that no other Christian Church sees Mormons as Christians. If that is the case, why are they accepted into various Christian Coalitions etc, when then won't allow Jews, Rastafarians or others in? I know it's not the right forum to debate this, but be careful in over-generalizations, unless you've taken a poll and determined that 100 percent of people agree. When you have other Christian congregations (Southern Baptist, Methodist, Catholic, etc) in Salt Lake protesting and defending fellow christians (the LDS Church) against the actions of those who descecrated sacred mormon items (<a href="http://www.religionnewsblog.com/4805-Pastors_condemn_preachers__acts.html" class="external free" title="http://www.religionnewsblog.com/4805-Pastors_condemn_preachers__acts.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.religionnewsblog.com/4805-Pastors_condemn_preachers__acts.html</a>). That to me says that at least some who disagree with LDS viewpoints, still accept that the LDS are Christian. Anyway, this particular point should probably be discussed at the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Controversies_regarding_The_Church_of_Jesus_Christ_of_Latter-day_Saints_5447.html" title="Controversies regarding The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints">Controversies</a> page. I also am curious about your bias in regard to the Unification Church. <a href="../../../v/i/s/User%7EVisorstuff_508e.html" title="User:Visorstuff">Visorstuff</a> 23:06, 12 Dec 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>WRT to baptism of the dead - the only Christian references I found was wrt baptism of corpses of recently deceased, who were in preparation of baptism. The practice is heterodox and but apart from this appears quite different to anything described in the article as being LDS beliefs. So the parallels are teneous to say the least.</p>
<p>I would hope that Christians will always stand up for other people when they are attacked. Currently the strontgest support fro French Muslims wrt the head scarf ban in French schools comes from Christian churhces. This has no bearing on whether Christians agree with Muslims in matters of faith etc, but simply a defence of other people who are under attack. Aprta from this I am no American and have no clue what is going on in Salt Lake City.</p>
<p>WRT the Unification Chuirch - Rev Moon sees Christ as a failure and himself as surpassing Christ, hence he has probably put himself firmly outwith common Christian roots. The Unification Church has a syncretistic approach, mixing various strands and forming their own ideology/faith based on this.</p>

<dd>It definately was believed to be practiced <i>in proxy</i> for the dead among the Marcionites, and others. "Tertullian believed that Paul referred to a custom of vicarious baptism (Res., 48c; Adv. Marc., 5.10). There is evidence that the early church knew such a practice. Epiphanius mentions a tradition that the custom obtained among the Cerinthians (Haer., 28 6). And Chrysostom states that it prevailed among the Marcionites. (from searchgodsword.org)" I guess I should add in the above quote into the article.</dd>

<dd>Hope this helps. <a href="../../../v/i/s/User%7EVisorstuff_508e.html" title="User:Visorstuff">Visorstuff</a> 00:57, 13 Dec 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks. I followed the links and what becomes obvious is that the Marcionites existed, that they practised baptism for the dead, that they also denied the ressurection and that they were at the time already considered as heretical. Rees has the most "charitable" view that Paul maybe accepted it as a result of being himself still a child of his times, while the rest of the Christian quotes you gave just shows what appears obvious to me anyway - Paul ridicules the local (splinter-) groups who do not belief in ressurection but baptise for the dead. Paul has used in various other places similar ways of argueing - showing people how ridiculous their beliefs are by thinking them through at absurdum (here ridiculous wrt to ressurection of the dead!)</p>
<p>Be that as it may, I do not think that mutual evangelism is what this encyclpaedia is about - hence I suggest following approach - we edit the pages and make clear where things come from. This way everyone is able to follow through the POVs and come to his own. I will do this now. Tell me what you think of the result.</p>

<p>"Ridiculous?" I cannot believe you came to that conclusion (especially with the jefflindsay extra resources and searchgodsword references). I would encourage you to read the original source texts that are mentioned, which you obviously haven't. You cannon claim (not can anyone else) to know exacly what Paul meant by saying what he said in your edit. You are not Paul, therefore you don't know if he was condeming the practice or not. Yes, many protestants see this as heretical. So do many Catholics. Others see it as heretical, yet similar to the doctrines accosiated with purgatory. You draw to many conclusions on your own, that are not possible to draw without being present at the time Paul and others wrote.</p>
<p>Comments to other edits: Not all Christians believe in Faith Alone. Clarified to relflect protestants. Mormons do not believe in salvation by works either. Also, Duke univerity professor I spoke to with, agreed that early Christians, although heretical or coptic, may have practiced Baptism for the dead and similar forms of what he called "ancestor worship." So my point is, not every Christian dismisses the practice as easily as you. I've removed that part of the sentence to reflect that change.</p>
<p>I agree that this is not about evangelism, and I am not trying to push Mormonism, however, you obviously have never written an objective historical paper, as you draw too many conclusions, instead of letting the evidence speak for itself.</p>
<p>BTW - Your beliefs about Moonies is not what my <a href="../../../u/n/i/Unification_Church_2f2f.html" title="Unification Church">Unification Church</a> friends nor their doctrine beleive. Perhaps a reading on them would be good too. I'm not trying to attack you, just try to be more NPOV in your conclusions before posting, and be careful of absolutes (all Christians, everyone), unless you've spoken to everyone (try many of most to stay NPOV).</p>
<p>Happy editing and thanks for posting. You have some other good points that round out the article more NPOV. <a href="../../../v/i/s/User%7EVisorstuff_508e.html" title="User:Visorstuff">Visorstuff</a> 15:21, 13 Dec 2003 (UTC)</p>

<dd>"The practice of Baptism for the Dead appears to abrogate this, although the LDS Church does not believe in salvation by works alone." This is a bit of a non sequitur as the question was not whether "by works alone" or otherwise. I am struggling though how to change this. The point is here whether the works of others can cause salvation, in particular for the dead. You will probably see a sudden change in a couple of days when inspiration strikes.</dd>

<p>WRT to Duke university professors - leave them out, will you&#160;? Either quoted and with sources or not at all. Also I am on the other side of the globe, where American universities are relatively irrelevant (or completely unknown) I guess it would be the same for you if I told what my Krakowian uni prof thought differently than yours. Not that I am in Krakow either - but you get my drift.</p>

<dd>Right I did siome more editing. I cut and changed again, but took your references into this bit so that you can re-utilise them.

<p>I hope you don't think i'm attacking either - i just have the tendancy to be a bit blunt in my comments - and very protective of the use of Absolutes. If you are not a Mormon or Moonie, it is hard to know exactly what they mean by certain things. My apologies if it comes off harsh. According to Mormonism, the works of others do not "cause their salvation" as you put it. Mormons do not believe they change the dead's salvation status or rob their agency, but allow for them to have access to an ordinance that they believe is required for Salvation. The dead are more than welcome to accept of reject the ordinance after it has been completed for them. This places the personal responsibilites back to the indivdual (D&amp;C 124 gives more info on this), who can accept the gospel or reject it. Is it this practice controversial? Yes. But I personally think that <a href="../../../m/o/t/Mother_Teresa_71c4.html" title="Mother Teresa">Mother Teresa</a>'s practice of baptising people on their deathbed without their knowledge is as controversial, if not more so. At least in Mormon's case they try to get permission from surviving family members if there are any.</p>
<p>The reason I referenced my conversation with a Duke professor is that the univeristy is considered in many early Christian Scholarly circles at the world-wide pre-eminent univeristy in early Christian history and New Testament studies. I did not attend Duke, and as a friend I didn't think his name needs to be attached to such a simple point. I did not reference him in the article, just here on the talk page to illustrate a point. I don't reference the Krakowian univerity as they definately don't hold the same status amoung Worldwide Christian scholars.</p>

<dd>While I applaud any attempts Mormons make to get permission from surviving family members, they seem to be inconsistent in this regard. Both the older scandal of baptizing holocaust victims, and the current scandal in which they seem to be targeting deceased Russian Orthodox Christians en masse, demonstrate this. To address a similar but related point, if Mormon baptism is a prerequisite for salvation, I hope this is included in the article (sorry I don't have time at the moment to verify.) <a href="../../../w/e/s/User%7EWesley_19bf.html" title="User:Wesley">Wesley</a> 18:00, 15 Dec 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It's too bad the reporters in the articles you referenced do not understand the process and policies of the church and is inaccurately portraying policies. The permission is required, but unfortunately, some church members find a way around this policy. It is an unfortunate situation. For the most part, people do temple work for their own or other's relatives, not for groups of records "en masse," as you understood from the article. The LDS Church spends millions of dollars preserving records for eventual temple work and genealogy, but Church members must find and submit them for their own family, etc. <a href="../../../v/i/s/User%7EVisorstuff_508e.html" title="User:Visorstuff">Visorstuff</a> 18:59, 15 Dec 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>I removed this from the opposition section (paragraph about personal responsibility for salvation) because it is not NPOV, it doesn't fit, and it is not a complete logical thought in complement to the paragraph it resides in.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dt>however in the Latter-day Saint view, personal responsibility to accept of reject the ordinance still resides with the deceased individual.</dt>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>I am LDS (see my profile) and a fervent believer. The most honest LDS philosophy on this matter is that LDS have to acknowledge that this paragraph has a good point. We DO give talks in church saying our ancestors are waiting on us. In LDS doctrine, since it is NOT the deceased's responsibility to perform the ordinance, how can we say the subject paragraph doesn't make sense? <a href="../../../h/a/w/User%7EHawstom_bf47.html" title="User:Hawstom">Hawstom</a> 16:59, 9 Feb 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>In the Church of Jesus Christ, when a young man achieves the age of 12 he is usually ordained to the priesthood. There are no paid clergy within the church and all men typcially are ordained. There a many priesthood offices: Deacon, Teacher, Priest for the young men between the ages of 12 and 18 and then Elder and High Priest for adult men.

<p>The previous user has a valid point -- proxy ordinances were performed for Hitler. However, since it doesn't relate directly the discussion that it's in (i.e., that Jews were offended that fellow Jews were being treated insensitively by having Mormon rites peformed on their behalf), it seems to be an attempt to associate the church with neo-Nazism by insinuation. This was almost certainly not the intention of the previous user, but I think it would be a reasonable reaction from a random viewer. I leave it for a more neutral user to change things as they will. MRS</p>

<dd>I think you'll find that most Jews object to having their ancestors enrolled in a church that actively (and repeatedly) extends the benefits of its sacraments to Hitler <i>after</i> and in full knowledge of his having perpetrated the Holocaust. They would prefer that such a church keep its hands off their ancestors. - <a href="../../../j/u/d/User%7EJuden_7020.html" title="User:Juden">Juden</a> 03:48, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There is not a very robust verification process to match names coming in -- it's done in an automated manner, and even if there is a match with a previous name, a user of the family history network can override and say, no, it's actually a different person. It's a big problem -- many people have had proxy baptisms performed for them dozens of times. It's definitely something that needs to be fixed, but it is different to attribute this to intentional malice when it's most likely a poor record keeping system (I know, I have to teach people how to use it -- ugh.) Pretty excruciatingly poor judgement on the two or three people who submitted Hitler's name, though -- I have no clue what they were thinking.</p>
<p>Incidentally, the church believes that all people who lived on earth will eventually be extended an opportunity to receive this sacrament, to be accepted or rejected -- no matter how bad they are, as it will be God's judgement, not ours. The majority of these ordinances will not happen, LDS church members believe, until after Christ's coming. At this point, that group would include any Holocaust victims. So if you don't believe in Christ coming back to Earth, then you have only to worry about inept record keeping for having Holocaust survivors have ordinances performed on their behalf. There certainly has been a lot of inept record keeping, however.&#160;:( MRS</p>
<dl>
<dd>Of what value are ordinances for fictitious people? Of what value are ordinances given on the basis of improper, ineptly kept, and inaccurate records? If TempleReady can't screen out Hitler, how can it hope to get other things right? And if God will offer the benefits anyway, why persist in angering those who resent your appropriation of their ancestors? When they see God do it, they'll ask God for an explanation. In the meantime, it's <i>you</i> doing it, you're the one who has to answer for it. - <a href="../../../j/u/d/User%7EJuden_7020.html" title="User:Juden">Juden</a> 22:47, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I will add my two cents. It has always surprised me that anyone would be offended by a sacrament such as Baptism for the Dead. First, if one does not believe in the religion, is there any effect by the sacrament being performed? Heck no; it is completely meaningless. Two, does it take away from the cultural or religious heritage of the individual who is dead? As far as I can tell they are still who they were. For a Jew, they are still the dust to which they returned.</dd>
<dd>So who has actually been harmed? That's right, people who have nothing to do with the deceased...the living who have become hypersensitive. The deceased isn't talking to anyone, there is no ongoing relationship; they are turning to dust or actual dust. Does the deceased person become a Mormon? Get real. If one believes one still would have to admit there are no Mormons in heaven; nor are there Jews, Catholics, Buddhists, atheists or any other "ists". There would only be children of God belonging to the Kingdom of God. If one is not a believer, it is a total farce.</dd>
<dd>I know my statements are not politically correct, but I still find it comical. The vast majority of the "hurt" feelings come from a total lack of understanding of the sacrament being performed. Absolutely nothing has happened that is absolute. LDS believe a baptism has been performed that the deceased may reject or accept. If the deceased rejects the baptism, it would be as if the baptism was never done. If they accept the baptism, it would have been their choice. So why get your panties in a wad?</dd>
<dd>Humans seem to have an incessant need to gripe, complain, and seek offense where none was intended or given. Oh, that's right! In today's politically correct world we have to acknowledge that if one "feels" offended then we need to beat the offender senseless even if they never intended offense. Lesson: wear your feelings on your sleeve and then scream anytime anyone gets close to stepping on our hypersensitive sense of entitlement and the world will bow to our petty sense of self. Now I will step down off my soapbox. <a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStorm_Rider_8aac.html" title="User:Storm Rider">Storm Rider</a> <a href="../../../s/t/o/User_talk%7EStorm_Rider_45fc.html" title="User talk:Storm Rider"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 05:41, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Your response mirrors that of your church: if the Jews don't like it, it's their fault ("Regrettably over the years, some Jews have taken exception to the practice"). Which (along with the "it's not our fault if we baptize Hitler" response (an example appears on this page) and the "I'm unable to comprehend why the Jews don't appreciate the great favor we are doing them" and the "according to our theology, God will do it anyway even if we didn't, so we'll continue, even though it's superfluous" and "we don't think we're being obnoxious appropriating your ancestors" responses is why there is not going to be a satisfactory resolution to the problem. The idea that the "Jews who object" do so because they "don't understand" what you're doing is both untrue and obnoxious. - <a href="../../../j/u/d/User%7EJuden_7020.html" title="User:Juden">Juden</a> 22:47, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Juden, I am quite comfortable exchanging verbal jousts; mostly because I think your arguments are simple examples of "I am a victim and nobody loves me" and really are not difficult; but, then the article would not be improved. For my part, my babblings were a personal soap box.</dd>
<dd>I don't see any fault by any side of the issue. I do see where the LDS church has said they will do our best to ensure no Jews that are not the direct ancestors of members will have proxy work done for them. So your facetious wine that Mormons will do it anyway is without merit and more the words of a troll then an interested party wanting to right a wrong.</dd>
<dd>They have admitted they are imperfect and errors will happen and probably should be expected. If those outside of the church expect perfection, they will be disappointed. However, if they continue to expect perfection I would say, "Look in a mirror. If you see perfection there, then you can expect perfection from everyone else." If you continue to expect perfection, welcome to a life of disappointment and frustration. It might also be helpful to learn from my Orthodox Jewish friends and ignore what you can not change….they are happy people.</dd>
<dd>No one is appropriating your ancestors. Have you any evidence that <b>your</b> specific ancestors have had "work" done for them? How have they been appropriated? If not, let's not attempt to claim something that is not yours. It either demeans the dignity of the dead or is an attempt to aggrandize your own life.</dd>
<dd>Your very complaint is evidence enough of your lack of understanding and a desire to take offense. Worse, you still have not answered any questions posed, what is the harm? If it is a false religion anyway, these ordinances have no affect. They would be done behind closed doors out of the way of the public where no one knows about it. Who in the heck cares?</dd>
<dd>Now this bit about Hitler. I wish I could say that my heart was full of love for my fellow man and that I could have been big enough to condone such an action. However, I am not and I don’t. I understand it, but he was a man that did grossly evil things. He is not my relative, but had he been my relative I still think I would have delayed his work until the millennium. Our job is to act in a manner that is in accord to the teachings of Christ and let God judge the heart of man. The fact that the work was done, (if it was done at all the only evidence I have seen is that on an anti-Mormon site (not the most reputable source when their agenda is so flagrant), does not entitle any person any merit in the afterlife unless they are willing to accept Jesus as the Messiah. It does not remove guilt or sin.</dd>
<dd>In closing, this type of debate is something I need to forgo. I need to learn to just let it go when someone is being so obnoxious and demonstratively ignorant. However, by my very participation it is obvious I have a long way to go before my actions are in line with those taught by the gospel. If you feel the need to respond, write it on my talk page. I probably will not respond unless the conversation moves beyond whining to an actual intelligent exchange of ideas on both our parts.

<p>The statement has changed, but it currently reads:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Many Jews are annoyed that proxy baptisms are performed for their own ancestors alongside those for Nazi luminaries such as <a href="../../../a/d/o/Adolf_Hitler_fdc0.html" title="Adolf Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> and <a href="../../../e/v/a/Eva_Braun_d29a.html" title="Eva Braun">Eva Braun</a>. <sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></dd>
</dl>
<p>This is a POV statement. Which Jews are annoyed? How do we know? When were they annoyed; in 1992, 1993, 1994, now? Maybe the sentence should read, "Juden, possibly a Jew, is annoyed that a Mormon had the termity to do to attempt whey they felt was a saving ordinance for the abomination known as Hitler and his wife."</p>
<p>Juden, I do not know your edit history or your experience level, but on WIKI we do not make broad statements, but rather we quote experts of the field. In fact, the statment you insist on entering is redundant. Just read the entire section and you already have statements, many still remain unreferenced and have been for some time, for the point you are trying to make. Your language adds nothing to the section, does not make it a better article. You have reverted twice already today. I will revert again because of the above information. I suggest if you have some reason for making such an redundant statement, please share it on the discussion page rather than reverting three times. <a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStorm_Rider_8aac.html" title="User:Storm Rider">Storm Rider</a> <a href="../../../s/t/o/User_talk%7EStorm_Rider_45fc.html" title="User talk:Storm Rider"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 05:20, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Let's get the history correct...You said that Jews were "annoyed" (that is hardly the appropirate word to describe the feelings, I am sure; galled is not any better. This is the kind of statements best left for the pages of polemic writers). That is the problem, WIKI is not a place to for individuals to vent their feelings. It is an encyclopedia. If you have read any of the background on this issue on the discussion page, you would already realize the position of Mormons and Jews alike. NOTHING of what I said above was intended to harm your feelings or those of any Jew, but it was a request for REFERENCES. Further, the statement is redundant. Please read the whole section and delete everything before it that says almost exactly the same thing that you want to say again. Repetition is the first sign of a weak mind and it is not acceptable writing.</dd>
<dd>Let me repeat myself so that you understand, I want to see an excellent article that addresses the concerns of Jews.

<dd>I have done so, and well before you ordered me to. There is no "venting" going on in the article: there is simple recognition of the actual reactions provoked by the actions of the church. And as long as we're "getting the history correct", what you've repeatedly tried to do is remove all mention that temple ordinances were performed for Hitler from the article. You haven't been removing "redundancies", you've been removing facts you find uncomfortable. - <a href="../../../j/u/d/User%7EJuden_7020.html" title="User:Juden">Juden</a> 05:49, 20 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I think you will agree that I have focused on the statements of Jews being galled or annoyed. In the preceeding paragraphs this point was already stated clearly. If you feel that it is important to note all the people have have had "saving" ordinances done who have also been murderers, liars, etc., I think you will find a very long list. I suspect that a fair number of truly repugnant people have had their "work" done. In fact, my great uncle killed the county doctor over a dispute between his brother, my grandfather, and granddad's date. Simple event, went outside to fight and my guncle stepped in and shot the man. He went to prison for murder, but only served a few years because of the circumstances. I had these saving ordinances done for him. I don't know if he accepted them, but I felt it important to do. I also recognize that this work does not remove or override the judgements of God. All it does, or is believed to do, is ensure that everyone's baptism is done. If they should accept the gospel in the afterlife, then the work is done. It may be legalistic viewpoint, but it is LDS doctrine. As a LDS I try not to put myself in a position of judging who is worthy of forgiveness or not. Would I have submitted Hitler's name? I don't think so, but then again he is not a relative and I am not in a position to choose. I don't think Jews are the only people who have been horribly abused in history. Maybe a compromise is writing a section about about the feelings of those who have been terribly abused knowing that Mormons might, or have done, this baptismal work on behalf of the abusers. I think that might be more appropriate for the article.

<dd>Well, no, I don't agree that your edits were focused on "galled" or "annoyed", since what they <i>actually</i> did was remove all mention of Hitler from the article. Your church, of course, is perfectly free to welcome Hitler to its ranks, but really should not be surprised that that annoys Jews. And you are not free to exclude that Jewish reaction from this article. The NPOV policy ensures that you won't be able to. If you know of any groups similarly appalled by the church's baptisms that have been left out of the article, you should by all means add them. But the Jewish reaction is by far the most prominent one, and you shouldn't attempt to marginalize it by making it just one of many instead of what it is: the most significant and prominent reaction. - <a href="../../../j/u/d/User%7EJuden_7020.html" title="User:Juden">Juden</a> 07:13, 20 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I would not think of allowing the Jews to dislodge themselves from any degree of victimology. Nor would I ever think to disagree with your personal issues. I still think the paragraph is redundant given the preceeding paragraphs; however, if you think it puts you and all the Jews in a better light, please include everything to your hearts content. Of course, the result if an inferior product and a poorly written article. Also, NPOV has absolutely nothing to do with this petty issue. This issue surrounds redundant material. Just so we are clear, you do not represent all Jews, "Some" Jews are annoyed. Most could not care less what Mormons think, feel, or believe. This is your personal crusade to sensationalize. <a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStorm_Rider_8aac.html" title="User:Storm Rider">Storm Rider</a> <a href="../../../s/t/o/User_talk%7EStorm_Rider_45fc.html" title="User talk:Storm Rider"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 15:48, 20 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You, of course, were the first to mention POV, so I can hardly be chastised for responding to you. And your edits demonstrate that it was not any supposed redundancy you were dealing with, but rather some uncomfortable facts you wished to exclude from the article. Let me point out that it is you, not I, who have claimed I am a Jew representing all Jews - on no basis other than the fact you don't like the article mentioning the Nazi baptisms. And no one would say "all Jews" think anything. I never have, and the article never has, so you are responding in this instance to your own internal stimuli, not external ones. Good luck in dealing with those issues. - <a href="../../../j/u/d/User%7EJuden_7020.html" title="User:Juden">Juden</a> 17:46, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The quotes: "They did not get baptized when they were alive and they had a choice, and doing so after they are dead is beyond the ethical bounds," and "They are also showing a tremendous insensitivity to the living." come right after the Hitler statement, which implies that these quotes are in response to the Hitler issue, when they are actually talking about Jews who have been baptized.<a href="http://www.rickross.com/reference/mormon/mormon43.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.rickross.com/reference/mormon/mormon43.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> --<a href="../../../l/e/t/User%7ELethargy_6191.html" title="User:Lethargy">Lethargy</a> 20:49, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Unfortunately, partitioning off non-Mormon points of view degrades articles, and isn't supposed to be an acceptable practice here.

<dd>Your suggestion for a separate article that focuses completely on Juden issues has merit.

<dd>The proposal was serious and you are correct, it did contain contempt. It is also unbecoming of me; you are correct. However, your actions do not lend itself easily to cooperative engagement. You seem to have an axe to grind and insist upon overdoing it. The article has become unbalanced; thus the need for a separate article. I would think that this would be acceptable to you because two objectives are met; 1) You still get to highlight the contempt of the Jewish people for Mormon baptisms for the dead and 2) you still get to highlight some Mormons have a forgiving attitude (I am not one of them) and baptize people that have committed such atrocities in mortality that it is incomprehensible that God could be forgiving of them.

That's the reason such objections belong here. Any action to exclude documented opinions from the article because you don't share them would be a violation of the NPOV policy, which is why we must consider your proposal a dead letter.

<dd>Juden, I notice that in your request for comment you said "<i>...and any description of the posthumous baptisms of Adolf Hitler be included in this article, or placed in a separate one?</i>"</dd>
<dd>I don't have a problem with mentioning baptisms done for Hitler, in fact I think we could probably expand it to include other people who would seem unworthy of baptism. As I have stated already, I do NOT want to remove anything important from this article, but the holocaust victim section is getting too long and therefore this article is becoming unbalanced. You also wrote "<i>If there was ever any question about the motivation behind the push for a separate article, you've clarified it nicely. Thanks for that.</i>" Keep in mind that <b><u>I</u></b> was the one who suggested the separate article, so my opinions do not necessarily match those of Storm Rider. --<a href="../../../l/e/t/User%7ELethargy_6191.html" title="User:Lethargy">Lethargy</a> 19:58, 23 October 2006 (UTC)

<p>I don't think the material should be a separate article. If there weren't a "baptism for the dead" article and the information lived on an "LDS beliefs" page or something, then it would be too much. But as long as there's a "baptism for the dead" article, then the article has room for this material.

<p>The current article consists of 3,209 words. The Holocaust Victim controversy consists of 1,199 words or a full 37.4% of the article. The topic of the article is supposed to be Baptism for the dead; however the article has become unbalanced and is no longer focused on the topic, but a subtopic. Given the interest of several editors in the reactions and feelings of the Jewish people, and in particular their outrage that baptisms are done on behalf of the holocause victims, it is apparent that a a new article is the only way to do justice to this heretofore unrecognized important topic. Proposing a subarticle is not a "misuse of Wiki rules" as Juden has stated above, but is an appropriate action when a subtopic has grown so large as to overpower the purpose of the original article.</p>
<p>Given that Juden has already requested comments<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/Religion_and_philosophy" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/Religion_and_philosophy" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>, I assume that his obstructionist behavior and threats will cease and we can proceed without further edit warring. <a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStorm_Rider_8aac.html" title="User:Storm Rider">Storm Rider</a> <a href="../../../s/t/o/User_talk%7EStorm_Rider_45fc.html" title="User talk:Storm Rider"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 09:21, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If there's been edit warring, you've been a participant. And it's very peculiar for you to label me as "obstructionist" as if it were true, and to claim I've made threats, which are non-existent. Do you really think that if you say something, others will simply believe it's true? The misuse of rules, by the way, was your threat to involve me in mediation as a first step. It's never a first step. And vexatious litigation as a way to wear down those who dare to oppose you is not what mediation is supposed to be. Proposing a POV fork of an article is not a misuse of Wiki rules, it's a violation of them. And your snide way of characterizing Jewish objections (a "heretofore unrecognized important topic") is noxious. Put your venom away, and wait for the outside opinions that have been requested. By the way, no editors have expressed outrage. That's another thing you're making up. What editors have done is suggest that we include the feelings of non-Mormons in the article, and it seems that that is what you really object to. But this is not an article on "what Mormons think about Baptism for the dead". It has to include both Mormon and non-Mormon viewpoints. The current article is not imbalanced.

<p>For non-Mormons (i.e., the vast majority of people) the controversy over the Holocaust victims is one of the most notable things about baptism for the dead. <a href="../../../a/2E/j/User%7EA.J.A._7b79.html" title="User:A.J.A.">A.J.A.</a> 17:40, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>A.J.A., your comment has merit and we would like to account for it. We have stated that the subject should be addressed in this article in a summarized fashion with a full, complete, and total focus in its own article. The simple reason is that the article now is overweighted and does not address what Baptism for the dead, but rather the reactions of a single group. When we look at the size of Christian opposition section versus this the reaction of Jews it is easily apparent that this topic demands its own article. <a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStorm_Rider_8aac.html" title="User:Storm Rider">Storm Rider</a> <a href="../../../s/t/o/User_talk%7EStorm_Rider_45fc.html" title="User talk:Storm Rider"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 21:44, 24 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Actually, thus far it seems apparent that only editors especially sympathetic to the apologetic point of view think this material belongs elsewhere, and other editors do not.

<dd>So far there's not enough material for a separate article to be worth having. If there's any imbalance (which I'm not persuaded of), the article's short enough that it makes sense to just expand the other parts. <a href="../../../a/2E/j/User%7EA.J.A._7b79.html" title="User:A.J.A.">A.J.A.</a> 04:48, 25 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>A.J.A., I am not a proponent of redundancy. It has been said that redundancy is the sign of a weak mind. Excellent articles are/use concise descriptions, explanations, of the given topic. This article fails that test when it babbles on about this issue. It is almost as if an editors wants to sensationalize the issue. Juden is obstinate and refuses any compromise; it is his way or no way. You and I have seen that behavior before in editors; it is not unique, particularly with editors with as little experience as Juden on WIKI (his edit history begins August 6, 2006, which in itself is interesting. He almost only edits this single article; rather focused wouldn't you say?).</dd>
<dd>The same thing could be said in a different tone. For example, "Some Latter-day Saints have a degree of forgiveness that is very difficult to comprehend. Jews, upon discovering that a single Latter-day Saint performed a baptism by proxy for Adolf Hitler and his wife, were shocked and dismayed to an extreme. It is impossible for that anyone would have the termity to provide an ordinance of forgiveness to such a despicable human being as Adolf Hitler." NOTE I DO NOT SUPPORT THIS LANGUAGE, but it does put a different spin. What Juden has done is just repeated the same quality of phrases of the above paragraph. I do not think there should be an absence of lanaguage about baptisms being performed for Adolf Hitler and anyone else that fits his ilk, but I think the article is made less made the redundancies of focus given.</dd>
<dd>I am curious, A.J.A., I have always thought Jesus died for each and every human that ever lived. Who is so great in this life that they should sit in judgement about who should be forgiven or not. I am sorry to say that I personally would not have done the work for Hitler, but then again I am not his descendant or related to his extended family in any way. However, I can also say I would never stand in the way of anyone who desires to perform this ordinance on behalf of another.</dd>
<dd>The other thing that amazes me is that fact that a member of another religion would care what those crazy Mormons do in their temples. I am not aware of a member of another religion or even another Christian church who thinks what Mormons do has one iota of an impact on their belief, their standing before God, or anything else. It would be like me saying that because a Mufti in Iran says that I am condemned to hell I should be concerned. Who cares what the mufti says; it has no impact on me, my prayers, my belief, or the God of Israel and all mankind. If someone wants to be concerend, I view it as a personal issue. If someone wants to be offended, they will be offended regardless of my actions, thoughts, or words. <a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStorm_Rider_8aac.html" title="User:Storm Rider">Storm Rider</a> <a href="../../../s/t/o/User_talk%7EStorm_Rider_45fc.html" title="User talk:Storm Rider"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 07:16, 25 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Please Juden, stick to facts. It is my OPINION, not my beliefs, that I find it difficult for anyone to care about the beliefs, actions, voodoo, mythology, etc. of another individual or group. I do not lead my life, nor do I think it healthy for anyone else, by the dictates of the beliefs of others. This is simply a sad example of when some individuals let what others believe bother them. It says more about those individuals than it does Mormons, Muftis, or anyone else. That is opinion not belief. You are not stating facts, but sensationalizing them.

<dd>I didn't notice any glaring redundancy. The part about Hitler didn't look POV either -- the negative tone is in an attributed quote, so it's not really the same as the hypothetical spin you posted above. I suppose calling Hitler a "figure of notoriety" is a technical NPOV violation.</dd>

<p>"Church leaders have stated that the people in the afterlife for whom these ordinances have been performed will rarely reject it."</p>
<p>I've moved this here, because it sounds like speculation or someone's opinion. Everything I've ever heard indicates that church leaders tell us that we do not know whether or not someone in the afterlife accepts or rejects ordinances performed on their behalf. Maybe this sentence was based upon someone's obscure opinion in Journal of Discourses or some other piece of literature, but it is certainly not taught to modern church members today. <a href="../../../b/o/c/User%7EBochica_c6c0.html" title="User:Bochica">Bochica</a> 02:31, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
