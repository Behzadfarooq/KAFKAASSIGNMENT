<p>According to the official teaching of the <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Catholic_Church_7422.html" title="Roman Catholic Church">Catholic Church</a>, when Catholics are <a href="../../../c/o/n/Confirmation_%28sacrament%29.html" title="Confirmation (sacrament)">confirmed</a> they receive the "special Outpouring of the Holy Spirit as once granted to the apostles on the day of Pentecost" <sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup>. That is to say, the Holy Spirit is already given to the believer in <a href="../../../b/a/p/Baptism.html" title="Baptism">baptism</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/n/Confirmation_%28sacrament%29.html" title="Confirmation (sacrament)">confirmation</a>. However, a growing community of "<a href="../../../c/a/t/Catholic_Charismatic_Renewal_bdc7.html" title="Catholic Charismatic Renewal">Charismatic Renewal Catholics</a>" (numbering over 44 million in 2000<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup>), believe that there is a further experience of Empowerment with the Holy Spirit. Rather than terming this experience a 'Baptism in the Holy Spirit', because of church teaching, many <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catholic_Charismatic_Renewal_bdc7.html" title="Catholic Charismatic Renewal">Charismatic Renewal Catholics</a> prefer to speak of this as a "Release of the Spirit", emphasizing that the endowment is really a release or stirring of the gifts already given in the <a href="../../../s/a/c/Sacrament.html" title="Sacrament">Sacraments</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/p/Baptism_with_the_Holy_Spirit_0efc.html" title="Edit section: Pentecostal/Charismatic View">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Pentecostal/Charismatic View</span></h2>
<p>In <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian.html" title="Christian">Christian</a> <a href="../../../p/e/n/Pentecostal.html" title="Pentecostal">Pentecostal</a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theology.html" title="Theology">theology</a>, <b>Baptism in the Holy Spirit</b> is a distinctive Christian experience, the Biblical basis for which is found in the description of Pentecost in Jerusalem in Acts 2:1-4. Pentecostals emphasize that to be 'baptized in the Holy Spirit' is to be immersed in the Holy Spirit, and the experience presupposes conversion. That is to say, it is both distinct from and subsequent to salvation, which is itself a definite Work of the Holy Spirit. Support for this can be found in the Book of Acts, most notably the disciples of John the Baptist who were possibly converts to Christianity but had not yet heard of the Holy Spirit (Acts 19:1-7). Another compelling argument is the encounter with Simon the Sorcerer (Acts 8:12-24).</p>
<p>Charismatics are not as dogmatic, generally, as Pentecostals in the claim that the Holy Spirit Baptism is distinctly separate from the experience of salvation. Some Charismatics believe that the Gift of the Holy Spirit is 'given to all Christians', occurring with the experience of salvation. Such Charismatics claim that the gifts of the Holy Spirit -- that is, exercising spiritual power such as speaking in tongues or prophesying, are evidences of a <i>release</i> of the Holy Spirit's Power rather than the Baptism itself with the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>Charismatics and Pentecostals both point to <a href="../../../l/e/t/Letter_to_the_Ephesians_f471.html" title="Letter to the Ephesians">Ephesians</a> 5:18, where the Apostle <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_of_Tarsus_aa07.html" title="Paul of Tarsus">Paul</a> urges his audience to "<i>be filled with the Spirit</i>" using an imperative mood verb. Pentecostalists see this Gift (Baptism in the Holy Spirit) as an experience following salvation. Whereas other churches have seen being filled with the Holy Spirit to require piety and grace, some Pentecostals and Charismatics have seen it as a requirement that all who are saved must have a Pentecostal experience. This belief has its roots in Luke 24:49, in which Jesus commands His followers to wait in Jerusalem until they "are endued with Power from on high." After His followers have received this experience, they are to be His witnesses "in Jerusalem, in all Judea and Samaria, and to the end of the earth." Acts 1:8</p>
<p>In contemporary theology, there is a divergence between the two main strains of Pentecostal believers, with some organized as <a href="../../../p/e/n/Pentecostal.html" title="Pentecostal">Pentecostal</a> and others as <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charismatic_movement.html" title="Charismatic movement">Charismatic</a> or <i>Second Wave</i> churches. Both believe that the <i>Baptism in the Holy Spirit</i> is spoken of by Jesus in <a href="../../../g/o/s/Gospel_of_Luke_fff0.html" title="Gospel of Luke">Luke</a> 11:13 and also Acts 1:5 and that it was the Outpouring of the Holy Spirit prophesied in the <a href="../../../o/l/d/Old_Testament_79e6.html" title="Old Testament">Old Testament</a> books of <a href="../../../b/o/o/Book_of_Ezekiel_8d65.html" title="Book of Ezekiel">Ezekiel</a> 36:27 and <a href="../../../b/o/o/Book_of_Joel_2375.html" title="Book of Joel">Joel</a> 2:28-29. Both of these strains of Protestantism diverge from other churches in the essential nature of Grace and what Grace is granted without an individualized experience of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>Charismatics and Pentecostals differ from one another in the evidence they require for proof of Baptism in the Holy Spirit. Charismatics will look for the "Fruit of the Spirit" spoken of in <a href="../../../l/e/t/Letter_to_the_Galatians_20db.html" title="Letter to the Galatians">Galatians</a> 5:22-25, and the Pentecostals will look for <a href="../../../g/l/o/Glossolalia.html" title="Glossolalia">glossolalia</a> (speaking in tongues), prophecy, and other "Gifts of the Spirit" described in <a href="../../../1/_/c/1_Corinthians_5749.html" title="1 Corinthians">1 Corinthians</a> 12.</p>
<p>This was, according to Pentecostals, the normal experience of all in the early <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian.html" title="Christian">Christian</a> <a href="../../../c/h/u/Church.html" title="Church">Church</a>. With it comes the endowment of Power for life and service, the bestowment of the gifts and their uses in the work of the ministry (<a href="../../../g/o/s/Gospel_of_Luke_fff0.html" title="Gospel of Luke">Luke</a> 24:49; <a href="../../../a/c/t/Acts_of_the_Apostles_c9b6.html" title="Acts of the Apostles">Acts</a> 1:4-8; <a href="../../../1/_/c/1_Corinthians_5749.html" title="1 Corinthians">1 Corinthians</a> 12:1-31).</p>
<p>Not <i>all</i> <a href="../../../e/v/a/Evangelicalism.html" title="Evangelicalism">evangelical</a> Pentecostal churches would accept that all Christians <b>receive</b> the Holy Spirit at the time of their conversion or baptism, for instance the <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apostolic_Assemblies_of_Christ_b75e.html" title="Apostolic Assemblies of Christ">Apostolic Assemblies of Christ</a>, but in the more traditional <a href="../../../e/v/a/Evangelicalism.html" title="Evangelicalism">Evangelical</a> point of view, and in non-Evangelical churches, the <b>Baptism in the Holy Spirit</b> is equated with this reception. Others, even outside the Pentecostal church, consider the Baptism in the Holy Spirit as a separate experience. Even among those who accept this, opinion is divided as to whether all those who receive the Holy Spirit Baptism also receive the gift of tongues.</p>
<p>Both Pentecostal and Charismatic churches regard the <i>Baptism in the Holy Spirit</i> to be requisite for the apostolic and evangelical mission that they believe is the duty of all Christians.</p>
<p>Other relevant <a href="../../../b/i/b/Bible.html" title="Bible">Bible</a> passages include <a href="../../../a/c/t/Acts_of_the_Apostles_c9b6.html" title="Acts of the Apostles">Acts</a> 8:14-17, and Acts 2:1-13.</p>

<p><a href="../../../r/e/f/Reformed_theology.html" title="Reformed theology">Reformed theology</a> views the Baptism in the Holy Spirit as a "once-only" event that occurred at <a href="../../../p/e/n/Pentecost.html" title="Pentecost">Pentecost</a>. In contrast to the Pentecostal/Charismatic view, Reformed Theology sees the Baptism in the Holy Spirit not as an "empowering" or "gifting" experience received by individual believers, either at the time of salvation or subsequent to salvation, but rather as part of a "once-for-all", completed accomplishment for the church as a whole. The Baptism in the Holy Spirit is seen as a "seal" of the Spirit of Christ given to the Church as a whole, at one specific point in history. It is not an experience to be individually repeated among believers.</p>
<p>At Pentecost, according to the Reformed view, the Baptism in the Holy Spirit was received at once for all Christians then and future -- a completed fulfillment of the "Promise of the Father" of Acts 1:4, when the Holy Spirit was "poured out on all flesh" (Acts 2:17) for all time.</p>

<p><a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Wesley_f66e.html" title="John Wesley">John Wesley</a> spoke of the <i>Baptism in the Holy Spirit</i> and as an expression of this Baptism practiced <i>groanings which cannot be uttered</i>. His personal secretary wrote an eyewitness account of this practice which is completely consistent with the modern practice of <a href="../../../t/o/n/Tongues.html" title="Tongues">Tongues</a>. However the bulk of his followers, the <a href="../../../m/e/t/Methodism.html" title="Methodism">Methodists</a>, have historically disagreed about how Wesley defined this Baptism. While "mainstream" Methodists (such as The <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Methodist_Church_6a72.html" title="United Methodist Church">United Methodist Church</a> and its precedent bodies) have tended to agree with most Christians in the belief that the Holy Spirit is conveyed in some manner to all people, and certainly all Christians (see <a href="../../../p/r/e/Prevenient_Grace_0467.html" title="Prevenient Grace">Prevenient Grace</a>), other Wesleyans have argued that Wesley was referring to <a href="../../../e/n/t/Entire_Sanctification_1dff.html" title="Entire Sanctification">Entire Sanctification</a> despite his own writings to the contrary, the belief that after one's sins are forgiven, a Christian can be actually cleansed of sinful corruption. These Wesleyans founded the <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holiness_movement.html" title="Holiness movement">Holiness movement</a> and are today found in the <a href="../../../c/h/u/Church_of_the_Nazarene_2b91.html" title="Church of the Nazarene">Church of the Nazarene</a>, the <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salvation_Army_4c99.html" title="Salvation Army">Salvation Army</a>, and other denominations.

<p>The term <i>"Baptize with the Holy Spirit"</i> is encountered in each of the four Gospels in descriptions of <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_the_Baptist_0931.html" title="John the Baptist">John the Baptist's</a> prophecies of the coming <a href="../../../m/e/s/Messiah.html" title="Messiah">Messiah</a> who would Baptize with the Holy Spirit (Matthew 3:11, Mark 1:8, Luke 3:16, John 1:33). <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus.html" title="Jesus">Jesus</a> is quoted using the phrase <i>"Baptized with the Holy Spirit"</i> in Acts 1:5, where He Commands His followers to wait in <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jerusalem.html" title="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> for this experience, which He also referred to as the "Promise of the Father" in Acts 1:4. In Acts 11:16, the <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apostle_Peter_cc34.html" title="Apostle Peter">Apostle Peter</a> terms the experience of the household of <a href="../../../c/e/n/Centurion_Cornelius_c8c7.html" title="Centurion Cornelius">Cornelius</a> (described in Acts 10:44-46) as being <i>"Baptized with the Holy Spirit"</i>, declaring that the experience was "the same Gift that [God] gave us when we believed in the Lord Jesus Christ" at <a href="../../../p/e/n/Pentecost.html" title="Pentecost">Pentecost</a> (see Acts 11:17 and compare Acts 2:1-4). Other terminology in the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Testament_39c4.html" title="New Testament">New Testament</a> may refer as well to the Baptism in the Holy Spirit: the language of <i>filling</i> (Acts 1:4 and 9:17); other language of the Holy Spirit being <i>poured out</i> (Acts 2:17-18 (referring to Joel 2:28-29), Acts 2:33 and Acts 10:45); the language of <i>receiving</i> the Holy Spirit (Acts 8:15 and 17), the <i>falling</i> of the Holy Spirit on individuals (Acts 8:16 and Acts 10:44), and also descriptions of the Holy Spirit <i>coming upon</i> individuals (Acts 1:8 and Acts 19:6).</p>
<p>Members of Holiness churches have also referred to the <i>Baptism in the Holy Spirit</i> as a "Second Blessing" or "Second Work of Grace". This language and practice eventually evolved into the modern <a href="../../../p/e/n/Pentecostalism.html" title="Pentecostalism">Pentecostal</a> movement, and Pentecostals adapated the Holiness usage of the term as they understood it.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/p/Baptism_with_the_Holy_Spirit_0efc.html" title="Edit section: Baptism in the Holy Spirit and Speaking in Tongues">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Baptism in the Holy Spirit and Speaking in Tongues</span></h2>
<p>Biblical scholars note the close association of Biblical references to "Baptism in the Holy Spirit" with descriptions of "<a href="../../../g/l/o/Glossolalia.html" title="Glossolalia">speaking in tongues</a>". In the <a href="../../../a/c/t/Acts_of_the_Apostles_c9b6.html" title="Acts of the Apostles">Acts of the Apostles</a>, there are three specific references to individuals speaking in tongues: Acts 2:4, Acts 10:46 and Acts 19:6. Each of these instances of tongue-talking is immediately subsequent to or contemporary with an experience of being "Baptized in the Holy Spirit". The experience in Acts 2:1-4, which included tongue-talking (see Acts 2:4), may be connected with the prediction by <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus.html" title="Jesus">Jesus</a> in Acts 1:5 that the disciples would be "Baptized with the Holy Spirit not many days from now." This experience was referred to later in retrospect by Peter as well, as being "baptized with the Holy Spirit" (Acts 11:16). The description of <a href="../../../c/e/n/Centurion_Cornelius_c8c7.html" title="Centurion Cornelius">Cornelius'</a> household receiving the Gospel from <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apostle_Peter_cc34.html" title="Apostle Peter">Peter</a> and his companions in Acts 10:46, which included a reference to their "speaking in tongues", is later associated by <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apostle_Peter_cc34.html" title="Apostle Peter">Peter</a> with the <a href="../../../p/e/n/Pentecost.html" title="Pentecost">Pentecost</a> experience of the disciples, relating that <a href="../../../c/e/n/Centurion_Cornelius_c8c7.html" title="Centurion Cornelius">Cornelius</a> and his friends and family were "baptized with the Holy Spirit" as the disciples had been at <a href="../../../p/e/n/Pentecost.html" title="Pentecost">Pentecost</a> (Acts 11:16). Acts 19:6, which includes reference to individuals in <a href="../../../e/p/h/Ephesus.html" title="Ephesus">Ephesus</a> "speaking in tongues", although not specifically using the term "Baptized with the Holy Spirit", states that the "Holy Spirit came upon them" when the <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apostle_Paul_097e.html" title="Apostle Paul">Apostle Paul</a> laid his hands upon them.</p>
<p><a href="../../../p/e/n/Pentecostal.html" title="Pentecostal">Pentecostal</a> and <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charismatic_movement.html" title="Charismatic movement">charismatic Christian</a> traditions point to these passages to affirm what they believe to be adequate Scriptural basis for their view that "speaking in tongues" is an initial evidence of the Baptism in the Holy Spirit.</p>

<b>The Baptism in the Holy Spirit in the Old Testament</b></p>
<p>Gen. 41:38; Exod. 28:3; <b>31:3</b>; <b>35:31</b>; Num. <b>11:17, 25-26</b>; 24:2; Deut. <b>34:9</b>; Judges 3:10a; 6:34; 11:29a; 13:25; 14:6, 19; 15:14; 1 Sam. <b>10:6, 10-11</b>; 11:6; 16:13; <b>19:20-21, 23-24</b>; 2 Sam. 23:2; 2 Kings <b>2:9-10, 15</b>; 3:15; 1 Chron. 12:18; 2 Chron. 15:1; 24:20; Ezek. 11:24; 37:1; Mic. <b>3:8</b>.</p>
<p><br />
Because John 7:39b says, “The Holy Ghost was not yet given; because that Jesus was not yet glorified,” many Christians today believe that there was not any Baptism in the Holy Spirit in the days of the Old Testament. This is a misunderstanding, as is demonstrated by the above OT references. However, the New Testament Baptism in the Holy Spirit differs from the OT Baptism in the Holy Spirit, in that it Testifies of and Glorifies the Name of Jesus (John 15:26; 16:14). Here are some key passages of examples of OT Holy Spirit Baptism:</p>
<p><br /></p>
<ul>
<li>“I have <i>filled</i> him with the Spirit of God…” (Exod. 31:3).</li>
</ul>
<p><br /></p>
<ul>
<li>“He hath <i>filled</i> him with the Spirit of God…” (Exod. 35:31).</li>
</ul>
<p><br /></p>
<ul>
<li>“I will come down and talk with thee there: and I will take of the Spirit which is upon thee, and will put it upon them; and they shall bear the burden of the people with thee, that thou bear it not thyself alone… And <i>the Lord came down in a Cloud, and spake unto him, and took of the Spirit that was upon him, and gave it unto the seventy elders: and it came to pass, that, when the Spirit rested upon them, they prophesied</i>, and did not cease. But there remained two of the men in the camp, the name of the one was Eldad, and the name of the other Medad: and the Spirit rested upon them; and they were of them that were written, but went not out unto the tabernacle: and they prophesied in the camp” (Num. 11:17, 25-26).</li>
</ul>
<p><br /></p>
<ul>
<li>“<i>Joshua the son of Nun was full of the Spirit of Wisdom; for Moses had laid his hands upon him</i>: and the children of Israel hearkened unto him, and did as the Lord Commanded Moses” (Deut. 34:9).</li>
</ul>
<p><br /></p>
<ul>
<li>“<i>The Spirit of the Lord will come upon thee, and thou shalt prophesy with them, and shalt be turned into another man</i>…And when they came thither to the hill, behold, a company of prophets met him; and <i>the Spirit of God came upon him, and he prophesied among them</i>. And it came to pass, when all that knew him beforetime saw that, behold, he prophesied among the prophets, then the people said one to another, What is this that is come unto the son of Kish? Is Saul also among the prophets?” (1 Sam. 10:6, 10-11).</li>
</ul>
<p><br /></p>
<ul>
<li>“Saul sent messengers to take David: and when they saw the company of the prophets prophesying, and Samuel standing as appointed over them, <i>the Spirit of God was upon the messengers of Saul, and they also prophesied</i>. And when it was told Saul, he sent other messengers, and they prophesied likewise. And Saul sent messengers again the third time, and they prophesied also…And he went thither to Naioth in Ramah: and <i>the Spirit of God was upon him also, and he went on, and prophesied</i>, until he came to Naioth in Ramah. And he stripped off his clothes also, and prophesied before Samuel in like manner, and lay down naked all that day and all that night. Wherefore they say, ‘Is Saul also among the prophets?’” (1 Sam. 19:20-21, 23-24).</li>
</ul>
<p><br /></p>
<ul>
<li>“It came to pass, when they were gone over, that Elijah said unto Elisha, ‘Ask what I shall do for thee, before I be taken away from thee.’ And Elisha said, ‘<i>I pray thee, let a double portion of thy Spirit be upon me</i>.’ And he said, ‘Thou hast asked a hard thing: nevertheless, if thou see me when I am taken from thee, it shall be so unto thee; but if not, it shall not be so.’ … And when the sons of the prophets which were to view at Jericho saw him, they said, ‘<i>The Spirit of Elijah doth rest on Elisha</i>.’ And they came to meet him, and bowed themselves to the ground before him” (2 Kings 2:9-10, 15).</li>
</ul>
<p><br /></p>
<ul>
<li>“<i>Truly I am full of Power by the Spirit of the Lord</i>, and of Judgment, and of Might, to declare unto Jacob his transgression, and to Israel his sin” (Mic. 3:8).</li>
