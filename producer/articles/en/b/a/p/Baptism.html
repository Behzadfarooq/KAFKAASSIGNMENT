<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/p/Baptism.html" title="Edit section: Meaning of the word">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Meaning of the word</span></h2>
<p>The <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greek_language.html" title="Greek language">Greek</a> word <i><span lang="grc" class="polytonic" xml:lang="grc">βαπτίζω</span></i>, from which <i>baptize</i> is derived, basically means "to immerse, submerge".<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> In spite of the word's basic meaning, there is, as Strong's Concordance says, no unequivocal instance in the New Testament of its use to indicate full body immersion. There are two cases in which it clearly indicates instead a washing that did not involve complete immersion. One case is <a href="http://php.ug.cs.usyd.edu.au/~jnot4610/bibref.php?book=%20Luke&amp;verse=11:38&amp;src=!" class="external text" title="http://php.ug.cs.usyd.edu.au/~jnot4610/bibref.php?book=%20Luke&amp;verse=11:38&amp;src=!" rel="nofollow">Luke 11:38</a>, which recounts that, when Jesus ate at a Pharisee's house, "[t]he Pharisee was astonished to see that he did not first wash (literally, be "baptized" - <i><span lang="grc" class="polytonic" xml:lang="grc">βαπτίζω</span></i>) before dinner." There was obviously no expectation that Jesus would immerse himself totally before eating, and so <i><span lang="grc" class="polytonic" xml:lang="grc">βαπτίζω</span></i> does not have that meaning here. The word <i><span lang="grc" class="polytonic" xml:lang="grc">βαπτίζω</span></i> appears also in <a href="http://php.ug.cs.usyd.edu.au/~jnot4610/bibref.php?book=%20Mark&amp;verse=7:3–4a&amp;src=!" class="external text" title="http://php.ug.cs.usyd.edu.au/~jnot4610/bibref.php?book=%20Mark&amp;verse=7:3–4a&amp;src=!" rel="nofollow">Mark 7:3–4a</a> of a before-meals ritual washing: "The Pharisees ... do not eat unless they wash (<i><span lang="grc" class="polytonic" xml:lang="grc">νίπτω</span></i>, the ordinary word for washing) their hands thoroughly, observing the tradition of the elders; and when they come from the market place, they do not eat unless they wash themselves (literally, are "baptized" - <i><span lang="grc" class="polytonic" xml:lang="grc">βαπτίζω</span></i>)".<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Some religious groups understand the word <i>baptism</i> to mean whole-body immersion in water, including submersion and emergence. For others, the meaning is broad enough to encompass washing by pouring. For yet others, it is a symbolic term meaning "identification with" (e.g. Jesus) having no connection with earthly ritual.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/p/Baptism.html" title="Edit section: Apostolic period">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Apostolic period</span></h3>
<p>The Bible gives accounts of baptisms performed before this period, in the lifetime of Jesus, by John the Baptist in the Jordan River,<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup> and by Jesus himself, not personally but through his disciples.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>In the apostolic period, it reports baptisms of about three thousand persons on the day of Pentecost in Jerusalem,<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup> of men and women in Samaria,<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[6]</a></sup> of an Ethiopian eunuch,<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[7]</a></sup> of Saul, who was later called Paul,<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[8]</a></sup> of the household of Cornelius,<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[9]</a></sup> of Lydia's household,<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[10]</a></sup> of the Philippi jailer's household,<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[11]</a></sup> of many Corinthians,<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[12]</a></sup> of certain Corinthians baptized by Paul personally.<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[13]</a></sup></p>
<p>None of these accounts gives an exact description of how baptism was administered, but it is universally accepted that during this period and for many centuries later Christian baptism was, normally, by immersion.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>
<p>As has been said, "the example of Our Lord baptized in the Jordan would naturally cause rivers to be chosen as the first places of baptism; nothing, elsewhere, could be more favorable than these large streams of water for the immersion of the crowds that converted to Christianity. But, as there were not rivers everywhere, the writers of the first centuries (<a href="../../../j/u/s/Justin_Martyr_42aa.html" title="Justin Martyr">Justin</a>, <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope_Clement_I_9a32.html" title="Pope Clement I">Clement</a>, <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victor_I_2119.html" title="Victor I">Victor I</a>, and <a href="../../../t/e/r/Tertullian.html" title="Tertullian">Tertullian</a>) took care to remark that seas, lakes, ponds and springs are equally proper for baptismal immersions."<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[15]</a></sup></p>
<p>At the same time, immersion, though the usual method of baptizing, was not the only one. One of the earliest non-Biblical statements of Christian faith is found in an anonymous book of 16 short chapters known as the <a href="../../../d/i/d/Didache.html" title="Didache">Didache</a>, or Teaching of the Twelve Apostles, which most scholars attribute to the first century (see <a href="../../../d/i/d/Didache.html#Date_of_the_Didache" title="Didache">Date of the Didache</a>), predating the writers quoted in the preceding paragraph, who, with the exception of Clement, belong to the post-apostolic period. This document gives a quite explicit description of how baptism was administered:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i><b>Chapter 7. Concerning Baptism.</b> And concerning baptism, baptize this way: Having first said all these things, baptize into the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, in living water. But if you have no living water, baptize into other water; and if you cannot do so in cold water, do so in warm. But if you have neither, pour out water three times upon the head into the name of Father and Son and Holy Spirit.</i><sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[16]</a></sup></dd>
</dl>
<p>The image of "burial in baptism" used in <a href="http://php.ug.cs.usyd.edu.au/~jnot4610/bibref.php?book=%20Romans&amp;verse=6:4&amp;src=!" class="external text" title="http://php.ug.cs.usyd.edu.au/~jnot4610/bibref.php?book=%20Romans&amp;verse=6:4&amp;src=!" rel="nofollow">Romans 6:4</a> and <a href="http://php.ug.cs.usyd.edu.au/~jnot4610/bibref.php?book=%20Colossians&amp;verse=2:12&amp;src=!" class="external text" title="http://php.ug.cs.usyd.edu.au/~jnot4610/bibref.php?book=%20Colossians&amp;verse=2:12&amp;src=!" rel="nofollow">Colossians 2:12</a> is not interpreted by all as implying that total immersion was obligatory. The word "baptism" used in this context is often regarded as having a symbolic meaning.</p>
<p>On the separate, even if perhaps related, question of whether early Christians baptized infants, see the article on <a href="../../../i/n/f/Infant_baptism.html" title="Infant baptism">infant baptism</a>. Some writers who believe that baptism of infants began to be practiced only after the first century - in the third century it was certainly the universal practice and was believed to be of apostolic origin<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[17]</a></sup> - posit a link between it and the use of baptism by methods other than immersion, methods which, in spite of the evidence of the <i>Didache</i>, some claim did not at all exist in the first century.</p>
<p><a name="Post-apostolic_period" id="Post-apostolic_period"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/p/Baptism.html" title="Edit section: Post-apostolic period">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Post-apostolic period</span></h3>
<p>The following period of <a href="../../../e/a/r/Early_Christianity_6b3f.html" title="Early Christianity">Early Christianity</a> (down to 325) seems to have introduced no change. Immersion continued to be the usual method of baptism, and there is no evidence to suggest that the practice of the first century differed in any way from what is known more precisely with regard to the second and third. "In the case of the sick or dying, immersion was impossible and the sacrament was then conferred by one of the other forms. This was so well recognized that infusion or aspersion received the name of the baptism of the sick (<i>baptismus clinicorum</i>). <a href="../../../c/y/p/Cyprian.html" title="Cyprian">St. Cyprian</a><sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[18]</a></sup> (Epistle 75) declares this form to be valid. From the canons of various early councils we know that candidates for Holy orders who had been baptized by this method seem to have been regarded as irregular, but this was on account of the culpable negligence supposed to be manifested in delaying baptism until sick or dying. That such persons, however, were not to be rebaptized is an evidence that the Church held their baptism to be valid. It is also pointed out that the circumstances under which St. Paul (Acts 16) baptized his jailer and all his household seem to preclude the use of immersion. Moreover, the acts of the early martyrs frequently refer to baptizing in prisons where infusion or aspersion was certainly employed."<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[19]</a></sup></p>
<p>Archaeological uncoverings of some early Christian baptisteries too small and narrow to immerse a person completely (as in Jesus' home town of <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazareth.html" title="Nazareth">Nazareth</a>)<sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[20]</a></sup> and depictions of baptism in the Roman catacombs (see <a href="../../../i/m/a/Images_of_Jesus_f6cc.html#Christian_images_of_Jesus" title="Images of Jesus">Images of Jesus</a>) also indicate that baptism was, at least sometimes, administered by pouring water on the head of someone standing in a baptismal pool.</p>
<p>These pools are <a href="http://www.koelner-dom.de/index.php?id=88&amp;L=1#b" class="external text" title="http://www.koelner-dom.de/index.php?id=88&amp;L=1#b" rel="nofollow">described</a> in the following terms: "Related to the later medieval baptismal font, this was an early basin often in the floor of a baptistery which allowed Early Christian baptisms to take place with a pouring of water over the person standing in the pool. Many different forms of baptismal piscinas follow Antique models, but only in the 5th/6th century they were clearly related to Christian use with a definite form: e.g., the octagonal piscina with the ciborium in Cologne. More often round and square versions survive from Early Christian times."</p>
<p>The article <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02274a.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02274a.htm" rel="nofollow">Baptismal Font</a> in the <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catholic_Encyclopedia_7d0b.html" title="Catholic Encyclopedia">Catholic Encyclopedia</a> remarks: "Their average depth of less than three feet points to the continued prevalence of but partial immersion down to the eighth century. Water was provided either by natural springs or by pipes leading into the basins, though there are many examples of its being poured in from above the font, over the heads of the neophytes.

<p>Today, water <i>baptism</i> is most readily identified with <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christianity.html" title="Christianity">Christianity</a>, where it symbolizes the cleansing (remission) of sins, and the union of the believer with Christ in His death, burial and <a href="../../../r/e/s/Resurrection.html" title="Resurrection">resurrection</a> so that he becomes one of Christ's faithful. Most Christian groups practice some form of literal water-based baptism and agree that it is important, yet strongly disagree with other groups regarding any or all of several aspects of baptism, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>form of the baptism</li>
<li>recipients of baptism</li>
<li>meaning/effects of the act of baptism</li>
</ul>
<p>However, a few Christian groups assert that water-based baptism has been supplanted by the promised <a href="../../../b/a/p/Baptism.html#Baptism_in_Hyperdispensationalism" title="Baptism">baptism of the Holy Spirit</a>, and water baptism was unnecessarily carried over from the early <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewish_Christians_2c5f.html" title="Jewish Christians">Jewish Christian</a> practice.</p>

<p>Christian baptism, whose origin may be linked with the <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judaism.html" title="Judaism">Jewish</a> religious act of <i><a href="../../../m/i/k/Mikvah.html" title="Mikvah">mikvah</a></i> purification, historically takes three forms, all of which can be and are simultaneously in use by many Christian denominations (Catholics, Orthodox, Anglicans, and most mainline <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protestants.html" title="Protestants">Protestants</a>); <a href="../../../b/a/p/Baptists.html" title="Baptists">Baptists</a> and other <a href="../../../l/o/w/Low_church.html" title="Low church">low church</a> denominations tend to deny the efficacy of the first two of the following, particularly when administered to an infant or to one otherwise 'not of the age of consent'.</p>

</dl>
<p>For Christians who baptize by pouring or sprinkling, the washing with water from above pictures the cleansing of one's <a href="../../../s/i/n/Sin.html" title="Sin">sins</a> by the blood of Christ, by the Holy Spirit, who unites the baptized person to Christ in His death, and in His resurrection from the dead. It is administered from above to point to that gift of the life-giving Spirit, and to portray baptism as an act not of man, but of God. In contrast, a person baptized by immersion is enclosed under the water and brought out, to signify cleansing through death and burial with Christ and raising again in newness of life by the Holy Spirit. Regardless of the form, baptism is usually a public rite, in testimony to others of the <a href="../../../d/i/v/Divine_grace.html" title="Divine grace">grace of God</a> bestowed upon the person, and as a seal of God's promises in Christ to those who believe.</p>

<p>There are differences in views about the effect of baptism for a Christian. Some Christian groups assert baptism is a requirement for salvation and a <a href="../../../s/a/c/Sacrament.html" title="Sacrament">sacrament</a>, and speak of "baptismal regeneration". This view is shared by the <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Catholicism_4982.html" title="Roman Catholicism">Roman Catholic</a> and <a href="../../../e/a/s/Eastern_Orthodoxy_14a3.html" title="Eastern Orthodoxy">Eastern Orthodox</a> traditions, by Churches formed early during the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protestant_Reformation_5fc1.html" title="Protestant Reformation">Protestant Reformation</a> such as <a href="../../../l/u/t/Lutheranism.html" title="Lutheranism">Lutheran</a>, <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglicanism.html" title="Anglicanism">Anglican</a> and <a href="../../../m/e/t/Methodism.html" title="Methodism">Methodist</a>, and <a href="../../../r/e/s/Restorationism.html" title="Restorationism">Restorationist</a> Churches such as the <a href="../../../c/h/u/Church_of_Christ_acd4.html" title="Church of Christ">Churches of Christ</a> and <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Church_of_Jesus_Christ_of_Latter-day_Saints_1f3f.html" title="The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints">The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</a> (Mormons).

<dd>"To put it most simply, the power, effect, benefit, fruit, and purpose of Baptism is to save. No one is baptized in order to become a prince, but as the words say, to 'be saved.' To be saved, we know, is nothing else than to be delivered from sin, death, and the devil and to enter into the kingdom of Christ and live with him forever."</dd>
</dl>
<p>For Catholics, baptism by water is a sacrament of initiation into the life of children of God. (<i><a href="../../../c/a/t/Catechism_of_the_Catholic_Church_82ad.html" title="Catechism of the Catholic Church">Catechism of the Catholic Church</a></i>, 1212-13) It configures the person to Christ, (CCC 1272) and obliges the Christian to share in the Church's apostolic and missionary activity (CCC 1270). The Catholic Tradition holds that there are three types of baptism by which one can be saved: sacramental baptism (with water), baptism of desire (explicit or implicit desire to be part of the Church founded by Jesus Christ), and baptism of blood (<a href="../../../m/a/r/Martyrdom.html" title="Martyrdom">martyrdom</a>) (see topic below&#160;: <i>Catholic baptism and salvation</i>).</p>
<p>By contrast, Baptist groups espouse baptism as a worthy practice, but say that baptism has no sacramental power, and only testifies outwardly to the operation of God's power, which is invisible and internal, and completely 'separate' from the rite itself. Other Baptist groups teach that the baptism "ceremony" is "meaningful and necessary".</p>

<p>Although the term <i>baptism</i> is not used to describe the Jewish rituals, the purification rites (or <i>Mikvah</i> - ritual immersion) in <a href="../../../h/a/l/Halakha.html" title="Halakha">Jewish laws</a> and tradition are where the ritual of baptism can find its origins. In the <a href="../../../t/a/n/Tanakh.html" title="Tanakh">Tanakh</a>, and other Jewish texts, immersion in water for ritual purification was established for restoration to a condition of "ritual purity" in specific circumstances. For example, <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jew.html" title="Jew">Jews</a> who (according to the <a href="../../../l/a/w/Law_of_Moses_7c79.html" title="Law of Moses">Law of Moses</a>) became ritually "defiled" by contact with a corpse had to use the mikvah before being allowed to participate in the Holy Temple. Immersion is required for <a href="../../../g/e/r/Ger_tzedek.html" title="Ger tzedek">converts to Judaism</a> as part of their conversion to cleanse them from former practices. Immersion in the mikvah represents purification and restoration, and qualification for full religious participation in the life of the community because the cleansed person will not impose uncleanness on property or its owners. (See <a href="../../../b/o/o/Book_of_Numbers_dd63.html" title="Book of Numbers">Numbers</a> Chapter 19. and Babylonian Talmud Tractate Chagigah page 26)</p>
<p>In modern times, views regarding the <i>mikvah</i> differ greatly among the <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewish_denominations.html" title="Jewish denominations">Jewish denominations</a>. Owing to the destruction of the Holy Temple, immersion in a mikvah no longer carries its original purpose. In modern times, <a href="../../../r/e/f/Reform_Judaism_1877.html" title="Reform Judaism">Reform</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conservative_Judaism_e32a.html" title="Conservative Judaism">Conservative</a> Jews generally do not use the mikvah. <a href="../../../o/r/t/Orthodox_Judaism_0be8.html" title="Orthodox Judaism">Orthodox</a> and <a href="../../../h/a/r/Haredi_Judaism_f269.html" title="Haredi Judaism">Haredi</a> still do. It is still a requirement of all Jewish converts (<a href="../../../o/r/t/Orthodox_Judaism_0be8.html" title="Orthodox Judaism">Orthodox</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conservative_Judaism_e32a.html" title="Conservative Judaism">Conservative</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/s/Masorti.html" title="Masorti">Masorti</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/f/Reform_Judaism_1877.html" title="Reform Judaism">Reform</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberal_Judaism_d28a.html" title="Liberal Judaism">Liberal</a>, and <a href="../../../r/e/c/Reconstructionist_Judaism_c62c.html" title="Reconstructionist Judaism">Reconstructionist Judaism</a>) to immerse in a mikvah. Often those returning to Judaism after a time within another religion are required also.

A Catholic baptism</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The Christian explanation of baptism as the definitive rite, by which the baptized person is indicated to be fully-qualified for participation in the life of the Church, begins with the prophetic ministry of <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_the_Baptist_0931.html" title="John the Baptist">John the Baptist</a>, whose mother was a cousin of <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus.html" title="Jesus">Jesus</a>'s mother. Those who believe that John was indeed a <a href="../../../p/r/o/Prophet.html" title="Prophet">prophet</a> identify baptism with his message concerning <a href="../../../r/e/p/Repentance.html" title="Repentance">repentance</a> in preparation for the coming of the <a href="../../../m/e/s/Messiah.html" title="Messiah">Messiah</a>.</p>
<dl>
<dd>"He [John] went into all the country around the <a href="../../../j/o/r/Jordan_River_c62f.html" title="Jordan River">Jordan</a>, preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of <a href="../../../s/i/n/Sin.html" title="Sin">sins</a>. As is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet: "A voice of one calling in the desert, 'Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight paths for him. Every valley shall be filled in, every mountain and hill made low. The crooked roads shall become straight, the rough ways smooth. And all mankind will see God's salvation.'" <a href="http://php.ug.cs.usyd.edu.au/~jnot4610/bibref.php?book=%20Luke&amp;verse=3:3-6&amp;src=NIV" class="external text" title="http://php.ug.cs.usyd.edu.au/~jnot4610/bibref.php?book=%20Luke&amp;verse=3:3-6&amp;src=NIV" rel="nofollow">Luke 3:3-6</a></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>"Produce fruit in keeping with repentance." <a href="http://php.ug.cs.usyd.edu.au/~jnot4610/bibref.php?book=%20Luke&amp;verse=3:8&amp;src=NIV" class="external text" title="http://php.ug.cs.usyd.edu.au/~jnot4610/bibref.php?book=%20Luke&amp;verse=3:8&amp;src=NIV" rel="nofollow">Luke 3:8</a></dd>
</dl>
<p>John declared that <a href="../../../r/e/p/Repentance.html" title="Repentance">repentance</a> was necessary, prior to <a href="../../../f/o/r/Forgiveness.html" title="Forgiveness">forgiveness</a>. There must be a return to God. This implies that the stain of sin is not ineradicable, but can be removed by putting off polluting acts and returning to "the way of the Lord", all of which was symbolized in his baptism.</p>
<p>Christians believe that John also taught that his baptism was not finally sufficient, and that repentance would not attain to its goal of separation from sin, apart from a greater baptism which it was not in his power to give. According to the <a href="../../../g/o/s/Gospel_of_Luke_fff0.html" title="Gospel of Luke">Gospel of Luke</a>, John taught, "I baptize you with water; but one comes who is stronger than I, of whom I am not worthy to untie the strap of his sandals; he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire; his winnowing fork is in his hand to clean out his threshing floor and to gather the wheat into his storehouse, but the chaff he will burn with inextinguishable fire." (<a href="../../../g/o/s/Gospel_of_Luke_fff0.html" title="Gospel of Luke">Luke 3,16-17</a>) Christians believe that John's baptism shows that the effort to make oneself acceptable to God by repentance would be superseded, made complete by the coming of the <a href="../../../l/a/m/Lamb_of_God_5f64.html" title="Lamb of God">Lamb of God</a> that 'takes away' (not 'covers over') sins.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="../../../g/o/s/Gospel_of_John_9f92.html" title="Gospel of John">Gospel of John</a>, after John baptized Jesus, he testified concerning him,</p>
<dl>
<dd>"I have seen the Spirit coming down as a dove from heaven, and it remained upon him. And I had not known him, but the one who sent me to baptize with water, that one said to me, On whomever you see the Spirit coming down and remaining upon him, this is the one baptizing with the Holy Spirit. And I have seen, and I have testified that this is the <a href="../../../s/o/n/Son_of_God_bcd3.html" title="Son of God">son of God</a>." (<a href="../../../g/o/s/Gospel_of_John_9f92.html" title="Gospel of John">John 1,32-34</a>)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>"Behold the Lamb of God, that takes away the sins of the world."</dd>
</dl>
<p>From this point on, water baptism became identified with the followers of Jesus, who preached: "Repent, for the <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kingdom_of_God_9f58.html" title="Kingdom of God">kingdom of God</a> is near", and explicitly identified the coming of the kingdom with his own appearing.</p>
<p>At the end of his recorded ministry, Jesus charged the <a href="../../../t/w/e/Twelve_Apostles_56fc.html" title="Twelve Apostles">Apostles</a> to baptize "in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit" in the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Commission_a9b6.html" title="Great Commission">Great Commission</a> (<a href="http://php.ug.cs.usyd.edu.au/~jnot4610/bibref.php?book=%20Matthew&amp;verse=28:19&amp;src=31" class="external text" title="http://php.ug.cs.usyd.edu.au/~jnot4610/bibref.php?book=%20Matthew&amp;verse=28:19&amp;src=31" rel="nofollow">Matthew 28:19</a>), which has become the common method for baptizing.

<p>The <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian_ecumenism.html" title="Christian ecumenism">ecumenical</a> paper <i>Baptism, Eucharist and Ministry</i>, prepared by representatives across a spectrum of Orthodox, Roman Catholic, and Protestants traditions of Christianity, attempts to express a common understanding of baptism, as it is derived from the New Testament.</p>
<dl>
<dd>" ... according to Acts 2:38, baptisms follow from Peter's preaching baptism in the name of Jesus and lead those baptized to the receiving of Christ's Spirit, the Holy Ghost, and life in the community: "They devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching and fellowship, to the breaking of bread and the prayers" (2:42) as well as to the distribution of goods to those in need (2:45). Those who heard, who were baptized and entered the community's life, were already made witnesses of and partakers in the promises of God for the last days: the forgiveness of sins through baptism in the name of Jesus and the outpouring of the Holy Ghost on all flesh (2:38). Similarly, in what may well be a baptismal pattern, 1 Peter testifies that proclamation of the resurrection of Jesus Christ and teaching about new life (1:3-21) lead to purification and new birth (1:22-23). This, in turn, is followed by eating and drinking God's food (2:2-3), by participation in the life of the community — the royal priesthood, the new temple, the people of God (2:4-10) — and by further moral formation (2:11 ff.). At the beginning of 1 Peter the writer sets this baptism in the context of obedience to Christ and sanctification by the Spirit (1:2). So baptism into Christ is seen as baptism into the Spirit (cf. 1 Cor. 12:13). In the fourth gospel Jesus' discourse with Nicodemus indicates that birth by water and Spirit becomes the gracious means of entry into the place where God rules (John 3:5)." <a href="http://www.wcc-coe.org/wcc/what/faith/faverg.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.wcc-coe.org/wcc/what/faith/faverg.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></dd>

The Orthodox also practice infant baptism on the basis of various texts such as <a href="http://php.ug.cs.usyd.edu.au/~jnot4610/bibref.php?book=%20Matthew&amp;verse=19:14&amp;src=31" class="external text" title="http://php.ug.cs.usyd.edu.au/~jnot4610/bibref.php?book=%20Matthew&amp;verse=19:14&amp;src=31" rel="nofollow">Matthew 19:14</a> which are interpreted to support full Church membership for children, and so baptism is immediately followed by <a href="../../../c/h/r/Chrismation.html" title="Chrismation">Chrismation</a> and <a href="../../../e/u/c/Eucharist.html" title="Eucharist">Communion</a> at the next <a href="../../../d/i/v/Divine_Liturgy_b5ff.html" title="Divine Liturgy">Divine Liturgy</a> regardless of age. At least some Orthodox likewise believe that baptism removes what they call the ancestral sin (cf. [<a href="http://www.orthodoxinfo.com/praxis/exo_thoughts.aspx" class="external free" title="http://www.orthodoxinfo.com/praxis/exo_thoughts.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.orthodoxinfo.com/praxis/exo_thoughts.aspx</a> <i>An Excerpt from Exomologetarion</i>). Anglicans believe that Baptism is also the entry into the Church and therefore allows them access to all rights and responsibilities as full members, including the privilege to receive Holy Communion. Most Anglicans agree that it also cleanses the taint of what in the West is called original sin, in the East ancestral sin.</p>
<p><a href="../../../l/a/t/Latin_Rite_0191.html" title="Latin Rite">Latin Rite</a> Catholics generally baptize by affusion (pouring); Orthodox and Eastern Catholics usually by immersion, at least partial. However immersion is gaining in popularity within the Catholic Church. In newer churches, the baptismal font may be designed to expressly allow for baptism by immersion. Older church building may feature this as well by either building a new baptismal font or expanding an existing one. Anglicans practice myriad ways to be baptized, from immersion to sprinkling.</p>
<p>Although the New Testament contains no explicit instructions on how physically to administer the water of baptism (see <a href="../../../b/a/p/Baptism.html#Meaning_of_the_word" title="Baptism">Meaning of the word</a> above), Fundamentalists argue that the Greek word <span lang="grc" class="polytonic" xml:lang="grc">βαπτίζω</span> found in the New Testament means "to immerse." They also state that only immersion reflects the symbolic significance of being "buried" and "raised" with Christ (see Romans 6:3-4).</p>
<p>Excavations of ancient baptistries and the artwork of third-century Christian catacombs provide evidence that early Christians were baptized by having water poured over their heads, while they stood in a pool.</p>
<p>Baptism by pouring is closely linked with the practice of infant baptism. The Bible does not explicitly say if infants were baptized; and though children may have been baptized, their exact ages have not been determined. Infant baptism is generally practiced by those who believe in the doctrine of original or ancestral sin; later Protestant denominations tend to practice baptism based upon the confession and faith of the child of an accountable age. Although it is not considered wholly necessary for salvation, United Methodists and others baptize infants as a recognition of our complete dependence on God. That is, the wisest adult is no closer to understanding the mystery of baptism than a newborn is.</p>
<p>In some traditions, cold water is preferred over warm, as indicated in the above quotation from the <i>Didache</i>, which also said that the water should ideally be in a state of motion (living water implies motion), so immersion in stagnant water is thought less than pouring or even sprinkling.</p>
<p>The Catholic, Orthodox, and Anglican Churches practice a triple immersion or pouring in the name of the Holy <a href="../../../t/r/i/Trinity.html" title="Trinity">Trinity</a> following the "Great Commission" <a href="http://php.ug.cs.usyd.edu.au/~jnot4610/bibref.php?book=%20Matthew&amp;verse=28:18-20&amp;src=!" class="external text" title="http://php.ug.cs.usyd.edu.au/~jnot4610/bibref.php?book=%20Matthew&amp;verse=28:18-20&amp;src=!" rel="nofollow">Matthew 28:18-20</a>.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/p/Baptism.html" title="Edit section: Catholic baptism and salvation">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Catholic baptism and salvation</span></h3>
<p>In Catholic teaching, baptism plays an essential role in salvation.<sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[23]</a></sup> This teaching dates back to the teachings and practices of first-century Christians, and the connection between salvation and baptism was not, on the whole, an item of major dispute until <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martin_Luther_b8dd.html" title="Martin Luther">Martin Luther's</a> teachings regarding grace. The Church teaches that "baptism is necessary for salvation" (Catechism, 1257) and entry into heaven; and therefore, a person who knowingly, willfully and unrepentantly rejects baptism has no hope of salvation. This teaching is based on Jesus' words in the <a href="../../../g/o/s/Gospel_according_to_John_396a.html" title="Gospel according to John">Gospel according to John</a>&#160;: "Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God" (John 3:5). As stated earlier, three forms of baptism are acknowledged by the Church. Baptism by water refers to the traditional baptism whereby the individual is immersed water or has water poured over his head in the name of the Trinity.</p>
<p>Catholics are baptized in the name (singular) of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit<sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[24]</a></sup> — not three gods, but one God subsisting in three Persons. While sharing in the one divine essence, the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are distinct, not simply three "masks" or manifestations of one Person. The faith of the Church and of the individual Christian is based on a relationship with these three Persons of the one God.</p>
<p>It is claimed that <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope_Stephen_I_07ad.html" title="Pope Stephen I">Pope Stephen I</a> and <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope_Nicholas_I_22d7.html" title="Pope Nicholas I">Pope Nicholas I</a> declared that baptism not in the name of Father, Son and Holy Spirit, but in the name of Jesus only was valid. The correct interpretation of their words is disputed.<sup id="_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#_note-24" title="">[25]</a></sup> Current <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canonical_law.html" title="Canonical law">canonical law</a> requires the Trinitarian formula and water for validity<sup id="_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#_note-25" title="">[26]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The Church recognizes two other forms of baptism: "baptism of blood" and "<a href="../../../b/a/p/Baptism_of_desire.html" title="Baptism of desire">baptism of desire</a>." Baptism of blood refers to unbaptized individuals who are <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martyr.html" title="Martyr">martyred</a> for the Faith, while baptism of desire generally refers to <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catechumen.html" title="Catechumen">catechumens</a> who die before they can be baptized. The Catechism of the Catholic Church describes these two forms:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Church has always held the firm conviction that those who suffer death for the sake of the faith without having received Baptism are baptized by their death for and with Christ. This <i>Baptism of blood</i>, like the desire for Baptism, brings about the fruits of Baptism without being a sacrament. (1258)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>For catechumens who die before their Baptism, their explicit desire to receive it, together with repentance for their sins, and charity, assures them the salvation that they were not able to receive through the sacrament. (1259)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Non-Christians who seek God with a sincere heart and, moved by grace, try to do His will as they know it through the dictates of conscience can also be saved without water baptism; they are said to desire it implicitly. (cf. Catechism, 1260). As for unbaptized infants, the Church is unsure of their fate; "the Church can only entrust them to the mercy of God" (Catechism, 1261).</p>

Baptism - Saint Calixte Catacomb - 3rd century.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Since the Catholic, Orthodox, and Anglican Churches teach that baptism is a <a href="../../../s/a/c/Sacrament.html" title="Sacrament">sacrament</a> having actual spiritual and salvific effects, certain criteria must be complied with for it to be valid (i.e., to actually have those effects.) These criteria are actually broader than the ordinary practice. Violation of some rules regarding baptism renders the baptism <i>illicit</i> (in violation of the Church's laws) but still valid. For example, if a priest introduces some variation in the authorized rite for the ceremony, the baptism may still be valid (provided certain key criteria are met).</p>
<p>One of the criteria for validity is that the correct form of words be used. <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latin_Rite_0191.html" title="Latin Rite">Latin Rite</a> Roman Catholics and Episcopalians/Anglicans use the form "I baptize you..."; some <a href="../../../e/a/s/Eastern_Catholic_Churches_730e.html" title="Eastern Catholic Churches">Eastern Catholic Churches</a> and other Eastern Churches not in communion with Rome use the form "Let this servant of Christ be baptized..." or "This person is baptized by my hands...". However, all these Churches recognize each other's form as valid. The Catholic Church teaches that the use of the verb "baptize" is essential.</p>
<p>It is also considered essential that the <a href="../../../t/r/i/Trinitarian_formula.html" title="Trinitarian formula">Trinitarian formula</a> ("in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit") be used; thus they do not accept as valid baptisms of non-<a href="../../../t/r/i/Trinitarian.html" title="Trinitarian">Trinitarian</a> churches such as <a href="../../../o/n/e/Oneness_Pentecostals_b092.html" title="Oneness Pentecostals">Oneness Pentecostals</a>. There was an ancient controversy over baptism using the formula that Oneness Pentecostals use, with some ancient authorities holding it to be valid.</p>
<p>Invalid forms for baptism include "I baptize thee in the name of the Trinity", "I baptize thee in the name of Jesus", and "I baptize thee in the name of the Creator, Redeemer, and Sanctifier", for example. If these forms are used, the Sacrament of Baptism does not take place.</p>
<p>Another condition is that water be used. Some Christian groups historically have rejected the use of water for baptism, for example the <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albigensians.html" title="Albigensians">Albigensians</a>. These baptisms would not be valid, nor would a baptism in which some other liquid was used.</p>
<p>Another requirement is that the celebrant intend to perform baptism. This requirement entails merely the intention "to do what the Church does", not necessarily to have Christian faith, since it is not the person baptizing, but the Holy Spirit working through the sacrament, who produces the effects of the sacrament. Doubt about the faith of the baptizer is thus no ground for doubt about the validity of the baptism.</p>
<p>Some conditions expressly do not affect validity — for example, whether immersion, affusion or aspersion is used. However, if water is sprinkled, there is a danger that the water may not touch the skin of the unbaptized. If the water does not flow on the skin, there is no ablution and so no baptism.</p>
<p>If the water is poured, not on the head, but over another principal part of the body, such as the chest, in a case of emergency, validity is uncertain and the person will be <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conditional_baptism.html" title="Conditional baptism">conditionally baptized</a> later.</p>
<p>In many communions it does not affect validity for a single immersion to be performed rather than a triple, but in Orthodoxy this is controversial.</p>
<p>According to the Catholic Church, baptism imparts an <a href="../../../s/a/c/Sacramental_character.html" title="Sacramental character">indelible "seal"</a> upon the soul of the baptized. Thus, once baptized, an individual cannot be baptized again. This teaching was affirmed against the <a href="../../../d/o/n/Donatist.html" title="Donatist">Donatists</a>, who practiced rebaptism.</p>

It is only possible to be baptized once, thus people with valid baptisms from other denominations may not be baptized again upon conversion or transfer. Such people are accepted upon making a profession of faith and, if they have not yet validly received the sacrament of confirmation, by being confirmed. In some cases it can be difficult to decide if the original baptism was in fact valid; if there is doubt, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conditional_baptism.html" title="Conditional baptism">conditional baptism</a> is administered, with a formula on the lines of "If you are not yet baptized, I baptize you...".</p>
<p>Practice in the <a href="../../../e/a/s/Eastern_Orthodox_Church_72f2.html" title="Eastern Orthodox Church">Eastern Orthodox Church</a> for converts from other communions is not uniform, but even a convert received without administration of baptism is considered to have his previous baptism retroactively filled with grace by whatever form is used to accept him, such as by <a href="../../../c/h/r/Chrismation.html" title="Chrismation">chrismation</a> or <a href="../../../c/o/n/Confession.html" title="Confession">confession</a>. The exact procedure is dependent on local <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canon_law.html" title="Canon law">canons</a> and is the subject of some controversy.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/p/Baptism.html" title="Edit section: Who may administer a baptism">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Who may administer a baptism</span></h3>
<p>In the <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latin_Rite_0191.html" title="Latin Rite">Latin Rite</a> Catholic Church, the ordinary minister of baptism is a bishop, priest or deacon <sup id="_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#_note-27" title="">[28]</a></sup>, but in normal circumstances, only the <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parish_Priest_becc.html" title="Parish Priest">Parish Priest</a> of the person to be baptized, or someone authorized by the Parish Priest may do so licitly<sup id="_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#_note-28" title="">[29]</a></sup>. "If the ordinary minister is absent or impeded, a catechist or some other person deputed to this office by the local Ordinary, may lawfully confer baptism; indeed, in a case of necessity, any person who has the requisite intention may do so<sup id="_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#_note-29" title="">[30]</a></sup> .</p>
<p>By "a case of necessity" is principally meant imminent danger of death because of either illness or an external threat. "The requisite intention" is, at the minimum level, the intention "to do what the Church does" through the rite of baptism.</p>
<p>In the <a href="../../../e/a/s/Eastern_Catholic_Churches_730e.html" title="Eastern Catholic Churches">Eastern Catholic Churches</a>, a deacon is not considered an ordinary minister. Administration of the sacrament is reserved, as in the Latin Rite, to the Parish Priest. But, "in case of necessity, baptism can be administered by a deacon or, in his absence or if he is impeded, by another cleric, a member of an institute of consecrated life, or by any other Christian faithful; even by the mother or father, if another person is not available who knows how to baptize" <sup id="_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#_note-30" title="">[31]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Newer movements of Protestant Evangelical churches, particularly non-denominational, have begun to allow those persons most instrumental in one's faith to baptize.

<p><a href="../../../b/a/p/Baptist.html" title="Baptist">Baptist</a> groups derive their name either from the restrictions that they traditionally place on the mode and subjects of the ordinance of baptism or from a shortening of the term <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anabaptist.html" title="Anabaptist">Anabaptist</a> which means to rebaptize. Anabaptists were labeled such because they re-baptized people who had received infant baptism, sprinkling, or baptism of any sort by another denomination. Modern Baptists do not believe baptism by immersion is the only legitimate form of baptism, they simply require that you be baptized by immersion to join the Baptist church. It does not imply that any previous form of baptism, like sprinkling, is invalid. It is just a requirement of membership similar to any other organization which has an initiation ritual, only with theological meaning.</p>
<p>Baptist theologians (such as <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Gill_%28theologian%29_c499.html" title="John Gill (theologian)">John Gill</a>) teach that baptism is only for those who can understand and profess their faith. This is called <a href="../../../b/e/l/Believer%27s_baptism.html" title="Believer's baptism">believer's baptism</a>. Some, such as Gill, argue that the <a href="../../../r/e/g/Regulative_principle_of_worship.html" title="Regulative principle of worship">regulative principle of worship</a>, which many paedobaptists also advocate and which states that elements of <a href="../../../w/o/r/Worship.html" title="Worship">worship</a> (including baptism) must be based on explicit commands of Scripture, is violated by infant baptism. Some would argue that according this understanding, the re-baptisms that Baptists generally perform if a person was not regenerate when baptized also violate the Regulative Principle for Worship. Furthermore, because the New Covenant is described in <a href="../../../b/o/o/Book_of_Jeremiah_74cb.html" title="Book of Jeremiah">Jeremiah</a> <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/passage/?search=jer+31:31-34" class="external text" title="http://bible.gospelcom.net/passage/?search=jer+31:31-34" rel="nofollow">31:31-34</a> as a time when all who were members of it would have the <a href="../../../m/o/s/Mosaic_Law_c43a.html" title="Mosaic Law">law</a> written on their hearts and would know God, Baptist theology teaches that only those who are <a href="../../../b/o/r/Born_again.html" title="Born again">born again</a>, as indicated by a profession of faith, are members of the New Covenant. They view this text as speaking of the visible church in the present age, rather than as a prophetic text of God's New Covenant in Christ administered to all saints from Genesis to the present, which will be fulfilled when Christ returns to earth. Baptism is therefore not administered to those unable to make a credible confession of saving faith in Christ prior to being baptized; but it will be administered upon making this confession, regardless of the confessor's age. Some Baptist churches take exception to this and are very hesitant to baptize young children because they want to confirm whether or not they are regenerate. A confession alone is not enough for these churches, they want to see fruit of regeneration in the life of the person to be baptized, which some argue violates the example set forth in the book of Acts, which performed immediate baptisms.</p>
<p>Those who hold views influenced by the Baptists may perform the ceremony indoors in a baptismal, a swimming pool, or bathtub, or outdoors in a creek or river: as long as there is water, nothing prevents the performance of Baptism. Protestant groups influenced by these convictions usually emphasize that it memorializes the death, burial and resurrection of <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus.html" title="Jesus">Jesus</a> (Romans 6), which according to the grace of God has become the basis of repentance and new life for those who have professed belief in Him, symbolizing spiritual death with regard to sin and a new life of faith in God. They typically teach that baptism does not accomplish anything in itself, but is an outward sign or testimony, a personal act, indicating the invisible reality that the person's sins have already been washed away by the cross of Christ, and applied to their life according to their profession of faith. It is also understood to be a covenantal act, signifying entrance into the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Covenant_e0e4.html" title="New Covenant">New Covenant</a> of Christ (Jeremiah 31:31-34; Hebrews 8:8-12, Romans 6). For Baptists, baptism is a requirement for church membership, rather than a necessary requirement for salvation. Once baptized, a Baptist may move their membership to another congregation by letter.</p>
<p>The above description applies not just to those denominations using <i>Baptist</i> in their title, but also to a wide variety of other Protestant denominations deriving from the Anabaptist tradition, including some <a href="../../../m/e/n/Mennonite.html" title="Mennonite">Mennonites</a> and <a href="../../../p/e/n/Pentecostal.html" title="Pentecostal">Pentecostals</a>.</p>

<p><a href="../../../i/n/f/Infant_Baptism_ed1d.html" title="Infant Baptism">Paedobaptist</a> Covenant theologians see the administration of all the biblical covenants, including the New Covenant, as including a principle of <a href="../../../f/a/m/Family.html" title="Family">familial</a>, corporate inclusion or "generational succession." The biblical covenants between God and man include signs and seals that visibly represent the realities behind the covenants. These visible signs and symbols of God's covenant redemption are administered in a corporate manner (for instance, to households), not in an exclusively individualistic manner.</p>
<p>Baptism is considered by the Reformed churches as the visible sign of entrance into the New Covenant and therefore may be administered individually to new believers making a public profession of <a href="../../../f/a/i/Faith.html" title="Faith">faith</a>. Paedobaptists further believe this extends corporately to the households of believers which typically would include children, or individually to children or infants of believing parents (see <a href="../../../i/n/f/Infant_baptism.html" title="Infant baptism">Infant baptism</a>). In this view, baptism is thus seen as the functional replacement and sacramental equivalent of the Abrahamic rite of <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_male_circumcision.html#Male_Circumcision_in_the_Greco-Roman_World" title="History of male circumcision">circumcision</a> and symbolizes the internal cleansing from <a href="../../../s/i/n/Sin.html" title="Sin">sin</a>, among other things.</p>

As with many other <a href="../../../r/e/s/Restorationism.html" title="Restorationism">Restorationist</a> faiths, baptism must be by immersion for the remission of <a href="../../../s/i/n/Sin.html" title="Sin">sins</a> (meaning that through baptism, past sins are forgiven), and occurs after one has shown faith and repentance. LDS baptism does not intend to remit any sins other than personal ones, as the LDS Church does not believe in <a href="../../../o/r/i/Original_sin.html" title="Original sin">original sin</a>.</p>
<p><a href="../../../l/a/t/Latter_Day_Saint_da0a.html" title="Latter Day Saint">Latter Day Saint</a> baptisms also occur only after an "age of accountability", or the age at which a child begins to know right from wrong, which is defined by the church as the age of eight years. Mormonism rejects <a href="../../../i/n/f/Infant_baptism.html" title="Infant baptism">infant baptism</a>. In addition, Mormonism requires that baptism may only be performed with one who has been called and ordained by God with <a href="../../../p/r/i/Priesthood_%28Mormonism%29_0547.html" title="Priesthood (Mormonism)">priesthood</a> authority. Since the LDS Church has a lay priesthood, children raised in an LDS family are usually baptized by a father or close male friend or family member who has achieved the office of Priest which is conferred to "worthy" male members at the age of 16.</p>
<p><a href="../../../l/a/t/Latter_Day_Saint_da0a.html" title="Latter Day Saint">Latter Day Saints</a> do not believe that the gift of the <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holy_Spirit_e4ea.html" title="Holy Spirit">Holy Spirit</a> occurs immediately after baptism; rather, the gift is given by the laying on of hands in a separate <i>confirmation</i> ritual after baptism. This ritual is confirmed by Paul's actions in Acts 19:6, where, following the baptism of several followers of Christ, he "laid his hands upon" those who were baptized and they then received the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p>The process of repentance and sanctification continues by partaking of the <a href="../../../s/a/c/Sacrament_%28Mormonism%29_9b12.html" title="Sacrament (Mormonism)">Sacrament</a> every Sunday which <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latter_Day_Saints_f81e.html" title="Latter Day Saints">Latter Day Saints</a> consider to be a renewal of one's baptismal covenant with God. They also believe that baptism is symbolic both of <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus.html" title="Jesus">Jesus</a>'s death, burial and <a href="../../../r/e/s/Resurrection.html" title="Resurrection">resurrection</a> and of the death and burial of the natural or sinful man and rebirth as a disciple of Jesus of the one baptized.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Church_of_Jesus_Christ_of_Latter-day_Saints_1f3f.html" title="The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints">The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</a> (or "Mormon" Church), baptism and confirmation are only the first of several <a href="../../../o/r/d/Ordinance_%28Mormonism%29_04bc.html" title="Ordinance (Mormonism)">ordinances</a> believed to be required for <a href="../../../e/x/a/Exaltation.html" title="Exaltation">exaltation</a>. Membership into the LDS Church is granted only by baptism whether or not a person has been raised in the church. As Latter-day Saints do not recognize the validity of baptisms of other faiths, all who come into the church as converts are baptized, even if they have previously received baptism in another faith. The person being baptized must be at least eight years old. The church also practices <a href="../../../b/a/p/Baptism_for_the_dead.html" title="Baptism for the dead">baptism for the dead</a> (along with all other ordinances) "vicariously" or "by proxy" in their <a href="../../../t/e/m/Temple_%28Latter_Day_Saints%29_fbc2.html" title="Temple (Latter Day Saints)">temples</a> for anyone who did not receive these ordinances while living.</p>
<p>Baptisms inside and outside the temples are usually done in a font, although they can be performed in any body of water in which the person may be completely immersed. In Latter-day Saint temples, where proxy baptisms are performed for the dead, the fonts rest on the sculptures of twelve oxen representing the twelve tribes of Israel, following the pattern of the "molten sea" in the <a href="../../../t/e/m/Temple_of_Solomon_c3a0.html" title="Temple of Solomon">Temple of Solomon</a> (see 2 Chronicles 4:2-5). Great care is taken in the execution of the baptism; if the baptism is not executed properly it must be redone. The person administering the baptism must recite the prayer exactly, and immerse every part, limb, hair and clothing of the person being baptized. If there are any mistakes, or if any part of the person being baptized is not fully immersed, the baptism must be redone. In addition to the baptizer, two priesthood holders witness the baptism to ensure that it is performed properly.</p>

</ul>
<p>Water baptism found early in the book of Acts is, according to this view, now supplanted by the one baptism (<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20cor%2012:13;&amp;version=9;" class="external text" title="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20cor%2012:13;&amp;version=9;" rel="nofollow">1 Cor 12:13</a>) foretold by John the Baptist (Luke 3:16, John 1:33, <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%203:11;&amp;version=9;" class="external text" title="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%203:11;&amp;version=9;" rel="nofollow">Matt 3:11</a>, Acts 1:5).

Likewise, Holy Spirit Baptism is recorded as only occurring twice in all the book of Acts to selected individuals (Acts 2:1-4; Acts 10:44-46).

<p>Many in this group also argue that John's promised <a href="../../../b/a/p/Baptized_by_fire.html" title="Baptized by fire">baptism by fire</a> is pending, referring to the destruction of the world by fire (Matthew 3:12, Luke 3:17, <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?book_id=68&amp;chapter=3&amp;verse=10&amp;version=31&amp;context=verse" class="external text" title="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?book_id=68&amp;chapter=3&amp;verse=10&amp;version=31&amp;context=verse" rel="nofollow">2 Peter 3:10</a>).</p>
<p>John, as he said "baptized with water", as did Jesus's disciples to the early, Jewish Christian church. Jesus himself never personally baptized with water, but did so through his disciples (<a href="http://php.ug.cs.usyd.edu.au/~jnot4610/bibref.php?book=%20John&amp;verse=4:1-2&amp;src=!" class="external text" title="http://php.ug.cs.usyd.edu.au/~jnot4610/bibref.php?book=%20John&amp;verse=4:1-2&amp;src=!" rel="nofollow">John 4:1-2</a>). Unlike Jesus' first Apostles, Paul, his Apostle to the Gentiles, was sent to preach rather than to baptize (<a href="http://php.ug.cs.usyd.edu.au/~jnot4610/bibref.php?book=1%20Cor&amp;verse=1:17&amp;src=!" class="external text" title="http://php.ug.cs.usyd.edu.au/~jnot4610/bibref.php?book=1%20Cor&amp;verse=1:17&amp;src=!" rel="nofollow">1 Cor 1:17</a>) but did occasionally baptize, for instance in Corinth (<a href="http://php.ug.cs.usyd.edu.au/~jnot4610/bibref.php?book=1%20Cor&amp;verse=1:14-16&amp;src=!" class="external text" title="http://php.ug.cs.usyd.edu.au/~jnot4610/bibref.php?book=1%20Cor&amp;verse=1:14-16&amp;src=!" rel="nofollow">1 Cor 1:14-16</a>) and in Philippi (<a href="http://php.ug.cs.usyd.edu.au/~jnot4610/bibref.php?book=%20Acts&amp;verse=16:13&amp;src=!" class="external text" title="http://php.ug.cs.usyd.edu.au/~jnot4610/bibref.php?book=%20Acts&amp;verse=16:13&amp;src=!" rel="nofollow">Acts 16:13</a>), in the same manner as they (cf. <a href="http://php.ug.cs.usyd.edu.au/~jnot4610/bibref.php?book=%20Math&amp;verse=28:19&amp;src=!" class="external text" title="http://php.ug.cs.usyd.edu.au/~jnot4610/bibref.php?book=%20Math&amp;verse=28:19&amp;src=!" rel="nofollow">Math 28:19</a>).

<li>The <a href="../../../s/i/k/Sikh.html" title="Sikh">Sikh</a> baptism ceremony, dating to <a href="../../../1/6/9/1699.html" title="1699">1699</a>, was established when the religion's tenth leader (<a href="../../../g/u/r/Guru_Gobind_Singh_522b.html" title="Guru Gobind Singh">Guru Gobind Singh</a>) baptized 5 followers of his faith and then was baptized himself by his followers. The Sikh baptism ceremony is called <a href="../../../a/m/r/Amrit_Sanchar_5c5a.html" title="Amrit Sanchar">Amrit Sanchar</a> or <a href="../../../k/h/a/Khande_di_Pahul_7a01.html" title="Khande di Pahul">Khande di Pahul</a>.

In <a href="../../../s/i/k/Sikhism.html" title="Sikhism">Sikhism</a>, the baptized Sikh is also called an Amritdhari literally meaning <i>Amrit Taker</i> or one who has <i>Taken on Amrit</i>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>Khande Di Pahul</i> (Amrit ceremony) was initiated in the times of <a href="../../../g/u/r/Guru_Gobind_Singh_522b.html" title="Guru Gobind Singh">Guru Gobind Singh</a> when <a href="../../../k/h/a/Khalsa.html" title="Khalsa">Khalsa</a> was inaugurated at Sri <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anandpur_Sahib_9e34.html" title="Anandpur Sahib">Anandpur Sahib</a> on the day of <a href="../../../b/a/i/Baisakhi.html" title="Baisakhi">Baisakhi</a> in <a href="../../../1/6/9/1699.html" title="1699">1699</a>. <a href="../../../g/u/r/Guru_Gobind_Singh_522b.html" title="Guru Gobind Singh">Guru Gobind Singh</a> asked a gathering of Sikhs, who was prepared to die for God? At first, the people hesitated, and then one man stepped forward, and he was taken to a tent. After some time, Guru Gobind Singh came out of the tent, with blood dripping from his sword. He asked the same question again. After the next four volunteers were in the tent, he reappeared with the four, who were now all dressed like him. These five men came to be known as <b><a href="../../../p/a/n/Panj_Pyare_0008.html" title="Panj Pyare">Panj Pyares</a></b> or the <b>Beloved Five</b>. These five were initiated into the <a href="../../../k/h/a/Khalsa.html" title="Khalsa">Khalsa</a> by receiving Amrit.

</ul>
<p>Filling an iron bowl with clean water, he kept stirring it with a two-edged sword (called a <a href="../../../k/h/a/Khanda.html" title="Khanda">Khanda</a>) while reciting over it five of the sacred texts or <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bani.html" title="Bani">banis</a> — <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japji.html" title="Japji">Japji</a>, <a href="../../../j/a/a/Jaap.html" title="Jaap">Jaap</a>, Savaiyye, <a href="../../../b/e/n/Benti_Chaupai_0558.html" title="Benti Chaupai">Benti Chaupai</a> and <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anand_Sahib_3180.html" title="Anand Sahib">Anand Sahib</a>.

The five Sikhs sat on the ground around the bowl reverently as the holy water was being churned to the recitation of the sacred verses.</p>
<p>With the recitation of the five banis completed, khande di pahul or amrit, the Nectar of Immortality, was ready for administration. <a href="../../../g/u/r/Guru_Gobind_Singh_522b.html" title="Guru Gobind Singh">Guru Gobind Singh</a> gave the five Sikhs five palmsful each of it to drink.</p>

<p>Although it is technically an improper use of the term, the word baptism is sometimes used to describe other non-sacramental ceremonies.</p>
<ul>
<li>The name <i>Baptism of Bells</i> has been given to the blessing of (<a href="../../../b/e/l/Bell_%28instrument%29.html" title="Bell (instrument)">musical</a>, especially <a href="../../../c/h/u/Church_bell.html" title="Church bell">church</a>) bells, at least in France, since the eleventh century. It is derived from the washing of the bell with <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holy_water.html" title="Holy water">holy water</a> by the bishop, before he anoints it with the oil of the infirm without and with chrism within; a fuming <a href="../../../c/e/n/Censer.html" title="Censer">censer</a> is placed under it and the bishop prays that these sacramentals of the Church may, at the sound of the bell, put the demons to flight, protect from storms, and call the faithful to prayer.</li>
<li><i>Baptism of Ships</i>: at least since the time of the <a href="../../../c/r/u/Crusades.html" title="Crusades">Crusades</a>, rituals have contained a blessing for ships. The priest begs God to bless the vessel and protect those who sail in it, as He did the ark of Noah, and Peter, when the Apostle was sinking in the sea, and the ship is sprinkled with holy water.</li>

<li id="_note-13"><b><a href="#_ref-13" title="">^</a></b> "It is evident that Baptism in the early Church was by immersion" (<i>New Catholic Encyclopedia</i>, 1967, Vol. II, p. 56); "The first Christians received baptism by immersion everywhere where water was found" (Larousse du XXe Siècle, Paris, 1928); "Baptism was originally administered by immersion." (Augustus Neander, <i>History of the Christian Religion and Church, During the Three First Centuries</i>). "The majority of theologians and liturgists admit in a general manner: 1st, that there was total immersion from evangelical times until about the fourteenth century; 2nd, that from the thirteenth to the fifteenth century, partial immersion of the body was used with affusion [pouring] on the head; 3rd, that from the fifteenth century affusion alone replaced affusion accompanied by immersion" (Jules Corblet, <i>Histoire Dogmatique</i>, Vol. 1, page 223. Referring, like Corblet, to the predominant (not the sole) practice in Western Europe, the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02258b.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02258b.htm" rel="nofollow">Catholic Encyclopedia</a> states: "The most ancient form usually employed was unquestionably immersion ... immersion seems to have prevailed until the twelfth century. After that time it is found in some places even as late as the sixteenth century." Other forms were also admitted in certain circumstances, as today in the East, where immersion continues to be prevalent (see <i>Eastern Orthodox</i> in <a href="../../../b/a/p/Baptism.html#Comparative_summary" title="Baptism">Comparative Summary</a> below). In <i>Iconographie de l’Art Chrétien</i>, Vol. 1, page 240, Louis Réau too speaks of the gradual change in the West from having immersion as the chief method to having affusion: "A long period of transition must be allowed during which the ceremony of baptism was at the same time partial immersion and pouring."</li>
