In these accounts, John the Baptist preached repentence and baptism for the forgivness of sins. Jesus comes to the <a href="../../../j/o/r/Jordan_River_c62f.html" title="Jordan River">Jordan River</a> and is baptised there by John. After the baptism occurs the heavens open, a spirit like a dove descends from heaven, and God pronounces that Jesus is his son. Jesus then goes into the wilderness where the devil tempts him, and when he returns he begins his ministry. In the <a href="../../../g/o/s/Gospel_of_John_9f92.html" title="Gospel of John">gospel of John</a>, John the Baptist identifies Jesus as the Son of God but doesn't baptize him.</p>
<p>Most Christian groups view the baptism of Jesus as an important event, and historically it has caused much debate on the issue of <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christology.html" title="Christology">Christology</a>. In Roman Catholicism, the baptism of Jesus is one of the <a href="../../../l/u/m/Luminous_Mysteries_54ad.html" title="Luminous Mysteries">Luminous Mysteries</a> of the <a href="../../../r/o/s/Rosary.html" title="Rosary">Rosary</a>.</p>
<p>Jesus' baptism is commemorated on a day between <a href="../../../7/_/j/7_January_fd83.html" title="7 January">7</a> and <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_13.html" title="January 13">13 January</a> in the <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Catholic_3b40.html" title="Roman Catholic">Roman Catholic</a>, <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglican.html" title="Anglican">Anglican</a>, and some other western denominations (see <a href="../../../b/a/p/Baptism_of_the_Lord_5d28.html" title="Baptism of the Lord">Baptism of the Lord</a>).</p>
<p>Historians generally agree that Jesus was baptised by John the Baptist, as the event meets the criteria of <a href="../../../m/u/l/Multiple_attestation.html" title="Multiple attestation">multiple attestation</a> and <a href="../../../c/r/i/Criterion_of_dissimilarity.html" title="Criterion of dissimilarity">dissimilarity</a>.</p>

<p>John is placed by the passage in the wilderness of <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judea.html" title="Judea">Judea</a>, which is generally taken to refer to the region of Judea sloping down from the highlands to the <a href="../../../d/e/a/Dead_Sea_b7ec.html" title="Dead Sea">Dead Sea</a>, an arid area not well suited to habitation. The term normally translated as <i>wilderness</i> is occasionally translated as <i><a href="../../../d/e/s/Desert.html" title="Desert">desert</a></i>, although there was enough moisture to allow for <a href="../../../p/a/s/Pastoralism.html" title="Pastoralism">pastoralism</a>. According to <a href="../../../p/l/i/Pliny_the_Elder_bac4.html" title="Pliny the Elder">Pliny</a> this region was home to the <a href="../../../e/s/s/Essenes.html" title="Essenes">Essenes</a>, and John could plausibly have been one of their major leaders. According to <a href="../../../d/o/n/Donald_Guthrie_4390.html" title="Donald Guthrie">Donald Guthrie</a>, at this time wilderness was considered much closer to God than the more corrupt cities.</p>
<p>According to tradition, Jesus meets John at the <a href="../../../j/o/r/Jordan_River_c62f.html" title="Jordan River">Jordan River</a>, five miles south of the <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allenby_Bridge_d9f4.html" title="Allenby Bridge">Allenby Bridge</a>, near Qasir al-Yahud on the <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Bank_e8a4.html" title="West Bank">West Bank</a>. This location is today the site of an <a href="../../../e/a/s/Eastern_Orthodox_f7f5.html" title="Eastern Orthodox">Eastern Orthodox</a> <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monastery.html" title="Monastery">monastery</a>. However, the area is also currently an Israeli military district closed to the public, though open areas down the river are provided for Christian pilgrims who wish to perform baptism there themselves.</p>
<p>Another site showing early Christian activity on the Eastern bank in <a href="../../../j/o/r/Jordan.html" title="Jordan">Jordan</a> in Al Maghtas (<i>Baptism</i>, or <i>Immersion</i> in Arabic), is considered by some to be the site of the baptism, and is promoted as such by Jordanian tourism officials, following <a href="../../../u/n/e/UNESCO_24a0.html" title="UNESCO">UNESCO</a>-sponsored excavations.

<p>In Luke Jesus is portrayed as one of a large crowd who had come to see John and is baptised before them, while Matthew makes no mention of anyone besides John and Jesus being at the scene. The scene opens in Luke and Matthew with John delivering a polemic apparently against the <a href="../../../p/h/a/Pharisees.html" title="Pharisees">Pharisees</a> and <a href="../../../s/a/d/Sadducees.html" title="Sadducees">Sadducees</a> who are present. Luke and Matthew then re-join the account of Mark, which does not contain the polemic, by portraying Jesus as going down to John and being baptised by him.</p>

<p>Once John has been introduced into the narrative, both Matthew and Luke have him immediately described as meeting a group of people, and calling them a <i>brood of <a href="../../../v/i/p/Viper.html" title="Viper">vipers</a></i>, urging them to <a href="../../../r/e/p/Repent.html" title="Repent">repent</a>. That Mark does not contain this lecture while the other two <a href="../../../s/y/n/Synoptic_gospel.html" title="Synoptic gospel">synoptics</a> do has led scholars to believe that this section comes from the <a href="../../../q/_/d/Q_document.html" title="Q document">Q document</a>. Luke has John addressing the people that have come to see him in general, while Matthew has him address the <a href="../../../p/h/a/Pharisees.html" title="Pharisees">Pharisees</a> and <a href="../../../s/a/d/Sadducees.html" title="Sadducees">Sadducees</a> in particular. According to several scholars, the presence of the Pharisees and Sadducees does not indicate their intent to join John's movement, but rather their wish to investigate it and decide whether it is a threat to their own power. The historicity of their joint presence at this event has been questioned<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup>, since the Pharisees and Sadducees were bitter and ancient rivals.</p>
<p>A number of theories have been advanced to explain why Matthew directs John's attack to these groups while Luke focuses on the general multitude. <a href="../../../e/d/u/Eduard_Schweizer_b825.html" title="Eduard Schweizer">Eduard Schweizer</a> believes that since Matthew was writing for a more Jewish audience than Luke, Matthew did not want to offend all Jews and thus focused only on the religious authorities, who had become a direct threat to the Christianity of Matthew's time. Other scholars disagree with this view; some hold instead that <i>Pharisees and Sadducees</i> should be understood as a <i>catch-all</i> term for the Jews in general.</p>
<p><i>Brood of vipers</i> was a common expression at the time indicating those filled with malice, which <a href="../../../r/t/_/RT_France_b303.html" title="RT France">RT France</a> believes could be rooted in <a href="../../../b/o/o/Book_of_Jeremiah_74cb.html" title="Book of Jeremiah">Jeremiah</a> (46:22). Later in Matthew the expression is employed by Jesus himself on two occasions (Matthew 12:34 and 23:33). This insult has been borrowed by a number of other writers, including <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shakespeare.html" title="Shakespeare">Shakespeare</a> in <i><a href="../../../t/r/o/Troilus_and_Cressida_b6cc.html" title="Troilus and Cressida">Troilus and Cressida</a></i>, <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anthony_Trollope_d6f7.html" title="Anthony Trollope">Anthony Trollope</a> in <i><a href="../../../b/a/r/Barchester_Towers_3bf3.html" title="Barchester Towers">Barchester Towers</a></i>, <a href="../../../s/o/m/Somerset_Maugham_52d3.html" title="Somerset Maugham">Somerset Maugham</a> in <i><a href="../../../c/a/t/Catalina.html" title="Catalina">Catalina</a></i>, and in the title of <a href="../../../f/r/a/Fran%C3%A7ois_Mauriac_20da.html" title="François Mauriac">François Mauriac</a>'s <i>Le noeud de viperes</i>. In Matthew and Luke, the word used for <i>brood</i> implies <a href="../../../i/l/l/Illegitimacy.html" title="Illegitimacy">Illegitimacy</a>, and so scholars, such as <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malina.html" title="Malina">Malina</a> and Rohrbaugh, consider a more literal translation to be <i><a href="../../../s/e/r/Serpent_%28symbolism%29.html" title="Serpent (symbolism)">snake bastards</a></i>.</p>
<p>Superficially, the implication of <a href="../../../i/l/l/Illegitimacy.html" title="Illegitimacy">illegitimacy</a> and the phrase <i>don't think to yourselves "we have Abraham for a father"</i> could be seen as an attack on the importance that Judaism placed on bloodlines. Some, such as France, do not support this interpretation, and instead see the phrase as a reference to the reliance of the Pharisees and Sadducees on their own religious authority to achieve salvation. Clearly, those having formal hierarchies in their church, particularly Roman Catholicism in regard to the Pope, do not support the interpretation of France.</p>
<p>John goes on to refer to future <i>wrath</i>, although Christians interpret this as referring to the <i>righteous indignation</i> of God. To avoid this wrath, John is described as stating that the fruit of <a href="../../../r/e/p/Repentance.html" title="Repentance">repentance</a> should be made manifest, with every tree not bearing fruit being subject to destruction. The imagery used is of God as a <a href="../../../l/u/m/Lumberjack.html" title="Lumberjack">lumberjack</a> cutting down trees and then burning them, much like the imagery at Isaiah 10:34 and Jeremiah 46:22, which may have been the ultimate origin of this verse. An argument for <a href="../../../a/r/a/Aramaic_primacy.html" title="Aramaic primacy">Aramaic primacy</a> can be put forward by this since in <a href="../../../a/r/a/Aramaic.html" title="Aramaic">Aramaic</a>, the word for a tree <i>root</i> is <i>ikkar</i>, while <i>cutting down</i> is <i>kar</i>, hence in Aramaic the description is an example of <a href="../../../p/u/n/Pun.html" title="Pun">punning</a>. Scholars of the eschatological school <a href="http://www.westarinstitute.org/Polebridge/Title/5Gospels/Seven_Pillars/seven_pillars.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.westarinstitute.org/Polebridge/Title/5Gospels/Seven_Pillars/seven_pillars.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> believe that this verse originally referred to an imminent <a href="../../../l/a/s/Last_judgement.html" title="Last judgement">last judgement</a>, which, when it failed to occur, was re-interpreted by later Christianity as referring to individual damnation.</p>
<p>In Luke, the crowd react favourably to John's speech, but Matthew neglects to mention the reaction of the crowd.</p>
<p>This passage has become a source of much dispute over <a href="../../../s/o/t/Soteriology.html" title="Soteriology">soteriology</a>. While the passage could be read as indicating that good works are merely the outgrowth of internal repentance just as good fruit are the product of a healthy tree, it could also be more simply be regarded as indicating that good works <b>are</b> repentance. This verse thus became a part of the larger debate over the doctrine held by Protestants about <a href="../../../j/u/s/Justification_of_faith.html" title="Justification of faith">justification by faith</a>. The <a href="../../../a/u/g/Augsburg_Confession_9148.html" title="Augsburg Confession">Augsburg Confession</a>, for instance, states that <i>it is taught among us that such faith should produce good fruits and good works and that we must do all such good works as God has commanded, but we should do them for God’s sake and not place our trust in them as if thereby to merit favor before God</i>.</p>

<p>In Luke, Jesus is merely another member of the crowd that had come to see John, and is baptised by an unnamed individual who may or may not be John. Matthew and Mark report that Jesus seeks out John to be baptised by him. Jesus' words in Matthew are the first words that Matthew records Jesus as speaking. Since Matthew has traditionally been placed as the first book in the New Testament, these are consequently the first words in the Bible that are attributed to Jesus. Consequently, scholars have paid considerable attention to them, especially owing to their vagueness. Matthew has Jesus say that John should baptise him to <i>fulfil all righteousness</i>.</p>
<p><a href="../../../r/i/g/Righteousness.html" title="Righteousness">Righteousness</a> is an important concept in Matthew and it is usually considered that Matthew uses it to mean obedience to God; cf. Deuteronomy 6:25. Matthew, writing primarily for Jews, who were grounded in the Old Testament, often uses the word "fulfill", usually to indicate that an Old Testament prophecy has been fulfilled by Jesus. Hence the phrase <i>fulfill all righteousness</i> can be interpreted as implying that Jesus fulfilled some aspect of the Old Testament Law.</p>
<p>In the account of Jesus' baptism given in the Gospel of Luke, it is mentioned that Jesus was about 30 years old (Luke 3:23). This age requirement for priests and Levites was given in the Old Testament Law (Numbers 4:3,47). In addition a priest had to be called by God (Hebrews 5:4-10), and washed with water by an existing priest (Exodus 29:4, Leviticus 8:6). John the Baptist was a priest, inheriting the office from his father (Exodus 29:9, Numbers 25:13, Luke 1:4,13). This explains why Jesus, who according to Christianity is <a href="../../../s/i/n/Sin.html" title="Sin">sinless</a>, submitted to a ritual that signified repentance for sin. (However, Jesus was not ordained into the priesthood of Aaron, but into a superior priesthood - the Order of Melchizedek (Psalm 110:4, Hebrews 5:6, Genesis 14:18ff).)</p>
<p>Other answers are given by different Christian groups, since various branches of Christianity vary widely in their <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christology.html" title="Christology">Christology</a>. Unlike Mark and Luke, Matthew emphasizes that Jesus immediately leaves the water. Gundry believes this is because baptism would traditionally have been followed by a <a href="../../../c/o/n/Confessing.html" title="Confessing">confessing</a> of sins and the author of Matthew wanted to indicate that Jesus did not undergo this part of the ritual, owing to being sinless.</p>
<p>The baptism of Jesus is considered important by most Christian churches, but some Christian sects reject the baptism of Jesus outright; for example, the medieval <a href="../../../g/n/o/Gnostic.html" title="Gnostic">Gnostic</a> <a href="../../../b/o/g/Bogomils.html" title="Bogomils">Bogomils</a> saw John the Baptist as an agent of an <a href="../../../e/v/i/Evil.html" title="Evil">evil</a> <a href="../../../d/e/i/Deity.html" title="Deity">deity</a> (named <a href="../../../y/a/l/Yaltabaoth.html" title="Yaltabaoth">Yaltabaoth</a>), and took his ritual to be an attempt to spread the corruption of the earthly world to Jesus. Modern Christian <a href="../../../b/a/p/Baptism.html" title="Baptism">baptismal practices</a> are usually based not so much on the baptism of Jesus as rather on Jesus instruction to his disciples to go out and baptise (<a href="http://php.ug.cs.usyd.edu.au/~jnot4610/bibref.php?book=%20Matthew&amp;verse=28:19&amp;src=!" class="external text" title="http://php.ug.cs.usyd.edu.au/~jnot4610/bibref.php?book=%20Matthew&amp;verse=28:19&amp;src=!" rel="nofollow">Matthew 28:19</a> and on the baptismal accounts in Acts.</p>
<p>However, for <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anabaptist.html" title="Anabaptist">Anabaptists</a> and other <a href="../../../b/e/l/Believer%27s_Baptism_570f.html" title="Believer's Baptism">credobaptists</a> the baptism of Jesus is important evidence for how these baptisms should be carried out; the text clearly states that Jesus was baptised in a river, and was thus at least partially immersed. Hence, Anabaptists insist immersion is the proper procedure over against denominations that practice sprinkling or pouring. Since Luke states that Jesus was thirty years old at the time, Anabaptists also reject <a href="../../../i/n/f/Infant_baptism.html" title="Infant baptism">infant baptism</a>. J. Murray responds to these arguments in his book <i>Christian Baptism.</i> Interestingly, some of the earliest Anabaptists (at the time of the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protestant_Reformation_5fc1.html" title="Protestant Reformation">Protestant Reformation</a>) did not baptize by immersion.</p>
<p>Early Christian practice<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> indicates that the baptism of Jesus may perhaps have been done by only partial immersion.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup> In the New Testament, the word <i><span lang="grc" class="polytonic" xml:lang="grc">βαπτίζω</span></i> (baptizo), meaning "baptize", is never used in a context in which it clearly means <i>total</i> immersion, but is twice used to mean only partial immersion or simply washing: <a href="http://php.ug.cs.usyd.edu.au/~jnot4610/bibref.php?book=%20Luke&amp;verse=11:38&amp;src=!" class="external text" title="http://php.ug.cs.usyd.edu.au/~jnot4610/bibref.php?book=%20Luke&amp;verse=11:38&amp;src=!" rel="nofollow">Luke 11:38</a> and <a href="http://php.ug.cs.usyd.edu.au/~jnot4610/bibref.php?book=%20Mark&amp;verse=7:3–4a&amp;src=!" class="external text" title="http://php.ug.cs.usyd.edu.au/~jnot4610/bibref.php?book=%20Mark&amp;verse=7:3–4a&amp;src=!" rel="nofollow">Mark 7:3–4a</a> (see <a href="../../../b/a/p/Baptism.html#Meaning_of_the_word" title="Baptism">explanation</a> in the article on <a href="../../../b/a/p/Baptism.html" title="Baptism">Baptism</a>). This is only a possibility, no more certain than speculation that Jesus' baptism was instead by total immersion.</p>
<p>The earliest gospel, Mark, has the simplest version of Jesus' baptism, in which only Jesus sees the spirit and John pays no special attention to Jesus. In the middle gospels, the scene is more elaborate, and in Matthew John at first refuses to baptize Jesus. After all, if baptism is for the forgiveness of sin, then whay would Jesus need to be baptized? In the last-written gospel, John, the Baptist identifies Jesus as the Son of God but does not baptize him.</p>

<p>After Jesus is baptised, the narrative describes the heavens as opening, the <i>Spirit of God</i> descending as a <a href="../../../d/o/v/Dove.html" title="Dove">dove</a>, and a voice announcing that Jesus is God's <i>beloved Son</i> and that God is <i>well pleased</i> with him. The opening heavens echo the beginning of the <a href="../../../b/o/o/Book_of_Ezekiel_8d65.html" title="Book of Ezekiel">Book of Ezekiel</a>. Some ancient manuscripts read <i>opened up to him</i> rather than just <i>opened up</i>, suggesting that this event is more private, and so explaining why the crowds that Luke argues were present apparently did not notice. This, together with the symbology of the dove, is seen as one of the most <a href="../../../t/r/i/Trinitarian.html" title="Trinitarian">Trinitarian</a> passages in the entire New Testament, although liberal scholars of Christian history argue that the idea of the <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holy_Ghost_f962.html" title="Holy Ghost">Holy Ghost</a> as a distinct figure only became a mainstream view some centuries after Matthew was written, and prior to that Christianity was <a href="../../../b/i/n/Binitarian.html" title="Binitarian">Binitarian</a>.</p>
<p>While Luke is explicit about the <i>Spirit of God</i> descending in the shape of a dove, the wording of Matthew is vague enough that it could be interpreted only to suggest that the descent was in the style of a dove. There was a wide array of symbolism attached to doves at the time these passages were written. While Clarke believes the symbolism pointed to <a href="../../../n/o/a/Noah.html" title="Noah">Noah</a> sending out a dove to search out new land and hence is a symbol of re-birth, Albright and Mann note that in Hosea, the dove is a symbol for the nation of Israel. In the Graeco-Roman world the dove was a symbol of purity due to its whiteness and the belief that it had no <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bile.html" title="Bile">bile</a>, it was also a symbol of <a href="../../../a/p/h/Aphrodite.html" title="Aphrodite">Aphrodite</a>, goddess of lust. Whatever the original intent of the <a href="../../../s/y/n/Synoptic_Gospels_5bc3.html" title="Synoptic Gospels">Synoptic Gospels</a>, the dove imagery has become a well known symbol for the <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holy_Ghost_f962.html" title="Holy Ghost">Holy Ghost</a> in <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian_art.html" title="Christian art">Christian art</a>.</p>

<p>The narrative begins with a description of a man that Matthew names <i>John the Baptist</i>, Luke names <i>John the son of Zacharias</i>, and many manuscripts of Mark refer to as <i>John the baptiser</i>. On this latter name, <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anabaptists.html" title="Anabaptists">Anabaptists</a> insist on the more emphatic translation <i>John the Immerser</i>. John's title reflects his practice of baptising people in the <a href="../../../j/o/r/Jordan_River_c62f.html" title="Jordan River">Jordan</a>.</p>
<p>John is described as having sparse food and uncomfortable clothing, including the wearing of <a href="../../../h/a/i/Hairshirt.html" title="Hairshirt">hairshirts</a>. The description of John the Baptist has played an important role in the development of <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian_monasticism.html" title="Christian monasticism">Christian monasticism</a>, with John viewed as a model <a href="../../../a/s/c/Ascetic.html" title="Ascetic">ascetic</a>. However, <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Calvin_f3ea.html" title="John Calvin">Calvin</a> wholly rejected this interpretation, seeing this description simply as an accurate portrait of anyone that was forced to live in the <a href="../../../w/i/l/Wilderness.html" title="Wilderness">wilderness</a>, and instead seeing John's holiness and popularity not because of his asceticism but despite it. Albright and Mann state that the description of John the Baptist's clothing is clearly meant to echo the similar description of <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elijah.html" title="Elijah">Elijah</a> in Kings.</p>
<p>John the Baptist's diet, which the bible indicates was <i>locusts</i> and <i><a href="../../../h/o/n/Honey.html" title="Honey">honey</a></i>, has been the centre of much discussion. For many years it was traditional to interpret <i>locust</i> not as referring to <a href="../../../l/o/c/Locust.html" title="Locust">the insect</a>, but rather to the seed pods of the <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carob.html" title="Carob">carob</a> tree. Albright and Mann believe that this attempt to portray John the Baptist as eating seed pods was a combination of concern for having such a revered figure eating insects and also a belief that a true ascetic should be completely <a href="../../../v/e/g/Vegetarian.html" title="Vegetarian">vegetarian</a>. It is certainly the case that in Greek the two words are very similar, but most scholars today feel this passage is referring to the insects, particularly since the other 22 times the word is used in the Bible, it quite clearly refers to insects. Locusts are still commonly eaten in <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arabia.html" title="Arabia">Arabia</a>, and like many insects are quite <a href="../../../n/u/t/Nutrition.html" title="Nutrition">nutritious</a>. While most insects were <a href="../../../u/n/c/Unclean_animals.html" title="Unclean animals">considered unclean</a>, <a href="../../../l/e/v/Leviticus.html" title="Leviticus">Leviticus</a> permits locusts. What is meant by <i>honey</i> is also a subject that has been under dispute. Aside from the obvious product of <a href="../../../b/e/e/Bee.html" title="Bee">bees</a>, scholars such as Jones believe that it refers to gum from the <a href="../../../t/a/m/Tamarisk.html" title="Tamarisk">tamarisk</a> tree, a tasteless but nutritional type of liquid.</p>

<p>After announcing John's existence, the Gospel of Matthew immediately goes on to portray him as delivering the message <i>Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is nigh</i>, a saying adopted by doom-sayers everywhere in the western world. In both Luke and Mark, however, the message is absent. Clarke notes that this is the first of twenty-nine references to the <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kingdom_of_Heaven_a3be.html" title="Kingdom of Heaven">Kingdom of Heaven</a> in the Gospel of Matthew. Luke and Mark tend to prefer the term "kingdom of God." That Matthew uses the word <i>heaven</i> is often seen as a reflection of the sensibilities of the Jewish audience this gospel was directed to, in this case Matthew trying to avoid using the word <i>God</i>. Most scholars believe the two phrases are theologically identical because of the large number of parallel passages in Matthew and Luke in which Matthew uses "heaven" and Luke uses "God." Robert Foster rejects this view, arguing that Matthew does use the phrase "Kingdom of God" in places. He asserts that the Kingdom of God represents the earthly domain that Jesus' opponents such as Pharisees thought they resided in, while the Kingdom of Heaven represents the truer spiritual domain of Jesus and his disciples.</p>
<p>Some scholars believe that when it was written this phrase was intended to be <a href="../../../e/s/c/Eschatological.html" title="Eschatological">eschatological</a> with the Kingdom of Heaven referring to the end times. According to this theory, when the <a href="../../../l/a/s/Last_judgement.html" title="Last judgement">last judgement</a> failed to occur, Christian writers gradually redefined the term to refer to a spiritual state within, or worked to justify a much delayed end time. This passage presented a difficulty in this later endeavour as the phrase translated as "at hand" or "is near" both refer to an imminent event. Albright and Mann suggest that a better translation would be, <i>The kingdom is fast approaching.</i> France sees it as even more immediate suggesting that the phrase should be read as referring to "a state of affairs that is already beginning and demands immediate action."; i.e., "The kingdom of God is here."</p>
<p>Others such as <a href="../../../o/s/c/Oscar_Cullmann_beae.html" title="Oscar Cullmann">O. Cullmann</a> interpret John (and Jesus -- <a href="http://php.ug.cs.usyd.edu.au/~jnot4610/bibref.php?book=%20Mark&amp;verse=1:15&amp;src=!" class="external text" title="http://php.ug.cs.usyd.edu.au/~jnot4610/bibref.php?book=%20Mark&amp;verse=1:15&amp;src=!" rel="nofollow">Mark 1:15</a>) to refer to an <i>inaugurated kingdom</i>; one which is present now but is not yet come in all of its fulness, i.e. the kingdom being here (because the <i>king</i> has arrived), but without being in the fullness of its glory.</p>
<p>The word translated as <a href="../../../r/e/p/Repent.html" title="Repent">repent</a> (<i>metanoo</i>) is translated by R.T. France as "return to God." Albright and Mann state that at the time a general repentance was seen as necessary before the arrival of the messiah; evidence from Qumran seems to substantiate this claim <a href="http://www.abu.nb.ca/Courses/NTIntro/LifeJ/JohnBaptist.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.abu.nb.ca/Courses/NTIntro/LifeJ/JohnBaptist.htm" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>. Clarke notes that in the <a href="../../../v/u/l/Vulgate.html" title="Vulgate">Vulgate</a> of <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Jerome_a575.html" title="St. Jerome">St. Jerome</a> the word is translated as <i>be penitent</i> both here and in <a href="http://php.ug.cs.usyd.edu.au/~jnot4610/bibref.php?book=%20Matthew&amp;verse=4:17&amp;src=31" class="external text" title="http://php.ug.cs.usyd.edu.au/~jnot4610/bibref.php?book=%20Matthew&amp;verse=4:17&amp;src=31" rel="nofollow">Matthew 4:17</a>. Jerome's translation played a central role in the development of the <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catholic.html" title="Catholic">Catholic</a> doctrine of <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penance.html" title="Penance">penance</a>. With the increased knowledge of Greek in the Renaissance this translation began to be criticized, with <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lorenzo_Valla_2e69.html" title="Lorenzo Valla">Lorenzo Valla</a> first pointing out the error. <a href="../../../e/r/a/Erasmus.html" title="Erasmus">Erasmus</a>' <a href="../../../1/5/1/1516.html" title="1516">1516</a> translation and commentary became the first to use "repentance" rather than "penitence." It was from the doctrine of penitence that the concept of <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indulgence.html" title="Indulgence">indulgences</a> had grown, and these new translations played an important role in <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martin_Luther_b8dd.html" title="Martin Luther">Martin Luther</a>'s and other Protestants' reappraisal of these practices. Today the word is universally translated as <i>repentance</i> and the Catholic doctrine is grounded more in theology than in this passage.</p>
<p><i>The two terms can have very different meanings though. The term 'kingdom of Heaven' implies a place that god resides within; the 'kingdom of god' is what he presides over and is immanent within, our own reality.</i></p>
<p>Saying that "the kingdom of God is here (or 'nigh' =close)" is a statement of fact for someone who believes that God is present everywhere. "The Kingdom of God is close", means "look around you at this manifestation of God, He is nearer than you think."</p>

<p>In all three of the synoptic gospels, John the Baptist is described as completing a prophecy made by Isaiah; as the individual who would make straight the paths of <i>him</i>. The quote, coming from <a href="http://php.ug.cs.usyd.edu.au/~jnot4610/bibref.php?book=%20Isaiah&amp;verse=40:3&amp;src=!" class="external text" title="http://php.ug.cs.usyd.edu.au/~jnot4610/bibref.php?book=%20Isaiah&amp;verse=40:3&amp;src=!" rel="nofollow">Isaiah 40:3</a>, refers in its original context to making straight the paths of <i>God</i>, and specifically in reference to later escape from the <a href="../../../b/a/b/Babylonian_Captivity_6a80.html" title="Babylonian Captivity">Babylonian Captivity</a>. Rather than the <a href="../../../m/a/s/Masoretic_text.html" title="Masoretic text">masoretic text</a>, the quote uses the wording of the <a href="../../../s/e/p/Septuagint.html" title="Septuagint">Septuagint</a>, typical for New Testament quotations of the Old Testament. There are actually two justifiable punctuations for the quote, the traditional one being <i>the voice of one crying in the wilderness: Prepare ....</i>; the other reading, pointed to by the masoretic version of Isaiah, and hence supported by most modern scholars, is <i>the voice of one crying: In the wilderness prepare ....</i>, which substantially changes the meaning, and is far less clearly applicable to Christian interpretations of John.</p>
<p>John goes on, in the narrative, to refer to his successor as separating the <a href="../../../w/h/e/Wheat.html" title="Wheat">wheat</a> from the <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chaff.html" title="Chaff">chaff</a>, via <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winnowing.html" title="Winnowing">winnowing</a>. The term <i>winnowing fork</i> is most likely to be the implement that the original narrative described the successor as using to do this, but older translations are very variant, for example having <i>fan</i>, <i>shovel</i>, or <i>broom.</i> In the <a href="../../../e/a/s/Eastern_Orthodox_f7f5.html" title="Eastern Orthodox">Eastern Orthodox</a> church the word was most often interpreted as <i>broom</i> and consequently Jesus is commonly depicted holding a broom in Eastern Orthodox iconography. For the same reason that John's humility in the face of Jesus is often doubted, John, whose movement appears to have remained far more significant at the turn of the first century than Christianity was, is often considered by non-Christian scholars to never to have made such a prediction about his successor, it instead being pious forgery by the authors of the synoptics.</p>

<p>Matthew and Luke describe Jews coming from <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jerusalem.html" title="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>, all of <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judea.html" title="Judea">Judea</a>, and the areas around the <a href="../../../j/o/r/Jordan_River_c62f.html" title="Jordan River">Jordan River</a> to hear John the Baptist preach. This description is considered quite historically credible as it is backed up by <a href="../../../j/o/s/Josephus.html" title="Josephus">Josephus</a>. In his <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antiquities_of_the_Jews_2130.html" title="Antiquities of the Jews">Antiquities of the Jews</a> he says of John the Baptist that the <i>others came in crowds about him, for they were very greatly moved by hearing his words</i> <a href="http://www.religiousstudies.uncc.edu/jdtabor/john.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.religiousstudies.uncc.edu/jdtabor/john.html" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>. At the time Josephus was writing, around <a href="../../../9/7/_/97_AD_97cd.html" title="97 AD">97 AD</a>, John the Baptist seems to have been an exceptionally more significant figure than Jesus - while John is frequently mentioned, <a href="../../../h/i/s/Historicity_of_Jesus_a712.html" title="Historicity of Jesus">hardly anyone appears to have mentioned Jesus</a> at all, in all of Josephus' writing, there are only two very short passages which could possibly refer to Jesus, and <a href="../../../j/o/s/Josephus_on_Jesus_9e8f.html" title="Josephus on Jesus">these are heavily disputed</a> with most scholars seeing them as forgeries.</p>
<p>Unlike Luke and Mark, Matthew has John being hesitant about baptising Jesus, with John stating that Jesus should be the one baptising him, though it doesn't exactly state why. The <a href="../../../g/o/s/Gospel_of_the_Nazoraeans_77be.html" title="Gospel of the Nazoraeans">Gospel of the Nazoraeans</a>, a text which has very strong similarities to Matthew, adds a clarification to this story, stating that it was because of Jesus' sinlessness that John felt he was the one who should be baptised. In the environment the author of Matthew is presumed to have been writing in there would still have been many followers of John the Baptist who felt he was equal to or superior to Jesus. And while the followers of John are often presented as becoming followers of Jesus, the ancient <a href="../../../m/a/n/Mandaean.html" title="Mandaean">Mandaean</a> religion, which survives much reduced to the present day, claims to originate in a direct line from the followers of John, without being tainted by following Jesus.</p>

<p>The origins of John's baptism ritual are much discussed amongst scholars. While various forms of baptism were practised throughout the Jewish world at this time, only those of John the Baptist and <a href="../../../q/u/m/Qumran.html" title="Qumran">Qumran</a> are associated with an <a href="../../../e/s/c/Eschatological.html" title="Eschatological">eschatological</a> purpose, leading many scholars to connect John to the group that wrote the <a href="../../../d/e/a/Dead_Sea_Scrolls_dfda.html" title="Dead Sea Scrolls">Dead Sea Scrolls</a>. In Qumran, however, baptism was a regular ritual for individuals rather than the one-time event that the synoptics present it as. Obviously that the synoptics describe John as baptising people in the once-off form could simply be due to them putting a spin on John's historic behaviour due to being motivated to present him in accordance with Christian theology.</p>
<p>John the Baptist is described by Mark, Luke, and Matthew as referring to a successor, who will baptise with <i>the Holy spirit and with fire</i>. While John is presented as describing this successor as coming <i>after</i> him, the word usually translated <i>after</i> does not have a chronological meaning, but means instead <i>after in sequence</i>. It is often used to indicate that the one following is a disciple of the previous one (e.g., <a href="http://php.ug.cs.usyd.edu.au/~jnot4610/bibref.php?book=%20Matthew&amp;verse=4:19&amp;src=31" class="external text" title="http://php.ug.cs.usyd.edu.au/~jnot4610/bibref.php?book=%20Matthew&amp;verse=4:19&amp;src=31" rel="nofollow">Matthew 4:19</a>), but it also can simply mean <i>behind</i> (<a href="http://php.ug.cs.usyd.edu.au/~jnot4610/bibref.php?book=%20Matthew&amp;verse=16:23&amp;src=31" class="external text" title="http://php.ug.cs.usyd.edu.au/~jnot4610/bibref.php?book=%20Matthew&amp;verse=16:23&amp;src=31" rel="nofollow">Matthew 16:23</a>) or <i>after</i> (Luke 19:14, "after him"). At the time, the disciple of a Rabbi would be expected to perform menial chores, but as <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sandal_%28footwear%29.html" title="Sandal (footwear)">sandals</a> were considered unclean, a view still persisting in the <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middle_East_c1c7.html" title="Middle East">Middle East</a> today, not even a disciple would deal with them, only the lowest slave. Thus when the text has John presenting himself as not worthy to carry/untie the sandals of his successor, he is presenting himself as extremely lowly in comparison.</p>
<p><i>Fire</i> was often a symbol of wrath, and so linking the <i>Holy Spirit</i> with it superficially appears to clash with portrayals of this <i>Spirit</i> elsewhere in the New Testament as a gentle thing. Some translations avoid using the word <i>fire</i> due to this, but when the Dead Sea Scrolls were discovered, it appeared that several of its texts make the connection between <i>Holy Spirit</i> and wrath, and so most scholars now see the wording here as original, and the other portrayals as misinterpreted. See also Acts 2.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that John baptising by water and his successor by fire has parallels with Sumerian mythology. <a href="../../../e/n/k/Enki.html" title="Enki">Enki</a>, who the Babylonians later knew as <a href="../../../e/a/_/Ea_%28Babylonian_god%29_f899.html" title="Ea (Babylonian god)">Ea</a>, had become known as <a href="../../../o/a/n/Oannes.html" title="Oannes">Oannes</a> by the time of John, and <i>Oannes</i> is almost identical to <i>Ioannes</i>, which is how the name of John the Baptist is spelt in the original Greek of the New Testament. Enki/Oannes was the god of (pure) water, and although the first god, the god of creation, over time he lost significance, while the sun god grew more important. Hence in folklore of the period in the surrounding region, Oannes, god of water, was superseded by the god of the sun, the god of fire. That this folklore surrounding Oannes may have influenced a narrative built around a historic figure named Ioannes, is of course somewhat tenuous, though the connection is frequently made by those who question the <a href="../../../h/i/s/Historicity_of_Jesus_a712.html" title="Historicity of Jesus">Historicity of Jesus</a>.</p>

<p>"Many early Christians seem to have been embarrassed by the fact that Yeshua [ <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus.html" title="Jesus">Jesus</a> ] was baptized by Yohannan [ <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_the_Baptist_0931.html" title="John the Baptist">John the Baptist</a> ]. The Gospel of John neglects to mention this baptism...The <a href="../../../s/y/n/Synoptics.html" title="Synoptics">Synoptics</a> try several ploys. Yohannan says <i>he</i> should be baptized by Yeshua, and not the other way around. Misleading hints are given that someone else, not Yohannan, performed the Immersion. Scholars in general (except for <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Graves_42ea.html" title="Robert Graves">Robert Graves</a> and Joshua Podro...) take for granted that the story of Mariam [ <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mary.html" title="Mary">Mary</a> ] and Yeshua's brothers persuading a reluctant Yeshua to be baptized belongs to the same category...[but] this story would <i>add</i> to the embarrassment... The idea for this very important step in Yeshua's life comes from somebody else... Yeshua changes his mind. He admits he may be guilty of a sin after all." (<i>The Logia of Yeshua</i>, by Davenport and Urrutia, footnote 2, pages 50-51.)</p>
