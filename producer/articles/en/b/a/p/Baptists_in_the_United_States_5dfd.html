<p>Baptist roots go all the way back to the Reformation in England in the sixteenth century. Various dissenters called for purification of the church and a return to the New Testament Christian example. These dissenters also called for strict accountability in their covenant with God. One of the prominent dissenters who arose in the seventeenth century was John Smyth. Smyth was a strong proponent of adult baptism and 1609 went as far as to rebaptize himself and others. Smyth's action was a sign of the first English Baptist church. Smyth also introduced the Arminian view that God's grace is for everyone and not just predestined individuals.</p>
<p><a href="../../../r/o/g/Roger_Williams_fe73.html" title="Roger Williams">Roger Williams</a> was one of the Baptists to come over and in 1639 he established the first Baptist Church in America in Providence, Rhode Island.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> <sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup> Baptist churches exist in each of the United States today and it is estimated that more than 70% of all Baptists worldwide reside in the United States.</p>
<p>Though each Baptist church is autonomous, Baptists have traditionally organized into associations of like-minded churches for mutual edification, consultation, and ministerial support. The constituency of these associations is based on geographical and doctrinal criteria. Many such associations of Baptist churches have developed in the United States since Baptists first came to the continent.</p>
<p>Until the early 1800s these Baptist associations tended to center around a local or regional area where the constituent churches could conveniently meet. However, beginning with the spread of the Philadelphia Baptist Association beyond its original bounds and the rise of the modern missions movement, Baptists began to move towards developing national associations.</p>
<p>The first national association was the Triennial Convention, founded in the early 1800s, which met every three years. The Triennial Convention was basically a loose organization with the purpose of raising funds for various independent benevolent, educational and mission societies.</p>
<p>Over the years other nationwide Baptist associations have originated as divisions from these two major groups. There are a few smaller associations that have never identified with any of the national organizations, as well as many Independent Baptist churches which are not part of any organization, local or national.</p>

While its theology was originally rooted in the same Confessions of Faith as more traditional Baptists, as a rule the ABCUSA churches have adopted a more modernist approach to the Scriptures and are thus more tolerant of doctrinal diversity.</p>
<p>The primary strength of the ABCUSA is in the northeast, but it also has a strong presence throughout the midwest, the southwest, and on the west coast. They operate a number of colleges and other benevolent enterprises.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/p/Baptists_in_the_United_States_5dfd.html" title="Edit section: Southern Baptist Convention">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Southern Baptist Convention</span></h3>

<p>The <b><a href="../../../s/o/u/Southern_Baptist_Convention_a9e3.html" title="Southern Baptist Convention">Southern Baptist Convention</a></b> (<b>SBC</b>) is the largest group of Baptists in the United States. Its greatest numerical strength is in the south, but it has churches in every state and a strong presence in many northern and western states.</p>
<p>In 1844 the issues of missionary work and slavery came to a peak. The Home Mission Society gave a statement saying that a person could not be a missionary and wish to keep his slaves as property. This caused the Home Mission Society to separate northern and southern divisions. As a result of this the Baptists in the south met in May of 1845 and organized the <a href="../../../s/o/u/Southern_Baptist_Convention_a9e3.html" title="Southern Baptist Convention">Southern Baptist Convention</a>.</p>
<p>Women began making great strides in 1872, when Henry Tupper of the Foreign Mission Board appointed Edmonia Moon for missionary service. She was the first woman to receive this honor.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup> In 1888 the Woman's Missionary Union was instituted. Women were recognized and encouraged to form missionary circles and children's bands in churches and Sunday Schools.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Although all Southern Baptists would be viewed as ‘’conservative’’ by those outside the tradition, from the late 1970s forward there was a well-orchestrated takeover of the SBC by a conservative/fundamentalist group who wrested control from those who have come to be call “moderates.” In 1987, some moderates formed the Southern Baptist Alliance, a group which has since become supportive of the <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homosexual.html" title="Homosexual">homosexual</a> agenda. In 1991, other moderates established the <a href="../../../c/o/o/Cooperative_Baptist_Fellowship_7022.html" title="Cooperative Baptist Fellowship">Cooperative Baptist Fellowship</a> (CBF), a group emphasizing global missions and what it considers “historic Baptist values” such as local church autonomy, priesthood of all believers and religious liberty. Unlike the Southern Baptist Convention, the Cooperative Baptist Fellowship ordains women for ministry.</p>
<p>The Southern Baptist Convention has over 15 million members and continues to grow. In 2005, the SBC recorded almost 300,000 baptisms. More Southern Baptist churches are being planted each year through the efforts of the <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_American_Mission_Board_a1d6.html" title="North American Mission Board">North American Mission Board</a> and the <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Mission_Board_d3ca.html" title="International Mission Board">International Mission Board</a>, the denomination's domestic and foreign missions agencies.</p>

<p>Before the American Civil War, the African American Baptists were, with many notable exceptions, members of the same churches as the whites (though often relegated to a segregated status within the church). After the war they left the white churches to start separate churches and associations.</p>
<p>Today there are several historically African-American groups in the United States; the largest of these is the <b><a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Baptist_Convention_8f75.html" title="National Baptist Convention">National Baptist Convention</a></b>.

<p>Independent Baptist churches are completely independent of any association or group, though they usually maintain some sort of fellowship with likeminded churches. They share the traditional Baptist doctrinal distinctives, but they adhere to what they see as a Biblical principle of churches' individuality.</p>
<p>Independent Baptists believe that this approach to ministry leaves pastors and people in the church free to work as a local ministry, instead of national work, which, in their view, can be less efficient.</p>
<p>Independent Baptists are strictly Biblicist in their theology, adhering to the traditional Baptist understanding of the Bible and of faith. The same doctrinal variations that exist within (or between) the Baptist associations exist among Independent Baptists.</p>
<p>Independent Baptists operate educational institutions such as:</p>
