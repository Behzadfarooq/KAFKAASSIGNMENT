<p>Hi, Batmanand. I’m here hoping you can reconsider your view in <a href="../../../r/o/m/Talk%7ERoman_Catholic_Church_3f0f.html" title="Talk:Roman Catholic Church">Talk:Roman Catholic Church</a>. Bellow, I’ll explain my position on the matter.</p>
<p>First I'd like to say that, according to WP naming conventions, the choice of the name for the articles should <i>not</i> be a matter of "one POV" over "another POV". The question is not if the entity has any "right" to call herself CC, but if CC is the best name for the article according to WP guidelines. According to the guidelines, any POV issues should be resolved inside the articles – and not by the choice of its name.</p>
<p>You said that "when most people in <i>the West</i> say "Catholic Church" they mean the Church of Rome; but that is not necessarily indicative of what the rest of the world thinks." That's true. However, the official WP policy says that: <i>article naming should give priority to what the majority of <b>English speakers</b> would most easily recognize...</i> (emphasis mine). AFAIK, English speakers typically live in the west, or at least have strong contact with Western culture.</p>
<p>(As a side-note, Eastern English speakers might even be more aware of the inadequacy of the modifier "Roman" when applyed to the CC as a whole, because of the closer contact with the non-roman Eastern Rite part of the Catholic Church).</p>
<p>When more objective procedures are applied, the results so far seem always to favor CC over RCC. For example: no one has come up with a good rebuttal of Vaquero's analysis in <a href="../../../v/a/q/User%7EVaquero100_CC_vs._RCC_5396.html" title="User:Vaquero100/CC vs. RCC">CC vs. RCC</a>.</p>
<p>That’s it, thanks for your time considering my arguments.

<p>What is your opinion on this grammatical puzzler: should the two "German Occupation of Luxembourg" articles say "... of Luxembourg <i>in</i> World War I/II" or "... of Luxembourg <i>during</i> World War I/II"? I have been thinking over it for a good few minutes, but cannot come to an answer. It seems natural to ask either "what did you do in the war?" or "what did you do during the war?"; although I suppose the former suggests that you were in the war itself, whilst the second is perhaps concerned with the time period the war was in. I suppose in that case maybe we should come to a decision on whether the military occupations were part of the wars, or happened contemporaneously? <a href="../../../b/a/t/User%7EBatmanand_01d3.html" title="User:Batmanand">Batmanand</a> | <strong class="selflink">Talk</strong> 00:16, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>There is certainly a difference between the two adjectives (in this sense, specifically), and, originally, I believed that the articles should be moved to 'during', to reflect just that distinction. However, I have since changed my mind on the grounds that the German occupation was an intrinsic part of the war. This was certainly the case in the Second World War, and to quite a degree in the first (German high command was in Luxembourg City, Clausen was bombed by the RAF, Luxembourg's evacuation was a term of the Armistice, thousands of Luxembourgers did fight, etc).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Another question is that of the general case. The reason that they were titled as such in the first place was that they were being standardised with other occupations in the Second World War. Although (IMO) Luxembourg <i>was</i> a part of the World Wars, other countries might not be classified as having been, yet would still be burdened by the incorrect adjective ('in') for the purposes of standardisation. 'During' is applicable whether one is part of the war or apart, so would probably be preferable for the entire article series, such that it might then embrace those countries that weren't actively engaged. <a href="../../../b/a/s/User%7EBastin8_Signature_e263.html" title="User:Bastin8/Signature">Bastin</a> 00:28, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi David. I waded briefly into the discussion about the main page article count a couple of weeks back, and opposed your decision to remove it from the top of the page. I have not been involved more recently, but have followed the discussions as they have unfolded, and still am of the opinion that you are wrong. However, or perhaps furthermore, I am disgusted by the personal attacks, the lack of good faith, the incivility, the plain, old-fashioned <i>rudeness</i> that has been displayed by those who seem to share my opinion on the matter. You have been subjected to vitriolic hatred, and I am sorry for that. I am ashamed that there are those who cannot argue cogently <u>and</u> politely who are "on my side".</p>
<p>I am glad to note that you yourself have behaved impeccably. I feel it is important that someone who disagrees with you can come forward and say that the behaviour of others who disagree with you is wrong, and should not be tolerated. I hope you understand that - leaving the dispute itself aside - you most certainly have my whole-hearted support in the way you have conducted yourself. <a href="../../../b/a/t/User%7EBatmanand_01d3.html" title="User:Batmanand">Batmanand</a> | <strong class="selflink">Talk</strong> 14:08, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks very much for your kind words. I always make it a point to view people on an individual basis (<i>not</i> based upon their positions on particular issues or the conduct of those who happen to agree with them). In other words, rest assured that I would never lump you together with the likes of Juicifer or condemn your viewpoint because it happens to overlap with his.</dd>
<dd>I truly am attempting to gauge consensus (or lack thereof) and help to apply it appropriately, and I'm especially glad to know that not all of my opponents believe that I'm acting in bad faith. Thanks again for reassuring me of this. It's also nice to be reminded that some people are still capable of disagreeing without being disagreeable. &#160;:-) —<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Levy_9c9c.html" title="User:David Levy">David Levy</a> 15:18, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I am not prone to personal attacks, but sometimes mockery is the only way. Specifically, in dealing with people that wont debate constructivly anyway.

<dd>I understand what you are saying, but 1. there are rules that can be broken (perhaps in the spirit of <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a>), and then there are things so basic as courtesy and <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a> which should never, ever be broken and 2. the scale of you personal attack I felt was above and beyond mere "annoyance". I appreciate the fact that you admit that you have done wrong, and I hope you now stop, but that does not mean that the original act was right. I hope this is the end of the matter, and that the <i>real</i> issue, of what to do to article count, can now be resolved harmoniously. <a href="../../../b/a/t/User%7EBatmanand_01d3.html" title="User:Batmanand">Batmanand</a> | <strong class="selflink">Talk</strong> 18:11, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Look a number of people had been trying to pin him down on the matter for 2 weeks and rather that making or responding to substantive points, discussing both sided of the issue etc, he simply kept responding with with word-games pedantry and obfuscation. I get the feeling that he would happily go on forever. Indeed he wore out zoggy and a number of other contributors with his trolling, and they dropped out of the debate begging others to take up the reigns. His behaviour has been utterly insufferable, as an admin he should be straightforward and productive, my response was not writ en not in anger but as a calculated way to put an end to the matter. I don't believe he would now be brazen enough to change it back without a strong consensus. That is all want, I think that has been achieved, and if I have underestimated his zealotry, he must know that he will only end up looking very very silly indeed. <a href="../../../j/u/i/User%7EJuicifer_867e.html" title="User:Juicifer">juicifer</a> 18:43, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Batmanand!<br />
Thanks! It certainly is a fascinating concept. And I must say I've really enjoyed the resulting conversation - I'll use the Reference Desk more often now. My teachers frequently complain about the questions I ask! --<a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFir0002_4967.html" title="User:Fir0002">Fir0002</a> 10:33, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Batmanand,</p>
<p>Thanks for adding the image to the <a href="../../../t/e/l/Telecommunication.html" title="Telecommunication">Telecommunication</a> article. It fits the lead well.</p>

<p>I've restored the cosmic energy rubbish. Yes, it's rubbish. The problem is, everything from Osmanagic and his Foundation is rubbish. See the talk page for the continued discussion on this. --<a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonz_dbdd.html" title="User:Ronz">Ronz</a> 03:00, 17 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, your changes will make it easier to pull the claims out of the intro and put in the proper sections of the article. The claim is actually made by Osmanagic, so it's a bit misleading with the "some commentators" inclusion, but easily fixed when the intro is cleaned up. Archaeological Park: Bosnian Pyramid of the Sun Foundation is the group controlling the promotion and management of the "pyramids". I don't think we've had any problems with them directly with editing Wikipedia, but they're responsible for almost all of the English-language news about the "pyramids" via their press releases that most news agencies print without the slightest fact checking. So far, Archeology magazine is the only source we have (that I can recall top-of-my-head) that has actually investigated the claims of the Foundation in any depth. The Foundation's tactics besides controlling as much of the information as possible is to directly attack anyone that holds an opinion contrary to theirs. To date, the Foundation's claims beyond the "pyramids" existance and locations are extremely vague: information on the age, structure, size, builders, etc all vary from report to report, one report often contradicting another, with no attempt to clarify the claims and providing little or no verifiable information on what the claims are based upon. --<a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonz_dbdd.html" title="User:Ronz">Ronz</a> 14:45, 17 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>wow. I didnt think I would see the day when wikipedia was censored just like the web in China. Also, maybe just maybe you could give people some TIME to continue working on the page and finish it, at least to the best of their ability, before deleting it. <a href="../../../s/a/a/User%7ESaatana_33ba.html" title="User:Saatana">Saatana</a> 10:36, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>um....quite honestly I see no place in my post that could be taken as a personal attack but whatever man. I have found that a great many of the people on here are delusional, egotistical bastards who do not care about the others on here and what their opinions are. You say stuff like "happy editing" and "I will be glad to help" but that's just a bunch of bullshit. (Again this is not a personal attack, just a broad statement of what my dealings with people here have showed me so far.) And as to my experiences here, not only have they not been "not entirely positive", but have downright sucked. <a href="../../../s/a/a/User%7ESaatana_33ba.html" title="User:Saatana">Saatana</a> 11:02, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>ok I am sorry but I saw you're comment on how [FT] isn't significant inside or outside the counterstrike community and on this you are just wrong. [FT] IS significant inside the counterstrike community because we have been around for longer than something like 97% of all gaming clans. Also, it is our original server FTC2 that the &lt;DAWG&gt; clan was a major part of. Also [FT] servers are not only places to play counterstrike but also are places to chill with friends and have a good time<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 24.225.66.38 (<a href="../../../2/4/2E/User_talk%7E24.225.66.38.html" title="User talk:24.225.66.38">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.225.66.38_f35e.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.225.66.38">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<p>I noticed your addition to the Martin Luther intro. I might be inclined to change it a little because having a graduate masters in Luther's theology I know that Luther was not a radical reformer. Your are <b>right</b> though to say that his view are "radical" in a sense. Luther, though, is considered by Reformation scholars as a "conservative" reformer. I think that the bit about being a controversial figure is a good point that you have made here.--<a href="../../../d/r/b/User%7EDrboisclair_bb95.html" title="User:Drboisclair">Drboisclair</a> 16:42, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think that it is a good addition about him or his legacy being controversial. Perhaps better would be "As a result of this, his revolutionary theological views, and the Reformation his legacy remains a controversial one." This might be revised by some of the other editors; however, I believe that you add an important point to the lead-in intro.--<a href="../../../d/r/b/User%7EDrboisclair_bb95.html" title="User:Drboisclair">Drboisclair</a> 17:21, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think that I am not capturing what you are trying to do here. You are saying: "As a result [of all of what Luther said and did] ... his legacy remains a controversial one", so scratch my suggestion above. Everything about the man was controversial. I think that it is a good way to end the intro. Let's see what the other editors do with it.--<a href="../../../d/r/b/User%7EDrboisclair_bb95.html" title="User:Drboisclair">Drboisclair</a> 17:25, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
