<p>Does anyone know the real sizes of both the Balkan and Ottoman army at the Battle of Kosovo? Some say the Balkan-Army was 70.000 And the Ottoman 140.000, Some say 70.000/80.000&#160;?? What is Real?</p>
<ul>
<li>In nearly every historical battle, we face such a situation. The thing you say is very similar to the number of Persians(old sources claimed the Persian Army was 1,000,000) in the battle of Thermopylae. Actually the Persian army could contain a maximum 200,000 soldiers due to resources. In the period which the Battle of Kosovo took place both sides didn't have the power to gather forces like 70,000-140,000. The Ottoman Army became that powerful during and after the <a href="../../../f/a/l/Fall_of_Constantinople_fc68.html" title="Fall of Constantinople">Fall of Constantinople</a>. In my opinion, the numbers given in the article, in a sense, are true. With respect, the noble member of Kayı Tribe, <a href="../../../d/e/l/User%7EDeliogul_430e.html" title="User:Deliogul">Deliogul</a> 10:06, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>There are some contradicions regarding this article. This battle should be specified that it was between Balkan coualition countries and Ottomans and not Serbs and Ottomans. So the truth is as followes; The Ruling Knez (Prince) of Serbia, Lazar Hrebeljanović, marshalled a Christian coalition force, made mainly of Serbs from Serbian empire and from Bosnia, but also troops from Hungary, Albania, and even a contingent of Saxon mercenaries.</p>
<p>There was no one but Serbs in Bosnia at that time. It was ruled by Kotromanic family - their heraldic symbols are used even in todays Bosnia</p>
<p>Everybody knows that Kosovopoje or Fushe Kosova in Albanian was the proper place to have a battle as it was a field. This battle was fought there not because there was living serbs but it was an ideal place for battels. <s>It is a fake history by saying that Kosovo was inhabited by serbs.</s> At that time there was only Serbs living in Kosovo and Metohija. That's why most important churches are there, many enlisted as UNESCO World Heritage . (Ones that survived Albanian onslaught 1999-present day - more than 150 were burned)</p>

<p>There are several references on this discussion page to the question of how Kosovo, a place which is central to Serbian identity due to the 1389 battle, lost its Serbian population. An interesting question, and one which has a happily simple answer. Hopefully knowing the answer will put an end to some of the innuendo I see on both sides here...</p>
<p>It all dates back to the late 17th century (1600s), and the wars between the Hapsburg (Austrian) empire and the Ottomans. According to Donald Quataert's excellent history of the Ottoman empire, "To escape the fighting, Orthodox Serbs migrated from their homes around Kosovo...in an intermittent stream northward. Until then, the Kosovo area had been heavily Serb but after they left, Albanians gradually migrated in, filling the empty spaces. Some Serbs moved into eastern Bosnia, where, consequently, a Muslim majority gave way to an important Christian presence." (The Ottoman Empire, 1700-1922, p. 117)</p>
<p>Voila the answer to the arguments here, and an important background to the Bosnia and Kosovo crises of the 1990s.</p>
<p>Ottoman frontier provinces often saw this kind of mass migration of subsidiary populations, especially "untrustworthy" subsidiary populations, during times of conflict and decline. The most striking example, of course, is the mass deportation of Eastern Orthodox Armenians from the frontier with Eastern Orthodox Russia at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th century. We all know how that one ended.</p>
<p>Happily, the key to the Kosovo/Serb conundrum is not nearly as blood-drenched.<a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackbrown_f3ac.html" title="User:Jackbrown">jackbrown</a> 13:17, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The current slaughter in the former Yugoslavia began under the sign of a myth about a battle fought 600 years ago. In 1389 at the Battle of Kosovo Field a multinational Christian force was defeated by its Ottoman foe. This was part of the expansion of the Ottoman Empire that eventually spent itself at the gates of Vienna some three centuries later. What actually happened in the Battle of Kosovo is a matter of dispute. But its importance to all the people of the region is undeniable: Bosnians, Serbs and Albanians all commemorate it in their folk songs. Yet it was only the Serbs who turned the defeat on Kosovo Field into a powerful national myth. This happened in the second half of the nineteenth century when Serbia became an internationally recognized kingdom and was able to contemplate the ‘liberation of ancestral lands’ – the sandjak of Novi Pazar, Kosovo, Macedonia – from Ottoman rule. Since much of this territory was inhabited by non-Serbs, it was necessary to reinterpret the Kosovo battle as an exclusively Ottoman-Serb affair. The aim was to present the Albanians in particular, ethnically dominant throughout the Kosovo region, as usurpers of Serbian historic territory. They were portrayed as a ‘people without history’: a barbarian tribe genetically incapable of cultural or political development. Serb-Albanian conflict was thus built into the very foundation of the Kosovo myth. Indeed, from its early days the Serbian state practised a policy of mass expulsion and/or forced assimilation of non-Serb populations, thereby turning an ethnically heterogeneous region into a homogeneous Serb one.</p>
<p>Ref; For the power of this myth among Serb peasants-turned-soldiers during the Balkan Wars see the account given by Leon Trotsky in his Balkan Wars 1911-12, New York 1980.</p>

<hr />
<p>I find the information given on the page very corrupted. The Battle of Kosova/Kosovo is not an exclusive battle of Serbs against Ottoman Empire. There was a coalition formed among Balkans people. Christian nations such as Albanians, Serbs, Bulgarians and Romanians fought against the Turkish army in Kosova Field close to Prishtina (June 15, 1389). Leader of coalition troops was the Serb Lazar Hrebeljanovic, while he was supported by the Albanian noblemen Gjergj II Balsha, Teodor Muzaka, Gjon Kastrioti (skenderbeg s father) etc.</p>
<hr />
<p>It is said, in the article, that Ottomans outnumbered the Christian soldiers, but no numbers are mentioned. However, it was a battle between 100.000 Ottomans and 40.000 Balkanians. The numbers I have given are not fantastic, but real.</p>
<p>E.g. in the Battle of Albulena (Albania, 1457) 80.000 soldiers under the command of Isak Bey Evrenoz were defeated by the Albanian Kingdom forces.</p>
<p>The Byzantine chronicler Laonik Halkokondili wrote: “Murad I gathered his entire army, from Asia and Europe, 100.000 soldiers, and together with his son Mehmed II led his troops to Albania (May 1450)”. (First siege of Kruja).</p>
<p>Mehmed II had even a bigger army (150.000) in Kruja’s second siege.</p>
<hr />
<p>Meanwhile, Milos Obilic appears to be a Serb according to Wikipedia, but he was Albanian with the real name Millosh Kopili. Kopil/Kopili (definite/undefinite) means bastard in Albanian, but it is used to describe outstanding skills as well.</p>
<p>P.S. Don’t forget that the battle was carried through in Albanian land (Kosova).--<a href="../../../g/e/t/User%7EGetoar_7871.html" title="User:Getoar">Getoar</a> 22:57, 23 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yeah, Albanian land where Serbian capital and seat of the Serbian Orthodox Church were located, and which had 99% Serbian population.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The oldest sources mention Milos's name as "Kobilovic", which comes from Serbian "kobila" - mare. Even if it was Kopili, Kopile means bastard in Serbian as well, so it's irrelevant. <a href="../../../n/i/k/User%7ENikola_Smolenski_0d21.html" title="User:Nikola Smolenski">Nikola</a> 10:06, 24 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Mate, you have to understand that even Paris was one of the biggest German cities during the World War II. If the capital of Serbia was in Kosova (Prishtina or whatever) it doesn't mean that all the population was Slavic. Just remember of the Albanian catholic bishop Pjetër Bogdani who died in Prishtina. He was one of the greatest leaders on anti-Ottoman movements, in the time your Slavic ancestors were the best allies to the Turks. Thus, Albanians have always comprised a majority in Kosova up to Nis. Remember, 1877-1878 and the holocaust, when 160.000 Albanians were deported by force from their homes in the region of Nis, and forced to live in the central Kosova. There are people who still have the documents for the land legally owned and this will get you into trouble one day. God will punish those who want someone else’s bread.--<a href="../../../g/e/t/User%7EGetoar_7871.html" title="User:Getoar">Getoar</a> 13:44, 25 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Can you please tell me then, based on historical facts, how Kosovo with 99% Serbs became Kosova with 95% Albanians? --<a href="../../../g/e/t/User%7EGetoar_7871.html" title="User:Getoar">Getoar</a> 23:56, 26 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Since you know my answer, you may proceed straight do disaproving with it&#160;:) <a href="../../../n/i/k/User%7ENikola_Smolenski_0d21.html" title="User:Nikola Smolenski">Nikola</a> 08:24, 28 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>It has been known that Serbian historians often base the history on myths rather than facts.</p>
<dl>
<dd>It has been known that Albanian government in Kosovo creates school curriculum which describes Kosovo's history without any basis in reality and promotes hatred toward Serbs, which shows. <a href="../../../n/i/k/User%7ENikola_Smolenski_0d21.html" title="User:Nikola Smolenski">Nikola</a></dd>
</dl>
<p>Then, let me remind you that Slavs came to Balkans between 6th and 9th centuries. And this is away after Illyrians were known to be in Balkans. So, if we use facts rather than fiction, then historically Kosova was always populated by Albanians and not Slavs.</p>
<dl>
<dd>That is wrong, for several reasons. First, it is not so certain that Slavs came to Balkans then, nor that Albanians are Illyrians. However, even if we take these for granted, what you have written still doesn't follow. First, historical sources which assert that, also claim that the land was depopulated (for example <a href="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/De_Administrando_Imperio" class="extiw" title="wikisource:De_Administrando_Imperio">De Administrando Imperio</a>: <i>And since what is now Serbia and Pagania and the so-called country of the Zachlumi and Terbounia and the country of the Kanalites were under the dominion of the emperor of the Romans, and since these countries had been made desolate by the Avars (for they had expelled from those parts the Romani who now live in Dalmatia and Dyrrachium), therefore the emperor settled these same Serbs in these countries, and they were subject to the emperor of the Romans</i>). Second, even if the former is not true, it is not established that modern Kosovo Albanians are descendant of those Illyrians who lived in Kosovo. <a href="../../../n/i/k/User%7ENikola_Smolenski_0d21.html" title="User:Nikola Smolenski">Nikola</a></dd>
</dl>
<p>Slavic claims for an Albanian-Ottoman alliance, which deported the nonexistent Slavic population from Kosova,</p>
<dl>
<dd>Serbian population in Kosovo was very existent. One of the earliest remaining historical sources about it is Turkish <a href="../../../d/e/f/Defter.html" title="Defter">defter</a> (census) of 1455 which recorded 12,985 Serbian houses, 75 Vlach, 46 Albanian, 17 Bulgarian etc. in entire Kosovo. Modern analysis of the defter was done by Muslim researchers from Sarajevo Institute of Middle Eastern Studies. <a href="../../../n/i/k/User%7ENikola_Smolenski_0d21.html" title="User:Nikola Smolenski">Nikola</a></dd>
</dl>
<p>is nothing than a mistake made by Serbian politicians, not very keen on history. Serbians were proven to be strong allies to Ottomans, immediately after the Battle of Kosova,</p>
<dl>
<dd>That is not true. After the battle, Lazar's state entered became <a href="../../../v/a/s/Vassal.html" title="Vassal">vassal</a> to Turkey, which is opposite of ally, while other Serb states resisted. Specifically, Montenegro was never actually conquered by Turkey. <a href="../../../n/i/k/User%7ENikola_Smolenski_0d21.html" title="User:Nikola Smolenski">Nikola</a></dd>
</dl>
<p>while Albanians did fight even after their last castle fell (1479).</p>
<dl>
<dd>That is nice and true, but after converting to Islam Albanians did become a weapon in Turkish hands, just as after it they were weapon in Austrian, German, Italian and, now, NATO hands. Albanians are the last of Balkans peoples which formed a country for that very reason. <a href="../../../n/i/k/User%7ENikola_Smolenski_0d21.html" title="User:Nikola Smolenski">Nikola</a></dd>
</dl>
<p>Albanians did not object to the development of Serbian culture in Kosova. This is a similar case to Serbians living in Chicago and developing their culture (building Orthodox Churches). But, it doesn’t grant Serbian people the right to call America their land.--<a href="../../../g/e/t/User%7EGetoar_7871.html" title="User:Getoar">Getoar</a> 03:07, 30 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>No it isn't. While there are Serbian churches in Chicago, as expected, the largest modern Serbian church is <a href="../../../t/e/m/Temple_of_Saint_Sava_fb51.html" title="Temple of Saint Sava">Temple of Saint Sava</a> in Belgrade, the Serbian capital. In the same way, from the fact that the largest, beautiest and most important medieval Serbian churches were in Kosovo, we can tell that it was core of the Serbian state in middle ages. In addition, there are no Albanian churches in Kosovo. Furthermore, not only churches, but Serbian capital was in Kosovo; if it was not inhabited by Serbs, that would be a unique example in history of a country moving its capital from its core territory to a border territory to a territory settled with a foreign people. Imagine USA moving its capital from Washington to Bagdad or Germany from Berlin to Kiev, and you can imagine that Kosovo was Albanian-inhabited when capital of Serbia was moved to Prizren.</dd>

<p>As I understand the problem is wether the place where the battle was fought was inhabited with Servs or Albanians. Can´t we conclude that their is no clear consensus on that topic?

<p>Turkish sources state Murad I was assassinated by a Serb <b>after the battle</b> while wandering the battlefield, not during the battle. This article turns this event into an epic tale, "Miloš Obilić crushing the Ottoman line and assaulting Murad's tent", which raises doubts that it was written from a nationalist POV. Actually through the whole article I felt more Serbian POV than a NPOV, trying to glorify Serbian efforts and belittle Ottomans.

<dd>Turkish sources are considered incorrect because after the battle the sultan would have no reason to enable Milos to approach him, while during the battle he would, as Milos might have carried important information. <a href="../../../n/i/k/User%7ENikola_Smolenski_0d21.html" title="User:Nikola Smolenski">Nikola</a> 13:20, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Some authors infer assasination of sultan Murad during the battle based on (allegedly unusual if supreme commander was still alive) prince Bayazid's initiative in deciding when to launch his counterattack (the latter came from Turkish sources). To me, it is not so convincing but anyway, I agree this article is a little "thin". I hope someone who reads Serbian could make something out of this link: <a href="http://www.srpsko-nasledje.co.yu/sr-l/1998/11/article-6.html" class="external free" title="http://www.srpsko-nasledje.co.yu/sr-l/1998/11/article-6.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.srpsko-nasledje.co.yu/sr-l/1998/11/article-6.html</a> , it cites some Turkish chronitians of the time too. I have a problem finding original names of some historians of the time, (i.e. Mulla Mehmed Neshri, Ashik Pasha-Zade, Constantine the Yanissari) but several mentioned participants on Turkish side have Wikipedia articles themself (strateg <a href="../../../g/a/z/Gazi_Evrenos_Bey_7ce2.html" title="Gazi Evrenos Bey">Gazi Evrenos Bey</a>) while others are only mentioned (<a href="../../../l/a/l/Lala_Shahin_Pasha_a9d5.html" title="Lala Shahin Pasha">Lala Shahin Pasha</a>) in other cotexts.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Bottom line: It seems that Turks deliberatly let Serbian heavy cavalry thru the lines so that they would hit right into the Turkish supplies-made barrier behind them, and then, after Serb heavy armoured knights lost their momentum and therefore become relatively harmless, surrounded and flailed them down (somewhat similar to what <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scipio.html" title="Scipio">Scipio</a> did to <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hanibal.html" title="Hanibal">Hanibal</a>'s elephants in <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Zama_3fb1.html" title="Battle of Zama">Battle of Zama</a>). After that, Bayazid introduced fresh reserve that decided the outcome of the battle. Loose Lazar's coalition broke down, panic followed, Serbs and their allies were separated and flew in at least three directions. Lazar was allegedly captured and decapitated as well as nobles that immediately followed him.</p>
<p>'... a Janičar nam saopštava da je Bajazit pogubio Lazara i Krajmira, a posle kratkog vremena i sve one nevernike koji su se nagledali boja koji su ostali (su) kao izdajnici, s objašnjenjem: "Kad ste svome gospodaru bili tako neverni u njegovoj nevolji to isto biste i meni učinili". Ovo je nejasno. Mislim da se to odnosi na vlastelu koja se nije odazvala Lazarevu pozivu, dakle, koja nije učestvovala u bici. Ispalo bi da je kao suveren osvetio Lazara, kolegu-suverena. Setimo se da je kasnije Bajazit savetovao svome zetu Stefanu Lazareviću da svoju vlastelu drži čvrsto u ruci.' translation follows:</p>
<p>('... and (Constantine the) Yanissary tells us that Bayazid slained Lazar and Krajmir, then shortly afterwards also all the infidels who looked battle and left over like traitors, with an explanation: "Since you have been so unfaithful to your master in his need you would be same to me". That is vague. I think it concerned nobles who didn't turn up on Lazars call, hence, who didn't took part in the battle. It would turn out like a sovereign avenged Lazar, his collegue-souvereign. Let's recall that later Bayazid advised his own son-in-law <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stefan_Lazarevic_e32e.html" title="Stefan Lazarevic">Stefan Lazarevic</a> to keep firm grip on his (Stephan's) own nobles.')</p>
<p>Well, to me it seems like there is a part missing, like the nobles in fact betrayed and killed Lazar as an offer of allegience to Bayazid, but Bayazid choose instead to embrace Lazar (or at least his heir) as more worthy ally. But, I am inclined to see conspiracies everywhere (death of Murad I is also very unlikely and suspiciously described in your reference, Kagan,... considering how convenient it was for Bayazid who was not rightful heir and subsequent dynastic war, but I would nevertheless like to see what you can find on this battle from Turkish sources) and Wikipedia expressly forbids "original research".</p>

<dd>As for Murad I's assassination, as I said Turkish history books suggest he was assassinated by a wounded Serbian soldier, while he was inspecting the battlefield after the battle. But I can e-mail some Turkish historians about this if you want, and if they reply, I get back to you.
<dl>
<dd>I have found some of that (and it's in english, too!) here: <a href="http://www.deremilitari.org/resources/articles/emmert.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.deremilitari.org/resources/articles/emmert.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.deremilitari.org/resources/articles/emmert.htm</a> There I found It seems that Neshri (who wrote about it in early 16th century) actually does confirm nobleman Milosh Kobila (Obilic) as assasin (apparently wounded Serbian warrior, who finged that he wants to kiss the foot of Sultan (which he allowed, comanding his guards to let the Serb) only to approach close, but then stabbed him), only not during the battle, but during the break, or after. However, this may be echo of a myth that was by that time well rooted among Serbs and westerners for almost a century and Neshri quite nicely assigned a higher meaning to the whole story (In Neshri's text, the Serbs' are already vassals, rebeling and due to be righteously punished and their army is at least twice or three times outnumbering the Ottoman army. Murad in his prayer to God offers his own life in exchange for miraculous victory. After the victory he is restless and wondering why he is still alive, but then it is all resolved, he dies a martyr by a hand of perfiduous assasin and his soul is given entrance to heaven), so since this detail has alegoric purpose of its own, it doesn't really have to be factual.</dd>

<dd>Also Battle of Kosova has an important part in Turkish mythology as well since most Turks believe Turkish flag was inspired by this battle; it cost the lives of many and Beyazıd was inspired to use the moon and stars' reflection on the battlefield of pool of blood as the state flag, that is also modern Turkish flag.--<a href="../../../a/d/k/User%7EAdkagansu_ab98.html" title="User:Adkagansu">Kagan the Barbarian</a> 22:49, 14 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, respect to you... I always considered this battle as significant only for us, major losers. It is central to our national identity which is why all this modern-day history concerning Kosovo is so heated (to put it mildly) and why it is more significant to us then earlier (also lost) teritories which were cradle of Serbian state and nation. If we would have to be forced to forget about Kosovo, we would lost a lot of elementary school history and literature curriculum.

<dd>I believe this article is written by a serbian nationalist who is apparently 'not neutral'. When I read it for the first time, it was like as if I reading a battle telling how Serbs defeated Ottomans. I think this will misdirect people and it should be edited.

<li>You are partly right in your claim. For example, look at this sentence, <i>Interestingly, when Bayezid I attacked the forces of Timur at the Battle of Ankara, the Ottoman army consisted mainly of Serbians, since most of the Turks chose Timur's side</i>. This part is wrong. Yes, Timur was a popular and powerful leader during his reign but this doesn't mean that Turkish troops didn't support Sultan Bayezid I. The reality was different. Some Turkish troops betrayed Bayezid I during the war. This doesn't mean that Bayezid I's army was gathered from foreigners.

<dd><i>Interestingly, when Bayezid I attacked the forces of Timur at the Battle of Ankara, the Ottoman army consisted mainly of Serbians, since most of the Turks chose Timur's side</i> This sentence is not important in this context because we talk about Battle of Kosovo, not Bayezid. The thing is that the last paragraph "The Ottomans in a counter attack pushed Serbian forces back. By late afternoon both armies were exhausted, with <b>neither of them being able to gain significant strategic advantage</b>. Lazar was taken prisoner and executed; the Serbs were forced to pay tribute to the Turks and promised to do military service in the Sultan's army." looks so wierd! if neither of them was able to gain significant strategic advantage, how come Lazar was taken prisoner and executed; the Serbs were forced to pay tribute to the Turks and promised to do military service! come on! all we need is the truth, not nationalism.

<p>Or its vandalism, it was eventual victory, in the aftermath there was too much confusion and way too many soldiers killed, dont forget Murat was killed so was Lazar, there was no clear victory in the beginning. Later, when turkish army moved in, they finished the job, but that was over all of Kosovo, not the battle alone, so the current version is ok and valid. Besides you are from turkey and you (possibly) want to look victorious, in fact, you are not.</p>
<p>Let's not forget that quite a few Croats fought (and died) alongside their Serbian brothers-in-arms! <a href="../../../m/i/h/User%7EMihovil_1a43.html" title="User:Mihovil">Mihovil</a> 01:51, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I guess you are the one who does the vandalism by changing the historical facts! you can look into any reputable history source (or other encyclopedia) and you will see that the battle was an Ottoman victory, either you like it or not. I can understand you, being a nationalist you don't wanna see the truth (we have nationalists here as well, claiming some defeats as victory and we laugh at them). However, wiki belongs to all humans in this world and shouldn't include imaginary comments. I wonder how you can talk about a draw, as 'sultan took Lazar's daughter, the Serbian princess Olivera Despina, as a wife. The Serbs were forced to pay tribute to the Turks and promised to do military service in the Sultan's army.' this is just funny, nothing but funny.. another point is that the Result section looks ugly, it is composed of 6 lines. check other battle results, mostly 2 words, not even 2 lines. this is because you want to enforce something unreal in that section and it simply doesn't fit there. the outcome should be short: defeat, draw, victory. that's all. any explanations can be made in the body. I really wonder if there is anybody in charge of this page; it needs attention.</p>
<p>'on Kosovo Polje (Kosovo Field) in 1389, where the vassal troops commanded by Prince Lazar — the strongest regional ruler in Serbia at the time —killed Turkish Sultan Murat but <b>suffered a defeat</b>, due to the legendary "sudden departure" of Brankovic's Serbian troops' <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Serbia" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Serbia" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Serbia</a> (just for the record)</p>

<p>You are putting your point of view which makes no sense, yea it was victory for the turks, but not at that time dude, in the long run, so do not touch this, it will remain like this, you can not claim victory over this, period. This was a draw, but it can not be called a draw because the turks did take kosovo later on, so when it says considered a draw, means that was a draw for that time. Now, whatever it says on wiki site suffered a defeat, this was lost in history, Kosovo in the long run lost to turks, let's be clear about this, but not this particular battle.</p>
<p>Hi, could I suggest you have a look at <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>.

<p>allright, finally you wrote dude:) last time I change the result to get a reply. The thing is that in the long run we are ok. However, in short term (at the very moment of the battle) I claim an ottoman victory. Even it is written in wiki's History of Serbia page. For the long term, they use the word 'turkish conquest' not victory or whatsoever. for short term it is written as 'Lazar suffered a defeat on kosovo polje'. Moreover, it seems the Britannica also claims as an ottoman victory. We are not historian but I believe Britannica must have done enough research to wrote such an article, am I wrong? I guess you take the first few hours of the battle and ignore the rest. However, the battle is not over until both sides stop fighting which seems although Lazar made a good start, it seems Bayezid managed to prevailed later. there are lots of battles in history (by the way I take history as a great hobbie, I love reading esp. roman, greek and medieval europe) which started as a victory for one side and ended as a defeat however. by the way, please stop adding those comments to the result section. it really looks ugly. if you think it is a draw, just write draw.. I don't wanna touch it anymore. soo what do you think? You are right Addhoc, we can do that actually <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>.</p>
<p>It is at least a draw, but it is complicated because of long passage of time, so many were killed and turks did not make immediate progress, only in the years to come, so yea, kosovo polje was not defeat, but it was the star as the defeat of kosovo in the years to come, simple as that, but sad for the people of the times.</p>
<ul>
<li>allright then, the thing is that ottomans didn't proceed right after the battle since Bayezid had to go to the capital and proclaim himself as the new sultan. By the way, do you know when Serbs accepted to pay tribute and send soldier? is it right after the fight? because in case of a draw no tribute should be paid. moreover, we can do voting if you like.</li>

<p>Think about it users... ok... so many articles and sources that we find on the internet were once original research, somebody wrote it, others agreed and became popular, these are golden words, original research, proven, is sometimes best there is especially in the light on a subject that is little known or information comes from one dubious and subjective source a source that has something against a particular topic or individual or even history as a whole, the golden rule are my words...</p>
<p>History could be wrong many times, i do not know, i only passed by serbia, but many people outside of balkans agree with me it was draw, remember what pharaohs of the ancient egypt did and it worked for 1000's of years, they changed history and erased the names of certain pharaohs they did not like and with them all their work and achievements and many were good.</p>
<ul>
<li>well, also nazis, soviets changed the history. They thought they could distort the truth. However, such regimes didn't live long, guess why:) That's why I believe we should refer to some neutral sources which are reputable as well. Kosovo Polje is a studied matter and I believe we can reach a consensus. What I see is that serious publications(some encyclopedia, historians like Noel Malcolm) consider it as a victory not draw.</li>

<p>As far as I'm aware, the result of the battle is commonly considered a draw. I've read numerous Western accounts of a draw, which they contrast with the "Serb nationalist" "myth of defeat". Serbia's power was largely exhausted, however, while the Ottomans had huge manpower reserves they could call upon. Even so, the rest of Serbia held out for 70 years after this battle - hardly indicating an Ottoman victory at this battle. --<a href="../../../e/s/t/User%7EEstavisti_9746.html" title="User:Estavisti">estavisti</a> 17:03, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I consider that calling the army led by prince Lazar "a Christian coalition force "or “Balkan army” is incorrect and pointless.</p>
<p>Why? First of all, I must stress that the army of prince Lazar surely did incorporate soldiers of other nations but Serbs, notably his ally in previous wars - Ivaniš Paližna from Hungarian Croatia and (but only MAYBE since we have no record of it) some of other Lazar's allies and relatives (his five daughters were married to neighboring princes). However, these were surely not Djuradj II Balšić (in Albanian Gyergy Balsha) a noble from Serbian Maritime or Gyergy Kastriot - this is a fact. The main problem is that in years previously to the battle Turks conquered large tracts of Balkans and secured subjection of many local lords so that not many nobles could be found to enter the war against the army led by Sultan himself. Losing such a battle would mean losing life (or at least rule). On the other hand, taking a part in the battle with significant forces would mean mustering almost all of scarce knights and sending them away from home, leaving the back vulnerable to the attacks of neighbors - which was a constant problem with divided Christian forces in those times. Therefore all those not directly endangered by the Turks and not feeling strong enough just promised not to attack those who took part in the battle. For what we know, army led by prince Lazar lined in a manner usual in these days: three sections, each one led by the noble who brought the troops - another of problems with Christian strategy against Turkish forces. The center was led by Lazar himself. One wing was commanded by Vuk Branković, Lazar's son-in-law and the ruler in whose domain the Field of Kosovo lay, and the other by Vlatko Vuković a noble of King Tvrtko of Bosnia. However, not even Bosnians were a foreign factor since in 1377 Tvrtko, a relative of the Nemanjić dynasty, was crowned king of Serbs on the tomb of St Sava in the monastery of Mileševa. Moreover, Vlatko Vuković was a noble governing the part of Bosnia called Hum which passed from Serbian to Bosnian hands only 50 years ago. Mind you that apart from living in two separate states Serbia proper and Bosnia were both inhabited mostly with Serbs. And why was it that only Vuk and king Tvrtko sent forces in battle against the Turks? Primarily since they were the most endangered: Vuk was the southernmost Serbian noble that did not subject to the Sultan while both Lazar and Tvrtko felt the Turkish atacks in previous years (smaller battles against Turks at Pločnik, Toplica and Bileća - the last one won by Vlatko Vuković). Additionally, Tvrtko - as the king of Serbs - was eager to be recognized as the leading amongst the Serb lords and therefore had the obligation to intervene. Therefore, although at the battle site there were probably present some lesser nobles from Hungary or of Albanian origin they were to small to be recorded. On the other hand, let's not forget that a significant portion of Turkish forces was made of Serbian, Greek and Albanian lords from Macedonia, Epirus and Thessaly who earlier recognized Sultan's sovereignty and many other auxiliary forces from across the Balkans and Asia Minor! And still we don't call the Ottoman army "a coalition of Turkish-Serbian-Bulgarian or whatever forces"!</p>
<p>And, as my last point, imagine calling each of the armies from throughout history by all the contingents that it was made of! Then the French army at Agincourt would be something like French-Genovese-Provencal and the English army would be English-Welsh-French! And what would then be French army at Borodino?!? This are the first examples that came to my mind but almost all of the larger battles in history were fought by forces to some degree made of different nationalities. So, although the people that faced Turkish forces were Christian, there is no point in calling them by so wide-ranging name. No one would say that a Christian coalition fought the Gulf War or that Napoleon in 1812 led a Roman-catholic coalition against the Orthodox or whatever.</p>
<p>For all of these reasons it is a nonsense calling the army led by prince Lazar by name other than "Serbs" (as opposed to "the Turks"), "Serbian forces" or "a coalition of Serb lords" at furthest. If no one opposes it (after reading this, of course), I propose the changing of this "a Christian coalition force" thing.</p>
<p>One more thing: there was no Serbian empire at the time. The last emperor died in 1371, which is why all the chaos erupted. I changed this immediately. --Dultz 11:53, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
<b>Dultz</b>, you did the right thing above. Do you have any comments regarding how the size and composition of the forces should be described (se below)? While I agree that it makes sense to describe the forces as Serbian and Turkish (or, maybe more correctly, Ottoman) it might still be worthwhile to comment on the composition of the forces. Especially since this is an issue of some contention.</p>
<p>Most seem to agree that the Serbian side also included 'Bosnian' forces. Some also argue that it also included Hungarian forces, while others oppose this. I have also seen comments that the Serbian side included Albanian forces, though not found any references for this. Is it possible that at the time people were not as concerned with the ethnicity (even less nationality) of soldiers&#160;:-)? <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarlXII_267e.html" title="User:KarlXII">KarlXII</a> 10:10, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Thanks, Karl. Regarding the size of the forces a serious study that I read long ago and Yugoslav Military Encicilopaedia that has a good article on it put the forces as following:</p>
<p><b>Ottomans 40,000</b> of these 5,000 janissary, 2,500 cavalry life guards, 6,000 sipahis, 20,000 azaps and akinci (lightly armed infantry and cavalry respectfully) and 8,000 of his vassals.</p>
<p><b>Serbs 25,000</b> (top estimate) of these 15,000 led by prince Lazar, 5,000 of Vuk Brankovic and 5,000 by Vlatko Vukovic</p>
<p>The compostion of the forces I addressed above - there could have been some smaller contingents from other regions but these were too small to be mentioned by the sources. The only one mentioned is Ivan Palizna but since he was a refuge in Bosnia escaping from Hungarian king he could not muster more than a few hunrded at most, more probably less than 100 men. --Dultz 01:19, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>And one more thing: fantastic numbers and exotic compostion of troops taking part in the battle stem from (1) the importance that the battle later gained as a focal point in Serb epic and (2) from the battle fought on the same grounds in 1448. The numbers given above were made on estimates of population and the extent of territory as well as on paralels to the other battles of the period which rarely involved more then 10,000 on each side, so that, in comparisment with them, the Kosovo battle realy was huge in its day.--Dultz 01:26, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have a very reliable source that indicate sthat infact, the Turks numbered only 30,000 against a 'Serbian force' of 20,000. Moreover, the Ottomans only won when the vast majority of the Serbs defected. This would explain the 'none survivors' fact. Also, no foolish Sultan would let a deserter enter his tent without being searched and properly guarded. He was in fact, killed in the confusion of battle, when many of the desserting Serbs could have been mistaken as allies. And further more, the Serbs remained an ally / puppet state of the Ottoman empire.</p>

<p><b>First</b>, it might be worthwhile to add that some Turkish sources apparently give the date of the battle as 4 Ramadan 791 (27 August 1389), although it should be made clear that this is not the generally accepted date.</p>
<p><b>Second</b>, the composition of the forces. The article simply states that it was Serbians vs Ottomans. From what I understand, it was not so clear cut. The Serbian side was a coalition of Balkan groups under Serbian leadership while the Ottoman forces, in addition to Ottoamans and Turkmen princes of Anatolia also included some Serb rivals of Lazar as well as Bulgarians forces under Mircea the Great of Wallachia and George Castriots, an Albanian prince. Some have also suggested that people like Marko Kraljevich of Prilep also fought on the Ottoman side. Wouldn't it be worthwhile to add this type of information to the article? Coalitions in the middle ages were not as clean cut as many 19th century historians would like to think.</p>
<p><b>Third</b>, as for the size and relative strenghts of the forces, Serbian folklore does indeed say that the 'Serbian' forces were outnumbered. However, for what it's worth, according to Prof. Stanford J. Shaw (Prof. of Modern Turkish History at UCLA and Bilkent Uni. in Ankara, Turkey) the relative strenght (in no. of men) was the opposite, with the Ottoman forces consisting of 60,000 and the Serbian coaltion of some 100,000. I don't know how well researched his sources are (also, although he is American, he is a prof. of Turkish history in Turkey, and so might have an agenda, I don't know), but it might be worthwhile to investigate or even mention in the article. What do you think?</p>
<p><b>Finally</b>, the article doesn't give any political/military background infro. I would be willing to add this.</p>
<p>So, to summarize:</p>
<p>1. Need to mention any other possible dates for the battle? 2. More nuanced description of the (possible) composition of the two forces? 3. How sure are we about the relative sizes of the forces? 4. Need to add any background info?</p>

<dd>1. I think not. If anything is clear about the battle, it's the date.</dd>
<dd>2. and 3. I am quoting this from Vojna enciklopedija, which is the authoritative military encyclopedia for the former Yugoslavia:
<dl>
<dd>On Kosovo Murad could take around 40,000, of which around 5,000 Yanichars, 2,500 his cavalry guard, 6,000 spahias, around 20,000 azaps and akindzis and 8,000 his vassals. Lazar could gather at most 25,000, of which 15,000 of his men, 5,000 of Vuk's men, and as much of Bosnians. The data about the strengths are approximate, more likely higher than lower[...]</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Yes, both armies included <i>some</i> non-national troops. No, the bulk of the force was clearly Turkish/Serbian.</dd>
<dd>4. Certainly. I always wanted to add that, but never found the time. For example, Vojna enciklopedija gives quite compelling overview of pre-battle movement of forces and reason why the battle had to take place on Kosovo. <a href="../../../n/i/k/User%7ENikola_Smolenski_0d21.html" title="User:Nikola Smolenski">Nikola</a> 00:16, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<b>Nikola</b>, Thanks for your reply. My comments as follows:</p>
<dl>
<dd>1. I'm ok with not mentioning any other dates.</dd>
<dd>2 &amp; 3. The figures you provide certainly are more detailed than any other I have found. Since there appears to be quite a bit of speculation about the size and composition of the forces (especially on the Serbian side) it might be worthwhile to include some discussion of this in the text. I don't know anything about the Vojna enciklopedija, but claiming that it should have precendence over all other sources (while not being able to provide online or English language links or references to it) is not satisfying to me.
<dl>
<dd>Vojna enciklopedija was created by the <a href="../../../y/u/g/Yugoslav_National_Army_651b.html" title="Yugoslav National Army">Yugoslav National Army</a>. It is by far the most autoritative military encyclopedia in the former Yugoslavia. No other work approaches it in size (11 volumes) or quality (written mostly by senior officers of the YNA). Given that it is published on paper and still under copyright, it is no wonder that it is not online. Given that it is in Serbo-Croatian, it is no wonder that there are few English references to it.</dd>
<dd>Of course, it is ideologically painted, but it could be used having that in mind. Estimates given by it fit into estimates given by other references, so I don't see a problem there. <a href="../../../n/i/k/User%7ENikola_Smolenski_0d21.html" title="User:Nikola Smolenski">Nikola</a> 13:38, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>4. Good. In that case I think we should work to add a background to the battle (and maybe a more detailed 'Aftermath' section as well.</dd>

<p><b>Nikola</b> (and anyone else who is interested, of course), In light of the discussion above should the intro of the article really read:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"The battle started with Serbian noblemen and Lazar's son-in-law, noble Vuk Branković, on one wing, Lazar with heavy armor knight cavalary in the centre including German mercenaries, and Bosnian Duke Vlatko Vuković commanding the third wing of the Bosnian Serb army including Albanian (Gjergj II Balsha, Theodor II Muzaka), Hungarian, Polish knights and Knights Hospitallers."</dd>

<p>Also, this text is not sourced, referenced or discussion in any way when there appears to be quite some uncertainty about this issue.<a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarlXII_267e.html" title="User:KarlXII">KarlXII</a> 10:18, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Unfortunately, it doesn't detail exactly what we need. It could be used for various parts of the article, but doesn't mention army composition. Regarding Albanian, Hungarian, Polish etc. knights, I never heard of them nor does Vojna enciklopedija mentions them at all (there were a few Croatian however). <a href="../../../n/i/k/User%7ENikola_Smolenski_0d21.html" title="User:Nikola Smolenski">Nikola</a> 09:51, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I also feel that the external link <a href="http://www.srpska-mreza.com/library/facts/kosovo-battle.html" class="external text" title="http://www.srpska-mreza.com/library/facts/kosovo-battle.html" rel="nofollow">The Kosovo Battle, <i>Excerpts from various Encyclopædiæ</i></a> seems more like an entry into a political discussion about who was the victor of the battle than a valuable external source (some of the quoted encyclopedias are rather outdated and can't be seen as representative of current academic knowledge). If it is to be retained in the list, is would be as an example of previous beliefs on the topic.

<p>That's why I find the inclusion of this link questionable other than as a historical record of what older encyclopedias said on the subject.

<p>Yes, and they contain little information that is right. But they support another point of view (Ottoman victory) and add something to this article, which is too one sided. Personaly, i think that any serious article should cite the main sources instead of external links. If this article becomes more balanced with time, we can delete all the links. <a href="../../../l/y/s/User%7ELysandros_4459.html" title="User:Lysandros">Lysandros</a> 16:08, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Lysandros</b>, I don't agree but in a way you are right.</p>
<p>On one hand, most of these encyclopedias simply regurgitate the conventional wisdom, with seemingly littly effort put into trying to establish what the current view of academia is - thay take the easy route by simply updating what the previous version had. So, while their view may or may not be outdated, this really shouldn't matter in Wikipedia, since Wikipedia isn't about original research but about presenting the commonly held view (even it may be wrong, one could say). Thus, I think it best to say that there is no concensus as to the outome of the battle.</p>
<p>On the other hand, however, that still doesn't mean that the <i>External links</i> should be filled with 'useless' links with no text. Instead, they should provide more indepth material.<a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarlXII_267e.html" title="User:KarlXII">KarlXII</a> 22:44, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hi Karl, those links were added by me. If you check previous links, you can see that almost all of them were from some Serbian web sites and non-neutral as a result. Therefore I put those links from other Encyclopedia since they are neutral and have a higher reputation than other sources. I think we should keep at least Britannica and Columbia Encyclopedia. Tough they are short, they provide a good summary.<a href="../../../a/t/i/User%7EAti7_80aa.html" title="User:Ati7">Ati7</a> 07:41, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd><b>Ati7</b>, thank's for your reply.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I'm all for keeping Balkan sites neutral and free from the national POVs that so often seem to infiltrate them (my recent experience at the <a href="../../../s/r/e/Srebrenica_massacre.html" title="Srebrenica massacre">Srebrenica massacre</a> article is a good example of these types of problems). Apparently the issue of the outcome of the battle has some type of ideological overtone which I'm proposing to overcome in the article by stating that the outcome is disputed and then listing the various positions. The External links shouldn't act as a covert continuation of the "who won" debate. I am alright with keeping the EB and Columbia if we get rid of the others.</dd>

<dd>There's actually little debate about who won. Technically, it was a draw because both armies retreated and both commanders were killed.

<b>Nikola</b>, fine, my only comment was that the who-won discussion should not be allowed to affect the External links.

<p>I've understood that there is a bit of a controversy (at least Wikipedia) about who won the battle and from reading articles such as Emmert's article in the External lins. He writes:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"<i>The historian is faced with a difficult problem when he attempts to discover what occurred in the Battle of Kosovo. There are no eyewitness accounts of the battle, and rather significant differences exist among those contemporary sources which do mention the event... <b>Surprisingly enough, it is not even possible to know with certainty from the extant contemporary material whether one or the other side was victorious on the field</b>. There is certainly little to indicate that it was a great Serbian defeat; and the earliest reports of the conflict suggest, on the contrary, that the Christian forces had won</i>."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>He goes on to list what some other historians/experts believe:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"<i><b>Radojicic</b> believed so three decades ago and argued that the earliest texts clearly suggest a Serbian victory.[35] <b>Djordje Trifunovic</b>, on the other hand, argues that the attribute "shining" or "glorious" with which the author describes Lazar's victory is an obvious reference to the spiritual character of that victory.[36] Certainly many of the cult references to victory are expressions of Christian martyrdom. But in the <b>Prolosko zitije kneza Lazara</b> cited above and in other eulogistic works it would appear that the author addresses two kinds of victory. Lazar defeats Murad and wins a victory before he himself is killed. His death secures for him the martyr's wreath, which is a personal reward for his sacrifice. The wreath symbolizes the ultimate victory-eternal life. <b>Patriarch Danilo III</b>, on the other hand, in his Slovo o knezu Lazaru appears to make no conclusion as to the final outcome of the battle</i>"</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>As Wikipedia articles are not supposed to reflect original thought but what other sources say, it might be worthwhile to collect different arguments for/against, and summarize and reference them in a separate chapter (as I said earlier, I have no preference one way or another). How about that?<a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarlXII_267e.html" title="User:KarlXII">KarlXII</a> 18:56, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Emmert, who seems to favor the notion that at least the battle was not a defeat for the Serbs it is generally know as, continues to say that:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"<i>It is only in 1512 that a highly detailed description of the Battle of Kosovo appeared among the Turks. This account by <b>Mehmed Nesri</b>, however, would become the major resource for subsequent descriptions of the battle, not only in the Ottoman world but in Western Europe as well. Nesri has been described as a doctrinaire writer whose primary purpose in his writing was to arouse his readers' religious fervor and military virtue.[55] He clearly intended to describe a significant Ottoman victory at Kosovo and thus exaggerated much of his narrative in order to magnify the success of the Turks. By eliminating most of the colorful embellishment, we can easily summarize its content</i>"</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Emmert concludes by writing:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"<i>Certainly the later sources, especially Nesri, describe a stunning Serbian defeat. As we have seen, however, that most crucial element in our understanding of the Battle of Kosovo cannot be supported by the handful of extant contemporary sources. And certainly the legacy of the seventy years which separate the battle from the final collapse of Serbia in 1459 confirms that the Battle of Kosovo was far more important in legend than it was in reality</i>"</dd>

<dd>I agree that there could well be a separate section about the views on the battle's outcome, or perhaps a subsection of the "Aftermath" section.

<p>Hi, I'm new to this article and hope to make a contribution. One thing which strikes me when reading the article is that it is absolutely littered with references to the Vojna Encyklopedia (hope I got the spelling right). I have a couple of comments on this:</p>
<ul>
<li>it feel like an exaggeration to referene every other sentence to the same work when one ref at the end of the paragraph would suffice</li>
<li>since most readers will not speak Serbo-Croatian and will not have access to the Vojna Encyklopedia (eg it is not available at Amazon, and is probably out of print) it would make a lot of sense to find a more up to date (the VE is from 1972) source in English. Prefereably one that is online.</li>
<li>as the article already refers to a couple of very well written texts which include most of the info which is currently referenced to the VE I suggest using these instead. I am thinking especially of the two articles by Thomas Emmert.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERoncevaux_0f5e.html" title="User:Roncevaux">Roncevaux</a> 10:06, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>OK. I would then suggest to move the reference to the end of paragraph, and to replace it with &lt;!-- comments --&gt; in the paragraph where the references currently are.</li>
<li>I couldn't find any book about the Battle of Kosovo (save the collection of poems) in the Library of Congress' or the British Library's online catalogs. So we're stuck with Serbo-Croatian.</li>
<li>IIRC, Emmert's articles deal more with depictions of the battle in culture than with the battle itself. But, perhaps this could be done: if Emmert's articles support an assertion already referenced by Vojna Enciklopedija, we could add it as a reference; and if it doesn't, we could discuss it here. <a href="../../../n/i/k/User%7ENikola_Smolenski_0d21.html" title="User:Nikola Smolenski">Nikola</a> 21:48, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Start; "The battle started with Turkish archers shooting at Serbian cavalry which then moved into attack. They managed to break through Turkish left wing, but weren't as successful against center and right wing. Even the left wing wasn't as defeated as it was simply pushed back."</p>
<p>Turkish counterattack; "The Balkans coalition initially gained advantage after their first charge, which heavily damaged the Turkish wing commanded by Jakub Celebi. In the center, the Christian fighters managed to push Ottoman forces back with only Bayezid's wing holding off the forces commanded by <a href="../../../v/l/a/Vlatko_Vukovi%C4%87_01a5.html" title="Vlatko Vuković">Vlatko Vuković</a>."</p>

The only sentence who speaks of a 'Turkish counterattack' is "The Ottomans in a counter attack pushed Balkans forces back and prevailed later in the day." and this is not sufficient. <a href="../../../l/y/s/User%7ELysandros_4459.html" title="User:Lysandros">Lysandros</a> 07:32, 25 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've changed the result to "Ottoman victory" based on Britannica, which treats the battle as an overwhelming Turkish triumph.<a href="../../../u/b/e/User%7EUberCryxic_9903.html" title="User:UberCryxic">UberCryxic</a> 19:30, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hi UberCryxic, I also think it was an Ottoman victory however, we couldn't reach a consensus about that. that's why we left it as Draw. Those encyclopedia links are added by me to support this idea. On the other hand, some other historians view this as a controversial battle since reliable sources are very scarce(please see other links). we may write Indecisive instead of Draw. However the outcome was very costly to Serbia therefore it is not really indecisive.. any other suggestions? <a href="../../../a/t/i/User%7EAti7_80aa.html" title="User:Ati7">Ati7</a> 09:43, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sociologically, Serbian nationalism and historiography has had a lot to say about this battle, but almost none of it has been relevant. Most relevant, reliable, and non-Turkish, non-Serbian sources regard this battle as a Turkish victory, so I propose we defer to them in light of the (obvious) conceptual conflicts between the two involved sides.<a href="../../../u/b/e/User%7EUberCryxic_9903.html" title="User:UberCryxic">UberCryxic</a> 21:33, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Nothing to do with nationalism, both people lost lots of men, I was born here, but I am also a little bit croatian, i know the history and this should be more or less a draw. <a name="result_2" id="result_2"></a></p>

<p>Guys, I am aware that many people wanna see the result as Ottoman victory, however a victory is a victory if and only if both sides come to that conclusion. nobody objects our victory of the second battle of kosovo or battle of manzikert. however, in case of this one, different views are present. The wikipedia is a platform to share thoughts and come to consensus, it's not a battlefield:) <a href="../../../a/t/i/User%7EAti7_80aa.html" title="User:Ati7">Ati7</a> 09:09, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Note, serbia lost in kosovo battle II, this one was draw, goodness, how many times to explain this, ottomans took kosovo in the long run, duh, i am talking about one battle here! Battle of Kosovo was not lost by the Serbs. It was kind of a draw were both armies were massacred and both Kings/Prince dead. Being much larger Ottoman Empire easily reorganised an by the time took all of Kosovo and eventually Serbia, Monte Negro took centuries to go down. You are also right that there were other countries involved by sending a military help to a Serbian army (Croatia, Bosnia, Hugary) but that was under Serbian command directly and insignificant to an entire Serbian army that was involved. Difference between Montenegro and Serbia is that Montenegro was the only Serbian land that Turks couldn't fully occupy in five century of their Balkan domination. Many things on wikipedia are wrong so often. Kimberley Golubovic, Edinburgh</p>

<p>Based on many of the Turkish historical records, it is believed that the Sultan was killed by Miloš Obilić who was pretending to be dead, while the Sultan was walking in the battlefield after the battle. On the other hand, in one account in Serbian records he was assassinated by Miloš Obilić, who made his way into the Turkish camp on the pretext of being a deserter and knelt before the Sultan. He stabbed him in the stomach while kneeling before him.</p>
<p>In all Kosovo field in cirkel of 8km it was only on Kulla, an this Kulla hawe belongt to Milosh Kopili (serb. Milos Obilic). The region of (today it was neural place wor both armys, dont forget it was a beatel called from Sulltan, no body is stupied to call a battel inseid a anamy territory, even Bush dont wount the beathel in Irak, but in Afganistan) Kosovo Hi hase came in the Saray of Sulltan to help him as vasal (the east arm is knowit in history as muslim, it was rulet from muslims and ther was not only muslims, Millosh it was one of them). During all the time the turck has maked sucses, eery thing els is onl serbian propagander. But Milosh has kiled sulltan with jatagan. The west sayd (knowied in history as chritia sied) was thingin after the Sulltan is death they have wonte the beatel. The members of the Sulltans kabinet hase killed one son of the Sulltan and one of the sonse was deklareted as Sulltan.

<p>For Ottomans army this was like a air for the peopel. Simpel joop. Tvrtkos vojvoda has taked his army a way, every army witch was came for help was a way. In thate time nationalty it was not discoveried. For the peopel natonalty it was his King or Church. The peopel who belewes more to Church today are called Serbs, the peopel who respect more the tradition and the King today are Montenegrin and Albanians.</p>
<p><i>Vuk Branković, Lazar's son-in-law, controlled Kopaonik mountain, Kosovo Polje and lands toward south, including his capital Prizren and together with Andrijaš Mrnjavčević the dangerously exposed sailent of Skopje with Skopska Crna Gora mountain;</i> he was forced to withdraw from Priština, under the Ottoman treat, who occupied the mountains east of Priština<i>,</i></p>
<p>Betwen Prishtina and Kosovo Field is no plans and centrum of Prishtina is not more thane 8 Km from Kosovo Field. When a army like the ottomans in thate time take a plane over east side then you have taket Kosovo Polje but not Prishtina.</p>
<p>When you wount to make a propagander about the baettel go down there, look how it looks, wher are this "east Prishtina plans" and talk with the peopel, liesend some folks music from both sides serbian and albanian they sing the same lied in differend langueges.</p>
<p>Lazar and soe zadruga vojvoda was thinking thate they are going in Ottoman Banket and have taked many singers with thay too watch the Beatel and sing about the "hero", Lazar ect...</p>
<p>It is Vuk and not Buk, if today is Vuk than in thate time must bee BUK (Bizant- Vizant, Servia - Serbia} somthing is not clear, Lazar is bay both, albanians and serbs ho demed knows what the hell he was serb or albanian or perheps Vllah (alb. brothers). Dont tale her pallavra.</p>

<dd>Perhaps you dont know that is Ulkiana (lat/gri Ulpiana old centrum of Justian) and Vuk hase somthink together. To finde out go and learn Albanian langueg.</dd>

<p>If you mean he belong to servian church then he was byzantin and not a serb. And stop maken serbian nation a same with Serbian Church. We are in year 2007 not in darknis from miedel age. Balsha was member of the Serbian Church (as part of Byzantin Church) but he was albanian.</p>
<p>The first vasals of the Sulltans in Balkan are the members of the population from wher today is commen bom-bom for the christianity, not from Montenegro, not from Albania. In north albania and south montenegro is a same democraty like in Hommer time (see Molosen, Epir, Dardanen, Taulanten ect). They diden wountit to cooperet with Sulltan and they have pay about thate, they hase lose they citys for more thane 500 years, but not there spirit they was free from turkish cultur, Belgrade was not, it was Malsia, Calabria (italien). The paps was from this area not from Belgrade, they was maken bisnis with Sulltan. (See: <a href="../../../s/k/a/Skanderbeg.html#After_death" title="Skanderbeg">Skanderbeg</a> during this time Belgrade was dealing with Sulltan, later the Serbian Church came independent from Costatinopol and wth help of the Rusian Church they have taked the Church of Manastir (near Ohrid), Knin (Croatien, it was under Rumun Church))</p>
<p>Today they the members of the Serbian Church dont know to witch nationalty they belong, to witch folk . How himself Vuk Stefan Karagjiq, (Black-vitch from turkish-serbitch) the serbian writter tale as "grcki zakon" (the grece rit also east church) he dont talk about "serbian zakon".</p>
<p>Stop laing the peopel, and let they disede what they are they have a colektiv memory, dont trai to redirect thate with propagander.</p>
