<p>Someone should re-write this with more attention to detail and history. In fact, the precedent for Nelson's battle plan at Trafalgar was the battle between Rodney and de Grasse off Iles des Saintes near Martinique in 1780. Rodney had 36 ships-of-the-line and de Grasse 33. The battle opened as usual maneauvering in parallel lines, but when deGrasse ordered a reversal in direction of his entire line, it was not well carried out and gaps appeared. Rodney, seeing the opportunity, ordered a 90-degree turn and movement into the gaps. The British effectively crossed the T of the French fleet in several places. Eventually all the French fleet surrendered or were sunk. The French lost 6,000 men.</p>
<p>Note also - Jervis at Cape St. Vincent 1797 sailed his smaller fleet through the Spanish fleet with the intention of dividing out a segment of the enemy fleet for closer attention. Jervis did intend to keep the ships in order by tacking in succession, after passing through the Spanish fleet. Nelson, who was fourth from the end of the British line, in "Captain" wore his ship out of line, in a questionable, but fortunate, interpretation of orders and headed off a portion of the fleeing Spanish. Jervis certainly <b>did not</b> maintain a line parallel with his opponents.</p>
<p>Also - it was Jervis' reform of the British Fleet in the 1790s that led to the high-quality of crews and much higher level of performance that allowed the melee tactics of Trafalgar to succeed. The <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Navy_80f7.html" title="Royal Navy">British Royal Navy</a> had lost only one battle since 1690, so it didn't begin an era of British Naval Supremacy, it merely continued it. -- Anon</p>

British Navy has lost a LOT of battles since 1690. Being one the Battle of Cartagena (1741)</p>
<p>It be meant to mean it hadnt lost set peice battles like trafalgar, they did however lose several engagements in small battles.</p>

<dd>But I agree that no-one challenged the full might of the Royal Navy until the High Seas Fleet, although the bits of the Royal Navy that happened to be in any one place were challenged from time to time (1812, or the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Cape_St_Vincent_0c0c.html" title="Battle of Cape St Vincent">Battle of Cape St Vincent</a>, for example). -- <a href="../../../a/l/o/User%7EALoan_b332.html" title="User:ALoan">ALoan</a> <a href="../../../a/l/o/User_talk%7EALoan_3527.html" title="User talk:ALoan">(Talk)</a> 14:34, 25 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"no-one challenged the full might of the Royal Navy until the High Seas Fleet": This is not exactly correct: Under Napoleon III and the beginning of the 3rd Republic, the French Navy produced very modern armoured steam ships that were quite ahead of the time, and made the fleets of the time completely obsolete; the proeminent example is the <i><a href="../../../f/s/_/FS_Gloire_%281858-1883%29_fe50.html" title="FS Gloire (1858-1883)">Gloire</a></i>, which was a revolution comparable to what the <i>Dreadnought' would be later.</i></dd>
<dd>So technically, the Royal Navy did have a match at the time. However, France and England had more civilised ways of resolving their differences at this time. <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERama_da58.html" title="User:Rama">Rama</a> 14:51, 25 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The Imperial German Navy was the first navy capable of doing enough damage to the Royal Navy to cripple it: the German plan was to build enough warships that if Britain engaged them directly they could lose too much of their fleet and become open to attack by another nation, it was critical to Britain to maintain naval superiority. They signed it away with the washington treaty, where they agreed to a 1 to 1 parity in battleships with the US.</p>

<dd>None of those large battles involved Britain. The first battle Britain <b>lost</b> after Trafalgar was Coronel in 1914. That's where the 100 years comes from. Actually 109 years. What battles was Britain in since 1805? Well several in the Napoleonic wars including Lissa (1811) and 2 in 1807, and then Navarino (1827), the one against the Portuguese I suppose (1833) and Obligado (1845, only small), the first opium wars (1840s) and several bombardments (1816, 1840, 1854/55 and 1882).</dd>

<p>I am really sorry, I just realised that <i>Téméraire</i> apparently shouldn't have the French diacritics when referring to the <i>HMS Temeraire</i>; I though that she was a French-built prize or something like this... didn't mean anything by this, in any case.

<dd>Nothing to be sorry for, the original Téméraire was a captured French ship and probably should have been written with accents except English writing doesn't use them. The subsequent Temeraires were named with the anglicised French name as part of the psychological warfare of the day. A ship with an "enemy name" indicated that you had been successful in battle and taken the prize. Even when the ship was destroyed, often a new ship was given the captured name. The French fleet at Trafalgar included a Berwick and a Swiftsure, neither of them very French names! <a href="../../../d/a/b/User%7EDabbler_9770.html" title="User:Dabbler">Dabbler</a> 18:36, 12 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Move details of the Trafalgar campaign to a new article on that topic, particularly some of the details under 'West Indies' that are equally relevant to the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Cape_Finisterre_%281805%29_7de9.html" title="Battle of Cape Finisterre (1805)">Battle of Cape Finisterre (1805)</a>.

<p>Was wondering if it was worth mentioning the only person to serve both at Trafalgar and Waterloo? Don Miguel Ricardo Maria Juan de la Mata Domingo Vincente Ferre Alava de Esquivel (mercifully known as Miguel de Alava) served on the Spanish flagship, the Principe de Asturias at Trafalgar. For Waterloo, he was the Spanish ambassador to the Netherlands, and was at Wellington's side during the battle (having previously been Wellington's Spanish liaison officer during the Peninsular War). I was considering adding it to the bit about Sharpe's Trafalgar, for a couple of reasons - Sharpe became the 2nd, albeit fictional) person to serve at both; and I found the details in the Historical Notes at the end of the Sharpe's Trafalgar novel.

<dd>Besides which, he wasn't the only person to serve at both battles. Nicholas Best in his book <i>Trafalgar</i> mentions at least two British midshipmen who transferred to the army and fought at Waterloo, one as a Colour Sergeant. He also mentions Major Antoine Drouot, a French artillery officer, who served on the French fleet at Trafalgar, then went on to survive the retreat from Moscow and then Waterloo.</dd>

<p>This was mentioned in a BBC program on the 200th anniversary<a href="../../../s/m/o/User%7ESmokeyTheCat_31a8.html" title="User:SmokeyTheCat">SmokeyTheCat</a> 10:14, 7 February 2007 I have amended this. "Many hundreds" <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/london/content/articles/2005/10/07/kurt_blackhistorymonth_feature.shtml" class="external free" title="http://www.bbc.co.uk/london/content/articles/2005/10/07/kurt_blackhistorymonth_feature.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.bbc.co.uk/london/content/articles/2005/10/07/kurt_blackhistorymonth_feature.shtml</a></p>
<p>Please don't change the sentence to "may have been black". What may have been is not a fact at all.<a href="../../../s/m/o/User%7ESmokeyTheCat_31a8.html" title="User:SmokeyTheCat">SmokeyTheCat</a> 17:02, 7 February 2007 (UTC) <a href="../../../s/m/o/User%7ESmokeyTheCat_31a8.html" title="User:SmokeyTheCat">SmokeyTheCat</a> 10:22, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Please explain how you can be sure when all that the reference says is "it has been estimated that hundreds of men of African origin made up the numbers in the fleet at Trafalgar" Its an estimate, so they may or may not have been black. Unless you can be more specific with a reference, then it has to include the element of uncertainty. <a href="../../../d/a/b/User%7EDabbler_9770.html" title="User:Dabbler">Dabbler</a> 18:22, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Okay I accept your wording. The point is made.<a href="../../../s/m/o/User%7ESmokeyTheCat_31a8.html" title="User:SmokeyTheCat">SmokeyTheCat</a> 15:03, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
