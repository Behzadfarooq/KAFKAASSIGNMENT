<dd>From what I see is that they don't want too much trivia and I think it is correct. Some parts were kept, but you might want to talk to Fabricationary what is appropriate and what isn't, because there are many things but most are not that relevant in general.

<p>Your page looks great now. You made one little mistake. You closed the Image tag with 4]'s instead of 2]'s. I know very little of Carrie Underwood. She is pretty well known in the US but not that known in Europe, so we haven't heard that much from her over here. But I'll give it a listen. <a href="../../../k/i/t/User%7EKittenKlub_4f17.html" title="User:KittenKlub">KittenKlub</a> 17:44, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, I was a bit cryptical. You typed [[Image:Angelina Jolie.jpg|thumb|right|I am a major fan of Angelina Jolie]]]] but that way you get some ] in your user page. So if you type [[Image:Angelina Jolie.jpg|thumb|right|I am a major fan of Angelina Jolie]] it'll be correct or (even better) [[Image:Angelina Jolie.jpg|thumb|right|I am a major fan of [[Angelina Jolie]]]] because that'll give a link to Angelina as well. <a href="../../../k/i/t/User%7EKittenKlub_4f17.html" title="User:KittenKlub">KittenKlub</a> 17:50, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Userboxes aren't my gig, but I do know the rules for using images in them are a <i>lot</i> more strict than they are for normal articles. It's all got to do with copyright and legal mumbo jumbo like that, but the skinny of it is you can't use an image on your user page or in a userbox unless there aren't restrictions on its use. Basically, only images that have been tagged with a "GFDL" template in their summaries. Most images from comic books and things like that aren't allowed. That's about all I know. I imagine the people who do <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Userboxes_5529.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Userboxes">Wikipedia:WikiProject Userboxes</a> know more. –<a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdashiel_6d8c.html" title="User:Adashiel">Abe Dashiell</a> <sup><b>(<a href="../../../a/d/a/User_talk%7EAdashiel_664f.html" title="User talk:Adashiel">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Adashiel_fbb5.html" title="Special:Contributions/Adashiel">c</a>)</b></sup> 04:36, 14 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yeah, mostly it's original artwork, generic public domain stuff, and really old images. It's an encyclopedia, though, so finding cool images for people to use on their user pages isn't a high priority. –<a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdashiel_6d8c.html" title="User:Adashiel">Abe Dashiell</a> <sup><b>(<a href="../../../a/d/a/User_talk%7EAdashiel_664f.html" title="User talk:Adashiel">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Adashiel_fbb5.html" title="Special:Contributions/Adashiel">c</a>)</b></sup> 04:49, 14 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, to add a contents table in your user page, you need to add == Section == to the user page not ----. And if you upload an image and you want to use it you have to add it to the page like this, [[Image:Example1.JPG|thumb|right|100px]] for example, the px thing is for how big you want the picture to be on the page. The right is how you align, you can align centre, right or left. Thumb is for thumbnail. --<a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerenceong1992_0ff6.html" title="User:Terenceong1992">Terenc</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza">e</a> <a href="../../../t/e/r/User_talk%7ETerenceong1992_1c6d.html" title="User talk:Terenceong1992">Ong</a> 05:54, 14 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Indeed, I use Ankalagon as a name because of the Ancalagon dragon in Tolkien's work. I use it with a K because back in my irc days, the nick was in use. I use it as a nick because I find poetically beautiful that Ancalagon, a symbol of the Greater Evil, destroys Thangorodrim Gates (and, ultimately, the Greater Evil) upon his fall.--<a href="../../../a/n/k/User%7EAnkalagon_7825.html" title="User:Ankalagon">Ankalagon</a> 10:47, 14 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There is really no symbol for paganism as a whole. Like I said, I am a <a href="../../../h/e/l/Hellenic_polytheist.html" title="Hellenic polytheist">Hellenic polytheist</a>. One organization I belong to, <a href="../../../h/e/l/Hellenion.html" title="Hellenion">Hellenion</a>, uses a twelve-pointed star as their symbol.

Personally, I wear a necklace with an emblem of <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medusa.html" title="Medusa">Medusa</a>. I liked the image that was there because it was really abstract; it could either look like fire (a common element in pagan rituals) or a mountain range (since many pagans feel a deep connection with nature).

<dd>Ah. I have heard of sinhala but never studied it much. Is it as related to sanskrit as the other south languages? I mostly studied Telugu which I only went into a tiny bit. I think that the classification systems are just too screwed up. Sanskrit is classified as "indo-european" while Telugu is "dravidian" even thou Telugu had MAJOR Sanskrit influence. There are even Sanskrit words that remained intact through Telugu. A good example is Deva. Deva means god in both Sanskrit and Telugu but in Hindi, god is a different word (I forgot it) even thou Sanskrit and Hindi are supposed to be more related (being in the same family) --Shell 15:37, 16 January 2006 (UTC)

<p>Well, what does best mean to you? Maybe it just means the best-looking acrobatics to some people, in which case you can watch some Wushu tournaments, but that's probably not what you mean. There's San Shou, but it's more or less kickboxing. Anything that involves full contact sparring is better than nothing. I don't think there's such a thing as the best art unless the art includes all possible techniques. So, mixed martial arts is the most complete, by definition. You can call it JKD if you want, but it's just a name. The process is what matters. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShawnc_13f4.html" title="User:Shawnc">Shawnc</a> 06:50, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hapkido is supposed to be practical, just make sure you get to spar in school instead of doing forms and predetermined exercises too often. Wing Chun techniques aren't effectiveness in the ring so far, so beware. If you're interested in becoming a good <i>fighter</i> at today's level, you need to do both grappling and striking. The consensus is that for striking you should do Muay Thai or some form of kickboxing and boxing, and for grappling Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and wrestling (amateur/sport wrestling). Other grappling styles include Sambo and Judo. You can try other arts to mix it up, but those are the basics, if you will. A good role model would be <a href="../../../f/e/d/Fedor_Emelianenko_bc24.html" title="Fedor Emelianenko">this guy</a>. A good mixed martial arts gym will tell you everything you need to know, maybe you can try <a href="http://www.dominance.com.au/" class="external text" title="http://www.dominance.com.au/" rel="nofollow">this place</a>. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShawnc_13f4.html" title="User:Shawnc">Shawnc</a> 18:42, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree with Shawnc, they should have sparring as a major component of their curriculum, as well as groundwork. Ultimately, the best martial art for you is the one you like. Hapkido and Muay Thai are both fine martial arts for young people. I've run into them doing san shou, and they seem to produce tough fighters IME. I haven't sparred with any JKD or BJJ guys (that I know of, they didn't start to get really popular until I was mostly out of the tournament thing, I retired from san shou competition in 1991 or so), so I won't comment. Also, some <a href="../../../h/w/a/Hwarang_Do_dac0.html" title="Hwarang Do">Hwarang Do</a> guys I ran into about 20 years ago were plenty tough. Of Chinese styles, it is almost impossibly difficult to find a good T'ai Chi teacher (my fave), but styles like Baguazhang, Xingyiquan, Praying Mantis and some Eagle Claw are fairly complete. --<a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFire_Star_28a1.html" title="User:Fire Star">Fire Star</a> 22:49, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>If I had to pick out of those: San Shou first and then Hapkido, not due to grappling but because you may get to spar and compete more often in San Shou (I enjoyed it in university), but there is some ground fighting in Hapkido -- to be good you have to do ground techniques seriously, for which I'd definitely suggest you give Brazilian Jiu Jitsu a try or at least Judo. Choy Li Fut is a bit obscure, and Aikido curriculum has a rep for being aesthetic. Ninjutsu I recommend to guys who like to dress up as ninjas, although <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steve_Jennum_ed37.html" title="Steve Jennum">this one guy</a> won a couple matches (and was beaten up for the next three). If you liked boxing and hated Shotokan/Karate, you'd probably like Muay Thai.</p>
<p>Pure strikers often have a hard time against pure grapplers, while both of them will have a hard time against experienced <a href="../../../m/i/x/Mixed_martial_arts.html" title="Mixed martial arts">mixed martial artists</a> who do everything.

<p>Hey, Batzarro. It's been a little while since I watched Bakshi's LOTR all the way through, but to my recollection he doesn't depict Sauron visually at all after the prologue with the backstory about the creation of the Rings. Of course, Bakshi's film only gets as far as Helm's Deep, so it's not a huge problem; Sauron remains mostly an off-screen menace for most of the story anyway. Hope this helps! —<a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJosiah_Rowe_4f72.html" title="User:Josiah Rowe">Josiah Rowe</a> <small>(<a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJosiah_Rowe_ba00.html" title="User talk:Josiah Rowe">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Josiah_Rowe_5f31.html" title="Special:Contributions/Josiah Rowe">contribs</a>)</small> 06:42, 23 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Hmm... I'd say that Bakshi's film was a valiant attempt that ultimately failed. It's arguably closer to Tolkien's novel than the Jackson films are, since it retains more of Tolkien's dialogue, but I don't think it conveys the sense of a complete sub-created world as well as Jackson's films do. It's like a literal translation of a novel or poem written in a foreign language that loses some of the poetic sensibility of the original.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>You ask if it has "action packed battles" or if it's disappointing — its battles aren't particularly strong, but honestly that's not what I see as the heart of <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>. I love <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> for the depth and beauty of the world Tolkien created, and that's where (in my opinion) Jackson surpassed Bakshi. There are some good parts of the Bakshi film — his Nazgûl are wonderfully creepy, and Lothlorien is beautiful (as I say, it's been a while since I saw it all the way through, but I think I may prefer Bakshi's portrayal of Galadriel to Jackson's). But he also makes some questionable choices, such as making Sam a comic buffoon and putting Boromir in a Viking helmet, not to mention turning the conflict between Gandalf and Saruman into a disco light show. He also doesn't manage to convey the thrust of the narrative as well as Jackson does — Bakshi keeps Tolkien's words, but doesn't convey Tolkien's <i>meaning</i> as well as Jackson.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Ralph Bakshi's half-completed <i>Lord of the Rings</i> is probably about as good a film adaptation as it was possible to make before the technology which enabled Peter Jackson to complete his masterpiece. Even though the film is flawed, I still think it's a pity that he wasn't able to complete the story. It would have been interesting to see how he finished the story, and it would be nice to have two complete versions of <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> on film. —<a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJosiah_Rowe_4f72.html" title="User:Josiah Rowe">Josiah Rowe</a> <small>(<a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJosiah_Rowe_ba00.html" title="User talk:Josiah Rowe">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Josiah_Rowe_5f31.html" title="Special:Contributions/Josiah Rowe">contribs</a>)</small> 16:49, 23 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>First off, the Britney pick you uploaded was from a commercial photographer for a wire service; fair use images must be images created with the direct intention of promoting the subject.

<dd>I have not accused you of vandalism. You are making good faith efforts to improve the encyclopedia. However, due to either your inability or unwillingness to follow proper procedure here (including spaces after commas, for instance), and you general unwillingness to learn the various policies of the encyclopedia (<a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> stands out), you are generally unhelpful. Additionally, it is quite obvious that you have used sockpuppets before. <a href="../../../h/i/p/User%7EHipocrite_bee6.html" title="User:Hipocrite">Hipocrite</a> - <a href="../../../h/i/p/User_talk%7EHipocrite_6b44.html" title="User talk:Hipocrite">«<small>Talk</small>»</a> 16:17, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>YOU DO NOT HAVE 2500 EDITS. You miraculously have survived 1400 edits without being permanently banned. But do not ever edit that list of non-admins with lots of edits, or you will face serious and permanent consequences on this project. Also, you have made 128 edits to your userpage in 14 days. Stop.
