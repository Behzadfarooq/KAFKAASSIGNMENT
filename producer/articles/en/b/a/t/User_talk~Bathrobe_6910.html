<p>For the record, I live in the US and I've never heard of doufu. We used to called it "bean curd" and the name changed to "tofu" when it became popular. I don't know how it is called in other English speaking countries. I support using pinyin over WG to do all Chinese transliteration. But I am neutral regarding similar treatment to existing English words. <a href="../../../k/o/w/User%7EKowloonese_2c09.html" title="User:Kowloonese">Kowloonese</a> 19:57, Apr 8, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Just out of interest, I think some residents of the US state of Hawai'i (often ethnic Chinese) do use the pronunciation /doufu/ in English, not the pseudo-WG (incorrect) pronunciation /tofu/ (i.e. voiced "t"). --<a href="../../../d/p/r/User%7EDpr_d663.html" title="User:Dpr">Dpr</a> 01:56, 8 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The most important difference is whether you are talking about an English word or a Chinese object. When the name is already entered the English language as Tofu, it is just silly to argue how the original Chinese word is pronounced. Clarify the pronunciation in the corresponding Chinese article in the Chinese version of wikipedia. The English name has become part of the English language and should not be changed. <a href="../../../k/o/w/User%7EKowloonese_2c09.html" title="User:Kowloonese">Kowloonese</a> 01:05, 1 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>/tofu/ is not 'pseudo-WG'; it is from Japanese. For cultural/nationalistic reasons, some Chinese take exception to the fact that English uses a Japanese term for something that was originally Chinese. For such people, ousting the Japanese term and replacing it with Chinese is seen as 'setting things right'. <a href="../../../b/a/t/User%7EBathrobe_e70b.html" title="User:Bathrobe">Bathrobe</a> 11:16, 1 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>With regard to deleting the pronunciation for the Hebrew: I felt that it was the semantic content of the Hebrew name for the sea, rather than the pronunciation, which was important to the paragraph in question. For instance, the part which gives the name in the Bible "the Great Sea" in the Bible does not give the literal Greek or Aramaic for this.</p>
<p>I considered deleting the Hebrew characters as well, but for some reason chose not to. I think we should avoid devoting excessive space to any one language here unless the meaning of its name for the Mediterranean is interesting or relevant somehow, as there are too many countries and languages bordering on the Mediterranean to mention them all. <a href="../../../s/a/f/User%7ESaforrest_5781.html" title="User:Saforrest">Saforrest</a> 16:17, Apr 10, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I love it too. Hey bathrobe, maybe you can offer your website's content under GFDL so we can easily use it on Wikipedia?

<p>The content of my article on days of the week is all from published sources. As long as it isn't reproduced absolutely verbatim, I'm happy for people to take information / conclusions from the site and use them elsewhere. The conclusion that 'xingqi' is not the original word for 'week' in Chinese has been reached by others on better evidence than I have. The main "slant" I've given it is criticism of modern Chinese sources (dictionaries, etc.) for twisting the word's pedigree to make it sound like something it is not.</p>
<p>(Actually, it was when I was researching the site that I first came to realise how deeply ideological history is in East Asia. It became clear that there are Chinese who want to prove that everything came from ancient China; there are Japanese who want to show that they are not simply an offshoot of Chinese culture, and that the Japanese day names came not from the Chinese, as the Chinese would claim, but almost direct from an Indian monk who got them from the West. In many ways, the "war" over history is still going on!) <a href="../../../b/a/t/User%7EBathrobe_e70b.html" title="User:Bathrobe">Bathrobe</a> 01:38, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi. Thank you for your contributions to Wikipedia. I just wanted to give you some helpful advice, or maybe just a reminder about a feature in Wikipedia known as an <a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEdit_summary_0886.html" title="Wikipedia:Edit summary">edit summary</a>. The edit summary is filled out using the 200 word text field located right below the editing <a href="../../../t/e/x/Text_box.html" title="Text box">text box</a>. It is strongly recommended that one get in the habit of filling out edit summaries for each edit, giving a general summary of why particular changes were made, as well as a very terse summary of what those changes were. Edit summaries are a way to defend your edits, especially if you're an <a href="../../../a/n/o/Wikipedia%7EAnonymous_user_3e28.html" title="Wikipedia:Anonymous user">anonymous user</a>. Ambiguous edits made by anonymous users may often be mistaken for <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVandalism_70f0.html" title="Wikipedia:Vandalism">vandalism</a>. Filling out the edit summary also gives the users who monitor those pages on <a href="../../../w/a/t/Wikipedia%7EWatchlist_eb79.html" title="Wikipedia:Watchlist">watch lists</a> or <a href="../../../r/e/c/Special%7ERecentchanges_05b8.html" title="Special:Recentchanges">recent changes</a>, an idea of what kind of activity has taken place. If these changes do not strongly affect the content of the article, mark the <i>This is a minor edit</i> check box below the edit summary field. For further help on using edit summaries, consult <a href="../../../e/d/i/Help%7EEdit_summary_ca7e.html" title="Help:Edit summary">this guide</a>.

<p>Bathrobe, I feel the Patua page is packed with information, and by now means in dire need of improvement. I'm probably too liberal in my use of the <i>attention</i> tag. Nonetheless, I usually "tag" pages that I admire! I just think the article could use more technical linguistic terminology and could stand to be copyedited for style and grammar. Parts are rather informal. In fact, if I have a chance, I will try my hand at this task myself. Thanks for the interest.

<p>I see your point. Maybe it would be better to start a new page, List of historical place names in Japanese or something. Still there is a precedent on the page; if you look at the entry for "Ethiopia" you see all the languages' words for "Abyssinia" as well as "Ethiopia". Just do a search in the page for the word "former" and you'll see a lot more. --<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a>/<a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr"><sub><span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">tɔk tə mi</span></sub></a> 11:03, 9 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think it's a great idea, and of course it should include Chinese (as many dialects as possible, at the very least Mandarin and Cantonese), Japanese, Korean, and Vietnamese. <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_country_names_in_various_languages.html" title="List of country names in various languages">List of country names in various languages</a> is already incredibly long, and anything that encourages people to contribute elsewhere is good. The fact that you don't know Korean doesn't matter; it's a wiki, so someone else will come along and fill the Korean in. Now we just have to find a good brief, NPOV title for the page. --<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a>/<a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr"><sub><span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">tɔk tə mi</span></sub></a> 12:30, 9 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Your comments on my page were: "I am also a little concerned at the Sinocentric nature of such an attempt. It can't be denied that Chinese characters were the cultural binding force of East Asia and that they lie behind a lot of current Vietnamese vocabulary. Since many people know Chinese and Japanese, putting in characters is no doubt a useful way of linking Vietnamese to a greater body of shared knowledge. But I feel there is a danger of cultural bias. Why put in the Chinese characters and not the Chu Nom, for instance? Because Chu Nom is a minor script? A dead script? Isn't that just belittling things that are uniquely Vietnamese in favour of aspects that are tied to 'great and ancient culture' of her neighbour?"</p>
<p>It's pleasant to see a Chinese speaker interested in Chinese etymology of Vietnamese terminology. I'm the opposite, I'm a Vietnamese speaker who appreciates knowledge of my fellow East-Asian Sinoworld members, as I am not pleased with my own people being erroneously called "Southeast Asians". Historically and culturally that term does not reflect the Vietnamese people, and is almost an insult to some of us, though not myself. You also sound like you are on my side of this so-called "argument". The <a href="../../../c/h/u/Chu_Nom_cbbd.html" title="Chu Nom">Chu Nom</a> system was actually written only for vernacular Vietnamese words that had no Chinese equivalent, but Chu Nom would have included Sino-Vietnamese words as well, virtually unaltered in wriiten form.</p>
<p>My Vietnamese name, for instance, is written Lê Anh-Huy, in vernacular Latin Vietnamese. But it would be "黎英辉" for both Chinese and Chu Nom. Take care. <a href="../../../l/e/_/User%7ELe_Anh-Huy_5e6c.html" title="User:Le Anh-Huy">User:Le Anh-Huy</a></p>

<p>You are right, turning back the clock is not the answer, but it is easy to mislead people through "supressed information" (ie. overseas Vietnamese Catholics often deny any Sinosphere cultural roots in Vietnamese culture and overglorify French intrusions into vernacular Vietnamese trends...I noticed you said you're from Australia, I find the Vietnamese community living in your beautiful country most often comes from this misled "modernist" discourse to understanding their own ancestors' history), as I think you mentioned.</p>

<p>I'm also interested in your opinion about something that's been bothering me: the EN version of Wikipedia is for readers of English, but there's a great deal of ZH in articles about Chinese subjects. I find all the parentheses with ZH characters make it difficult to read, and I question their value to EN readers. Is it just there for the (relatively) tiny group of EN+ZH readers? Has an argument been made for or against it? I would think that it belongs on the page, but not in the text itself; the {{<a href="../../../c/h/i/Template%7EChinese_0a9e.html" title="Template:Chinese">Chinese</a>}} template seems like a good way to handle it, but I notice that on, for example, <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grand_Canal_of_China_6736.html" title="Grand Canal of China">Grand Canal of China</a> it's moving the other direction.

<p>Thank you for your message. I may have used provocative words, but let me explain what I have felt. To me, it seems Korean posters take almost obsessive interests and politicize historical facts in Japanese history, boasting and showing attitudes like "Japan owes what it is today to Korea (for what happed 1500years ago) ". See <a href="../../../k/o/r/Talk%7EKorean-Japanese_disputes_8ade.html" title="Talk:Korean-Japanese disputes">Talk:Korean-Japanese_disputes</a>. It is true that Buddhism and Chinese culture was introduced from the Korean peninsula, but that is due to the geographcal location; only because Japan is more far from India and China. I believe these ideas due to <a href="../../../s/i/n/Sinocentrism.html" title="Sinocentrism">Sinocentrism</a>, which you might understand becuase of your contributions to Wikipedia. (It is true Japan also had, but it has disapeared by US occupation after WWII).</p>
<dl>
<dd>Under this scheme of international relations, only China had an Emperor or 'huangdi' (皇帝), who was the Son of Heaven; other countries only had Kings or 'wang' (王). (See Chinese sovereign). The Japanese use of the term Emperor or 'tennō' (天皇) for the ruler of Japan was a subversion of this principle. <i>Significantly, the Koreans still refer to the Japanese Emperor as a King, conforming with the traditional Chinese usage.</i></dd>

<p>Hi, I received your message about suggestion on starting an article about Korean scholar, Yi Sugwnag. Although I'm not personally an expect on subject of thinkers and intellectuals of East Asia, an article on Yi Su-Gwang would be a great idea indeed. There aren't much English information on his life and works though. I currently do not have the time to write the entire article, but I could start the basic structure for it, and have more editors participate in the article creation process. I don't have much time on my hands now and i'm trying to find more sources to start articles regarding RoK navy/air force and its armamaments, so it take a while for me to start a page on him. If you can contact other editors who are acquainted well with Korean history and get them to start articles regarding Eastern thinkers of Korea, I'll be glad to lend my hand. <a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeiaemeth_5750.html" title="User:Deiaemeth">Deiaemeth</a> 22:25, 13 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>There's a difference between disagreeing with an argument, and simply not presenting that argument at all. If an argument is solid and has merit, than it should be able to withstand objections and criticism, and similarly, if an argument is completely without merit, then such should be easily spotted by a reader, should it not? That argument you quoted is one I'm familiar with. As you said, Sinocentrism is a complicated subject encompassing many historical concepts and different perspectives.</p>
<p>Certain accusations of sinocentrism merely state that the various Chinese states regarded (or continue to regard) themselves as superior to others, others that they exibited signs of sinocentrism through their interactions with the rest of Asia, sinocentrism as conquest, sinocentrism as cultural imperialism, sinocentrism displayed by individual people, etc. That argument seems to be an objection not to the tribue-vassal foreign relationship system, but to the specific sinocentric charge that those old Chinese states enforced cultural imperialism through its forced adoption by other cultures or maybe that China's sinocentrism was used as a motivation for conquest, and sinocentrism as a percieved sense of racial or cultural superiority. Particularly, this line: "In modern times, this can take the form of according China unwarranted significance or supremacy at the cost of other nations in East Asia or elsewhere in the world." But of course, if sinocentrism isn't clearly defined, then it can't be clearly objected to, can it?</p>
<p>I'll comment on my deleted line. This line, to me, seemed blatently NPOV:</p>
<dl>
<dd>While this possibly means that "chauvinism" was not everpresent, it also suggests that the Chinese, like many civilizations that consider themselves superior, were willing to accept people from other cultures as long as they conformed to metropolitan standards.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Instead of discussing whether or not the Chinese self-perception of superiority was true, it simply assumes it so, and then uses it to support the argument of sinocentrism.</p>
<p>The other line, I think the reason for deletion was rather obvious for its factual shortcomings. Were such an attitude about Manchu and Mongol conquests to actually hold true, all of Central Asia, Persia, Siberia, and Russia might well be regarded as part of the Chinese heartland. (which obviously isn't true) And Zhonghua Minzu is supposed to be a response and reversal of centuries of Han chauvanism, yet both somehow seem to get tied into sinocentrism.</p>
<p>Personally, I think there are too often confused attempts to conflate historical Chinese attitudes towards barbarians, various historical Chinese political concepts like the tribute-vassal relationships, experiences of the Europeans like McCartney, Han chauvaunism, Chinese military conquests, Zhonghua Minzu, anti-Japanese sentiment, Chinese nationalism, communism, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Tibet, Xinjiang, Chinese names, characters, and language, etc from various stages and aspects of several thousand years of history and collectively lump them all together into, "Chinese are racist and bad, mkay?" and call it by the convenient catchall of Sinocentrism.</p>
<p>Personally, I would divide it up into sinocentrism by ancient imperial politics, by culture, by historical narrative, etc. and then put the specific counter arguments, if any, after each section. Currently, the article looks incredibly disjoint right now, explaining ancient imperial politics on one hand and then showing spaghetti as a sign of modern cultural imperialism on the other. --<a href="../../../y/u/j/User%7EYuje_76b7.html" title="User:Yuje">Yuje</a> 08:51, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>While you're essentially right, I'd like to make a couple points. Tokyo was originally spelled Tokio, and then eventually Tokyo, and at about the same time people began trying to spell it Tōkyō and Toukyou. Accurate romanization of languages that don't use roman characters is a rather new phenomenon. But all that's beside the point.</p>
<p>I realize that it's quite an uphill battle. I've put the quote on my user page to remind me of that. I don't mind the concept of macrons at all; I believe Japanese has the right to be represented accurately as much as any other language. I just can't see past the technicalities of inputting macrons, and using them in Wikipedia. For the record, I kind of disagree with the use of "orthoghraphical" accents and macrons in the titles of articles for other languages as well (Vietnamese, Pinyin), although I would never challenge a French or Spanish spelling. That's one of the reasons I wanted to call this meditation as well, the Wikipedia infrastructure has no means of controlling large issues like this, and it should not be left to a vote between Japanified editors. As long as someone that has some real feel for the way Wikifoundation works makes the final decision, I won't make any more fuss about it. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreshgavin_9ad7.html" title="User:Freshgavin"><font size="-2" color="white" style="background:blue">&#160;freshgavin</font></a><a href="../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFreshgavin_46e9.html" title="User talk:Freshgavin"><font size="-2" color="blue">ΓΛĿЌ&#160;</font></a> 23:47, 13 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Ah, I wasn't aware that some countries had switched to horizontal writing altogether. In that case, I accept that I should have tried to compromise rather than simply reverting. Apologies for a too-hasty action.</p>
<p>I've edited the article again to try a wording that states that horizontal writing is "increasingly common", which I think is a more accurate summary of the situation than either extreme. If you think this is still misleading, then by all means please adjust it again.</p>

<dd>If the trend in Chinese is clear enough that even "increasingly common" seems too weak to describe it, then naturally I won't object if you want to strengthen the wording further - my edit is purely a suggestion and a stopgap measure to ensure that the text wasn't <i>totally</i> unacceptable to either of us. As you may have gathered, my knowledge is largely restricted to Japanese, so I don't claim to have a good feel for how well any given phrasing will describe the situation in other languages.</dd>
<dd>My main concern is to avoid anything that looks like a prediction that horizontal writing is certain to take over. It does seem to me that the status of vertical writing in Japan is still fairly secure; I've never seen a book other than a bilingual dictionary use anything else. But I'm willing to consider the possibility that I'm erring on the side of conservatism.</dd>
<dd>Perhaps it could be modified to state that horizontal writing is "increasingly common, and now [almost] ubiquitous in some [countries/contexts/areas]"? Would something along those lines be an improvement?</dd>
<dd>(Incidentally, I believe some versions of Internet Explorer support vertical text layout, which does make it seem rather strange that it's not commonly used. Possibly some link to the general bias of web users in favour of the young and more radical?)</dd>

<dd>I don't see vertical writing in Taiwan disappearing in Taiwan anytime soon; I'm not sure the statement that "most" newspapers have switched to horizontal is correct either.

<p>I don't think the words are going to be changed to make them fit Eurasia. First certain political bodies would have to change their name and identity. Europe is acknowledged as a political body in Europe. Asia is acknowledged as a political body in SAARC and ASEAN. Second labeling would be hard for some regions. Far Western Eurasia and Far Eastern Eurasia might be acceptable but the regions in the middle of Eurasia would be hard to label. I don't think the change will happen in Eurasia and I hope you don't change wiki around to confuse users to make it fit the Eurasia concept. -- 18:00 March 30 2006<a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDark_Tichondrias_cd32.html" title="User:Dark Tichondrias">User:Dark Tichondrias</a></p>

<p>Yeah, it's gonna be a long uphill battle. I'm reading through the Japanese 百人斬り競争 wiki article and translating it into English, but there's a lot of BS involved with this issue on the Japanese side as well. Someone there went through and changed the references to victims from "people" to "Chinese soldiers", which of course, it doesn't say in the source articles. Damn ideologues.</p>

<p>Hi, and thanks for asking.</p>
<p>The reason I recommended the merger between the pages is that (from what I saw), there was a correlation between the riots and the holiday. Considering that the page on Muslim <a href="../../../h/a/j/Hajj.html" title="Hajj">hajj</a> contains information on similar situations (there is also the fork article <a href="../../../i/n/c/Incidents_during_the_Hajj_04ea.html" title="Incidents during the Hajj">Incidents during the Hajj</a>), and I am looking for incidents that have occurred in Christianity and other religions as well, I thought the two articles should be intertwined or merged.</p>
<p>If the 2006 riots have nothing to do with holi (which, again, from my POV, it seemed that they did), then I'll be fine with a cancellation of a merger. I'm not out to offend anyone at all; I merely thought that it was a valid point, enough so that I'm looking for similar instances in other religions (aside from hajj incidents) so that I don't appear hypocritical or anti-Hindu.</p>
<p>Hope this helps.--<font color="#4B0082"><b><a href="../../../m/i/t/User%7EMitsukai_f72e.html" title="User:Mitsukai">み使い</a></b></font> <i><b><a href="../../../m/i/t/User_talk%7EMitsukai_5376.html" title="User talk:Mitsukai">Mitsukai</a></b></i> 12:46, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi. The term Silhak came into being in the late 17th - 18th century. This links explains what Silhak is (very briefly) <a href="http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9067754" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9067754" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. It basically de-emphasized Confucianism and argued adopting more modern schools of thought in statecraft. Silhak attacked neo-confucianism. They also argued for modern approach to economy, sciences, and philosophies, arguing that Yangban-class of Korea, who practiced confucianism and was very conservative, was deletrious to the interest of the Korean people and the state. Their reasoning was that the Yangban-class did not participate in any economic activity - all they did was sit around and study confucianist school of thought. Silhak practicionners argued for supply-side economics and revival of economy. <a href="http://web.skku.edu/~sulhang1//majer/ma5/ko14.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://web.skku.edu/~sulhang1//majer/ma5/ko14.htm" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> Yi Su-Gwang is considered early Silhakja, but he didn't attack confucianism outright. <a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeiaemeth_5750.html" title="User:Deiaemeth">Deiaemeth</a> 04:21, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Bathrobe.. thanks for the reply. My point, which you seem to agree with, in the redirect page was that in English, "Chang Jiang" is not well-known. Indisputably, it is the more-common (i.e. official, as it were) name of the river in China.

<p>Ni Hao. Thanks for the explanation on my talk page regarding that. It would be nice if the article explained this explicitly, though (it might, but I found it too confusing and not to the point). A short while ago I tried learning Hanzi but eventually stopped; I guess I could always start again. Enjoy your day. <a href="../../../z/y/x/User%7EZyxoas_fea8.html" title="User:Zyxoas">Zyxoas</a> (<a href="../../../z/y/x/User_talk%7EZyxoas_e0dd.html" title="User talk:Zyxoas">talk to me - I'll listen</a>)</p>

<p>very sorry for that... I meant to use that (to avoid the "oo/ou" discrepancy), but I was then in a haste and forgot to do so, sorry&#160;:( Cheers.--<a href="../../../k/2E/c/User%7EK.C._Tang_75f3.html" title="User:K.C. Tang">K.C. Tang</a> 09:48, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Guess I need to brush up on my Wiki policies. I guess I felt that since i wasn't making major changes I wasn't stepping on anyone's toes. As for the talk page thing I was treating it like a message system, so I was deleting a read message. I've restored my talk page. I feel silly now, and I've felt I've disrespected the wiki community. I hope you understand I meant no harm.<a href="../../../k/o/z/User%7EKozo_d7ea.html" title="User:Kozo">kojaxs</a> 04:26, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, the <a href="../../../m/o/s/WP%7EMOS_8984.html#Avoid_first-person_pronouns_and_one" title="WP:MOS">Manual of Style</a> is probably what you want regarding avoiding 1st/2nd person. Encyclopediae have almost never, historically, been written using 1st/2nd person, and scholarly works similarly tend to avoid it - if in some circumstances professors use it in lectures, we can probably attribute that to differences between spoken and written english -- the same professor would probably not do that in written works. The important part is encyclopedic tradition and a consistent style. Take care. --<a href="../../../i/m/p/User%7EImprov_b282.html" title="User:Improv">Improv</a> 18:35, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Bathrobe,</p>
<p>I reverted only because the edit was by a banned user. <a href="../../../b/a/n/WP%7EBAN_eb66.html" title="WP:BAN">WP:BAN</a> states that "<i>any edits made in defiance of a ban may be <a href="../../../r/e/v/Wikipedia%7ERevert_d321.html" title="Wikipedia:Revert">reverted</a> to enforce the ban, regardless of the merits of the edits themselves</i>". Feel free to revert me if you like, I have no opinion on the matter.

<p>Bathrobe: This error is due to a caching server or proxy server between you and the website you are trying to access. IT is entirely possibly the URL for the Yangtze entry is being targeted, there is little way to figure out otherwise. POSIX is a hypothetical Unix standard which is used for a lot of programming by the Linux community (notice the ---ix ---ux endings, all related operating systems). It is my understanding that the Linux OS is widely in use by PRC <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIzaakb_e0a3.html" title="User:Izaakb">Izaakb</a> 16:55, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
