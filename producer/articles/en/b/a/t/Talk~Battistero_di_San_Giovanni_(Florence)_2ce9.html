	    <p>"Battisteria" is a barbarism; the Italian word is "battistero". Since a change had to be made, I added (Florence) since there are many baptistries in honor of St. John, of course. -- <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBill_Thayer_8b58.html" title="User:Bill Thayer">Bill</a> 16:09, 5 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

<li>Fair enough. I don't speak Italian. The guidebook I consulted listed it as the Battisteria, which seems to be a name that is in use. -- <a href="../../../n/e/c/User%7ENecrothesp_7ebf.html" title="User:Necrothesp">Necrothesp</a> 18:13, 5 Oct 2004 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Can well understand that; no shortage of slovenly books, alas! and of course once something gets into print, everybody says "I&#160;saw it in a book" and our collective geese are cooked. I&#160;fight this kind of thing every day, and sometimes get trapped by it myself. It's irksome having to check everything all over again, though. Best, B.</dd>

<p>Hi, all. According to <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28common_names%29_764d.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (common names)">Wikipedia:Naming conventions (common names)</a>, we're supposed to use "the most common name of a person or thing". (The page <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28use_English%29_65c0.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (use English)">Wikipedia:Naming conventions (use English)</a> is also of some relevance.)</p>
<p>Alas, "Battistero di San Giovanni" is definitely not the most common name for that building in the English-speaking world. Doing a web search on pages in English, we get the following count:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Battistero di San Giovanni" - 164</li>
<li>"Battisteria di San Giovanni" - 49</li>
<li>Baptistery AND "San Giovanni" - 1,330</li>
<li>Baptistery AND Florence - 19,400</li>
</ul>
<p>I used the compound search 'Baptistery AND Florence' to try and weed out references to other baptisteries. I reckon there are that many pages that include "Baptistery" and "Florence" that aren't about <i>the</i> Baptistery. Still, even if you guess that maybe 25% of the pages above are bad hits, it's clear that the predominant name for that building is simply the "Baptistery". (I included the search for 'Baptistery AND "San Giovanni"' to make it clear that it's not being called the "Baptistery of San Giovanni".)</p>
<p>So, unless someone has a cogent argument as to why we should ignore Wikipedia policy in this case, I am proposing to move this page to "Baptistery".</p>
<p>We will need a page about what a "baptistery" is, which I will write; we will need to add a disambig link to that new page to the top of this page. I will also fix all the pages that link to "baptistery" to refer to that new page.</p>

<li>You can't just move it to "Baptistery". There are many baptisteries in the world, some of them (Pisa, for instance) as famous as Florence's. Baptistery of St John, Florence, maybe? Or Baptistery of San Giovanni, Florence? That's where we run into difficulties by not using the correct name. I tend to prefer non-anglicisation of names of foreign buildings for that reason. -- <a href="../../../n/e/c/User%7ENecrothesp_7ebf.html" title="User:Necrothesp">Necrothesp</a> 12:48, 20 Oct 2004 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Hey, I happen to agree with you about using full names (I would love to put e.g. all the Medici articles under their full formal names, with redirects from the popular names), but to my considerable distress (I simply cannot fathom how any other policy on naming of articles is viable or acceptable), that is, alas, not Wikipedia policy.... Please get it changed!</p>
<p>As to the notion that there are other Baptisteries that are as famous as the one in Florence, I would reply "you're joking", but of course you're not. There is simply no way that the one in Pisa is anything like as famous as the one in Florence, whose doors are famed as one of the greatest (if not <b>the</b> greatest) works of Renaissance bronze casting. To confirm that, try doing a Google check, which returns:</p>
<ul>
<li>Baptistery Pisa NOT Florence 862</li>
</ul>
<p>I included the 'NOT Florence' to cull out sites that are general Italian guides, which I expect say things like "you must see the Leaning Tower of Pisa and the Baptistery in Florence". For strict comparison, here is the counterpart:</p>
<ul>
<li>Baptistery Florence NOT Pisa 10,800</li>
</ul>
<p>The counts above clearly show it's the Florence one that is by far the more famous. Yes, looking at the first ten or so pages of hits for 'Baptistery NOT Florence' (about 33K hits total), it does seem as if the Pisa Baptistery is the most famous <i>other</i> Baptistery - although more than a handful of those pages I looked at <b>were</b> for the Florence one, actually; which just goes to show that it's very often referred to as simply "the Baptistery".</p>
<p>Do you have any issues with the methodology I employed in a 'reasonable' attempt to see what the most common name is? Or are you in agreement that the most common meaning of a simple "the Baptistery" is the one in Florence?</p>
<p><a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> 17:17, 20 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>PS: As to the other possible names (Baptistery of St John; Baptistery of St John, Florence; Baptistery of San Giovanni; Baptistery of San Giovanni, Florence, etc) I would suggest we put redirects at <b>all</b> of them - that will prevent someone creating a duplicate page because they weren't diligent enough in searching. If a conflict happens down the road (e.g. with some other "Baptistery of St John"), we can fix it then.</p>
<p>I almost caused a duplicate myself, when <a href="../../../b/a/p/Baptistery.html" title="Baptistery">Baptistery</a> still turned up blank (this page is relatively recent, and it's been on my "to-do" list for a long time), which is why I have placed a redirect there until we decide exactly what to do. <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> 17:23, 20 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>No, I would certainly not agree that "The Baptistery" is the one in Florence. It needs a qualifier of some sort. There are baptisteries all over the world - it's just a noun, not a proper name. Saying the article should just be entitled "Baptistery" is like saying the article on the Tower of London should just be entitled "Tower". If I said "The Baptistery" with no context attached then nobody would know which one I was talking about. -- <a href="../../../n/e/c/User%7ENecrothesp_7ebf.html" title="User:Necrothesp">Necrothesp</a> 17:43, 20 Oct 2004 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Look, that's an <i>assertion</i>, not <i>data</i>. I can assert the contrary and we can sit here all day getting nowhere.</p>
<p>I'm looking for either i) empirical data, or ii) ideas for improving the (admittedly rough) methods I'm trying to use to gather such data. E.g. you could have said (to use an problem with my method which I earlier came up with on my own, trying to improve the data) something like 'looking for 'Baptistery Florence NOT Pisa' is not going to be very accurate, because you could have been turning up pages that called it the "Baptistery of St John in Florence"'. Then we could do some more searching and turn up:</p>
<ul>
<li>Baptistery Florence NOT Pisa - 10,800</li>
<li>Baptistery Florence Giovanni John NOT Pisa - 566</li>
<li>Baptistery Florence John NOT Pisa NOT Giovanni - 1,070</li>
<li>Baptistery Florence Giovanni NOT Pisa NOT John - 586</li>
<li>Baptistery Florence NOT Pisa NOT John NOT Giovanni - 2,470</li>
</ul>
<p>(And I have <b>no</b> idea why the last four don't sum to the first one - logically, they should, if the searches are working correctly.).</p>
<p>But right now <b>the data</b>, while admittedly rough, <i>seems</i> telling me that English-speaking people are using either "the Baptistery" or "the Baptistery, Florence" (my data doesn't distinguish) a lot more than they are using "Baptistery of St. John" or "Baptistery of San Giovanni".</p>
<p>Do you have any suggestions for ways to improve the data? <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> 19:45, 20 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I'm not sure what you're trying to prove here. I didn't say you couldn't use "Baptistery, Florence" (although it is an immensely ugly title, which is why I moved it, having initially created the article under that title myself). I simply said that just using "Baptistery" without a qualifier was not helpful, since an article entitled "Baptistery" should be about baptisteries in general, not a single baptistery. Common sense. -- <a href="../../../n/e/c/User%7ENecrothesp_7ebf.html" title="User:Necrothesp">Necrothesp</a> 10:23, 21 Oct 2004 (UTC)</li>
