<h2><span class="mw-headline">What about Batman's zipline thing?</span></h2>
<p>I see him using his zipline/grappling hook thing all the time in the shows (whenever he needs to scale a building or falls out of one), but it's not mentioned at all in this article. I would put it in, but I don't know what its name is.</p>
<p><a name="I_added_another_ability_for_Batman" id="I_added_another_ability_for_Batman"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">I added another ability for Batman</span></h2>
<p>In the Batman TAS (the animated series) Batman is revealed to be an expert ventriloquist. He learrned his skills from Zatanna and is revealed in the episode "Read my Lips" of the animated series.</p>
<p>-G</p>
<p>I'm going to add another ability, "Photographic memory". It was made apparent in episode "Avatar", season two of Batmans TAS. Only looking at a scroll for a split second, Bruce had memorized the map on the scroll and was able to reach his destination.</p>
<p><a name="Batman_as_a_Villain" id="Batman_as_a_Villain"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">Batman as a Villain</span></h2>
<p>Batman is seen as a criminal by the likes of Poison Ivy because of the negative effects brought about by Wayne Enterprises. The Joker, Two-Face, The Penguin, and others were created by being exposed to Wayne Chemicals. Wayne Enterprises sells weapons to the US military and can thus be seen as a war profiteer. Since Batman exists in a universe much like the real one you cannot expect his Wayne Oil division to be environmentally sound. So there it is -- Comic book characters are often more dynmaic than just "good" or "bad" -- "hero" -- or "villain". In fact, philosophically, Batman and Green Arrow have ideological arguments since Batman is pro-oligarchy and The Green Arrow takes the side of the working man. If you must delete the reality of the edit, at least create a new section for it such as Criticism of Batman's moral character by his foes and other heroes".</p>
<dl>
<dd>That is why I'm okay with this being under its own heading. Why do you keep on adding it to the intro? <a href="../../../g/d/o/User%7EGdo01_992f.html" title="User:Gdo01">Gdo01</a> 20:29, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I've now added a new section between "Batman Villains" and "Homosexual Interpretations".</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>I was not the one who put in this line but it seems relevant as one of his weaknesses: "In Superman/Batman #8-13, he is willing to do whatever is "necessary" to destroy evil, including destroying an entire world of inhabitants." Furthermore... I think Wayne Enterprises HAVE caused much harm by the super-villains they've created such as The Joker, Clayface, etc. In the movie "Batman Begins" Bruce Wayne is thrown in prison for stealing food -- whcih is even more condemnation of his corporate culture. Poison Ivy is also very critical of the environmental devesttion caused by Wayne Enterprises (which is rather directly guided by Bruce Wayne).</p>
<dl>
<dd>To my knowledge none of the Clayfaces were formed due to Wayne Enterprises. The closest one was a former S.T.A.R. Labs employee. The chemical plant in which Joker was "formed" has never been linked to Wayne Enterprises. Bruce was thrown in jail in <i>Batman Begins</i> because he was stealing in order to live like a criminal so he could learn to hi understand them. This has nothing to do with his supposed "villainny." Other than that all you have is the word of Poison Ivy which you have not cited. What comic book page is her critique from? <a href="../../../g/d/o/User%7EGdo01_992f.html" title="User:Gdo01">Gdo01</a> 21:42, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Several Clayfaces exist but at least one, Basil Karlo (in an episode of "The Batman" entitled Clayfaces), broke into Wayne Industries, then he steals and drinks a sample of the Clayface mutagen. As for the Joker it is temporarily unconfirmed whether or not it was actually a Wayne Chemicals vat which the Joker (previously known as the Red Hood) was pushed into by Batman - but it was in Gotham where Wayne Enterprises is heavily entrenched as the number one industrial employer (and Wayne Chemicals is a branch of Wayne Industries). One origin has the Joker as an employee of a chemical plant (like Wayne Chemicals) and this would be just another Wayne Enterprises employee to turn into a super-villian (like Mr.Freeze, Edward Nigma, Poison Ivy, etc.) And the crime illustrated in the film is not that he stole food but that he (Bruce Wayne) retained so much wealth while others where starving and thrown in prison for crimesl like stealing food. Poison Ivy as an extreme environmentalist faults several of Wayne Enterprises divisions most popularly in the Batman&amp;Robin movie. In any case, mining and oil drilling and refining are environemtnally destructive activities which Wayne Enterprises are involved. Furthermore it is confirmed that Wayne Enterprises is in the business of manufacturing and distributing hi-tech weapons (which is also of dubious moral character).</p>
<dl>
<dd>So much of what you assert is speculation and POV; the owner of the chemical company, the "crime" illustrated in the film, the enviromental practices of Wayne Oil, the "dubious moral character" of producing weapons. <a href="../../../c/o/v/User%7ECovenantD_b5a4.html" title="User:CovenantD">CovenantD</a> 22:49, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Wait, the mutagen Basil Rathbone ate was being used by Wayne Enterprises to cure the original Clayface. Every example you are trying to use is either a conjecture, which we cannot use, or based on your viewing of a children's cartoon. Stop pushing your viewpoint; it violates <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> and is against consensus.

</dl>
<p>Being called a hero after acting as judge, jury, and executioner is also POV (moreso as I see it). The Environmental consequences in the DC world (which is very much like the real world) are likely to be similiar -- and HAVE IN FACT BEEN CITED by the militant environmentalist Poison Ivy. Manufacturing and distributing hi-tech weapons IS UNDOUBTEDLY of dubious moral character. He's an arms dealer for goodness sake! Similiar crimes by Lex Luthor through Lexcorp. are not so easily dismissed and ignored -- they make make Lex Luthor a villain! So the onus of POV seems to fall on those who claim it's criminal for one and not for the other because one is a "super-villian" and the other is a "super-hero."</p>
<dl>
<dd>I must emphasis that we're talking about a fictional character. NPOV concerns people's concepts of the character, ie. the homosexuality debate. Not the character's antagonists grievances against him. They're written to hate him. <a href="../../../w/e/s/User%7EWesleyDodds_17ee.html" title="User:WesleyDodds">WesleyDodds</a> 22:56, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Yes, but since he and his universe are being talked about extensively to encompass all the facts involved with them -- all the facts should be presented. I think it's funny how you accept the homosexuality debate because that is a concept people have of him but you don't except him as an oligarchic elitist protecting his own interests (because no one apparently conceives of him as such?).</p>
<dl>
<dd>That's because we have references for the homosexuality debate. Without reference your "oligarchic elitist" interpretation is original research and does not warrant a place in this article. <a href="../../../w/e/s/User%7EWesleyDodds_17ee.html" title="User:WesleyDodds">WesleyDodds</a> 00:47, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p><br />
OK... so Poison Ivy and the Joker both stating in the Batman Universe why the believe Batman and Wayne Enterprises to be villainous is not a credible source for a topic heading (near the homosexuality debate at the bottom of the page) and Wayne Enterprises can be called green and environmentnally sound despite (again depite Poison Ivy's points to the contrary) but these claims can not be edited out or countered by any sort of balance? Idealogical differences with other heroes can not even be used to secure this topics creation? The creation of other criminals is not a valid complaint against Wayn Enterprises (which must be presented as green and heroic)? Arms manufacturing and distribution can not be called morally dubious even though many verifiable people feel otherwise and it is actually one of the reasons that undoubtedly makes Lex Luthor a criminal? Why can only good things be said about Batman, Bruce Wayne, and Wayne Enterprises -- despite what people in and out of the fictional universe believe? I would appreciate it if each of these points was addressed (rather than pushed aside and dismissed out of hand) so that I can work towards keeping the section entitled "Batman as a villian" between the Batman villains section and the Homosexuality debate (which I see is now being dismantled as well).

<dd>"While changing morals have made the issue less important today, popular culture and a number of artists continue to play off the homosexual connotation of the Batman-Robin relationship against the wishes of the publisher.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> One notable example occurred in 2000, when <a href="../../../d/c/_/DC_Comics_9a75.html" title="DC Comics">DC Comics</a> refused to allow permission for the reprinting of four panels (from <i>Batman</i> issues 79, 92, 105 and 139) to illustrate Christopher York's paper <i>All in the family: Homophobia and Batman Comics in the 1950s</i><sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup> Another happened in the summer of 2005, when painter Mark Chamberlain displayed a number of watercolors depicting both Batman and Robin in suggestive poses.

<p>I have provided movie sources (which are allowed in the discussion elsewhere and in articles about other characters). They may need to be technically edited but the sources I did provide are real. What I am dealing with here is that only good things can be said about the "hero" despite contrary opinions from within the universe. And then good things are allowed to be said on the Wayne Enterprises page (like about the sound environmental practices) even though characters I cited (who and in which media souce) completely contradicted the wholesome goodness of Wayne Enterprises. As for such things like manufacturing hi-tech mlitary weaopons and distributing them, you can pretend that no one finds that morally dubious, but presumably that is the sort of thing that maks Lex Luthor a villain -- but because it's Batman and Wayne Enterprises it's ok (despite cited criticism from within and outside the univers). In the interest of thorough balance you would think that someone here would look at Batman imprtially and tell me what criticism of him I would be able to use from within his ficticious and from without (and I have indeed cited if you'll merely look in this discussion even).

<dd>Actually a tag has been placed on <a href="../../../w/a/y/Wayne_Enterprises_0222.html" title="Wayne Enterprises">Wayne Enterprises</a> asking editors to cite their sources since the article apparantly has none. Anyway, saying that because their info is uncited yours doesn't have to be cited hardly helps the acceptance of your interpretation. Second of all, many will say that the movies cannot and should not be used as sources unless the info in the movies are corroborated or derived from the official comics so at best you could put your info under Batman in other media. And last, you should try researching your interpretation. If you can find someone credible out there that has seen the same interpretations of characters and practices that you have, you would indeed have a source. <a href="../../../g/d/o/User%7EGdo01_992f.html" title="User:Gdo01">Gdo01</a> 19:41, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This is a complete red herring you've created here in the form of a straw man. I did not, in any way, suggest that my edits do not need to be cited since the greenwashing pro-Wayne side didn't cite theirs. I cited Poison Ivy (who is a militant environmentalist in the comic) from the movie Batman&amp;Robin as having criticized Wayne Enterprises destructive corporate practices. This criticsm was not allowed and my editing out the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greenwashing.html" title="Greenwashing">greenwashing</a> portion was restored on the Wayne Enterprises page. This is only one minor point but I think it illustrates the problem as a whole very nicely. Only nice things are allowed to be said about the "hero" Batman and any criticism or contrary views will be edited out. Nihilozero 19:53, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>It's been a few days and I replaced the Batman as villain section with several citations including one from someone who outed him as a corporate criminal guilty of insider trading. It may need to be cleaned up but several sources are cited.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Nihilzero (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Nihilzero_726f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Nihilzero">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<dd>Wow. I'm really struggling with assuming good intentions here. <a href="../../../s/d/f/User%7ESdfisher_d82c.html" title="User:Sdfisher">Steven Fisher</a> 21:06, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>That's exactly the point. Despite characters within his own fictional universe (including other heroes) drawing attention to his less than heoic activities, he is still only allowed to be presented, unquestionably, as a one-diminesional heroic character. Those things he does wrong are dismissed even when other characters are known as villains for for doing the same things. It's really about cultural indoctrination but wiki is supposed to present facts and not cultural bias. If you look at the history of the "Batman/Bruce Wayne as a villian" section you will see that it is heavily cited from comic books, the movies, the animated series, and others. In the interest of fairness and balance the section should be allowed to stay. In fact, others should help me restore it and keep it on the page even if they are a fan of Batman.

<p>Oh, well... you're obviously wrong. It's relevant because it deals with the complex character of "the Batman" about whom this page is written. It's certainly accurate as my citations prove. And who are you to determine what anyone elses interests are? Just because you are a fan of the pop culture presentation of Batman does not mean that comic book characters aren't complex characters who sometimes transcend the common ideas of good and evil.

<dd>I'd say the LARGE number of people who have reverted that "Batman as villain" section gives an indication of other people's interests?

<dd>In reply to the unsigned message Nihilozero left anonymously on my talk page: At the bottom of this page, there is an entire list of things wrong with the "Batman as villain" section. I don't give a damn if he's a hero or a villain, but that's a poorly written section drawing on inappropriate sources. This is not "what other editors are for" as you put it. Conscientious editors do not create messes for other people to clean up. And conscientious editors sign their posts on other people's talk pages. <a href="../../../w/r/y/User%7EWryspy_d7ae.html" title="User:Wryspy">Wryspy</a> 05:09, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You seem to be mistaking majority and popular opinion for fact -- which it is not. And the "obviously wrong" was in response to a particular point about anyONE. You people very often do not seem to care about accuracy, details or specifics. Maybe it's just when your hero is in question but perhaps you should recuse yourself if you can't be an impartial judge. Or maybe you're just taking issue with this because you see others have? I've dealt with the early complaints -- particularly in regard to citations and original research. I'll note that at least one editor, gdo01, has stated that the section would be ok. I take this editor as being impartial while most of the rest seem like fanboys. Nihilozero 06:07, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>How can ALL my heavily cited edits not be accurate or verifiable? You are not giving me any slack here! Has he ever been guilty of any sort of crime ever? Has anyone ever pointed out those crimes inside and outside of Batman's ficitonal universe? Your position seems to be that Batman is a hero period. But modern comic book characters are often complex with their criminal dark sides. I can admit that Batman has saved the day more than once -- but that does not mean I will only point out those times and omit from mention any of his crimes.

<p>Ok, let's look at this:</p>
<ul>
<li>"In the movie "Batman&amp;Robin" <a href="../../../p/o/i/Poison_Ivy_5e77.html" title="Poison Ivy">Poison Ivy</a> (a militant environmetnalist) gives a monologue about the destructive practices of Wayne Enterprises."</li>
</ul>
<p>Other media depiction, and the argument is being made by an insane supervillain. Her gripe is also specifically with Wayne Enterprises. it's not like Bruce Wayne ordered them to destroy the environment.</p>
<ul>
<li>"In a piece called "Bruce Wayne, Insider Trader?" Loren Steffy outs Bruce Wayne as a corporate criminal much like <a href="../../../l/e/x/Lex_Luthor_a258.html" title="Lex Luthor">Lex Luthor</a>. <a href="http://blogs.chron.com/lorensteffy/2005/06/" class="external free" title="http://blogs.chron.com/lorensteffy/2005/06/" rel="nofollow">http://blogs.chron.com/lorensteffy/2005/06/</a> "</li>
</ul>
<p>Fan interpretation on a blog. Not a credible source.</p>
<ul>
<li>"In issue #650 of Batman, the title character decides to kill the Red Hood in order to protect the Joker."</li>
</ul>
<p>Context please. Just because he decides to kill someone to protect a villain doesn't mean he is one.</p>
<ul>
<li>"In Batman: The Animated Series (in the episode "Beware the Creeper"), the joker recalls how Batman intentionally pushed him into the chemicals which caused his discoloration. Other characters like Clayface (in an episode of "The Batman" entitled Clayfaces) were created by coming into contact with Wayne Chemical's products or were former employees of Wayne Enterprises (such as, Mr.Freeze and Edward Nigmna).</li>
</ul>
<p>Once again, other media. Once again, having a gripe with Wayne Enterprises does not = Bruce Wayne is a villain</p>
<ul>
<li>"In the story arc of the "Batman/Superman" comic book entitled "Public Enemies," Batman steps aside to allow Superman to kill the president."</li>
</ul>
<p>Alternate timeline that was fixed. <a href="../../../w/e/s/User%7EWesleyDodds_17ee.html" title="User:WesleyDodds">WesleyDodds</a> 03:11, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Thank you for being a little more specific than most but here's why I think each point is valid:</p>
<ul>
<li>this segment is about Batman in general and other media representations are mentioned in the article. And the characters in all of the media forms are representing the character of Batman (w/Wayne, batmobile, etc.). As for Poison Ivy... even if she is an insane criminal (which is arguably a non-neutral POV) -- her complaints against Wayne and Wayne Enterprises are still metioned and it is hardly a stretch (even without Poison Ivy's cited testimony) to think that Wayne Oil and Wayne Chemicals are green a environmentally sound operations (as they are called in the Wayne Enterprises page). As head of the Corporation Bruce Wayne is responsible for the actions of Wayne Enterprises just as Lex Luthor is responsible for Lexcorp.</li>
<li>The cited blog was not a fan site it was simply an article by someone who broke down the crimes he observed Bruce Wayne Committing in the film Batman Begins (which should be a valid source for information about Batman).</li>
<li>His decision to kill the Red Hood is pure vigilanteism. And it goes against even his own claimed moral code.</li>
<li>Other media is elsewhere and should be allowed in describing Batman's character. And as stated, when his corporation is involved in so many industries and whne villians continuously are borne out of the labs (in one way or another) Wayne Enterprises and ultimately Bruce Wayne must be held responsible.</li>
<li>Here we are talking about comic books specifically, but you act is if this one doesn't count any more because of the Crisis series. But it did happen in the comic book and it was Batman and people still have those issues in which he is guilty of treason. As everyone knows, the crises never stop and any or all of the timelines could be ultimately real anyway.Nihilozero 04:02, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>This article is about the comic book character. When Daredevil killed a criminal in his movie, that did not make him a killer in the comic books. The movie's Ra's Al Ghul is not the same character as the comic book Ra's Al Ghul. I heard Denny O'Neill, creator of the character and writer of the <i>Batman Begins</i> novelization, say so himself. Batman in not a real person. You know that. Comic book Batman does not have to equal movie Batman in character.</li>
<li>We can't build an article that covers every single thing anyone has ever mentioned in its history.</li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Timeline of Batman?</span></h2>
<p>I've got some concerns about the recently added "Timeline of Batman".</p>
<ol>
<li>I'm not sure whether such a "timeline" of a fictional character (especially one whose history has been subject to as many revisions as Batman's) is encyclopedic.</li>
<li>I'm also worried that it might be <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>. It reads like something out of one of the <i>Secret Files and Origins</i> issues, but updated post-OYL.</li>
<li>It applies only to the current comics version of the character, while the rest of the entry refers to past versions and versions in other media. We all know that comics continuity is subject to constant revision according to editoral whim, and if DC is sticking to the interpretation that Batman began his career "10 years ago" it will also be subject to compression of more and more events in that ten years.</li>
</ol>

<dd>Perhaps it is unsourced, but then again, it might be true, right? Batman began at 24 (in Year One), then the remainder of that first year and Year Two follows into the Long Halloween. Batman Begins confirms this by showing him leaving at 17 or 18 and training for seven years, ending the film as 25 year old Batman becomes the guardian of Gotham. By the time Alberto Falcone is revealed to be Holiday, Batman must be around 26. Dark Victory is between year two and the early parts of Year Three. Dick Grayson <i>was</i> 12 when Batman took him in and trained him as Robin. By that point, Batman was 25 or 26 and into his third year of crime-fighting. Flash foward five years later in time, Dick leaves the role of Robin and becomes Nightwing, Jason Todd comes in as Robin and dies within the year. Shortly afterwards, enter 13-year old Tim Drake, and Knightfall begins with Batman nearly dying. A year later, No Man's Land takes place, when Tim is 14 going on 15. Batman: Hush takes place, with Jack Drake's death, the return of Jason Todd, and Tim turns 16 shortly before the Infinite Crisis. After the Battle of Metropolis, jump ahead one year later in time, Batman is 34/35, Tim is 17, and Dick is around 21/22. Besides, Batman is only early to mid thirties, so Batman began around ten years ago.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I think all this happened over a course of ten years, since they don't want Batman to age anywhere closer to 40. Plus, you want proof of Batman's age, check the website <a href="http://www.darkknight.ca/dknight.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.darkknight.ca/dknight.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. In the FAQS section, it confirms that he is around 34, giving he studied martial arts at 14 for six years, then returned to Gotham in his early twenties as Batman. Let's review now: Batman is NOT nearing 40, and the Ra's Al Ghul eternal youth story arc is coming up. Believe me, Bat-fans won't be worrying about him aging after this upcoming story. --<a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonathan.Bruce_9151.html" title="User:Jonathan.Bruce">Jonathan.Bruce</a> 12:34 4 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Besides which, the "facts" of any continuously published comic book character's chronology are, of necessity, going to be malleable and selectively followed, according to the editorial needs of the moment. If DC Comics pronounces tomorrow that Batman is 30, or 35, or 40, then everything else will be adjusted to accomodate the current editorial position. While it's fun for fans to come up with this sort of timeline, by its very nature and the fact that the comic is continuously advancing in time, such a timeline can <i>never</i> be definitive or encyclopedic.</dd>

<dd>Furthermore, the "proof" you're providing is questionable at best: I think the site you're linking to is just a fan site, with a fan's suppositions. Reasonable they may be, but they're still suppositions. And it's also odd to try to consolidate comics continuity with film continuity: the two are simply different narrative strands. (Were Thomas and Martha Wayne killed leaving <i>The Mark of Zorro</i> or <i>Die Fledermaus</i>? Was <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joe_Chill_74a5.html" title="Joe Chill">Joe Chill</a> killed on Carmine Falcone's orders, or by his own henchmen, or by the Reaper? And so forth.)</dd>

<dd>Well, <i>Batman Begins</i> had the Infinite Crisis (in a way) changed continuity to have Joe Chill arrested after the Waynes' murder and (supposedly) killed later. I mean, now the movie franchise is closer to the comics than ever before. The Joker as the one who killed Bruce's parents? Yes, that was a nice plot twist in Burton's film, but the fact that Batman never really confronted his parents' murder is something for which he can never get over. In <i>Begins</i>, all the immature, conflicted 18-year old Wayne wants at first is revenge, but after Chill dies, he realizes he wasted ten years of his life plotting of how to get Chill in vengeance. Then he goes to Europe for seven years and comes back as Batman. By the way, I wasn't spazzing out at you back there earlier. I apologize for any inconvience.</dd>
</dl>
<p>In addition, several writers and editors of Batman have agreed in the past that they will not try to age the character in any way (Frank Miller broke this rule, but <i>Dark Knight Returns</i> and <i>Dark Knight Strikes Again</i> are Elseworlds canon and not mainstream continuity). Look at Spider-Man, he's married to MJ and he's only early to mid twenties. He was 16 when he got his powers and not much has passed since then. The One Year Later storyline is the furthest Batman will be aging to 40. He's only 34-36 as of now, and if they feel he's getting old, the writers will just <a href="../../../r/e/t/Retcon.html" title="Retcon">retcon</a> any little detail. Come on, they've always done this, such as the Spoiler from dying thanks to Leslie Thompkins witholding treatment to "torture and pain from Black Mask," according to sources after Infinite Crisis. By the way, they should clear up this little dangling plot thread. Should they bring Dr. Thompkins back and have Batman forgive her? Will she expose who he is if he threatens to have her arrested? What was the real cause of death? Hopefully, this will be explained later on.</p>
<p>Anyways, look at Superman in Dark Knight Returns. He doesn't even look older, he looks like a thirty-something year old man in his prime. Supes will always be in his thirties, and same with Batman. So Chris Griswold, if you say that Batman has been around for 13 years, he must have been started around in his <i>early twenties</i> like 22 or 23, he must be 36, according to you. However, the whole team at DC Comics interprets Batman in his thirties, so that's about the jist of it.</p>

<dd>A some stage I had "TV Spin-Off"(20th Century Fox), which I liked &amp; felt was descriptive (initially, I admit, I removed Fox entirely, but in the spirit of co-operation I made a change to my view when it was reverted.</dd>
<dd>However, that isn't the issue here. The issue is that another party changed it to "Adam West as Batman" as part of a series of additions that fell apart, which, as stated previously is, I feel incorrect.</dd>

<p>I totally agree. This is about the character who originated in comic books but has since appeared in various other mediums with the same name, abilities, and general world. Unfortunately that would taint the pristine view of Batman that some of the fans who edit this page have. As it is they will not allow events that occurred in other timelines to be mentioned or any criticism of Batman by characters in the movies (even if this is consistent with characters in the comic book).Nihilozero 05:47, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I guess this joke never gets old for you as you've apparently used it before. It's very witty. Wow. Ha. Anyway... you never really addressed the point I was making which WAS and IS: The Batman page is about the character BATMAN who originated in comic books but has since appeared in other media with the same characteristics. Therefore... the other media representations of Batman OUGHT to be allowed as a source for information about the character on that characters page. Kittens. You're a funny guy.

<dd>Addressing your point: Batman is not a single entity. Batman the comic book character does not equal Batman the character from BTAS who does not equal the Batman from Super Friends. Each animated Batman is based on Batman the comic book character, but is not the same character. Differences can happen. The fact that Daredevil killed some bad guys in the Daredevil movie does not make the comic book character a killer. Denny O'Neil explicitly stated explicitly that the Ras al Ghul in <i>Batman Begins</i> was not the same character as the Ras he created in the comic book, although he thought the movie Ras was a great character too. A comic book depiction of George W. Bush saying nuke the Avengers does not mean that George W. Bush ever said to nuke the Avengers. The character basis does not equal the character, despite overwhelmingly obvious overlap. <a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoczilla_1c36.html" title="User:Doczilla">Doczilla</a> 06:57, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Present tense in "crossovers" section</span></h2>
<p>I didn't mean to suggest that "in-universe" meant "DC Universe". What I was referring to was odd sentences like "Batman's first intercompany crossover is with Marvel's <i>Hulk</i>." This sentence is really about the publishing history of the character, not his fictional history, and so should be in the past tense. Fiction exists in the "eternal present", but the publication of a specific comic book is an event at a fixed point in history, and so should be in the past tense: Batman's first intercompany crossover <i>was</i> with Marvel's <i>Hulk</i>, and in that story the two <i>fight</i> the Joker and the Shaper of Worlds. It's a bit difficult, since the paragraph shifts back and forth between speaking about the character as a property (real-world, past tense) and within a fictional context ("in-universe", present tense). Perhaps the "crossovers" section should be rewritten more thoroughly to put it all in an out-of-universe perspective? —<a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJosiah_Rowe_4f72.html" title="User:Josiah Rowe">Josiah Rowe</a> <small>(<a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJosiah_Rowe_ba00.html" title="User talk:Josiah Rowe">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Josiah_Rowe_5f31.html" title="Special:Contributions/Josiah Rowe">contribs</a>)</small> 18:21, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I still think that the first sentence needs to say "was"; fiction exists in the eternal present, but a comic published in 1981 exists in the past. Insofar as we're discussing the encounters between the characters, present tense is correct, but if we're discussing a publishing event, it's in the past.

<dd>Yes, as I recall it was a leftover from revert wars. I agree that the original statement is inappropriate, but I do think a conclusion of some sort should remain. Perhaps <b>As intended by most authors, Batman's sexuality is predominantly heterosexual. Homosexual readings of the texts are a product of non-canonical reader interpretations.</b>?

<dd>The second sentence is redundant and confuses the issue. You've already stated the authorial intent, so homosexuality in the characters is already indicated to be the result of reader response. Explicitly saying this sounds like the article is tring to say someting else - like, "this reading is obviously wrong", a POV and very contestable claim. "Canonical" is a fanboy phrase, and should be avoided wherever possible in encyclopaedic articles - what's worse, the Batwoman and Bat-Girl introduced to establish Batman and Robin as hterosexual characters an cited in the section, are not canon in the current DC universe (and the currently canon Batwoman is a lesbian)! It's especially bad when married with concepts of authorial intent is such a blanket way. The general consensus in academic circles is that reader response is more important than authorial intent; and also that all readings are biased (and it's no more biased to flatly ignore the authorial intent of Batman writers than it is to accept that intent). Few reader responses are unlikely to be based on every Batman story ever written, nor can we assume that the balance of authorial intent or textual evidence applies to every potrayal of a character which is written by so many different authors in different versions: Heterosexuality is not an archetypal facet of Batman's character, as it is in the case of, say, Superman because of the importance of his relationship with Lois Lane to any narrative of Superman, or James Bond because of the utilisation of women as his singular pleasure and weakness. (This could lead one to wonder why Batman's relationships, even his two marriages, have become an integral part of the Batman mythos.) Mentioning things like canon and reader interpretations opens up a whole can of worms. In an encyclopaedic article, I think no more needs to be said than the summation of the authorial intent as you've given it, and the second sentence should be ditched. 172.143.75.115 05:48, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't think the article needs to do anything more than document the incident involving Wetham and paranoia that DC was somehow trying to turn impressionable American youth gay, and DC's response to that, and something on the continuing issue (the reference to the two recent cases of DC refusing the use of pictures shows it's still alive and DC is still touchy about it, which is relevant to the article). Robin's costume is largely irrelevant, and the quotes from Alan Grant and George Clooney are ultimately just personal opinions. However, as this debates going, I'd say that it's been taken far too literally. A homosexual reading of Batman would not necessarily be that the character is gay within the fictional world of the story, but that the story is about homosexualiy on a thematic or allegorical level. We've only seen explicitly gay <a href="../../../x/-/m/X-Men_5b6b.html" title="X-Men">X-Men</a> in the past few years and most of the X-Men characters were clearly intended to be heterosexual. However, the reading of the X-Men story as being an allegory about homosexuality is fairly widespread and dates from the very start of the series. It's not a particularly wild leap to wonder if Batman, a story written in the 1930s-1950s about a man leading a double life, has a gay subtext. I personally wouldn't read it that way, but it's a perfectly valid reading and one common to a lot of stories from the period with that element of duality and hidden identities. 172.143.75.115 06:06, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The article is about BATMAN. He originated in the comic books but he has since moved to other media and, like other characters on other pages, those sources of information are valid -- so your first bullet point is invalidated (along with your second about the animated series).</p>
<ul>
<li>The origin of Clayface was cited and the Joker's statement about his origin was cited as well. Bullet point number three is thus invalid as well.</li>
<li>Bullet point four proves that he didn't even examine the cited link.</li>
<li>Specifically where did I insert "material from non-notable stories about the characters history"? I would be glad to correct any mistakes I may have made as I have done up until now and continue to do.</li>
<li>The POV instance you sight is not POV at all. In the cited issue Batman made a decision to kill.</li>
<li>Allowing Superman to kill the president may not be a clear case of treason. I'll grant you this point.</li>
<li>Spelling and misplaced links should be easily hand by any of the thousands of editors.

<p>I strongly think it should be noted in the article that he's known as the "Caped Crusader", and the "Dark Knight Detective". I don't care where, though I prefer the infobox. The trouble is that we should differentiate between these nom de plumes, and the true aliases of Matches Mallone, and Sir Hemmingford Gray. Btw, regarding the latter: I believe it's "Lord" (while it also <i>may</i> be "Sir"). This was the alias he used while recouperating in England (of an actual Lord who had been gone for some time in Africa) during Knightquest: the Search (which eventually resolved the Shondra Kinsolving sub-plots). - <a href="../../../j/c/3/User%7EJc37_cfd0.html" title="User:Jc37">jc37</a> 04:27, 4 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Since the divergence of the mainstream Batman and what came to be known as the Earth-Two is so profound (retirement, marriage, daughter, Police Commissioner, death, <i><a href="../../../a/m/e/America_vs._The_Justice_Society_4360.html" title="America vs. The Justice Society">America vs. The Justice Society</a></i>), I can see the point in having a separate article.

<p>Speaking of un-needed pages, I changed <a href="../../../b/r/u/Bruce_Wayne_68b8.html" title="Bruce Wayne">Bruce Wayne</a> to redirect here for a couple reasons. First, all the information is in this article. There's no big psyche split between Bruce and Batman. Bruce <b>is</b> Batman. Always has been, always will be (52 be damned!). While almost everyone can agree that Clark and Superman are almost separate identities from each other, this can't be said of Bruce/Batman, and we should keep the information together.

<p>The remark about "While it remains possible, through deconstruction and re-interpretation, to view these actions as a means by which Batman is deluding himself about his own homosexuality," seems a touch ridiculous, as, with that sort of prefacing, we could add such a rationale, not to mention awkward and possibly original research, to nearly any article that may include some ambiguous relationship between two males.

It took the normal Batlife and said went 'ergo he's gay!'. The first sentance of that paragraph says 'Bruce/Batman likes the chicks.' Second says 'But someone <i>could</i> read it as self-delusional actions of a closet homosexual.' and also 'And if you do read it that way, remember the authors say they didn't intend for Bats to be a fairy.'

<dd>The homosexual interpretations "debate" spans 8 paragraphs with 3 images? I am sorry am I naive? Am I missing something? When I first saw it I thought it was a vandalism joke. As is cited by many ceators, Batman is not written as gay. Every incarnation that I have ever read or viewed of Batman, from comics, cartoons, TV shows and movies, I have never interpreted the character to be gay, as cited Batman has been presented to be heterosexual. How does an anti-canon argument such as this justify so much discussion and space in the article? There may as well be big unique sections about Batman's influence on furry fandom or the theme of insomnia in Batman. Such topics which have so little relevance to what should been presented about Batman, they have about as much place in the article as the homosexual interpretations. This article is for facts about the Batman character, not the place for presenting debate or presenting arguments, pro or anti, on what is an irrelevant issue to what Batman is about.</dd>

Homosexual readings of the texts are the product of non-canonical reader interpretations.".
