<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/t/Talk%7EBattle_of_Sinhagad_487b.html" title="Edit section: Tanaji Malsure used a monitor lizard to climb up the fort wall">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Tanaji Malsure used a monitor lizard to climb up the fort wall</span></h2>
<p>One of the outstanding qualities of Shivaji was in making a correct estimation of men. He seldom made mistakes in the choice of his lieutenants. Among the men whom he selected as his lieutenants, two stand out; they were Baji Prabhu and Tanaji Malsure.</p>
<p>Baji Prabhu gave his life in order to save Shivaji in the famous battle of Rangana Ghat; he did this in order to give Shivaji time to retreat. He lost his life in the engagement but his was the death of a hero. His heroic stand is rightly compared to the famous battle of Thermopylae.</p>
<p>Tanaji Malsure has also achieved legendary fame; this man from the Konkan was among Shivaji's earliest companions. He was not a military genius but was a lion-hearted man. He was his master's inseparable companion and confidant. His personal courage, his integrity and resourcefulness in the face of danger were in themselves the best recommendation for his close companionship with Shivaji.</p>
<p>Tanaji's name has become memorable not because of his closeness to Shivaji, but because he gave his life in circumstances which were both tragic and grand. Even today the Ballad of Sinhagad is sung in every home in Maharashtra.</p>
<p>Sinhagad or Kondhana, as it was originally called, is situated on the eastern side of the great Sahayadri range and is twelve miles from Poona. It communicates with the Purandhar hill on the east and west by very high, narrow ridges, while on the north and south it presents a huge rugged mountain with a very steep ascent of nearly half a mile. From the slope rises a great wall of black rock more than forty feet high, crowned by fortifications of Sinhagad. The fortifications consist of a strong stonewall flanked with towers and enclose a nearly triangular space about two miles round. The exterior presents on all sides a stupendous barrier so that, except by the gates, access to the fort is almost impossible.</p>
<p>It was this fort of singular strength that Tanaji was commissioned to capture. It had been surrendered to the Moghuls and was now under the command of a very able Rajput soldier, Udai Bhan, who guarded it with a picked body of troops. The loss of Sinhagad, the pride of Maharashtra, had made Shivaji's spirited mother disconsolate. She feared that the tender plant of Swaraj reared by her son would not grow in safety unless the fort was wrested from the Moghuls. One morning, while Jijabai was combing her hair, she suddenly saw through the window of her palace the Lion's fort. The poignant thought that the fort did not belong to her son made her unhappy.</p>
<p>"Ride to Rajgad" she ordered her servant, "and bring my son to me". Shivaji responded to her summons, though puzzled by its peremptoriness. When he came, Jijabai lured him artfully to a game of chess, which he lost. She demanded the restoration of Sinhagad to Maharashtra as a reward for her victory. Shivaji was amazed and disheartened at this request. In vain, did he plead with his mother that the fort was being manned by one of the ablest generals in India. But the queen mother was adamant. Shivaji could not ignore her behest. The adventure of capturing the fort, he knew, was hazardous in the extreme. He thought deeply over his dilemma and finally resolved to put his favourite Tanaji on the mission. He alone, among the brave barons could fulfil the heart's desire of the Queen Mother. Had he not performed in the past prodigies of valour? With the blessings of Goddess Bhavani and Jijabai, this devoted servant of Swaraj might achieve even the impossible.</p>
<p>An order was accordingly sent to Umrathe in Konkan, where Tanaji lived, asking him to hasten to Rajgad with his armed retainers. Although he was preparing for his son's wedding, he hastened to go and his men rode post-haste to Rajgad and presented themselves before the great chief. Shivaji cordially received him and took him to his mother by whom the summons had been sent. Tanaji learnt of his mission from Jijabai and then set off for his prey. He was accompanied by one thousand seasoned Mavlis. They secretly assembled at the foot of the fort for the escalade. It was a clear, moonless night, the ninth of the dark fortnight of the month of Magh, and it was cold and still. Choosing the sheer southwest gorge, as the part least likely to be guarded, Tanaji tied a cord to the waist of Shivaji's famous Ghorpad, Yeshwanti, and bade it run up the cliff. The creature fled to the top and there fixing its talons firmly in the heath, helped the Mavlis to clamber up the cliff. Hardly had three hundred men entered the fort, when something caused a commotion, which drew the atentionof, the sentries to the quarter where the Marathas were ascending. The sentries were killed, but not before the garrison had been roused. Seven hundred of Tanaji's soldiers were still below, while in the fort there were one thousand veteran fighters, consisting of Arabs, Afghans, Rajputs and Pathans. Tanaji gave the order to charge. Thoough overwhelmed by numbers, the Marathas fought with desperate valour and in the melee that ensued their leader fell. It is said that Chandravally, the manslaying elephant charged at Tanaji who jumped on its back and chopped off its trunk with his sword, reducing it to a lump of bleeding clay. Then came Udai Bhan's twelve sons who fell upon him. The valiant Maratha killed them all with terrific blows of his ruthless sword.</p>
<p>As everything seemed lost, Udai Bhan rushed to the battlefield, leaving his wine cups and the embraces of his winsome ladies. The result was a fierce encounter between the two great swordsmen. It seemed as if lightning was flashing and thunder clouds were roaring; finally the blow came and Tanaji Malasure the Lion fell cloven to the waist.</p>
<p>The death of their leader unnerved the Marathas who began to retreat, but before all was lost Tanaji's brother appeared on the scene with his reserves. He rallied them and shouting their war cry, "Har Har Mahadev", fell upon the enemy with renewed energy. Their attack was irresistible and the garrison was routed and several hundreds to save themselves from the fury of the invaders ventured over the rock and were dashed to pieces in the attempt. Udai Bhan the mighty Rajput warrior was also slain in the battle.</p>
<p>It was a great victory for the Marathas but there was no elation in the camp. Shivaji came to congratulate his comrade and as he rode through the Kalyan Gate, he beheld seated on the cot the corpse of his faithful Tanaji. His grief was tremendous. He refused to be felicitated and exclaimed: "I have got the fort but I have lost the lion".</p>
<p>Thus ended the career of a man whose single-minded devotion to duty, whose unswerving loyalty to his friend and master and whose undaunted courage will always stand out as a conspicuous example for his countrymen to emulate. Sinhagad is now in ruins but the glorious episode of Tanaji's victory in death will remain imperishable. The National Defence Academy is situated in the vicinity of this area. Let the cadets of NDA draw their inspiration from the hallowed memory of this great soldier of India.</p>
