<p><b>Battlecruisers</b> were large <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warships.html" title="Warships">warships</a> of the first half of the 20th century first introduced by the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">British</a> <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Navy_80f7.html" title="Royal Navy">Royal Navy</a>. They evolved from <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armored_cruiser.html" title="Armored cruiser">armoured cruisers</a> and in terms of ship classification they occupy a grey area between <a href="../../../c/r/u/Cruiser.html" title="Cruiser">cruisers</a> and <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battleship.html" title="Battleship">battleships</a>. Generally, battlecruisers were similar in layout and armament to battleships but with significantly less <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armour.html" title="Armour">armour</a> allowing for gains in speed.</p>
<p>Although technical specifications varied, all battlecruisers shared a similar role specification. They were designed to hunt down and outgun smaller warships (or merchant ships in the case of the <a href="../../../p/o/c/Pocket_battleship.html" title="Pocket battleship">pocket battleships</a>), and outrun larger warships that they could not outgun.</p>
<p>Originally, to achieve this, they deviated from the standard practice of providing a ship with sufficient armour to protect against its own guns. The weight saving from the reduced armour allowed more powerful engines to be fitted. This idea was mainly conceived by British <a href="../../../a/d/m/Admiral.html" title="Admiral">Admiral</a> <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Fisher%2C_1st_Baron_Fisher_4d94.html" title="John Fisher, 1st Baron Fisher">Jackie Fisher</a> who believed "speed is the best protection". Fisher's idea centred on battlecruisers operating with the fleet, the intention being that they would hunt down enemy cruiser squadrons and evade the battleships. Germany's navy by contrast sacrificed gun <a href="../../../c/a/l/Caliber.html" title="Caliber">calibre</a> instead of armour in order to raise speed. Despite the major difference in design philosophy, both performed the same task.</p>
<p>Battlecruisers were superseded by the beginning <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a> as advances in design and technology allowed <a href="../../../f/a/s/Fast_battleships.html" title="Fast battleships">fast battleships</a> to be developed, which combined or even exceeded the best features of <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_I_9429.html" title="World War I">World War I</a> battlecruisers and slow battleships.</p>

</div>
<p>The battlecruiser was the brainchild of First Sea Lord, <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jackie_Fisher_ea69.html" title="Jackie Fisher">Sir Jackie Fisher</a> of the Royal Navy. The navy of <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victorian_era.html" title="Victorian era">Victorian</a> Britain was a massive, inefficient and, above all, expensive edifice. Driven to improve and reform the Navy, and compelled to reduce its cost, Fisher paid off the veritable host of small or old warships the Royal Navy stationed around the world for the purpose of Imperial defence, and importantly closed many of the expensive network of bases where these ships had been based.</p>
<p>In their stead Fisher envisaged a new type of large, fast warship. Operating in "flying squadrons" and under centralised control via the new technology of radio, they would be able to cruise at high speeds and therefore could be redeployed across entire oceans so that a single squadron could perform the role of perhaps a dozen existing warships. Although such vessels would be individually expensive, fewer would be needed so overall they would cost far less to build and operate than the multiplicity of <a href="../../../p/r/e/Pre-dreadnought_battleship.html" title="Pre-dreadnought battleship">pre-dreadnought battleships</a> employed at the time. However, in order to be a credible threat wherever they went Fisher's new ships needed to be able to threaten any likely opponent, as such they were to be fitted with the most powerful guns available allied with recent advances in naval gunnery, which would enable them to fight at extreme ranges. Fisher foresaw a variety of roles for his new type of warship including commerce raiding, the protection of Britain's trade routes and scouting for the conventional battle fleet. However, he never intended them to be deployed as part of the main Line of Battle.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/t/Battlecruiser.html" title="Edit section: The British Designs">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The British Designs</span></h3>
<p>The design of the first battlecruiser was entrusted to the same committee that produced the <a href="../../../h/m/s/HMS_Dreadnought_%281906%29_114f.html" title="HMS Dreadnought (1906)"><i>Dreadnought</i></a>. Compared to the most recent of the RN's cruisers they were quite different. They had a displacement similar to that of the <i>Dreadnought</i> but twice the power to give a speed of 25 knots. They had 12 inch guns like a contemporary battleship, but achieved speed at the expense of protection. They had armour 6 or 7 inches (150 to 180 mm) thick along the side of the hull and over the gunhouses, whereas a comparable battleship of the period had armour 11 or 12 inches (280 to 300 mm) thick. These ships completed with the most modern <a href="../../../f/i/r/Fire_control_system.html" title="Fire control system">fire control equipment</a> available at the time, and in this respect represented a great advance over ships completed only a few years earlier. The full advantages of centralised fire control would not be realised for some years, and the <i>Invincible</i> class ships were eventually fitted with director firing in the months before <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Jutland_e65a.html" title="Battle of Jutland">Jutland</a>.</p>
<p>The new vessels were named <a href="../../../h/m/s/HMS_Inflexible_%281908%29_1d05.html" title="HMS Inflexible (1908)"><i>Inflexible</i></a>, <a href="../../../h/m/s/HMS_Invincible_%281908%29_0d5b.html" title="HMS Invincible (1908)"><i>Invincible</i></a> and <a href="../../../h/m/s/HMS_Indomitable_%281907%29_aa09.html" title="HMS Indomitable (1907)"><i>Indomitable</i></a>, all completed in <a href="../../../1/9/0/1908.html" title="1908">1908</a>. Originally thought of as simply a new type of armoured cruiser (their armour was the same as that of the older armoured cruisers'), they were originally designated "dreadnought cruisers". However, a tendency to think of them as somehow partially equal to a battleship led to the unofficial title "battleship cruisers" which led to the adoption of the term "battlecruiser" in 1912.</p>

</div>
<p>Having ordered three of the new "Dreadnought Armoured Cruisers" in the 1905-6 programme, the Royal Navy, faced by tight naval budgets under the new Liberal Government, considered but declined to build any in the 1906-7 and 1907-8 programmes, favouring battleships proper for those years. A single "battlecruiser" was built under the 1908-9 programme, the <a href="../../../h/m/s/HMS_Indefatigable_%281909%29_e791.html" title="HMS Indefatigable (1909)"><i>Indefatigable</i></a>, which represented only a minor increase in size, and detail improvement over the Invincible. The following ships of the <a href="../../../l/i/o/Lion_class_battlecruiser.html" title="Lion class battlecruiser"><i>Lion</i> class</a> built in the 1909-10 programme represented a major increase in size, cost, speed, fire power and protection over the 12-inch ships, although the ships were still "unbalanced" in that the protection was inadequate to resist their own guns. Two Lion class ships were built in the 1909-10 programme, the second ship ordered under a blaze of journalistic, parliamentary and general public uproar generally known as the "we want eight" campaign, a desire to see eight large armoured ships authorized in the 1909-10 programme in response to fears of <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germany.html" title="Germany">German</a> naval ambitions. A slightly modified third vessel of the <i>Lion</i> class was ordered for the 1910-11 programme and <a href="../../../h/m/s/HMS_Tiger_%281913%29_65ad.html" title="HMS Tiger (1913)"><i>HMS Tiger</i></a> was built to a significantly revised, larger and faster design still under the 1911-12 programme. She was the last pre war battlecruiser of the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Navy_80f7.html" title="Royal Navy">Royal Navy</a> as the 1912, 1913 and the largely un-built 1914 programme did not include any battlecruisers, an oversight offset to some extent by the admirable qualities of the <a href="../../../q/u/e/Queen_Elizabeth_class_battleship_916f.html" title="Queen Elizabeth class battleship"><i>Queen Elizabeth</i> class</a> of the 1912-13 programme, and intended to be repeated under the 1914-15 programme that was suspended on the outbreak of war.</p>
<p>With the return of Fisher to the Admiralty early in WWI, and the early success of the battlecruisers in the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_the_Falkland_Islands_f58b.html" title="Battle of the Falkland Islands">Battle of the Falkland Islands</a>, Fisher gained permission from cabinet to complete two new battlecruisers, using some of the equipment and armament intended for the suspended battleships of the <a href="../../../r/e/v/Revenge_class_battleship.html" title="Revenge class battleship"><i>Revenge</i> class</a> from the 1914 programme. The result was the <a href="../../../r/e/n/Renown_class_battlecruiser.html" title="Renown class battlecruiser"><i>Renown</i> class</a>, ships combining high speed, six 15 inch guns but very thin six inch armour. Aside from these ships, and in line with Fisher's plans for operations in the <a href="../../../b/a/l/Baltic_Sea_a4f2.html" title="Baltic Sea">Baltic Sea</a> three "large light cruisers" - big ships (22,000 tons and some 750 ft long) with even less protection than the battlecruisers but carrying a few battleship calibre guns were ordered, Fisher stretching the truth in this case because he had authority to order ships up to the size of light cruiser but no further capital ships. In the event, the planned Baltic operations never materialised and the three "large light cruisers" laid down <a href="../../../h/m/s/HMS_Furious_%281916%29_3d7b.html" title="HMS Furious (1916)">HMS <i>Furious</i></a> (the 18-inch gun design), <a href="../../../h/m/s/HMS_Glorious_%2877%29_da7d.html" title="HMS Glorious (77)"><i>Glorious</i></a> and <a href="../../../h/m/s/HMS_Courageous_%2850%29_b8e3.html" title="HMS Courageous (50)"><i>Courageous</i></a> (each two twin 15-inch) found use elsewhere as <a href="../../../a/i/r/Aircraft_carrier.html" title="Aircraft carrier">aircraft carriers</a>.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/t/Battlecruiser.html" title="Edit section: The German Response">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The German Response</span></h3>
<p>The launch of HMS <i>Invincible</i> made all armoured cruisers afloat obsolete at a stroke, so it was inevitable that Britain's naval rivals would respond by building battlecruisers of their own. The Germans were the first to respond with the <a href="../../../s/m/s/SMS_Bl%C3%BCcher_a028.html" title="SMS Blücher"><i>Blücher</i></a>. Completed in 1909, armed with twelve 8.2 inch guns and capable of 25 knots, she had been laid down in response to inaccurate reports about the construction of the <i>Invincibles</i>, and in particular in the mistaken belief that the latter would only be carrying guns of 9.2 inch calibre. Although the Blücher was a fine ship by armoured cruiser standards, she was obsolete before she was completed and was destroyed by British battlecruisers at the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Dogger_Bank_%281915%29_dc26.html" title="Battle of Dogger Bank (1915)">Battle of Dogger Bank</a> in 1915.

<p>German design philosophy was dramatically different to that of the British. As early as 1906 Korvettenkapitän Vollerthun, an official representative of the RMA (<i>Reichsmarineamt</i>, the German Naval Office), had published a paper predicting that the armoured cruiser and battleship would merge into a single distinct type, effectively pre-empting the "fast battleship" by 30 years. Although the Germans called their battlecruisers <i>Große Kreuzer</i> (large cruisers) what the RMA was actually trying to build were small, fast battleships. The Germans had no global obligations to defend and, as such, all their warships were designed for a probable clash of arms in the <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_Sea_f231.html" title="North Sea">North Sea</a>. With this in mind, the primary role for the German battlecruiser force was to function as fleet scouts and a distinct fast division of the battlefleet, so the Germans placed combat power (in terms of both armament and protection) ahead of all other considerations when designing their battlecruisers.</p>
<p>German battlecruisers were expected to fight alongside the battleships once the enemy fleet was met and as such were armoured sufficiently to withstand heavy gunfire. Requiring neither the crew accommodation nor fuel bunkerage for long range cruises, the German designers were able to devote a greater proportion of the vessels tonnage to armour. To further this advantage, a great deal of attention was paid to saving weight in the machinery and fittings of the ships. Measures ranged from the adoption of small-bore <a href="../../../w/a/t/Water-tube_boiler.html" title="Water-tube boiler">water-tube boilers</a> which gave a better power to weight ratio, right down to the piano in the Officer's mess being made from aluminium. The vessels also benefited from the wider dockyards that they were built in, allowing them to be built with a broader beam and greater internal subdivision than the British battlecruisers. The <i>Von der Tann</i> was protected by a 10 inch thick armoured belt, carried eight 11 inch guns and could cruise at 26 knots, but her operational range was short as she possessed only the most rudimentary accommodation for her crew.</p>
<p>Overall the Germans emphasised speed and protection compared to the British emphasis on speed and firepower. Indeed, Korvettenkapitan Vollerthun described their battlecruisers as <i>Kreuzer-Schlachtschiffe</i> ("cruiser-battleships") thus neatly defining the different design priorities of the German designs over the British "battleship-cruisers". Most German battlecruisers were armed with 11 inch guns, even as the Royal Navy adopted the 13.5 inch gun, on the basis that it was more than adequate against any likely opponent and the Germans only adopted larger guns in the battlecruiser fleet with the launch of the <a href="../../../s/m/s/SMS_Derfflinger_3d0f.html" title="SMS Derfflinger"><i>Derfflingers</i></a> in 1913. The cumulation of pre-war German battlecruiser development, the <i>Derfflinger</i> class ships were 28,000 ton ships capable of 29 knots, armed with eight 12 inch guns and protected by a 12 inch armoured belt. They were handsome ships as well as being very effective and Gary Staff, Naval Historian and author, considers these ships the most effective battlecruisers of World War I.</p>
<p>Further evolution of the <i>Derfflinger</i> design resulting in the laying down of the 30,000 ton <i><a href="../../../m/a/c/Mackensen_class_battlecruiser.html" title="Mackensen class battlecruiser">Mackensen</a></i> and so called <i>Ersatz Yorck</i> class battlecruisers - enlarged <i>Derfflingers</i> with eight 14 and 15 inch guns respectively. Although all four of the <i>Mackensens</i> were laid down and three were launched, none were completed before the end of the war. They would have been roughly equivalent to the British <i>Renowns</i> in terms of speed and firepower, although much better protected.</p>

<p>In the years immediately preceding the First World War several nations including France, the United States, <a href="../../../a/u/s/Austria-Hungary_d732.html" title="Austria-Hungary">Austria-Hungary</a> and Spain began to draw up designs for new classes of battlecruiser. However, only two got as far as actually laying down ships. The Japanese received their first battlecruiser in 1913 with the commissioning of the <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japanese_battleship_Kong%C5%8D_f098.html" title="Japanese battleship Kongō"><i>Kongō</i></a>. Designed and built in England by the Vickers yard, the design of the <i>Kongō</i> was so advanced the Royal Navy redesigned <i>HMS Tiger</i> to a new configuration very similar to that of the Japanese ship. The four ships of the <a href="../../../k/o/n/Kong%C5%8D_class_battlecruiser.html" title="Kongō class battlecruiser">Kongō class</a> were the first vessels to mount 14 inch guns (of which they had eight) and were capable of 28 knots, but were armoured in accordance with British practice and their armoured belt was only 8 inches thick at its widest point.</p>
<p>The Russians laid down the four ships of the <a href="../../../b/o/r/Borodino_class_battlecruiser.html" title="Borodino class battlecruiser">Borodino</a> class (sometimes known as the Izmail class) in 1913. Unable to build powerful enough turbines themselves, they instead purchased machinery from Germany. However, the outbreak of war halted construction and although all the hulls had been launched by 1917, there was no chance of them being completed without machinery. Had they been completed the <i>Borodinos</i> would have been large and impressive vessels, armed with 12 14 inch guns and protected by an armoured belt as much as 12 inches thick. However, post-revolutionary Russia had no use for them and the hulls were cut up for scrap during the 20's.</p>

<p>Although not a naval battle in the traditional sense, the German battlecruiser <i>Goeben</i> and her escort, the light cruiser <i>Breslau</i>, managed to escape the French and British Mediterranean fleets and sail to Constantinople, where their arrival directly caused the Turks to enter the war alliance with the Central powers.

<p>During the Battle of Dogger Bank, the after turret of the German flagship <a href="../../../s/m/s/SMS_Seydlitz_abf3.html" title="SMS Seydlitz"><i>Seydlitz</i></a> was pierced by a British 13.5&#160;inch shell which detonated in the working chamber. The charges being hoisted upwards were detonated, and the explosion flashed up into the turret and down into the magazine, setting fire to charges in the process of being handled. The gun crew tried to escape into the next turret, allowing the flash to spread, destroying both turrets internally. <i>Seydlitz</i> was saved from near-certain destruction only by emergency flooding of her after magazines. This near-disaster was due to the way that ammunition handling was arranged and was common to both German and British battleships and battlecruisers, but the lighter protection on the latter made them more vulnerable to the turret or barbette being pierced. The "working chamber" had been introduced in <a href="../../../h/m/s/HMS_Formidable_%281898%29_a84b.html" title="HMS Formidable (1898)">HMS <i>Formidable</i></a> (1898) and was intended to prevent such a dangerous flash, but instead made such an event more likely. The Germans learned from investigating the damaged <i>Seydlitz</i> and instituted improved measures to ensure ammunition handling was flash tight.

<p>At the Battle of Jutland 18 months later, both British and German battlecruisers were employed as fleet units. The British battlecruisers became engaged with both their German counterparts, the battlecruisers, and then German battleships before the arrival of the battleships of the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Grand_Fleet_9508.html" title="British Grand Fleet">British Grand Fleet</a>. The result was a disaster for the Royal Navy's battlecruiser squadrons: <a href="../../../h/m/s/HMS_Invincible_%281907%29_258c.html" title="HMS Invincible (1907)"><i>Invincible</i></a>, <a href="../../../h/m/s/HMS_Queen_Mary_5b88.html" title="HMS Queen Mary"><i>Queen Mary</i></a> and <a href="../../../h/m/s/HMS_Indefatigable_%281909%29_e791.html" title="HMS Indefatigable (1909)"><i>Indefatigable</i></a> exploded with the loss of all but a handful of their crews. This was due to the vulnerability of the working chamber which the Germans had discovered after the near-loss of <i>Seydlitz</i> at Dogger Bank and had taken preventative measures against. The lightly armoured British ships did not have flash tight ammunition handling arrangements and each was lost to a single salvo penetrating the working chamber. The better armoured and flash tight German battlecruisers fared better, in part due to poor performance of British fuzes (with failure to explode behind armour). Nevertheless, <a href="../../../s/m/s/SMS_L%C3%BCtzow_6c4d.html" title="SMS Lützow"><i>Lützow</i></a> was fatally damaged after receiving more than thirty hits and had to be scuttled, although the crew saved 117 dead by enemy fire before she went down.

<p>Following the end of World War I many navies re-evaluated their ship designs.

Generally speaking it was felt that the German "Cruiser-battleship" concept had been vindicated and accordingly most navies preferred to develop Fast Battleships rather than follow Fisher's original "Super Cruiser" concept.</p>

<p>Although the Royal Navy had no plans to increase the size of her battlecruiser fleet after WWI, when the US and Japanese Navy laid down their <a href="../../../l/e/x/Lexington_class_battle_cruiser.html" title="Lexington class battle cruiser"><i>Lexington</i></a> and <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japanese_aircraft_carrier_Akagi_4419.html" title="Japanese aircraft carrier Akagi"><i>Akagi</i></a> class battlecruisers, both of which would have outclassed HMS <i>Hood</i>, the Royal Navy felt compelled to respond and as part of their new warship building programme the British ordered four 48,000 ton <a href="../../../g/3/_/G3_battlecruiser.html" title="G3 battlecruiser">G3 battlecruisers</a>. Owing little to British wartime designs, these ambitious vessels would have been superior to any battlecruiser afloat, or indeed under construction, at the time. In fact, in terms of their blend of firepower, speed and protection the G3 design would remain unmatched until the launch of the similarly sized US Navy <a href="../../../i/o/w/Iowa_class_battleship.html" title="Iowa class battleship"><i>Iowa</i></a> class fast battleships 20 years later. Had they been completed the G3's would actually have been immense fast battleships and the battlecruiser name came from their high speed and armour relative to the planned <a href="../../../n/3/_/N3_battleship.html" title="N3 battleship">N3 battleships</a> they would serve alongside. In event both the G3 and N3 designs were cancelled by the Washington Treaty in 1922 before being laid down, probably to the relief of the Treasury as they would undoubtedly have proven vastly expensive to construct.</p>
<p>When the Washington treaty ended, like most nations the British concentrated on developing new classes of fast battleship. The Royal Navy would never again design or construct a battlecruiser.</p>

<p>Unable to pursue new construction, the <a href="../../../i/m/p/Imperial_Japanese_Navy_75b5.html" title="Imperial Japanese Navy">Imperial Japanese Navy</a> instead chose to improve their existing battlecruisers of the <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japanese_battleship_Kong%C5%8D_f098.html" title="Japanese battleship Kongō"><i>Kongō</i> class</a> (<a href="../../../j/a/p/Japanese_battleship_Hiei_3102.html" title="Japanese battleship Hiei"><i>Hiei</i></a>, <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japanese_battleship_Haruna_e769.html" title="Japanese battleship Haruna"><i>Haruna</i></a>, <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japanese_battleship_Kirishima_35a3.html" title="Japanese battleship Kirishima"><i>Kirishima</i></a> and <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japanese_battleship_Kong%C5%8D_f098.html" title="Japanese battleship Kongō"><i>Kongō</i></a>) by increasing the elevation of the guns to 40 degrees, adding anti-torpedo bulges and additional armour, and building on a "pagoda" mast. The 3,800 tons of additional armour slowed their speed, but between 1933 and 1940 replacement of heavy equipment and an increase in the length of the hull by 26 ft (8 m) allowed them to reach up to 30 knots once again. They were reclassified as "fast battleships", although their armour and guns still fell short compared to surviving World War I-era battleships in American or British navies.</p>

<p>The <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Navy_d2ed.html" title="United States Navy">United States Navy</a> re-tasked two battlecruiser hulls as aircraft carriers: <a href="../../../u/s/s/USS_Lexington_%28CV-2%29_4ae4.html" title="USS Lexington (CV-2)">USS <i>Lexington</i></a> and <a href="../../../u/s/s/USS_Saratoga_%28CV-3%29_29cf.html" title="USS Saratoga (CV-3)"><i>Saratoga</i></a> were both designed as battlecruisers (the hull designations were originally CC-1 and CC-3) but converted part-way through construction, although this was only considered marginally preferable to scrapping the hulls outright (the remaining four: <i>Constellation</i>, <i>Ranger</i>, <i>Constitution</i> and <i>United States</i> were indeed scrapped).</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../l/e/x/Lexington_class_battle_cruiser.html" title="Lexington class battle cruiser"><i>Lexington</i></a> class battlecruisers, if completed as planned, would have been exceptionally fast and well armed, but would have carried armour little better than that of the very first battlecruisers. With that in mind they represented the ultimate evolution of the original "super-cruiser" concept, rather than being hybrid fast battleships like <i>HMS Hood</i> or the Japanese <i>Amagis</i>.</p>
<p>They were planned to be armed with eight 16" guns in four turrets but were only protected with a seven inch armoured belt, proof against cruiser sized weapons but completely inadequate against any weapon likely to be carried by a rival battleship or battlecruiser. However, the engines required to propel these vessels at 33 knots (their design speed) made them into fast, flexible aircraft carriers with large growth margins.</p>

<p>As war became more likely nations began to rebuild their forces.

Most nations preferred to build fast battleships but Germany, Italy, France and Russia all designed new battlecruisers. Even so, most of these vessels were considerably better protected than their First World War counterparts and several were arguably genuine fast battleships. Ultimately the Italians chose to upgrade their old battleships rather than build new battlecruisers, whereas the Russians laid down the 35,000 ton <i>Kronshtadt</i> Class, but were unable to launch them before the Germans invaded in 1941 and captured the hulls. Only Germany and France actually completed any vessels.</p>

<p>The German <a href="../../../p/o/c/Pocket_battleships.html" title="Pocket battleships">pocket battleships</a> (German:<i>Panzerschiffe</i> - <i>armored ship</i>: <a href="../../../g/e/r/German_battleship_Deutschland_9311.html" title="German battleship Deutschland"><i>Deutschland</i></a>, <a href="../../../g/e/r/German_battleship_Admiral_Scheer_af5f.html" title="German battleship Admiral Scheer"><i>Admiral Scheer</i></a>, and <a href="../../../g/e/r/German_battleship_Admiral_Graf_Spee_7c50.html" title="German battleship Admiral Graf Spee"><i>Admiral Graf Spee</i></a>), built to meet the 10,000 ton <a href="../../../d/i/s/Displacement_%28fluid%29.html" title="Displacement (fluid)">displacement</a> limit of the <a href="../../../t/r/e/Treaty_of_Versailles_58e2.html" title="Treaty of Versailles">Treaty of Versailles</a>, were another attempt at a cruiser-battleship concept. Rather than construct a lightweight battleship which sacrificed protection in order to attain high speed, the pocket battleships were relatively small vessels with only six 11 inch (280&#160;mm) guns — essentially large <a href="../../../h/e/a/Heavy_cruiser.html" title="Heavy cruiser">heavy cruisers</a>. They attained fairly high speeds of 26 knots (52&#160;km/h), and reasonable protection, while (allegedly!) staying close to the displacement limit, by using welded rather than riveted construction, triple main armament <a href="../../../g/u/n/Gun_turret.html" title="Gun turret">turrets</a>, and replacing the normal <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steam_turbine.html" title="Steam turbine">steam turbine</a> power with a pair of massive 9 cylinder <a href="../../../d/i/e/Diesel_engine.html" title="Diesel engine">diesel engines</a> driving each propeller shaft (an ironic reversion from turbine to reciprocating engines). They were later reclassified as "heavy cruisers", having heavier guns and armour than regular heavy cruisers at the cost of speed. Unfortunately, they were outclassed by British WW1-era true battlecruisers in speed, weaponry, and protection. (They in fact had basic cruiser armour, except for the turrets.)</p>
<p>Two more ships were built later in the 1930s, the <a href="../../../g/e/r/German_battlecruiser_Scharnhorst_aec3.html" title="German battlecruiser Scharnhorst"><i>Scharnhorst</i></a> and <a href="../../../g/e/r/German_battlecruiser_Gneisenau_3c14.html" title="German battlecruiser Gneisenau"><i>Gneisenau</i></a>, which were considerably more powerful. At 38,900 tons full load they were somewhat larger than the French <i>Dunkerque</i> class and very well armoured. As built, they had three triple 11-inch gun turrets, but the mounts were designed to accept twin 15-inch turrets (six guns total) when enough became available. However, circumstances and the fates of the two ships - <i>Scharnhorst</i> sunk by gunfire, <i>Gneisenau</i> heavily damaged by bombs and her repair sacrificed to higher priorities - meant that this plan was abandoned. At the time, treaty requirements allowed the production of 12+ inch guns at 1 a year, which along with the very time consuming production of naval guns, kept these two ships with 11-inch guns. The Royal Navy categorised them as battlecruisers since they followed the Imperial German Navy design lineage of trading off gun size for protection and speed. The German Navy nonetheless categorised them as battleships.</p>

<p>As a response to the German pocket battleships the French decided to build the <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_battleship_Dunkerque_a4bd.html" title="French battleship Dunkerque"><i>Dunkerque</i> class</a> in the 1930s. They were labelled "fast battleships" and were armed with 13 inch (330mm) guns arranged in two quadruple turrets located forward. They were considerably larger, faster and more powerfully armed than the ships they were designed to hunt. This last design illustrated inter-war technological developments. The ultimate limit on ship speed was drag from the water displaced (which increases as a cube of speed) rather than weight, so heavier armour slowed <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a> battleships by only a couple of knots (4&#160;km/h) over their more lightly armoured brethren. Heavy guns mounted on fast and well armoured <i>fast battleships</i> invalidated the concept of the battlecruiser as a ship class in its own right.</p>

<p><i>Admiral Graf Spee</i> had been at sea at the start of WWII and engaged in a successful commerce raiding spree. Off the coast of South America, <i>Admiral Graf Spee</i> encountered the British cruisers <a href="../../../h/m/s/HMS_Exeter_%2868%29_3ebf.html" title="HMS Exeter (68)"><i>Exeter</i></a>, <a href="../../../h/m/n/HMNZS_Achilles_%2870%29_c6d3.html" title="HMNZS Achilles (70)"><i>Achilles</i></a> and <a href="../../../h/m/s/HMS_Ajax_%2822%29_97d9.html" title="HMS Ajax (22)"><i>Ajax</i></a>. Apparently mistaking the cruisers for destroyers, the <i>Graf Spee</i> did not employ the battlecruiser doctrine and flee before the superior force. While <i>Admiral Graf Spee</i> inflicted heavy damage on the <i>Exeter</i>, it was forced to retire to neutral <a href="../../../u/r/u/Uruguay.html" title="Uruguay">Uruguay</a>. Unable to stay in port any longer without internment, and led to believe by the nature of British radio transmissions that aircraft carriers and 15-inch gunned battlecruisers were too close to evade, her captain elected to scuttle his ship, and then accepted responsibility for its destruction by committing suicide.</p>
<p>Allied battlecruisers such as <a href="../../../h/m/s/HMS_Renown_%281916%29_f645.html" title="HMS Renown (1916)"><i>Renown</i></a>, <a href="../../../h/m/s/HMS_Repulse_f82e.html" title="HMS Repulse"><i>Repulse</i></a>, <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_battleship_Dunkerque_a4bd.html" title="French battleship Dunkerque"><i>Dunkerque</i></a> and <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_battleship_Strasbourg_5930.html" title="French battleship Strasbourg"><i>Strasbourg</i></a> were employed on operations to hunt down the commerce raiding German battlecruisers, but they rarely got close to their targets, <i>Renown</i> enjoying a brief clash against the German 11-inch battlecruisers with a few non-critical hits on <i>Gniesenau</i> but being unable to keep up in bad weather. The one stand-up fight was when the <a href="../../../g/e/r/German_battleship_Bismarck_2e04.html" title="German battleship Bismarck"><i>Bismarck</i></a> was sent out as a raider and was intercepted by <a href="../../../h/m/s/HMS_Hood_%2851%29_3c89.html" title="HMS Hood (51)">HMS <i>Hood</i></a> and the battleship <a href="../../../h/m/s/HMS_Prince_of_Wales_%281939%29_d184.html" title="HMS Prince of Wales (1939)"><i>Prince of Wales</i></a> in May 1941. However, the modern German battleship was not suitable prey for the elderly British battlecruiser and the <i>Bismarck's</i> 15 inch shells caused a magazine explosion in <i>Hood</i> reminiscent of the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Jutland_e65a.html" title="Battle of Jutland">Battle of Jutland</a>.

<p>The Japanese <i>Kongō</i> class "fast battleships" were used extensively as carrier escorts for most of their wartime career. However, in the <a href="../../../n/a/v/Naval_Battle_of_Guadalcanal_fc66.html" title="Naval Battle of Guadalcanal">Naval Battle of Guadalcanal</a> on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_12.html" title="November 12">12 November</a> the <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japanese_battleship_Hiei_3102.html" title="Japanese battleship Hiei"><i>Hiei</i></a> was sent out to bombard US positions.

</div>
</div>
<p>On the eve of the Second World War the Battlecruiser enjoyed a late renaissance in popularity. The Dutch, Japanese and Americans all planned new classes of Battlecruiser specifically to counter the large Heavy cruisers being built by their naval rivals - especially the Japanese <i><a href="../../../m/o/g/Mogami_class_cruiser.html" title="Mogami class cruiser">Mogami</a></i> class cruisers. The Germans also designed a class of lightly protected battlecruisers. Some of these vessels were variously described as "super-cruisers," "large cruisers" or even "unrestricted cruisers." They were optimised as cruiser-killers, fleet scouts and commerce raiders, and many authorities consider them battlecruisers in everything but name.</p>
<p>The first such battlecruisers were the Dutch "1047" design. Never officially assigned names, the Dutch designed these vessels with the assistance of the Germans and Italians to protect their East Indies Colonies. They broadly resembled the German <i>Scharnhorst</i> Class and had the same main battery, but would have been considerably lighter and only protected against 8 inch gun fire. Although the design was completed, work on the vessels never commenced as the Germans overran the Netherlands in 1940.</p>
<p>The Germans planned to build three battlecruisers as part of their Z Plan for the expansion of the Navy. With six 15 inch (38&#160;cm) guns, high speed, excellent range but very thin armor, they were intended as commerce raiders. Only one of these was ordered shortly before World War II broke out and no work was ever done on it. No names were assigned, and they were known as <i>O</i>, <i>P</i>, and <i>Q</i>. The new class was not universally welcomed in the Kreigsmarine, their abnormally light protection gaining the class the derogatory nickname <i>Ohne Panzer Quatsch</i> (without armour nonsense) within certain circles of the Navy.</p>
<p>The only class of these last battlecruisers to be laid down were the United States Navy's two <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alaska_class_cruiser.html" title="Alaska class cruiser"><i>Alaska</i> class</a> "large cruisers", <a href="../../../u/s/s/USS_Alaska_%28CB-1%29_8dbd.html" title="USS Alaska (CB-1)"><i>Alaska</i></a> and <a href="../../../u/s/s/USS_Guam_%28CB-2%29_9748.html" title="USS Guam (CB-2)"><i>Guam</i></a>. The <i>Alaskas</i> were classified as "large cruisers" instead of battlecruisers (ironically, the Germans had used exactly the same term to describe their battlecruisers during WWI). With a main armament of nine twelve-inch guns in three triple turrets, they were designed to hunt down Japanese <a href="../../../h/e/a/Heavy_cruiser.html" title="Heavy cruiser">heavy cruisers</a> and they lacked the armoured belt and torpedo defense system normal in capital ships. However, unlike most battlecruisers their protection could withstand fire from their own caliber of gun, albeit only in a very narrow range band. Like the contemporary <a href="../../../i/o/w/Iowa_class_battleship.html" title="Iowa class battleship"><i>Iowa</i>-class</a> fast battleships, their speed made them ultimately more useful as carrier escorts and bombardment ships than as the sea combatants they were developed to be and a planned additional four ships of the <i>Alaska</i> class were cancelled after the war. <i>Hawaii</i>, the third ship, was laid up for years at over 90% complete; many plans were made and rejected for completing her either as a missile ship or a command vessel; eventually she was scrapped incomplete.</p>
<p>The Japanese started designing the B64 class, similar to the <i>Alaska</i> but with 12.2 inch guns. They responded to news of the <i>Alaskas</i> by upgrading them to the B65 design. Armed with 14 inch guns, the B65's would have been the best armed of the new breed of battlecruisers, but they still would have had only sufficient protection to keep out 8 inch shells. Much like the Dutch battlecruisers, the Japanese got as far as completing the design for the B65's, but never laid them down. By the time the designs were ready the Japanese Navy recognised that they had little use for the vessels and that their priority for construction should lie with Aircraft Carriers. Like the <i>Alaska</i>s, the Japanese did not call these ships battlecruisers.</p>

<p>In spite of the fact that the Second World War had demonstrated battleships and battlecruisers to be generally obsolete, Josef Stalin's fondness for big gun armed warships caused the Soviet Union to plan several large cruiser classes in the late 1940s and early 1950s that would be a response for the <i>Alaska</i> class vessels. In Russia, they were called "heavy cruisers" (<i>thyazholyi kreyser</i>).</p>
<p>The fruits of this program were the project 82 (<i>Stalingrad</i>) cruisers, with 36,500 tons standard load (42,300 tons full load), 9 guns 305 mm and a speed of 35 knots. Three ships were laid in 1951–52, but after Stalin's death they were canceled in April 1953. Apart from high costs, the main reason was, that gun-armed ships became obsolete with an advent of guided missiles. Only a central armoured hull section of the first cruiser <i>Stalingrad</i> was launched in 1954 and then used as a target for rockets.</p>

<p>The Soviet <a href="../../../k/i/r/Kirov_class_battlecruiser.html" title="Kirov class battlecruiser"><i>Kirov</i> class</a> of <i>Raketny Kreyser</i> (Missile Cruiser), displacing approximately 26,000 tons, is classified as a battlecruiser in the 1996–7 edition of <i><a href="../../../j/a/n/Jane%27s_Fighting_Ships_5a48.html" title="Jane's Fighting Ships">Jane's Fighting Ships</a></i>, even though in actuality they are very large missile cruisers. Their classification as battlecruisers arises from their displacement, which is roughly equal to that of a <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_I_9429.html" title="World War I">World War I</a> <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battleship.html" title="Battleship">battleship</a>, and the fact that they possess more firepower than nearly every other surface ship. However, the <i>Kirov</i>-class lacks the heavy armour that distinguishes battlecruisers from regular cruisers and they are classified as "heavy missile cruisers" in Russia. There were four members of the class completed, <a href="../../../s/o/v/Soviet_battlecruiser_Kirov_c0d9.html" title="Soviet battlecruiser Kirov"><i>Kirov</i></a>, <a href="../../../s/o/v/Soviet_battlecruiser_Frunze_de29.html" title="Soviet battlecruiser Frunze"><i>Frunze</i></a>, <a href="../../../s/o/v/Soviet_battlecruiser_Kalinin_f22c.html" title="Soviet battlecruiser Kalinin"><i>Kalinin</i></a>, and <a href="../../../r/f/s/RFS_Pyotr_Velikiy_425f.html" title="RFS Pyotr Velikiy"><i>Yuri Andropov</i></a>. As the ships were named after Communist personalities, after the fall of the USSR they were given traditional names of the Imperial Russian Navy, respectively <i>Admiral Ushakov</i>, <i>Admiral Lazarev</i>, <i>Admiral Nakhimov</i>, and <i>Petr Velikiy</i>. Due to budget constraints two members of this class have been decommissioned, although <i>Petr Velikiy</i> and <i>Admiral Nakhimov</i> are in active service and funds are being gathered for possible repair of <i>Admiral Lazarev</i>. <i>Nakhimov</i> was returned to service early, at the beginning of 2006, possibly due to increasing tensions in the <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middle_East_c1c7.html" title="Middle East">Middle East</a> and potential Russian naval involvement therein.</p>

<p>In practice, battlecruisers rarely saw the type of independent action for which they were designed. The increase in gunnery technology was so swift in the years following 1905, that there was a blurring of the distinction between the battleship and battlecruiser. At Jutland the guns on <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Beatty%2C_1st_Earl_Beatty_879a.html" title="David Beatty, 1st Earl Beatty">Beatty's</a> flagship, <a href="../../../h/m/s/HMS_Lion_%281910%29_f25a.html" title="HMS Lion (1910)">HMS <i>Lion</i></a> were 13.5-inch, which was larger than most <a href="../../../h/i/g/High_Seas_Fleet_e877.html" title="High Seas Fleet">German</a> and many <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Grand_Fleet_9508.html" title="British Grand Fleet">British</a> battleships.</p>
<p>In most cases, the temptation to add extra big guns to the main fleet proved hard to resist. As a result, battlecruiser squadrons were added to the <a href="../../../l/i/n/Line_of_battle.html" title="Line of battle">line of battle</a> — a role for which they were not designed and one that exposed them to great risk. The armour on a battlecruiser remained that of (or slightly more than) a normal cruiser. Thus the ships could dish out a lot more punishment than they could absorb. Any advantage they had in speed was lost when locked into formation at the speed of the slowest battleship in the line of battle. Heavy shells from opposing capital ships could easily penetrate their thinner armour. During Jutland, both British and German battlecruisers scored hits on each other. The British ships came off poorly, where the German ships' fared better due to better internal protection and poor performance of the British shells.</p>
<p>During the Second World War large-scale close range fleet actions did not occur. Battlecruisers were paired with battleships in roles such as raiding (German), convoy escort, or as part of task forces. In operations where battlecruisers did fight battleships, such as <i>Hood</i> and <i>Bismarck</i>, <i>Scharnhorst</i> and <i>Duke of York</i>, <i>Kirishima</i> and <i>Washington</i>, the battlecruiser was destroyed by gunfire. They were equally vulnerable to aircraft, and during <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a> several were lost in this way.</p>

<p>In <a href="../../../s/c/i/Science_fiction.html" title="Science fiction">science fiction</a>, the meaning of the word "battlecruiser" is generally somewhat different.

For example: battlcruisers fit "medium" guns, which are cruiser class armaments, as opposed to the larger battleship cannons. The similarities between the real world battlecruiser concepts and their EVE equivalents varies by ship type. The Caldari battlecruisers follow somewhat along the lines of the German concept, in that they fit relatively weak weapons (their damage output is higher than that of a cruiser) but have an incredibly resilient defense. Minmatar battlecruisers (and the Gallente tier one battlecruiser, the Brutix), in comparison, are closer to the British battlecruiser concept in that they can potentially do as much or even more damage than a battleship, but could not easily withstand firepower similar to their own.
