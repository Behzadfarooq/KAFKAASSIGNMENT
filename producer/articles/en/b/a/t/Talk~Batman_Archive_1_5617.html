<p>Yes. Unlike Dick Grayson, Jason Todd was legally adopted by Bruce Wayne as his son from the beginning. Dick was not legally adopted by Bruce until much later.</p>
<p>Actually, I think that only happened in the pre-crisis version (where Bruce even fought a bitter custody battle to adopt Jason. I'm not positive anything similar happended in the current continuity.--Talison 04:26, 29 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Quite possibly. It was 30 minute episodes which a <a href="../../../c/h/a/Channel_4.html" title="Channel 4">Channel 4</a> showed every morning one summer years ago.

<dd>If the cartoon image of Batman isn't permissible, then neither are the other images in the article. <i>All of them</i> are covered by current copyrights, after all. But rather than just say "fair use" or "not fair use", let's actually do what you suggest and apply the tests:</dd>
<dd>1) Purpose of the usage: educational and not-for-profit</dd>
<dd>2) Nature of the work: creative fiction</dd>
<dd>3) Proportion of original used: trivial (either a partial frame of a complete episode, or the cover of a complete magazine)</dd>
<dd>4) Affect on marketability of original: none</dd>
<dd>Test #2 works against it, but none of these tests are black/white deal breakers; they're factors that are taken into consideration in weighing cases. And the other three tests weigh pretty heavily in favor, as they do any time a scholar of art or literature writes about ___ and includes an example of ___ to illustrate what he's writing about. I'm not a lawyer or a judge, but I'd put my money on a ruling of "fair use" for all of them. <a href="../../../t/v/e/User%7ETverbeek_8569.html" title="User:Tverbeek">Tverbeek</a> 13:09, 25 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>DC has been careful to <i>never</i> draw connections between any of their fictional cities and real ones. In fact, New York has been specifically used as <a href="../../../w/a/l/Wally_West_3092.html" title="Wally West">Wally West</a>'s home for a few years as Flash. I think the confusion about Gotham/New York comes from the fact that it's a not-uncommon nickname for that city, dating all the way back to when it was <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Amsterdam_632c.html" title="New Amsterdam">New Amsterdam</a>. - <a href="../../../p/l/u/User%7EPlutor_2e6a.html" title="User:Plutor">Plutor</a> 13:45, 7 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't think Dennis O'Neil's statement could realistically be taken as anything other than <i>metaphor</i>.

<dd>Let me throw my two cents in here. Though I don't have an article to cite, I'm certain that since 'Crisis' that Gotham City is Located in the New Jersey/South Jersey area, possibly on the coast near Atlantic City (and its sister city Bludhaven [how do you add umlats?]) and that Metropolis is in the state of Maryland, not too far from Boston/Philaddlphia/Washington D.C.

<p>The original Bat-man comics from 1939 strongly imply that Bat-man is a resident of New York City. See page 46 of <i>Batman Archives Volume 1</i>, <b>1990</b>,DC Comics. The story is reprinted from <i>Detective Comics</i> September 1939 (No. 31), "Batman versus the Vampire (Part 1)". The first panel has the caption "Through the dark of a New York night..." The second panel also shows a famous pose of the early Batman with wings spread.</p>
<p>The classic comic Superman vs. Spiderman had a map of the East Coast of the United States which implied that Gotham City was New York, while Metropolis was (believe it or not) Philadelphia!</p>

</dl>
<p>For one thing, the relative realities of "Clark Kent" and "Superman" have varied over the years (when the character was created, for instance, "Clark Kent" was entirely a shallow front over Superman). For another, the relative realities of "Bruce Wayne" and "Batman" have likewise varied. For yet another, I would argue that in the cases of both Superman and Batman, the truth as it currently stands is that <i>both</i> the public superhero persona and the public less-heroic persona are situation-dependant fronts for the real person. --<a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_A_a8ca.html" title="User:Paul A">Paul A</a> 06:59, 24 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
You're right because saying that Bruce Wayne is just a front over Batman is quite disrespectful to the character and devoids him of any meaning. Batman exists because of Bruce Wayne's tragedy, which was losing his parents. Everytime he goes to that cemetery and pays them tribute he reinforce that. In fact, the "never forget" device has been used regularly in the comics.</p>
<p>Recently, in the pages of Superman, that very same question was laid about Superman/Clark &amp; Batman/Bruce and which was the dominant personality in each one of them. Bruce himself stated "I'm Bruce Wayne!".</p>

<p>In the Batman movie the Penguine is taken back to the Batcave while diguised as a Commadore. He asks for some water and Adam West says "The drinking water dispencer is clearly marked." It, in fact, is clearly marked just like everything in the Batcave. However it is not a "Bat-Drinking Water Dispencer" and none of the items in the cave seem to bear the Bat prefix.--Talison 04:43, 29 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Here's the problem with portraying a website that <i>anyone</i> can edit as a serious reference -- because some of the folks editing that "reference" may themselves be relying on information found on a frickin' Tripod member's page. ("If it's on the internet, it <i>must</i> be true!") And this level of scholarship comprises a Featured Article...?
<dl>
<dd>What do you suggest, then? Consulting the "Batcyclopedia"? Or maybe looking it up in a <i>serious</i> reference, like the <i><a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopedia_Britannica_0925.html" title="Encyclopedia Britannica">Encyclopedia Britannica</a></i>? But, of course, that doesn't even have an <i>article</i> on Batman, seeing that he's not a real person and all. <a href="../../../b/a/t/Batman%2C_Turkey_e2ec.html" title="Batman, Turkey">Batman, Turkey</a>, yes, <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Kane_d0c8.html" title="Bob Kane">Bob Kane</a>, sure, Batman the comic book figure, no. (It does have an article on <a href="../../../s/u/p/Superman.html" title="Superman">Superman</a>, because he's this big cultural icon while Batman is a nobody—or something like that).</dd>
<dd>Go look up that autobiography mentioned earlier. Otherwise, stop complaining about how dubious the references are if you can't discredit them with anything more convincing then "it's a frickin' Tripod member's page". As long as we mention it comes from a frickin' Tripod member's page, I don't see the problem. "If it's on the Internet, it <i>must</i> be false" is just as bogus, you know. In fact, I consider a page of some die-hard Batman fanboy to be pretty believable, considering the time and effort likely spent on it. <a href="../../../8/2/2E/User%7E82.92.119.11.html" title="User:82.92.119.11">82.92.119.11</a> 3 July 2005 16:48 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This is a serious allegation which I've never seen before, and it's both lazy and irresponsible to brush it off with, "Most accounts suggest..." Every comic, movie, novel, and TV show I've seen credits Bob Kane. If you have reason to believe someone named Bill Finger was involved, you have to back that up with specific, sourced information. Otherwise this is <b>exactly</b> the sort of anonymous, unfounded allegation that impeaches the credibility of Wikipedia.</p>

<dd>Bob Kane clearly credits Bill Finger with his contributions in his autobiography "Batman &amp; Me." He does state that only the creaters were ussually credited on the book and he had a mandatory bi-line. You must also remember that in those days they did not list the penciler, inker, leterer, colorist, or writer as seperate credits. They typically just credited the creater of the stip. Kane even mentions he was the only one credited on stories that he had no part in producing (For example, Bill Finger wrote and Jerry Robinson did the art.) Really just a difference in the buisness from then to now.--Talison 04:49, 29 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Right, but you can't go back and change history. The character was created as "The Batman". Just like a person being given one name at birth and then their nickname becoming what they are commonly referred to, the birthname still stands (William Jefferson Clinton is most often called "Bill Clinton", that doesn't make his real name obsolete). Also, the current cartoon is production is called "The Batman", the film that came out this week refers to the character as "The Batman", and many of the comics still refer to him as "The Batman", saying "all modern-day comics use 'Batman'" is wholly untrue.

<p>I did initially remove the entries of batman's homosexuality, then i tried to reinclude it in a way that would not be offensive to anyone. after Haiduc reverted it, i thought i should try and accomodate this view, so i just made some changes and additions. nothing big. i would also like to discuss this further before any major changes be made.</p>

<dd>Yeah, we already came to an understanding on that issue, Haiduc has agreed to move this information to a more suitible heading/sub-heading since the information and importance of the subject does not justify it's own section. Although he may have his own reason for moving it. As I said, the information isn't what bothers me, it's the fact that the small subject with almost no chance of developing further, is given it's own sub-heading. I had no problem with how it was originally and just adding to that would have been fine. anyway that has been resolved. no need to argue it to death. --CaptainCrash 03:29, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If you had read my comment you would have known i replaced the image because it was out of place, the whole section reads more like it's about the book and how it affected comic books then homosexuality. the picture of the book that damaged comics seems to be worth the space rather than a homosexual picture involving batman and robin. as well as the book is a larger topic of interest then how gay people perceive batman and robin, if that is your only argument, we should have a vote on which picture stays and which one goes. --CaptainCrash 16:24, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I read your comment, and didn't get that interpretation from it. It seems you just don't want the picture there because you have an issue with Batman being depicted as a homosexual. I'd say if the other editors decide that this picture (from the Wikipedia Commons) doesn't belong in the article, then just leave the section <i>without</i> a picture. A picture of the cover of <i>Seducton of the Innocent</i> does not belong here; it belongs at <a href="../../../s/e/d/Seduction_of_the_Innocent_99e8.html" title="Seduction of the Innocent">Seduction of the Innocent</a>. --<a href="../../../f/u/r/User%7EFuriousFreddy_75f4.html" title="User:FuriousFreddy">FuriousFreddy</a> 17:17, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, would you care to explain why you removed that Ganymede thing? "Too opinionated" -- exactly what there was opinion, if it's a matter-of-fact description of Batman and Robin being fairly popular figures in gay culture and that they've become objects of study. Is that an opinion? "Not factual enough" -- well, uh, how was it <i>not</i> factual? Are you saying that Vittorio Lingiardi did <i>not</i> postulate that the elationship of Batman with Robin echoes one of the most ancient metaphors of male love? (It's true that it may be <i>Lingiardi's</i> opinion, but since it is clearly presented as such, there's absolutely no POV problem here.)</dd>

<dd>Since the homoerotic element in Batman graphics and plot has been a topic of discussion for over half a century I do not see why it should be kept out of the article. The questions of whether he "was" or "wasn't" is not one that takes into consideration the complexities of a dramatic persona, or of Batman's and Robin's evolution over the years. The obligatory protestations about his non-homosexuality read like bigotry and do not belong here, or anywhere. <a href="../../../h/a/i/User%7EHaiduc_5b55.html" title="User:Haiduc">Haiduc</a> 02:12, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You must obviously be looking for bigotry in that case, and I hope you are not claiming my bigotry in order to quell my protests. I am the first person to tell people to be more open minded, and if someone attempts to insult me by calling me 'gay' or a 'fag', I just laugh, and ask why I should be offended. This is not a case of my not liking homosexuals; this is a case of a sub-section not belonging in an encyclopaedic context. The section should be focusing on how the book “Seduction of the Innocent” has affected the comic industry; you are not being barred from commenting on the homosexual stigma on batman and robin. It just does not require the whole section, it was fine how it was originally and you seem to find the need to make it more of an important topic. --CaptainCrash 02:21, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I do not want to press further what is obviously a sore point, nor to suggest that the heterosexual stigma is better or worse than the homosexual one. If you object to the "Homosexual interpretations" subheader I would be agreeable to removing it. The content, I assume, is not being disputed.

<dd>Heh, go ahead and place it under love interests. lol. Just make sure it's clear that there wasn't such a claim in any of the DC continuities and there's no problem. Although you'd probably have to edit it since it doesn't actually discuss Batman and Robin having any kind of relationship aside from mentor and sidekick. If you can get some examples from the Comics or from the TV Series' aside from the clothing they wore, then you can go for it. The last Paragraph is really the only one that fits, but it could use some additional information.--CaptainCrash 03:02, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Also 'Slanderous' might have been too harsh a word, but I got that impression from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/customer-reviews/0848816579/ref=cm_cr_dp_2_1/102-5334596-7138535?%5Fencoding=UTF8&amp;customer-reviews.sort%5Fby=-SubmissionDate&amp;n=507846" class="external text" title="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/customer-reviews/0848816579/ref=cm_cr_dp_2_1/102-5334596-7138535?%5Fencoding=UTF8&amp;customer-reviews.sort%5Fby=-SubmissionDate&amp;n=507846" rel="nofollow">Amazon Reviews</a> where most people felt this whole book was a joke and an insult to the comics/comic characters mentioned, and hurtful to the industry. I choose the word because some people felt that the original claim that Batman was homosexual was intended as derogatory to Batman and Robin, and homosexuality was considered offensive at the time, from the time period it was claimed that is understandable. Also, never did I claim that being homosexual was bad, and I don't appreciate people reading into things that don't exist. If you have a problem with my editing do not claim that it's because of some anti-gay agenda. It may actually be because I saw that an edit was justified. You may contact me, if you have a problem with my edit, and we can discuss it.</p>
<p>edit. Also I didn't even mention it, Batman being a quadroon would almost definetly be considered slanderous if the claim was made during the 50's. But that's not part of the discussion. you can go ahead and include it if you'd like. just don't devote a sub-section unless there is enough information and importance on the subject to justify it. --CaptainCrash 03:02, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Where has it ever been stated that Batwoman and Batgirl were introduced to prove Batman and Robin wern't gay? Superman and Wonder Woman also recieved an extensive "family" of characters after the code and all of DC was made lighter, campier, and more family friendly. Seems like it was just standard practice in the 50s. Also, every interview I have ever read states Dennis O'Neil seperated Batman and Robin to get back to darker stories about a more driven Dark Knight. Do you know of a source that states they were seperated to debug the gay theory? I've no doubt that the idea exists that they may be gay. Although I don't see it myself I understand where people get it from and don't argue with it being mentioned in this article. However these facts I mention seem unproven, and much of the section is simply POV. --Talison 08:21, 9 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>"Seems like it was just standard practice?" Ever thought about WHY that became standard practice? Here's a hint: Fredric Wertham, Seduction of the Innocent, and congressional hearings all had something to do with it. Nobody's suggesting that there weren't other, story reasons for all of these things to happen... but that particular era of comics history, and specifically BATMAN in that era, played a huge role in the direction comics would take for at least the next twenty years or so. It's entirely possible we're still feeling the repercussions today. Ignoring it would be like ignorning the Adam West TV show -- sure, we WISH it wasn't there, but it was, it was important, so it gets addressed. -Simnel</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Reorganization/That Whole Gay Thing</span></h2>
<p>I think much of the "this is gay stuff/no it isn't/he's bonkin' Robin/no he isn't" thing is of historical significance and not an insignificant part of popular culture, and frankly, to not address the issue at all stinks of intellectual dishonesty at its best and historical revisionism or homophobia at its worst. I want to stress that I'm not making any accusations here, I'm just making a point that it should be addressed and <i>not</i> addressing it is going to look like someone's embarrassed to talk about it, because it's a pretty well-known issue precisely because Wertham and others have made such a big deal out of it, and because it had consequences that altered the character and how the character was perceived. I should stress that this is not just some small fringe thing; it's something a lot of people who're not necessarily comics readers might be interested in.</p>
<p>That said, I think the article's getting to be too damn huge as it is and could really use some chopping up into smaller sections. It strikes me that this particular thing could well be turned into an article of its own; it could be dealt with more depth there without worrying about how it would impact on the main Batman article's readability. Another section that could well benefit from a similar treatment is "Batman in Popular Culture".</p>
<p>Thus, the main Batman article would just include the information about Batman and his history in the context of the comics, but the other articles (or perhaps one larger article that could incorporate both of the sections I mention above) would include more information about how Batman has been represented and perceived outside the traditional format.</p>

<dd>Comment, idea, and suggestion: put the header back. It makes no sense without the header. I know that some Batman fans don't want their hero depicted as having "the ghey", but it is a fact that an author wrote a (admitedly scandalous) book which made such a claim, and that the book had a significant effect on the comic itself (adding Bat-Girl). Also, I don't know about a seperate article for it.

More importantly, a lot of it isn't really so much about Batman himself as it is about how Batman has been portrayed and perceived in various circles. Batman is tremendously popular character -- hell, <i>everyone</i> knows who he is regardless of whether they know the details or if they're fans, but he's really recognizable. (If he wasn't, this whole discussion about homosexuality in the Batman context wouldn't be such a big thing.) -- <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_Disdain_3f42.html" title="User:Captain Disdain">Captain Disdain</a> 16:48, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>You misunderstand me. "Batman in Popular Culture" was not the proposed title of the new article; it's an already existing section in the current Batman article that I propose could very well be moved to the new article -- again, the point would be that this main article would deal with Batman in the comic book context, and the other article could deal with Batman's status in popular culture and how he is perceived (and <i>was</i> perceived in the past) by various groups outside the people who actually read the comic books. Batman alone can <i>easily</i> support such an article, no problem -- hell, the whole TV series/movie/video game whatever thing we have on the main article now alone could would be enough in itself. Again, the article really <i>is</i> getting to be too big, and it's not going to get any shorter without some kind of a operation. Also, again, while I think that dealing with Wertham and the (perceived) homosexual imagery and all that <i>should</i> be done, since they're notable topics, it's really bogging down the main article and hurting its readability. That's why I think creating a separate article that would help. -- <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_Disdain_3f42.html" title="User:Captain Disdain">Captain Disdain</a> 16:48, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Just to relight the gay controversy... Or not. Recall Bats (&amp; Robin) was created at a time when most comics fans were subadolescent boys. Was it kinky for C.A. to have Bucky as a sidekick? (OK, putting the kid in deadly danger is pretty sick, but that's a whole 'nother Wertham.) How many fans "stared adoringly" at Bats? What % were (are) gay? Doesn't this aspect (the kid fans, not the adoring stares) deserve some mention? <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrekphiler_ea82.html" title="User:Trekphiler">Trekphiler</a> 16:40, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, agreed -- I already commented on this above and proposed the same thing.

<dd>As I said above, I agree 100% with Freddy here. That <i>was</i> factual information -- if that's what the book says (I'm going to presume that it is, having not read it) and it is clearly presented as a noted researcher's point of view, not an universal fact (and I <i>know</i> that's how it was presented), there's absolutely no POV conflict here. There's no grounds for removing it. Crash, I have to say that your insistence of removing any mention of homosexuality in this article is starting to seem suspiciously like a conscious agenda to oppose any edits that would in any way link Batman to homosexuality. I mean, <i>none</i> of these edits have suggested that the characters are gay; just that they have been <i>perceived</i> to be gay or representative of gay relationships. -- <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_Disdain_3f42.html" title="User:Captain Disdain">Captain Disdain</a> 17:52, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Having read a portion of the book, via Amazon.com. I have come to the conclusion that Vittorio Lingiardi's reasoning for why Batman and Robin are homosexual are no better than Fredric Wertham's. He uses simple idea's to try and portray the duo as homosexual such as linking Robin to homosexuality by following a string of Pseudo-Logic Robin-&gt;Pecker-&gt;Dick (as well as Grayson, Dick). He also uses Robin's Respect for his mentor and his desire to live up to the challenge of being the hero that Batman is. He also especially seems to enjoy a scene where Robin is lying on a bed in the manor, wounded. Attempting to use that to further his proposal, it’s all very weak and I stand by my decision of removing it from the article. --CaptainCrash 18:07, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You stand by your decision of removing it from the article? You do realize that that means that you are imposing your POV on it? If <i>you</i> feel that his theories are crap, that's fine. But that's not the point; the point is whether or not they are <i>notable enough to be worth a mention</i>. If Lingiardi is a scholar respected by his peers (or famous or notorious enough, for that matter), it's good enough and what he says is worth a mention. (I'm not personally familiar with him, but Vittorio Lingiardi gets enough Google hits to suggest that he's not exactly a nobody.) You don't have to agree with his views, and I again point out that they were <i>not</i> presented as solid facts; they were presented <i>as his views</i>. It is important to understand this distinction and its implications. -- <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_Disdain_3f42.html" title="User:Captain Disdain">Captain Disdain</a> 18:17, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

I also did not mean to give the impression of imposing my POV I was just trying to keep the important factual data in and remove the less credible information. If he has won any valuable awards for his work, the topic can be discussed again, but it doesn't seem right to include the opinion of someone which no one has every really heard of, from a book hardly anyone has read when his ideas are questionable at best. --CaptainCrash 18:26, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, from what I can tell from Google, the guy's a professor at the faculty of psychology of the University of Rome, the author and/or editor of several books, and apparently not an unfamiliar face in the field of gay and lesbian psychology. Why wouldn't he have at least some credibility? If he's working and teaching in the field, and is a published author, surely that's worth something? Also, I don't think his book -- though I can't say for sure, as I haven't read all of it, just the sample at Amazon -- suggests that Batman and Robin are gay but, rather, it draws parallels between their relationship and traditional and mythic portrayals of male-male relationships. Which is <i>not</i> the same thing at all.</dd>

I repeat: contrary to your claim above, he does <i>not</i> attempt to portray the duo as homosexual. And frankly, any in-depth analysis of this book's take on Batman -- or Lingiardi's agenda on that front -- based on this sample is a joke. We only get five pages of the first (obviously introductory) chapter, and perhaps one page of that material deals with Batman and Robin. We can, however, tell that in this sample at least, he doesn't make any silly claims. (Frankly, I would have to say that your representation of the subject material above is, uh, somewhat different from how it actually reads in the sample.) -- <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_Disdain_3f42.html" title="User:Captain Disdain">Captain Disdain</a> 20:14, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'll agree that if he's the professor of psychology at the University of Rome, he might have some credibility, but psychology itself is a touchy subject. Some of the most world renowned psychologists have been proven wrong over the years. Most notably Dr. Freud, I'm sorry I don't have a source for that. I read it a while ago at my school library. So I'm not very willing to trust psychologists’ theories very easily, and finally he did make some poorly founded claims, such as I said above. He does say it can be read another way, but the emphasis is on the homosexual relationship, it is after all a book about homosexuality. --CaptainCrash 20:34, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Uh. At this point, I'm forced to conclude that either you do not understand what I'm saying, which may be a result of lack of clarity on my part, or your bias is showing. I'm leaning towards the latter, based on your own comments: yes, it is a book about homosexuality. And fittingly enough, this section of the article deals with Batman and Robin's (perceived) homosexual relationship. So what's the problem? That Professor Lingiardi might be proven wrong? But, see, he's not making a lot in the way of claims here, he's simply, in the sample, pointing out that the relationship between Batman and Robin <i>can</i> be seen as a homosexual relationship, <i>even though</i> the official stance is that it is not one, and that it lends itself to certain fantasies. Or are you saying that no publication that addresses the sexual fantasies or implications or interpretations related to Batman and Robin should ever be considered credible? But more importantly, even if he is proven wrong in the future, that's not the issue, because we're simply stating that Professor Lingiardi says this and that. It's not like he's making wild proclamations about the human psyche and our underlying mental processes here, but if it turns out that he is somehow massively wrong, so what? At that point, the article will be amended. It's not our job to decide whether a single researcher is right or wrong, let alone prove that in the article. We're simply reporting that a reputable researcher, in this case Professor Lingiardi, said x in publication y. Anything beyond that would get pretty close to <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">original research</a>. I say this again: <i>nothing in this violates NPOV</i>. (Furthermore, what he's saying in this (presumably introductory) chapter is really, really tame stuff. This is pretty damn close to standard psych text stuff; it just isn't controversial, and it is <i>not</i> a claim that Batman and Robin are doin' the nasty in the comics. Honestly, I would go so far as to say that if you continue to insist that it is, you're seriously risking your credibility as a non-biased participant here.) -- <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_Disdain_3f42.html" title="User:Captain Disdain">Captain Disdain</a> 21:05, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It just seems that we already have a few "This Person Thinks That" in the article, if you want to add another be my guest. I just don't think it's needed. I am still unsure about his credibility, but that's my distrust of him for whatever reason and I should not have let it enter this discussion it was my mistake. I must not have understood what you were saying before, but you have made that clear. as for the NPOV, that was when we weren't sure about his credibility, and posting a quote of his would suggest he is atleast somewhat credible, discovering that he is a professor of psychology at the University of Rome has proven me wrong about that. I'm going to stick with what i've said so far. we don't need it, especially since we have the quote from Burt Ward and Wertham, but if you all agree on adding to it then go ahead. just don't question my motives for my arguments, especially if you're just playing some kind of Homophobia card to get me to back down. aside from that, if I really had a problem with the homosexuality aspect I would be arguing against the recent addition of "Batdude and Throbbin" not everyone who disagrees with you has a phobia or a hatred of something they might actually be arguing on what they believe to be well founded points, and I would thank everyone to stop bringing in Anti-Gay accusations. It doesn't really help your argument.--CaptainCrash 21:17, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, when you insist that a piece of text claims that Batman and Robin are in a homosexual relationship when the text itself makes it <i>blatantly</i> clear that they are not and that it is discussing fantasies and interpretations, it's kind of hard to assume that you are not in any way biased. Still, no offense intended, and also, thank you for taking the trouble to talk about this like a civil person. I like to think that Wikipedia tends to be pretty good about that kind of stuff, but all too often people just refuse to discuss matters at all. Appreciate the effort. I think we're done here -- Freddy, I think you can do your thang now, yeah? (Uh, I should also add that there may well be some <i>other</i> arguments against including that part in the article, though I can't see any -- it's just that the author's lack of credibility or POV problems aren't among them. So, y'know, if you come up with something that seems important to you, please don't hesitate to bring it up.) -- <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_Disdain_3f42.html" title="User:Captain Disdain">Captain Disdain</a> 21:36, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Uh, if you're suggesting that DC would sue an Italian professor over a psychology text that doesn't say anything nobody has ever said before unless he points out DC's official position -- never mind that the very point he's making in the first place is about the fantasy element... okay. Look, if you really believe that he's saying that Batman and Robin really are presented as being in a homosexual relationship -- that they're really gay characters -- I think that about wraps up this conversation. That's, uh -- I'm kind of at a lack of words here. I can't imagine why it's such an issue for you and I can't understand why you would insist on believing that. You do realize that he's talking about myths, symbols, fantasies and parallels here, not analyzing Batman in the context of the Batman comics for the sake of making a case for Batman being gay? I mean, no offense, but have you ever read a psych text before? Are you familiar with the field at all? You seem to think that this is some kind of outlandish or controversial material. It's not. -- <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_Disdain_3f42.html" title="User:Captain Disdain">Captain Disdain</a> 08:19, 21 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am sorry my work has created so much chaos, but let's clear a couple of things up. It is absurd to claim that Batman "is" this or that, or to "defend" him. All I am doing is documenting one particular aspect of people's takes on this character, their readings of meaning and feeling into the story line, and the way that has played through cultures and subcultures. I am keeping to material that is written by serious scholars. Which brings me to my second point. It borders on comical for some of the contributors here to presume to pass judgement on the validity of recognized academics or entire branches of science. If you are going participate in the building of an encyclopeadia you will have to set aside your own opinions and do some serious study of existing science. If you block other users who are reporting on ongoing scholarly study because it runs against your personal opinions then you are simply catering to your personal comfort, which is not what this game is about. Prove me wrong, bring counterarguments from serious people, but don't censor me. It is my intent to create a short critical section - with appropriate illustrations - exploring a side to Batman's culturalization that was and is very important to a great many people, both young and old. I agreed here to integrate my work into an existing sub-section, as a gesture of collegiality. I did not agree to have my work subject to censorship. I grew up under communism, I have had enough of that. <a href="../../../h/a/i/User%7EHaiduc_5b55.html" title="User:Haiduc">Haiduc</a> 01:38, 21 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, for the record, I don't think anyone here is in any way defending Wertham -- hell, the guy's head was lodged firmly somewhere between fanaticism and outright crackpottery, an area that is colloquially known as "his own ass". But he <i>was</i> a notable figure and he had an impact. It's not Wikipedia's mission to give people the correct opinions, but to inform them of all notable opinions and views out there. This article, for example, is most definitely <i>not</i> the place to point out Wertham's logical fallacies in detail -- that should happen in articles devoted to Wertham or his works, and even then only so far as events, society or other scholars have proven him wrong; anything beyond that again borders on original research, which is a big no-no. Also, I really want to make it clear that I fully support Haiduc in this matter; he's very much in the right here and I think that removing his perfectly reasonable edits has been the wrong thing to do. Now, I'm not in a good position to guess at the motivations behind those removals without inviting the kind of debate that gets real personal real quick (though I have to point out that insiting that writing about the character's considerable cultural significance and influence in homosexual culture and imagery is the same thing as claiming that Batman is gay doesn't exactly suggest that anyone making such a claim is perfectly comfortable with the subject matter at hand, <i>particularly</i> as what Haiduc wrote was completely true, relevant and expressed in a neutral fashion). I am, however, in a great position to say that the removals were misguided. -- <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_Disdain_3f42.html" title="User:Captain Disdain">Captain Disdain</a> 15:58, 21 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Batman in popular culture section</span></h2>
<p>I searched the topics noted in this section and it has come to my attention that every topic in that section has already been addressed in wikipedia in as much detail given in the section itself, it seems redundant. Such as Fredric Wertham's opinion on the sexuality of Batman and Robin, but Especially the paragraph containing "<i>Batman is known as being...</i>" which is not only partially out of place, but mostly redundant with information given in this very article! This whole section should be revamped to provide some kind of usefulness or it should be removed. It might be constructive to relocate the information in this section to other sub-sections which better fit the information given, and perhaps the information could be cut down to not be redundant but to also provide the user with the information and a link to the article on the subject, So they do not lose access to the information, but it no longer clutters up an article with redundancy. I thought since this would be such a big change, I should bring it to the attention to all the editors of this article before I touch anything. --CaptainCrash 06:01, 21 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have not gone over this article with a fine-tooth comb so I cannot speak to how to reorganize it, but as far as size I do not think it is overly big, and as far as what to split off, I definitely think that the cultural aspects, including the appeal of the duo to pro- and anti-gay polemicists, need to be clearly included in their own section. Should that section grow too big, then the bulk of the material <i>could</i> be split off into specialty articles as long as a solid synopsis of a paragraph or so was left behind, as we do in many other articles here. <a href="../../../h/a/i/User%7EHaiduc_5b55.html" title="User:Haiduc">Haiduc</a> 11:51, 21 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Well, as I noted earlier (see discussion above) the article itself is already at about 42K, which is <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticle_size_0593.html" title="Wikipedia:Article size">too big</a>. Clearly something needs to be separated into its own article; this section, along with with "Batman in Other Media", seems like the best option. (I'm not saying that these section aren't important; quite the contrary, I think they're very important. Luckily, their nature is such that they can also stand on their own if presented properly and in the right context (ie. not "stuff about Batman", which is what this article is about, but rather "stuff about how Batman has been portrayed to and perceived by people outside the fandom"). I'm working on a version of that right now. -- <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_Disdain_3f42.html" title="User:Captain Disdain">Captain Disdain</a> 15:38, 21 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Well Haiduc has done an excellent job of looking up some of his points, why don't we take them and imporve other articles. Such as Burt Wards, which I 'think' doesn't mention his comment about the sexuality at all, or Wertham's which just lightly touches the subject of Batman and Robin. just my two cents --CaptainCrash 16:30, 21 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Thank you. As for splitting the article up, I'll second taking the "Other media" section out, after leaving some kind of summary here. As for the "Popular culture" material, as far as I can see the only reason for removing it from the article is to satisfy the desire of a couple of editors to sanitize the article by removing any discussion of gender bending of the Batman figure. I think we would be doing a disservice to our readers if we were to jump on the heterosexualization bandwagon, as well as politicizing and infantilizing what should be a comprehensive discussion of this figure in this culture. The section absolutely belongs in the article, as was obvious to everyone until I started developing the subsection on homoerotic interpretations.<br />
I confess to being a bit of a novice in this field, and I am only beginning to explore all the ramifications of others' homoerotic interpretations, but I have been fascinated to find out that a major American TV chain had a series of episodes sending up B&amp;R on precisely this theme (The Ambiguously Gay Duo) and in a 1989 Batman comic one of the characters (the Joker, if I am not mistaken) specifically accuses Batman of "pederasty." To say nothing about the elephant in our very living room, that 1940 cover reproduced in the article, in which the heroes are swinging through the air, focused not on their risky journey or on other dangers at hand, but staring rapturously at each other. Any critical analysis worth its salt would jump on that with both feet. So, far from there being little more to say on this topic, as postulated by a user the other day, there seems to be no limit of material that is relevant and illuminates a strong tradition of homoerotic interpretation dating back almost to the very beginning of the series. It may well be that this topic alone will merit its own article, but again not as part of a campaign of "ethnic cleansing" of the main article. I followed the link provided by <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_Disdain_3f42.html" title="User:Captain Disdain">Captain Disdain</a> to the covention on article size, and would like to highlight a very important and relevant sentence: <b>In most cases, it is a violation of the neutral point of view to specifically break out a controversial section without leaving an adequate summary.</b><br />
A couple of final points: the sentence that "modern readers find homoerotic interpretations preposterous and outrageous" (or however it is worded) is pure homophobia and left as such is nothing but a soapbox for a few outraged users. And the section on his love interests needs to be prefaced by something indicating that these ladies were introduced in large part to put to rest gossip about his sexual leanings. The section makes him out as some kind of Lothario, instead of the wounded, tortured, lonely man he really "is." <a href="../../../h/a/i/User%7EHaiduc_5b55.html" title="User:Haiduc">Haiduc</a> 23:04, 21 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have no problem with a note being entered in the love interests section, maybe something saying "Initially Batman's Love Interests were a way to show that the character is infact heterosexual, specfically his relationship with Batwoman, but since then accusations have mostly dropped he's been treated like a regular DC hero with occasional women in his life, such as the Green Lantern's Interest in Hawkgirl and Vixen in the Justice League animated series.", but a little more thought put into it, i'm assuming you've read the comic's and seen the television series, Bruce Wayne is depicted as a playboy, but his alter-ego Batman is also interested in women, mostly tough women who can handle themselves, which can be seen in his taste of superheroines, such as catwoman, wonder woman and zatanna. also I still think this paragraph "<i>Batman is known as being...</i>" is redundant of the section on evolution of the concept and supporting characters so I think that should be thrown out, especially since it's belonging in the Pop Culture section is questionable. The mention of the Porno seems thrown in to add controversey, maybe Haiduc could place it somewhere else in the section to make it fit better, it seems odd just trailing at the end. Also Burt Ward's comments about having sex with fan's in costumes, which he made in his autobiography, are conspicuously absent. Maybe a small sentance regarding that could be added. This could show that the section is not just about Batman's Homosexual interpretations and might keep people open minded about the section as a whole. Also on the not of the "modern readers find..", I think the sentance just needs a bit of reworking, that is if you are talking about this one "Most current comic book readers regard Wertham's accusations, particularly those about Batman being gay, as utterly baseless as well as slanderous." Remove the end of it "as well as slanderous", that was mine, it's accurate but probably breaks the NPOV. I thought it was removed before but someone re-inserted it. Most people do find this accusation baseless though, and think that most of the people who agree with it are looking to deep into things.</dd>

<dd>"Slanderous"? C'mon, that's just... I mean, Batman is a fictional character; you can't slander him, and furthermore, why would the claim that someone is gay be slanderous -- unless you consider being gay a bad thing, of course? Really, I don't think there's any need to comment on Wertham's theories beyond that; it's enough to tell people how they affected Batman. Public reaction to Wertham and how he is currently seen isn't a Batman issue; it's a Wertham issue -- and thus something that should be dealt with in Wertham's own article. That whole sentence is pretty bad and, I agree with Haiduc, something that certainly <i>seems</i> like homophobia regardless of its author's motivations. -- <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_Disdain_3f42.html" title="User:Captain Disdain">Captain Disdain</a> 00:46, 22 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yeah I know, at the time of writing the book, most people would have considered it slanderous. that was what i was thinking about when i wrote it. It's not nice to say but there weren't alot of fans of homosexuality in the 50's, but fans of Batman today probably don't think of it as slanderous but they do find the accusations baseless. that's why i approve the removal of that part. i thought it was actually removed but apparently someone put it back in. --CaptainCrash 01:12, 22 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Uh, no. I doubt they'd consider it slanderous, because you cannot slander a fictional character. They might consider it offensive (well, a lot of people did) or false (it <i>was</i> false), but slanderous it ain't. From a legal point of view, fictional characters don't have reputations that can be ruined by slander. That's why using the word in that context in an article is a bad idea. -- <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_Disdain_3f42.html" title="User:Captain Disdain">Captain Disdain</a> 01:38, 22 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Oh, I didn't know that according to the law you couldn't slander a fictional character. Then yes, it was a poor choice of words.

<dd>Haiduc, please let me assure you that I am in no way interested in sanitizing the article. I don't have a problem with there being a short mention of the subject (along with other subjects such as the movies, TV series, video games, the huge popularity of the campy Adam West TV version, etc.) here, with a link to a more detailed treatment of the subject. It's just that this article is a whopper. It's huge. It's not a real pleasure to read; by the time people get to the part about Batman's cultural significance, they're exhausted. Let me make this clear: I'm not at all interested in whether the subject matter at hand is controversial; I'm simply interested in the readability of the article. I'm not looking to hide anything. Again, the idea would be to have two articles: one <i>about</i> Batman, ie. a description of the character and his history almost purely in the context of the comics, and another about Batman's <i>cultural significance</i>. That's the only way of doing it I can think of that would actually make both articles capable of standing on their own. I find the idea of any kind of "ethnic cleansing" distasteful at best and am most emphatically <i>not</i> attempting to sweep the matter under the carpet, as it were -- this is <i>not</i> a "they can have their equal rights as long as they do it over there where they don't bother anyone" situation, I promise. Hell, to ensure that both articles can be easily found (since I consider both of them to be important), I wouldn't object to the "Batman" page being a disambiguation page where people can pick whether they're interested in reading about the character himself or about his place in popular culture. That way there'd be no risk of the other article being hidden and out of sight. (That might not be an acceptable solution to the rest of Wikipedia at large, but I wouldn't object to it. Oh, and a fairly similar solution would be to have a <i>"This article is about Batman in the context of comic books; to read about Batman's role in popular culture, see X"</i> note right in the very beginning of the article -- that's an accepted practice in Wikipedia and would ensure very high visibility for the topic.) -- <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_Disdain_3f42.html" title="User:Captain Disdain">Captain Disdain</a> 00:46, 22 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

It wouldn't be very fair to Haiduc if we just moved his portion and didn't tell anyone. no one would know where to look. we should place a small blurb, maybe 2-3 sentances, maybe in evolution of the concept since the accusations affect his evolution, or in the television series where the issue was the most apparent. --CaptainCrash 01:12, 22 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

"If you want to know about Batman's continuity, see <a href="../../../b/a/t/Batman.html" title="Batman">Batman</a>; if you want to know <i>why</i> Batman is important in pop culture, see Batman in popular culture."

<dd>Fair enough. But I do think that the article, as it is, is getting to be kind of unmanageable and, more importantly, pretty unpleasant to read. There's that huge chunk of character history, and another huge chunk of publication history, and then we get into the controversy and the movies and whatnot... I do believe that stuff to be relevant, but when it's all thrown in together, it doesn't work very well, and when the article is as big as it is, I'm skeptical as to whether all of the information can be included without sacrificing readability... and it's worth noting that as Batman continues to be a tremendously popular character, the page is only going to get bigger and bigger. Also, personally, I'd love to see a more in-depth treatment of Batman's cultural significance, but doing one in the context of this article isn't very appealing simply because it's so unwieldy as it is... but as I said before, it's just an idea; I'm certainly not going to start hacking away at random here or anything; that's why I brought it up here before. If you have any suggestions or ideas as to how this problem could be solved, I'm all ears. (Also, do you (and others) agree that the article has these problems, or is it perhaps just me? I mean, I realize that that is also a possibility.) -- <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_Disdain_3f42.html" title="User:Captain Disdain">Captain Disdain</a> 10:26, 22 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I edited it out because most of it was already in evolution of the concept and supporting characters, but i appreciate you coming here before doing anything about it. if you find something unique in that paragraph then you should go ahead and place it where ever you feel it fits best. Also i would suggest looking at the campy tv show for anything you could use regarding the point about the interpretations of their sexuality, that's going to be the place where most people are convinced. also early comics, where the writers for the most part didn't notice some of the jokes, like that picture up there. if you want i could take a look around for pictures from the show, because everything after that was done a little extra heterosexual just to fight off the criticism, and i guess my final note would be you really don't want to just take any pictures of batman and robin in any homosexual posses. to best prove your point you want to take as much as you can right from DC. --CaptainCrash 02:39, Jun 23, 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>edit, also you should point out the actual interpretation of the pictures you use and then the homosexual interpretations just to show where he's actually coming from and where people got their idea's from, like that picture up there you could say that usually people interpret it as Batman's Concern over his adopted son, but the most obvious interpretation is that he has feelings for robin like the other heroes care about their female companions, and you can also note that the writing had alot to do with misinterpretation of their relationship, sorry if im going on a bit about this, i know it's mostly your section so i am going to let you write it how you want.</dd>

<dd>Thanks, that would work as an example of how the TV show spoofed their relationship, but we should have something reflecting the readership's interpretation.

<p>In order to present this aspect of Batman culture it seems necessary to have:<br />
1. An example of suggestive art (and I would prefer the panel identified by CaptainCrash above, since we are mainly talking about the comic book medium), and<br />
2. An example of "ousider" art - such as the kiss I originally posted or the Chamberlain kiss picture, showing how readers have taken this suggested aspect of Batman and expanded on it. Also, mention should be made of the studio's efforts to distance Batman from Robin as a reflection of societal changes in which men fooling around with boys went from amusing peccadillo to major crime.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">other references and appearences</span></h2>
<p>i think it might be a significant edit to add in some of batman's other appearances. for instance, i think it would be an excellent idea to include mention of the multiple batman cameo appearences on Scooby Doo (or was it "scooby doo and friends?"), and the show Batman Beyond (which unfortunately is how most children today know batman). I feel that this artical focuses too heavily on the comic books, and doesnt offer a fair share of information for the predominantly TV/Movie fans of batman. --<a href="../../../w/k/n/User%7EWknight8111_df13.html" title="User:Wknight8111">Whiteknight</a> 03:59, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Batman and superman</span></h2>
<p>the relationship between batman and superman is mentioned several times in this artical, but is never truely explained. i worry that the topic of their relationship is too narrow a topic to warrant another page, but perhaps a short blurb on this artical to describe why in some media they are perfectly friendly, and in other media, they have more of an uneasy truce. i also think it might be worth disscussing in more depth how batman's lack of "super powers" works to his advantage and disadvantage in super hero groups such as Justice League. --<a href="../../../w/k/n/User%7EWknight8111_df13.html" title="User:Wknight8111">Whiteknight</a> 04:10, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>It is taken out of context and being spun as a homosexual reference. I will continue to delete it if I see it. Liek I said earlier, if Superman saved Jimmy Olsen, that doesn't mean that it's possible evidence of a homosexual relationship, it's simply evidence of contact between two men. I have NO PROBLEM with the additions of the homosexual Batman ideas on this page, but taking panels out of context is too much.<a href="../../../a/r/i/User%7EAriGold_7a2c.html" title="User:AriGold">AriGold</a> 15:18, 15 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think the point of the panel is that it is exactly images like these that lead to the Batman-as-gay image, not, if this is one of the concerns going on here, as evidence that Batman <i>is</i> gay. Yeah, its taken out of context, and yeah, its being given a double meaning that likely wasn't intended (though wow, its not at all hard to see that double meaning there). But here's the deal as I see it. Most likely none of the writers meant to make Batman look gay. Nonetheless, people see panels like that and say, "wow! Hey, Batman and Robin - what's the deal there?" We've got a whole section with quotes and references talking about just that phenomenon. It makes sense to add an image if that image helps to explain what they're seeing, how they're seeing it, and why they come to the conclusions they come to. It doesn't make sense to add an image if that image is being used to encourage readers to come to the same conclusions these psychologists, theorists, etc. have come to. Getting readers to come to one or another conclusion isn't our business here. Explaining terms, events, icons, etc. is, and if an image can help us do that it should remain. -<a href="../../../s/e/t/User%7ESethmahoney_aefd.html" title="User:Sethmahoney">Seth Mahoney</a></p>

<dd>There is a major problem when people who are not writers and have not studied the art take it upon themselves to pass judgement on the mechanics of writing. This particular piece is not "taken out of context." It creates <b>its own</b> context. It does not "prove that Batman is gay" or a pederast. It simply shows the writers having fun with that allusion and with the readers' expectations. The mechanisms (and I use that word advisedly, since good writing is part art and part mechanics) used here are as old as the world, and still used daily by stand-up comics everywhere. Thus the sense that it is "pretty funny," as a user mentioned above, is not an accident of fate that the "naive" writers "unintentionally" brought about for us "savvy" readers to laugh at, but rather a carefully wrought mechanism carefully constructed by <b>very</b> savvy writers to elicit a particular reaction from a (sometimes) naive readership in order to give them what they paid for and to keep them coming back, since this - besides being art and science - is also commerce. The reason you don't see this anymore (except out of the mouths of bad guys, like the Joker) is that public morality has changed and this instead of bring the buyers back would drive them away. So, self-appointed <a href="../../../m/r/s/Mrs._Grundy_de40.html" title="Mrs. Grundy">Mrs. Grundy</a>'s would do well to read a couple of basic books on the writer's trade (Lajos Egri's works are a good place to begin) before attempting literary criticism by the seat of the pants, to put it politely. <a href="../../../h/a/i/User%7EHaiduc_5b55.html" title="User:Haiduc">Haiduc</a> 11:46, 17 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd>You may have more experience in writing than me, though I bet I could give you a run for your money if we compared works published, but more importantly I am quite confident that I have have studied the art of comic books and the history of them far more than you (going on 20+ years of serious study). I have researched the panel you keep insisting to include and nowhere have I found any evidence of "the writers having fun with that allusion", rather I suggest you are making that assumption because you want it to be so. Prove me wrong by showing me definitive proof that it was the writers' (Gardner Fox) intention to make such a joke and I will stop removing the panel. Short of that, it is simply your opinion and not a fact and I will continue to remove it. Note: I will not accept <i>Wertham Was Right!</i> by Mark Evanier as proof. Also, don't feel the need to "put it politely" when it comes to having a discussion with me.

<p>I was asked by AriGold to comment here as someone new to the issue/neutral. My opinion is that <b>if</b> you are going to admit references to the Batman/Robin gay relationship, this panel is perfectly illustrative of the kind of comments that have given him such a reputation and, as such, it belongs in the article (as clearly supporting evidence). <a href="../../../r/a/u/User%7ERaul654_54a3.html" title="User:Raul654">→Raul654</a> 21:48, July 18, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>It doesn't matter at all whether the writers intended this to be a subtle joke or if they accidentally created the double entendre—in either case you can easily argue that it contributes to the Batman-is-gay image without ever veering into the realm of speculation. This panel has long been a source of snickering on the matter; Wikipedia isn't making that up on the spot. Of course we don't <i>know</i> what the writers' intent was, barring like, you know, <i>evidence</i>, rather than <a href="../../../o/r/i/Wikipedia%7EOriginal_research_757d.html" title="Wikipedia:Original research">original research</a>. So we shouldn't offer any opinion on that either way (my personal opinion is that the writer(s) knew perfectly well what they were doing here, but that's just how <i>I</i> think about it). I notice that the caption to the image is silent on that matter, so what's the problem here? <a href="../../../8/2/2E/User%7E82.92.119.11.html" title="User:82.92.119.11">82.92.119.11</a> 22:26, 20 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I have some serious problems with the caption being used.</p>
<p><b>The placement of Batman's reference to Robin at the end of a series of sexual innuendoes renders what by itself would be a reasonable parental reaction into a comical punch line with homoerotic overtones.</b></p>
<p>First of all, the previous comments really aren't a string of sexual innuendos. It just shows each of the main character being concerned about the person they care about most, I have a hard time seeing how you find sexual innuendo in that. The joke in this case seems to be mostly unintentional, it's been a www.superdickery.com reference as well and my understanding was that it was from a much older issue, trying to claim intent on the part of the author seems to be a bit much. Including the picture as a reference to some of the jokes or claims made about Batman is one thing, but the caption implies that this interpretation is the correct or intended one.--<a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigCow_5aad.html" title="User:BigCow">BigCow</a> 02:46, 21 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That comic panel has a humorous twist to it, but I think all this foofaraw on whether <a href="../../../b/a/t/Batman.html" title="Batman">Batman</a>, a <a href="../../../f/i/c/Fictional.html" title="Fictional">fictional</a> character, was "gay" is ridiculous. A fictional character is gay <i>only</i> if he has been portrayed as such in the authorized fiction. Batman has not been portrayed as gay, but he has on the other hand been shown in <a href="../../../h/e/t/Heterosexual.html" title="Heterosexual">heterosexual</a> relationships, both in the comics and on-screen. So Batman is <i>intended</i> to be a <i>heterosexual</i> character. Case closed, in my opinion. Decius 08:23, 27 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I agree with you Decius about Batman, Robin has also been portrayed only in heterosexual relationships such as the ones with batgirl and starfire so Robin is not gay either.Dick Grayson</p>

<p>"Initially, the "Bat-Man" was a violent avenger who carried a pistol and left his foes dead more often than not (similar to The Punisher)."</p>
<p>This statement is false or misleading as given. I looked at the earliest 11 stories (the ones preceding the debut of Robin) in my copy of Batman Archives #1.</p>
<p>In these stories, Batman did not carry or use a pistol except for one time when he was fighting vampires and needed a silver bullet.</p>
<p>It may be literally true that he left his foes more often dead than not (an exact count is hard--how do you count him fighting the same guy twice?), but when stated that way it's misleading. When Batman killed his foes it was in such ways as him hitting someone and the guy falling out a window, or into a tank of acid, or onto a sword, or such. Except for the vampires, who are monsters and not human beings, Batman notably does *not* shoot villains, say "I'm going to kill you" (except one time, when he left the guy alive!), choke people to death, chop their heads off, or otherwise show any evidence that he directly intends to kill anyone. He is certainly not like the Punisher, who does intentionally kill people.</p>
<p>There is an urban legend that Batman commonly carried a gun and intentionally killed people. It arose in the decades following the Golden Age, when it was impossible for most fans to get the original stories and prove the urban legend false. Now that those early stories have been reprinted, there is no reason for this falsehood to persist.</p>

<p>Batmans Age is one long time unsolved question which I finnaly found a comparative new answer to: In "Death &amp; the Maidens #1" Bruce remembers his parents murder happend exactly 25 years before. This is disproportional accurate I think. And "Superman &amp; Batman Secret Files &amp; Origins 2003" states, that Bruce was 10 (not 8, as said in the article) while that happened. (He was 8, everyone knows that.--A_gx7)<br />
