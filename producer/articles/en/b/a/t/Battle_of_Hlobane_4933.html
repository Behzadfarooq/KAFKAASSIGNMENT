<p>No.4 Column of the <a href="../../../b/r/i/Britain.html" title="Britain">British</a> invasion force, under Colonel <a href="../../../e/v/e/Evelyn_Wood_%28British_army_officer%29_b421.html" title="Evelyn Wood (British army officer)">Evelyn Wood</a>, were to occupy the attention of a number of <a href="../../../z/u/l/Zulu.html" title="Zulu">Zulu</a> tribes dwelling on the flat-topped mountains rising out of the plains of north-west <a href="../../../z/u/l/Zululand.html" title="Zululand">Zululand</a>. The distance of these tribes from the capital of <a href="../../../u/l/u/Ulundi.html" title="Ulundi">Ulundi</a> gave them a degree of independence from <a href="../../../c/e/t/Cetshwayo.html" title="Cetshwayo">Cetshwayo’s</a> rule, enabling the chiefs to withhold their warriors for local defence, rather than contributing to the main Zulu Army. <a href="../../../f/r/e/Frederic_Thesiger%2C_2nd_Baron_Chelmsford_2057.html" title="Frederic Thesiger, 2nd Baron Chelmsford">Lord Chelmsford</a> required these tribes to be distracted so that they would not interfere with the operations of No. 3 Column during its advance to <a href="../../../i/s/a/Isandlwana.html" title="Isandlwana">Isandlwana</a> and onto Ulundi.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_17.html" title="January 17">January 17</a>, Wood advanced his column north-eastwards, and a <a href="../../../l/a/a/Laager.html" title="Laager">laager</a> (a defensive wagon circle) was established at Tinta’s Kraal, 10 miles south of a chain of flat-topped mountains on the 20th. These were Zunguin, Hlobane and Ityentika, connected by a <a href="../../../n/e/k/Nek.html" title="Nek">nek</a>, and running for 15 miles in a north-easterly direction. While the camp was being fortified, scouts investigating the mountains were attacked from Zunguin by 1,000 Zulus. At dawn the next day and attack was mounted on Zunguin, and the Zulus fled to Hlobane, where Wood observed some 4,000 Zulus drilling that afternoon. An attack on Hlobane began on the 24th, but was scrapped when Wood learnt of the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Isandlwana_5822.html" title="Battle of Isandlwana">disaster at Isandlwana</a>. After falling back to Tinta’s Kraal, Wood decided to move his column north-westwards to Kambula hill, about 14 miles due west of Zunguin. Their arrival on the 31st was met with a message from Lord Chelmsford informing Wood that all orders were cancelled, he was now on his own with no expectation of reinforcements and that he must be prepared to face the whole Zulu Army.</p>
<p><a name="Kambula" id="Kambula"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Hlobane_4933.html" title="Edit section: Kambula">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Kambula</span></h2>
<p>February passed with no major engagements with the enemy, save for the mounted patrols sent out daily to raid the kraals of Zulus harassing No. 5 Column across the eastern <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transvaal.html" title="Transvaal">Transvaal</a> border. At Kambula, a hexagonal laager was formed with tightly locked together wagons, and a separate kraal for the cattle was constructed on the edge of the southern face of the ridge. Trenches and earth parapets surrounded both, and a stone-built redoubt was built on a rise just north of the kraal. A palisade blocked the hundred yards between the kraal and redoubt, while four 7-pounders were positioned between the redoubt and the laager to cover the northern approaches. Two more guns in the redoubt covered the north-east also. This month saw Wood receive much need reinforcements in the form of Transvaal Rangers, mounted troops, a troop of German settlers and five companies of the 80th Regiment. Wood had hoped to capitalise on the near-autonomy of the tribes surrounding him, by trying to wean them from any allegiance they felt to Cetshwayo, centring hopes on one Uhamu, Cetshwayo’s half-brother who had always been friendly towards the British and at odds with the Zulu King. On <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_13.html" title="March 13">March 13</a>, Uhamu entered the camp with 700 of his tribe, requesting escorts to bring the rest of his people out of hiding. They were hiding in caves near the headwaters of the Black Umfolozi, 50 miles to the east and only 40 miles from Ulundi. It would be considerably risky to escort large numbers to safety over this area, but Wood considered it worth it. An escort of 360 British mounted men, in addition to 200 of Uhamu’s warriors were able to return to Kambula with 900 further refugees. Shortly after this achievement, Wood received a request from Chelmsford to create a distraction to draw off some of the Zulu strength while he attempted to relieve Eshowe. Knowing that an <a href="../../../i/m/p/Impi.html" title="Impi">impi</a> was preparing to leave Ulundi and attack either Kambula or another British fort, Utrecht, Wood reckoned that by attacking Hlobane on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_28.html" title="March 28">March 28</a> he could drive cattle off the mountain, prompting the impi to attack him in his well-prepared position at Kambula.</p>

<p>Hlobane consisted of two plateaux, the lower and smaller of which rose to a height of about 850 feet at the eastern end of the 4-mile-long nek connecting it to Zunguin to the south-west. At the eastern end of this lower plateau rose very steeply for another 200 feet up a narrow, boulder-strewn way forming a series of giant steps, known as ‘Devil’s Pass’, to the higher plateau. On the top of this plateau were some 2,000 cattle and about 1,000 Zulu of the abaQulusi, many of whom had firearms. Wood’s plan for mounted troops led by Lieutenant-Colonel <a href="../../../r/e/d/Redvers_Henry_Buller_284c.html" title="Redvers Henry Buller">Redvers Henry Buller</a> to scale the eastern track to the higher plateau, supported by rocket artillery and friendly Zulus – once on top he was to drive off the cattle. A similarly composed force, under Major R. A. Russell, would occupy the lower plateau.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>The forces departed at dawn on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_27.html" title="March 27">March 27</a> and although hampered by a heavy thunderstorm, and Zulus firing at targets presented by the light of lightning flashes, Buller’s mounted troops had reached the summit by 6am of the following day. Native infantry then began herding cattle westwards. As Russell’s troops occupied the lower plateau, Wood, who was personally commanding the attack on the ground, encountered a group of the Border Horse who had become detached from Buller’s advance up the higher plateau. Wood ordered them advance towards the firing on the upper plateau but the men, mostly English settlers from Transvaal, refused. Wood himself rode on with his small party, intending to take Buller’s track up to the summit, and was eventually followed by the Border Horse. Coming under fire from the caves, as Buller’s men had, Wood was again faced by refusal upon ordering the Border Horse to clear the way. Five of Wood’s escorts charged the caves themselves, resulting in the death of two officers- Wood’s staff officer, Captain R. Campbell, and his political agent Mr Lloyd. The group moved westwards to join Russell on the lower plateau.</p>
<p>On his way, at 10.30am, Wood was riding along the southern flank of Hlobane and spotted five huge columns of Zulus to the south-east. This was the main impi, which he was not expecting arrive in the area for another day and were closing on the British fast, only 3 miles away. The impi was already breaking up and Wood could see that they would effectively block Buller’s retreat from the upper plateau and then trap Russell also. Even if Wood withdrew both groups a rapid retreat to Kambula would be required before the Zulus could reach it. Wood hurriedly sent a message to Russell, ordering him to move up to the nek, but with the advantage of high ground Russell had already seen the impi, an hour and a half before Wood, and warned Buller of their presence.</p>
<p>Buller realised the serious predicament of his force. Descent by his route up was impossible. The only option was to make for the lower plateau, where he’d be supported by Russell’s force. Russell had moved his troops off the lower plateau to Intyentika Nek, to support Bulller’s descending troops. When Wood’s orders arrived, Russell and his officers believed that Wood wished for them to take up positions on another nek, 6 miles westwards by Zunguin. Leaving a small amount of troops behind, Russell’s force departed that direction, leaving Buller alone at Hlobane.</p>
<p>Buller’s troops only had one route to the lower plateau, Devil’s Pass. The treacherous traverse was the cause of much confusion among his nervous troopers, and frenzied horses, causing inevitable casualties. This danger was heightened by the abaQulusi, who after they saw the approaching Zulu army, became more confident and daring in their attacks on the withdrawing troops. The British had to fight their way through the pass. Despite this nightmare, the British were able to get off the plateau and onto the plains, where Buller gave the immediate order to make for Kambula.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>The force was broken and disorganised, and with many horses lost the men were required to ride pillion to make it to Kambula, but they eventually all made it. The Zulu impi reached the plain where the British had departed from mere minutes after they had done so. Wanting revenge, they followed the British for 12 miles, skirmishing on all sides. <a name="Results" id="Results"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Hlobane_4933.html" title="Edit section: Results">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Results</span></h2>
<p>The Battle of Hlobane had been a total disaster for the British. 15 officers and 110 men were killed, a further 8 wounded and 100 native soldiers died. The loss in horses gravely weakened Wood’s mounted capability. The Border Horse unit, trapped and unable to retreat to Kambula was wiped out, and the battalions of Zulu warriors helping the British had decamped. However, Wood was confident that the Zulu impi would now attack Kambula as he hoped, and he was confident of victory at Kambula.</p>
<p>Colonel Buller received the <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victoria_Cross_384d.html" title="Victoria Cross">Victoria Cross</a> for his conspicuous gallantry and leadership, as did Lieutenant Lysons and Private Fowler for charging the caves that morning and to Major Knox Leet and Lieutenant Browne for going back to the save the lives of wounded men at the descent of Devil’s Pass. Lieutenant D’Arcy of the Frontier Light Horse was recommended for the Victoria Cross but denied on the grounds of him being a colonial. This was later rectified.</p>
