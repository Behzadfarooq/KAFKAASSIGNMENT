<p>In late <a href="../../../1/6/4/1643.html" title="1643">1643</a>, the English Civil War widened. While King Charles negotiated a "cessation" in <a href="../../../i/r/e/Ireland.html" title="Ireland">Ireland</a> which allowed him to reinforce his armies with English regiments sent to Ireland following the uprising in 1641, the <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parliament_of_England_d506.html" title="Parliament of England">Parliamentarians</a> took an even greater step by signing the <a href="../../../s/o/l/Solemn_League_and_Covenant_c9ac.html" title="Solemn League and Covenant">Solemn League and Covenant</a>, sealing an the alliance with the Scottish <a href="../../../c/o/v/Covenanters.html" title="Covenanters">Covenanters</a>. Early in 1644, a Covenanter army under Leven invaded the north of England on behalf of Parliament. The Royalist commander in the north of England, the Marquess of Newcastle, was forced to divide his army, leaving a detatchment under Sir <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Belasyse%2C_1st_Baron_Belasyse_4cb3.html" title="John Belasyse, 1st Baron Belasyse">John Belasyse</a> to watch a Parliamentarian army under <a href="../../../f/e/r/Ferdinando_Fairfax%2C_2nd_Lord_Fairfax_of_Cameron_ff8d.html" title="Ferdinando Fairfax, 2nd Lord Fairfax of Cameron">Lord Fairfax</a> in <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kingston_upon_Hull_19f8.html" title="Kingston upon Hull">Hull</a>, while he led his main body north to confront Leven.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>During March and early April, the Marquess of Newcastle fought several delaying actions as he tried to prevent the Scots from crossing the <a href="../../../t/y/n/Tyne_River_b459.html" title="Tyne River">Tyne River</a> and surrounding the city of <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newcastle_upon_Tyne_155c.html" title="Newcastle upon Tyne">Newcastle upon Tyne</a>. Meanwhile, a Parliamentarian cavalry force under Fairfax's son, <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Fairfax%2C_3rd_Lord_Fairfax_of_Cameron_7357.html" title="Thomas Fairfax, 3rd Lord Fairfax of Cameron">Sir Thomas Fairfax</a> entered <a href="../../../y/o/r/Yorkshire.html" title="Yorkshire">Yorkshire</a> from <a href="../../../c/h/e/Cheshire.html" title="Cheshire">Cheshire</a> and <a href="../../../l/a/n/Lancashire.html" title="Lancashire">Lancashire</a> where they had been campaigning during the winter. To prevent them rejoining Lord Fairfax in Hull, Belasyse occupied <a href="../../../s/e/l/Selby.html" title="Selby">Selby</a> which lay between them. On <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_11.html" title="April 11">April 11</a>, Sir Thomas Fairfax's force together with infantry under Sir <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Meldrum_5c58.html" title="John Meldrum">John Meldrum</a>, stormed Selby, capturing Belasyse and most of his force. <sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Hearing the news, Newcastle realised that the city of York was threatened. York was the principal city and bastion of Royalist power in the north of England, and its loss would be a serious blow to the Royalist cause.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup> He hastily retreated to York. Leven's army, less a detachment left to mask the Royalist garrison of Newcastle upon Tyne, followed up and on <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_22.html" title="April 22">April 22</a>, Leven joined forces with the Fairfaxes at <a href="../../../w/e/t/Wetherby.html" title="Wetherby">Wetherby</a> to begin the <a href="../../../s/i/e/Siege_of_York_0a79.html" title="Siege of York">Siege of York</a>. On <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_3.html" title="June 3">June 3</a>, they were reinforced by the Parliamentarian army of the <a href="../../../e/a/s/Eastern_Association_dd81.html" title="Eastern Association">Eastern Association</a> under the <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_Montagu%2C_2nd_Earl_of_Manchester_1c76.html" title="Edward Montagu, 2nd Earl of Manchester">Earl of Manchester</a>, and siege operations began in earnest as York was now completely encircled. Leven was accepted as <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commander_in_Chief_4fb1.html" title="Commander in Chief">Commander in Chief</a> of the three combined allied armies; not only were the Scots the largest single contingent, but Leven was a respected veteran of the <a href="../../../t/h/i/Thirty_Years%27_War_f03e.html" title="Thirty Years' War">Thirty Years' War</a>. <sup id="_ref-Young_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Young" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>

<p>News of the siege soon reached <a href="../../../o/x/f/Oxford.html" title="Oxford">Oxford</a>, where King Charles had his wartime capital.

At <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chester.html" title="Chester">Chester</a>, he assumed command of a small Royalist army under <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Byron%2C_1st_Baron_Byron_2ca1.html" title="John Byron, 1st Baron Byron">Lord John Byron</a>, raising his force to 2,000 horse and 6,000 foot.

<p>With <a href="../../../l/a/n/Lancashire.html" title="Lancashire">Lancashire</a> secured, Rupert now hesitated; unsure whether to continue on to York or consolidate the Royalist hold in Lancashire, securing more reinforcements in the process.

On <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_16.html" title="June 16">June 16</a> Rupert received an ambiguous dispatch from the King, which contained troubling news.

<p>Rupert understood the letter to be an order to relieve York and defeat the allied army before heading south once more in aid of the King.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[9]</a></sup> By this time Rupert’s army now numbered 14,000, and he set off on the last stage of the gruelling "York march", crossing the Pennines and arriving at <a href="../../../k/n/a/Knaresborough.html" title="Knaresborough">Knaresborough</a> on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_30.html" title="June 30">June 30</a>, 14 miles north-west of York.

Therefore they abandoned the siege on the night of June 30, and on <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_1.html" title="July 1">July 1</a> they concentrated their forces at Marston Moor, where they would block Rupert's expected direct march to York (along the old Roman road named <a href="../../../e/r/m/Ermine_Street_8b37.html" title="Ermine Street">Ermine Street</a>, the modern <a href="../../../a/5/9/A59_road.html#Yorkshire" title="A59 road">A59</a>).</p>
<p>However, Rupert made a 22-mile flank march via <a href="../../../b/o/r/Boroughbridge.html" title="Boroughbridge">Boroughbridge</a> and Thornton Bridge, which put the <a href="../../../r/i/v/River_Ouse%2C_Yorkshire_8a3a.html" title="River Ouse, Yorkshire">River Ouse</a> between himself and the Allied armies.

<p>On <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_2.html" title="July 2">July 2</a>, the Allied commanders debated their options. They decided to march south to the neighbourhood of <a href="../../../t/a/d/Tadcaster.html" title="Tadcaster">Tadcaster</a> and <a href="../../../c/a/w/Cawood.html" title="Cawood">Cawood</a> where they could both protect their own supply lines from Hull, and also block any move south by Rupert. The Parliamentarian foot, ordnance and baggage set off early, leaving the horse as rearguard. At about 9 o'clock in the morning, the Allied generals learned that Rupert's army had crossed the captured bridge of boats at Poppleton and was advancing onto Marston Moor. The Parliamentarian foot, some of whom had already reached Tadcaster, were hastily recalled.<sup id="_ref-Young_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Young" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>Meanwhile, there was tension between Rupert on the one hand, and Newcastle and his Lieutenant General <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_King_%28soldier%29_bb9b.html" title="James King (soldier)">Lord Eythin</a>, who were both strongly opposed to a <a href="../../../p/i/t/Pitched_battle.html" title="Pitched battle">pitched battle</a>.<sup id="_ref-royle293_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-royle293" title="">[10]</a></sup> Newcastle counselled that the allied army would eventually dissolve and an engagement was unnecessary, but Rupert was adamant that the King's letter (which he never showed to the Marquess) was a command to engage the enemy immediately.<sup id="_ref-Young_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Young" title="">[4]</a></sup> Furthermore, Rupert wished to compensate for the Royalists' numerical inferiority by catching the enemy unawares and before further Parliamentarian reinforcements could increase their superiority in numbers.</p>
<p>However, Newcastle’s soldiers refused to fight unless given their delayed payment. A number were also absent, pillaging the abandoned trenches outside the city, and had yet to return.<sup id="_ref-royle293_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-royle293" title="">[10]</a></sup> The late arrival of Newcastle's troops and a number of other factors thwarted Rupert's plans for a quick strike. His men were exhausted from their long march, as were the soldiers from York who had undergone the strain of ten weeks of siege. Rupert therefore did not attack; and during the day, the odds against him lengthened as the Parliamentarians returned from their aborted move south and took position.</p>

<p>The Parliamentarians occupied Marston Hill, a low but nevertheless prominent feature in the flat Vale of York, between the villages of Long Marston and Tockwith. They had the advantage of height, but cornfields stretching between the two villages hampered their deployment.</p>
<p>Their left wing was under the command of Manchester's Lieutenant General <a href="../../../o/l/i/Oliver_Cromwell_331c.html" title="Oliver Cromwell">Oliver Cromwell</a>, and consisted of 3000 horse from the Eastern Association, including Cromwell's own regiment of <a href="../../../i/r/o/Ironsides.html" title="Ironsides">Ironsides</a>. There were also 600 attached musketeers, in platoons of 60 between the "divisions" of horse. Their purpose was to disrupt attacking cavalry or dragoons. This was a common practice in the Swedish army of the Thirty Years' War, and was also adopted by the Royalists. 1000 lighter Scots horse under Sir David Leslie were deployed to Cromwell's rear, and 500 Scots dragoons on the extreme left.</p>
<p>The centre, under several Generals with no overall commander, consisted of over 14000 foot, with 30 to 40 pieces of artillery. The various regiments had been hastily deployed as they returned to the field and were considerably mixed up, but most of Manchester's foot under Sergeant Major General <a href="../../../l/a/w/Lawrence_Crawford_baad.html" title="Lawrence Crawford">Lawrence Crawford</a> were on the left of the front line, and Lord Fairfax's in the centre. Scots brigades, the "Vanguard" of their army, made up the right of the front line under Lieutenant General <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Baillie_94a1.html" title="William Baillie">William Baillie</a>. The second line consisted entirely of Scots, their "Main Battle" or simply "Battle", under Sergeant Major General James Lumsden. The weaker third and fourth lines consisted of some of Fairfax's infantry, a single Scots brigade, and the Earl of Manchester's own regiment of Foot.</p>
<p>The right wing was commanded by Sir Thomas Fairfax (with <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Lambert_%28general%29_f639.html" title="John Lambert (general)">John Lambert</a> as his second in command), with 2000 horse from Yorkshire and Lancashire and 600 musketeers, with 1000 Scots horse to his rear.<sup id="_ref-Young_3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Young" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>

<p>The Royalists occupied the low-lying moor, behind a drainage ditch that Rupert noted as an effective obstacle for a cavalry charge. When the contingent from York belatedly arrived accompanied by Eythin, Rupert's dispositions were criticised by Eythin as being drawn up too close to the enemy. It was unfortunate that Rupert and Eythin already knew and disliked each other. Both had fought at the Battle of Vlotho in <a href="../../../1/6/3/1638.html" title="1638">1638</a>, where Rupert had been captured and held prisoner for several years. Rupert blamed Eythin's caution for the defeat; Eythin blamed Rupert's rashness. Some of Eythin's remarks on July 2 seem quite insolent. When Rupert proposed to move his army out of range of Allied artillery as Eythin suggested, Eythin pontificated that it was too late in the day for such a move.<sup id="_ref-Young_4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Young" title="">[4]</a></sup> The Royalist army prepared to settle down for the night, close to the Allied armies.</p>
<p>The Royalist left wing consisted of 2100 cavalry, mainly from the "Northern Horse", and 500 musketeers, with the first line under Lord Goring and the second under Sir <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Lucas_d1cf.html" title="Charles Lucas">Charles Lucas</a>.</p>
<p>Their centre was nominally commanded by Eythin, although Rupert's Sergeant-Major General Henry Tillier led most of the troops. A forlorn hope of musketeers lined the ditch. The infantry units of Rupert's army, 7000 strong, formed the first line, with the 3000-man infantry contingent from Newcastle's army, and a brigade of "Northern Horse" numbering 600 under Sir William Blakiston, behind them. There were also 14 field guns.</p>
<p>The right wing was commanded by Lord Byron, with 2600 horse and 500 musketeers. The second line, of comparatively inexperienced regiments, was commanded by Lord Molyneaux.</p>
<p>Rupert commanded a reserve of 600 cavalry, including his elite Lifeguard of Horse, in person.<sup id="_ref-Young_5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Young" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>

<p>Delayed by the late arrival of the York garrison, it was late evening before the Royalists were fully deployed. A flurry of rain showers and the discouragement of Newcastle and Eythin persuaded Rupert to delay his attack until the next day; from the ranks of the allied army he could hear the singing of psalms. As his troops broke ranks for their supper, Leven noted the lack of preparation among his opponents, and ordered his men to attack at shortly after half-past seven, just as a <a href="../../../t/h/u/Thunderstorm.html" title="Thunderstorm">thunderstorm</a> broke out over the moor.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p>On the allied left, Cromwell's horse quickly defeated Byron's wing. Though under orders to stand his ground and rely on the ditch and musket fire to slow the progress of an enemy attack, Lord Byron instead ordered a hasty counter-charge which disordered his own troops and prevented his musketeers firing without fear of hitting their own cavalry.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[12]</a></sup> In the clashes which followed, Cromwell was slightly wounded in the neck, by a pistol ball in most accounts, and briefly left the field to have the wound dressed. Meanwhile, Rupert led his reserve towards the right, rallying his own fleeing Regiment of Horse and leading them in a counter-attack. A Parliamentarian officer wrote:</p>

<p>Sir David Leslie's Scots eventually swung the balance for Cromwell. Rupert's right wing and reserve were routed and he himself narrowly avoided capture by hiding in a nearby bean field.<sup id="_ref-royle298_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-royle298" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>
<p>In the centre, Crawford's, Lord Fairfax's and most of Baillie's foot initially succeeded in crossing the ditch, capturing at least three royalist pieces of artillery. On the right, Sir Thomas Fairfax's wing fared less well. Sir Thomas Fairfax himself later wrote,</p>

<p>Most of Goring's victorious wing either scattered in pursuit, or fell out to loot the allied baggage train, but some of them under Sir Charles Lucas wheeled to attack the right flank of the Allied infantry. Meanwhile, some of Newcastle's foot counter-attacked Lord Fairfax's foot in the centre of the allied front line and threw them into confusion. Following up this advantage, Blakiston's brigade of horse (with its numbers probably augmented by a troop of "Gentleman Volunteers" under Newcastle himself) charged the allied centre. Under these assaults in the confusion and the gathering darkness, over half the Scots and Parliamentarian infantry fled. Leven and Lord Fairfax also left the field, believing all was lost.<sup id="_ref-royle296_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-royle296" title="">[16]</a></sup> Manchester remained, but commanded no more than his own regiment of foot near the Allied rear. However, one Scottish brigade at the right of their front line under the Earl of Crawford-Lindsay and Viscount Maitland, stood firm against Lucas, even succeeding in taking him captive<sup id="_ref-royle296_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-royle296" title="">[16]</a></sup>, and behind them the Scottish Sergeant Major General Sir James Lumsden managed to reform part of the Allied centre.</p>
<p>By now it was nearly fully dark, although the full moon was rising. The countryside for miles around was covered with fugitives from both sides. A messenger from Ireland riding in search of Prince Rupert wrote,</p>

<p>With no general present in command of either side, a drawn battle might have resulted, but Cromwell's disciplined horsemen had rallied behind the Royalist right. Sir Thomas Fairfax, finding himself alone in the midst of Goring's men, removed the "Field Sign", (a handkerchief or slip of white paper which identified him as a Parliamentarian), from his hat, and made his way to Cromwell's wing to relate the state of affairs on the Allied right flank.<sup id="_ref-Fairfax_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Fairfax" title="">[15]</a></sup> Cromwell now led his cavalry, with Leslie's Scots horse in support and Crawford's foot on his right flank, around the Royalist rear to attack Goring's wing from behind. Goring's tired and disorganised troops were driven from the field.</p>
<p>The triumphant allies now turned on the remains of the Royalist centre, overrunning successive units and cutting down many fugitives. Finally some of Newcastle's foot, the "Whitecoats", gathered for a last stand in a ditched enclosure named White Sike Close, in the rear of the Royalists' original position. They refused to surrender and repulsed constant allied cavalry charges until the last 30 survivors finally surrendered.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[18]</a></sup></p>
<p>Approximately 4000 Royalist soldiers had been killed, many in the last stand of the "Whitecoats", and 1500 captured including Charles Lucas and Major General Henry Tillier.

<p>Newcastle, having seen his forces broken and having spent his entire vast fortune in the Royalist cause, resolved that he would not endure the "laughter of the court".

Under the agreement that no Scottish soldiers were to be garrisoned in the city, the garrison surrendered on honourable terms on <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_16.html" title="July 16">July 16</a>. <sup id="_ref-royle299_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-royle299" title="">[19]</a></sup> Leven subsequently took his troops north to besiege Newcastle upon Tyne, while Manchester's army returned to <a href="../../../l/i/n/Lincolnshire.html" title="Lincolnshire">Lincolnshire</a> and eventually moved into the south of England.<sup id="_ref-royle298_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-royle298" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>
<p>Over the next few months the Scots and Parliamentarians slowly eliminated the remaining Royalist garrisons throughout northern England. The Royalist cavalry from the area, the "Northern Horse", continued to fight for King Charles under Sir <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marmaduke_Langdale_3656.html" title="Marmaduke Langdale">Marmaduke Langdale</a>, and even made several forays from the south to relieve Royalist garrisons in south Yorkshire, but they became increasingly undisciplined and licentious, turning many former sympathisers away from the Royalist cause.</p>
<p>The defeat at Marston Moor was a serious blow to the Royalist cause. Prince Rupert had been decisively beaten for the first time in the war, and lost his reputation for invincibility. In the aftermath of the battle, the body of his lapdog, "Boye", was discovered; Parliamentarian propaganda made much of this, treating Boye almost as a <a href="../../../f/a/m/Familiar_spirit.html" title="Familiar spirit">Devil's familiar</a>.<sup id="_ref-royle299_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-royle299" title="">[19]</a></sup> By contrast, Oliver Cromwell's reputation as a cavalry commander was firmly established. It was acknowledged that the discipline he had instilled into his troops, and his own leadership on the battlefield had been crucial to the victory. From this moment, he was to exert increasing influence both in the House of Commons and in the Parliamentarian armies in the field.</p>
