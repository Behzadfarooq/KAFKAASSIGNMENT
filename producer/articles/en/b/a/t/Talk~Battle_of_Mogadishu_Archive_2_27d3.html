<h2><span class="mw-headline">List of dead</span></h2>
<p>Does anyone other than me find it inappropreite that a list of the US dead is provided, yet not a single Somali? Perhaps it would be better to have the list noted as a link from the main article. It seems somewhat offensive that of the estimated one thousand people killed in the battle, only Americans - who made a tiny portion of the deaths - are listed by name. <a href="../../../f/e/r/User%7EFergananim_eea0.html" title="User:Fergananim">Fergananim</a> 19:57, 28 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Thats because there is no such list, because of an non-exsistant governement structure. If it were possible to create such list I say go for it. <a href="../../../p/p/g/User%7EPPGMD_7152.html" title="User:PPGMD">PPGMD</a> 21:48, 28 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>That's exactly my point, there is no such list of Somali dead and its unlikely that there ever will be. So is'nt it rather disingenious to list only the American dead in the article? It would be like having a list at Pearl Harbour of the Japanese who died on December 7 1941, or that of the hijackers on a plaque at Ground Zero. I don't mean to totally excise them - I did say the list could form a sub-article of its own; its just that it seems utterly improper to have it within the main article given that the battle was fought in Somalia, against Somalians, and resulted in the death and injury of thousands of Somalis.<a href="../../../f/e/r/User%7EFergananim_eea0.html" title="User:Fergananim">Fergananim</a> 17:34, 29 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>These men were also fighting for the future of Somali. To ensure that food shipments truly got out to the people after over 24 UN peacekeepers were murdered and mutilated. To ensure that they would have a stable nation. It's very different to the two cases you presented. <a href="../../../p/p/g/User%7EPPGMD_7152.html" title="User:PPGMD">PPGMD</a> 20:30, 29 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p><i>When the film "Black Hawk Down" premiered in Somalia in 2002, thousands went to see it. Many people in Mogadishu were angered by the film, calling it propaganda that focused on the 18 Americans killed and 73 wounded in the 15-hour battle, when an estimated 600-1,000 Somalis were also killed. When it was learned that the battle has been turned into a game for Xbox and PlayStation2, Somalis said it made a mockery of a real-life tragedy.</i></p>
<p>For the record, I am not anti-American (far from it!) so please understand that I am not indulging in some dumb far left "Yank-bashing".</p>
<p>Mogadishu was a tragedy for the Americans concerned, but also for the Somalis. There does not appear to be anyone from Somalia or Mogadishu here to present their point of view, so I thought I might. That in no way means I might agree with those views; its just a matter of trying to keep to wiki policy on articles (and perhaps a personal disposition to be Devil's Advocate).</p>
<p>The above quote makes it clear that many in Mogadishu do not like manner in which this has being presented to the world, focousing <i>"on the 18 Americans killed and 73 wounded ... when an ESTIMATED 600-1,000 SOMALIS WERE ALSO KILLED."</i> (my capitals). Despite the greater number of Pakistani dead, no one seems to have even created an article on them, never mind listing them by name. So why should the (honourable) American dead be given greater prominence than the rest? Sincerly, <a href="../../../f/e/r/User%7EFergananim_eea0.html" title="User:Fergananim">Fergananim</a> 22:50, 29 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Once again, get me a list. This is an encylopedia, you put facts in here. You don't remove facts because a country can't keep descent records. As far as seeing it different that might come from Adid, the political winner having years to brainwash the people. The mission that TFR performed was an honorable, and was backed by the UN (in fact the entire mission was from UN driven mission creep). They weren't not there to kill Somalis, they were there to kill the people that were hindering food shipments. <a href="../../../p/p/g/User%7EPPGMD_7152.html" title="User:PPGMD">PPGMD</a> 00:30, 30 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I have not removed facts - the list is still there. And its disingenious to fall back on the excuse of Somalia not keeping decent records given the state it was and still is in. And on the score of brainwashing, I think I helped make it clear that a great deal of the reason for the hostility shown to the Americans was because of their actions on July 12. By way of analogy, the aftermath of <a href="../../../b/l/o/Bloody_Sunday_%281972%29_00c8.html" title="Bloody Sunday (1972)">Bloody Sunday (1972)</a> led to a huge increase in recruitment for the IRA and their subsequent attacks on British forces. Based on all this, can you not concede that inclusion of the list of American dead (which I have never objected to as a sub-article) would be outragous to Somalis?<a href="../../../f/e/r/User%7EFergananim_eea0.html" title="User:Fergananim">Fergananim</a> 23:34, 30 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>July 12th was also a UN operation. Frankly this article is about a specfic battle, a list of the dead is not outragous at all, as long as it doesn't get to long. At this moment, short of Somalis figuring which of thier citizens died on thos two, the list is limited to 19 names, 18 Americans, and one Malaysian, if someone can find his name. <a href="../../../p/p/g/User%7EPPGMD_7152.html" title="User:PPGMD">PPGMD</a> 14:09, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree, I think the list of American dead is beneficial to the article's fact-gathering. I was looking for a list, and found it here. I think it should stay up. Mention of Somali dead should be included, but it seems clear that we should report on what we know. I'd like to make this article more detailed about the actual <i>battle</i> itself. --Zenosparadox</dd>

<dd>I dont have a source right now, but i know i could find one. It has been discussed before that african war lords use gun powder in food to conrol their fighters. Gun powder contains a chemical that doesnt let you think all too clearly if consumed, and you will probably do anything that some one tells you. Lets also not forget that Adid paid alot of his soldiers in "cot" which they constantly chewed. This means that most of the fighters that day were not in their right mind to make good moral decisions. In short? Thats pretty much brain washing/mind control.(<a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESuper6Eight_72a2.html" title="User:Super6Eight">Ryan</a> 02:08, 15 December 2005 (UTC))</dd>

<p>back to the real point i think that its not wikipedias fault for not having an acurate list of dead somalis because there isnt one, and wount ever be one because there was no gov in somalia at the time, Mr or Mrs Fergananim-hthfirebird-january 25 06 p.s. (the game is great though)</p>
<p>let's not for get our own prejudices. the movie was made for an American public; a public whose concerns are for Americans, not "enemy" Somalis. there are thousands of Somalis who can care for the dead Somali fighters. in my opinion, Americans should be concerned with the list of KIA Americans; it is only natural, that an American would feel indifferent if there is or is not a list of Somali dead.</p>
<dl>
<dd>'Let's not forget our own prejudices, blah blah' immediately above is a misguided statement. To repeat what someone else said earlier 'This is an encylopedia, you put facts in here.' Wikipedia is not intended as a list of North American attitudes. It is irrelevant (and offensive) here whether Blackhawk Down is a good video game or not. Americans may be concerned only with the list of KIA Americans, however Wikipedia is not an American military document. It might be natural for some Americans to feel indifferent to Somali dead, but this page should strive for balance. I am commenting on the aim of the page. I accept that no list of Somali dead is likely to ever be compiled. <a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentrepull_3d3f.html" title="User:Centrepull">Centrepull</a> 18:33, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Honestly, I think the information does not exist considering the lack of any sources availible at the time and the fact that many of the survivors that may know the names of dead have likely died themselves in the 13 years since the battle. I mean, the median age for Somalis is 17.something years... I suggest making a list as names become availible if/until it becomes unwieldly then make a new article from that point. As to the inclusion of American dead by name, it is factual, avalible, and can be both desired and useful research information.<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathbunny_3da9.html" title="User:Deathbunny">Deathbunny</a> 07:20, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Pakistani dead would be kind of hard since there were none directly related to this operation. There were 24 Pakistani dead, which lead to the UN requesting the US to undertake this operation.

<dd>The Malaysian KIA is Pvt Mat Aznan Awang (promoted to L/Cpl pothmonously) of 19 Royal Malay Regiment. He was the driver of APC 1 of Fire Group Alpha. KIA'd when the sliding windscreen shield of his APC failed to activate to deflect an incoming RPG. He received a full military burial in his hometown of Baling, Kedah. He was also the first Malaysian soldier to be killed in action while serving under UN banner. For his action on Oct 3, 1993 and a previous uncited incident, he was awarded with <a href="../../../s/e/r/Seri_Pahlawan_Gagah_Perkasa_8468.html" title="Seri Pahlawan Gagah Perkasa">Seri Pahlawan Gagah Perkasa</a> medal, the nation highest gallantry award.

I think that a list should be shown, if one could be found because these pakistanis died with our soilders-hthfirebird-january 25 2006</p>
<dl>
<dd>Actually that is incorrent, no Pakistainis died during this operation. 24 Pakistanis were killed when raiding an Adid controlled radio station that was broadcasting anti-UN messages, that prompted the UN requesting the US to deploy the troops that became Task Force Ranger. <a href="../../../p/p/g/User%7EPPGMD_7152.html" title="User:PPGMD">PPGMD</a> 15:14, 20 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I agree that it would be appropriate if a list were made of Somali dead, however how could that be possible if American bullets etc practically tore apart Somali militiamen beyond recognition?</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">soldiers remains</span></h2>
<p>The remains of Shughart and Gordon were pulled through the roads of Mogadishu by the Somali mob. This is not mentioned here. But my question is: How did the U.S. Forces get them back?</p>
<dl>
<dd>I presume that U.S. forces found the remains when they went back into the city to get the rest of their dead and wounded that were still stuck and isolated in small pockets.Or they saw them on the ground as they were flying over (since this battle wasnt the exact end of the U.S. presence in somalia). This is a good question, however i dont know if it should be discussed, or placed in this article. Some people may get a bit touchy on somthing like this.(<a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESuper6Eight_72a2.html" title="User:Super6Eight">Ryan</a> 02:08, 15 December 2005 (UTC))</dd>

<p>but they need to at least put that in, so people are not wondering what happened to them-hthfirebird-january 25 06</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Consequences for Somalia? Somali perspective in general?</span></h2>
<p>The article discusses the consequences for American politics and policies but says nothing about the consequences in Somalia. Did this event have any effect on subsequent events in Somalia?</p>
<p>The article, like the book and movie <i><a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_Hawk_Down_7c7c.html" title="Black Hawk Down">Black Hawk Down</a></i>, seems to be based mainly on American and European sources. I don't agree that information from American sources should be suppressed to balance the lack of information available from other sources, but the article would be much improved by contributions from researchers with access to other sources.</p>

<dd>Another point is that US military seem to have not learnt lessons from the battle. i.e., Army Humvees were latter strongly armored (M1114 HMMVW instead of M1097 Heavy Hummer), but they didn't receive armor for the machine-gun. Some Humvees receive an armor similar to the 'ACAV' armors on vietnam-M113 APCs, due to lessons of Operation Iraqi Freedom... Also, RPGs threat fot 'choopers' was not very in the mind of pilots instructors, whereas most of US Helicopters losses since Somalia (most notably Afghanistan 2001-... and Iraq 2003-...) were caused by RPGs. And this is recently that some active-counter-measures against RPG were developed. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERob1bureau_a856.html" title="User:Rob1bureau">Rob1bureau</a></dd>

<dd>The up armored Humvees are a trade off, maneuverability for armor, you will notice that there are increasingly more and more deaths from auto accidents in Iraq, because the drivers were trained to drive the Humvees without the armor, and the new up armored ones have a higher roll over risk. The Humvee just was never designed for combatant role, and they were being put into that role both here and in Iraq. The Army needs more wheeled APCs like the Strykers, in particular something small enough to be used on normal city streets but armored enough to survive land mines, something between the Stryker and the Humvee. <a href="../../../p/p/g/User%7EPPGMD_7152.html" title="User:PPGMD">PPGMD</a> 19:38, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Am I the only one who thinks the Rwanda argument is BS? It's not like the US has a tradition of stopping genocidal regimes unless they declared war on the US (Nazi Germany) or had vital ressources/threatened the access to those (Saddam). In fact the US supported some of them (Khmer Rouge) for various reasons. To say Clinton didn't intervene in Rwanda because of the Battle of Mogadishu is like saying I didn't break the world record for the 100m today because it rained when I walked to college. 82.135.7.211 17:59, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I just made a change to the section on how many americans were killed and 'wounded". I would also like to add that the section "Links with Al-Qaeda" would be complete without the references on how to operate an RPG so as to not get noticed. Does this really need to be included? I can see the purpose, but I think the positives outway the negatives here. Also, the part about the irony adds a non-neutral point of view.

<li>I'd just added the list of Malaysian units involved (only one known, though). There are rumours though among those who had served in MAF, especially those who had served under UN flags believed that another Malaysian unit could have been involved in the combat (not among the rescue team). Malaysian commandoes were said to have been inserted either together or separately from the Deltas. No confirmation could be received on this info, therefore I didn't include it.</li>

<p>Oh, and also. Let's see:</p>
<p>"Consequences of the operation</p>
<p>Chalk Four Ranger returns to base after a mission in Somalia, 1993.In a national security policy review session held in the White House on October 6, 1993, President Clinton directed the acting chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral David E. Jeremiah, to stop all actions by U.S. forces against Aidid except those required in self-defense. He also reappointed Ambassador Robert B. Oakley as special envoy to Somalia in an attempt to broker a peace settlement and then announced that all U.S. Forces would withdraw from Somalia no later than March 31, 1994. On December 15, 1993, Secretary of Defense Les Aspin stepped down, taking much of the blame for President Clinton in what was deemed a failed policy. For all intents and purposes, President Clinton was now determined to militarily disengage from Somalia as quickly as possible. Most of the American troops were out of Somalia by March 25, 1994. A few hundred Marines remained offshore to assist with any noncombatant evacuation mission that might occur regarding the 1,000-plus U.S. civilians and military advisers remaining as part of the U.S. liaison mission. All U.S. personnel were finally withdrawn by March 1995.</p>
<p>The Battle of Mogadishu led to a profound shift in American foreign policy, as the Clinton administration became increasingly reluctant to use military intervention in Third World conflicts, (such as failing to halt the machete-hacking deaths of an estimated 1,000,000 civilians by Hutu militia groups in Rwanda in 1994), and affected America's actions in the Balkans during the later half of the 1990s. President Clinton preferred to use the "air power alone" tactic and hesitated to use U.S. ground troops in fighting Serbian military and para-military ground forces in Bosnia in 1995 and in Kosovo in 1999, out of fear of losing American soldiers in combat, as well as fear of repeating what happened in Mogadishu in 1993."</p>
<p>I guess they all shared fear of Capturing the Intended Targets?&#160;:) --<a href="../../../h/a/n/User%7EHanzoHattori_3996.html" title="User:HanzoHattori">HanzoHattori</a> 15:17, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Jesus. What "captured that night", they attacked at day! That's how bad everything went. So bad the ENTIRE US WAR AGAINST AIDID was lost in instant. Somalis also "Captured Target" (1 US POW, but so much more valuable). Tactically a foreign victory (mostly managed to survive, and inflicted much greater casaulties - even if the plans were entirelly different and the best done would be without one shot). But strategically - a TOTAL disaster. If it went worse then that, the outcome still couldn't be worse. And these prisoners? Were released (unimportant). --<a href="../../../h/a/n/User%7EHanzoHattori_3996.html" title="User:HanzoHattori">HanzoHattori</a> 17:59, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The Operation started during the day and ending the next morning, I refer to it as an overnight operation because a majority of the Operation time wise occured during the night. The operation that was invovled directly with the Battle of Mogadishu was an operation to capture 2 teir 1 targets, both targets were captured in addition to others attending the meeting that weren't as important. It's all listed in this report <a href="http://www.dod.mil/pubs/foi/reading_room/778.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.dod.mil/pubs/foi/reading_room/778.pdf" rel="nofollow">PDF</a> page 61. Yes the prisoners were released, but this particular operation, code worded Irene, that occured Oct, 3-4 1993 captured it's targets. <a href="../../../p/p/g/User%7EPPGMD_7152.html" title="User:PPGMD">PPGMD</a> 18:20, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>PPGMD is right HanzoHattori. The mission's goal was to capture the two lieutenants. They were captured. Yes, there was a massive firefight, now famous, but the mission was considered a success. The shift in the US policy did not directly occur because of the battle, it occured because of the National Security Council's reaction to the destabilized situation. Phyrric victory is certainly not the case: The US army did not cease to become an effective fighting force because of their victory.

<p>What? Who ever said the US Army was destroyed?&#160;:) It was "just" the Somalia special forces group who got decimated (and stopped to be "an effective fighting force", yes). The original Phyrric victory was "Another such victory over the Romans and we are undone." That was exactly what happened in Mogadishu, as the shocked US leadership decided they can't have any more victories like this, must stop this intervention now, get out all the forces (fast) - and even to avoid any major ground combat anywhere in the future. Because - it was a disaster. It was a disaster for the militia too, but in the end they won the war against the foreigners in this very battle. And the Somali prisoners taken? Totally lost any and all importance and were released, as the pilot captured in this battle was MUCH more important for the Americans. --<a href="../../../h/a/n/User%7EHanzoHattori_3996.html" title="User:HanzoHattori">HanzoHattori</a> 02:04, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That would be a conclusion that would have to be discussed on the page and sourced, that Capture of Intended Targets is already sourced and sums up the sum total of this particular part of the operation.

You're apparently not understanding the concept of a Phyrric victory: It's one where the "victorious" army achieve's its victory at such a cost to itself that it either ceases to become an effective fighting force, or that the benefits of victory are far outweighed by the cost of the casualties. Are you seriously going to tell me that 18 US Casualties make a phyrric victory? Because by that logic, nearly every war ever fought by the US army would count as such. Capture of intended city is a correct term, Phyrric victory does not adequately describe this battle. Sorry but as one who has served in combat in the US military, I can say the general consensus is that you're wrong <a href="../../../s/w/a/User%7ESwatjester_64b9.html" title="User:Swatjester"><font color="red">⇒</font></a> <a href="../../../s/w/a/User_talk%7ESwatjester_ad13.html" title="User talk:Swatjester"><font face="Euclid Fraktur"><font color="black">SWAT</font><font color="goldenrod">Jester</font></font></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Swatjester_088b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Swatjester"><small><sup>Ready</sup></small></a> <a href="../../../r/s/t/RSTA_5dcc.html" title="RSTA"><small>Aim</small></a> <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_United_States_Armed_Forces_74b7.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject United States Armed Forces"><small><sub>Fire!</sub></small></a></p>

I don't say this to denigrate the bravery of those soldiers, and I understand that the mission objectives were accomplished...but this was done at far too high of a cost, and the consequence was the US Army abandoning the mission in Mogadishu.

<dd>This is almost like the "Battle of <i>The Battle of Mogadishu</i>"&#160;:-) I think the cause for the different points of view is that we have a successful operation on the one hand (capture of Aidid lt.s), but a resultant battle – which was not part of the mission plan – which negatively impacted the overall mission in Somalia and hence "A victory won at too great a cost" (pyrrhic victory) with cost not always being specifically human lives.<a href="http://www.wordsmith.org/words/pyrrhic_victory.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.wordsmith.org/words/pyrrhic_victory.html" rel="nofollow">[8]</a> Remember that Somali's also claim victory (also then a pyrrhic victory), because to them it was a battle, regardless of the TFR mission objectives. This is not a typical battle – or part of a typical war – so perhaps we could be forgiven for a more wordy "Result" field including both views, either using footnotes or perhaps the "notes" field in this info box. I will knock up something and then we can trim it down to reflect both – valid – outcome descriptions. --<a href="../../../d/e/o/User%7EDeon_Steyn_e30c.html" title="User:Deon Steyn">Deon Steyn</a> 10:52, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That seems to be a fine compromise for now, though any pyrrhic victory can really be described in such terms -- the British succeded in their "Capture of intended hills" during the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Bunker_Hill_ab19.html" title="Battle of Bunker Hill">Battle of Bunker Hill</a>, the Germans "Captured intended island" in the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Crete_4bf7.html" title="Battle of Crete">Battle of Crete</a> during WWII, even good ol' Pyrrhus "Captured intended battlefield" at <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Asculum_8398.html" title="Battle of Asculum">Asculum</a>. But this seems to be the precedent set for many of the controversial modern battles where the outcome could be viewed as pyrrhic; the <a href="../../../t/e/t/Tet_Offensive_66e9.html" title="Tet Offensive">Tet Offensive</a> has a similarly "confused" outcome. It's as if the only battles with a clear outcome are the battles fought in antiquity. To me it does not seem <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">NPOV</a>, because it tends toward a <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nationalism.html" title="Nationalism">nationalistic</a> bias.

<dd>I agree with you PPGMD, but the article (and the actual event) was partly about this mission and then turned into something else and article is called <i>battle of mogadishu</i> not <i>TFR operation Irene</i> and this is where the ambiguity lies and why we have to make a compromise where the neutral stance is to reflect both points of view.

<p>I have done a lot of reading into the Battle of Mogadishu and am fascinated by it. One problem with the article here is that there is no mention of the drought that occured in the 1980s. There a famine that existed the previous decade and the civil war only enhanced that famine. I am not arguing with the fact that some agriculture was destroyed, but the drought was the primary reason behind the famine, not the destruction of the agriculture.</p>

<dd>You don't need a dictionary to define it, it was an attempt to sum up the operation in 4 words, Capture (ie they secured them) of the Intended (ie the what they planned to get) targets. Originally it was Capture of targets when I started editting this article, but a number of editors came (confusing the battle's goals with the operations objectives) and said "But Aidid was never captured." So the Intended was added to clarify that the page is for this single Battle not the opertion as a whole. If you really have some time on your hands, why don't you expand the Operation Gothic Serpent page, it could really use more information on the aftermath of this battle, in particular President Clinton's response. <a href="../../../p/p/g/User%7EPPGMD_7152.html" title="User:PPGMD">PPGMD</a> 20:43, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I see you didn't understand me, so let me repeat: I need you to show me ANYONE ANYWHERE using this "real" term while not quoting this very article. (Also, as a secondary objective: tell me Why Are You Using Capital Letters without reason all the time.) --<a href="../../../h/a/n/User%7EHanzoHattori_3996.html" title="User:HanzoHattori">HanzoHattori</a> 20:58, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Black Hawk Down: "...Task Force Ranger dropped into a teeming in the heart of Mogadishu in the middle of a Sunday afternoon to surprise and arrest two lieutenants of warlord Mohamed Farrah Aidid. It was a complex, difficult, and dangerous assignment, and despite terrible setbacks and losses, and against overwhelming odds, the mission was accomplished." He doesn't use those exact 4 words, but the jist of it is, that TFR went in an captured the targets that they were sent into to capture. Originally it was "Capture of Targets," before I started editing it. To stop the almost weekly "but Aidid was never captured," intended was added into it. <a href="../../../p/p/g/User%7EPPGMD_7152.html" title="User:PPGMD">PPGMD</a> 21:13, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Can we change the ranks to the correct short terms? In the Army, the are WO1, CW2, CW3, CW3, and CW5. Durant was in the Army, not the Navy, so he was not a CWO3, he was a CW3. -cplradar</p>
