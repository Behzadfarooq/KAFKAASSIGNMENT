An original series Battlestar</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The Battlestar <i>Pegasus</i> appears in the original series two-part episode, "<a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Battlestar_Galactica_%281978-1980%29_episodes_9e42.html" title="List of Battlestar Galactica (1978-1980) episodes">The Living Legend</a>".</p>
<p>The Battlestar <i>Pegasus</i> spent its earlier life patrolling the edges of Colonial space under <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commander_Cain_6362.html" title="Commander Cain">Commander Cain</a>. Cain was a renowned Colonial warrior and had been referred to often as "the living legend". Later, the <i>Pegasus</i> took part in the battle of Jol'Trata in which the ship was badly damaged. After the battle she was found by the Battlestar <i>Athenia</i> and towed back to <a href="../../../c/a/p/Caprica.html" title="Caprica">Caprica</a> for repair and re-fitting. Two years before the destruction of the <a href="../../../t/w/e/Twelve_Colonies_ca7d.html" title="Twelve Colonies">Twelve Colonies</a> the <i>Pegasus</i> was involved in the battle of Molokai with the <a href="../../../c/y/l/Cylon_%28Battlestar_Galactica%29_911f.html" title="Cylon (Battlestar Galactica)">Cylon</a> forces. The battle was a complete disaster for the Colonial forces and the entire fifth fleet, except the <i>Pegasus</i>, was destroyed. The <i>Pegasus</i> managed to slip away from the battle and, realising that the route back home would be crawling with Cylons, made its way into deep space.</p>
<p>After the destruction of the Twelve Colonies, two of the <i>Galactica</i>'s Vipers are discovered while on patrol by the <i>Pegasus</i>, the two Battlestars meet and take part in a fierce battle against the <a href="../../../c/y/l/Cylon_%28Battlestar_Galactica%29_911f.html" title="Cylon (Battlestar Galactica)">Cylons</a>. Towards the end of the battle, the <i>Pegasus</i> moves into point-blank range of two Cylon Basestars and manages to destroy them. After the "dust" has settled from the attack there is no sign of the <i>Pegasus</i>.</p>
<p>Commander Cain's daughter, <a href="../../../l/i/e/Lieutenant_Sheba_3c7a.html" title="Lieutenant Sheba">Lieutenant Sheba</a>, a pilot of the <i>Pegasus</i> remains with the <i>Galactica</i> after the <i>Pegasus</i>'s disappearance.</p>

<p>The <i>Pegasus</i> first appears in the re-imagined series episode "<a href="../../../p/e/g/Pegasus_%28Battlestar_Galactica%29_44e8.html" title="Pegasus (Battlestar Galactica)">Pegasus</a>" and remains part of the series from then until the episode "<a href="../../../e/x/o/Exodus_%28Battlestar_Galactica%29_f1bb.html" title="Exodus (Battlestar Galactica)">Exodus, Part 2</a>", playing a major role in the episodes "<a href="../../../r/e/s/Resurrection_Ship_%28Battlestar_Galactica%29_22f1.html" title="Resurrection Ship (Battlestar Galactica)">Resurrection Ship</a>" and "<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Captain%27s_Hand_%28Battlestar_Galactica%29_06e5.html" title="The Captain's Hand (Battlestar Galactica)">The Captain's Hand</a>".</p>
<p>The Battlestar <i>Pegasus</i> is a Mercury Class Battlestar, assigned to Battlestar Group 62 of the Colonial Fleet, and commanded by <a href="../../../a/d/m/Admiral.html" title="Admiral">Admiral</a> <a href="../../../h/e/l/Helena_Cain_5f8e.html" title="Helena Cain">Helena Cain</a> at the time of the <a href="../../../c/y/l/Cylon_%28Battlestar_Galactica%29_911f.html" title="Cylon (Battlestar Galactica)">Cylon</a> attack on the <a href="../../../t/w/e/Twelve_Colonies_ca7d.html" title="Twelve Colonies">Twelve Colonies</a>. Thought to have been destroyed during the attack on the colonies, <i>Pegasus</i> escapes, and encounters the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battlestar.html" title="Battlestar">Battlestar</a> <i><a href="../../../b/a/t/Battlestar_Galactica_%28ship%29_3bab.html" title="Battlestar Galactica (ship)">Galactica</a></i> and the last survivors of the Twelve Colonies around six months after the escape from Ragnar Anchorage.</p>
<p>Before the fall of the <a href="../../../t/w/e/Twelve_Colonies_ca7d.html" title="Twelve Colonies">Twelve Colonies</a>, the <i>Pegasus</i> had just docked at the Scorpion Fleet Shipyards where it was due for a three-month overhaul. Many of the ships systems were offline, including the Command Navigation Program that the Cylons used to disable Colonial defences during their attack. The Cylons' opening wave hit the shipyard with several <a href="../../../n/u/c/Nuclear_weapon.html" title="Nuclear weapon">nuclear</a> warheads, destroying five ships, including two Battlestars. The <i>Pegasus</i> lost over 700 crew members. <i>Pegasus</i> survives the attack on the shipyards having performed a blind <a href="../../../f/t/l/FTL_%28Battlestar_Galactica%29_da4d.html" title="FTL (Battlestar Galactica)">FTL jump</a>, a jump in which the ship's FTL drive was activated without inputting any coordinates. This blind jump resulted in the ship escaping immediate destruction, but risked the Battlestar's possible reappearance inside a <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star.html" title="Star">star</a> or <a href="../../../p/l/a/Planet.html" title="Planet">planetary</a> <a href="../../../c/e/l/Celestial_body_atmosphere.html" title="Celestial body atmosphere">atmosphere</a> at the end of the jump.</p>

</div>
<p>As a result of the Cylons' devastating attack on the <a href="../../../t/w/e/Twelve_Colonies_ca7d.html" title="Twelve Colonies">Twelve Colonies</a>, Admiral Cain became increasingly iron-fisted. <i>Pegasus</i>'s <a href="../../../e/x/e/Executive_Officer_414a.html" title="Executive Officer">Executive Officer</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colonel.html" title="Colonel">Colonel</a> <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_Fisk_%28Battlestar_Galactica%29_0314.html" title="Jack Fisk (Battlestar Galactica)">Jack Fisk</a>, tells his <i>Galactica</i> counterpart, <a href="../../../s/a/u/Saul_Tigh_1bbd.html" title="Saul Tigh">Colonel Tigh</a>, of an incident in which Admiral Cain shot the original XO in the head in front of the entire crew for refusing to implement her order to attack a heavily-defended Cylon base. Fisk then made it appear as if this claim were a "joke".</p>
<p>It is later revealed that <i>Pegasus</i> had acquired a small civilian fleet, which Cain subsequently cannibalized for spare parts. She also forced civilians to join her crew at gunpoint, which led to two families being murdered under Cain's orders. Eventually, she abandoned the fifteen-ship fleet to fend for itself, without any FTL drives.</p>
<p>After the <i>Pegasus</i> escaped from the shipyards, and before meeting the <i>Galactica</i>, the <i>Pegasus</i> had been performing repeated hit-and-run attacks upon Cylon forces. <i>Pegasus</i> had trailed a large Cylon fleet which jumped between systems with natural resources. In one of these jumps, <i>Pegasus</i> discovers the escaping fleet of Colonial ships protected by the <i>Galactica</i>.</p>
<p>The initial rejoicing in the rag-tag fleet following the <i>Pegasus</i>'s meeting with the <i>Galactica</i> does not last long. As the senior surviving Colonial officer, Admiral Cain assumes command of the fleet, replacing <i>Galactica</i>'s <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commander.html" title="Commander">Commander</a> <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Adama_6d54.html" title="William Adama">William Adama</a>. While at first assuring Adama that she would not interfere with <i>Galactica</i>'s operations, Cain soon orders crew reassignments, withholds the delivery of supplies to the civilian fleet and sends her so-called "Cylon interrogator", Lieutenant Thorne, to question <i>Galactica</i>'s Cylon prisoner. Lt. Thorne's interrogation and attempted rape of the Cylon model known as <a href="../../../n/u/m/Number_Eight_%28Battlestar_Galactica%29_0885.html" title="Number Eight (Battlestar Galactica)">Sharon</a> results in his accidental death after he is interrupted and attacked by two of the <i>Galactica</i>'s crew, <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chief_Petty_Officer_3b0f.html" title="Chief Petty Officer">Chief Petty Officer</a> <a href="../../../g/a/l/Galen_Tyrol_1bae.html" title="Galen Tyrol">Galen Tyrol</a> and <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karl_Agathon_fea8.html" title="Karl Agathon">Lieutenant Karl "Helo" Agathon</a>, both of whom had had relations with Cylon copies of Sharon.</p>
<p>Tyrol and Agathon are arrested by <i>Pegasus</i> Marines and charged with killing Lt. Thorne. Cain sentences both to death after a summary trial. Receiving the news of his men's death sentences, Commander Adama orders a strike team of Colonial Marines to be sent to the <i>Pegasus</i> to retrieve his crew. An armed stand-off between <i>Pegasus</i> and the ship's compliment of Mark VII Vipers against <i>Galactica</i>'s own Mark II and Mark VII Vipers ends when Lieutenant <a href="../../../k/a/r/Kara_Thrace_95ae.html" title="Kara Thrace">Starbuck</a> reappears from her (unauthorized) recon mission aboard the <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stealth_technology.html" title="Stealth technology">stealth</a> Blackbird with photos of a <a href="../../../c/y/l/Cylon_Resurrection_ship_dbe5.html" title="Cylon Resurrection ship">mysterious Cylon ship</a> being guarded by two Basestars. Interrogation of the <i>Pegasus</i>' Cylon prisoner (a <a href="../../../n/u/m/Number_Six_%28Battlestar_Galactica%29_6767.html" title="Number Six (Battlestar Galactica)">Number Six</a> model named Gina) reveals that the mysterious ship is a "Resurrection Ship", a vessel that gives new bodies to dead Cylons, effectively making the Cylons fearless of death. Although Adama and Cain declare an uneasy truce in order to coordinate an attack on the Cylons, they make plans to assassinate each other, which are called off after the Resurrection Ship is destroyed. <a href="../../../n/u/m/Number_Six_%28Battlestar_Galactica%29_6767.html" title="Number Six (Battlestar Galactica)">Gina</a> escapes with the help of Baltar and kills Admiral Cain.</p>
<p>Colonel Jack Fisk is promoted and named Commander of the <i>Pegasus</i> after Cain's death; he is murdered by members of a <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_market.html" title="Black market">black market</a> organization shortly thereafter. Engineering chief <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barry_Garner_0e41.html" title="Barry Garner">Barry Garner</a> replaces Commander Fisk as commander of the <i>Pegasus</i>. Commander Garner, who is stated as an excellent engineer, but unused to command, allows the <i>Pegasus</i> to be drawn into an ambush by three Cylon Basestars. The <i>Pegasus</i> suffers damage to her FTL jump drive cooling system, thus preventing her from escaping with an FTL jump. Commander Garner sacrifices his life to repair the damage, allowing the <i>Pegasus</i> to jump to safety.</p>
<p>Newly promoted Admiral Adama promotes his son, Major <a href="../../../l/e/e/Lee_Adama_cc9b.html" title="Lee Adama">Lee Adama</a>, to the rank of Commander, and gives him command of the <i>Pegasus</i>. Soon thereafter, the fleet discovers a habitable world and begins to colonize it, naming their new home "New Caprica". The <i>Pegasus</i> and the <i>Galactica</i>, with skeleton crews, form an orbital defence network over the new colony, but when the colony is discovered a year later by a Cylon fleet, they are forced to abandon the colony and jump away.</p>

<p><i>Pegasus</i> is destroyed in action during the third-season episode "<a href="../../../e/x/o/Exodus_%28Battlestar_Galactica%29_f1bb.html" title="Exodus (Battlestar Galactica)">Exodus, Part 2</a>". Disobeying orders from Admiral Adama to protect the civilians that first escape the Cylon occupation in the second season episode "<a href="../../../l/a/y/Lay_Down_Your_Burdens_fe33.html" title="Lay Down Your Burdens">Lay Down Your Burdens, Part 2</a>", Apollo leaves all of <i>Pegasus</i>'s <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colonial_Viper_cda8.html" title="Colonial Viper">Viper</a> squadrons with the civilian ships, along with most of the crew. FTL Jumping to New Caprica, Apollo is able to divert the attention of the four Cylon Basestars attacking the <i>Galactica</i> as the older Battlestar attempts to cover the evacuation of the New Caprican colonists. This distraction allows time for <i>Galactica</i>'s FTL drives to be repaired and the planet-bound colonists to reach their ships and escape.</p>
<p>One Cylon Basestar is critically damaged by <i>Pegasus'</i> forward main batteries as it enters the fray, drawing the fire from the Basestars. After <i>Galactica</i> jumps away, <i>Pegasus</i> is locked into a suicide course, weapons systems firing automatically. The crew is evacuated to several <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colonial_Raptor_c6f0.html" title="Colonial Raptor">Raptors</a>, just before <i>Pegasus</i> rams a Basestar, destroying it. The explosion causes the Battlestar to fragment with the starboard hangar pod colliding with and destroying another Basestar.</p>

<p>As a Mercury-class Battlestar, the <i>Pegasus</i> is substantially newer, larger and more powerful than the <i>Galactica</i>. It is nearly twice the size (<a href="../../../p/e/g/Pegasus_%28Battlestar_Galactica%29_44e8.html" title="Pegasus (Battlestar Galactica)">"Pegasus" episode (Extended Edition)</a> but only possesses around half the crew due to greater automation. The <i>Pegasus</i> possessed approximately 1,753 crewmembers at the time it encountered <i>Galactica</i>.</p>
<p>The <i>Pegasus</i> possessed vastly superior weapons, flight decks, and armor compared to the <i>Galactica.</i> Its forward weapons battery can devastate a Cylon basestar with a single salvo<sup id="_ref-The_Captain.27s_Hand_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-The_Captain.27s_Hand" title="">[1]</a></sup>. It is armed with large anti-ship KEWs, anti-fighter/missile batteries and nuclear weapons. It possesses much larger flight decks than <i>Galactica</i>, two on each side of the ship. The <i>Pegasus</i> had four fully-operational squadrons of Vipers at the time it encountered <i>Galactica</i> and automation systems that allowed the production of new Vipers to help replace <i>Galactica</i>'s losses. Unlike <i>Galactica</i>, <i>Pegasus</i> had flight simulators on board to facilitate the training of new pilots<sup id="_ref-Scar_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Scar" title="">[2]</a></sup>.</p>

<p><a href="../../../r/o/n/Ronald_D._Moore_9761.html" title="Ronald D. Moore">Ronald D. Moore</a> announced that as part of the deal for the fourth season of the new Battlestar Galactica, they would be making a made-for-TV movie that would tell the story of the Pegasus from the time of the Cylon attack on the colonies, up to the time it discovered the Galactica. The film will air at some point prior to the start of the fourth season of the series.</p>
