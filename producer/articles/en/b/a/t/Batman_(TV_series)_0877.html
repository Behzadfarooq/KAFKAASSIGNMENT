<p>The series was produced in the United States of America and debuted at 7:30, Wednesday evening, <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_12.html" title="January 12">January 12</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/6/1966_in_television.html" title="1966 in television">1966</a> on ABC television, with the conclusion airing at 7:30 Thursday night, <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_13.html" title="January 13">January 13</a> (replacing <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Adventures_of_Ozzie_and_Harriet_51a2.html" title="The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet">The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet</a></i> on Wednesdays [it moved to Saturday] and the cancelled primetime music variety series <i><a href="../../../s/h/i/Shindig%21.html" title="Shindig!">Shindig!</a></i> on Thursdays), at a time against other popular TV series including <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Andy_Griffith_Show_b993.html" title="The Andy Griffith Show">The Andy Griffith Show</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Wild_Wild_West_2cda.html" title="The Wild Wild West">The Wild Wild West</a></i>. The <i>Batman</i> series set a standard that identifies it as a product of the 1960s. It was known for its silly high <a href="../../../c/a/m/Camp_%28style%29.html" title="Camp (style)">camp</a> humour and continues to be the version some associate with the Batman character despite it being least reflective of the Batman mythos as it is known today. (The series <i>was</i> very reflective of the character as portrayed in comics in the late 1950s and early 1960s, before editor <a href="../../../j/u/l/Julius_Schwartz_95ec.html" title="Julius Schwartz">Julius Schwartz</a> revamped the books, removing much of the silliness.) The series ran for a total of 120 25-minute episodes.</p>
<p>The show revolved around the adventures of the crimefighter Batman (<a href="../../../a/d/a/Adam_West_4c2d.html" title="Adam West">Adam West</a>) and his <a href="../../../s/i/d/Sidekick.html" title="Sidekick">sidekick</a> <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robin_%28comics%29.html" title="Robin (comics)">Robin</a> (<a href="../../../b/u/r/Burt_Ward_6839.html" title="Burt Ward">Burt Ward</a>) in <a href="../../../g/o/t/Gotham_City_7766.html" title="Gotham City">Gotham City</a>. Batman's dual identity was that of the debonair "millionaire philanthropist" <a href="../../../b/r/u/Bruce_Wayne_68b8.html" title="Bruce Wayne">Bruce Wayne</a>, who lived outside the city in "stately Wayne Manor." He lived with his youthful ward <a href="../../../d/i/c/Dick_Grayson_3d69.html" title="Dick Grayson">Dick Grayson</a>, also known as <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robin_%28comics%29.html" title="Robin (comics)">Robin</a> (<a href="../../../b/u/r/Burt_Ward_6839.html" title="Burt Ward">Burt Ward</a>), faithful butler <a href="../../../a/l/f/Alfred_Pennyworth_d0b8.html" title="Alfred Pennyworth">Alfred</a> (<a href="../../../a/l/a/Alan_Napier_4ea4.html" title="Alan Napier">Alan Napier</a>), and Aunt Harriet Cooper (<a href="../../../m/a/d/Madge_Blake_07ce.html" title="Madge Blake">Madge Blake</a>). Though mentioned only once during the second season, Aunt Hariet Cooper was Dick Grayson's, not Wayne's biological aunt. Both Wayne and Grayson were orphaned at the hands of criminals.</p>
<p>The adventures usually called for the heroes to fight supervillains such as <a href="../../../j/o/k/Joker_%28comics%29.html" title="Joker (comics)">The Joker</a> (<a href="../../../c/e/s/Cesar_Romero_b004.html" title="Cesar Romero">Cesar Romero</a>, who refused to shave off his moustache before his make-up was applied), <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Riddler_e2d1.html" title="The Riddler">The Riddler</a> (<a href="../../../f/r/a/Frank_Gorshin_57d2.html" title="Frank Gorshin">Frank Gorshin</a> and <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Astin_4feb.html" title="John Astin">John Astin</a>), <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penguin_%28comics%29.html" title="Penguin (comics)">The Penguin</a> (<a href="../../../b/u/r/Burgess_Meredith_5433.html" title="Burgess Meredith">Burgess Meredith</a>), <a href="../../../k/i/n/King_Tut_%28Batman%29_78dd.html" title="King Tut (Batman)">King Tut</a> (<a href="../../../v/i/c/Victor_Buono_8ffc.html" title="Victor Buono">Victor Buono</a>), and <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catwoman.html" title="Catwoman">Catwoman</a> (at various times <a href="../../../j/u/l/Julie_Newmar_b55c.html" title="Julie Newmar">Julie Newmar</a> and <a href="../../../e/a/r/Eartha_Kitt_f154.html" title="Eartha Kitt">Eartha Kitt</a>). In reality King Tut was a timid history professor who, after being hit in the head with a brick at a peace rally, donned the persona of the Egytian royal. When a bell rang (suggesting a school bell) the villain would return to his meek demeanor.</p>
<p>Other main characters were <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Gordon_%28comics%29_3507.html" title="James Gordon (comics)">Police Commissioner Gordon</a> (<a href="../../../n/e/i/Neil_Hamilton_%28actor%29_31d5.html" title="Neil Hamilton (actor)">Neil Hamilton</a>), Chief O'Hara (<a href="../../../s/t/a/Stafford_Repp_e18b.html" title="Stafford Repp">Stafford Repp</a>) of the Gotham City Police, and, in the third season, <a href="../../../b/a/t/Batgirl.html" title="Batgirl">Batgirl</a> (<a href="../../../y/v/o/Yvonne_Craig_e3ac.html" title="Yvonne Craig">Yvonne Craig</a>). Probably one of the campiest installments featured flashy Vegas showman <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberace.html" title="Liberace">Liberace</a>, in a dual role as a hard-nosed cigar chomping thug and his intimidated, but basically-honest brother.</p>
<p>Quick action sequences, the voice of TV producer William Dozier as a pompous sounding narrator (identified as Desmond Doomsday on the <i>Batman Television Soundtrack Album</i>) providing the storylines, <a href="../../../p/s/y/Psychedelic.html" title="Psychedelic">psychedelic</a> sets and costumes, <a href="../../../d/u/t/Dutch_angle.html" title="Dutch angle">Dutch angles</a> (with the criminals' lairs always being filmed with the camera at an angle to emphasize the "crooked" nature of the filthy criminals), and bright colors were all meant to evoke the four-color, campy world of the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comic_book.html" title="Comic book">comic books</a> of the 1950s and 1960s under the strict <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comics_Code_Authority_17c7.html" title="Comics Code Authority">Comics Code Authority</a>.</p>
<p>The series is notable for its use of <a href="../../../c/l/i/Cliffhanger.html" title="Cliffhanger">cliffhanger</a> endings and the Batclimb cameo, which allowed top celebrities of the 1960s to appear in a small part. The fight scenes between the "Dynamic Duo" and the villains were interlaced with titles that reflected comic book style sound effects: <i><b>WHAM! POW!</b></i> Some observers contend the titles also helped cover low-quality stunts and missed punches. It should be noted that many fans of the Batman series contend that the titles and missed punches were intentional: a satire of the comic book it was intended to portray.</p>

<p>In the early 1960s, Ed Graham Productions optioned the TV rights to Batman, and planned a straightforward juvenile adventure show, much like <i><a href="../../../a/d/v/Adventures_of_Superman_%28TV_series%29_8b0c.html" title="Adventures of Superman (TV series)">Adventures of Superman</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Lone_Ranger_44e9.html" title="The Lone Ranger">The Lone Ranger</a></i>, for <a href="../../../c/b/s/CBS_250c.html" title="CBS">CBS</a> on Saturday mornings. <a href="../../../m/i/k/Mike_Henry_e4a1.html" title="Mike Henry">Mike Henry</a>, who would later go on to star in the <a href="../../../t/a/r/Tarzan.html" title="Tarzan">Tarzan</a> franchise, and is best known for his portrayal of <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jackie_Gleason_eefb.html" title="Jackie Gleason">Jackie Gleason</a>'s dipstick son in the <i><a href="../../../s/m/o/Smokey_and_the_Bandit_fd89.html" title="Smokey and the Bandit">Smokey and the Bandit</a></i> movies, was set to star as Batman. Reportedly, <a href="../../../d/c/_/DC_Comics_9a75.html" title="DC Comics">DC Comics</a> commissioned publicity photos of Henry in a Batman costume. Around this same time, the <a href="../../../p/l/a/Playboy_Club_288c.html" title="Playboy Club">Playboy Club</a> in <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago%2C_Illinois_2106.html" title="Chicago, Illinois">Chicago</a> was screening the Batman serials (1943's <i><a href="../../../b/a/t/Batman_%28serial%29.html" title="Batman (serial)">Batman</a></i> and 1949's <i><a href="../../../b/a/t/Batman_and_Robin_%28serial%29_1831.html" title="Batman and Robin (serial)">Batman and Robin</a></i>) on Saturday nights. It became very popular, as the hip partygoers would cheer and applaud the Dynamic Duo, and boo and hiss at the villains. An east coast <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Broadcasting_Company_349c.html" title="American Broadcasting Company">ABC</a> executive named Yale Udoff, who was a Batman fan in childhood, attended one of these parties at the Playboy Club and was impressed with the reaction the serials were getting. He contacted west coast ABC executives <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harve_Bennett_24de.html" title="Harve Bennett">Harve Bennett</a> and <a href="../../../e/d/g/Edgar_Scherick_fbfc.html" title="Edgar Scherick">Edgar Scherick</a>, who were already considering developing a TV series based on a <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comic_strip.html" title="Comic strip">comic strip</a> action hero, to suggest a <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prime_time.html" title="Prime time">prime time</a> Batman series in the hip and fun style of <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Man_from_U.N.C.L.E._97a9.html" title="The Man from U.N.C.L.E.">The Man from U.N.C.L.E.</a></i>.</p>
<p>When negotiations between CBS and Graham stalled, DC quickly reeled the rights back in and made the deal with ABC. ABC farmed the rights out to <a href="../../../2/0/t/20th_Century_Fox_3a0c.html" title="20th Century Fox">20th Century Fox</a> to produce the series. Fox, in turn, handed the project to William Dozier and his Greenway Productions. Whereas ABC and Fox were expecting a hip and fun, yet still serious, adventure show, Dozier, who loathed comic books, concluded the only way to make the show work was to do it as a <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pop_art.html" title="Pop art">pop art</a> camp comedy. Originally, mystery novelist <a href="../../../e/r/i/Eric_Ambler_556e.html" title="Eric Ambler">Eric Ambler</a> was to write the motion picture that would launch the TV series, but he dropped out after learning of Dozier's camp comedy approach.</p>
<p>By time ABC pushed up the debut date to <a href="../../../1/9/6/1966.html#January" title="1966">January 1966</a>, thus foregoing the movie until the summer hiatus, <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lorenzo_Semple_Jr._0591.html" title="Lorenzo Semple Jr.">Lorenzo Semple Jr.</a> had signed on as head script writer. He wrote the <a href="../../../t/e/l/Television_pilot.html" title="Television pilot">pilot</a> script, and generally kept his scripts more on the side of pop art adventure. <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stanley_Ralph_Ross_0abd.html" title="Stanley Ralph Ross">Stanley Ralph Ross</a>, Stanford Sherman, and <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Hoffman_95f3.html" title="Charles Hoffman">Charles Hoffman</a> were script writers who generally leaned more toward camp comedy, and in Ross' case, sometimes outright slapstick and satire. Instead of producing a one-hour show, Dozier and Semple decided to have the show air twice a week in half-hour installments with a cliffhanger connecting the two episodes, echoing the old movie serials. Initially, Dozier wanted <a href="../../../t/y/_/Ty_Hardin_c990.html" title="Ty Hardin">Ty Hardin</a> to play Batman, but he was unavailable, filming <a href="../../../w/e/s/Westerns.html" title="Westerns">Westerns</a> in Europe.

<p>A <a href="../../../e/v/e/Everyplot.html" title="Everyplot">typical story</a> began with the story's villain (typically one of a short list of recurring villains) committing a crime, such as robbing a bank. This was followed by a scene inside Police Commissioner Gordon's office where he and Chief O'Hara would work out exactly which villain they were to face in that week's episode. Gordon would press a button on the Batphone, signaling a cut to Wayne Manor where Alfred, the butler, would answer the manor's Batphone (which sat on the desk in Bruce Wayne's study like a normal everyday telephone). Alfred would then interrupt Master Bruce Wayne and Dick Grayson - usually they would be found talking with Aunt Harriet - with a pretext to draw them away to answer the Batphone. Upon hearing of his enemy's schemes, Bruce would push a button concealed within a bust of <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shakespeare.html" title="Shakespeare">Shakespeare</a> that stood on his desk, opening a hidden door in a bookcase and revealing two poles. Wayne and Grayson would slide down the poles, and this was usually where the <a href="../../../t/i/t/Title_sequence.html" title="Title sequence">title sequence</a> would occur.</p>
<p>After the opening titles, the pair would emerge in the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Batcave.html" title="Batcave">Batcave</a> in full costume and jump into the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Batmobile.html" title="Batmobile">Batmobile</a>, Batman jumping into the driver's seat and Robin into the passenger's seat. Robin would say "<a href="../../../a/t/o/Atomic.html" title="Atomic">Atomic</a> <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battery_%28electricity%29.html" title="Battery (electricity)">batteries</a> to power, <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turbine.html" title="Turbine">turbines</a> to speed" and Batman would respond "Roger, ready to move out" and the two would race off out of the cave at high speed. As the Batmobile approached the mouth of the cave, a hinged barrier dropped down to allow the car to exit on to the road.</p>
<p>After arriving at Commissioner Gordon's office, the initial discussion of the crime usually led to the Dynamic Duo (Batman and Robin) conducting their investigation alone. In the investigation, a meeting with the villain would usually ensue with the heroes getting involved in a fight and the villain getting away, only to come back and fight again later in the show. Here, the villain would capture one or both of the heroes and place them in a <a href="../../../d/e/a/Deathtrap_%28plot_device%29.html" title="Deathtrap (plot device)">deathtrap</a> with a <a href="../../../c/l/i/Cliffhanger.html" title="Cliffhanger">cliffhanger</a> ending which was usually resolved in the first few minutes of the next episode.</p>
<p>The same pattern was repeated in the following episode until the villain was defeated.</p>

<p>In Season 2, the show suffered from repetition of its characters and formula. This, combined with Lorenzo Semple Jr. contributing fewer scripts and having less of an impact on the series, caused viewers to tire of the show, and for critics to complain, "If you've seen one episode of <i>Batman</i>, you've seen them all".</p>

<p>By Season 3, <a href="../../../n/i/e/Nielsen_Ratings_70fa.html" title="Nielsen Ratings">ratings</a> were falling and the future of the series seemed uncertain. A promotional short featuring <a href="../../../y/v/o/Yvonne_Craig_e3ac.html" title="Yvonne Craig">Yvonne Craig</a> as <a href="../../../b/a/t/Batgirl.html" title="Batgirl">Batgirl</a> and Tim Herbert as <a href="../../../k/i/l/Killer_Moth_8cd1.html" title="Killer Moth">Killer Moth</a> was produced. The short was convincing enough to pick up <i>Batman</i> for another season, and introduce Batgirl as a regular on the show as an attempt to attract more female viewers. Batgirl's alter ego was Barbara Gordon, a mild-mannered librarian at the Gotham Library, and her father was Commissioner Gordon.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> The show was reduced to once a week, with mostly self-contained episodes, although the next week's villain would be in a tag at the end of the episode, similar to a <a href="../../../s/o/a/Soap_opera.html" title="Soap opera">soap opera</a>.</p>
<p>Aunt Harriet was reduced to just two cameo appearances during the third season, due to <a href="../../../m/a/d/Madge_Blake_07ce.html" title="Madge Blake">Madge Blake</a> being in poor health. (Aunt Harriet was also mentioned in another episode, but was not seen; her absence was explained by her being in shock upstairs.) The nature of the scripts and acting started to enter into the realm of the <a href="../../../s/u/r/Surrealism.html" title="Surrealism">surreal</a>.</p>

<p>At the end of the third season, ABC planned cuts to the budget by eliminating Chief O'Hara <i>and</i> Robin, while making <a href="../../../b/a/t/Batgirl.html" title="Batgirl">Batgirl</a> Batman's full time partner. Both Dozier and West opposed this idea, and ABC cancelled the show a short time later. Weeks later, <a href="../../../n/b/c/NBC_89b7.html" title="NBC">NBC</a> offered to pick the show up for a fourth season and even restore it back to its twice a week format, if the sets were still available for use. However, NBC's offer came too late: Fox had already demolished the sets a week before. NBC didn't want to pay the $800,000 to rebuild, so the offer was withdrawn. <i>Batman</i> was replaced on ABC by the sitcom <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Second_Hundred_Years_%28TV_series%29_401c.html" title="The Second Hundred Years (TV series)">The Second Hundred Years</a></i>.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/t/Batman_%28TV_series%29_0877.html" title="Edit section: Theme music">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Theme music</span></h2>
<p>The title theme to <i>Batman</i> is one of the best-known theme tunes of all time. Composed by <a href="../../../n/e/a/Neal_Hefti_64ed.html" title="Neal Hefti">Neal Hefti</a>, the song is built around a minimalistic and foreboding but catchy guitar hook reminiscent of spy film scores and surf music. It is a simple <a href="../../../t/w/e/Twelve_bar_blues.html" title="Twelve bar blues">twelve bar blues</a> progression using only three chords until the <a href="../../../c/o/d/Coda.html" title="Coda">coda</a>. The lyrics to the theme consist of ten cries of 'Batman!', which were originally thought to be sung by a female chorus; however, Adam West's book 'Back to the Batcave' reveals the 'voices' to actually be instrumental, rather than vocal. These ten repetitions of "Batman!" were then followed by a coda of "Dadadadadadadadadadadadada...Batman!"</p>
<p>The theme was the most recorded song of 1966. In addition to <a href="../../../n/e/a/Neal_Hefti_64ed.html" title="Neal Hefti">Neal Hefti</a>'s original version, and the television soundtrack version by <a href="../../../n/e/l/Nelson_Riddle_6d91.html" title="Nelson Riddle">Nelson Riddle</a>, versions were covered by The Marketts, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Ventures_b837.html" title="The Ventures">The Ventures</a>, Dan and Dale, <a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Hirt_20c4.html" title="Al Hirt">Al Hirt</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Who_01bd.html" title="The Who">The Who</a>, and <a href="../../../j/a/n/Jan_and_Dean_b825.html" title="Jan and Dean">Jan and Dean</a>, who released an entire concept album titled <i>Jan &amp; Dean Meet Batman</i>. There were also versions by groups who seemed to exist solely for covering the song, such as "The Sensational Batboys" and "Bruce and the Robin Rockers".</p>
<p>The famously minimal song has been widely parodied in the decades since its debut, and remains a prominent pop-culture subject to this day. The theme has been re-recorded by dozens of artists, the most notable including <a href="../../../l/i/n/Link_Wray_5b29.html" title="Link Wray">Link Wray</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Kinks_a7b7.html" title="The Kinks">The Kinks</a>, <a href="../../../s/n/o/Snoop_Dogg_0d8a.html" title="Snoop Dogg">Snoop Dogg</a>, <a href="../../../5/0/_/50_Cent_813c.html" title="50 Cent">50 Cent</a> and <a href="../../../e/m/i/Eminem.html" title="Eminem">Eminem</a>, <a href="../../../r/2E/e/R.E.M._%28band%29_efbe.html" title="R.E.M.

<p>Many sports, music, and media personalities, and a number of <a href="../../../h/o/l/Hollywood.html" title="Hollywood">Hollywood</a> actors, looked forward to and enjoyed their appearances as villains on the <i>Batman</i> show. They were generally allowed to overact and enjoy themselves on a high-rated TV series, guaranteeing them considerable exposure (and thus boosting their careers). The most popular villains on the show included <a href="../../../c/e/s/Cesar_Romero_b004.html" title="Cesar Romero">Cesar Romero</a> as <a href="../../../j/o/k/Joker_%28comics%29.html" title="Joker (comics)">the Joker</a>; <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burgess_Meredith_5433.html" title="Burgess Meredith">Burgess Meredith</a> as <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penguin_%28comics%29.html" title="Penguin (comics)">The Penguin</a>; <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frank_Gorshin_57d2.html" title="Frank Gorshin">Frank Gorshin</a> as <a href="../../../r/i/d/Riddler.html" title="Riddler">The Riddler</a>; and <a href="../../../j/u/l/Julie_Newmar_b55c.html" title="Julie Newmar">Julie Newmar</a> as <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catwoman.html" title="Catwoman">Catwoman</a>. Other famous names from the "rogues gallery" in the comic book series made appearances on the show (notably The Mad Hatter), and some were taken from other <a href="../../../s/u/p/Superhero.html" title="Superhero">superheroes</a>, such as The Archer and The Puzzler (<a href="../../../s/u/p/Superman.html" title="Superman">Superman</a>'s villains) and The Clock King (<a href="../../../g/r/e/Green_Arrow_bfe4.html" title="Green Arrow">Green Arrow</a>'s villain). Many other villains were created especially for the TV show, and never did appear in the comic books (e.g., The Siren, Chandelle, Bookworm, <a href="../../../k/i/n/King_Tut_%28Batman%29_78dd.html" title="King Tut (Batman)">King Tut</a>, Lord Ffogg, Dr. Cassandra, and Louie the Lilac), while some were hybrids. The comics' Mr. Zero was renamed <a href="../../../m/r/2E/Mr._Freeze_bbb2.html" title="Mr. Freeze">Mr. Freeze</a> (a name change that was copied in the comics with lasting effect), and the comics' Brainy Barrows was reworked as <a href="../../../e/g/g/Egghead_%28Batman%29_bdfb.html" title="Egghead (Batman)">Egghead</a>. Other celebrities often appeared in scenes where the Dynamic Duo are scaling a building wall and the celebrity would suddenly open a window and have a short conversation with the superheroes.</p>
<p>Adam West enjoys the story that he was part of two of the 3 big B's of the 1960s, Batman, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Beatles_3737.html" title="The Beatles">The Beatles</a> and <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Bond_c2aa.html" title="James Bond">Bond</a>. West says he actually was invited to play Bond in <i><a href="../../../o/n/_/On_Her_Majesty%27s_Secret_Service_%28film%29_c2d0.html" title="On Her Majesty's Secret Service (film)">On Her Majesty's Secret Service</a></i> based on his popularity as Batman, but declined the role as he felt it should be played by a British actor (ironically, the role went to an Australian, <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Lazenby_4383.html" title="George Lazenby">George Lazenby</a>).</p>
<p>The popularity of the TV show did not translate well to the silver screen, however. A movie version of the TV show was released to theaters (see <a href="../../../b/a/t/Batman_%281966_film%29.html" title="Batman (1966 film)"><i>Batman</i> (1966 film)</a>), but it did not become a large box office hit, even though creatively, the movie was just as good as the first season episodes, and superior to most of the second and third season episodes. The movie continued to be profitably re-released to theaters, TV, and video for decades. Originally, the movie had been created to help sell the TV series abroad, but the success of the series in America sold itself, and the movie was brought out after season one had already been aired. In fact, the movie's budget allowed for the producers to build the Batboat and the Batcopter, which were used in the second and third seasons of the TV show.</p>
<p>The live-action TV show was extraordinarily popular. At the height of its popularity, it was the only prime time TV show other than <i><a href="../../../p/e/y/Peyton_Place_%28TV_series%29_2def.html" title="Peyton Place (TV series)">Peyton Place</a></i> to be broadcast twice in one week as part of its regular schedule, airing at 7:30 p.m. Wednesdays and Thursdays. Episodes of the show were often filmed as two-part <a href="../../../c/l/i/Cliffhanger.html" title="Cliffhanger">cliffhangers</a>, with each storyline beginning on Wednesday and ending on the Thursday night episode. At the very end of the Thursday night segment, a little tag featuring next week's villain would be shown, e.g.: "<i>Next week -- Batman jousts with The Joker again!</i>" (this started the second week of the series' run and continued until the end of season two). The first episode of a storyline would typically end with Batman and Robin being trapped in a ridiculous <a href="../../../d/e/a/Deathtrap_%28plot_device%29.html" title="Deathtrap (plot device)">deathtrap</a>, while the narrator (Dozier) would tell viewers to watch the next night with the repeated phrase: "<i>Tune in tomorrow — same Bat-time, same Bat-channel!</i>" Even now, many years after the show ceased production, this catch-phrase is still a long-running punchline in popular culture.</p>
<p>The show even contributed to the careers of two real-life New York City policemen, David Greenberg and Robert Hantz. This pair had a remarkable career as police officers, so much so that they were given street nicknames of "Batman and Robin". Their careers were fictionalized in the <a href="../../../1/9/7/1974_in_film.html" title="1974 in film">1974</a> movie <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Super_Cops_f593.html" title="The Super Cops">The Super Cops</a></i>.</p>

However, years after the series' impact faded, West found fame and respect among comic book and animation fans, who appreciated his work on the TV series. One of the more popular episodes of <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/Batman%7E_The_Animated_Series_3563.html" title="Batman: The Animated Series">Batman: The Animated Series</a></i> paid tribute to West with an episode titled "The Grey Ghost." In this episode, West played the role of an aging star of a superhero TV series Bruce Wayne watched as a child and would be inspired by as a crimefighter, who found new popularity with the next generation of fans. In addition, the most frequent visual influence is that later <a href="../../../b/a/t/Batmobile.html" title="Batmobile">Batmobiles</a> usually have a rear rocket thruster that usually fires as the car makes a fast start.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003_in_television.html" title="2003 in television">2003</a>, West and Ward reunited for a tongue-in-cheek <a href="../../../t/e/l/Television_movie.html" title="Television movie">telefilm</a> titled <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/Return_to_the_Batcave%7E_The_Misadventures_of_Adam_and_Burt_fcd9.html" title="Return to the Batcave: The Misadventures of Adam and Burt">Return to the Batcave: The Misadventures of Adam and Burt</a></i> which combined dramatized recreations of the filming of the original series (with younger actors standing in for the stars), with modern day footage of West and Ward searching for a stolen Batmobile. The film included cameo appearances by Newmar and Gorshin, as well as <a href="../../../l/e/e/Lee_Meriwether_1e47.html" title="Lee Meriwether">Lee Meriwether</a> who had played Catwoman in the 1966 film and <a href="../../../l/y/l/Lyle_Waggoner_4d9c.html" title="Lyle Waggoner">Lyle Waggoner</a>, who had been an early candidate for the role of Batman. The movie received high ratings and was released on DVD <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_2005.html" title="May 2005">May 2005</a>.</p>
<p>Despite much popular demand, no <a href="../../../d/v/d/DVD_1991.html" title="DVD">DVD</a> release of the series has to date occurred in North America, and this situation seems unlikely to be resolved in the near future. The problem as explained by the website <a href="http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/newsitem.cfm?NewsID=2714" class="external text" title="http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/newsitem.cfm?NewsID=2714" rel="nofollow">TVShowsonDVD.com</a> is that <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warner_Bros._b6cc.html" title="Warner Bros.">Warner Bros.</a> owns the Batman character, while <a href="../../../2/0/t/20th_Century_Fox_3a0c.html" title="20th Century Fox">20th Century Fox</a> owns the TV series (Warner did not take over DC until 1976), and the two companies have, to date, yet to come to an agreement regarding home video/DVD release of the series (it was later revealed that <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warner_Bros._b6cc.html" title="Warner Bros.">Warner Bros.</a> isn't involved). This is why no <a href="../../../v/h/s/VHS_078b.html" title="VHS">VHS</a> release of the series occurred, either. As a result, the 1966 feature film remains the only element of the original series officially available for non-broadcast viewing in North America.

<p>The television series' parodic tone stereotyped superhero adaptations for decades.</p>
<p>For many of the most famous later productions, a significant comedic tone was often used since it was assumed that the audience would never take the genre seriously on its own terms. For instance, while <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Donner_bf29.html" title="Richard Donner">Richard Donner</a> had the scripts for <i><a href="../../../s/u/p/Superman_%281978_film%29.html" title="Superman (1978 film)">Superman</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../s/u/p/Superman_II_cbf4.html" title="Superman II">Superman II</a></i> reworked to tone down the campy humor he objected to, he still made the villain, <a href="../../../l/e/x/Lex_Luthor_a258.html" title="Lex Luthor">Lex Luthor</a>, a comical figure accompanied with broader comic relief. On the audio commentary of the Superman DVDs, Donner explains that the original ending of <i>Superman The Movie</i> was to have been a Batman stye cliffhanger of General Zod, Ursa and Non escaping the Phantom Zone. By contrast, many fans complained that the comical tone of <i><a href="../../../s/u/p/Superman_III_d11e.html" title="Superman III">Superman III</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../s/u/p/Superman_IV_518e.html" title="Superman IV">Superman IV</a></i> was so broad that it ruined the dramatic quality of the stories.</p>
<p>This influence was shown on later television series such as <i><a href="../../../w/o/n/Wonder_Woman_%28TV_series%29_2bac.html" title="Wonder Woman (TV series)">Wonder Woman</a></i> which took on a campy tone. While occasionally other series like <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Incredible_Hulk_%28TV_series%29_ede7.html" title="The Incredible Hulk (TV series)">The Incredible Hulk</a></i> took a more dramatic tone, they were often stripped of all but the most central concepts of the character fit into a mundane setting.</p>
<p>The films <i><a href="../../../b/a/t/Batman_%281989_film%29.html" title="Batman (1989 film)">Batman</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../b/a/t/Batman_Returns_dae5.html" title="Batman Returns">Batman Returns</a></i> by <a href="../../../t/i/m/Tim_Burton_a41c.html" title="Tim Burton">Tim Burton</a> gained attention for their conscious rejection of the TV series stereotyped lighthearted tone. On the other hand, the films <i><a href="../../../b/a/t/Batman_Forever_1d7b.html" title="Batman Forever">Batman Forever</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../b/a/t/Batman_and_Robin_%281997_film%29_a5ad.html" title="Batman and Robin (1997 film)">Batman and Robin</a></i> by <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joel_Schumacher_bb0d.html" title="Joel Schumacher">Joel Schumacher</a> emulated the 1960s series' spirit with increasing consciousness. However, the latter film proved a <a href="../../../b/o/x/Box_office.html" title="Box office">box office</a> and critical embarrassment for <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warner_Brothers_0eef.html" title="Warner Brothers">Warner Brothers</a>.</p>
<p>That in turn discredited the campy approach and encouraged producers to see if Donner's more respectful approach to the source material could be more successful. The result is the <i><a href="../../../x/-/m/X-Men_5b6b.html" title="X-Men">X-Men</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../s/p/i/Spider-Man_f858.html" title="Spider-Man">Spider-Man</a></i> film series which have largely been significant popular and critical successes that the comic book fans have approved for their honoring of the source material while <i><a href="../../../b/a/t/Batman_Begins_16f4.html" title="Batman Begins">Batman Begins</a></i> found similar success restarting the <i>Batman</i> <a href="../../../f/i/l/Film_franchise.html" title="Film franchise">film franchise</a> with that artistic spirit in mind.</p>

<ul>
<li>Not counting six of the Penguin's henchmen who disintegrate or get blown up in the associated <i>Batman</i> theatrical movie, only four criminal characters die during the series: the Riddler's flunky Molly (played by Jill St. John in ep. 2), a fake "Commissioner Gordon" who gets shot, and two out-of-town gunmen who shoot at the Dynamic Duo but ended up killing themselves instead.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>A line spoken by Robin (<a href="../../../c/h/r/Chris_O%27Donnell_2e57.html" title="Chris O'Donnell">Chris O'Donnell</a>) in <i><a href="../../../b/a/t/Batman_Forever_1d7b.html" title="Batman Forever">Batman Forever</a></i> is a straight homage to Robin's catch-phrase. During the movie he says <i>"Holey Rusted Metal, Batman"</i> (referring to the island's land-scape which is made from rusted metal and has holes in it) which sounds intentionally similar to lines spoken by Robin beginning with the word "Holy" and ending with "Batman".</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>William Dozier and Howard Horowitz, who served as producers on the show, also play cameo roles in the final episode ("Minerva, Mayhem and Millionaires"). Both Dozier and Horowitz also had a cameo part in "Fine Finny Fiends/Batman makes the scenes" when brainwashed <a href="../../../a/l/f/Alfred_Pennyworth_d0b8.html" title="Alfred Pennyworth">Alfred Pennyworth</a> looks at a computer file of "Mug Shots"-and comments on <i>"two Criminal types"</i> {Dozier &amp; Horowitz}.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Several cast members recorded records tied in to the series. Adam West released a single titled "Miranda", a country-tinged pop song that he actually performed in costume during live appearances in the 1960s. Frank Gorshin released a song titled "The Riddler" which was composed and arranged by <a href="../../../m/e/l/Mel_Torme_400f.html" title="Mel Torme">Mel Torme</a>. The track captures Gorshin's insane portrayal perfectly. Burgess Meredith recorded a spoken word single called "The Escape" backed with "The Capture", which was The Penguin narrating his recent crime spree to a jazz beat.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../l/e/s/Lesley_Gore_139a.html" title="Lesley Gore">Lesley Gore</a> , who plays "Pussycat" (one of <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catwoman.html" title="Catwoman">Catwoman</a>'s henchwomen) , was a popular singer of the day with hits such as "<a href="../../../i/t/27/It%27s_My_Party_%28song%29_a57a.html" title="It's My Party (song)">It's My Party</a>". Gore was also the niece of Howie Horwitz, one of the show's producers.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>At least one of the show's villains was based on a real-life criminal. <a href="../../../s/h/e/Shelley_Winters_92e3.html" title="Shelley Winters">Shelley Winters</a> plays "Ma Parker", a woman who commits a series of crimes in Gotham City along with her children (and who actually manages to take over the Gotham State Penitentiary for a while). Her name was taken from <a href="../../../m/a/_/Ma_Barker_5296.html" title="Ma Barker">Ma Barker</a>, who headed a real-life criminal family in the 1930s.</li>

</ul>
<ul>
<li>Only two of the series guest villains ever discovered Batman's true identity: <a href="../../../e/g/g/Egghead_%28Batman%29_bdfb.html" title="Egghead (Batman)">Egghead</a> by deductive reasoning, and <a href="../../../k/i/n/King_Tut_%28Batman%29_78dd.html" title="King Tut (Batman)">King Tut</a> on two occasions (once with a bug on the Batmobile and once by accidentally mining into the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Batcave.html" title="Batcave">Batcave</a>).
