<p>Hey, I watched this movie on my VCR a year ago, &amp; I wouldn't say it was <i>that</i> bad of a movie. Then again, I finished off a six-pack of beer watching it, so somewhere in the middle of my viewing I found all of the implausible parts simply funny. And I have to admit it had amazing special effects -- but special effects didn't save the Disney failure <b>The Black Hole</b> either. -- <a href="../../../l/l/y/User%7ELlywrch_461d.html" title="User:Llywrch">llywrch</a> 02:06 Nov 23, 2002 (UTC), who drinks a lot less now.</p>

<p>I gave it a shot at NPOV. I don't think the movie critic lines belong in there. If someone can find some links to reviews that will probably be fine, though we should find at least one good review (if it exists&#160;:). Also Scientology was linked many times unnecessarily. I hated the movie too (never read the novel), but there is no need for an encyclopedic article to make value judgements like that.

<p>This movie was never going to win an academy award, but the way it was attacked was not really justified. Was Escape From New York really any better? What about that "Soldier" movie Kurt Russell made? What about all the crap movies Sylvester Stallone made? If it hadn't been written by Hubbard, and starred a scientologist, I doubt the movie would have been ridiculed the way it was. -- -- <a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7ECommking_d6d1.html" title="User:Commking">Commking</a> 24 Apr 2005</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, if movies that weren't written by Hubbard or starring Scientologists never got ridiculed, or only got ridiculed very rarely, that'd be support for that theory. However, I can name at least ten movies that have been widely panned without even breaking a sweat -- Gigli, Glitter, From Justin To Kelly, Santa With Muscles, Catwoman, just off the top of my head -- and I bet you can too. There seem to be two factors that cause the ridicule-meter to peg into the red, and Battlefield:Earth met both of them: first, it was highly hyped, with big prime-time TV ads telling us what an incredibly great movie B:E was. Even when a movie is merely mediocre, hyping it as really great is almost certain to get it ridiculed.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Second... well, it <i>isn't</i> just mediocre, in the mode of Stallone's crap movie <i>Cobra</i> (haven't seen <i><a href="../../../e/s/c/Escape_from_New_York_d315.html" title="Escape from New York">Escape from New York</a></i> or <i><a href="../../../s/o/l/Soldier_%28film%29.html" title="Soldier (film)">Soldier</a></i>, sorry...) It <i>is</i> really <i>bad</i>. I say this as a student of bad movies -- even as I'm typing this I'm watching <i>Double Agent 73</i>. What makes it so bad? There's the use of silly vocabulary like "picto-cameras" (cameras) and "man-animal" (man) to make it more 'science-fictiony.' There's the laughably bad plot holes -- skipping over the question of whether cavemen could learn to pilot Harrier jets so fast, the plausibility that unscrambled Harrier jets would be in perfect flying condition after a <i>thousand years without maintenance</i> is ridiculous. So is the idea that Terl would <i>notice</i> that the cavemen who were supposed to be mining gold from the ground for him apparently managed, without any smelting equipment, to smelt it into perfect gold bars -- and would <i>fail to investigate</i> this impossibility just because he's told "well, we know a Psychlo of your refinement wouldn't have it any other way!" Then there's the quality of the direction -- <i>why</i> did Roger Christian think it was necessarily to film 30-50% of the film's scenes with a tilted camera? <i>Why</i>? And didn't anyone realize that by making the Psychlos <i>so</i> over-the-top evil, they were making them laughable, not frightening? I still can't think of the "cow legs" scene without laughing.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Is <i>Battlefield:Earth</i> the worst movie of all time? No. But in terms of how much money and talent was wasted to make such a bad movie, it's very impressive. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 15:14, 24 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I guess that is where we disagree. Why should a movie critique, take into account the preceding hype, and budget? Why not just review the movie as presented? If not, does that therefore mean a good movie suddenly becomes a great movie because it has a lot of hype and big budget? What garbage. The critique should focus on the movie itself, and the hollywood hoopla is not relevant. It was definitely a bad movie. A silly movie. Like many others before and after, it was bad. This one didn't really stand out as a glaring example against all the other films you mentioned. Then why was it attacked with such venom when the others were not? That I hadn't seen before.</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>For the record, I don't like Scientology. But here, I can only only assume Scientology or some sort of politics had somehow become an influencing factor to the critics, who then saw that as somehow relating to the quality (or lack of it) of this movie. Whether you like Scientology or not should not influence a film review. Until now I just thought film critics were out of touch, and didn't really relate to the man in the street. But now, they show themselves in a different light. Battlefield Earth is an important film, because it showed us what film reviewers are REALLY capable of. <a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7ECommking_d6d1.html" title="User:Commking">Commking</a> 25 Apr 2005</dd>

<dd>Yeah, I think we need to agree to disagree here. Knowing now that you're talking about film critics in particular puts the matter in a different context -- but I don't see why it should be out of bounds or "garbage" to see a particular movie in the context of its advertising and its budget. And again, to return to your first point -- plenty of movies have come in for extra knocks because the advertising designed to sell the movie as a product was deceptive or excessive, or because the movie had a budget that would have allowed it to do wonderful things and did crappy things instead. A majority of these films have had no Scientologists prominently involved, so your theory that it only happens because of Scientology connections doesn't seem to hold up. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 23:15, 25 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Someone wrote that the species name "Psychlo" 'may be' derived from "psychiatrist". I think it's just about irrefutable. "Psychlo" and "Catrist" from a writer with a famous bee in his bonnet about psychiatrists? not exactly hard to figure out. =)</p>
<p>Second, the description confuses me, because it seems to use "Psychlos" and "Catrists" as synonyms for the same thing. I was under the impression that the "Psychlos" are the alien race, and later in the story than the movie gets to, it's discovered that the Psychlos are being manipulated by a medical cult called the "Catrists".

<dd>in the book, ORIGINALLY the species wasn't called "psychos", nor was their planet, and "psyclo" and "catrist" were pretty much synonymous, but then they named the whole species and the planet after themselves, and then the catrists started pretty much using that name (catrists) for themselves, rather than "psyclos". <a href="../../../g/r/i/User%7EGringo300_19ab.html" title="User:Gringo300">Gringo300</a> 02:32, 31 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The last paragraph under heading "The Book" suggests that copies sold at retail might have made their way back onto store shelves, thus inflating sales numbers.

<p>The section stating that Scientologists were told or ordered to buy the book so that it would be a bestseller is ridiculous. Enemies of the Church have been spouting lies like this for decades.

<p>I have a copy of this book which is printed by 'New Era Publications International' - not a publisher included in the list. That's probably a minor issue I guess it is a scientology publisher as those other ones are listed?</p>

<p>The following paragraph has been repeatedly added to the article:</p>
<p>"While this book had been released many years before Hubbard founded Scientology (earlier in the piece someone wrote that the book was first published in 1980--this time line does not jibe), the storyline of Battlefield Earth and the Story of how the Thetans came to be on Earth are almost identical. It was once rumoured that Hubbard started the Scientology cult as an attempt to raise revenue for his book."</p>
<p>The first claim, that the book had been released many years before Hubbard founded Scientology, is completely untrue. The book was written and first published in 1980. This makes the last claim, that Scientology was started to raise revenue for the book, even more ludicrous than it is on the face of it (since when did one need to raise revenue to <i>write a book</i>??) The remaining claim, that the storyline of Battlefield Earth and the story of how thetans came to be on Earth are "almost identical", is also quite obviously false to anyone who is reasonably familiar with both; one can stretch for similarities but they cannot in any reasonable analysis be considered "almost identical".

<p>There may be, unfounded, links between this MOVIE and scientology. However, whether these links are true or not, dose not determine this movie's inclusion in the Scientology Series.</p>
<p>This is a movie. It is not a significant part of scientology.</p>
<p>This article is part of the movie series of wikipedia articles. Not part of the scientology series.</p>
<p>AS such, since the scientology claims to this movie are disputed, the scientology series template CANNOT be used. However, hypothesised links between this movie and scientology can be written about within the article, as long as the spirit of the article is on the movie itself and is not lost in a debate of scientology.</p>
<p>As an anology:</p>
<p>The article on <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Passion_of_the_Christ_5e42.html" title="The Passion of the Christ">The Passion of the Christ</a>, does not include the "Chirsitanity Series" wiki template. Even though its connections to christianty were much more evident then this movies connections to scientology.</p>
<p>The debate here is not whether this movie was influenced by scientology. The important fact is, this article IS NOT suitable for inclusion in the scientology series wiki template.</p>

<dd>Please sign your comments. Personally, I'm not sure that the Scientology template belongs on this <b>book</b> article. (It's primarily a book after all, and probably part of a few book series as well.) There are connections between BE and Scientology and these are well founded, justifying links in the article.

<dd>This is pretty much my conclusion as well. Bmgoau does seem to be forgetting that there was a book as well as a movie, and the fact that the book lays a very thin veil over its Scientology content does not make that content only "hypothesized". But with that being said, this simply isn't a "core" article on Scientology; if we place the template on every single article with <i>some</i> connection to Scientology it simply duplicates what the category system is already doing. So I support removing the template. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 16:48, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

In keeping with wikipedia's standards, this article should have a major overhaul or else get a NPOV tag. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 4.234.42.200 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_4.234.42.200_631a.html" title="Special:Contributions/4.234.42.200">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

<dd>I'd be interested in knowing why you think that, by Wikipedia's standards, there is a "HUGE" anti-Hubbard slant to this. What do you think is missing? -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 19:55, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't know about anything missing but I agree that there is a large slant to this article. I am going to put a cite needed tag on everything that should either be removed or cited. --<a href="../../../9/8/p/User%7E98percenthuman.html" title="User:98percenthuman">User:98percenthuman</a></p>
<p>I actually like the book, meandering pulp fiction nonsense as it may be. The complete lack of a plot section is rather worrisome. POV tag it is. <a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThumperward_1d10.html" title="User:Thumperward">Chris Cunningham</a> 23:09, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree. I came across the article a few days ago and have been filling out the infoboxes, but it certainly needs more work. -- <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisO_f9d7.html" title="User:ChrisO">ChrisO</a> 23:16, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Does anyone support <a href="../../../v/o/s/User%7EVossman_a523.html" title="User:Vossman">Vossman</a> (<a href="../../../v/o/s/User_talk%7EVossman_fb84.html" title="User talk:Vossman">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Vossman_bb4a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Vossman">contribs</a>)'s undiscussed decision to split this article off into two separate articles? I don't, frankly. Since the film is an adaptation of the novel and a fairly faithful one it makes more sense to discuss the two together. If the novel and the film had had less connection, or if the article had been an unwieldy size, a breakup might have made sense, but neither of those was the case. Unless someone has some really good reasoning to present, I'll be recombining the articles soon. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 17:46, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Actually this does seem to be standard practice for films-of-books. Compare e.g. <a href="../../../a/t/o/Atonement_%28novel%29.html" title="Atonement (novel)">Atonement (novel)</a>/<a href="../../../a/t/o/Atonement_%28film%29.html" title="Atonement (film)">Atonement (film)</a>. I don't think it's an unreasonable split, and it does stop the individual articles from getting too long - shorter is better. -- <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisO_f9d7.html" title="User:ChrisO">ChrisO</a> 18:12, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The fact that the film is so loosely based on the film as to feel like it was written first and then rebranded is also a consideration. That said, a split is a bit premature right now. <a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThumperward_1d10.html" title="User:Thumperward">Chris Cunningham</a> 20:38, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I am a split artist. When I find pages that get so freaking long about unrelated material, I split them up. That said, I firmly believe in <b>be bold</b> policy. Yeah, I could have posted a do you want me to break this up? But by the time the votes were in I'd quit caring. I felt that the book and film though sharing the same story are completely unrelated the film dives into its production, poor box office, bad critic reception, and worst film ever status while book covers the plot, its relation to scientology, and its literary aspects. I just didn't feel they have alot of overlap. If you disagree, be bold and switch it back. --<a href="../../../v/o/s/User%7EVossman_a523.html" title="User:Vossman">vossman</a> 21:32, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think the length of each article, combined with the fact that the movie is actually quite divergent from the book in significant ways, combined with precedent (<i><a href="../../../i/n/_/In_Cold_Blood_08a5.html" title="In Cold Blood">In Cold Blood</a></i> gets separate articles for book and for film, for example), all point to Vossman's edit as doing the right thing. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipediatrix_b60b.html" title="User:Wikipediatrix">wikipediatrix</a> 00:13, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In that case I'd definitely like to see more added to the account of the novel explaining what was actually <i>different</i>, rather than just skipped for time. Obviously even covering only the first half of the book they were still going to have to gloss over stuff (especially stuff that's already mentioned in the article, like Johnny teaming with the lamas and highlanders) but if there's any truth to the claim that the two are so different it feels like the movie was "written first and then rebranded" then we really need much more about the book. I'd always heard that it was a very faithful adaptation considering that they could only turn about two hours' worth of book into a movie. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 01:38, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
