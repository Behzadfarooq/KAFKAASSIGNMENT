<p>An anon editor made several changes that I was forced to revert for these reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Broken links. This editor might not like the form of names used to refer to Attila, Aetius, and Theodorid, but in changing the names broke working links to existing articles. My reversion also orphaned a stub this editor created -- General Florentius -- but I have no independent confirmation that this person existed.</li>
<li>Numbers on either side. I believe the current numbers are too low, but the new numbers are just unbelievable; the entire Roman Empire at its zenith could barely maintain a half million men under arms in all of its territories! If I remember my secondary sources about this period correctly, the Western Empire at this time barely had 30,000 men all told under arms, &amp; the Goths perhaps twice this number. Unless an editor can <a href="../../../c/i/t/Cite_sources.html" title="Cite sources">cite sources</a> for better numbers, I feel it's best to keep the older numbers which are at least plausible.</li>
<li>Number of casualties. In any case, this would be an estimate; the new numbers are unsourced, &amp; unless we accept the anon's new numbers, implausible.</li>
<li>Numbers quoted from Jordanes &amp; Hydatius. I'm responsible for quoting these numbers in the first place, &amp; I have no idea where these new numbers came from. A quick Google confirms my number for Jordanes; I need to look at my copy of Mommsen's edition at home, but I doubt I could misquote Hydatius' figures. -- <a href="../../../l/l/y/User%7ELlywrch_461d.html" title="User:Llywrch">llywrch</a> 16:41, 6 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>My dispute with the anon editor continues, but with no word from this contributor. Nevertheless, still hoping to hear something, since it appears the date of the battle has been wrong all along wrong. -- <a href="../../../l/l/y/User%7ELlywrch_461d.html" title="User:Llywrch">llywrch</a> 23:28, 7 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>There seems to be some difficulty with the date of the battle.</p>
<p>The summary table shows the date as <b>June 20</b>.</p>
<p>The text of the article says, "The two forces at last met at the Catalaunian Fields on <b>July 20</b>, a date first proposed by J.B. Bury and since accepted by consensus."</p>
<p>The battle shows up in the list of events happening on <b>September 20</b>. -- User:DSYoungEsq 20 Sep 2005</p>
<hr />
<p>I have seached the web and can find numerous sites claiming the 20 June and 20 September dates, but cannot find any (except for Wikipedia mirrors) that claim the 20 July date. For what it's worth, the French Wikipeida has it listed as 20 June</p>

<dd>I don't remember where I found the "20 July" date; I could have written it as a mistake. If Bury states that it is 20 June, please fix it. (I see that you have already.) -- <a href="../../../l/l/y/User%7ELlywrch_461d.html" title="User:Llywrch">llywrch</a> 18:45, 20 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello. Thompson is much too cynical there. The Geloni and Neuri are believed by large number of scholars to be the proto-Balts, with Geloni coming down to Galindi among the Prussians and the Neuri going into the east Balts, who have a large number of ner- names. They once extended down the Dnepr and were found on the Volga in historical times. The Slavs eventually defeated them all.</p>
<p>A lot of people who find names they do not recognize want to just throw them out. I believe the tendency is against that now unless you can find pretty good evidence of the corruption or distortion of the names. The Bastarnae and Bructeri certainly did not disappear hundreds of years earlier or at all for that matter. Chalons was only 451 you know. Just about all the people said to be in place by earlier sources were still in place except those driven west by the Huns.</p>
<p>His numbers also are at variance with what the mainstream thinks. According to him there were only 30,000-50,000 on a side, and yet they lost 15,000 just in a "skirmish". Well, you don't lose half your command in a skirmish. Sorry.</p>
<p>Most of the figures I've seen are as high as 1/2 mil on a side. The lines stretched beyond the horizon and apart from a few focal points the battle was not in anyone's control. There was so much mud the troops were ineffective in it. All the peoples of Europe were there from the Baltic coast to the Black Sea, from the shores of Britain to the Volga river and beyond. This was not the minor battle the "authority" leads you to believe. The future destiny of all Europe rested on it.</p>
<p>So, figures concerning the actual Roman troops do not have a major bearing, as most of the troops were European in general. This was not a specifically Roman battle. All the peoples of Europe were making common cause, even those who previously had been mortal enemies. At the end of that battle Aetius could have united all of Europe just by his personal charisma but he chose to let it go because he feared his new friends.</p>
<p>In conclusion I would just like to point out you can make any event simple and clear by excising data you don't like or can't explain, but then you have a historicity problem. The idea is to capture the real event.</p>
<p>While supporting small I am not contributing for the moment because I am working on something else. Eventually though I will get to here more formallly.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I can't say I regard the article as an especially good or logically complete one. For one thing there seems to be confusion about primary and secondary sources. A primary source is a witness to the event, not just an ancient writer. For another thing, the article seems to want to bat around secondary sources instead of the material on which their opinions are based.<a href="../../../b/o/t/User%7EBotteville_e5b2.html" title="User:Botteville">Dave</a> 14:33, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Responding in order:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Which scholars believe that the "Geloni and Neuri are believed by large number of scholars to be the proto-Balts"? My point is not to say that Thompson is the definitive voice on the identities of the various peoples who were involved, but that unless you happen to have close to hand author's names &amp; their publications for verification, you are likely quoting from memory, &amp; I've recently have been reminded that one's memory can be fallible. And BTW, the original poster was claiming that the "Gelons" came from the "Vorskla River" -- which is in the Ukraine -- yet now you state that they were proto-Balts. Even if I accept your identification, it won't help confirm his assertion.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Then you state that "the mainstream" doesn't accept his estimates for the number of combatants. Well, I admit that the size of the invading armies of this period are very much in dispute -- but I'm not sure just who you mean by "the mainstream". I'd say that the late Thompson is one member of this mainstream body of scholars. So who else would you include in this group? I am sincerely interested in knowing, because the more voices that can be added to this article, the better it will become.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>However, I have to wonder when you state that "most of the figures I've seen are as high as 1/2 mil on a side." One of the handicaps military forces have to deal with is their supply lines -- &amp; at this time, almost all armies lived off the land, taking from the local peasants &amp; nobility everything that they ate or fed their horses. The reference to what the Roman Empire could support is an indication of just how many soldiers this subsistence economy coulc support if their provisions were provided from the peasantry in an organized manner: in other words, this is a indication of the upper limit of how many soldiers Gaul could sustain at the time. Maybe this part of Europe could support up to twice as many in exceptional conditions -- such as a predatory force like the Hunnish armies slaughtering its way across the land. But the hard truth is that any landscape can only support a finite number of soldiers exploiting it &amp; its inhabitants -- exceed this limit, &amp; unless you are importing the needed food &amp; materials from another location the excess will grow hungry or sicken &amp; desert or die. (N.J.G. Pounds published an estimate for the population of Gaul during the Antonine dynasty of between 6-10 million people; adding a half-million more mouths would turn much of Gaul into empty wildernesses -- something that clearly did not happen.) Even if Attila left with half a million men, disease &amp; lack of food would have reduced his following to at most a tenth of what he started with. Ethiopia fielded an army that mostly lived off the land in the 1890s, &amp; had difficulty keeping 80,000 - 120,000 men in the field for several weeks. I doubt Attila could keep this large of a force together for themany months he campaigned in Gaul.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>For what it's worth, I consider Thompson's estimate on the low side. And just because Jordanes stated 15,000 men were killed in skirmishing the night before does not mean we can guestimate from that figure just how many total combatants were involved. We don't know how he came upon these figures -- whether he had access to the official military records or based these numbers on hearsay -- or something in between. But the principle of NPOV suggests that I include his figures, as wrong as they may be.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I'm not sure what you mean when you protest about "confusion about primary and secondary sources". I think it's quite clear to any reader that Hodgkin &amp; Thompson both lived many centuries after the event. Can you provide some specific examples?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>And your charge that either I -- or the other editors who have contributed to this article -- have "excised" any information is offensive; I'd like to direct your attention to <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>. Again, I admit that this article needs more work -- but every Wikipedian freely admit that even <a href="../../../f/a/_/WP%7EFA_2cf5.html" title="WP:FA">Featured Articles</a> could be improved upon. I have put as much information as I can provide sources for in this article at the time, &amp; have not knowingly omitted any information I found. I regret this article left you confused, but have to wonder about your sincerity. You admit you're busy with other matters, too busy to provide any additional sources, yet have enough time to leave a long rant on the talk page.

<p>Food restrictions. Verbruggen (The Art of War in Western Europe during the Middle Ages) points this out for the Medieval warfare, but states that smaller armies of early knights could achieve more than huge Roman legions. The problem was food available on the march and in enemy territory, so keep to the plausible small numbers. Experience shows that the only trustworthy account of troopstrength are paylists. <a href="../../../w/a/n/User%7EWandalstouring_ea93.html" title="User:Wandalstouring">Wandalstouring</a> 19:17, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>While both strategically and operationally this battle appears to have been a wash, from a tatical stand point, this has to be considered a Roman &amp; allied tactical victory due to them holding the ground at the end let alone the other side in full retreat afterwords. It would also be nice to have estimated casulaty figures on both sides. Jon 13:40, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hello. The battle was no wash at all. The strategy was to unite all the peoples of Europe to stop the HUns. It was a great success. The only tactical wash I saw was when the Alans ran off. They got around it. This was a great propaganda defeat for Attila also. The myth of his invincibility was shattered. He died soon after but the the Goths and the Alans rose and drove the Huns east to the Volga (and Bulgaria).<a href="../../../b/o/t/User%7EBotteville_e5b2.html" title="User:Botteville">Dave</a> 14:46, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It is true that Bury viewed this Battle differently from virtually every other major historian -but his was a distinctly minority viewpoint, one that clashed directly with Sir Edward Shepard Creasy's, and Gibbon, both considered superior historians by most of their peers, though Bury was quite gifted. Time has not seen the majority of historians side with Bury either. The article needs to reflect Bury's view, but present it for what it is - the minority view of the battle. <a href="../../../o/l/d/User%7EOldwindybear_14b1.html" title="User:Oldwindybear">old windy bear</a> 09:48, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Since creating this article near the beginning of Wikipedia, I have been defending this article alone from some obvious POV pushing -- check the article history for examples -- &amp; I removed the section headers becuse I felt they were needlessly POV. And please note carefully, OldWindyBear: I otherwise left practically untouched much of the material you added, &amp; I want to state for the record that I grateful for your adding quotations from Gibbon &amp; Creasy to this article, something that it has badly needed. However, note that I also corrected one extensive quotation you added, which incorporated existing Wikipedia text into that quotation; I don't feel that my edits left this section "a hopeless mess", it was merely adjusting how we presented the opinions of historians from a construct rival camps over the importance of this battle to a simple list.</dd>

<dd>Having written all of that, I must add that I'm a little puzzled at your post above. I don't mean to start an edit war, or to violate the guidelines at <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">WP:OWN</a>, but didn't you make the changes you are now defending without any attempt to reach a consensus yourself? It is clear that they greatly changed the emphasis &amp; conclusions of the article; I was simply trying to protect the current state of the article without knowledge of what your intentions for the article were. And please note that my comment to my own edits was that you were introducing a measure of argument into the article which would be better placed in this Talk space. I <i>am</i> trying to reach a consensus on this article, &amp; I would rather have someone obviously as knowledgable as you help in improving it -- or at least removing some of the questionable edits that have been made to this article -- rather than have us both fight over its contents.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>But I must point out something that has bothered me about this battle since I started to examine it in detail for a Wikipedia article: how can it be considered <i>decisive</i> when two of the major participating nations effectively vanished within a few decades? On one side the Huns had disappeared as a national entity, while on the other the Western Roman Empire continued to disintegrate? Of the two prominent authorities you cite, who argue that this was an important battle, one wrote over 200 years ago &amp; before the judgement of modern research, while the other is not an expert in the history of this period. Is there another historian (beside Arther Ferrill, who is cited in this article but about whom I know very little) who argues that this was a decisive &amp; major battle? -- <a href="../../../l/l/y/User%7ELlywrch_461d.html" title="User:Llywrch">llywrch</a> 03:42, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd><a href="../../../l/l/y/User%7ELlywrch_461d.html" title="User:Llywrch">llywrch</a> First, there are two issues here, and I will address each separately. The first is your conclusions are original research. With respect, I disagree with your conclusions precisely because you incorporate POV into the article. When you say, as you do above, "how can it be considered <i>decisive</i> when two of the major participating nations effectively vanished within a few decades?" Bluntly, and I don't mean to be offensive, in fact, I may agree with you, our opnions are irrelevant! You have incorporated your opinion, and original research. That simply cannot be done, even where, as I think yours are, the intentions are good ones, to ask good questions. (I do want to make clear you put a great deal of work in this article, which I salute, and would prefer to work with you! I believe your intentions good ones, and see no reason we cannot work on this article together to put it as NPOV) But, we have to rely on the experts, which brings us to point two, the experts...</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>As to your statements on Gibbon, note that even today his research is considered peerless, and he is the definitive historian of the Roman Empire, period. Bury is also dated, if you consider time as a definitive measure of a historian's greatness, which I do not. (his great work was published first in 1889, then republished a dozen years later). As to your statement that Creasy was not a historian expert in the period, Creasy is acknowledged - and I can easily get you the sources - as the greatest military historian of all time! And his work was only a few decades before Bury's. Ferrill and Herbert are both recognized experts. I don't want an edit war either, but the blunt fact is, among recognized experts, Bury - who I explained to you on my talk page - is a great historian, is ALONE in believing Chalons not to be of macrohistorical importance. I tried to acknowledge Bury's theories, as the minority view, which it is, without taking from the accepted majority view, which Gibbon and Creasy, Herbert, Ferrill, Grant, Norwich, (the most widely read historian on Bzyantium, period!) all represent. (and the later two are modern historians, again, however, I do not believe that Bury or Gibbon, or Creasy, is rendered obsolete by the passage of time; their work to me is as relevant today as when it was published!)</dd>

<dd>I put the sections back without discussion because no one posted the changes here, and the article was unreadable. Frankly, I should have looked at the edit history and posted a message to you, and I apologize. I did not mean to diminish your work on this article, which is considerable. But I honestly felt the article without sectioning was unreadable for non-experts. (Obviously you are quite knowledgable, but those not I felt would be lost) I will gladly submitt this to a peer review, if you would like, but would prefer to work with you to correct any disagreements.</dd>

<dd>I hope this explains my edits. If you wish a peer review, I will gladly accept one. I can cite you numerous other sources, Grant, and others, who believe Chalons of macrohistorical importance. Bury stands alone among respected historians believing it was not. It does not matter whether you or I agree with him, the majority of historians do not.

<dd>Sorry for the delay in responding, OldWindyBear, but I've been using the time thinking about my response -- primarily about your charge of "original research". It bothers me in part because I helped to create this rule, but also because I believe that there are cases where we should not simply repeat the opinion of authorities on a subject. You could consider what this a case of informed reporting, rather than to simply copy the source without further reflection.</dd>

<dl>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The primary problem with original research -- as I see it -- is not that it produces novel or unexpected results, but that it forces the person creating it to discard all other possible opinions on the subject. And this is shown by the fact almost all who insist on introducing original reseach into Wikipedia claim that what they have found is "the truth" -- &amp; further claim that by not accepting their contributions that we are "suppressing the truth." However, it is a different matter to point out obvious contradictions or mistakes in these same authorities -- which is what I tried to do in this article.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>One can quote all of the authorities one wants to say that this battle was decisive -- yet of the three major nations involved, one was a decaying Empire that continued to crumble after the battle, while another was an emphemeral threat that melted away with the death of their king. Looked at this way, this event hardly appears to have the justification for all of the importance it is said to have. To state only that Gibbon, Creasy, Grant, Norwich, <i>et alia</i> all say it was important glosses over this crux. Unfortunately, here I feel we encounter the barrier of original research: pointing out the problem keeps us on one side, but attempting to answer it (beyond the fortunate discovery of published research that can be added to Wikipedia) crosses this line.</dd>

<dd>I hope you see what I have tried to do -- &amp; why I was trying to rework your contributions to acknowledge this problem. Your contirbutions made it appear that we two editors were fighting over whether this battle <i>was</i> decisive -- whereas I was trying make t he point that there is a problem in making that statement. Perhaps the problem can be resolved by stating the battle was a strategic victory (as Wandalstouring proposes), or by better understanding the arguments Creasy &amp; the others have made. (I reread Gibbon last night, particularly the chapter where he narrates Atilla's campaigns in Gaul &amp; Rome, but failed to find where he reflects on the importance of this battle, so I can't say whether he truly felt it was a decisive event or was simply repeating received wisdom.) But I can't accept that to describe this contradiction falls under the rule forbidding original research. Although I am well aware that this could become a loophole allowing the cranks &amp; kooks to push their POVs into Wikipedia, insisting that Wikipedians withhold all judgement on the material can only drive away the people we most want to contribute to our project. -- <a href="../../../l/l/y/User%7ELlywrch_461d.html" title="User:Llywrch">llywrch</a> 22:34, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><a href="../../../l/l/y/User%7ELlywrch_461d.html" title="User:Llywrch">llywrch</a> Greetings! Actually, you and I are in agreement on this battle. I personally don't think it can be called "decisive" for world history. Where I was caught was that I felt I had to cite the historians, the bulk of whom do believe it was decisive. Wandalstouring gave me a fine way out. Like you, I have Gibbon, so I reread it also, and he essentially praises Aetius and quotes other historians other than a single statement to the effect this was the last great victory of the Western Empire. Though Bury is a lonely voice, I think he is correct. I think you did a good job of reworking my wording, and I agree with Wandalstouring that this can be viewed as a strategic victory since it denied Attila his long term goal of fully subjugating Gaul, yet was a tactical wash because both sides survived the Battle essentially intact except for horrific losses on both sides. I think you make an excellent point that this article points to a real contradiction involving the bann on original research, and I am open to any solution you can devise. I personally think Creasy was wrong, that this was NOT one of history's most decisive battles. But for some reason, (Creasy being regarded as the greatest all time western military historian?) modern historians tend to echo his feelings, witness the findings of Grant, Norwich, et al, on this battle! Please keep me appraised if you figure a way to get around the bann on original research in such cases as this, where real contradictions of history make the findings of historians patently absurd. Yet I am also aware of the danger opening such a door might bring - there are more nuts with POV than there are students of history wanting historically accurate articles. <a href="../../../o/l/d/User%7EOldwindybear_14b1.html" title="User:Oldwindybear">old windy bear</a> 18:01, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The "no original research" has already a mousehole. I use it if I disagree with all sources. Read what the argumentation is based upon and then find evident facts that are not considered, but stated in reliable sources. Soon you can arise some questions and get a better fitting formulation. OK, it is close to the edge and you must know your topic. <a href="../../../w/a/n/User%7EWandalstouring_ea93.html" title="User:Wandalstouring">Wandalstouring</a> 19:02, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><a href="../../../w/a/n/User%7EWandalstouring_ea93.html" title="User:Wandalstouring">Wandalstouring</a> I am willing to do that. I never personally agreed with the generally accepted historical view of this battle. I simply did not see a way out of citing the accepted historical view. But you are right, if you simply ask the right questions, and dig for the right supporting facts, and avoid simply parroting the accepted interpretration, you can create a better fitting analysis, just as you did here. I had simply not thought out of the box enough on this, and you had. <a href="../../../o/l/d/User%7EOldwindybear_14b1.html" title="User:Oldwindybear">old windy bear</a> 20:05, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Like I was saying in a section I've added because I missed this debate (probably the section title wasn't suggestive enough for me to read it&#160;:P), Bury is not alone in doubting the macrohistorical importance, while a certain number of historians of Roman Empire, Late Antiquity, etc. simply refrain from emphasizing the macrohistorical importance. Lucien Musset (1965) argued the battle of Chalons happened while Attila was retreating from Gaul, and though bloody it was of little significance. Musset's account generally on Huns is that they left no trace and couldn't leave any trace (they were few and ruling over a confederation of mostly Germanic populations). Pierre Riche (1953, 1989) though he saw in Attila an exponent of the Asian cultures, argued the battle of Chalons only gave the Romans the hope their empire will be saved (and it wasn't). A Romanian historian, Stelian Brezeanu, writing about Byzantines (2004) described the battle of Chalons as a battle mainly between Germanic populations and assigns no significance to this battle. Going to an encyclopedic view of world history, Imanuel Geiss (1986) mentions the only significance of battle of Chalons - stopping the Hunnic campaigns in Gaul and Germany. These are randomly picked views of historians writing on Romans, barbarian invasions or even world histories where the macrohistorical importance of some events should be emphasized. With these in mind, I'm yet to be persuaded by sourced arguments the majority of historians indeed value this battle to be of macrohistorical importance. <a href="../../../d/a/i/User%7EDaizus_dd8f.html" title="User:Daizus">Daizus</a> 07:29, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I also share the concerns of others - why these major historians are listed from rather obsolete figures? Gibbon wrote more than 200 years ago!!! Not that is a recent historian himself, but compared with Gibbon and Creasy, Bury is the most recent! <a href="../../../d/a/i/User%7EDaizus_dd8f.html" title="User:Daizus">Daizus</a> 07:41, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, you overlooked Grant and Norwich, both 20th century writers, whom Old Windy Bear has mentioned above, so this opinion is not solely held by "rather obsolete figures".&#160;;-) And in defense of Edward Gibbon, (1) he is considered by a number of authories as the <i>greatest</i> historian writing in the English language, so his opinions do carry more weight than more recent ones; &amp; (2) according to what one Wikipedian (who happens to be professional medievalist) wrote elsewhere, late ancient &amp; early medieval history is one of those fields where it is not uncommon for scholarly articles &amp; works published 100 years ago (or more) to be cited today.</dd>
<dd>That having been said, I am interested in these authors who cite, Daizus; I have had problems identifying and obtaining more recent discussions of this event. The late E.A. Thompson is the most recent writer I've been able to find on the subject. Can you provide a more complete bibliographical citation for these works you mention above, so we can read what they have to say? At least the title of the books, &amp; the title, periodical name, volume &amp; first page for the articles?

<dd>I actually refered to section as it is currently pictured in the article. The historians quoted are Gibbon, Creasy and Ferill, but the quote on later does not support the macrohistorical significance (and by this way I come to wonder why is he presented in that paragraph? Simply for weight?). Gibbon is considered also by a "number of authorities" as inaccurate, exaggerating, biased, obsolete (usually in several certain issues, I don't want to say he's rejected or anything). That doesn't make him not a great historian, but he was a great historian for his time, that is 18th century! We do appreciate the pioneers of the mankind, but this doesn't mean we have to consider them authoritative sources in our 21st century scholarship. I am not a professional myself, but the few professional scholars I talked with (not to mention the essays/studies on various historiographies I've read) they all agree outdated scholarship shouldn't be cited (I mean not for arguments, however they might be evoke them to represent a scholarly tradition or to show what a long way a certain idea/theory has evolved). Also I've read several reviews where the omission of recent scholarship was heavily taxed.</dd>
<dd>There's a problem with my sources - most them I have translated in my own language, that is Romanian. I have really few materials in their original, mostly e-Books or downloaded articles. However, I can fetch you the original titles for my earlier mentioned historians and where I know of an English translation to make a reference on that, too.</dd>
<dd>* Lucien Musset - "Les Invasions. Les vagues germaniques", 1st ed. 1965, translated in English in 1975 and 1993, I believe both under the title "The Germanic invasions: the making of Europe, AD 400-600". I used a Romanian translation after the 3rd French edition, that is from 1994.</dd>
<dd>* Pierre Riché, Philippe Le Maitre - "Les invasions barbares", 1st ed. 1953. I've used a Romanian translation after the 9th edition (which it said to be a corrected one as well, and indeed the book has recent scholars referenced, too) from 1996. I don't know of any English translation to it and I know it was translated into Portuguese, though I don't know under what title.</dd>
<dd>* Pierre Riché - "L'Europe barbare de 476 à 774", 1st ed. 1989. I've used a Romanian translation after the 2nd edition from 1990. I don't know of any other translations.</dd>
<dd>The other two references I've provided only for variety, they do not give too much focus on the events from Western Europe from 5th century.</dd>
<dd>The thing is I believe Chalons is not so much emphasized as Tours or other controversial battles to be significant (probably also because both sides actually lost a lot and both main actors - Romans and Huns collapsed soon after) and many scholars while considering this battle do not emhpasize neither its importance nor its lack of importance. It was certainly one major battle, but in the view of many, lacking significant consequences. <a href="../../../d/a/i/User%7EDaizus_dd8f.html" title="User:Daizus">Daizus</a> 21:14, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Even Bury, who does not believe it macrohistorical, says:</li>
</ul>
<p>"The Gallic campaign had really been decided by the strategic success of the allies in cutting off Attila from Orleans. The battle was fought when he was in full retreat, and its value lay in damaging his prestige as an invincible conqueror, in weakening his forces, and in hindering him from extending the range of his ravages."</p>
<ul>
<li>Norwich says: "Attila was defeated on the Catalaunian Fields"</li>
<li>Gibbon says "[Attila's] retreat across the Rhine confessed the last victory which was achieved in the name of the Western Roman Empire."</li>
<li>Ferrill says " After he secured the Rhine, Attila moved into central Gaul and put Orleans under siege. Had he gained his objective, he would have been in a strong position to subdue the Visigoths in Aquitiane, but Aetius had put together a formidable coalition against the Hun. Working frenetically, the Roman leader had built a powerful alliance of Visigoths, Alans and Burgundians, uniting them with their traditional enemy, the Romans, for the defense of Gaul. Even though all parties to the protection of the Western Roman Empire had a common hatred of the Huns, it was still a remarkable achievement on Aetius' part to have drawn them into an effective military relationship."</li>
<li>Grant says this battle was the "Greatest victory of Aetius career and it was the only battle Attila ever lost."</li>
<li>Herbert says "The discomfiture of the mighty attempt of Attila to found a new anti-Christian dynasty upon the wreck of the temporal power of Rome, at the end of the term of twelve hundred years, to which its duration had been limited by the forebodings of the heathen."</li>
<li>Sir Edward Creasy says: "Attila's attacks on the Western empire were soon renewed, but never with such peril to the civilized world as had menaced it before his defeat at Châlons&#160;; and on his death, two years after that battle, the vast empire which his genius had founded was soon dissevered by the successful revolts of the subject nations. The name of the Huns ceased for some centuries to inspire terror in Western Europe, and their ascendency passed away with the life of the great king by whom it had been so fearfully augmented."</li>

<dd>Unless you can come up with historians to support your refusal to allow even the statement that this is regarded as a victory for Aetius by most historians and a defeat for Attila by most historians, I will revert that portion. Our opinions do not matter. You revert me and say stick to facts, I just cited you what historians say. Please find me cites that differ! The vast majority regard it as a huge victory for Aetius, who ended the invasion of Gaul forever, and tremendously weakened Attila by removing his aura of invincibilty. <a href="../../../o/l/d/User%7EOldwindybear_14b1.html" title="User:Oldwindybear">old windy bear</a> 21:58, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In the battle itself no side was defeated <a href="../../../m/i/l/Military_tactic.html" title="Military tactic">tactically</a>, all battle reports agree to this. The aims of Attila`s campaigns were impossible afterwards. This makes the battle a <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strategy.html" title="Strategy">strategic</a> victory and that is the interpretation, but DO not mix tactically inconclusive and strategic victory. "The battle was fought when he was in full retreat, and its value lay in damaging his prestige as an invincible conqueror, in weakening his forces, and in hindering him from extending the range of his ravages."

<p>"Bloody among the allies of both sides, inconclusive, but regarded by most historians as a great victory for Aetius and his allies as Attila's aura of invincibility was lost" That was your summary of the battle. It contradicts itself, so I made it proper into two parts, one stating historians interpretation and the other about the battle tactically.</p>
<p>The events there were Germanic tribes fighting nasty pitched battles against one another and the Huns on horseback shouting at the Romans (mostly infantry) without great casualties on both sides. This is no tactic defeat if the Huns go home afterwards. <a href="../../../w/a/n/User%7EWandalstouring_ea93.html" title="User:Wandalstouring">Wandalstouring</a> 22:46, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><a href="../../../w/a/n/User%7EWandalstouring_ea93.html" title="User:Wandalstouring">Wandalstouring</a> I can certainly live with your wording, which I think is a fair interpretation. I appreciate your listening to my concerns, and yes, I agree with you. I think strategically it was unquestionably a victory for Aetius and his coalition, and tactically it was no victory for anyone, because, as you pointed out, the Huns went home. Attila'a long term goal of conquest of Gaul was shattered, as was his myth of invincibility, but again, he went home. You were very fair, and your military interpretation an excellent one. I had not considered the strategic impact versus the tactical reality, which I should have. Your analysis was insightful and first rate.

<dd><a href="../../../l/l/y/User%7ELlywrch_461d.html" title="User:Llywrch">llywrch</a> I think you did an excellent job on the article. I thought your language was anything but "turpid." My only problem was that personally, while I felt that this could not possibly be included in decisive battles, historians said otherwise. Both of you then filed replied saying yes, it was inconclusive EXCEPT for the strategic implications. (Those could be that it derailed Attila's long term plan to bring Gaul completely under his heel, which could have nipped the fledging frankish state in the bud, and over the long term, perhaps resulted in the loss of the "family that forged Europe," the Carolingians. But that was VERY long term). It is not that Wandalstouring's analyis was better than yours - he just wrote his first - and both of you provided a way for me to get around the accepted historical view that this was a great turning point. I simply had not thought enough out of the box as you both had. I do think it had strategic implications, but tactically it was a wash. I am sorry you were insulted in attempting to nominate the article, personally I thought your work was quite good. I cannot see what else remains, frankly, the battle is exhaustively examined.

<p><a href="../../../w/a/n/User%7EWandalstouring_ea93.html" title="User:Wandalstouring">Wandalstouring</a> Hey buddy, yes, I did read that in Bury, but he titled the portion of the book devoted to Attila, "§ 2. The Hun Invasions of the Balkan Peninsula (A.D. 441‑448)" and Gibbon titled it "Chapter XXXIV Conquests and Court of Atillia, King of the Huns," and most often refers to them simply as the Huns. I personally have no problem with referring to them as Hunnic or Hunnish, but I suggested for simplicity's sake simply referring to them as the Huns, given the foregoing, or the Scythians, since both Bury and Gibbon referred to them by that appelation also. But I think you would be correct using any of the foregoing names. They were a confederation of tribes, believed to be primarily Turkic, but no one knows for sure. It is not like the Mongols, where you have a single certain ethnic identity. Their empire is most often simply known as the Huns, which was the reason for my suggestion. I don't think any of those names is going to be wrong in this context. <a href="../../../o/l/d/User%7EOldwindybear_14b1.html" title="User:Oldwindybear">old windy bear</a> 23:54, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The current version of events (based on contemporary sources) does not quite support the statement it was tactically inconclusive. After meeting for the first time an enemy who can shoot back, the Huns run back into their back and disorder their allied infantry while the enemy infantry rushes in. Sorry, but the Huns have been fighting for several years and did meet enemies with bows and arrows before. It sounds a bit biased. A suggest to tell the events in a better way (based on the sources) and on the other hand avoid dubious statements.</p>
<p>The Hunnic forces advanced to wear down the Roman troops with arrow volleys. But the Roman troops had enough archers with excellent bows to respond equally. The Huns were forced to retreat by the countervolley. Shielded from the superior Hunnic range weapons the Roman allies rushed in and a pitched battle between their Germanic infantries ensued.</p>

<p><i>As a reference, in the early 3rd century, the Roman Empire maintained thirty legions with just under 5200 actual men each; if we follow the general assumption that the number of auxiliaries matched the number of legionaries, then add the Praetorian Guard as 5,000 strong, and 6 Urban Cohorts, we find that the Empire at its height fielded a grand total of 323,000 soldiers across its territories[8].</i> This paragraph paints a diffrent picture than was probobly the reality at the time. Trying to compare the military strength of the Roman Empire between the early 3rd century with mid 5th century seems rather useless. The entire structure of the army had changed by then under <a href="../../../d/i/o/Diocletian.html" title="Diocletian">Diocletian</a>: numbers, organisation and skill had most definitly shifted.

<p>I don't understand the point of this discussion. Many battlefields lack any archeological evidence: the number of dead were in the hundreds -- sometimes buried, sometimes left to the scavengers to dispose of -- &amp; afterwards the local inhabitants would pick over what was left to make their lives easier (for example, the blade of a broken sword would be very useful in improving a plow.), and a few centuries of plowing would obscure any battlements.</p>
<p>Jordanes is considered the most important primary source for this period; every account I have seen about the Battle of Chalons relies on what he wrote, &amp; quotes it extensively. If you want to argue that his account is untrustworthy, please provide cites to experts who question &amp; argue against his reliability.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Chalons_904b.html#Archeological_evidence" title="Battle of Chalons">archeological evidence section</a> merely repeats some 19th century finds of questioned relevance. The grave may be related to the battle -- or it may not; the point is that some older books mention the connection, so due diligence requires Wikipedia to mention it. Lastly, the {{Sectiondisputed}} template does not exist; would the person who wants it there find the correct name for the template he wants to use -- or I'll revert this edit. -- <a href="../../../l/l/y/User%7ELlywrch_461d.html" title="User:Llywrch">llywrch</a> 02:27, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You may want to reconsider that response. From the tone of your first sentence, it sounds as if either you don't care enough about how you appear to be taken seriously -- or you don't care enough about the rest of to be worth the effort to properly talk to. Fixing that problem helps you in the long run. Since I, for one, <i>do</i> take the time to find the "right tag" -- especially if the template doesn't link to anything -- I'd appreciate it if you took the time to do the research.</dd>

<dd>And as a postscript, having looked at that article, all it indicates is that the reliablity of <i>portions</i> of Jordanes' <i>Getica</i> has been questioned. I'd go further, &amp; admit that those portions are legendary or mythical -- but the same could be said of many otherwise reliable histories. Do Heather or Kulikowski question Jordanes' account of this battle -- which earlier historians have argued is based on the work of contemporary writers like <a href="../../../p/r/i/Priscus.html" title="Priscus">Priscus</a>? I don't see any mention of that. I have to otherwise conclude that your use of these two scholars to entirely dismiss Jordanes' work is throwing the baby out with the bathwater. -- <a href="../../../l/l/y/User%7ELlywrch_461d.html" title="User:Llywrch">llywrch</a> 20:21, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Sorry about that. Wikipedia pages can take forever to load; wikipedia searching is worse; and wikipedia kept logging me off each time I opened a page that day. It often does take 40 minutes to find the right template. As for Jordanes, in the 5th century he may be fairly reliable, but in the 4th century he does make clear mistakes (e.g. Athanaric as successor to Fritigern).

<dd>The Huns used lots of arrows and these had mostly warheads made from bone or other cheap materials. Metal was expensive and most likely bronze warheads were used if not bone(some findings, has better armorpiercing ability, but less range - heavier missile), making ferromagnetic iron remains extremely rare. As far as anything valuable goes that is a bigger piece of metal, like spears, seax, swords, daggers and shieldboss, these things were likely retrieved by natives long ago. For similar examples look at the economic history of Lybia, before exporting oil they exported mainly the metal remains of the battles between the Axis and Allies of WWII on their territory. <a href="../../../w/a/n/User%7EWandalstouring_ea93.html" title="User:Wandalstouring">Wandalstouring</a> 23:54, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have seen there mostly a controversy about the battle being conclusive/inconclusive in terms of immediate success. However those sections read about "macrohistorical importance" which IMO is a totally different thing. Also to assert the majority of historians support a view one should have either a) a scholarly review of the historiography reaching this conclusion b) a large (and recent!) list of scholars to quote (i.e. the editor(s) asserting the majority can provide a significant coverage of the scholarship from the major historiographies - in English but perhaps also, if it's the case, in French, German, Italian, or any local historiographies).</dd>
<dd>I am unable to provide this view, and I don't know who can. But I've seen other opinions than Bury's this battle had not significant consequences in the long term (e.g. <a href="http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucien_Musset" class="external text" title="http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucien_Musset" rel="nofollow">Lucien Musset</a> wrote in 1965 about Attila's defeat to be of little significance for the Huns/Attila). So considering Bury's opinion is not singular, I am wondering how the "majority" and the "minority" were inferred. <a href="../../../d/a/i/User%7EDaizus_dd8f.html" title="User:Daizus">Daizus</a> 06:16, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

I think he deserves a huge round of applause for reworking the artilce repeatedly in order to compromise on the present form. If the majority view is tagged, then realistically, the minority view should be also. I hope that the tag is removed, given the strenuous efforts by <a href="../../../l/l/y/User%7ELlywrch_461d.html" title="User:Llywrch">llywrch</a> to reach a compromise everyone could live with. John J. Nowrich, the foremost living scholar on Byzantium, said of the battle of Chalons:
<dl>
<dd>"it should never be forgotten that in the summer of 451 and again in 452, the whole fate of western civilization hung in the balance. Had the Hunnish army not been halted in these two successive campaigns, had its leader toppled Valentinianfrom his throne and set up his own capital at Ravenna or Rome, there is little doubt that both Gaul and Italy would ahve been reduced to spiritual and cultural deserts." He goes on to say that though the battle in 451 was</dd>
<dd>"indecisive insofar as both sides sustained immense losses and neither was left master of the field, it had the effect of halting the huns advance."</dd>

</dd>
<dd>As I said, <a href="../../../l/l/y/User%7ELlywrch_461d.html" title="User:Llywrch">llywrch</a> managed the present article as a compromise, and it is a fair one, non-POV. <a href="../../../o/l/d/User%7EOldwindybear_14b1.html" title="User:Oldwindybear">old windy bear</a> 22:52, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I do not agree with this argument. For two reasons:</dd>
<dd>* Which textbooks/schoolbooks? There are schoolbooks written around the world. What is the reference? If one textbook would present the issue as a "majority vs minority" and another not, on what grounds do you make the choice?</dd>
<dd>* What is the authority invoked? This is basically a historiographical issue - to check the schools of thought, to see if one is dominant, etc.. If one reputable peer-reviewed historian (or historiographer) would say "some scholars believe X and some scholars believe Y" while a schoolbook would say "the majority of scholars believe X and the minority of scholars believe Y" whose opinion do you choose as authoritative? I'd go for the former.</dd>

<dd>Old windy bear, thank you for speaking so nicely of me. However, my tag applied to the entire "Historical importance" section (AFAIK the tags are introduced right below the title).

I have sent for Musset's work, and may try to get Pierre Riche's. They do need to be represented. If you have them, and are willing to translate and post them, it would be greatly appreciated - we could change the sections to "for and against" viewpoints, labeled traditional/differing, (and I have) much as we have at Tours, as a suggested solution, insteadof the wording majority/minority? This would eliminate any vestiage of bias, as everyone admits there are two schools of thought on this battle, with the traditional viewpoint being generally taught that the battle was of macrohistorical importance. And you are welcome, my interaction with you has shown you to be quite intelligent and well versed in your history, whose goal is simply to make the articles better. People need to understand not everyone agrees on how to do that, but that does not make the person swimming against the tide a person seeking "political correctness." <a href="../../../o/l/d/User%7EOldwindybear_14b1.html" title="User:Oldwindybear">old windy bear</a> 11:03, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>A "traditional" vs "different" opposition it looks much better in my eyes than "majority" vs "minority". I changed "different" with "opposing". If you think this word is loaded then you can revert back to your choice or we can look for another.</dd>
<dd>As I was saying to llywrch, I have these historians translated in Romanian, but I can try an English translation of my own for the time being, and when you or someone else can refer to a scholarly English translation or provide a better translation from the original French editions, we can simply replace them.

<dd>We can possibly supply you with most English sources as pdf if you name exactly book and chapters you need.

<dd>Oldwindybear, I have found an <a href="http://history.eserver.org/attila-at-chalons.txt" class="external text" title="http://history.eserver.org/attila-at-chalons.txt" rel="nofollow">interesting text</a> on Chalons. Arthur Ferill says:
<dl>
<dd>For various reasons twentieth century "scientific" historians</dd>
<dd>have minimized and even ridiculed the concept of "decisive</dd>
<dd>battles". There is a widespread belief that human events are</dd>
<dd>rarely determined on the battlefield. In the nineteenth century</dd>
<dd>Edward Creasy's book, The Fifteen Decisive Battles of the</dd>
<dd>World (originally published in 1851) became a bestseller and</dd>
<dd>exercised considerable influence. (Incidentally Creasy included</dd>
<dd>the Battle of Chalons on his list.) But the early twentieth</dd>
<dd>century saw a change. Hans Delbruck totally ignored Chalons</dd>
<dd>in his monumental History of the Art of War Within the</dd>
<dd>Framework of Political History (1920-21), and one of the</dd>
<dd>foremost authorities on the Late Roman Empire, J.B. Bury, refused,</dd>
<dd>as some others have done, even to call it by its traditional name:
<dl>
<dd>The Battle of Maurica [Chalons] was a battle of nations, but its</dd>
<dd>significance has been enormously exaggerated in conventional</dd>
<dd>history. It cannot in any reasonable sense be designated as one</dd>
<dd>of the critical battles of the world....The danger did not mean so</dd>
<dd>much as has been commonly assumed. If Attila had been</dd>
<dd>victorious...there is no reason to suppose that the course of</dd>
<dd>history would have been seriously altered.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>and Ferill further continues his arguments. I've put it here because it's a brief view on historiography, though probably a bit biased (to call historians disagreeing with you "scientific" - i.e. using quotes - it is not nice). Anyway a point to be taken is that Ferill doesn't consider them a minority. <a href="../../../d/a/i/User%7EDaizus_dd8f.html" title="User:Daizus">Daizus</a> 15:19, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>While on Ferill I want to make another observation. It seems some of the arguments for macrohistorical importance are bound to the image Huns were ferocious barbarians and that Hunnic empire (and consequently their army at Chalons) was somehow "Asian" (or anyway, something foreign of European civilization and Christianity). I'll quote again Ferill from the same text with:
<dl>
<dd>It is true that in the following</dd>
<dd>year Attila invaded Italy and caused much suffering before he</dd>
<dd>withdrew, but if he had launched a successful counterattack</dd>
<dd>in Gaul the whole course of Western history might have been</dd>
<dd>changed. Unlike most other barbarians of the age, the Huns</dd>
<dd>were not Christians, and their respect for the Graeco-Roman</dd>
<dd>Christian civilization of the Late Empire was much more lim-</dd>
<dd>ited even than that of Visigoth and Vandal. <i><a href="../../../d/a/i/User%7EDaizus_dd8f.html" title="User:Daizus">Daizus</a> 15:19, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Schoolbooks are books used in school to teach children, not scientific books. It seems to me the issue gets a bit confused.</dd>
<dd>So far in my schoolbook it was discussed as one of the important battles, besides the ancient battle to unit upper and lower Egypt (founding Egypt), Thermopylae, Marathon, Salamis(Greek freedom vs Persian domination), Trasimene, Trebia, Cannae, Zama(Rome and Carthage for supremacy), Tours, Poitiers(Islamic invasion) Chalons(defeating the Hunnic threat) and the battle on the Lechfeld(protection against the later Hungarians). Adrianople was not part of the canon in Bavaria. In France and other German countries Chalons is credited for saving Europe. This is influenced by the widespread view in Western European countries that Europe politically hardly ever extended as far east as the eastern borders of the modern Ukraine. It is quite an issue with the eastern expansion of the EU and the ongoing popular sentiment, reflected in historiography, makes many people consider Russia, often including Ukraine and Belarus, as Asian countries. Thus the influential German, French and English historiography have shaped the opinion that Europe was saved from an 'Asian' Empire(that did rule large parts of Europe).
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I know what schoolbooks are used for, I have previously replied: "My memory can be wrong but I don't remember to be taught in school about macrohistorical battles.". The curriculum may differ from era to era, from a country to another, that's why I previously asked about reference, about what shall we do with world-wide differences in interpretation (because they do exist)? We cannot simply take the schoolbook we learned from and impose it as an unique POV.</dd>
<dd>As for historiography, I have yet to see here strong arguments the position supporting the macrohistorical battle is the prevalent one, the most influential one. From Ferill's account one would get the impression in the 20th century a new school of thought emerged and became influential and this causes the author to speak against those "scientific" historians. And certainly historiographic position is not bound to EU expansion as some of these works (Bury's, Musset's) were published before EU even existed.</dd>
<dd>I notice you're talking about French historiography's influences but at this moment the only two French historians invoked here argued the battle of Chalons was not a macrohistorical battle, the Huns were rather a warring Asian elite over Germanic populations leaving no notable traces in the history of Europe and that Europe is a byproduct of two civilizations - the Roman one and the Germanic one. <a href="../../../d/a/i/User%7EDaizus_dd8f.html" title="User:Daizus">Daizus</a> 17:03, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

</dl>
</dd>
<dd>This barbarian Asian/Germanic issue appears quite frequent and is a signal that the author might have some flaws in his research. Problem is that these works are still used by other historians, so we have to do it either, but we try to turn things into improved versions, usually substituting such sections with a more detailed breakdown on the subject(using other sources). That is our little freedom of choice, bordering to OR and POV issues. <a href="../../../w/a/n/User%7EWandalstouring_ea93.html" title="User:Wandalstouring">Wandalstouring</a> 15:59, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Ferril's theory on the declin of Hunnic cavalry is not undisputed. Others suggest that the original Huns from the Eurasian steppe were a small population (de:<i>Traditionskern</i>) who acquired followers by its success against ruling elites. These followers weren't necessarily mounted. Genetic research so far does not mention much difference between people from Hungaria and other Europeans as far as I know. <a href="../../../w/a/n/User%7EWandalstouring_ea93.html" title="User:Wandalstouring">Wandalstouring</a> 16:05, 27 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>That's one of the points I tried to suggest when I quoted Ferill. If the Huns were small in numbers and the most of their army and their subjects were of Germanic origin (or other European ones), an alternative Hunnic victory probably wouldn't have altered significantly the cultural coordinates for Western Europe. I don't think Visigoths were at that time "more Christian" than the Ostrogoths or the Burgundians.</dd>
<dd>If genetic research shows the people to be largely autochtonous on a macrohistorical scale, the possibility to be overrunned by people of other culture gets dimmer. The mechanisms of cultural influence and propagation seem to be a little more complex than a simple invasion (or military victory for that matter). <a href="../../../d/a/i/User%7EDaizus_dd8f.html" title="User:Daizus">Daizus</a> 17:03, 27 February 2007 (UTC)

<p>The split into Roman Catholic and Greek Orthodox did not become official till 1054 with the joint excommunication of each other by the Pope and the Patriarch. The majority fo the troops under Attila were christian, but what the historians in the Gibbon school stress is that the Hunnish elite were NOT, and they would have devastated the Roman culture adopted by the Franks and later Carolingians. As to the genetics, the claim the Hungarians are Hun descended has been long discredited. The compromise of "traditional versus opposing" view is a fine one. <a href="../../../o/l/d/User%7EOldwindybear_14b1.html" title="User:Oldwindybear">old windy bear</a> 21:02, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Is it too late for me to add my opinion in this discussion? While Daizus &amp; I may not agree over the value of Edward Gibbon (I haven't responded to his comment above because I'm still thinking thru what I want to say), I want to make it clear that I greatly appreciate the fact that he took the time to list several works that, either in whole or in part, discuss this battle. We might not have otherwise known they existed! It will be a while before these works are integrated into this article (I'll admit that it may take me a while to find, read &amp; understand these works -- although everyone else is welcome to help in the research &amp; writing), but I hope that once these works are integrated into this article, it will be considered worthy of a Featured Article -- which I think is what all of us want. -- <a href="../../../l/l/y/User%7ELlywrch_461d.html" title="User:Llywrch">llywrch</a> 21:34, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p><a href="../../../l/l/y/User%7ELlywrch_461d.html" title="User:Llywrch">llywrch</a> considering the wonderful and very patient job you have done in steering this article through the shoals of hordes of edits, it is never too late to pitch back in! My only caveat is that I want it clear though Gibbon is most famously quoted on this battle, he is FAR from the only one with that opinion! Creasy, and on and on! I also wish Norwich's work emphasized, (because of his reputation and status as a modern era Roman historian), and that of Western Military Historian Paul K, Davis, who in "<i>100 Decisive Battles</i>" says on page 87, under "IMPORTANCE: Roman defeat of the Huns stopped the Asian spread westward, setting up the collapse of Attila's empire two years later," and saying on 91 saying "by halting hun expansion, the battle at Chalons kept Attila from dominating western europe. Aetius force was thrown together at the last minute, if had not been defeated, there was really no other organized population that could have withstood the huns." (Oxford Press 1999) J.F.C. Fuller of "<i>A Military History of the Western World</i>" claims on page 297 of Volume One that Attila survived only because Aetius allowed him to, in "a battle that saved Europe." I am not saying all these historians are correct, but as we are expanding the article, let us add the other historians - I just added one comment from Norwich, but would like to see the comments from Fuller and Davis added. Ferill also said of this battle, as <a href="../../../d/a/i/User%7EDaizus_dd8f.html" title="User:Daizus">Daizus</a> pointed out:</p>

<dd>"To have driven Attila the Hun out of the Empire was satisfaction enough. It is true that in the following year Attila invaded Italy and caused much suffering before he withdrew, but if he had launched a successful counterattack in Gaul the whole course of Western history might have been changed. Unlike most other barbarians of the age, the Huns were not Christians, and their respect for the Graeco-Roman Christian civilization of the Late Empire was much more limited even than that of Visigoth and Vandal."<a href="http://www.historicaltextarchive.com/sections.php?op=viewarticle&amp;artid=61" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.historicaltextarchive.com/sections.php?op=viewarticle&amp;artid=61" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></dd>

<p>He made very clear he regarded Chalons as a battle of macrohistorical importance. "The clash at Chalons was one of those rare monumental conflicts" The list goes on and on of historians who saw this as a classic showdown that decided "the fate of nations," to quote Creasy. I would like to make sure these scholars views are well presented as well. Davis and Fuller, for instance, are not presently quoted, and I just added Norwich. <a href="../../../o/l/d/User%7EOldwindybear_14b1.html" title="User:Oldwindybear">old windy bear</a></p>

It has been a pleasure working with you, and I felt sure you would be back with some good sources to back up Bury. I think it is a fair representation to call it traditional/opposing, and I commend you on that idea. Gibbon pretty much was the first "modern" scholar to talk about the battle, and he certainly paints it as the ultimate test of good and evil and certainly the Roman histories of the era painted Aetius and Chalons as the last great moment of the empire in the west, so calling that view traditional is fair. But Bury - and others who came after him - refute that view, so there is good cause for calling theirs opposing. There are modern scholars on EACH SIDE, and I am certainly content with <a href="../../../l/l/y/User%7ELlywrch_461d.html" title="User:Llywrch">llywrch</a> formatting what we both give him, since he wrote the article. <a href="../../../w/a/n/User%7EWandalstouring_ea93.html" title="User:Wandalstouring">Wandalstouring</a> will undoubtedly be back also, since he is very knowledgable.

<dd>I've found Pierre Riche in English on Google books but it's not on Chalons, only on Tours (his book on Carolingians).</dd>
<dd>Lucien Musset I haven't found in English, but I could retrieve from Google books only an unfinished paragraph, but long enough if anyone wonders about an original quote (I couldn't retrieve it longer than that): (Attila) "Reprenant la route qu'il avait suivie à l'aller, il fut obligé par Aétius à livrer bataille le 20 juin 451, à l'ouest de Troyes, au Campus Mauriacus (peut-être Moirey dans la commune de Dierrey Saint-Julien). Cette bataille (dite improprement des «&#160;Champs Catalauniques&#160;») tourna à la défaite du roi des Huns, mais elle ne fut pas décisive puisqu'il put battre en retraite sans n'être plus inquiété ..." (Robert Folz, André Guillou, Lucien Musset, <i>De l'antiquité an monde médiéval</i>, Published 1972, Presses universitaires de France, p. 61). It keeps Bury's points - Campus Mauriacus (not Catalaunian Fields, see somewhere in the talk page also Ferill's indignation), indecissive defeat. Pity I couldn't retrieve more to see the argument to its end. However the phrase is very similar to the one I have translated in Romanian from his "Les invasions" (which I refered into article in English translation, I couldn't provide the page though for that edition), I assume it says that Attila, without being worried, retreated in Pannonia and that in 452 campaigned again this time in Italy. <a href="../../../d/a/i/User%7EDaizus_dd8f.html" title="User:Daizus">Daizus</a> 23:25, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Let me warn everyone, I am beginning to lose patience here. I am not trying consciously attempting to push any one interpretation over any other; I am just trying to explain why this one battle which, was inconclusive from a military standpoint, yet somehow became transformed into one of "the decisive battles of western history". It is not something that <i>I</i> believe; it is clearly something that is repeated from schoolbook to schoolbook &amp; in popular culture -- maybe only in the English-speaking world, maybe only in the US, but I feel it is disingenuous to claim that there is no proof of this belief just because we can't furnish proof of what is obvious.</p>
<p>First, there <i>was</i> a clearly Christian coloring to the near-contemporary accounts of this battle. For example, the 6th-century historian <a href="../../../g/r/e/Gregory_of_Tours_cdfe.html" title="Gregory of Tours">Gregory of Tours</a>, who has been used to represent the view point of his age (by, for example, <a href="../../../e/r/i/Erich_Auerbach_b939.html" title="Erich Auerbach">Erich Auerbach</a> in his <i>Mimesis</i>), claims that several miracles -- the intervention of God or Christian Saints -- were responsible for the victory. In Gregory's own words, "no one has any doubt that the army of the Huns was really routed by the prayers of the bishop about whom I have told you." (<i>History of the Franks</i> II.7) This interpretation is confirmed by the language of <a href="../../../j/o/r/Jordanes.html" title="Jordanes">Jordanes</a> &amp; <a href="../../../c/a/s/Cassiodorus.html" title="Cassiodorus">Cassiodorus</a> when they mention this battle: these &amp; other writers consider it was a great victory for Christianity. This interpretation was then repeated by Gibbon, &amp; from him it entered contemporary popular culture.</p>
<p>Or am I the only one who was awake that day in school when the teacher lectured on the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire? Need I trot out popular accounts of this period in history, such as <a href="../../../h/2E/_/H._G._Wells_6b56.html" title="H. G. Wells">H. G. Wells</a>' <i>An Outline of History</i> or the relvant volume from <a href="../../../w/i/l/Will_Durant_f2f2.html" title="Will Durant">Will Durant</a>'s <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Story_of_Civilization_6148.html" title="The Story of Civilization">The Story of Civilization</a></i>? If I do so, will I be pestered with tags questioning the importance &amp; reliability of these writers also?</p>
<p>Second is the request for sources on the statement, "it was the first major battle since the death of Constantine I where a predominantly Christian force faced a predominantly pagan opponent." I refer the person who tacked on that pedantic query to the essay: <a href="../../../t/h/e/Wikipedia%7EThese_are_not_Original_Research_0c47.html" title="Wikipedia:These are not Original Research">Wikipedia: These are not Original Research</a>, &amp; <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATTRIB_743d.html" title="WP:ATTRIB">WP:ATTRIB</a>. To put my point in simple words, <b>this is a simple logical deduction, based on verifiable chronology.</b> The facts are well known, &amp; available in the relevant Wikipedia articles:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="../../../c/o/n/Constantine_the_Great_52bd.html" title="Constantine the Great">Constantine the Great</a> declared Christianity was the official religion of the Roman Empire. Yes, many Roman citizens remained pagans well after this act; these people were exceptions. To a constantly increasing degree as time went on, one was not considered a proper Roman citizen unless one was an orthodox Christian.</li>
<li><a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Roman_battles_6e95.html" title="List of Roman battles">List of Roman battles</a> provides a list of all of the Battles Rome, as a Republic or an Empire, fought. Look at the years between Constantine &amp; this battle and see if there are any other battles that fit this category. (<i>Nota bene</i>: by mid-4th century the Goths had become Christians -- <i>Arian</i> Christians, admittedly, &amp; therefore considered heretics -- yet they were still Christian.)</li>
<li>Either the statement is true, or it is false. Simple logical, either/or deduction. It's the same kind of obvious reasoning that if given a person's date of birth &amp; date of death, I can state how long that person lived -- <b>and not need to supply a source for this statement</b>.</li>
</ol>
<p>I'm stopping my rant here. As I wrote above, this kind of thinking makes me angry because it takes the fun out of Wikipedia for me. And when I get angry, I may confuse criticizing a person's behavior with criticizing that person -- which does none of us any good. If you disagree with what is written, offer an argument on this talk page -- don't just add a tag without thinking, because that makes it appear as if it is the work of some irresponsible kook or a troublemaker eager to sow misinformation. -- <a href="../../../l/l/y/User%7ELlywrch_461d.html" title="User:Llywrch">llywrch</a> 19:00, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

One is clearly not even a battle ("Pap's escape from prison and return to Armenia. c. 374"). And the last one ("Naval battle between the Vandals and the Byzantines, 468") happened <i>after</i> the Battle of Chalons.

<dd>Your learning might be broad, but it is not deep. If Athanaric's defeat is so significant, then why doesn't <a href="../../../a/t/h/Athanaric.html" title="Athanaric">his article</a> mention it? It only says that he died -- &amp; does not give the cause. From the history page, I see you've editted that page several times, so you know what it says; if that battle was so significant, why did you not add at least a sentence mentioning it there? And while Stilicho did engage <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radagaisus.html" title="Radagaisus">Radagaisus</a> in battle, &amp; Radagaisus' Wikipedia article does mentions that battle, it is clear that Radagaisus was leading 12,000 men on a raid (or razzia) into Italy for plunder, tribute and slaves -- not conquest. Although a pagan &amp; a barbarian, he posed no lasting threat to the Roman Empire himself; this was but another instance of Stilicho playing "whack-a-mole" against the rising tide of German invaders. This battle was forgotten within a few months, once news was received that a new wave of barabarians had crossed the frozen Rhine on the last day of December in 406, who would blaze a trail of destruction across Gaul &amp; Spain which eventually ended in North Africa.</dd>

</dl>
<p>Radagaisius' army was one of the largest Barbarian armies <b>ever</b>. Heather, 1998, p. 147-148 states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>According to one source, 12,000 of Radagaisius' defeated force were drafted by Stilicho into the Roman army (Olympiodorus fr. 9) but others were less fortunate. According to Orosius, so many were sold into slavery that the bottom dropped out of the market (7.37.13ff). ... While Alaric's Goths sat outside Rome for 18 months from early 409 to the summer of 410, large numbers of slaves joined his forces. I strongly suspect that most of these were again former followers of Radagaisius, those who had been sold into slavery. The numbers given for these reinforcements are problematic...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Zosimus says 40,000. 12,000 + 40,000 = 52,000. So something on the order of 20-50,000 seems to fit the literary evidence. So I'd consider it one of the most important battles of the 5th century. Jacob Haller 01:12, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>Jacob, you quote one writer, Peter Heather, &amp; trust him to be correct in every opinion at every instance; to cite only one authority for any argument is to invite disaster. Further, based on how you cited him above to claim that Jordanes was entirely unreliable, I have little faith in how you have used him as an authority -- which is proven in your response. Heather writes that "I strongly suspect" that "most" of these "large numbers of slaves" were part of the army of Radagaisus. He writes of vague proportions of vague numbers; assuming you are correctly quoting Zosimus, &amp; if Zosimus (who was writing several centuries later) was correct about the number, then Heather can only be quoted to show that he thinks that at least 20,000 of these escaped slaves originally came from Radagaisus' army -- which makes the possible size of Radaisus' army 32,000. And if Wandalstouring is correct -- who has demonstrated that he knows the material elsewhere -- then the number of former warriors attached to Radagaisus shrinks further to 10,000, &amp; his army to 22,000. And seeing how Stilicho had raised an army of 40,000 to confront Radagaisus -- &amp; defeated him -- either of these smaller figures are clearly closer to the truth.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In any case, compare this one army with the numerous hordes who crossed the frozen Rhine on the last day of the year 406: the forces of the Burgunds, Vandals, Alans and Sueves. Seeing how each of whom eventually carved out a kingdom for themselves in western Europe or North Africa, I'd say it would be difficult to show that this combined force was less than 80,000 armed men (and at least as many women, children, slaves &amp; free servants). In short, in that same year Rome faced an army many times the size of Radagaisus'.</dd>

<dd>BTW, while I'm not usually a stickler for details, the name of this barbarian general is spelled "Radagai<b>sus</b>" -- his name is not an i-stem noun. This is how every other writer or source I've consulted for this period writes his name -- Edward Gibbon, John Matthews (<i>Western Aristocracies and Imperial Court: AD 364-425</i>), C.D. Gordon (<i>The Age of Attila</i>), and even the <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radagaisus.html" title="Radagaisus">Wikipedia article about him</a>. A misspelling once or twice, I'm willing to ignore (I make typos); but your consistant misspelling of his name again leads me to suspect that you don't know what you're talking about. -- <a href="../../../l/l/y/User%7ELlywrch_461d.html" title="User:Llywrch">llywrch</a> 22:45, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't understand what's the quarrel? Obviously there were more significant battles between Adrianopole and Campus Mauriacus, so what's the big deal? Rephrase if you wanna keep the statement.</dd>
<dd>And what's this downplaying of references? Peter Heather is one major reference. I don't like him particularily, he authored some dubious statements, but this is my opinion, I won't reject his POV in the articles because of that. Moreover, he's not alone there. Zosimus didn't write "several centuries later" but only several decades later. Peter Heather was not the first to draw attention on Radagaisus, you can check other historians of the Late Empire, starting with Gibbon himself - see chapter XXX ("two great Invasions of Italy by Alaric and Radagaisus"), a chapter where Gibbon mentions Radagaisus' "great army" (Gibbon's numbers are quite large, over those 12,000 he adds to hundreds of thousands, not a "smaller number of German immigranats") pillaging "many cities" and, important for this paragraph, it's pictured as non-Christian, non-civilized danger to the Roman world. After the battle (not "a tavern brawl") and the annihiliation of Radagaisus' army Stilicho gets the 2nd time "the glorious title of Deliverer of Italy". Yeah, it's Gibbon, but this should alert any editor claiming a minimum knowledge of this period the statements signaled by Jacob Heller are not that straightforward as they seemed (come on, even 12,000 is a significant army!), though common sense would make anyone wonder if in an age like that, 70-80 years could have passed with no major conflicts between Romans and their enemies (because this is the essence behind a Christian vs non-Christian scenario in the late 4th, early 5th century). <a href="../../../d/a/i/User%7EDaizus_dd8f.html" title="User:Daizus">Daizus</a> 07:38, 12 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Daizus, read my post that starts this thread. Do I have grounds to take offense in how what I wrote was tagged? That is the matter in a nutshell. The text is an attempt to put the battle in a larger perspective -- which Jacob Haller obviously would rather tear down on the basis of his sloppy reasoning &amp; incomplete research. I edit for fun &amp; the fun comes from the challenge of learning &amp; competing in a friendly way with other enthusiasts; dealing with trolls like Jacob Haller robs me of that. -- <a href="../../../l/l/y/User%7ELlywrch_461d.html" title="User:Llywrch">llywrch</a> 02:26, 15 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Llywrch, I'm sorry about offending you. I can be rather aggressive with fact tags. I sometimes fact tag my own edits when I don't have sources handy (though neither consistently nor systematically). I started editing on pages with much tighter citation standards, where tags are taken in stride, and have since encountered other pages with much looser citation standards.Jacob Haller 03:00, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Faesula and Cat. Fields are both after my period of expertise. Still, whatever figure we accept - 22,000 or 52,000 - it is one of the largest barbarian armies of all time. I used the higher figure to compare with other equally-exaggerated army sizes (35,000 for Argentoratum, etc.). I think 10,000 is the best possible estimate for Adrianople (Heather suggests 20,000) for various reasons (partly my reading of Ammianus, partly demographic issues, OR), so your comment about 'only' 12,000 got to me.
