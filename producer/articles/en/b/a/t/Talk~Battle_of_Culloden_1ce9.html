<p>new bayonet tactics added to Battle section, based on a BBC TV programme about Culloden by military historian Richard Holmes. "Battlefield Britain" os to cover Culloden on BBC2, 9pm 17 sept '04 - will see if this also mentions bayonets. -- <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDave_souza_a1d9.html" title="User:Dave souza">dave souza</a> 22:08, 14 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The programme did indeed cover the bayonet training (using the new "socket" <a href="../../../b/a/y/Bayonet.html" title="Bayonet">bayonet</a> replacing the old "plug" bayonets which had failed earlier), also emphasised training in rate of fire of the muskets, tired and hungry Highlanders, problems with the ground etc. There were some statements which conflicted with history books, and the highlanders were shown charging with their plaids on at the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Prestonpans_fa27.html" title="Battle of Prestonpans">Battle of Prestonpans</a> when the evidence is they took them off first - any evidence of what happened at Culloden?

<p>It should be noted that many Scotts clans higland and lowland supported the British Government during the Jacobite uprisings. Including MacKays, Rosses, Munros, Gunns, Campbells, Grants, Agnew and many more. Most fought at Culloden but not under their clan names. The Battalions were named after their commanders, most of the Battalions made from the Scotts clans actually had English commanders, who the battalion was named after. With the exeption of Munro and Cambell whos commanders were their clan chiefs.</p>

<p>If Culloden was 'the last military clash in mainland Britain' this would imply that there was another part of Britain which was not on the, em, "mainland" where such a clash took place at a later date. Where was that part?</p>

<p>The statement that the campaign was intended to place Charles Edward Stuart on the throne is dubious. His father James Francis Edward Stuart was still alive in 1745 and the aim was probably to win the campaign for his cause. I believe that Charles Edward Stuart became the young pretender when his father died in 1766.</p>

<dd>That would be the first step. Inline citations are a cosmetic matter, a mere frippery. The first thing to do, I should say, is to overhaul the quality of writing.

<p>I've read an alternative interpretation of the battle of culloden - rather than an essentially english/scottish fight - it was much more divided along catholic/protestant religious lines and highland/lowland rivalry - with many lowland scots fighting for cumberland, and various other nations pitching in for respective sides.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Captain Cunningham’s Company of Artillery – composed of ten short Saxon six pounders and six coehorn mortars. In total it was an army that mustered 9,000 effective fighting men. It may be worth noting that approximately one third of the 16 battalions present were made up of Lowland Scots together with over 600 highland levies."<a href="http://www.ourpasthistory.com/battlefields/culloden/index.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ourpasthistory.com/battlefields/culloden/index.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>

<dd>Far from being an "alternative interpretation", this is accepted as fact - no historian would claim it was an England v Scotland match, even if that is the popular romanticised shortbread-tin view. As far as I can see, the article makes this pretty clear: see especially the section <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Culloden_e0f1.html#Armies" title="Battle of Culloden">Armies</a>, which looks like an accurate summary of the nationalities involved. However, the article could benefit from an extra paragraph or two on the background to the battle, viz. a very brief summary of Jacobitism and its demographics (with special reference to Scotland), and a mention of the failed 1715 rising. Of course the article <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jacobite_rising.html" title="Jacobite rising">Jacobite rising</a> already does this, but many misinformed readers will come to this article and not bother to read up on the wider background, so it ought to be to touched upon. --<a href="../../../b/l/i/User%7EBlisco_5543.html" title="User:Blisco">Blisco</a> 20:28, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I will explain about the Munro invlovement. Heres a little history lesson.</p>
<p>Chief <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Munro_%281684_-_1746%29_2589.html" title="Robert Munro (1684 - 1746)">Robert Munro (1684 - 1746)</a> led men of the <a href="../../../c/l/a/Clan_Munro_0040.html" title="Clan Munro">Clan Munro</a> in an independant Black Watch company against the French, in support of the British government. This included action at the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Fontenoy_ef9c.html" title="Battle of Fontenoy">Battle of Fontenoy</a> in 1745. As a reward for his exellent service when he returned to the UK he was appointed the commander of the English 37th regiment of foot.</p>
<p>The English 37th regiment of foot was made from Englsih soldiers and not Scotts from the Clan Munro. He commanded the English 37th at the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Falkirk_%281746%29_03a2.html" title="Battle of Falkirk (1746)">Battle of Falkirk (1746)</a> where they ran off and left him. He was surrounded by Jacobites and killed.</p>
<p>Robert's son <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_Munro_b6eb.html" title="Harry Munro">Harry Munro</a> would not just be able to just assume the right to command the 37th regiment. It is well documented that Harry had a military carreer in Loudan's regiment at the time of the Jacobite rising. However he had nothing to do with the 37th. Harry was taken prisoner at the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Prestonpans_fa27.html" title="Battle of Prestonpans">Battle of Prestonpans</a> in 1745 as part of Loudan's regiment but was later released. He rejoined Loudan's regiment but after the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Falkirk_%281746%29_03a2.html" title="Battle of Falkirk (1746)">Battle of Falkirk (1746)</a>, Sir Harry was listed as absent "by HRH leave" to deal with the problems at <a href="../../../f/o/u/Foulis_Castle_c56e.html" title="Foulis Castle">Foulis Castle</a> which was said to have been rendered "a compleat desolation" by the Jacobites. The Munro company under Harry was disbanded in 1748.</p>
<p>The 37th regiment of foot at Culloden is often mistakenly referred to as "Munro's" regiment of foot. Colonel Dejean took over command but the regiment was never renamed Probably because its previous commander <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Munro_%281684_-_1746%29_2589.html" title="Robert Munro (1684 - 1746)">Robert Munro (1684 - 1746)</a> had not long died just a few months before. Even today at the Culloden battle site a plaque calls it Munro's regiment. <a href="http://www.jadecat.com/graphics/scotland/2/2c.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.jadecat.com/graphics/scotland/2/2c.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> Perhaps in honour of Robert Munro. 195.137.109.177 10:53, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
