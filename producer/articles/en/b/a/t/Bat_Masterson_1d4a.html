<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/t/Bat_Masterson_1d4a.html" title="Edit section: Early life">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Early life</span></h2>
<p>Bat Masterson was born to <a href="../../../i/r/e/Ireland.html" title="Ireland">Irish</a> parents, Thomas Masterson &amp; Cathrine McGurk, in Henryville, <a href="../../../q/u/e/Quebec.html" title="Quebec">Quebec</a>. The baptismal records of "Bat" and his siblings are in the local Catholic church. "Bat" later claimed on U.S. census that he was born in <a href="../../../i/l/l/Illinois.html" title="Illinois">Illinois</a> or <a href="../../../m/i/s/Missouri.html" title="Missouri">Missouri</a>, but that was probably to improve on his tough side image.</p>
<p>Some details of Masterson's early life are disputed. He is reported to have been born on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_24.html" title="November 24">November 24</a> of either 1853 or 1856 in either Quebec, <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canada</a>, or in Illinois, <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> His birth name was either William Barclay Masterson or Bartholomew Masterson, but it is known that during his adult life he called himself "the Genius." The 1870 census of St Clair County, Illinois, lists him as Bartholomaeus Masterson, age 17, born in Canada.</p>
<p>Some report that he was called "Bat" as a nickname for Bartholomew. A more colorful account is that he was called "Bat" because he carried a cane which he used as a club during fights. "Bat" was also a common nickname for boxers of the day—short for "battling."</p>
<p>Masterson was the second child of seven of Thomas and Catharina Masterson, and was raised on farms in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_3da4.html" title="New York">New York</a>, Illinois, <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kansas.html" title="Kansas">Kansas</a> and Quebec. In his late teens, he and two of his brothers, Ed and Jim, left their family's farm in <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kansas.html" title="Kansas">Kansas</a> to become buffalo hunters. While traveling without his brothers, he took part in the <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_Battle_of_Adobe_Walls_0dbf.html" title="Second Battle of Adobe Walls">Battle of Adobe Walls</a> (<a href="../../../t/e/x/Texas.html" title="Texas">Texas</a>) fighting against an overwhelming number of <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comanche.html" title="Comanche">Comanche</a> Indians.

Deputies Bat Masterson and Wyatt Earp in Dodge City, 1876</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>His first gunfight took place in Sweetwater, Texas (later <a href="../../../m/o/b/Mobeetie%2C_Texas_c7fa.html" title="Mobeetie, Texas">Mobeetie</a>), in 1876 when he was attacked by a man in a fight, allegedly because of a girl. The other man died of his wounds. Masterson was shot in the <a href="../../../p/e/l/Pelvis.html" title="Pelvis">pelvis</a>. Because of the injury, he had to carry a cane for the rest of his life.</p>
<p>In 1877, he joined his brothers in <a href="../../../d/o/d/Dodge_City%2C_Kansas_24f1.html" title="Dodge City, Kansas">Dodge City, Kansas</a>. <a href="http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/WWmastersonJ.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/WWmastersonJ.htm" rel="nofollow">Jim</a> was a partner in a saloon there and Ed was a deputy sheriff. Soon after his arrival, Masterson came into conflict with the local marshal over the treatment of a man being arrested. He was jailed and fined, although his fine was later returned by the city council. He served as a sheriff's deputy alongside <a href="../../../w/y/a/Wyatt_Earp_5f3f.html" title="Wyatt Earp">Wyatt Earp</a>, and within a few months he was elected county sheriff of Ford County, Kansas.

During this same period his brother <a href="http://www.odmp.org/officer.php?oid=8676" class="external text" title="http://www.odmp.org/officer.php?oid=8676" rel="nofollow">Ed</a> was Marshal of Dodge City and was killed in the line of duty <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_9.html" title="April 9">April 9</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/7/1878.html" title="1878">1878</a>.</p>
<p>For the next several years, he made a living as a gambler moving through several of the legendary towns of the Old West. He visited Wyatt Earp in <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tombstone%2C_Arizona_450d.html" title="Tombstone, Arizona">Tombstone</a>, <a href="../../../a/r/i/Arizona_Territory_7e22.html" title="Arizona Territory">Arizona Territory</a>, leaving shortly before the famous "<a href="../../../g/u/n/Gunfight_at_the_O.K._Corral_678b.html" title="Gunfight at the O.K.

<p>In 1883, he participated in a bloodless conflict and gunfighter gathering later called the <a href="../../../d/o/d/Dodge_City_War_4e8c.html" title="Dodge City War">Dodge City War</a>. By 1889, he was living in <a href="../../../d/e/n/Denver%2C_Colorado_0409.html" title="Denver, Colorado">Denver, Colorado</a>, where he was involved with <a href="../../../s/o/a/Soapy_Smith_38ba.html" title="Soapy Smith">Soapy Smith</a> in the infamous election ballot stuffing scandal.

In 1892, he managed the Denver Exchange Club in Creede, Colorado, and continued to travel around the boomtowns of the West, gambling and promoting <a href="../../../b/o/x/Boxing.html" title="Boxing">prize fights</a>. He began writing a weekly sports column for <i>George's Weekly</i>, a Denver newspaper, and opened the Olympic Athletic Club to promote the sport of boxing.</p>
<p>Bat Masterson lived in the American West during a violent and frequently lawless period. He was well-known as a gunman, mostly because of self-promotion. He is confirmed to have killed only one man in a gunfight, not counting any he might have killed at the Battle of Adobe Walls or on the frontier. Despite Bat receiving more fame, his brother James was involved in more (three) gunfights than Bat but with little notoriety. His brother Ed, although depicted in films since as being somewhat out of his element in law enforcement, was in two shootouts during his service as a Dodge City lawman. Therefore, it was Bat's ability to <i>self promote</i> himself, more than any actual accomplishments, that likely led to his notoriety.</p>
<p>The authoritative <i>Encyclopedia of Western Gunfighters</i> (Bill O'Neal, <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Oklahoma_Press_50e1.html" title="University of Oklahoma Press">University of Oklahoma Press</a>, 1979), lists Bat Masterson with one gunfight killing in three fights. When compared to many other well known gunmen of the Old West, including <a href="../../../d/a/l/Dallas_Stoudenmire_7409.html" title="Dallas Stoudenmire">Dallas Stoudenmire</a>, <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Hickok_4f60.html" title="Bill Hickok">"Wild Bill" Hickok</a>, and <a href="../../../c/l/a/Clay_Allison_9e57.html" title="Clay Allison">Clay Allison</a>, Masterson has a less impressive record.</p>
<p>Bat Masterson left the West and went to <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_City_1428.html" title="New York City">New York City</a>, where he continued his service as a lawman. President <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theodore_Roosevelt_3623.html" title="Theodore Roosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a>, on the recommendation of mutual friend Alfred Henry Lewis, appointment Masterson to the position of deputy to U.S. Marshal for the southern district of New York, under William Henkel. Roosevelt had met and become friendly with Masterson on several occasions. Masterson split his time between his writing and keeping the peace in the grand jury room whenever the U. S. Attorney in New York held session. He performed this service for about $2,000 per year from early 1908 until 1912 when President <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Howard_Taft_3129.html" title="William Howard Taft">William Howard Taft</a> removed Masterson from the position during Taft's purge of Roosevelt supporters from government positions.</p>

<p>Bat Masterson had a varied career as a scribe ranging from sports writer and editor to outspoken and passionate columnist. His career as a writer ran from circa 1883 until his death in New York in 1921.</p>
<p>Bat Masterson wrote a letter published in the <i>Daily Kansas State Journal</i>, on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_9.html" title="June 9">June 9</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/8/1883.html" title="1883">1883</a>, that mentioned his arrival in Dodge City, the famous Long Branch saloon, and his famous cohorts who made the Long Branch their headquarters during the so-called "Dodge City Saloon War". It was during this time that Bat met newspaper men Alfred Henry and William Eugene Lewis. Both journalists were destined to play a role in Masterson's future as a scribe.</p>
<p>Masterson published <i>Vox Populi</i>, a single edition newspaper focusing on local Dodge City politics in November 1884.</p>
<p>Masterson penned a weekly sports column for <i>George's Weekly</i> sometime after his arrival in Denver, Colorado, in the late 1890s.</p>
<p>While in New York City, Masterson met up again with the Lewis brothers. Alfred Henry Lewis eventually wrote several short stories and a novel "The Sunset Trail", about Masterson. Alfred Lewis encouraged Bat to write a series of sketches about his adventures which were published by Lewis in the magazine he edited, <i>Human Life</i> (circa 1907-08). Masterson regaled his readers with stories about his days on the frontier and his gunfighter friends. He also explained to his audience what he felt where the best properties of a gunfighter.</p>
<p>Masterson continued his writing career in New York at the <i>New York Morning Telegraph</i> circa 1904. Hired by the younger Lewis brother, William Eugene Lewis, he reprised his role as sports writer, later becoming the paper's sports editor. The politics, sporting events, theaters, fine dining establishments, and varied night life of his adopted city became fodder for his thrice weekly column "Masterson's Views on Timely Topics" for more than 18 years. W. E. Lewis eventually became the general manager and president of the company and promoted his friend Masterson to vice president and company secretary.</p>
<p>Bat Masterson and fellow New Yorker and writer Damon Runyon traveled in similar circles and became friends. Masterson is believed to be the inspiration for <a href="../../../d/a/m/Damon_Runyon_d986.html" title="Damon Runyon">Damon Runyon</a>'s stories that include <a href="../../../s/k/y/Sky_Masterson_ea68.html" title="Sky Masterson">Sky Masterson</a>, a character in <a href="../../../g/u/y/Guys_and_Dolls_da75.html" title="Guys and Dolls">Guys and Dolls</a>. Runyon once commented on Masterson's abilities as a writer saying, "Bat had no literary style but he had plenty of moxie."</p>
