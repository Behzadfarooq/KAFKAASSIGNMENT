I added a second paragraph describing system instability, bugs, and hacking. However, the citation I provided is to an Internet discussion thread started by me. I fully realize that my impartiality on this matter is in question and request that the complaints be verified by other sources.

<dd>Yeah, a forum isn't really a source we should have, and your thread is about what's wrong with BF2, and why you won't buy BF2142; your post, atleast that I see, doesn't even meantion, problems in the beta. We'll need a better source, but it'll be hard to find a source because of the NDA. Also, it should be mentioned that a <a href="../../../b/e/t/Beta.html" title="Beta">beta</a> is to fix these kinds problems, and is not the final product, for sake of NPOV.

<dd>Here at least is a professional site which mentions some of that which was mentioned anecdotally in that discussion thread. "Before we start, our experiences with the multiplayer beta made it clear that it really is a beta client. We have had times when we lost connections or had desktop crashes or couldn’t even load the game at all. That’s to be expected of a game that is not complete yet; we just wanted to make it clear that we are giving our impressions of the game as it stands right now and not making a full judgment." Source: <a href="http://www.firingsquad.com/games/battlefield_2142_preview/default.asp" class="external free" title="http://www.firingsquad.com/games/battlefield_2142_preview/default.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.firingsquad.com/games/battlefield_2142_preview/default.asp</a> While politiely stated, the experienced BF2 player will realize that a) BF2142 is heavily based upon the BF2 engine; b) the current version of BF2 (patch 1.3) is also plagued by connection problems and crashes to desktop (and server crashes); and c) many of those problems were introduced into the completed version of the game via the 1.3 patch on May 23, 2006 and have not been fixed to date, over one hundred days later. BF2142 is also scheduled for release in less than six weeks, or less time than they've already had to fix the problems with BF2. Another, less valuable source may be this opinion piece, which gives dates and descriptions of the problems introduced by the BF2 1.3 patch: <a href="http://www.ngohq.com/home.php?page=articles&amp;go=read&amp;arc_id=109" class="external free" title="http://www.ngohq.com/home.php?page=articles&amp;go=read&amp;arc_id=109" rel="nofollow">http://www.ngohq.com/home.php?page=articles&amp;go=read&amp;arc_id=109</a> Hey, at least I didn't write that one! <a href="../../../s/o/f/User%7ESofa_King_bb5f.html" title="User:Sofa King">User:Sofa King</a> Monday, 2006-09-04 T10:59 UTC</dd>

    <i>P.S. Snoken - vi har sett fram emot Mine 2 och kan lugnt säga att vi inte blev besvikna!</i>
</pre>
<p>I assumed it was Swedish since DICE is a Swedish company, and I translated it online. The best I could do is:</p>
<pre>
    <i>A grass snake- we've seen forward/there opposite Mine 2 and can calmly say that we not became disappointed.</i>
</pre>
<p>It should be noted that Snoken means 'grass snake', but it is the name of the producer of the Mine 2 movie. If there is anyone proficient in Swedish, could you please translate it better so it can be posted?</p>

Wrong, 'Snoken Productions' is the team that makes the movies. Noken is the founder of the team who does most, if not all, of the editing and directing. ~ Swanston</p>

I assume this will be a part of the game, the problem exists however that I am unsure as to whether it is an EU or PAC weapon. My best guess would be that it is an EU assault weapon, as all the known PAC weapons start with NK- (Which im also guessing stands for North Korea, but thats only a guesstimation). I tried to compare uniforms but couldnt come to a conclusion. Also, some screenshots of the unit holding that have an emblem, along with some other vehicles and objects.(See: <a href="http://totalbattlefield2142.com/mambo/images/stories/pcgamer/pc6.jpg" class="external autonumber" title="http://totalbattlefield2142.com/mambo/images/stories/pcgamer/pc6.jpg" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>, <b>1</b>, and <b>2</b>). <i>I</i> believe that the <a href="../../../g/r/i/Griffon.html" title="Griffon">Griffon</a> looking mark is that of the EU, for no other reason that the soldiers do not look of Eastern decent and they hold a weapon that does not appear to be employed by the PAC. That the stranger looking curved vertex mark(see <b>6</b>) is that of either the PAC, or a company who builds that model of mech (the '806').

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Wrong information</span></h2>
<p>Im afraid there is a failure in the article: You are writing about Euro-American union. That is wrong. I believe the official version is only EU.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I concur. The official site says the Western faction is called 'European Union'. I can't find anywhere where it says it's called 'American-European Alliance'.

<dd>The PC Gamer acticle (sourced at the bottom of the article) mentions that the two fighting superpowers are the PAC and an European-American Alliance, but the official site does say it is the EU. So, really, Im not sure what to think. It might be worth mentioning at this time that the EU side is made up of most Western Europe and America?

<dd>Uh, so? The Americans didnt win against Vietnam on their home soil, infact, most land wars on home soil are generally won by the invadees(?), I wont go into WWII history and why the germans lost, but its a pretty unfounded and, well, stupid, chain of reasoning.

<dd>I don't think there is a link between 2142 and Armoured Fury. It's a theory, yes, but I don't think it belongs in Wikipedia. It's not supposed to be a long-running story. Two seperate games. Even if the US was defeated, it wouldn't have been 'absorbed' into the PRC or MEC. Besides, there is a heckuva long gap between 2007 and 2142. About the Soviet/German thingy, Germany invaded the USSR and were eventually pushed back, so they resisted the invasion. Pah, that's unrelated. The fact remains is that there is no United States because the developer's don't want them in it.

<p>As the article already says there will be no communist nation in the game, I have added the currently understood fact that the United States will also not feature. If this fact changes (which, knowing DICE, we might not know until we see the Stars and Stripes in the game on launch day), obviously it should be edited out - Meadow</p>

<hr />
<p>Nobody is right in this argument, and nobody is wrong.</p>
<p>DICE has just created two factions, the EU and the PAC.</p>
<p>Saying that the US is in fact with the EU may rid some sense from the story. Why is the US fighting for Africa instead of South America? If the PAC and EU can't fit into Africa, why can the EU and US? Also, it gets rid of the possiblity of a future expansion/booster pack.</p>
<p>Saying that the US is not with the EU will detract from sales. It's simple, some people in the US are afraid of the world's other megapowers and want to support the US (even in a fictional video game). You know, those guys who always choose USMC in BF2. The over-patriotics.</p>
<p>The good thing about making a futuristic game is that you don't have to be specific about what nations you're talking about. So people are less likely to take sides about what nation they're "with," and more likely to buy the game.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">BF2142: 4th or 5th game?</span></h2>
<p>I know this seems like a minor detail, but it <i>should</i> be factually correct if we are to include it. It all comes down to whether Modern Combat is to be considered a standalone installment of the series, or simply a 'mod' or addition to BF2. The template considers modern combat to be an addition (of sorts) to bf2, and the name of it is <b>Battlefield 2: Modern Combat</b>. Personally, I consider it to be a part of the BF2 franchise, and not a unique installment of the series, which makes 2142 the 4th installment. --<a href="../../../t/r/j/User%7ETrjn_9e48.html" title="User:Trjn">Trjn</a> 11:19, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's a full game, it's not a mod, or addition. It may have the name BF2:MC, but it's not an addition to BF2. And, since we're talking about games, the name doesn't matter(even it is part of BF2 franchise), it's still a full game. Look at the Battlefield series article, MC is listed as a full game. Battlefield 2142 is the 5th game.--<a href="../../../d/p/4/User%7EDp462090_dc75.html" title="User:Dp462090"><b><tt><span style="color: blue"><i>ᎠᏢ</i></span></tt></b></a><a href="../../../d/p/4/User%7EDp462090_Esperanza_e065.html" title="User:Dp462090/Esperanza"><span style="color: green"><b><u>4</u></b></span></a><a href="../../../d/p/4/User_talk%7EDp462090_0ec4.html" title="User talk:Dp462090"><span style="color: red"><tt><b>62090</b></tt></span></a> 14:07, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I honestly can't see how Modern Combat can be considered a game in its own right. It is clearly a modification of Battlefield 2, not a new game. It has simply been altered too much for the publishers to be able to market it under the exact same name without the fans demanding a more accurate port. In my humble view, the situation is clear: There have been four major Battlefield games in the past. — <a href="../../../m/%C3%BC/t/User%7EM%C3%BCtze_359e.html" title="User:Mütze">Mütze</a> 09:03, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Also, if "It has simply been altered too much for the publishers to be able to market it under the exact same name," then should Battlefield: Vietnam, which uses the same engine as Battlefield 1942, not be considered a full game(even though it’s set in Vietnam)? Meaning that there are only three Battlefield games(including Battlefield 2142(which uses the BF2 engine so it could be excluded as well, but for now), and excluding Bad Company). --<a href="../../../d/p/4/User%7EDp462090_dc75.html" title="User:Dp462090"><b><tt><span style="color: blue"><i>ᎠᏢ</i></span></tt></b></a><a href="../../../d/p/4/User%7EDp462090_Esperanza_e065.html" title="User:Dp462090/Esperanza"><span style="color: green"><b><u>4</u></b></span></a><a href="../../../d/p/4/User_talk%7EDp462090_0ec4.html" title="User talk:Dp462090"><span style="color: red"><tt><b>62090</b></tt></span></a> 04:33, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Speculation on future expansion packs?</span></h2>
<p>There has been a lot of controversy about the reasons the US was not in the game (even though there is an official explanation: the US is frozen over). Still, despite the official explanation some say this or that, from the "the US wouldnt just fall" to "hah, the US is finally no longer the hyperpower" blah blah blah.</p>
<p>I just did notice something though that is highly relevant to our goings on here at Wikipedia: in the History of the Cold War (of 2142), it mentions that there are 6 remaining world factions, not two. At the launch of 2142, we will only see (we know for sure) the EU and PAC, with the Union of African States assisting the EU.</p>
<p>However, this means that at least 3 factions (UAS, as not an playable faction, is still up to speculation) that are not in the launch title. This gives some credit to the questions: "what happened to South America?" "what about the Middle East? Is it in the PAC?" "the US co-developed the SCAR 11, is it entirely gone or did it go like the EU to the south?"</p>
<p>Remember Battlefield 2, where the EU was not originally in the game, but was added in an "booster" pack, aka small expansion?</p>
<p>Due to the large amount of controversy generated about these 3 to 4 yet unnamed factions, and given EA's history of adding factions with expansion packs, we here at wikipedia need to consider a few things: 1. Should there be an article on future expected expansion packs, even before the first installment game is released, due to the controversy surrounding the factions? We do have articles on wikipedia about future expected events, be they controversial or not. 2. If such an article is created, what content should be included?</p>
<p>I personally vote "yes" for number 1, but as to number 2 I think we need to write most of it in sandbox first, and edit it to prose before officially creating the article.</p>

There is much more that can be done to this article than speculation over story plot, info, and possible new additions.</p>
<p>I will tell you that the SCAR-11, which obviously gets it's name from the SCAR-L/H, is NOT American made. It's made by FN, a Belgian company, which also makes the M249 SAW LMG.</p>
<p>A number of factions that I can come up with is a North American entity consisting of Canada (or what people remain), the United States, and Mexico. North America, for the most part, is closer to the equator. Europe should be completely covered if Dice said the US was, because they are more North than we are! But never mind that, I can still see remnants for the North moving south into whatever remains of the US and Mexico. The next would be the South American Coalition. That's 2, unless you want to bag the NAA (North American Alliance). The other two or one, w/e you want, would be Oceana and the rest of Asia. You could even say the MEC is still alive and well, or maybe it has assimilated into the UAS, which may be a super power (it would obviously thrive compared to everyone else).</p>
<p>Dice, for the most part, hasn't been able to make a plausible story beginning with Battlefield 2. If you look at what vehicles are being used, and how well trained and advanced the MEC is, you would wonder how it got like that from late 2005 to 2007. I could see this happening in 2012, or around that, but the story is a little too far fetched. And if you look at Middle Eastern armies and the PRC, you can tell their navies are so small and are not trained enough to make any large scale amphibious assault. I bring this up because of Armored Fury, in which both invade the US, and from some map descriptions, seem to be beating the hell out of the US. Even with China's funding into it's armed forces, it's considered to have short arms and legs, meaning it can barely extend it's forces. You expect them to make a full scale assault on the US, and live without being torn to pieces by the US navy, which is larger than the all the worlds navy combined?</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Player limits in Titan mode.</span></h2>
<p><i>Gameplay in Battlefield 2142 includes the classic conquest mode of play with up to 64 players, but it will additionally introduce a new 48-player game mode called "Titan" mode</i></p>
<p>On the demo I've seen Titan servers with 64 players, is this just an override on the servers behalf? Is 48 players the recomended amount of players EA has set? I'd like to clarify this so the statement can possibly be re-worded. <a href="../../../v/a/n/User%7EVanguard_786b.html" title="User:Vanguard">Vanguard</a> 00:00, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>According to what I read so far from the ticker inside the game, it's possible to make a Titan game with more than 48 players, but can lead to massive lag and/or instability. Those who played will have already noticed there's lag problems whenever you are on board a Titan while it's moving. --Shurikane 16:33, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As the case with Australia shows, if it is Spyware or not depends on that countries laws regarding what is Spyware, and how it is treated. Individual consumers obviously have their own views on what's spyware and what's not. The company representative is perfectly correct in saying no spyware is included... because he must only meet the legal definition. That being said if you don't like something on your computer reading what you do, and sending it off for people to know, then you have the choice of not signing the EULA, and returning the game to EA for that reason. However if you sign the EULA, you were informed and consented to it. Always read legal documents before you sign them. [Saturday, 2006-11-04 T 12:30 UTC]</p>

<p>Wilester, you comment about citing a reliable source such as Gamespot. <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/pc/action/battlefield2142/review.html?sid=6159893&amp;tag=topslot;action;1&amp;om_act=convert&amp;click=topslot" class="external text" title="http://www.gamespot.com/pc/action/battlefield2142/review.html?sid=6159893&amp;tag=topslot;action;1&amp;om_act=convert&amp;click=topslot" rel="nofollow">Really?</a> Gamespot has, linked from their main page, stated Battlefield 2142 releases today. When it's not... A commercial site is probably one of the more reliable sources for release dates, especially as the dates go from vague to more exact (It'll be out Q3 2007 as compared to November 11th, 2007). They *have* to be reliable, else they risk false advertising lawsuits, no? <a href="../../../p/d/b/User%7EPdboddy_3d34.html" title="User:Pdboddy">Pdboddy</a> 21:33, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>They do not risk a false advertising law suit for having an erroneous release date. False advertising requires proof of malice or illicit gain, and requires the source to be the one being sued. More importantly commercial sites are routinely incorrect on their release dates, as they are allowed to use the most optomistic figures of the releasing company, thus increasing their presales, and are at no fault if the company later has to push it back. As no company is legal held to the consumer for a release date (though they may be held accountable to retailers they have sales arrangements with) a commercial site is no more or little more likely to be accurate then a informative website or game fan site.

<p>The bf2142.com page has a wiki and has actually content in it, that is genuine. The BF2142wiki.com page blatently copied from basically two sources, bf2142.com and totalbf2142.com. This can even be proven, as they have certain data only bf2142 so far shows, but some of that data is wrong, and to be changed soon there. They did not get it from the original source, otherwise the data would be different. Most of the pages are stubs.</p>

<dd>It is true that bf2142wiki.com is incomplete, but what wiki is complete? It does contain much original content. For example, its guides section contains completely original articles with information that has been added by many users and distilled in a form which cannot be found elsewhere. As an example, <a href="http://bf2142wiki.com/index.php?title=Squad_Tips" class="external text" title="http://bf2142wiki.com/index.php?title=Squad_Tips" rel="nofollow">this section</a> of the guide is completely original content which has been created by several bf2142wiki.com users. Additionally, let it be known that blatant copying of Battlefield 2142 content is not isolated to bf2142wiki.com, both bf2142fever.com and totalbf2142.com completely copy a great deal of content directly from the official website. For example: this page at <a href="http://bf2142fever.com/content/Features" class="external text" title="http://bf2142fever.com/content/Features" rel="nofollow">bf2142fever</a> and <a href="http://www.totalbf2142.com/page.php?do=about" class="external text" title="http://www.totalbf2142.com/page.php?do=about" rel="nofollow">totbf2142</a> are near exact copies of one another, both of which come from the official <a href="http://battlefield.ea.com/battlefield/bf2142/about.aspx" class="external text" title="http://battlefield.ea.com/battlefield/bf2142/about.aspx" rel="nofollow">EA site</a>. There are many other examples of directly copied content between these two sites and many other fan sites: this is a common practice amongst game sites. I do not feel that the reasons given by the above editor are sufficient to remove bf2142wiki.com from the links' fan websites list, since the two sites currently listed remain listed, yet both appear guilty of the infractions cited as the reason for removal of bf2142wiki.com 71.135.5.86 03:58, 7 December 2006 (UTC)

<p>I think it's time we move the weapons back to a separate page, who agrees? DTWATKINS 23:50, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>No we need to slash it in length - it does not require a seperate page - there is nothing innovate or novel about the weapons in this. I'll be upfront and say I'll AFD any seperate weapons page. --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharlesknight_2ce5.html" title="User:Charlesknight">Charlesknight</a> 00:00, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Maybe not split then...but definitely reformatted. It looks like and is a mess. I still think it would be ideal to have a subsection for each class, lesser use of lists, and compression. <a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence%28water%29_e3e9.html" title="User:Silence(water)">Silence(water)</a> 23:47, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yeah I'm trying to clean it up at the moment. I'm splitting the weapons up into their respective classes by unlock tier (and the general weapons will have their own section). I'll try to cut down on their lengths tommorow.<a href="../../../e/c/h/User%7EEcho.brian_3ebd.html" title="User:Echo.brian">Echo.brian</a> 01:34, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Very nice job. I was doing a similar thing in OpenOffice, but I didn't bother to cut down the length, which made things difficult.<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence%28water%29_e3e9.html" title="User:Silence(water)">Silence(water)</a> 20:40, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I've finished the reorganization. All that's left is to limit the amount of content (and grammatical and spelling checks).<a href="../../../e/c/h/User%7EEcho.brian_3ebd.html" title="User:Echo.brian">Echo.brian</a> 21:36, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Needs to be fixed to oblivion, so I agree. I believe it should be moved to a separate article due to its size. However, if it stays in poor condition, it should be slashed per to <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharlesknight_2ce5.html" title="User:Charlesknight">Charlesknight</a>. --<span style="font-family:'Script MT Bold'"><b><a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_Pembroke_734a.html" title="User:William Pembroke"><span style="color:Cyan">William</span> <span style="color:Grey">Pembroke</span></a></b></span><span style="font-family:'times new roman'"><sup><a href="../../../w/i/l/User_talk%7EWilliam_Pembroke_f226.html" title="User talk:William Pembroke">(talk)</a></sup></span> 04:12, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>If we move the weapons/equips, we might as well move the infantry classes as well. No point in leaving the classes behind, don't you agree? We might call it "Battlefield 2142 Gameplay Information" or something, if we move it.

<dd>voting is evil. Can anyone explain to me what is interesting or innovative about the weapons or framework in which they operate that requires a seperate article in a general readers encylopedia? The current move had been to delete such articles unless there is so evidence that something of that nature is being presented. As far as I can work out, it's just the bog-standard Machineguns, sniper-rifles, pistols (plus upgrades) that you would find in 100s of games like this. --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharlesknight_2ce5.html" title="User:Charlesknight">Charlesknight</a> 00:52, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"I suspect this was copied from some other site." I'm serious, I wrote about 90% of the weapons section (the rest was either already there or written by other users such as yourself). But are you saying you wouldn't suspect copying from anotehr site if it were written in thrid person? Because it seems sort of odd that other sites would <i>only</i> use second person. Also, all the bf2142 sites I've been too either just have pictures of the weapons or tell you which order to unlock them in. Either way, the section's gone now so it doesn't matter. I'm just curious though, for the future, am I allowed to write sections, or do I have to try and piece together quotes from websites that have some sort of distant relation to one another?<a href="../../../e/c/h/User%7EEcho.brian_3ebd.html" title="User:Echo.brian">Echo.brian</a> 04:06, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Patch List</span></h2>
<p>I think the patch list should be re-added in a reduced form. Battlefield 2 has a patch list and one of the biggest criticisms about the battlefield series is bugs and bug fixing. I don't think every fix should be listed for each patch, it should be like the bf2 list - the number of the patch and the major fixes or summary of the fixes in each patch (one or two lines max). Wikipedia should provide this as a quick reference with a link to details of each patch.
