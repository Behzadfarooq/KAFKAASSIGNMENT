<p>Isn't there any more about the importance of this article, as well as the fact that the main Iraqi forces didn't get into the fight, but were pinned down north of the border by air strikes? This battle was badly understood by US Central Command at the time. The page should reflect this better. Darkmind1970 10:23, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Is there any evidence of that at all, and if so, is it any good? This sounds biased to be. Also, why focus of 11 Marines who got killed by blue on blue, when the Iraqi army lost over a thousand killed or captured? Does the press really expect friendly fire incidents to be completely preventable? It used to be much worse.

It states 2,000 dead and 300 vehicles destroyed out of 2 Iraqi divisions (~20,000 men). Air power is a force multiplier, "they" should have known better than to attack without air superiority. In the <a href="../../../d/i/e/Dieppe_Raid_69d3.html" title="Dieppe Raid">Dieppe Raid</a> almost 1,000 Canadians were killed out of only 6,000 total allied troops involved in the invasion. 10% Iraqi dead in 3 days of the Battle of Khafji is a lower percentage than whats listed in that article.

<p>Sorry but an iraqi divison during the gulf war have 8000 men because the rest is placed in reserve. During this battle, the coalition have never destroyed 2 iraqi division because during the ground offensive they fight the second armorded divsion in the kuwait international airport and in the al-jaber air base.

<dd>Well, you got me there, 2,000 dead out of 16,000, not 20,000. My mistake. I'm still waiting for an alternative source, at least the current list of 2,000 has a source. Even if it was only 1 division that's still 2,000 out of 8,000. Considering the air superiority factor the attack would almost have been suicide. Attacking without artillery or air support against a defending force that has both, <b>will</b> result in heavy losses.

<p>Only 3 iraqi brigade were engage in the battle to a total of 6000 men (2000 men in a brigade). The top Saudi commander, Gen. Khalid Bin Sultan, as saying the Iraqis suffered 200 dead and the pda say that iraqi suffered 200 dead. As well, many other analyst is agree with this and your casualties are just an estimate. For me, i think 200 casualties are high but its the real number.</p>

<dd>They are not "My" casualty numbers. I did not put them in the article, I'm simply trying to find out why an anonymous user wants to delete the current numbers without reference, and originally without comment. The WA Post article you cite is from the day after the battle. I'm not sure how accurate it will be considering one of the major gripes in this article is lack of media coverage in the immediate aftermath of the battle. Titus's paper looks very well researched and has many citations. I would trust it more than a press article from January 31, 1991, during the battle. Replace the number with an alternate, properly cited, casualty figure. An anon user simply deleting a number with no comment looks more like vandalism than editing. <a href="../../../d/u/a/User%7EDual_Freq_ca05.html" title="User:Dual Freq">Dual Freq</a> 22:49, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm sufficiently convinced by Titus's paper and have no interest in researching it further. I have no intention of changing it, but I wouldn't object to someone putting an alternative, that is referenced. Possibly something like, various reports on casualties, ranging from 200 to over 2000. (with a citation referring to the low and the high numbers.) Also, I suppose it depends on what is counted as the battle of Khafji, the 2,000 number is accounting for forces enroute to the site in Kuwait, and forces in Khafji proper. Maybe your 200 number is only in the Khafji vicinity. <a href="../../../d/u/a/User%7EDual_Freq_ca05.html" title="User:Dual Freq">Dual Freq</a> 23:49, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I dont no why you talking about Canada, and some people in Calgary are racist against french. The battle of Ras Al-Khafji have realy exist. I just say that, 2000 is to high if you wont you can wirte 200-2000 casualties this is neutral. If its neutral you can accept the other opinion and i dont find an other analyst who have wrote 2000 casualties so you based your opinion in just 1 analyst and 1 its not enough.</p>

<p>As far as I was aware the Iraqis committed three divisions into the battle. I imagine that the casualty count must include the horrific losses that the Iraqis took when they were hit by coalition airpower as well. Darkmind1970 13:58, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The republican guard was never deployed in this battle its just an element of the 3 corps and its not the real number of casualties for Iraq.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 70.82.226.40 (<a href="../../../7/0/2E/User_talk%7E70.82.226.40.html" title="User talk:70.82.226.40">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_70.82.226.40_b03a.html" title="Special:Contributions/70.82.226.40">contribs</a>) 05:54, January 7, 2007 (UTC)</small></p>
