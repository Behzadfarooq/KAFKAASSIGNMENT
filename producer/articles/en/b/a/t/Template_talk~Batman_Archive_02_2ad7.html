I have looked at this discussion for a few minutes and I have absolutely no idea what is being disputed. It appears that everyone has burst into a circle of personal attacks and has forgotten that we are here to build an encyclopedia. No one in particular is at fault for this mess, as everyone has contributed to the tension in some way, inadvertantly or not. So, the <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">bad faith assumptions</a> and <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">personal attacks</a> end here - let us state calmly and impartially <i>what</i> exactly about this template is the source of the dispute? Content is what is important - whether someone made a personal attack on you is not grounds to revert their changes. Once we determine what the problem(s) is/are, then perhaps we can go one step at a time to reach some sort of compromise. Rewriting the entire template at once doesn't seem to be getting anywhere, of course. Well, then, what specific details are being disputed?

<dd>Besides condensing space, my main concern has been limiting links to "primary" links, such that it could be easily navigated by someone less familiar with the subject than comic book fans. The popularity of the movies alone would seem to suggest that people casually interested in a Batman subject might read one of these articles and then wish to read more. My opinion is the links have no need for movies broken down by creator or continuity (as those distinctions are less important to casual readers), ignore video games (plenty of links out there in video game threads), movies that have not been made (which can be commented on in existing movie articles), and limit characters/places/enemies to only the most notable (read: those that have crossed over between movies and comics). -<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkeer_0d07.html" title="User:Markeer">Markeer</a> 19:58, 8 August 2006 (UTC)

<p>Re enemies, I'm really happy with the list we've got now. It's all the film villains in film order, which would be really useful to the casual reader. Re straw poll, that would be a good idea.

<p>We need to remove the dead space, condense the information, do away with too many descriptors. For instance, all of the movies should be grouped together regardless of director or star. For the two movies with the same name, put "(1966)" and "(1989)" next to them. I would prefer the template be arranged more like {{<a href="../../../l/o/s/Template%7ELostNav_e0d4.html" title="Template:LostNav">LostNav</a>}} or {{<a href="../../../x/-/m/Template%7EX-Men_768b.html" title="Template:X-Men">X-Men</a>}}. --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisGriswold_2071.html" title="User:ChrisGriswold">Chris Griswold</a> 00:26, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Well, if the main disputant in this incident isn't responding, there doesn't seem to be too much to mediate. It's as simple as coming to a consensus before making possibly contriversial changes to the template - do people agree, for example, with Chris Griswold's idea above of grouping together all the movies?

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Suggested additions</span></h2>
<p>I was going to add a few things to the template but then I noticed the brouhaha going on here so I thought I'd put the suggestions out there instead. I suggest:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adding <i>Justice League of America</i> to the current series, since Batman is playing a major role in that new series.</li>
<li>Adding another column for "past series". Obviously I wouldn't suggest listing every title in which Batman played a role, just the major ones like <i>Batman and the Outsiders</i>, <i>Brave and the Bold</i> (actually isn't that title going again?), <i>Batman Family</i> and <i>World's Finest</i> to name a few.

<dd>And why does the template list all these creators?</dd>
<dd>Bob Kane • Bill Finger • Neal Adams • Julius Schwartz • Dennis O'Neil • Frank Miller • Greg Rucka • Paul Dini</dd>
<dd>If that's supposed to be a list of everyone who ever created any Batman character, that's not enough. If it's supposed to name those who created Batman, it's too many. I say cut the list down to Kane and Finger. <a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoczilla_1c36.html" title="User:Doczilla">Doczilla</a> 20:27, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Remember the one guy who got upset when <a href="../../../c/m/c/WP%7ECMC_eb00.html" title="WP:CMC">WP:CMC</a> "took over" his Batman template? The continuities were his idea, and pretty much nobody but him thought it was a good idea.</p>
<p>As for the creators, it was originally Kane, Finger, O'Neil, and Miller; people keep adding and removing names. Kane and Finger should certainly be on there, but I think a case can be made to include writers/artists whose articles are significantly devoted to their work on Batman. That would definitely include Miller, would arguably include Dini, but probably nobody else. Another idea would be to include artists who whose work on Batman established styles that outlived their own runs; that would probably include everyone there except maybe Rucka and would also include Jim Lee. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 22:21, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Once you include anyone other than Kane and Finger, you open the gap for editors to keep adding and removing others. <a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoczilla_1c36.html" title="User:Doczilla">Doczilla</a> 08:42, 17 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Well, let's make a rule so we have a standard by which to discuss the appropriateness. Half of Frank Miller's article is about Batman and nobody can really dispute Miller's influence, so it's clearly relevant. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 00:39, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>So it's
<ul>
<li>Bob Kane, who created Batman</li>
<li>Bill Finger, who co-created, fleshed the character out, gave him his origin</li>
<li>Frank Miller, who made crucial revisions to the origin like Alfred raising Bruce -- not to mention how the Dark Knight business reshaped how people thought of the character.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>Many writers have tweaked the origin, but nothing so critical with long lasting effects. <a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoczilla_1c36.html" title="User:Doczilla">Doczilla</a> 00:49, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I don't know. Seeing the template now, I still think it should just be Kane &amp; Finger. I'll leave Miller so other people can weigh in to indicate what the consensus might be. <a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoczilla_1c36.html" title="User:Doczilla">Doczilla</a> 00:51, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'd be tempted leave Miller in on the strength of Year One - it pretty much re-booted Batman post-Crisis. But I'm not sure it fits with the credit "creators". I'm also not sure about leaving so many people out. Is there a list of Batman writers somewhere on Wikipedia, perhaps as a section in another article, that could be linked to from the template? 172.189.220.211 00:58, 18 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I can't find such a list, but creating one is a decent idea. "Notable Batman writers and artists" perhaps? Wikipedia has notability standards, so "notable" is all right, although it will still raise some arguments and POV issues. <a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoczilla_1c36.html" title="User:Doczilla">Doczilla</a> 01:06, 18 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Cool. So, should that be added after Kane and Finger (and then I think everyone else can be left out)? Or could that perhas go into the Miscelaneous section, and the Creators section could be dropped from the template altogether? 172.189.220.211 01:18, 18 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>After we flesh out <a href="../../../n/o/t/Notable_Batman_creators_b061.html" title="Notable Batman creators">Notable Batman creators</a> some more, it should go in the Creators section. Right now, it needs a lot of work to keep from (a) being OR or (b) growing without end <a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoczilla_1c36.html" title="User:Doczilla">Doczilla</a> 01:19, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>And I still think this template should list only Kane and Finger. Superman's template lists only Siegel &amp; Shuster. <a href="../../../n/o/t/Notable_Batman_creators_b061.html" title="Notable Batman creators">Notable Batman creators</a> can properly acknowledge Miller. <a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoczilla_1c36.html" title="User:Doczilla">Doczilla</a> 06:03, 18 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Well, that didn't last long. Somebody already put Denny O' back in the template. So it's Kane and Finger, the creators. When <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_notable_Batman_creators_54e4.html" title="List of notable Batman creators">List of notable Batman creators</a> (or some alternative) looks right, we can link the template to it. <a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoczilla_1c36.html" title="User:Doczilla">Doczilla</a> 04:28, 19 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>My bad. Normally I don't even look at or use the Templates. I happened to glance down and saw Frank Miller being placed above Denny and equal to Kane and Finger, and it hurt my head so much I didn't think to check the Talk page and see if there was discussion on the subject.

<p>Allies/supporting cast: Jason Todd isn't currently an ally.</p>

<p>Jason Todd was an ally (or a deceased ally) for decades, and the fact that Todd is the Red Hood is probably a spoiler for someone. As for Catwoman, she was a Batman villain for the longest time and still is an on-again off-again antagonist. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 01:12, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That's why I left "Rogues" alone when it was called that. Whether Catwoman is currently enemy or ally, she remains a class part of his rogue's gallery. If we come up with a satisfying group name for the other characters, we might be able to sell "Rogues" (not that I wouldn't be happy for an even better suggestion to emerge). <a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoczilla_1c36.html" title="User:Doczilla">Doczilla</a> 02:31, 23 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, the article that is linked is named "Batman villains".

<dd>True. But what the hell is Catwoman? Post-Crisis, she really hasn't been a villain/enemy to him. That's twenty years. <a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoczilla_1c36.html" title="User:Doczilla">Doczilla</a> 02:44, 23 October 2006 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Villains</span></h2>
<p>Looking at the most recent edits, I realized that it's not very intuitive to click on the large "Villains" in order to get to <a href="../../../b/a/t/Batman_villains.html" title="Batman villains">Batman villains</a>. Perhaps "Batman Villains" could be added to that list of notable villains?<a href="../../../d/1/p/User%7ED1Puck1T_7199.html" title="User:D1Puck1T">D1Puck1T</a> 01:41, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree, I almost added the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Batman_villains.html" title="Batman villains">Batman villains</a> entry at the end the list a few days ago because I didn't recognize that the category line was a link. Same with 'Allies'. It's arguable in my case that I'm just unobservant or dumb (always a possibility) but neutralizing the category link and adding the "and others" links in the template body would at least make it idiot proof. -<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkeer_0d07.html" title="User:Markeer">Markeer</a> 03:41, 28 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Similarly to the link to other contributors after Kane and Finger. I know what you mean.

<dd>Nearly did the same thing myself Markeer.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Cassandra Cain</span></h2>
<p>Oy, what a headache. Yes, she is a significant enough character to be listed seperately in the box somewhere. Putting her under villains is likely to ruffle a lot of feathers though, and it's note entirely accurate either, since she only fought Robin and not Batman. Allies... I don't feel that fits either.

<dd>Thing is, she's "only" notable as a Batman-related character as Batgirl. - <a href="../../../j/c/3/User%7EJc37_cfd0.html" title="User:Jc37">jc37</a> 01:13, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Okay... I'm not sure I agree with that statement, but even then, she <i>is</i> notable as Batgirl. And the Batgirl article is spread out to cover several characters as well as the real world creation of the "Batgirl" persona. Tim Drake is "only" notable as Robin, but he's listed seperately from the Robin article. I'm thinking the way to go is put Cassandra in parenthesies after <a href="../../../b/a/t/Batgirl.html" title="Batgirl">Batgirl</a>. She's the one to wear the mantle most recently, she'll be officially wearing it again soon enough, and while she doesn't quite fit as an ally right now, "Batgirl" is an ally, Cassandra Cain is the most recent Batgirl... it's not perfect, but there's going to confusion no matter how it's broken down, unfortunately. <a href="../../../d/1/p/User%7ED1Puck1T_7199.html" title="User:D1Puck1T">D1Puck1T</a> 01:59, 2 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>She's not Batgirl right now, and she tended to stay out of Batman's stories. Cassandra Cain is not in Batman's supporting cast. She is not an ally any more. She has not been meaningfully involved with Batman outside her role as Batgirl, and Batgirl is already linked, as opposed to Barbara who has not been Batgirl for twenty years but has been very involved as Oracle. Many, many characters have contributed more to Batman's stories than Cassandra Cain has. Bullock belongs there before she does (and I am not saying he belongs there). <a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoczilla_1c36.html" title="User:Doczilla">Doczilla</a> 07:08, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I agree. Jason belongs under the villains for now. He hasn't been an ally/supporting cast member for a lot of years. His only active involvement with Batman since his death has been as an antagonist. <a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoczilla_1c36.html" title="User:Doczilla">Doczilla</a> 07:37, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
