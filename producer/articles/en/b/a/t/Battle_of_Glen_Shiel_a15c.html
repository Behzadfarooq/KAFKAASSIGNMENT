<p>After the <a href="../../../t/r/e/Treaty_of_Utrecht_0c82.html" title="Treaty of Utrecht">Treaty of Utrecht</a>, <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philip_V_of_Spain_2f3b.html" title="Philip V of Spain">Philip V</a> was accepted as <a href="../../../k/i/n/King_of_Spain_cfeb.html" title="King of Spain">King of Spain</a> in exchange for several concessions. Great Britain had received control over Spanish possessions like <a href="../../../m/e/n/Menorca.html" title="Menorca">Menorca</a> and <a href="../../../g/i/b/Gibraltar.html" title="Gibraltar">Gibraltar</a>, which it could defend as Britain possessed the biggest navy in the world at that time.</p>
<p>Philip's plans to restore Spanish power would lead to a violent clash with Britain. Philip and his Italian counsellor Cardinal <a href="../../../g/i/u/Giulio_Alberoni_cdac.html" title="Giulio Alberoni">Giulio Alberoni</a> carried out a campaign in the western <a href="../../../m/e/d/Mediterranean.html" title="Mediterranean">Mediterranean</a>. In 1717, 8500 infantry men and 500 cavalry men sailed from <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barcelona.html" title="Barcelona">Barcelona</a> and occupied <a href="../../../s/a/r/Sardinia.html" title="Sardinia">Sardinia</a> without difficulty. <a href="../../../1/7/1/1718.html" title="1718">Next year</a>, 38,000 troops did the same with <a href="../../../s/i/c/Sicily.html" title="Sicily">Sicily</a>.</p>
<p>The British response occurred on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_11.html" title="August 11">11 August</a>; declaring a violation of Utrecht the British navy intercepted and destroyed the fleet of José Antonio de Gaztañeta in the region of Cape Passaro, (near <a href="../../../s/y/r/Syracuse%2C_Italy_db3e.html" title="Syracuse, Italy">Syracuse</a>). Spain then declared war with Alberoni deciding to take the initiative and stir up trouble in Britain before an attack on the <a href="../../../i/b/e/Iberian_Peninsula_03ea.html" title="Iberian Peninsula">Iberian Peninsula</a> could take place.</p>
<p><b>The Alberoni Plan</b></p>
<p><a href="../../../g/i/u/Giulio_Alberoni_cdac.html" title="Giulio Alberoni">Giulio Alberoni</a> decided to meddle in the throne disputes, supporting the Jacobite claims and its Highland allies both to de-stabilise the Crown and set up a more pliant king (and Parliament) in its place.</p>
<p>The original plan had two phases:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Keith_160a.html" title="George Keith">George Keith</a>, tenth <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earl_Marischal_37ed.html" title="Earl Marischal">Earl Marischal</a> would infiltrate Scotland with 300 Spanish <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marine_%28armed_services%29.html" title="Marine (armed services)">marines</a> to raise the Western clans and take some positions. It was a distraction manoeuvre to take defences from England.</li>
<li>The main fleet, with 27 ships and 7000 men under <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Butler%2C_2nd_Duke_of_Ormonde_deab.html" title="James Butler, 2nd Duke of Ormonde">James Butler, 2nd Duke of Ormonde</a> (the former Captain General of the British army, exiled in Spain), would disembark in <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_West_England_127e.html" title="South West England">South West England</a> or <a href="../../../w/a/l/Wales.html" title="Wales">Wales</a>, where Jacobites were abounding. The resulting alliance would march east to siege London, depose <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_I_of_Great_Britain_5447.html" title="George I of Great Britain">George I</a> and enthrone <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Francis_Edward_Stuart_a104.html" title="James Francis Edward Stuart">James Stuart</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Three weeks after leaving <a href="../../../c/a/d/Cadiz.html" title="Cadiz">Cadiz</a>, Ormonde's fleet encountered a storm near <a href="../../../c/a/p/Cape_Finisterre_8fb3.html" title="Cape Finisterre">Cape Finisterre</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/r/March_29.html" title="March 29">29 March</a>) leaving most of the ships dispersed and damaged. Ormonde was forced to withdraw and the ships taken to several Spanish havens. (Compare with the fate of the <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spanish_Armada_a625.html" title="Spanish Armada">Spanish Armada</a> of <a href="../../../1/5/8/1588.html" title="1588">1588</a>) By then, Keith had already left the Spanish port of Pasajes and occupied the <a href="../../../i/s/l/Isle_of_Lewis_3d93.html" title="Isle of Lewis">Isle of Lewis</a>, including <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stornoway%2C_Outer_Hebrides_cfce.html" title="Stornoway, Outer Hebrides">Stornoway</a> where he set camp. On <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_13.html" title="April 13">13 April</a> <a href="../../../1/7/1/1719.html" title="1719">1719</a> Keith's men disembarked on the Highlands near <a href="../../../l/o/c/Lochalsh.html" title="Lochalsh">Lochalsh</a>, although the Highlanders however did not join the "Little Rising" in the expected numbers (the Spaniards carried 2000 guns to distribute), mistrusting the enterprise and waiting for news from the South. Keith could not proceed to <a href="../../../i/n/v/Inverness.html" title="Inverness">Inverness</a> and established his headquarter in the castle of <a href="../../../e/i/l/Eilean_Donan_9675.html" title="Eilean Donan">Eilean Donan</a>.</p>
<p>The two Spanish frigates returned to Spain. The Spaniards were accompanied by <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Mackenzie%2C_5th_Earl_of_Seaforth_f863.html" title="William Mackenzie, 5th Earl of Seaforth">William Mackenzie, 5th Earl of Seaforth</a>, who was chief of the Clan Mackenzie; the Earl Marischal; and the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marquess_of_Tullibardine_3ed2.html" title="Marquess of Tullibardine">Marquess of Tullibardine</a>; and some Irish officers. They were joined by a few hundred Highlanders including members of the <a href="../../../c/l/a/Clan_MacRae_ad96.html" title="Clan MacRae">Clan MacRae</a>, <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Roy_MacGregor_9a82.html" title="Robert Roy MacGregor">Robert Roy MacGregor</a>, and a party of MacGregors. Some days later, the main of the troop went south to stir again the Highlanders, leaving a small garrison (40-50 men) at the castle. The Jacobite forces were to be led by the <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earl_of_Seaforth_74f3.html" title="Earl of Seaforth">Earl of Seaforth</a> and also by <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Cameron_d711.html" title="John Cameron">John Cameron of Lochiel</a>, 18th Captain and Chief of <a href="../../../c/l/a/Clan_Cameron_89b2.html" title="Clan Cameron">Clan Cameron</a>; along with Lord George Murray. Their plan of action was to advance upon and capture <a href="../../../i/n/v/Inverness.html" title="Inverness">Inverness</a>.</p>
<p><b>The capture and destruction of Eilean Donan castle</b></p>
<p>At the beginning of May the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Navy_80f7.html" title="Royal Navy">Royal Navy</a> sent five ships to the area for reconnaissance: two patrolling off <a href="../../../i/s/l/Isle_of_Skye_fdfe.html" title="Isle of Skye">Skye</a> and three around Lochalsh, adjacent to <a href="../../../l/o/c/Loch_Duich_7f17.html" title="Loch Duich">Loch Duich</a>. Early in the morning on Sunday <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_10.html" title="May 10">10 May</a> these latter three, <i><a href="../../../h/m/s/HMS_Worcester_c5ef.html" title="HMS Worcester">HMS Worcester</a></i>, <i>HMS Flamborough</i>, and <i><a href="../../../h/m/s/HMS_Enterprise_f833.html" title="HMS Enterprise">HMS Enterprise</a></i>, anchored off <a href="../../../e/i/l/Eilean_Donan_9675.html" title="Eilean Donan">Eilean Donan</a>, where the Spanish forces had established a base.</p>
<p>Their first move was to send a boat ashore under a flag of truce to negotiate, but when the Spanish soldiers in the castle fired at the boat it was recalled and all three ships opened fire on the castle for an hour or more. They then shifted anchorage and waited, the wind blowing a fresh gale.</p>
<p>The next morning acting on intelligence from a Spanish deserter, the commanding officer, Captain Boyle of the <i>Worcester</i>, sent the <i>Enterprise</i> up the river to capture a house being used to store <a href="../../../g/u/n/Gunpowder.html" title="Gunpowder">gunpowder</a> but, according to the naval logs, the rebels on the shore set fire to the house as the ship approached. Meanwhile the other two ships continued to bombard the castle at intervals while they prepared a landing party.</p>
<p>In the evening, under the cover of an intense cannonade, the ships' boats went ashore and captured the castle against little resistance. According to HMS <i>Worcester'</i>s log, in the castle they found "an Irishman, a captain, a Spanish lieutenant, a serjeant, one Scotch rebel and 39 Spanish soldiers, 343 barrels of powder and 52 barrels of musquet shot". Having captured the castle the British then "burnt several barns etc where they had a quantity of corn for the use of their camp".</p>
<p>The Naval force spent the next two days demolishing the castle (it took 27 barrels of gunpowder). The Spanish prisoners were put on board <i>HMS Flamborough</i> and taken away to <a href="../../../e/d/i/Edinburgh.html" title="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a>.</p>

<p>The great natural strength of the Jacobite's position had been increased by hasty fortifications. A barricade had been made across the road, and along the face of the hill on the north side of the river entrenchments had been thrown up. Here the main body was posted, consisting of:</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Glen_Shiel_a15c.html" title="Edit section: The Battle of Glen Shiel">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Battle of Glen Shiel</span></h2>
<p>After moving around for one month, the Spaniards learnt by the beginning of June that Ormonde would never come. In spite of this, they gathered clansmen for a last action summing 1000 troops.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_5.html" title="June 5">5 June</a>, British government forces made from both English and Scottish soldiers under General Joseph Wightman came from <a href="../../../i/n/v/Inverness.html" title="Inverness">Inverness</a> to block their march. They consisted of 850 infantry, 120 dragoons and 4 mortar batteries.</p>
<p>They confronted the Jacobites at Glen Shiel, just a few miles from <a href="../../../l/o/c/Loch_Duich_7f17.html" title="Loch Duich">Loch Duich</a>, on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_10.html" title="June 10">June 10</a>, near the Five Sisters hills. The Spanish took their advantage to occupy the top and the front of one of the hills while the Jacobite Scots mounted barricades on the sides.</p>
<p>The engagement began between about five and six o'clock when the left wing of the British government army advanced against Lord George Murray's position on the south side of the river. The position was first shelled by the mortar batteries and then attacked by four platoons of Clayton's regiment and Munro's. After some initial stubborn resistance Lord George Murray's men who were not supported were driven from their position and forced to retreat.</p>
<p>Once the Jacobite's right wing had been dislodged General Joseph Wightman ordered his right wing to attack the Jacobite's left.</p>
<p>The detachment commanded by chief of MacKenzies Lord Seaforth was strongly positioned behind a group of rocks on the hillside. It was against them that British right wing troops of Harrison's and Montigue's regiments were directed. Seaforth was reinforced by his own men under Sir John MacKenzie. Finding themselves hard pressed by the government troops Seaforth sent for further reinforcements. Another reinforcement of men under Rob Roy went to his aid but before it could reach him his men had given way and Seaforth himself was badly wounded.</p>
<p>Wightman concentrated his troops on the flanks while the mortars battered the whole and kept the Spaniards in their positions. Wightman's whole force was now directed toward the Jacobite centre.</p>
<p>The Spanish regulars stood their ground well but found that most of their allies had deserted them so they too retreated up the hill. Rob Roy had become severely wounded and his clan MacGregor left the battle to save him. Other clans followed and left their allies retreating uphill.</p>
<p>At 9 o'clock in the evening, they surrendered, three hours after the start of the combat, while the remaining Jacobites fled into the fog, to escape an execution as traitors.</p>
<p>The Jacobites were poorly provisioned and armed, and when expected Jacobite support from the <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scottish_Lowlands_458d.html" title="Scottish Lowlands">Lowlanders</a> was minimal, spirits fell completely. The Rising was abandoned and the Jacobites dispersed to their homes.</p>
<p>The mountain in Glen Shiel on which the battle took place is called <a href="../../../s/g/u/Sgurr_na_Ciste_Duibhe_b31a.html" title="Sgurr na Ciste Duibhe">Sgurr na Ciste Duibhe</a>, it has a subsidiary peak which was named <b>Sgurr nan Spainteach</b> (The Peak of the Spaniards) in honour of the Spanish forces who fought admirably in the battle.</p>

<p>Of the Jacobite commanders the son of the chief of Clan Murray; Lord Geroge Murray, the chief of Clan MacKenzie; Lord Seaforth and Rob Roy the chief of <a href="../../../c/l/a/Clan_MacGregor_cc22.html" title="Clan MacGregor">Clan MacGregor</a>, all three were badly wounded.

<p>On the Government side casualties were lighter, George Munro of Culcairn was wounded in the legs by musket shot but survived.</p>
