<h2><span class="mw-headline">Omaha</span></h2>
<p>I changed it to 1,000 asshole. It seems that in many of these types of pages people keep stating what were the casaulties as the number killed. As a reminder, when you read in another source that there were X number of casualties it is not referring to the number killed. --Wdywtk 23:56, 26 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Work needed to make Battle of Normandy a featured article</span></h2>
<p>Apologies for creating a new section at the top of this Talk page (and please move it to the bottom if I've violated Wikipedia convention) but I thought it worthwhile to draw immediate attention to the <a href="../../../f/e/a/Featured_article_candidates.html#Battle_of_Normandy" title="Featured article candidates">featured article nomination</a> of the Battle of Normandy.</p>
<p>The article was nominated at 12:22, 6 Jun 2004 (UTC) and at this time has four Support votes and one Objection. I've copied the Objection and my reply below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Object - Too many sections = overwhelming TOC (see <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_is_a_featured_article_4840.html" title="Wikipedia:What is a featured article">Wikipedia:What is a featured article</a>). I suggest an easy fix: Combine all sub-sections under ===Landings=== into one H3 section except for ====German reaction==== which should be promoted to an H3 and eventually expanded a bit. Also, nix the ==Historical significance== section and move that sentence to the end of the lead section (single paragraph sections are bad enough - single sentence ones are horrid). --<a href="../../../m/a/v/User%7EMaveric149_24ee.html" title="User:Maveric149">mav</a> 00:59, 12 Jun 2004 (UTC)</li>
<li>Support, with some reservations. I agree with the esteemed <a href="../../../m/a/v/User%7EMaveric149_24ee.html" title="User:Maveric149">mav</a> that ===Landings=== has too many sub-sections, but disagree on the solution. I'd keep the five D-Day beaches as sub-sections, edit the three parachute landings sections into two (north/south, Brit/US -- roughly) and move the ====Mulberry harbours==== content to ===Special preparations=== earlier in the article. That still leaves seven sub-sections, but I do seriously believe all five beaches and all the major parachute landing sites deserve their own sections; the names of those beaches especially are national icons. Having done recent non-minor editing on ==Historical significance== I agree it should be moved, there's not enough there. However, it is a two sentence para.&#160;;) Finally, as one of the recent contributors to the article, I'm really glad to see it nominated and will try to keep working to make it better. See <a href="../../../b/a/t/Talk%7EBattle_of_Normandy_1bfe.html" title="Talk:Battle of Normandy">Talk:Battle of Normandy</a> for further discussion! - <a href="../../../m/a/d/User%7EMadmagic_062e.html" title="User:Madmagic">Madmagic</a> 08:44, Jun 12, 2004 (UTC)</li>

<p>Comments, ideas? Anyone else willing to do whatever we can, to get this article up to featured status in the next week? <a href="../../../m/a/d/User%7EMadmagic_062e.html" title="User:Madmagic">Madmagic</a> 21:15, Jun 12, 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Sounds good to me. I think we should also flesh out the <i>Utah Beach</i> section to the same size as the others. <a href="../../../d/j/_/User%7EDJ_Clayworth_c4dc.html" title="User:DJ Clayworth">DJ Clayworth</a> 12:57, 15 Jun 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Actually there was one thing I was going to suggest. The article is supposed to be about the Battle of Normandy, but it is in fact almost entirely about the landings. If we expanded the rest of the battle to the same detail the article would be enormous. Should we maybe turn this into <a href="../../../i/n/v/Invasion_of_Normandy_25a4.html" title="Invasion of Normandy">Invasion of Normandy</a> or <a href="../../../n/o/r/Normandy_landings.html" title="Normandy landings">Normandy landings</a> and start a new article 'Battle of Normandy' giving more details about the subsequent battles? <a href="../../../d/j/_/User%7EDJ_Clayworth_c4dc.html" title="User:DJ Clayworth">DJ Clayworth</a> 13:01, 15 Jun 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Good points DJ. I wonder if it would make the most sense to somehow break down and expand the article by chronology? For example, a detailed article or articles on the plans and preparations -- the deception plans and the Mulberry harbours both seem to deserve their own articles, for example -- another on the actual D-Day events, another on the post-D-Day events (Cherbourg, the breakout from the pocket, etc.) Part of the reason why I suggest this is, it would allow preserving the events of June 6th as a whole article. While the day of the landings was only one day in the month+ battle of Normandy, it seems to me many people would come to Wikipedia seeking specific information about D-Day, rather than an overview of the entire battle. Thoughts? <a href="../../../m/a/d/User%7EMadmagic_062e.html" title="User:Madmagic">Madmagic</a> 08:01, Jun 17, 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Ooops, I wrote too soon. There is already a short article on the Mulberry harbours. As well, it would seem almost all of the objections to this becoming a featured article have been resolved (see link, above.) As before, I don't disagree with your points; but I wonder if it would be best to leave the article mostly as-is for now, and try to work out an overall framework for gradual expansion? <a href="../../../m/a/d/User%7EMadmagic_062e.html" title="User:Madmagic">Madmagic</a> 08:16, Jun 17, 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Most of the thing you mention have their own article; the beaches do, many of the individual operations (<a href="../../../p/o/i/Pointe_du_Hoc_673b.html" title="Pointe du Hoc">Pointe du Hoc</a>, <a href="../../../p/e/g/Pegasus_Bridge_8bcd.html" title="Pegasus Bridge">Pegasus Bridge</a>). I think that's the right thing, though they should also be summarised in the main article, so the we get a good overall picture of the landings without having to jump around.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Proposal to rename/break-down</span></h3>
<p>Support: 3 Oppose: 2</p>
<p>I propose moving this to <a href="../../../i/n/v/Invasion_of_Normandy_25a4.html" title="Invasion of Normandy">Invasion of Normandy</a>, and making <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Normandy_a39c.html" title="Battle of Normandy">Battle of Normandy</a> a stub which we then expand to give an overview of the invasion and then describe the rest of the operations. Is it better to do this before or after the article is featured? <a href="../../../d/j/_/User%7EDJ_Clayworth_c4dc.html" title="User:DJ Clayworth">DJ Clayworth</a> 14:29, 17 Jun 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Support. Renaming the current article to Invasion and creating a stub for the Battle sounds good. I'd suggest doing this before the article is featured (assuming it passes by June 20th) to reduce any future confusion. <a href="../../../m/a/d/User%7EMadmagic_062e.html" title="User:Madmagic">Madmagic</a> 19:17, Jun 17, 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Neither - it's a bad idea. The current article does a very good job of describing both the battle and the campaign. <a href="../../../r/a/u/User%7ERaul654_54a3.html" title="User:Raul654">→Raul654</a> 20:17, Jun 17, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Uh... if it's a bad idea, what is bad about it? You've made a personal judgement on the quality of the article and your judgement does not take into account or respond directly to the specific points DJ raised, above. Please see <a href="../../../m/i/s/Misleading_vividness.html" title="Misleading vividness">Misleading vividness</a> and <a href="../../../h/a/s/Hasty_generalization.html" title="Hasty generalization">Hasty generalization</a> and especially, <a href="../../../a/p/p/Appeal_to_authority.html" title="Appeal to authority">Appeal to authority</a>. And please don't misunderstand my disagreement with your objection as a personal attack. I would very much welcome your opinions Raul654 -- but summary personal judgements don't make for better Wikipedia articles, no? Looking forward to hearing what you think, and cheers. <a href="../../../m/a/d/User%7EMadmagic_062e.html" title="User:Madmagic">Madmagic</a> 23:07, Jun 17, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree with Raul654, the article should stay. Even though it's weighted towards the invasion, it has the whole picture. If we moved it to <a href="../../../i/n/v/Invasion_of_Normandy_25a4.html" title="Invasion of Normandy">Invasion of Normandy</a> and took out what doesn't fit under that topic, it wouldn't look like a featured article (almost) anymore. I understand though that this topic has potential, and will continue to grow, but let's expand this article <i>in place</i> and split off when it grows too big. <a href="../../../s/v/e/User%7ESverdrup_2f1f.html" title="User:Sverdrup">✏ Sverdrup</a> 23:15, 17 Jun 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Support with suggestion/question. Isn't <b>Operation Overlord</b> the whole enchilda (deception, bombardment, landings/paradrops, initial battles)? If so, then we could have that as the (fairly brief) overview and expand in the various other pages. <a href="../../../o/b/e/User%7EOberiko_30df.html" title="User:Oberiko">Oberiko</a> 23:49, 17 Jun 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Ok, I've reviewed the article more carefully. It doesn't touch on the campaign as much as it should, however, I do not support moving large sections of text out of here - the article itself is already feature-quality. I would suggest instead *copying* the text from here to relavant subarticles (IE, operation Cobra, the individual beaches, et al). <a href="../../../r/a/u/User%7ERaul654_54a3.html" title="User:Raul654">→Raul654</a> 01:49, Jun 18, 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p><a name="Breakdown_proposal" id="Breakdown_proposal"></a></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline">Breakdown proposal</span></h3>
<p>It seems to me that we should break this article down into a more hierarchical structure.</p>
<p>The way I see it, it should go as follows: <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a> --&gt; <a href="../../../e/u/r/European_Theatre_of_World_War_II_1dd8.html" title="European Theatre of World War II">European Theatre</a> --&gt; <a href="../../../w/e/s/Western_Front_%28WWII%29_01dd.html" title="Western Front (WWII)">Western Front</a> --&gt; <a href="../../../w/e/s/Western_European_Campaign_%281944-1945%29_5e55.html" title="Western European Campaign (1944-1945)">Western European Campaign (1944-1945)</a> --&gt; <a href="../../../n/o/r/Normandy_Campaign_139d.html" title="Normandy Campaign">Normandy Campaign</a> --&gt; <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Overlord_76ce.html" title="Operation Overlord">Operation Overlord</a>, other events.</p>
<p>The article in its current state seems to encompass the entirety of the Normandy Campaign, and mentions details of the following Southern France Campaign.</p>
<p>Any thoughts? <a href="../../../o/b/e/User%7EOberiko_30df.html" title="User:Oberiko">Oberiko</a> 13:37, 14 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>In my mind this makes sense, but within that structure I'd say (as others have) that this article focuses too heavily on the first day of the campaign, the landings. I would suggest sumarizing the landings and linking the new page to <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Overlord_76ce.html" title="Operation Overlord">Operation Overlord</a>, which would contain much of the content currently in this article. <a href="../../../n/o/r/Normandy_Campaign_139d.html" title="Normandy Campaign">Normandy Campaign</a>, which should redirect to this page, would be expanded to include sumaries of the major battles fought over the summer of 1944, <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Epsom_e784.html" title="Operation Epsom">Operation_Epsom</a>, the taking of <a href="../../../c/a/e/Caen.html" title="Caen">Caen</a>, etc, ultimately concluding with the <a href="../../../f/a/l/Falaise%2C_Calvados_3f05.html" title="Falaise, Calvados">Falaise Gap</a>. I'm not sure how much my comment addresses what you want to do, but that's my two cents. <a href="../../../m/a/a/User%7EMaastrictian_523d.html" title="User:Maastrictian">Maastrictian</a> 15:39, 14 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I think we're mostly saying the same thing, make <b>Battle of Normandy</b> == <b>Normandy Campaign</b> and create a new page to focus on Overlord, which was just one part (though likely the largest one) of that particular campaign.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I'm not sure how much further we'd expand this page though, as I would have several other campaigns within the <b>Western European Campaign (1944-1945)</b>, such as the <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northern_France_Campaign_b81c.html" title="Northern France Campaign">Northern France Campaign</a>, <b>Southern France Campaign</b>, <b>Rhineland Campaign</b> and the <b>Central Europe Campaign</b>.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">German initiatives</span></h2>
<p><i>Unlike the Allied forces, the German army was not conditioned to take individual initiative, and thus many groups waited for orders, while being overrun by the allies.</i></p>
<p>Removed this for the time being, as it is misleading. German small unit tactics were based on a very high degree of indiviual initiative. It was the high command - in particular Hitler - who insisted on rigid adherance to orders. The above should go back in, but only when this issue is clarified.</p>
<dl>
<dd>As I understand it the thing that hampered the German units on the beaches was not waiting for orders, but the fact that they had no transport. The Panzer divisions on the other hand could not be released from their reserve positions without explit orders from Hitler. <a href="../../../d/j/_/User%7EDJ_Clayworth_c4dc.html" title="User:DJ Clayworth">DJ Clayworth</a> 20:59, 30 Sep 2003 (UTC)</dd>

They eventually made their own way back to their unit at Carentan where the Chaplain, Lt. Col. Father Francis Sampson, told Niland about the death of his three brothers. Two at Normandy and one in the Far East. Under the US War Department's Sole Survivor Policy, (brought about following the death of five Sullivan brothers serving on the same ship), Fr. Sampson arranged passage back to Britain and thereafter to his parents, Augusta and Michael Niland, in Tonawanda. There was no behind the lines Ranger rescue mission, ‘Ryan’ was not a simple private, his mother was not a widow nor is she believed to have received all three telegrams together, and, the bother believed killed in the Far East turned out to have been captured and later returned home. Fr. Francis Sampson wrote about Niland and the story of the 101st, in his 1958 book, ‘Look Out Below!’, (<a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 1877702005</a>).]</i></p>

<p>Well... the Global Television Network in Canada just ran a one-hour promotional program for <a href="http://www.dundurn.com/cgi-db2/db.cgi?db=bookdisplay2&amp;uid=&amp;ISBN=1-55002-492-2&amp;Title=&amp;Author=&amp;Subject=&amp;Subject_Code=&amp;ww=&amp;keyword=&amp;sb=---&amp;so=ascend&amp;view_records=View+Records" class="external text" title="http://www.dundurn.com/cgi-db2/db.cgi?db=bookdisplay2&amp;uid=&amp;ISBN=1-55002-492-2&amp;Title=&amp;Author=&amp;Subject=&amp;Subject_Code=&amp;ww=&amp;keyword=&amp;sb=---&amp;so=ascend&amp;view_records=View+Records" rel="nofollow">D-Day: Juno Beach: Canada's 24 Hours of Destiny</a> which consisted almost entirely of recent interviews with Canadian veterans of D-Day, most of whom were on Juno beach and were part of the advance inland throughout the day. Those veterans repeatedly stated the Canadian forces advanced further inland on June 6th than the British troops who landed at the beachheads on either side of them.</p>
<p>See also the following, from the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's page on <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/dday/minute.html" class="external text" title="http://www.cbc.ca/news/dday/minute.html" rel="nofollow">D-Day minute by minute</a>:</p>
<p>"1800 (hours) The North Shore Regiment capture St-Aubin. In the next few hours, the Canadians capture Courseulles and Bernieres. Later the Highland Regiment captures Colombiers-sur-seulles and the 1st Hussar reaches its objective 15 kilometres from the beach at the Caen-Bayeux Highway intersection. The Hussars was the only Allied unit to capture its planned final objective on D-Day."</p>
<p>Regarding Keegan, here's another quote, from <a href="http://www.members.shaw.ca/junobeach/index.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.members.shaw.ca/junobeach/index.htm" rel="nofollow">Juno Beach - The Canadians On D-Day</a>:</p>
<p>"John Keegan, eminent British historian who wrote <i>Six Armies in Normandy</i>, stated the following concerning the Canadian 3rd Division on D-Day: 'At the end of the day, its forward elements stood deeper into France than those of any other division. The opposition the Canadians faced was stronger than that of any other beach save Omaha. That was an accomplishment in which the whole nation could take considerable pride.'"</p>
<p>(I don't mean to stir up inter-national conflict over who-did-what-and-when, but the current Wikipedia Battle of Normandy entry is embarrassingly inaccurate about the contribution of the Canadians. 14,000 Canadian troops landed on June 6th and the first wave suffered a 50% casualty rate; 340 Canadians were killed and 574 wounded over the day. Can we all work together to make this article more accurate, before the 60th anniversary this June?) <a href="../../../m/a/d/User%7EMadmagic_062e.html" title="User:Madmagic">Madmagic</a> 19:45, Apr 25, 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>No objection to giving the Canadians their due (check my address). I'd have to cross-check two quotes - that Juno beach advanced the furthest into France, and that Gold beach got closest to their objectives.

<p>The article leaves much information and themes out. For example, the civilian casualties (French). The following article gives a taste: <a href="http://www.network54.com/Forum/thread?forumid=211833&amp;messageid=1086434296&amp;lp=1086747163" class="external free" title="http://www.network54.com/Forum/thread?forumid=211833&amp;messageid=1086434296&amp;lp=1086747163" rel="nofollow">http://www.network54.com/Forum/thread?forumid=211833&amp;messageid=1086434296&amp;lp=1086747163</a></p>
<p>For the numbers of troops I found this at <a href="http://www.ddaymuseum.co.uk/faq.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.ddaymuseum.co.uk/faq.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.ddaymuseum.co.uk/faq.htm</a>:</p>
<p>"On D-Day, the Allies landed around 156,000 troops in Normandy. The American forces landed numbered 73,000: 23,250 on Utah Beach, 43,250 on Omaha Beach, and 15,500 airborne troops. In the British and Canadian sector, 83,115 troops were landed (61,715 of them British): 24,970 on Gold Beach, 21,400 on Juno Beach, 28,845 on Sword Beach, and 7900 airborne troops." It seems the Americans had the most soldiers in action (British and Canadian listed as one number), which makes the comment on the John Wayne movie quite odd (Is that important?). Also from the last noted website:</p>
<p>"Total Allied casualties on D-Day are estimated at 10,000, including 2500 dead. British casualties on D-Day have been estimated at approximately 2700. The Canadians lost 946 casualties. The US forces lost 6603 men. Note that the casualty figures for smaller units do not always add up to equal these overall figures exactly, however (this simply reflects the problems of obtaining accurate casualty statistics)." Which puts the Americans as having the greatest losses (back to John Wayne again).</p>
<p>Again the d-day website: "Between 15,000 and 20,000 French civilians were killed, mainly as a result of Allied bombing. Thousands more fled their homes to escape the fighting." It would be interesting to compare all these numbers and statistics with the recent Iraq war.</p>
<p>Also, odd that Charles de Gaulle is not mentioned in the wikipedia article. Apparently the Allies didn't trust him, informing him of the invasion only days before it all occurred. See <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/war/wwtwo/allies_at_war_05.shtml" class="external free" title="http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/war/wwtwo/allies_at_war_05.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/war/wwtwo/allies_at_war_05.shtml</a></p>
<p>I have nothing as of yet to back this up, but it seems the Polish organized more soldiers for the invasion than the French could. Many "Free French" soldiers were Americans, including my uncle. Whyerd</p>

<dd>There is actually a mistake in the math of the numbers given above. The numbers for British and other troops correctly add up to 83,115, the number given (including Sword, Juno, Gold and airborne) but the number of American troops add up to 82,000 (Utah + Omaha +airborne), which is higher than the 73,000 quoted above (but still not as high as the non-American). I suspect the wrong figure is one of the US beach figures (possibly Omaha, which is very high) as the D-Day museum quotes 156,000 as the total number of troops involved, which is 83,000+73,000, meaning there were about 10,000 more non-US troops than US troops. <a href="../../../d/j/_/User%7EDJ_Clayworth_c4dc.html" title="User:DJ Clayworth">DJ Clayworth</a> 20:51, 17 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'd also be glad to see more in the article about the Polish contributions, more on the French civilian casualties, and an explanation of the reasons for the lack of a larger French presence in the D-Day landings. The byzantine politics surrounding de Gaulle, the Free French, Vichy, and the internal struggles of the French resistance might require more than a few articles of their own, however.&#160;:)</p>

<p>Not sure if this beliongs in this section: To state that the Battle of Normandy ended with the surrender of Paris is misleading and inacurate, since the French resistance toppled the regime on August 25 after a 6 day uprising and thus preventing an allied occupation of France.

<dd>The total casualty figures given above were about 10,000 on the Allied side. The 50% casualty rate was for the first wave, those who landed in the first hours and directly under enemy fire.

<dd>It would also be nice to also go further into civilian casualties.

<dd>In general, outright removal is not such a good idea, unless you have positive evidence that a claim is mistaken. People often summarize scholarly works without providing citations after every word or phrase, so in fact you may have removed correct material without realizing it.

<dd>I know nothing about any Vietnamese presence at D-Day. However I want to disagree with what you write here. The major problem that afflicts Wikipedia is not lack of information, but wrong information. In general I believe it's better to delete unexplained or suspect information unless it's backed up, or at least explained. It's far to easy to add totally fake info.

In a case like this, the right approach is to raise the question, but leave the article alone for the moment - it may be that the person who added it (do we even know who?) hasn't logged into WP since the question was raised, and thus hasn't had the chance to mention the source; if it's anything like some of the ill-informed deletions I've had to deal with in other articles, that person may come back with "geez, don't any of you know how to read books?"&#160;:-) Hairtrigger deleting is just a poor way to resolve problems. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStan_Shebs_9ea8.html" title="User:Stan Shebs">Stan</a> 00:17, 4 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Returning to specifics in the discussion, I made the deletion consciously and deliberately. I have seen a number of references to the (comparatively) poor troop quality of most of the defenders at D-Day, with two reasons repeatedly cited.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>One, German troops who were for various reasons unfit for duty on the Eastern front; and two, Soviet ex-POWs who were signed up from the POW camps with promises they wouldn't have fight Russians (because they feared re-capture and they feared the Russians.) Most of the latter -- again, from repeated citations -- were troops conscripted from the southern republics of the USSR. They were not well-trained or highly experienced Soviet troops from Russia or the Ukraine or the crack Siberian divisions who fought so well at Stalingrad, for example.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Until this issue was raised recently, I've never *once* heard mention of *any* Vietnamese being at Normandy. I looked at the phrasing and the source (213.254.171.194) carefully, then I removed the reference completely pending citation.

<dd>I've researched this a bit more, and I think the editor must have meant "Korean" (the story ultimately originating from the D-Day captures). Although there were Vietnamese fighting both Vichy and Japan in Indochina, any captured persons would have been considered criminals not POWs, and it's highly improbable that any of them would have been transported out of Indochina. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStan_Shebs_9ea8.html" title="User:Stan Shebs">Stan</a> 18:38, 4 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Personally, I'd welcome more explanation of the accounts of Korean (or Vietnamese) soldiers defending the beaches -- it sounds like a fascinating story and if true it's well worth an article, or at least a solid explanation within the Battle of Normandy. But again, I stand by my prior edit and by what I've read and heard repeatedly mentioned on TV/film documentaries: the majority of the non-German soldiers defending the Normandy beaches were former Soviet POWs largely recruited from the southern Republics. If anyone would care to dispute this point and provide online or other citations, please do!&#160;:) Cheers, <a href="../../../m/a/d/User%7EMadmagic_062e.html" title="User:Madmagic">Madmagic</a> 19:03, Nov 4, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Chapter 1 of Ambrose's book has the Korean story, conveniently reproduced by Amazon: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/068480137X/002-6388122-9904855?v=glance&amp;vi=reviews" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/068480137X/002-6388122-9904855?v=glance&amp;vi=reviews" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStan_Shebs_9ea8.html" title="User:Stan Shebs">Stan</a> 21:32, 4 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Reading the chapter cited above, I learn the "minority of Vietnamese" were actually four Koreans "... conscripted into the Japanese army in 1938 -- Korea was then a Japanese colony -- captured by the Red Army in the border battles with Japan in 1939, forced into the Red Army, captured by the Wehrmacht in December 1941 outside Moscow, forced into the German army, and sent to France." While this is a fascinating anecdote, I still don't see the point of mentioning this extremely minor Korean presence in the Battle of Normandy.</dd>

<dd>As Ambrose notes, "By the beginning of 1944, the Wehrmacht had 'volunteers' from France, Italy, Croatia, Hungary, Romania, Poland, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Asian Russia, North Africa, Russia, Ukraine, Ruthenia, the Muslim republics of the Soviet Union, as well as Volga-Tatars, Volga-Finns, Crimean Tatars, and even Indians." Perhaps this broad representation could be included in the article, if troops from those all countries/ regions were indeed among the defenders of D-Day? But mentioning four Koreans out of multiple divisions of defending troops seems to me silly, at best.

<dd>Unimportant? That's a different argument, but sure. I'll note that Ambrose didn't put this bit at the front of his book by accident; the anecdote connects firsthand experience to his main point, that some of the "German" forces were a rather motley crowd.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Planning to move Overlord</span></h2>
<p>Based on the discussions above, I think most of us have come to agree that the <b>Battle for Normandy</b> more or less corresponds to the <b>Normandy Campaign</b>. With that in mind, I'd like to relocate the bulk of <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Overlord_76ce.html" title="Operation Overlord">Operation Overlord</a> to its own page and have this one discuss the full campaign.</p>
<p>One thing I do need help with first though is the casualty figures and so forth. Are they currently for Overlord only? <a href="../../../o/b/e/User%7EOberiko_30df.html" title="User:Oberiko">Oberiko</a> 01:40, 16 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Golly, what WOULDN'T you move? I thought from the start that this was better titled "Normandy Invasion", which (though I haven't googled the respective terms) I think is the most common term for it. <a href="../../../s/f/a/User%7ESfahey_e531.html" title="User:Sfahey">Sfahey</a> 02:48, 18 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This article covers all Allied operations from invasion up to the breakout in Goodwood and Cobra. That's basically the Normandy Campaign, which (although not cover much here) is alot more then just the initial invasion.

<dd>I don't see a "consensus" above, and this article was chosen pretty much as it now stands as a featured article, which means that it passed a pretty tough jury. I think this is a cohesive article which would be weakened by breaking it up. I think historians furthermore would see no problem with this article including stuff about the breakout, but like me (and google, I just confirmed) would find "Normandy Invasion" a more appropriate title. IF anything along the lines you suggest needed to be changed, I would suggest abridging things here which seem "beyond" the invasion, and doing the separate article on the "Normandy Campaign".<a href="../../../s/f/a/User%7ESfahey_e531.html" title="User:Sfahey">Sfahey</a> 03:25, 19 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>So, what I'm getting is that you believe <b>Battle for Normandy</b> == <b>Operation Overlord</b> and&#160;!= <b>Normandy Campaign</b>? If that's the case, then we need to move all the non-Overlord related stuff out of here and create a campaign page. I'd like some more input before we do that though, as I was under the impression that those who participated in the earlier discussions believed it was the other way around. <a href="../../../o/b/e/User%7EOberiko_30df.html" title="User:Oberiko">Oberiko</a> 05:09, 19 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Well, you certainly have MY head spinning. To begin with, the art. is titled "Battle OF Normandy". It is an FA and I think a good one which should not be disturbed. Nothing would be lost if a separate article on "Normandy campaign" were done, incorporating parts of this article. Neither I, nor the FAC jurors, see any problem with post-invasion stuff being in the "invasion" article. I have no dog in this fight, but I expect if this article is highjacked, a huge edit war will ensue. <a href="../../../s/f/a/User%7ESfahey_e531.html" title="User:Sfahey">Sfahey</a> 03:06, 20 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi All. I agree that this is a long article and should be split up. It would make sense to have one article about the day of invasion and another about the rest of the the campaign. However if we do, "Operation Overlord" is the wrong title for the article about the day of invasion. Allow me to quote our own article <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Neptune_ac98.html" title="Operation Neptune">Operation Neptune</a>, which in turn quotes the D-Day museum.</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>"The armed forces use codenames to refer to the planning and execution of specific military operations. Operation Overlord was the codename for the Allied invasion of north-west Europe. The assault phase of Operation Overlord was known as Operation Neptune. (...) Operation Neptune began on D-Day (6 June 1944) and ended on 30 June 1944. By this time, the Allies had established a firm foothold in Normandy. Operation Overlord also began on D-Day, and continued until Allied forces crossed the River Seine on 19 August 1944."</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Virtually everything that is mentioned in this article happened before August 19th, so it's all part of Operation Overlord. Maybe <a href="../../../n/o/r/Normandy_invasion.html" title="Normandy invasion">Normandy invasion</a> could cover the day of invasion itself, with references or redirects from <a href="../../../d/_/d/D_Day_b33b.html" title="D Day">D Day</a>, <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Neptune_ac98.html" title="Operation Neptune">Operation Neptune</a> and others, and <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Overlord_76ce.html" title="Operation Overlord">Operation Overlord</a> still redirecting to this page.</p>
<p>Actually I guess we should have a section on the codenames in this article.</p>

<dd>I argued months ago that (at least in North America) "Normandy Invasion" is by far the most commonly used term for (most of) these events, but once something makes "featured article" it's difficult for a major change.

<p><i>[Previous explanations suggested that they were launched too far from shore - why then did the tanks at the other four beaches suffer no such problems? New research suggests that the Omaha tanks were aiming for a church steeple on the visible horizon behind the cliffs. In order to maintain their line of sight it is believed that the tanks had to turn progressively away from the shore to combat the wavefronts pushing them down the beach, putting their sides virtually parallel with the waves/beach. This meant that the protective canvas flotation devices were easily swamped by the waves. If they had kept going directly forward with the front of the tank headed straight for the beach, they may well have reached it, as did most of the tanks at other beaches; see bleow for url link to more info].</i></p>

<p>"a western invasion was not strictly required to defeat the German Reich". This whole paragraph has worried me for a while. While it may be technically correct, the Russians had been demanding a 'second front' for years, and presumably they still were, so I think some mention should be made of this. Does anyone have any information to the contrary. As it stands the passage seems to imply that the Normandy landings were made for the post-war benefit of the Western Allies, which seems unlikely if the Russians were still demanding a second front. <a href="../../../d/j/_/User%7EDJ_Clayworth_c4dc.html" title="User:DJ Clayworth">DJ Clayworth</a> 23:21, 20 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I believe most historians would agree with this paragraph. Russian forces probably would have overrun Berlin and eventually the rest of Europe without the Normandy invasion. Also, the Russians kinda got a "second front" in the Italian campaign. This paragraph contains a lot of hindsight, based on the cold war. Sure, the main goal of Normandy was to kick the Germans out of Europe. But allied commanders at the time were also very concerned about the Russians and their post-war intentions in Europe.<a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBeanbatch_3363.html" title="User:Beanbatch">Beanbatch</a> 18:03, 22 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>The Western Allies had promised Stalin a Western European Second Front in 1941. It was at the 43 Teheran conference that Stalin got his way. John Keegan states in a book I can't quite remember which, that Britain, in particular, wanted to avoid France, mostly due to memories of the 1WW. So, the Casablanca conference determined that Sicilly et al would come first. The Soviets, as far as I know, did not regard Italy as a "second front", unless you have sources to that say o'wise. The key phrase is "second front in Western Europe", maybe this needs an article in itself as it would explain the allies strategic thinking with regards to Operation Overlord, which may include speculation on it's effects on a future europe.80.4.124.205 14:46, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>That's probably mostly true. I think there were a lot of reasons for invading Sicily and Italy before France. France was much better defended and would have needed many more men to assault successfully, while the Americans in particular were still getting their men appropriately trained for amphibious assaults. Also there were already a lot of troops and landing craft in the Mediterranean doing nothing, thanks to victory in North Africa. From the British point of view an invasion of Italy might have pushed italy out of the war (it did) making passage of ships through the Mediterranean, and therefore communication with the Far East suddenly a whole lot easier. <a href="../../../d/j/_/User%7EDJ_Clayworth_c4dc.html" title="User:DJ Clayworth">DJ Clayworth</a> 16:46, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">A new coordination template</span></h2>
<p>Hi wikipedians!</p>
<p>Due to the LARGE number of articles, operations, places etc. of this LARGE invasion, I have created a new coordination template for "The Battle of Normandy"&#160;: <a href="../../../b/a/t/Template%7EBattle_of_Normandy_560c.html" title="Template:Battle of Normandy">Template:Battle of Normandy</a>. It is inspired by the rather small (but nice) <a href="../../../n/o/r/Template%7ENormandy_battle_beaches_eeb3.html" title="Template:Normandy battle beaches">Template:Normandy battle beaches</a>. The idea is that this template could replace the contents of all "See also"-sections on all pages concerning the Battle of Normandy, to make it easier for the user/researcher to navigate through the immense amount of information. It serves also as a brief description of the various codes (Chicago, Pluto, Cobra etc.) and who went on which beach etc etc.</p>
<p>The left column lists the operations. I thought it would be logical to have these in chronological order. The middle column lists the key locations (my suggestion is alphabetical order) and the right column lists "See also"-subjects (my suggestion is alphabetical order).</p>
<p>Now, I am far from an expert on the Battle of Normandy; I would therefore appreciate if you guys take a look on it, make additions/changes etc. For starters, I will only put the template (under the "See also":s on the main page and on the pages for the landing points (Utah, Omaha etc.), in case you guys think the template sucks. Of course I would appreciate any opinion on the template.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Unknown German Strength?</span></h2>
<p>Is the German strength so unknown that there should be a "?" in the summary box? Since it lists 200,000 Germans dead and 200,000 captured, shouldn't we at least list the strength as 400,000? Maybe like this: "&gt;400,000" or "~400,000". What do you think?

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Crossword scare</span></h2>
<p>I think it would be a good idea to have an article on the Daily Telegraph crossword scare. This is a primary reference <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2004/05/03/nxword03.xml&amp;sSheet=/news/2004/05/03/ixnewstop.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2004/05/03/nxword03.xml&amp;sSheet=/news/2004/05/03/ixnewstop.html" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> but I don't even know what we should call the article. <a href="../../../d/j/_/User%7EDJ_Clayworth_c4dc.html" title="User:DJ Clayworth">DJ Clayworth</a> 14:36, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>2nd of Feburary 2006</p>
<p>Hello David,</p>
<p>The message about the quote "Les carrotes sont cuites, les dés sont jetés" ("The carrots are cooked, the dice have been thrown") which was broadcast by the <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_a61d.html" title="BBC">BBC</a> on the 5th of June 1944 at 2100 hours. It was found in a "Hors-Série" of the 8-12 year-old magazine "Images Doc", the Hors-Série was printed in March 2004 by Bayard Jeunesse Presse in France; it falls under ISSN 0995-1121 (so you can verify). If you cannot get your hands on this, please tell me, and I will scan the specific page and I will send it</p>
<p>Thank-You</p>
<p>Booksworm</p>
<p>Dear David,</p>
<p>I acknowledge that my article error of <i>Mullberry</i> was signifucant and I will try my best to verify my data from now on, but for instance, I do not always make mistakes. Eg. If you verify on the major train events in the trains portal, under December 11 2005, of which my data there was correct.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Thanks for the information. I wasn't meaning to imply that you always make mistakes, but I was encouraging you to fact-check things very carefully. I would also encourage you to check and article carefully before adding information to it, in case contradictory information is already in the article. What I think would be appropriate here is to copy out the paragraph or so of the book that relates to this message. The problem here is that a different message indicating the imminent invasion is already recorded in the article. It may be of course that what is currently written there is wrong. it may also be (and this seems likely to me) that the BBC broadcast many messages that night, in which case we can't report them all. May I also say this this seems, without evidence, to be an unlikely message, because "les dés sont jetés" is such a well-known phrase associated with being committed to a risky endavour. It would be like using "we're going to invade now" as a codeword for an imminent invasion. <a href="../../../d/j/_/User%7EDJ_Clayworth_c4dc.html" title="User:DJ Clayworth">DJ Clayworth</a> 16:34, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Yes I have just re-read the article entirely, the BBC sent these two messages seperatley but, within the same hour, I am currently contacting Bayard Presse to ask them about this. --<a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBooksworm_6b44.html" title="User:Booksworm">Booksworm</a> 16:44, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I have hust verified with my history teacher about the phrase sent by the BBc and he says that the BBC would have sent the message, within another programme (eg. "Les carottes sont cuites" may have been broadcast in a cooking programme. And "Les dés sont jetés" may have been broadcast on a radio-documentery about Casinos or whatnot. I will have this clarified by the end of this month, in which I hope that Bayard Presse will respond. --<a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBooksworm_6b44.html" title="User:Booksworm">Booksworm</a> 09:20, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Could you ask your teacher if he is sure about that? My understanding was that such messages were usually broadcast by the BBC at specific times reserved for such messages. At the appropriate time the announcer would say something like "here are some messages for our friends in occupied Europe", and then read a number of phrases. I've certainly seen documentaries where this is the way it was done. Doing it any other way would probably result in some confusion. The other phrase which is mentioned in connection with telling the Resistance that the invasion was imminent was known by the Germans to be a message to the Resistance - they just didn't know what it meant. <a href="../../../d/j/_/User%7EDJ_Clayworth_c4dc.html" title="User:DJ Clayworth">DJ Clayworth</a> 16:42, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
