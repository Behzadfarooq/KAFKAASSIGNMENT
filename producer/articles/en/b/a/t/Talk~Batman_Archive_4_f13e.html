<h2><span class="mw-headline">Frank Foster ll</span></h2>
<p>Re-added the below sentence. It is a commonly-known story, authenticated by DC comics - not a crackpot theory as someone suggested - and it is an important part of the Batman creation story. It is written in a non-POV way. Feel free to suggest grammatical improvements, but do not delete without discussion here.</p>
<p>"Some believe that Batman first appeared in artist Frank Foster's 1932 drawings<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup>, though others argue it is a case of parallel evolution."</p>

<p>Rumors from 52 are that Batman isn't going to be Bruce Wayne (make of that what you will), but regardless, three people have 'been' Batman now: Bruce, Dick, Jean-Paul. Would be be amiss to make a Bruce Wayne page, dump most of the Persona stuff in there, and replace it with a list of 'Batmen' (which is not the right term I don't think...)? -- <a href="../../../i/p/s/User%7EIpstenu_5894.html" title="User:Ipstenu">Ipstenu</a> 15:00, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Unlike a character like Flash or Green Lantern, Batman is IMMEDIATELY associated with Bruce Wayne. I would bet that 95% of non-comics people who have heard of Flash or GL could not name their civilian IDs (any version) but virtually everyone who knows Batman... IE, almost everyone in a Western country... knows that he is Bruce Wayne. Aside from that... even if DC shifts around who Batman is, they'll shift back soon enough.

<dd>Very true! (says she who can only grock two GLS: Alan Scott and Hal Jordan, and everyone else is 'blah blah lantern cakes'). Something still feels ... off about the Batman page, though, and I think it's that it's very much BATMAN the icon/history/legend and not Batman/Bruce Wayne. Which is ... I dunno, a 'History of Batman' sort of thing? <i>Deleted out my own long suggestion thing, see my reply to my reply, doh!</i> -- <a href="../../../i/p/s/User%7EIpstenu_5894.html" title="User:Ipstenu">Ipstenu</a> 14:44, 8 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yet another attempt to remove politically incorrect material from the Batman article. I will point out that the excuse of length is more than feeble (the current Featured Article is 51K, 6 K longer than this version of Batman) and the fact that this was sprung on the article without explanation or discussion, in the face of exhaustive previous discussions and consensus here that the material was objective, appropriate, and could not be removed without breaking the rules is not in keeping with accepted practice. The so-called new article "Homosexual interpretations of Batman" has been listed for deletion, here: <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Homosexual_interpretations_of_Batman_2276.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Homosexual interpretations of Batman">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Homosexual interpretations of Batman</a> <a href="../../../h/a/i/User%7EHaiduc_5b55.html" title="User:Haiduc">Haiduc</a> 02:44, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hmm. As I recall, one section of the article mentions the <i>opinion</i> that Batman, his stories and lifestyle may have homosexual overtones, but I don't believe that quite fits your comment, "the whole articel pretends like Batman is gay". Unless you mean happy, which–––despite my personally doubts that the article pretends this, either–––is more subjective. Though, with things like the <i><a href="../../../i/n/f/Infinite_Crisis_5b73.html" title="Infinite Crisis">Infinite Crisis</a></i>——and the events which happened there-in)——and the return of <i><a href="../../../j/a/s/Jason_Todd_d1c6.html" title="Jason Todd">Jason Todd</a></i> as an anti-heroic murderer, I doubt bats is very happy these days.</p>
<p>As for the article being "garbage", you wouldn't just be saying that because it mentions homosexuality, would ya, cutey? <a href="../../../a/c/e/User%7EAce_Class_Shadow_f213.html" title="User:Ace Class Shadow">Ace Class Shadow</a> 03:05, 22 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I respect all your opinions and i can understand how to some people Batman &amp; Robin might seem gay, but in reality Batman and Robin are NOT! gay. A few reasons why: Bruce Wayne is potrayed as a wealthy playboy and ladies man. Bruce Wayne has also been shown to have only heterosexual relationships and only heterosexual flings in comic books and other Batman related media with female characters only like Catwoman, Talia, Vicki Vale ect. Dick Grayson has also been shown to have only heterosexual relationships and only heterosexual flings with female characters only.. like Starfire, Barbara Gordon, Cheyenne Freemont ect. The "gay accusation" goes way back to when the character of Dick Grayson was still a little kid. If Batman and Robin had a "homosexual relationship" or whatever other "closet innuendos" that are being thrown at them were true... then that would make Bruce Wayne (a grown man) just as evil as the animals he goes after. He would then be a pedophile because he would be having a homosexual reationship with a little kid. I say little kid because this gay accusation B.S. first started back in the 1950s when the Robin character was still a child in the Batman comics. Another thing in the Batman page under the "Seduction of the Innocent" section someone put a picture of Bruce and Dick in bed together. first off Bruce was Dick's legal guardian, in other words his "father" there is nothing gay about a child sleeping next to his father or father figure if there is not anything immoral going on between the two characters. Another thing Bruce and Dick are shown far away from each other in the bed picture which also shows that they dont sleep right next to each other. But i guess the opinion on that bed picture in the article and the "gay" accusation thing is different to each person.Dick Grayson</p>

<p>Hi, you know, I couldn't help noticing that the picture that appears next to 'Bruce Wayne (Batman) and Dick Grayson (Robin) in bed together', if you look closely, the artist has drawn two beds. (two headboards, a line to the left of batman suggesting the edge of the bed, and it wouldn't be too strange to suggest they have identical sheets.)

<dd>In other pictures of that bedroom, the beds are usually shown to be separated by a night stand, and sometimes the beds are farther apart than that. I would say that the angle of the picture makes judging distance difficult. Nonetheless, the distance is ambiguous, and the term "adjoining" comes across as being right next to each other, whereas "adjacent" allows the possibility a little more room. --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisGriswold_2071.html" title="User:ChrisGriswold">Chris Griswold</a> 21:52, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

FYI, I suggest leaving the title 'Homosexual Interperations' alone. We've bandied about it before, and it's pretty much the most neutral and yet accurate depiction of what that section is. Homosexual readings of Bats. Also, since Batman isn't gay, don't put LGBT on him. For Catwoman or Renne Montoya that's appropriate (we all know Holly and Renne are lesbians). Bats?

<dd>Oy, tell me we're not going to have a metaphysical argument over the validity of what is and is not real in a fictional world? How about this. Batman, as written, is not gay. Had the book <a href="../../../s/e/d/Seduction_of_the_Innocent_99e8.html" title="Seduction of the Innocent">Seduction of the Innocent</a> not been written, it'd probably be a moot point (I know more people who think Supes is gay, but that may be the Clark/Lex effect from Smallville). In DC Universe Canon, Bats is hetero. That's as factual as we can get. It is also fact that people have written about Batman's representation as fostering a homosexual lifestile, and promoting the gay agenda (we <i>have</i> an agenda?). So, Mr 'Keeping it Real', we aim for as much objectivity in the situation as is humanly possible.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Anti-hero</span></h2>
<p>While I personally don't believe Batman is comic book anti-hero (since he ins't like Punisher or any other protagonist who is given characteristics normally associated with villains without the audience's symphathy being lost, which is the very definition of an anti-hero), I agree with Ipstenu that if he has been historically referred to as such (however incorrectly I may believe that has been done), then that fact deserves a mention in this page. However, with anti-heroism being a characteristic of Batman that wouldn't be associated with him by people not familiar with comic books, or by readers with the opinion that we should concentrate on facts rather than historical interpretations, I'm moving the whole shebang about him being the first anti-hero or one of the first along with Namor over to the character history sub-section and taking it off the introductory paragraphs. I hope you agree with me about that being the best compromise. --<a href="../../../a/c/e/User%7EAce_ETP_a1a9.html" title="User:Ace ETP">Ace ETP</a> 00:38, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>If I may, I'd like you to consider that it was a different time AND how "dark" Batman currently is. Being a superhero, or just being a hero, believe it or not, is generally something left to "nice people". Would you call Batman nice? Friendly? Social? (ignoring the version Adam West was cast as). Bats is an Anti-Hero. I disagreed with it (for a moment) at first, but you have to open your mind a little. Anti-Heroes aren't always Noble criminals or "a person who'll kill for justice". Forget whatever stereotypes you don't think he fits. Better yet, read the Wikipedia article. He's a <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-hero.html#The_vigilante" title="Anti-hero">vigilante</a>. Now, I'll admit, the additional subtypes make it easy to get on the list, but lately, comic superheroes aren't always taking the law into their own hands. Superman's a great example. <a href="../../../t/i/m/Tim_Drake_eb7b.html" title="Tim Drake">Tim Drake</a>'s another. That dude seems really easy going for a guy that would, technically, have a long list of people to hate and/or go after for revenge. Anyway, I think the way it was mentioned in the intro was better or at least could co-exist with the "intrepretation" entry. We can debate it amongst ourselves. but doesn't neutrally and a need to inform the reader dicate that mention it sooner rather than later? Besides, this isn't as hard to determination as sexuality. You watch (or read) a guy for...let's say ten years, I think you'd be able to tell what kind of person he was, in terms of what archetype he fit. I'd like to think the people that dubbed Bats an anti-hero knew him as well as you or me. So...uh...respond when you can. I'll try to resist the urge to change it back without hear you guys out more. <a href="../../../a/c/e/User%7EAce_Class_Shadow_f213.html" title="User:Ace Class Shadow">ACS (Wikipedian)</a> 20:46, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>My reason for stating why Batman being an anti-hero is more of an historical interpretation or opinion than a fact is simple. Bear with me for a moment. After that jerk Frederick Werthram started bitching, Batman started sucking. All the greatness of the best 1940's comic book was sucked away in favor of around 15 years of friggin' Bat-Mite and Ace the Bat-Hound. Luckily, all that crap was discarded in 1964 by Julius Schwartz so Batman could go back to his darker roots. Then came Adam West (aka Satan, the Prince of All Evil), and the comic books started to emulate the TV Series. When that ended, it was in the hands of writers like Dennis O'Neil to bring the real Batman back for a second time. In all three of those three great, dark periods (pre-Werthram, post-1964, post-Adam West), Batman was never, not once, portrayed as an anti-hero. Sure, he was neither very friendly, nice nor social in his Batman persona, but he was looking to strike fear into the hearts of criminals so no eight-year-old boy would ever have his parents gunned down in front of him ever again (he was even portrayed as being able to smile in his daily life as Bruce Wayne without pretending, even if the days of going on picnics with Superman in World's Finest Comics were gone so we could have them fighting to death manipulated by Terra-Man). Batman was looking for justice. Not once did he look for vengeance, as you say, ACS. He never even physically harmed any of the various criminals once thought to be his parents' murdereder (you may insist on killing not being a necessary characteristic for making someone an anti-hero, but causing some sort of lasting physical impediment to the people who piss him off the most certainly almost always is. Batman, unlike the Punisher - who I hate and agree is the most stereotypical example of comic book anti-hero - would rather beat up the drug dealers who make his town a bad place than the person who made his life a living hell). You also mentioned hate. I don't believe Batman really hates anyone but himself for failing to be better (for example: check out the moment in Infinite Crisis #3 were he goes: "God, I wish...I wish I could just start over). Here's something more personal: I've always interpreted Batman's conflicts with people like Jason Todd and Hush being based on the fact that while Batman blames himself for everything that has happened to the people he loves, Jason Todd and Hush feel he should get his head out of his ass and start blaming (and/or killing) people like the Joker or Zucco. Batman didn't become a brooding jerk until the late 1980's. And even then he wasn't an anti-hero. One could argue that the most famous Batman story ever is "The Dark Knight Returns", in which he is portrayed as mostly anti-heroic, but not only is the story out-of-continuity (making my point about Batman's anti-heroism being more of a historical interpretation than fact more valid), but the guy who wrote it was scripting Batman's Modern Age origin at the same time, with an entirely different feel. Granted, Frank Miller didn't portray the Year One Batman as a happy-go-lucky guy. But he portrayed him as a practical man, able to relax when he felt his job was being done right, even if he felt a little uneasy at first. A practical man who was able to this job mostly well despite willingly carrying the burden of things that weren't his fault (this interpreation continued for years with arcs like Death In The Family, The Killing Joke, KnightSaga, Legacy, Cataclysm, No Man's Land, War Games, Hush, Identity Crisis, etc.). You also mentioned working outside the law as an anti-heroic quality...how many heroes are actually sanctioned by a legitimate body? Let's take a Modern Age Batman writer that I don't like and I still will find a perfect example of doing that without anti-heroic overtones: Chuck Dixon. Specifically, Chuck Dixon's Legacy arc. Does Batman using brutal force against Bane without having a warrant make him an anti-hero? No. Bane would have killed Batman and helped Ra's Al Ghul spread an epidemic. Batman was being a hero, pure and simple. With this happening in arcs where Batman's detective abilities don't influence the storyline a lot, it seems that we can assert that NOT being an anti-hero is more Batman-like than being a detective. And when he's working outside the law AND as a detective, he does it in such a helpful manner no one dares no help him (check out the recent Face The Face story arc), or just end up being sorry for not having been on his side ("Bruce Wayne: Murderer"). Even if there's some truth in what you say, ACS, as a complex lead character, Batman needs to have flaws for the story to be entertaining, but never does he sink into anti-heroism, because the flaws the audience notices never make them doubt his heroic qualities and put their sympathy for him as a protagonist on hold for a second; rather, they just gain more uninterrupted sympathy for the hero that is Batman. We just keep filling more sorry for the guy. Put it in whatever section about character interpretation or evolution you like, but the whole thing about Batman being an anti-hero certainly doesn't belong in an introductory paragraph about him. --<a href="../../../a/c/e/User%7EAce_ETP_a1a9.html" title="User:Ace ETP">Ace ETP</a> 23:21, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>People handling the anti-hero article are never going to agree with us.

<li>ACS, you sensed bias because I didn't struggle against my bias influencing me, because I wanted to give you my opinion on the matter, something which I can't do without a little bias. But as I've said before, opinions are not facts. That's why even though I'll defend what I said earlier to the death, it would uncyclopedic to say "Batman is not a criminal because of beating up Bane without a warrant. He did it to save people. He is a hero." in the opening paragraph, the same way it would be uncyclopedic to say "Batman is anti-hero" in the same place. However, both would be acceptable when put in the appropiate context and when making it clear that they are opinions. That's why I think the whole stuff about anti-heroes fits better in the character history section (although, if you'd like it for it to be more notable, I think it would be okay to put in whatever place you consider appropiate, except of course, the introduction). If anyone is still on the fence about Batman being an anti-hero or not, I'll insist: consider Frank Miller: He was told to write two Batman stories at the same time, one non-canon and one canon, Dark Knight Returns and Year One. And Batman was an anti-hero in the former and a practical rennaissance man in the latter. As for the people handling the anti-hero article, let them come. A good debate is never boring. --<a href="../../../a/c/e/User%7EAce_ETP_a1a9.html" title="User:Ace ETP">Ace ETP</a> 20:55, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">What is his superpower?</span></h2>
<p>What is Batman's superpower? As far as I can tell, the closest he has is exorbitant wealth, which hardly qualifies one as a superhero. He fights crime, he wears an elaborate costume, and he makes use of gadgets, but does not have what I can see as superhuman abilities, so how is he a superhero? Isn't he just a hero?</p>

<p>in the article we can read: "* Bruce Wayne briefly went by the name "Todd Gelineau" in an issue in the 70's.

<dd>So was the Jingle Bells parody.
