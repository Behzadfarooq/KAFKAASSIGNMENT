<p>Once the Eighth Army had crossed the 38th Parallel and was driving on Pyongyang General MacArthur was determined to cut off the fleeing North Korean armies before they reached the Yalu River and sanctuary. Even while Pyongyang was being invested he inserted <a href="../../../1/8/7/187th_Infantry_Regiment_5bde.html" title="187th Infantry Regiment">187 Airborne Regimental Combat Team</a> (187 RCT) by parachute at the two critical junction points 35 miles north of the city at Sukchon. Headquarters 187 RCT and the 1st and 3rd Battalions (1/187 RCT &amp; 3/187 RCT) jumped into two drop zones at Sukchon. Both sites dominated the road and rail approaches to the Chongchon River which was 30 miles further north.<sup id="_ref-Apple_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Apple" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p><a name="The_Airborne_Attack" id="The_Airborne_Attack"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Pakchon_b828.html" title="Edit section: The Airborne Attack">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Airborne Attack</span></h2>
<p>Headquarters 187 RCT, 1/187 RCT and 3/187 RCT landed about 1400 hours 20 October 1950 at Drop Zone WILLIAM, south east of Sukchon. 1/187 RCT quickly secured Sukchon and established a road block north of the town. 3/187 RCT established a defensive position astride the road and the railway about two miles south of the town. At 1420 hours, 2/187 RCT landed near Sunchon, 17 miles to the east and linked up successfully with 6 ROK Division. The 187 RCT had come to fight; the first air drop brought 6 X 105 mm howitzers and 1125 rounds of ammunition which was reinforced next day by a further 12 X 105 mm howitzers and 4 X 90 mm anti-aircraft guns. Nearly 600 tons of ammunition and other supplies were delivered during the operation.<sup id="_ref-Apple_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Apple" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>At this time the bulk of the North Koreans had crossed or were in the act of crossing the Chongchon and so evaded the noose.<sup id="_ref-Apple_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Apple" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>However, the 239 North Korean Regiment (239 NK), the last formation out of Pyongyang, had taken up a rear guard position on the best defensive ground between Pyongyang and the Chongchon River. The 2500 strong Regiment was astride the road and the railway just north of Yongyu and Op'a-ri. They deployed a battalion in each locality which were three miles apart.<sup id="_ref-Apple_3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Apple" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>At 0900 hours, 21 October, 1950, 3/187 RCT started two combat teams south, 1 Company towards Op'a-ri along the railway and K Company along the road towards Yongyu. At 1300 hours 1 Company reached Op'a-ri where it was heavily attacked by an estimated enemy battalion supported by 120 mm mortars and 40 mm guns. In a battle lasting two and a half hours, two Platoons of 1 Company were overrun and the company withdrew west with 90 men missing. The enemy did not follow up and withdrew to defensive positions on the high ground near Op'a-ri. K Company also encountered an estimated enemy battalion just north of Yongyu which, after a sharp contact, withdrew south and east of the town. K Company continued on to Hill 163 just north of the town and into the town itself.<sup id="_ref-Apple_4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Apple" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>With the United Nations (UN) forces driving into Pyongyang, the two attacks on 239 NK from the north put them in a dangerously exposed position. The North Korean reaction was fierce. At midnight they launched the first of three attacks which forced K Company to withdraw from Hill 163 and the town. At 0400 hours and again at 0545 hours, 22 October, 1950, they launched further strong attacks on the Battalion Command Post 3/187 Regimental Combat Team (RCT) and L Company, both located one mile north of Hill 163. Despite suffering heavy losses in those attacks, at 0600 hours 239 NK launched 300 men against L Company and 450 men against Headquarters Company. By daylight 22 October 1950, 3/187 RCT was only just holding and the seriously depleted 239 NK must have been close to exhaustion.<sup id="_ref-Apple_5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Apple" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Pakchon_b828.html" title="Edit section: 27 British Commonwealth Brigade">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">27 British Commonwealth Brigade</span></h2>
<p>At noon, 21 October, 1950, 24 United States Division, with the <a href="../../../2/7/t/27th_British_Commonwealth_Brigade_11fe.html" title="27th British Commonwealth Brigade">27th British Commonwealth Brigade</a> leading, crossed the Taedong River at Pyongyang and headed north. The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders were in the van and by nightfall the Brigade halted on the outskirts of Yongyu, 21 miles north of Pyongyang. A patrol from the Argyll's entered the town and made contact with elements of 3/187 Regimental Combat Team.<sup id="_ref-Apple_6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Apple" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>239 North Koreans' midnight attack on Yongyu came from the general direction of the road running south-west of the town. The Argyll's met the fringe of the attack and beat it off. The attack on 3/187 RCT was stronger and the enemy succeeded in entering the town before breaking off and moving away at 0300 hours.<sup id="_ref-Apple_7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Apple" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Next day the Australians of 3rd Battalion <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Australian_Regiment_10e8.html" title="Royal Australian Regiment">Royal Australian Regiment</a> were to take the lead in the advance, C Company was to be the leading company. The orders given in the early evening stressed the urgency to link up with the US Airborne. The company was not to be distracted at Yongyu, they were to press as quickly as possible as the Argylls continued to clear the town. The noises of the Airborne battles to the north were now very close and could be heard clearly throughout the night. There was no doubting the morrow would bring battle.<sup id="_ref-Apple_8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Apple" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>C Company RAR was the only company to remain largely intact as the battalion hastily absorbed reinforcements from the rest of the regiment and K Force and came to strength. The newest 3 RAR company had been formed in late 1949, early 1950 from the young men who joined the Regular Army after World War 11. By the standards of the other companies C Company was very young and unblooded. Much of the banter within the Battalion was directed at them. The K Force arrivals&#160;; older, confident and all with 2nd AIF experience , tended to make fun of the young regulars and their inexperience. Good humoured as it was, when it continued once the battalion commenced operations the young regulars became all the more determined to show their mettle. For C Company was a well trained sub unit and, unlike the other sub units still shaking down, was a cohesive team.<sup id="_ref-Apple_9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Apple" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Non-Commissioned Officers (NCO's) and senior soldiers were experienced, competent leaders who had raised and trained the Company. As an unexpected luxury, a handful of K Force reinforcements joined the C Company during the advance and took it over strength; a state never to be attained again by any unit in the campaign.<sup id="_ref-Apple_10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Apple" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Whereas the Platoon commanders were young and inexperienced, all from the 1948 graduating class from Royal Military College - Duntroon, the Company Commander, who arrived only weeks before the battalion sailed, was a vastly experienced battle leader.<sup id="_ref-Apple_11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Apple" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Captain Archer P. Denness had commanded a company at El Alamein, through the Islands and subsequently in the early days of the occupation of Japan. High principled, he neither smoked, drank or swore. "Arch" Denness was accustomed to command; woe betide anyone of his officers or NCO's who were in any way derelict in the exercise of their duties or any soldier who was profane within earshot. In the short time that he had been in command he had quickly established his stamp on the company&#160;; nobody was in any doubt that only the highest standards were expected by "Armour Piercing Archie" as the soldiers soon christened him. Above all, his insistence on timeliness had got through to every soldier and stood C Company in good stead through the long day of its baptism of fire.<sup id="_ref-Apple_12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Apple" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>At 0700 hours, 22 October, 1950, C Company drove off, 7 Platoon leading on tanks of D Company, US 89th Tank Battalion followed by the rest of the company in US troop carrying vehicles. Not quite knowing what to expect the company drove carefully through the Argyll's and the scattered firing into the eerily deserted town. Yongyu was quite large&#160;; leaving it and getting into open country again was like entering sunshine from darkness. Nobody spoke much in the ten minutes or so the trip took and all were relieved to be back in the country.<sup id="_ref-Apple_13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Apple" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Pakchon_b828.html" title="Edit section: The Apple Orchard">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Apple Orchard</span></h2>
<p>At 0900 hours (9 am) and a mile north of Yongyu, C Company came under fire from the apple orchard on the slopes of Hill 163 in YD 2354 (map grid location). Very quickly it became apparent that C Company had driven into the North Koreans who were in the process of forming up to attack the Americans. Enemy on the fringe of the battlefield flushed from camouflaged positions started to bob up every where. The Commanding Officer (CO) Lieutenant Colonel Green, traveling well forward as was his want, was more quickly to the scene and much more involved than he would have appreciated. His quick informal orders group proceeded with Regimental Policemen engaging interlopers within yards of the assembled group. He did not have a lot of information. There was no contact with the American Airborne who were believed to be located nearby. Without precise locations he was unable to use any indirect weapons in the battle and this concerned him throughout the engagement. In this confusing scene his ability showed. The urgent need for link up dictated his decision. He chose to try and bounce C Company, largely on their own.<sup id="_ref-Apple_14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Apple" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Orders concluded, the CO looked at the scene of battle all around him and rather wryly suggested to "Arch" Denness, he had better get on with it quickly.<sup id="_ref-Apple_15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Apple" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>The scene was made for Arch Denness and C Company were more than able to match his mood. Quietly determined to be successful in their first battle, constrained by the underlying excitement, there was some nervous conversation as weapons, ammunition and equipment were checked and formations settled. At 0930 hours (9.30 am), 22 October, 1950, 8 Platoon (Lieutenant C.M. "Mousey" Townsend) and 7 Platoon (Lieutenant R.F. "Rob" Morison), attacked the high ground east of the road. 9 Platoon (Lieutenant D.M.

<p>The attacking platoons went in hard, uphill through the apple trees, and their dash was just too much for those in their path. Many of the enemy jumped out of their pits to engage the gallant young Australians and exposed themselves to the relentless surge of the attackers. Although considerably outnumbered, 7 and 8 Platoons pressed their attacks fiercely, impressing all those in a position to observe. The young soldiers were, if anything, over eager to get into their first fight, but the apple trees were in full leaf and visibility was a real problem. Control was difficult and the last thing wanted in the first engagement was a man shot by one of his mates. The NCO's and the senior soldiers were absolutely splendid and quickly got the neophytes through the momentary confusions which everyone experiences in their first battle. With so many enemy present there was a considerable threat of some remaining hidden and firing at the backs of the Australians as they passed. The platoons pushed on and in a stride were through to the vital ground. Even a bunker which threatened 8 Platoon provided only a momentary delay as the young men grenaded it as if on a training exercise and pressed forward.<sup id="_ref-Apple_17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Apple" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>C Company's sudden arrival, even though it must have been expected to some extent, and the speed with which the North Korean outposts were brushed aside, had completely surprised the enemy. They were caught with all their attention directed north to a final frenzied effort to break out past the American forces. The CO's decision to pass 3 RAR through Yongyu so quickly and bounce the enemy aside was bold and brilliant. Thereafter the enemy were incapable of presenting organised resistance to the vigorous thrust from the south. Nonetheless there were many determined individuals who opposed the Australians every step of the way. So much so by 1000 hours the CO was forced to commit D Company to clear the area to the west of the road.<sup id="_ref-Apple_18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Apple" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Within C Company, as soon as success had been assured, the energetic Denness ordered us (9 Platoon) to push forward along the road. 7 and 8 Platoons continued with their consolidation. From the high ground they were able to engage the enemy to the north and east throughout the morning.<sup id="_ref-Apple_19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Apple" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Shortly after, about 1000 hours, we came onto a cart and a badly wounded horse which effectively blocked the road. Under heavy fire, the road block was cleared and the platoon was able to move using the waist deep storm water drains on either side of the road for fire protection. The road led out of the heavily treed area and into an extensive open area, mostly paddy field, which proved to be the disputed area between the North Koreans and the Americans. It was in this area it seemed the North Koreans were forming up for the final attack against the Americans.<sup id="_ref-Apple_20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Apple" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>From then on 9 Platoon had to move forward under almost continuous fire and would have suffered heavy casualties but for the protection of the storm drains. Initially the platoon only attracted the attention of the enemy close to the road. Most of the enemy appeared to be focused north but their attention gradually shifted to the Australians.<sup id="_ref-Apple_21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Apple" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Further down the road the enemy started to engage from greater ranges, our platoon pressed on although unable to effectively suppress the enemy long range fire. Fortunately the road was built up and the we were able to dominate significant areas which enabled us to keep moving. At this point 7 Platoon were ordered back to the road down the ridge to the west to clean out pockets of enemy who were engaging us (9 Platoon) at long range and the tanks were sent forward to 9 Platoon. Denness's reaction was timely as 9 Platoon was deep into the enemy area.<sup id="_ref-Apple_22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Apple" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>It was a scene of continuous confusion. Many of the enemy clearly had enough. Any lull in the firing would bring more and more of them forward to surrender despite a hard core fighting on.The appearance of the tanks tilted the balance. They brought fire down on positions some distance from the road and slowly the enemy became aware of the futility of continuing. 9 Platoon was able to move and link up with the American Headquarters shortly after noon.<sup id="_ref-Apple_23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Apple" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>

<p>It was a delighted Arch Denness who reported to the Commander of the American troops C Company 3 RAR had arrived. He had every reason to be exhilarated. His company had met with every challenge and it was already clear that they had been involved in a significant victory. Later 3 RAR reported approximately 150 enemy had been killed, 239 wounded and 200 captured as a result of its action at a cost of seven wounded. The operations in Sukchon/Sunchon had achieved much more. The Americans (187 RCT) claimed, at a cost of 46 jump casualties and 65 battle casualties, it had captured 3818 North Korean prisoners, killed 805 enemy and wounded 681.<sup id="_ref-Apple_24" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Apple" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>It would be difficult to describe a more chaotic battlefield. Despite the many casualties the Americans and C Company 3 RAR had inflicted, who lay where they fell, there were still several hundreds of the enemy in and around the battlefield. North Korea paid a very heavy price in the battles north of Yongyu. There were, for example 69 enemy bodies counted in the storm water drains alone which 9 Platoon had moved. They had fallen in the overnight battles. The enemy dead lay much heavier in the open ground in front of the American Airborne positions.<sup id="_ref-Apple_25" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Apple" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>There followed a period where enemy prisoners were rounded up on that tragic battlefield and there was momentary contact between the Americans and C Company. Strangely, the two units kept well apart. The Americans, 3 Battalion 187 Regimental Combat Team had obviously suffered heavily and were overjoyed to be relieved but were suspicious of the Australians. Some of them took the Australians, because of their strange garb and heavy overcoats to be Russian which led to momentary difficulty. The C Company soldiers quietly sat down in small groups and ate their lunch, unmoved by all else that was going on around them.<sup id="_ref-Apple_26" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Apple" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>With link up complete, re-deployment for the continuation of the advance commenced. Within the Commonwealth Brigade, 1 Battalion Miiddlesex Regiment passed through and assumed the lead in the drive towards the Yalu River. The Americans reassembled and drove north to Sukchon to rejoin their regiment which returned to Pyongyang by the other route. On cue with the departure of the Americans, the press arrived and it was their sudden appearance to report the first battle of the Royal Australian Regiment which underscored the nature of the stunning success. All enjoyed the fuss the press made of us and the excitement of having our photographs taken.<sup id="_ref-Apple_27" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Apple" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>

<p>It was all brought to a sharp conclusion as the battalion re-deployed and 9 Platoon was directed to clear west of the road past where the contact had begun in the morning. This patrol took the Platoon right through the paddy fields which, though well clear, were still in full view of the road now being freely used. Many of the enemy had fled to the west and were hidden, principally in rice stooks, and 9 Platoon had to flush them out. Some wanted to fight it out and were dealt with, but the bag of prisoners increased. The scene of Australian soldiers in extended line pushing on through the open areas captured the imagination of observers on the road. The Brigade Commander was later quoted;<sup id="_ref-Apple_28" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Apple" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>"I saw a marvelous sight. An Australian Platoon lined up in a paddy field and walked through it as though they were driving snipe. The soldiers, when they saw a pile of straw, kicked it and out would bolt a North Korean. Up with a rifle, down with a North Korean, and the Australians thoroughly enjoyed it."</p>
<p>9 Platoon got back to the new company position just on dusk. It had been a long day.<sup id="_ref-Apple_29" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Apple" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
