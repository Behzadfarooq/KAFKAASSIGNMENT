<p>There is some truly horrible writing in the article. While I appreciate that someone sits down and writes what is no doubt comberehensive, it is also at times almost unreadable. Someone seems to have decided to compress it by removing all definite articles, all pronouns and most of the consonants in some words. I tried editing two paragraphs, but much work remains. As it stands, parts of this reads like a military report written by a shell-shocked, tired private with a head wound.</p>

<dl>
<dd>The text was written by a japanese dude and well he dosent know english all that well&#160;:D
<dl>
<dd>What puzzled me was the use of terms like "fgtr" and "lgt bmr" where just typing it out and making it much more readable would have been no more work. But ok. There is also a lot of duplication of information within the text. I guess we'll jhave to help this gentleman with his style, as he has worked so hard on the content.</dd>

<p>This article is really about the entire war and ought to be titled Soviet-Japanese Border War of 1939. Alrees</p>
<p>It appears that this content is highly repetitive considering the entire body is duplicated in the article on the town. I think this is the proper place for it.</p>
<p>Also the article here states that this was blitzkreig. This is incorrect, the tactics he employed were entirely "classic", using tanks in place of cavalry in a traditional multi-prong frontal assault and encirclement. I'll change that.</p>

<p>"...then crossed the river on August 20 to attack the elite Japanese with three infantry divisions (70,000 men in all), massed artillery, a tank brigade, and the best planes of the Red Air Force."</p>
<p>"Of the 30,000 troops on the Japanese side, 8440 were killed and 8766 wounded."</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>70,000 or 30,000? Which one? And if two surrounded division were "wiped" out I think the KIA would be higher than 8,440? And I believe two different authors did those becasue the use of commas in one number and the lack of use in another. --CorranH96</p>
<dl>
<dd>It's true that this article is the combination of work by two authors, but those figures were written by one, using the principle of using commas for figures of 10,000 or more, and not for fewer. Read the article as saying that the <i>three infantry divisions (70,000 men in all)</i> was the figure for Zhukov's attacking force, not the Japanese; this does contradict the other figure of 57,000 men being deployed on the Soviet side which comes from the US Army document cited in the external links, although the discrepancy could be accounted for by the difference between the theoretical strength of the Soviet formations and their actual strength. I personally wouldn't use "wiped" as a description, but with over 50% of their strength killed or wounded they <i>were</i> severely mauled. -- <a href="../../../a/r/w/User%7EArwel_Parry_70fd.html" title="User:Arwel Parry">Arwel</a> 11:15, 11 Jul 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>From Soviet "History of WWII 1939-1945" Vol.2. Japanese losses were 61,000 killed, wounded, prisoners. Soviet losses were 18,500 wounded and dead. Also, it may be wise to include the effect of signing USSR-Germany non-aggression pact on mainly political side of it and as a cause for a political crisis in japan. May I thank authors involved in writing this article. Really nothing to pick on besides minor additions&#160;:) [xiaoxiong]</p>
<dl>
<dd>From Kwantung army 23rd &amp; 7th Division participated in the battle. Their losses were immense quantity but 61,000 KIA is obviously overestimated. Official record is&#160;; <i>Participant from 6th Army 58925, KIA 7696, WIA 8647, MIA 1021, disease 2350</i>. Note that some Japanese sournces question these figures. How's about in Coox's?

<p>I believe the following statement "The Marco Polo Bridge Incident also was a direct result of Japan concentrating on expanding into China after their rebuff into Mongolia at Khalkin-Gol. " under the "Influence on World War II" section has a factual error: the Marco Polo Bridge Incident happened in 1937, two year before the Battle of Khalkhin Gol. --mememe</p>

<p>This arose from border problems involving Japan-Manchukuo and the Soviet Union-Outer Mongolia. In April 1939, the <a href="../../../k/w/a/Kwantung_Army_d2ec.html" title="Kwantung Army">Kwantung Army</a> laid down regulations to guide frontline units with frontier troubles. "The principles for the Settlement of Soviet-Manchurian Borders Dispute" stipulated:</p>
<ol>
<li>the basic policy is never to invade and never to be invaded.</li>
<li>if an enemy violates the frontiers, he must be wiped out at once.</li>
<li>where the borders are not precisely defined,the area defense commander will assume responsibility for demarcation and will so advise the front line units, in order to avoid disputes and to facilitate troops movements.</li>
<li>an intolerable dilema confronts border garrison units: they are considered cowardly if they are overly prudent in the actions, but will be called to task if they act too boldly or aggressively. In view of these apprehensions, it will hereafter be regarded as the responsiblity of higher headquarters to deal with the final consequences of situations which may arise from the positive actions of forward elements.</li>
</ol>
<p>In the Nomonhan region of west Manchuria, the Japanese and the Manchoukoans contend that the border line ran along the Halha River (known in Russian as Khalkhin-Gol), which flows into Lake Buir Nor. the Soviets and Outer Mongoliams insisted however,that the frontier lay about 30 Kilometers east of Nomonhan Town.</p>
<p>on May 12,1939,some 700 outer mongolians horsemen crossed the Halha River.the Kwantung Army considered this action how one violation of Manchuokouan Frontier and repelled these raiders in conformity with the current Border Defense Guide Regulations mentioned above.the Outer Mongolians,however,received reinforcements,re-crossed the river ,and attacked again.in the course of sucesive engagements,both sides gradually build up their forces-the Russians and Outer Mongolians Vs. Japanese and Manchuoukoans.by the middle of August,greatly reinforced Strength confronted each other.Kwantung Army forces were build around the Lieutenant General Michitaro Komatsubara 23d Division,with Hq in Hailar,Tsingan Province,over 100 miles from the site of the figthing, the Soviets had three infantry divisions and five mechanized brigades, (430 tanks and same number of armored cars) while the Outer Mongolian posseses two Cavalry Divisions and Japan poses only the 3th Tank Regiment,unit of Yasuoka s Detached Armored Forces and somes armored Car units.(Yasuoka s Units poses the new Medium Tank Type 97 "Chi-Ha" ,just at Nomonhan incident,joining at Ligth Tank Type 95 "Ha-Go",the standart tank in this times).</p>
<p>before the arrival of Kwantung Army reinforcements,the soviet Army Launchered an offensive on August 20, and inflicted severe losses to Japanese.the Russians employed encircling tactics and made skillful use of their superior artillery and armor.of the august 15,140 men in the Komatsubara Force,of which the 23 Division was core,11,124 were killed or wounded in action.during the period between july 1 and september 16 which cover most the figth at Nomonhan casualities totalled no less than 73%,as a percentage of the force engaged.most of these losses incurred during Soviet August Offensive.by way of com parison,the percentage of casualities suffered by the Japanese during the bloody figthing in major battles of Russo-Japanese war of 1904-1905 had approximated:</p>
<ul>
<li>in 5 days of figth at Liaoyang:17%</li>
<li>in 7 days of figth at Sha-ho:17%</li>
<li>in 13 days of figth at Mukden:28%</li>
</ul>
<p>still awaiting the arrival of reiforcements,the Kwantung Army girded for a counteroffensive,but on september 15 an armistice was arranged in Moscow,the troops stopped figthing next day.</p>
<p>among certain Japanese authorities,the most widespread opinion was that the nomonhan incident had been a maneouver instigated for Soviet Union in order to Restrain the Japanese Army from disposing of a "China Incident".after the negotiations of Nomonhan Armistice, the Newly appointed Commanding General Staff of Kwantung Army,General Yosihiro Umezu,took inmediatelly steps to prevent further border troubleshe pulled back to Japanese troops some what behind the frontiers where demarcation lines where not precise.a fundamental principle designed to prevent border incidents was General Umezu s order that,in the event of Soviet or Outer Mongolian penetration of at disputed area,only the Commander of Kwantug Army himself from Ryojun hq could to decide whether japanese migth counterattack. the new measures represented a fundamental revision of the old Border Defense Principles.bold and positive front-line attacks the enemy,which had been formerly stressed,were not to be sanctioned now. as a result,a more pacefull atmosphere thereafter prevailed in vici- nity of the frontiers.</p>
<p>The "Nomonhan Incident" gave the japanese Army an opportunity to realize the actual ability of Soviet Army. Seeings was Believing:</p>
<ol>
<li>The bulk of Soviet Ground forces-Artillery and Armor- were far superior to the Japanese Army in terms of firepower and Mechanized equipment.</li>
<li>The Japanese were exeedingly surprised to Soviet Capability of transporting and Storing war materiel at battlefront 600 Kilometers away from a railroad Terminal (Japanese previously during Changkufeng battle saw the same situation, but Russians used one Fortified sistem of Highways between hills)</li>
<li>Having rid itself of the inflexiblity which characterized Czarist forces (see some similar situation in first figths of Lake Khasan Battle and Changkufeng incidents), the Soviet Army had proved able to change tactics from battle to battle. at begining of incident,for example, most of the Soviet Tanks were ignited by Gasoline bottles hurled at them by Japanese troops. a month later,however the Russians were using Crude oil-fuel or covering the tank chassis with wire netting. other cases of Soviet field improvisation were numerous.</li>
<li>The Soviet Army was more tenacious than had been expected.</li>
</ol>
<p>After the end of the Nomonhan figthing, the Army High command set up a experts Commitee to investigate the whole incident. The commision was to evaluate the abilites of the Soviet Army, and reexamined the performances of Japanese Armaments and its operations against Russians( from this if obseved the deficience of low 57mm AT Cannon in Favour of Rapid Fire 47mm AT Cannon), where military equipment was concerned, japanese firepower proved far inferior.</p>
<p>Heated debates ensued about two basic alternatives: whether to effect a thoroughgoing reorganization, or whether to go only as far reinforcing current firepower materiel. The second alternative was selected. Lurking in the background of the controversy was the problem of abandoning the principle of hand-to-hand figthing (these principle are used with limited sucess during Lake Khasan first incursions in Soviet lands), tradition of the Japanese infantry. the higth Command did not awaken to remarkable progress of material potentials in modern warfare, but instead continued to esteem the superiority of spiritual figthing strength. this atitude could perhaps be traced to the fact that Japanese Army did not progress beyond comprehending firepower at levels of 1904-1905. it had never received a baptism of fire on the modern scale of World War I. now the second world war had just broken out, Japanese Military autorities admiring the brilliant sucess of German Army operations, began to cherish a desire to learn from german experiences rather tham from that of the Nomonhan Incident.this desire cristallized into the dispatch of the Yamashita Military Team to Germany.</p>
<p>The higth ranking officers of Army Staff of Kwantung Army Hq,were called to account for defeat of Nomonhan.in Tokio,Deputy Chief of general Staff Tetsuzo Nakajima and Chief of First Bureau Gun Hashimoto were ordered to retire from service.in Hsinking enforces retirements were imposed upon Commander of Kwantung Army in incidents days,Kenkichi Ueda,and your his Chief of Staff Renzuke Isogaya.despite the shake-up most of the staff officers in 1st section of Operations at Kwantung Army Hq officers,who were allegued to have been really responsible and to have exerted major influence during the Nomonhan incident-were transferred to sinecures. Moreover,the transferred officers afterwards obtained important posts withing Higth-Command unnoticed.Some of them,indeed ended up by occuping key positions within the Operational Bureau at Imperial Headquarters itself. in other terms the "Shake-up" was merely for sake of appareances,such were the workings of military administration.its generally acknowledged by those who held contemporaneous Higth Command post that officers responsible for the "Nomonhan Debacle" became strong advocate for launching the Pacific War(some of theirs pass to the band of "Strike South" Group of Japanese Navy).</p>

<p>Can anyone provide reference to the following claim?</p>
<p><i>After the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, new documents about the battle changed the numbers considerably. The actual number of losses in the battle was 23,926, of whom 6,831 killed, 1,143 reported missing and 15,952 wounded. While the Red Army did win the battle, it was not as one-sided a battle as previously believed.</i></p>

<dd>It needn't be said twice. Especially it needn't be said twice using the exact same sentences. If you must repeat the idea for inattentive readers, better to repeat it using different words.

<p>Gipornm, I see that you have reverted the changes to where it was originally - repeating the same two sentence at the end of the article. Looking at your past contributions and the message you left me in my talk page, I suspect that you may not be a native speaker of English. With that in mind; I have to point out: to repeat the exact same sentences twice in an article or essay is considered very bad style in English writing - even if the sentences are correct grammatically. It is something that is taught at the very basic level of English writing lessons. Redundancy is unnecessary. While I appreciate that in other languages, redundancy can be used to emphasize a point, its not needed in English as it is a very compact written language compared to other eastern scripts like Japanese or Chinese (that certain important points can be on different pages). Since the article is in the ENGLISH Wikipedia, we need to conform to a high standard of English writing.</p>
<p>If you do feel that the point bears repeating, I agree with <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJim.henderson_0161.html" title="User:Jim.henderson">Jim.henderson</a>, use different words to describe the idea. For a fluent or native speaker/reader of the English language, seeing redundant sentences in the article is very jarring. Its an obvious and very basic (low level) mistake in English writing. I will correct the problem of redundancy, if anyone needs to add to the article to emphasize the lessons learnt by the Japanese facing a reinvigorated Soviet Red Army, feel free to do so.</p>
<p>PS: While we're at it, the phrase "Seeing is believing" has pronoun issues. "Who" is doing the seeing? The reader?, the Japanese? Japanese armed forces? Japanese leaders? the soviets? Taking that out too. --<a href="../../../e/q/d/User%7EEqdoktor_83a7.html" title="User:Eqdoktor">Eqdoktor</a> 07:51, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The whole Wikipedia article needs to thoroughly cleaned up IMHO. Redundant sentences is the least of it's problems. I take it on faith that the facts presented are correct BUT the grammar, word structures and word choices themselves throughout the article is atrocious. It was obviously written by a non-native English speaker and there are far too many literal translations (from the Japanese? From the Russian?) that read very oddly. I guess thats a project for someone... --<a href="../../../e/q/d/User%7EEqdoktor_83a7.html" title="User:Eqdoktor">Eqdoktor</a> 08:25, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As it says at the top of the talk page, this article is rated start-class. That means, as a poor translation about an interesting topic, it still needs plenty of editing. No, in this context "Seeing is believing" does not need pronoun improvements. It is clear, and it is useful once, even if slightly trite. Not twice. After using it at the beginning of the section, one should either use a less idiomatic phrase at the end, or use a different aphoristic English idiom such as "Once bitten, twice shy." Besides, many other sections need more work than this one does. If you know more about English style than about the topic, it's a project for you.</dd>

<p>As a casual user, I would highly recommend making this article much shorter. Limit it to historical/political information leading up to and caused by the battle as well as a brief overview of the battle itself. Most users will be looking to place this battle in a historical context. While impressive in it's level of detail, the current style makes the article difficult to use for this purpose. Point those who have interest in more detail towards outside resources. Most readers will be casual IPs, just like me.</p>
<dl>
<dd>A great deal has been added to the original article, particularly in the detail of the battle, which has resulted in considerable duplication of information, e.g. linking to Gen Komatsubara's name three times in just a few paragraphs (and some direct contradictions, such as where the disputed frontier ran). While I take it on trust that the information provided is generally correct, the article needs a thorough copyedit for style, spelling, and wikilinking of dates. -- <a href="../../../a/r/w/User%7EArwel_Parry_70fd.html" title="User:Arwel Parry">Arwel</a> (<a href="../../../a/r/w/User_talk%7EArwel_Parry_e253.html" title="User talk:Arwel Parry">talk</a>) 14:18, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Many battle articles are much longer, including Austerlitz and Gettysburgh. Long can be good, if it is well organized, which this one is not. This is one of those wars which had only one interesting battle, and the original editorial scheme seems to have been to write separate articles on the war and the battle. Perhaps someone less competent in the subject matter, and more competent in editing, can make it neat by carrying out this project, moving the political and historical background to a new war article and leaving the actual combat in this one. Each smaller article then would be easier to straighten out.</dd>

<dd>Well, no, don't do that. There's no reason to make a separate article for the "war" and the "battle", because effectively there was no "war". There was some skirmishing and sparring, then a full-scale battle at Khalkin Gol, and that was it. I'll get around to checking this article out sometime for editing, but there really should be one article, about the battle at Khalkin Gol, in the World War II category. <a href="../../../v/i/d/User%7EVidor_d74d.html" title="User:Vidor">Vidor</a> 01:04, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

If something is "too long" then create a sub article and move it there, but to delete all the information is just pure and absolute destruction. This is a military article written about a military battle and that is why it is written in a military tone. If the problem is the tank list then move the tank list into a "tank list of tanks in the battle of khalkhin gol", but not just the list was removed tones and tones of information, good information, solid information, reliable information was removed. Other military campaigns spanning the same time frame have much longer articles. Just look at the invasion of Poland it is a little more then a month long campaign which is a bit shorter then this battle and yet the article there is much longer and has many times more sub articles.

<dd>Latebird understands what I'm getting at. Khalkin Gol was hugely important, and it deserves a good article. It doesn't deserve long, pointless lists of kinds of tanks and artillery. The article should be an account of what occurred, not a roll call of weapons. Handsthere should create a Wikipedia article on Japanese military weaponry during World War II if he feels the information is important. Maybe even break it down by which tanks were used at which times and in which theaters. But don't go listing lots of weapons. Should the article have a list of all types of firearms that Japanese officers and men carried? Further, besides being boring, the article is badly written; there are redundancies (check out the second redundant sentence saying "This battle is known as the Nomohan incident in Japan" in the body of the article) and plain bad English that sounds like it was written by a non-native speaker.</dd>

<dd>No one said it must stay exactly the same way as it is now, but deleting facts and removeing them forever just because someone finds them "boring" is wrong, re write the sections that are bad but do not destroy the information in them. It is as simple as that, if something is to long then make a sub artcile about it but do not delete it.Handsthere 00:26, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>What I have done is keept information in the article unlike you Vidor who just deletes. If the grammar is poor then fix it but do not delete the whole article. It is you have have made zero to make this article better I on the other hand have done a million by not deleteing it all. The only thing you have chosen to do is destroy, destroy and destroy. If you can not make the article better or if the only way you can make it better is by destroying it then go away. Handsthere 00:26, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You continue to say things that are not true. I have written quite a bit as well as deleting the excess and badly written material. You evidently are not paying any attention to what I am doing, but instead are repeatedly coming back to the article and wiping out any changes I make. Saying all I have done is "destroy, destroy, destroy" is, frankly, a lie. <a href="../../../v/i/d/User%7EVidor_d74d.html" title="User:Vidor">Vidor</a> 00:39, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>FINALLY DONE</b> with the editing. Maybe somebody with access to the Coox book, which I do not have at this time, can add more to the article or lessen the dependence on the Army paper. I sincerely hope Handsthere actually reads the article instead of continuing to revert it. <a href="../../../v/i/d/User%7EVidor_d74d.html" title="User:Vidor">Vidor</a> 02:08, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Regarding Handsthere's list of units engaged, I think I found the source it came from. <a href="http://rkkaww2.armchairgeneral.com/battles/khalkhin_gol39.htm" class="external text" title="http://rkkaww2.armchairgeneral.com/battles/khalkhin_gol39.htm" rel="nofollow">Here</a> is the home page, and <a href="http://rkkaww2.armchairgeneral.com/battles/khalkhin_gol/Khalkhin_cut1.pdf" class="external text" title="http://rkkaww2.armchairgeneral.com/battles/khalkhin_gol/Khalkhin_cut1.pdf" rel="nofollow">here</a> is a description of the battle which contains long lists of units engaged, very similar to the ones that were in the article. I don't have the academic expertise to judge this source's reliability, seeing as how it appears to be an amateur translation of a Russian paper (although the map section is excellent), but in any case I still don't think the lists of weapons and units add anything to the article. <a href="../../../v/i/d/User%7EVidor_d74d.html" title="User:Vidor">Vidor</a> 02:32, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That site looks like the private hobby of someone, despite the enormous amount of work they must have put into it. It's a nice link, but I don't think we should treat it as a reliable source. This is what the author has to say about it: <i>Some figures may vary, as I take them from different sources and unfortunately I can't pay time to analyze each one to make sure they are 100% correct. Except some cases I try to use more or less believable sources.</i> In other words, we have no idea where the information actually comes from or how reliable it is. --<a href="../../../l/a/t/User%7ELatebird_f02b.html" title="User:Latebird">Latebird</a> 08:26, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
