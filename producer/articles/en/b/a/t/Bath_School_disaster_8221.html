Bombing aftermath</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The <b>Bath School disaster</b> was a series of <a href="../../../b/o/m/Bomb.html" title="Bomb">bombings</a> in <a href="../../../b/a/t/Bath_Township%2C_Michigan_f71c.html" title="Bath Township, Michigan">Bath Township</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michigan.html" title="Michigan">Michigan</a>, <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">USA</a>, on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_18.html" title="May 18">May 18</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/2/1927.html" title="1927">1927</a>, which killed 45 people and injured 58. Most of the victims were children in second to sixth <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grade_level.html" title="Grade level">grades</a> attending the Bath Consolidated School. The bombings constituted the deadliest act of <a href="../../../m/a/s/Mass_murder.html" title="Mass murder">mass murder</a> in a school in U.S. history, claiming more than three times as many victims as the <a href="../../../c/o/l/Columbine_High_School_massacre_3e4b.html" title="Columbine High School massacre">Columbine High School massacre</a>.</p>
<p>The perpetrator was <a href="../../../s/c/h/School_board.html" title="School board">school board</a> member <b>Andrew Kehoe</b>, who was upset by a <a href="../../../p/r/o/Property_tax.html" title="Property tax">property tax</a> that had been levied to fund the construction of the school building. He blamed the additional tax for financial hardships which led to <a href="../../../f/o/r/Foreclosure.html" title="Foreclosure">foreclosure</a> proceedings against his farm. These events apparently provoked Kehoe to plan his attack.</p>
<p>On the morning of <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_18.html" title="May 18">May 18</a>, Kehoe first killed his wife and then set his farm buildings on fire. As fire fighters arrived at the farm, an explosion devastated the north wing of the school building, killing many of the people inside. Kehoe used a detonator to ignite <a href="../../../d/y/n/Dynamite.html" title="Dynamite">dynamite</a> and hundreds of <a href="../../../p/o/u/Pound_%28mass%29.html" title="Pound (mass)">pounds</a> of <a href="../../../p/y/r/Pyrotol.html" title="Pyrotol">pyrotol</a> which he had secretly planted inside the school over the course of many months. As rescuers started gathering at the school, Kehoe drove up, stopped, and detonated a bomb inside his <a href="../../../s/h/r/Shrapnel.html" title="Shrapnel">shrapnel</a>-filled vehicle, killing himself, the <a href="../../../s/u/p/Superintendent_%28education%29.html" title="Superintendent (education)">school superintendent</a>, and killing and injuring several others. During the rescue efforts, searchers discovered an additional 500 pounds (230 <a href="../../../k/i/l/Kilogram.html" title="Kilogram">kg</a>) of unexploded dynamite and pyrotol planted throughout the <a href="../../../b/a/s/Basement.html" title="Basement">basement</a> of the school's south wing.</p>

<p>Bath Township is a small community located ten miles northeast of <a href="../../../l/a/n/Lansing%2C_Michigan_86b2.html" title="Lansing, Michigan">Lansing, Michigan</a>, and contains the <a href="../../../u/n/i/Unincorporated_area.html" title="Unincorporated area">unincorporated</a> <a href="../../../v/i/l/Village.html" title="Village">village</a> of Bath. In the early 1920s, the area was primarily <a href="../../../a/g/r/Agriculture.html" title="Agriculture">agricultural</a>. In 1922, Bath voters voted to form a district for the purpose of funding and constructing a consolidated school. There were 236 students enrolled when the school opened, ranging from the first to twelfth grades.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_Ellsworth"><sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../b/a/t/Bath_School_disaster_8221.html#endnote_Ellsworth" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../b/a/t/Bath_School_disaster_8221.html#endnote_Ellsworth" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></sup></span></p>
<p>The early part of the 20th century saw the disappearance of many small <a href="../../../o/n/e/One-room_school.html" title="One-room school">one-room schools</a>, where different grades shared the same classroom and teacher. Educators of the era believed that children would receive a better and more <a href="../../../e/d/u/Education_reform.html" title="Education reform">complete education</a> if students could attend a single school at one location.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_Education"><sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../b/a/t/Bath_School_disaster_8221.html#endnote_Education" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../b/a/t/Bath_School_disaster_8221.html#endnote_Education" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></sup></span> The grades could be age-divided into classes, and the facilities could be of a higher quality. After years of debate, when Bath Township created the district, it raised property taxes to pay for the project. As a result, new taxes were imposed on landowners, including Andrew Kehoe.</p>

<p>Andrew Kehoe was born in <a href="../../../t/e/c/Tecumseh%2C_Michigan_65bd.html" title="Tecumseh, Michigan">Tecumseh, Michigan</a>, on <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_1.html" title="February 1">February 1</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/7/1872.html" title="1872">1872</a>, in a family of thirteen children. Kehoe's mother died when he was young, and his father remarried. Reportedly, Kehoe often fought with his stepmother. When Kehoe was fourteen, the family's stove exploded as she was attempting to light it. The <a href="../../../h/e/a/Heating_oil.html" title="Heating oil">oil</a> fueling the stove soaked her, and the flames set her on fire. Andrew watched his stepmother burn for a few minutes before dumping a bucket of water on her. She later died from the injuries. The stove malfunction was left unresolved, and Kehoe was not charged.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_Crime1"><sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../b/a/t/Bath_School_disaster_8221.html#endnote_Crime1" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../b/a/t/Bath_School_disaster_8221.html#endnote_Crime1" rel="nofollow">[3]</a></sup></span></p>

</div>
<p>Kehoe attended <a href="../../../t/e/c/Tecumseh_High_School_%28Michigan%29_9545.html" title="Tecumseh High School (Michigan)">Tecumseh High School</a> and Michigan State College (later <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michigan_State_University_3713.html" title="Michigan State University">Michigan State University</a>), where he met his wife, Ellen "Nellie" Price, daughter of a wealthy Lansing family. Married in 1912, they moved around until 1919, when the couple bought a 185-<a href="../../../a/c/r/Acre.html" title="Acre">acre</a> (75-<a href="../../../h/e/c/Hectare.html" title="Hectare">hectare</a>) farm outside the village of Bath from Nellie's aunt for <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_dollar_db5c.html" title="United States dollar">$</a>12,000, paying $6,000 in cash and taking out a $6,000 <a href="../../../m/o/r/Mortgage.html" title="Mortgage">mortgage</a>.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_Maydaya"><sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../b/a/t/Bath_School_disaster_8221.html#endnote_Maydaya" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../b/a/t/Bath_School_disaster_8221.html#endnote_Maydaya" rel="nofollow">[4]</a></sup></span> Kehoe was regarded by his neighbors as an intelligent man who grew impatient with those who disagreed with him. Neighbors recalled that Kehoe was always neat, dressed meticulously, and was known to change his shirt at midday or whenever it became even slightly dirty. Neighbors also recounted how Kehoe was cruel to his farm animals, having once beaten a horse to death.</p>
<p>Kehoe's neighbors were not impressed by the level of his farming ability. As neighbor M.J. "Monty" Ellsworth wrote, "He never farmed it as other farmers do and he tried to do everything with his tractor. He was in the height of his glory when fixing machinery or tinkering. He was always trying new methods in his work, for instance, hitching two mowers behind his tractor. This method at different times did not work and he would just leave the hay standing. He also put four sections of drag and two rollers at once behind his tractor. He spent so much time tinkering that he didn't prosper."<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_Ellsworth1"><sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../b/a/t/Bath_School_disaster_8221.html#endnote_Ellsworth1" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../b/a/t/Bath_School_disaster_8221.html#endnote_Ellsworth1" rel="nofollow">[5]</a></sup></span></p>
<p>With a reputation for <a href="../../../f/r/u/Frugality.html" title="Frugality">thriftiness</a>, Kehoe was elected <a href="../../../t/r/e/Treasurer.html" title="Treasurer">treasurer</a> of the Bath Consolidated School board in 1924. While on the board, Kehoe fought endlessly for lower taxes. He blamed the previous property tax levy for his family's poor financial condition, and repeatedly accused superintendent Emory Huyck of financial mismanagement. While on the school board, Kehoe was appointed the Bath Township <a href="../../../c/i/t/City_clerk.html" title="City clerk">Clerk</a> in 1925, but was unsuccessful at retaining this position in the <a href="../../../l/o/c/Local_election.html" title="Local election">election</a> later that year. During this time, Nellie Kehoe was chronically ill with <a href="../../../t/u/b/Tuberculosis.html" title="Tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a>, and her frequent hospital stays may have played a role in putting the family into debt. At the time of the bombing, Kehoe had ceased making mortgage and <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homeowner%27s_insurance.html" title="Homeowner's insurance">homeowner's insurance</a> payments, and the mortgage lender had begun <a href="../../../f/o/r/Foreclosure.html" title="Foreclosure">foreclosure</a> proceedings against the farm.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_Ellsworthz"><sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../b/a/t/Bath_School_disaster_8221.html#endnote_Ellsworthz" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../b/a/t/Bath_School_disaster_8221.html#endnote_Ellsworthz" rel="nofollow">[6]</a></sup></span></p>

Explosives recovered from under the school</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>There is no clear indication as to when Kehoe conceived and planned the steps leading to the ultimate events. A subsequent investigation concluded that, based upon the activity at the school and the purchases of explosives, his plan had probably been under way for at least a year.</p>
<p>In the winter of 1926, the board asked Kehoe to perform maintenance inside the school building. Regarded by most as a talented <a href="../../../h/a/n/Handyman.html" title="Handyman">handyman</a>, he was known to be familiar with electrical equipment. As a board member appointed to conduct repairs, he had free access to the building and his presence was never questioned.</p>
<p>Beginning in the summer of 1926, Kehoe purchased over a <a href="../../../t/o/n/Ton.html" title="Ton">ton</a> of <a href="../../../p/y/r/Pyrotol.html" title="Pyrotol">pyrotol</a>, an incendiary introduced in <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_I_9429.html" title="World War I">World War I</a>. Farmers during the era used the substance for excavation. In November 1926, Kehoe drove to <a href="../../../l/a/n/Lansing%2C_Michigan_86b2.html" title="Lansing, Michigan">Lansing</a> and purchased two boxes of <a href="../../../d/y/n/Dynamite.html" title="Dynamite">dynamite</a> at a <a href="../../../s/p/o/Sporting_goods.html" title="Sporting goods">sporting goods</a> store. Dynamite is also commonly used on farms, and Kehoe's purchase of small amounts of the substances at different stores and on different dates did not raise any suspicions. Neighbors reported hearing explosions set off on the farm, as well as recalling conversations where Kehoe explained he was using dynamite for tree stump removal.<br clear="all" /></p>

<p>There were a few warning signs prior to the events.

<p>Prior to <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_18.html" title="May 18">May 18</a>, Kehoe had loaded the back seat of his car with metal debris.

<p>At approximately 8:45 a.m., Kehoe detonated the firebombs. The neighbors noticed the fire, and volunteer <a href="../../../f/i/r/Fire_department.html" title="Fire department">fire departments</a> from all over the area began rushing to the scene. At 9:45 a.m. an explosion was heard from the school building. Rescuers heading to the scene of the Kehoe fire turned back and headed toward the school. Parents within the rural community also began rushing to the school.</p>
<p>First-grade teacher Bernice Sterling recounted the explosion to an <a href="../../../a/s/s/Associated_Press_9ff2.html" title="Associated Press">Associated Press</a> reporter as being like a terrible <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earthquake.html" title="Earthquake">earthquake</a>. "It seemed as though the floor went up several feet", she said. "After the first shock I thought for a moment I was blind. When it came the air seemed to be full of children and flying desks and books. Children were tossed high in the air; some were catapulted out of the building."<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_AP"><sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../b/a/t/Bath_School_disaster_8221.html#endnote_AP" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../b/a/t/Bath_School_disaster_8221.html#endnote_AP" rel="nofollow">[13]</a></sup></span></p>
<p>The north wing of the school had collapsed. Parts of the walls had crumbled, and the edge of the roof had fallen to the ground. Monty Ellsworth, a neighbor of the Kehoes recounted, "There was a pile of children of about five or six under the roof and some of them had arms sticking out, some had legs, and some just their heads sticking out. They were unrecognizable because they were covered with dust, plaster, and blood. There were not enough of us to move the roof." Ellsworth volunteered to drive back to his farm and obtain the heavy rope from his <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slaughterhouse.html" title="Slaughterhouse">slaughterhouse</a> needed to pull the structure off the children's bodies.</p>
<p>On the way back to his farm, Ellsworth reported seeing Kehoe in his car heading in the opposite direction toward the school. "He grinned and waved his hand; when he grinned, I could see both rows of his teeth," said Ellsworth.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_Ellsworth2"><sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../b/a/t/Bath_School_disaster_8221.html#endnote_Ellsworth2" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../b/a/t/Bath_School_disaster_8221.html#endnote_Ellsworth2" rel="nofollow">[14]</a></sup></span></p>
<p>The scene at the school building was chaotic. One witness, Robert Gates, recounted how "mother after mother came running into the school yard, and demanded information about her child and, on seeing the lifeless form lying on the lawn, broke into sobs. In no time more than 100 men were at work tearing away the debris of the school, and nearly as many women were frantically pawing over the timber and broken bricks for traces of their children."</p>

Kehoe's car after the explosion</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>About a half hour after the explosion, Kehoe drove up to the school and saw Superintendent Huyck. Kehoe summoned the superintendent over to his vehicle. According to one eyewitness, when Huyck drew close, Kehoe pulled out his rifle and fired into the back seat. Whether by gunshot or otherwise, the dynamite in the vehicle ignited and the resulting explosion killed Kehoe, the superintendent, Postmaster Glenn O. Smith, and Smith's father-in-law Nelson McFarren, a retired farmer.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_Mediadrome"><sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../b/a/t/Bath_School_disaster_8221.html#endnote_Mediadrome" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../b/a/t/Bath_School_disaster_8221.html#endnote_Mediadrome" rel="nofollow">[15]</a></sup></span> Cleo Claton, an eight-year-old second grader, had wandered out of the collapsed school building and was killed by the shrapnel from the exploding vehicle. Several others were injured as the shrapnel flew through the crowd.</p>
<p>After Kehoe's car exploded, Ellsworth recounted that "I saw one mother, Mrs. Eugene Hart, sitting on the bank a short distance from the school with a little dead girl on each side of her and holding a little boy, Percy, who died a short time after they got him to the hospital. This was about the time Kehoe blew his car up in the street, severely wounding Perry, the oldest child of Mr. and Mrs. Hart."</p>
<p>O.H. Buck, foreman of the road crew, recalled the scene after the final explosion: "I began to feel as though the world was coming to an end. I guess I was a bit hazy. Anyway, the next thing I remember I was out on the street. One of our men was binding up the wounds of Glenn Smith, the postmaster. His leg had been blown off. I went back to the building and helped with the rescue work until we were ordered to stop while a search was made for dynamite."<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_NYT3"><sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../b/a/t/Bath_School_disaster_8221.html#endnote_NYT3" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../b/a/t/Bath_School_disaster_8221.html#endnote_NYT3" rel="nofollow">[16]</a></sup></span></p>

The location of Nellie Kehoe's body.</div>

<p>Hundreds of people worked in the wreckage all day in an effort to find and rescue the children pinned underneath. Area contractors had sent all their men to assist, and many ordinary people came to the scene in response to the pleas for help. Eventually, 34 firefighters and the Chief of the Lansing Fire Department arrived on the scene, as did several Michigan State Police officers, who managed traffic to and from the scene. The injured and dying were transported to Sparrow Hospital and St. Lawrence Hospital in Lansing. The construction of the latter facility had been financed in large part by Lawrence Price, Nellie Kehoe's uncle and formerly an executive in charge of <a href="../../../o/l/d/Oldsmobile.html" title="Oldsmobile">Oldsmobile</a>'s <a href="../../../l/a/n/Lansing_Car_Assembly_2cdf.html" title="Lansing Car Assembly">Lansing Car Assembly</a>.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_Parker"><sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../b/a/t/Bath_School_disaster_8221.html#endnote_Parker" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../b/a/t/Bath_School_disaster_8221.html#endnote_Parker" rel="nofollow">[17]</a></sup></span></p>

<p>The bombing had destroyed the north wing of the school. During the search rescuers found an additional 500 pounds (230 kg) of dynamite Kehoe had placed in the south wing, which had failed to detonate. The search was halted to allow the <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michigan_State_Police_e1aa.html" title="Michigan State Police">Michigan State Police</a> to disarm the devices.

<p>In the south wing, the State Police found unexploded materials along with an <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alarm_clock.html" title="Alarm clock">alarm clock</a> timed to go off at 9:45 a.m., the same time as the explosion went off in the north wing. The reason why these explosives failed to detonate could never be conclusively determined.

<p>The <a href="../../../c/o/r/Coroner.html" title="Coroner">coroner</a> arrived at the scene on the day of disaster and swore in six community leaders to serve as an investigative jury. A <a href="../../../i/n/q/Inquest.html" title="Inquest">coroner's inquest</a> into the matter was held the following week. Dozens of Bath citizens and law enforcement personnel testified before the jury, and the Clinton County <a href="../../../p/r/o/Prosecutor.html" title="Prosecutor">Prosecutor</a> conducted the examination. Although there was never any doubt that Kehoe was the perpetrator, the jury was asked to determine if the school board or its employees were guilty of <a href="../../../c/r/i/Criminal_negligence.html" title="Criminal negligence">criminal negligence</a>.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_Maydayac"><sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../b/a/t/Bath_School_disaster_8221.html#endnote_Maydayac" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../b/a/t/Bath_School_disaster_8221.html#endnote_Maydayac" rel="nofollow">[26]</a></sup></span></p>
<p>Kehoe's neighbor Sidney J. Howell testified that after the fire began, Kehoe warned him and three boys to leave the farm, telling them, "Boys, you're my friends. You'd better get out of here and go to the school house." Three telephone linemen working near Bath testified that after first going to the farm and then to the school, Kehoe passed them en route, and they saw him reach the school right before them. Kehoe's car swerved to the right and stopped in front of the building. In the next instant, according to the linemen, the car blew up, and one of them was struck by shrapnel. This testimony contradicted statements from others that Kehoe paused after stopping and called Superintendent Huyck over before blowing up the vehicle.</p>
<p>After more than a week of testimony, the jury exonerated the school board and its employees. In its verdict the jury concluded that Kehoe "conducted himself <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sanity.html" title="Sanity">sanely</a> and so concealed his operations that there was no cause to suspicion any of his actions; and we further find that the school board, and Frank Smith, <a href="../../../j/a/n/Janitor.html" title="Janitor">janitor</a> of the school building, were not negligent in and about their duties, and were not guilty of any negligence in not discovering Kehoe's plan."</p>
<p>The inquest determined that Kehoe murdered Superintendent Emory Huyck on the morning of <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_18.html" title="May 18">May 18</a>. It was also the jury's verdict that the school was blown up as part of a plan and that Kehoe alone, without the aid of <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conspiracy_%28crime%29.html" title="Conspiracy (crime)">conspirators</a>, murdered 43 people in total, including his wife Nellie. <a href="../../../s/u/i/Suicide.html" title="Suicide">Suicide</a> was determined to be the manner of Andrew Kehoe's death.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_CCRN4"><sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../b/a/t/Bath_School_disaster_8221.html#endnote_CCRN4" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../b/a/t/Bath_School_disaster_8221.html#endnote_CCRN4" rel="nofollow">[27]</a></sup></span></p>
<p>Kehoe's body was eventually claimed by his sister. Without ceremony, he was buried in an unmarked grave in an initially unnamed cemetery. Later, it was revealed that Kehoe was buried in the paupers' section of Mt. Rest Cemetery, <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Johns%2C_Michigan_7b7a.html" title="St. Johns, Michigan">St. Johns</a>, in Clinton County.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_Daggy"><sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../b/a/t/Bath_School_disaster_8221.html#endnote_Daggy" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../b/a/t/Bath_School_disaster_8221.html#endnote_Daggy" rel="nofollow">[28]</a></sup></span> Nellie Kehoe was buried in Mount Hope Cemetery in Lansing by her family under her <a href="../../../m/a/i/Maiden_name.html" title="Maiden name">maiden name</a> of Price.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_Daggy2"><sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../b/a/t/Bath_School_disaster_8221.html#endnote_Daggy2" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../b/a/t/Bath_School_disaster_8221.html#endnote_Daggy2" rel="nofollow">[29]</a></sup></span></p>

<p>Governor Fred Green created the Bath Relief Fund with the money supplied by donors and the state and local governments. Numerous people from around the country donated to the fund. The school board began a separate fund for the repair of the school building.</p>

Most of the students returned. The board appointed O. M. Brant of <a href="../../../l/u/t/Luther%2C_Michigan_30ad.html" title="Luther, Michigan">Luther, Michigan</a>, to succeed Huyck as superintendent. Lansing architect Warren Holmes donated construction plans, and the school board approved the contracts for the new building on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_14.html" title="September 14">September 14</a>.

<p>In 1928, artist <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carlton_W._Angell_bd85.html" title="Carlton W. Angell">Carlton W.

The statue is presently in the Bath School Museum located within the school district's middle school, adjacent to the site of the destroyed building. Angell's inscription states that it is dedicated to the courage and determination of the people of Bath. The sculpture was financed by <a href="../../../c/e/n/Cent_%28U.S._coin%29_711e.html" title="Cent (U.S. coin)">penny</a> donations from young students from the state of Michigan. It was rumored that the donated pennies were melted down to make the <a href="../../../c/a/s/Casting.html" title="Casting">cast</a> of the statue.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_Crime6"><sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../b/a/t/Bath_School_disaster_8221.html#endnote_Crime6" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../b/a/t/Bath_School_disaster_8221.html#endnote_Crime6" rel="nofollow">[31]</a></sup></span></p>
<p>The board demolished the damaged portion of the school and constructed a new wing with the donated funds.
