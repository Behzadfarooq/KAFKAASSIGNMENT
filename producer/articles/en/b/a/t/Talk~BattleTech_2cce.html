<p>Everyone that owns any of the books dating back to the time of Fasa it says battletech on them but since Wizkids has taken over all new copis ar enamed as mechwarrior, so going back to y comment in the updates section were I mentioned that Dark age and classic shoud be placed together is correct. An so that there is no confusion I am not talking o the clix or the classic battletech game. these are spinoffs, but not the Mechwarrior/Classic Battletech, and the darkage are the books relating to the universe itself. It i the Battletch Universe but the series as a whole has a new name this would mean that we would have to annouce in the intro that Battletech i the univers itself and that Classic Battletech has been renamed and Dark age the Books are the series is the true nake of odf the series noe. Sorry rambling here can't help sometimes. But we should ponder on this becuase this make the battlteh page less persice.This also leads me to belive just I tried to say in the update area that the battletech page should have mechwarrior and ark age together, right now we treat the dark age materieal noticable to the readers that don't relize that most of the info the are reading is not update. Besides we a massive updating to here we have good amount of info on any of this after the events o fthe clan invasion I see this as sad since how can someone just coming to the series get a undersanding of wealth of history in wich they would inheriting. Pleas elet me know If I rambled to much is so short paragraphs ok. thanks. [popa01|popa01] 8:13, 23 March 2007</p>

<dd>I completely disagree. BattleTech was the original name for the universe, and there are still products being published under the domain of BattleTech as Classic BattleTech. When Wizkids bought the rights to BattleTech, they released a new game entitled MechWarrior, so any information relating to that new game should be included in that section. I know there are many people who feel a lot more strongly than I do about MechWarrior: DA/AoD, so I have my doubts about whether or not this will even be given any serious consideration. <a href="../../../s/c/a/User%7EScaletail_7a31.html" title="User:Scaletail">Scaletail</a> 17:13, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Classic Battletech is ran by Fanpro, the battletech series is controlled by wizkeds, so by the grace of faza battletech as the name of the series is actually wrong now, but its still the battletech universe, two difference things. Besides the clix is a game not the books, again must I repeat the universe is the books not the games ok. unlike faza that had the timeline fiquered out they use the clix to effect the series as a whole. I not contesting that the clix is a spinoff but DA is the Battletech universe they arnt two seperat universes with the same people ok. By saying that DA is a spinoff than classic battletech is too. Fanpro did this so that people would relize that they are focusing on the original line and is progressing to link the the series together using the classic battletech sourcebooks. But this Scaletail are you wrong battletech is not the battletech anymore, it has been renamed see. Classic Battletech is soly on the shoulders of fanpro. And you proved yourself wrong since wizkids bought battletech they can do what they want do, if they want to rename by god they can. nothing we say can do that. But even wizkids still calls it the battletech universe, but the name of the series is Mechwarrior go out and oreder one of the old books of the original line and on it says Mechwarrior not Battletech. So tochauch I prononce that this can not be debated by mere feeling since the purpose of wikipedia is to give fatual info, not opions to keep the battletech pge as a whole like this is proving that the folks like me and most folks that read this arnt not gitting no satifaction in that readers will have the current information todate. We may contunie debating but since I have facts to sit unpon I feel what I suggets as fair.Popa01 03:01, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>First off, my apologies because I was treating this as if it was an actual merge request, which it is not. I'm not debating ownership of the intellectual property. Obviously, WizKids owns BattleTech and MechWarrior and can do what they want with them. Nonetheless, BattleTech still exists and is supported by FanPro, and it therefore deserves to have its own Wikipedia entry. I'm not entirely sure the grounds on which you want to merge the two articles together, but there are two separate and distinct war-games that are both actively supported by two different companies that just happen to share the same storyline. They are currently advancing that storyline in different time periods, so the two articles dedicated to the games would necessarily reflect that reality.</dd>
<dd>Now, many of the articles that cover that storyline need work, but as for your assertion that they are segregated, I would direct your attention to the articles on <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terra_%28BattleTech%29_bbf5.html" title="Terra (BattleTech)">Terra</a> and the <a href="../../../f/e/d/Federated_Suns_f457.html" title="Federated Suns">Federated Suns</a>. They both deal with events from the original BattleTech storyline, the newer Classic BattleTech storyline, as well as the Dark Age novels. I think you are confusing "<a href="../../../b/a/t/BattleTech_28c2.html" title="BattleTech">BattleTech</a>" with "<a href="../../../s/t/o/Storyline_of_the_BattleTech_universe_735e.html" title="Storyline of the BattleTech universe">Storyline of the BattleTech universe</a>," which does need a lot of work if it is to be kept as a viable article. <a href="../../../s/c/a/User%7EScaletail_7a31.html" title="User:Scaletail">Scaletail</a> 23:57, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"BattleTech" is the name of the franchise, universe, setting, etc. The "Classic" in front of "Classic BattleTech" is there to distinguish it from other "BattleTech" products, in the same way that "Dark Age" comes at the end of "MechWarrior: Dark Age."

<dd>I was wondering when there'd be a BTwiki. All the other good sci-fi universes had one. But I don't understand what you mean by an external link template. What does that do? Sorry, I'm still somewhat of a noob at wikipedia. Also, is there any reason why we can't just cpoy and paste info from WP to the BTwiki? If so, I dont think it would usually be ok the other way around as the BTwiki, while lacking in some areas, other areas have way too much info for WP. It would be <a href="../../../f/a/n/Fancruft.html" title="Fancruft">fancruft</a> for sure. But I'm on board to help out. <a href="../../../a/i/d/User%7EAidanPryde_ad47.html" title="User:AidanPryde">AidanPryde</a> 07:57, 10 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Elink template basically is added to elink section and it automatically generates text along the line: 'this topic is also discussed in BTwiki at this link]' - so we could easily keep the related articles synchronized. And certainly fancruft is offlimits here - but there are many subject that can be discussed well here; for example I see no reasen we should not have good articles on <a href="../../../c/l/a/Clan_Wolf_bc60.html" title="Clan Wolf">Clan Wolf</a> or Atlas (Battlemech). BTwiki would have (and already has) additional info - for example, Atlas prinatble sheets and players comments about the mech feasibility in game.--<sub><span style="border:1px solid #228B22;padding:1px;"><a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPiotrus_27db.html" title="User:Piotrus">&#160;Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus&#160;</a>|<a href="../../../p/i/o/User_talk%7EPiotrus_217f.html" title="User talk:Piotrus"><font style="color:#7CFC00;background:#006400;">&#160;talk&#160;</font></a></span></sub> 18:00, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Greetings, Nic from Sarna.net/BTWiki here. One of the main reasons I started BTWiki was to get a wiki where all of the content would be geared towards the BT universe, as Wikipedia won't allow a lot of what you are calling fancruft over here. Which is great -- both Wikipedia and BTWiki have their purposes. Wikipedia would be a great avenue to 'prune down' a lot of the content from BTWiki that would be 'rock solid' for Wikipedia, while we can use BTWiki to expand on a lot of the universe (fancruft) that shouldn't go here. Nicjansma 03:39, 22 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Yes, I certainly agree that's a valid solution, and elink templates would help us coordinate that 'rock solid' content. PS. Do consider registering&#160;:) --<sub><span style="border:1px solid #228B22;padding:1px;"><a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPiotrus_27db.html" title="User:Piotrus">&#160;Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus&#160;</a>|<a href="../../../p/i/o/User_talk%7EPiotrus_217f.html" title="User talk:Piotrus"><font style="color:#7CFC00;background:#006400;">&#160;talk&#160;</font></a></span></sub> 15:22, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi, I am one of the frequent contributors to the Batletech Wiki. As far as the neutrality o the articles and the issue of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> the articles are all written from sources that exist in the context of the game itself or the game universe. As the Battletech gaming universe has about twenty five plus years of development and history it has its own rich history that has a large library of sources that can verify the in universe facts about the game as well as a large number of sources that can verify the non fictional information in the game including information concerning the game rules and the history of the game itself. These paterials are available to anyone who has the actual hardcopy books or in some cases, when they have been converted by the publisher, the PDF files as well as the oficially released files for the BattleMech editor program called Heavy Metal Pro. This information has been released by Fanpro, Wizkids, and the defunct FASA Corporation. I hope that the inclusion or the cross refferencing to the BattleTechwiki information will be seriously considered as while it is a niche wiki it is a very rich and detailed gaming universe. I apologize for any typos or errors I have made and I hope that you dont think that I am trying to rant, that is not my intention, but I have a tendancy to get on a roll when I am passionate about something.

<p>Hey we should put some energyinto the battletech wiki thing and place info that is unwanted on the battletech page there for the time being like the trivia and just have the link go there</p>
<p>I've tacked on a paragraph about the game itself, because 'boardgame/war game' was a little vague. Makes BT sound like Monopoly with particle weapons. I also thought a mention should be made of the 'mech building system, which makes the game for me - I'm still bemoaning the fact I missed the opportunity to play a crit-monster I designed off the chassy of a Stalker.

<p>The other major faction groupings are "Successor States," "Clans," and "Periphery." Why break up "Terran Nations" into 3 sub-headings? Each of the Terran factions are so *very* closely related that you can't explain one without mentioning the others; and they have contiguous control of Terra and surrounding space.

<dd>I agree. While every state within BT can be broken up into smaller &amp; smaller factions, there are clearly three overall regions: the Inner Sphere, the Periphery and Clan Homeworlds (or Clan Space).

<p>The Star League is special, being a League of 10 or so allied nations - it is worth mentioning that Terra was its capitol; this also lets the reader know that Terra is important.

<dd>Yes sthat true but the waco rangers had been a small but a keen part of the story line for he wacos did lead in changes in the history of the innersphere, in since they were the yang of the yin of the dragoons. This is proven by the fact that waco rangers chased dragoon forces were ever they were believed to be such actions brought many things to happen. And also if you read some of the books the wacos were the main driving force of the battle of outreach. Yeah the Blakist paid and controled the rogue mercs but no to include them is wrong since it would be leaving a major factor of what happens in the Battletech universe.</dd>

<p>Er, is there anything to back that up? The original version of battletech "drew inspiration" principally from the cartoon RoboTech, or at least its mecha and miniatures (some details here: <a href="http://brianscache.com/unseen/" class="external free" title="http://brianscache.com/unseen/" rel="nofollow">http://brianscache.com/unseen/</a>).Skiltao 06:33, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Good question, I'd also always heard that <i>RoboTech</i>, <i>Macross</i>, etc. were the main inspiration. I'm not sure who originally put that tidbit in, but I preserved it when I revamped the front page in hopes that someone might add a reference. The Star Wars link is credible, I'd say, given its popularity leading up to BTech's release (and its prominent use of battle <a href="../../../m/e/c/Mecha.html" title="Mecha">mecha</a>), but if it can't be positively cited it should be dropped. (Or else mentioned merely for pop culture context.)</dd>
<dd>Just a thought -- since <i>Star Wars</i> popularized the use of the term "droid", and since the first edition used the term Droid instead of 'Mech, this may point to a connection. Still needs a cite though.<br />

<p>In other words the Battletech articles need a <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikiproject.html" title="Wikiproject">Wikiproject</a> and bad. Really bad. I was just glancing through one of the main articles <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_the_BattleTech_universe_1fed.html" title="History of the BattleTech universe">History of the BattleTech universe</a> and it's in need of a painful amount of copyediting and reworking. Once I started looking around further I found atrocious writting, jacked up formatting, typos, misspellings, broken links, empty links, <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walled_gardens.html" title="Walled gardens">walled gardens</a>, redundant material, and no standards of conformity in most of the rest of the Battletech articles as well. All of that doesn't even mention the policy violations all over the place. I wouldn't bat an eye if 75% of the articles out there right now were merged to a few main articles or just deleted outright.</p>
<p>I love Battletech and it deserves better. One of the articles (in a very OR statement) said that BT has a universe that is in the same realm of detail as Star Wars and Star Trek. I'll go further: BT has a more indepth and fleshed out universe than any other Sci-Fi or Fantasy realm out there to include Star Wars, Star Trek, Dungeons &amp; Dragons or Lord of the Rings. That's no joke. There has to be a huge and collaborative effort to fix wikipedia's coverage of this material.</p>
<p>I will get a WikiProject up and running, I will build it and make it work. I'm not going to claim to be an "expert" wikipedia editor but I'm already a member or participant of a few WikiProjects and was one of the founding members of another. I don't want to belittle the work that's been done already but there is vast room for improvment. What I need from you guys is a "here, here" of commited editors that are willing to sign up for a the BattleTech WikiProject that will actually put in the work that is needed. I can't do this alone and I need the Battletech fans (or just interested editors period) to help me out. I'll act as the Lead Coordinator (if there are no objections) but I need help. If anyone is interested place your name below and a brief comment on what you can best help out with. If anyone has questions don't be afraid to bring them up here or on my talkpage.

There appear to be at least stubs for most significant BT items, though several major products (<i>CityTech</i>) lack entries, as do some other important things like the animated series.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Also, I think the 75% figure is a bit high. If we're to take the editorial work being done in the Star Trek or Star Wars projects as a guideline, then distinct articles for many BT subjects (say, individual clans or worlds) are justified, though of course the vast majority are currently just stubs. That said, I'm sure there's plenty of scope for merging or doing away with some of the more arcane stuff.</dd>

<dd>I'm in, I agree 75% may be a bit high. I do think that the Dune universe is at least as detailed as BT, if not more. But thats an argument for another time. My BT knowledge isn't super great but I'm an english major, so I should be able to help out with the writing.<a href="../../../a/i/d/User%7EAidanPryde_ad47.html" title="User:AidanPryde">AidanPryde</a> 20:22, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>English major? Oh you messed up, now I'm no going to leave you alone until you agree to be a copyeditor.&#160;:) That and technical stuff is going to be the bulk of our initial workload. <a href="../../../n/e/o/User%7ENeoFreak_0f0c.html" title="User:NeoFreak">NeoFreak</a> 20:04, 4 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I completely agree and it sounds good. It's so bad, that I've moved most of my projects to <a href="http://www.battletechwiki.com/wiki/Main_Page" class="external text" title="http://www.battletechwiki.com/wiki/Main_Page" rel="nofollow">BattleTechWiki</a>, which I believe is a more suitable place for the vast majority of stuff that is here, anyway. <a href="../../../s/c/a/User%7EScaletail_7a31.html" title="User:Scaletail">Scaletail</a> 20:54, 3 April 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I'm with Scaletail. BattleTechWiki is more appropriate (for me) as a resource for the BT fan. Wikipedia is a great source for basic encyclopedia knowledge for those learning the community. I'm not opposed to developing a wikiproject here, but I'm not partial to putting the effort into it that I have at BTW. --Revanche 00:30, 4 April 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I agree as well. A dedicated wiki is the best place for more obscure and technical topics aimed at fans. This can be a great place for a broad coverage of the BT universe and game with links to the dedicated wiki. I'm going to give it a few more days to see who else signs up. Spread the word around and I'll start on some WP stuff so our construction time is eased. <a href="../../../n/e/o/User%7ENeoFreak_0f0c.html" title="User:NeoFreak">NeoFreak</a> 19:58, 4 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>
