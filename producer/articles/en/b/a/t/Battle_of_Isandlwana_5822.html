On <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_9.html" title="January 9">9 January</a> <a href="../../../1/8/7/1879.html" title="1879">1879</a> they moved to <a href="../../../r/o/r/Rorke%27s_Drift_9934.html" title="Rorke's Drift">Rorke's Drift</a>, and early on <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_11.html" title="January 11">January 11</a> commenced crossing the <a href="../../../b/u/f/Buffalo_River_a6e9.html" title="Buffalo River">Buffalo River</a> into <a href="../../../z/u/l/Zululand.html" title="Zululand">Zululand</a>.</p>
<p>The British pitched camp at <a href="../../../i/s/a/Isandlwana.html" title="Isandlwana">Isandlwana</a>, but because of the size of the force (precluding a <a href="../../../l/a/a/Laager.html" title="Laager">laager</a>, or circling of the wagons), the hard ground and a disbelief that they were in any danger, did not fortify the camp. In addition, it was believed that 1,000 British infantry, armed with Martini-Henry rifles, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martini-Henry_3cce.html" title="Martini-Henry">superior weapons</a> to the Zulus' primitive muskets, could meet any attack and overwhelm it through sheer firepower. However, the lack of defensive preparations, in hindsight, proved to be a major factor in the camp's defeat by the Zulu <a href="../../../i/m/p/Impi.html" title="Impi">impis</a> (regiments) which attacked on 22 January and was a costly lesson to learn.</p>
<p>The backbone of the British force under Lord Chelmsford consisted of twelve regular <a href="../../../i/n/f/Infantry.html" title="Infantry">infantry</a> companies: six each of both the 1st and 2nd battalions, 24th (2nd Warwickshire) Regiment of Foot which were hardened and reliable troops; in addition, there were approximately 2,500 local African auxiliaries of the <a href="../../../n/a/t/Natal_Native_Contingent_2bc2.html" title="Natal Native Contingent">Natal Native Contingent</a>, led by European officers but generally of poor quality; some irregular <a href="../../../c/a/v/Cavalry.html" title="Cavalry">cavalry</a> units, and a detachment of <a href="../../../a/r/t/Artillery.html" title="Artillery">artillery</a> consisting of two <a href="../../../f/i/e/Field_gun.html" title="Field gun">field guns</a> and several <a href="../../../c/o/n/Congreve_rocket.html" title="Congreve rocket">Congreve rockets</a>. Adding on wagon drivers, camp followers and servants, there were more than 4,000 men. Indeed, with a force of this size, it was the logistical arrangements of managing the supply chain and the huge number of wagons and oxen to support any forwad advance which occupied Chelmsford's thoughts, rather than any fear that the camp might be attacked.</p>
<p>Once he had established the sprawling camp at Isandlwana, Chelmsford sent out two battalions of NNC to scout ahead. They skirmished with elements of a Zulu force which Chelmsford believed to be the vanguard of the main enemy army. He divided his own force and with about 2,500 men - including half of the British infantry - set out to find the Zulus to bring them to battle, defeating them decisively.</p>
<p>He left five companies (around 80-90 men in each) of the 1st <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battalion.html" title="Battalion">battalion</a> and one stronger company (around 150 men) of the 2nd battalion 24th (2nd Warwickshire) <a href="../../../r/e/g/Regiment.html" title="Regiment">Regiment</a> of Foot (later the <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Wales_Borderers_e153.html" title="South Wales Borderers">South Wales Borderers</a>) behind to guard the camp, under the command of <a href="../../../b/r/e/Brevet_%28military%29.html" title="Brevet (military)">Brevet</a> <a href="../../../l/i/e/Lieutenant_Colonel_7041.html" title="Lieutenant Colonel">Lieutenant Colonel</a> <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_Pulleine_1ddb.html" title="Henry Pulleine">Henry Pulleine</a>. Pulleine's strict orders were to defend the camp. In addition, Pulleine had around 500 men of the NNC and approximately 200 mounted men. He also had two artillery pieces, with around 70 men of the Royal Artillery. In total, some 1,300 men and 2 guns to defend the camp. This force was more than sufficient, provided it was deployed correctly in a tight, defensive formation, close to the ammunition stores. Even without a laager or breastworks being formed, the Isandlwana mountain itself provided a natural barrier to protect the rear whilst the British force could be deployed in a semi-circle around it. However, as we shall see, this very far from reality.</p>
<p>Pulleine was an administrator and had no experience of front-line command on a campaign. Reports at 7am from the mounted vedettes (cavalry scouts) some 7 miles from camp suggested that bodies of Zulus, numbering around 4,000 men, could be seen. Further reports arrived into Pulleine's camp during the early morning. Around 10:30am, Colonel <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anthony_Durnford_04b0.html" title="Anthony Durnford">Anthony Durnford</a> arrived from <a href="../../../r/o/r/Rorke%27s_Drift_9934.html" title="Rorke's Drift">Rorke's Drift</a> with 5 troops of the Natal Native horse and a rocket battery. This put the issue of command to the fore because Durnford was senior (Pulleine's rank was a Brevet Colonel, in other words he was still being paid as a Major) and by tradition would have assumed command. However, he did not seem to over-ruled Pulleine's dispositions and after lunch he quickly decided to take to the offensive and take the battle to the Zulu force. He asked for a company of the 24th, but Pulleine was reluctant to agree since his orders had been specifcally to defend the camp. Durnford had a reputation for being reckless and impulsive and believed he was facing several hundred Zulus with his 400 men, rather than the acutal 25,000 who attacked the camp.</p>

<p>While Chelmsford was in the field seeking them, the entire Zulu army had actually totally outmanouvered him, moving behind his force with the intention of attacking the British camp. They were discovered at around 11am by men of Lt. Raw's troop of scouts who chased a number of Zulus into a valley, only then seeing around 25,000 men of the main enemy force sitting down in total quiet. There has been debate as to whether the 22nd January was the intended date of the attack (a partial eclipse of the sun was due that day which was a bad omen). However, having been discovered and with the camp too good a target to miss, the Zulu force leapt to the offensive.</p>
<p>The Zulu attack then developed in the traditional horns and chest of the buffalo, with the aim of encircling the British position. At first, only the chest (centre) of the attack seemed to be developing. Pulleine, therefore, rather than bringing in his troops into a tight defensive position, near the ammunition and with the Isandlwana feature protecting his rear, instead sent out first one, then all of his six companies of the 24th Foot into an extended firing line, with the aim of meeting the Zulu attack head on. Durnford's men had retreated to a donga (dried out watercourse) on the British right flank where they, too, determined to make a stand. The native troops were kept in reserve, although many of them started to leave the battlefield at this point - hence the relatively low casualty figures in their ranks.</p>
<p>For some time, the disciplined British volleys pinned down the Zulu centre, inflicting heavy casualties and causing the advance to stall. Indeed, morale remained high within the British line. The Martini-Henri rifle was a poweful weapon and the men were experienced. However, unknown to Pulleine, the Zulu force was moving to outflank the position and envelop it and he was doomed.</p>
<p>Debate persists as to how and why the British lost the battle. There are two different schools of thought. The traditional view, first put forward by Donald Morris in "The Washing of the Spears", is that the men, fighting too far from the camp, ran out of ammunition, starting first with Durnford's men who were holding the right flank and who had been in action longer, which precipitated a slow down in the rate of fire against the Zulus. This argument suggests that the ammunition was too far from the firing line and that the seventy rounds each man took to the firing line was not sufficient. In addition, their Martini-Henry rifles were prone to jamming in the intense heat caused by repeated firing. It is argued that when it became clear to Pulleine the fire was slowing, he ordered a retreat to the camp which broke into a rout. At this point the Zulus then overwhelmed the force quickly, with many of the men unable to fix bayonets, and only small pockets being able to come together to make stands. This view was established for many years and became part of the folklore surrounding the battle.</p>
<p>Revisionist views, however, recently supported with evidence from the battlefield, such as Ian Knight and Lt. Colonel Snook's works, suggest that although Durnford's men probably did run out of ammunition, the majority of men in the firing line did not. Rather, it was Durnford's retreat, and the general threat of the Zulu encirclement, leaving the rear, right and left flanks totally exposed, which caused Pulleine to order a withdrawal back to the camp. This was performed, by and large, with discipline and the men of the 24th (with the exception of G Company, 2nd/24th, which was left totally exposed by Durnford's retreat and slaughtered relatively quickly) fought a fighting retreat into the camp and made a number of protracted if desperate last stands. Evidence of this is that many of the bodies (today marked by cairns) were found in several large groups around the camp - including one stand of around 150 men.</p>
<p>It is difficult to be sure in either case, although the presence of large numbers of bodies grouped together suggests the resistance was more protracted than originally thought. Of course, the survivors' accounts of a rout and quick onslaught are open to criticism since they no doubt felt a sense of guilt at leaving their comrades and, possibly, wanted to paint a picture that the British force in the camp was wiped out very quickly as opposed to undergoing an agonising and protracted fight to the death.</p>
<p>What is clear is that the slaughter was immense and the area around the camp - and back to Natal along the Fugitive's Drift - was turned into a charnel house. The fighting was hand-to-hand and no quarter given. The British fought back-to-back (see C.F. Fripps' romanticised but haunting painting in the National Army Museum) with bayonet and rifle butt when their ammunition had finally been expended. In the end, they fought with pocket knives and fists. The Zulus certainly had respect for their British foe, in particular the bayonet. The frenzy of the Zulus' attack shocked many of the British, both soldiers and civilians alike. All living things in the camp were attacked and slashed at, including animals and civilians as well as soldiers. The bodies of the dead were ripped open in what appeared barbaric mutilation but which was actually a ritual to free the spirit of the dead and to stop the body swelling up. Many of the bodies were stabbed several times in the "washing of the spears" where every warrior was compelled to have stabbed an enemy, even after death.</p>

Because the medal was not at that time awarded posthumously, these awards were not made until 1907. It is however unclear why Lieutenant Melvill took the colours. A story which circulated after the battle among the 24th Regiment is that when all was lost, Pulleine ordered Melvill to save the colours to prevent the disgrace of them being captured by the enemy.

<p>Chelmsford, who was by now about 11km away had two indications that the camp was being attacked, but due to the hilly terrain had a poor view of the theatre of action. Unable to see anything amiss he apparently discounted both reports. One of the standard orders for the British, when attacked in camp, was to loosen the guy ropes on the tents so that soldiers would not get tangled up in them. This was not done and the upright tents were visible in the field glasses of the young officers with Chelmsford. Chelmsford took this to be an indication that the camp was not under attack. Chelmsford returned on the night of <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_22.html" title="January 22">January 22</a>, and his troops were forced to <a href="../../../b/i/v/Bivouac.html" title="Bivouac">bivouac</a> amongst the battle dead in what was a terrible scene - although the troops were raised before dawn to spare them the full horror of the scene. Nevertheless, many of the troops woke in the morning with the appearance of badly injured men, covered in the blood, entrials and brains of the dead. The troops also could hear the sounds of battle at <a href="../../../r/o/r/Rorke%27s_Drift_9934.html" title="Rorke's Drift">Rorke's Drift</a> and smoke could be seen rising from that direction.</p>

<p>Isandlwana was a <a href="../../../p/y/r/Pyrrhic_victory.html" title="Pyrrhic victory">Pyrrhic victory</a> for the Zulus not only because of the heavy casualties suffered in the battle but also because, as King Cetshwayo feared, it forced the policy makers in London, who to this point had not supported the war, to rally to the support of the pro-war contingent in the Natal government and commit whatever resources were needed to defeat the Zulu. The Zulus were poorly supplied with firearms and were not well trained with the few they had. The Zulus also, despite local numerical superiority, had manpower resources that could not match the British in a series of battles.</p>
<p>The British government's reasoning was threefold. <i>The first</i> was <a href="../../../j/i/n/Jingoistic.html" title="Jingoistic">jingoistic</a>: the British did not like to be beaten by anyone, particularly by people whom they considered inferior, and national honour demanded that the enemy, victors in one battle, should lose the war. <i>The second</i> concerned the domestic political implications which could have ramifications at the next parliamentary elections. <i>Thirdly</i>, there were considerations affecting the Empire: unless the British were seen to win a clear-cut victory against the Zulus, it would send a signal that the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Empire_782f.html" title="British Empire">British Empire</a> was not invulnerable and that the defeat of a British field army could alter policy. The British saw obvious parallels between their own position and that of the Roman Empire after the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Teutoburg_Forest_1aba.html" title="Battle of Teutoburg Forest">Battle of Teutoburg Forest</a>. Until then, one of the arguments against a war with the Zulu was that the costs could not be justified, but if the Zulu victory at Isandlwana encouraged rebellion elsewhere in the Empire, then committing the resources necessary to defeat the Zulu would in the long term prove cheaper than suppressing other rebellions in other parts of the Empire.</p>
<p>Shortly after the battle, around 4000 Zulu warriors attacked the mission station at <a href="../../../r/o/r/Rorke%27s_Drift_9934.html" title="Rorke's Drift">Rorke's Drift</a>, which was fortified by British soldiers. It was defended by only 139 British soldiers. Yet the battle at Rorke's Drift turned out very differently than the Battle at Isandlwana; the British inflicted horrific casualties upon the attacking Zulu, and successfully beat back the Zulus. Eleven <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victoria_Crosses_b89d.html" title="Victoria Crosses">Victoria Crosses</a> were awarded to defenders of Rorke's Drift, the most ever received by a regiment for a single action.</p>
<p>After Rorke's Drift, the field army was reinforced and re-invaded Zululand, defeating the Zulus in a number of engagements, the last of which was the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Ulundi_cf2c.html" title="Battle of Ulundi">Battle of Ulundi</a> and the capture of King Cetshwayo. The subkings of the Zulus were encouraged by the British to rule their subkingdoms without acknowledging a central Zulu power and by the time King Cetshwayo was allowed to return home, the Zulu kingdom was no longer perceived to be a threat to the British Empire.</p>
<p>Due to the film <i><a href="../../../z/u/l/Zulu_%28film%29.html" title="Zulu (film)">Zulu</a></i>, many people believe that the defenders of Isandlwana and Rorke's Drift were Welsh. In fact the Regiment did not begin to recruit Welsh soldiers primarily until a decade after the end of the Zulu War. Most of the men were in fact English as corrected in the film <i><a href="../../../z/u/l/Zulu_Dawn_846b.html" title="Zulu Dawn">Zulu Dawn</a></i>.</p>
