<p>The <b>Battle of Huertgen Forest</b> (<a href="../../../g/e/r/German_language.html" title="German language">German</a>: <i>Schlacht im Hürtgenwald</i>) is the name given to the series of fierce battles fought between U.S. and German forces during <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a> in the <a href="../../../h/u/e/Huertgen_forest.html" title="Huertgen forest">Hürtgen (also: Huertgen) Forest</a>. The battles took place between <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_19.html" title="September 19">September 19</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/4/1944.html" title="1944">1944</a>, and <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_10.html" title="February 10">February 10</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/4/1945.html" title="1945">1945</a>, in a strategically insignificant corridor of barely 50 square miles (129 km²) east of the Belgian–German border.</p>
<p>U.S. commanders’ initial goal was to pin down German forces in the area so as to keep them from reinforcing the front lines further north, between <a href="../../../a/a/c/Aachen.html" title="Aachen">Aachen</a> and the <a href="../../../r/u/r/Rur.html" title="Rur">Rur (Roer) River</a>, where the Allies were basically fighting a trench war between a network of fortified towns and villages connected with field fortifications, tank traps, and minefields. A secondary objective may have been to outflank the front line. The Americans' initial objectives were to take Schmidt, clear <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monschau.html" title="Monschau">Monschau</a>, and advance to the Rur. The Germans viciously defended the area for two reasons: It served as staging area for the Ardennes Offensive (what became the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_the_Bulge_17b4.html" title="Battle of the Bulge">Battle of the Bulge</a>) that was already in preparation, and the mountains commanded access to the Schwammenauel Dam<sup class="noprint">[<a href="../../../a/t/t/Wikipedia%7EAttribution_916a.html" title="Wikipedia:Attribution"><i><span title="The material in the vicinity of this tag needs to be fact-checked with the cited source(s)." style="white-space: nowrap;">verification needed</span></i></a>]</sup> (Rurtalsperre Schwammenauel) at the head of the Rur Lake (Rurstausee) which, if opened, would flood low-laying areas downstream and deny any crossing of the river. The Allies only recognized this after several heavy setbacks, and the Germans were able to hold the region until they launched their final major, last-ditch offensive on the <a href="../../../w/e/s/Western_Front_%28World_War_II%29_1965.html#1944_.E2.80.93_1945" title="Western Front (World War II)">Western Front</a>, into the <a href="../../../a/r/d/Ardennes.html" title="Ardennes">Ardennes</a>.</p>

<p>The American high command was flush with success after the breakout from the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Normandy_a39c.html" title="Battle of Normandy">Normandy</a> <a href="../../../b/r/i/Bridgehead.html" title="Bridgehead">bridgehead</a> and hoped they could quickly break through and push further into Germany. Multiple divisions were sent in to the Hürtgen Forest, only to be decimated and replaced by still more divisions. Even with armor, air, and artillery support, all advantages held by the Americans were negated by the inhospitable forest terrain. Despite smaller numbers, the Germans were able to impede the larger American force thanks to the difficult terrain and having good defensive positions—plus they had ample experience in winter and mountain warfare that the Americans mostly lacked.</p>
<p>It was the perfect military scenario for the overstretched German army. If overtaken, the Germans could have easily flooded the entire Rur river system downstream from the dam, delaying the Americans' advance. The Germans were heavily entrenched in the forest and also made use of the <a href="../../../s/i/e/Siegfried_Line_19a5.html" title="Siegfried Line">Siegfried Line</a> defenses in the area, inflicting heavy casualties in the longest single battle the U.S. Army has ever fought in its history<sup id="_ref-Regan_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Regan" title="">[2]</a></sup>: The Americans suffered well over 24,000 direct casualties during the battle, plus another 9,000 casualties due to fatigue, illness, and friendly fire; casualties among the Germans also reached 12,000. Despite this, the Battle of Hürtgen Forest is largely forgotten because the Battle of the Bulge, which began shortly afterwards, stole the spotlight. The victory was hard-fought, the engagement was long, and the casualties tremendous, making it a difficult event to glorify from either side.</p>

<p>By mid-September <a href="../../../1/9/4/1944.html" title="1944">1944</a>, the Allied pursuit of the German army after Normandy had slowed due to extended supply lines and the consequent German recovery. The next strategic objective was to move up to the <a href="../../../r/h/i/Rhine.html" title="Rhine">Rhine River</a> along its entire length and prepare to cross it. <a href="../../../c/o/u/Courtney_Hodges_fdbd.html" title="Courtney Hodges">Courtney Hodges</a>’ <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._First_Army_6608.html" title="U.S. First Army">1st Army</a> experienced hard resistance pushing through the Aachen Gap and perceived a potential threat from enemy forces using the Hürtgen Forest as a base.</p>
<p>In early October, the <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._1st_Infantry_Division_d8ad.html" title="U.S. 1st Infantry Division">U.S. 1st Infantry Division</a> arrived, joining elements of the U.S. XIX Corps and VII Corps, which had encircled <a href="../../../a/a/c/Aachen.html" title="Aachen">Aachen</a>. Although the 1st Infantry Division called for the surrender of the German garrison in the city, German commander <a href="../../../o/b/e/Oberst.html" title="Oberst">Colonel</a> <a href="../../../g/e/r/Gerhard_Wilck_6554.html" title="Gerhard Wilck">Gerhard Wilck</a> refused to capitulate until <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_21.html" title="October 21">October 21</a>.</p>
<p>It was also necessary to remove the threat posed by the Rur dam<sup class="noprint">[<a href="../../../a/t/t/Wikipedia%7EAttribution_916a.html" title="Wikipedia:Attribution"><i><span title="The material in the vicinity of this tag needs to be fact-checked with the cited source(s)." style="white-space: nowrap;">verification needed</span></i></a>]</sup>. In German hands, the stored water could be readily released, swamping any forces operating downstream.

<p>In hindsight, military historians are no longer convinced of these arguments. An American historian, who served in the Hürtgen battle, has described it as “a misconceived and basically fruitless battle that should have been avoided.”</p>

<p>The Hürtgen Forest occupies a rugged area between the Rur river and Aachen. The dense conifer forest is broken by few roads and tracks and firebreaks and vehicular movement is restricted. In the autumn and early winter of 1944, the weather was cold and wet and often prevented air support. Ground conditions varied from wet to snow cover.</p>
<p>The German defenders had prepared the area with blockhouses, minefields, barbed wire, and booby-traps, hidden by the snow. Also there were a number of bunkers in the area, mostly belonging to the deep defenses of the Siegfried Line, which were also centers of resistance. The dense forest allowed infiltration and flanking attacks and it was sometimes difficult to establish a front line or to be confident that an area had been cleared of the enemy. The small numbers of routes and clearings had also allowed German machine-gun, mortar and artillery teams to pre-range their weapons and fire accurately. Apart from the bad weather, the dense forest and rough terrain also prevented proper use of the Allied air superiority which had great difficulties to spot any targets.</p>
<p>The American advantage in numbers (as high as 5-to-1), armor, mobility, and air support was greatly reduced. In the forest, relatively small numbers of determined and prepared defenders could be highly effective. As the American divisions took casualties, inexperienced recruits were brought up to the front as replacements: the U.S. Official History<sup class="noprint">[<a href="../../../a/t/t/Wikipedia%7EAttribution_916a.html" title="Wikipedia:Attribution"><i><span title="The material in the vicinity of this tag needs to be fact-checked with the cited source(s)." style="white-space: nowrap;">verification needed</span></i></a>]</sup> says: “Any numerical advantage the Americans may have possessed lay in bug-eyed replacements, who began to arrive in small, frightened bunches.”<span title="The text in the vicinity of this tag needs citation." class="noprint" style="font-size:small;"><sup>[<a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html#When_you_quote_someone" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources">cite this quote</a>]</sup></span> The impenetrable forest also limited the use of tanks and hid anti-tank teams equipped with <a href="../../../p/a/n/Panzerfaust.html" title="Panzerfaust">panzerfausts</a>. Later in the battle, it proved necessary to blast tank routes through the forest. Transport was similarly limited by the lack of routes: at critical times it proved difficult to reinforce or supply front-line units or to evacuate their wounded. The Germans were hampered by much of the same difficulties, of course— their divisions had taken heavy losses on the retreat through France and were hastily filled up with untrained boys, men unfit for service, and old men. Transport was also a problem, not only through the difficult roads but by lack of trucks and fuel, and a lot of the supplies were manhandled to the front line. But the German defenders had the advantage that their commanders and many of their soldiers had been fighting for a few years and had learned the necessary tactics for fighting efficiently in winter and forest, whereas the Americans were often well-trained but inexperienced.</p>
<p>The tall forest canopy also favored the defenders. Falling artillery rounds were often primed to detonate as <a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_burst.html" title="Air burst">tree bursts</a>. While defenders were protected from shell fragments (and wooden splinters from the trees) by their dug-in defensive positions, attackers were in the open and much more vulnerable.<sup id="_ref-TB_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-TB" title="">[3]</a></sup> Conversely, U.S. mortar platoons needed clearings in which to work—these were few and dangerous, so support was often unavailable to rifle platoons.</p>

<p>At the start, the forest was defended by the German 275th and 353rd Infantry Divisions; under strength but well prepared—5,000 men (1,000 in reserve)—and commanded by General Schmidt<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since March 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup>, they had little artillery and no tanks.

<p>This phase concentrated on the town of Schmidt, astride an important German supply route, and the southern part of the forest.</p>
<p>The engagement began on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_19.html" title="September 19">September 19</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/4/1944.html" title="1944">1944</a>, with a probe by the U.S. 60th Infantry Regiment that entered the Hürtgen Forest but was beaten back by the terrain and opposition.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_5.html" title="October 5">October 5</a>, the U.S. 9th Infantry Division attacked the town of Schmidt using the 60th and 39th Infantry Regiments while the 47th held a defensive position. The Monschau–<a href="../../../d/%C3%BC/r/D%C3%BCren.html" title="Düren">Düren</a> road was quickly cut but both regiments were slowed by defenses and suffered significant casualties: the 60th’s 2nd battalion was reduced to a third after the first day. The 39th was halted at the Weisser Weh <a href="../../../s/t/r/Stream.html" title="Stream">stream</a>; there were problems with narrow paths, air bursts in trees, fire breaks blocked or enfiladed. Evacuation and supply was difficult or impossible.</p>
<p>The slogging match continued. By <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_16.html" title="October 16">October 16</a>, 3,000 yards had been gained at the cost of 4,500 casualties. The <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._28th_Infantry_Division_a572.html" title="U.S. 28th Infantry Division">U.S. 28th Infantry Division</a>, a <a href="../../../p/e/n/Pennsylvania.html" title="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a> <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_National_Guard_9eaf.html" title="United States National Guard">National Guard</a> unit, arrived on <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_16.html" title="October 16">October 16</a> to relieve the battered 9th.</p>
<p>The 28th Division was reinforced with armor, tracked transport <a href="../../../m/2/9/M29_Weasel_32bf.html" title="M29 Weasel">Weasels</a> and air support. Of its three regiments, one was deployed to protect the northern flank, another to attack Germeter, and the third to capture Schmidt, the main objective. The area had terrible terrain with the <a href="../../../k/a/l/Kall%2C_Germany_35d0.html" title="Kall, Germany">Kall</a> Trail running along a deep river ravine. This was not tank country, despite the need to support the infantry.</p>
<p>The attack by 28th Division started on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_2.html" title="November 2">November 2</a>; the defenders were expecting it and were ready. The 109th Infantry Regiment was impeded after 300 yards by an unexpected minefield, pinned down by mortar and artillery fire and harassed by local <a href="../../../c/o/u/Counterattack.html" title="Counterattack">counterattacks</a>. One mile was gained after two days, the 109th dug-in and endured casualties. The 112th Infantry Regiment attacked Vossenack and the neighboring ridge, which were captured on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_2.html" title="November 2">November 2</a>. The 112th was then halted on the Kall by strong defenses and difficult terrain. The 110th had to clear the woods next to the River Kall, capture Simonskall, and maintain a supply route for the advance on Schmidt; again these were very difficult tasks due to weather, prepared defenses, determined defenders, and terrain. The weather prevented tactical air support until <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_5.html" title="November 5">November 5</a>.</p>
<p>The 112th captured Schmidt on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_3.html" title="November 3">November 3</a>, cutting the German supply route to Monschau but no American supply, reinforcement or evacuation was possible as the Kall Trail was blocked. A strong German counterattack by tanks of 116th Panzer Division and infantry from 89th Division rapidly expelled the Americans from Schmidt and they were unable to counterattack. For two days, the 112th remained hard pressed to hold its positions outside Schmidt.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_6.html" title="November 6">November 6</a>, the 12th Infantry Regiment was detached from the 4th Division and sent to reinforce the 28th Division.</p>
<p>At Vossenack, the 2nd battalion of the 112th disintegrated after constant shelling and fled a German attack. Following the providential arrival of two U.S. armored platoons of tanks and <a href="../../../m/1/0/M10_Wolverine_29c0.html" title="M10 Wolverine">M10 Wolverine</a> <a href="../../../t/a/n/Tank_destroyer.html" title="Tank destroyer">tank destroyers</a>, supported by those 2nd battalion men who had held tight and two companies of 146th Engineers operating as infantry, the fighting for Schmidt continued until <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_10.html" title="November 10">November 10</a>.</p>
<p><a name="Second_phase" id="Second_phase"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Hurtgen_Forest_31f4.html" title="Edit section: Second phase">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Second phase</span></h2>
<p>In this phase, the U.S. 4th Div was to clear the northern half of the forest between Schevenhütte and Hürtgen, capture Hürtgen and advance to the <a href="../../../r/u/r/Rur.html" title="Rur">Rur (Roer) River</a> south of <a href="../../../d/%C3%BC/r/D%C3%BCren.html" title="Düren">Düren</a>. From <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_10.html" title="November 10">November 10</a>, this would be VII Corps' responsibility and it was part of the main VII Corps effort to reach the Rur. The 4th Division was now fully committed to the Hürtgen, although its 12th Infantry Regiment was already mauled from its action at Schmidt, leaving just two fully effective regiments to achieve the divisional objectives. U.S. VII Corps was opposed by German forces, mainly from the 81st Corps, consisting of three understrength divisions. In the Hürtgen, there was the 275th Division—6,500 men with 150 artillery pieces. They were well dug-in and prepared.</p>
<p>The abstract of a <a href="http://www.dtic.mil/" class="external text" title="http://www.dtic.mil/" rel="nofollow">Defense Technical Information Center</a> report describes what happened:<sup id="_ref-Huertgen_Forest_Deliberate_Attack_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Huertgen_Forest_Deliberate_Attack" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The VII (U.S.) Corps, 1st Army attacked 16 November 1944 with 1st Inf Div, 4th Inf Div, 104th Inf Div, and CCR 5th AD to clear Huertgen Forest and the path of 1st Army to the Roer River. After heavy fighting, primarily by the 4th Infantry Division, VII Corps' attack ground to a halt. V Corps was committed on 21 November 1944. Attacking with 8th Inf Div, and CCR 5th AD, the V Corps managed to capture Huertgen after stiff fighting on 28 November 1944.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The attack started on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_16.html" title="November 16">November 16</a>. The two infantry regiments attacked in parallel columns: the 8th along the northern edge of the forest towards Düren, the 22nd further south in parallel. The open flanks invited infiltration. Similar tactics elsewhere in Hürtgen had “invited disaster”.</p>
<p>Attacks by the 8th Infantry Regiment on Rother Weh stream hit heavy resistance and were repulsed with heavy losses. The 22nd failed to take Raven’s hedge, beaten back by heavy machine-gun and artillery fire along the firebreaks. After three days there were 300 losses, including officers and <a href="../../../n/c/o/NCO_a82b.html" title="NCO">NCOs</a>.</p>
<p>By <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_18.html" title="November 18">November 18</a> tanks were deemed essential, so engineers blasted tank routes through the forest. Communications and logistics remained a problem, so on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_19.html" title="November 19">November 19</a> the attack paused to allow re-supply and evacuation of the wounded. German reinforcements arrived from 344th and 353rd Divisions and resistance stiffened further. On <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_20.html" title="November 20">November 20</a>, <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russell_J._York_e764.html" title="Russell J. York">Russell J. York</a>, a medic with the <a href="../../../4/t/h/4th_Engineer_Battalion_4421.html" title="4th Engineer Battalion">4th Engineer Battalion</a> , earned a <a href="../../../s/i/l/Silver_Star_18bc.html" title="Silver Star">Silver Star</a> in the Weisser Weh battle when heavy shelling hampered efforts to install a bridge.</p>
<p>Responsibility was returned to V Corps and, on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_21.html" title="November 21">November 21</a>, <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._8th_Infantry_Division_3c9c.html" title="U.S. 8th Infantry Division">8th Division</a> attacked the Weisser Weh valley, continuing towards Hürtgen. The 121st Infantry Regiment hit heavy defenses immediately. Despite armored support from the 10th Tank Battalion, daily advances were less than 600 yards. Hürtgen was taken on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_29.html" title="November 29">November 29</a> and the battle continued to Kleinhau, one mile north.</p>
<p>The final action in the Hürtgen Forest was at <a href="../../../m/e/r/Merode.html" title="Merode">Merode</a>, on the northeastern edge of the forest. Two American companies took the village but they were later destroyed in a German counterattack.</p>
<p>Elements of the 8th and the 28th Infantry Divisions then advanced on Brandenberg. The 28th Division, just like the 9th before it (and the 4th Infantry Division, which would relieve the 28th), also took heavy casualties during its stay in the Hürtgen Forest. On <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_14.html" title="November 14">November 14</a>, the 2nd Ranger Battalion arrived to relieve elements of the 112th Infantry Regiment. On <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_6.html" title="December 6">December 6</a>, the Rangers moved on Bergstein and subsequently took the strategic position of <a href="../../../h/i/l/Hill_400%2C_Bergstein_030f.html" title="Hill 400, Bergstein">Hill 400</a>. Shortly thereafter, on <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_12.html" title="December 12">December 12</a>, the towns of Gey and Strass were taken by American Forces.</p>

Two divisions, the <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._4th_Infantry_Division_43d4.html" title="U.S. 4th Infantry Division">U.S. 4th Infantry Division</a> and the <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._9th_Infantry_Division_6479.html" title="U.S. 9th Infantry Division">U.S. 9th Infantry Division</a>, were so badly mauled that they were withdrawn from the line to recuperate.</p>

<p>In the second phase, the U.S. 4th Division had advanced 1½ miles by <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_20.html" title="November 20">November 20</a>, having suffered 1,500 battle casualties plus non-battle casualties numbering in the several hundreds due to trench foot, frostbite, and exhaustion.

The 22nd Infantry Division had 2,500 casualties compared to its starting strength of 2,500.</p>

<p>On <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_16.html" title="December 16">December 16</a>, 1944 German forces began the Ardennes Offensive, more commonly known as the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_the_Bulge_17b4.html" title="Battle of the Bulge">Battle of the Bulge</a>. The surprise German offensive caught Allied forces off guard and forced a gigantic bulge in their lines. American units stationed in the area, including the 8th Division, the 104th, the 82nd Airborne and the 101st Airborne staged a heroic defense, typified by the defense of <a href="../../../b/a/s/Bastogne.html" title="Bastogne">Bastogne</a>, in one of the most important battles of the war and the largest in U.S. history.</p>
<p>The Ardennes Offensive was completely halted by mid-January, and in early February, American forces attacked through the Hürtgen Forest for the final time. On <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_10.html" title="February 10">February 10</a>, the Schwammenauel dam was taken by American forces, although the Germans had opened the floodgates of the dam the day before and thus the <a href="../../../r/u/r/Rur.html" title="Rur">Rur</a> Valley was flooded, halting the U.S. push for the Rhine across the little river for two further weeks, until the attackers finally managed to cross the river on February 23rd when the waters had sunk again.</p>
<p>Two soldiers of the U.S. 4th Infantry Division were awarded <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medal_of_Honor_1efa.html" title="Medal of Honor">Medals of Honor</a> for action in the battle one of whom was <a href="../../../l/i/e/Lieutenant_Colonel_7041.html" title="Lieutenant Colonel">Lieutenant Colonel</a> George Mabry<a href="http://www.homeofheroes.com/moh/citations_1940_wwii/mabry.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.homeofheroes.com/moh/citations_1940_wwii/mabry.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, the second-most highly decorated U.S. soldier of World War II.</p>

<p>There is an ongoing discussion of whether the American battle plan made any sense. One possibility is that U.S. strategy grossly underestimated the individual strength and determination remaining in the psyche of the German soldier at this late point in the war. In addition, the Americans concentrated on the village of Schmidt and neither tried to conquer the strategic Rur Dams nor recognized the importance of <a href="../../../h/i/l/Hill_400%2C_Bergstein_030f.html" title="Hill 400, Bergstein">Hill 400</a> until an advanced stage of the battle.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
