<p>Firstly in order for there to be a rethreat there has to be an attack, although as unsucessfull it is Turkish troops did attack russians. So there is no reason to remove that.</p>
<p>Turkish troops were too weak to fight. After all they marched through snow (blizzard) and extreme cold in summer clothes.</p>
<p>"Armenian Genocide" is not relevant to this battle. Weather this campaign let to that is a matter of debate as well as is an opinion and hence is not encyclopedic. Its political as far as I care. The incident had taken place months after the conclusion of this battle. See <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armenian_Genocide_187a.html" title="Armenian Genocide">Armenian Genocide</a> which reflects the incidents beginging as "24 April 1915". Sarikamis operation had taken place roughly between 21 December 1914 - 5 January 1915. Hence is not relevant.</p>

<p>Inanna and Khoikhoi, please stop edit warring and let's discuss this calmly and in a civil manner. The numbers of both initial army strengths and casualties seem to be very ambiguous. A bit of googling got me these two references:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="http://www.libarts.ucok.edu/history/faculty/roberson/course/1493/supplements/chp22/World%20War%20I%20part%201.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.libarts.ucok.edu/history/faculty/roberson/course/1493/supplements/chp22/World%20War%20I%20part%201.htm" rel="nofollow">An article</a> by prof Jere W.

</ol>
<p>I think both of them can be considered neutral, third party, reliable sources. Since Khoikhoi objects to Turkish language sources, I suggest we restrict ourselves to these.</p>
<p>According to the <b>first article</b> we have the following figures:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Russians: 100,000 before,&#160;?? casualties</dd>
<dd>Turkish: "slightly fewer than the Russians" before, 30,000 casualties in battle and "thousands more froze to death in the retreat".</dd>
</dl>
<p>According to the <b>second article</b> we have:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Ruassians:&#160;?? before,&#160;?? casualties</dd>
<dd>Turkish: 190,000 before, 12,400 survived, 30,000 battle casualties and the rest (that would make 147,600 people) died in the retreat.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Now, the figure 190,000 sounds bloated to me. It contradicts the other source that says that Turkish forces were slightly fewer than 100,000. But, if we guess that it is a typographic mistake and assume that the initial number of Turkish forces were 90,000 that would make more sense and not contradict the first source. I am making a wild guess here, so if anyone disagrees I withdraw that proposal!!</p>
<p>In the light of the above I ask you to share opinions, <b>calmly</b>. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichalis_Famelis_3076.html" title="User:Michalis Famelis">Michalis Famelis</a> 01:38, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Your assessment sounds reasonable to me, at first glance here anyway. CNN puts the Turkish death toll somewhat higher: <i>In 1914, the battle of Sarikamis began between Turkey and Russia. Although superior in numbers, the Turks were defeated in five days of fighting, losing 77,000 men.</i> At any rate, there are some good books on the subject that really resolve this issue. Ordered to Die: A History of the Ottoman Army in the First World War by Edward J Erickson and The First World War: The War to End All Wars by Geoffrey Jukes, Peter Simkins, Michael Hickey would probably answer all of our questions better than anything on the web. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETombseye_7b4d.html" title="User:Tombseye">Tombseye</a> 02:56, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/t/Talk%7EBattle_of_Sar%C4%B1kam%C4%B1%C5%9F_2a2f.html" title="Edit section: Why I go with the 100,000 figure">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Why I go with the 100,000 figure</span></h3>
<p>In Fromkin's book "A Peace to End all Peace" he references the 12th edition of the E.B. article on the battle which was writen by one of the German staff officers who was there on the campaign (Major Franz Carl Endres). This officer (who had the location and reason to know the facts) provided the figure of 90,000 effectives with just 12,500 returning to the Ottoman base at Erzurum. This is a source who was thought good enough by the E.B. back in 1924 and was in a position to know the actual figures. Perhaps part of the confusion is related to the idea of "soldiers" vs "everyone". The everyone category can include a great many people who are driving animals, pushing artillery, etc. Porters. I've seen figures for the British army in Mesopotamia where they had about 100,000 soliders and 400,000 total men.</p>
<p>Also, I absolutely see the connection between this battle and the Armenian Genocide. Enver - thinks he is the greatest general - has his army shattered by a weaker force. He needs someone to blame because it surely isn't HIS fault that he lost. Who does he pick? We know who he picked - those traitorous Armenians, that's who. He's got some reason, some Armenians did fight for the Russians, perhaps some Armenians living on the Ottoman side of the frontier actually did help the Russians (they had good reason, see the <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hamidian_massacres.html" title="Hamidian massacres">Hamidian_massacres</a> from 20 years earlier). In any event, Enver then orders the removal of all Armenians from the Ottoman army (and they likely all subsequently died, look how well the Ottomans treated the 8,000 POWs from Townshend's division). So, Enver doesn't trust the Armenians, thinks they screwed up his lovely war plan and then, when the Russians launch their offensive into Ottoman Armenia, and the Armenians at Van revolt in Russia's favor... time for the hammer to come down.</p>

<dd>The 90,000 minus the 12,500 gives us approximately 77,500 so that figure seems to back the CNN history link I found. As for the relation to the Armenian Genocide, well sure the connection between the conflict between Russia and the Ottomans is the main reason for the Armenian Genocide, but I'm not sure what point it would serve to put that in this article. It'd probably be better served, written in a manner that isn't POV as with the sarcasm regarding Enver, to mention it in the Armenian Genocide article. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETombseye_7b4d.html" title="User:Tombseye">Tombseye</a> 18:07, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hmm, someone's going to have to hit the library to get the info. as neither my encyclopedia or my other book 'A History of Russia' by Riasanovsky goes over the war casualties and barely alludes to the battle itself. The internet sources are pretty weak, nationalistic, or outwardly biased, so we'd be better off is someone looked up some of the books I've mentioned or other books about the battle or World War I to get exact figures on the Russian casualties and troop strength. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETombseye_7b4d.html" title="User:Tombseye">Tombseye</a> 23:02, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Battle of Sarikamis is a important battle in our history.We usually call it "Sarıkmış Tragedy".Enver Pasha's party(who became leader by revolution) had done very bad things about Ottoman Empire.Then he escaped to russia...etc.</p>
<p>They sent the Turkish Army there by simply uniforms.And then, 90,000 soliders freezed in -40c at the battle area...<a href="../../../-/i/n/User%7E-Inanna-_9e9b.html" title="User:-Inanna-">Inanna</a> 00:30, 11 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Inanna, what do you think of the casualties figures? It seems from the above sources that we have collected that Ottoman casualties were approximately 77,000 which is different from the figure you give. And in your recent edits you give a magnitude of Enver Pasha's troops before the tragedy as 160,000. Would you care to comment on these numbers? Also, I do not by any means want to sound offencive, but do you think we could have the Turkish language phrase for "Sarikamis Tragedy" at the top of the article, right after the initial statement? I think it would be informative. -- <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichalis_Famelis_3076.html" title="User:Michalis Famelis">Michalis Famelis</a> 00:54, 11 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Would you care to provide some source on these figures? The figures as are presented before come from in my opinion reliable, third party sources, such as Encyclopedia Brittanica and the CNN. Also, since you speak Turkish could you please say how "Sarikamis Tragedy" is told in the Turkish language? Is it "Sarıkmış Trajedi" (a wild guess here, just because <a href="../../../t/r/a/Tragedy.html" title="Tragedy">Tragedy</a> interlinks to <a href="../../../../tr/t/r/a/Trajedi.html" class="extiw" title="tr:Trajedi">tr:Trajedi</a>). --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichalis_Famelis_3076.html" title="User:Michalis Famelis">Michalis Famelis</a> 01:06, 11 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I disagree. I think that Brittanica, as a neutral party in the matter and given the fact that its numbers are based on a third party observer (the German officer mentioned by Cglassey above), is a reliable source in this. The 90,000 figure you say that everyone in Turkey would report could be bloated, as such matters often get into "folk history" which tends to exaggerate. After all, don't you agree that a report made by an eye-witness is more credible than a filtered-through-tradition version of the story held by a people 90 years after the events? -- <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichalis_Famelis_3076.html" title="User:Michalis Famelis">Michalis Famelis</a> 20:43, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have to agree. Of the two sources, Britannica has less reason to be 'biased' as opposed to the Kars principality which may, for whatever reason, seek to increase the numbers.

<p>Russian forces: The Russian forces are estimated at 100,000 by John Keegan in his WWI book (as well as other sources, such as DuPuy). I haven't found any sources that contradict this but it doesn't make much sense. The Russians were quite seriously worried about Enver's attack and their urgent appeal for aid from the British and French was the cause of the Gallipoli campaign. Why, if the Russians had 100,000 would they be worried by an Ottoman attack with an army of just 90,000? Why would the commander of the Russian army want to withdraw to Kars (an action which Yudenich did not, in fact, carry out)? The numbers which we have don't make sense. I personally think Enver's army is larger than 90,000 and the Russian army is smaller than 100,000 but I can't offer sources.</p>
<p>2nd point: I can't figure out who Yudenich was taking orders from. Was it Vorontsov, the Governor General of the Cacasus? Or was it this mysterious General Mishlaevski? Perhaps Yudenich took orders from both? Vorontsov was dead within a few months (1915) and the Grand Duke comes in as his replacement in September. -- <a href="../../../c/g/l/User%7ECglassey_8e74.html" title="User:Cglassey">cglassey</a> 15 February 2006</p>

<p>1-) Yes, Enver Pasha blamed Armenians because Armenians were really guilty because of their geurilla attacks on Turkish troops but that, of course, didn't play a critical role in the battle.</p>
<p>2-)Actually the Sarıkamış operation wasn't a military failure. It had to be done because if we would wait until the summer comes, Russians would finish their preparations and they could easily conquer the whole eastern territory of the empire. Sacrafices of Turksih troops made it possible to keep much of our territories(still with losing many important places).</p>
<p>3-)Enver Pasha was a Turkish nationalist and of course he would want to capture the Central Asia where our fathers came from and where our brothers still live but at the time of Sarıkamıs this wasn't his goal. He tried to keep Russians where they are. If the Russian threat could be stopped, Ottoman forces would be transferred to Middle East and Balkans.</p>
