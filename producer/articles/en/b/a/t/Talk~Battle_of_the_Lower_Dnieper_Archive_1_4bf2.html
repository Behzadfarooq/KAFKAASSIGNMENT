<h2><span class="mw-headline">Hitler's Motives</span></h2>
<p>Quoted: Mid-August, Hitler understood that the Soviet offensive could not be contained - at least, not until some internal disagreement would break up among the Allies. Considering all this, he decided to buy time by constructing a series of fortifications to slow down the Red Army and demanded the Wermacht to defend its positions on the Dnieper at all costs</p>
<p>This gives Hitler a reasonable amount of credit as a strategist. Given only the bare facts (I've not studied this), it seems reasonable to suggest that Hitler was merely trying to hold onto conquered territory at all costs (he had refused to allow retreats on several other occasions). Does the scholarship suggest otherwise? Won't change till someone knowledgeable rings in.Skanar</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">coriolis force myth</span></h2>
<p>It is claimed that the right bank of the Dnieper is higher due to the <a href="../../../c/o/r/Coriolis_force.html" title="Coriolis force">coriolis force</a>. This is untrue. (e.g. compare to a river near you). Sure, the right bank <i>of the Dnieper</i> is generally higher because it tends to curve to the right. However, this curving is caused by local geology and most certainly <i>not</i> by the Coriolis force. This reminds me of the common coriolis force myth that water draining from a sink spirals differently in the northern and southernm hemisphere. Come <i>on</i>. Try it with different tap positions, instead. <a href="../../../d/e/u/User%7EDeuar_eca8.html" title="User:Deuar">Deuar</a> 13:16, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The Don has a right bank steeper than the left and it curves the other way (look at a map). The Volga has (as in Volgograd ). The Dnieper has. The Danube has (as in Budapest). Siberian rivers like Ob' and Ienissei too. It's all local features? It's just because the river next to you is small. This being said, the thing of sink spirals is fake, I agree. -- <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrafikm_fr_a2d0.html" title="User:Grafikm fr">Grafikm_fr</a> 15:53, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Oh, finally found the name of the law, it's called Baer-Babinet' Law (some more info <a href="http://www.sentex.net/~tcc/gtl-trends.html" class="external text" title="http://www.sentex.net/~tcc/gtl-trends.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>) -- <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrafikm_fr_a2d0.html" title="User:Grafikm fr">Grafikm_fr</a> 16:32, 25 April 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I've looked at a map, and the <a href="../../../d/o/n/Don.html" title="Don">Don</a> actually has a <i>very</i> similar shape to the Dnieper (curves the same way), remarkably so, actually. Were you thinking about a particular small part of it that curves the other way? The particular river I was thinking about is the <a href="../../../v/i/s/Vistula.html" title="Vistula">Vistula</a>. I think this is a good example because 1) it is also on the eastern European plain 2) it is also a large river (~1000 km long and wide), and 3) it has an upper part which curves to the left (with higher banks on the left), and a lower part which largely curves to the right (with higher banks on the right). <s>The obvious explanation for the height of banks is that the river's flow tends to erode the inside of curves. This is an almost completely universal feature of riverbanks both on large and small scales. It is also responsible for <a href="../../../m/e/a/Meander.html" title="Meander">meanders</a>. I would think that this effect is many orders of magnitude stronger than the coriolis force.</s> On small scales, rivers erode the outside of curves because the water flows faster on the ouside of a curve (check out a meandering river near you), but on large scales, say a hunderd km, the valley tends to go where the underlying soil or rock is softest.
<dl>
<dd>OOps! just fixing a silly error - steep banks are on the outside of a curve. Doesn't change the argument that the coriolis force is too weak compared to other effects, though.<a href="../../../d/e/u/User%7EDeuar_eca8.html" title="User:Deuar">Deuar</a> 08:54, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I had a look at that reference at www.sentex.net, but it's not very trustworthy to say the least. For one it seems to claim that the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Lakes_2a98.html" title="Great Lakes">Great Lakes</a> and other lakes on the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_shield.html" title="Canadian shield">Canadian shield</a> were formed by sea currents. What a load of rubbish! The surface of that whole region is known to have been scoured by glacial movements during the last (and earlier) ice ages, which is what caused the depressions that became lakes. For another, it is a creationist website, so you can expect a whole pile of crazy crank theories when it comes to geology, because their underlying agenda is to actually discredit geology so they can claim that the world was recently created in 6 days by a biblical God. Excuse me while I nauseate&#160;;-p</dd>
<dd>In any case, it claims that river valleys were eroded by ocean currents caused by the uplift of land, and that these currents were deflected by the coriolis force causing e.g. south flowing rivers to curve west. Well ok the Dnieper and Don do, but what about all the rest? look at an atlas! The Volga doesn't do it, the Danube doesn't do it, the Dniester doesn't do it, ... Also, how fast would this land have to rise up to make currents that can sculpt a river valley? All out of the sea in a day, or a week. Sounds like a 6 day creation story again. That just doesn't happen. While it would be cool if riverbanks were sculpted by the coriolis force, it's just not plausible (the coriolis force is too weak compared to normal erosion), and it's not seen in practice.</dd>
<dd>I agree that the rivers you mentioned appear to show an interesting trend, but I just don't think its the coriolis force. How long is the part of the Ob and Ienissei that has a steeper right bank? Also - sure, the Danube in Budapest has a steep right bank - but that's because there is a mountain range there on the right bank! This is a completely different situation to the Dnieper. <a href="../../../d/e/u/User%7EDeuar_eca8.html" title="User:Deuar">Deuar</a> 19:09, 25 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I think we need to find a reasonable explaination for the bluffs, or perhaps just leave out an explaination for their existance. I will try to research this a bit, but I am also skeptical that Coriolis could account for it, it's just too minor a force compared to the normal erosion and deposition caused by river meander. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarcusGraly_c5aa.html" title="User:MarcusGraly">MarcusGraly</a> 19:19, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>What causes river bluffs is diffrences in the erodability of deposits, Much of Ukraine is Loess, which is a wind blown very soft fertile soil, (which is why Ukraine historically was the Bread Basket of Russia). I imagine the Dnieper bluffs are some harder formation possibly Sandstone, or limestone, I'm not sure, but as the river cut through the sorfter loess, leaving the harder bluffs exposed. This is how river bluffs are formed. see <a href="http://www.igsb.uiowa.edu/Browse/ancrchan/ancrchan.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.igsb.uiowa.edu/Browse/ancrchan/ancrchan.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> for example. For now, I am removing the coriolis link. If someone wants to reaserch fmore completely the geological history of the Dneiper Bluffs, that could be added to the article. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarcusGraly_c5aa.html" title="User:MarcusGraly">MarcusGraly</a> 19:31, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>More more thing, I know this is Military History and not Geology, but simply erosion and deposition is not going to cause bluffs by itself, it will cause meander bends and oxbow lakes ad the like, but you need more, (like the stronger rocks I mentioned,) to create bluffs. I'm not sure if there are true bluffs on the Dneiper or just a steeper bank. If it's just a steeper bank, then that could be the rsult of the curvature of the river. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarcusGraly_c5aa.html" title="User:MarcusGraly">MarcusGraly</a> 19:39, 25 April 2006 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Liberate vs. Take</span></h2>
<p>"Liberate" is loaded for sure, but so is "take." Let's find a neutral word that is accurate (I don't know enough about this to do it myself...). Perhaps "advanced to" or "moved" to the other side of the river. How about "Kiev Campaign"? Or "Battle for Kiev"?

<dd>What is wrong with "liberate"? A country liberates its own territory. We are not talking about Poland or Romania here, for instance, where this word could be discussed because of its political implications. Kiev was part of Soviet Union in 1941. -- <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrafikm_fr_a2d0.html" title="User:Grafikm fr">Grafikm_fr</a> 15:23, 26 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Agreed, ironically I think 'liberate' may be the least POV term to use. We would not hesitate to write that French forces helped to 'liberate' Paris in Aug 1944. If the Germans were the agressor (and hopefully we can all agree on that) then 'liberate' seems to be a reasonable term. If the real issue here is the nature of the Soviet regime, let's be honest about that.

<dd>The fact that Ukraine was under Soviet occupation before 1941 does not mean that it was liberated in 1944. This was reoccupation if you want to be precise. But I prefer to use neutral terms.</dd>
<dd>There is a crucial difference between Kiev and Paris. Nobody would object that Paris is a French city. Soon after the Nazis were pushed away, <b>French</b> Government took the control over the city and, the most important, people of Paris and of whole France had soon an opportunity to elect their government.</dd>
<dd>In contrast, Ukrainian city Kiev was controlled by the Soviet (in effect Russian) government untill 1991. The first free presidential elections took place in the same year.</dd>
<dd>There is no reason to speak about liberation of Kiev 1944. This was definitely a reoccupation.--<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndriyK_f787.html" title="User:AndriyK">AndriyK</a> 17:08, 26 April 2006 (UTC)

The term "liberation" is used in the Western literature to describe the Red Army advances not just in Ukraine, but even in Poland. And no one is talking about Lviv liberation in connection of '39 events. That was no a liberation in any way. '44-'45 events is a different story.

<dd>I think it is clear where you stand when you say "The Nazi occupation was bad indeed, but the Soviet one was not better" because you are dead wrong and that remark shows that you do not know what happened during the Soviet time the population of Ukraine didnt fall but I did fall during the Nazi occupation. And the Soviets only took back what belong to them. If you say "The Nazi occupation was bad indeed, but the Soviet one was not better" then it is clear that you dont know what you are talking about.

<dd>Probably the population did not fall according the official Stalin's statistics. But in fact, there were three llarge famines during the Soviet occupation: two before the WWII and one just after the liberation in 1946. Millions of people died!</dd>

<dd>I find the suggestion that just because "western" literature says something then it is correct to be laughable. Indeed, using "liberation" to refer to Red Army advances in Eastern Europe (Poland, Romania, I don't know enough about Ukraine) just shows that many western authors don't have a clue. Although sure the Soviet occupation of say Poland was much better than the Nazis'.

<dd>Initially, the Germans were received as liberators by many Ukrainians, especially in western Ukraine which had only been occupied by the Soviets in 1939. However, German rule in the occupied territories eventually aided the Soviet cause. Nazi administrators of conquered Soviet territories made little attempt to exploit the population of Ukrainian territories' dissatisfaction with Soviet political and economic policies. Instead, the Nazis preserved the collective-farm system, systematically carried out genocidal policies against Jews, and deported others (mainly Ukrainians) to work in Germany. Under these circumstances, most people living on the occupied territory passively or actively opposed the Nazis. Total civilian losses during the war and German occupation in Ukraine are estimated between five and eight million, including over half a million Jews shot and killed by the Einsatzgruppen, sometimes with the help of Ukrainian collaborators. Of the estimated eleven million Soviet troops who fell in battle against the Nazis, about a quarter (2.7 million) were ethnic Ukrainians. Ukraine is distinguished as one of the first nations to fight the Axis powers in Carpatho-Ukraine, and one that saw some of the greatest bloodshed during the war.</dd>

<p>Some good points are made here, and "liberate" may not be objectionable in most circumstances. However, there are passionate differences of opinion here, so we should aim for a correspondingly high level of NPOV. The word <i>liberate</i> is defined as, "To set free, as from oppression, confinement, or foreign control." When you liberate something, you are granting liberty and, hence, breaking shackles. Yes, the foreign control part is strictly accurate, but the other meanings give the term a strong connotation that there was relatively greater oppression prior to the action. This is a controversial implication that may be examined, but should not be allowed to sneak in the back door. <i>Take</i>, as an alternative, is far better, although I think there is a slight connotation that the actor is not the rightful owner of what is being taken (implied by the existence of its counterpart, <i>retake</i>). I still feel that purely militaristic terminology, as a precise jargon unrelated to politics, will be the least POV. Battle of Lower Dnieper, not the liberation or taking. The X army advanced to a strong point at A, the Y army retreated to entrenched positions at B. The focus of this article is a military action, let's keep it that way. - <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatrickFisher_f7c7.html" title="User:PatrickFisher">PatrickFisher</a> 03:13, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I also agree in general. But we have to look into details. I would ask native English speakers to check whether the phrase "Soviet troops advanced to the left shore of Dnieper" is correct. May be there is a more appropriate militaric term.</dd>

<p>Liberate is the most accurate term, since it was territory within the Soviet Union that had been occupied by a hostile foreign country. I don't really see why it's so contreversial, other than because polititians will often twist the meaning of that word. (Peaceful Liberation of Tibet, <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberation_of_Iraq_8829.html" title="Liberation of Iraq">Liberation of Iraq</a>, etc., etc. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarcusGraly_c5aa.html" title="User:MarcusGraly">MarcusGraly</a> 15:47, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>It is controversial because the territory under discussion was occupied by Bolshevik Russia two decades before the German occupation and a great fraction of its population did not consider the re-occupation by Soviets as a liberation. Therefore the word "liberation" is not neutral as it reflects the pro-Soviet POV.
<dl>
<dd>Ukraine had been a part of Russia for nearly 1000 years, not two decades. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarcusGraly_c5aa.html" title="User:MarcusGraly">MarcusGraly</a> 17:50, 27 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>First, please learn history before you start argueing. Russia did not even exist for 1000 year.</dd>
<dd>Second, it does not matter how long lasts the occupation. It remains an occupation if the population demonstrates the willigness to independence.</dd>
<dd>Ukraine was under Russian control prior to 1917 (as well as Finland, Poland, Baltic states, Belarus etc.). But then Bolshevik Russia ceded it (as well as Finland, Poland, Belarus, Baltic states etc) in 1918.</dd>
<dd>Ukraine and Belarus were occupied by Soviet Russia two years later.</dd>
<dd>Would not you claim that the Soviet-Finnish war of 1940 was not an agression of the Soviet Union? Was it "liberation" or "returning own territories"?</dd>
<dd>Why the saizure of Ukraine and Belarus in 1920 should be considered differently?</dd>
<dd>8 to 12 million Ukrainians died between 1920-1941. Was it not an occupation?</dd>
<dd>A new famine came in 1946,just in two years after the "liberation". Again a lot of people died.</dd>
<dd>What happened after 1943-44? Were Ukraininas allowed to elect their own goverment? Were they allowed to be the arbiters of their own destiny? In what sence was it liberation?</dd>

<dd>When the Americans took places in Western Europe it's always described as Liberation. When the Soviets take them, even within their own country (!), it's not? Read the article on <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Ukraine_0587.html" title="History of Ukraine">History of Ukraine</a>. Stalin's forced collectivazation and intustriallization programs where disasterous, that is undeniable, but this was not an attempt to supress the Ukrainian people. In fact, prior to that great effort was made to <b>promote</b> Ukrainian culture and language.</dd>
<dd>Regarding the claim about Treaty of Brest-Litovsk: The Soviet Goverment was under a very desperete situation, Germany had basically beat them militarily and the Whites were gaining strength. According to your reasoning, the French govement is also "occupying" the areas is ceeded to Germany in 1940, so it agreed to that under treaty. Unlike Poland, Finland and the Baltic States, which sought their independence, The Ukrainian Goverment that formed during the Civil War sided with the Soviets and agreed to the Union.</dd>
<dd>Your last rationalization is that Ukraine was not liberated beacause the USSR was not a democracy. In this case, nowhere in China was liberated from Japan, nor was the Philapines liberated, since it was a colony, etc. etc. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarcusGraly_c5aa.html" title="User:MarcusGraly">MarcusGraly</a> 19:52, 27 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Promoting</b> Ukrainian culture and language is not the same as self-rule. The Soviet acquisition of the territories of present-day Ukraine occured in a somewhat hostile and rather oppressive manner after Ukrainians had attempted self-rule following the collapse of the Russian Empire. I'm not stating the the Soviet Union was inherently evil, but rather that this was a case of occupation by a foreign government which then dictated commands to the Ukrainian SSR.

<dd>What about "reclaimed"? The Soviet forces "reclaimed" territory which they controlled prior to the German invasion.

<p>The whole issue about who was good and who was bad for Ukraine is off-topic here. In the context of WW2 the term always implies liberation <i>from nazi occupation</i>. A wrath of western WW2 books use this term and it is applicable without any doubt. Besides, even in modern independent Ukraine itself the term is used. The anniversary of "Vyzvolennya" (literary translation of "liberation") is celebrated by parades and various public events. But even this is only slightly related. Liberation from Nazi occupation is factually correct and is used widely.</p>
<p>Even the Britannica, which is as mainstream as one can possibly be, the term is used. From Kiev article in EB: <i>"General Nikolay Vatutin, commander of the Soviet forces that <b>liberated</b> Kiev in 1943"</i>. ALso, same article: <i>"In 1943 the advancing Soviet troops forded the Dnieper and, after bitter fighting, <b>liberated</b> Kiev on November 6."</i>.

<dd>As I already answered you. Not all wester authors care about neutrality. What they write is often based on Soviet sources hence the terminology used.</dd>
<dd>Britannica is a respectable source, but not necessarily a neutral source, because its author can be also biased as well as other western or eastern aouthors.</dd>
<dd>If Ukrainian Government consider it as liberation, it is just a POV of Ukrainian Government it is not a NPOV.</dd>
<dd>The point is that there is a significant number of people that do not consider the restoring of Soviet control over Ukraine as liberation.</dd>
<dd>OTOH, why do you consider neutral terms wrong?</dd>
<dd>What is wrong with "Soviet Army took control of Kiev"? It remained under control of Nazis or a third party?</dd>
<dd>What is wrong with "Stalin was determined to pursue Soviet Army advance"? You mean it did not advance?</dd>

<dd>The question remains whether "liberation" is inherently a POV term, regardless of how it has been used in the past. I think that a very valid case of POV can be made in this instance as the people of Ukraine had already claimed independence not 25 years prior to this particular instance of "liberation". I can see how prior to the claim of independence, an invasion of and subsequent reclaiming of territory could have been termed a "liberation". But once the native population declares sovereignty, any claim of "liberation" which does not involve self-rule promotes a POV which dismisses the history of the occupied people.</dd>
<dd>Any takers for "reclaim"?--<a href="../../../t/u/f/User%7ETufkaa_fb6c.html" title="User:Tufkaa">tufkaa</a> 19:36, 27 April 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I appreciate your attempt at comprmise, but reclaim just isn't used in this context. When someon says "reclaimed land" they usually mean land that has been decontaminated or some such. Furthermore, I'll beleive that liberation is inherently POV when I see a heated discussion on the <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberation_of_Paris_54ff.html" title="Liberation of Paris">Liberation of Paris</a> page. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarcusGraly_c5aa.html" title="User:MarcusGraly">MarcusGraly</a> 19:57, 27 April 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>You are referring to but a single meaning of the word "reclaim". If in the context of the article people assume that the Soviet Army was a team of environmental scientists, then that is the result of a poorly worded article or maybe the poor vocabulary of the reader. To reclaim: to regain possession of -- this seems a reasonable and non-POV substitute to "liberation" in this article.</dd>
<dd>The problem with the Paris analogy is that you've ignored the entire reasoning of those opposed to "liberation" on the grounds that it is POV. Once the native population declares sovereignty, any claim of "liberation" which does not involve self-rule promotes a POV which dismisses the history of the occupied people. Paris was "set free from oppression, confinement, or foreign control"; the people who populated the banks of the Dnipro were not.--<a href="../../../t/u/f/User%7ETufkaa_fb6c.html" title="User:Tufkaa">tufkaa</a> 21:14, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I object to "reclaim" or "take". Any term in the set: liberate, take, reclaim, occupy, etc. may have a POV interpretation depending on how strongly one hates/loves the Soviets (or the Nazis for that matter). As such, the <i>absolutely</i> neutral terms simply don't exist, and they can't exist, since we are dealing with history and politics rather than math and science. Historic subjects are inherently more emotional and colorful and we don't want the articles to be fully censored to the extent that they are unreadable to a non-professional historian. Besides, this is an encyclopedia, not a journal publication and should be written for the general public, not professional historians.</p>
<p>This is exactly the case where the term to use should be determined by the prevailing usage in the mainstream historiography. That other author "don't have to be neutral like us" is mere nonsense. All respected historians attempt and strive for neutrality in their writings. So is Britannica and any source that claims respectability. "Liberation from Nazi occupation" is a specific term widely used in the mainstream, and the author who writes the WP article should be allowed to use it without the fear of someone who hasn't written anything ever for Wikipedia but roams from article to article with his extreme views and inflames a bunch of edit wars until s/he gets blocked again for disruption. --<a href="../../../i/r/p/User%7EIrpen_a72e.html" title="User:Irpen">Irpen</a> 06:34, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It is clear to me that a difference exists between territories that were allowed to self-govern after the defeat of Germany, and the ones that remained under the direct governmental control of the forces which had driven out the Germans. I believe that a similar discussion surrounds the articles <a href="../../../p/o/s/Post-invasion_Iraq%2C_2003%E2%80%932006_241e.html" title="Post-invasion Iraq, 2003–2006">Post-invasion Iraq, 2003–2006</a> (not "<a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberation_of_Iraq_8829.html" title="Liberation of Iraq">Liberation of Iraq</a>") and <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003_invasion_of_Iraq_768c.html" title="2003 invasion of Iraq">2003 invasion of Iraq</a>. "Liberating" has POV connotations, and its use in previously published texts does not imply correctness in any way; there are many historical texts covering a variety of periods that contain POV language. One of the reasons that Wikipedia is a groundbreaking reference is because of its devotion to NPOV, which has significantly altered people's interpretation of past history. Point being, we are not bound by the POV of those who came before us.
<dl>
<dd>Iraq was a clear invasion since a) it is a sovereign country. b) Its borders were recognised by United Nations and other treaties. c) From the start everybody called it invasion, even the United States. Soviet Territory was Soviet at start of war. It was liberated by the Soviets. Germany on the other hand was occupied, it was even split into occupational zones. Czech republic, Poland, Yugoslavia and occupied USSR was liberated from the nazi rule. Hungary, Bulgaria, Romania were invaded. Such is the breakdown in all western WWII atlases and historical sources. --<a href="../../../k/u/b/User%7EKuban_kazak_c2e3.html" title="User:Kuban kazak">Kuban Cossack</a> <a href="../../../r/o/m/Image%7ERomanov_Flag.svg_2101.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/c/c0/Romanov_Flag.svg/25px-Romanov_Flag.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="13" longdesc="../../../r/o/m/Image%7ERomanov_Flag.svg_2101.html" /></a> 20:01, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Tufkaa, any word chosen here bears <i>some</i> POV flavor. <i>Reclaim</i>, same as <i>claim</i>, implies the legitimacy is not unquestionable.

<p>The issue here is that each and every word has a POV flavor. The only solution is to use what the respected scholars use. They do use "liberate" in the context of kicking Nazis out.

<p>Halibutt, you are dead wrong here that the <i>respected</i> scholars don't write encyclopedias and that don't have to write neutrally. A politician doesn't have to be neutral, the scholar does if he has any respectability claim. Britannica and Columbia certainly have a NPOV policy. Here is the statement from the EB's web-site: "Britannica provides neutral, unbiased perspectives on issues and conflicts." Even those article in EB which are "signed" are all written by respected researchers in the field from the world's top universities. So, pls no BS that a researcher who writes in his professional field doesn't have to be neutral. He not always is but he always tries to, at list he should. If you are saying that you, as an author, are more neutral than Britannica this would be a Wikipedia joke of the day. --<a href="../../../i/r/p/User%7EIrpen_a72e.html" title="User:Irpen">Irpen</a> 20:58, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>"Liberation" has been recognized by others on Wikipedia to be POV, and is considered still by others to be patently offensive. Why then encourage the use of such a word? To use a term such as "reclaim" is by no means original research; if anything, consider it a broadening of our collective vocbulary (i.e., it's been used plenty to describe geopolitical and military developments). And frankly, because a term such as "reclaim" <i>implies the legitimacy is not unquestionable</i>, that is precisely why it is more agreeable to a broader public (although I also question the use of the word "legitimacy" in such a context; perhaps "right of rule"). I do not read anything perjorative or lauditory behind a statement such as:
<dl>
<dd><i>During this four-month campaign, Soviet troops reclaimed the left shore of the Dnieper, crossed it in force, created several bridgeheads on the right shore, and reclaimed Kiev as well.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>In fact, the alternate meanings of the word (<i>bring, lead, or force to abandon a wrong or evil course of life...make useful again; transform from a useless or uncultivated state</i>) actually could lend someone to interpret the aforementioned statement with a positive connotation. However, this way, we stay clear of "liberation" which is frankly too politically volatile.
<dl>
<dd>Volatile for whom? For you? If the <b>official term</b> that the Ukrainian governemnt endorses which mounts quite a landslide against your suggestion. Reclaimed is most of all vague. I would use that term in a battle article when a city changes hands several times (like in the battles of Kharkov), but not when its liberated for good.

<dd>It seems there are views represented on this page: a side for keeping "liberation", and a side which advocates for a change agreeable to more parties.

<p>Tufkaa, the problem, as I said earlier, is that almost every term has a POV flavor. We may come up with a word that doesn't and I agree to <i>also</i> use it. It would be plain stupid to use "liberation" all the time throughout the article. We may use "advanced into", "drove out" and even disliked by me "took" at times. But I want that "liberation" be allowed to use <i>along</i> with other words to the editors. This is my offer of compromise: Liberation can be used for the events of driving out Nazis but not uniformly throughout the text, but as one of several variants. And "occupation" should not be even in the picture for 43-45. It is fine to use occupation in certain context though, for '39. How about that? --<a href="../../../i/r/p/User%7EIrpen_a72e.html" title="User:Irpen">Irpen</a> 22:07, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think there have been a few misinterpretations. In my prior comment I was asking if everyone agreed that the term "liberation" is problematic on its own, not erasing the history of the Soviet Union with my use of the word irrespective (as in the use of "liberation" in a context not having anything to do with the current article). My purpose here is not to belittle the Soviet Union. Quite the contrary, I am trying to eliminate unnecessary phrasings which serve only to stoke opinionated vandalism and revert wars, and I think the best way is to find a reasonable alternative. There are Ukrainian references citing this period as a period of conquest by the Soviets. Neither I, nor those above who find "liberation" questionable are at present advocating for "occupation" or similar term to be inserted into this article. Rather, an alternative is being sought to the term "liberation" which does not imply that freedom was gained by the inhabitants of the area.</p>
<p>How about using other words throughout, and leaving "liberation" in a historical explanatory note (eg. <i>This battle has been historically referred to as a liberation, however later developments in the area did not result in society free from foreign domination</i>; I'm sorry that is very poorly worded, but a tactful version of that would be my intent.)?</p>
<p>Also, the revulsion to "take", as brought up by Mbuk below, is exactly the reaction that many have to "liberation" and yet it is still advocated. How is "liberation" less problematic than "take"?--<a href="../../../t/u/f/User%7ETufkaa_fb6c.html" title="User:Tufkaa">tufkaa</a> 23:53, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>In this type of case (<i>general descriptive term/phrase</i>, in the body of an article), I believe that consensus and NPOV <i>should</i> trump scholarly usage.

<p>Are you saying that WP is <i>more neutral</i> than the combined authority of Britannica, Columbia and <i>all</i> the major WW2 history books? And don't get me wrong, I also see no problem in using other terms as well. For purely styllistac reasons having the article full of liberation looks bad. But I am against an automatic censorship of this word, especially by users who do nothing on Wikipedia but roam into article to send them to havoc and leave. --<a href="../../../i/r/p/User%7EIrpen_a72e.html" title="User:Irpen">Irpen</a> 00:44, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I guess it depends on how you interpret the policies and guidelines. I believe that for this sort of thing, <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, and <a href="../../../c/o/n/WP%7EConsensus_8a50.html" title="WP:Consensus">WP:Consensus</a> <s>should</s> <u>do</u> work <a href="../../../s/y/n/Synergistic.html" title="Synergistic">synergistically</a>. I believe that WP <i>can</i> be more neutral than Britannica et al when this works. Traditional encyclopedia editors <i>generally</i> strive for neutrality, but they are not following <i>Wikipedia'</i>s NPOV policy. In this type of case, the traditional editor may simply be apt to follow (for instance) a convention such as <i>liberated</i>. They do not necessarily engage in debate with a pool of other editors to determine a more neutral term. The change is fine as long as it does not reduce the article's verifiability, or substantially alter the meaning of the larger article. I realize that in some cases it may be impossible to bridge people's subjective understandings of certain words and reach consensus. <sub>someone shot me, I'm wikiphilosophizing...</sub> <a href="../../../h/e/q/User%7EHeqs_0c2c.html" title="User:Heqs">heqs</a> 01:45, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>After reading almost all of the above I still don't get why "take" is not a neutral word? I think it's an appropriate and neutral word and it should be used. In particular, in the first paragraph the verb "liberate" is used twice, which as far as I understand is bad syntax. Instead of repeating "liberation" twice, once we can say "liberation", and the other time "take". It would not hurt to say "liberation from Nazi" at least once to close all the questions (as <a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPiotrus_27db.html" title="User:Piotrus">User:Piotrus</a> proposed). <a href="../../../k/p/b/User%7EKPbIC_c488.html" title="User:KPbIC">KPbIC</a> 04:21, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h4><span class="mw-headline">Please read <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a></span></h4>
<p>I suggest everybody partiocipating in this discussion to read <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> and answer yourself the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Should WP represent the POV of Ukrainian (or any else) Government?</li>
<li>Should WP represent only the POV of majority?</li>
<li>Should it represent exclusively the mainstream POV?</li>
<li>Should it represent the POV of autors of Britannica or any other encyclopaedia?</li>
</ul>
<p>You will find that the answer to the all questions is NO. Therefore, all the arguments about "mainstream", what is recognized by Ukrainian Government and what is suspported by majority in the West are irrelevant.</p>
<p>The purpose of WP is to represent <b>neutral</b> POV, i.e. the point of view that <i>"neither sympathetic nor in opposition to its subject."</i></p>
<ul>
<li>If one says "The Soviet Army <i>liberated</i> some territory" then one expresses one's sympathetic view about the Soviet Army and the kind of administration that was (re)established after the "liberation".</li>
<li>If one says "The Soviet Army <i>occupied</i> some territory" then one represent one's opposition to the Soviet army and the Communist regime</li>
</ul>
<p>Then both versions are not neutral even if the former one has more supporters.</p>
<p>I read Irpen's comment below aboud the negatrive flavor of the word "take" in English. It would be, however, nice to see a comment of a native English speaker.</p>
<p>In any case, nobody objected so far against "advance" or "enter". Why not <i>"Soviet Army advance to occupied territories"</i> and <i>"Soviet Army entered Kiev."</i>?--<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndriyK_f787.html" title="User:AndriyK">AndriyK</a> 11:41, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><i>You will find that the answer to the all questions is NO.</i> No individually, but when ALL of the above use the same term that is quite a landslide.</li>
<li><i>If one says "The Soviet Army 'liberated' some territory" then one expresses one's sympathetic view about the Soviet Army and the kind of administration that was (re)established after the "liberation".</i> That is not sympathetic, that is the way it took place. And it was not the Soviet but the Red Army and the administration was exiled whilst their capital was occupuied.

<li><i>If one does not have serious arguments, one switches to personal attacs.

In that case if Official Kiev uses liberation, if majority of Ukrainians (again minus the Galicians) fought for their country in the ranks of the Red Army from soldiers to marshals then I take it the term applies universally to ALL Ukraine, from Volhynia to Sloboda, from Galicia to Donbass, from Podolia to Tavria. Ukrainian lands that were liberated by Ukrainians in 1943-44. That is a fact with one ommission that it was not only Ukrainians that fought in the Red Army, but they sure made up a sizable chunk of it.

<h4><span class="mw-headline">Mediation</span></h4>
<p>Mediation makes sence if the involved parties recognise that there is a POV problem and would like to use assistence of a mediator to solve it and build a consensus. So far one of the parties pretended that there is no problem and was removing the tag. Before I request the mediation I would like to see whether there are people in the opposite party who is ready to participate in the mediation procedure and build a consensus.

<p>This song was popular among Soviet soldiers in the end of the war. It uses Russian word "взяли" (wich means "took") with respect to Orel, Bryansk, Minsk, Lublin and Warsaw. So at least in Russian this word has no negative meaning with respect to Soviet soldiers that <i>took</i> the cities from Germans. Is it different in English?--<a href="../../../m/b/u/User%7EMbuk_9301.html" title="User:Mbuk">Mbuk</a> 22:56, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Once again, the soldiers clearely say that with <i>battles we took</i>, i.e. in combat details they did take the city, but in the larger scope of the war they liberated them. --<a href="../../../k/u/b/User%7EKuban_kazak_c2e3.html" title="User:Kuban kazak">Kuban Cossack</a> <a href="../../../r/o/m/Image%7ERomanov_Flag.svg_2101.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/c/c0/Romanov_Flag.svg/25px-Romanov_Flag.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="13" longdesc="../../../r/o/m/Image%7ERomanov_Flag.svg_2101.html" /></a> 22:59, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I do not object against liberation. I just wanted to ask whether the wodr 'take' is as neutral in English as in Russian. I read the discussion and saw some people objecting agains using the word 'take'. Maybe in English it has different flavor?--<a href="../../../m/b/u/User%7EMbuk_9301.html" title="User:Mbuk">Mbuk</a> 23:18, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Mbuk, yes, the word Taking has a different flavor. For example in the US law "taking" of property (by the state) applies to the cases when the state (or the Federal gov) takes posession of, say, land, belonging to the private owner with the latter having no right to refuse. Note that "taking" rather than "confiscation" is used. There are laws and laws that elaborate on what the "just" compensation should be and that the taking should be for a clear public benefit (like to make it a wild-life refuge or smth). In the combat detail taking is fine to use, in the overall estimate, liberation is appropriate. Again, I don't argue for exclusive use of this word. However, I oppose to the article-wide trollish purging and replacing like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Battle_of_the_Lower_Dnieper&amp;diff=50229982&amp;oldid=50228507" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Battle_of_the_Lower_Dnieper&amp;diff=50229982&amp;oldid=50228507" rel="nofollow">this</a>, especially by the editor whose main contribution to Wikipedia is running edit wars. --<a href="../../../i/r/p/User%7EIrpen_a72e.html" title="User:Irpen">Irpen</a> 23:21, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>To all: It took me a whole lot of time to put the initial version of that article together, time that is even more precious because I already have a lot of work in real life. Nevertheless, I wish to contribute to Wikipedia on several subjects including this one, because whether one wants it or not, WW2 is among the greatest pages of human history.</p>
<p>Consequently, the sight of some POV-pushers letting such a work go to waste hurts me. A lot. I am far from being a Russian patriot and I do not even live in Russia, but what was done there must be remembered. Modern history revision to suit ambitions of some politicians, be they in Kiev, Moscow or Upper Volta, is a dangerous game that should be avoided at all costs, especially on a site like Wikipedia. -- <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrafikm_fr_a2d0.html" title="User:Grafikm fr"><font color="blue"><b>Grafikm_fr</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGrafikm_fr_126e.html" title="User talk:Grafikm fr"><b><font color="red">(AutoGRAF)</font></b></a></sup> 22:50, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I fully respect your work and I think factually it is an excellent article. However I could not agree more on you what you say about the politics. This article was vandalised by a person who has been previously blocked by arbcom, by doing so he terrorised a bee hive, which despite, as always, after the original troll was shoowed away, the bees are still stinging. The article is neutral already. All it might need is clarification as proposed by Piotrus and Heqs, but that is minor detail that is irrespective of the overall stance on the word liberation. Also this is rather personal to me, my wife is Volhynian (btw from Rivne, ie the part that was annexed from Poland in 39) and ALL her family fought against the fascist occupiers in partisans and on the fronts and if anyone asks if there is an alternative to the word liberation when the Red Army entered Rivne and were recieved by thousands of locals in joy, you are going to have to put up with some very angry Ukrainians. --<a href="../../../k/u/b/User%7EKuban_kazak_c2e3.html" title="User:Kuban kazak">Kuban Cossack</a> <a href="../../../r/o/m/Image%7ERomanov_Flag.svg_2101.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/c/c0/Romanov_Flag.svg/25px-Romanov_Flag.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="13" longdesc="../../../r/o/m/Image%7ERomanov_Flag.svg_2101.html" /></a> 23:23, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't object strongly to <i>liberate</i>, as it is in common usage. I support using the word liberate, unlocking the page, and treating any further POV edits as vandalism. <i>A note to KK about</i> reclaim <i>and</i> reacquire<i>: While they are very similar, reacquire carries a connotation that the subject was previously acquired, but reclaim does not necessarily imply that. It's subtle distinction and hard to explain, but that's what they mean to me, a native speaker; I think these connotations come from the various contexts in which the words are typically used.</i> <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatrickFisher_f7c7.html" title="User:PatrickFisher">PatrickFisher</a> 05:01, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

Start with John Erickson read all of his books and then move on to David Glantz and you will learn even more. I must stress that just because you havent heard about a thing does not mean it doens not exsist.

<dd>Naming an article about a battle with a name other than the one used in sources is original research as far as I can tell. Please don't try to assert conditions on your article (<a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">WP:OWN</a>). The wikiproject doesn't own the article either. Unless there are actual citations for the current name of the article I see no reason why it shouldn't be moved right away(?). I'm not suggesting that I'm going to do anything without consensus either, btw. Please don't be defensive, and I am sorry if I've offended you or anyone with my comments. <a href="../../../h/e/q/User%7EHeqs_0c2c.html" title="User:Heqs">heqs</a> 18:53, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I did <b>not</b> name it. It was a link to a non-existing article present in many places (requested pages, milhist requested articles and so on). I clicked on the link, edited the document and saved it. Basically that's it. So the naming of the page is not mine and yes, it should perhaps be moved to <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Dnieper_db90.html" title="Battle of Dnieper">Battle of Dnieper</a>. However, I would like the decision of moving the page to be taken as a separate matter, possibly as a discussion on MilHist portal. Oh, and I do not assert conditions, I merely do not want to move the article until its "twins" are completed and/or until an appropriate and separate discussion takes place on the subject&#160;:) -- <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrafikm_fr_a2d0.html" title="User:Grafikm fr"><font color="blue"><b>Grafikm_fr</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGrafikm_fr_126e.html" title="User talk:Grafikm fr"><b><font color="red">(AutoGRAF)</font></b></a></sup> 20:21, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>And why you havent heard more about it is probably that cold war mentality view of the war in the east derives from the German experiences of 1941 and 1942, when blitzkrieg exploited the benefits of surprise against a desperate and crudely fashioned Soviet defense. It is the view of a Guderian, a Mellenthin, a Balck, and a Manstein, all heroes of Western military history, but heroes whose operational and tactical successes partially blinded them to strategic realities. By 1943-44, their "glorious" experiences had ceased. As their operational feats dried up after 1942, the Germans had to settle for tactical victories set against a background of strategic disasters. Yet the views of the 1941 conquerors, their early impressions generalized to characterize the nature of the entire war in the east, remain the accepted views. The successors to these men, the Schoeners, the Heinricis, the defenders of 1944 and 1945, those who presided over impending disaster, wrote no memoirs of widespread notoriety, for their experiences were neither memorable nor glorious. Their impressions and those of countless field grade officers who faced the realities of 1944-45 are all but lost. And why it isnt in the eastern front article is simple; because I am lazy but there is a link below the head line if you look to what you ctrl c ctrl v you will see that just below the head line there is a link here&#160;;).

<p>Inventing terms is indeed OR, but this is just a descriptive title. It is OK to have IMO. See, for instance, <a href="../../../p/r/u/Prussian_Holocaust_b9c4.html" title="Prussian Holocaust">Prussian Holocaust</a> vs <a href="../../../e/v/a/Evacuation_of_East_Prussia_813e.html" title="Evacuation of East Prussia">Evacuation of East Prussia</a>. The formes is an invented term and is a <i>term article</i>. The latter is an account of the events under the descriptive title. The author of our article here didn't invent any code-names. He simply put the title that describes what the article is about. The suggestion "It should be... , <b>or deleted</b>" over the title looks bizarre. --<a href="../../../i/r/p/User%7EIrpen_a72e.html" title="User:Irpen">Irpen</a> 19:28, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'm not suggesting a deletion at this time. This all started from the misunderstanding caused by naming a battle with a name other than the historical, sourced name. I'd never heard of "Battle of the Lower Dnieper" and couldn't find any references to it that did not originate from Wikipedia. Descriptive titles about more general topics are much more verifiable. I assert that any article about an actual documented battle should use the documented name; I do not think descriptive titles are appropriate for this category of article. <a href="../../../h/e/q/User%7EHeqs_0c2c.html" title="User:Heqs">heqs</a> 20:16, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Descriptive titles are prefectly fine <i>if</i> there is no historically agreed on name (which tends to be the case for a surprisingly large number of battles). In this case, I'm not sure whether it's more appropriate to have this at <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_the_Lower_Dnieper_e688.html" title="Battle of the Lower Dnieper">Battle of the Lower Dnieper</a> or combined with the other operations at <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_the_Dnieper_a117.html" title="Battle of the Dnieper">Battle of the Dnieper</a>; but it certainly should <i>not</i> be at "Battle <b>for</b> the Dnieper", as that's just an artifact of inexact translation from the Russian name (English uses "Battle of Foo" quite consistently where Russian would use "Battle for Foo" or "Fooish Battle"). <a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirill_Lokshin_7618.html" title="User:Kirill Lokshin">Kirill Lok</a><font color="green">s</font><font color="#960018">h</font><a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirill_Lokshin_7618.html" title="User:Kirill Lokshin">in</a> 22:34, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As far as renaming the article, I'm no expert on WWII; how much additional material would need to be merged here if we were to turn this into a unified <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_the_Dnieper_a117.html" title="Battle of the Dnieper">Battle of the Dnieper</a> article? Do we even have existing articles on the other portions of the battle, or could we just add redirects from the other titles and go from there? <a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirill_Lokshin_7618.html" title="User:Kirill Lokshin">Kirill Lok</a><font color="green">s</font><font color="#960018">h</font><a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirill_Lokshin_7618.html" title="User:Kirill Lokshin">in</a> 00:50, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Are the German crossings of the Dnieper in 1941 (see for instance <a href="../../../e/a/s/Eastern_Front_%28World_War_II%29_e4c6.html#Moscow_and_Rostov:_Autumn_1941" title="Eastern Front (World War II)">Eastern_Front_(World_War_II)#Moscow_and_Rostov:_Autumn_1941</a>) ever considered some sort of "battle"? <a href="../../../h/e/q/User%7EHeqs_0c2c.html" title="User:Heqs">heqs</a> 01:07, 2 May 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>No, and for a good reason: because German encircled and captured several armies first at Minsk and then at Kiev, reducing Russian defenses to a shadow of their former selves. This allowed them to cross the Dnieper at ease. And yes, German troops were a bit better prepared too.</dd>
