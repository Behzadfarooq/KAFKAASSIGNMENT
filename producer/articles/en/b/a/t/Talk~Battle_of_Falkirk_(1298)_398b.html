<p>Is there any reference to Edward I being referred to as "Longshanks" outside of the movie <i>Braveheart</i>? If not, this might be construed as a bit POV given the depiction of Edward in the film.D J L 20:27, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Many medieval monarchs were awarded nicknames, most often by the monkish chroniclers who recorded the details of their lives, usually reflecting some aspect of their character, appearance or circumstances. For example, King John, Edward's grandfather, was called 'Lackland' because he initially missed out in Henry II's distribution of the family estates ( he subsequently became Lord of Ireland, but the nickname persevered). Likewise, Edward was informally called 'Longshanks' because he was unusually tall. The nickname would never have been used in the way it is in <i>Braveheart</i>, and there is absolutely no evidence that he was ever referred to in this way by the Scots.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>I've now had a chance to digest this article properly, and I'm sorry to say that the battle of Falkirk has been viewed through the awful prism of <i>Braveheart</i>, as the above user has obviously guessed.</p>
<p>First and foremost, all reference to 'Longshanks'has been removed because it is indeed inaccurate and improper to refer to Edward in this way in any serious piece of historical writing.</p>
<p>Second, Edward's army was not 'reluctant' to face the Scots in battle, which meant a definite outcome to the campaign. The army had been close to collapse before the battle because it was hungry and because the enemy could not be found. Although the Welsh had indeed been mutinous before Falkirk, they went on to make a vital contribution to Edward's victory. I would be interested to know the names of the 'several historical sources' that are alleged to claim the contrary.</p>
<p>Third, the Scottish cavalry could not remain on the field because it was both lightly armed and lighly mounted. Imagine, if you will, a juggernaut bearing down on a mini car, and this might convey some idea of the English knight and the Scottish light horse. Scotland, at this time, did not have the capacity to breed-and feed-the kind of heavy horses used by armoured knights throughout Europe. Moreover, Scottish knights could not afford to equip themselves with the same kind of armour and weapons used by the English. If they had made a stand at Falkirk they would have been cut to pieces. Sir Robert Kieth's horsemen did indeed make a contribution to the Scottish victory at Bannockburn; but they never had to face the English knights, tied up in Bruce's schiltrons. They were most effectively used against Edward II's archers, thus preventing them carrying out the same devastating work they had at Falkirk.</p>
<p>I hate to be critical about other people's work, but to be frank this is a <i>very poor</i> account of the battle of Falkirk, which seems to draw its chief inspiration from <i>Braveheart</i>. The analysis of the cavalry battle verges on the ridiculous. My editing has eliminated the worst errors, but I believe this whole piece requires substantial rewriting. Might I suggest that articles of this kind are written in future by people who have a working knowledge of the elements of medieval warfare.</p>

<p>PS I note that the necessary changes I made have been edited out, with a reversion to the highly innacurate previous version. I have changed this back in accordance with the above observations; but this is the last time I will do so. I am not playing ping pong with this. <a href="../../../r/c/p/User%7ERcpaterson_27d2.html" title="User:Rcpaterson">Rcpaterson</a> 07:34, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I've now substantially rewritten this piece to give a fuller account both of the fighting at Falkirk, its historical significance as a battle, and -most important of all-the crucial command role played by Edward I. No mention is made of the movie referred to above because it has no place in any serious historical analysis. <a href="../../../r/c/p/User%7ERcpaterson_27d2.html" title="User:Rcpaterson">Rcpaterson</a> 03:02, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Given that Edward was later forced to retreat could this be considered an english pyrrhic victory? <a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDermo69_01dc.html" title="User:Dermo69">Dermo69</a> 12:32, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
