<p>Wikipedia isn't the forum for an Earth 2 debate, but I wanted to at least touch on this issue because it's relevant to the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Batwoman.html" title="Batwoman">Batwoman</a> page.</p>
<p>In his check-in comment, Timrollpickering wrote:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>I don't think it was explicitly stated whether there was a Bat-Girl on Earth 2 - there is deep ambiguity about which world the early 1960s stories took place on....</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>This ambiguity is due to the fact that 1961-64 was the era of silly sci-fi Batman stories, and it's weird to think that these were the <i>earliest</i> adventures of the Earth 1 Batman. But they certainly weren't adventures of the retired Earth 2 Batman. The easiest solution is that with respect to "official" DC Continuity in the pre-Crisis era, most of these stories simply didn't happen.</p>
<p>But it is not possible to simply take the pre-May 1964 Batman and remove him from Earth 1 entirely. The early Justice League stories are <i>certainly</i> on Earth 1, and Batman was in his old costume during these stories. In fact, Kathy Kane even appears in JLA # 7 (11/61).</p>
<p>Bat-Girl's first appearance was Batman # 139 (4/61), and her revival in the 1970's clearly presumes the old stories are on Earth 1. If there had been an Earth 2 Bat-Girl in 1961, she would have had to flirt with an adult Robin after Batman had already retired. This makes no sense. <a href="../../../l/a/w/User%7ELawrence_King_e04f.html" title="User:Lawrence King">Lawrence King</a> 12 Mar 2005</p>

<dd>This is actually quite a common problem for a lot of DC reboots. In particular the point at which the changeover comes wanders all over the place - for example the Superman of Earth 2 had the Kryptonian name "Kal-L", worked under George Taylor (I think) for the <i>Daily Star</i> and fought a Lew Luthor who had a full head of hair. Yet "Kal-El", Perry Wright, the <i>Daily Planet</i> and bald Luthor were all introduced in the 1940s or early 1950s. Similarly in the post Crisis years numerous problems emerged as pre Crisis heroes wandered around - try explaining Hawkman or Legion of Superheroes Continuity for instance!</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I think we would be getting into the problem of retroactive continuity on this one. It's true that the Batman in the early JLA stories does resemble the one who is later identified as Earth 2, but equally quite a few other Bat characters get major revisions from 1964 onwards, with the earlier versions clearly delineated as Earth 2. So really it comes down to what point of thinking we come to. Does anyone know what the early Who's Whos say on this? <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimrollpickering_f409.html" title="User:Timrollpickering">Timrollpickering</a> 10:31, 12 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>When the Flash launched the E1/E2 crossovers in 1961, it was easy: Flash-2 ran from 1940 to 1949, and Flash-1 began in 1956, and thus anything since 1956 was new-Flash. But once this got going, the writers decided to go back to any traits that <i>distinguished</i> Earth 2 heroes from their counterparts. So you got "Kal-L" and such, but you also got Hawkman wearing the flat mask, which actually only began in the <i>late</i> 1940's, because even though it wasn't his first mask it made him look different than the E1 Hawkman.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The early Who's Whos (and DC Answer Man, etc.) eventually ended up making inconsistent claims. On the one hand, in the 1970's <i><a href="../../../a/l/l/All-Star_Comics_dd72.html" title="All-Star Comics">All-Star Comics</a></i> we saw that the E2 Superman actually couldn't fly, which would mean every story past 1941 was not on E2. On the other hand, in his <i>DC Answer Man</i> column for May 1979 (e.g., Batman # 311), Bob Rozakis answers as follows:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i><b>Q.</b> Could you tell me when the Earth-1 Superman, Batman and Flash took over from their Earth-2 counterparts in SUPERMAN, ACTION, BATMAN, DETECTIVE, and FLASH?</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i><b>A.</b> FLASH is easiest, since it was FLASH # 105 when the new Scarlet Speedster got his own magazine. For Batman it is generally assumed to be BATMAN # 164 and DETECTIVE # 327, the issues Julie Schwartz took over. As for the Man of Steel, I don't think it's ever been officially decided (though I seem to remember somebody saying once that SUPERMAN # 127 was the last Earth-2 adventure). In ACTION, it would have to be before # 252, when Supergirl first appeared.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>This was well before the first "Who's Who"s were published. If Rozakis is right, this means E1 Flash began in 10/1956, and E1 Superman began after 2/1959 and no later than 5/1959, and of course the JLA began in 3/1960. But the E1 Batman began 5/1964, after he had been in the JLA for four years? I think this is implausible.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>A much better theory would be that the Batman stories from the late 1950's until 1964 simply never happened. That would have been defensible until the late 1970's, when suddenly all the characters that Julie Schwartz had dropped -- Kathy Kane, Betty Kane, Vicki Vale, Bat-Mite -- were revived and Batman clearly remembered knowing them long ago (on Earth 1, of course). <a href="../../../l/a/w/User%7ELawrence_King_e04f.html" title="User:Lawrence King">Lawrence King</a> 12:22, 12 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hmm - we truly have a Hawkman style situation on us! I think it wasn't until later that it was established the Earth 2 Batman retired in the 1950s (and of course time is rather flexible in a comics universe). There is clearly quite a bit of rewriting of the history of the Earth 2 characters to undo changes that were carried forward to Earth 1 - could the late 1950s/early 1960s stories not be seen as part of this? The real problem is that in the early 1960s no-one was bothering to think all this through. We also have the problem that if 1964 isn't the start of the Earth 1 Batman then just when is? (And this has major ramifications for the continuity of a lot of Bat characters.) I can accept the "there were versions of the supporting characters on both worlds" line easily - and in the case of Batwoman this is clearly established in the "Interlude on Earth 2" story. There are quite a number of inconsistencies, with changes being rather ignored in places, but I guess we'd have to do a Hawkman and just fudge the point about who was in the JLA in those early years - maybe Batman in a different costume?</dd>

<p>Regarding mention of her post-<i>Crisis</i>: there's a panel in the <i>Planet Krypton</i> issue of <i>The Kingdom</i> that has Batman seeing her "ghost" in the restaurant and saying "Kathy ...?" I'm not sure if this story is considered in-continuity, though.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>To make things even more fun, Batwoman appears in an early post-Crisis story (Batman: Killing Joke). She apears in a photograph, along with Bat-Girl (Betty rather than Barbara), Bat-Mite, Batman and Robin. Those appearances most likely don't stand in current continuity, or they may have been washed away by Hypertime, but they are worth mentioning.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>That's not that unusual - a lot of comics contain the odd wink to the audience with a panel or two showing someone who couldn't possibly be there. A number of Marvel comics feature their own writers, artists and editors interacting with the characters at time and there are a number of odd panels hat drop blatent hints a DC character is there.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>On the costume point I've also just been reminded that there are a few times when both the Silver Age and Post Crisis Batmans were shown with plain black symbols on their chest. In "Earth - Without a Justice League!" (Justice League of America #37) Johnny Thuner's Thunderbolt goes back in time to prevent the superheroes from emerging and encounters Batman on his first case - drawn exactly as he was in Detective #27, even though the present day Batman is shown with the yellow oval (and this story features a team-up between the Earth 1 and Earth 2 characters). Similarly in Batman: Year One he has no oval. So I'd guess that we chalk the early JLA appearances down to Batman not having yet changed the costume, rather than any complicated inter-Earth stuff. Indeed in the very first JLA/JSA team-up the Earth 1 Batman wore what became identified as the Earth 2 costume. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimrollpickering_f409.html" title="User:Timrollpickering">Timrollpickering</a> 11:22, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Yes, what I added to keep the article neutral, actually makes the whole point kinda moot. --<a href="../../../t/-/m/User%7ET-man%2C_the_Wise_Scarecrow_5b0f.html" title="User:T-man, the Wise Scarecrow">T-man, the worst "vandal" ever</a> 07:10, 22 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>There seems to be a lot of disagreement on what belongs in the article regarding the new Batwoman's costume. See <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a> for the reasons why POSSIBLE influences are not appropriate. If you can cite a reference that indicates the creators modelled it after one thing or another, then by all means include it. Otherwise, it's just speculation. <a href="../../../c/o/v/User%7ECovenantD_b5a4.html" title="User:CovenantD">CovenantD</a> 13:55, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>So you can't note similarites in costumes? This is news to me, since may superhero articles say that a character is modeled after their cartoon counterpart, or a hero's costume is very similar to another hero and I never saw any citations or any arguments against them. I do agree about the Batman Beyond and other stuff. I am just a little confused about the thrillkiller reference being speculation. The suits are virtually identical (except TK Batgirl had a bare midriff and no cape). So if you could explain this to me, I would appreciate this, so I can try to better follow the Wiki-rules. <a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECoronis_4e90.html" title="User:Coronis">Coronis</a> 14:10, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The problem is that we don't know what influenced the creators of the version seen in <i>Infinite Crisis</i> #7. I'd love to know what they based it on, but until they speak up it's mere fan speculation. I'd settle for noting similarities without trying to say what influenced it, although because of the basic "Bat" design there's inherent similarities to a LOT of different costumes and they all should be included. That makes it very large. <a href="../../../c/o/v/User%7ECovenantD_b5a4.html" title="User:CovenantD">CovenantD</a> 14:29, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Alternate reality Helena Wayne A Batwoman, apparently a female version of Batman from an alternate Earth, appeared in Superman/Batman #24 (November 2005). Batman recognises her as "Helena", implying that she is her reality's version of the Huntress from the main DC continuity. Although she recognises Batman as "Bruce", it can be assumed that in her reality, Bruce Wayne never became Batman, but circumstances led to Helena taking on the role instead. In her reality, her closest ally is Superwoman.</p>
<p><br />
while Batman identifies her as helena it is stated they have the same dna which would make her the Female equivilant of Bruce wayne.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It's a ridiculous story, which won't affect continuity otherwise, so it doesn't merit a lot of detail. And the DNA thing is utter nonsense. <a href="../../../w/r/y/User%7EWryspy_d7ae.html" title="User:Wryspy">Wryspy</a> 08:40, 3 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

"A <b>Lycan</b> is a person who has the ability to undergo transformation into a wolf (Lycanthropy), or in more modern uses of the word into <i><b>any animal form</b></i>." That last part is bold-italic for your viewing pleasure. Point is, "Lycan" acts as a general term for a human who becomes an animal. (literally.) Now, of course, we don't much else, but the terminology is correct.

<ul>
<li>The proper term is and always has been <b>werewolf</b>, “Lycan” has been used as slang for werewolves by some and as a name for <i>factions</i> of werewolves by others, but the word lycan simply means wolf and is a misnomer when applied to werewolves. I know it’s nick-picking and all but since this is an encyclopedia then least we all could do is get it right. Anyways its: “A <b>Werewolf</b> is a person who has the ability to undergo transformation into a wolf (Lycanthropy), <b>Werebeast</b> is a collective term for people with the ability to shape-shift into creatures other then a wolf; examples: werecat, wererat, werebat . . . etc etc.” Therefore the correct terminology (and general term for that matter) is werewolf not, not lycan. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Matrix_Prime_8105.html" title="User:The Matrix Prime">The Matrix Prime</a> 04:43, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Ahem. Real point: I never misused the word. You guys complained that the article I linked to didn't have enough sources, but I used the correct term.

<dd>The point (from my end) was never if you used the word correctly, but what it was they fought. Look at it this way, if you <i>only</i> used 52 as your source for the fight, a big as monster thing attacked them. Never in 52 do you see the transformation (or if you do, point to me where, cause I re-read it and we see the B&amp;E and then 'Oh look, there's a wolfy thing bearing down on Renee and Question'). As I've repeatedly said, the <b>comic book issue, #11</b> does not state clearly, if at all, that they're shifters, so how were we to know unless we've known about Whisper, which I didn't since I blocked her out of my memory.&#160;;) Re-reading the page history, however, I agree with <b>CovenantD</b>.

<p>And from that article: "The most commonly known form is lycanthropy (from the Greek words lycos ("wolf") and anthropos ("man")), the technical term for the transformation from man to animal form. Although the precise definition of lycanthropy specifically refers only to the change into wolf form (as with a werewolf), the term is often used to refer to shape changing to any non-human animal form."<br />
Therianthrope would be the precise term then, <b>not</b> lycan, as there were multiple types of creatures (and yeah, that term includes Whisper, who is a SnakeShifter). Lycan = wolf, and while it can be used, it implies werewolf. -- <font color="green"><b><a href="../../../i/p/s/User%7EIpstenu_5894.html" title="User:Ipstenu">Ipstenu</a></b> <i>(<a href="../../../i/p/s/User_talk%7EIpstenu_7a4a.html" title="User talk:Ipstenu">talk</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ipstenu_a5b5.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ipstenu">contribs</a>)</i></font> 20:27, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I already figured out everything you just said. That's my point. "Mutant animals" was never even close.

<dd>I admit, "Lycan" might not have been the best term, but I mentioned a better one, then had to mention it again and deal with a reply which, frankly, stated the obvious. "Mutant animals" is unusable for the following reasons:</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Refers to <a href="../../../a/n/i/Animals.html" title="Animals">animals</a> rather than Humans. We're all animals, but you know what I mean. The focus is on the animal aspect, ignoring that they are humans who transform.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>"Mutant" implies mutation and blatent abnormality. It's too judgemental, especially in DC and reaks of POV. Come on. Further, who's to say they aren't metahumans or that these powers are so unnatural?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Less encyclopedic and worse at expressing the facts, as scarce as the are.</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyway, as easily as I could go on, why are we even debating this? Bottomline: I came up with two proper terms. One was rejected based on exclusivity. The other was overlooked.

<p>Kathy Kane vs Katherine 'Kate' Kane. I know it's semantics and hair splitting, but it's far more likely that Katherine the Younger is not the woman with whom Bruce had a fling. She's quite a bit younger as well. Maybe mid-20s.

<dd>It's in the latest Batman comic where Alfred mentions Kathy Kane, and as I said before, it may be hair splitting, but I think there's a diff between Kathy and Kate. Especially since Kate is 'Katherine the Younger' and is rather younger than Bruce. We don't <b>know</b> that Alfred meant older Kathy, but it's most likely at this point. -- <font color="green"><b><a href="../../../i/p/s/User%7EIpstenu_5894.html" title="User:Ipstenu">Ipstenu</a></b> <i>(<a href="../../../i/p/s/User_talk%7EIpstenu_7a4a.html" title="User talk:Ipstenu">talk</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ipstenu_a5b5.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ipstenu">contribs</a>)</i></font> 13:38, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think Alfred was referring to Kate. Bruce Wayne having a fling with a Kate Kane in her mid-20s (she seems more like late-20s to me) is much more likely than his having one with a woman who hasn't definitely been shown to exist yet. Bruce is basically perpetually in his mid-30s anyway. That kind of age difference is not exactly uncommon. And if "Katherine the Younger" has indeed been named after someone (probably her mother, or some other adult relative), that someone would have to be in their mid-to-late 40s, at the very least, and probably quite a bit older. It's not out of the question for Bruce to have been connected with someone of that age, but it gets increasingly unlikely. I'll assume that "Katherine the Elder" is her mother, and the other woman in the newspaper photo that Renee is looking at in 52 #7. She's blonde and doesn't even resemble Pre-Crisis Kathy. --<a href="../../../s/h/o/User%7ESHODAN_1724.html" title="User:SHODAN">SHODAN</a> 11:23, 7 September 2006 (UTC)

<p>I think my point was mis-understood. I'm not saying that Kate/Batwoman isn't alive and well OYL, and I'm not saying she's not in the JLA. I'm saying that <b>until</b> she shows up in the comic pages, not the cover, her 'status' is speculative. That cover also has Supergirl and Green Arrow, neither of whom are likely to be in the new JLA at this moment in time. She has the <i>potential</i> to be in the new JLA, but until it's confirmed in the pages of the comic, it's speculation. Probable speculation. Likely speculation. Speculation I happen to agree with. But that doesn't make it not speculation. -- <font color="green"><b><a href="../../../i/p/s/User%7EIpstenu_5894.html" title="User:Ipstenu">Ipstenu</a></b> <i>(<a href="../../../i/p/s/User_talk%7EIpstenu_7a4a.html" title="User talk:Ipstenu">talk</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ipstenu_a5b5.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ipstenu">contribs</a>)</i></font> 17:42, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The fact that she is even referred to (yes, even on the COVER) in an OYL story by the DC editors themselves is proof that she will exist in the mainstream DCU following the conclusion of 52.

<dd>Dan DiDio has said that no principal character of 52 will appear in the pages, but we have gotten mentions of them. In the OYL Batman story, Ralph Dibny is mentioned as "unavailable". The Question has just been referred to in the JLA book. You're missing the bottom line: since she is on the cover, she will live and be active in some way, shape, or form, following 52. 52 has already been fully scripted, so when Benes drew her onto the cover, he knew that she wouldn't be dead. Thousands of continuity nuts would go back to the cover if she did die in 52 and blast DC for putting her on the JLA cover in the first place. Quit dancing around it, if you know it's true, then why argue? "To preserve the encyclopedia." For a second, forget the encyclopedia.

<dd>What I thought was just confirmed in the latest issue of Detective Comics. The Penguin, who'd been away longer than Batman, is aware of Batwoman's presence in Gotham. She IS alive and active after 52. I'm being completely mature with my comments, I hear what you're saying. But when observations are confirmed, as they recently have been, then they are factual. If you're too dim to see that, then you might want to seek some professional help. That's not an insult, merely an observation. You can't deny that Penguin talking about her is proof of her existence. If she'd died before 52 was over, he wouldn't know a thing about her. I'll give it a rest when you finally see the truth. --<a href="../../../c/m/d/User%7ECmdrClow_aa26.html" title="User:CmdrClow">CmdrClow</a> 06:08, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

At no time is it stated here or in the issue that Batwoman is active. Penguin <i>heard</i> about Batwoman. He didn't see her, meet her, or anything like that.

<dd>Even if she's hot, even if the Penguin is right, there's no no no confirmation that it's the same Batwoman.

<dd>I agree that this is a mention of Batwoman in the post 52-universe. I don't know if it's Kate but I said <i>Penguin hasn't met her yet, still no direct proof she's alive</i> - I see this as progress to proof, and it deserves a mention, which is why I worded the sentence in the article the way I did. it's up to interpretation, but what's stated there is fact.

<p>I was thinking, the hold "withholding info" thing just rubs me the wrong way. What if we made a new, completely seperate "One Year Later" section with the Kathy Kane reference from Alfred and the Batwoman one from Penguin. Wry and I have proven that which Batwoman is disputable, so we're already assuming by placing the mention in "Kate Kane". As things currently are, we're already assuming. With a seperate section, however confusing, the conclusions can be made solely by the reader.
