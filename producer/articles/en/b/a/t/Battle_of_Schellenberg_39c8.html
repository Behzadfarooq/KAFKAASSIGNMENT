<p>Schellenberg, taken by <i><a href="../../../c/o/u/Coup_de_main.html" title="Coup de main">coup de main</a></i>, was a victory for the Grand Alliance. The victory secured a crossing point over the river Danube and a base for provisions for Marlborough's army, thus enabling the Allied campaign of 1704 to continue its operations into <a href="../../../b/a/v/Bavaria.html" title="Bavaria">Bavaria</a>. The battle was decided within two hours, incurring over 13,000 casualties.</p>
<p>After the victory the Allies had two strategic options: either persuade the Elector of Bavaria to change allegiance to the Allied cause, or lure him from his secure base at <a href="../../../a/u/g/Augsburg.html" title="Augsburg">Augsburg</a> and defeat him in battle before he could be reinforced. To facilitate these ends, the Allies began the controversial policy of ravaging the Bavarian countryside while simultaneously, secretly negotiating with the Elector to encourage his desertion of <a href="../../../k/i/n/King_Louis_XIV_34e8.html" title="King Louis XIV">King Louis</a>. However, buoyed by the news of reinforcements, the Elector of Bavaria proved ultimately intransigent, foiling the Allies’ persuasive attempts to bring him back into the Imperial fold.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup> Although this strategy proved unsuccessful, the protagonists eventually met on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_13.html" title="August 13">13 August</a> <a href="../../../1/7/0/1704.html" title="1704">1704</a> where Marlborough and <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prince_Eugene_of_Savoy_219b.html" title="Prince Eugene of Savoy">Prince Eugene</a> defeated the Franco-Bavarian army under <a href="../../../c/a/m/Camille_d%27Hostun%2C_duc_de_Tallard_bbff.html" title="Camille d'Hostun, duc de Tallard">Marshal Tallard</a> and the Elector at the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Blenheim_09be.html" title="Battle of Blenheim">Battle of Blenheim</a>.</p>

<p>The Battle of Schellenberg was part of the Grand Alliance’s campaign of 1704 to prevent the Franco-Bavarian army from threatening <a href="../../../v/i/e/Vienna.html" title="Vienna">Vienna</a>, the capital of the <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holy_Roman_Empire_f314.html" title="Holy Roman Empire">Holy Roman Empire</a>.

<p>The campaign began in earnest on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_19.html" title="May 19">19 May</a> when the Duke of Marlborough began his 250 mile (400 km) march from <a href="../../../b/e/d/Bedburg.html" title="Bedburg">Bedburg</a> in the <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spanish_Netherlands_ef94.html" title="Spanish Netherlands">Spanish Netherlands</a>, towards <a href="../../../m/a/x/Maximilian_II_Emanuel%2C_elector_of_Bavaria_d02f.html" title="Maximilian II Emanuel, elector of Bavaria">Maximilian Emanuel, Elector of Bavaria</a> and <a href="../../../f/e/r/Ferdinand_de_Marsin_1f2f.html" title="Ferdinand de Marsin">Ferdinand, Comte de Marsin’s</a> Franco-Bavarian army on the Danube. The Allies had initially deceived the French Marshals <a href="../../../f/r/a/Fran%C3%A7ois_de_Neufville%2C_duc_de_Villeroi_6eea.html" title="François de Neufville, duc de Villeroi">Villeroi</a> and Tallard into thinking their target was <a href="../../../a/l/s/Alsace.html" title="Alsace">Alsace</a> or the <a href="../../../m/o/s/Moselle_River_f120.html" title="Moselle River">Moselle</a>, but since the Elector of Bavaria had been notified on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_5.html" title="June 5">5 June</a> of Marlborough’s march from the Spanish Netherlands, he had feared, correctly, that it was his principality of Bavaria that was the Allies real target.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup> By <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_22.html" title="June 22">22 June</a> the Duke of Marlborough’s forces had linked up with elements of the Margrave of Baden’s Imperial forces at Launsheim, whose combined forces now totalled 80,000 men.</p>
<p>Emperor <a href="../../../l/e/o/Leopold_I%2C_Holy_Roman_Emperor_cefd.html" title="Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor">Leopold</a> was keen to lure the Elector back into the Imperial fold after he had switched allegiance to fight for <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louis_XIV_of_France_d0a6.html" title="Louis XIV of France">King Louis</a> before the war.

<p>Once the Elector realised that Donauwörth was to be attacked however, Count d’Arco, a <a href="../../../p/i/e/Piedmont.html" title="Piedmont">Piedmontese</a> officer, was instructed to bolster the town’s defences and hold the Schellenberg. D’Arco was entrusted with 12,000 men from the Franco-Bavarian camp at <a href="../../../d/i/l/Dillingen.html" title="Dillingen">Dillingen</a> – most of whom were drawn from Bavaria’s best units including the Elector’s Guards and the regiment of the Prince Electoral – led by veteran officers.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[9]</a></sup> In total, the garrison defending the Schellenberg comprised of 16 Bavarian and seven French infantry <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battalions.html" title="Battalions">battalions</a>, six squadrons of French and three <a href="../../../s/q/u/Squadrons.html" title="Squadrons">squadrons</a> of Bavarian <a href="../../../d/r/a/Dragoons.html" title="Dragoons">dragoons</a>, supported by 16 guns.

<p>General d’Arco knew the whereabouts of the Allied camp at Armerdingen and was confidant he had at least a full day and night to prepare his defences; however, in the early hours of <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_2.html" title="July 2">2 July</a>, the Allied army began to break camp for the march towards Donauwörth.<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[13]</a></sup> Marlborough personally oversaw this advance of an initial assault force of 5,850-foot (predominately <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">English</a> and <a href="../../../n/e/t/Netherlands.html" title="Netherlands">Dutch</a> <a href="../../../g/r/e/Grenadier_%28soldier%29.html" title="Grenadier (soldier)">grenadiers</a>), drawn in groups of approximately 130 from each battalion under his command.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[14]</a></sup> This force, with 32 squadrons in support, was to be commanded by the Dutch General Johan Wigand van Goor.

<p>As the Allies marched, work on the Schellenberg and Donauwörth’s defences were proceeding in earnest – guns were mounted, a <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palisade.html" title="Palisade">palisade</a> built around the position’s perimeter, and trenches dug outside the <a href="../../../b/r/e/Breastwork_%28fortification%29.html" title="Breastwork (fortification)">breastworks</a> to make them doubly effective. However, at 09:00 on <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_2.html" title="July 2">2 July</a>, d’Arco learnt of the Allied advance towards his position and promptly ordered his infantry to assist his engineer’s defensive preparations. A French commander and chronicler of the period, Colonel Jean Martin de la Colonie, later wrote – “The time left to us was too short to complete this satisfactorily. . .”<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[16]</a></sup></p>
<p>Although the Allied march was slowed by the muddy roads, by mid-afternoon the river Wörnitz had been crossed at Ebermorgen. Marlborough ordered his Quartermaster-General, <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Cadogan%2C_1st_Earl_Cadogan_211a.html" title="William Cadogan, 1st Earl Cadogan">William Cadogan</a>, that as soon as he had completed his journey to the outskirts of Donauwörth, he was to mark out land for an encampment within sight of the Schellenberg to give the impression the Allies were intending a leisurely siege.<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[17]</a></sup> Count d’Arco watched Cadogan’s preparations and, falling for the deception, left the supervision of the still incomplete defences to lunch with the French commander of Donauwörth, Colonel DuBordet, safe in the belief that he had the rest of the day and night to finish the defences.<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[18]</a></sup> However, as the Allied columns marched purposefully onwards, intent on launching an immediate assault, they were spotted by the Bavarian outposts, who, after setting fire to the hamlet of Berg, rushed off to sound the alarm; General d’Arco, rudely interrupted from his comfortable lunch, rushed up the Schellenberg and called his men to arms.<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[19]</a></sup></p>

<p>The Schellenberg heights dominate the skyline to the northeast of Donauwörth – the walled town on the confluence of the Wörnitz and Danube rivers. With one flank of the hill protected by dense, impenetrable trees of the Boschberg wood, and the River Wörnitz and marshes protecting its southern and western quarters, the Schellenberg heights offer a commanding position for any defender. Its oval shaped summit, half a mile in diameter, was flat and open, and its 70 year old defences, including an old fort built by the Swedish king Gustavus Adolphus during the <a href="../../../t/h/i/Thirty_Years%27_War_f03e.html" title="Thirty Years' War">Thirty Years' War</a>, were neglected and in a dilapidated state.

<p>Although Marlborough knew a frontal attack on the Schellenberg would be costly, he was convinced that it was the only way of securing the speedy capture of Donauwörth.<sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[21]</a></sup> A female dragoon, Christian Welsh, remembered, “Our vanguard did not come into sight of the enemy entrenchments til the afternoon; however, not to give the Bavarians time to make themselves yet stronger, the duke ordered the Dutch General Goor. . . to attack as soon as possible.”<sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[22]</a></sup> As a preliminary to the attack, Marlborough’s artillery commander, Colonel Holcroft Blood, pounded the enemy from a position near Berg; each salvo countered by d’Arco’s guns from Gustavus’s fort and from just outside the Boschberg.</p>
<p>General d’Arco now ordered de la Colonie’s French infantry into reserve on top of the Heights (above the breastworks manned by the Bavarians), ready to plug any gaps in their defences at the appropriate time. However, due to the flatness of the summit, this position offered his men limited protection from the Allied guns. This exposure was noted by Colonel Blood who, sighting his guns upon the summit, was able to inflict serious casualties upon de la Colonie’s men.<sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[23]</a></sup> De la Colonie later recorded – “They concentrated their fire upon us, and with their first discharge carried off Count de la Bastide. . . so that my coat was covered with brains and blood.”<sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[24]</a></sup> Notwithstanding this barrage, and despite losing five officers and 80 grenadiers before firing a shot, de la Colonie maintained it was absolutely necessary that the French regiment stayed at their post.<sup id="_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#_note-24" title="">[25]</a></sup></p>

The disciplined march of the attackers up the hill shortly turned into a furious attack, shouting at the top of their voices as they advanced. “The rapidity of their movements, together with their loud yells, were truly alarming”, recalled Colonel de la Colonie, who, in order to drown out the shouts and hurrahs, ordered his drummer to beat <i>charge</i>.<sup id="_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#_note-27" title="">[28]</a></sup></p>

<p>As the range closed, the Allies became easy targets for the Franco-Bavarian musket- and grape-shot; the confusion exacerbated by fizzing <a href="../../../g/r/e/Grenades.html" title="Grenades">hand-grenades</a> thrown down the slope by the defenders.<sup id="_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#_note-29" title="">[30]</a></sup> To aid their assault, each Allied soldier carried a bundle of <a href="../../../f/a/s/Fascine.html" title="Fascine">fascines</a> (earlier cut from the Boschberg wood), with which to bridge the ditches in front of the breastworks to speed their passage.

<p>Notwithstanding the loss of their fascines, the Allies continued to push forward joining battle with the Bavarians in savage hand-to-hand fighting.

<p>At this moment, after the Allies had twice failed to storm the enemy’s defences on the Schellenberg, Marlborough received intelligence that the defences linking the town walls with the breastwork on the hill were now sparsely manned (Marlborough's unsuccessful attacks had drawn d’Arco's men away from other parts of the defences, leaving his left flank almost defenceless and highly vulnerable).<sup id="_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#_note-37" title="">[38]</a></sup> The other Allied commander, the Margrave of Baden (who had entered the battle half an hour after Marlborough), also noticed this opportunity and was soon hurrying with his grenadiers from the hamlet of Berg, and across the Haiback stream to assault the position.<sup id="_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#_note-38" title="">[39]</a></sup></p>
<p>Critically, Donauwörth’s garrison commander had withdrawn his men inside the town, locked the gates, and could now only offer scattered shots from its walls.<sup id="_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#_note-39" title="">[40]</a></sup> Baden’s Imperialist troops (now supported by eight of Marlborough's reserve battalions), easily breached these now weakened defences, defeated the two battalions of infantry and a handful of cavalry still defending the area, and were able to form up at the foot of the Schellenberg, interposing themselves between d’Arco and the town.</p>
<p>Noticing the danger, Count d’Arco hurried to the rear to summon his dismounted French dragoons (held back in the lee of the hill) in an attempt to stem the advancing Imperialists marching up the glacis.<sup id="_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="#_note-40" title="">[41]</a></sup> However, three companies of Baden's grenadiers confronted them with concentrated volleys, forcing the cavalry to retire. This action subsequently left d’Arco out of position and out of contact with his main force fiercely resisting on the crest of the hill. D’Arco headed for the town and, according to de la Colonie – “. . . had some difficulty in entering owing to the hesitation of the commandant to open the gates.”<sup id="_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="#_note-41" title="">[42]</a></sup></p>

<p>Aware that the Imperialist troops were entering into the Schellenberg, Marlborough launched a third assault. This time the attackers formed a broader front, requiring the defenders to spread their fire, thus reducing the deadly effectiveness of their musketry and grenades; but the defenders, including de la Colonie, (unaware that the Imperialists had penetrated the defences on their left and that d'Arco had retreated to Donauwörth),<sup id="_ref-42" class="reference"><a href="#_note-42" title="">[43]</a></sup> were still confident in their ability to repel the enemy – ”We remained steady at our post; our fire was regular as ever, and kept our opponents in check.”<sup id="_ref-43" class="reference"><a href="#_note-43" title="">[44]</a></sup></p>
<p>Shortly after Baden’s breakthrough, the Franco-Bavarian forces fighting on the hill became conscious of lines of greyish-white uniformed infantry approaching from the direction of the town. Many of the French and Bavarian officers, including de la Colonie, initially thought that the advancing troops were reinforcements from DuBordet’s garrison in Donauwörth, but it soon became apparent that they were in fact the forces of Baden’s Imperialists.<sup id="_ref-44" class="reference"><a href="#_note-44" title="">[45]</a></sup> De la Colonie described the scene – "They [Baden's Imperialist grenadiers] arrived within gunshot of our flank about 7:30 in the evening, without our being aware of the possibility of such a thing. So occupied were we in defence of our own particular post. . ." Baden’s forces, after establishing themselves at the summit of the Heights on the Allied right, now fired upon the surprised defenders of the Schellenberg, compelling a re-alignment in the Franco-Bavarian forces to meet this unexpected threat. Consequently, Marlborough’s assaulting troops on the Allied left, supported by a fresh echelon of dismounted British dragoons, were able to scramble over the now weakly defended breastwork and push the defenders back to the crown of the hill. The enemy fell into confusion.<sup id="_ref-45" class="reference"><a href="#_note-45" title="">[46]</a></sup></p>
<p>The outnumbered defenders of the Schellenberg had resisted the Allied assaults for two hours but now under pressure from both Baden's and Marlborough's forces, their stalwart defence was over. As Panic spread through the Franco-Bavarian forces, Marlborough unleashed 35 squadrons of cavalry and dragoons to pursue the fleeing troops; ruthlessly cutting down the enemy soldiers. There was no easy escape route however (a pontoon bridge over the Danube had collapsed under their weight), and many of d’Arco’s troops, most of whom could not swim, drowned trying to cross the fast-flowing river.<sup id="_ref-46" class="reference"><a href="#_note-46" title="">[47]</a></sup></p>

<p>De la Colonie was one of the few to escape but the Elector of Bavaria had lost many of his best troops – the destruction of d’Arco’s corps had a profound effect on the ability of the Franco-Bavarian forces to face the Allies in the rest of their campaign.<sup id="_ref-47" class="reference"><a href="#_note-47" title="">[48]</a></sup> Very few of the men who had defended the Schellenberg rejoined the Elector’s and Marsin’s army.<sup id="_ref-48" class="reference"><a href="#_note-48" title="">[49]</a></sup> However, included amongst this number were <a href="../../../j/e/a/Jean_Baptist%2C_Comte_d%27Arco_2994.html" title="Jean Baptist, Comte d'Arco">Comte d'Arco</a> and his second-in-command, the <a href="../../../f/r/a/Francesco_Scipione%2C_marchese_di_Maffei_bec8.html" title="Francesco Scipione, marchese di Maffei">Marquis de Maffei</a>, both of whom later defended Lutzingen at the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Blenheim_09be.html" title="Battle of Blenheim">Battle of Blenheim</a>.</p>

<p>Throughout July Marlborough sent his troops deep into <a href="../../../b/a/v/Bavaria.html" title="Bavaria">Bavaria</a> on raids of destruction, burning buildings and destroying crops, trying to lure the Elector into battle or convince him to change his allegiance back to Emperor Leopold. This spoliation in Bavaria, causing privation to the peasantry, led to entreaties from the Elector’s wife, Maria Antonia, for him to rejoin the Imperial cause and divest himself of the French alliance; Leopold also hoped that the Elector would return to the Imperial fold and offered a full pardon, as well as subsidies and restoration of all his territories.<sup id="_ref-56" class="reference"><a href="#_note-56" title="">[57]</a></sup> Although the Elector wavered somewhat in his allegiance to <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louis_XIV_of_France_d0a6.html" title="Louis XIV of France">King Louis</a>, his resolve to continue fighting against Leopold and the Grand Alliance was stiffened when news arrived that Tallard’s reinforcements of 35,000 men would soon be in Bavaria.<sup id="_ref-57" class="reference"><a href="#_note-57" title="">[58]</a></sup> However, reinforcements were also heading to bolster Marlborough's and Baden’s forces: <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prince_Eugene_of_Savoy_219b.html" title="Prince Eugene of Savoy">Prince Eugène</a>, shadowing Tallard, was heading south with 18,000 men.<sup id="_ref-58" class="reference"><a href="#_note-58" title="">[59]</a></sup></p>
