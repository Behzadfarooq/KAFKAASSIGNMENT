	    <p><b>Batwing</b> (<b>James "Jimmy" Santini</b>) is a <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marvel_Comics_b294.html" title="Marvel Comics">Marvel Comics</a> mutate character. His first appearance was in <i>Untold Tales of Spider-Man #2</i>.</p>
<p><a name="History" id="History"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/t/Batwing_%28comics%29.html" title="Edit section: History">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
<p>Young Jimmy Santini was with his father in an investigation of illegal toxic-waste dumping in <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carlsbad_Caverns_National_Park_23c4.html" title="Carlsbad Caverns National Park">Carlsbad Caverns National Park</a> where his father was either shot in the back by the polluters or fell to his death in the deep caverns (the full details were murky in Jimmy's diary). Jimmy was lost in the caverns and drank water that "tasted like metal." He was eventually rescued and returned to his mother. Soon the chemicals began to take effect and Jimmy sprouted wings and his mother proclaimed him a demon causing Jimmy to run away. He continued to mutate and ended up stealing food to survive. He arrived in New York and made his home under an old pier. Jimmy began stealing food from people dining on rooftops scaring people in the process. Thus, the people began to dub him "Batwing."</p>
<p>When it came to New York Councilman Randolph Cherryh dining with his girlfriend, Batwing appeared and stole some of his apples which humiliated Randolph. Randolph Cherryh placed a bounty on him which Peter Parker decided to take part on during his financial problems. Randolph arranged for a party as part of a trap. When Batwing came, the police sprang and began shooting only for <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spider-Man_f858.html" title="Spider-Man">Spider-Man</a> to web up the guns and pursue Batwing. Batwing battled with Spider-Man before fleeing back to the pier that he was living under. When Spider-Man followed Batwing to the pier, he discovered that Batwing was just a scared kid who was stealing food to survive. Spider-Man read some of his history before Jimmy ran off right into the Councilman who secretly followed in his helicopter. Randolph didn't care if Batwing was just a kid, and was about to kill him when Spider-Man webbed down his men. Batwing fled despite Spider-Man's offer to get <a href="../../../m/i/s/Mister_Fantastic_9f2f.html" title="Mister Fantastic">Reed Richards</a> or <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_Pym_4cd4.html" title="Henry Pym">Henry Pym</a> to help cure him. Randolph vowed to ruin Spider-Man's life before having his mouth webbed and himself being shoved into a garbage can.</p>
<p>Spider-Man continued to bring food to Jimmy who still fears people like Randolph Cherryh.</p>
<p>Spider-Man later asked Dr. Curt Connors to use his expertise to help cure Jimmy. When an accident causes Curt to become the <a href="../../../l/i/z/Lizard_%28comics%29.html" title="Lizard (comics)">Lizard</a> again, Batwing helped Spider-Man track him down and cure Curt. Curt and Jimmy left New York to someplace quiet where Jimmy can be cured.</p>
<p>When Curt's cure failed, Batwing returned to New York and battled Spider-Man again. With his father dead and his mother rejecting him, Jimmy just wanted to die. Spider-Man tracked down Jimmy's mother and told her that Jimmy is still her son, mutant or not, and that she was wrong to reject him. Just as Batwing was about to be shot by the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Police_Department_80cc.html" title="New York Police Department">New York Police Department</a>, Jimmy's mother intervened and told her son that she still loved him. Upon hearing this and knowing that he is loved, Jimmy reverted back to his human form and the police backed off. Jimmy went home with his mother, finally receiving the love that he had needed so badly.</p>
