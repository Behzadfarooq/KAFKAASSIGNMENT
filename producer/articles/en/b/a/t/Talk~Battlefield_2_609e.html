<p>From my point of view, some of these mods linked need to be removed. Shouldn't the mod section be for mods that are done or have some actual meat to preview? Stagnant mods need to be removed, as well as these upcoming mods plans. This isn't a place to advertise new mods in progess. Does anyone agree that some need to be removed?

<dd>I would recommend against making a list in the style of 'every BF2 mod ever conceived', like <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Battlefield_1942_mods_baf1.html" title="List of Battlefield 1942 mods">List of Battlefield 1942 mods</a>. Articles like that are largely unverifiable (without scrupulous referencing), and just tempt people into adding non-notable material. My advice is to stick solely to mods which have active websites, and split that up into released mods and mods in progress. <a href="../../../r/e/m/User%7ERem120_9953.html" title="User:Rem120">Remy B</a> 15:38, 20 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>What would we qualify as an active mod? Perhaps we could do it by downloads? Or maybe how active its forums are?

<dd>I would just go by whether or not they have a website with its own domain name.

<dd>Well if group of modders are very serious, determined, and ambitious enough, why shouldn't they get some recognition in upcoming mods? Mods have the start somewhere. The problem is, as stated, that people will want notoriety for their lame-duck projects, and this isn’t a billboard for that. This is more of a moderation issue to me, as the users here will need to remove such ambiguous advertisement. As long as they announce their mod with some meat, including weekly updates, then I’ll support their cause for placing their mod in the mod section.</dd>
<dd>I agree with Remy B about a mod team having their own domain and website, and not in some section of a BF2 fansite forum. I also think that a mod with at least one update a week is sufficiently in progress, such as a media update. If a site were not to have an update (media or comment) in weeks, then the site seriously needs to be considered for removal. If someone thinks a mod shouldn't be listed with good judgment, they have by my approval to remove it. Those who posted their site can argue in the discussion for it back, or just revert it, plain and simple.--<a href="../../../h/e/l/User%7EHellogoodsir_0047.html" title="User:Hellogoodsir">Hellogoodsir</a> 19:29, 20 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I disagree that we should list mods simply to help them gain recognition. The point of Wikipedia is to write about notable things, not help things become notable. An encyclopedia is not a public service to people who want publicity or notoriety. <a href="../../../r/e/m/User%7ERem120_9953.html" title="User:Rem120">Remy B</a> 07:17, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I believe a current mods section is ungainly, because mods can die or start quickly, and in a few years people might stop updating most of them. Therefore making an article like <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Battlefield_1942_mods_baf1.html" title="List of Battlefield 1942 mods">List of Battlefield 1942 mods</a> would be hard to maintain.--<a href="../../../z/x/c/User%7EZxcvbnm_9dac.html" title="User:Zxcvbnm">Zxcvbnm</a> 01:05, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I suppose, but BF2 hasn't been around as long so no one is going to be overwhelmed by that many mods. In my opinion, a majority of people are still into the ranked play over unranked play, bf2 or mods. A new format is definitely good idea though, but it all dwindles down to keeping the mod section clean, spiffy, up-to-date, and monitored for abuse. Can we also keep the replies in an orderly fashion, from left to right, and right to left and so forth?--<a href="../../../h/e/l/User%7EHellogoodsir_0047.html" title="User:Hellogoodsir">Hellogoodsir</a> 03:09, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Remy, I understand, but we shouldn't go Gestapo like with the mods. I know wikipedia is not a billboard, but if we must, we can take down all mods because it is advertising. The fact that I can find a well written and detailed article about a game on the internet is excellent. The fact when I want to find popular mods from the same site is even greater. Now I don't think anyone here is being liberal on letting all mods be posted here. They should be checked first to see if they will meet our standards. Let us please define these standards. I've already suggested mine, but not in the greatest of detail.--<a href="../../../h/e/l/User%7EHellogoodsir_0047.html" title="User:Hellogoodsir">Hellogoodsir</a> 19:04, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well guys not to be offensive to everyone out their but the following mods seem to have the biggest impact on the game in my opinion and pretty sure the general opinion of the battlefield 2 community. -Desert Conflict -First Strike -Forgotten Hope 2 -Point of Existence -Rising Conflicts -Project Reality -Operation Peacekeeper -Battlefield Pirates</p>
<p>So lets ruin this like everything else in the world and give the little guys no show....Yeah keep up with the corporate big boy world attitude.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Are you joking me? The "corporate big boy world" attitude? Do you realize these mods are not owned by any "big boy" corporations and there is no money involved here? Also, mods are generally considered to be popular because they're <i>good</i>, not because they've spent the most advertising dollars ($0?). Go find an argument with some substance, please.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Back to the discussion, I think the standards we place on mods to be on wikipedia could be defined well enough as to avoid the never ending mod death/life cycle as most decently popular mods don't die off that way.<a href="../../../u/s/e/User%7EUseless_Fodder_03a4.html" title="User:Useless Fodder">Useless Fodder</a> 23:51, 3 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I believe that we should only post the "top 5" mods, thereby eliminating all of the minor ones which can die off quickly. That way they can stay up-to-date.--<a href="../../../z/x/c/User%7EZxcvbnm_9dac.html" title="User:Zxcvbnm">Zxcvbnm</a> 00:54, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Argument, excuse me mister I bet you have just recently hoped on the BF2 band wagon...Most full mods for BF2 are far from being released and the game has been our for over a year...This game was started on a community one that developed DC for BF42 and thus spawned what we have today. The big boy world attitude is how you think only the biggest and most bad mods should get recognition...You clearly know nothing of the modding world because some of those big mods are sponsored by certain groups in the online gaming community, like game server providers...A lot of the reason some of the smaller mods are stagnate is because they don’t have the exposure and thus the resources available to them as some of the bigger mods have...These one would think should be focused on in a FREE ENCYCLOPEDIA, BF2 is as much about the community as it is about the game itself...I was also using the term "big boy corporate world" loosely...mostly in reference to sites like Totalbf2.com (which yes is owned by big boy corporate world)...Oh, btw basically ever site you have listed in the external links is a commercial entity...
<dl>
<dd>Fine then, to make it fair I will delete the "mods" section. I will put the ones that have articles under "see also."

<dd>One recent editor has seen fit to restore the Mods section. I agree that we should refrain from including this section, which is basically linkspam. Bfelite, I'm removing the mods because they provide no information apart from links to external sites. However, if you can find wikipedia entries for these mod projects, go ahead and restore the section. Link to the articles instead, and remove the mods that aren't notable (and don't have wikipedia entries) from the list. ~ <a href="../../../f/l/o/User%7EFlooch_dbc1.html" title="User:Flooch">Flooch</a> 00:01, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't think we can dance around this issue or pretend it doesn't exist. One of the worst things about BF2 is that serious bugs are known to its user, the user's hopes get raised when a patch is announced, only to be dashed when it comes out and the users find out that the bug is STILL not fixed. One of the worst is where a fellow teammate appears in the enemy's colors which leads to him being shot and the shooter being punished for a team kill. This is also annoying for the fellow being shot at. Either this bug was very difficult to find or fix, or EA was out of touch with the user community and didn't consider the bug to be important. Perhaps the most serious bugs could be listed. Regarding needing a source for the bugs... is the collective word of the user community not enough? Does a bug need to be officially recognized by EA to be listed? If so, we'll be waiting a long time for some of them. Also, in case anyone is wondering, I love the game and play it everyday, despite the bugs.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Actually, a section or different article listing all the major bugs and problems unique to battlefield 2(such as the Commander Hack)would be a very good idea, helping to educate the average gamer. If you think its a good idea then someone else or I will add a new section for it, and then possibly give it its own article. - Blehm 06:05, 11 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>In fact, I added a line of text to the "Patches" section of this article, including a link to one such wikidocument today (12/11/2006), which was set up to record any/all bugs reported to it by the community. But for some reason it was removed and I would really like to know why. As to comments regarding the need for "reliable sources", the community is not only the most reliable source, but is in fact just about the only source as they represent the largest sample size. Where else does such information come from? Sure there are beta testers, but they are typically made up of small groups amd can't possibly be expected to find everything. And they haven't in the case of BF2, that much is certain (reference major issues created by the BF2 v1.30 update). Game publishers have received and used bug reports directly from their communities for many, many years now. If it's good enough and reliable enough for them, so it should be for any wikidocument as well. But in cases such as this, saying that it is not simply because it lacks some official stamp of approval is (and pardon me for saying so) absurd. Moreover, a section devoted to or links referring to a list of commonly reported bugs would provide a convenient, centralized place for bugs to be defined and for BF2's development team to read about them. Wikipedia is about disseminating information, correct? So let’s give it to them! Braidedheadman 11:42, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I just wondered how in the world a US vs. China scenario could in any way be somewhat realistic. I don't see why they didn't just pick north korea. It would be so much more believable.</p>
<p>The nukes would definitely prevent the US from entering China, and on top of that I guess the international community (most noticably Russia) would protest, preventing anything like this from ever happening.</p>
<p>Also, what is the reason for US aggression against China? "Holy cow, the evil communists are annoying me! Let's get'em!" I don't think so. Something to do about oil? Why invade China then?</p>
<p>And why doesn't China and MEC cross swords in any map what so ever? Are they allied? Or doesn't the oil interest China at all? If so, again, what does the US do in China?</p>
<p>Does the US really think that they're tough enough to take on two (or more when you consider that MEC is a coalition) countries at the same time? (Chirst, they can barely hold their own in Iraq! Maybe the two conflicts take place in two different dimensions? Who knows...</p>

<dd>China's burgeoning economic strength is seen as something of a threat in the US, so it's a logical choice. China is frequently said to be "the next superpower", and, if the Cold War is any indication, superpowers generally butt heads. A dispute over Taiwan (like Berlin during the Cold War) could serve as a <i>casus belli</i>. The scenario is pure fiction, of course: in my opinion, it's farfetched enough to be interesting, but not so farfetched as to be ridiculous. An invasion of England, for example, would be more difficult to understand. <a href="../../../b/c/a/User%7EBcasterline_8fb5.html" title="User:Bcasterline">bcasterline</a> <a href="../../../b/c/a/User_talk%7EBcasterline_273f.html" title="User talk:Bcasterline">t</a> 21:18, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, I can understand your argument, but I really don't think just being a country with a strong economy warrants a US attack, especially so if you consider the nuclear weapons possessed by both sides. There's a reason the cold war never got hot. MAD <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_assured_destruction" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_assured_destruction" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> is still the main reason why we haven't had any major wars between industrialized countries in the last few decades. Besides, didn't the US just sell a truckload of planes to China? Wouldn't that suggest friendly relations between the two? The story IS ridiculous but to be frank it doesn't really ruin the game.</dd>

<dd>I think China don't battle the MEC simply because the game is made primarily for the US market and therefor they have put the US in every map. As far as I know, there isn't any information on why there are no China vs MEC maps (or 3 way battle maps, that would be cool, but would probably need a whole heap of new coding), just that there arn't. <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanderra_5cc9.html" title="User:Canderra">Canderra</a> 21:29, 6 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Umm, unless I've been caught in a time warp since watching the news earlier this evening, I think the war in Iraq is still going on and doesn't look life finishing anytime soon. Not that this has anything to do with anything. The reality is that the official story to Battlefield 2 does not specify the reasons behind the US - China, US - MEC wars (or if the MEC - China are even at war or not). Therefor any talk regarding such a story is purely speculative. Heck, the US could be invading China because China nuked half the US for all we know. I don't think the developers intended the game to be story based, rather for whatever reason, the US (along with the EU army in the add-on pack) are currently at war with the MEC and China, and you (the player) are on the front line. <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanderra_5cc9.html" title="User:Canderra">Canderra</a> 00:38, 7 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thats silly though. By that rationale World War 2 (in Europe) must have been 2 seperate wars. The first one being won by Germany when they conquered France, Poland, Denmark, etc. (and only insurgencies remained) and the second being a few years later when the allies invaded and conquered Germany. Besides, all the newspapers and TV news programs refer to the conflict as the "War in Iraq". Surely a war is over when fighting stops and the vast majority of troops get to go home. Btw, I'm not sure what you mean as "over in record time", the shortest ever war is generally considered to be the <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglo-Zanzibar_War_c82f.html" title="Anglo-Zanzibar War">Anglo-Zanzibar War</a> which lasted for 45 minutes, pretty hard to beat really. (p.s. I really don't mean to insult anyone if they have strong feelings on this subject, as it means nothing to me either way, I've just never heard of the Iraq war (the 2nd one) as being refered to as "over" before). <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanderra_5cc9.html" title="User:Canderra">Canderra</a> 03:16, 7 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>...so in the end we can all just agree on that the story in BF2 is nonexistant? BTW, I didn't really refer to the conflict in Iraq as a war. I didn't specify it as so. I only said that "the US can barely hold their own in Iraq." It would be rather hard to take on a superpower and a coalition of countries at the same time when they can't even handle the little "conflict" with "mopping up pockets of insurgents" in Iraq. Lastly, I don't really care about why they didn't include China vs. MEC from a gameplay point of view. Game mechanics aside, I just wonder how they can justify their imaginary conflict, since so many players feel that BF2 appeals to them because of it's "sense of realism", and this is kind of annoying me. Surely a North Korea vs. US and Iraqi Insurgents vs. US scenario would be more reasonable, and wouldn't had that big an impact on the actual gameplay anyway. Though I'm a bit unsure of this, North Korea probably has the same kind of weapons and vehicles as China, and to be honest, MEC just seems like a bad case of political correctness to me. They could've just called them "Iraqi insurgents" or Iran for that matter.</dd>

<dd>And just one more thing: I don't buy that "alternate universe" crap. I mean, come on! If this was an feasible way of explaining anomalies in movies and games, then you could say that to practically any and all mistakes done by anyone at any time during any phase of development! "Why was it a car in the middle of that field in Lord of the rings: Fellowship of the ring? Ah, well I guess it was just teleported in from a parallel dimension where they had invented cars already, and Frodo and Sam just didn't notice it." (Now that I think of it, this example is rather crude, as it IS in fact happening in a sort of alternate universe. Still, you get the point, don't you? Why don't we see any other cars in LOTR? Why isn't it mentioned in the books? Why is there no explanation for these strange irregularities. You can't just chalk it up to the old "writers intent"/"artists liberty" thing, especially when the developers are so proud of that near mythical realism that everyone seems so be so obsessed with.)</dd>

<dd>Why must this happen in 2007? Maybe it's supposed to happen in a few years, who knows. Anyway, China in this "alternate universe" have the same weapons as China in real life, so I suppose they also have their nukes and then the problem is still the same: Why wouldn't MAD prevent a China vs. US conflict. I don't see why the nukes would disappear when everything else remains the same. To be honest, you're just proving my point here. The story IS nonexistant as we have to make up all kinds of theories about alternate universes and that nukes don't exist and stuff, which is VERY unlikey. At least the US wouldn't be the superpower it is portrayed as in the game without nukes. Your comment implies that the sitation is grossly unrealistic in any case, so can we just agree that BF2 is not a story-driven game in any way and that the "realism" the community seems so proud of is highly overrated? <a href="../../../c/r/a/User%7ECrackerMonkey_380d.html" title="User:CrackerMonkey">CrackerMonkey</a> 23:09, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>True... Not to mention the how skilled the medics are with their shock-thingies. Man, they can revive you in less than a second even if you have a dozen bullets lodged in your head. They don't even need bandages to stop potential bleeding. The medkits they drop are kind of cool too. It's so easy to use that even untrained soldiers can practically gather up any lost entrails and sew up any fatal wound in a matter of seconds without any help at all. Of course, this is due to the extensive training these troops have undergone. Every soldier can drive any vehicle (though their skills at this are rather lacking), operate any plane, swim like an olympic master, repair any machine they might come across and even parachute like a professional. Their marksmanship is neither lacking in any way, as they can take the head of an enemy soldier several hundred meters away with a regular handgun, however, because of lackluster sniper rifles that lack the neccessary power to put a man down in one shot and the visual impairment that some soldiers complain about dubbed "draw distance syndrome". This latter problem might also be related to the thick fog the troops are encountering all over the world. Especially pilots are susceptible to this problem, as they can rarely see their targets. Even so, again due to the extreme skills of the soldier/pilot-hybrids, our troops deal with this by flying at a jaw-dropping 300 feet! Even though the cost of a joint strike fighter is a bit high, roughly around 55 million US dollars, and their estimated time on the battlefield is about one to two minutes, they are steadily supplied at the frontlines to cater the needs adrenaline addicted soldiers. A commander is always present to guide his fellow soldiers and he is elected in a very rewarding way purely based on time spent at the front lines, regardless of his skill. Many grunts with a quick triggerfinger have risen to become some of our times greatest leaders and idols, showing passion and knowledge at every turn. Some have complained about the lack of an office in a safe location away from the battlefield, with the neccessary tools and gadgets like all-seeing radars and pinpoint-accuracy artillery, but this is largely ignored as mutiny is quite common, and the dissent in the ranks often are followed with the commander being booted from his post and sent out in the field. Although as previously stated our troops training regimen produce superior soldiers, some critics argue that the troops teamworking skills are a bit inadequate. Many conspiracists have considered the possibility of our soldiers actually being clones, as they seem to come in batches of 300 and all look alike as long as they're equipped with the same gear. This would also explain why these super soldiers perform so well. Regardless, discipline and sense of duty is somewhat lacking, but no one can say that our troops aren't doing a great job, because they are. By raising our beloved flag on strategic locations of great import, the enemy is disheartened and forced to send fewer reinforcments instead of the traditional response which is to send more. <a href="../../../c/r/a/User%7ECrackerMonkey_380d.html" title="User:CrackerMonkey">CrackerMonkey</a> 19:44, 13 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"TV news programs refer to the conflict as the "War in Iraq"." Wait unless i am mistaken congress didn't and hasn't ever declared war on Iraq so basically the news is wrong and so are you. For your information it is considered a conflict. Anyways bf2 has the US fighting the chinese is because as was stated earlier that superpowers crash. Not only that but the dispute over tiawan is a huge issue we have pledged that we would protect them from any chinese invasion and we all know that china would love to have it back.</p>
<p><br />
Well first off, the US isn't in this fictional war alone. The EU is seen fighting against China and the MEC in Euro Forces. The British SAS is also seen fighting off the MEC insurgency in Special Forces. As to why they choose the sides they did, this one is fairly obvious. They choose China because, as others have stated, China is an emerging superpower and superpowers do indeed clash. Also, from a gameplay standpoint it would be far more interesting to see a fight between the US and China as opposed to the US and North Korea, MAD be damned. It's also not impossible for the US and China to declare war on eachother. China could seek to gain control of Taiwan in the future, or they could even decide to declare war on Japan since China and Japan dont really like eachother all that much. As for the MEC, they were made up to mirror the recent wars in the Middle East. And the reason they formed a fictional middle east alliance is to make it more interesting and give them an excuse to have the MEC military be well trained and equiped with more state-of-the-art weaponry. Now, as to the question of whether or not China and the MEC are allied, they most certainly are. You don't think it's a coincidence that both China and the MEC tried to invade US soil at the same time, do you? As an aside to the whole "the US can barely hold their own in Iraq," thing. You're right, we are just barely holding out in Iraq. But you got to put it into prespective. Right now, the US military is fighting an unconventional war against guerrilla fighters, not a conventional military. It took us weeks to oust Iraq's conventional military forces. The guerrillas blend in with the civilian population which means you cant just drop bombs left and right. Civilian casualties, although a sad part of war, are very taboo these days. This is why it's taking us so long to stabilize. I highly doubt any other military could do a much better job in our position. Please understand, this isn't an insult towards the military forces of other nations. Im just saying that in general, a war against guerrilla forces is very very hard to fight for ANY Military Force.--Mooshu 14 December 2006</p>

<dd>"We're running low on reinforcements" is pretty obvious, and means you have a low number of tickets left. "Enemy weakening key positions" is a bit harder, and it might mean that the enemy is capturing flags and stuff.

<dd>Both "We're running low on reinforcements" and "Enemy weakening key positions" occur when you have thirty tickets. "Start Fighting" is when the enemy bases are 75%(?) and after that, if no more enemies capture, and you neutralize a point, "We've regained control" plays. --<a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a></dd>

<p>"Start Fighting" happens when you are on a map <i>without</i> uncapturable flags, and lose control of half the control points. Essentially, it happens right when your team goes into a "bleed" because you don't have enough flags. On a map <i>with</i> uncapturable flags it happens when either team controls all the flags. It happens when your team goes into a bleed basically. When you get out of the bleed (or perhaps put the other team into a bleed, I can't quite remember), they play "We've regained control". --<a href="../../../u/b/i/User%7EUbiq_091d.html" title="User:Ubiq">Ubiq</a> 22:23, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>One thing from my experience with video game FA's — you need to focus on the game's impact and notability. Information on its development cycle, critical reaction, reviews, sales figures and other notable phenomenon, as well as trimming down any unnecessary "fancrufty" details. See <i><a href="../../../f/i/n/Final_Fantasy_X_3b16.html" title="Final Fantasy X">Final Fantasy X</a></i> for a good example of what to include. ~ <a href="../../../f/l/o/User%7EFlooch_dbc1.html" title="User:Flooch">Flooch</a> 08:44, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm not sure if this section is even needed as the problems with BF2 are basically the problems with FPS in general. There are some BF2 specific problems, but I've not seen a similar place in other game articles. They all have actual published reactions, so if we were to change it to a sourcable section, I think it'd be better. <a href="../../../u/s/e/User%7EUseless_Fodder_03a4.html" title="User:Useless Fodder">Useless Fodder</a> 03:02, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I've removed it. We have had sections like this in the past, where people would just list every little gripe they could think of about the game's performance or lack of realism.

<p>This section has returned in the new section labelled "Reactions." I think this is a fair and balanced view with reviews cited from both sides. Look good to you all? <a href="../../../u/s/e/User%7EUseless_Fodder_03a4.html" title="User:Useless Fodder">Useless Fodder</a> 17:42, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I don't think it is balanced. It doesn't really go in-depth at all with the real problems. Whilst saying that problems the game faces are common for all FPS games; BF2 most certainly does have it's fair share of problems specific to it, and I have thus created a criticism section directly below reactions to reflect these - I know that negativity isn't overly required but I really do feel as a player of the game that paving over them with only minor mentions of the problems isn't good enough. Now I know a lot of what I've posted isn't sourced but having experienced the ea uk forums for over a year I can vouch for all of it being 100% accurate (in as much as what was complained about, not so much if what was complained about is actually fact or exaggeration, if you catch my drift). Feel free to do some searching on that forum for the many thousands of posts that are full of whining complaints but they all covered everything I mention in that part, and a lot more. It's not just central to EAUKF either, totalBF2 has it's fair share on their forums. You might also find some things to do with the alternative ranking things and how 1.3 apparently 'blocked' it. I didn't mention that but it caused a stir as well.</p>
<dl>
<dd>As a member of the EAUKF as well, I too can vouch for the veracity of the comments made by this author. The comments he made are precisely in line with those made on the EAUK and other BF2-related community forums. If links to specific posts as sources are required, they can be given provided someone adds tags to where they feel citations are required. Braidedheadman 01:52, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I seriously believe published sources are required for the criticism section. Although I believe many of these details are valid, I also believe an article that seems to be very "opinionated" such as this needs credibility. I do not believe simply linking to a thread in which a person or group rants or points out the problem is enough; It's a source, but I wouldn't call it a <b>credible</b> source. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by BirdKr (<a href="../../../b/i/r/User_talk%7EBirdKr_1e75.html" title="User talk:BirdKr">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_BirdKr_b015.html" title="Special:Contributions/BirdKr">contribs</a>) 11:56, 19 December 2006 (UTC).</small></dd>

<p>So just because some dead-end gaming websites didn't give a flying fuck about any of this and didn't report on the issue you're saying that everything the community complained about is completely irrelevant. Bullshit. The game was made popular by us, the community, and if wasn't for us there'd be no game. We put up with enough crap and got ignored so much by EA and still there's bitterness. We play the game in hope of an update that will cater to our requests and what happens? We get landed with rubbish yet again because they wer eonly interested in milking us dry rather than actually supporting us.</p>
<p>And because of this close minded opinion that we don't matter, all the idiots who have the job of bringing this to the mass media by actually writing about it on their gaming websites and sites like this just thought everyone was complaining for nothing and they did nothing. No wonder EA continues to make and shift millions of copies of it games even though it has put hardly any effort into making them quality products. As long as this kind of information suppression goes on they'll always get clean away with it.</p>
<p>If anything, Wiki is being biased here, biased towards EA and is dirty business tactics by pretending a communities voice doesn't matter. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_66.246.246.197_67f2.html" title="Special:Contributions/66.246.246.197">66.246.246.197</a> (talk)</small></p>

<dd>I really dont know, its such a grey area. My only advice would be not to be surprised if any of these map articles get put up for deletion at some point in the future.

<p>I also took the liberty of changing the previous article of BF2 patches so each information of a patch uses the same format.

<blockquote>
<p>Patch Update Version 1.41 (officially released on November 16, 2006). The patch includes only one documented bug fix: "Fixed an extremely intermittent server crash bug." <i>In reality, this patch did nothing except shut down internet play for those not willing to download it. Evidence of this is in the "Custom Games" tab, where the Battlefield 2 game tab still reads "1.4". However, the fix is not false as the rebooting of internet servers to fit this new patch automatically eliminates at least one bug. There is no incremental version of this patch, in order to induce people into choosing to purchase Battlefield 2142 instead of downloading the patch. This patch would be the only patch for BF2 that was made by the original development team[citation needed].</i></p>

<dd>I do not think so.</dd>

<p>The whole point of a good encyclopedia is that it provides information that goes beyond what has been made official. The best ones even have their own staff of people who do research on their own. Also, we are not talking about some statement that can not be verified. Go get a dual xeon machine, put windows 2000 on it and it will work. Everyone can verify that. If we are just going to use information approved by EA, why not just link to the EA website? You can be sure they have everything on there they want you to know, not a bit more.</p>
<p>However, I can see that this is not going to be a honest discussion about what is best for the wiki, it is about some people just wanting to be right. Why listen to reason?

<p>I know this is kind of off-topic, but has anyone else noticed the seemingly extreme amount of bugs since patch 1.4. I know Battlefield 2 has always had a reputation for being one of the buggiest games of all time but some of the new bugs are just funny. My favorite is the one where your c4 mysteriously self-detonates, but rather than killing you it sends you and your teammates flying (unhurt) across the map, a bit of research and this could be really used to some effect!</p>
<p>Thankfully server crashes seem to have decreased a little. On a more serious note, I hope BF2142 actually gets some people who know how to program working on it though. <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanderra_5cc9.html" title="User:Canderra">Canderra</a> 19:02, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That's mostly because most of the bugs in 1.3 and previous versions were never fixed in 1.4. Most of the bugfixes were for engine and server stability, because it will be the same engine used for BF2142, which is what EA and Dice are now working on. So basically, you don't have to worry about BF2142, since the bugfixes they are implementing for BF2 now are all intended for BF2142. Oh and another thing, the Dice team working on BF2 right now is Dice Canada, while Dice Sweden is the one working on BF2142. The Sweden team is notably less incompetent. Of course I won't be adding any of this to the article because I don't have any references, but it should at least explain to you why every patch of BF2 has slowly made it a buggier and buggier game. <a href="../../../6/9/2E/User%7E69.124.143.230.html" title="User:69.124.143.230">69.124.143.230</a> 17:52, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I really dont think so. I would much rather stick to what the game is than the nuances of how people have played it in certain versions. <a href="../../../r/e/m/User%7ERemy_B_eda6.html" title="User:Remy B">Remy B</a> 01:11, 16 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I was just thinking some tiny sub-section since I believe there is a reference to the term once or twice in the article itself. <a href="../../../6/9/2E/User%7E69.124.143.230.html" title="User:69.124.143.230">69.124.143.230</a> 23:04, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>How about we remove the reference to squad hopping or, instead of using the term, give its definition instead? I think it's used only once in the article. Does that sound agreeable? <a href="../../../6/9/2E/User%7E69.124.143.230.html" title="User:69.124.143.230">69.124.143.230</a> 23:05, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I didn't even see this at first, but is</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Unlike Battlefield 1942, there are no ground vehicle repair pads. This means that the only methods of repair are via engineer, or the comparatively slow supply drop. This is to necessitate a stronger, more urgent team dynamic, and in a way breaks the sense of dominance tanks had in previous games in the series.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>technically original research? I don't recall EA or Dice even mentioning the lack of vehicle repair pads, or why they chose to drop them. I'd be interested in seeing a source. <a href="../../../6/9/2E/User%7E69.124.143.230.html" title="User:69.124.143.230">69.124.143.230</a> 23:04, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Unofficial Story</p>
<p>The following unofficial story was created by Talon1579. Please do not copy this story withou the permission of Talon1579 or bf2s.com.</p>
<p>Chapter One: MEC</p>
<p>November, 2006. Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, president of Iran, finally declares that the country has made nuclear weapons. He states that he will not use them unless pushed, as the US and other countries possess them and it is his right.</p>
<p>The UN meetings begin, but nothing is resolved. The threat of nuclear war is too high, and eventually they cut trade with Iran.</p>
<p>Oil prices go up, and Bush faces more criticism then ever. With Prime Minister Blair of the UK now handed over power to Gordon Brown, the UK is far less eager to go to war than ever before. The US is on its own, but for once has support of the most of the public, with the increasing costs of car and air travel.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>February, 2007: While the army is mobilized, the Marines are sent to invade Iran, to capture vitally needed olfields and prepare the way for the full-scale invasion. When the landing ships near the Persian Gulf, the full extent of Iran's plans come into play. They've formed the Middle Eastern Coalition. The main members are Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Lebanon, Jordan, Syria, the Palastinian Territories, Afghanistan and Pakistan. Oman, Yemen, Qatar, Kuwait and the UAE are forced to join or face invasion, and do. Egypt remains neutral.</p>
<p>India, fearing a destructive conflict, signs a neutrality pact with the MEC to prevent another war with Pakistan.</p>
<p>President Bush can't back down now. He continues with his invasion plan of Iran. The Marines begin the invasion of Iran at the Gulf of Oman, while the MEC armies are still massing. They capture a key airbase, to provide cover for the landing craft. Operation Clean Sweep, the destruction of forces guarding the entrance to the Gulf, swiftly follows, and succeeds, granting the USMC access to the whole Gulf, and a landfall in the UAE. They quickly push into Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>Sharqi Peninusla provides a second foothold in Iran for the USMC. The MEC counterattacks, but is driven back after fierce city fighting.</p>
<p>Under pressure to capture oil, elements of the marines are routed through the Gulf of Aden, to capture the oil rich wetlands of Zatar, in Yemen.</p>
<p>With footholds secured in Iran and Saudia Arabia, The US push both east and west, to capture the large city of Mashtuur in Iran, and the strategic point of Kubra Dam in Saudi Arabia. Both places will be used as bases for further incursions into the countries. Then, elements fom both forces will coverge to capture the city of Karkand, on the Iran/Iraq border.</p>
<p>Chapter Two: China</p>
<p>August, 2007: President Hu Jintao, of the PRC, seizes the oppurtunity. With US oil prices higher than ever and the country heading towards economic chaos, he cuts trade with the US completely. Now facing a huge lack of oil and many other goods, Bush is forced to attack China to secure the extra oil he needs, and to prevent the US from falling of its throne as the world's most powerful nation. The US navy, mostly unused in the Middle East, sails to Manchuria with the USMC.</p>
<p>A treaty with Russia allows the US to attack Manchuria from East Siberia. They immidately head for the crossing point of the Songhua River, the mining area of Fu She and the Oilfields at Daqing. A seaborned landing in the bay of Po Hai alllows the US to take the Dalian Nuclear Facility. They attempt to capture the mouth of the Yellow River at Dragon valley, but are repelled.</p>
<p>Gradually a stalemate builds, with the dominance of the US navy allowing them to land more and more troops, and China moving more and more troops to Manchuria and Bejing.</p>
<p>Chapter 3: Wake Island</p>
<p>December, 2007: In a move reminiscent of Pearl Harbour, the Chinese equivalent of the Marines destroys the small garrison at Wake Island and captures the airstrip there. Bringing in highly advanced J-10 fighters, they bgein destroying supply ships bound for Manchuria. USMC reinforcements for Manchuria divert to Wake Island to destroy the chinese planes there and recapture the airstrip. However, it will not be easy. The first landing ship sent there is decimated by the Chinese artillery and air power set up on the island. A stronger force is sent almost immidiately. The USS Essex, leading the assault, is bombed continuously by J-10s, suffering heay damage. But many marines launching in RIBs and hovercrafts capture both the North and South beachheads. A large squadron of F-35Bs eventually destroys the PLA air power, and the PLA forces, pushed back by both sides, retreat to the airfield The USMC land tanks, which decimate the PLA infantry. Finally, the airstrip is bombed to smithereens. The base is destroyed, but useless as an airbase without major repair work. However, with US reinforcements sent here instead of Manchuria, the Chinese are gradually pushing the US back on the mainland.</p>
<p>Chapter Four: Special Forces</p>
<p>Meanwhile...</p>
<p>Behind every war there are the Special Forces. The less publicised battles that were fought in many countries.</p>
<p>July, 2007: British occupation forces in Fallujah, Iraq, left over from the Iraq War, have sustained attacks by an Insurgent Warlord, a fromer member of Saddam's army. Any attempt to counterattack is met with the deaths of Iraqi civilians. This became unnaceptable to the British government, who sent in the SAS to capture the Warlord's compund and take out the Warlord himself. The compound was taken after fierce city fighting, but the Warlord himself escaped.</p>
<p>The same Warlord is discovered by MI6 in Syria, reactivating an abandoned airport. His purpose is unlcear, but it is possibly going to be used to airdrop terrorist cells into Europe. The SAS are sent under the cover of night, by parachute, to try and eliminate him once again and stop the Warlord. This time, they are succesful, capturing the Warlord and "convincing" him to reveal information about the new MEC Special Forces, who he had been working in co-operation with.</p>
<p>With this new intel, US intelligence sends the SEALs to Devil's Perch, a former sanitarium off the coast of Lebanon, where MEC Special Forces are constructing a base for European operations. The US attack by submarine, seeing it as a way to gain the support of Europe and start another front in Lebanon. The site is effectively captured, but while the battle raged, MEC Special Forces launch two, simultaneous attacks.</p>
<p>In an attempt to cripple the US forces, and gain valuble technology, the MEC attack the new Nuclear Submarine pens in Oman, and the USS Essex, docked off the coast of Dubai. The sub pens fall, but after the evacuation of the submarines themselves. The MEC SF are forced to retreat, as they lack the forces to hold the base. The USS Essex is occupied, but a swift counterattack by SEALs, who know the inside of the ship well, eliminates all the MEC SF onboard.</p>
<p>August, 2007: The MEC high command, seeking to gain allies and money in the war, secretly does deals with both Russia and the Chechnyan Rebels. They supply the Rebels with the tools to reactivate a Chemical Weapons factory and to build a missile capable of delivering the deadly payload. In return the MEC gets vast amounts of money, and stolen plans for newer Russian jets, tanks and weapons, allowing to build a newer military for their future grand plan...</p>
<p>Russia has close links with the EU, and has already allowed the US to use Siberia as a staging point. To help prevent them joining the war against the MEC, the MEC informed them of the Rebels' plans, double-crossing their allies.</p>
<p>The Russians, grateful to the MEC, secretly sent blueprints of their new APC design to the MEC via the Caspian sea. A rogue Ukranian independence faction had "somehow" found out about this convoy, and rigged a ghost town with anti-vehicle mines purchased secretly from Britain.</p>
<p>The SAS then sent in a team to capture the remains of the plans. The Spetznaz were sent in to do the same job, but the Ukranians had overdone it and nothing remained but burning hulks. After fierce fighting, both sides retreated.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, thanks to the MEC, the Russians now knew about the Rebel operations in Kazakhstan and Chechnya. Sending large, well-armed Spetznaz teams, the Chemical factory and missile launch site where quickly captured.</p>
<p>Chapter Five: Euro Force</p>
<p>January, 2008: On the First of January the European Union signs a pact to creat a joint military, the Euro Force. Although it only comprises around a third of each country's military, the combined force is very large. The most modern technology such as the Eurofighter, Challenger Tanks and the best weapons are given to this new force. With the creation of the EF, Europe becomes the fourth Superpower, joining the ranks of the USA, China and the MEC.</p>
<p>February, 2008: US forces in Manchuria are forced into full retreat. The US concedes that it has lost the war and begins to fortify the Pacific islands, fearing that the Chinese will retaliate. However, in the Middle East, things have been going very well for the US. After Mashtuur City in Iran was conquered, the US had a stable base. From there the country was occupied, and the MEC army pushed back to Afghanistan. The other wing of the army was pushed back from Kubra Dam and Saudi Arabia into Iraq. The city of Karkand is now the main base of the Western MEC army. So far it's been holding out, but the continued assaults will soon make it fall.</p>
<p>Resources are desperately needed in the Pacific to prevent a Chinese invasion. To help finish off the MEC, the US ask the EU to help in the war. Seeking to gain extra oilfields, the EU agree.</p>
<p>Invading Northern Iraq through Turkey, the latest EU member, the Euro Force begins Operation Smoke Screen. They plan to destroy MEC oil reserves and capture the oilfields for themselves. In the open deserts, large tank battles are the order of the day.</p>
<p>Trying to prevent the US from encircling Karkand, MEC tank brigades are slow to respond, and most of the oil reserves are destroyed. They make it in time to battle the EF, leaving scorching tank wrecks littered over Northern Iraq.</p>
<p>With the main MEC armour protecting the oilfields, the US finally storms Karkand, wiping out the last remnants of the Western MEC army. The EU forces, being driven back by the MEC armour, were eventually saved by the US army advancing north from Karkand.</p>
<p>In Iran, a US brigade turns north to assist the EU in Iraq. However, MEC forces in Northern Iran were larger than expected, and the US brigade was cut off. Now that the EF's mission was accomplished, part of the EF turned east from Turkey into Iran, to assist the US and eliminate the resistance in northern Iran. The MEC, fearful of being surrounded, fortify the only crossing point of the Taraba river, stopping the EF getting through. The US brigade was eliminated, but the MEC was weakened enough to be finished off by the EF forces. Leaving the assault in the east to the US, the EF occupied Iraq against local resistance.</p>
<p>However, the US once again pleaded for EF help, their retreat in Manchuria was being slowed by frequent PLA attacks. The EF was asked to attack from the north to ease the pressure on the US forces, and eventully link up, with the hope of stopping the PLA forces and remaining in China. MI6, using caputed intel from the ruined MEC base in Karkand, informed the Russians of the MEC's double deal with the Chechnyan Rebels and Russia. Russia agrees to let the EU march through Russia and to Mongolia to assist the US forces there.</p>
<p>July, 2008: The US holds the Manchurian coast, but not much more. The EF finally arrives after a long journey across Russia and attacks the Great Wall. While it may have stopped the Mongols, its no match for the EF, and they quickly overrun it, spearing into China. However, their supply lines are very thin, and a linkup with the US proves impossible. The US eventually abandon China completely, and the EU follows.</p>
<p>Chapter Six: Armoured Fury</p>
<p>September, 2008: Syria, Lebanon and Jordan, armed with brand new Russian-style tanks and planes, set sail into the Mediterranean. The US navy is completely comitted in the Pacific and cannot respond. The target is thought to be Europe, and the EU countries act individually. Instead of attacking the MEC Navy as a whole, they protect their own coasts. However, the MEC Navy heads past Spain and goes towards the US East Coast. The true target is now realised. Britain sends ships in pursuit, but all of its aircraft carriers are in the Persian Gulf, and it hasn't got the forces.</p>
<p>The US army is also mostly commited in the Pacific. Marines, National Guard and US Army Reserve units are sent to the East coast, but the exact landing place is unknown. The MEC make a successful landing in Delaware Bay. The Canadian Army, so far uncommited in the war, marches south from Toronto combined with US Armour. The MEC attack and take a key freeway junction, allowing them access for their tanks to most of the East Coast. From here, half move south to siege Washinton D.C, and the other half head north to meet the oncoming US-Canadian armour. The main battle ranges in the farmland of Lancaster County, where the peaceful civilians flee, leaving empty barns and cottages which are occupied and used for temporary bases. Thanks to the help of the Canadians and the MEC's lack of a real supply line, the MEC are defeated, although not without cost to the allied force.</p>
<p><br />
The DC National Guard finally fall, as does Washington. The White House and the Capitol are triumphantly destroyed. But even the MEC know that the large armies pincering them from north and south are unstoppable. The MEC swiftly follow the fate of the capital and are destroyed.</p>
<p><br />
November, 2008: With the US forces driven form their soil, the Chinese finally retaliate. Skipping the target of Hawaii, they head North and make landfall at Valdez, Alaska, near the Canadian Border. The US have stationed forces there, but they aren't enough. While the US Navy races north, the PLA's tanks and APCs steamroller over the American forces in Alaska, capturing Valdez, Anchorage, and Juneau, effectively controlling the state. Canada, with no forces even remotely in the area, eagerly accepts China's proposition of a neutrality pact. China, apparently satisfied with its conquest, begins peace talks with the US.</p>
<p><br />
Chapter Seven: The Road to Jalalabad</p>
<p><br />
October, 2008: Throughout the year, the MEC army has been battling the US in Afghanistan. For months they've been gradually pushed back towards the east fo their country. Both sides have taken huge losses, but the war shows no sign of ending. The EF occupies the Middle East and is unwilling to aid. Kabul, capital of Afghanistan, eventually falls. The only city left, before the Pakistani border, is Jalalabad. Here, the MEC plan to make their final stand. The US forces make an all out attack, decimating the city. But their supply lines stretch across the Middle East, and the MEC hold their ground.</p>
<p><br />
Chapter Eight: Endgame</p>
<p><br />
November, 2008: China and the US finally agree on a peace treaty. The Chinese will be allowed to keep Alaska, in return for not attacking the rest of the USA and the resumption of trade. In a surprise move, the Chinese declare alliance with the MEC, and state that any further action against them will have dire consequences for the US. Militarily crippled, the US knows it cannot hold all its conquests, and retreats to the Iran/Iraq border.</p>
<p><br />
Chapter Nine: Age of the Superpowers</p>
<p>2009: With MAD (Mutually Assured Destruction) no longer a way to avoid world war, the nations of the Earth begin to form superpowers. Everyon witnessed the countries of Kuwait, Oman, the UAE and others get dragged into a war, as they were too weak to resist.</p>
<p>The PRC and the MEC become full allies, creating the Pan Asian Coalition. Russia, despite aiding the EU army, is invited to join and accepts. India, geographically seperated from Europe and America, also joins rather than become isolated.</p>
<p>The EU invites the crippled USA and Canada into the EU, and combines all their militaries to create a much larger Euro Force.</p>
<p>The nations of Africa, protecting their oil and mining rights, create the highly unstable UAS, the Union of African States.</p>
<p>Although historically safe in WW1 and 2, Brazil, Argentina, Mexico and Veneuzuela combine to form the SAC, the South American Confederacy. Most of the other nations swiftly join them.</p>
<p>Australia and New Zealand, traditionally allies of Britian, declare themselves allied to each other, but neutral to any future conflicts. This agreement is called the Neutrality Pact.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The borders of the World have changed. Eurasia is now split by the Steel Curtain. Alaska is occupied by the PAC. Religious barriers begin to be cast aside as countries ally simply for protection. It is the beginning fo the Second Cold War, but that war is about to get even colder...</p>

<dd>I think you are confused about what a game guide is. A game guide is where there are tips and hints and instructions and non-objective things like that.

Oh and if I may further comment, it's not like it's a single "rogue" editor out madly slashing articles.

<p>What is the obsession with deleting sub-articles? When articles reach a certain size, sections are broken off into new articles. This is common in Wikipedia across all large articles.</p>
<p>This article is 47 kilobytes long, well over the 32 kilobyte <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticle_size_0593.html" title="Wikipedia:Article size">recommended</a> maximum. Sections had been broken off into new sub-articles.</p>
<p>Now we have certain editors with an obsession with deleting those sub-articles. The reasons given are some of the most irrational possible. They reason they gave was that the articles contained game guide information. The other reason was that they were <a href="../../../c/r/u/Cruft.html" title="Cruft">cruft</a>. Cruft means old or decrepit.</p>
<p>Battlefield 2 is played by over a million people. Do they regard it as old and decrepit? Instead of removing any game guide contributions their solution was to delete the whole sub-articles. Absurdity to the extreme!</p>
<p>All the information contained in the deleted articles can not go back into this article because it is already too big. The sub-articles have to be recreated. --<a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikiCats_43d6.html" title="User:WikiCats">WikiCats</a> 12:44, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If you recall, the peer review only contained the opinion of a few users who thought the easter egg section would restrain the page from reaching FA status, but not giving much reasoning for this opinion other than "it has no real relevance to anything" but I completely disagree with this sentiment. I wholeheartedly disagree with the removal of the Easter Egg section, though I DO agree that a big cleanup of the section needed to occur. I would have agreed with removal of all the easter egg pictures (one of the peer reviewers mentioned the fact that there were more pics illustrating the easter eggs than the actual game itself, and I agree with him that this is a bad idea) and condensing of the actual info, featuring at most one or two lines describing each easter egg. Easter eggs are a notable feature of any game that contains them (and it's not like editors can have difficulty providing verifiability) and, especially considering the multitude of these eggs in BF2, I believe they are worthwhile additions to any video or computer game article. <a href="../../../6/9/2E/User%7E69.124.143.230.html" title="User:69.124.143.230">69.124.143.230</a> 00:35, 3 October 2006 (UTC)

<p>Oh, and also, this here statement has me feeling uneasy. "It was scheduled for release in February, but was delayed due to a substantial amount of new bugs caused by the release of patch 1.2." While it was true there was some bugs along the way, I believe the main concern with it's delay was staff being laid off and being shifted around. I can find you something that can hint that, but I think a source from EA explaining the above statement. It just sounds like someone is assuming since Dice has programmed pretty shity patches, that this was the sole reason.--<a href="../../../h/e/l/User%7EHellogoodsir_0047.html" title="User:Hellogoodsir">Hellogoodsir</a> 03:57, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I hope the editting I added to the Gameplay section is acceptable. I had noticed, when reading it that it could use some extra explanation (such as "ticket bleed") and so I added said material with a ref/cite. (Yes, I am a new Wikipedian, but hopefully I've not gone outside community standards in this update.) As a second part -- is there any way I can add a link to the +GRID+ clan website (who is responsible for the tutorial I used as a reference... but does not host said tutorial themselves at the moment, due to their personal clan website being overhauled)?</p>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Mentions of stat inflation on the ranking section.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>What do you mean by this? From the way it's worded and vaguely described, I feel this will be more from original research based on bias and opinion.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Mentions and maybe a sub section dealing with hacking and game glitching like the in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter_strike#Hacking" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter_strike#Hacking" rel="nofollow">Counter Strike article</a>.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I believe that the existence of the article about Counterstrike's cheats and hacks is justified because it is comprehensive. However, for Battlefield 2, reliable and neutral information about cheats/hacks for this game will most likely be limited. Then there's the chance that this section would become a summary of cheating/hacking in PC games in general.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>How about some mentions or links to some unsupported battlefield 2 tournaments.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Directly in the article of Battlefield 2? No, as of right now, the article is clean of any mentions of 3rd party programs or additions. However, you could link and create a Wikipedia article about these tournaments, similar to how the list of Battlefield 2 mods has its own article (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Battlefield_2_mods" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Battlefield_2_mods" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Battlefield_2_mods</a>) linked under the "See Also" section.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Move the system requirements up or remove them.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>This I have to agree of moving it up, possibly before the Reception section so that the quote "but added a disclaimer that the gaming experience is best if your machine is up to it'" in that section will have more sense to the readers.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Move the map list down.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It's part of the features of Battlefield 2, that section as a whole seems to be appropriately placed. It would seem a bit awkward for a branch of this section (maplist) to be inbetween or within the miscellaneous and expansion/booster sections of Battlefield 2.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Add more pictures especially to the booster pack section</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Nothing wrong with that so long as it's only maybe 2 or 3 more, most showing the expansion/booster packs.</p>

<p>At first, I was "cropping" out statements and paragraphs of the criticism section due to biased opinionated perspective, speculation, and no citations. It appears the whole section should either be erased or reformed. If I remember correctly, this section was more appropriate than it is now. I'm simply going to revert this section to what it was (if there was). <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by BirdKr (<a href="../../../b/i/r/User_talk%7EBirdKr_1e75.html" title="User talk:BirdKr">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_BirdKr_b015.html" title="Special:Contributions/BirdKr">contribs</a>) 12:17, 22 December 2006 (UTC).</small></p>
<p>Seems there isn't, who here also favors deleting the article until it is written in a more appropriate manner? To be more specific, I feel this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>If one were to take a passing glance at the amount of complaining that went on about various aspects of BF2, it is quite possible that one reason for problems was EA's apparent lack of communication with fans; whether it was communication to fans about which problems were being addressed and why, or communication from fans about what problems existed. This seemed only to cause more aggravation and uproar. Seemingly in response to these issued, DICE at one point introduced a community manager charged with the task of collecting information on issues that were common among the community, as well as relaying the information back to those working on the patch...</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>and the rest of the paragraph that follows needs to cite sources, clean up on perspective, and cut the speculation.</p>
<p>The whole section is written in slight POV and is totally unsourced. That's why I had the "OR" tag on it, but it was removed. I will put it back until there are sources or if the entire section is removed. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlacklist_b0a6.html" title="User:Blacklist">Blacklist</a> 22:16, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Please read the above section titled \'Reactions and criticisms\' of this discussion page. I specifically put in that area my reasoning for why I added this piece to the article and it also explains the lack of sources. You\'ve all obviously either ignored it or simply not realised that is where I explained my reasoning for putting criticism in the article and why more importantly I did not cite any sources. It was not simply because I didn\'t have any, it\'s because of the sheer number that exist in the forums. If you\'re so hungry for source then I gladly point you in the direction of the EAUK forums and the TotalBF2 forums, and even the EAUS forums where you\'ll find posts on every subject mentioned in my part of the article over the last year indicating none of it was \'biased\' or formed on \'my opinion alone\'.</p>
<dl>
<dd>First, I am aware of these forums and I frequently do browse these forums, especially TotalBF2. In most of these threads, they are mere speculation and accusations that have no reference or citation. Even if you add in these references, the article will be referencing a reference that has no reference/reliable source nor any credibility. I wouldn't mind if you created an article that pointed out flaws referenced by reliable sources than conspiracy theories from fellow BF2 members. If you believe these threads and posts are credible, then it shouldn't be too difficult to pinpoint the essence that supports these claims as fact. And by essence, I do not mean the opinion of users and its popularity (popular opinion =/= fact). Finally, just because there are "supposedly" sheer number of threads relating to these claims does not excuse the fact that you must cite your sources. --BirdKr 14:54, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As BirdKr pointed out, forum posts are not <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>, and often the result of <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>.

<dd>If not members of the community, who then is qualified to provide "credible" information? Who is qualified to be cited as "a credible source"? Do you really expect that EA or Dice are going to come here and fill out a Wiki report on issues like these? Or that one of the gaming magazines, on or offline, are going to do it?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Think again! EA has companies like these in its pockets. They need EA to provide them with the all important "exclusive first look" at upcoming titles in order to "report" (if it can be called such, dependant as they are on EA’s good graces) back to the community what <i>they</i> "thought" of the game. They need EA to provide them with the means by which they stay in business; keeping viewership high. Without these exclusives, they would simply fade away.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Do you really believe that they are going to do the community justice by ratting on EA's flag-ship titles? No, indeed what we see is them falling over themselves to assign high marks to products that are clearly and indeed have proven to be deeply flawed. I point out that the vast majority of these flaws are well documented <i>by the community</i> while gaming mags hardly say a word about them.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Reporting on hundreds of voices all yelling the same thing has to count for a little more than some people around here are willing to give credit for. Some people here assert that the community is an important though unreliable, incredible source. I tell you the gaming magazines are just as bad, if not worse, showing a particular bias toward publishers in order to maintain their own livelihoods rather than do any true journalism.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>When journalistic sources cannot be trusted, the community is all that is left. And while citing community opinion does involve original research, it has to start somewhere. I am dismayed to see this section was removed, <i>yet again</i> and I have to wonder if those who persist in removing it aren’t themselves either biased or perhaps in some way themselves connected with EA; employees or shareholders perhaps.

Although I too have some grudge against EA, I know that I cannot vent or support any unreliable claims that have no verifiable proof; we have the forums for that. Wikipedia however, is not a forum nor a mouthpiece of the community, it's an article where only facts are told. Furthermore, this, the discussion page, is also not the place to vent against EA, but more to improve the article. Some of the claims and mentions you (Braidedheaman) made feel more of a monologue than an input to discuss how to improve or revise this article...I think that's what a "soapbox" is I guess.</dd>

<p>Regular BF fans will no doubt know the difference between these two, but not regular readers. After all, both games have the same name "Battlefield 2".

<dd>I support a patch list for both BF2 and BF2142. I think a brief overview of patch contents is not going to add large amounts of text to the article. At the same time Battlefield games have often been regarded as being buggy, having a patch overview gives readers a good indication of how they were patched and what the main issues were. In general patch lists for games on a wiki page is unneeded but for Battlefield 2 and 2142 I think patches are a very important part of the games and indicate the level of support after the release. Having said that the majority don't seem to agree so I didn't bother re adding the small patch overview to the 2142 article.nutcrackr 23:49, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You've gone around in a circle. Why would a patch list be unacceptable for other games, but acceptable for the <i>Battlefield</i> series? There are far buggier games out there. As I said above, if there are <i>notable</i> patches that fix major gameplay elements, mention them in the article. There isn't a need to include a list of patches as raw data. --<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottie_theNerd_0b10.html" title="User:Scottie theNerd">Scottie theNerd</a> 01:33, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I didn't say they were unacceptable, I just said they were unneeded. There are far buggier games yes but BF series has been particularly criticized for it's lack of support post release, a patch list is a good quick reference to show more than just the fixes. I'm really unsure why there isn't a need to include a very brief overview of patches released. Just about all the other information on this wiki can be gathered from other sites, map list for example. Patch list with the major fixes is not something that is easy to acquire without trawling through individual links at download sites. nutcrackr 08:14, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>First, I would be against patch list solely being there just to indicate the bugginess of BF2. The patch list is there just to inform readers about the patches themselves. Previously, there were mentions of bugs and glitches but were cleaned out since it bloated the section and few crossed the line of original research and non-neutral perspective if I remember correctly. About the map list, I would prefer it to be in place since it informs the readers of what maps are available in BF2...albeit not informative nor useful after that (maybe a link to one of BF2's info sites will be acceptable)? Another alternative could be creating a section that talks about the maps in general, referencing some of the maps, and mentioning the map scaling feature which I think is an important feature of BF2 as commander mode and squad structures are. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by BirdKr (<a href="../../../b/i/r/User_talk%7EBirdKr_1e75.html" title="User talk:BirdKr">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_BirdKr_b015.html" title="Special:Contributions/BirdKr">contribs</a>) 14:37, 27 January 2007 (UTC).</small></dd>

<p>I removed all the unneeded info about them. Remember guys this is not Stratagy Wiki, talking about what types of weapons will can be subsituted for whitch and carrying on into so much detail that no one who does not play the game will read is not good for Wikipedia. <a href="../../../p/l/a/User%7EPlanb11_efb4.html" title="User:Planb11">Planb11</a> 01:46, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Replaced the list. A brief description of how the class system works is far more useful than a list of classes --<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottie_theNerd_0b10.html" title="User:Scottie theNerd">Scottie theNerd</a> 03:47, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Assuming that I have time to spare, I guess I should compile a list to improve the article:</p>
<p>-Add in citations and references for the Gameplay and Features section. There's a huge gap of citations between the section before these two mentioned sections and the section after them.</p>
<ul>
<li>My priority</li>
</ul>
<p>-Add in more screenshots in the Gameplay/Features section</p>
<ul>
<li>My priority</li>
</ul>
<p><s>*I do not yet know how to upload/post images in Wikipedia however.</s></p>
<p><s>-Change the map section: removing the table of maps, informing about the maps in general, and mentioning the map scaling feature.</s></p>
<ul>
<li>Revised and posted</li>
<li>Needs improvement in writing</li>
</ul>
<p><s>*Need to add in a single image that displays 3 variations of the selected map</s></p>
<p>-See if the expansion pack / booster pack section could be improved. There were one or two editors who noted that it seemed to be more of an advertisement than being neutral.</p>

<dd>Agreed with changes, especially the map list. A list of map names by itself isn't particular helpful to readers who don't play the game; a paragraph outlining the variety of maps is more accessible and appropriate. --<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottie_theNerd_0b10.html" title="User:Scottie theNerd">Scottie theNerd</a> 12:23, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/t/Talk%7EBattlefield_2_609e.html" title="Edit section: Drafting the map article">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Drafting the map article</span></h2>
<p>Here's my rough draft of the map section. This is clearly not written well that it itself should not be presented into the article. I will also make corrections and revisions to this draft:</p>
<p><br /></p>
<hr />
<p>Battlefield 2 offers 14 maps for the players to play. These maps are diverse which ranges from jungles such as Shongua Stalemate, urban areas such as Strike at Karkand, to an unfinished Dam known as Kubra Dam. The USMC is present in all maps and faces against either against the MEC or the PLA depending on the map. PLA is present in Far East theaters such as Dragon Valley and Daqing Oilfields. MEC is present in Middle East theaters such as Gulf of Oman and Zatar Wetlands.</p>
<p>The unique feature about BF2 maps is that each map has 3 variations that is suited for certain number of players. Each map has 16, 32, and 64 player-suggested variations in which the area of battlefield or playing field is relatively small, medium, and large, respectively. Other contrasts between these variations other than the size is the difference in the number and position of control points and the availability and number of certain vehicles. As a result, the gameplay of the map is different depending on the variation.<sup id="_ref-Gamespot_review_page_2_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Gamespot_review_page_2" title="">[1]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Battlefield_2_Map_Information_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Battlefield_2_Map_Information" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<hr />
<p>Last revised on 3-11-07</p>
<p><br />
For starters, the second last sentence needs to be rewritten. I presented this rough draft so that any interested editors will have an idea of what is to be said about BF2 maps. Finding sources should be relatively easy, especially if I look in the past interviews.</p>
