<ul>
<li>Delete. For the obvious reasons, although I do love the book Animal Farm - if you've not read it, go down to the library and get a copy&#160;:) <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarksun_f33c.html" title="User:Darksun">Darksun</a> 12:51, 3 Aug 2004 (UTC)</li>
<li><del>Delete:</del> I was thinking of a way to keep it from coming back, and I thought that a redirect would do it. Naturally, there should be a redirect to <a href="../../../a/n/i/Animal_Farm_e7d2.html" title="Animal Farm">Animal Farm</a> <b>or</b>, I thought, to <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Cowpens_3014.html" title="Battle of Cowpens">Battle of Cowpens</a>, a notable battle in the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Revolutionary_War_48ec.html" title="American Revolutionary War">American Revolutionary War</a>, and then I found out that, although articles refer to this battle, and it's on the list of battles, no one has written it yet. So, if there are Revolutionary War fans, here is a needed article. As for this, redirect to <a href="../../../a/n/i/Animal_Farm_e7d2.html" title="Animal Farm">Animal Farm</a>. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 13:58, 3 Aug 2004 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm going to look again on its last day, but I've got to say that that table sure makes this article funny, even with the text on the left telling us explicitly that it isn't. There's something truly <a href="../../../b/a/t/Bathos.html" title="Bathos">bathetic</a> about putting a historical battle template up on a funny passage in a fictional book. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 00:56, 8 Aug 2004 (UTC)</li>
<li>Abstain: Look, it's still bathetic. That table gives me the giggles yet. I don't think we're a lot better off having it, but the left side (done by the VfD voters, mainly) makes up for the eyebrow arching oddity of the right side. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 02:55, 9 Aug 2004 (UTC)</li>

<li>I laughed when I read it - the best wiki-joke in ages, and I would love to be able to keep it. But if we do everyone out there will insist on a page for every fictional battle of <i>their</i> favourite book/tv series.

<li>Don't Delete: WHY DO YOU THINK THIS IS A JOKE! IT IS A REAL EVENT FROM ANIMAL FARM! IT IS IN CHPATER IV.-B-101 8/3/04 5:11
<ul>
<li>Thanks for giving the reference. However, nobody is questioning that George Orwell's book, <i>Animal Farm,</i> does include a description of a "Battle of the Cowshed." However, Animal Farm is a work of fiction and nothing in it is "a real event" (even though the events in it closely parallel the history of the Soviet Union). The use of the article box did not seem like the work of someone unsophisticated, so I (and apparently others) assumed that it was a straight-faced, deadpan joke. If you wrote the article, perhaps you are into fantasy-role-playing and like to feign a belief in the events of Animal Farm; if so, I am sorry if we hurt your feelings. If you actually believe that the events in "Animal Farm" are real events, then I am concerned about you. Perhaps you simply feel that rich, substantial works of fantasy (Tolkien, the Harry Potter books, etc). deserve to be treated as if they were real, with individual articles on individual events, characters, artifacts, etc. If so, I respectfully disagree. A final problem is that the article box really presents nothing useful. A paragraph describing which specific historical event the Battle of the Cowshed corresponds to would, however, be a good addition to the Animal Farm article. [[User:Dpbsmith|<a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a>]] 23:07, 3 Aug 2004 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't know who you are, just like you don't know who I am. But, I assure you, I KNOW PERFECTLY WELL THE BOOK IS A WORK OF FICTION! I put it were it belongs: under fictional battles. I know it is fiction.-B-101 <i>(oh, and by "real", I meant the battle is canon. I know it didn't actually occur.)</i></li>
<li>We do in fact have many articles such as you describe. See, for example <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Middle-earth_articles_6a7b.html" title="List of Middle-earth articles">List of Middle-earth articles</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Harry_Potter_articles_3810.html" title="List of Harry Potter articles">List of Harry Potter articles</a>. There is therefore precedent for an article on this topic. However, the article in it's current form is not acceptable, as it provides no context and says nothing except what is in the standardized box. So... <b>delete</b> unless enough information is added to warrant a separate article. <a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EEric119_9f87.html" title="User:Eric119">Eric119</a> 04:36, Aug 4, 2004 (UTC)</li>
<li>Okay, but we don't need to delete it then. We can just add more info from the book.-B-101
<ul>
<li>Go ahead. It's perfectly OK to edit an article while it's being discussed in VfD. It's even encouraged. Votes often change as a result. Many VfD discussions end with people voting or changing their votes to "Keep in present form" or "Keep improved article."

<li>I think the article is good enough to not be deleted. I think we should remove the deletion notice and just tweak the page a little more.-B-101</li>

<li>Keep if content expanded.

<li>I rewrote the article, so you can decide if it's good enough. However, it may need a little more tweaking.-B-101

</li>
<li>As the details of the incident have been considerably expanded, my vote is now a firm keep. Would like to see an addition paragraph devoted to the outcome of the battle: what is the current command structure on the farm? <a href="../../../d/w/i/User%7EDwindrim_6e1c.html" title="User:Dwindrim">Denni</a><a href="../../../d/w/i/User_talk%7EDwindrim_bafa.html" title="User talk:Dwindrim"><font color="#228822">☯</font></a> 22:19, 2004 Aug 8 (UTC)

<p>What did you mean with the "current command structure of the farm"? Did you mean who was currently in charge?- <a href="../../../b/-/1/User%7EB-101_6b01.html" title="User:B-101">B-101</a> 19:26, 29 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>My reading of the book leads me to understand that the man that Boxer hits in the head lays "lifeless" on the ground, but he is not actually dead. We are left to understand that Boxer believes that he has killed him, however quite soon afterward the book states that the man has disappeared - leading me to believe that he appeared lifeless, but actually was knocked unconscious - not killed. If anyone else agrees, we should ammend the table to the side that indicates that one human was killed.</p>

<p>The article accurately states that Napoleon's propaganda later painted Snowball as a coward who did not participate. However, a later revision by Napoleon claimed that Snowball was actually leading the human forces and shouting "Long live humanity!" until Napoleon supposedly appeared at the climax and bit Jones on the leg while proclaiming "Death to humanity!"</p>
