<p>The United States Navy only accounted for 4% of convoy duty. You can take my word for that.</p>
<dl>
<dd>That's only true in a very narrow sense. For most of 1942 and early 1943, the US was indeed only represented on the main North Atlantic convoy route by a few coast-guard cutters and the occasional destroyer (Escort Group A3). But that ignores: US Navy escorts for all fast HX and ON convoys through the western half of the Atlantic from September to December 1941, US efforts to protect shipping off the US coasts and in the Carribbean from 1942 onwards, US Navy escorts for troop convoys, the contribution of US hunter-killer groups from 1943 onwards, the mid-Atlantic convoy route (US-Gibraltar) that was almost entirely escorted by US ships, and the fact that about a quarter of Atlantic merchant shipping was American.

<p>This sentence is scientifically wrong: "These were typically visited by warships only, and the majority of the fleet then underwent a massive degaussing process, where their magnetic fields were reduced to such a degree that it was no longer "noticed" by the mines."</p>
<p>The magnetic field was NOT reduced, since the mines used the concentration of the magnetic field of the Earth induced by the hull of the ships. Thus the magnetic field could not possibly be reduced (unless this degaussing actually changed the magnetic field of the whole Earth, which would have been quite an achievement and a problem, since the compasses wouldn't be working nowadays). Anyways. What they actually DID was to INCREASE the magnetic field of the ships and thus make the mines sense the ships from far away, and detonate too early.--<a href="../../../m/s/o/User%7EMsoos_77a1.html" title="User:Msoos">Msoos</a> 10:45, 17 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The field of the ships is caused by the slow magnetization of them as they sail with a fixed heading. For instance, if they sail directly north for a period of time, the ship will eventually have a field aligned in that direction. Ships were specifically instructed to vary course continuously for this reason, as well as to avoid submarines.</dd>
<dd>See for instance <a href="http://jwgibbs.cchem.berkeley.edu/CFGoodeve/cfg_bio.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://jwgibbs.cchem.berkeley.edu/CFGoodeve/cfg_bio.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, you will note that the very term <i>degausing</i> was in fact invented during this process.</dd>

<dd>I am no expert, but the text now simply does not explain degaussing clearly enough. Maybe it is good for someone who knows what degaussing is, but for the layman, not. I am not saying that we should have 20 lines explaining what it is, but the brief explanation should be understandable. Please re-phrase, as I am no expert and you seem so!

<p>Actually the degaussing article was pretty bad too, so I rewrote it too. <a href="../../../m/a/u/User%7EMaury_Markowitz_e29a.html" title="User:Maury Markowitz">Maury</a> 14:07, 28 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Just a quick comment -- That rewrite looks pretty good to me! (And I do have a slightly closer association with the <a href="http://jwgibbs.cchem.berkeley.edu/CFGoodeve/magmine.html" class="external text" title="http://jwgibbs.cchem.berkeley.edu/CFGoodeve/magmine.html" rel="nofollow">topic</a> than some...(:-))</dd>
<dd>And a clarification regarding the first couple of paragraphs above: 'Wiping' warships <i>did</i> reduce the field -- as seen by the <i>mine</i>. It did this by inducing a <i>reverse</i> (remanent) field in the hull that was just enough to balance the one induced by the Earth's magnetism. With this protection, the ship could pass safely over the mine without detonating it. To actually detonate mines safely, a strong pulsed magnetic field was used, produced by current from cables traling behind wooden-hulled minesweepers. -- Pete Goodeve -- 128.32.198.8 22:12, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Wow, and I thought my great uncle a little paranoid when he talked about the need of the UK to ignore the contribution of the "colonies". The RCN contributed greatly to the Battle of the Atlantic as did the Canadian merchant marine. On my first read of the article I wondered about the sole reference to the Canadian navy. Then I spotted the picture from St. Johns with the caption "Empire Sailors". The picture postdates the Balfour Declaration by 15 years and the Statute of Westminster by 10. At the time the picture was taken, Canada was not part of the Empire and was a self-determining nation. I think I will be taking some time to fill out this article over the next few weeks. OK OK I admit I am overreacting - it is a good article, in need of a little balance. Mkimanderson 01:46, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>First off, since the many recent additions have been made, this article has become incredibly unbalanced. There is absolutely no reason why the Mine Threat should deserve 8 paragraphs when the role of air power receives only one. This goes the same for support groups.</p>
<p>Although it brings out most of the main points, this article is disjointed and wrongly weighted.</p>
<p>As for the RCN, it is true the part they played has been underestimated somewhat. The pre-war strength of the RNC was 6 destroyers and 5 minesweepers increasing to 3 cruisers, 28 destroyers, 70 frigates 122 corvettes and 60 minesweepers in 1945 (1). These took time to come into service, however, and a number were obsolete. The RCN's escort fleet anywhere around 18 months behind the RN in fitting new detection technologies and other key pieces of equipment. When the RCN was put on to active duty, many of the sailors and escorts were found to be of inferior quality and required additional training. Thus, some were removed from important Atlantic operations to gain experience and such training elsewhere, although the RNC did run its own section of the escorting service (almost numerically half at one point!). This came after March 1943, however, when the RNC was given its own 'Canadian NorthWest Atlantic section'. The RNC came of age unfortunately late. As the Second Battle of the Atlantic was effectively over by 1943 the RCN's input can, and has, been described as 'quantitativeley important but qualitatively poor'(2). The RNC's input into the Second Battle of the Atlantic is unquestionably important, as despite the fact that they performed badly and lost a higher proportion of ships, by just being there the RNC doubtless averted many more lives and ships being lost. A poorly escorted convoy is better than an unescorted one.</p>
<p>I would like to re-iterate my point that this article needs re-structuring and re-weighting.</p>

<dd>Have a look at the tonnage sunk figures after 1943, in particular in 1944 before the loss of the land connection to the channel ports. Also, in May 43 Doenitz withdrew all boats from the battle for a number of months, due to unacceptable losses, and they never really came back after that. I think decisive victory is quite appropriate. The Germans were completely beaten in the battle, due to lack of technological progress, failure to fight a combined air-sea battle, and an absence of appropriate counter-intelligence procedures. Why do you think 'decisive' is not appropriate? <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndreas1968_bd6b.html" title="User:Andreas1968">Andreas</a> 14:07, 27 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes there were significant losses. That does not make it a less decisive victory. In the end, the Atlantic was pretty safe to get across. The German U-Boat arm had been decisively beaten. In the same way that the Allies had a decisive victory at the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Waterloo_202f.html" title="Battle of Waterloo">Battle of Waterloo</a>, despite the fact that they lost almost the same number of men as the French. Or in the same way as the Germans were decisively beaten in World War II, even though all their enemies took substantial losses in the process.

<p>Regarding the most recent reversion. It was a six-year campaign, but it had been won (decisively) by May 1943. The tonnage numbers outlined above, and Dönitz'decision to withdraw from the Atlantic during summer 1943, make that very clear. It certainly was not an 'eventual' victory, which sounds like the Allies just won because the Germans no longer wanted to fight. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndreas1968_bd6b.html" title="User:Andreas1968">Andreas</a> 12:28, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think there's a difference between decisive and overwhelming. The campaign was 'decisive' in the sense that it decided an issue or contributed to a decision. Had the Axis powers won, the war would have turned out differently. So this was a decisive victory. Whether it was an overwhelming victory, a narrow one or a phyrric one is a different point.

<p>The section under "Hunter-Killer groups" says this: "Formed into hunter-killer groups (one of the major tactical reasons for the victory)". This statement appears to be contrary to modern understanding of the actual causes of submarine destruction in the war.</p>
<p>Most modern accounts (see John Keegan's <i>The Second World War</i> and <i>The Price of Admiralty</i> and Ronald Spector's <i>Eagle Against the Sun</i>) agree that the hunter-killer effort was misguided and largely wasted. Convoy grouped the targeted merchant vessels and forced submarines to expose themselves to escorts in order to attack. Submarines simply submerged and avoided Hunter-Killer groups, which found themselves searching a largely empty ocean. Sailboatd2 12:08, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>You should read the work of Prof. Jürgen Rohwer (a German) about the role of the Italian submarines in Atlantic (Die italienischen U-Boote in der Schlacht im Atlantik 1940-43). He praises the Italian role and fournishes following informations: The 32 Italian submarines in Atlantic sunk 109 ships (= 593,864 T.) among them the Ocean Liner "Empress of Canada" (1943). The best Italian submarine of WWII was the "Da Vinci" which sunk 120,243 T., this means more than the best American submarine (the "Flasher" with 100,231 T.) and more than the best British submarine (the "Upholder" with 97,722 T.).

<p>I’ve restructured and rewritten large parts of this article to try to improve it and, perhaps, move it a little closer to featured article status. I should explain why I’ve made these changes:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>In places, the article was simply wrong.</b> For instance, at one point it said that ‘the RN had yet to institute the policy of convoys, primarily because it slows all of the boats down to the speed of the slowest member.’ But the British actually introduced the first convoys <i>before</i> the outbreak of war.</li>
<li><b>Other parts were misleading.</b> For instance, it said that the RAF was able to counter the U-boats and ‘the Western Approaches were soon cleared of the threat’ by the RAF. This simply isn’t true of the first years of the campaign. The RAF lacked the aircraft, weapons, training and tactics to pose more than an irritation to the U-boats until at least 1941, arguably 1942. At another point, the article stated that British destroyers ‘were able to block the exits into the North Sea and the Channel with some success’. This simply isn’t true of the North Sea – and the British weren’t even able to block the entrance to Scapa Flow in 1939.</li>
<li><b>The article was (and still is a bit) unbalanced.</b> The Leigh Light had a whole section to itself. There are some excellent sections on mining and elektroboots, but these are minor aspects of the overall campaign. I’m not convinced a long section on mining – by definition confined to shallow coastal waters rather than the open ocean – even belongs in an article of the Battle of the Atlantic.</li>
<li><b>The role of the smaller Allied navies was (and still is) underplayed.</b> The huge Canadian contribution to the campaign is hardly mentioned, while the participation of ships manned by Norwegian, Polish, Free French, Dutch and other Allied crews is not mentioned at all.</li>
<li><b>It didn’t convey the ebb and flow of the campaign.</b> Although the overall structure of the article was chronological, some parts of the story were in the wrong place.</li>
<li><b>There was too much emphasis on individual warship types.</b> Too much credit was given to the introduction of Type VIIC U-boats and River-class frigates. What really mattered was not so much that the Type VIIC was a superb design, but that the Germans mass produced it in sufficient numbers to create real problems for the Allied convoy escorts. Similarly, the frigates were good ships, but they were not particularly fast and there were relatively few of them before 1944.</li>
<li><b>Few of the main personalities were mentioned.</b> With the exception of Dönitz, none of the most important or colourful commanders were mentioned – like Günther Prien, Otto Kretschmer, Johnnie Walker or Max Horton.</li>
<li><b>Only one ship was mentioned by name.</b> Seemed a shame really.</li>
</ul>

<li>Thanks for all your changes Jimmy. This article is much better than it used to be.
