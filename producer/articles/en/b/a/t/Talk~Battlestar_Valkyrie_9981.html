	    <p>I don't think we should consign this one to an already long list just because the ship has only appeared in one episode to date. There's enough information here to justify a separate page, and it's not like Wikipedia is dying for storage space! Besides, it was a stub before. Expanding it only to have it relagated to redirect status seems a bit silly!&#160;:-) <a href="../../../s/u/l/User%7ESullivan.t.j_e533.html" title="User:Sullivan.t.j">Sullivan.t.j</a> 19:15, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It doesn't matter — This page wouldn't survive an AfD, we don't want these pages ending up like Star Trek ones now do we? This page may never grow.. we don't know.. should the time arise when it has been in more episodes then "Hero" then it should be given an article (PS: Your content isn't lost, it's been merged to the list.)<small><font face="Tahoma"><b>thanks</b>/Fenton, Matthew Lexic Dark <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_MatthewFenton_0db4.html" title="Special:Contributions/MatthewFenton">52278 Alpha 771</a></font></small> 19:17, 20 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Are you really so sure that it wouldn't survive an AfD? I appreciate that some people prefer lists to separate pages, and that's a matter of preference. The mere fact that the <i>Valkyrie</i> has appeared in only one episode doesn't mean that it does not deserve its own page. In my view, it's about the amount of informational content: one character, place or ship might acquire great importance in one appearance, or little in many. The way I see it, there's enough to be said about the <i>Valkyrie</i> that to say it all produces a long, badly-formatted section in the list (note how the sections work, or don't), compared to a readble, albeit relatively short, article all of its own. I usually play around in the maths pages, and there are plenty of worth but short articles there!&#160;:-) <a href="../../../s/u/l/User%7ESullivan.t.j_e533.html" title="User:Sullivan.t.j">Sullivan.t.j</a> 19:30, 20 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>We could take it to AfD.. I'd prefer not to because it is great content.. that won't be lost as a redirect and can always be turned back into an article should it appear in future episodes.. as it stands <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_miscellaneous_ships_in_Battlestar_Galactica_%282004%29_93bd.html" title="List of miscellaneous ships in Battlestar Galactica (2004)">List of miscellaneous ships in Battlestar Galactica (2004)</a> is starting to look pretty nice and it makes sense for it to go there..&#160;:-). <small><font face="Tahoma"><b>thanks</b>/Fenton, Matthew Lexic Dark <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_MatthewFenton_0db4.html" title="Special:Contributions/MatthewFenton">52278 Alpha 771</a></font></small> 19:34, 20 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Why not let it stand as a separate article? If it's good content, why not let it help to populate a rather sparsely populated category? Since the article has enough content, it is split into subsections; since it is split into subsections, it breaks the flow of the list when included there. My point is that "one appearance" is not enough to condemn a person, ship or locale to list status: was the good old <i>Galactica</i> denied a page of her own before "33" aired?&#160;:-) Also, I must note that the Norse mythology section was not ported to the list. <a href="../../../s/u/l/User%7ESullivan.t.j_e533.html" title="User:Sullivan.t.j">Sullivan.t.j</a> 19:58, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>P.S., to re-iterate: this article was a stub before, and wasn't consigned to list then. Moving it to the list now that it has been expanded seems rather strange. <a href="../../../s/u/l/User%7ESullivan.t.j_e533.html" title="User:Sullivan.t.j">Sullivan.t.j</a> 20:03, 20 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The problem is though it may <i>never</i> grow past what you've wrote, if it does then the page is <i>still</i> here to be restored and expanded. If our worried about the ToC then I've fixed this on the list page now as well. Seriously though.. take it to AfD as procedural.. it just wouldn't survive at present, if anything the "Notability police" would proclaim it non-notable. <small><font face="Tahoma"><b>thanks</b>/Fenton, Matthew Lexic Dark <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_MatthewFenton_0db4.html" title="Special:Contributions/MatthewFenton">52278 Alpha 771</a></font></small> 20:08, 20 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>In reply to your PS: That was because there where no links to it.. so no one knew it existed until you made a reference at the list. <small><font face="Tahoma"><b>thanks</b>/Fenton, Matthew Lexic Dark <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_MatthewFenton_0db4.html" title="Special:Contributions/MatthewFenton">52278 Alpha 771</a></font></small> 20:08, 20 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Again, there's plenty of scope for links to be created --- I just hadn't done them at the time you made your transfer. Links to <i>Valkyrie</i> from <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Adama_6d54.html" title="William Adama">William Adama</a>, <a href="../../../s/a/u/Saul_Tigh_1bbd.html" title="Saul Tigh">Saul Tigh</a>, <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battlestar.html" title="Battlestar">Battlestar</a> and the episode page, for example. Lack of room for expansion is <i>not</i> a sufficient criterion for de-articling and transferring to a list. Are we to do this to every article with no possibility of expansion? <a href="../../../e/l/l/Ellen_Tigh_cc93.html" title="Ellen Tigh">Ellen Tigh</a>, for example, despite her impact on the series? No, it's about the size of the article: this one is well over the couple of paragraphs max that a list entry should be. Kindly give it a chance to acquire some links, both internal and external, and populate an under-used category. <a href="../../../s/u/l/User%7ESullivan.t.j_e533.html" title="User:Sullivan.t.j">Sullivan.t.j</a> 21:16, 20 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>*sigh* — It is <i><b>not</b></i> article worthy yet, it has only appeared&#160;!<b>once</b>! and hence it is "non-notable" - it may <i>never</i> appear again, <i>should it ever</i> appear again.. then it will <i>likely</i> be article worthy.. it doesn't matter what you can link it from (I could think of a ton of places to list the Romulan Warbird Valdore.. we do not give it a page though as it was only in 1 film and there isn't a great deal to write about.) at present you've probably expanded it as far as it will go at present. If you are so desperate to give it an article then take it to AfD.. see if it survives with a Keep - I can guarantee it will be a delete or merge to the list. <small><font face="Tahoma"><b>thanks</b>/Fenton, Matthew Lexic Dark <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_MatthewFenton_0db4.html" title="Special:Contributions/MatthewFenton">52278 Alpha 771</a></font></small> 21:27, 20 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I also could *sigh*, because you do not seem to have understood my basic point that the aethetic appearance of the list would be better served by moving the <i>Valkyrie</i> content to its own page. Of course I agree that the <i>Valkyrie</i> has only appeared once, and may never do so again -- how could I do otherwise? My point is about the amount of content: whether or not it will be expanded upon does not change how long it is now. By my estimate, the <i>Valkyrie</i> section weighs in as longer than it nearest competitor, <i>Astral Queen</i>, and way longer than <i>Olympic Carrier</i>, the next longest after that. Now, if you honestly feel that "one appearance" must mean list status, I respect that, even though no section of Wikipedia is anyone's private domain to run as they wish. Seriously, I respect that opinion. However, I would at least like to receive some acknowledgement that there is a separate issue here, one of content length, because so far I have not seen you address that issue. <a href="../../../s/u/l/User%7ESullivan.t.j_e533.html" title="User:Sullivan.t.j">Sullivan.t.j</a> 21:35, 20 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The article isn't too long at present and if anything else it is a decent size, at present it is only 19kb as well.. generally it only becomes a problem at 32kb. <small><font face="Tahoma"><b>thanks</b>/Fenton, Matthew Lexic Dark <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_MatthewFenton_0db4.html" title="Special:Contributions/MatthewFenton">52278 Alpha 771</a></font></small> 21:41, 20 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Thank you. I will bear the 32k threshold in mind in future. I will work to add the few morsels of information that were not transferred from the solo page into the list article. <a href="../../../s/u/l/User%7ESullivan.t.j_e533.html" title="User:Sullivan.t.j">Sullivan.t.j</a> 21:43, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
