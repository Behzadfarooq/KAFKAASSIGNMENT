<p>Why is is that we have a cassus belli entry on this article, we dont have cassus belli for other attacks by Palestinians - and isn't really general practice elsewhere (I'm sure if Bin Laden edited the S11 article he'd add a Cassus Belli entry. This legitimizes the attack by suggesting the actions where justified and is clearly P.O.V. We should either add Cassus Belli everywhere or not use it at all - it can't simply be used selectively whenever an editor decides something was justified.</p>
<p>The text implies (or at least "it may be inferred from") that the PA suggested the 3,000 death toll. Is this true -- if so, say it, if not, say who did say "3,000"... -- <a href="../../../g/w/o/User%7EGWO_480b.html" title="User:GWO">User:GWO</a></p>

<dd>Kind of like the "World Conference on Racism" in September 2001 which only found one country (suprise! Israel) as racist -- although it permits Arabs to be citizens and permits non-Jews to practice their religion.

<p>this article is biased. Wherever the word Israel appears, language is curbed and the circumstances are glossed over. Wherever independent sources appear the claims are quickly rebuked. what a joke /lame.</p>
<p><br />
I have removed a section from this text that claims that Palestinian civilian deaths can be imputed to the difficulty in "identifying civilian[s] from combatant[s]". This is POV and frankly does not tally with events as reported.</p>
<p>The many cases documented in the reports compiled by Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch confirm that many of the civilians were killed</p>
<p>a) in situations where their role as non-combatant was beyond any reasonable doubt</p>
<p>See the cases listed in Amnesty International's report on Jenin: <a href="http://web.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGMDE151432002?open&amp;of=ENG-PSE" class="external autonumber" title="http://web.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGMDE151432002?open&amp;of=ENG-PSE" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>]</p>
<p>b) in houses that were demolished with little or no notice given to the occupants.</p>
<p>I quote from Amnesty International's report on Jenin:</p>
<p>"In several cases the IDF caused the deaths of Palestinians by demolishing homes while residents were still inside. IDF soldiers frequently failed to give adequate warnings before demolishing houses, refused to allow family and neighbours to warn residents, failed to offer help themselves or to call rescue units or ambulances and sometimes shot at those who tried to help."

<dd>I read some of the report, and found this diclaimer:
<dl>
<dd>"IDF figures give 52 Palestinians killed and say that only 14 were not fighters (i.e every Palestinian male between 15 and 55 was counted as a fighter). <b>Amnesty International has not studied each case</b>; <b>according to Palestinian statistics</b> and Human Rights Watch about 22 of those killed were fighters. According to an UNRWA survey taken in the Jenin refugee camp after the IDF left the camp in April, only one person is currently reported as missing. See Israel, the Occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, and Palestinian Authority Territories&#160;: Jenin IDF Military Operations, Human Rights Watch Report.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Since they data relies on secondary sources, it is disputed.

<dd>Well, I found earlier estimation in Time's article
<blockquote>
<p>Then came the counting of casualties â and arguments about the count. Throughout the operation, Palestinian officials had said that as many as 800 had been killed. As is the case in the Middle East, the figure was inflated to fit local beliefs of Israeli depravity and Palestinian victimization: last week an Iranian waiter in Rome told an Israeli visitor of 16,000 people slaughtered in Jenin. The reality was different, though body counts and estimates of civilian casualties vary. Charles Kapes, the deputy chief of the U.N. office in the camp, says 54 dead have been pulled from the wreckage and 49 Palestinians are missing, of whom 18 are residents of the camp. Human Rights Watch says 52 were killed, of whom only 27 were thought to be armed Palestinians. The Israelis say they found 46 dead in the rubble, including a pile of five bodies that had been booby-trapped. Of these 46, say the Israelis, all but three were "fighters," men ages 18 to 40. The Jenin Hospital, meanwhile, says 52 camp residents died, including five women and four children under the age of 15. Of the 43 dead men, eight were 55 or older and therefore probably not involved in the fighting. No matter whose figures one accepts, "there was no massacre," concludes Amnesty's Holley.</p>

<p>I have to say, I believe that when used in referece to Jenin, the term "massacre" is a gross exaggeration, but I feel calling it a "hoax" is also completely inappropriate. A hoax is something that is completely false, basely and quite POV. In my opinion it would be a hoax is the IDF never entered Jenin.

<dd>I strongly oppose to removing this category. Since the accusation of alleged "massacre" and "mass atrocities" was so widely circulated, even in the Western media, and is still being used in anti-Israel propaganda, and since there is a long history of anti-Semitic <a href="../../../b/l/o/Blood_libel.html" title="Blood libel">blood libels</a>, this is not just a mere hoax, but one designed to bring old hatred back alive. Words can kill, and a serious encyclopedia is the right place to reassert NPOV.

A false claim would harm any movement (hence why the Palestinian authorities came out with a more accurate estimate before any independent report did).

<dd>The primary claim of those who consider it to be a hoax is that Arab spokespeople and leadership wilfully intended to deceive the world into believing thousands (later hundreds) of innocent Arab civilians had been massacred. The record tends to indicate that this is the case. I recall reading an article by Middle East correspondent Stewart Bell during the incident itself. He went looking for proof of the massacre, and was told by local Palestinians that a large refrigerated truck a ways off was filled with dead bodies. I guess they didn't expect him to actually check; when he did, he found it was filled with apples. There has been a lot of posturing and playacting going on for the Western press, with a willful intent to deceive. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></sup> 19:34, 20 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm trying to stay NPOV and would appreciate the same. Why did Zionism came into this picture is a logical jump I can't comprehend. Again, the question here is not whether "people did die", but rather was there a "massacre" or "genocide" or something "horrific beyond belief" (as the UN special envoy Roed-Larsen qualified it <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/1937048.stm" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/1937048.stm" rel="nofollow">[12]</a>). This case clearly demonstrated that the intl media and agencies - including the UN - were a little too eager to jump to conclusions vilifying Jews and Israel.

<dd>How about a different approach; separate this article into two, one about the Battle of Jenin, and one about the Jenin Massacre. The Battle of Jenin can be a factual description of the events, timelines, military actions, people killed, etc. The Jenin Massacre can outline the accusations of massacre, their various sources, and the subsequent disproofs/retractions.

<dd>That would be a good idea. The article seems to get worse over time. Last time I checked there were more balanced views, but now the IDF POV seems to dominate. There are quite a few foul propaganda methods employed meant to associate Palestinians with dirty tricks - such as this "fake funeral" sentence (therefore everything they say must be false! Yes?). How is that relevant in "Jenin battle" context? If I was a Palestinian, then this would be another nakba denial or massacre denial if you like. Btw. even Shimon Peres called Jenin refugee camp events "a massacre" (<s>Ha'aretz censored the article and therefore it can't be found on their site</s>) <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20020829150215/http://www.aquascript.com/psc/news.asp?d=y&amp;id=708" class="external autonumber" title="http://web.archive.org/web/20020829150215/http://www.aquascript.com/psc/news.asp?d=y&amp;id=708" rel="nofollow">[13]</a>. What we see here is pure revisionism of the worst kind. One can read contemporary articles from e.g. Ha'aretz <a href="http://www.haaretzdaily.com/hasen/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=151227&amp;contrassID=2&amp;subContrassID=1&amp;sbSubContrassID=0" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.haaretzdaily.com/hasen/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=151227&amp;contrassID=2&amp;subContrassID=1&amp;sbSubContrassID=0" rel="nofollow">[14]</a> and see that it was common knowledge that hundreds of people were killed and some were buried under rubble (and were subsequently unaccounted for). If everything was OK then one must ask why Israeli forces didn't let neither Palestinian humanitarian organizations nor UN and media in right after hostilities ended. Also it is should be not rocket science to understand that it was "battle" only to Israelis and Palestinian militants, for other civilians involved it was not a "battle", but a humanitarian/financial/etc problem. Therefore there should be separate article dealing with the facts about dead, wounded, homeless, etc and without military POV. If it was "massacre" or not is their to decide not ours. <a href="../../../m/a/g/User%7EMagabund_aa69.html" title="User:Magabund">Magabund</a> 11:50, 1 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>This article is rife with POV, and outright falsehoods eg the UN did not accept the figure for the number of dead that Israel crowed over. What the UN said was: "In Jenin camp, by the time of the IDF's withdrawal and the lifting of the curfew on 18 April, at least 52 Palestinians, of whom up to half may have been civilians, and 23 Israeli soldiers were dead. Allegations by Palestinian Authority officials in mid-April that 500 or more persons were killed in Jenin camp were not substantiated by the evidence that subsequently emerged". Other observers noted <a href="http://www.jenininquiry.org/Jenin%20Inquiry%20Report.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.jenininquiry.org/Jenin%20Inquiry%20Report.pdf" rel="nofollow">(invasion of the Jenin Refugee Camp from 3-18 April 2002)</a>
<dl>
<dd>....... People saw tanks and bulldozers run over bodies repeatedly in the process of bulldozing homes and moving around, sifting bodies into pieces and scattering them in the rubble. This has made it difficult to identify exactly how many have been killed. ...... members of Jenin Inquiry viewed many such partially decomposed bodies and severed, decomposing body parts in homes and in the streets of the camp. ...... bodies were still being recovered from under the rubble as late as early August. On 4 August, the bodies of one young boy and two adult males were discovered when an outer edge of the piles of rubble were sifted through. Four days later, another body was found compacted into the floor of his home. Public discourse about the number of dead has not taken such additional discoveries into account.</dd>

<dd>Remember just how much money is available to defend Israel (the US gives them $3 billion a year, with many other soft loans etc), and what the stakes are. We're talking about a $trillion or more of real estate that is grave danger of going back to its rightful owners at some time in the future (not too long, judging by the fright that Hezbollah handed out). There is no money whatsoever in criticising Israel - and I can't be bothered to get into a bad-tempered fight to improve this article.</dd>

<dd>I moved General Ron Kitrey's "apparently hundreds" quote here, based on Robert Fisk's assertion in his <i>The Great War for Civilization</i> that Kitrey '"said early in the battle that there were "apparently hundreds" of dead' (pg 497), PalestineCampaign.org's citation of a Reuter's 12th of April report (to which I changed the footnote to from the equally biased Newsmax.com), and the Pravda article found at <a href="http://english.pravda.ru/main/2002/04/12/27588.html" class="external free" title="http://english.pravda.ru/main/2002/04/12/27588.html" rel="nofollow">http://english.pravda.ru/main/2002/04/12/27588.html</a>. Yes, all of these sources are biased towards the Palestinians, but I find it difficult to believe that they are colluding in a conspiracy about the date of this quote. I also changed "the IDF quickly clarify" to "the IDF later say" as the timeline change makes it unclear as to how "quickly" the clarification came. Rojo gotz mojo 04:29, 13 February 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Rojo, lots of problems with this: First, both of your articles are datelined April 12, and the Pravda article says that the quote was from "today" - so there is no justificaiton for moving the date that I can see, in fact, these are confirmations of them. Second, the Pravda article makes it clear that the correction was quick, and the UPI article says "The army quickly issued a "clarification" ". Third, you are calling United Press International (the Newsmax source given) "equally biased" to Pravda and the Palestine Campaign, and using those as sources!? That hardly seems to make sense, the UPI is considered reputable, Pravda is certainly not, and a pro-Palesitnian advocacy group is no one's idea of neutral. --<a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGoodoldpolonius2_11e8.html" title="User:Goodoldpolonius2">Goodoldpolonius2</a> 04:43, 13 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Goodoldpolonius. Yeah, I have to apologize to you and the community. My head was doing a brain fart on the date because of the difference between European and American dating systems (I kept reading it as April the 4th.). Stupid and not diligent, sorry. I've got an email into Fisk as to what he meant by "early in the battle." We'll see if he responds. I'm not going to apologize as to your third point. The UPI, under the influence of owner Sun Myung Moon, has clearly become a political organ of the right. It is certainly no more reputable a source then the Reuters report cited by Palestine Campaign. That said, I did totally screw up the date change, which was the entire reason for my involvement with this entry, and I therefore do owe and apology.Rojo gotz mojo 05:09, 13 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for your graciousness on the date, but I still have to disagree with your approach to sources. One does not counter a perceived bias in a mainstream source by replacing it with an obviously biased source in the other direction, especially when you don't have a factual disagreement with the first source. The tone of the Pravda article alone ("The things that Israeli Brigadier-General Ron Kitrey said, were shocking.") should be enough to indicate a problem, let alone the newspapers reputation for reporting, and to include a pro-Palestinian NGO is equally dubious. If you are going to quote a news source with a clear anti-Israel leaning, why not at least do something half-way respectable, like the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/israel/Story/0,2763,683340,00.html" class="external text" title="http://www.guardian.co.uk/israel/Story/0,2763,683340,00.html" rel="nofollow">Guardian story</a> on the subject? --<a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGoodoldpolonius2_11e8.html" title="User:Goodoldpolonius2">Goodoldpolonius2</a> 05:28, 13 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yeah I think basically we can say that
<ul>
<li>IDF predicted 150 dead at around 9th with the estimate reducing to probably less than 100 on 11th/12th then finally at 45 on the 15th from an actual body count.</li>
<li>There wasn't any real official palestinian number but: Saeb Erekat first spoke of a massacre on the 7th, and on the same day Abdel Rahman said 250 killed many of them men and women. By the 10th, Saeb Erekat claimed 500 dead, and 12th Yasser Abed Rabbo, a Palestinian minister, claimed 900 were dead. 12th again Secretary-General of the Palestinian Authority, Ahmed Abdel Rahman, claimed "thousands" dead. This was the same day as IDF spokesman Brigadier-General Ron Kitrey made his report with the mistake "hundreds killed" when he meant to say "hundreds of casualties".</li>
<li>Independent reports actually seemed to stay constant at around "up to 100 killed".</li>
</ul>

<dd>From my understanding of the situation, Ron Kitrey has probably never seen Jenin. He sits behind a desk all day at some Israeli office for media relations and every now and then gets handed somethin to say to the press. He is told what the IDF want him to say and thats what he says (hence the title IDF spokesman - he speaks for the IDF). If the IDF quickly say he made a mistake, then his report was a mistake. His opinion doesn't matter, because he's representing the IDF opinion. Maybe he misread what was handed to him in the first place.

<dd>It matters in a way. Two possibilities&#160;: IDF thought first, had enough information to think that hundred of Palestinians were killed, and after the IDF realized (maybe asking officers and soldiers) that it was not possible, so they explained Kitrey meant "hundreds of casualties", but it's not necessary true that he meant that. (Israel estimates 150 dead on the April 10).</dd>
<dd>The other possibility is what you propose&#160;: Kitrey made a mistake reading a paper.</dd>

<dd>Again does it really matter? "hundreds" is quite a vague number. The original reason for this quote being included was that Ron Kitrey was to blame for the overblown numbers. I've shown you that numbers of up to 900 were suggested long before, so Ron Kitrey was not (solely) to blame. Could you be any more pedantic? I'm sorry for being short but what do you want me to say? Israel DID kill 52 Palestinians with dubious reason and possible (probable?) breaches of human rights, but "hundreds" of them were not killed. There was wanton killing. There were no mass graves. I'm pretty sympathetic for the Palestinian people (note distinction from militants) but you really cannot pin the blame on them for this. -- <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomhab_fa0f.html" title="User:Tomhab">Tomhab</a> 22:39, 5 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>When you wrote "<i>the only IDF report with such a large body</i>" "<i>and came after inflated Palestinian reports of a massacre.</i>", it wasn't a correct presentation, as your complete chonology shows after. So maybe my reverts were not correct (I continue with my first mistake), but the version I reverted 3 or 4 times also were not... I don't think I commited a crime when reverting&#160;; and, for my opinion, to delete relevent facts, as it happens for Ron Kitrey's declaration, is more problematic on Wikipedia.</p>
<p>And about "fan-site" , when you wrote "<i>from not a news site, but a pro-Palestinian "fan site"</i>", please notice that I used the same site that was in the paragraph before (13 May 2005 version <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Battle_of_Jenin_2002&amp;oldid=14589525" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Battle_of_Jenin_2002&amp;oldid=14589525" rel="nofollow">[29]</a>, part "Allegations of a Massacre", 3rd paragraph, I couldn't guess it was a fan-site).</p>
<p>About my "<i>own ignorance on the matter</i>", please be less categoric, I've lived in Palestinian cities and some friends of my friends were injured during Jenin operation, some of them lost a leg or more (there are not included in the <i>only</i> 52 people killed).

<dd>Unless you are saying there was some conspirecy, given the quick clarification, it is very reasonable to believe that Kitrey made a mistake in his statement (i.e. slipped in his tongue) rather than he "told the true" and was "covered up" by IDF statement. Moreover, since he is IDF spokesman, he was the one responsible for issuing the clarification. This was not the case with Saeb Erekat. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMathKnight_e2bc.html" title="User:MathKnight">MathKnight</a> 16:38, 6 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I have to repeat what I said above&#160;:</dd>
<dd>In the chronology of the article, we can find three items about israeli declarations&#160;:</dd>
<dd>On April 10, Israel estimates 150 dead</dd>
<dd>On April 12, Ron Kitrey mistakenly (or not) says hundreds killed</dd>
<dd>On April 14, the estimation progressivley came down (from 250 and 188) to a final figure of 45</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>So for me it's not very clear if IDF first thought on the 12th that hundred of Palestinians were killed and realized only after this figures was not possible, or if Kitrey misunderstood something. I never talk about "conspirecy", but everybody knows that boths sides in a conflict (which is also mediatic) sometimes say things a little bit different from the truth. If we always believe IDF only on their declarations and adopt their interpretation, it's useless to talk about neutrality here. That's why I propose to only report the facts&#160;: Kitrey says <i>this</i>, and IDF quickly explain he meant <i>this</i>. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarcoo_dd31.html" title="User:Marcoo">Marcoo</a> 17:48, 6 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>For my level of english, "clarify" means "to make understandable", so if we use the verb clarify, it means that we'd suppose true the fact that he made a mistake. That's why I proposed before "explain", which doesn't presume if the explanation is the good one or not.</dd>

<dd>Hi Marcoo, Please don't take offense at what i'm about to say, but you seem to be having a problem properly grasping the meaning of the english in this statement. From my position as having British English as a first language, this is not POV in the slightest. If English is not your first language are you sure you can make statements querying the validity of phrases that you are not fully familiar with? Even with your interpretation of the word clarify, if you go back to the article this was taken from <a href="http://newsmax.com/archives/articles/2002/4/12/163750.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://newsmax.com/archives/articles/2002/4/12/163750.shtml" rel="nofollow">[31]</a> it quotes IDF spokesman Brigadier-General Ron Kitrey as saying "there were <b>apparently</b> hundreds of people killed in the Jenin refugee camp.". Note the use of apparently, this shows a level of uncertainty and would therefore need clarification, and thus making clear. Again, please don't take this as an attack.</dd>

<dd>As everybody knows, english is not my first language. Ok. But when I go on Merriam-Webster online dictionary, I read for "clarify" that one of the meanings is "to make understandable". So it appears that this word have the exact same meanings in French. So from what I understand, if we write&#160;: "<i>IDF quickly clarify he made a mistake</i>", it means that we suppose true the fact that he made a mistake. Am I right ot not&#160;? So I ask for a verb which doesnt suppose if it is true or not. And notice that in the link, the article used two "<b>"</b>" for the word "clarification", they is a reason. If "quickly explain" is "too odd", you can propose something else, after all, you know english better than me.--<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarcoo_dd31.html" title="User:Marcoo">Marcoo</a> 08:01, 10 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Quoting Marcoo <b>which doesn't suppose if Ron Kitrey made a mistake or not</b> - if you look at the source the second statement is released solely to explain Ron Kitrey DID make a mistake!

<p>One should look at the pictures and then try to imagine 200 square metres. It is about 15x15 metres. Maybe the writer meant 200x200 metres, which seems a bit more plausible area of 40 000 square metres. I added the link to Jenin pictures (this.is/jenin) for clarification. Believe me or your own eyes, the destroyed area is not 15 by 15 metres. And one can call this article NPOV?

<dd>We have worked very hard to make this article NPOV.

It shows a series of aerial photographs of the devastation. Whilst your point that 200m2 is very different from 200x200, saying that the 40 000m2 of area was destroyed isn't right. The article meant that 200x200m was the areas of greatest fighting. <s>The article never makes any mention of the total area of devastation.</s>

<dd>Sorry, but this does not add up, most sources say that the area was as big as several football fields. British correspondents from "The Independent" who visited it described the area as 400x500 metres. Btw. I did not say it _is_ 40 000m2, I said that 200x200 metres is a bit more plausible than 15x15 metres. Now you are saying that it is an area of 20 000m2, but I doubt that. And I am not talking about the whole article written from Israeli POV. From the NPOV it was a by any means a large scale destruction of a internationally recognized refugee camp. The military significance is _only one aspect_ in the disaster that hit people (about 15 000) living in Jenin refugee camp. Trying to show it in the light of military conflict and mostly dispute about body counts is shown already in the title - Battle of Jenin. It would be more helpful, maybe, to view it in the humanitarian/occupation context.--<a href="../../../m/a/g/User%7EMagabund_aa69.html" title="User:Magabund">Magabund</a> 15:40, 1 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well, one way to POV an article is to insert a series of highly edited and selected quotes in order to make a political point.

<dl>
<dd>Well, the quote from US envoy (among others) was absolutely relevant, because it shows the humanitarian dimension to this "battle". I cannot see why did you remove them instead of adding something. Did you find any of the quotes to be false or something? They were not "highly edited". I spent about an hour to search as complete versions of the quotes as possible. And of course you are welcome to make them more complete. Maybe I should add Yassir Arafat's Jeningrad quote also? --<a href="../../../m/a/g/User%7EMagabund_aa69.html" title="User:Magabund">Magabund</a> 16:05, 1 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Part of the problem with this particular battle is that the varied views as time goes by. If you knew the number of dead as in the 500+ range then its a lot more tragic than someone thats around 50.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The media frenzy on the battle is by far the most signifant (and interesting) part of it all hence why a lot of the article is dedicated to it. I have to agree with Jayjg that the quotes do not help make the article NPOV. If you feel like something is POV, then unPOV it, don't just try and counter it by making it more POV the other way. -- <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomhab_fa0f.html" title="User:Tomhab">Tomhab</a> 16:33, 1 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Exactly, thats what I said also. If you felt that my addition was POV then you should have unPOV'd it. But you deleted instead. The article fails to mention international outcry that followed. That included US president who twice asked for withdrawal and numerous other diplomats/politicians. This is relevant information. The dispute about body counts is more like obfuscation. As I understand, this article is currently not about what happened in Jenin refugee camp for about two weeks starting from april 3. 2002, but about media frenzy surrounding these events. --<a href="../../../m/a/g/User%7EMagabund_aa69.html" title="User:Magabund">Magabund</a> 20:45, 1 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>How can you agree be saying exactly what Tomhab says when he disagrees with you? As for the quotes, they were inherently POV; their choice, editing, etc. They added no value to the article, only POV. The solution was not to add more biased quotes saying other things, but to remove them entirely. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></sup> 00:31, 2 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The reason for the disproportion of information is thus. The article missed out the media section and vague comments about allegations of a massacre were spread throughout. Because of the difficultly deciphering what actually happened (who said what, when and what actually happened), there was a lot of "vandalism" from over-zealous persons who fell on one side of the Israel/Palestine argument. 95% of the arguments were nonsense based on people's badly formed opinions based on misinformation.</dd>

As for the first paragraph, are you saying that Palestinians (regardless of how one feels about them) share the POV that it was a counter-terrorist operation? It shouldn't be necessary to pull out countless Palestinian references that called it 'aggression' (again regardless of if one thinks they are right or not - this is about neutrality). Regardless of whether the State Dept is biased or not, their saying something doesn't automatically make it neutral.

<dd>Would you two stop for a second so I can save my stuff?? GASP! This is my third attempt. If you look closely at my edit, I don't think the first paragraph is actually reducing the notion of "counter-terrorist". I was careful not to use the word "claim" (i.e. that the IDF 'claims' it was counter-terrorist) because it's more solid than that. Is my wording really that problematic? Slim, if you are sure that there were journalists in there during the block, who were saying that there are hundreds or thousands of bodies and secret mass graves, then I withdraw my opposition to your second paragraph, although I do contend that part of the reason it drew attention was because of the media blackout (irrespective of the reports coming out). <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERamallite_7adc.html" title="User:Ramallite">Ramallite</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../r/a/m/User_talk%7ERamallite_904e.html" title="User talk:Ramallite"><font color="DarkBlue">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 22:24, 10 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"Lost their lives" generally (though not always) is more emotive language than "killed". I contend that "lost their lives" is used more often to generate sympathy, whereas 'killed' is not necessarily as often so. The 'also' was my attempt to equate "killed" with "loss of life" to sort of level the field between the two, not to suggest an "oh by the way" POV. So again, I would appreciate compromise language if you can suggest any. Of course, if there is no difference between the two, we could just switch the two phrases' locations? Compromise language (for either) would be things like "fatally wounded", "lost", "fatally ambushed", etc. Don't get me wrong, I have nothing against sympathizing with the Israeli side, but doing so at the expense of the Palestinian side is not neutral in my mind. <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERamallite_7adc.html" title="User:Ramallite">Ramallite</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../r/a/m/User_talk%7ERamallite_904e.html" title="User talk:Ramallite"><font color="DarkBlue">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 23:24, 10 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Also, there were no "mixed" Palestinian reactions to the Jenin massacre, it produced blanket condemnation by Palestinians. I took out that sentence because that unsourced sentiment was not shown to be related to the contents of this article.

But that wasn't the content before. As for the 22 civilian casualties (just the dead, not including the wounded), I have no idea why it's not covered, except to emphasize that the number was 22 and not in the hundreds as feared earlier, and thus couldn't be called a massacre.

<dd>I don't want to take sides either&#160;;) But I will say that using phrases like "collateral damage" insinuates that civilians were not intentionally targeted (I'm not referring to your usage above, Park3r).

I agree with Park3r that this article seems to have turned into a terminology war.

<p>Folks,</p>
<p>I've tried to work in some of the previous concerns. These have been reverted by some without any explanation and without addressing the reasons why the other version won't work because or NPOV and <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>. Shamir1 added that Human Rights Watch reported that Palestinian militants had "endangered the lives of Palestinian civilians". According to the source, this is absolutely correct. But the source also says that HRW "has so far found no evidence that Palestinian gunmen forced Palestinian civilians to serve as human shields during the attack." This is contradictory to what the article said before (prior to Shamir1's addition), so I removed it. <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERamallite_7adc.html" title="User:Ramallite">Ramallite</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../r/a/m/User_talk%7ERamallite_904e.html" title="User talk:Ramallite"><font color="DarkBlue">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 03:03, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
