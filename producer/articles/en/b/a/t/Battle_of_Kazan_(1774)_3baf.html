<p>There were 3 sectors of defense in Kazan. The first under general Banner was from <a href="../../../k/a/z/Kazanka.html" title="Kazanka">Kazanka</a> and <a href="../../../a/r/s/Arsk_Field_a854.html" title="Arsk Field">Arsk Field</a> to <a href="../../../q/a/b/Qaban_lakes.html" title="Qaban lakes">Qaban lakes</a>, there governmental troops were reinforced by <a href="../../../k/a/z/Kazan_Gymnasium_8180.html" title="Kazan Gymnasium">gymnasium</a> pupils under headmaster Kanitsa and armed officials. The second was from Pleteny to Yamskoy quarter under general-mayor Larionov, the third from Yamskoy to Kazanka, under colonel Svechin. The area north from <a href="../../../k/a/z/Kazan_Kremlin_2509.html" title="Kazan Kremlin">the citadel</a> was defended by <a href="../../../a/d/m/Admiralty.html" title="Admiralty">Admiralty</a> troops under Shchelin, the citadel itself was reinforced and garrison under Letskoy was ready to fight. <a href="../../../z/i/l/Zilantaw.html" title="Zilantaw">Zilantov Monastery</a> and the Admiralty were turned to strongholds. <a href="../../../r/e/d/Redoubt.html" title="Redoubt">Redoubts</a> were installed at Kazanka's bank and Arsk Field, as system of knife-rests were installed around the city. 9 <a href="../../../c/a/n/Cannon.html" title="Cannon">cannons</a> were placed behind the knife-rests. The <a href="../../../s/u/b/Suburb.html" title="Suburb">suburb</a> settlements should defend without governmental assistance.</p>
<p>There were 1500 regular troops in Kazan, along with policemen, Admiralty troops and firemen defenders numbered 2000. 2 July the <a href="../../../k/a/z/Kazan_Governorate_dcea.html" title="Kazan Governorate">governor</a> von Brandt announced a coming siege.</p>

<p>10 <a href="../../../m/u/l/Mullah.html" title="Mullah">mullahs</a> sent by Catherine's offer to agitate against Pugachev, were killed by rebels. Orthodox bishop Veniamin appealed to Christians to refuse from joining Pugachev army. However, many peasants from all modern Tatarstan joint the rebellion and marched to Kazan.</p>
<p>10-11 July Pugachev troops encamped to the north-east from Kazan, betveen Troitskaya Noksa and Tsaritsyno. The army numbered 25000, the most of them were <a href="../../../c/o/s/Cossacks.html" title="Cossacks">Cossacks</a>, ethnically Tatar and Udmurt peasants, Bashkir cavalry. Only Cossacks had fire-arms, Bashkirs were armed with bows, peasants were mostly armed with clubs and stakes. 11 July Pugachev with interpreter approached Kazan borders and sent bid for disarmament to governor von Brandt and city's population. Tatar community was invited to support the rebellion. Von Brandt refused to disarm, however, Tatar quarters sent 70 go-betweens with presents to Pugachev. They also disclosed weak places in Kazan defense.</p>
<p>12 July four o'clock of the morning Pugachev convened a council of war, dividing army into 4 groups. The first two under Beloborodov and Mineyev should attack Arsk Field, the main group under Pugachev himself attacked Sukonny (Broadcloth <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manufactory.html" title="Manufactory">Manufactory</a>) quarter.

<p>Beloborodov took Neyelova grove, the modern Gorky Park and approached citadel by the modern <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karl_Marx_3bcc.html" title="Karl Marx">Karl Marx</a> street. Pugachev's cannons neutralized governmental artillery. Pugachev shelled self-defense of the cloth fabric under manufacturer Dryablov. <a href="../../../w/o/r/Workers.html" title="Workers">Workers</a> joined the rebel army. The fourth group of rebels reached Mokry quarter and Admiralty.</p>
<p>Noble army was forced to retreat and was seized in the <a href="../../../c/i/t/Citadel.html" title="Citadel">citadel</a>. Nearby half of defenders, mostly ethnic Tatars go over rebel side. The central stone part of Kazan, mostly settled by nobles and merchants was set on fire. Sukonny and Tatar quarters, however, stayed safe.</p>
<p>Pugachev decreed to safe lives of civilians and captives. They were convoyed to the nearby village of Savinovo. Moreover, Pugachev invited them to join his troops.

<p>Pugachev's family, the wife Sofia Dmitrievna, 11-years old son Trofim, daughters Khristina and Agrafena and his brother, were imprisoned in Kazan during the rebellion. Sofia Pugacheva should confirm, that Yemelyan isn't Peter III, but a Cossack. She could visit markets to spread this information. When Pugachev's group marched they occasionally met his family. Trofim called him, but Pugachev said that he is simply a friend of this family. So, he took them to unit transport.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>

<p>Kremlin was surrounded, rebel cannons were installed near Spasskaya Tower and started shelling. After noon, Pugachev stopped the storm and retreated to Arsk Field. There he participated in <a href="../../../t/h/a/Thanksgiving.html" title="Thanksgiving">thanksgiving</a> service. Then he had a dinner at Tatar merchant Musa Apanayev's house.</p>
<p>At the evening governmental troops from <a href="../../../u/f/a/Ufa.html" title="Ufa">Ufa</a> under Ivan Ivanych Michelson reached Kazan. A harsh battle took place at the modern <a href="../../../g/o/g/Gogol.html" title="Gogol">Gogol</a> street<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup>, but no side wined. Pugachev retreated to Savonovo and Sukhaya Reka villages. 13 July he tried to prevent unblocking of the citadel, but under pressure of Michelson and Potyomkin rebels were defeated were forced to retreat. 15 July Pugachyov's 15000 numbered army was defeated in the battle of Arsk Field. Pugachev with 500 men escaped to Tsaryovokokshaysk, to cross the <a href="../../../v/o/l/Volga.html" title="Volga">Volga</a> 18 July and to continue his struggle then. Michelson didn't follow him, as governmental forses hadn't horses.</p>
<p>Before the trial captives were imprisoned in camp near the suburb of Bişbalta. In autumn two gallows were placed in Kazan, one in Sukonny, another in Tatar quarter. Many captive rebels were executed, including Beloborodov and Mineyev.</p>

<p>After Pugachev's escaping some rebel groups under Bäxtiär Qanqayıv and Usman Timerev continued the resistanse in the region, but they were shortly neutralized by governmental troops.</p>
<p>The battle of Kazan had a significant role in <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Tatarstan_89fb.html" title="History of Tatarstan">Tatarstan's history</a>. It should be noted that the <a href="../../../v/o/l/Volga_Tatars_fccc.html" title="Volga Tatars">Tatar</a> participation in the rebellion numbered up to 85000. Nevertheless the participants of the rebellion were harshly punished, Tsar's government continued policy of the support of Muslim nobility and clergy, to prevent similar as a result of religious oppression in future. Feudal oppression, however, stayed for a long time. <sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
