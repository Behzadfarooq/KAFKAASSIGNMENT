<p>I'm surprised to see this article printed in English. A Frenchman obviously wrote it.</p>

<li>I agree. What is meant by <i>battle</i> in this sentence?: "It is probable that the usual three 'battles' were drawn up in line, each with its archers on the flanks and the dismounted men-at-arms in the centre;" <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThePedanticPrick_f167.html" title="User:ThePedanticPrick">ThePedanticPrick</a> 23:55, 22 Oct 2004 (UTC)</li>
<li>In this context <i>battle</i> means a battalion or division, a major part of the army formed under a sub-commander. It is the correct medieval English term (in modern spelling). Note, however, that the diagrams of the battle are ludicrous: the English are supposed to have 1000 men-at-arms and 6000 archers... now compare the area of the oblong battles of men-at-arms to the triangles of archers. Those men-at-arms must be gigantically bloated fatties. dbrwr 23:40, 24 Oct 2004 (UTC)</li>

Henry V was hardly a 'war criminal' - for a start there was nothing approaching any form of 'international law' at the time. I'm removing that phrase. If anyone has a problem then we can discuss it. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrism_8422.html" title="User:Chrism">Chrism</a> 10:40, 6 Dec 2003 (UTC)</p>

<dd>While it's debatable whether he was a war criminal, it's foolish to suggest there was no hint of international law at the time. See Christine de Pizan's discussion of just war and the treatment of prisoners in the Book of Deeds of Arms and of Chivalry. -Andy</dd>

<p>I am not happy with the section it expreses a POV from a TV programme. The tests that they did were made to make their point:</p>
<ul>
<li>The draw weight of the bows used may or may not have been correct.</li>
<li>The bodkin arrow heads which they used were one of many designs.</li>

<p>I have some comments to make on the question of the efficacy of the longbow, and the tests carried out at the University of Reading.</p>
<p>In fact, the tests, like most such tests, used no bows at all. The use of mechanical apparatus is standard in these kinds of tests to ensure that every 'shot' is as much like the others as possible.</p>
<p>The bodkin head used was based upon one actually found at the battlesite by archaeologists, so we know that this design was one used on the day.</p>
<p>The point about the armour is valid. Older armours may well have been present on the field, and we know that iron mail and coats of plates would be vulnerable to the arrowheads of the day. Steel arrowheads could have been made, but since this would multiply the cost of an arrow sixfold, it wasn't often done. The arrowheads recovered at the battle site are certainly of iron.</p>
<p>There is another point which needs to be made&#160;; the tests were all done at 90 degrees, instead of the standard 30 degrees usually used, so they overstate the actual penetrating power of the arrowheads considerably.</p>
<p>In fact, there is little doubt about the growing inability of the longbow to penetrate 15th century armour in either the sources or the experimental archaeological studies. By the time of Verneuil in 1424, the new armours were in such widespread use that the French knights seemed invulnerable to the English arrows. Archers could still kill men at arms with shots at their exposed faces - by one account, this is how James IV died at Flodden - but the glory days were over. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 81.79.202.124 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_81.79.202.124_3af8.html" title="Special:Contributions/81.79.202.124">contribs</a>) 03:21, 28 October 2004 (UTC)</small></p>
<p>Along with the error in angle of the shot there was errors or factors ignored in regards to the armor. It was flat and did not appear to have been wrought, thus making it alot stronger; they assumed that all armor was 2mm thick all over, it was not; they assumed all French had access to the best armor, while the nobles did many of their entourage would not have; they assumed all armor was battle armor, yet in the same show they give evidence for elaborate show armor being used, with concerns for aesthetics the armor would not have been designed for maximum protection; and in my opinion most importantly the test was done with the sheet flat on another object, without space to dent the armor all the force had to be absorbed by the arrowhead vastly reducing its penetrating ability. -veridis</p>
<p>I would invite Anne Curry to test her theory by suiting up in some 15th century french armor and taking a few shots from an English longbow. If she thinks the most casualties were inflicted by crushing and trampling, comparing it to a football riot, maybe she should attend a match. Crushes don't kill 1/3 of those involved, no matter how big they are. Not in a football crowd, or a concert, or a battle. - Kafziel 13:34, 13 July 2005</p>

<dd>In the "The Great Warbow" by Dr. Mattew Strickland and <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Hardy_6579.html" title="Robert Hardy">Robert Hardy</a>, Pub Sutton, 2005, <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0750931671</a> report on page 17 that the largest weigh group among the bows on the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mary_Rose_f430.html" title="Mary Rose">Mary Rose</a> bows were between 68-72.5 kg (150-160 lbs). Previous to the research on the Mary Rose, known longbows from a much smaller sample, and using victorian estamates of strenth on some, had draw weight which were thought to be 32-46kg (60-100 lbs); (see <a href="../../../l/o/n/Longbows.html#Surviving_bows" title="Longbows">longbows#Surviving bows</a>). The weight of longbow arrows prior to the Mary Rose excavations was thought to be 52 grams, which was an invention of members of the British longbow society, (page 414) it is now known that the shafts were on average .80m (2'6'') long and 0.01 (0.5'') diameter (page 10) with a weight of between 100-115 grams (page 31). In case there is doubt about the size of the arrows there is one surviving arrow from another source which is kept in Westminster Abbey and is of a type to be loosed from a 68kg longbow (page 32).</dd>

<p>I saw this study on the History Channel last year. They used iron tipped arrows against steel plate armour and it didn’t penetrate. I believe the French charge failed because the combination of events and not just one factor. Death came in many forms to those knights and swordsmen. I’m sure some arrows did find their mark. Some falling horses and throwing the riders into the mud and some hitting soft points or gaps in the armour. I believe the terrain played the most decisive factor as it does in all battles. To say it was only the longbow is wrong. And I say if the English longbow was so effective against steel plate armour at 200 yards why would they eventually use a smoothbore musket which misfired and hardly be accurate at 80 yards. HUSZAR, July 28 2005.</p>
<p>The musket actually had a greater range than the longbow, if used in indirect fire; Hardy and Strickland gloss over this point in Great Warbow, and compare the direct fire range of the gun with the indirect range of the bow, not like with like. Supplies of suitable bowstaves also began to dwindle, making the longbow no longer a cheaply available weapon for the masses. It is also true that as armours improved and longbows had to have a greater draw-weight to achieve penetration, accuracy dropped off greatly - which is why the bows for target shooting that 19th century writers based their studies on did not exceed 50 to 70 lbs draw or so. Lastly, there would come a point where the draw-weight needed to achieve penetration exceeded that which an archer could manage. Crossbows and muskets had no such problems, though they did have others. All of these other factors are covered in Hardy and Strickland.[December 11 2005]</p>
<p>they switched to muskets because it didn't require a lifetimes worth of work to master and it increased the central governments control if every peasant couldn't kill one of their lords if they pissed them of too much <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 81.179.82.235 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_81.179.82.235_7208.html" title="Special:Contributions/81.179.82.235">contribs</a>) 11:26, 23 September 2005 (UTC)</small></p>

<dd>What you saw on the history channel was not iron tipped arrows against steel plate armour but against a plain steel plate placed flat upon a bench. It had not been bent or shaped so was much stronger than armour made of the same plate, it was placed flat so could not distort helping it maintain its structural strength. Look at any piece of metal that has been pierced and you will notice there is a large dent around it, not just a sudden hole. By preventing this denting from happening by using a plate flat on a bench they made it much more resistant. -veridis</dd>

<p>With regard to the longbow vs. musket discussion, according to "Napoleonic weapons and tactics" by Philip J. Haythornthwaite, if the longbowmen of this period had been pitted against the armies of Napoleonic times they would certainly have been able to outshoot almost any of them, with the added benefits of targets not being obscured by smoke and a longbow being slightly cheaper than a musket. In fact a leader of the time urged the Brittish gov. to start using longbows again. However as has been said it was rejected on the grounds that a man could be trained to use a musket in a day, while it might take years for a man to become proficient with a longbow plus a longbow's performance could also be effected by wind. Sorry for off topic but it's a fairly interesting discussion. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 212.219.232.90 (<a href="../../../2/1/2/User_talk%7E212.219.232.90.html" title="User talk:212.219.232.90">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions__212.219.232.90_6b2e.html" title="Special:Contributions/ 212.219.232.90">contribs</a>) 10:34, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</small></p>

<dl>
<dd>Excellent question/point! No one really knows. I've seen figures all over the place for the strength of both armies and casualties also. I've edited the battlebox to reflect this. The English may have had as few as 5,000 or as many as 9, possibly even 10,000. The French as few as 12,000 or even over 30,000. The most likely, scenario, to my mind, is somewhere in between, with the English having circa 7,000 and the French circa 20,000 (Which Sir <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Oman_45cc.html" title="Charles Oman">Charles Oman</a> also saw as most likely). Henry had a small force of 2-300 select mounted knights to serve as his bodyguard and persoanal retenue. In some accounts they saw action with the King, in others they and King Hal just sat back, in others still they are'nt mentioned at all. Were they included in the "Men-at-Arms" figures? Some accounts also mention on the French side, several hundred of their knights who had swore a blood oath to seek out King Henry and slay him on the field (the "regicides"). But whether they existed as an organized unit or were the creation of later historians/storytellers is as well unknown. Given all these variations and estimates, We know about as much about Agincourt as we do the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Hastings_16cc.html" title="Battle of Hastings">Battle of Hastings</a>, fought in the same month 349 years earlier.--<a href="../../../r/2E/d/User%7ER.D.H._%28Ghost_In_The_Machine%29_1bea.html" title="User:R.D.H.

<p>It is most likly that Enguerrand the Monstrelet gave the correct numbers, since he would have no motive of faking them, and he gives them only 38 years afterwards. Its also the most plausible and logical nummbers. I believe 900 men-at-arms is too few either way. An interesting way to measure this could be to check if the area can have 900 men formed up into at a line of at least 2-3 men thick. If not the english would had to have more men. And also an archer is no match for a heavy infantry in hand-to-hand combat. However if the English had 13000 or 5000 archers the french losses would been massive as they moved to the alleged english 900-men line, as they would face 5000 - 13000 arrows sevral times each minutte. But 900 men is just to few, you would need at least 1500 to make a stand. Battle expert</p>
<p>38 years is actually quite a long time when there is so little in the way of previous written records to refer back to. A lot of the people who had been at the battle would have been dead. Also the biggest problem with Enguerrand's figures is they seem far too high for the English. Even Anne Curry, who has been revising the odds in the victory down as much as she can, doesn't think the English had more than about 8,000. It's generally accepted that Henry only landed with an army of about 12,000. The biggest arguments are about how many of these were in a fit state at Agincourt, with the low estimate being about 6,000 (this was the 'standard' figure for a long time, e.g. it's used in the Encyclopedia Britannica) and the high estimate being about 9,000. I've not aware of a modern historian who thinks the English had 13,000 at Agincourt.</p>
<p>As to the line of English men-at-arms, as I understand it they were packed quite tightly, with archers on each flank protected by palings. The palings would have been less of an obstacle to knights on foot than knights on horseback, but you also have to remember that medieval knights were quite hung up on honour. You get honour (and booty) from hacking down enemy knights, not enemy commoners. Also, although there are arguments about how effective longbows were against full plate, they certainly had a far better chance of penetrating at point-blank range, so it would have been a brave knight who walked slowly, in the mud, around some wooden stakes while being shot at from a couple of metres. On the other hand, the longbowmen couldn't safely shoot at the French men-at-arms if they were engaged hand-to-hand with the English men-at-arms, for fear of hitting their own troops. The French men-at-arms apparently seem to have just engaged the English men-at-arms, on the same frontage as the English (which caused them all sorts of problems because of congestion), and ignored the longbowmen until they were rushed from the sides (when the English men-at-arms were pushed back). The suggestion is that because of a) the fatigue of the French men-at-arms after walking in thick mud wearing full plate b) the casualties they had already taken from bowfire c) the greater agility of the unarmoured longbowmen in the mud and d) the fact that the French were so tightly packed they couldn't fight properly, that the intervention of some of the longbowmen in the melee was sufficient to turn the tide against the French.</p>

<p>Actually, sorry, I think it's the Hutchinson encylopedia which gives the figures as 6,000 for the English. The online 1911 Encyclopedia Britannica says: "Henry arrayed his little army (about r000 men-at-arms, 6000 archers, and a few thousands of other foot...". r000 is a rather annoying figure, I assume caused by bad scanning! 1,000 would fit with other versions. The total number is significantly more than 6,000, however the same article also says of the French: "They were at least four times more numerous than the English, but restricted by the nature of the ground to the same extent of front". (If you're curious, a lot of the account of the battle in the current Wikipedia article is lifted almost verbatim from the 1911 EB.) Alternatively you can go with Anne Curry's research, which broadly agree with the EB for the English, but put the French army as far smaller (12,000) than any other source that I am aware of.</p>

I think at any rate, though the French army was often overstated and the English numbers vary, the credit due to the latter must not be lost. The English army had provisioning issues and were most likely exhausted. They had been marching frantically, yet, however, still conquered odds at Agincourt and gained an important victory over the French, who were fresh and in all likeliness well supported by the country round.

<dd>good point. I have expanded the siege text to include dates. Away team turned up on August 13th, took two days to change, kick off was on the 18th. One month later on September 18th, the away team were going to win in a penalty shoot out, so the home team agreed to loose, (as they were worried about the behaviour of the away team fans) unless the police turned up by the 22nd. As the police did not turn up, the home team went down to the pub leaving the changing rooms to the away team. For some reason which is not clear the away team hung about for two weeks until the 8th of October when they decided to head for home, trying to evade arrest from the police on the way.</dd>

<dd>Take you pick the game started on the 13th of August and ended on the 8th of October just under 2 months. Or if it is playing time than it is 18th of August until 18th of September just over 4 weeks. It would seem to me that the siege lasted about as long as one would expect if it was contested. I guess that Henry had hoped for none contest, in which case it would have been over in days. It is not clear to me why he waited over two weeks after the seige ended before setting off for Calais.

<p>I'm surprised that no one has referred to Hanbs Delbruck's analysis of the battle in Geschichte der Kriegskunst. He argues that the size of the French army has been exaggerated by the medieval historians to make Henry V looks more heroic. Why, he asks, would an army with a massive superiority in numbers take up a position where it could not use that advantage to outflank its opponent? Instead, the French took up a position between two wooded areas, which no one would do if they did not need to protect their own flanks. A larger army would have taken up positions some way to the rear of those chosen historically, where there were open fields to each side. Moreover, since we now have the French plan of battle, we can see that their whole plan of campaign depended upon flank attacks upon the English. On the day, they deployed their troops differently, which leads one to suppose that there must have been some pressing reason so to do. Lack of numbers present with the field army, as opposed to having been promised, or marching to join the army explain this behaviour.</p>
<p>From this, and from a study of the actual space available to deploy the French army, he dismisses any idea of a 25 000 man force. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 81.79.202.124 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_81.79.202.124_3af8.html" title="Special:Contributions/81.79.202.124">contribs</a>) 03:34, 28 October 2004 (UTC)</small></p>

<dd>While it is a credible theory one must realise the the field at Agincourt was the most suitable in the immediate vicinity and it was this area where the French armies caught up to/intercepted the English.

<p>User Center-for-Medieval-Studies undermines Prof. Anne Curry's findings, arguing that the "incomplete nature of the records, <b>especially on the French side</b>" makes it difficult to estimate troop strength. I fear this is just another case of historical consevatism, or inability to accept new findings that debunk previously held beliefs. As far as I know, and I know a fair bit about French archives, all historians agree that French archives are the most voluminous and best preserved in the world, so I don't see why talking about bad archives, "especially on the French side". The Archives Nationales in Paris keep all the royal archives dating from before the Revolution, and these archives are extremely complete. The French Revolution and various wars did not damage the central government archives at all. For instance, I know for sure that the Archives Nationales possess all the records of the Parlement de Paris from 1254 to 1790 without a single missing year or month. If Center-for-Medieval-Studies has specific proofs that French finance records from the early 15th century are somewhat missing or incomplete, he/she should produce these proofs, because otherwise everything lead to believe that these records have survived time. I don't believe someone with the reputation of Anne Curry would have engaged in such a thorough research debunking a popular myth without some guarantee that the records are beyond dispute. <a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHardouin_7fc4.html" title="User:Hardouin">Hardouin</a> 5 July 2005 13:39 (UTC)</p>

It seems to me that the statements in the current revision (16:17, 5 July 2005), that this theory has yet to be fully scrutinized by the scientific community, are respectful of Prof. Curry's ideas while retaining the proper degree of scientific skepticism. --<a href="../../../t/i/s/User%7ETisco_8cdd.html" title="User:Tisco">Tisco</a> 6 July 2005 14:32 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Absolutely. If we had to take every new theory as certain fact we'd be in chaos. It is quite normal for two opposing sides of an argument to have historic 'documents' they don't prove an argument in and of themselves. Give it some time for proper peer review and counter arguments. As a general comment on all military 'records' of that age a healthy degree of scepticism is due. Military records are notorious for showing how many people were on the 'state' parole but frequently bad at telling us how many actually fought. You can lose huge numbers as sick/wounded/deserters/stragglers just as you can gain from direct recruitment or indirect attachment of friendly forces.<a href="../../../a/l/c/User%7EAlci12_990b.html" title="User:Alci12">Alci12</a></dd>

<p>I think Anne Currys theory may have some truth behind it. It is not the first time an English king has used propaganda to bolster his reputatuion. (Such as Richard the Lionheart). I think that it is possible the numbers have become warped over the years, but i disagree about the exact figures she has given. I think they're a theory, nothing more. Anne's theory may also be biased in some other way, as often is with "experts". I do also have one other peice of information which i am adding, which is an account i have read of the battle. (I read it in an old history book entitiled "the sceptered isle") is that although the French armor was on the whole too strong to be peirced by Bodkin Arrows, the horses were mostly unarmored. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 203.10.121.83 (<a href="../../../2/0/3/User_talk%7E203.10.121.83.html" title="User talk:203.10.121.83">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_203.10.121.83_e000.html" title="Special:Contributions/203.10.121.83">contribs</a>) 00:07, 16 November 2005 (UTC)</small></p>

<p>I agree, I have read Anne Curry's book and it appears to be based on theories. Theories that have been proven wrong, I managed to watch a programme that interviewed a roit control officer, who stated that there was no possible way for the French to become famously tightly packed with the numbers that Curry states. This implies 2 things: 1 The Vangaurd was even bigger than what Curry stated (Curry supports the Vangaurd was enlarged). Or 2 The Number of French were vastly bigger, a view that is supported by most historians and 'reliable' sources. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 82.43.170.96 (<a href="../../../8/2/2E/User_talk%7E82.43.170.96.html" title="User talk:82.43.170.96">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_82.43.170.96_e162.html" title="Special:Contributions/82.43.170.96">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<p>Twelve French knights took oath that that day (the day of the clash at Azincourt) they would either kill King Henry or fall in battle.

<p>"The English archers being thrown forward in wedge-shaped salients with spikes in the ground to cause a horse charge to veer off, almost exactly as at the Battle of Crécy."</p>
<p>The fourth paragraph contains these statements, in direct contradiction: "Near 400 yards from the French line the archers dug-in pointed wooden stakes called palings, at an angle, to ward off cavalry charges, and opened the engagement with a single flight of arrows.

<p>Factually, the real problem with the sentence is that it does not convey that it had been raining for more than just that day. I'm sure if the battle were fought with only the moisture of a sun shower on the ground, then there would have been a different weather dynamic at play.</p>

<dd>I changed the version in which the second sentence ended "...the Hundred Years' War on a rainy day," which implied a <i>very</i> long day indeed. I left the rain out of this sentence, since the paragraph is only the introduction.

<p>Can we be a little more decisive about the issue of casualties? I recognise it's a difficult issue, but could we at least suggest a range? Henry may have been trying to conceal the scale of the English losses, but surely we can do better than 'English losses were lower than the French'. The old Encyclopedia Britannica puts English casualties at 450; if we're going to disagree with this, then I think we have to cite reliable sources. There is a world of difference between a battle in which there were 5,000 French casualties and 500 English, and a battle in which there were 5,000 French casualties and, say, 4,000 English, which the article seems to imply at the moment. Given that, certainly after taking into account those killed and captured in the aftermath of the battle, I don't think anyone would dispute that the French lost quite badly, I'm going to take the liberty of modifying the text to say that the English losses were <i>much</i> lower than the French.</p>

<p>Keegan, in <i>The Face of Battle,</i> says "English casualties had been few: the Duke of York...and the Earl of Suffolk were the only notable fatalities. The wounded numbered only some hundreds..." He adds that the English wounds would have been mainly lacerations and fractures, which if not fatal could be treated. Many of the French, by contrast, would have suffered penetration wounds from arrows or other weapons thrust through weak points in armor. Such wounds led more quickly to serious infection. Those with severe wounds who survived the battle but remained on the field overnight were likely killed the following day, if they had not already died. Keegan says that the bishop of Arras engaged peasants to bury the dead at the site, and adds "they are said to have buried about 6,000 altogether." — <a href="../../../o/t/h/User%7EOtherDave_2915.html" title="User:OtherDave">OtherDave</a> 13:37, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>It appears to be a losing battle to keep the figures consistent, so I suggest we adopt a range approach. i.e. The English army was between 6,000 and 9,000.</p>
<p>If people are going to change these to their own favourite version, could they at least please tell the rest of us where to find these figures, and (more importantly) why we should believe these more than any other figures. While I recognise the Enyclopedia Britannica is not a definitive source, it's quite noticeable that it quotes the French army as 20-30,000, which is 2/3 of the figure we have today (36,000).</p>

<p>Ok, I've made a lot of edits to the numbers. I've settled on 6,000 for the English (which virtually everyone except Anne Curry uses) and 20-30,000 for the French, with notes to see the 'Modern re-assessment' where the controversy is discussed in more detail.</p>
<p>I have no doubt that someone will come along and change this to the figures they saw in a TV programme a few years ago, but we can but try. I'd like to add the "Controverisal" template to the numbers and casualties section, but I've just tried it, and it makes a mess if the Battle Box, so I've left it out.</p>

<p>I think it would be helpful to the article if there were a separate section on troop numbers and casualties, with the Controversial tag. The fact is the sources don't agree, and I think it's correct to tell the reader this. It might also help stop all the to-ing and fro-ing with different numbers being used. Suggested format:</p>
<p>"A Note on Troop Numbers and Casualties"</p>
<p>Controversial tag</p>
<p>Discussion of the different numbers used. Give sources for the different numbers. Explain why one particular set of numbers is used in the article. [Alternatively, we could try and avoid using numbers elsewhere in the article. Or we could use a range of numbers elsewhere in the article.]</p>
<p>A lot of the material from 'A modern re-assessment' could be moved here, because in my opinion 'A modern re-assessment' should be all about Curry's attempt to establish the numbers using things like records of payment. The other sections (discussing numbers more generally) could be moved to the new section.</p>
<p>The "Note" should go near the top, so people read it early on, and don't start changing the numbers in the Battle Box.</p>

<p>I'm leaving this in because it's a good story and I don't think it does any harm, as long as people realise it's a story. However I've taken out the bit about how the king fought more bravely than anyone else, because I can't find a source for it (and neither could anybody else, the "citation needed" has been there for a couple of weeks), and it sounds rather implausible. The King fought more bravely than any of the other 30,000 or so people in the battle? Said who? How on earth would you prove it? If it's supported at all in original sources, I would imagine it must have been said by one of the King's courtiers, or possibly an English storyteller. Neither would be an unbiased source.</p>

<p>John Keegan, in <i>The Face of Battle,</i> says that "extreme bowshot" is traditionally calculated at 300 yards. "That is a tremendous carry for a bow, however" he says, "and 250 yard would be a more realistic judgement of the distance....If, however, [Henry's] archer flanks were thrown a little forward, his center would have been farther off....something between 250 and 300 yards is a reasonable bracket..."</p>

<p>I've rewritten this somewhat, it had become a bit of a mess. Apart from minor errors which crept in, and some superfluous material, Ashmoo had deleted a lot of the text about Anne Curry. According to Ashmoo's comments, it's not Wikipedia's business to make predictions (I assume about which historian will be proved correct).</p>
<p>I take the point, but removing a couple of paragraphs about Curry completely changed the balance of this section, until it became a bit unclear why it was called 'a modern reassessment'. Also we have to have <b>some</b> way of saying that Curry may well be right, but currently her research is unsupported by other people.</p>
<p>This would all get a bit easier if I got around to creating my paragraph on casualties. I will do at some point, honest. Then the Modern Reassessment section can be much more focused on what Curry said.</p>

<p>As far as I can see it:</p>

<p>argument against: it's a bit distracting when trying to understand the article. A large proportion of the French army may well have been Italian for all I know; how relevant is this?</p>
<p>The suggestion was that the reference to the Welsh would be better placed later in the article-perhaps when discussing the armies in detail?- rather than in the opening 'campaign' section.</p>

<dd>Henry was very severely wounded by an arrow from a Welsh archer at the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Shrewsbury_3e1d.html" title="Battle of Shrewsbury">Battle of Shrewsbury</a>, during the rebellion of Welsh prince <a href="../../../o/w/e/Owen_Glendower_bf53.html" title="Owen Glendower">Owen Glendower</a>. The story of how his absolvitory and inclusive policies later enabled him to recruit Welsh soldiers into his army, with complete confidence, is notable and worth including somewhere. However, it's not really part of the story of Agincourt. Many of the original <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indenture.html" title="Indenture">indentures</a> for the supply of troops to the campaign are preserved, as are the <a href="../../../p/i/p/Pipe_roll.html" title="Pipe roll">exchequer rolls</a> recording who received money to pay wages, so there is probably some published research identifying which parts of the realm supplied what troops. Unfortunately I haven't been able to trace any of this, but given the emphasis in England at the time on the training of archers I would be surprised if a "significant proportion" at Agincourt were Welsh. --<a href="../../../o/l/d/User%7EOld_Moonraker_9a8d.html" title="User:Old Moonraker">Old Moonraker</a> 14:19, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As you can see from above there are some different views on the subject. Also there is the question if the English really was that inferior in numbers.<a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article527697.ece" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article527697.ece" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> Also the <i>Battlefield Detectives: Agincourt's Dark Secrets</i> had dubts about the role of the longbow.<a href="http://www.crowddynamics.com/Battlefield%20Detectives/Agincourt.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.crowddynamics.com/Battlefield%20Detectives/Agincourt.htm" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. It may still be the longbowmen that contributed to the English victory, but not the longbow, bur rather short swords, hammers and such close range weapons. OK, these shows get ratings by presenting "new findings", but it can't just be dismissed. // <a href="../../../l/i/f/User%7ELiftarn_fddd.html" title="User:Liftarn">Liftarn</a></dd>

<p>None of this is new, though. We have had enormous trouble with the Agincourt article incorporating Curry's work. I have immense respect for the research she's done, however it's surely clear that this is deliberate revisionism. To use a quote from the link you gave: '“The figures have been exaggerated over the centuries for patriotic reasons,” said Curry, whose book Agincourt: A New History will be published next month. “It was a myth constructed around Henry to build up his reputation as a king.”' She called it 'a new history' and then gave good soundbites, shortly before her book was published. And good luck to her, but surely it's clear that there is an agenda; and just because it's revisionist, doesn't mean it's right.</p>
<p>The fact is she disagrees with just about every other historian who's looked at it, and also the contemporary (admittedly rather unreliable) sources, including the French sources. That doesn't mean she's wrong, but it does mean we should be cautious in accepting everything she says, especially when the book was only published a couple of years ago. I would be very surprised if someone didn't publish a book within the next twenty years which strenuously disagrees with her. With that in mind, it seems sensible to use the previous consensus on numbers when writing the article, but explain the controversy in a separate section, which is what we've done.</p>
<p>As for the effectiveness of the longbow, I do find this rather strange. Undoubtedly armour had moved on since Crecy; but why were the English even bothering to fire if they were completely ineffective! Much is made of the fact that longbows could not penetrate 2mm thick steel plate; but the fact is that not all the French would have been wearing full plate armour, it would not all have been of a uniformly high quality, and even when it was high quality, there were still places (e.g. joints) where arrows could penetrate. The horses were also worse protected than their riders. Medieval English archers carried approximately 48 arrows. They fired a few to start the battle, and then would presumably have been firing at nearly maximum speed through the French cavalry charge and then the men-at-arms advance. The cavalry charge was by all accounts a disaster. Bearing in mind how heavily armoured they were and the mud, the men-at-arms would have been advancing at little more than a jog for the last 100 yards (when the English would have hoped their arrows would be effective). If we say it took them 20-30 seconds to close that distance, that's enough time for the longbowmen to fire four or five shots into the scrum, or approximately 25,000 arrows. This would have been repeated several times as different French waves approached and then retreated. This would have been daunting, to say the least, and the footing would not have been made any easier when the men-at-arms were continuously being buffeted by arrows. The fact that the French were still able to engage the English line suggests strongly that the longbow was not as lethal as it had been, but it seems extraordinary to me to suggest that it caused no casualties at all. If even 1% of 50,000 arrows found a chink in the armour, that's 500 casualties out of 6,000. If 5% of 100,000 arrows hit something significant, that's 5,000 casualties out of 6,000.</p>
<p>Obviously this is all wild speculation. I have no idea how you would prove things one way or the other. But I certainly don't see why the revisionist account is obviously correct.</p>
<p>Incidentally, the link you gave to Battlefield Detectives I think is rather misleading. It seems to imply in the bottom diagram that the English had more men-at-arms than longbowmen, when in fact there were approximately 4 times more longbowmen than men-at-arms.</p>
<p>With all this in mind, I struggle to see why you would disagree that the consensus view is that the longbow helped the English to overcome superior numbers at Agincourt. I am highly dubious that the far greater numbers of French men-at-arms would have been beaten (even with the mud, the crowd, and the longbowmen attacking them with their handweapons), if their advance had not been disrupted by the longbow fire.</p>

<dd>It's not just two positions like a) the longbow singlehandedly won the battle or b) the longbow was utterly useless. The truth is probably somewhere inbetween with many different factors affecting the outcome of the battle. SO the bold thatement about the role of the longbow surely needs a proper source. Especially when there are conflicting views. // <a href="../../../l/i/f/User%7ELiftarn_fddd.html" title="User:Liftarn">Liftarn</a></dd>
</dl>
<p>The statement is that the longbow 'helped the English compensate for their inferior numbers'. It is not: 'the longbow singlehandedly won Agincourt for the English'. I am not even sure that you are disagreeing that the longbow HELPED the English compensate for inferior numbers of (at least) 1.5-1, with most historians going with higher figures. With this in mind, I am therefore going to remove your "citation needed" from that sentence in the introduction.</p>

<dd>I say that the longbow itself had nothing to do with the victory. There are other factors that are far more important. // <a href="../../../l/i/f/User%7ELiftarn_fddd.html" title="User:Liftarn">Liftarn</a></dd>
</dl>
<p>Well then I guess we will have to continue to disagree. You are supporting a revisionist position, I am not. I simply do not see how you can ignore the weapon used by approximately 4/5 of the winning side when considering factors which helped the winning side overcome a significant disadvantage in numbers. You appear to be implying that the English would have still won the battle if the longbowmen had been armed with nothing but hand weapons, and I don't think that is supported by the evidence. If between six and nine thousand heavily armed and armoured French men-at-arms (in the first line) had walked up to the English lines and engaged 1,000 English men-at-arms, then I do not see how the intervention of 5,000 lightly armed soldiers would have been enough to compensate, even allowing for the crush and the mud. It was the men-at-arms' job to fight in a melee, the longbowmen were not particularly trained for this. There is no suggestion that the English men-at-arms were significantly better trained, led or equipped than the French. So either you think the longbow helped the English to win, or you essentially think that 5,000 unarmoured, untrained men were able to overwhelm a larger sized force of professional and well-equipped soldiers, with minimal casualties.</p>
<p>I agree with your earlier statement that "The truth is probably somewhere inbetween with many different factors affecting the outcome of the battle". You may have noticed that I have now changed the account of the fighting to emphasise that advances in armour allowed the French to close, even under a hail of fire. However to say "the longbow itself had nothing to do with the victory" seems far too strong.</p>

<p>I've replaced the controversial statement with the factual one that longbowmen made up the vast majority of the English army. Personally I think you can draw the conclusion from this that the longbow helped in achieving the victory, but you are welcome to draw different conclusions if you wish.</p>

<p>There are a couple of references to a defile, or gorge, constraining the French advance, whereas the action took place in a shallow valley; it was woodland that had the funnelling effect. (The form of the land can be confirmed on Google Earth, although the woodland is now much reduced in favor of agriculture of course). Subject to other editors' views, I propose to change this. --<a href="../../../o/l/d/User%7EOld_Moonraker_9a8d.html" title="User:Old Moonraker">Old Moonraker</a> 14:40, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'd noticed myself that most of the accounts actually refer to the woods constraining movement rather than the sides of a gorge as such. I'd somewhat uncritically kept the accounts of a "defile" because I assumed someone had put it in for a reason and I didn't have anything which directly contradicted it. Also the implication of the Battlefield Detectives site (where they use contour mapping to analyse how the area available to the French declined) is that the contours of the landscape do matter.</p>
<p>Provided you're changing the article based on an analysis of the map and the contours of the land I have no problem with you emphasising the woodland over the gorge. However if we do this then it must raise some questionmarks over the Battlefield Detectives work. Do you have access to maps of the area? How significant are the contours that can be seen on the Battlefield Detectives link?</p>

<dd>I'm keen to do this because of <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>, I'm afraid – a visit to the battlefield while passing through the area: it's still easily identifiable on the ground from the positions of the villages of Tramacourt and Azincourt. It's all quite flat and the contours do not seem significant to the modern eye (although my "battlefield expert" on the day was a former cold war tank commander – not necessarily representative of a C15 soldier's viewpoint!). <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/murky/28979453/" class="external text" title="http://www.flickr.com/photos/murky/28979453/" rel="nofollow">This</a> picture from flckr is nicely representative.</dd>

<p>Actually I just had a quick look at the 1911 EB, and lo and behold, that's where the word "defile" comes from. The original quote is: "The battle was fought in the defile formed by the wood of Agincourt and that of Tramecourt." This has been muddied by someone helpfully explaining that defile = gorge. Looking it up in the dictionary, I think it's probably rather more likely (given the context) that defile is being used in the sense of "narrow passage". It's also noticeable that the EB 1911 makes no mention whatsoever of the ground available to the French narrowing.</p>
<p>Where this leaves the Battlefield Detectives work I'm not completely sure. Not for the first time on Wikipedia, castles may have been erected on shaky foundations!</p>
<p>In any case, I don't think you modifying the article to emphasise the woods vs. the non-existent gorge would be Original Research at all, if anything it would tally better with other versions. Please go ahead. To start with I'm going to change the link for defile because I think it's deeply misleading.</p>

<p>Some excellent work done to the article to remove the defile/ gorge/ woodland confusion. However, I'm not sure about the sentence:</p>
<p>"Keegan (1976) argues that the weapons' main effect was on the horses: only armoured on the head, many could become dangerously out of control when struck in the back or flank from the high-elevation shots used as the charge started."</p>

<dd>I <i>was</i> a bit dubious about dipping a toe into the long-running longbow debate! I cited Keegan for the above sentence, but Barker too, while certainly not disputing the figures you offer, lays emphasis on the significance of the French cavalry charge and the effect of arrows on the horses. I've now expanded this slightly to include her point: how the returning horses added to the confusion and press of the advancing men-at-arms of their own side. --<a href="../../../o/l/d/User%7EOld_Moonraker_9a8d.html" title="User:Old Moonraker">Old Moonraker</a> 14:31, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>They're all good changes, but I've rearranged the text to make it easier to follow the chronology, i.e. mounted charge (and retreat) first, followed by men-at-arms advance (which was probably disrupted by knights' retreat).</p>
