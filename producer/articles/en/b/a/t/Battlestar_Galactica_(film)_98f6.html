<div class="notice spoiler" id="spoiler"><b><a href="../../../s/p/o/Wikipedia%7ESpoiler_warning_6b56.html" title="Wikipedia:Spoiler warning">Spoiler warning</a>: <i>Plot and/or ending details follow.</i></b></div>
<p><i>Battlestar Galactica</i> is set in a distant star system, in an age described as "the seventh millennium of time". Twelve colonies of humans, living on twelve colony worlds, have been fighting a thousand-year war against the <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robotic.html" title="Robotic">robotic</a> race of <a href="../../../c/y/l/Cylon_%28Battlestar_Galactica%29_911f.html" title="Cylon (Battlestar Galactica)">Cylons</a>, who seek to exterminate all of humanity.</p>
<p>The Cylons have unexpectedly sued for peace, through the diplomatic agency of a human, <a href="../../../c/o/u/Count_Baltar_e9af.html" title="Count Baltar">Count Baltar</a>. The human leaders and the commanders of their military fleet are lured into complacency by the Cylon offer of peace. All of the human warships, called "<a href="../../../b/a/t/Battlestar.html" title="Battlestar">Battlestars</a>", are to meet at the armistice talks to participate in the final actions sealing the peace. But it's all a deception - Baltar has betrayed humanity for personal gain, and the Cylons have no intention of making peace.</p>
<p>Adama, commander of the Battlestar <i>Galactica</i>, is the only military officer who's suspicious of the Cylons' motives. He orders a regular patrol consisting of his two best pilots: his eldest son, Apollo, and Lt Starbuck. Adama's younger son, Zac, convinces Starbuck to let him go in his place. The patrol discovers a vast Cylon craft waiting in ambush, but is in turn discovered by the Cylons, who jam all communications. Zac's fighter is hit, reducing his speed, forcing Apollo to leave him behind so that the fleet can be warned. Zac is killed by the Cylons before Apollo can return to save him.</p>
<p>Despite the President's orders for restraint, Adama is able to prepare the <i>Galactica</i> before the Cylon fighter fleet attacks, but all the other Battlestars are unprepared and unable to launch their own fighters. The result is that almost the entire fleet is caught off guard and annihilated. During the battle, Apollo tells Adama that the Cylons' fighter fleet was accompanied by refuelling tankers. Adama realizes that this was done in order to extend the range of the fighters from the Cylon base ships (known as <a href="../../../b/a/s/Basestar.html" title="Basestar">basestars</a>). He orders the <i>Galactica</i> to withdraw, in order to protect his home planet, Caprica. But they are too late: upon arrival they find the devastation the Cylon basestars have left. They soon learn that all twelve colonies have suffered the same fate.</p>
<p>With the colonies in ruins, and the Cylons likely to continue the extermination of humanity, Adama sends out a call for every ship that can make it into space to escape the Cylons. The hope is that the <i>Galactica</i> can protect this fleet long enough to find a legendary thirteenth human colony, the last outpost of Man in all the star systems, which could have sufficient technology to defeat the Cylons. It is on a planet called <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earth.html" title="Earth">Earth</a>. But the location of this lost thirteenth colony is known only to the last lord of <a href="../../../k/o/b/Kobol.html" title="Kobol">Kobol</a>, the planet which was the original home of Man but was abandoned thousands of years earlier when the thirteen colonies migrated to the stars.</p>
<p>Helping Adama in the quest for Earth are Colonel Tigh (who is second in command of the <i>Galactica</i>), and a <a href="../../../s/q/u/Squadron.html" title="Squadron">squadron</a> of viper (fighter) pilots led by Captain Apollo (Adama's son), Lieutenant Starbuck (the <i>Galactica'</i>s best fighter pilot), and Boomer. The Cylon Imperious Leader, determined that no human at all shall survive, orders Baltar's execution. In the film version Baltar is beheaded. But in the television series his execution is halted at the last moment; he is spared in order to help the Cylons hunt down the human fleet, and he becomes the series' chief antagonist, forever in pursuit of the <i>Galactica</i>.</p>
<p>The <i>Galactica</i> and its "ragtag fugitive fleet" find brief respite on the <a href="../../../r/e/s/Resort.html" title="Resort">resort</a> planet of Carillon, where they hope to find food and fuel for their journey. But the Ovions, Carillon's <a href="../../../e/n/d/Endemic_%28ecology%29.html" title="Endemic (ecology)">indigenous</a> insectoid inhabitants, delay them to give the Cylons time to gather forces to destroy them. The Ovions, thinking themselves safe in their mines deep below the surface, begin kidnapping and eating the crew and passengers from the fleet. Apollo and Starbuck investigate the disappearance of some of their comrades and discover the conspiracy. In a <a href="../../../b/l/a/Blaster_%28weapon%29.html" title="Blaster (weapon)">firefight</a> in the mines, the highly volatile Tylium fuel is set on fire, and threatens to blow the planet apart.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the ruling Council, believing the Cylons have been left far behind, propose that the humans pause to celebrate their escape. The Council arranges a banquet on Carillon, and orders all fighter pilots to attend. The Cylons, believing that all of the <i>Galactica'</i>s pilots are at the banquet, launch a fighter attack against the <i>Galactica</i> in orbit. But Adama suspects a trap, and arranges for support crew to impersonate the fighter pilots at the banquet. The real pilots are standing by for trouble, and soundly defeat the Cylon attack.</p>
<p>Apollo realizes the Cylon fighters couldn't have come so far without base ships. He and Starbuck go hunting, and find a Cylon basestar hidden on the far side of Carillon. In defiance of Commander Adama's recall order, they decide to attempt to destroy it, in order to enable the refugee fleet to elude pursuit. They fool the basestar into thinking it's under attack by multiple viper squadrons. The basestar descends into Carillon's atmosphere to avoid detection, and is destroyed when the planet explodes, due to the spreading fire in the Tylium mines.</p>
<p>Despite their victory, the humans realize their enemies will still be pursuing them. Thus, "fleeing from the Cylon tyranny, the last Battlestar, <i>Galactica</i>, leads a rag-tag fugitive fleet on a lonely quest: a shining planet... known as Earth."</p>

<ul>
<li>Humans in this series had their own units for measuring time. Colonial time units do not appear to have exact equivalents in Earth usage, but have rough analogues – a "micron", for example, is roughly equivalent to a second, in the sense that a character might say "Wait a micron!" The time units themselves might not be the same. Other analogous time units include the centon (minute), centar (hour), secton (week), sectar (month), and yahren (year). These units appear to have a decimal arrangement – one centar equals one hundred centons, for example (revealed in the episode "Take the Celestra", among others).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Some <a href="../../../f/a/n/Fanon_%28fiction%29.html" title="Fanon (fiction)">fan</a> materials assume that there is one <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battlestar.html" title="Battlestar">battlestar</a> per colony. This was never stated to be so in the original series; only in the 2003 remake was it ever said that each colony had a battlestar assigned to it. In the original series, only eight battlestars ever actually appeared or were mentioned: Acropolis, Atlantia, Columbia, Galactica, Pacifica, Pegasus, Rycon, and Triton.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Dogs, in the human society of Battlestar Galactica, are known as "<a href="../../../d/a/g/Daggit.html" title="Daggit">daggits</a>". Boxey's robot daggit, Muffitt II, is a mechanical replacement for the one he lost during the destruction of Caprica.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The film was given a theatrical release in Canada and Europe several weeks before its American network TV premier. While received favorably in Canada, very few Americans were even aware of the release, and even fewer entertainment news outlets in the U.S. took notice of the Canadian release until after the show premiered on ABC. The theatrical version was different than the version eventually presented on TV. The Cylons weren't robots in the original version, but rather the Centurions were living creatures wearing armor. Baltar is killed by the Cylons soon after the attack on the colonies. As well, the TV version had Adama and Tigh give away the plot ending, half way through the film.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>After the series' cancellation, the film was edited together into a new theatrical release, with certain scenes trimmed or edited out completely. This release is notable for the incorporation of the <a href="../../../s/e/n/Sensurround.html" title="Sensurround">Sensurround</a> sound enhancement system first introduced in the film <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earthquake.html" title="Earthquake">Earthquake</a> in 1974, and is considered by most critics as perhaps the only film where the technology was used properly.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> It was, in fact, the last film to feature Sensurround.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>In the television episode "Greetings from Earth", the remains of buildings from <a href="../../../e/x/p/Expo_67.html" title="Expo 67">Expo 67</a> in Montreal stand in for the 'capital of Paradeen'. The buildings include the United States, French (now <a href="../../../m/o/n/Montreal_Casino_5d44.html" title="Montreal Casino">Montreal Casino</a>) and British pavilions.</li>

<p>In this 1980 sequel series, the fleet finds Earth and covertly protects it from the Cylons. This series was a quick failure due to its low budget, widely-panned writing, and ill-placed time slot -- Sundays at 7:00 PM, a time slot generally reserved for family-oriented programming and <a href="../../../6/0/_/60_Minutes_b078.html" title="60 Minutes">60 Minutes</a>. The show also included obviously recycled space battle sequences from the original program, to the dismay of fans. Some <a href="../../../t/e/l/Television_syndication.html" title="Television syndication">syndication</a> packages for <i>Battlestar Galactica</i> incorporate the episodes of this series.</p>

<p>The original show has maintained a <a href="../../../c/u/l/Cult_television.html" title="Cult television">cult</a> fandom, which has supported efforts by Glen Larson and Richard Hatch (independent of each other) to revive the premise.

<p>In December <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a>, the American <a href="../../../s/c/i/Sci_Fi_Channel_%28United_States%29_da7f.html" title="Sci Fi Channel (United States)">Sci Fi channel</a> produced and aired a <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battlestar_Galactica_%28TV_miniseries%29_4eb5.html" title="Battlestar Galactica (TV miniseries)">three-hour miniseries</a> that <a href="../../../r/e/b/Reboot_%28continuity%29.html" title="Reboot (continuity)">reimagined</a> <i>Battlestar Galactica</i>. The success of the miniseries led to a new series (October <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>, UK; January <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>, North America). A highly edited version of the miniseries aired on <a href="../../../n/b/c/NBC_89b7.html" title="NBC">NBC</a> on <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_9.html" title="January 9">January 9</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>, five days before the American debut of the series.</p>
<p>Notable changes from the original series include: some Cylon models that closely resemble human form for infiltration; Starbuck is a female character; Boomer, formerly a black man (and genuinely human), is now portrayed by a Korean woman and is covertly a Cylon infiltrator; and Col. Tigh, formerly also portrayed by a black actor, is now portrayed by a white actor. In addition, characters have been given full names (in the original series they were only known by one name). For example, Adama is now William Adama, and Starbuck and Apollo are said to be the callsigns/nicknames of Kara Thrace and Lee Adama, respectively.</p>
<p>Commander Adama is now played by <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_James_Olmos_5434.html" title="Edward James Olmos">Edward James Olmos</a>. Olmos's Adama is still a paternal figure, but differs from Lorne Greene's characterization. The new incarnation of Adama believes Earth is a myth and only makes it the fleet's destination to keep hope alive. Greene's character was both a military commander and a spiritual leader who had been part of the civilian command structure; Olmos's Adama has a definitively military background. In both series, Adama is a capable and insightful leader.</p>
<p>There are fewer ships in this series than the original, only 60 ships are in the fleet (while the original series had 220), but more human survivors -- fifty thousand people are alive as opposed to the original series figure of only 6,000 (episode <i>Greetings from Earth</i>). Space battles take place using Newtonian physics, first seen in a TV series in the sci-fi series <i><a href="../../../b/a/b/Babylon_5.html" title="Babylon 5">Babylon 5</a></i>.</p>

<ul>
<li>A number of BattleStar novels based upon the series have been published over the years, including a mixture of novelizations written by Glen Larson and a series of guest writers who expanded the basic scripts for upon televised episodes (including the pilot episodes of both the original series and <i>Galactica 1980</i>) and what were billed as original stories but were in fact based on scripts originally intended for use in the series never-filmed second season.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>In the 1990s, original series star <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Hatch_%28actor%29_7cda.html" title="Richard Hatch (actor)">Richard Hatch</a> co-wrote several new novels based upon the series as part of his efforts to spark a revival. These novels have met with general success, but while the first three novels received positive marks from critics following the genre, the later novels have not found the same level of support. The primary criticisms being the changes in certain characterizations on the part of Hatch at the suggestions of his co-author(s) - most notably a rather haphazard relationship between Apollo and Casseopea despite major build-ups of the Apollo-Sheba relationship established in the series - which were seen to have weakened the family structure that was arguably one of the series' strengths. In addition, several elements of Hatch's novels have been subtly adapted into the <a href="../../../r/o/n/Ron_Moore_06cc.html" title="Ron Moore">Ron Moore</a> revival series, which critics have argued was the result of Hatch's involvement in the series in the role of <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tom_Zarek_bf41.html" title="Tom Zarek">Tom Zarek</a>.</li>

</ul>
<ul>
<li>A photonovel of the film was released in 1979, and is considered a highly-prized collector's item. While much of this demand was due to each image on each page being taken directly from the actual 35mm film cells, compounding the value was the scarcity of intact copies; the glossy paper used for the print stock did not adhere well to the spine glue, and after several reads the binding tended to fall apart. This was further compounded as the glue became brittle with age.</li>
