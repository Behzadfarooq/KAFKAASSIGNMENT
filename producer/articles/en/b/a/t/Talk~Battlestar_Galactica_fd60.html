<p>What the result was of the Lucas suit against BG's producers. Comments by the actors on the Region 1 DVD of the complete series seem to indicate it was settled with BG agreeing to make certain adjustments to the show, but since the commentary was recorded 25 years after the fact that could be just a guess.

<dd>Hmm, the link you put directs to a fansite which doesn't contain any source citations. So if someone can come up with another source I'd say this could still be open to debate.<br />

However, the fansite's point that BG's biggest rip-off of Lucas was that they were ripping off his being a rip-off, is well taken.

<p>Should there be a split between movie and series. now it's unclear what the difference is between the movie and series. (becauae of the movie box)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think that there should be a split. There is enough information on each to make an article. However, rather than restate the plot of the movie, the series should reference the movie article and state what is different. The movie article should contain stricly information about the movie. The television series should contain much of the information that is outside of the scope of what is actually portrayed, background and references. If no one objects by Saturday, then I'll make this change. If any objections, then we can work them out. <a href="../../../v/a/l/User%7EVal42_2ddd.html" title="User:Val42">Val42</a> 02:40, 27 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Although, Ron Moore, Bonnie Hammers, and Universal Studios claim the series to be a success when the edited mini-series and a year later an episode was shown on NBC-TV network. Both times they sank to the bottom of the Neilsen ratings on the week they aired. As one person noted these did far worst than the original 1978 version of Galactica and worst than the original Star Trek in the 1960s. Which actually ask the question is this "Ron Moore's version as good as the producers and owners say it is?"</p>

<p>I think the section on religious influences belongs in the articles for the 1978 series. Ronald Moore has taken pains in the reimagined series to remove most of the references to Mormonism, with perhaps the sole exception of Kobol. Thoughts? <a href="../../../m/o/k/User%7EMokwella_84bc.html" title="User:Mokwella">Mokwella</a> 20:52, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Although Ronald Moore seems to have removed many of the references to Mormonism, there are still considerable religious influences within the show, such as the parallels between the Lords of Kobol and the Greek Gods, and between the Twelve Colonies and the twelve signs of the zodiac. Also, the religious differences between the monotheistic Cylons and the polytheistic Humans plays a very large role in the reimagined show, particularly in the development of Gaius Baltar's character and the relationship between Helo and Sharon. Perhaps the religious references should be separated by series? I am slightly hesitant to do this, however, because while the references to Mormonism have reduced emphasis in the reimagined series, the references still exist—there is still (or was still) a Quorum of Twelve, many references to the Thirteenth Tribe which settled on Earth, and the reference to Kobol. I say: separate out references which are of import <i>only</i> to the 1978 series, and leave the rest in a general "Religious and mythological references" section. Thoughts? <a href="../../../a/b/h/User%7EAbhorsen327_88ed.html" title="User:Abhorsen327">Abhorsen327</a> 15:25, 1 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>True enough. The broader section on religious themes, which includes the references to Mormonism as one influence, seems to be the way to go. <a href="../../../m/o/k/User%7EMokwella_84bc.html" title="User:Mokwella">Mokwella</a> 01:35, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

== Theblacksuperman 05:30, 17 July 2006 (UTC) Frak, used in "Experiment on Terra" as Starbuck is sliding off his Viper, when some enemies come after him. Near the end I think. But yes, deffintalty used in the origional series. It's the episode that the Ship of Light takes Apollo and sends him to Terra to save the planet from the Eastern Alliance.

<p>A recent edit by DrZarkov to the religious and mythological reference section, specifically the list item regarding Admiral Cain of the Pegasus: <i>Interestingly enough, there is a Pegasus bridge officer with the surname Abel, who was still alive at the end of the second season.</i> I have no memory of this within the re-imagined show. Is this part of the original show? if so, that should be stated. If not, is it a piece of trivia about the re-imagined show that I just don't remember? Either way, I would like an accuracy check on this information. Thanks! <a href="../../../a/b/h/User%7EAbhorsen327_88ed.html" title="User:Abhorsen327">Abhorsen327</a> 12:18, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The character is Ensign Abel Thorton, who appeared in The Captain's Hand.

<p>Not really, unless you're looking to document the huge chip on the shoulders of some original series fans who continue to hate the new series. Colonial Fleets has gone so far as to make discussion of the new series at all a bannable offense. Colonial Fan Force *might* be worth mentioning as a movement to bring forth a continuation series. And I say *might* in that Ron Moore supposedly contributed to it. Plus when you start adding links to these guys sites, you're basically advertising them.

<p>I'm restoring the line about the title sometimes being formatted with a colon, and since I don't want to get into a revert war, I'm justifying it here first. Canon is irrelevant. This is an encyclopedia article, and since the title with colon <i>is</i> sometimes seen (e.g. <a href="http://www.creationent.com/cal/bsgbur.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.creationent.com/cal/bsgbur.htm" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>), the statement belongs on the page. Since it seems out of place at the bottom of the intro where it was, I moved it up to the first paragraph, where it seems more appropriate. -- <a href="../../../f/r/u/User%7EFru1tbat_fa7f.html" title="User:Fru1tbat">Fru1tbat</a> 14:21, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Just because some independent vendor decides to randomly insert punctuation into a show's title doesn't mean it's relevant in an encyclopedic sense. Lots of incorrect spellings and ways of punctuating things are "seen" all over the world, but that doesn't make those errors part of any standard definition. For example, this site (<a href="http://www.animatedbliss.com/DVD/listings.asp?iName=Beavis+And+Butthead" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.animatedbliss.com/DVD/listings.asp?iName=Beavis+And+Butthead" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>), along with many other sources, incorrectly spells "Butt-head" (as in, Beavis and -) as one word, "Butthead." Nobody can get "*NSYNC" right, with errors ranging from "In Sync" to "En Sync" to "N'Sync" to "'N Sync" to to " 'N sync" to " N Sync." Those errors are far more common than "Battlestar: Galactica," but that still doesn't make them relevant to the definition of the term. Unless there's some hugely famous error that the majority of the population makes when pronouncing or spelling a word/phrase, it's not important enough to include in the first paragraph of an encyclopedia article. "Battlestar: Galactica" is a rare enough mistake that most people wouldn't think of it UNLESS someone actively suggested it to them in a situation like this. So let's not go there. And canon is exactly what <b>is</b> relevant when we're trying to objectively define something that's someone else's creation. The mistakes of others are not directly related to the definition of the term itself, and by defining a term, we necessarily bind ourselves to the terms under which the creator names it. The article for "nuclear" shouldn't begin by stating that many people incorrectly pronounce the word "nuke - yoo - lar," it should start off by saying what the word means, point blank. Nobody <i>wants</i> a revert war, but the colon is just plain irrelevant, and until there's an army of people defending its presence with something better than "well, THIS place spells it that way," ... it's out of here. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaprica_c6f0.html" title="User:Caprica">Caprica</a> 20:25, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>In addition to that... Why did anyone add "Pagan"? I'm still unclear on the use of this word. While neo-Paganism may be referred to this way, Galactica hardly refers to the gods in this way. I mean, Hinduism is not strictly monotheistic, but you don't call Hindu gods "Pagan". They're Hindu. Greek gods should be referred to as either ancient Greek gods (or classical, etc) in this context. Seems silly (and agenda-pushing) to do things otherwise. -- <a href="../../../h/i/d/User%7EHidoshi_954c.html" title="User:Hidoshi">Hidoshi</a> 05:25, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

They both have been generalized to mean the same thing today, so the usage you mention is correct by current usage.

<p>Is there some reason that Tektronix, Inc. needs to be the focus of an entire paragraph (one of three) in the main body of the article on the 1978 series? It seems to me that the model numbers of osciliscopes used as props belong, if anywhere, in the trivia section. In my opinion the photo better illustrates the bizzaire usage of egyptian imagery in the costumes and props on the show.

<p>The section at the head of this article, independent of the sections specific to the two versions of the franchise, states that all versions share a general premise, then proceeds to give information specific to the 1978 version of Battlestar Galactica only, without noting it as such. Surely this should be cut down to a more generalized version? 124.168.138.220 09:32, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
