<h2><span class="mw-headline">General copyedit/refactor</span></h2>
<p>Referring to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Battle_of_the_Lower_Dnieper&amp;oldid=51168333" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Battle_of_the_Lower_Dnieper&amp;oldid=51168333" rel="nofollow">this edit</a> - sorry, forgot the edit summary. I've done a general proofread/copyedit/refactor for wikilinks, grammar, removing colorful language and trying for a more neutral and formal/encyclopedic tone. Mentioned Manstein in the aftermath. I haven't substantially changed the content but the whole article reads much better now. Removed some text that appears to be conjecture or possibly original research (mentioned some of this earlier), here are my rationale for the excisions:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>By mid-August, <a href="../../../h/i/t/Hitler.html" title="Hitler">Hitler</a> understood that the Soviet offensive could not be contained - at least, not until some internal disagreement broke out within the <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allies.html" title="Allies">Allies</a>.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Do we really know what Hitler understood at this time...?</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>While this hypothesis could be true to some extent, one must not forget that the action of establishing a bridgehead alone is dangerous enough and can (and usually does) lead to heavy losses.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>This from the Criticisms section didn't follow logically from the "hypothesis"... which in the context of the battle as described is rather self-evident.</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>The right shore was still in German possession for most part, but both sides knew that it would not last for long.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Are we referring to Certain commanders' memoirs, or making blanket statements?</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>German losses, however, are more difficult to evaluate. The simple rule of 3:1 losses during an offensive operation against a heavily defended enemy would lead to a 500,000 casualties toll, reaching the one of Kursk. [...] Indeed, if one considers the casualties per day ratio of Kursk battle, an operation twice as long under similar conditions would lead to a 1,000,000 toll.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>At the very least name the historian using this methodolgy.</p>
<p>One more thing... we should provide compass directions instead of/in addition to "left shore" and "right shore". <a href="../../../h/e/q/User%7EHeqs_0c2c.html" title="User:Heqs">heqs</a> 05:57, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I do not doubt you assume good faith, and I'll review your modifications thoroughly when I'll have more time, but there are some dubious things already: it is not just an "airborne operation", it's "Dnieper airborne operation", and so on. And I think paragraphs you point out as OR and POV should be kept. Maybe expanded and referenced, okay, but kept.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Consensus</span></h2>
<p>I go off to my Jupiter moon-colony (Nasha Europa) for a couple of days, and not only has this discussion not made any headway towards a consensus (which would free all of us to work on our respective WP projects), but all of the proposed "resolutions" seem to focus on trading insults and unnecessary revert wars.</p>
<p>Can we not simply debate the merits of using the term "liberate" and and come to a sensible conclusion? I have read a few basic arguments (hidden among the insults and put-downs) for the use of the term "liberate":</p>
<p><b>1</b>- "Liberate" has been used historically, and continues to be used presently, to describe both this specific incident and other battles where Soviet forces drove back German invaders in WWII. As WP editors, we are bound to use such conventions.</p>
<p><b>2</b>- We apply the term "liberation" to western victories over the German/Axis powers, and not doing so with Soviet victories represents a POV bias.</p>
<p><b>3</b>- The Soviet troops which drove back the German/Axis forces were not foreign invaders but rather people native to the area who fought valiantly to regain control of there homeland while suffering tremendous losses. To remove the tag of "liberation" would not accurately reflect what these people fought and died for.</p>
<p>The request to find a reasonable term which could substitute "liberate" has been met with shocking hostility. (I understand about the past history amongst some members, but if anything, WP has always required equal parts knowledge and diplomacy, so how about we knock off the put-downs and start respecting each other's positions?) Taking off ideas expressed above, here are some contrary opinions about using the term "liberate:</p>
<p><b>A</b>- Even though "liberation" has been used historically to describe these battles, WP's NPOV policy trumps the need to adhere to mainstream or majority opinions on the matter.</p>
<p><b>B</b>- WP describes "liberation" as <i>often understood as "to be freed (or change) from not having freedom to having freedom"</i>. Other definitions cited include <i>to set free, as from oppression, confinement, or foreign control</i>. Under the direction of Stalin (who ruled before and after WWII), the quashing of dissent through executions, deportations to labor camps, and mass forced colonization projects hardly qualified the USSR as a free society.</p>
<p><b>C</b>- The people of present-day Ukraine had already declared independence for the first time in modern history 25 years prior to this battle. The failure of these early Ukrainian states can be attributed in part to foreign agents (both political leaders and paramilitary units) whose goals were eventually realized when the USSR gained control of the territory. Since self-rule would not return to this territory until 1991, any claim of "liberation" is suspect. Other nations in the west who were "liberated" from Nazi occupation achieved self-rule after their "liberation".</p>
<p>Apart from put-downs, are there any other specific justifications to retain the use of the word "liberated"? Does anyone feel that WP:NOV does not trump other WP considerations?</p>
<p>Some alternatives to "liberation" include:</p>
<ul>
<li>took</li>
<li>retook</li>
<li>reclaimed</li>
<li>regained</li>
<li>reappropriated</li>
<li>reassumed</li>

<dd>I say the same thing as I said before, during the nazi period of 3 years 5-8 million people died. Therefore it is clear liberation when someone comes in and stops killing people left and right.

<dd>C:<i>The people of present-day Ukraine had already declared independence for the first time in modern history 25 years prior to this battle.</i> Was there a refferendum held 25 years prior to the battle which confirmed that everybody wanted independence. No. In that case your claim is pure original research, and an anecdotical opinion. There is no proof or disproof that in the Russian Civil War the majority of Ukrainian population did not support the Ukrainian SSR, which in the end triumphed. There is plenty of proof that the absoloute majority of Ukraininans, particulary native of the area that the battle took place in, fought for the Red Army or the Soviet partisans. There is proof for that. There is also proof that after the war they returned to that territory, rebuilt their lives and lived them well only to have 60 years later someone question that they did not fight for their future and were a minority of the wartime Ukrainians. That bullshit will not be allowed into wikipedia, no matter how some POV-pushers will like it to happen. Also the modern Ukraine is a direct successor to the Ukrainian SSR which was a founding republic of the USSR. So in retrospect the UkSSR is the full representetive of Ukrainians during the war, recognised by the internatinal community (and also was the founding member of the United Nations mind you). In 1991 it, according to its agreement willfully left the USSR, following a refferendum that was held. However what is there to assume that the POV of Ukrainians in 1991 was not different than in 1944 or in 1919? Nothing, there is no proof of that and hence original research for those that state that had that refferendum been conducted in 1944 or 1919 it would get the same results. So lets not infest this talk page for the n-th time that Ukrainians who founded the USSR were occupied by it. That is a direct contradiction. --<a href="../../../k/u/b/User%7EKuban_kazak_c2e3.html" title="User:Kuban kazak">Kuban Cossack</a> <a href="../../../r/o/m/Image%7ERomanov_Flag.svg_2101.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/c/c0/Romanov_Flag.svg/25px-Romanov_Flag.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="13" longdesc="../../../r/o/m/Image%7ERomanov_Flag.svg_2101.html" /></a> 11:24, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Grafikm_fr, your counter to point <b>A</b> seems in essence to mirror point <b>1</b>, i.e. as WP editors, we are bound to use the term "liberate" because of the historical tradition of using it. I believe that point <b>1</b> vs. point <b>A</b> should be clarified outside the context of this particular article, but I thought AndriyK did a reasonable job above under the heading <a href="../../../b/a/t/Talk%7EBattle_of_the_Lower_Dnieper_ad95.html#Please_read_WP:NPOV" title="Talk:Battle of the Lower Dnieper">Please read WP:NPOV</a> to argue that WP:NPOV takes precedence over following mainstream historical sources. If possible, please feel free to elaborate further your understanding of why point <b>1</b> trumps point <b>A</b> (your dismissal of point <b>A</b> was quite brief). Thank you for the courteous response though!</p>
<p>Kuban Kazak and SuperDeng seem to disagree with point <b>B</b>, which contends that the WP definition of <i>liberate</i> conflicts with conditions within the USSR under the rule of Stalin. I will not challenge Deng's assertion that the population of the UkSSR grew after the war, and I will also add the the economy prospered. However this does not counter the executions and deportations to labor camps which were used to suppress the populace. As WP itself states that is what occured during Stalin's reign, point <b>B</b> does not question the existence of the UkSSR, but rather the conditions that existed therein. Political dissent was literally slaughtered in the USSR, and this cannot be described as "liberty". Furthermore, I don't dismiss acomplishments made by the people of the Ukrainian SSR, but according to WP <i>the Ukrainian SSR had no independent voice in international affairs</i>. How does that square with assertions of sovereignty?</p>
<p>As to point <b>C</b> (which I believe is only brought up by me), I believe that Ukraine's attempt at self-rule at the beginning of the 20th century fundamentally alters the argument of "liberty". Can you clarify the example of Brittany once more? I don't seem to understand the analogy quite fully.--<a href="../../../t/u/f/User%7ETufkaa_fb6c.html" title="User:Tufkaa">tufkaa</a> 16:40, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That my freind is a POV in retrospect to political liberty in UkSSR. However political dissent was equally persecuted in other areas of the USSR. However nobody questions that the Soviet Union liberated the Russian or Belarusian territories. Finally comparing a genocidal regime which burned thousands of Ukrainian villages to the regime which allowed those villages to be rebuilt, re-settled and for the offspring to live their lives. I think the spectrum is quite different. Finally we are not disscussing the Soviet Purges which took place mostly AFTER the war. We are discussing that the Soviet Union was an equal participant in the anti-hitler coalition and deserves <b>no double standards</b> in its role (might I say the most important role) of freeing Europe from Tyranny. --<a href="../../../k/u/b/User%7EKuban_kazak_c2e3.html" title="User:Kuban kazak">Kuban Cossack</a> <a href="../../../r/o/m/Image%7ERomanov_Flag.svg_2101.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/c/c0/Romanov_Flag.svg/25px-Romanov_Flag.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="13" longdesc="../../../r/o/m/Image%7ERomanov_Flag.svg_2101.html" /></a> 16:51, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><i><b>"Can you clarify the example of Brittany once more? I don't seem to understand the analogy quite fully."</b></i></p>
<dl>
<dd>Once upon a time, that was a country named Brittany, ruled by its own ruler. Then in 16th century, it was annexed by the French crown, or as Brittany nationalist could say, "occupied". France staged a very aggressive "francisation" of Brittany, trying to make their native tongue and their traditions disappear. Breton was forbidden in schools, Breton nationalists were sent to prison and so on. And here are still some terrorist acts performed in the name of independent Brittany.</dd>
<dd>Then, in 1940, France (and Brittany) got invaded by the Third Reich. Naval bases were installed in Brest and Nantes, German planes were flying from there, the Atlantikwall was built, and so on. In short, it was occupied.</dd>
<dd>Then in 1944, after heavy fight, it fell back in French hands. Did Bretons got their self-ruling? No. Did they got their own elected governement? No, they got De Gaulle. According to your own criteria, they were not "liberated".</dd>
<dd>But still, will someone consest the words "Liberation of Brest"? No. Why? Because these are words used by anyone in this world, by all people freed from Nazism.</dd>

<p>What double standard applies to the Great Purge? WP describes "liberation" as <i>"to be freed (or change) from not having freedom to having freedom"</i>. Executions, suppression of political dissent, religious persecution and deportation to labor camps are not representative of a society "having freedom". I don't know anyone who would consider people in or outside of Ukraine subject to these policies as "having freedom". This is the crux of point <b>B</b>: using "liberation" in this context seems to be a POV contrary to the meaning of the word. If I were to compare post-war France with the Stalinist USSR, would the comparison with Brittany stand? --<a href="../../../t/u/f/User%7ETufkaa_fb6c.html" title="User:Tufkaa">tufkaa</a> 22:08, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Of course it would. Because there wasn't just Ukraine. Why do you contest the word "liberation" for Kiev and for Ukraine, but do not contest it for Stalingrad, Orel, Rostov, Minsk or whatever else city in Russia, Bielorussia or Moldavia occupied by the Nazis?

<dd>I am addressing the situation Ukraine because that is the territory covered in the article. I do not think that there is anything "special" about requesting that "liberate" not be used to describe conditions which included executions, suppression of political dissent, religious persecution and deportation to labor camps.

<p>Furthermore, did Brittany make a similar push for independence as Ukraine did at the beginning of the 20th century?

<dd>There were many French who "fought to stay in jail" - like the 33rd Waffen SS Charlemagne (also fought against Red Army in Ukraine in '44). Vichy France was recognized by Western governments - does that automatically make it a legitimage government? When was the Ukrainian SSR first recognized? Can't say I disagree with AndriyK here. Nazi propaganda up and down the eastern front portrayed Hitler as the ultimate liberator as his armies advanced. Much of what came the other way was also propaganda. Some of it is being used as source here, in the form of Soviet anthems and such.

<dd>People seem to be forgeting the major thing which is that the Nazis systematically carried out genocidal policies against Jews, and deported others (mainly Ukrainians) to work in Germany. Under these circumstances, most people living on the occupied territory passively or actively opposed the Nazis. Total civilian losses during the war and German occupation in Ukraine are estimated between five and eight million, including over half a million Jews shot and killed by the <a href="../../../e/i/n/Einsatzgruppen.html" title="Einsatzgruppen">Einsatzgruppen</a>, sometimes with the help of Ukrainian collaborators. Of the estimated eleven million Soviet troops who fell in battle against the Nazis, about a quarter (2.7 million) were ethnic Ukrainians. Ukraine is distinguished as one of the first nations to fight the Axis powers in Carpatho-Ukraine, and one that saw some of the greatest bloodshed during the war.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Mediation thoughts</span></h2>
<p>While I don't object to mediation per se I think in this case it would be a waste of time because two many parties are involved in the argument and more will get involved. Any party that did not particiapte in mediation (of the current and/or future editors) are not bound by it in any way and the agreed version may be easily destroyed by a newcoming editor who has no reason to accept the mediation where he wasn't involved. Mediation may be useful when a number of parties are small 2-3, 4 max. Here, the right way would have been the article's RfC. However, the article's RfC is aimed at generation wider attention and here the attention is already wide and sampling is representative. The only way I see here is either a compromise or a straw-poll since the total consensus is unreachable, especially since the most fervent editor here, user:AndriyK is known to persist with his views no matter how many people oppose it and do all he can to force his views into the article no matter how strong the opposition is, either by frivolous irreversible moves moving <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_AndriyK_ce16.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/AndriyK">see this</a> or by tag trolling, that is throwing tags left and right, mostly with the refusal to discuss, followed by rabid revert-warring just 1 step under 3RR. These are all "quick-fix" tactics aimed at pushing as much POV as possible with as little effort as possible. The user haven't yet written anything for this and most other artciles he damaged. I will make a formal case on this behavior separately. In the meanwhile let's talk and try to find a compromise, if we can't all agree. --<a href="../../../i/r/p/User%7EIrpen_a72e.html" title="User:Irpen">Irpen</a> 18:47, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well if we ignore AndriyKs trolling on the talk pages then really the main argument that people are trying to voice is wether we should have a double standard on the role that the USSR played in humanity's conquest to free the world from fascist tyranny. Although I do know that some neo-nazis would become very upset, but the majority educated and respectible historians and politicians in the west and in ex-USSR, all uniltaterally see that the USSR, the nation which contributed the decisive outcomes of the war might I add, has a fully equal and god-given right to be amogst that group. The fact that the Soviet society was not ideal is something that belongs in the USSR article, not here. As for that fact the postwar Europe also falls short of that title. Think about MacCartnitism or Franco's regime to name a few. However the DDay article does not say about the fact that after the war in America there was apreheid against the Black population in the South? No it does not. So again the question about having double standards for USSR and for the west is rediculous and downright insulting for many people. BTW Anryusha, if the USSR was oppressive, how could there be so many veternans that would never say a word against the coutnry that they fought. I know USSR was not perfect, but it was their homeland, homeland of Russians, Ukrainans, Belarusians...etc. Those nationalities did not fight for their freedom, they fought for their right to existance. In that context they freed their land so they could live on it. --<a href="../../../k/u/b/User%7EKuban_kazak_c2e3.html" title="User:Kuban kazak">Kuban Cossack</a> <a href="../../../r/o/m/Image%7ERomanov_Flag.svg_2101.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/c/c0/Romanov_Flag.svg/25px-Romanov_Flag.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="13" longdesc="../../../r/o/m/Image%7ERomanov_Flag.svg_2101.html" /></a> 19:14, 5 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, USSR was not "imperfect" but pretty bad in many ways. However, this doesn't exclude the usage of the term as most respected historians use it. And please, no BS that "they are not neutral". The reputation of being not neutral is a kiss of death to the standing of a historian among his peers. Same applies to Britannica and Columbia. They do have NPOV policy as well as adherence to the mainstream. This is a definition of an encyclopedia. So, don't invent the bycicle with new terminology here. --<a href="../../../i/r/p/User%7EIrpen_a72e.html" title="User:Irpen">Irpen</a> 19:20, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>And Mbuk (an others), I am not arguing for using of the term liberate uniformly thoughout the article. Besides, that would be a bad style. However, I oppose someone's coming and purging the word from an entire article, as well as from entire set of GPW-related articles even more. I suggested the compromise as per the usage: the term can be used among others (but pls no occupation to 43-45 events, leave this for '39). My opponent here just pruges the word, replaces it with some other, tags the article and leaves. So tiresome but there will be an end to that. --<a href="../../../i/r/p/User%7EIrpen_a72e.html" title="User:Irpen">Irpen</a> 20:41, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think that the "discussion" (if we can call it that at times) breaks down when it veers into personal beliefs. I believe we can avoid such volatile discussions by separating the various disagreements and the arguments contained therein. I posit that the entire dispute would be resolved on the outcome of this first disagreement:</p>
<ul>
<li>Whereas, "liberate" has been used historically, and continues to be used presently, to describe both this specific incident and other battles where Soviet forces drove back German invaders in WWII, as WP editors we are bound to use such conventions. Others such as myself contend that whereas "liberation" has been used historically to describe these battles, WP's NPOV policy trumps the need to adhere to mainstream or majority opinions on the matter. (See points <b>1</b> and <b>A</b> above.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Resolving this disagreement would end the entire debate, because even if "liberate" proved to be a POV term, it would be overuled by the historical precedent argument.</p>
<p>Apart from this first disagreement, there is the related disagreement regarding the nature of "liberate" itself:</p>
<ul>
<li>Whereas, WP describes "liberation" as <i>often understood as "to be freed (or change) from not having freedom to having freedom"</i>, and still other definitions cited included "to set free, as from oppression, confinement, or foreign control", under the direction of Stalin (who ruled before and after WWII), the quashing of dissent through executions, religious persecution, forced mass relocations, and deportation to labor camps hardly qualified the USSR as a free society. Others contend that whereas we apply the term "liberation" to western victories over the German/Axis powers, to not do so with Soviet victories represents a POV bias.</li>
</ul>
<p>This becomes a question of whether "liberate" is inherently biased when used in this context.</p>
<p>The third disagreement can be had over not just whether the people of the Ukrainian SSR enjoyed freedom, but whether it was an occupied territory:</p>
<ul>
<li>Whereas, the Soviet troops who drove back the German/Axis forces were not foreign invaders but rather people native to the area who fought valiantly to regain control of there homeland, and suffered tremendous losses in the process, to remove the tag of "liberation" would not accurately reflect what these people fought and died for. At the same time, the argument is presented that the citizens inhabiting the area of present-day Ukraine had already declared sovereignty for the first time in modern history not 25 years prior to this battle, and whereas the failure of these early Ukrainian states can be attributed in part to foreign agents (both political leaders and paramilitary units) whose goals were eventually realized when the USSR gained control of the territory, any claim of "liberation" is suspect since self-rule would not return to this territory until 1991. Furthermore, other nations in the west who were "liberated" from Nazi occupation achieved self-rule after their "liberation".</li>
</ul>
<p>I think we should discuss each disagreement discretely and focus on the respective arguments contained therein in as detached a manner as possible, seeing as how this might touch upon sensitive topics for some.--<a href="../../../t/u/f/User%7ETufkaa_fb6c.html" title="User:Tufkaa">tufkaa</a> 00:05, 6 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The case is really very simple: the Soviets kicked the Nazis out (which is good), but then themselves once again occupied the land (which is not). Which of the two totalitarian regimes was worse is to be disscussed at <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Socialism_62c4.html" title="National Socialism">National Socialism</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communism.html" title="Communism">Communism</a> and is beyond the scope of this article. Here a neutral term should be used.</p>
<p>A few extremely stupid arguments have been used: one is that the government officials use the term liberation, note however that they are politicians and use political, not encylopedical language, the government has chosen to attempt to appease the Russians (btw just recall with what rabid hatered Russia reacted when leaders of the Baltic state refused to legitimize the Russian victory celebrations with their presence one year ago today). Even worse is the claim that Ukraine could have just left the Soviet Union as it did in 1991, recall to what happened to Czechoslovakia and Hungary, which actually were formally independent states, of course the sort of people that make such an argument will probably argue that the Soviet Union was asked to help by the silent majority and had to defend those states from Nazism, Americans and the Vatican.

<dd>I glanced through the disscussion and but it clearly refers to official government use, never the less the second paragraph of my post is just an ilustration (and there are many more stupid arguments used, and most of disscussion consists of repiting the over and over, and expressing well deserved but irrelevent in this context admiration for the individual soldiers instead of presenting some arguments for to allow the use word liberation to imposing half a century of communist rule by the soviet army). Please comment on the first paragraph.</dd>
<dd>BTW I have noticed that it seems most of the people most agressivley opposing using neutral wording are Russians, while the ones demanding neutral wording are Ukrianians or of the closely related (and today with very cordial mutual political relations) Polish.

<dd>Communism and Nazism are too oposite things. Ukrainians fought against the Germans for their land to live on it. Today on the news millions of Kievans celebrated Victory over Nazism. Had Kiev not been liberated it would have been a German colonial city right now with Ukrainian population exterminated. That is the difference. Nobody has the right to challenge the actions that those brave men and women did to achive victory 61 years ago. There is no double standards for eastern and western fronts. As for nationality then know this my ancestors are Zaporozhian Cossacks whilst my wife is from Western Ukraine, oh and Poles are not Ukrainians, that is a rediculous comment.--<a href="../../../k/u/b/User%7EKuban_kazak_c2e3.html" title="User:Kuban kazak">Kuban Cossack</a> <a href="../../../r/o/m/Image%7ERomanov_Flag.svg_2101.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/c/c0/Romanov_Flag.svg/25px-Romanov_Flag.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="13" longdesc="../../../r/o/m/Image%7ERomanov_Flag.svg_2101.html" /></a> 18:50, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>First, care to read the discussion, not "glance through it". We are talking mainly about the Western historians' usage. Govs are mentioned only sparingly. Second, register, it would make a debate easier. Third, don't call what other people say "stupid". It is offensive and useless. Third, and most importantly, don't stereotype the nationalities. It is even more offensive and useless. Besides, you happen to be wrong here by generalizing over both Ukrainians and Poles. Just shows you didn't read what you are commenting on. The issue here is not who was better and who was worse. The issue is the usage of the word most accepted in the historiography. The historiography is the main source for the articles. Please care to read the entire discussion (not glance through it), as a courtesy to its participants, before providing giving any further comments. --<a href="../../../i/r/p/User%7EIrpen_a72e.html" title="User:Irpen">Irpen</a> 18:47, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>First and foremost communism is no more the opposite of national socialism then typhus is opposite of plague. Second this isn't a place for "what-if"ing, the third reich could have just as well gradually decayed after Hitlers death and eventaully collapsed under it's own weight and outside pressure as it could have lasted for a 1000 years, none of this is relevent here. I belive I have already addressed cynicly wiping ones mouth with the people who fought in this war and am not going to return to it. As for the eastern and western fronts the situation there were radically diffrent and it's absurd to pretend it's neutral to describe both the same way. And finally I really do not see the use of continuing to disscus with someone who belives he can set the clock back by 20 years by writing nonsense.</dd>
<dd>and on the margin, you are aware that your communist heroes murdered far more Russians then they did any of the other conquered nations. Of course you are going likely to reply with something like "there were mistakes but back then Russia was strong and respected" so don't bother.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As for mr. Irpen. I do not know what went on in the heads of Western historians, it's likely they simply copied the term with out giving much thought to it or tried to apply Western standards to situation without fully understanding, never the less we are not those people and we are aware of how life under soviet rule looked (I assume this applies also to you). When a comment is clearly absurd how would you describe it, how for example would describe comparing McCarthyism with a regime that is responsible for murdering tens of millions of people? As for Poles and Ukrainians I freely confess that I'm not intimitly familiar with either of them, however it's well known that those nations are closely related (I've been told that Ukrainians are closer to Slovaks but there are less of those and they don't have common history, but this is OT). I only know a few Poles and Ukrainians but the similiarity of their languages is quite striking to me. I'd like to clearly point out the issue here is usage of neutral language (required by wikipedia policies) it is not about how you remeber the soviet union or what you think of surrounding nations and there is really no use to attempt to find some clever tricks to preserve biased languages as it won't change any of that anyway.

<dd>I sincerley apologize if I have somehow unwillingly offended you, it was not my intention to claim that somehow all Russians are evil imperialists or anything of that sort, quite to the contrary working at a large international petrolium company I meet a lot of young, educated Russians and most of them are really nice people. None are interested in reconquering anything but simply in supporting their families, buying house and so on, not unlike our European or American pears, and living their life in Russia. As for what was happening 60 years ago, no the western front was not populated by angles, nor was the eastern by devils, there were however deep diffrences the two. The most important of them is that USA and UK weren't led criminal genocidal regimes and their leadership was interested in eliminating the nazi threat not in reconquering territories they have previously occupied and then expanding their rule further (and lest you forget Stalin set out to that goal together with Hitler before the 2nd changed his mind regarding this alliance). As for western historians I wouldn't go so far as to call them morons, I'd guess they were simply ignorant of Eastern Europe, had no way on conducting research on place and most refugees that could provied information about what was actually going in the soviet union were from Russia and themselves biased. I don't really see why you cling to the fact that historians used the word "liberate" instead of stepping back looking at situation and thinking what actually happend the nations of soviet republic free, Ukrainians, Azerbaijanis, Georgians, Estonians and so on aren't celebrating liberation only the end of the war perhaps this differs from your take on the events but I would ask that strive to describe them in neutral terms. --217.25.31.2 05:38, 10 May 2006 (UTC)

I can't belive I'm actually seeing someone using the negro lynching argument, it seems as if I'm back in my school days. Had the Americans deported them to Alaska maybe one could try to compare it and still it wouldn't be any where near even the amount of people the soviet have murdered of their own. The above post like this clearly shows that this disscussion isn't about what it should but about trying to defend the "glory" of the soviet union from all those traitorus republics. btw have you noticed UK hasn't tried to colonize Europe and the USA hasn't forced racial discrimination upon it?

The first disagreement seems to be a yes-or-no answer: either WP:NPOV trumps mainstream/moajority opinion or it doesn't. Only if WP:NPOV trumps mainstream/moajority opinion should we move on to the next disagreement.<br />
The next disagreement asks for a definition of "liberation": in my opinion, and judging by most definitions I've come across, "liberation" is equated with "freedom" first and foremost, rather than a transfer of power through military force regardless of freedom. In contrast to the first disagreement, I think that this debate will require an extended discussion past a simple yes or no. If use of the term "liberation" is inseparable with the concept of freedom, only then should we continue to the last question.<br />
The third disagreement asks, "What was the condition of the 'liberated'? Were the people free or not?" This will require the most extended discussion, but please don't skip ahead to this disagreement without settling the others. If the first two disagreements are settled, then this disagreement, which is perhaps the hardest to settle of all, will not have to drag us down into the muck of personal beliefs.--<a href="../../../t/u/f/User%7ETufkaa_fb6c.html" title="User:Tufkaa">tufkaa</a> 21:52, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

In this article and others WP:NOR can overrule WP:NPOV in some instances and in others WP:NPOV can overrule WP:NOR for a variety of reasons, and all that matters is that most editors agree. Some parties present believe, however, that in this particular circumstance (using "liberate"), a POV dispute does not apply. We can return to the question of its application to this article after examining the next disagreement, which essentially attempts to define "liberation" for the context of this dispute.

<dd>To me the definition of "liberate" is clear, and it involves agreed upon principles of freedom. The only possible work-around I could imagine would be the use of a particular military definition that does not take into account the concepts of "freedom" or "liberty". This would be highly circumspect in my opinion, however, due to the preponderance of definitions tying "liberation" with "freedom".--<a href="../../../t/u/f/User%7ETufkaa_fb6c.html" title="User:Tufkaa">tufkaa</a> 18:56, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You said it yourself: <i><b>To set free from foreign control</b></i>.

<dd>The quoted definition was "to set free, as from oppression, confinement, or foreign control". Wouldn't it be a stretch to accept "to set free... from... foreign control," while at the same time contradicting "to set free, as from oppression, [or] confinement"? The definition is "to set free," while "as from oppression, confinement, or foreign control" is a secondariy statement meant to further elaborate on the subject. In an instance where you would set up conflicts with the majority of the opinion ("free," "oppression," "confinement") while adhering to only one part ("foreign control"), it is my understanding that an editor would substitute "liberate" with a word whose entire definition fits the statement.--<a href="../../../t/u/f/User%7ETufkaa_fb6c.html" title="User:Tufkaa">tufkaa</a> 22:27, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It seems as if though we aren't getting through to each other. The soviet union was a criminal genocidal regime, the USA and UK were not. Regardless the shotcomming of those two countries the peopl, that lived in them were free. Were not disscussing some abstract metaphysical concept here: they did not need to fear every day for their property and their lives at the hands of their own government. They could worship God, engage in political debates, peacefully express discontent.

<p>Whether or not to use a substitute term in place of "liberate" is not the focus of this disagreement, and to bring NOR vs. NPOV into this discussion brings us right back to square one, which was an endless loop of reverts and disrespectful put-downs. This particular disagreement centers on whether it is accurate (outside of NOR vs. NPOV debates) to use the term "liberate" to describe the actions taken in the article. Where we are not "getting through to each other" is in not accepting each other's statements as coming from a factual place. With that said, I would like to acknowledge that it is correct to state that other references have described the vanquishing of the German forces in WWII as "liberating" acts. I guess what I'm looking for is a little more clarity when using the term "liberate", especially since its use here contradicts the majority of its definitions, if not the entire spirit of the word. However, it does not seem as if many people are willing to acknowledge even the meaning of the word or the inherent disconnect of using it in the context of the conditions prevalant in Stalin's USSR.--<a href="../../../t/u/f/User%7ETufkaa_fb6c.html" title="User:Tufkaa">tufkaa</a> 22:22, 11 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

I would like to repeat my question addressed to Tufkaa whether <i>his</i> considering "liberation" inapropriate equally applies to the cities of the Russian Federation (Rostov, Smolensk). Does <i>he</i> sees it as objectionable for the cities of Ukraine (Kiev and Lviv) as of Russia.</p>
<p>Grafikm_fr, I think you are mistaken to call Tufkaa (not some others here) a Russophobic POV pusher. He didn't say, like <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndriyK_f787.html" title="User:AndriyK">someone</a> above that it was Soviet reoccupation (sic)<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ABattle_of_the_Lower_Dnieper&amp;diff=50281621&amp;oldid=50278610" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ABattle_of_the_Lower_Dnieper&amp;diff=50281621&amp;oldid=50278610" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> or "Nazi occupation was bad and soviet "occupation" (sic) was no better".<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ABattle_of_the_Lower_Dnieper&amp;diff=50300096&amp;oldid=50298907" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ABattle_of_the_Lower_Dnieper&amp;diff=50300096&amp;oldid=50298907" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> Neither, like <a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalibutt_9a46.html" title="User:Halibutt">another fellow</a> right above here, he tries to use an inapplicable analogy between the Soviet '39 advance into Western Ukraine (certainly occupation) with '43-'45 advance into the same Ukraine and even the rest of Europe. Tufkaa is the only opponent of the term who actually tries to listen here and talk about issues one by one.</p>
<p>The other two talk nothing new. Speaking about German liberation of Kiev or Lviv in '41 by Halibutt and claiming it to be one and the same doesn't really warrant a serious response. However, I think talking with Tufkaa makes sense and I would like to hear his opinion on that.</p>
<p>Let's just but some framework on this. We can't use the terms not established in the respectable literature. As such, Halibutt's "German liberation of Kiev" {1941) or of Lviv or of whatever analogies do not really merit a response. --<a href="../../../i/r/p/User%7EIrpen_a72e.html" title="User:Irpen">Irpen</a> 17:24, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm not applying a double standard to anyone.

<dd>No, liberation is not a military term but a political. The very point of disscussion is (or at least should be) not similarites and diffrences between national socialists and communists but replacing a political term ("liberated" which is clearly positivly charged and wrong in this context) with a neutral technical military term like "retook". The term "retook" clearly indicates soviets controlled this territory before Germans did and avoids making judgment toward the legitimicy of their rule there (this judgment belongs in articles like "history of Ukraine" and "soviet union" not in every article about every battle fought). --217.25.31.2 19:18, 13 May 2006 (UTC)

It is clear the word "liberation" has positive emotional values associated with it. By literally applying the above definition one could indeed argue that Ukraine was liberated in 1941 as an outside military force (the nazis) has removed unwanted control (the soviets) from an area (Ukraine).

<p>Easy! It is simply the appropriate word, used by the mainstream sources, all major encyclopedias, major WWII historians as well as the modern governments of the territories we are talking about. For any statement (like the Earth is round, the Holocaust exterminated the European Jewery and other similar well known) there may be someone that would dispute it.

<p>Speaking as an historian who has read more than a few books on World War II - I side with the use of the word "liberation". Having read all this talk (and boy is there a lot) I think the arguements are (1) it is very common usage in both primary AND secondary sources (2) it is how the people living in the Ukraine at the time thought about the arrival of the Soviet army. By and large the majority of the population in the Ukraine, based on how they reacted at the time, were glad to see the Soviet army. This was not Soviet propaganda, this was the large-scale response by the population. See the recently published book "A writer at war" (Antony Beevor, 2005) pg. 267 etc.). To assert that - contrary to what the people thought at the time - that the Soviet army was not liberating the Ukraine from a hated (and hateful) rule by the Nazi goverment; is not supported by the overwhelming weight of historical evidence. <a href="../../../c/g/l/User%7ECglassey_8e74.html" title="User:Cglassey">Cglassey</a> 01:00, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The poles didnt live in slavery after they were liberated by the Soviets, life became many many times better for the poles then it was during the nazies. The nazies did inslave the poles and did very efficiently exterminate the poles. The Soviets did not. This is what happened to the poles during nazi rule; Large numbers were expelled from areas intended for German colonisation, and forced to resettle in the General-Government area. Hundreds of thousands of Poles were deported to Germany for forced labour in industry and agriculture, where many thousands died. Poles were also conscripted for labour in Poland, and were held in labour camps all over the country, again with a high death rate. There was a general shortage of food, fuel for heating and medical supplies, and there was a high death rate among the Polish population as a result. Finally thousands of Poles were killed as reprisals for resistance attacks on German forces or for other reasons. In all, about 3 million (non-Jewish) Poles died as a result of the German occupation, more than 10 percent of the pre-war population. When this is added to the 3 million Polish Jews who were killed as a matter of policy by the Germans, Poland lost about 22 percent of its population, the highest proportion of any country in World War II. Rather than through being sent to concentration camps, most non-Jewish Poles died through in mass executions starvation, singled out murder cases, ill-health or forced labour. Apart from Auschwitz, the main six "extermination camps" in Poland were used almost exclusively to kill Jews. There was also camp Stutthof concentration camp used for mass extermination of Poles. There were a number of civilian labor camps (Gemeinschaftslager) for Poles (Polenlager) on the territory of Poland. Many Poles did die in German camps. The first non-German prisoners at Auschwitz were Poles, who were the majority of inmates there until 1942, when the systematic killing of the Jews began. The first killing by poison gas at Auschwitz involved 300 Poles and 700 Soviet prisoners of war, among them ethnic Ukrainians, Russians and others. Many Poles and other Eastern Europeans were also sent to concentration camps in Germany: over 35,000 to Dachau, 33,000 to the camp for women at Ravensbruck, 30,000 to Mauthausen and 20,000 to Sachsenhausen, for example. And you believe this is is better then what happened after the Soviets liberated Poland???

The most popular methods of extracting confessions include ripping off fingernails slowly, applying “temple screws” [i.e., clamps that crush the victim’s skull], and putting on “American handcuffs.” The last named method causes the skin on one’s hands to burst and the blood to flow from underneath one’s fingernails. The torture is applied passionlessly in a premeditated manner. Those who faint are revived with a morphine shot. Before the torture session some receive booster shots [zastrzyki wzmacniające ]. The torturers strictly observe the opinion of the chief interrogating officer whether it is acceptable to allow the interrogated to die…. At the infamous Lublin Castle [prison], because of the injuries inflicted during interrogation, mortality among the political prisoners reaches 20 persons per week.</i> This is how this "liberation" looked like. --<a href="../../../m/o/l/User%7EMolobo_4aaf.html" title="User:Molobo">Molobo</a> 20:43, 13 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>And more importantly compare what the Soviets did to what the Nazies did the Soviets didnt do any of this; Large numbers were expelled from areas intended for German colonisation, and forced to resettle in the General-Government area. Hundreds of thousands of Poles were deported to Germany for forced labour in industry and agriculture, where many thousands died. Poles were also conscripted for labour in Poland, and were held in labour camps all over the country, again with a high death rate. There was a general shortage of food, fuel for heating and medical supplies, and there was a high death rate among the Polish population as a result. Finally thousands of Poles were killed as reprisals for resistance attacks on German forces or for other reasons. In all, about 3 million (non-Jewish) Poles died as a result of the German occupation, more than 10 percent of the pre-war population.

<dd>OK, I have looked at the users you are afraid of (even though it's not really in any way relevent here). It seems the only reason the first one of them has been blocked is that he was less fluent in English and heavily outnumbered by editors presenting antiukrainian POV, I haven't noticed him doing anything really bad like flinging insult all around. The second one actually seems to be an excellent editor, his request for adminship had an overwhelming majority in support although I have noticed most of the opposition came from one specific editor (suprisingly also generally a fairly good one) who organised an aggressive and distastefull campaign against him.

<dd>Deng, the population of Poland dropped by 6,000,000 people (from 35,000,000 in 1938) in the effect of the Nazi occupation. After the war, by 1946, it dropped by additional 5,000,000 in the effect of the Soviet annexation of roughly half of Poland. So, demographically speaking, both occupiers were comparable.</dd>
<dd>Grafikm, you claim that you're <i>facing POV-pushers that won't even be satisfied with a NPOV version</i>.

</dl>
<p>That shows the merit of your argument, Halibutt. The 5 mln "drop of population" in PL was not because 3 mln Polish Jews and another 3 million Polish Poles were exterminated (like was the case in a <i>real occupation</i>", but because of the border change in result of which population who were formerly Polish citizens (and very much discrimated ones, as was the case for the Ukrainian and Belarussian majority population of the territories belonging to the nationalist Polish state) became Polish citizens no more. No one tries here to justfy Stalin imprisonments and deportation but you can't even compare that in good faith to the Nazi extermination machine. That's as far as your newly invented twisted argument is conserned.</p>
<p>As for the compromise solution, it was proposed here many times. Liberation can be used along with other words accepted in the mainstream. No one is going to put it in every sentence, that would be poor even styllicstically. But no one can roam into the article written in agreement with wolrd-wide accepted terminology, that a good faith contributor took great pains to write, to purge a word article-wide claiming nonsensially that 'Soviet "occupation" was no better' or comparing the usage of the term applicable to Soviets liberating their own territory from the Genicidial invader with, what you dare calling "German liberation of Kiev from Bolshevism". With such clever arguments you and your friend here should step aside and let others who really care write articles without being disrupted by such nonsense. --<a href="../../../i/r/p/User%7EIrpen_a72e.html" title="User:Irpen">Irpen</a> 02:09, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

You might want to check the article on <a href="../../../c/o/m/Compromise.html" title="Compromise">compromise</a> to check what the term means. You might also want to check what other people proposed here before you repeat the <i>occupation</i> argument: nobody is proposing it. What we propose is some solution acceptable to <b>both sides</b>. <b>BOTH SIDES</b>. And perhaps you might want to read my own arguments posted here to check what is my proposal. Just a hint: no, I'm not proposing to change it to occupation either. I simply pointed out that that would be as extremist option as the one you currently defend.

<p>All right, it seems this talk page would lead us nowhere. There are some people who find the <i>liberation</i> scheme POV and would like to change it and others who want the <i>liberation</i> to be kept at all cost. As apparently there is no compromise possible (as evidenced above), it's high time we tried some next step in the dispute resolution process. Any ideas what should be the best step?

<dd>Now you confused me. You suggested that a tally might do as a way to resolve this mess, as you put it. At least that's how I read your previous post. I pointed out to you that the tally was already held. Nothing can prevent you from writing up the arbitration if you dislike the tally results and, also, disagree with the mainstream and consider Soviet stance in 43-45 comparable to Nazi stance in '41. While at it, you may want to try to propose the NOR policy modification so that we are allowed to give more credence to the fringe theories at the cost of the exclusion of the mainstream ones.

<p><i>Because it's a skillful political game of theirs.</i> Of historians in those countries ? They are part of some conspiracy ? <i>the new government usually loads the responsability for all the previous failures on their "foes"</i> I don't recall that historians have formed government in Poland after 1989. I don't know about other countries. Last time I saw research wasn't controlled by the Party after 1989. Do you have any serious sources claiming that historians controll Polish government and falsify history as part of their fight against unspecified "foes" you mentioned ? For example that deportations to Siberia, Kazakhstan, mass murder of hundreds of thousands of Poles by Soviets, exploitation of Poland by SU, NKVD manhunts, torture in prisons never happened and is all a plot by some "government" of historians ? I am sorry but your explanation doesn't sound serious to me. --<a href="../../../m/o/l/User%7EMolobo_4aaf.html" title="User:Molobo">Molobo</a> 00:08, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Because I get tired of this. If you read the archive page, I tried to debate with AndriyK, we tried to debate, to convince him and so on but he just would not listen, which is not at all surprising given his past contribs that earned him a ban in the process. Then, Molobo (and you, to a lesser extent) gets into the middle of it and try to play white knight. Not only you get a share of it while you should not, but you prevent other, less radical people (like heqs, tufkaa or PatrickFisher) to find a suitable solution.</dd>
<dd>For instance, we were talking about mixing up "liberate", "take" and so on in order to create a mix of terms, as to not create any POV impression. But even that was not enough for them.
