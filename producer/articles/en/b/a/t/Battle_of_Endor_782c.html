<p>The prelude to this battle came when the Alliance learned that Empire was constructing a second <a href="../../../d/e/a/Death_Star_82ed.html" title="Death Star">Death Star</a> space station (under supervision by <a href="../../../m/o/f/Moff_Jerjerrod_7a63.html" title="Moff Jerjerrod">Moff Jerjerrod</a>). The Alliance leadership soon discovered that this version had corrected the design flaws in the original Death Star, that the Alliance had exploited in the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Yavin_6f1b.html" title="Battle of Yavin">Battle of Yavin</a>. It was decided that the station would have to be destroyed before it became operational.</p>
<p>With the loss of life of many <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Star_Wars_races_%28A-E%29_a4e0.html#Bothan" title="List of Star Wars races (A-E)">Bothan</a> spies, the space station was found to be orbiting the forest moon of <a href="../../../e/n/d/Endor_%28Star_Wars%29_5451.html" title="Endor (Star Wars)">Endor</a>. In addition, they learned that, although the station was protected by a powerful deflector shield projected from a base on the moon, the station's weapons were 'not yet ready for service'. Furthermore, they also learned that the <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palpatine.html" title="Palpatine">Emperor</a> himself would personally oversee the final completion of the station. Destroying the station while <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palpatine.html" title="Palpatine">Palpatine</a> was still aboard would deliver a massive crushing blow to the Empire.</p>
<p>With a golden opportunity too good to miss, the Alliance planned a two pronged attack. A commando squad, led by appointed General <a href="../../../h/a/n/Han_Solo_1c62.html" title="Han Solo">Han Solo</a>, would land on the moon in a stolen Imperial Shuttle and disable the Imperial base's deflector shield projector. This would allow a Rebel fleet to attack the station and destroy it. Meanwhile, the Rebel Fleet massed near the planet of <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Star_Wars_planets_%28R-S%29_8bca.html#Sullust" title="List of Star Wars planets (R-S)">Sullust</a>. Palpatine devised a strategy to maintain a large taskforce close to Endor to provide security and support for the Death Star II, since a large portion of the Imperial Fleet was spread out across the galaxy trying to find and engage the Rebels. This was later shown in the battle, as the rebels where caught in a trap while attempting to attack the station.</p>
<p>Unbeknownst to them, the Rebels were falling into a grand trap devised by the <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palpatine.html" title="Palpatine">Emperor</a> himself. In an attempt to effectively eliminate the Rebel Fleet, Palpatine planned on drawing it and its command personnel to Endor using simple <a href="../../../d/i/s/Disinformation.html" title="Disinformation">disinformation</a>: he hid the fact that the station's primary systems were already operational (and had dispatched Darth Vader earlier on to ensure that the systems were ready on time). With a large naval force hidden on the far side of the moon and an elite legion, possibly some troops of <a href="../../../5/0/1/501st_Legion_%28Star_Wars%29_7962.html" title="501st Legion (Star Wars)">501st</a>; Imperial troops standing by on the moon's surface, he was ready to crush the Rebels once and for all.</p>

<p>The Rebels took the bait and the trap was sprung with the commandos captured at the moon's base and the Rebel fleet trapped by the <a href="../../../i/m/p/Imperial_Navy_95c2.html" title="Imperial Navy">Imperial Navy</a>, which was ordered to hold position and prevent the Rebels from escaping. To make things worse, the Death Star's superlaser was already fully operational and was re-designed to be an anti-ship weapon, destroying Rebel cruisers at will. General <a href="../../../l/a/n/Lando_Calrissian_ee89.html" title="Lando Calrissian">Lando Calrissian</a> and <a href="../../../a/d/m/Admiral_Ackbar_0d5f.html" title="Admiral Ackbar">Admiral Ackbar</a> closed with the imperial fleet to buy time, but the situation was dire all the same. The Rebellion's frightening discovery that the station had the capacity to fire its main weapon system far more often and more accurately than ever before put them on the back foot, and it was all but inevitable that the Death Star would annihilate the entire fleet if given the time. The only alternative for the Alliance was to directly engage the fleet of Imperial Star Destroyers in close-quarters. This point-blank range tactic surprisingly proved to be less costly than anticipated, with Mon Calamari Cruisers turning out to be a good match for the Star Destroyers. By engaging the Imperial Fleet in this manner, the Rebels now had an opportunity to fight and cause damage while remaining more or less shielded by the proximity of both fleets, disallowing the Death Star to fire for fear of destroying Imperial vessels. Despite the numerical advantage of the Imperial Fleet, the Rebels were able to cause considerable damage as both fleets merged and engaged. The Imperial tactic of swarming the enemy starfighters with cheap, unshielded <a href="../../../t/i/e/TIE_Fighter_13f3.html" title="TIE Fighter">TIE Fighter</a>'s proved ineffective; Rebel starfighters were shielded and their pilots more trained and seasoned than the doctrine-bound, un-adaptive Imperial pilots who were trained and used to fighting in strict battle lines- a condition that disappeared with this tactical move.</p>
<p>Unknown to the Emperor, however, the Rebel commandos had made an alliance with the indigenous <a href="../../../e/w/o/Ewok.html" title="Ewok">Ewok</a> tribe on the moon. Their warriors ambushed the Imperial stormtroopers soon after the Imperials had captured the Rebel <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commando.html" title="Commando">commandos</a>. Although initially surprised by the ambush made by the Ewoks, the Imperials regained the upper hand and squads of <a href="../../../i/m/p/Imperial_stormtrooper.html" title="Imperial stormtrooper">stormtroopers</a> began utilizing cover and anti-guerilla tactics to confuse and destroy the enemy. Despite being "vastly" outnumbered by the natives, the stormtrooper legion forced the Ewoks to retreat deeper into the forest, as Imperial <a href="../../../a/t/-/AT-ST_1b54.html" title="AT-ST">AT-ST</a> scout walkers decimated Ewok holdouts and defenses. However, a squad of Ewoks led by <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chewbacca.html" title="Chewbacca">Chewbacca</a> managed to capture one of these walkers, and the tide of the battle began to turn as Chewbacca used this AT-ST to take out isolated Imperial troops as well as other Imperial walkers. The sight of this, rallied the remaining Ewoks, who had been retreating into the woods, and they doubled their efforts behind the stolen <a href="../../../a/t/-/AT-ST_1b54.html" title="AT-ST">AT-ST</a>. This allowed the Ewoks to spring a number of primitive, though incredibly effective, traps that had been set up by toppling all Imperial walkers. The tactic worked, and together, the traps and the commandeered walker defeated the remaining scout walkers. Initially unable to get inside the bunker to destroy the shield generator, as a result of a lockdown to prevent entry, Han Solo posed as an AT-ST pilot, informing the Imperials staff within the bunker, that the battle was almost over and the rebels were in full retreat. The main door was opened and three <a href="../../../s/q/u/Squad.html" title="Squad">squads</a> of reinforcements were sent to help search for the rebels. The Rebels, however, were waiting, and the Imperial reinforcements, sorely outnumbered and under the guns of an <a href="../../../a/t/-/AT-ST_1b54.html" title="AT-ST">AT-ST</a>, surrendered to the Rebel/Ewok force and were taken prisoner. With the main door now opened due to Solo's trickery, the Rebels proceeded to infiltrate the Imperial facility and destroy the bunker with many Proton charges. The destruction of the facility brought down the Death Star's <a href="../../../d/e/f/Deflector_shield.html" title="Deflector shield">deflector shield</a>.</p>
<p>Taking advantage of the situation, 6 Rebel fighters engaged the Death Star. 2 <a href="../../../x/-/w/X-wing.html" title="X-wing">X-wings</a>, 2 <a href="../../../a/-/w/A-wing.html" title="A-wing">A-wings</a>, 1 <a href="../../../y/-/w/Y-wing.html" title="Y-wing">Y-wing</a> and the <i><a href="../../../m/i/l/Millennium_Falcon_baaa.html" title="Millennium Falcon">Millennium Falcon</a></i> dove into the uncompleted Death Star's superstructure leading to the main reactor. Several TIE fighters and <a href="../../../t/i/e/TIE_interceptor_c67a.html" title="TIE interceptor">TIE interceptors</a> pursued and destroyed a few fighters, 2 A-wings and the Y-wing flew back to the surface of the station to lure the forces away from the Millennium Falcon and <a href="../../../w/e/d/Wedge_Antilles_6f70.html" title="Wedge Antilles">Wedge Antilles</a>' X-wing. In order to dissuade more Imperials from swarming the Rebel fighters within the Death Star's superstructure, Ackbar ordered a concentrated assault on the Imperial flagship, the <i><a href="../../../e/x/e/Executor.html" title="Executor">Executor</a></i>, forcing the Imperial fleet to rally fighters to defend her, having taken considerble damage. With the combined effort of the remaining starfighters, her bridge shield-generators were destroyed. <a href="../../../a/r/v/Arvel_Crynyd_5a03.html#Crynyd.2C_Arvel" title="Arvel Crynyd">Green Leader</a>, after taking critical damage, <a href="../../../k/a/m/Kamikaze.html" title="Kamikaze">rammed</a> his fighter into the unshielded bridge and killed much of the command staff (including Admiral Piett). The ship's engines misfired as a result of the destruction of the computers in the command center, and the careening vessel was pulled in by the Death Star's gravity and collided into the Death Star's surface before the ship's crew could re-establish helm control in the auxiliary bridge, destroying the <i>Executor</i> and all her crew as well as causing some damage to the Death Star's surface. Meanwhile, Moff Jerjerrod had orders from the Emperor to destroy the forest moon should the Rebels manage to deactivate the shield. As the <a href="../../../d/e/a/Death_Star_82ed.html" title="Death Star">Death Star</a> began to orbiting its primary weapon towards its target, the Rebel fighters sped towards the main reactor. Jerjerrod responded by flooding the area with interference to hinder the Rebels' progress, and issued an evacuation order to non-essential crew, troops, command personnel and civilian contractors working in the construction aboard the station.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Emperor, who was attempting to turn the young would be <a href="../../../j/e/d/Jedi_Knight_c04f.html" title="Jedi Knight">Jedi Knight</a>, <a href="../../../l/u/k/Luke_Skywalker_d1fc.html" title="Luke Skywalker">Luke Skywalker</a>, with the Dark Side of the Force, was killed by <a href="../../../d/a/r/Darth_Vader_35c8.html" title="Darth Vader">Darth Vader</a> when he turned against the Emperor in order to save his son from Palpatine's Force-lightning barrage. Unfortunately, that final act was one of self-sacrifice as well as fulfilling the prophecy of the <a href="../../../c/h/o/Chosen_One_579c.html" title="Chosen One">Chosen One</a>, as Vader, reborn again as Anakin Skywalker, free from the Dark Side that had consumed him throughout the <a href="../../../g/a/l/Galactic_Civil_War_0a23.html" title="Galactic Civil War">Galactic Civil War</a>, died in the arms of his son before he could board his shuttle. All the while <a href="../../../l/a/n/Lando_Calrissian_ee89.html" title="Lando Calrissian">Lando Calrissian</a> and <a href="../../../w/e/d/Wedge_Antilles_6f70.html" title="Wedge Antilles">Wedge Antilles</a> were approaching the main reactor. Using <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Star_Wars_ship-mounted_weapons_7588.html#Concussion_missiles" title="List of Star Wars ship-mounted weapons">Concussion missiles</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Star_Wars_ship-mounted_weapons_7588.html#Proton_torpedoes" title="List of Star Wars ship-mounted weapons">proton torpedoes</a>, they detonated the Death Star's power regulator, and the main reactor itself, causing a massive explosion which led to a <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chain_reaction.html" title="Chain reaction">chain reaction</a> that destroyed the station. Luke was able to escape in Vader's shuttle just before the explosion. Gold Leader narrowly made it out of the superstructure as the fireball ripped through the exploding space station. Demoralized by the loss of the <i>Executor</i>, the Emperor and the Death Star, the majority of the Imperial Fleet retreated deeper into Imperial space, believing that the Rebels could not take the war deeper into the <a href="../../../c/o/r/Coruscant.html" title="Coruscant">Imperial capital</a> itself. After the battle's conclusion, the Rebels command staff celebrated on the forest moon of Endor in Bright Tree Village.</p>

<p>Imperial forces at Endor consisted of an augmented Sector Group containing at least thirty-four <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Destroyer_09b7.html#Imperial_Star_Destroyer" title="Star Destroyer"><i>Imperator</i>-class Star Destroyers</a>, at least one <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Destroyer_09b7.html#Tector-class" title="Star Destroyer"><i>Tector</i>-class Star Destroyer</a>, one <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Destroyer_09b7.html" title="Star Destroyer"><i>Executor</i>-class Star Dreadnought</a> and one communications cruiser. There was extensive fighter support from the Imperial fleet and possibly from the Death Star II itself. This fighter support consisted of several Imperial TIE Fighter Wings, a majority consisting of TIE Interceptors, scattered in small squads. There were also many pilots aboard the Death Star who served as reserve units should the battle turn against the Empire.</p>
<p>The main Alliance capital ships were <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Star_Wars_races_%28K-O%29_e9f9.html#Mon_Calamari" title="List of Star Wars races (K-O)">Mon Calamari</a> warships. The large <a href="../../../h/o/m/Home_One_e0af.html" title="Home One">Home One</a> was Admiral Ackbar's personal flagship. Other star cruisers included the <i>Liberty,</i> <i>Defiance</i>, plus many more Mon Calamari warships. Numerous frigates, escort carriers, corvettes, <a href="../../../a/u/x/Auxiliary_cruiser.html" title="Auxiliary cruiser">armed merchant cruisers</a> and <a href="../../../f/i/r/Fireship.html" title="Fireship">fireships</a> were also in the Rebel fleet. The advance Rebel fighter forces were split into 5 ad-hoc fighter wings (Red Squadron, Green Squadron, Blue Squadron, Grey Squadron and Gold Squadron), these fighters were to lead the assault on the Death Star's Main Reactor and others engaged the Executor. Despite the now widespread introduction of the advanced A-wing, B-wing and X-wing fighters, the Y-wing was still the primary workhorse of the battle.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Endor_782c.html" title="Edit section: Expanded Universe">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Expanded Universe</span></h2>
<p>More details of the battle were revealed in <a href="../../../e/x/p/Expanded_Universe_%28Star_Wars%29_acd4.html" title="Expanded Universe (Star Wars)">Expanded Universe</a> literature. It was revealed that <a href="../../../o/s/v/Osvald_Teshik_a5b2.html" title="Osvald Teshik">Grand Admiral Teshik</a> had escaped the destruction of the Death Star. After the destruction of HIMS <i><a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Destroyer_09b7.html" title="Star Destroyer">Executor</a></i>, command should have properly passed from Admiral Piett to him. <a href="../../../g/i/l/Gilad_Pellaeon_f275.html" title="Gilad Pellaeon">Gilad Pellaeon</a>, senior surviving officer of HIMS <i>Chimaera</i> inexplicably ordered an illegal retreat from Endor. This action is most curious: despite the loss of HIMS <i>Executor</i>, the numerical and qualitative properties of the Star Destroyers should have permitted the Imperial fleet to maintain their presence and possibly even turn the battle against their Rebel foes. It is possible that the Imperial's had lost more ships by the time Pellaeon ordered the reteat. It is even more curious that the retreat order was widely followed. The battle was won by the Rebellion. <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grand_Admiral_Thrawn_d066.html" title="Grand Admiral Thrawn">Grand Admiral Thrawn</a> later theorized that with the death of Emperor Palpatine, the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_Meditation_f53e.html" title="Battle Meditation">battle meditation</a> he exercised on his troops through the Force was removed and the Imperial Navy's fighting ability was dramatically reduced, allowing the Rebel fleet to scatter them. Thrawn was correct that the Death Star's destruction and the withdrawal of battle meditation had a dramatic effect on the Imperial Fleet's effectiveness, though he was mistaken as to the meditator's identity- battle meditation is a rare talent, which Palpatine did not possess, but <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grand_Admiral_%28Star_Wars%29_4663.html" title="Grand Admiral (Star Wars)">Grand Admiral</a> <a href="../../../n/i/a/Nial_Declann_bd59.html" title="Nial Declann">Nial Declann</a> did. Declann's concentration was broken when he sensed the Emperor's death. He went to the Throne room and searched the room completely, the emperor was killed in the reactor shaft moments before. Grand Admiral Declann died shortly thereafter when the Death Star was destroyed.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="../../../n/o/v/Novelization.html" title="Novelization">novelization</a> of <i>Return of the Jedi</i>, Moff Jerjerrod was preparing to destroy the moon of Endor when the fighters reached the reactor. This is possible as, in the movie, the superlaser flashes before the station explodes (indicating a malfunction) and the Death Star appeared to have been re-positioned toward the planet.</p>
<p>Teshik did not retreat with the rest of the Imperial squadron and fought on for several more hours until his flagship, HIMS <i>Eleemosynary</i>, was captured. He was later tried and executed by the Rebel Alliance for reasons unknown (but guessable).</p>
<p>Had the Rebels failed at destroying the station, the results would have been far worse than they thought. In the years beforehand, the assassin droid <a href="../../../i/g/-/IG-88_da8e.html" title="IG-88">IG-88</a> was preparing to launch a droid revolution. The last surviving model, IG-88A, built a duplicate of the Death Star's computer core and switched his fake one for the real system, downloading his consciousness as well. When the Imperials installed the core, IG-88A literally became the Death Star, with complete access and control to all systems. None of the Imperial personnel knew, although Palpatine suspected his presence when a series of doors in his throne room opened and closed wildly. When the Rebels arrived, IG-88A fired the superlaser at the Rebel fleet, letting the Imperials believe they were in control, while he prepared to transmit his master control signal that would cause all droids to turn on their master. When the Death Star core collapsed, all power was lost and the destruction of the station wiped out IG-88A.</p>
<p>Rebel losses were quite few, they had lost 3 capital ships to the Death Star and of course several others damaged by the battle with the Star Destroyers. The Imperial fleet however suffered many more losses to fighters and capital ships, possibly because the Imperial tactic is usually to engage in rather strict battle lines. Close-quarters combat as seen during the battle would probably have been an enormous surprise to them. The rebel fighters proved vastly superior in terms of pilot capability as well as the technology in the fighters themselves, primarily shields. The Imperial swarming technique was ineffective and an enormous amount of TIE fighters was destroyed.</p>
<p>The disintegration of the Galactic Empire began shortly after the Battle of Endor as news of the Emperor's death became widespread. As Palpatine deliberately did not plan for succession of rule, numerous Imperial leaders began carving out personal fiefdoms. This decay accelerated approximately six years after Endor during the events surrounding the clone Palpatine and his eventual defeat. Years later, the small (and mostly ignored) <a href="../../../i/m/p/Imperial_Remnant_c146.html" title="Imperial Remnant">Imperial Remnant</a> signed a peace treaty, officially ending the <a href="../../../g/a/l/Galactic_Civil_War_0a23.html" title="Galactic Civil War">Galactic Civil War</a>.</p>
<p>As for the Alliance to Restore the Republic, they would go on to form the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Republic_%28Star_Wars%29_803b.html" title="New Republic (Star Wars)">New Republic</a>. This government was very weak and unable to run the affairs and bureaucracy as the Republic did for thousands of years and the Empire during his reign. It collapsed quickly (possibly in a month) because it traded freedom for order and its control over the galaxy was minimal. Eventually leaving the galaxy to sustain on a simple ideal instead of having it controlled by bureaucracy. The New Republic was cracked and mostly defeated by the Yuuzhan Vong invasion of the galaxy. It was the Imperial Remnant that played a significant role in saving the New Republic government from total collapse. Though in the end the New Republic proved a steadfast and accepted institution.</p>
