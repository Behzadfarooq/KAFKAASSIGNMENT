<p>Nice continuing work on this. I'm wondering if you and I can't braistorm a list of relevantly important storylines on here first, and then really work through which are MOST important. For example, Knightfall was added for it's significance as it was intended to be the end of bruce wayne and the start of a successor as the bat, but fans hated it, and bruce came back. Cataclysm is good, but recent, and most of it's effects are gone. Let's see what we can come up with? <a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThuranX_db95.html" title="User:ThuranX">ThuranX</a> 17:12, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>As someone who hasn't really read a lot of comic books, I'm not sure I'm fully qualified to help with that.

<p>Actually, I think that letting the rest of Wiki watch and edit will help with that, and you and I can relax and jsut keep it from getting ridiculously weighty with added links. <a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThuranX_db95.html" title="User:ThuranX">ThuranX</a> 16:17, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Given the recent repairs to the size of the template, I'm wondering if the 'storylines' section is too likely to become cumbersome rapidly. I think a decision should be made as to whether 'impact to the canon' is the primary marker for inclusion, or significance of the story both in and out of the comics should matter more. I ask this because while dark Knight Returns is one of the greatest batman stories ever, by critical review ANd sales figures, not just my opinion, it's also not 'canon'. What should be the requirement, or is this category SO likely to be a trainwreck that it shoudl be considered for removal, or some bigger revamping?<a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThuranX_db95.html" title="User:ThuranX">ThuranX</a> 16:42, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>For being so large, this template certainly has a lot of wasted space under the "films" heading. Guermantes 17:06, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Indeed. If it gets worse we might have to go back to the film setup of the first Batman template, which listed the films by group rather than actor. I don't think it's quite come to that, however, although now that Scarecrow is on there it looks a bit big.--<a href="../../../l/e/n/User%7ELenin_%26_McCarthy_7656.html" title="User:Lenin &amp; McCarthy">Lenin &amp; McCarthy</a> 21:11, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hrmmmm. What if we combined the serials, and separated them by actor? I'll set it up that way. <a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThuranX_db95.html" title="User:ThuranX">ThuranX</a> 02:28, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Although this is a large template, I think most of the editors trying to improve it would appreciate guerilla ambushes that remove most of the work NOT being perofmred on this template. Taking away all the categories devised for just 'films, and leaving a mess there is NOT a viable solution.<a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThuranX_db95.html" title="User:ThuranX">ThuranX</a> 15:29, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I suggest the films be shortened to one section, with no breakdown by actor/director/other, and please remove the footnotes as "continuity" can be confusing to those less knowledgeable about the subject. As it currently exists this box is extremely unweildy and is attached to a great many articles that are already quite lengthy. -<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkeer_0d07.html" title="User:Markeer">Markeer</a> 15:53, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This box is no larger than superman's template. IT contains as much information as Superman's template. I see no valid reason to shove a useless jumble of links into a box. it defeats the value of a template in mapping out relevant info related to a larger topic. Your 'edits' are pretty close to blanking vandalism. Further, holding a private 'discussion for consensus' on a third party page, then coming here and telling us 'I've got consensus over on this other unrelated page, that we didn't invite you to, so I can do this' is a fallacy. I will only recognize consensus built here, and thats' REASONED consensus, not you pulling half of WP:Comic over here with pointless 'i support' notes. It seems yu want to create a fight here. I'm not interested in it, I'm not going to get into it, I'm just going to continue to IMPROVE this template, and protect it from obvious vandalism. <a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThuranX_db95.html" title="User:ThuranX">ThuranX</a> 16:01, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Regardless, as I state above, my opinion is this template box is currently unweildy, just as I would say the {{<a href="../../../s/u/p/Template%7ESuperman_6db1.html" title="Template:Superman">Superman</a>}} is. A great many articles of large size have these useful boxes, so I would say it is reasonable to keep them as compact and simple as possible to avoid unnecessary article clutter. -<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkeer_0d07.html" title="User:Markeer">Markeer</a> 16:09, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This box is way to big. I just looked at AMIB's version, and it looked good and was had all the relevant information. The template needs to link all the relevant information, if the user wants to know who played what, then they can link off that particular film link. But if everyone is insistent on having the actors, then they can have a line like the films do. I think the boxes are important, but that they should not be so obtrusive. --<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilver_lode_88bd.html" title="User:Silver lode">Silver lode</a> 16:16, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I've shrunk it a lot; I condensed all the theatrical films, from the serials to Dark Knight, into one line. There's no need for excessive metadata in this template, especially when it was leading to the layout nightmares that the previous version had. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 16:51, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I've also removed all of the "continuity" notes. This isn't the place to be fitting these works into fictional universes; instead, it's the place to fit them into our universe, preferably in the most compact, efficient navbox possible.

<dd>I'm sorry, but again I think we're getting to the 'jumble of links' level here. I see nothing wrong with noting which continiuties exist. That's not fitting it into comic universes, that's explaining which films comprise which series. Should someone want to know which movies are part of which series now, they can't tell from the template. They could before, with your previous edit about burton/schumaker. That edit removed a number of lines from the template,reducing it in size, as per many editors concerns, while still converying more information about assiciation of films, timelines, etc., than the larger Superman Template. As I said below, I think that was a good edit. I think mashing all the links together, as you're now doing, is NOT productive, NOT informative, and frankly, it's also ugly. Finally, it certainly seems like your intent is to do a series of small edits to get the page right back to what markeer had earlier done, which, by your own words, was detrimental to the page.<a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThuranX_db95.html" title="User:ThuranX">ThuranX</a> 17:01, 6 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>This isn't the place for metadata. We don't need to note the different continuities in <i>every single Batman article</i>, and the Superman template is a poor example because it is also very huge, includes too much metadata, and has far too much whitespace. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 17:14, 6 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>then go fix that template. It's been up for a LOOOONG time. WP:CNC had plenty of time to 'fix' that Template. Instead, you're here, complaining that I based this off that, and insulting all the owrk everyone before you has done. As for 'metadata' it'd be really horrible if WIki had facts. We're not getting ridiculously obsessive on the metadata, and instead, you're wroking to reduce the level of info to less than usefully minimal. You've basically got the tempalte to the point where your next move will be to classify it as 'motion picture' and combine all the films and animation. at which point, we'll be right back to markeer's vandal-like edit. And I'll revert right back to what it was yesterday, because at that point, all these edits, except the burton schumaker ones, will be detrimental to the page. <a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThuranX_db95.html" title="User:ThuranX">ThuranX</a> 17:21, 6 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I think live-action and animation is a good split. There's basically no overlap between the two, and when you list them chronologically you also happen to group them by style/continuity (the serials, West/Ward, Burton/Schumacher, modern movies; TAS/New leads into Beyond, then TBM). In fact, other than possibly format fiddling (wording and such), I'm done doing major edits to the film/TV section of this navbox. Right now, I'm double-checking that no major supporting characters, villains, storylines, or comics are omitted, while removing any clearly out-of-place ones. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 17:32, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There had been a significant amount of chatter about it's efficacy at the superman template, but since it's a bit mroe clear-cut for the batman, I agreed with L&amp;M's additions in that regard.

Should this template include them? I can see arguments for and against: on the one hand, these were widely viewed television series which featured Batman prominently; on the other hand, we probably <i>don't</i> want to include every comic series in which Batman has featured prominently, and it might be odd to be selective about the comics and inclusive about television.

<p>Two editors from the WP:COMICS have come here with the intent of blanking major quantities of content. I will continue to revert their edits and ignore their 'messages' to me that they are working in good faith based on a consensus they arrived at on another tlak page, not that of Template:The Batman. they call me uncivil and rude and so on, but they cna't be bothered to discuss their 'good faith edits', instead continuing to vandalize the page. I have reached by 3 reverts though, and have no doubt these two will report it immediately, so I'm hoping that other editors interested in actually IMPROVING the page will help me protect the page.<a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThuranX_db95.html" title="User:ThuranX">ThuranX</a> 16:06, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The vertical arrangement of the films section is causing a great deal of whitespace in this template, making it excessively large and obtrusive. Additionally, I'm not exactly sure why this template has meta-data on what films fit into what continuity, which is information of limited interest being crammed into an already overlarge template.</p>
<p>The current version has all of the films in a lump, which is less than ideal; can someone think of a way they could be broken up into three to five lines? I was thinking of combining the television section into the films section, then breaking it up into...</p>

<li>Animated</li>
<li>Modern movies</li>

<dd>good faith requires discussion here, not at another talk page. You and Markeer came here making edits based on a consensus claimed from another page. No editor here knew there was a discussion of this template going on there, but you and Markeer walked in, shouted 'CONSENSUS' and removed the work of multiple GOOD FAITH editors here. You're both rude and childish, and obviously only worked in the method you did because you knew that editors here would not have wanted all the information they've been working on to be removed. In fact, the editors here were already addressing the size problems, and discussing it here. It HAD been my intent this morning to create a 'Burton/Schumaker' Continuity listing, and then a Nolan Continuity, eliminating about 5 lines of the template, but instead I'm wasting time protecting the page from VANDALS all morning. had you taken the tiem to truly model GOOD FAITH and ask here what's beign done, or read this talk page, you'd see that this was a known issue. Instead, now, both of us are losing time. I'm going to REREVERT THE PAGE to the PROPER format, put in my edits, and go mow the lawn. If I see the page has suffered subsequent vandalisms, I'll revert them. <a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThuranX_db95.html" title="User:ThuranX">ThuranX</a> 16:20, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You reverted Markeer's good-faith edits not as detrimental to the template (which I probably wouldn't have paid a second thought to) but as vandalism, which they clearly were not. I reverted your edit as a misunderstanding and pointed you to proof of Markeer's good faith, nothing more. When you reverted that as vandalism, I started writing a talk explanation of the changes, but you reverted before I could even finish that talk page comment.</p>
<p>In the future, I suggest you be more careful about what you call vandalism, be considerably less confrontational, and not jump to revert war when someone is <a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBOLD_e2a0.html" title="WP:BOLD">bold</a> in editing an article. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 16:30, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There's Being Bold, and there's Being a vandal. Had YOU come in here, and jsut done the Burton/Schumaker films line, that'd be 'bold'. removing all the categories and leaving an unnavigable mess of links is vandalism. he didn't ask, and when confronted, he DID cite a conversation on ANOTHER talk page. While it may not be 'vandalism' in the tradition leaving dickjokes on a page' style that we see most of on Wikipedia, removing large quantities of information with NO explanation is vandalism. And once there WAS talk here, Man in Bl?ck figured out the same change that I had planned to make this morning, had I not had to fix the page and defend my decision to revert vandalism. As for being confrtonational, on Wikipedia, it's the best way to keep vandals away. Those who REALLY think there's merit stick around and reply, as MiB? did. Markeer left. MiB saw a problem and stuck around. As far as I'm concerned, my level of 'confrontationalism' was just about right. had Markeer asked on here, or said "I prefer minialist lsitings in templates, so I've edited to reflect that' that might've been a conversation starter. Instead, he effectively said 'i fixed the page' and then ran off. That's vandalism, especially since removing big chunks of info IS vandalism. read up on wiki's policy and the associated talks all over the place. I understand why MiB REREVERTED, and I do apologize, that wasn't vandalism, as it appears I cut off his explanations with my edits. I stand by my original assestment of Markeer, however. And I am glad to have more editors who WANT to improve this page. The next section that really needs work is the 'Storylines' listing, whic hcan be discussed above.<a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThuranX_db95.html" title="User:ThuranX">ThuranX</a> 16:39, 6 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Edits made with a genuine intention to improve the encyclopedia are never, ever vandalism. (Oftentimes large chunks of info are removed because they're redundant or inappropriate to Wikipedia.)

<dd>Thank you AMiB but I was not driven away by ThuranX's comments or tone. I simply took a step back to allow some discussion to take place to avoid further heated exchanges. I like the change to the films section (as of current) and I'm presently going back and forth trying to decide if the template could be reduced further by merging the "Comics" and "Comics storylines" sections. Technically all of the storylines have been published separately as TPBs so they are all 'comic titles' in one way or another -<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkeer_0d07.html" title="User:Markeer">Markeer</a> 17:31, 6 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I disagree strongly on this one. There's a big difference between a storyline and an ongoing series. A storyline is a unit of story; largely, when you talk about it, you're going to talk about the plot and criticism of that plot. An ongoing series is more of a merchandising thing, where you're going to be talking about the publishing history and taking a perspective further away from the story being told. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 17:41, 6 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Fair enough. My concern was for brevity on the box of course, and I've basically decided not to make that change largely because the title links for both are too valuable to lose from a "further links" box (categories for Batman titles and stories respectively). The current box choices in those sections seem to be "Batman titles currently being published" and "storylines with the largest long term effect" (which is more than reasonable). Honestly, the last place I can see to condense would be to move the two cancelled films to "Live Action" with (cancelled) in parenthesis as per the (in development) "The Dark Knight" (a savings of 2-3 lines counting whitespace). -<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkeer_0d07.html" title="User:Markeer">Markeer</a> 17:56, 6 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Well, I was waffling about removing the cancelled films altogether, actually; that's why I didn't condense them.
<dl>
<dd>I'd say remove the cancelled films and use the extra space to add most of your influential creators list from below to the "People" section.

<dd>How does the current version look? Instead of ongoing series, it's pretty much any series starring Batman (not counting series Wikipedia doesn't have a separate article for) that ran for 24 or more issues. I'm really iffy about only including ongoing series; that would exclude World's Finest, which has run for more years than Sup/Bat has issues. 24 issues is a number pulled out of my butt, but it handily excludes short-lived side comics and animated series adaptations (as well as every mini-series ever), while offering an impartial yardstick for including the important series. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 18:31, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Okay, I soaked as much whitespace out of it as I could without losing links (with one exception). Numbered for ease of discussion...</p>
<ol>
<li>I added Batwoman, and waffled on Ace the Bat-Hound and Bat-Mite. I still think we're a little thin on supporting characters; <s>how do people feel about Oracle, Azrael, Spoiler, or individual listings for the Robins?</s> Markeer makes a good point about reducing the characters.</li>
<li>I added Killer Croc and Clayface (and Solomon Grundy, as he's a Gotham villain, but good call on the removal there; he really is more of a GL villain). How should we arrange the villains? Are there too many, or are we missing any? I'm kind of iffy on Bane; he's more like Hush or Prometheus or the Reaper or Carmine Falcone in that he has one really big story, then he's sort of relegated to the background.</li>
<li>I condensed the places and miscellanea and added the Bat-Signal. Places is never going to be any longer, and Miscellanea just fit, filling in that whitespace. Does someone have a better name?</li>
<li>I added a ton of influential people to the list. Besides the creators, I added all of the really influential writers and artists on Batman (not all the famous ones, just the ones who formed Batman). Does Jeph Loeb belong on this list? While Jim Lee has pretty much defined the look of Batman in the comics of the last three or so years, Loeb has just written a lot of really good stories. I'm not sure his work is definitive, or that we can really tell if it's definitive yet. In fact, does Jim Lee belong? Ah, indecision.</li>
<li>I condensed the movie and animation sections; this is discussed above.</li>
<li>I added Death in the Family and Killing Joke. I waffled on DK2, and I really don't think we need all of the Sale/Loeb Year One followups (Long Halloween, for example), as they're critically acclaimed, but not yet particularly influential.</li>
<li>I just ditched the video games. Only one Batman game ever has been a critical success, and none of them have ever been a sales success. Additionally, all of the games that were there were adaptations of movies.</li>
<li>We don't have a section on influential people outside of the comics. I don't know what to name it, but I'd say <a href="../../../a/d/a/Adam_West_4c2d.html" title="Adam West">Adam West</a>, <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Dini_42d8.html" title="Paul Dini">Paul Dini</a>, <a href="../../../b/r/u/Bruce_Timm_3189.html" title="Bruce Timm">Bruce Timm</a>, whoever voiced Batman in the animated series, <a href="../../../t/i/m/Tim_Burton_a41c.html" title="Tim Burton">Tim Burton</a>, <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joel_Schumacher_bb0d.html" title="Joel Schumacher">Joel Schumacher</a>, and <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christopher_Nolan_5b68.html" title="Christopher Nolan">Christopher Nolan</a> would belong on it at least. Definitely major directors and people who have become typecast as Batman, but not the one-off actors who played Batman in various movies.</li>
<li>I waffled on what to do with the cancelled movies. Why are they in this template at all?</li>

<dd>While I certainly see an argument for NPOV (it's too large a subject for there not to be some judgement calls), I have to say that there's almost no point to an infobox like this without most of those characters and villains. If you'd like to avoid POV, I'd say remove characters that have not appeared in any motion picture of the last 20 years, as there's a clear argument for notability for any who have been used both in comics AND in the largest audience movies. Looking at the list this would only mean removing (chars) Batwoman, Outsiders, (vills) Killer Croc and Clayface. I think that would satisfy NPOV while also providing a large number of links for those seeking more information.</dd>

<dd>Option 1a would be replace Batwoman and Outsiders with <a href="../../../b/a/t/Batman_supporting_characters.html" title="Batman supporting characters">Other characters</a> and Croc/Clayface with <a href="../../../b/a/t/Batman_villains.html" title="Batman villains">Other villains</a>.

<dd>I'm not acting erratically. I started out wanting to DISCUSS edits to this page that you and Markeer decided needed to be made. Instead of dicussing, I was pointed to talk on a third party page, as I've stated before. Even after that, I tried to talk about this page. Instead, I was repeatedly ignored. So I decided that the best way to continue to help on this page was to do what you and Markeer had modelled as the better wiki-editor behavior. So I have acted boldly, implementing ideas on the talk page by Basique. You used to be upset that I kept trying to talk about this page, now you're upset that I've stopped tlaking and, like you, started DOING. it seems you're NOW only going to be happy if I cede all interest in a page I started to someone who came in, told me I did everything wrong, and totally redid the page without any discussion with previous GOOD FAITH editors. That's not erratic, but I am confused. From 'Hi, we decided without letting you know that we're going to fix a page you've been working on for weeks' to 'get out of our way' to 'just go away and let us play', your attitude has grown consistently more and more hostile. If anyone is being erratic, it's you. I see you've goen to the adminstrators, and I plan to address your rude behavior in desiregarding all the work done be previous editors, your ignorance of the talk page discussions, and your hate filled 'go away' attitude.<a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThuranX_db95.html" title="User:ThuranX">ThuranX</a> 20:28, 6 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm not particularly upset. I'm worried that we're going to end up with two or three templates that will end up bloating, but since you just deleted half the template and didn't actually do anything with it, I don't think that's happening any time soon. Instead, I'm worried that you've lost objectivity, and are reacting to a percieved "invasion" into "your" template. I've tried to engage you further up the page about merging all the stubby film/TV lines, as well as explained my reasoning for all of the edits and invited discussion, change, or reversion. Other editors have tried to engage you as well. Instead of engaging those editors, you've affected with a martyred "Well, I see I'm not wanted here" attitude, then made a drastic change in attitude with a destructive reduction of the template (as well as a destructive reduction of {{<a href="../../../s/u/p/Template%7ESuperman_6db1.html" title="Template:Superman">Superman</a>}}) accompanied with sarcastic edit summaries. For all of this, I'm not really interested in persecuting you; I just think you've lost the kind of objectivity that goes with "If you don't want your writing to be edited mercilessly, do not submit it." - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 20:44, 6 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Oh, now don't lie. You haven't shown any of the previous editors of this template ANY respect. You came in, told us it had already been decided that our work was lousy, and that YOU would fix it. Now you're realizing you were a jerk, and instead of apologizing, you're going to escalate things. That's ok, that's BEING BOLD. I like that about you. Right or wrong, you just keep on BEING BOLD! I respect that about you! I've decided it's the RIGHT way to be. My former behavior, where I tried talking to you, and supporting your early edits, well, that was stupid of me. I should've just cheered on your BEING BOLD attitude, and let you do anythign you wanted. In fact, I'm considering BEING BOLD on a WHOLE lot of pages! I hear there's a conflict on the elephant page about how many elephants are out there, maybe that just needs a BOLD editor to solve it! Seriously though. If you and Makeer had TALKED at first, none of this would've happened. But you didn't. when you were asked to talk, YOU insulted me b telling me it had 'already been discussed' (just not on any page the editors of this template kenw to look at for a discussion of this page, which belongs on THIS talk page). When I replied, you ignored me. No matter HOW I talked to you, Only making edits got you to stop and talk. Now you're upset. I don't back down from bullies, and I'm not going to start. Take it to the administration. Being bold doesn't actually preclude some basic respect, despite your behavior, and that's ALL I've been asking for all day. Instead, it's just been 'you're clueless, you suck at wiki, you can't tell bold editing from article ruining vandalism, and we don't have to esplain being bold, no matter how radical a change we make unexplained!' I'm not interested in being condescended to, and I'm not going to be bullied. Do all you want to the page. I'm sure other editors will 'fix' it their way later anyways.

Reverting edits, editing to make a <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">point</a>, writing snide edit summaries and sarcastic responses, and accusing several editors of vandalism and lying appear make other editors think you have interest in working with them.

I was excluded, by design, from the start of this set of edits. NOt after i started some big fight. These editors, markeer and AMiB had NO intention of working WITH me. They made that clear from the beginning, by attacking me for undoing their 'bold edit', since it sure as hell looks like vandalism to undo all the category work that was there and create a bunched up pile of links. I know you don't agree than turned organized categories into a pile of links could possibly considered vandalism by editors who worked at length on a pge, even if that link-piling goes unaccompanied by any talk page explanation. I know that when I asked for explanations, and was ignored, that doesn't look to you like incivility, and I know that all the times I tried to give my input looks like MY being and 'angry mastodon', while all the times they ignored my comments was 'being bold'. Well, I'm not going to change my mind. AMiB and Markeer were rude, neither's apologized at all, and neither intends to.

Bl♟ck I get your point, but I think the secondary templates coming out of this split may be useful to the TV/Film projects. And if not they will eventually die off and be deleted. Natural selection is very active on Wikipedia. I do think its long past time that rules for these templates and their inclusion were decided on by the Project as a whole. It's way past time these templates were regulated in the same way that the S-Boxes are. If you setup rules stating that only one of each Batman template can be used on a page, then I don't think you'll have a huge problem. --<a href="../../../b/a/s/User%7EBasique_8925.html" title="User:Basique">Basique</a> 21:31, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I don't think this is "MY" page, but I do feel that my work on this page, which included writing it up in notepad offline as i searched wikipedia, and then spending a couple hours putting it together ON wikipedia playing in the previews, means I did enough work on it to validate having a voice in further edits. Not one of you WP:Comics people has done that. AT ALL. You all disregarded the work already in progress, insulted those who did that work, and when I tried to talk to you, you ignored. then you insulted my reverts and edits. Then you mocked them. Finally, You reverted the edits I did which were done with exactly the same behaviors YOU yourselves used, and said my behavior was NOT wikipedia's way. well, if MY behavior wasn't wikipedia's way, then neither was yours. No, I'm not your 'friend' at all, and we both know it. I don't believe for one moment you had Good Faith. I believe that this was a deliberate action by WP:Comics to take charge of a page that they hadn't bothered to create, or eve nthink of. I believe that it solved problems discussed in the previous bat-templates available, and I believe that I modelled it on a GOOD template, the Superman template, which WP:Comics has had ample time to edit and 'fix'. Instead, WP: Comics saw this template, and decided they had to run it. It's selfish abuse of Wikipedia that you're all demonstrating, but since it's currently four to one, I guess I can't really do anything about it right now. I'm hurt that all my work was treated like manure, yes, but I'm more insulted that basic civility was ignored all day, except to throw it in my face on my user page and tell me I had none of it, even though I DID support a number of the changes, and even tried to give truly helpful edits along the way. Instead, what did I get? "grundy IS a Gotham villian, but I guess I'll leave him off". that's throwing a starving dog a rotting bone, not working together like Wikipedia's about. Not one of the people involved in today's little dust up has shown the least respect for ANY of the editors who worked on this page before. The opposite. they flat out insulted us. 'this page is bulky, clumsy, who added this, this is lame, we don't need this, why do this'. My responses were ignored. This is by far the worst experience I've had on wikipedia. I've been part of some significant disagreements before, including some stuff a while back on the Katherine harris page, and others since then. however, all of those editing disagreements were with people who could explain WHY they'd done what they had done. Today, I got none of that. What I got was 'we're BEING BOLD! get out of our way!'<a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThuranX_db95.html" title="User:ThuranX">ThuranX</a> 22:22, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>ThuranX, I accept that you feel that that the other editors of this page have been mistreating you and ganging up on you. For any part I've played in that, I apologize. I was not party to most of the editing this morning, but was distressed at the tone of the comments on this page, and responded accordingly. I do not make any judgment or comment about the other editors' work on the template, except to assume good faith of them — as I do of you, ThuranX. I recognize that by and large you were acting in what you believed to be the best interests of the encyclopedia, except when you became upset and sarcastic. My comments to you were intended to help defuse the situation, and if they have failed I apologize for that as well. If you are still concerned about the way that this morning's edits proceeded, perhaps you could contact an editor or administrator whose judgement you trust to look at the situation with an impartial eye. I, for one, will listen. —<a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJosiah_Rowe_4f72.html" title="User:Josiah Rowe">Josiah Rowe</a> <small>(<a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJosiah_Rowe_ba00.html" title="User talk:Josiah Rowe">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Josiah_Rowe_5f31.html" title="Special:Contributions/Josiah Rowe">contribs</a>)</small> 22:50, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Is the only reason why Ace the Bat-hound is included on the template because he's been featured on a cartoon? It seems kinda ridiculous to include a character who hasn't had an in-continuity appearance or reference since Knightfall. Or are we also going by character notability garnered from other media, such as Batman Beyond and Krypto the Super-Dog, and not just the comics?</dd>

<dd>nah, there's no need for that. I think AMiB jsut needs to accept that he's not the only one who can be bold, and sometimes, when other editors are being bold, it will change things he's worked hard on. He doesn't mind BEING bold, just SEEING bold. he'll learn this is just making him a stronger editor. And while I appreciate the revert, if you'll notice above, Basique and I agreed to shorten the page. I'd appreciate you undoing your revert. After all, isn't Wikipedia about being bold? That's my understanding of what happened here today, and I'm just trying to be a better wiki-editor. I've learned today that being bold is more important than manners, feelings, or respect. So please undo your revert. Otherwise, I'll have to be bold and do it myself. <a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThuranX_db95.html" title="User:ThuranX">ThuranX</a> 20:48, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>see, now im so confused. we are now back to the huge template for a navbox that has all that whitespace and huge amount of info? i believe everyone, including you, decided that smaller was better, at least that is what you chastized me earlier for. I dont want you to think that im ganging up on you or whatever else has been said here at this talk page. Creating this template was a great idea, but it would be even greater if everyone's ideas could be used and incorporated. This template (which I can only see as being used as a navbox...) will be used on quite a few batman related pages, and should not be so big as to overshadow or clog up the main page. I hope the rest of the editing can be done without personal attacks or grudges. --<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilver_lode_88bd.html" title="User:Silver lode">Silver lode</a> 06:44, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't see where the Project holds any particular authority to set policy for wikipedia, esp. on an article created by someone who specifically rejects the project, it's members, their edits, and their behavior having seen how the project acts. Any wikipedian can edit any article. I will continue to edit this article as I see fit, and I believe Lenin &amp; McCarthy probably will too. When the Project feels like STARTING a set of edits with civility, I suspect that I and other editors will be more willing to work with the project, but until then? No. The project does NOT assume good faith, nor do they act in a <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">CIVIL</a> manner. <a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThuranX_db95.html" title="User:ThuranX">ThuranX</a> 13:49, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>To clarify something: a navbox is a template whose function is to serve as an organized and standardized group of links related to a topic. See <a href="../../../n/a/v/Wikipedia%7ENavigational_templates_8f66.html" title="Wikipedia:Navigational templates">Wikipedia:Navigational templates</a>. "Navbox" is just shorthand for "navigational template box". The discussion of this template as a navbox is merely a matter of terminology, not some form of usurpation. —<a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJosiah_Rowe_4f72.html" title="User:Josiah Rowe">Josiah Rowe</a> <small>(<a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJosiah_Rowe_ba00.html" title="User talk:Josiah Rowe">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Josiah_Rowe_5f31.html" title="Special:Contributions/Josiah Rowe">contribs</a>)</small> 19:31, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm going to be clear here, once again. I see people all running to various mediators and administrators. That's your choice. Once again, I'm going to state my case, simple and clear. Markeer commited and edit here which he claims as BOLDness, and which i think was vandalism. He gave no explanation anywhere regarding his actions, and had no prior involvement with the site. my response was to revert vandalism. At this point, things went to hell. A Man in Bl?ck arrived, defended the vandalism as boldness, adn he and markeer began a campaing to turn allthe work previously done to junk. He did NOT respond to the talk page. He ONLY responded to edits, usually by leaving some snarky 'you just don't get what i'm doing cause i'm smart and bold and you're not' messages, and then going on. IN the beginning, I tried to engage him onthe talk page, even supporting and accepting some of his early edits. He gave NO replies, NO repsonses, and really didn't do much with the talk page other than use it as an echo chamber, where he voiced an idea, immediately implemented it, and cited 'see the talk page' as validation, despite not actually participating. as the day fgoes on and the edits and incivility continue, I kept trying to work with him, he kept ignoring me. Finally, having no other recourse left, as he asked more and more of his friends to side with him on the page, I began to edit alongside him, fixing the superman template to match. his friends reverted my workthere, stating that i was vandalizing that template. This created even MORE problems, because if it's good for this template, surely it mustbe good for the other template. If it's not good for that tempalte, it's not good fro THIS template. After all my edits there, A Man in Black went there, reverted all my edits, then implemented all my changes again, but under his name, and declared that superman template was fixed. Nothing short of a full apology from Markeer, A Man in Bl?ck, Silver Lode, Joshua Rowe and ChrisGriswold, all members of WP:Comic who've decided there's strength in numbers, and who self-idenitfy as bullies hoping to win by force of numbers and the bully tactic of running to authority when someone fights back, will suffice in this situation. Their latest tactic is to run to their project page, create a need to standardize all teh templates into Navboxes, and then claim they've got some sort of authority from doing so. <a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThuranX_db95.html" title="User:ThuranX">ThuranX</a> 15:25, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Note: as I told you on your user talk page, I am not and have never been a member of WP:Comics. Before yesterday I had had no interaction with Markeer or A Man in Black. I just happened upon this page because I had <a href="../../../b/a/t/Batman.html" title="Batman">Batman</a> on my watchlist, made a few edits and then noticed what looked like extreme incivility on the talk page. I have never defended the behavior of any of the participants in this fiasco, and have focussed on ThuranX solely because his behavior has been more obviously disruptive. I do not have the inclination to go through the precise chronology of who edited what when, for the purpose of judging Markeer and AMiB, because it is clear that any conclusion I reach would be rejected out of hand by ThuranX. I made a good-faith effort to apologize to ThuranX above, and was rejected out of hand. I do not have a strong interest in remaining involved in this matter, and would appreciate it if ThuranX would stop including me in his rants. ThuranX, your anger and vitriol serves only to isolate you further and undermines your own arguments.

<dd>So there is. Well, as you can see, I rejected it then, and I reject it now. I further admit to being more aggravated by your recent chastisement on my user page. The person posting posted quite clearly that he ONLY came to my page because of WP:CMC, and because he supports the right of WP:CMC to do whatever they want without being CIVIL. I consider such a posting an ATTACK, and yet you force me to sit there with it on my page. Don't bother expecting me to accept the apologies of a man who says 'Oh, i'm sorry, and here, let this man slap you in the face or i'll penalize you'. <a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThuranX_db95.html" title="User:ThuranX">ThuranX</a> 20:37, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

However, putting your animosity towards me aside for a moment, please consider that not all participants in WP:COMICS are part of a cabal intending to dominate you, and some may in fact have good intentions.

<dd>Regarding your request for an apology from me, I've requested mediation as of earlier today. If they feel that I have behaved inappropriately I intend to follow their guidance. In the meantime, perhaps it would help you to read [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Markeer#Regarding_Current_Dispute_With_ThuranX:_For_Mediators" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Markeer#Regarding_Current_Dispute_With_ThuranX:_For_Mediators" rel="nofollow">my version</a>] of this dispute on my talk page that I wrote up for the mediators. I hope reading this does not further antagonize you or upset you as that is not my intention. If even one person feels my linking it is inappropriate or instigating, I will remove this comment immediately. My intention is for ThuranX to look at all of this from the perspective of one of the people he is in dispute with, that's all. -<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkeer_0d07.html" title="User:Markeer">Markeer</a> 21:14, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Fine, duly noted, Josiah is NOT, in fact, a part of the WP:Comics group. I do see that, and apologize for lumping you in with them. Regardless, I believe your apology was NOT sincere, for reasons I have already stated; summarily, your 100&amp; support of their actions and incivility, as evidenced by your repeated attempts to chastise me, and me alone, and thus, perpetuating the idea that 'bold' editing and incivility is fine for everyone BUT me.<a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThuranX_db95.html" title="User:ThuranX">ThuranX</a> 21:30, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>ThuranX, I've already explained the reasons why I have chastized you, and no one else, in this matter. However, for the record, here they are once again:
<ul>
<li>Yesterday, I did not see anyone else making offensive comments on this page or in edit summaries.</li>
<li>I have not systematically gone through the histories to find such evidence, because despite my best intentions I have now become a participant in the dispute and it would be inappropriate for me to act administratively in this matter. (Please note that for the same reason, I will not block ThuranX myself, despite what appear to me to be consistent violations of <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a> and <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>.)</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>I'm sorry that ThuranX sees my focus on him as constituting "100% support" of other parties — that was never my intention. I have <i>no</i> opinion on the edits or behavior of any of the other participants in this dispute. I'm just not interested in digging for evidence, especially since I am now a party to the dispute myself. If I witness inappropriate editing or violations of Wikipedia policy by other participants in future, I may put the appropriate warnings on their user pages but will not act administratively.</dd>

<li>Upholding Wikipedia policy</li>
<li>Improving this template.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>I'm not sure what ThuranX wants from me, since I have given a sincere apology and he has rejected it. I have put a comment at <a href="../../../a/n/2F/WP%7EAN_I_9983.html#ThuranX_and_templates" title="WP:AN/I">WP:AN/I#ThuranX and templates</a>, inviting my fellow administrators to review my conduct in this affair, and will accept their collective judgement. For now, I'll just try to step back and let things cool off for a bit. —<a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJosiah_Rowe_4f72.html" title="User:Josiah Rowe">Josiah Rowe</a> <small>(<a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJosiah_Rowe_ba00.html" title="User talk:Josiah Rowe">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Josiah_Rowe_5f31.html" title="Special:Contributions/Josiah Rowe">contribs</a>)</small> 22:10, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I've stated 'what I want' repeatedly. A part in the revision of the template. It is no longer possible to give me what I want, because i was ignored throughout the process. Given that the edits have been made, and will no doubt be re-instated, there is nothing more that I want, since no one except you has even TRIED to apologize. AMiB hasn't, and I suspect, will not. Markeer has not, and rather than admit any wrongdoing, has gone for mediation. ChrisGriswold has not, and frankly, I don't want to deal with a self-declared bully anyway. TO my eyes, this situation went from bad, to worse, to unrepairable rapidly, because I was summarily insulted, ignored, dismissed, and finally, accused, all for creating a profile that frankly, I wish I never had. Wikipedia's not worth this trouble any more.<a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThuranX_db95.html" title="User:ThuranX">ThuranX</a> 22:22, 7 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>HA! You need to look at that Bully userbox in context. I made it; doesn't mean i consider myself one. I was considering creating a bunch of bad-behavior userboxes for people to put on their pages themselves. HEE-larious! ThuranX, I want you to know that I love you. I want the best for and from you, and I believe in you! You are great! You are wonderful! Now please try to cooperate!
