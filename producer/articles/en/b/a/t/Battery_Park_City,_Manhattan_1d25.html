The Hudson waterfront with Battery Park City.</div>

</div>
<p>Battery Park City is bounded on the east by <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Street_%28Manhattan%29_94f3.html" title="West Street (Manhattan)">West Street</a>, which insulates the area from the <a href="../../../f/i/n/Financial_District_%28Manhattan%29_9c59.html" title="Financial District (Manhattan)">Financial District</a> of downtown Manhattan. To the west, north and south, the area is surrounded by the tidal estuary of the Hudson River.</p>
<p>The development consists of roughly five major sections. Traveling North to South, the first neighborhood, the "North Residential Neighborhood," consists of high-rise residential buildings, a large hotel, <a href="../../../s/t/u/Stuyvesant_High_School_9363.html" title="Stuyvesant High School">Stuyvesant High School</a> and a mall (currently occupied by a movie theater, restaurants and a discount store for leather goods and accessories). Former parkland in the area is being converted into high-rise buildings.</p>
<p>Immediately to the South lies the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Financial_Center_3e12.html" title="World Financial Center">World Financial Center</a>, a complex of several commercial buildings occupied by tenants including <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Express_352b.html" title="American Express">American Express</a>, <a href="../../../d/o/w/Dow_Jones_%26_Company_0c22.html" title="Dow Jones &amp; Company">Dow Jones &amp; Company</a>, <a href="../../../m/e/r/Merrill_Lynch_9fab.html" title="Merrill Lynch">Merrill Lynch</a> and <a href="../../../d/e/l/Deloitte_%26_Touche_583e.html" title="Deloitte &amp; Touche">Deloitte &amp; Touche</a>. The World Financial Center's ground floor and portions of the second floor are occupied by a mall; its center point is a steel-and-glass atrium known as the <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winter_Garden_Atrium_9991.html" title="Winter Garden Atrium">Winter Garden</a>. Outside of the Winter Garden lies a sizeable <a href="../../../y/a/c/Yacht.html" title="Yacht">yacht</a> harbor on the Hudson known as North Cove.</p>
<p>South of the World Financial Center lies the majority of Battery Park City's residential areas, in three sections: "Gateway Plaza", a high-rise building complex; the "Rector Place Residential Neighborhood" and the "Battery Place Residential Neighborhood", mostly low-rise building complexes. These neighborhoods contain most of the area's residential buildings, along with park space and various types of supporting businesses (<a href="../../../s/u/p/Supermarket.html" title="Supermarket">supermarkets</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/s/Restaurant.html" title="Restaurant">restaurants</a>, <a href="../../../m/o/v/Movie_theatre.html" title="Movie theatre">movie theatres</a>.) Construction of residential buildings began north of the World Financial Center in the late 1990s.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/t/Battery_Park_City%2C_Manhattan_1d25.html" title="Edit section: History">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
<p>By the late 1950s, the once prosperous port area of downtown Manhattan was occupied by a number of dilapidated shipping piers, casualties of the rise of air transport. The initial proposal to reclaim this area through landfill was offered in the early 1960s by private firms and supported by the Mayor. This plan became complicated when Governor <a href="../../../n/e/l/Nelson_Rockefeller_e416.html" title="Nelson Rockefeller">Nelson Rockefeller</a> announced his desire to redevelop a part of the area as a separate project. The various groups reached a compromise, and in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1966.html" title="1966">1966</a> the governor unveiled the proposal for what would become Battery Park City. The creation of architect <a href="../../../w/a/l/Wallace_K._Harrison_0924.html" title="Wallace K. Harrison">Wallace K. Harrison</a>, the proposal called for a 'comprehensive community' consisting of housing, social infrastructure and light industry. The landscaping of the parkspace and later the Winter Garden was designed by <a href="../../../m/2E/_/M._Paul_Friedberg_e175.html" title="M. Paul Friedberg">M. Paul Friedberg</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/6/1968.html" title="1968">1968</a>, the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_State_Legislature_024f.html" title="New York State Legislature">New York State Legislature</a> created the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battery_Park_City_Authority_551c.html" title="Battery Park City Authority">Battery Park City Authority</a> (BPCA) to oversee development. The <a href="../../../e/m/p/Empire_State_Development_Corporation_4d1f.html" title="Empire State Development Corporation">New York State Urban Development Corporation</a> and ten other public agencies were also involved in the development project.<sup id="_ref-enr-1983_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-enr-1983" title="">[1]</a></sup> For the next several years, the BPCA made slow progress. In <a href="../../../1/9/6/1969.html" title="1969">1969</a>, it unveiled a master plan for the area, and in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1972.html" title="1972">1972</a> issued $200 million in bonds to fund construction efforts. Landfill material from the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Trade_Center_57c9.html" title="World Trade Center">World Trade Center</a> was used to add land, and a cellular <a href="../../../c/o/f/Cofferdam.html" title="Cofferdam">cofferdam</a> was constructed to retain the material.<sup id="_ref-iglauer_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-iglauer" title="">[2]</a></sup> By <a href="../../../1/9/7/1976.html" title="1976">1976</a> the landfill was completed; in many cases, the pre-existing piers were simply buried. Construction efforts ground to a halt for nearly two years beginning in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1977.html" title="1977">1977</a>, as a result of city-wide financial hardships. In <a href="../../../1/9/7/1979.html" title="1979">1979</a>, the title to the landfill was transferred from the city to the Battery Park City Authority, which financially restructured itself and created a new, more limited master plan.</p>
<p>During the late 1970's and early 1980's the site hosted Creative Time's landmark Art on the Beach sculpture exhibitions.</p>
<p>Construction began on the first residential building in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980.html" title="1980">1980</a>, followed in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1981.html" title="1981">1981</a> with the start of construction on the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Financial_Center_3e12.html" title="World Financial Center">World Financial Center</a>. <a href="../../../o/l/y/Olympia_and_York_c97f.html" title="Olympia and York">Olympia and York</a>, of <a href="../../../t/o/r/Toronto.html" title="Toronto">Toronto</a>, was named as the developer for the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Financial_Center_3e12.html" title="World Financial Center">World Financial Center</a> in 1981, who then hired <a href="../../../c/e/s/Cesar_Pelli_2c03.html" title="Cesar Pelli">Cesar Pelli</a> as the lead architect. By 1985, construction was completed and the World Financial Center saw its first tenants.</p>
<p>Throughout the 1980s, the Battery Park City Authority oversaw a great deal of construction, including the entire Rector Place neighborhood and the river Esplanade. It was during this period that current City Planning Department Director <a href="../../../a/m/a/Amanda_Burden_491c.html" title="Amanda Burden">Amanda Burden</a> worked on Battery Park City. In the early 1990s, Battery Park City became the new home of the <a href="../../../s/t/u/Stuyvesant_High_School_9363.html" title="Stuyvesant High School">Stuyvesant High School</a>. By the turn of the century, Battery Park City was mostly completed, with the exception of some ongoing construction on West Street.</p>
<p>Current residential neighborhoods of Battery Park City are divided into a north and south section, separated by the World Financial Center Complex. The southern section, extending down from the Winter Garden, is the more densely populated region, containing Gateway Plaza, and Rector Place apartment buildings. The northern section, although still under very large construction, consists entirely of large, 20-45 story buildings which are all various shades of orange brick.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_11%2C_2001_attacks.html" title="September 11, 2001 attacks">September 11, 2001 attacks</a> had a major impact on Battery Park City. More than two thirds of the area's residents fled after the adjacent <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Trade_Center_57c9.html" title="World Trade Center">World Trade Center</a> towers collapsed. Gateway Plaza, the largest of the residential buildings, was punctured by airplane parts, and the Winter Garden was severely damaged. Environmental concerns regarding dust from the Trade Center have also been a continuing source of worry. Since the attacks, much of the damage has been repaired; reduced rents and government subsidies have gone a long way to restoring residential occupancy.</p>
<p>In the meantime, real estate development in the area continues unabated. More recent projects include Tribeca Green, which caters to the environmentally conscious, and several other buildings.</p>
