<p>The battle arose from an <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">American</a> plan to capture <a href="../../../m/o/n/Montreal.html" title="Montreal">Montreal</a>. It was devised by Secretary of War <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Armstrong%2C_Jr._8987.html" title="John Armstrong, Jr.">John Armstrong</a>, who originally intended taking the field himself. Because it was difficult to concentrate the necessary force in one place due to inadequate lines of communication, it involved two forces which would combine for the final assault. General <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Wilkinson_614e.html" title="James Wilkinson">James Wilkinson's</a> division of 8,000 would proceed down the <a href="../../../s/a/i/Saint_Lawrence_River_2d16.html" title="Saint Lawrence River">Saint Lawrence River</a> in <a href="../../../g/u/n/Gunboat.html" title="Gunboat">gunboats</a>, <a href="../../../b/a/t/Batteau.html" title="Batteau">batteaux</a> and other small craft, and rendezvous with another division of 4,000 under <a href="../../../w/a/d/Wade_Hampton_I_d985.html" title="Wade Hampton I">Wade Hampton</a> advancing north from <a href="../../../l/a/k/Lake_Champlain_5cc6.html" title="Lake Champlain">Lake Champlain</a>, to attack the city.</p>
<p>The plan had several shortcomings. There was mistrust between the officers concerned; Wilkinson had an unsavoury reputation as a scoundrel, and Hampton originally refused to serve in any capacity in the same army as Wilkinson. The troops lacked training and uniforms, and there were too few experienced officers. Chiefly though, it appeared that neither force would be able to sustain itself before Montreal, making a siege or any prolonged operation impossible. The poor prospects for success led Armstrong to abandon his intention of leading the final assault himself, and he handed overall command to Wilkinson.</p>

<p>Wilkinson's force left <a href="../../../s/a/c/Sackett%27s_Harbor%2C_New_York_7797.html" title="Sackett's Harbor, New York">Sackett's Harbor, New York</a> on <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_17.html" title="October 17">October 17</a>. Mid-October was very late for serious campaigning in the Canadas and the American force was hampered by bad weather, losing several boats and suffering from sickness and exposure. On <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_1.html" title="November 1">November 1</a> they reached <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_Creek%2C_New_York_b179.html" title="French Creek, New York">French Creek, New York</a>, where there was a clash with <a href="../../../b/r/i/Britain.html" title="Britain">British</a> gunboats escorting supplies up the Saint Lawrence. From French Creek, Wilkinson proceeded down the river. On <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_6.html" title="November 6">November 6</a>, he learned that Hampton had been repulsed by a smaller <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canadian</a> force at the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Chateauguay_86f8.html" title="Battle of Chateauguay">Chateauguay River</a> on <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_26.html" title="October 26">October 26</a>. He sent fresh instructions to Hampton to meet him at <a href="../../../c/o/r/Cornwall%2C_Ontario_ac0c.html" title="Cornwall, Ontario">Cornwall</a>.</p>
<p>Wilkinson's force successfully bypassed the British post at <a href="../../../p/r/e/Prescott%2C_Ontario_cd6b.html" title="Prescott, Ontario">Prescott</a> late on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_7.html" title="November 7">November 7</a>. (The troops were disembarked and marched around <a href="../../../o/g/d/Ogdensburg%2C_New_York_8159.html" title="Ogdensburg, New York">Ogdensburg</a> on the south bank of the river, while the lightened boats ran past the British batteries under cover of darkness and poor visibility). The next day, while the main body re-embarked, an advance guard under Colonel <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_Macomb_ceb1.html" title="Alexander Macomb">Alexander Macomb</a> and a battalion of riflemen under Major <a href="../../../b/e/n/Benjamin_Forsyth_2a67.html" title="Benjamin Forsyth">Benjamin Forsyth</a> was landed on the Canadian side of the river to clear the river bank of harassing Canadian militia.</p>
<p>On the following day (<a href="../../../n/o/v/November_9.html" title="November 9">November 9</a>), Wilkinson held a <a href="../../../c/o/u/Council_of_war.html" title="Council of war">Council of war</a>. All his senior officers appeared to be determined to proceed with the expedition, regardless of the difficulties and alarming reports of enemy strength. The advance guard was reinforced with a brigade under Brigadier General <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jacob_Brown_93e9.html" title="Jacob Brown">Jacob Brown</a>, and marched eastward along the northern bank of the river. Before the main body could follow by water, Wilkinson learned that a British force was pursuing him. He landed almost all the other troops as a rearguard, under Brigadier General <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Parker_Boyd_be9d.html" title="John Parker Boyd">John P. Boyd</a>. Late on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_10.html" title="November 10">November 10</a>, after a day spent marching under intermittent fire from British gunboats and field guns, Wilkinson set up his headquarters in Cook's Tavern, with Boyd's troops bivouacked in the woods around.</p>

<p>The British had been aware of the American concentration at Sackett's Harbor, but for a long time they had believed that their own main naval base at <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kingston%2C_Ontario_9a55.html" title="Kingston, Ontario">Kingston</a> was the intended target. Major General <a href="../../../f/r/a/Francis_de_Rottenburg_7aea.html" title="Francis de Rottenburg">Francis de Rottenburg</a>, the Lieutenant Governor of Upper Canada, had massed his available troops there. When he heard that the Americans were heading down the Saint Lawrence from French Creek, he dispatched a <i>Corps of Observation</i> after them, under Lieutenant Colonel <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joseph_Wanton_Morrison_8d10.html" title="Joseph Wanton Morrison">Joseph Wanton Morrison</a>. Commander <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Mulcaster_c653.html" title="William Mulcaster">William Mulcaster</a> commanded the escorting gunboats and small craft. Departing from Kingston late on November 8, they evaded the ships of Commodore <a href="../../../i/s/a/Isaac_Chauncey_683c.html" title="Isaac Chauncey">Isaac Chauncey</a> which were blockading the base, among the "Thousand Islands" at the head of the Saint Lawrence River.</p>
<p>The corps numbered 650 men but was reinforced by a detachment from Prescott, to about 800. Late on November 10, they encamped near Crysler's Farm, two miles upstream from the American positions. The terrain was mainly open fields, which gave full scope to British tactics and musketry. Morrison was keen to accept battle here if offered.</p>

<p>As dawn broke on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_11.html" title="November 11">November 11</a>, it was cold and raining. Firing broke out in two places. On the river, Mulcaster's gunboats began shooting at the American boats clustered around Cook's Point. Meanwhile, an American party fired a volley at some <a href="../../../m/o/h/Mohawk_nation.html" title="Mohawk nation">Mohawks</a> scouting near their encampment, and half a dozen Canadian militia dragoons bolted back to the main British force, calling that the Americans were attacking. The British force dropped its half-cooked breakfast and formed up, which caused American sentries to report that the <i>British</i> were attacking, and forced the Americans in turn to form up and stand to arms.</p>
<p>The American boats would soon have to face the Long Sault rapids and Wilkinson determined to drive Morrison off before tackling them. However, he himself had been ill for some time, and could not command the attack himself. His second-in-command, Major General <a href="../../../m/o/r/Morgan_Lewis_892c.html" title="Morgan Lewis">Morgan Lewis</a> was also "indisposed". This left Brigadier General John P. Boyd in command. He had the 3rd Brigade under Brigadier General <a href="../../../l/e/o/Leonard_Covington_6012.html" title="Leonard Covington">Leonard Covington</a> (9th, 16th and 25th U.S. Infantry), the 4th Brigade under Brigadier General Robert Swartwout (11th, 14th and 21st U.S. Infantry) and part of his own 1st Brigade under Colonel <a href="../../../i/s/a/Isaac_Coles_b542.html" title="Isaac Coles">Isaac Coles</a> (12th and 13th U.S. Infantry). Only two 6-pounder guns were attached to the rearguard, but four more guns and a squadron of the 2nd Dragoons were available further down-river. In all, Boyd commanded perhaps 2,500 men (though some sources put the figure at 4,000).</p>
<p>The British were disposed in echelon, with their right wing thrown forward:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lining a ravine close to the American positions and in the woods on the left was the skirmish line under Major <a href="../../../f/r/e/Frederick_Heriot_373e.html" title="Frederick Heriot">Heriot</a> of the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_Voltigeurs_38df.html" title="Canadian Voltigeurs">Canadian Voltigeurs</a>; three companies (perhaps only 60 men) of the Voltigeurs and around two dozen <a href="../../../m/o/h/Mohawk_nation.html" title="Mohawk nation">Mohawks</a>. (A small rifle company of the Leeds Militia may also have been present.)</li>
<li>The right wing under Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Pearson (the flank companies of the <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Royal_Berkshire_Regiment_%28Princess_Charlotte_of_Wales%27s%29_0cc0.html" title="The Royal Berkshire Regiment (Princess Charlotte of Wales's)">49th</a> and a detachment of the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_Units_of_the_War_of_1812_4cb4.html#The_Canadian_Fencibles" title="Canadian Units of the War of 1812">Canadian Fencibles</a>, totalling perhaps 100 men with a 6-pounder gun of the Canadian Provincial Artillery) occupied some buildings near the Americans.</li>
<li>Behind their left flank were three companies (150 men) of the 2nd battalion of the <a href="../../../8/9/t/89th_%28The_Princess_Victoria%27s%29_Regiment_of_Foot_297a.html" title="89th (The Princess Victoria's) Regiment of Foot">89th Foot</a> under Captain G. W. Barnes.</li>
<li>Behind Barnes's left flank in turn was the British main body; the battalion companies of the 49th (160 men) under Lieutenant Colonel Charles Plenderleath and six companies (300 men) of the 2nd/89th under Morrison himself. Two 6-pounder guns of the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Artillery_85a7.html" title="Royal Artillery">Royal Artillery</a> under Captain H. G. Jackson occupied a small hillock behind the 49th.</li>
</ul>
<p><a name="The_action" id="The_action"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Crysler%27s_Farm_88c2.html" title="Edit section: The action">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The action</span></h3>
<p>Boyd did not order an assault until the middle of the afternoon, or even later. On the American right, the 21st U.S. Infantry under Colonel <a href="../../../e/l/e/Eleazer_Wheelock_Ripley_4481.html" title="Eleazer Wheelock Ripley">Eleazer Wheelock Ripley</a> advanced and drove the British skirmish line back through the woods, for almost a mile. Here they paused to draw breath, and were joined by the 12th and 13th U.S. Infantry from Coles's brigade. (Where Swartwout's other two regiments were at this point is unclear). Ripley and Coles resumed their advance along the edge of the woods, but were startled to see a line of redcoats (the 2nd/89th, on Morrison's left flank) apparently rise out of the ground and open fire. The American soldiers dived behind tree stumps and bushes to return fire, and their attack lost all order and momentum. As ammunition ran short, they began straggling back out of the line.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Covington's brigade struggled across the ravine and deployed into line, under <a href="../../../s/h/r/Shrapnel.html" title="Shrapnel">shrapnel</a> fire. Legend has it that at this point, Covington mistook the battle-hardened 49th who were wearing their grey greatcoats, for militia. He was mortally wounded (by a rifle shot, in some American accounts), and his second-in-command was also killed moments later. The brigade quickly lost order and began to retreat.</p>
<p>Boyd could not bring all his six guns into action until his infantry were already falling back. When they did open fire from the road along the river bank, they were quite effective. Morrison's second-in-command, Lieutenant Colonel <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Harvey_%28governor%29_5f60.html" title="John Harvey (governor)">John Harvey</a>, ordered the 49th to charge them. The American dragoons (under Wilkinson's adjutant general, Colonel John Walbach) now intervened, charging the 49th's exposed right flank. The 49th halted their charge and wheeled back their right. Under heavy fire, the Dragoons renewed their charge twice but eventually fell back, leaving 18 casualties (out of 130). They had bought time for all but one gun to be removed. Barnes's companies captured the one gun which had become bogged down and been abandoned.</p>
<p>It was now about half past four. Almost all the American army was in full retreat. The 25th U.S. Infantry under Colonel <a href="../../../e/d/m/Edmund_P._Gaines_fbb3.html" title="Edmund P. Gaines">Gaines</a> and the collected boat guards under Lieutenant Colonel Timothy Upham held the ravine for a while, but Pearson threatened to get round their left flank, and they too fell back. As it was growing dark and the weather was turning stormy, the British halted their advance. The American Army meanwhile retreated in great confusion to their boats and crossed to the south (American) bank of the river.</p>

<p>Late on the day of the battle, Jacob Brown had reported that he had defeated 500 Stormont and Glengarry Militia at Hoople's Creek and the way ahead was clear. On <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_12.html" title="November 12">November 12</a>, the sullen American flotilla successfully navigated the Long Sault rapids. A letter now reached them from Hampton, declining to rendezvous at Cornwall, and Wilkinson used this as pretext to call another council of war, which unanimously opted to end the campaign.</p>
<p>The army went into winter quarters at French Mills, New York, but the roads were almost impassable at this season, and Wilkinson was forced by lack of supplies to retreat to Plattsburg. He was dismissed from command after a failed attack on a British outpost at <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Lacolle_Mills_%281814%29_98c8.html" title="Battle of Lacolle Mills (1814)">Lacolle Mills</a>. He was subsequently <a href="../../../c/o/u/Court_martial.html" title="Court martial">court martialled</a> on various charges of negligence, but exonerated. Lewis was retired, while Boyd was sidelined into rear-area commands.</p>
