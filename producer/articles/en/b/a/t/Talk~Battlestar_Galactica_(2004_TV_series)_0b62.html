<p>I believe it might be a good idea to add a year number to the name of this article. There are just to many programs with the same name. Something like Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series). What do you think? --84.178.93.205 22:40, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I find the format of the three "New Battlestar" articles a bit confusing. There should be one main article for the new format and there should be sub-articles based off that. I don't see why the miniseries should be separate from the (TV series) - it's the same show. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorphh_f32d.html" title="User:Morphh">Morphh</a> 00:25, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't know if you guys know something I don't, but I sure as hell thought that it was called either BSG (RDM) or BSG (2003), seeing as that's when the pilot/miniseries aired. I don't know who decided on 2004. Might as well call it BSG (2007), it's also airing this year. <a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EErik_E._55d6.html" title="User:Erik E.">Erik E.</a> 00:02, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I don't think "RDM" would be an appropriate disambiguator on Wikipedia (BSG-Wiki follows different rules). Since this article is about the regular series (which doesn't officially include the miniseries), and the regular series began airing in 2004, 2004 is the correct disambiguator. --<a href="../../../f/r/u/User%7EFru1tbat_fa7f.html" title="User:Fru1tbat">Fru1tbat</a> 02:00, 30 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Wrong, the regular series <b>officially</b> does include the miniseries. This can be seen from the season one DVD (which, is not called "miniseries and season one", yet still contains the miniseries (unless I'm mistaken that the DVD box qualifies as official notation, don't see how you could get any more official?). Only if you download BSG from <b>torrent sites</b> is the miniseries and season one separated. Now, you may argue that they only did this for added simplicity. But I think that reasonsing should still be good enough for wikipedia. It's not like it's less accurate. Pilots are always considered to be part of the show, even if they were made before the show got approved for continuation (the point of the pilot). So, personally, I think that this article should be called "Battlestar Galactica (2003 TV series) instead. But you know. Do what you want. <a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EErik_E._55d6.html" title="User:Erik E.">Erik E.</a> 04:19, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You're misinterpreting the way it is packaged. Season One has thirteen episodes, but the DVD also includes the miniseries as an extra.

</blockquote>
The miniseries was released on DVD separately at first, but in some regions was also included on the S1 release. --<b><a href="../../../c/k/a/User%7ECkatz_0c62.html" title="User:Ckatz">Ckatz</a></b><i><small><sup><a href="../../../c/k/a/User_talk%7ECkatz_91bf.html" title="User talk:Ckatz"><font color="green">chat</font></a></sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ckatz_cb51.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ckatz"><font color="red">spy</font></a></sub></small></i> 05:26, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Wrong, I think you misinterpreted that quote you posted. Disc I contains the miniseries, much like it was part of season one (it was clearly labeled as the first, not the fifth disc). What you must be talking about is an extras disc.

</blockquote>
You're confusing an extra about the <b>origins of the miniseries</b> with the <b>actual miniseries</b>. Here's how it was laid out: Disc I - both miniseries episodes, disc II - next four episodes, disc III - next four episodes, disc IV - next four episodes and disc V - the last episode (and apparently the extras, can't claim to have watched them). Therefore, I'll stick to what I've said before. <a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EErik_E._55d6.html" title="User:Erik E.">Erik E.</a> 00:17, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm not sure what quotes are being misinterpreted by whom, but regardless, the miniseries is simply not treated as part of the regular series. Let's try to avoid arguing in circles here and summarize:</dd>
<dd>You assert that the miniseries is part of the series because (1) it was the pilot, and (2) it was included in the season 1 set, and the title of the set doesn't say "miniseries". My S1 box (R1) states "experience all 13 thrilling episodes of Season 1 and the four hour TV miniseries that started it all", which pretty clearly separates the two. That the title of the DVD set is just "Season One" is a matter of convenience <i>only</i>, not an indication of the official classification of the contents with respect to production, and it's production that matters here. The miniseries was produced as a miniseries (yes, with the expectation of a series, but it still wasn't a pilot in the traditional sense). Sci Fi's official website also separates the two -- the miniseries isn't even listed on the "Episodes" page, not under season 1 or anywhere else. I had to go to the "About" page to even find a link to it. I have yet to see anything that officially classifies it as part of season 1.</dd>
<dd>I'm not sure what you're referring to when you say "that reasoning should be good enough for wikipedia". To me it <b>does</b> seem less accurate to lump them together. Now, if a merge is proposed on the grounds that the miniseries isn't significant enough to warrant a separate article, that's different (though as the article is fairly lengthy and seems to have a good deal of unique content, I couldn't see that proposition holding up). But if you're just arguing that it <b>is</b> part of the series, and that the series actually started in 2003, I must respectfully, but strongly, disagree. --<a href="../../../f/r/u/User%7EFru1tbat_fa7f.html" title="User:Fru1tbat">Fru1tbat</a> 04:54, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No, I'm not misinterpreting the text - although Fru1tbat has done a much better job of explaining points that I intended to make. The text I quoted, while describing the fifth disc, served to illustrate that the miniseries was the <b>origin</b> for the series (thus making a distinction between the two) and that there are <b>thirteen</b> episodes in the first season (again, separating it from the miniseries). I, too, have never seen anything on-line or in print (including the Vancouver papers) that suggests the miniseries is a part of the first season.

<p>There seems to be a general habit in the BSG articles to refer to the two halves of Season 2 as if they were separate seasons, and use the US DVD release scheme (2.0, 2.5). There are several reasons why this is a bad idea:</p>
<ul>
<li>The official scifi.com website doesn't use them for its official lists (episodes, etc.)</li>
<li>This is the English Wikipedia, not the US Wikipedia. "2.0" and "2.5" are specific to certain regions (North America).</li>
<li>Many shows are released on DVD in volumes that don't maintain broadcast or production groupings (or even order, in some cases). Using the DVD nomenclature is nonstandard and sets a bad and confusing precedent.</li>
</ul>
<p>"2.0" and "2.5" may be convenient shorthand, and various people involved with the show's production may sometimes use the terms as such, but until official lists use the nomenclature, I think we're better off confining the terms to discussions of the DVDs in most cases.</p>

<p>it seems like the time units in the 2004 series is not well thought. in one of the episodes i had seen an analog wall clock which looks the same as analog clocks in real life: it was divided to 12 units, probably hours. the reason we traditionally seperate the circle to 12 sections has its root in the earth's movements (based on 360 days/year which defined a degree. months in a year:12, hours in a day:24 both divide 360 which makes this system practical). isn't this a contradiction or does anyone has a reasonable explanation for this such as their civilization's roots come from earth or something? <small>â€”The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 85.108.142.127 (talk â€¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_85.108.142.127_135c.html" title="Special:Contributions/85.108.142.127">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<dd>Your question can only be answered by debatable fan speculation because the show, being space opera like <i>Firefly</i> and <i>Star Wars</i>, really never gets into the technical details behind anything (unlike other shows like <i>Star Trek</i> and <i>Stargate SG-1</i>). BSG focuses on story - and the fact that Glen A. Larson, Joss Whedon and George Lucas know jack about physics, science and astronomy, so you have to maintain the suspension of disbelief.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>From a fan point-of-view I can only speculate that Caprica seems to have been the main world of the Twelve Colonies - the President resided there and the Battlestar Galactica was based there. Most of the main characters are from there as well (Giaus Baltar, Admiral Adama, Lee, and Starbuck). Therefore the 24-hour time standard was probably based on Caprica's rotation and months-years on it's orbit. According to the Battlestar Galactica video game which is based on the original show all the colony worlds are in one star system. If so - I think Caprica was probably the most populated and the most like Earth - while all the other colonies were terraformed or possibly colonies built on massive stations, orbital cities or whatever. Since we only have seen Caprica so far in the new show we'll never know unless they somehow go back to another colony world. Having all the colonies in one system would also explain why many human ships didn't have FTL drives. There were many interplanetary ships. But this is all my guess. <a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberia23_c7e4.html" title="User:Cyberia23">Cyberia23</a> 20:44, 4 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Moreover, any rotational period could be divided into 24 intervals, and those intervals labelled "hours". Mars could have 24 hours in a day, but they would be 1.04 times longer than earth hours. Since we have never seen a BSG episode run in real-time, we cannot even evaluate how long a BSG hour is. <a href="../../../d/e/b/User%7EDebivort_3273.html" title="User:Debivort">Debivort</a> 22:49, 4 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Let's move the discussion here, away from edit summaries. Personally, I feel like this list was starting to read too much like an summary of episodes. Do we really think there should be 13 described "main story arcs" for the 6 episodes of season 3 we've seen so far? Season 2 had 20 episodes, and 14 plot arcs (proportionally maybe there should be 42!). I think a reasonable criterion would be whether a topic has recurred in more than one episode - how do we know if Baltar's humanity is a <i>main arc of the season</i>? He only questioned in in the most recent episode. Thoughts? <a href="../../../d/e/b/User%7EDebivort_3273.html" title="User:Debivort">Debivort</a> 07:50, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Agree completely! I started to trim it down at one point, but it bloated right back up again. The "recurred in more than one episode" criterion is a good place to start, but some judgment still has to be used. There are a lot of minor arcs that aren't worth mentioning here. The question-type entries don't really belong at all, I don't think. They could probably be reworded to fit better, if they meet the other criteria. -- <a href="../../../f/r/u/User%7EFru1tbat_fa7f.html" title="User:Fru1tbat">Fru1tbat</a> 12:27, 6 November 2006 (UTC)

<p>Is listing the current specific ranks for each character necessary? It seems to me that their names and call signs should be enough. The rank issue makes it more complicated, what with various characters constantly changing ranks (Lee Adama goes from Captain to Major to Commander and back to Major again). Wouldn't ranks be better suited in the characters' individual pages and descriptions? Also, the ranks could be considered unmarked spoilers. Monsieurxander 16:03, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The military rank structure section seems entirely unnecessary, since it is almost (if not completely) the same as military rank structure in the real world. Could there not just be a short statement saying "Battlestar Galactica furthers its sense of realism by having its rank structure on the Galactica being nearly identical to the rank structure aboard a military aircraft carrier, with the notable exception of..."? This section seems like a huge, messy bit of fluff. For those who do not know exactly what a rank entails, they can click on a hyperlink provided in that particular character's page or description. An entire breakdown of military rank structure is not needed. Monsieurxander 16:27, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>This one I disagree pretty strongly on. Maybe it could be trimmed down, but considering the show is largely a military show, discussing the rank structure is appropriate, even fairly important. The officer ranks are intermingled enough that saying they're close to real-world ranks isn't really accurate. Maybe the enlisted ranks don't need to be spelled out quite so precisely, but I don't see a problem with it, myself. The descriptions of the military organization (e.g. battlestar groups, etc) are pretty key as well.</dd>

</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>I concur with keeping this section. In fact it really ought to be expanded as the Galactica rank structure doesn't comport with any "real world" military rank structure. Case in point Colonel Tigh as XO. In any English speaking navy there would never be a Colonel as the executive officer of a naval vessel. Aside from using the same names for ranks as some "real world" militaries, the Galactica rank structure is unique in it's implementation.</p>
<dl>
<dd>The military rank section should be kept, its interesting and the show revolves around the military guarding the convoy. Plus when you say it "conforms" to the real world, what real world? All the countries in the world don't have the same rank structure as the USA, unless this surprises you. Even if it conforms to some country, then you might want to state which country.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The ranks are, if anything, much closer to army ranks (or in US terms, air force too -- indeed, look at SG-1, with USAF colonels as commanding officers of battlecruisers, a vaguely comparable situation). The most obvious exception is the admiral rank, and "commander" (which is more like commodore in naval tradition). However, that would be to complicate the discussion, rather than to simplify it, and I agree that removal, or over-simplified summary, doesn't seem like a good idea. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlai_39a8.html" title="User:Alai">Alai</a> 23:05, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>The average person learning about the show wouldn't care all that much about the military rank of the show. The rank as part of the show is almost unimportant.</p>
<p>Also, I don't know where to put this but there should be some type of information on the ratings of the series, that would be far more helpful than some long discussion of the ranks of the characters. All they reall need to know is that Adama is in charge of the military and the President is in charge of the fleet. Nobody cares that "Colonel" Tigh is a "XO," and that is different from some RL military, they just should know he is second in command.</p>

<dd>The "average" person may not care, but fans come to Wikipedia for pertinent details like this. It may be a level of detail that properly belongs in a subordinate article. <a href="../../../a/v/t/User%7EAvt_tor_cbb9.html" title="User:Avt tor">Avt tor</a> 12:56, 12 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I disagree. The average person doesn't care; it's <a href="../../../f/a/n/Wikipedia%7EFancruft_fe73.html" title="Wikipedia:Fancruft">fancruft</a>, content of importance only to a small population of enthusiastic fans.

This section should be shortened, with the most important information reorganized to clarify its value.

<dd>I disagree, the ranks are important. It's not as if it's a family drama, and the fact that a character is a tax attorney is irrelevant to the story means it doesn't need to be mentioned. Battlestar Galactica is about a military vessel, it's in the title. Therefore, the ranks should stay, so that people can learn that, yes, there is a difference from the real world. I was confused as hell when Adama is just a Commander and gets to be in charge. US Army/Marine/Air Force Colonel is the equivalent of a Navy Captain. A Commander in the Navy is the equivalent of a Lt Colonel in the Army. This stuff is confusing, so a simple explanation like the one here is good. Make it another page if you don't like it in the article, with just a link and a mention of how it differs from real world. Then the page can get a little bigger with more comparisons. But as presently written, it's useful. --<a href="../../../p/h/a/User%7EPhantasee_2de3.html" title="User:Phantasee">Phant</a> 17:48, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Following the Cylons' genocidal attack on the 12 colonies, the surviving colonials flee through space in hope of escaping their attackers and finding a new home. Ongoing storylines in Season 1 include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Helo's struggle to stay alive on Cylon-occupied Caprica and his unwitting involvement in a Cylon plan that employs a copy of Lt. Sharon "Boomer" Valerii.</li>
<li>The juxtaposition of military and government forces as the assumed leaders and decision-makers for the only surviving members of the human race; most chiefly represented by the mercurial collaboration between President Roslin and Commander Adama.</li>
<li>The struggle to provide ample resources for the remaining ships and their inhabitants.</li>
<li>The suspicion of humanoid Cylons hidden within the fleet. Some of these infiltrators have been programmed to believe they are human, and are unaware of the unstoppable Cylon mission they are designed to perform.</li>
<li>Boomer, the copy of Sharon Valerii on <i>Galactica</i>, spends the season trying to reconcile the increasing amount of evidence that she is one of these "sleeper" agents.</li>
<li>The accidental discovery of the planet Kobol, which, according to Pythian Scripture, is the birthplace of humanity and holds the key to finding Earth; however, it is also occupied by Cylons.</li>
<li>Adama asks Baltar to build a "Cylon Detector," but this process is hampered by Baltar's persistent hallucinations of Number Six and her insistence that God has a plan for him, as well as his fear of being unmasked as the traitor whose actions allowed the Cylons to execute their attack on the 12 Colonies.</li>
<li>The question of the elusive "plan" that the Cylons have and the reason behind their hateful fascination with humanity, which may have something to do with the destiny as foretold by the "one true God" they believe in (the religious Colonials are polytheistic).</li>

<dd>Seems like I'm not the first edit conflict you've started regarding this page. As part of WikiProject Canadian Television, I've created a category "Canadian science fiction television" to include shows made in Canada. This will help users see actors they like on other shows, and help them identify locations and actors from one show to the next. This information is useful, at least to my friends in Canadian media fandom. I am going through the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_science_fiction_TV_and_radio_shows_produced_in_Canada_7d61.html" title="List of science fiction TV and radio shows produced in Canada">List of science fiction TV and radio shows produced in Canada</a> and adding the category to shows on this list. It's widely known where shows are filmed, so the facts aren't in dispute. Where sources are requested or warranted, they can be provided. "Canadian" and "American" are not exclusive categories; a show could be written in Los Angeles and filmed in Vancouver. (In practice, producers usually want regular writers to be closer to the production set; only people who aren't involved in day-to-day production can really stay off site, but that's a side issue.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>When I see someone make a statement that I don't believe to be true, I put a {{fact]] template on the statement and give them a chance to respond, in the spirit of <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>. As noted, the facts themselves aren't in dispute, just the references, so the reverts without discussion aren't productive. Denying the Canadian role in productions made in Canada is in my eyes a denigration of Canadian culture, and a factual error I feel obliged to attempt to correct. That's what I've done. As an award-winning Canadian media fan writer active in many Canadian fan organizations, I have knowledge of this subject, as well as a journalistic obligation to present and distribute truth. As a Canadian with house and family in Canada, who also happens to carry an American passport and is currently working in Virginia, I have a clear understanding of the nuances of what is or is not "Canadian" or "American".</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>This effort cascades from a cleanup of the horribly bloated article on <a href="../../../s/c/i/Science_fiction_on_television.html" title="Science fiction on television">science fiction on television</a>. I saw a problem that led to other problems, which I'm working to correct.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I'm not going to request unprotection. When protection is lifted, I'm going to apply the category template, and I will provide sources when requested. If higher powers don't like that, they can block me. Not my call. In fact, it would be more efficient to block me than to protect the thirty-odd pages I intend to apply this category to. I'm just doing research to help the fan community; whether people use it or not is up to them.

<dd>Sorry, I missed a point there. It is factually incorrect to state that Sci-Fi broadcast the show in "North America", and "North America" is a term used to refer to the United States and Canada together, and Sci-Fi is not available in Canada.

<dd>In the absence of reliable sources I don't see how you can call these shows "American". They are part of the Canadian television industry. Even if you had reliable sources that indicated these were American, these are not exclusive definitions. Which is my main point here. You are the one making assertions without substantiation here. By your logic, I'm entitled to remove undocumented claims that any of these shows are American. <a href="../../../a/v/t/User%7EAvt_tor_cbb9.html" title="User:Avt tor">Avt tor</a> 13:33, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>And re IMDB specifically, I use it several times a day, for years, and to date I recall one possibly incorrect entry. It's main problem is missing bsdata, and that is much less of a problem since it was acquired by Amazon. It gets information directly from producers. Obviously any data entry methodology is subject to human error at some level, but the error rate for this is very low and mainly from the production companies themselves, not the database. In the absence of contradictory facts, countless Wikipedia editors routinely rely on and cite IMDB as an authoritative source; production companies themselves rely on it for distributing information. <a href="../../../a/v/t/User%7EAvt_tor_cbb9.html" title="User:Avt tor">Avt tor</a> 13:17, 11 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Few articles cite IMDb as a source, those that do are generally fixed.

<dd>No, IMDB sucks information from Amazon (its parent company), which in turn receives commercial product information from its vendors. These are done through database table exchanges. User details only go unchallenged into blank fields.</dd>

<dd>Besides, regardless of its method of information gathering, its accuracy seems quite a bit more than 99%, which is why it is built into browsers now and relied on by zillions of users. The difference between this level of accuracy and absolute truth approaches an infinitesimal limit and can be statistically compared to other objectives for reporting information. In accounting terms, the difference between IMDB's version and some platonic ideal is called "immaterial", i.e. not relevant with the context of generally accepted accounting principles. Even reliable sources fail, even limited sources are better than none. Production companies themselves do not deal with the public and so do not incur the cost of providing large commercial databases for free on expensive high-traffic web servers. It is possible to go to the primary source (i.e. take the DVD off the shelf, or BitTorrent something that one doesn't own. It's just time consuming.</dd>

<dd>The reality of the Canadian television business is that it is often necessary to organize financial relationships which may at some point generate a piece of legal documentation that defines "ownership" of a particular property with some corporation based outside the country. This is day to day reality that doesn't affect people who have jobs, except insofar as they get a paycheck at the end of the week. This is why Canadian shows have odd production delays and hiati. (The Dead Zone seems to produce a season every two years. Peter Coyote left after the second season, when it was thought to be cancelled, got a leading role on a completely different series, which failed, freeing him up to work in the third season, when the Canadian producers found more American money to keep going. That is the way the business functions.)</dd>

<p>Why is the UK listed as a country of origin? Thats is nonsense! The original mini-series was a US production with UK involvement that was filmed in Canada but the series is clearly an American production that also airs in the UK.

<dd>The United Kingdom co-produce(d?) the Battlestar Galactica TV series (operative words: TV series) - they also aired it first, generally the UK should be the only country listed, it is logical however to list the USA as well. <small><font face="Tahoma"><b>thanks</b>/Fenton, Matthew Lexic Dark <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_MatthewFenton_0db4.html" title="Special:Contributions/MatthewFenton">52278 Alpha 771</a></font></small> 15:09, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>How did the "UK" co-produce the series, I think you are talking about the mini-series and first season anyway, which was partially FINANCED (not produced) by a UK TV network and not the "UK". The series as far as I know is produced by Sci-Fi network (USA) and it now airs in the US first, months earlier than in the UK. It was also created by an American, is written by Americans, and is a new version of an American show and it certainly isn't made for a British audience - if it gets cancelled or renewed it is because of ratings in the States - regardless of how many people in the UK watch. This is just more wikipedian nationalist nonsense. The series is clearly American but some people in Canada and the UK apparently are determined to clutch at straws to claim a show that is clearly more American than anything else, regardless of where its filmed and what networks payed a "portion" of the financing for the mini-series. A British show it is not but you know that yourself. --84.153.40.191 16:26, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This show is written, directed, and produced by Americans, Canadians, British, Australians, and probably others; can't determine everyone's nationality. It's produced in Canada at the Vancouver Film Studios; a few of the big name actors are American, a couple are British (Apollo's accent always amuses me), most of the other actors in the show are Canadian. It is distributed, and thus owned, by NBC Universal. I don't know how it's organized; I know a heck of a lot of Canadians work there, but it seems diffuse, with various functions being performed by companies in different places. It's not as centralized as Stargate, where the executive producers want everybody in arms' reach and they all seem to hang out together. I strongly suspect that the British financial participation involves a level of control that allowed them to put British actors on the show, but it doesn't matter to me.</dd>
<dd>Every international project I've been involved in, we celebrate everybody's contribution, and in particular, the people who are in charge give the greatest share of credit the people who do the actual work, all the bigshots get to do is take their spreadsheets into their boardrooms to give their presentations and quietly get their zillion-dollar bonuses. Other people seem to be more about control. I just think we should stick to the verifiable facts to determine what's true, and consensus to determine what's relevant. I don't have the BSG DVDs. I suspect that the credits refer to both Britain and Canada in various contexts; it wouldn't be hard to BitTorrent an episode if one was interested. <a href="../../../a/v/t/User%7EAvt_tor_cbb9.html" title="User:Avt tor">Avt tor</a> 07:09, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Yes, this is BS. I'd like to see someone point out exactly what the UK contribution is to this show beyond a couple of actors, which can be said about almost anything. This is an American show filmed in Canada with mostly US/Can cast. BSG episodes emphatically do not air first in the UK. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadgerpatrol_9d70.html" title="User:Badgerpatrol">Badgerpatrol</a> 12:38, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>There are several points here; a) does the fact that a small proportion of the funding for one season out of 3 (or 4) came from Sky mean that the country of origin is the UK? (not in my view- many, many British shows would originate in the US or Canada under this definition (I rarely (e.g. never) see Canada stated to be the country of origin for Doctor Who, for example); b) is Sky actually a British company (no; it's mostly owned by NewsCorp and US investors); c) with regard to the "first showing" argument, is the mini-series (wholly US funded and produced and first shown in the US) the first showing of the revamped BSG (=yes). The British connection is very, very tenuous indeed; I think most readers are going to find it faintly ridiculous that the UK is shown first (or indeed, at all) in the infobox (the very least that should be done is to alphabetise the order so that Canada comes first). Anyway, it's clear that Matthew is a bit over-possessive and life is too short to devote more than a moment to this kind of issue. There are specific rules for the classification of film and televison productions by country, e.g. what is and isn't a "British" production- I'd certainly be interested to see these if anyone can lay hands on them. <b><small>PS- What is this gibberish?= <i>So si this Americaland and Canada connection (someone call the roflcopter!) - I've explained, you haven't.</i></small></b> <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadgerpatrol_9d70.html" title="User:Badgerpatrol">Badgerpatrol</a> 13:45, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Just to be clear: (1) "country of origin" is about distribution, not production, (2) country of origin is indicated by reliable sources, of which generally the most reliable is the copyright statement incorporated into the work, (3) as for production, the mechanics of television production make it economically impractical for "production" and "filming" to occur in separate places; the producers need to talk to people who have to be on set; production happens where the producers work, and in essentially all places for episodic television that has to be within walking distance of the soundstages where principal photography occurs, (4) the copyright statement on episodes of Battlestar Galactica say clearly that the work is copyright under the laws of the United States, (5) the frame which includes the copyright statement also has three large icons referring to production in Canada, and (6) on the episode I looked at, given the limitations of screen resolution, I did not see anything referring to British participation on the screen that included the copyright statement. According to industry-standard definitions and the authoritative source (the work itself), the country of origin of Battlestar Galactica is the United States, and this show is produced in Canada.</dd>

<dd>Having said that, I have never been in favor of narrow exclusive definitions in this area. Television projects involve complex forms of partnership at various legal levels, and companies may have considerable control without being on the copyright statement or being directly involved in production. It is my opinion that major partners and participants should be shown in some way. I would not be the one to remove the reference to UK participation, even if it doesn't meet the narrow definition of "country of origin". Sky One may well have put up some money to get the right to broadcast some episodes first, and to put some British actors on the show. <a href="../../../a/v/t/User%7EAvt_tor_cbb9.html" title="User:Avt tor">Avt tor</a> 16:51, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Speaking only for myself, I think there is no absolute rule and that editors have to use judgement on the reliability of sources for various kinds of information. Many sources are not perfectly reliable for information about the future, but rumors still have utilty to users (at other sites and publications, at least; it's pretty much Variety's <i>raison d'Ãªtre</i>). Many sites, even good fan sites, are reasonably reliable in regards to past information. In the area of reliability, I would ask: does the site have resources to verify what it says? Has it been reliable in the past (one must consider the volume of information provided, i.e. a site that has 100 useful facts, of which one is wrong, is much less accurate than a site that has a thousand mistakes out of a billion data entries)? Does it have access to authoritative information? Does it have a conflict of interest that would cause it to prefer certain facts or interpretations over others? Is there an editorial/quality check on information provided, or is it just unfiltered input from random users? I happen to think IMDB meets the standard of reliability, particularly for information entered straight from film credits. Other editors disagree, hence the need for judgement and consensus. I'm certainly not going to take someone else's opinion that such-and-such site isn't reliable if that opinion seems to conflict with observable facts. <a href="../../../a/v/t/User%7EAvt_tor_cbb9.html" title="User:Avt tor">Avt tor</a> 19:23, 29 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>This is petty and hopelessly pendantic, and that makes Wikipedia look bad. I don't care about that because this is the Internet and silly nonesense is par usual for it. What I do care about is somebody (MatthewFenton) reversed the primacy for the episode order so UK airdates are shown first even though new episodes air in the UK months after the US airdate, and I use Wikipedia to find out the next showing for new episodes and that gives me a headache. MatthewFenton please take your nationalist crusade to other parts of Wikipedia and leave the BG articles alone. 68.236.14.91 04:45, 5 February 2007 (UTC) MT</dd>

<p>This article is strangely organized, with low-importance points at the same level as major sections. I would take the existing text and organize it something like this:</p>
<pre>
   * 1 Plot (incorporate plot elements currently listed under "Synopsis"
   * 2 Cast
   ** 2.1 Main characters
   ** 2.2 Supporting characters
   ** 2.3 Recurring guest stars
   * 3 BSG Universe
   ** 3.1 Military rank structure

   ** 4.1 Season one

   ** 4.3 Webisodes
   ** 4.4 Season three
   ** 4.5 Main title
   * 5 Future developments
   ** 5.1 Spin-offs
   ** 5.2 Tie-in novels
   * 6 Awards and honors
   * 7 References
   * 8 See also
   * 9 External links
</pre>
<p><br />
This organization would invite contributors to include subsections about other aspects of the background (for example, the Cylons). Some of the existing material could also be summarized into subordinate articles.</p>
<p>I won't unilaterally reorganize the article without some discussion (or at least tacit approval) and I don't plan to rewrite a lot of actual text in the short term; I just want to make it easier for other people to fill in relevant details. <a href="../../../a/v/t/User%7EAvt_tor_cbb9.html" title="User:Avt tor">Avt tor</a> 19:27, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't know if "Future developments" is the right heading, as some of the items (e.g. the novels) have been released or started already, and the heading makes it sound like they're still in the planning stages. Something like "Derivative works" or even just "Spin-offs and tie-ins" would be preferable to me. "BSG universe" I'm not entirely comfortable with, but I can't think of anything better. "Main title" seems out of place under "Production", since the other sub-sections contain details concerning only production/filming/airing schedules, locations, etc. Again, a better place for it hasn't occurred to me yet. Other than those, the rest of your proposed organization looks fine to me. --<a href="../../../f/r/u/User%7EFru1tbat_fa7f.html" title="User:Fru1tbat">Fru1tbat</a> 19:40, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>HI! I'm a big BG fan! I don't know about the following from Schisms - <b>Sagitarons, for instance, take a literal interpretation of the Sacred Scroll, avoid modern medicine ("The Woman King"), and oppose abortion.</b> I thought it was Geminons that opposed abortion, as when the girl stowed away on board Galactica. <a href="../../../h/i/l/User%7EHillaryMawdesley_856e.html" title="User:HillaryMawdesley">HillaryMawdesley</a> 07:36, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, that's what I remember too. The Geminons are stated to strongly oppose seperation of religion and state, and abortion being allegedly in violation of their religous beliefs, seek to make it illegal. The Sagitarons seem to be a completely different brand of fanatic, and I don't remember a single reference to their opposing abortion. If I find the time, I'll rewatch the episodes and make the edit if it's needed, unless someone else beats me to it. <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomeguy1221_3762.html" title="User:Someguy1221">Someguy1221</a> 01:44, 2 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>In our reality, there are Christians who are against abortion, and there are Atheists who are against abortion. So too, in BSG there are different factions who share beliefs. The refreshing thing about this is that the colonial religion at least has different denominations like nearly every religion.75.111.57.38 23:37, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In some way should we list the ratings the show has generated? It definetly got attention with the numbers it pulled for a sci fi show, then in season three had a dramatic slump for what it had been (almost 30% loss of viewers on average) yet now is climbing again. Especially for a niche like science fiction where dominant ratings are rare, that seems somewhat encyclopedia appropriate and their must be neilson or whatever ratings they use for it somewhere that can be linked if not already.

<p>My very minor edit adding start and end dates to Katee Sackhoff's character <i>Starbuck</i> was reverted, and somewhat surprisingly I might add. Her character was seen to have died, and it has been reported that, at the very least, the episode <i>Maelstrom</i> was her last for the season. Shall we re-add a <b>(2004-2007)</b> mark to her entry on the main page until (and if) further information surfaces? <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedreth_b106.html" title="User:Redreth">Redreth</a> 03:53, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I see that <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdamDeanHall_e93e.html" title="User:AdamDeanHall">AdamDeanHall</a> has made the edit. Thanks. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedreth_b106.html" title="User:Redreth">Redreth</a> 20:08, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I've removed it again. It is too premature to presume that she is gone forever - death is not always terminal in science fiction. More to the point, unless we get some <b>official</b> confirmation, we can't add the dates. Think about it - if the character of Starbuck was really gone, as in permanently, the producers would probably have said so. We'd be hearing about how it was a bold move, or how it was the natural progression for the character for the character, or that Sackhoff wanted to move on. That doesn't mean we can guarantee that she <b>will</b> be back - only that we can't presume one way or the other. --<b><a href="../../../c/k/a/User%7ECkatz_0c62.html" title="User:Ckatz">Ckatz</a></b><i><small><sup><a href="../../../c/k/a/User_talk%7ECkatz_91bf.html" title="User talk:Ckatz"><font color="green">chat</font></a></sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ckatz_cb51.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ckatz"><font color="red">spy</font></a></sub></small></i> 21:01, 13 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Thank you Chatz. What kind of Science fiction fans are you guys. As Chatz stated death is not a permanent thing for science fiction. (if you paid close enough attention to the episode you would have heard it suggested in that dream of hers that she was going to see what lies between this world and the next). Plus the season is almost over so Maelstrom being her last episode is no shock here. --88wolfmaster 00:55, 14 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I think it's perfectly clear that the episode with all those flashbacks didn't set her up as having a destiny simply to die. She's bound to be back. If not, that episode was the most pointless and badly written one to date. <a href="../../../e/n/z/User%7EEnzedbrit_6d4b.html" title="User:Enzedbrit">Enzedbrit</a> 19:47, 15 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The actress that plays her signed on for 5 seasons so she'll most likely come back. There were a couple clues - her Viper was hit by something for real, which caused the decompression - her hand was on the eject lever - and when Apollo rounds the cloud to see the explosion there were two sets of vapor trails (one could have possibly been from the Raider she was chasing, and the other Starbuck's Viper). Was the Raider really there? The shattered cockpit and second vapor trail suggest there was another ship. And which ship exploded? We'll have to wait and see. <a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberia23_c7e4.html" title="User:Cyberia23">Cyberia23</a> 19:59, 15 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>well we can guess all day as to how they will bring her back as long as we agree that she will be coming back and therefore the adding of dates is incorrect.--88wolfmaster 04:14, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Being removed from screen credits doesn't mean jack... it's an old ploy to make you think a missing character is really off the show for good, and has been done many times before.</p>
<p><b>Reminder</b>: in the original series (or rather, in the dismal spinoff), <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Return_of_Starbuck" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Return_of_Starbuck" rel="nofollow">Starbuck hits a Cylon ship</a>, crashes and is left for dead, rebuilds a Cylon from parts of the crashed centurions, and (apparently) somehow retroactively fathers or at least becomes godfather to a child who helps the colonists eventually find Earth, and "ascends" to the Ship of Light (that part was unaired). Despite its intelligence and some obvious gender-bender changes, the new series has overall remained faithfull to the major arcs of the original series (the dead son, the Pegasus, etc), so when Katee went down in a blaze of glory, I just sort of assumed "oh, they're doing THAT one this week..." and figured they'd be getting back to her later on. Let's face it, if she was REALLY off the show, Katee wouldn't be under a <a href="http://www.thescifiworld.net/interviews/katee_sackhoff_01.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.thescifiworld.net/interviews/katee_sackhoff_01.htm" rel="nofollow">gag order</a> although there are indications we might not see her for a while. Then again, the boneheads may have her wake up on the resurrection ship... who knows? Let's hope they at least retain the "No Boxey" sensibility and forgo Dr. Zee as well... (children in space are always the result of second-string writers being whipped by clueless marketing execs long after the original writers have left, and usually appear soon after the series' obligatory "Western" or "Cultural Revolution" episode, in a pathetic attempt by second-string writers to "get in touch" with a younger audience, further alienating any connection with their real audience (with all due respect to Firefly, which was awesome as a western from day one)) -- Bif the Mildly Timid</p>
<p>Like I was saying...not dead yet....and they just had a credit for Katee at the end.--88wolfmaster 03:03, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>They have confirmed that Sackhoff has signed up for the Fourth (and possibly last) season of the show. However, that really doesn't mean anything as far as the death of Starbuck is concerned. She could become a "Head Starbuck" to Apollo - you just never know with a show like this. I think that calling her dead right now is highly premature. -- <a href="../../../a/l/u/User%7EAlucard_%28Dr.%29_cffe.html" title="User:Alucard (Dr.)">Alucard (Dr.)</a> | <a href="../../../a/l/u/User_talk%7EAlucard_%28Dr.%29_01bf.html" title="User talk:Alucard (Dr.)">Talk</a> 16:32, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Ok now that the season is over their are a couple things we need to discuss:</p>
<dl>
<dd>1. Should we keep the Katee was removed from the credits bit.</dd>
<dd>2. Should we address the song <a href="../../../a/l/l/All_Along_the_Watchtower_29a3.html" title="All Along the Watchtower">All Along the Watchtower</a> and if so how.</dd>
<dd>3. Should we address the new cylons and if so how.--88wolfmaster 03:10, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>My view: 1. She was removed from the credits, but they didn't run the normal two start title sequences in the version I saw - that might be worth noting (unless my recorder missed them) 2. Yes, as long as we don't speculate and 3. yes, by couching it in terms of the fact that the characters had various events occur that led them to believe they are cylons. That's about as far as we can go, base don the information we have, in my opinion. Anything else would be speculation. -- <a href="../../../a/l/u/User%7EAlucard_%28Dr.%29_cffe.html" title="User:Alucard (Dr.)">Alucard (Dr.)</a> | <a href="../../../a/l/u/User_talk%7EAlucard_%28Dr.%29_01bf.html" title="User talk:Alucard (Dr.)">Talk</a> 16:35, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
