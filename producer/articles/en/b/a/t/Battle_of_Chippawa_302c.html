<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Chippawa_302c.html" title="Edit section: Background">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Background</span></h2>
<p>By July <a href="../../../1/8/1/1814.html" title="1814">1814</a>, <a href="../../../n/a/p/Napoleon_I_dc31.html" title="Napoleon I">Napoleon</a> had been defeated in <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europe.html" title="Europe">Europe</a>, and the arrival of seasoned British veterans to Canada was imminent. The American Secretary of War <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Armstrong%2C_Jr._8987.html" title="John Armstrong, Jr.">John Armstrong</a> was eager to win a decisive victory in Canada before British reinforcements arrived there.</p>
<p>Major General <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jacob_Brown_93e9.html" title="Jacob Brown">Jacob Brown</a> was ordered to form the Left Division of the Army of the North. Armstrong intended him to mount an attack on <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kingston%2C_Ontario_9a55.html" title="Kingston, Ontario">Kingston</a>, the main British base on <a href="../../../l/a/k/Lake_Ontario_d812.html" title="Lake Ontario">Lake Ontario</a>, with a diversion by militia across the <a href="../../../n/i/a/Niagara_River_e7e9.html" title="Niagara River">Niagara River</a> to distract the British. Because Armstrong's orders were initially unclear, a brigade of regulars under Brigadier General <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winfield_Scott_03d8.html" title="Winfield Scott">Winfield Scott</a> proceeded to <a href="../../../b/u/f/Buffalo%2C_New_York_0d75.html" title="Buffalo, New York">Buffalo</a> on the Niagara.</p>
<p>It proved impossible for Brown to gain any cooperation from Commodore <a href="../../../i/s/a/Isaac_Chauncey_683c.html" title="Isaac Chauncey">Isaac Chauncey</a>—who was commanding the American naval squadron based at <a href="../../../s/a/c/Sackett%27s_Harbor%2C_New_York_7797.html" title="Sackett's Harbor, New York">Sackett's Harbor</a>—which was essential for any attack on Kingston. Chauncey was waiting for new ships to be completed and refused to make any move before the middle of July. Brown decided therefore to make the attack across the Niagara the main effort.</p>

<p>While waiting at Buffalo, Scott had instituted a major training programme. He drilled his troops ten hours every day, using the 1791 Manual of the <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_Revolutionary_Army_4f04.html" title="French Revolutionary Army">French Revolutionary Army</a>. (Prior to this, various American regiments had been using a variety of different manuals, making it difficult to manoevre any large American force).</p>
<p>Scott also purged his units of any remaining inefficient officers who had gained their appointments through political influence rather than experience or merit, and he insisted on proper camp discipline including sanitary arrangements. This reduced the wastage from <a href="../../../d/y/s/Dysentery.html" title="Dysentery">dysentery</a> and other enteric diseases which had been heavy in previous campaigns. Because insufficient regulation blue uniforms were available at Buffalo, he ordered 2,000 grey uniforms, normally issued to the militia.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Chippawa_302c.html" title="Edit section: Niagara campaign">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Niagara campaign</span></h3>
<p>On <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_3.html" title="July 3">July 3</a>, Brown's army (the regular brigades under Scott and <a href="../../../e/l/e/Eleazar_Wheelock_Ripley_d13e.html" title="Eleazar Wheelock Ripley">Eleazar Wheelock Ripley</a>) captured <a href="../../../c/a/p/Capture_of_Fort_Erie_8932.html" title="Capture of Fort Erie">Fort Erie</a>. After reinforcements of volunteers from the militia arrived under <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_B._Porter_5c23.html" title="Peter B. Porter">Peter B. Porter</a> on <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_4.html" title="July 4">July 4</a>, Scott began advancing north along the portage road alongside the Niagara River. A British covering force under Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Pearson was easily driven back before they could destroy any of the bridges or block the road with fallen trees.</p>
<p>Late in the day, Scott encountered British defences on the far bank of the Chippawa River, near the town of <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chippawa%2C_Ontario_018c.html" title="Chippawa, Ontario">Chippawa, Ontario</a>. After a brief exchange of artillery fire, Scott withdrew a few miles to Street's Creek. Here he planned to give his troops a belated <a href="../../../i/n/d/Independence_Day_%28United_States%29_0192.html" title="Independence Day (United States)">Fourth of July</a> parade the next day, while Brown manoeuvred other units to cross the Chippawa upstream.</p>
<p>Opposed to him was the Right Division of the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Army_7e21.html" title="British Army">British Army</a> in Canada, under Major General <a href="../../../p/h/i/Phineas_Riall_deec.html" title="Phineas Riall">Phineas Riall</a>. Riall believed that Scott's brigade were militia, and he also believed that Fort Erie was still holding out. He determined to cross the Chippawa River and mount an attack to drive the Americans back across the Niagara and relieve Fort Erie.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Chippawa_302c.html" title="Edit section: Battle">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Battle</span></h2>
<p>Early on <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_5.html" title="July 5">July 5</a>, British light infantry, militia and <a href="../../../n/a/t/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States_7838.html" title="Native Americans in the United States">Indians</a> crossed the Chippawa ahead of Riall's main body and began sniping at Scott's outposts from the woods to their west. (Some of them nearly captured Scott, who was having breakfast in a farmhouse). Brown ordered Porter's brigade (volunteers from the Pennsylvania militia, with some <a href="../../../i/r/o/Iroquois.html" title="Iroquois">Iroquois</a> warriors) to clear the woods. They did so, but they met Riall's advancing brigade and hastily retreated.</p>
<p>Scott was already advancing from Street's Creek. His artillery (Captain Nathaniel Towson's company, with three 12-pounder guns) deployed on the portage road and opened fire. Riall's own guns (two light 24-pounders and a 5.5 inch howitzer) attempted to reply, but Towson's guns destroyed an ammunition wagon and put most of the British guns out of action.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Scott's troops deployed into line with the 25th U.S. Infantry on the left near the woods, the 11th U.S. Infantry and 9th U.S. Infantry in the centre and the 22nd U.S. Infantry on the right with Towson's guns. At first, Riall was under the impression that the American line was comprised of grey-clad militia troops, whom the professional British soldiers held in much contempt. He expected the poorly trained soldiers to fall back in disarray after the first few volleys. As the American line continued to hold steady under British artillery fire, Riall realized his error and exclaimed his famous phrase "Those are regulars, by God!"</p>
<p>The British infantry, with the 1st Battalion of the <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Royal_Scots_9aa8.html" title="The Royal Scots">The Royal Scots</a> and the 100th Regiment leading and the 1st Battalion of the <a href="../../../8/t/h/8th_%28The_King%27s%29_Regiment_of_Foot_d307.html" title="8th (The King's) Regiment of Foot">8th (King's)</a> in reserve, were advancing very awkwardly and becoming bunched and disordered. This was because Riall had formed them into line for an advance over uneven ground with some very long grass instead of keeping them in column, in which they could have advanced more rapidly. Advancing in line meant that Riall's troops moved more slowly and were under fire from the American artillery for longer. The only advantage of using the line formation was that it increased firepower - yet Riall sacrificed even this advantafe by ordering his infantry to fire only one volley before closing with the bayonet. As the redcoats lumbered forward, their own artillery had to stop firing in order to avoid hitting them. Meanwhile, the American gunners switched from firing roundshot to firing canister - with lethal consequences for the British infantry. Once the opposing lines had closed to less than 100 yards apart, Scott advanced his wings, forming his brigade into a "U" shape. The well-drilled Americans executed flawlessly, allowing them to pour a devastating crossfire into Riall's advancing troops.</p>
<p>The Royal Scots and 100th suffered heavy casualties and broke as Scott launched a <a href="../../../b/a/y/Bayonet.html" title="Bayonet">bayonet</a> charge. The King's Regiment covered the retreat, taking only minor losses (2 men killed). Scott pursued but was halted short of the Chippawa by fire from three British 6-pounder guns which had been hastily brought forward, and other guns firing from the other side of the river. Nevertheless, with the help of Towson's storm of canister shot, 1,300 American infantry had broken an attack by 1,500 British.</p>
<p>Loss among British officers was especially heavy. The 100th Regiment, which held the center and was the last to break, was reduced to <i>"one Captain &amp; 3 subalterns doing duty, with 250 effective men"</i>. <sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> Nevertheless, 20th Century research by Canadian archivist Douglas Hendry has demonstrated that the British casualty return for Chippawa marked down many men as "killed" who had in fact been captured. Of 136 British regulars who were supposed to be killed, only 74 actually died. The actual British loss at Chippawa appears to have been 74 regulars, 18 Canadian Militiamen and 16 Indian warriors killed; 299 British regulars, 16 Canadian Militiamen and an unknown number of Indian warriors wounded; 75 British regulars wounded and captured by the Americans; 9 British regulars, 1 officer of the British Indian Department and 5 Indian warriors taken prisoner without being wounded. A further 9 British soldiers and 9 Canadian Militiamen appear to have deserted. A curious feature of the British casualty list is that the 1st Battalion, 1st (Royal Scots) Regiment was officially a Scottish unit: yet out of the 41 enlisted men of the battalion who were killed at Chippawa, 22 were Irish, 10 were English, 1 had "the Army" as his assigned nationality and only 8 were Scottish. Scotland had given so generously of its men in the Wars of the French Revolution (which had been going on since 1790) that it was running short of recruits by 1812.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Chippawa_302c.html" title="Edit section: Aftermath">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Aftermath</span></h2>
<p>Two days after the battle, Brown completed his intended manoevre and crossed the Chippawa upstream of Riall's defences, forcing the British back to <a href="../../../f/o/r/Fort_George%2C_Ontario_f667.html" title="Fort George, Ontario">Fort George</a>. It was not possible to attack this fortified British position because Commodore Chauncey was still failing to support the American army on the Niagara peninsula. No reinforcements or siege artillery could be brought to Brown's army.</p>
<p>At the same time, the British were able to rush reinforcements to the Niagara front and soon became too strong for Brown to risk a direct attack. Eventually, a series of feints and manoevres led to the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Lundy%27s_Lane_cd85.html" title="Battle of Lundy's Lane">Battle of Lundy's Lane</a> a few weeks later.</p>
<p>The battle, and the subsequent Battle of Lundy's Lane and <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Plattsburgh_f4ba.html" title="Battle of Plattsburgh">Battle of Plattsburgh</a>, proved that American regular units could hold their own against British regulars if properly trained and well led. The American army, modeled and drilled according to <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_Revolution_970a.html" title="French Revolution">French Revolutionary</a> standards, was becoming a respectable fighting force with new and capable leaders such as Jacob Brown and Winfield Scott who were to emerge from the war as national heroes.</p>
<p>Riall, although misled in several respects (on the improved standards of the U.S. Army, the size and composition of the force opposing him, and the time for which Fort Erie could be held), nevertheless made the same mistake as several French commanders of the period and assumed that a forceful rush by infantry could overwhelm a disciplined and well handled line. Compared with Scott (and indeed with most of his own subordinates), Riall had little recent experience of action, although he behaved with conspicuous bravery during the British retreat.</p>
