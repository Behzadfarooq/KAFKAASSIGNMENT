<p>Military casaulty figures are ridiculous! Serbian army used massive shelling to avoid casaulties and advanced slowly for the same reason. How did the Croatians manage such a devastating kill ratio? Both sides were highly engaged in propaganda and especially inflating enemy military fatalities. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 213.137.119.26 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_213.137.119.26_ed16.html" title="Special:Contributions/213.137.119.26">contribs</a>) 15:59, 11 September 2005.</small></p>
<p><br />
It is completely normal for attackers to lose more troops than defenders, specially in street combat, anybody who knows anything about warfare knows that. 8,000 Serbs killed in combat is a realistic assesment. If they were so succesful at avoiding casulties how come a GENERAL can get killed? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 83.139.82.249 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_83.139.82.249_44be.html" title="Special:Contributions/83.139.82.249">contribs</a>) 14:45, 9 November 2005.</small></p>
<p>As far as I know the general was killed by one of relatively few air strikes of makeshift Croatian Air Foorce (either a lucky hit or an example of good intelligance warfare). Yugoslav army was better equipped and more numerous. Croats could have claimd higher morale, but that is not enough to inflict such casaulties in face of YA advantages. What are your sources for the casaulties? Besides, there are numerous examples of attackers taking lighter casaulties than the defendants. A besieger has an advantage in initiative and supplies. See retaking of Hue during Vietnam War for instance - this is a fine example as armies had similar set of advantaes and disadvantages as in the case of Vukovar. - Anonymous <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 213.137.119.230 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_213.137.119.230_d8bf.html" title="Special:Contributions/213.137.119.230">contribs</a>) 01:32, 14 November 2005.</small></p>
<p>The article is somewhat misleading about the relative strength of the opposing sides. The JNA did indeed have somewhere around 50 thousand men around there, but they were not actively engaged in the battle. The guys storming Vukovar were not JNA, but various paramilitary units and volunteers. All the JNA did was shell the town from a distance. When the JNA finally decided to storm Vukovar itself, it fell very quickly. The figures given for tank losses and plane losses are false, although I don't have the reliable figures either. The figures given for JNA deaths may or may not be accurate, I don't know, although if the 8000 figure is true, only a very small portion of those would be JNA losses. The rest would be volunteers and other paramilitaries. One gets the impression from reading the article that the JNA was actively trying to take the town the entire time and was unable to and lost thousands of men and hundreds of tanks. I will try to fix some parts later if I can find some reliable figures about losses. And lastly, the article presents this battle as purely a Serbs vs Croats thing, when in fact the JNA was still a multi-ethnic force at this time. <a href="../../../e/d/r/User%7EEdrigu_1cf2.html" title="User:Edrigu">Edrigu</a> 16:28, 18 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
This isn't the truth, JNA storm Vukovar all the time, what are you talking about man? You wasn't there and you don't know. It's not 8'000 serbs killed-more then 15 000 and about 30 000 was injured. Croats had only easy weapons(riffles and stuff plus some anti-tank weapons. Vukovar was in compleat enclosed so three months in that kind of storm was only a victory. JNA wasnt a multi-etnic force.all generals,majors and most of lower ranks was Serbs and there was a very very small group of Croats in JNA. This is a big shame for you all, Why not talking about things that you didn't know: let start with this:in almost every Croatian village and smaler citys who was occupied- Serbs and JNA killed the civilians(women,children and most of the was old people),its classic etnic cleaning)What more should i say, i think that this is clear enough.</p>
<p>Croatians didn't attack the Serbia,but all the Serbian forces from all sides in Serbia was in Croatia and killied about 12 000 people-thats the main reason why Croatian forces won the war. With all their weapons JNA should defeat the Croatia in few days but they didnt cuz that wasnt their country,the main motive was on Croatian side,its much easier to defend your country from other cuz this is your place,your own home.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Cut the propaganda crap and learn some English - I barely understood a word you had written. This is supposed to be an Encyclopedia. And to support Edrigu`s claim that JNA was multiethnic at the time, see an archive in Encarta Encyclopedia 2003 (or newer) labeled "Current Macedonian problems" which, amoung other things says:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I have my own confusions about Macedonians. This is the Balkans, after all, <b>where chauvinism often passes for history</b> and facts are obscured in ethnic and religious murk. But I know how closely Macedonians identify with their church, so early in my four-week stay I drive into the hills north of Skopje with my guide, Elena Damjanoska, a cheerfully argumentative college student, to visit the monastery of Gorni Sveti Ilija.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The isolated monastery was built in the 12th century, when Macedonia was part of the Byzantine Empire, and it has survived Tito's communists as well as the Ottoman Turks, whose 500-year rule of the Balkan Peninsula ended only in 1913.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Its caretaker is Tome Bonevski, a retired machinist bent like a question mark from rheumatism. He gives us the key to the church and, later, as we sample wine and yogurt beneath a beech tree, shuffles over and unfolds himself onto a bench beside us. He wants to talk about his family.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>“Nine of them are in Sweden as guest workers,” he says, “but when war broke out, <b>my grandson came down from Sweden to do his duty in the Yugoslav Army. He ended up in Croatia, in Vukovar, where the worst fighting was. He shook for a month after we got him out of there</b>.”</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Besides, you claim to have been there? So you are an ex-JNA prisoner then? (if the city was indeed completely surrounded).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Croatia won pritty much more because of the international (mostly US and German) support. Weapons embargo was placed on both Croatia and FRY, but Croatia still purchased 25 mig 21-s by 1995, but FRY obtained nothing of the kind (and that`s just one example). Republic of Srpska Krajina was formally under protection of UN, but nobody tried to stop the operation "Storm", and it was even helped by some NATO air strikes (on Udbine airfield and other targets).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>By the way, why didn`t Croatia stop the Hungarians to conquer it in the middle ages if it is so easy to defend your own country?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>And finally, Serbs in Krajina had to defend themselves from the very same ethnic cleansing you blame on Serbs against Croats. This is untrue? Half a million Serbs had to flee Krajina, the place where they had lived for centuries, after operation "Storm". This looks more like a conquest then defending "your own country".</dd>

<p>hey guys, its true, the numbers he has written are simply insane. The JNA shelled the whole town and i cannot understand that they could still lose about 8000 soldiers?!Even if the croatians had an nuklear bomb, they couldn't have killed so much soldiers.Even if they tried to take the town by an assault, they could't lose so many soldiers.Besides, the JNA used Airstrikes to weaken the enemy. It's quite easy to understand why the autor wrote such nonsense:1. because he is an big nationalist 2. because of that, he has complexes that his country was attaked and taken by PARAMILTARIES ,and not by the JNA, the JNA was fighting in Bosnia,not in croatia, otherwise there would not be any croatia. Sorry about my bad english:(</p>
<p>PS:Croatia hadn't won the war, they simply forced the civilians to leave the region, there was no resistance. another thing....how could they have shot down 20 airplanes without having any antiairweapon?atrange, very strange...</p>
<dl>
<dd>Ok, I`m from Serbia, and to be fair they DID have AA weapons (they certainly damaged at least one J-22 Orao, probably with a "Stinger" missile, but the aircraft landed to a friendly airfield safely - the damaged tail section is in the Belgrade Aeronautical Museum. I don`t have Yugoslav air force losses (I do belive they did shoot down a few aircraft), but I know that there were huge overclaims on the part of Croatians (par example they and the muslims claimed that they had shot down 2 and later 4 Mig-29-s during the course of the war, but that was simply untrue - the 29s didnt have ANY losses during the wars before 1999). This 20 aircraft claim I certainly dispute.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Hey, they`re not alone in that: we calimed to had shot down 63 NATO aircraft during the bombing of Yugoslavia in 1999, but that was also untrue. Only two combat aircraft were proven downed and several more damaged. (I dunno, perhaps a few more that fell in the NATO-friendly neighbouring countries were concealed but I don`t think they would amount even to 15 let alone 63. The differance just seems to be that people here know the meaning of the word "propaganda" slightly better than those in Croatia. Oh well, the more you belive in dreams, the more you will be dissapointed when realitty strikes.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The casualties listed currently in the article are already the closest current estimates (Recent research in estimates for casualties in the wars in Croatia and Bosnia based on cooperation between Croatia, Bosnia, and Serbia produced new, lower estimates. The number of Serbs killed in Operation Storm was reduced from 1900 to under 600, the number of JNA and Serb forces killed in Vukovar was reduced from 14000-15000 to 6000-8000, and the number of people killed in Bosnia from 250,000 to 102,000). Reasons for why the JNA and Serb paramilitary casualties were much higher than the Croats' (There are many historical precedents for something like this as has already been noted above) include the JNA's Soviet-like invasion tactics vs. Croats' guerilla tactics, Croats already being entrenched, Croats being able to fall back and form a secondary defensive line faster than the JNA could push through the first one, Croats having enough anti-armor weapons to destroy a large number of tanks which accounts for many of the JNA casualties (see Heroji Trpinjske ceste in the fourth source), etc. As to how the Croats' could destroy over 20 aircraft, remember that the number includes helicopters (it's not that difficult to bring down helicopters as the war in Iraq has shown) and that the JNA jets flew low and slowly when attacking making them susceptible to AA fire and surface-to-air missiles (see the second source for an example), and that yes the Croats in Vukovar did have those kinds of weapons. So my point is, the numbers that are already on the Battle of Vukovar page are the closest ones available currently, and untill official figures are released they should remain unchanged, and that yes, it is possible to have a small army inflict a lot of casualties to a larger army. (BTW all these numbers include losses in Vukovar and the surrounding suburbs and areas like Borovo Naselje, which, although not really a part of Vukovar proper, are counted as being part of the Battle of Vukovar. This may explain why some people thought the numbers were too high). I heard the numbers 6-8000 on an episode of the Croatian TV program Otvoreno last summer, don't remember who said it, some military official or military historian, but read the first source on why there are no official numbers yet. As for where I got the information regarding Croat tactics and weapons information, I have VHS tapes and DVDs that include Vukovar veterans describing the situation during and after the battle (the videos below are just a fraction of what I have). Sorry, but it's kind of hard to post that stuff on Wikipedia for you all to see and hear. The VHS and DVDs are amateur footage so I can't provide references.

<p>One of examples of misuse of numbers by Croatian agitprop is number of missing. All together there are 1000 missing Croats in Croatia and less than 500 from Vukovar, but they put numbers over 1.000 only for Vukovar.--<a href="../../../k/h/a/User%7EKHasek_1cf1.html" title="User:KHasek">KHasek</a> 21:09, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>In Vukovar there is less than 500 missing(In all Vukovar-Srijem county there are 600 missing). That contradicts to "over 1000 missing" stated in article and therefore please dont be stubborn in defense of one-side propaganda.

<dd>Medule, are you sure you are familiar with the war in Croatia? Because you certainly don't sound like it. There WERE more than 1,000 missing people, but as more and more mass graves have been found and bodies identified over the past years, that number has been reduced to 500. So the old number was not wrong, but simply obsolete.

<p>OK somebody put that this was a pyrric victory for the Serbs, it was not, loosing only 5 to 10 percent of the attacking force is hardly pyrric, also somebody put 5,000 killed Serbs and 15,000 wounded, c'mon people how dum is that. They bombed the crap out of Vukovar and progresed in fases. It says that that is the croat figure. Then we showed maybe put the Serbian figure of Croat dead which is much larger than the "official" 900 or so killed.--<a href="../../../t/o/p/User%7ETop_Gun_a8ab.html" title="User:Top Gun">Top Gun</a> 19:40, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have returned the Croat ver of casualty figures and the pyrric victory term.
<ul>
<li>Top Gun, hat you have done is taken out the Croat figures leaving only the JNS (read here Serb) figures. That makes the article POV. Pls also read the earlier doscussion on this matter and you'll see that both figures are there for valid reasons, including the fact that the Vukovar casualty figures include outlying areas such as Borovo selo; attacker are generally more exposed &amp; thus suffer greater losses; because the advance was not multiple but single &amp; in phases, they were more prone to ambush; the guerilla warfare tactics employed by the cities defenders;</li>
<li>The victory was a pyrric because of a number of reasons - the losses suffered by the JNA was dramatic 7-15 percent. The campaign failed strategically - General Kadijevic expected them to roll through Eastern Slavonia easily, link up with the Banja Luka corpus in Western Slavonia, make a beeline for Zagreb and overthrow the government thereby able to dictate the western border of Serbia. Vukovar saw this objective fail and the high casualty count resulted in many desertions and conscript dodging in Serbia as well as protests by mothers whose sons had fallen on the front line in Eastern Slavonia.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>You will also notice that the article has had both items there for a while now. For this &amp; the reasons stated above, I respectfully request you refrain from unilateral changes to the article as it is currently NPOV.

<p>OK listen up again it is not pyric loosing 7-15 percent, what do you expect it was war if that was the case than a number of Allied victories in world war two should be pyrric and what is that stuff about Zagreb, the target was never Zagreb there was a standing agreement that Zagreb was not to be taken. The target was Vukvoar, and the Croat defenders there were defeted totaly, I actualy think the result should be Croat devastating defeat. Also where did you get that propaganda crap about desertions and conscript dodging in Serbia as well as protests by mothers whose sons had fallen on the front line in Eastern Slavonia. Maybe there was some desertion by some cowards but people did their duty and also do not talk about protests by mothers whose sons had fallen on the front line in Eastern Slavonia. That is pure propaganda by the Western powers and the Croats. There was no such thing. My father was killed fighting in Vukovar. And his mother did not protest against the war as well did not the other mothers. That would just tarnish their names and the thing they were fighting for. And all that you said is not NPOV. It's not NPOV to just put the Croat figures of Serbs killed then we should put also the Serb figures of Croats killed which is much larger than the Croat official 900 killed.<a href="../../../t/o/p/User%7ETop_Gun_a8ab.html" title="User:Top Gun">Top Gun</a> 22:03, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>First, let me extend condolences on the fact that you lost a parent in that war.</dd>
<dd>Having said that, I think my points are still valid. I have tried to included some sources which support my edits below:</dd>
<dd>With regard to phyrric victory:</dd>
<dd>From <a href="../../../p/y/r/Pyrrhic_victory.html" title="Pyrrhic victory">Pyrrhic victory</a>: <i>A Pyrrhic victory is a victory with devastating cost to the victor...the term is used...to describe any similar struggle which is ruinous for the victor.</i> I put to you that it was ruinous for the JNA's campaign in Croatia i.e. setting the boundary at the Virovitica, Karlovac Karlobag line. It was ruinous for the Serbs international reputation (and part of the reason they could not intervene in 1995), as well as devastating on the morale of the JNA with many generals being replaces, the JNA reformed into a VJ and SFRJ replaced by the Yugoslav Federation.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>On going to Zagreb, Veljko Kadijevic in <b>Moj vidjenje raspada</b> (1993) Kadijevic is quoted as saying that <i>...the strongest group of armoured mechanized forces to liberate eastern Slavonia and to continue towards Zagreb and Varazdin ...</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>With regard to the morale of the JNA and desertions:</dd>

The army had huge draft problems: an extremely low response and constant rebellions by reserves.

<dd><b>The Mother’s Protest-1991</b></dd>
<dd><i>During the summer of 1991, women concerned about their sons in the Federal Yugoslav Army organized protests against the war. At the beginning of the war all regular soldiers belonged to the Yugoslav National Army, whose responsibility was to stop moves for independence by Slovenia, Croatia and Bosnia. Croat mothers did not want their sons fighting with Serbs to prevent Croatia’s move for independence-which would put their sons on the "wrong" side of the war. Serb mothers did not want their sons fighting in Croatia, a land that they didn’t perceive belonged to them anymore. The women used their role as mothers to express concern for their sons and call for peace. The women stated their opposition to the war,</i></dd>
<dd><i>"We refuse that our sons become the victims of senseless militarists. It is not clear what are the goals for which we should sacrifice our sons. Our sons have been deceived: they have to participate in a war for which they are not the least bit responsible, in a war that has not even been declared. That they should give their lives for imperialist purposes is the project of politicians. It is a disgrace to win a fratricidal war" (Mothers of the Soldiers of Belgrade 20 July 1991, 8).</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>The first large protest against the war was held by several hundred parents, mostly mothers of conscripted men, in the Serbian National Assembly in Belgrade on 2 July 1991. In their statement they said, "The protests of mothers is a feminine spontaneous reaction to the disgrace of the civil war" (Mother’s Movement July 1991, 7). Repeatedly, throughout the summer, in letters to officials and public statements, the mothers called for an end to the war and a return of their sons.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Whilst the statements don't match with your anecdotal experience, they certainly are sourced and verifiable. FOr that reason, I am putting back in the term Phyrric Victory.</dd>
<dd>With regard to the figures, the JNA figures are unofficial so this is offset by equivalent figures from one of the leading Croat Generals of the time. Hence I have returned these figures. Again, I request you read the previous discussion by other users that debate this subject. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarinko_7cb2.html" title="User:Marinko">iruka</a> 06:31, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

About the numbers. One of the most popular videos on Croatian public television (HRT) was 1 minute long video with flight of two JNA ground attack aircrafts in the coastal area of Dalmatia, both beeing shoot down in short sequence. First one by light AA guns and second one missile by hand launched SAM, probably Strela 2M. One must know that all Croatian males were also conscripts before the war in JNA and because of better tehnical education than conscripts from (poorer) south-east parts of Yugoslavia (e.g. Kosovo) were often sent in army more technical demanding branches (navy, air force and air defence units had much larger average of Croats than other army branches) so these wepons were familiar to them. Both, Strela 2M and light 20 mm and 30 mm AA guns used by croatian AA defence in the war are all ex-SSSR origin and were often captured (latter in the war, after the fall of JNA barracks in Croatia in especially great numbers). Also weapons were smuggled into the country. It is no secret that Russian origin weaponery could be easily found in the black market after the fall of communism and economical and military desintegration in eastern Europe. The reason why I mentioned video is to prove that there are many solid proof evidence about JNA aircrafts beeing shoot down over Croatia. Although it is very common for numbers of enemy casualtys (or typs like MIG29)to be exaggerated in war, I found the number of 20 aircrafts shoot down quite realistic. There were no laser or TV( were several TV guided ones but because uf their scarcity they were used very rarley, just for high value targets. Moreover only case I know of is failed assasination of croatian president when his residance was bombed in surprise air raid) quided bombs in JNA arsenal at the time and because of street fights aircrafts had to adjust their attacks. By this I mean that they had to fly low, certanly in the range of any existing AA defence and also, to throw their bombs with adequate precision (to avoid hitting own troopw which were at close quaters combat) they had to slow down and pop up directly in front of the target to have clear view at it. This, also with small size of battlefield of several square km included, made their line of aproach very,very predictable. Also to avoid flying over enemy held teritory they most probably aproached directly from the east, from direction of Serbia. As some of the guys here I'm also Croat but I was just a kid at that time and of course was not there during the battle. Neverthless, if I was there, knowing something about air defence and holding portable SAM in my hands, I would have no difficultys to choose proper positon and send nice explosive postcard to any aircraft tail passing by...</p>
<p>About 8000 dead. I agree that they were many paramilitary forces with JNA, often poor led. But I do not understand how did so many tank and APC wrecks came to Vukovar streets on TV(and on west european ones). I understand that someone can arm paramilitary formation with light wepons or someone can have Ak-47 at home, but if they have column of T-54/55 tanks deployed than I would not imagine that it is paramilitary force. I would say that it is armoured formation, where crews are trained to properly run and use their vehicles and where all tanks are coordinated and every armoured vehicle has its place in battle formation, something that requiers months and months of training. By other words, it was normal army formation or JNA, not a slightest doubt about it. Was there really 8000 dead at JNA and paramilitary side it is hard to tell. JNA was equiped with ex-SSSR weapons and was organised in similar fashion as other SSSR army (of course on much smaller scale) and did employ more or less same tactic. More than 5 years after Vukovar battle Russian army had similar expiriance as JNA did when it tryed to enter Gorky. Several thousad dead and wounded and large quantity of armour lost only when they entered town directly with tanks and met mines and light but highly mobile groups of defenders (on ground familiar to them) armed with hand rocket launchers and submashine guns (btw. these wepons were also Russian origin).</p>
<p>Ha, Ha, Ha... Just love when people write nonesense... I mean lets face it people: The war is over, and thanks to no small part of the Western intervention the Croatian side managed to come slightly ahead, all things considered. But as far as Vukovar is concerned, it was a tough fought fight, and the Serbs did prevail. As far as the casualties, I bet that they are about equal on both sides when it comes to manpower loses... This whole deal about the Serbs losing 4-5 times as many soldiers and equipment is typical talk of a defeated side... Let it go, the war is over. This is a , a place to educate people on the embarassment that both the Serbs and Croats went through. Stop with the hatred and the lies already. Speak the truth for once.</p>
<p>This is correct. But, one must know that we learn from history and that facts must be rightly deduced so that the lessons learned would be valid. To someone in States or perhaps in GB or France this may look just like unrelevant conflict of some far away tribes but to us is our recent and very much alive history. And fight for liberation and our independance to. Also, I would like to sincerely thank international community for their help during 1995. which helped us to prevail and liberate occupaided parts of our country. It came only 5 years late. It is nice to feel good and to say "we stoped the war and genocide" to domestic public, isn't it? It ends stupid questions like why did West take 5 years of destruction in the country practicly between EU borders, hundreds of thousands deaths and over few milions of refugees to react? Why was embargo on weapons import placed on whole Yugoslavia theater when it was well know that the only party that had any hevy wepons was agresor JNA and JNA sponsored forces? Was that really in intrest of peace or just another Nuremberg ought to alowe stronger one to prevail? It seems that only the chosen ones have right to human rights and democracy. And this Western reaction, this help was so massive and decisive that it alowed for Srebrenica massacre to happen in Bosnia. Massive shootings of unarmed people in front of the Dutch soldiers eyes and under NATO full controled sky. Not to forget concentration camps. God saves us from your help next time. To go back local, the war is over more than 10 years ago, there is no place for hate now but just for reconciliaton. One who lives in this area sees that it allready happens on large scale, that people live normally together again, especially younger generations.</p>

<dd>Oh, I`m sure that if you were there armed with a Strela 2m this current 20 aircraft claim would have been truthful (but, then there would probably be 80 aircraft claimed), but fortenutely for JNA aircraft you were not, so prove to me that 20 were shot down. Where are the photos of wrecks of 20 aircraft? That movie about shooting down two aircraft in Dalmatia (They were either older Galebs or Jastrebs) I recall I saw some years ago, but if you filmed two downed over Dalmatia that doesn`t PROVE 20 over Vukovar. (this is supposed to be an encyclopedia so nobody here is interested about what somebody thinks is realistic, the one who states something should also prove it, othervise he provided nothing but a speculative information). <b>Croatian press is not a neutral source</b>. That unhcr source I searched looking for words "KIA", "killed", "casaulties", but saw none refering to JNA or Croatian army KIA. As the text is really too long for me to read, please quote the part concerning military casaulties.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>May I remind you that Croatian converted ex-crop dusters also flew some missions over Vukovar (probably killing the Serbian general) and, while a number has been shot down, quite a few survived (or at least that was my impression). So, if they could, why couldn`t JNA combat designed aircraft?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>JNA used mostly Soviet-style doctrine? Ok, but Croats did as well (soldiers of both combatants had trained in the same army)</dd>
</dl>
<p>First of all I am Croatian, some thigns that have been said here are not true. It is true that the JNA lost a lot of tanks and armored transports underastimating the capabilities of the defenders. . . The JNA did shell the city from a far, and most regulars were not included in the battle until the end, those who did fight were volonteres from JNA (armed by the JNA, trained by the JNA and wore uniforms of the JNA). . . JNA was the 5th stongest army in Europe before the war, but loses that were inflicted by the Vukovar defenders severly crippeld it. . . The city was sorrounded by the JNA from the east and south east but, and by serbian milita (again equiped by the JNA) from the other sides. . . there were corridors trough which the defenders got their supplies but for the last month of the siege they were completly cut off . . . And no Croatia did not use Soviet styl doctrine, some of our generals werent even proffesional soldiers, some were ex officers of JNA, but our best general was trained in the French Foregin Legion. . . I will not go in to the debate who did more crimes caus not enough time has passed since the war and the memorys of murders and shellings are still strong, both sides comitted crimes, every side had its reasons but a crime is a crime. . . And to say that the Croats didnt won the war, that they just had a slight advantage, well sorry but that just makes you, lets say, unfair... The operation storm is learned today on West Point as the best millitary operation in recent history... And you say that there wasnt any resistance? SO youre saying that Croatian soldiers died from what?... There was recently on HRT1 ( and brodcasted by the CNN) a documentary about the training of so called Republica Srpska Krajna Soldiers, and fortifying their borders so your statment about no resistance is false . . .</p>

<p>Sorry to write my note just here, but I would like to add my comment. So here it goes: How is that you (=Serbs and Croatians) fought a war not learning a single thing about tolerance? There are clear proofs of either Serbs and Croatians doing the same kind of crap (sorry to call it that way, but how would YOU call killing women, children, and old people?) so why do you not just try to be more tolerant and move on? You have some children yet? Or you will. DO you want another Vukovar for them?</p>

<p>The text of the article could have been taken from Tudjman era Croatian propaganda press. The consequence is that we either have to question its impartiality, or revalue the widely accepted view of Croatian wartime propaganda being nationalistic and biased. Some crucial pieces of information are obviously missing (particularly the plight of the city's inhabitants of Serbian nationality - about half of the total number - in the city subject to Croatian military rule, or the very existence thereof) parts of the text are clearly self-contradictory (the Croatian forces are claimed to be lightly armed, yet they still manage to down 20 warplanes) and full of dubious propaganda cliches (the backbone of JNA was broken at Vukovar). One does not need to be an expert on war in the Balkans to note these shortcomings. Naturally, this does not mean that we should subscribe to the Serbian propaganda of the time - an effort should be taken to compile a realistic picture from ICTY proceedings, from well known western reporters present at or near the scene (Misha Glenny), and from other sources. Actually, merely citing these sources will do a better service to the reader than this. Dervan 21:45, 20 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hm, starting a comment by exclaiming "Long live Arkans Tigers..!" immediately disqualifies a person as impartial. For the less-informed, Zeljko Raznjatovic Arkan was a notorious Serbian war-criminal and his "Tigers" were responsible for countless massacres of the civilian population during the war in Croatia, and later in Bosnia and Herzegovina. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarx1980_5fc3.html" title="User:Marx1980">Marx1980</a> 10:16, 11 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Exclamation "Long live Arkan's Tigers...!" was an act of foreign vandalism, which has nothing to do with the original text of the comment, as clearly evidenced in the page edit history. Removed. Dervan 17:29, 20 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This prelude to battle was full of Croatian side of story. I have added important facts about terror agains Serbs done during June and July 1991.

<dd>Belive me, I'm no nationalist, I'm just trying my darndest to keep some order and objectivity in these articles. I welcome the addition of those links, and am sorry they were deleted (accidentaly, I assure you). However, I don't belive the additions to the text of the "prelude to the battle" were written from a NPOV or in good faith. As valid as those journalist stories are, 3 articles, 2 of them from a Serbian POV do not represent the general consensus. And in view of the controversy surrounding this article I think we should tread lightly and not add anything that may start addittional rv wars. So let's just try and stick to that which we can all agree on, include the links in "external links" section and let readers decide for themselves. And please, lets keep a cool head and try to resolve this temporary partial freeze ASAP.

<dd>Ok, you agree with addition of links. But I added from Croatian and Serbian sources something that was really prelude to battle. Killing of 80 Serbs in Vukovar was prelude to battle. That event was mentioned in a letter not only to Tudjman but to all important political parties in Croatia. From neutral point of view it is important to mention all major crimes that could explain background of battle of Vukovar. Killing of 80 Serbs in Vukovar happened. Croatian (not only Serbian) sources support that fact. I Think you agree that is fact. It is important fact and should be mention, specially because numbers presented on that page are biased and only support that exist Croatian civilan victims.--<a href="../../../m/e/d/User%7EMedule_04ac.html" title="User:Medule">Medule</a> 15:39, 6 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's my opinion that, although Mercep harrasment and killing of Serbs is significant, putting it into the Prelude to Battle section makes it seem like pretext for Serb agression which is certainly not true. While these incidents may be true, it is also true that the pretext for the siege was the Croatian declaration of independance following the Plitvice incident. I suggest creating a new section somewhere further down entitled "Serb perspective" or something similar so those issues can be dealt with properly. Let's not forget that the title of the article is "Battle of Vukovar", and facts about the battle itself should be kept topmost. --<a href="../../../d/r/2E/User%7EDr.Gonzo_7efd.html" title="User:Dr.Gonzo">Dr.Gonzo</a> 21:49, 6 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Now when I have satisfied your criteria you tried to change only part that takes into account 80 dead Serb civilians inside Vukovar. That was really prelude to battle. Why to have "Prelude to Battle" section if we could not add such big crimes inside like killing of 80 Serbs inside Vukovar. By the way section with dead inside Vukovar is biased. You could not see dead Serb civilians.--<a href="../../../m/e/d/User%7EMedule_04ac.html" title="User:Medule">Medule</a> 23:09, 6 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agreed it should be added, now we have to agree how to best incorporate it into the article. As tragic as those deaths are, they do not belong in the "Prelude" section because that section is not concerned with civilian casualties but rather with the course of the battle. There is really no existing subsection where it can just be appended, so I think you should create a new subsection entitled "Serb casualties" or something like that and put it there. Don't put it at the top of the article though because it is confusing for readers, it can be interpreted as pretext for the Serb attack which is, I'm sure you'll agree not the historical truth. --<a href="../../../d/r/2E/User%7EDr.Gonzo_7efd.html" title="User:Dr.Gonzo">Dr.Gonzo</a> 23:27, 6 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Realy these events had been used as pretext for attack. I admit I have previously added sentence with explicit link to battle, but I agree not to insist on that. With several sentences will be implicit link to battle.

Let's include the Serbian civilian deaths in the "Overview" section, possibly even as a subsection, point out that they occured in the weeks before the actual battle began, mention it was partialy used as a pretext by Miloshevic propaganda machine, and if anything else needs to be added we can discuss further.

But if you do, I'll have to add some more background like the Plitvice incident, the declaration of independance and serbian reaction and point out that the deaths of those Serbs were used by Serbian propaganda to justify razing the town to the ground and killing or wounding another 20000 people and exiling at least twice that many. And then this article becomes even more controversial. Not to say it wouldn't all be true.

<dd>I hope you don't mind me barging in, Gonzo, but this guy is trying to trick you. He wants to include the names of Serbian cafes that were blown up. What a laugh. Then we should include every single building in Vukovar that was shelled by Serb forces. It's so absurd I won't event discuss it. Executions of 80 Serb civilians? And he justifies that "fact" with a newspaper article? It was never proven before a court of law, so it's pure gossip. Newspapers, and especially newspapers from the area of former Yugoslavia, are by no means a reliable source. Until you bring some real proof for the executions, Medule, you can forget about that. And EVEN if you find proof, it's still disputable whether it should be included, since the total civilian death count is around 1,000 (and the great majority of those civilians were NOT Serbs). --<a href="../../../z/m/a/User%7EZmaj_19ba.html" title="User:Zmaj">Zmaj</a> 07:48, 8 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>For Gonzo, I think you expanded quite satisfactory and neutral. Thank you. I will not change that part. Although I could tell you that "Croatia's secession from Yugoslavia, a possibility explicitly allowed by the new Yugoslav constitution of 1971" it is not correct. constitution is from 1974, and that constitution is contraversial. It had inside teritorial integrity of SFRJ what opposes right of nations for selfdetermination. But you see Serbs had been nation in Croatia until 22.12.1990, so Serbs had same right. Right for seldetermination is opposed to teritorial integrity of SFRJ. There are at least 2 facts that are again right of Croatia to make secession. --<a href="../../../m/e/d/User%7EMedule_04ac.html" title="User:Medule">Medule</a> 21:10, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The constitution can be argued, but the right to selfdetermination is definately there. Legal implications are something else entirely. You may consider it controversial, but that's your POV. What's important is that the Croatian secession was done lawfully, to the letter, YNA intervention was, on the other hand, illegal. I chose to omit that to avoid further controversy, and it is mentioned elswhere anyway. Let's just leave it at that and end this dispute already. --<a href="../../../d/r/2E/User%7EDr.Gonzo_7efd.html" title="User:Dr.Gonzo">Dr.Gonzo</a> 21:57, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I can't let Gonzo's version stay because of the reasons I stated in my last post.

<dd>What you need in that part of 80 killed and dissapeared Serbs to be acceptable to you. Look that part Gonzo has written, not me. Look how much time we spend to make compromise, but then you entered in story. You could not any more sell stories like "gossip". See again 3 proofs. If you say that that is not true, all numbers in that story of Vukovar are really only blatant propaganda.

The reason ? High military casualties figure speaks of Serbian military incompetence (as contrasted to their self-image of a Ramboid nation); also, it is a sign of heavy Yugoslav involvement in agression on Croatia. Anyone's national sensibilities aside-it is clear that <b>all realiable and available</b> sources put the Serbian military death toll at the lowest level of 8.000. <a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMir_Harven_99cb.html" title="User:Mir Harven">Mir Harven</a> 13:55, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>According to Serbian sources regarding the number of Serbian soldiers who died or went missing during all the wars in Slovenia, Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina, the number often mentioned is 2,300.<a href="http://www.bosnia.org.uk/news/news_body.cfm?newsid=2120" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bosnia.org.uk/news/news_body.cfm?newsid=2120" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>, and most of them, around a half, are believed to have died in the battle for Vukovar. The cited article states also that "most experts agree with the figure". There are no reason to put 8.000 or 10.000 as official data. These data are contraversial.--<a href="../../../m/e/d/User%7EMedule_04ac.html" title="User:Medule">Medule</a> 21:49, 12 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Croatian sources, ie. general Anton Tus, put the Serbian military casualties figure around 10.000. Other sources, like brigadier general Mile Dedaković, in his book "Bitka za Vukovar", put the highest limit around 12.000. Therefore, chief Croatian estimates revolve around 10 k Serbian military casualties. This page is not about what Serbian sources say-exclusively. Without going into details of questionable veracity of Serbian sources re this battle, the most correct approach is to state what both sides have to say. And, in the cited article by a journalist named Sikavica, it is clear for anyone who is not deaf, blind and mute that some Serbian military figures agree with general Tus's estimates. It is explicit. Therefore, reverted. <a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMir_Harven_99cb.html" title="User:Mir Harven">Mir Harven</a> 22:24, 12 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It's not just the number of Serbian military casualties (after all, these were mainly puzzled conscripts sent to the slaughterhouse).

<p>What a bunch of croat nonsense. These figures are completely bogus. In 1995 Dayton Accords, European inspectors verified all weapons stocks of both FRY and Republika Srpska so the exact numbers of tanks/planes/whatever are known. Comparing these figures with official JNA figures before the civil war reveals the exact amount of losses. About 30 M-84 tanks were lost from 1991 until 1995. A larger number of older T-55 tanks were lost but still not nearly 400. About 20 airplanes were shot down during the WHOLE 1991-95 war, this article claims they were all lost in Vukovar. Actually most plane losses occured in 1995 by which time the Croats had obtained more modern and higher-reaching anti-aircraft missiles. The figures this article gives for JNA losses in Vukovar are even higher than the combined losses of all serbian forces from Croatia, Bosnia, and even Allied Force. This is not subjective, because the exact losses can be calculated simply by comparing pre-war JNA data with what the inspectors found after Dayton, so there is nothing to argue about, no opinions, only facts. The figures given in this article are complete BS. Also, I would like to point out that all the sources provided for these figures are Croatian sources, and they're not exactly known for their credibility.

<dd>Dear Croat Aussie, seems you`re little late to do service for the "war of independance", but hey, better late than... Serbian estimates of losses were deleted as I see, and may I ask you, how do you expect anyone to take this article seriously when it shows so blatantly a Croatian point of view? Take a look at the very first comment in this discussion! It was not written by a Serb, but someone who is curious about the subject, but also experianced/educated enough to see differance between propaganda and a history article. Somebody keeps reverting a false claim that there are Serbian analysists that agree with Croatian estimates of Serbian casualties. And I could find nothing like that even in the very reference given for the claim. It quotes mostly Croatian general Anton Tus and the article is written by a Croatian! So the claim is a plain lie!</dd>

<p>I've decided to reboot this article. Although it was a good start, it had a number of major problems - particularly the near-total lack of sources (which is very unsatisfactory as far as <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a> and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> are concerned) and the distinctly POV tone of parts of it. From the point of view of a military historian, it was also rather unsatisfactory in explaining the tactics and political issues involved. And of course, it's not helpful that the article had become the subject of an edit war.</p>
<p>I've rewritten the article from scratch, incorporating elements from the previous version. It is <i>much</i> more heavily sourced than before, and it includes a lot more information than before.

<li>It ended with the defeat of the local <a href="../../../c/r/o/Croatian_National_Guard_4822.html" title="Croatian National Guard">Croatian National Guard</a>, the near-total destruction of Vukovar and the massacre or expulsion of its defenders and non-Serb population.

</ul>
<dl>
<dd>totally biased and factualy inaccurate. Not only non-Serbs left Vukovar. "Crucial turning point" and "phyrrhic victory" are POV and disputed. Number of killed is also inaccurate. A total of 2300 federal forces were killed in <b>all</b> operations in 1991, Slovenia etc. The figure of 1300 (or 1100, as it was quoted in article and by a leading military expert Miroslav Lazanski) for Novi Sad corps is actually for the federal army, as Novi Sad corps were responsible for that area. So, there are possibly some dead in TO (teritorial defense), but the estimates of Tus and non-Serbian sources are here taken to be reliable.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>civilians: there are both Serbs and Croats in Vukovar. Serbs have been massacred inside Vukovar. Why you count civilians on the Croatian side? You deny Croatian crimes. The fact that anti-Serbian propaganda menaged to whitewash the Serbian victims is not reason to be biased here.</li>

<li>At this stage in the Yugoslav conflict, the objectives of Milošević and the JNA were somewhat different. Milošević sought to support the efforts of the rebel Serb communities to secede from an independent Croatia and associate with a Serb-dominated Yugoslavia. The JNA leadership also supported the Serb rebellion but went further, aiming to decisively cripple or overthrow the new Croatian state. According to its former head, <a href="../../../v/e/l/Veljko_Kadijevi%C4%87_2b6f.html" title="Veljko Kadijević">Veljko Kadijević</a>, it planned to advance deep into Croatia, capture the capital <a href="../../../z/a/g/Zagreb.html" title="Zagreb">Zagreb</a> and destroy its armed forces. Having done this, the new Yugoslavia could dictate its western borders, leaving Croatia as a rump state shorn of much of its territory. A key element in this plan was the use of heavy armored forces to capture the Serb-populated region of <a href="../../../e/a/s/Eastern_Slavonia_e9da.html" title="Eastern Slavonia">Eastern Slavonia</a>, and then to advance west from there to Zagreb. <sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>this paragraph is totally POV. It seems to be taken from Kadijevic, but that is his POV. Milosevic strictly <i>never</i> claimed to have wanted Serbs to secede. That is pure propaganda.

<dd>Kadijevic's statement of the JNA's battle plans closely matches what actually happened on the ground, so I think we can take it as accurate.

<dd>Only up to a point. Blocking a user to gain an advantage in an editing dispute is forbidden, obviously, but I'm talking here about strictly enforcing Wikipedia's fundamental policies. I'm not a Croat or a Serb, so I don't mind if someone adds a statement that Franjo Tudjman ate babies or that Milosevic was an alien from Alpha Centauri - but they must provide a reliable verifiable source for that statement. If they do, fine - if they don't, their addition comes out. If they <i>repeatedly</i> ignore the fundamental policies then I'll encourage them to change their behaviour. Think of it as being like toilet training. :-) -- <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisO_f9d7.html" title="User:ChrisO">ChrisO</a> 00:27, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>December 1990. Serbs are begining to disapeare from the VU police, threatening phone calls are everyday thing. In early 1991 Vupik is setteled with Croats from Hercegovina.</p>
<p>- 1991 - summer Couple of croats entered Borovo Selo and killed the guy patroling in front of the City Hall. Immediatly they were killed wich was the call for 2 busses full of Zengas to attack Borovo Selo. However, most of those guys were killed in Borovo. During 1991 my grandfather a serb was beaten by Croats and forced to sing Ustaske songs. Thanks to his croat friend he manages to escape from Vukovar.</p>
<p>Once freed or occupied by JNA - many croats died, young guys in their 20's.</p>

<p>'<b>Casualties</b> The exact numbers of casualties at Vukovar is still unknown. According to Croatian general Anton Tus, about 1,100 of Vukovar's defenders were killed, and another 2,600 defenders and civilians were listed as missing. Another 1,000 Croatian soldiers were killed on the approaches to Vinkovci and Osijek. The intensity of the fighting can be judged by the fact that the losses in Eastern Slavonia between September-November 1991 constituted half of all Croatian war casualties during the whole of 1991.[8] The Central Intelligence Agency estimates Croatian casualties at around 4,000-5,000 dead across Eastern Slavonia.[5]</p>
<p>Estimates of JNA losses are complicated by a lack of official figures. The only published losses on the JNA side were some 1,300 dead in the Novi Sad corps alone. Tus cites foreign estimates of 6,000-8,000 JNA and Serb losses in the whole of eastern Slavonia and Croatian estimates of at least 5,000 dead. Around 600 armoured vehicles and heavy weapons and more than 20 aircraft were also destroyed.'</p>
<p>The Casualties in the box are presented in a very biased way (and the estimates are also ill-sourced): Croatian ones are ONLY FROM THE BESIEGED CITY while JNA casualties are FROM THE WHOLE EASTERN SLAVONIA. The very article contradicts itself.</p>

<p>Figures of "5-8" thousands killed are impossible in a modern war and such disproportion of men and firepower, it would be a success if they killed several hundred. Compare even with civilian casualties (after destruction of the city - 1,000-2,000 dead, including these murdered later). Also most of the time JNA was just firing artillery into the city, then paramilitaries broke through defences and surrendered Croats in a pockets. There was some disastrous initial storming by armor, including the famous destruction of an armored column (which is even included on the article's featured photo), but it's just not enough. For a simple comparision, Russians lost about 2,000 men killed in the New Year's Eve assault on Grozny, and I think this would be hard to beat. Another: Serbs lost 24,000 military dead in whole Bosnian War, 1992-95 - only 3 times more than in one Croatian city, defended by up to 2,000? Another still: Serbs say they lost less than 5,000 in the <b>whole war</b> in Croatia, and this even <b>including civilians</b>. My guess is, maybe, for example, someone in a Croatian propaganda office added one zero to their estimates of a Yugo losses. --<a href="../../../h/a/n/User%7EHanzoHattori_3996.html" title="User:HanzoHattori">HanzoHattori</a> 09:35, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>"Croatian propaganda office"? You've seen one too many James Bond movie. The fact is - Serbs never released their official estimates, unlike Croats whose estimates come from the highest military sources.

<p>Finally, (at this moment) the article looks pretty much OK. I just propose removing the "Klacemo Hrvate" quote, as such slogans were common on both sides at the time so focusing on just one adds a POV, but otherwise it seems all right.</p>
<p>Veljko Stevanovich 9. Sep. 2006. 16:45 UTC+1</p>
<p>I'm glad everything looks OK, but I have to disagree about the quote. Maybe such slogans were common on both side; I don't know, since I wasn't in Vukovar. -But the quote is relevant, if for no reason other than the fact that is was widely seen by "westerners" on BBC. I also think that it is relevant in that it is symptomatic of the JNA's general attitude about the war; they thought that it would be an easy victory, with few casualties. It is also especially damning in light of what happened at Ovčara. For these reasons, I think it should stay. <a href="../../../m/i/h/User%7EMihovil_1a43.html" title="User:Mihovil">Mihovil</a> 01:05, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>There are many problems with the casualties section, i have just noticed. But the Battlebox itself is a little bit out of context.</p>
<p>a)The overall JNA Official Casualties of the War of Croatioan Independece are lower that the casualties sustained only at Yukovar.</p>
<p><br />
b)The article is using as a reference, 2 Croatian estimates, to get the conclusion of a Serb/Yugoslav Phyrric Victory,(Same problem of Battle of Crete).Estimations are no realliable sources, only for the estimator, croatian POV.</p>
<p>c)The number of JNA (Regulars and Para) casualties that engaged in the zone are the same number of the casualties sutained by the serbs at Yukovar.(Extrange).While Croatians casualties sustained in the same zone are bigger than yukovar itself.</p>
<p>I strongly recomend to change the battlebox just to JNA Victory because the JNA army, not the serb paras, took the city. Try to add official casualties from each side to the battlebox, to avoid estimates and possible assumpsions of Croatian POV in the article. Is much more better to keep the battlebox clean and add all the estimated and effects to the aftermath of the trivia section.</p>

<dd>The JNA at that time was significantly Serbianised. Approx. 70% of the officer corp was Serb as was the majority of the field troops.</dd>
<dd>The JNA was fighting for Serb national goals (redrawing borders to include all Serbs in one state i.e. a <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greater_Serbia_0728.html" title="Greater Serbia">Greater Serbia</a>, when the JNA should have been protecting all national identities and the integrity of the federalised structure of the country. But how could it, given the Serbian character of the army.</dd>
<dd>The Serb paramilitary units such as the Chetniks and white eagles took the city in conjunction with mechanized divisions and other infantry. The biggest problem the JNA had was finding men that were willing to provide infantry support for the "cavalry". This was the role played by the Serb paras in addition to "cleaning up" resistance.
<dl>
<dd>The support for a phyrric victory not only comes from the casualty statistics, but more importantly, the impact the resistance had on the original goals of the general staff headed by General Veljko Kadijevic, the impact on manpower from Serbia, and the protests by mothers of conscripts.</dd>

<p>The article reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tus cites foreign estimates of 6,000-8,000 JNA and Serb losses <b>in the whole of Eastern Slavonia</b>. Tus himself estimated enemy losses <b>in the region</b> in the order of 10,000 dead; the destruction of 600 tanks, armoured vehicles and heavy weapons, and 23 aircraft.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You write:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Unofficial Croatian figures: 5000 dead, 15,000 wounded, 600 armoured vehicles, 25 aircraft</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At the same time, you leave only official Croatian losses <b>INSIDE</b> Vukovar (while Tus himself says they lost another 1,000 in the area, making this at least 2,000 killed, another Croat says more like 2,500, and foreign estimates are ranging 4,000-5,000). But no, with you it's still 921.</p>
<dl>
<dd>See below for citation - they refer to the siege of Vukovar i.e. the same definitional criteria applies. More than happy for you to provide these accounts in the body of the article (with sources). The problem with the Serb losses is that the figures are unofficial so it is natural to put a couple different figures to reflect the ambiguity of the matter. W.r.t to the Croatian casualties, the government has completed a study (needed for the ICTY, veteran services &amp; war reparation cases before the ICJ) &amp; provided official figures. If these are doubted, then pls reference &amp; cover in the body of the article with sources. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarinko_7cb2.html" title="User:Marinko">iruka</a> 05:16, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Tus stated that the backbone of the Yugoslav army was broken in Vukovar, since during the three months of war it lost 10,000 soldiers, 600 armored vehicles and 23 airplanes.</p>

<dd>An unequivacal reference to the siege of Vukovar &amp; associated casualties - no mention of Eastern Slavonia.</dd>

<p>No, it's mention of "the three months of war". The <a href="../../../c/r/o/Croatian_War_of_Independence_39e8.html" title="Croatian War of Independence">Croatian War of Independence</a> is &lt; there (don't forget to check the war box on figures). Also, he says "10,000 killed and 25 planes", not "5,000 killed and 23 planes". Come on. Or maybe he changed his estimate? 5,000, 10,000... what a difference? --<a href="../../../h/a/n/User%7EHanzoHattori_3996.html" title="User:HanzoHattori">HanzoHattori</a> 11:18, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Oh, and also: according to the BBC (The death of Yugoslavia), 15,000 died in the war until the peacekeepers arrived. Are you trying to tell me out of all these people, including Croatian soldiers everywhere, all civilians, the Serb soldiers elsewhere, 2/3 were Serbs in Vukovar? Please. Serb losses from the Bosnia's 3-years-long slaughter were 14,000 soldiers (Muslim and Croat 34,000). --<a href="../../../h/a/n/User%7EHanzoHattori_3996.html" title="User:HanzoHattori">HanzoHattori</a> 16:59, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Maybe, maybe not. Vukovar had some of the biggest losses for both sides. That's why the figures are labelled unofficial &amp; we include both. Where did the BBC documentary cite it's figures from? I think citing a Croatian chief of staff @ the coalface is more reliable because it references the specific battlefield. Hence returned the figures to the battlebox. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarinko_7cb2.html" title="User:Marinko">iruka</a> 06:40, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Go and see the figures <a href="../../../c/r/o/Croatian_War_of_Independence_39e8.html" title="Croatian War of Independence">for the whole war</a>. More dead in 2 months, in one city, than in the whole conflict, these 2 months included - a paradox? Bosnia too, <a href="../../../w/a/r/War_in_Bosnia_and_Herzegovina_edc0.html#Casualties" title="War in Bosnia and Herzegovina">14,000 in about 44 months</a>. Just apply some plain logic. Also, you should understand the war is not like in old Yugoslavian partisan movies, where after a firefight only few of one side are left standing and the other side are all dead. The most important factor here in "breaking the offensive" was the effect on the Yugoslavian morale, or so the article says. --<a href="../../../h/a/n/User%7EHanzoHattori_3996.html" title="User:HanzoHattori">HanzoHattori</a> 02:32, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
