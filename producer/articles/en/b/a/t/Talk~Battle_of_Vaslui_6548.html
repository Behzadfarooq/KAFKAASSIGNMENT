<p>What exactly does merging mean, as in this case? And what exactly could we merge? I mean, the [Battle of Vaslui]] is a somehow complete Encylopedia article, while the other article is a stub. The little info that you find in the stub, you can find in the article.</p>
<p>I think the name "Battle of Vaslui" is a better choice for Wikipedia in English. I mean, if someone reads the title "Podul Inalt", what would it tell them? Not much. They would be as confused as the Turks in that fog...</p>
<p>A redirection from the Podul Inalt-article to the Battle of Vaslui-article, would be good. <small>—<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> <a href="../../../a/n/i/User%7EAnittas_0872.html" title="User:Anittas">Anittas</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/i/User_talk%7EAnittas_d652.html" title="User talk:Anittas">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Anittas_6f15.html" title="Special:Contributions/Anittas">contribs</a>) 04:19, 13 September 2005 (UTC).</small></p>

<p>You persist on using the other two version of the names; so far, you have used:</p>
<p>1. Suleiman; and 2. Sulejman</p>
<p>Both of these personas lived in the 19th century, respectively, 17th century. Your anachronistic sources could mislead people. The Suleyman that we are talking about, in this article, lived in the 15th century. Do you understand the difference between the 15th-, 17th-, and 19th century?</p>
<p>I admit that they might have shared the exact, similar name, and I could speculate that scholars made a distinguishment in their spelling in order to not cause confusion on who is who; and as you can see from the articles that I've posted, they usually use my version of the name, namely with the letter 'Y'.</p>
<p>Another version of the name is Soliman. Either way, at least I have something to back up my claims with - I have the articles that I have posted - and you could argue that they cannot be taken in consideration, but if you do that, I expect you to present your case on why we shouldn't use Suleyman, and why we should use your version, instead. I mean, really: I don't care how we spell his name, so long we get the message across. But don't you agree that it's silly to link this persona to different personas that lived many centuries after the initial death of the first one?</p>

<dd>I have no particular interest in the Battle of Vaslui (which I had never heard of) or in this mysterious general (whom I had never heard of either). My only interest in the article was because of some English which needed to be tidied. I'd like to move on now, and take this Battle of Vaslui off my watchlist.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I think the problem is that there is no article for <a href="../../../s/u/l/Suleyman_Pasha_caad.html" title="Suleyman Pasha">Suleyman Pasha</a>; the link is currently a dead one. According to Wikipedia, which of course is not infallible, the Battle of Vaslui took place in 1475, <a href="../../../s/u/l/Sulejman_Pasha_e80a.html" title="Sulejman Pasha">Sulejman Pasha</a> was around in 1614, and <a href="../../../s/u/l/Suleiman_Pasha_597a.html" title="Suleiman Pasha">Suleiman Pasha</a> was around in 1877.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I suppose the solution is to agree on a spelling – I don't suppose there is a "correct" version of the spelling – and then either to create an article for this Suleyman, or simply to leave it unlinked. Ann Heneghan <sup>(talk)</sup> 22:43, 18 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Ann, I got no issues with you. I was replying to your good friend, Mr. Oxford. Of course you have no interest in the subject of this article - neither does he. He's here to break me down, bit by bit. Either way, if he's the philosopher that he claims to be, then he'll be playing by the 'rules' and he will present his case on why we should use his version of the name.</p>
<p>I already presented mine by showing that the popularity of my version is used a lot more, than his version of the name. In fact, I've never seen his version of the name being used anywhere. What is he basing it on? I will now await his reply. --<a href="../../../a/n/i/User%7EAnittas_0872.html" title="User:Anittas">Anittas</a> 22:58, 18 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Leaving aside Anittas' customary aggression and melodramatics, the point is that "Suleyman" is a somewhat old-fashioned transliteration, the usual modern preference being "Suleiman" (I didn't use "Sulejman" in the article; I mistakenly linked to it). I've asked for a citation for Anittas' version, and he's declined to produce one (except for other articles that he's written). If he were an editor who had shown himself to be careful, knowledgeable, and trustworthy in the past, I'd probably give him the befit of the doubt, but he has consistently been none of those things, and I'm disinclined to switch from the normal modern form on his say so. --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 10:05, 19 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I didn't tell you to check my article that you have successfully managed to terrorize into pieces; I told you to check the articles that I've used as references. Scroll down and see the links. I ask you for your citation. My back up are in those references. And you justify your abuse by reverting the article by saying that Suleyman is an old fashioned style of transliteration? First of all, even if it were old fashioned, it would still be good. Secondly, prove to me that it's old fashioned and that your version is more acceptable.</p>
<p>Before you ask someone else to prove his case, you should be able to prove yours - and so far, you haven't done that. You're not even knowledgeable in this subject.

<li>Süleyman is the current Turkish spelling, not an "old-fashioned" spelling, like Mel claims. There was a president of Turkey named <a href="../../../s/%C3%BC/l/S%C3%BCleyman_Demirel_4011.html" title="Süleyman Demirel">Süleyman Demirel</a>.</li>

<p>Saying that the Ottomans wanted to "turn the Black Sea into a Turkish lake", sounds pretty clear to me. The term has been used in similar contexts, such as when saying that the Mediterranean was a "Roman Lake" (Mare Nostrum).</p>

<dd>It's generally best to avoid flowery language in favour of straightforward, plain English; aside from anything else, we can't assume that everyone will be familiar with the cognate uses. Incidentally, thought the English phrase has been used, doesn't "Mare Nostrum" just mean "our sea"? --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 09:37, 1 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Yes, "Mare Nostrum" means "our sea", but in English, they seem to say the "Roman Lake"; probably because people wouldn't know what "our sea" would refer to. It's all cool. --<a href="../../../a/n/i/User%7EAnittas_0872.html" title="User:Anittas">Anittas</a> 18:12, 1 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Suluyman Pasha was a great warrior, but unlucky (may Allah be merciful to him), and dust from his feet was swept away from history in Turkey. So I understand it is difficult now to find out detais about him. The first external link says he was "<a href="../../../b/e/y/Beylerbey.html" title="Beylerbey">Beylerbey</a> of <a href="../../../r/u/m/Rumelia.html" title="Rumelia">Rumelia</a>", and I corrected the article accordingly. But Anittas reverted this pointing out that this wikipedia's article says they were two different persons.</p>

<p>Suleyman, as far as I know, was the general who was preoccupied with the siege in Albania, and Beylesbey of Rumelia was the governer of Rumelia. Two different people, no? Stefan was victorious in 24 of his 36 battles against the Turks, so it couldn't all have been badluck for you. --<a href="../../../a/n/i/User%7EAnittas_0872.html" title="User:Anittas">Anittas</a> 22:35, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Allah will give you more wisdom in due time, meanwhile other may think over a possibility that beylerbeys were great warriors (I trust you don't think that "Beylerbey" is a personal name). For example, Jegen Pasha fought even against Sultan himself. So I see no reason why a beylerbey could not besiege Scutari. Please be advised that "<a href="../../../b/e/y/Beylerbey.html" title="Beylerbey">beylerbey</a> ("<a href="../../../b/e/y/Bey.html" title="Bey">bey</a> of beys") of <a href="../../../r/u/m/Rumelia.html" title="Rumelia">Rumelia</a>" was a governor of the <b>whole</b> European part of the Ottoman Empire, and I find it very improbable that in such a great battle some "general" was superior in command to the beylerbey.</dd>

<p>When I read articles about the battle, I read that Suleyman joined the Beylesbey of Rumelia in Sofia and advanced towards Moldavia. Perhaps I misread, or perhaps they were wrong.

<dd>Thank you for an explanation. I never said that a wikipedian invented this. All I am saying is that two texts say different things. My own attempts to figure it out failed.

<dd>Quite honestly, I don't think they deserve their own article for the simple fact that our military tradition was not as rich as those of other empires (compare to Byzantine or Western Europe). Calarasi were just a light cavalry as any other light cavalry. I don't see them as a unique unit, but if you persist, you can wikify calarasi and Viteji, etc., however, I don't think much is known about these units. I read that the Moldavian archer cavalry learned Tatar tactics of making hit-and-run attacks and they did great when they fought the Teotonic knights in Poland and in Moldavia, but I'm not sure which of these units used these tactics. There are no articles on this subject and I don't think any articles will be started on this subject.

<dd>No, not every name and place must have an article. Just look at how Jimbo deleted my article about Jeremy Rosenfeld two times, yet that guy is mentioned in several articles. Tepelus could have his own article, but not even he did a big deal. Other encyclopedias mention names and places without giving them their own articles; take EB for example: they mention Henri Coanda in an article about fluids, but they don't have an article about him. Those settlements were probably some village that existed back then, which now no-one cares about. I don't know it my self. What could we write in an article about them, except the fact that a battle occurred near their location? I'm not going to write an article about every tree, village, and puddle from Moldavia, as you guys do to that city you call Bucharest. Yes, the Moldavian monastaries deserve their own article.

<dd>Amazing not to have an article about Coandă. Not that our article on him is a prize article, but that just shows that <i>Britannica</i> has holes. It is generally Wikipedia's policy that any city, town, or village, past or present, is a legitimate topic; within cities, we often get down to neighborhoods. Hence, the red link serves as an appropriate reminder of an unwritten article. I'm not going to fight it out further: just remarking that probably that is the right way to go if you want the article featured.</dd>
<dd>I don't get why you feel that the Bucharesters should get out to Moldavia and take photos. Why not take them yourself, or try to recruit people who live near there to do so?

<p><a href="../../../a/n/i/User%7EAnittas_0872.html" title="User:Anittas">Anittas</a>, you asked for my assessment in terms of possible FA.</p>
<ol>
<li>It's a good article (and, indeed, I just stuck {{<a href="../../../g/a/_/Template%7EGA_c78b.html" title="Template:GA">GA</a>}} on it, which I'm pretty sure will remain).</li>
<li>There is is a bit of a POV from the Moldavian / Romanian / Christian side. That will not probably be easy to fix. I've seen (and participated in) articles that are worse in this respect (consider the very title of <a href="../../../d/i/s/Disaster_of_Annual_1d18.html" title="Disaster of Annual">Disaster of Annual</a>: no Morrocan calls it that! To them, it was a victory!), but if you are going for FA, then this becomes an issue. There is nothing that needs toning down, but you (or someone) will need to find and add more material on what the Turks and their allies were doing and thinking, on what <i>their</i> correspondence was, on how this fits the arc of <i>their</i> history.</li>
<li>The citation style (how each work is mentioned) in the footnotes is a bit non-standard (you might look at <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources">Wikipedia:Citing sources</a>, and the list of references could use more on publishers, dates, etc., to make it clear what editions were used and when things were originally published. I see that when this was a FAC before, people really hammered on the references; I gather it's come a long way. I'd be interested to know if someone else would feel that any specific statements that lack citations require them. Nothing leapt out at me, though I may take another look. Offhand, I would not consider the current state of this objectionable, but I suspect others would.</li>
<li>Up above, where you say "I don't like to link to non-existing articles. The red link makes it look ugly." This is your prerogative, but it's not the way to get the article featured. One solution is to write at least solid stubs for the four or five topics involved. Half a dozen or fewer red links, most of them to moderately obscure geographic locations, won't stop the article from being featured. Adamantly refusing to link what should be linked will.</li>
<li>Other than that: my knowledge of the time and place is not vast, but, from what I know, this seems to cover the bases. Other than the three points above, and the few ambiguities we haven't yet addressed, I don't see any active objections to it being a featured article. I'm not sure whhether I'd actively support it (I've only actively supported about 15 articles for FA status in my roughly 2-1/2 years here), but if those issues are addressed, and assuming that there are no glaring omissions that an expert would be aware of but I am not, I can't see any other active objections to FA status.</li>
<li>As for what it would take to get my active support: probably adding a section contextualizing how this fits into the sweep of history for the region and for the various empires and states concerned. - <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 03:11, 24 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Well, most sources speak of the Moldavians and not so much about the Turks. The Turks are mentioned in the next battle, in 1476, when the Poles sent an envoy, etc. I will try and see if I can fish for more info on the Turks, but it's hard. All their souces on this battle are like, "the evil infidel won."</dd>

<p>Yes, they did hammer me for the sources and references. I don't know when some of those other references have been published. I've tried to find out, but so far, no luck. I've asked the Turks, but most Turks know little about their own history. I've answered point number 4 above this subject. I'm waiting for another book to arrive by April 5 and I hope to find more info there.

<p>A very good article; I believe I already made that comment at one point&#160;;-) Unfortunately, it's somewhat too narrow a topic for the very small 0.5 release; I've moved it to the <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVersion_0.5_Nomination_Held_nominations_9d48.html" title="Wikipedia:Version 0.5 Nomination/Held nominations">held nominations page</a>, where it will be considered for inclusion in one of the later releases. <a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirill_Lokshin_7618.html" title="User:Kirill Lokshin">Kirill Lokshin</a> 16:29, 27 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't know what 0.5 is, or how it affects this article, but this article still awaits another update that will fix some problems. The <a href="../../../n/i/g/Night_Attack_9f94.html" title="Night Attack">Night Attack</a> was written in order to cover the background section of this article. The two conflicts relate to each other, as does <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Baia_4875.html" title="Battle of Baia">Battle of Baia</a>, but unfortunatelly, the article doesn't make that very clear. I don't have a lot of time on my hands, now, but before Baia and another article is rewritten, this article will still await the update. When everything will be finished, it will look better, but I'm not sure if it's going to be FA worthy (if we consider the highest standard). However, it doesn't really have to be FA. --<a href="../../../a/n/i/User%7EAnittas_0872.html" title="User:Anittas">Candide, or Optimism</a> 17:42, 27 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"The battle lasted for four days where the fleeing Ottoman army was pursued by the Moldavian light cavalry and the 2,000-strong Polish cavalry for three days until they reached the town of Obluciţa (now Isaccea, Romania), in Dobruja." Is that seven days in all, or what?

<dd>Yes, I'm aware of that and I was intending to fix it. Iorga says 3 days; the doc says 4 days. I'll fix it l8r. --<a href="../../../a/n/i/User%7EAnittas_0872.html" title="User:Anittas">Thus Spake Anittas</a> 13:30, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
