<p>Please remove the disinformation about the BUF believing in the "Protocols". Mosley firmly discouraged all forms of conspiracism; his motivation for opposing certain Jewish elements within British society was quite clear: he and his party members didn't want England to engage herself in another war perceived as suicidal, and most Jews, of course, sympathized with their mistreated kin in Germany and were actively pushing for engagement. I don't see how this makes Mosley some irrational monster of prejudice.</p>

<p>I've removed the following sentence which is not substantiated:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>The B.U.F. regarded the march as a show of strength, and insisted on proceeding in spite of widespread opposition.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>The <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Union_of_Fascists_7578.html" title="British Union of Fascists">British Union of Fascists</a> article states that the party had considerable support in the East End. Marches were used as a means of increasing support, attracting certain types of people who found the structured and discipled organisation, with its military-type hierachy, appealling, particularly given the quite poverty-striken and chaotic life in this area of London; that was the point of them. No reason is given how the BUF thought it would benefit from a 'show of strength', and the original (copyright-violated) text gave the impression that the party over-estimated its support in the area ("<i>The battle of Cable Street showed Mosley and his blackshirts that their political beliefs were generally opposed in that area of London</i>"), which doesn't sound like <i>proceeding in spite of widespread opposition</i>, which implies that the extent of this opposition was fully appreciated beforehand. All in all, this seems a POV comment, which at least needs more explanation and sources. <a href="../../../8/0/2E/User%7E80.255.html" title="User:80.255">80.255</a></p>

<p>I'm tempted to change the current page as it gives the impression that the Blackshirts were always going to try to march along Cable Street, which is not the case. It was the police who wished to divert the march along this street. Also this was NOT a jewish area i.e. the jews were a majority. Del Trotter</p>

<p>Added 'London History template', standardised the citation and 'rich linked' the text. Hopefully nothing contentious. I heard that the mural had been under threat - due to a change of use of the old library, but it appears to have been protected for the foreseeable future. <a href="../../../k/b/t/User%7EKbthompson_3796.html" title="User:Kbthompson">Kbthompson</a> 10:43, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's not a violation of copyright to quote a source, this constitutes <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_a984.html#Text" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">fair use</a>. It should be apparent to anyone with any experience of academia that it is common practice to quote sources, and this is <b>never</b> considered a copyright violation. What would be illegal would be not to attribute the source, because to claim it as one's own would be plaigiarism, but the source is clearly attributed, and Wikipedia doen't alow original research anyway. It's also obvious that the Guardian itself is quoting someone else here. <a href="../../../w/o/b/User%7EWobble_51f3.html" title="User:Wobble">Alun</a> 04:58, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That is irrelevant. For all you know, the Guardian may have paid for the interview. Wikipedia is <b>not</b> an essay or dissertation. The conditions set by the Guardian seem clear enough. As to what constitutes 'fair use' is certainly debateable in this context considering the Cable St. article is quite small. That quote (hardly essential either) looks like it constiutes about 10% of the entire article! Unless Wiki has permission from the Guardian I suggest the quote in question be kept off the article until this matter can be clearly resolved.</dd>

<dd>It's not only perfectly acceptable to use quotes as <i>fair use</i>, but this is American copyright law, these servers are based in America, fair use is based on US law. There is absolutely no reason not to use this quotation in this article. Any short quotation is acceptable in any article as long as it's attributed. This is common practice and your reasoning is merely a rather feeble <i>excuse</i>, you only don't want to include the quotation due to your POV. Please do not revert this article again or I shall attempt to get it protected. <a href="../../../w/o/b/User%7EWobble_51f3.html" title="User:Wobble">Alun</a> 09:41, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If the Guardian attempted to sue Wikipedia in US courts based on copyright violation because of this quote it would be laughed out of court. Your reasoning is also ludicrous. I would think it was a joke if I hadn't taken a look at your edit history and seen that you obviously have a none too savoury POV to push here. Far from being genuinely concerned about copyright, you are just attempting to keep this quote out because of your own POV. Your arguments are paper thin and are not based on any sound understanding of either copyright law or Wikipedia policies or guidelines. <a href="../../../w/o/b/User%7EWobble_51f3.html" title="User:Wobble">Alun</a> 16:46, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The quotation constitutes <i>fair use</i> under UK law. Where it would be wrong is if a substantial part of the original article were to be lifted. Less than 2 paras is generally considered fine for academic, review or other writing purposes. The quotation must be attributed - and it is fully. Editors should be aware that the 3R rule applies. UK &amp; US courts are in agreement on this one. <a href="../../../k/b/t/User%7EKbthompson_3796.html" title="User:Kbthompson">Kbthompson</a> 19:08, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm not sure what "Nazi Blackshirts" are. SA-troops were Brownshirts, some SS-troops wore a black uniform at that time but I don't think they were known as Blackshirts, and the Italian Fascists with their black shirts weren't Nazis. I'm no expert though; were there "Nazi Blackshirts"?
