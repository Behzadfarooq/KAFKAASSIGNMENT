<p>I'm surprised that this article doesn't mention Johnny Clem - or rather, that Wikipedia doesn't mention it at all. Johnny Clem was the 12-year-old drummer boy in this war, but his drum was destroyed in battle. He picked up a gun and started shooting, and was promoted to sergeant and decorated for his bravery.</p>

<li>Modern scholarship indicates that it is highly unlikely that John Clem was present at the battle of Shiloh, and his exploits at Chickamauga are also likely exaggerated. The strongest scholarship indicates that Clem served with the 22nd Michigan Regiment, which had not yet been raised at the time of the Battle of Shiloh. He did not appear on the rolls of said regiment until May of 1863, over a year after the battle. The claims of his participation at Shiloh were made by Clem himself, years after the war, and detail a period before he was specifically famous. The story of the drummer boy had several claimants, none of whom have been convincingly proven. -- <a href="../../../i/o/l/User%7EIol_91ac.html" title="User:Iol">Iol</a> 03:02, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>It needs to be noted that the confusion on part of orders to advance via Grant was delivered by an aide who had written them down as Grant spoke, this could have easily added to the confusion by mentioning Where Wallace was to deploy and engage the Confederates.</p>

<li>""Yes," he replied, followed by a puff. "Yes. Lick 'em tomorrow, though.""</li>
</ul>
<p>I do think that such sentences do not belong, and they are only examples of others. The first seems to voice opinion and the second reads like some sort of war storys. Useful citations notwithstanding, I don't think that this helps the article in any way. If nobody minds, I'll try to correct that in a week.</p>
<p>Martin</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, I have no idea what your problem with the first phrase is. He displayed a lack of concern about security issues and it was the most consequential example of such. Edit it if you like. As to the second, I suppose it could be removed, but it is a very famous anecdote about Grant that demonstrates his attitude about setbacks and his focus on offense, so removing it would not "help the article in any way." As to the other unnamed examples, I have no opinion. Perhaps others can weigh in. As a general rule, however, it would have been polite of you to raise your concerns on this page prior to plastering the pejorative warning box on the article page and then saying you want a week to work on your proposed improvements. <a href="../../../h/l/j/User%7EHlj_9c70.html" title="User:Hlj">Hal Jespersen</a> 22:24, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I just have taken out the "Unencyclopedic" notice and agree that that might have been impolite. Nevertheless I don't think that my points raised are "contrived". At least the anecdote/quote should be marked as such, if it really needs to stay (what I oppose). Martin</p>

<dd>[You can sign your comments by typing four ~s, BTW.] Thanks for your cooperation on the warning box. I have updated the article to indicate it's a historic anecdote and provided a citation. (I could represent the entire sequence as a quoted passage from any number of books, but question the necessity of that.) If you have other stylistic grievances, I invite you to describe them here and I'll address them. <a href="../../../h/l/j/User%7EHlj_9c70.html" title="User:Hlj">Hal Jespersen</a> 15:51, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hal, since you seem to be the article owner I suggest that that the phrase "most consequential lack of concern" be changed and amended with a footnote stating a paragraph from Grant's memoirs, because I see this more as a matter of decision than as of disinterestedness:</p>
<p><i>"The criticism has often been made that the Union troops should have been intrenched at Shiloh. Up to that time the pick and spade had been but little resorted to at the West. I had, however, taken this subject under consideration soon after re-assuming command in the field, and, as already stated, my only military engineer reported unfavorably. Besides this, the troops with me, officers and men, needed discipline and drill more than they did experience with the pick, shovel and axe. Reinforcements were arriving almost daily, composed of troops that had been hastily thrown together into companies and regiments â€” fragments of incomplete organizations, the men and officers strangers to each other. Under all these circumstances I concluded that drill and discipline were worth more to our men than fortifications."</i></p>
<p>(but I don't know if it's too much text) MFacherzwirg 06:36, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>First, no one "owns" Wikipedia articles. My name is in the box on top of this page because I watch over it closely and am available for people who have inquiries about citations, etc. Others can add their names to that list, BTW. The quote you offer is not <i>too</i> long, but I'd like to hear what the problem is with the original sentence before correcting anything. The point of the sentence was to address Grant's almost chronic disinterest in security concerns for his own force, concentrating wholly on his plans for offensive action, as also happened at Belmont and Ft Donelson. And that this battle represented the most serious consequence of that attitude. <a href="../../../h/l/j/User%7EHlj_9c70.html" title="User:Hlj">Hal Jespersen</a> 16:00, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>The only point of interest here is that Grant and Sherman had no idea that there was a CSA force anywhere in the area. Sherman should have known better as there were some reports as to movement and one patrol was in contact. Entrenching would not have been common at that point anywhere to my knowledge, though it might have been common practice the 1st I read of trenching was the muleshoe on the eastern front I think in the Cold Harbor battle but I might be mistaken. However that no patrols were sent out was a fair breach of security anyway that you cut it. Scouts and patrols of the entire area should have been conducted throughout the time the army was encamped at Shiloh. Grant in my opinion is open to critism on that point as a breach of good military protocol in time of war. He didn't maintain operational awareness. <a href="../../../t/i/r/User%7ETirronan_44c8.html" title="User:Tirronan">Tirronan</a> 00:52, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I got sick of the non-stop IP vandals and requested protection we have semiprotect and hopefully this will be enough. <a href="../../../t/i/r/User%7ETirronan_44c8.html" title="User:Tirronan">Tirronan</a> 04:33, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>We got more agreement than I thought for a 1st pass.</p>
<ul>
<li>I've got to read and source/cite a book on this subject and will do so.</li>
<li>There has been a wish to see the photo galleries go perhaps a list of the relevent commanders at the bottom of the article?</li>
<li>Some clean up and explaination of terms like rollup ect.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think we are in pretty good shape but I want imput before I touch anything. <a href="../../../t/i/r/User%7ETirronan_44c8.html" title="User:Tirronan">Tirronan</a> 19:06, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't see any justification for replacing a gallery with an equivalent list of names. The names are already in the article. Every Civil War battle book published since 1970 has had collections of pictures of the generals. I chose the gallery format rather than individual thumbnails spread around the article because Wikipedia's image placement mechanisms are pretty crude and they get messed up conflicting with maps, battle boxes, etc. <a href="../../../h/l/j/User%7EHlj_9c70.html" title="User:Hlj">Hal Jespersen</a> 20:27, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Its your call Hal, I won't do it if you disagree. <a href="../../../t/i/r/User%7ETirronan_44c8.html" title="User:Tirronan">Tirronan</a> 21:13, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's not my call, it's my opinion. Others may disagree, and if a consensus forms that I am wrong, we'll go with that consensus. However, the opinion of one featured article reviewer does not mean that a consensus has been reached. <a href="../../../h/l/j/User%7EHlj_9c70.html" title="User:Hlj">Hal Jespersen</a> 22:52, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I just reverted a change by mistake by pushing the wrong button -- I meant to revert it with a clarifying edit summary. The dates in those headers are not wiki links per se, they are date formats that allow users to specify the method by which dates are displayed in their browser. Some people prefer, for example, to see dates such as 7 April, others as April 7 (and there are other variations). <a href="../../../h/l/j/User%7EHlj_9c70.html" title="User:Hlj">Hal Jespersen</a> 00:23, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
