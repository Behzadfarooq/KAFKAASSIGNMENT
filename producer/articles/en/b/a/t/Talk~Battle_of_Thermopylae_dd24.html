You actually belive Persia had 15k-100k to invade Persia?</p>
<p>Greece with it's state could get a force up to 150k and was much better in combat and had better equipment so Persia probably had ca 250k warriors with them.</p>
<p>And to you think people made up how well greece did,imgaien this,7000k greece soldier in a mountain cliff killing over 10k persians,what happend then? 10k pile of dead bodies,when the rest of the 6k army left on the third day spartans just waited on Persians to come over the pile and get slaughterd.</p>
<p>You seems to think 300 spartans stormed 250k or 1 million persians for 3 days.</p>

<p>Surely an army of over two and a half million is totally unrealistic, especially for those times. I strongly suspect that number has been exagerated out of all proportion to enhance the reputation and bravery of the outnumbered Greeks. <a href="../../../l/i/a/User%7ELianachan_edab.html" title="User:Lianachan">Lianachan</a> 12:32, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I agree, someone should really change it. Yongke 18:21, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>While obviously exaggerated or minimized (and you can't really prove <b>which</b> number has been falsified) we are left with Greek history. Do you, or does anyone, have verifiable numbers? I would think not. Unfortunately there is no way to know, so let us concentrate on the items that can be verified and / or falsified rather than quibbling about something that never can. Accept the fact that governments manipulate the facts and fight to stop it from happening today because you can't do anything about the Greek's manipulation of their histories now. You don't have the information to correct it. <a href="../../../i/n/g/User%7EInglixthemad_28e7.html" title="User:Inglixthemad">Inglixthemad</a></p>

<p>The size of the armies is pulled from the historical account of a Greek historian. The numbers could very well be exaggaerated, but history is written by winners. What is for certain is that the Persian army was exponentially larger than the Greek one. The Greeks did so well because they used the land to their advantage and their army's reputation to instill fear in the Persians, causing them to hesitate at the sight of the Spartans.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>

<dd>I would say the Persian Army consisted of 100,000-200,000 troops and its navy consisted of just over 1,000 ships. I will quote from my AP World History Textbook "Traditions and Encounters 2/e" which has many contemporary sources and is scholarly accurate. Perhaps this will offer some insight to clear up the discussion.</dd>

<dd>"...Darius's(my brother) successor Xerxes decided to avenge the Persian losses. In 480 B.C.E. he dispatched a massive force consisting of perhaps one hundred thousand troops and a fleet of one thousand ships to subdue the Greeks. The Persian army succeeded in capturing and burning Athens, but a Greek fleet led by Athenians shattered the Persian navy at the battle of Salamis. Xerxes himself viewed the conflict from a temporary throne set up on a hillside overlooking the narrow strait....The following year a Greek force at Platea routed the Persian army, whose survivors retreated to Anatolia." cbhadha 11:45, March 16, 2007</dd>

<p>You say? Incredible. Most evidence says bare minimum it was 400 000, you are forgetting this is the army intended to invade all Greece, they had been planning for decades. 156.34.192.75 12:13, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>2 million vs 300 men? Come on.

<p>Also, the world population at the time (as can be seen from the World Population page here at Wikipedia) was only 100 million at the time. It is extremely unlikely that 2% of the population would be in this single battle.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Yeah It's retarded to believe whichever historian said about that battle, especially someone as biased as Herodotus. We've all heard of the statement that history is written by the victors, and this is no different; majority of information we in the West have of that or any battle of the Greeks, is from the Greeks themselves, and it is rather obvious that they would skew history in their own favor. Frankly people still argue about what happened 10 years ago history, much less 2000+ yrs ago or so.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>I agree. The number is probably closer to 300,000, and this is believable, since the Persian empire was massive. Xerxes took the invasion quite seriously, obviously. But to the guy at the top, this battle really happened. Anyone knows that in battle a valley can equalize the playing field, as numbers cannot be used to advantage. The length of the greeks' spears, combined with their superior skills and tactics, destroyed the Persian forces. 300 men could have held 10 million men for the same amount of time, if we forget the outflanking force of the Persians. The Bryce 11:26, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I am more concerned with the logistical support of an army of millions in the early 400s. As the editor above already said, 2 per cent of the total world population being involved in one localized campaign sounds utterly unrealistic. Some other common sense-type of thoughts that come to mind are:</dd>
<dd>(1) It is both extremely expensive and risky to upkeep a large army for any extended period in a pre-industrial, agrarian society. Probably most soldiers would have been farmers themselves, and their hands would be needed for food production in their homelands. With an army proportionally that big, the results would have been disastrous if they stayed away from home too long. Was Xerxes that desperate to conquer the Greek city states? It doesn't seem very plausible.</dd>
<dd>(2) How did an expeditional force of this size support itself? The most obvious way would be to live off the land, but Greece has never been that fertile in terms of agricultural yields, and it supports only a population of modest size even in modern times. Where would the Persian army have got the food for its soldiers and the fodder for its horses (and camels) from?</dd>
<dd>Regardless of what ancient historians would want us to believe, I'd stick with the lower number. <a href="../../../i/b/l/User%7EIblardi_3c55.html" title="User:Iblardi">Iblardi</a> 23:30, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I didn't touch the article itself, did I? As I said, this is just a common sense-argument, something that might be taken into consideration. It hardly involves any personal research.

</dl>
<p>There are somethings that people haven't pointed out (or I just missed them) is that (1) If the army was 2 million and that percent of the world population would he not use it for more then just a battle? maybe to take over more land?? (2) Is the 300 vs 2 million, he didn't send all of the men at one time he sent them in waves so in saying that there very well could have been 300 men, also the Spartans sent the tired men to the back to rest and did this so the men could have the energy to fight. {petopali}</p>

<p>escription of the battle are derived solely from the greks, thus they are naturally fabricated and are extremely out of proportion. This battle would be more aptly filed under greek mythology.

<dd>Actually what the first guy's comment is correct. If you look at the persian greco war article it explains that the current statistical knowledge is based on pretty much on only herodatus's findings (he wasnt even alive at the time of the battles)and that his results were based on interveiws that were influenced by political slants and other biases. Other than that the article needs to point out that the size of the Persian Army was somewhat irrelevant tactically because of the geographic conditions (equally sized forces on both sides were actually in combat at the same time). The valley was "50 feet wide" (just enough room for the spartans but not enough for the persian army to utilize their numbers). Another item that needs emphasis is the equipment and the method of combat: the hopolites had spears with very far reach therefore they only needed to stand back in formation and protect their niche in the canyon (they fought extremely defensive unlike their portrayl as "herioc", aggressive combatants in the comic and film 300). <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Diddy2100 (<a href="../../../d/i/d/User_talk%7EDiddy2100_ddac.html" title="User talk:Diddy2100">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Diddy2100_937e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Diddy2100">contribs</a>) 03:41, 22 January 2007 (UTC).</small></dd>

<dd>Diddy2100 you have a point. Since the mountainous terrain was selected by the Spartans as the choke hold, it gave them two oportunities to capitalize. Firstly the 80,000 cavalry that both Herodotus and Kampouris claim would not have been employable. By all accounts these particular Persian units were most effective against Greek phalanx, it took much discipline to stand against a cavalry charge. Secondly as you stated the Persians would not have been able to use their full force, but obviously this was the Greeks alliance's plan. Had this battle been fought on an open field; rather than take 3 days, this battle probably would have been done in 3 hours. Leaving no time for the for the Athenians to flee or even plan the next strategy. There is no doubt that Herodotus exaggerated an at times employed rather false premises. Afterall he was an author an to publish and make famous his work he would have needed the assistance of the wealthy. So in many ways if you sponsored him, he would put you and your family in history, even if you were irrelevant.<br />
That being said, Herodotus is our almost only significant source, so rather than completely bash him, it would probably be best if we could extrapolate what seems most truthful, neutral and realistic from his writings, that would be most useful. Did he exaggerate? No friggin doubt about it, but if we can carefully wander around the poetic bias we can unravel many truths as well.--<a href="../../../a/r/v/User%7EArvand_14ba.html" title="User:Arvand">Arsenous Commodore</a> 03:36, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Just to let you know Diddy, Herodotus was born at the time of the battle but he would have been I think a bit young to remember. Plus I don't think Herodotus should go so much stick because I very much doubt that he just selected some random numbers and placed them as the Persian strengths. He might have had a source that claimed that the Persians army had 2,000,000+ men. So please give Herodotus a break.&#160;:) <a href="../../../k/y/r/User%7EKyriakos_b5e6.html" title="User:Kyriakos">Kyriakos</a> 07:22, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's retarded to believe whichever historian said about that battle, especially someone as biased as Herodotus. We've all heard of the statement that history is written by the victors, and this is no different; majority of information we in the West have of that or any battle of the Greeks, is from the Greeks themselves, and it is rather obvious that they would skew history in their own favor. Frankly people still argue about what happened 10 years ago history, much less 2000+ yrs ago or so. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_71.123.213.247_a3cc.html" title="Special:Contributions/71.123.213.247">71.123.213.247</a> (<a href="../../../7/1/2E/User_talk%7E71.123.213.247.html" title="User talk:71.123.213.247">talk</a>) 23:29, 2 March 2007 (UTC).</small></dd>

<p>This article should remain disputed until references to a 2 million-man army are removed. Aside from the exaggeration of the Greek accounts, logistically speaking, there was no way to sustain a movement of 2 or even 1 million men across Asia Minor and into Greece.

<p>I removed the 120,000 figure for the Persian strength. It is the minimum figure and doesn't reflect any more consensus than Herodotus' 5,000,000 (max value). In other words there's no point on putting the minimum estimate above the maximum. I replaced it with 200K-2M, it seems to be an average range of the estimates given by both primary and secondary sources (120K-5M as a raw figure). <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiskin_55d1.html" title="User:Miskin">Miskin</a> 17:22, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think that things should only be included if they have a strong link to the battle - it is in popular culture to such an extent that references can be found in quite a few places. Some of the section is in danger of veering into this area - the book 'Halo: the Fall of Reach' has almost no connection to Thermopylae, whereas 'Gates of Fire' does, for example. As I am a fairly new user, however, I wouldn't want to upset the status quo by meddling with the article. What do other people think? Andyana 14:27, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Why is this article protected? It would seem more accurately placed in the greek propoganda/myth project. Throughout the article only the information of herodatos, the father of lies, is used. The article never addresses the arguments of other prominent, modern historians. The article never mentions alternate theories, explanations, or information. The article never mentions that some historians believe the battle is complete fiction. Many improvements could be made to this article, but some ass who totally believes the hoax of herodatus chose to block modifications.</p>
<p><b>Why Relocate?</b></p>
<p>The battle itself is a part of historical fact. Archeologists have found evidence of arrow barrages, et al. Remember something else: all history is technically lies (written by the winners no less) so don't get too proud of yours unless you were there to witness it personally. That's the idea your presenting carried to it's logical fallacy. Furthermore, pages are protected to keep random people from vandalizing them because they either <i>disagree</i> with the view presented or are simply changing it maliciously for the thrill.</p>
<p>Complain about it all you want. When it comes to history, especially early histories, there are very few concrete sources. Do you want to do something constructive (I hope so). Did the Persians keep a better history? Log in and present sources under the aspect title of "Persian Accounts" or something similar. Remember, complaining does little, presenting verifiable fact goes further. --<a href="../../../i/n/g/User%7EInglixthemad_28e7.html" title="User:Inglixthemad">Inglix the Mad - Killing all hope.</a> 16:52, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It shouldn't be simply a Persian victory. Maybe it shouldn't be labelled a Persian victory at all. The Spartans and Thespians who stayed and died knew full well that they were going to be killed, however eventually. Their entire purpose in staying was to delay the Persian army. By all accounts, the Greeks won an astounding victory if one is to judge the battle's importance in the overall scheme of the Greco-Persian war. Thermapylae allowed the Greeks time to marshal their forces and prepare for the battle, and the morale damage the Spartans and Thespians inflicted on the entire Persian army simply can't be calculated. I imagine the knowledge that the 1,000 they fought (and bled rivers of blood against) were a mere fraction of the actual Greek army was frightening to many soldiers in the Persian army. It would seem to me that a Pyrrhic victory is exactly what this was, if we must label it as a victory at all. I think I'll log in and change this now. 151.151.21.100 17:43, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The battle was a Persian military victory and a Greek moral victory, kind of like the second siege of Messolonghi in 1827.

<dd>This debate actually went on for quite a while earlier, however it was unanimously agreed by Wiki users (except for one aggressive anon) that this battle cannot be classified as a Pyrrhic victory. Losing anywhere from a low of 1% to a high of 10% of your army (from Xerxes' perspective) according to the strength (200,000-2,000,000) listed above, does not at all constitute a pyrrhic victory. One of the errors repeated on this article is that we are using costly on a small scale synonymously with pyrrhic. Xerxes could have sustained 10-100 more similar battles. Even from a strategic standpoint the Persians were successful. It was the result of this battle that ensured Persian occupation of Greece and the razing of Athens. There isn't a doubt that in terms of a comparative tactical figure ratio to the Greeks, it was costly for the Persians; but that's all. This wasn't the case for Persian army's perspective. Also the whole crushing of morale, well with all sincerity that's probably not more than speculation. And the other point is like Ikkoki mentioned, "moral" or even "costly" are not standard Wiki descriptions for result. I am changing it back to the originally agreed upon result. I welcome any comments on the issue, just please post your reasoning before you make the changes.

<dd>As a simple, narrow, battle result question, "Persian victory" is correct. As a question of war, "successful Greek delaying action" is correct, and ought to be mentioned, not in the battle box but in the "Aftermath" section. As a demonstration of military devotion, it seems the most successful military demostration in all history, since its legend has lasted thousands of years and produced more movies and other modern media attention than all other ancient battles put together.

<p>The article could keep the fairy tale version, but it definitely needs modern estimates by modern historians while emphasizing that the ancient greeks fabricated these ridiculous statistics. According to the capacity, number, and size of the invading ships some scholars estimate 40,000 Persian Soldiers tops while the spartans had about 10,000.

<dd>I expressed some reservations about the size of the Persian army further up this talk page. These reservations are not the result of any "nationalist insecurities", and neither were they "denialist comments against western scholarship". There is never going to be, to borrow a horrible expression from wikilore, a NPOV account of this battle simply because history has only handed down to us accounts from one side.

<p>Please point me to the part of the article where it is implied that Herodotus is fully accepted. The number of the persian numbers appear as a range closest to the consensus. Over 2M is too much, and under 200K is to little. Since there can be no specific answer, we either remove the numbers completely or stick to the wide range. There you go. As for "denialists" and "nationalists", I think those terms are actually complimentary to someone who thinks that the battle is actually mythological. Look I don't understand why the Iranian crowd cares so much about this. Can't they just let it go? How come there's no Greeks complaining on Persian imperialism which nearly cost their freedom? Maybe because they won? That is the only reason. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiskin_55d1.html" title="User:Miskin">Miskin</a> 01:00, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have no vested interest in this, very little interest at all actually, and no axe to grind. I am just deeply suspicious of the reported size of the Persian army, as it is reminiscent of similar (although smaller) exaggerations in the accounts of historians such as Tacitus, with which I am more familiar. As a Scot, I'm not even sure who "the Iranian crowd" are! <a href="../../../l/i/a/User%7ELianachan_edab.html" title="User:Lianachan">Lianachan</a> 01:22, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Herodotus knew no language but his own, and he was therefore forced to rely on interpreters or on natives who spoke Greek. He himself is perfectly frank about the matter, and usually tells the source of his information. “This is what the Persians say,” “Thus the priests of the Egyptians told me,” are types of expressions which recur again and again. Even when Greek matters are involved, he seems usually to have relied on oral tradition, rather than on documentary evidence; he rarely mentions an inscription as the source of his information. But even given that, Herodotus deplored the Greco-Persian war and blamed it on the Greeks. But not only on the Greeks: he blamed it on the Athenian "democrats". Herodotus writes next:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"The Athenians indeed, convinced [by Aristagoras], voted to dispatch twenty ships as succors for the Ionians and appointed as general Melanthius, who was a man among the townsmen esteemed in all respects. And those ships proved the beginning of evils for both the Greeks and the barbarians." Histories (5.97)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Many historian (e.g. Plutarch) believe that Herodotus's praise (in other passages e.g., in 5.78) for Athenian "democracy" is rather sarcastic (see "On the Malignity of Herodotus" of Plurach).</p>
<p><br />
There is probably no good compromise between the 'mythical'/propaganda account and likely historical fact. I suggest two sections wherein the essential facts of each account are briefly summarized. Begin with the popular form and describe it as it is understood, then proceed to criticize it where it is likely to be exaggerated and made up, presenting as you go more realistic figures. This should satisfy the people who want the traditional account to be represented while not misinforming readers as to the probable reality.--<a href="../../../s/o/r/User%7ESorpigal_87e5.html" title="User:Sorpigal">Sorpigal</a> 02:52, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have a somewhat different suggestion for the warbox. I find the inclusion of "the entire Persian presence" of 5M+ to be somewhat unnecessary. After all, it is a warbox, and the strength category is located just below the combatants. Wouldn't it be far more accurate and reasonably logical to maintain the warbox for war (or combat) units only; rather than to sum is value with support troops. It is pretty strange to up the Persian presence with the inclusion of maids, mistresses, musicians, treasure carriers, many ceremonial nobles etc; that all don't fight or make any military difference in the battle, in the warbox. Shouldn't Herodotus' claim of 2,641,610 military presence only be listed in the warbox footnote instead? I think this is a good idea, because the doubling of Persian troops is already done and explained in the article. Does anyone agree with the idea to change the footnote’s wording to imply only military unit figures and thus list the 2M+ number? I guess my point is that the battle box sould solely be reserved for battling and potentially battling units, not support troops too. I’ll make the change and be happy to hear others’ opinions.--<a href="../../../a/r/v/User%7EArvand_14ba.html" title="User:Arvand">Arsenous Commodore</a> 16:06, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My understanding of the phrase "Pyrrhic Victory" is that it does not only relate to the size of an army vs. the number of casualties, but also to the number of casualties to what was gained from the victory.

<p>What about all the scholars cited in the size of the Persian army section? I don't think your word is more credible than theirs. The Persian army was in reality "the armies of the kingdoms of the Persian Empire", which at a time expanded from Northern Africa to India. If a handful of Greek <i>cities</i> were able to gather over 100,000 soldiers, then it's only natural that Persia would have been able to gather <i>many times</i> that number.

<p>Tell this to Hannibal who crossed the Alps with 50,000 men, or was he aided by Zeus as well? Your argumentation reaches the other extreme. The Art of War does speak of massive armies well in the hundreds of thousands, and those Chinese Empires were much comparable to if not smaller than Persia. Anything above 100,000 is exaggerated for medieval but not for ancient warfare. Persia could easily gather a large army, whether she could control it and send it all the way to Greece is a whole different story. If you can improve the article by citing some contemporary estimates then be my guest, otherwise don't make free criticism. Never in the article it was stated that 2M was the actual Persian number, it is clearly stated that they were Herodotus' numbers.

<dd>It may be worth noting that at one point Herodotus himself betrays some suspicion at his numbers of the Persian army. At 7.187, as he wraps up his estimate of the Persian host (admitting that the number of camp-followers were many &amp; uncountable), he states that he is "not at all surprised that the water of the rivers was fount too scant for the army in some instances; rather it is a marvel to me how the provision did not fail, when the numbers were so great. For I find on calculation that if each man consumed no more than a choenix of corn a day, there must have been used daily by the army 110,340 medimni, and this without counting what was eaten by the women, the eunuchs, the pack-animals, and the hounds."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>An army travels on its stomach, &amp; after they crossed the Hellespont, the Persian army was forced to live off of what it could forage -- i.e. steal at spearpoint from the local peasants. Herodotus had a good sense of just how many soldiers that part of Greece &amp; Thrace could support, &amp; I suspect at this point in his narrative he was beginning to doubt his own calculations. Based on what I know of Ethiopian military history, the effective maximum size of an army living of the land is not much more than 100,000; since I doubt few Greeks had seen more than 10,000 people gathered in once place, to them even 100,000 was indistinguishable from 2.5 million. -- <a href="../../../l/l/y/User%7ELlywrch_461d.html" title="User:Llywrch">llywrch</a> 02:32, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Are you responding to me? I'm merely pointing out obvious problems in Herodotus' estimate -- which, from the passage I quoted even Herodotus was aware of. Estimates for the number of combatants are notoriously unreliable for ancient battles, as a specialist's discussion of almost any battle will state. To say that Herodotus was wrong about the size of the Persian army &amp; it had a specific number of soldiers is original research: pointing out that there are problems with Herodotus' estimate, <i>then</i> offering a list of modern estimates is a responsible discussion of the problem. If you want to quote Herodotus in the infobox, then make it clear (maybe in a footnote) that he's the source, &amp; that modern scholars disagree with him (whose estimates will be presented in the appropriate section). -- <a href="../../../l/l/y/User%7ELlywrch_461d.html" title="User:Llywrch">llywrch</a> 22:43, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There is no reason to take Herodotus' account of numbers seriously; besides the totally impossible figure, he had absolutely no way of knowing whether the Persian army was 2000 or 2 million (was he there? did he go around counting them?). Some people act like he had access to reuters news service or drew on goverment figures. Hilarious! His "estimates" shouldn't even be brought into consideration. As far as I remember, all serious estimates put it between 40,000 and 100, 000, but as all my classics books are packed away in a far away place (I no longer do these subjects), I won't be giving you any references any time soon.

<dd>In my edition of Herodotus the commentator (whose name is Gabriel Syntomoros) comes to the conclusion that Herodotus came with the 1,7 million figure because during the counting and reorganisation of the army that took place in Ennea Odoi (later Amphipolis) the box that was built there and could hold one baivabaram filled 170 times. He assumes that all 1,7 million were infantry and, adding cavalry and fleet multiplies his numbers by 2 and comes with the 5 million figure. Ctesias of Cnidus who had access to the Achemenid Persian archives ("vasiliki diftheira" is Tzetzes' exact wording) wrote 150 years later that the army Xerxes sent numbered 800,000 battle troops. Considering that indeed at least as many troops are necessary for support as for battle Stecchini (who was a professor at Harvard if I remember correctly) believed that indeed 800,000 were the battle troops and 1,7 million their entire number. Beyond that Dr. Kampouris argues that it if for arguements sake there were 25,000-30,000 Persians (he is more inclined to believe there were 60,000 and he is not alone) at Marathon then with a double fleet during Xerxes' invasion the fleet carried troop should be 50-60,000 alone since Xerxes had twice the fleet that Datis had 10 years earlier. It is totally irrational (in his arguement) that 250,000+ rowers would be mobilized to carry that many battle troops by sea that accompany only 100,000 land based troops. Then he continues to argue why Stecchini is right; <a href="../../../i/k/o/User%7EIkokki_ab19.html" title="User:Ikokki">Ikokki</a> 10:17, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Let us try avoiding original research for the moment, we cannot assume what Herodotus may have or have not known. The <i>Cambridge companion to Herodotus</i> states that an estimation of 210,000 land troops is the modern consensus. This is based on the theory that an error in Herodotus' calculations (having to do with persian military units) resulted in multiplying the real number by 10. This excludes the huge number of "personnel" that came with the Persian fleet (where btw Herodotus' estimates are considered reliable). <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiskin_55d1.html" title="User:Miskin">Miskin</a> 03:23, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>how can anyone even believe that 5 million is a close to accurate guess. Imagine for a bit trying to support an army of 5 million in the field the logistical and complex nightmare that it must have been. Or how did 5 million troops land on the shores of Greece, remove this"This number needs to be nearly doubled in order to account for support troops and thus Herodotus reports that the whole force numbered 5,283,220 men,[30] a figure which has been accepted by some modern historians and rejected by others.

<p>Current consensus supports that Herodotus accidentally multiplied the real number of the Persian land forces by 10. This gave him a wrong estimate of 2M for land forces, doubled to 5M for the total.

<dd>I told you before Miskin, Herodotus' figures are useless ... he couldn't possibly have known; as a rule, never trust the figures given in an ancient source; they are almost never known to the writer, and are included usually to make a victory or defeat seem more glorious or more disastrous. Your use of sources here is amateurish (I don't mean that as an insult). Any estimate based on a direct reading of Herodotus will be worthless. Any figure above 80,000 all in is in my view seriously doubtful (10000 Greeks were enough to serve as the basis of a full Persian army in the 4th century). PS, even this lower estimate you're giving would make the expedition very close in size (if not considerably higher) than the entire population of Greece in this period, in which case defeat would simply be impossible (a few thousand Normans were enough to control over 1 million discontented English 1500 years later). <b><a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalgacus_587c.html" title="User:Calgacus">Calgacus</a> (<i><a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalgacus_321f.html" title="User talk:Calgacus">ΚΑΛΓΑΚΟΣ</a></i>)</b> 00:46, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Please read my answer above, I'm citing information from a very credible source (The Cambridge companion to Herodotus). If you call this publisher 'amateurish', then due all the respect but you are not being very objective. It appears that most modern scholars believe that Herodotus or his sources did have access on official Persian records, the numbers on the land troops are a miscalculation from his part, but the numbers he gives for the fleet are considered accurate. Therefore, despite what you assume, Herodotus is very important. Some sources speak of a consensus between 150,000-200,000 others 180,000 and the most credible ones 210,000 based on Herodotus' estimation error. Your personal estimates is nowhere near modern consensus and do not concern wikipedia much (see <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a>). <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiskin_55d1.html" title="User:Miskin">Miskin</a> 01:29, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I don't understand why you're being so hostile and obsessive about this. Just accept that your anti-Herodotus stance falls on the other extreme, not on the mainstream view. I took your advice, checked some credible sources and made significant changes. What are you still arguing about? The infobox?

<dd>Listen, I know it is kinda difficult to question the traditional account. When we do this it generally leads to the rejection of all types of other things we have accepted (this is why <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copernicus.html" title="Copernicus">Copernicus</a> and <a href="../../../g/a/l/Galileo.html" title="Galileo">Galileo</a> had such hard times). However, the fact is that we can't even begin to really accept the authenticity of ancient accounts at face value until the <a href="../../../p/e/l/Peloponnesian_War_fd52.html" title="Peloponnesian War">Peloponnesian War</a>, and even then they are only occasionally accurate. For example in <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_history.html" title="Roman history">Roman history</a> the accounts of the <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_Punic_War_97a8.html" title="Second Punic War">Second Punic War</a> are generally thought to be relatively accurate as they take into account the <a href="../../../l/o/g/Logistics.html" title="Logistics">logistical</a> capabilities of the opposing sides and describes the actually difficulties that the generals had in supplying and moving their armies around. Compare this to the <a href="../../../c/i/m/Cimbrian_War_fc72.html" title="Cimbrian War">Cimbrian War</a> between Rome and a coalition primarily consisting of the <a href="../../../c/i/m/Cimbri.html" title="Cimbri">Cimbri</a> and the <a href="../../../t/e/u/Teutons.html" title="Teutons">Teutons</a>, even though it took place more than a century after the second punic war the accounts of it are much less accurate and more shrouded in more legend than fact. This is why it appears that the battles of <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Arausio_f973.html" title="Battle of Arausio">Arausio</a>, <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Aquae_Sextiae_4b21.html" title="Battle of Aquae Sextiae">Aquae Sextiae</a>, <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Vercellae_201d.html" title="Battle of Vercellae">Vercellae</a> all appear to be larger than the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Cannae_3437.html" title="Battle of Cannae">battle of Cannae</a> and the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Zama_3fb1.html" title="Battle of Zama">battle of Zama</a> combined. When I first started to realize the inaccuracy of the historical accounts that I have been engroosed with for years I was devastated, but I did eventually accept them</dd>
<dd>You may wonder why smarted and more knowledgable historians then me apparently accept these accounts if I am correct. The answer is not that they are stupid, rather it is because they have to. At a basic level <a href="../../../h/i/s/History.html" title="History">history</a> is the study of written accounts. So in the absence of any reliable figures historians simply provide the only figures that they have. Do you really believe that in a battle between <a href="../../../a/r/a/Aram_Damascus_3b4c.html" title="Aram Damascus">Aram Damascus</a> and the <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kingdom_of_Israel_ab05.html" title="Kingdom of Israel">Kingdom of Israel</a> in 846 BC, the two sides could field enough soldiers so that their would be 127,000 casualties on the Aram Damascus side alone?- <a href="../../../m/o/s/User%7EMoshe_Constantine_Hassan_Al-Silverburg_9171.html" title="User:Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg">Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg</a> | <a href="../../../m/o/s/User_talk%7EMoshe_Constantine_Hassan_Al-Silverburg_14cc.html" title="User talk:Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg">Talk</a> 01:54, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks for your input Constanine. For the same reason I've been trying to convince some editors here that Herodotus is in fact important to mention for being the authentic primary source. This doesn't mean that his numbers will be taken literally. As you can most people here support extremities, ignoring academic consensus.

<p>This resistance against accuntability, and relying on just Herodotus's account is "at best" convenient for the current ediitors of this article. It is unfortunate that few in here boast of reason and sense, but when it comes to this topic, the only thing they don't care about is reason and sense. I invite you to read more, e.g. Plurach "On the Malignity of Herodotus", and "The Lies in the History of Herodotus" Aelius Harpocration. I am just amased if we should ignore the ignorant?! or there is no ignorance and there are underlying reasons behind this...not a Wiki spirit</p>

<p>I have given some NO ORIGINAL RESEARCH arguements above why the Persian army was large. The issue with Herodotus and the numbers he gives boils down to how good a historian Herodotus was. Herodotus wrote his history some 30 years after the last event he narrated. He had spent a large part of his life travelling around the eastern Mediterranean gathering tales of the events of the Persian wars (and other tales) and spent his time waving them into a narrative. He earned his living retelling these tales to other cities. Near the end of his life he wrote them down but without rechecking them, which is why he does things like giving the topography of Thermopylae twice yet in both cases confusing north and south with east and west. As Kakrides has argued much scorn against him has come from the cities that collaborated with the Persians. Plutarch's work "on the malice of Herodotus" (which seems to be treated here as a work of high calibre) is a libel in which the Heronian biographer scolds him beginning from a very localistic mentality: he wants to justify the Boeotian defection to Persia. What is Plutarch's accusation? That Herodotus is <i>"pro-barbarian"</i>. Herodotus' ancient critics claim that he is biased in favor of the Persians. On his modern critics I think this page is quite eloquent <a href="http://www.iranchamber.com/history/articles/persian_wars1.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.iranchamber.com/history/articles/persian_wars1.php" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> In the last 50 years the scholarly appreciation of Herodotus has risen. His tale of the fall of the neo-babylonian kingdom is corroborated by the chronicle of Nabonides, his tale of the Indian mice digging for gold, long derided as lies, was proven accurate some ten years ago, only that it was not mice but marmots which in ancient Persian were called big mice. The scholarly consensus today is that Herodotus is not lying on purpose. His numbers seem excessive today. I am well aware of the infamous Herodotus 10 rule. However all Greek, Latin and Byzantine historians give large numbers for Achaemenid armies. The two eyewitnesses of the battle of Cunaxa (Xenophon and Ctesias) give different numbers on Artaxerxes' army but both agree it was massive: Xenophon gives 1,2 million and Ctesias 300,000. Arrian, Diodorus, Plutarch and Curtius Rufus agree that Alexander the great faced armies of over 100,000 in Isus and Gaugamela. Byzantine historians and chroniclers usually give Ctesias' 800,000 troops as the size of Xerxes' army in Thermopylae. Either every ancient and Byzantine historian is a liar (willingly or not) or the Achaemenids did draft major armies. Read here fore some more arguements <a href="http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/gabrmetz/gabr0009.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/gabrmetz/gabr0009.htm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> <a href="http://www.iranchamber.com/history/articles/persian_wars5.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.iranchamber.com/history/articles/persian_wars5.php" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> <a href="../../../i/k/o/User%7EIkokki_ab19.html" title="User:Ikokki">Ikokki</a> 14:14, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Medieval historians are also noted for their exaggerations of the size of armies and battles, especially with numbers, so its not like any historical account past some arbitrary date is to be looked at realistically, so even Byzantine accounts will not necessarily be accurate simply because they came later. All classical accounts have to be looked at skeptically; this is a principle of the study of ancient history. It's not enough to simply state "the victors write history" and accept Greek figures of this size; it's doing a disservice to anyone who reads Wiki and is looking for accurate information.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 63.254.37.85 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_63.254.37.85_1be3.html" title="Special:Contributions/63.254.37.85">contribs</a>).</small></dd>

<p>Undoubtedly all the soldiers involved must have had slaves.Helots to carry their gear, take care of horses, and others most of the basics of life. They would have had a minor city of helots. While there is no research that i have found, i haven't looked, that would point to there not being helots present. Also some of these undoubtedly would have been enemy soldiers captured in other battles.This might pan out to be upwards of about 900-1200 slaves. --<a href="../../../c/o/1/User%7ECo1dLP1anet_1319.html" title="User:Co1dLP1anet">Co1dLP1anet</a> 20:54, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>It is true that usually Spartans had 3 to 5 hillots for each Spartan fighter in the Battle. Hillots were participating actively in the battle usually carrying out tasks such as removing dead bodies from the frontlines, providing with weapon replacement, providing with water and in general doing any helpfull task. They were also fighting, sometimes in the frontline if that was really necessary. It was an opportunity for them to get their freedom back. Spartans rarely were giving freedom to those hillots that were showing exceptional bravery in battle. It is unlikely that Sparta deployed only 300 men. It should have deployed a number between 1200 to 1800 but only 300 of them were free Spartan citizens. <a name="Date_of_the_Battle" id="Date_of_the_Battle"></a></p>

<p>They decided to defend it and send a fleet to <i>Artemision</i>, a naval choke point, as Xerxes' army was being supplied and supported by sea. Using the fleet, Xerxes' army might have crossed Maliacos bay and outflanked the Greek army again.[8]</p>

<dd>The suffix -um is latin and <b>not</b> greek.As you might know or guess, greeks (and romans as being parent-language and lingua franca) spoke and wrote in greek and <b>not</b> latin.Anyway,the latin second or -us-um declension of nouns is derived from the greek second or omicron or -os-on declension of nouns...just read wiki or any other web-based or a just plain ol' paper <i>Ancient Greek Grammar</i> and <i>Latin Grammar</i>...<br /></dd>

<dd>I have to correct <i>Thanatos666</i> here. The Latin o-declension on -<i>us</i>, -<i>um</i> is certainly not derived from the Greek o-declension on -<i>os</i>, -<i>on</i>. Rather, they are parallel morphological features of two languages that are related by common descent from the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Proto-Indo-European_language_3a39.html" title="Proto-Indo-European language">proto-Indo-European language</a>. <i>Artemisium</i> could be considered "correct" insofar as the Latinized forms of names of persons, places etc. from ancient Greece were traditionally used in scholarly literature, so it would be the traditionally correct form; but this practice has been in decline during the last decades. <a href="../../../i/b/l/User%7EIblardi_3c55.html" title="User:Iblardi">Iblardi</a> 21:41, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>hellenic language and latin language didn't evolve apart from each other nor did the people nor the culture,so using the indoeuropean theory argument is a little bit too much here IMO. if one uses (ad nauseam :-) ) this way of thinking then simply by extrapolating almost nothing in any modern or ancient indoeuropean language is derived from latin or greek or sanskrit or ... but only from protoindoeuropean.<br />
as for artemision vs artemisium ,of course artemisium is correct per se being latinised greek.but in the context of the post by the user above (Ikokki?),at least as I understand it , one ,if not one who speaks greek or latin,might think that the two words represent-symbolise different "things" although they are just two forms of the same word.<br />

<p>There's a slight contradiction in the article concerning the force the Spartans sent. In one sentence we say it was the King's Personal bodyguard, and in the next that he only took men who had already fathered sons. Now, this is because he disbanded his bodyguard (traditionally form of the elite young soldiers in their early twenties) and reformed it with older soldiers. As it is the article looks like it contradicts itself, even if it actually doesn't.<br />
We should change the wording, yes? --Orias 11:20, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p><i>You have to remember that back in this time period people didnt live long, they had children young, grew up fast.It was a hard time and thus a man in his twenties was ,yes young by our standards, but was a full blown adult back then.--24.119.202.84 20:37, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</i></p>
<p>Uh, nope. For a start to serve on the spartan council you had to be 60 (or 65, I forget), the active military was between 20 and 30. You could marry aged 20, but again could not live with your wife and family until aged 30. Indeed you were also not considered a full citizen until you reached that age either. Your point is not entirely invalid, but the fact is that the king's bodyguard was of the very best of the fresh (ie. very early twenties and unlikely to have children) trainees, and Leonidas disbanded his usual entourage to replace them with older ones all of which had children. --Orias 20:56, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That doesn't answer the question. Is Herotodus accurate, and no messengers were sent before the battle because the Athenians and Spartans had earlier killed the messengers of Darius? Or were messengers sent to Athens and Sparta before the battle of Thermopylae? If so, were they killed?

<p>Someone needs to change the Spartan causalities to say 299. As I understand it Leonidas summoned 300 men making him have an army of 301. Then 2 men left the battle from those 301 and were not killed making 299 Spartans killed.</p>

<p>I've read somewhere on wikipedia, it was prob this article, that if the Persians did win the battle and the war then democracy would have been destroyed and replaced by Persian monarchy. hence this battle was the most post important to our modern civilization because the spartans managed to defend the earliest development of democracy, free speech and liberty, no matter how far away from our modern standards, from authoritarian imperialist, xerxes 1. i was just wondering where has that bit of thinking gone? i remember that the idea outlined above had citation in couple of history books so i dont think it should have been deleted. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGregLoutsenko_9ea1.html" title="User:GregLoutsenko">GregLoutsenko</a> (<a href="../../../g/r/e/User_talk%7EGregLoutsenko_4df1.html" title="User talk:GregLoutsenko">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_GregLoutsenko_a67a.html" title="Special:Contributions/GregLoutsenko">contribs</a>) 22:19, 20 March 2007 (UTC).</small></p>

<dd>Well, it is sort of true for the war as a whole, but this particular battle was among armies that had little interest in democracy. Besides, democracy, or anyway a rough approximation like the kind that appeared in some places in Greece at this time, popped up elsewhere including Rome without much reference to Athens or Greece. Perhaps the point you are trying to make should go in another article, such as <a href="../../../d/e/m/Democracy.html" title="Democracy">Democracy</a> or <a href="../../../g/r/a/Graeco-Persian_Wars_597f.html" title="Graeco-Persian Wars">Graeco-Persian Wars</a> or <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_Greece_e4c9.html" title="Ancient Greece">Ancient Greece</a>, but a battle article is usually about the battle, not the war. American slavery, or Russian Communism, for example, should be mentioned in an article about the civil wars that destroyed the former and established the latter, but not in one about the taking of Vicksburg or Kiev, which should concentrate on immediate and technical questions. <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJim.henderson_0161.html" title="User:Jim.henderson">Jim.henderson</a> 23:48, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The Spartans lost this battle, so I guess democracy must have been destroyed for ever.

<dd>pndapetzin, what i was refering to was the fact that because the persians lost so many men at the battle and were so demoralised they were never quite the same after the battle. the spartans were there to hold the persians up not to destroy them. and i would disagree with your harsh description of spartan life. their customs were different from ours. lets just say that if i had to choose whether to live under the persians in the acient world or athenes, with a pan greek army for protection i would gladly choose the later.</dd>

<p>This is totally wrong, the Spartans did NOT believe in democracy,they were ruled by a small aristocracy making them more of a Fascist government.The Persians WERE enlightened basically all the Persians demanded of their conquered enemies was a tax.

<p>PLEASE, Wikipedia is NPOV. Wikipedia does not express the concessus reached at Cambridge or at Athens or Tehran, it expresses all POVs by all authors without taking position. To have a 50,000-100,000 estimate on the warbox destroys Wikipedia's neutrality, express everything. There ARE authors who accept Ctesias' 800,000 number as realistic, others who think it was more like 400,000, others that say it was 200,000, there was even a Turk who claimed it was only 18,000 Persians that accompanied Xerxes. Because every source one has read claim there were only 50-100,000 Persian combattants with Xerxes that does not mean that he has the right to change the warbox no more than I have the right to change it to 400,000 to 2,000,000. Please respect that and do not POV-push the size debate. And BTW IMO we do not need an extra article discussing the number of the troops at Thermopylae since there is an article already that does that: <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greco-Persian_Wars_ae8f.html" title="Greco-Persian Wars">Greco-Persian Wars</a> especially if it is to be split into campaigns as I have suggested.

<p>Typically for infoboxes, this field becomes the subject of extensive POV-pushing. The 15,000 is just laughable, we might as well say that the battle is a product of Greek mythology. Any figure that doesn't meet modern consensus should be avoided, and that includes mainly figures lower than 100,000 and higher than a certain figure.

<p>No problems with the dates given, there just seems to be a logic problem. In the opening paragraph the date of the battle is given as 480BC. Then under "Greek Preparations" it is implied that the Athenians knew that a smaller force could hold off a larger force, by referencing a battle that occurred 130 years AFTER the Battle of Thermopylae.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some have argued that the Athenians were confident that a small Greek force led by Leonidas would be enough to hold back the Persians; otherwise, they would have already vacated their city and sent their whole army to Thermopylae.[10] There is one known case in which a small force did stop a larger invading force from the north: in 353 BC/352 BC the Athenians managed to stop the forces of Philip II of Macedon by deploying 5,000 hoplites and 400 horsemen.[13]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Did I misread this? If it is just an example of another David-vs-Goliath-type battle, that's cool. It just seems to read as if the Athenians had crystal balls. It's probably better if a regular editor fix this ambiguity. -- <a href="../../../b/a/k/User%7EBakarocket_213d.html" title="User:Bakarocket">Bakarocket</a> 11:59, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I just reverted to an older version because Jagger 85's edits had massacred the article. Not only did he remove sourced meterial, but he also changed the numbers provided in various sources to those that pleased him the most - this could be possibly identified as vandalism. My revert removed various references concerning the Persian armies under "other views". Although this removal was an accident, I think it is a good idea. The article should stick to the most mainstream views and avoid extreme ones e.g. estimates lower than 100,000 and higher than 500,000. Otherwise the section simply won't make any sense. The current version of the section describes in detail what academic consensus thinks, there's no reason to complicate things by adding every individual view we can find. If someone disagrees with the consensus mention in the section then please do find a source which states otherwise.

This alleged consensus is the result of your own original research.

You can't just draw conclusions based on your hand-picked sources (which clearly do NOT meet consensus) and present them as a consensus. The reference you presented as a "consensus" view does not have one single google result<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;client=opera&amp;rls=en&amp;hs=G8f&amp;q=%22Thoughts+on+the+Reliability+of+Classical+Writers%22&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;client=opera&amp;rls=en&amp;hs=G8f&amp;q=%22Thoughts+on+the+Reliability+of+Classical+Writers%22&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>.

<dd>I'm going to revert your edits, because I thought they were quite outrageous in my opinion. I suspect you may be POV-pushing for an agenda, because not only did you revert my edits, but you even went as far as to remove all the dozens of scholarly evidence I've provided which clearly point to Persian numbers below 100,000. Although Ikokki also disagreed with my earlier edits, his response above in <a href="#Numbers_in_the_warbox_AGAIN" title="">#Numbers in the warbox AGAIN</a> was a lot more reasonable, and I probably agree with him that Wikipedia is not the place to be POV-pushing no matter how ridiculously large some of the Persian estimates might be.

Then again I've been editing this article since long before you watched a hollywood movie.

You didn't answer any of my querries regarding your "sources" with zero google result.

<dd>The idea of 50-100,000 I find absurd. Why pile up food in Europe for 10 years to feed them? Why build up <b>two</b> bridges to have them cross the Hellespont? Why dig a canal in Athos? Why split them in three columns when they marched across Thrace considering that the 80,000 of Mardonius proved a vulnerable target to night attck by Vrygians? Why not send them on the fleet, they definitely fit if they were that few. Most absurdly of all, since the Greeks did manage to gather 110,000 in Plataea and another 40,000 were campaining in the Aegean why invade with so few. Thucydides who double and triple checked his numbers talks of a 150,000 men Thracian invasion in Macedon in book II paragraph 99. The 100,000 limit for pre-modern armies is too artificial. <a href="../../../p/r/o/Procopius.html" title="Procopius">Procopius</a> who had access to the official archives talks of a 140,000 men Byzantine invasian force sent by Leo the Thracian that failed to conquer the Vandal kingdom. But my opinion is irrelevant in Wikipedia. There is a large number of repectable historians who argued that there were 300,000 Persians at Plataea and thus there were more invading earlier with Xerxes.

<p>I have _never_ yet run into a source which claims that mainstream views places the Persian numbers at 50,000-100,000. Jagged's sources for that alleged consensus were a book which gives "zero" results in a web search. Also Stecchini's website, even if we were to regard it representative of consensus, it talks about the force that came with Xerxes from the Asia and the one that was assembled at Thermopylea, there's a huge different. But in any case, Stecchini himself supports a 350K figure a Thermopylae, so Jagged 85's claims become moot. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiskin_55d1.html" title="User:Miskin">Miskin</a> 11:26, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>In brief, Jagged 85 cites unreliable 19th century sources that he hasn't even verified himself. He got them from Stecchini's website, ignoring the fact that its authors argue for a figure of 350,000. There's no question about "consensus" here, there's only a question about including unreliable sources which supports extreme views (too high or too low), or sticking to the credible mainstream opinions.

<p>Boss, your accusations are laughable. Like I said 10 times already, there are at least two <b>modern</b> sources already linked in the article that speak of a "general consensus". They have been there for a long time, until you came and modified their content to your personal "assumptions". If you think that the consensus provided is original research then I invite you to follow <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> procedures and verify the sources linked in the reference tags. Until you have done so, do not revert again. Your sources are old and outdated and did not reflect any consensus in the first place, this is your personal conslusion, i.e. original research. Some of them do not get any google results, please read <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a> to get an idea on credible references. All your information comes from a website which support <b>the opposite</b> from what you're trying to prove here. Stecchini article talks about the army crossing the Hellespont, not the army assembled at Thermopylae, please do read my answers every now and then. Also the author supports a figure of 350,000, so citing this cite is rather as a source for lower numbers is manipulatory and desperate.

<p>To make it easier for you: The Cambridge companion to Herodotus (linked in the article) speaks about a consensus of 210,000, based on Herotodus' calculation error (already detailed in the article). The Greek and Persian Wars 499-386 by Philip De Souza claims a consensus of nearly 200,000 as well. Literally all modern sources, many of which are already linked in the article, speak about a consensus around 200,000. It's time you stopped replacing those figures with your personal POV. Figures lower than 100,000 are as unpopular and outdated as figures over 500,000, so I suggest avoiding them both. The 15,000 figure is just laughable, If we are to mention this then we might as well stick to 2,000,000 or claim that the battle might be product of Greek mythology (actually suggested by extremists). <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiskin_55d1.html" title="User:Miskin">Miskin</a> 02:15, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I've read the <i>Cambridge Companion to Herodotus</i> and it does not speak of any consensus among scholars agreeing on 210,000, but just gives 210,000 as a likely figure. Consensus is not just a few scholars giving their own estimates, but an actual <b>agreement</b> among many scholars on certain estimates, which the <i>Cambridge Companion to Herodotus</i> does not mention. On the other hand, Stecchini specifically stated that there is a <b>substantial agreement</b> among many scholars (which he gave a list of) for figures between 50,000 to 100,000. Now that is certainly a <b>consensus</b>. For someone like Stecchini who is arguing for larger numbers to actually state something like that in itself shows that the consensus (up to the late 20th century) is 50,000 to 100,000. Most of the references I gave was from his research paper. Are you suggesting Stecchini is a liar giving false references? If so, why would someone who is actually arguing for larger numbers want to give false references supporting his <b>opposition</b>? If Stecchini can be considered reliable, then so can his references. Now I haven't yet got hold of de Souza's book yet, but when I do, I'll get back to you on it. Although I doubt it will mention anything about a consensus (like you tried to suggest with the Cambridge reference), I'll take your word for it that there is a consensus among other scholars who agree on 200,000 (for now). If that is the case, then both consenses should be presented in the article as two schools of thought, which the article was already doing before you reverted it. Anyway, I'll try to rewrite the article presenting all three schools of thought. If you disagree on anything, why don't you at least try to co-operate and actually <b>edit</b> the parts you disagree with instead of just reverting everything to suit your own POV?

The guy supports a figure of 350,000 at Thermopylae and admits a consensus of &gt;100K crossing into Greece, so either he's trying to look stupid, or you haven't understood what he said. I'll cite quotes from different sources which explicitely specify the "consensus" on the topic, although the most popular view does rest on the error of the calculations. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiskin_55d1.html" title="User:Miskin">Miskin</a> 12:00, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I wouldn't have reverted you if you had actually taken the time to consider the reference tags provided in the article before replacing their content with your POV. It really is ironic that after such poor editing and sourcing you call those edits a POV. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiskin_55d1.html" title="User:Miskin">Miskin</a> 12:02, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Also I couldn't help but noticing that you chose the sources from Stecchini's site selectively, ignoring the fact that Sctecchini roots for a 300,000 figure. Some of them are even manipulated, and I'm planning to correct this soon. The Cambridge guy to Herodotus does not mention the word "consensus" but it does present 210K as the most popular view, as do many others. Souza speaks of a consensus between 150K-200K and other sources linked in the article about 180K. Souza ellaborates on why Xerxes lead a massive army in person, imitating the likes of Cyrus and Darius, the book is not available to me right now otherwise I'd quote directly. Steccchini whom you've been constantly quoting has brought up many sources which support higher numbers than 200K, without refusing the initial 50-100K figure crossing the Hellespont. Please become more familiar with the actual historical event before passing judgement. After the army crossed into Europe it received substantial reinforcements. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiskin_55d1.html" title="User:Miskin">Miskin</a> 12:37, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Where was the personal attack boss? This ranting is called "discussion", as opposed to disruptive editing. I'm amused by your selective edits, you hand-picked Stecchini's citations which mentions numbers equal or lower than 100K, completely ignoring Stecchini's point of view, along with his citation on larger numbers. Ludicrous figures of 15,000 will be removed. You are trying to imply a fake consensus by naming all scholars you can find who have given the numbers you prefer. Those are manipulative edits for a topic which is by definition controversial, implying a non-existent consensus. I'm going to add more sources from Stecchini's article when I've got more time to spend.

<dd>Dude, you're still not finished arguing yet? Wow, you really are persistent (but still amusing). Once again, Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, not a publisher of original thought.

<p>Please do not quote policies that you have clearly not understood yourself. Your POV-pushing and poor understanding of the sources and the subject at hand nearly massacred the article. You put the figure of 15,000 in the infobox for crying out loud, you might as well add a "Science Fiction" category to the article. I'm of the opinion that in controversial topics the consensus view should take precedence and minority views of both extremes should be ignored. I didn't try to favour any POV, I was willing to remove both extreme figures (high and low) and stick to the consensus of 200K. The problem is that what you considered too high a figure, happened to be the consensus of western scholarship, i.e. what wikipedia labels 'credible'. I could flood the section (as you did) with countless sources supporting 150-300K but this would be silly since the currect consensus is already mentioned. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiskin_55d1.html" title="User:Miskin">Miskin</a> 13:18, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sorry but that does not sound like a discussion, but a blatant personal attack. You're just sounding more immature with each response you make. I don't care what you think of me, nor do I care what your opinion is. EVERY POV will be mentioned here, regardless of whether you think its much higher or much lower than your "consensus". In fact, I think I'll just stop responding to you and just let you have the last word if that makes you feel happy. <a href="../../../j/a/g/User%7EJagged_85_b01d.html" title="User:Jagged 85">Jagged 85</a> 13:34, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I actually spoke to a Professor of mine a few days ago on this very subject, he claims that the consensus at Thermopylae is of around 200,000 troops. Persians and other Asians are just bitter because Alexander delivered the Hellenic revenge (we hellenes will always gain vengeance on our enemies - never forget this) on them.</p>

<dd>Jagged 85 before complaining about the edits I'm going to make, please consult <a href="../../../u/n/d/WP%7EUNDUE_5fa0.html" title="WP:UNDUE">WP:UNDUE</a> in order to get a better understanding of the NPOV policy. There are already two sources in the article claiming a general consensus near 200,000 (not including the Cambridge guide to Herodotus). What you're doing by adding so many individual sources which support your POV, while intentionally ignoring other sources from Stecchini's article, <i>including</i> Stecchini's POV, falls under undue weigh. You're simply putting emphasis on a minority view by trying to introduce terms such as "Western consensus" vs "global consensus" etc. I'll give you some times to improve the neutrality of all those edits and adjust it to NPOV and <a href="../../../u/n/d/WP%7EUNDUE_5fa0.html" title="WP:UNDUE">WP:UNDUE</a>. If you fail to do so I'll proceed with the adjustments myself, and if you keep POV-pushing and reverting I'll ask for a third opinion. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiskin_55d1.html" title="User:Miskin">Miskin</a> 14:14, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Actually I just realised that you selectively restored information on my initial revert. You chose to create a large section on the vies of your POV but left out many of Ikkoki's sources on larger numbers, i.e. the opposite view. Furthermore I removed all undue weigh put on non-consensus and minority views <b>including</b> suggestions on large figures, per <a href="../../../u/n/d/WP%7EUNDUE_5fa0.html" title="WP:UNDUE">WP:UNDUE</a>. There's no reason to have such a large section on something that can be explained in few lines. I also had a look at Britannica 2006's article, it treats the subject in literally one line. If you don't agree then I'm going to ask for a third opinion. If you decide to revert, I would advise you to restore all of kokki's previous edits that were removed during the reverted, and not selectively as you did last time. I would also advise you to include Stecchini's POV along with the modern scholars he cites. If despite this warning you fail to do so, it's just going to show to the mediator that NPOV is not exactly your priority. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiskin_55d1.html" title="User:Miskin">Miskin</a> 14:58, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>To the people involved in this article: Stecchini is arguing about <i>double</i> the normal Persian army (300,000 infantry + 50,000 cavalry= normal size) analysing the use of 2 bridges, the delay of the army for reaching Thermopylae and then Athens, the force left to Mardonius for Plataea and other parameters hence giving a fighting force of about 700,000 combatants. To that figure he adds (about) one non-combatant for each soldier thus suggesting a figure of about 1.4 million people. Just wanted to clear that out.</p>
<p>I am in the process of gathering literature (have access to 3 University libraries), so if you can recommend a good source please do so. In the mean time, if I can get access to the books cited as references, I will try to verify some figures. This article provides a very good analysis and decent, reliable sources for the Persian forces but others just simply lack 'sound' academic sources and instead 'rely' in websites or online bloggers with historical interests (e.g. N. Welman, eventhough I enjoy and value his writings). I do not dismiss them just because they publish their work on the web (after all we are in an online open project) but I would prefer to see cited articles published in reputable journals, books published by academic presses or other respectable/reliable publishing houses i.e. sources that went through scholarly, scrutinised peer review. After all, one can also use google.books and google.scholar...Regards --Zippocar (can not log-in)16:02, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hence why I removed all non-consensus views which violate the <a href="../../../u/n/d/WP%7EUNDUE_5fa0.html" title="WP:UNDUE">WP:UNDUE</a> concept of the NPOV policy. Most of those sources are old and outdated, and their view is already mentioned in the article, there's no reason to flood the section with handpicked sources of questionable credibility. Besides, all of that info is already POV-pushed in <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greco-Persian_War_a717.html" title="Greco-Persian War">Greco-Persian War</a>. I would prefer to keep the emphasis on larger figures restricted as well, for the time being it has only provoked POV-pushing similar to jabber's. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiskin_55d1.html" title="User:Miskin">Miskin</a> 17:31, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>To editors: Please stop adding hand-picked, outdated sources which give undue weigh to a certain POV. As you can see I removed <i>both</i> sources which support non-consensus views, including modern views such as Stecch's. We don't need to list individual names of scholars, it can only become subject to POV-pushing. Plus we shouldn't be repeating information from other articles. I won't allow one view to be favoured over the others, such as for example ignoring Stecchini's view and using his refercing in such a manipulative manner. For a non-consensus view to receive special treatment, it needs to be proved explicitely. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiskin_55d1.html" title="User:Miskin">Miskin</a> 22:03, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Also concerning this edit: "<i>Not wishing to be delayed by having to carry out a full-scale assault, Hydarnes resorted to a tactic that later turned out to be a victorious one: he fired showers of arrows at them</i>". Such claims cannot stay in an article without a reference. As you said it jabber, wp is not a publisher of original thought, it's time to pass from theory to practice. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiskin_55d1.html" title="User:Miskin">Miskin</a> 22:32, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Your comment is ridiculous! Talk about outdated, why is Herodotus in this article then? Not only are his figures, according to modern scholars, heavily exaggerated, but Herodotus is known to be highly biased. I will readd my <b>sourced</b> information in the future. The only POV pushing is when people try to keep out information they obviously do not like. And I listed the names of the scholars to make it more NPOV, incase someone like you tried to do what your doing right now, but evidently, that didnt stop you. Also, I dont understand what your talking about when you say "non-consensus" view. Most scholars generally accept the 100-200 thousand figure, but as this article includes figures well above 200,000, its only fair to also show figures that estimate the numbers below 100,000. Make this article neutral by either removing all mention of the estimates above 200,000, or leave in the estimates that are below 100,000. <b>Remember, this is all by your logic, dont be a hypocrite.</b><a href="../../../a/z/e/User%7EAzerbaijani_f7b7.html" title="User:Azerbaijani">Azerbaijani</a> 00:25, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I re-added the sourced information which you took out. Your argument makes no sense. Again, the generally accepted figure today is 100 thousand to 200 thousand, if your going to show figures above 200,000, then you must also be willing to show figures below 100,000, its only fair! Either show all of them or none of them. Not to mention, all the sources giving figures above 200,000 are also outdated and also stray from the general consensus of modern scholars! See Wikipedia NPOV, if you cannot keep neutral on such an issue, then I suggest you leave the editing to other users.
