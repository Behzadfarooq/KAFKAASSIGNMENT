<p>The second JJBA series takes place in the <a href="../../../1/9/3/1930s.html" title="1930s">1930s</a>, and follows the misadventures of <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joseph_Joestar_4e7e.html" title="Joseph Joestar"><b>Jo</b>seph <b>Jo</b>estar</a>, the grandson of Jonathan Joestar, as he fights <a href="../../../v/a/m/Vampire.html" title="Vampire">vampires</a> and ancient super beings with some help from a <a href="../../../c/y/b/Cyborg.html" title="Cyborg">cybernetically-enhanced</a> <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazism.html" title="Nazism">Nazi</a> and an <a href="../../../i/t/a/Italian_people.html" title="Italian people">Italian</a> man he has a lot in common with.</p>
<p>Joseph lives in New York with his grandmother Erina and seems to have inherited the power of hamon (the ripple), as he has a natural ability to use it. When old family friend Speedwagon is reported dead (or missing) in Mexico, Joseph takes it on himself to go check it out. His curiosity is piqued when he is attacked in New York City by an old friend turned vampire. When he goes to Mexico he discovers a secret underground Nazi facility where the Nazis are trying to revive a man who seems to have been trapped in a stone pillar for 2,000 years. Here Joseph meets the Nazi Stroheim (whose character design is said by many to have influenced <a href="../../../c/a/p/Capcom.html" title="Capcom">Capcom</a> when they created <a href="../../../g/u/i/Guile_%28Street_Fighter%29_a924.html" title="Guile (Street Fighter)">Guile</a>, though Dire from Series 1 also looks similar to him).</p>
<p>Unfortunately the Nazis are successful in awakening the man, who is christened "<a href="../../../c/a/r/Carlos_Santana_e8e5.html" title="Carlos Santana">Santana</a>" before he kills most of them. Joseph and Stroheim battle Santana and manage to defeat him, though Stroheim is fatally wounded.</p>
<p>Joseph then heads to Rome, where three more "sleeping pillar men" have been discovered. In Rome, Joseph meets Caesar Zeppeli, a trained hamon user near his age who is supposed to show Joseph the ropes. Before they can do anything besides arguing (Caesar Zeppeli is a descendant of the top hat wearing, wine drinking mentor of Jonathan Joestar. Caesar blames Jonathan Joestar for killing his grand father with his incompetence), they find themselves present when the three sleeping men awaken after their 2,000 year nap. These creatures are something like vampire gods; it turns out that they created the stone mask that turned Dio into a vampire. These three are named <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wham%21.html" title="Wham!">Wham</a>, <a href="../../../a/c/2F/AC_DC_2284.html" title="AC/DC">ACDC</a>, and <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Cars_c8c8.html" title="The Cars">Cars</a>, and their goal is to find the "Red Stone of Asia," which, used with a stone mask, will allow them to become ultimate life forms.</p>
<p>They are extremely powerful; untrained Joseph doesn't stand a chance. Luckily, he manages to talk them out of killing him. Wham and ACDC both end up giving Joseph "wedding rings" which are internal time bombs set to release poison into his blood if he doesn't defeat them within a month. Joseph realizes that he'll have to train or he's going to die, and Caesar introduces Joseph to his master, the beautiful (and extremely talented) <a href="../../../l/i/s/Lisa_Lisa_and_Cult_Jam_369e.html" title="Lisa Lisa and Cult Jam">Lisa Lisa</a>.</p>
<p>However, before the month is up, ACDC finds out that Lisa Lisa has the Red Stone of Asia and comes to take it. Joseph uses his new skills to defeat ACDC, thus earning the wrath of Wham and Cars (who previously thought of him as an amusement rather than a threat).</p>
<p>While on pursuit Joseph is reunited with the supposedly-deceased Stroheim, who has been rebuilt by Nazi science as a powerful cyborg, but Stroheim's machine body is quickly cut in half by Cars, who uses the "light mode" (a blade that extends from his arm spins so fast that it reflects light in irregular fashion giving the illusion of a glowing sword). In Switzerland the group discovers the location of Wham and Cars. Knowing Wham and Cars' vulnerability to sunlight, everyone is eager to face them during the day except JoJo. Caesar can't accept this and Joseph and Caesar fight.</p>
<p>Apparently Caesar's father disappeared during his youth, growing up as a thug hating his father, he later finds him. Caesar is eager to kill his father who has abandoned him, but to his surprise Caesar's dad didn't go out to enjoy himself. Following his father to the base of the <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colosseum.html" title="Colosseum">Colosseum</a> where the three monster sleep, Caesar tries to touch a gem that is embedded in the wall. To his surprise, his father pushes him out of the way and saves Caesar from the wall's trap. Caesar's father is quickly consumed by the flesh of the monsters in their dormant form and leaves a final message to him, telling him to inform Lisa Lisa that the three monsters in the wall will awaken soon.</p>
<p>Disregarding the warnings Caesar approaches the mansion where Wham and Cars are residing. Caesar is soon greeted by Wham and they fight. It appears that Caesar has the advantage as he nearly fries Wham with ripple and refracted sun light, but Wham quickly counters his attack with his "holy sand storm" and Caesar loses his ability to use the ripple. When Wham, satisfied with the victory, tries to leave, Caesar jumps up and tears out his lip piercing that contains the antidote to JoJo's poison ring. Before he dies from being crushed by a stone slab, Caesar uses his final ripple to make a bubble out of his blood containing the antidote ring. Wham sees this but, respecting Caesar as a valiant warrior, he lets the bubble float away. When Joseph and Lisa Lisa arrive too late JoJo finds the bubble and vows not to drink the antidote until he personally has beaten Wham.</p>
<p>Joseph then defeats Wham in a deadly chariot race and the final showdown against Cars begins. First, keeping his promise, he fights the beautiful Lisa Lisa and though he promised to fight her one-on-one, he lies and sacrifices one of his weaker Vampires and is able to defeat her. Angered by Cars' trickery, Joseph then challenges Cars who looks upon Joseph as weak Ripple user and not even worth fighting seriously. It all seems to be over in this fight against Cars until Stroheim(who has once again been brought back to life because of Nazi Science) and the Nazis, Speedwagon, and Smokey arrive to help Joseph. It is here that the reader also finds out that Lisa Lisa is also the biological mother of Joseph. After using the powers of Ultra violet rays of light it seems that Cars has been killed and the world has been saved. But all is not as it seems. Cars was not only able to place on a stone mask that he had been hiding on his person, but fused with the powers of the Red Stone of Asia, Cars becomes the Ultimate Life form. Now Joseph and the group are frantically trying to think of a way to be this so called Unbeatable lifeform and it seems that victory has once again arrived in Joseph's hands when he is able to send Cars inside an active Volcano. But the fight was still not over. Cars was able to cover himself in an armor made of rock and protect himself from the molten lava. It looked like this would be the gruesome end of not only the Joestar's but the world itself, until the volcano erupts and sends both Joseph and Cars flying. Cars is sent into space and though he tries to fly back down to Earth to finish the job, a defense mechanism of his kicks in, freezing his body solid making him unable to travel back to Earth. The battle was finally over and Joseph was able to save the world from Cars' evil.</p>
<p>Weeks later the group of Erina, Lisa Lisa, Messina, Smokey, and Speed Wagon pay their respects as they have a funeral for the assumed to be dead Joseph Joestar, but to their surprise Joseph wasn't dead! After falling back down from the sky he ends up in Italy where he is helped by some local fisherman. After finding and marrying Lisa Lisa's assistant, Suzie Q he returns back to America to find his friends. (Though he is annoyed to find that Suzy had not send them the message that he was still alive.) After all the loose ends are accounted for and the lives of the characters are explained, Part 2 ends with the now aged Joseph at a Japanese air port which leads us to the next part in the JoJo's Bizarre Adventure Series.</p>
<p>Parts one and two are heavily influenced by the manga <a href="../../../f/i/s/Fist_of_the_North_Star_d744.html" title="Fist of the North Star">Fist of the North Star</a>.</p>
