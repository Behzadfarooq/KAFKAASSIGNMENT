<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Hansan_Island_3f4d.html" title="Edit section: Prelude">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Prelude</span></h2>
<p>Admiral Yi Sun Shin, along with the small fleet of seven ships of Admiral <a href="../../../w/o/n/Won_Kyun_f0c1.html" title="Won Kyun">Won Kyun</a>, had fought two campaigns across the southern coast of Korea. Admiral <a href="../../../y/i/_/Yi_Eok_Ki_d39e.html" title="Yi Eok Ki">Yi Eok Ki</a> joined Admirals Yi and Won for the third campaign. In all, the Koreans sank over 100 Japanese ships and inflicted thousands of casualties. Admiral Yi and the combined Korean fleet did not lose any ships and suffered only 11 killed and 26 wounded up to this point.</p>
<p>Given the importance that the Japanese navy had in supplying the army as it advanced along the Korean peninsula and prepared to invade China, <a href="../../../t/o/y/Toyotomi_Hideyoshi_ab20.html" title="Toyotomi Hideyoshi">Toyotomi Hideyoshi</a> made it absolutely imperative to his commanders that the naval situation must be brought under control, the Korean fleets destroyed and the supply routes through the Yellow Sea secured. The Japanese commander, <a href="../../../w/a/k/Wakizaka_Yasuharu_507b.html" title="Wakizaka Yasuharu">Wakizaka Yasuharu</a>, was ordered to wait and combine his fleet with the forces of <a href="../../../k/a/t/Kat%C5%8D_Yoshiaki_6d8a.html" title="Katō Yoshiaki">Katō Yoshiaki</a> and <a href="../../../k/u/k/Kuki_Yoshitaka_f56a.html" title="Kuki Yoshitaka">Kuki Yoshitaka</a> to seek out and destroy the Korean fleet. However, it would have taken some time for Katō and Kuki to assemble their ships, so Wakizaka went out alone with 73 ships. Wakizaka's fleet probably had the best war ships fielded by the Japanese up to that point in the war. Out of the 73 ships, 36 were the large multi-decked <a href="../../../a/t/a/Atakebune.html" title="Atakebune">atakebune</a>, 24 the medium sized seki bune and 13 small kobaya scout ships.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Admiral Yi was planning a third campaign and worked with Admirals Won and Yi Eok Ki in combined operations and practiced arranging their fleets in a "crane's wing" battle formation. The formation was often used on land, but not normally used at sea. The combined fleets had a total of 54 <a href="../../../p/a/n/Panokseon.html" title="Panokseon">panokseons</a> and 2 or 3 <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turtle_ship.html" title="Turtle ship">turtle ships</a>.</p>

<p>Admiral Yi received intelligence from a local farmer that a large Japanese fleet (Wakizaka's ships) was making its way west towards him and was anchored north of the Kyonnaeryang Strait, a narrow channel between <a href="../../../k/o/j/Koje_Island_fa62.html" title="Koje Island">Koje Island</a> and the mainland.</p>
<p>On August 14th, the next morning, Admiral Yi sent out six panokson battle ships through the channel to lure out Wakizaka's fleet. Wakizaka took the bait and his ships chased Yi's six panoksons through the channel and into the broad open sea in front of Hansan Island. At this time, Admiral Yi began to arrange the fleet in the crane wing formation.</p>
<p><a name="The_crane_wing_formation" id="The_crane_wing_formation"></a></p>
<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Hansan_Island_3f4d.html" title="Edit section: The crane wing formation">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The crane wing formation</span></h4>
<p>In the two previous campaigns, the Koreans had either met the Japanese ships in a straight battle line or, if space was limited, with a circular or rolling method of attack, where their ships attacked in relays to sustain a continuous bombardment. Although these tactics were effective, considerable numbers of Japanese had escaped and swum ashore. The crane wing formation was designed to not just sink ships, but to annihilate the enemy without losing a lot of men.</p>
<p>The formation itself resembled a "U" shape, with the heaviest battleships in the center and lighter ships on the wings. Reserves were placed behind the central ships and would plug gaps as the formation expanded. Ships at the front of the formation would face broadsides to maximize the number of cannons that would be aimed at the enemy. Furthermore, the "U" shape itself would allow for interlocking fields of fire so that many Japanese ships would be <a href="../../../e/n/f/Enfilade_and_defilade.html" title="Enfilade and defilade">enfiladed</a> and hit from several angles. In this sense the Crane Wing formation shared similarities with the late 19th and early 20th century battleship tactic of '<a href="../../../c/r/o/Crossing_the_T_be2d.html" title="Crossing the T">Crossing the T</a>'.</p>
<p>The Japanese tactic was to put their fastest ships in the vanguard to keep the Korean ships occupied, then move their larger ships rapidly to close in, grapple, and board the Korean ships. However, this tactic played right into Admiral Yi's plan, as the Japanese rowed deeper into the trap. The volume and range of Korean cannon fire prevented the Japanese from employing their favorite tactic and the two wings of the crane formation would envelope, surround and finally have the effect of "crowding in" the Japanese ships, making it difficult to manuever or retreat and "packing" in the ships and present an easier target for Korean cannons.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Hansan_Island_3f4d.html" title="Edit section: Second phase of the battle">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Second phase of the battle</span></h3>
<p>Wakizaka Yasuharu was a highly aggressive commander and one of the legendary "<a href="../../../s/e/v/Seven_Spears_of_Shizugatake_4b24.html" title="Seven Spears of Shizugatake">Seven Spears of Shizugatake</a>," having gained fame in the battle that solidified Hideyoshi's claim to be <a href="../../../o/d/a/Oda_Nobunaga_1fea.html" title="Oda Nobunaga">Oda Nobunaga</a>'s successor. It is clear from his tactics in the Battle of Hansan Island that Wakizaka tried to get as close as possible to the Korean ships so he can grapple and board them. Wazikaka not only followed the six Korean ships through the Kyonnaeryang Strait with his entire fleet of 73 ships, but pressed as quickly as possible into the center of the crane wing formation, oblivious to the fact that he was exposing his ships to the Korean fleet's concentrated firepower.</p>
<p>The battle continued from the mid-morning to the late afternoon. Some boarding of Japanese ships by the Koreans did take place, but Admiral Yi only allowed it if the ship was already crippled and damaged. Commanders Wakizaka Sabei and Watanabe Shichi'emon were killed. Commander Manabe Samanosuke committed <a href="../../../s/e/p/Seppuku.html" title="Seppuku">seppuku</a> aboard his burning, sinking ship. Wakizaka Yasuharu himself was hit by several arrows, but none penetrated his armor. After losing 59 ships, Wakizaka abandoned his flagship and boarded a faster, lighter ship. In total, 14 Japanese ships were able to retreated from the immediate area of the battle. However, many of the surviving ships were damaged so badly that they had to be abandoned in some of the surrounding islands that dotted the southern Korean coast. Only a few ships ever made it back to the Japanese base at <a href="../../../p/u/s/Pusan.html" title="Pusan">Pusan</a> Harbor.</p>

<p>Admiral Yi's victory at Hansan Island effectively ended Hideyoshi's dreams of conquering <a href="../../../m/i/n/Ming_Dynasty_71f3.html" title="Ming Dynasty">Ming China</a>, which was his original goal in invading Korea. The supply routes through the Yellow Sea had to be open in order for his troops to have enough supplies and reinforcements to invade China. Thus, <a href="../../../k/o/n/Konishi_Yukinaga_059c.html" title="Konishi Yukinaga">Konishi Yukinaga</a>, the commander of the contingent of troops in <a href="../../../p/y/o/Pyongyang.html" title="Pyongyang">Pyongyang</a> could not move further north due to lack of supplies, nor could more troops be sent to him because there was not enough food to feed them. It took five times the resources in food and men to move supplies via the land route over Korea's primitive roads. Furthermore, moving supplies overland left them vulnerable to attacks by regular Chinese and Korean forces as well as Korean <a href="../../../i/r/r/Irregular_military.html" title="Irregular military">irregular</a> or <a href="../../../g/u/e/Guerrilla_warfare.html" title="Guerrilla warfare">guerrilla</a> forces (the <a href="../../../r/i/g/Righteous_army.html" title="Righteous army">Righteous Armies</a> 의병/義兵) that were becoming increasingly active as the war progressed.</p>
<p>After the battle of Hansan Island (and the battle of Angolpo shortly afterwards), Hideyoshi found it necessary to give a direct order to his naval commanders to cease all unnecessary naval operations and limit activity to the immediate area around Pusan Harbor. He told his commanders that he would come to Korea personally to lead the naval forces himself, but Hideyoshi was never able to carry through on this as his health was deteriorating rapidly.</p>
<p>The battle of Hansan Island was the most important battle of the Imjin War. It ensured that all the fighting would be in Korea, not China, and that Pyongyang would be the furthest northwestern advance of the Japanese armies (to be sure, <a href="../../../k/a/t/Kat%C5%8D_Kiyomasa_f28b.html" title="Katō Kiyomasa">Katō Kiyomasa</a>'s second contingent's brief march into <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manchuria.html" title="Manchuria">Manchuria</a> was Japan's northernmost advance, however, Manchuria was not a part of Imperial China in the 16th century). It can be argued that the battle was one of the most important in East Asian history up to that point. Had Hideyoshi been able to invade China and conquer a large part of it, his plans were to also invade the Philippines and other commercially important islands in the East and South China seas. Hideyoshi's larger war plans, supported in much written documentation, was nearly identical to <a href="../../../i/m/p/Imperial_Japan_dada.html" title="Imperial Japan">Imperial Japan</a>'s blue print for conquest in the second half of the 20th century.</p>

<p>George Alexander Ballard (1862–1948), a vice admiral of British <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Navy_80f7.html" title="Royal Navy">Royal Navy</a>, complimented Admiral Yi's winning streaks by the Battle of Hansando highly:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"This was the great Korean admiral's crowning exploit. In the short space of six weeks [<i>actually about 9 weeks, May 7, 1592 – July 7, 1592</i>] he had achieved a series of successes unsurpassed in the whole annals of maritime war, destroying the enemy's battle fleets, cutting his lines of communication, sweeping up his convoys, imperilling the situation of his victorious armies in the field, and bringing his ambitious schemes to utter ruin. Not even Nelson, Blake, or Jean Bart could have done more than this scarcely known representative of a small and cruelly oppressed nation; and it is to be regretted that his memory lingers nowhere outside his native land, for no impartial judge could deny him the right to be accounted among the born leaders of men."
