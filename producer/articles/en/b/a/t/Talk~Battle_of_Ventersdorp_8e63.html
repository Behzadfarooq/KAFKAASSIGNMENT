<p>I have cleaned up the article, but I doubt that it meet the criteria for a being a wikipedia article, in fact it comes pertty close to being a "soapbox" / "propoganda" article especially taking into account the original article's tone and references.</p>
<p>Some criticial changes I made:</p>
<ol>
<li><i>This is not a battle</i>, it does not meet the criteria for a battle and shouldn't be placed in the category of <i>Battles of South Africa</i>.</li>
<li>Clarifying the relevance.</li>

<dd>I would disagree, there was no 'tone' as you speak of, the fact is that the police were better armed, they had equipment provided by the South African government and the protesters had hunting rifles, pistols and wooden batons and home- made teargas. Also the police had attack dogs, please take a look at what the AWB uses/ used in it's conflicts, it's generally makeshift equipment, not to the standard of the police. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 82.20.2.133 (<a href="../../../8/2/2E/User_talk%7E82.20.2.133.html" title="User talk:82.20.2.133">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_82.20.2.133_d75d.html" title="Special:Contributions/82.20.2.133">contribs</a>) 19:55, 27 January 2007 (UTC).</small>

<p>I heard that the Boers were putting plaster of paris on their arms and legs to scale the barbed wire fences is it worth putting in the article, because I believe that at the Truth and Reconcilliation Commision the government cited this as the reason for killing the Boers.</p>
<p>By the way didn't they lock arms, I have some video footage on the Nick Broomfield film His Big White Self and they were locked in arms and kicking at the cameras.

<p>I watched the news report footage and the light- haired man who was carrying a bottle and locking arms with several other people and kicked at a camera was locking arms with, to his right, a man who by the looks of it was Indian or coloured, I can't make a definiate decision, if anyone else has <a href="../../../h/i/s/His_Big_White_Self_6f2e.html" title="His Big White Self">His Big White Self</a> like me then take a look and see if you agree. The man kicks at the camera and then half drags along another man in khaki and he looks non- white. It could tie in with the possibility that the AWB, despite being white supremacists, had coloured and Indian members. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_82.20.2.133_d75d.html" title="Special:Contributions/82.20.2.133">82.20.2.133</a> (<a href="../../../8/2/2E/User_talk%7E82.20.2.133.html" title="User talk:82.20.2.133">talk</a>) 19:55, 27 January 2007 (UTC).</small></p>

<p>Does anyone have any idea who the 3 people who died were? The incident was a big mess and the SAPS were very violent and so I think to an extent the South African government has tried to cover it up and stop people hearing about it too much.</p>

<p>I've looked at what qualifies as a battle on wikipedia and since this ended with people kicking dogs in the face, spraying teargas and the battle ended at 10.30 p.m. by which time over 4,000 people had been exchanging fire for several hours. To be honest considering that there was hundreds if not thousands of firearms being discharged it's quite amazing that only one man was killed from gunfire and that not more were injured.</p>
<p>Whatever you say it would have looked like and felt like a battle, how much more scary does it come? Thousands of people shooting guns blindly at each other into the night and no sign of it ending?</p>

<dd><b>Strongly disagree</b>. The term "battle" was only used by the media to sensationalize the event. This was not combat and it was not warfare and there weren't armies involved. You can't classify riots or crowd control problems (for example "soccer hooligans") as battles even though the media might use the term or even though many people might die. To call this a "battle" would be an insult to military forces everywhere. --<a href="../../../d/e/o/User%7EDeon_Steyn_e30c.html" title="User:Deon Steyn">Deon Steyn</a> 06:02, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm sorry but I disagree with you Deon, I think that it was a battle leading up to civil war, although the war part never actually happened. It wasn't just random hooliganism, they had a goal and it was to either disrupt the meeting and force DeKlerk out of Ventersdorp or to get inside of the meeting hall and make their voices heard or quite possibly assault people and 'trash the place' to be blunt, judging from their behaviour later on in the storming of the WTC in Johannesburg.</p>
<p>I think that it would be an insult to the policemen who were shot and the AWB members who were injured and especially to the legacy of and to the families of the 3 AWB members killed to say that they were killed in an incident of 'hooliganism'.</p>
<p>It involved military- style tactics, namely arming themselves with Doom insect repellent, firearms, gas masks (makeshift or genuine), sticks and particularly cutting the town's electricity. The men who went there had gone prepared for a battle, they had taken an item which they would attatch to their arm and use to stab police with (look at the page on arthurkemp.com regarding the Battle of Ventersdorp). According to the arthurkemp.com source they had set up a medical base in the AWB headquarters building, all of these are indicative of people preparing for a battle.</p>

<dd>It is a white supremacist AWB fantasy that they were a military force involved in a war and any attempt to portray them as such would be propaganda of a very dubious nature. There was no war, there were no armies, ergo there was no battle. There was a riot - well organized or not - dealt with by a police force. The <b>only</b> reason the term "battle" stuck is because it was in the media. --<a href="../../../d/e/o/User%7EDeon_Steyn_e30c.html" title="User:Deon Steyn">Deon Steyn</a> 07:02, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The article on the so called <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Goedgevonden_d647.html" title="Battle of Goedgevonden">Battle of Goedgevonden</a> should be merged into this one as it's not notable on it's own and relates to the background of this article. --<a href="../../../d/e/o/User%7EDeon_Steyn_e30c.html" title="User:Deon Steyn">Deon Steyn</a> 07:25, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Agreed 100%. The Goedgevonden incident was not notable enough for its own article. <a href="../../../z/a/i/User%7EZaian_7381.html" title="User:Zaian">Zaian</a> 07:40, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Disagree 100%. The Goedgevonden incident was entirely different, one was about removing squatters on farmer's land and one was about raiding a political meeting. The Goedgevonden incident involved local farmers and the Ventersdorp one involved people from all over South Africa and even some white Namibian farmers drove down. The Goedgevonden incident was entirely different in nature other than it was an AWB- backed protest/ riot, the Goedgevonden incident was primarily farmers destroying black shacks and attackings black squatters, attacks on the unarmed, whereas the AWB were outgunned in the Ventersdorp incident. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../b/o/v/User%7EBOV1993_bad2.html" title="User:BOV1993">BOV1993</a> (<a href="../../../b/o/v/User_talk%7EBOV1993_394a.html" title="User talk:BOV1993">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_BOV1993_8455.html" title="Special:Contributions/BOV1993">contribs</a>) 23:59, 23 February 2007 (UTC).</small></dd>

<dd>The Goedgevonden incident is so entirely non-notable, that it should either be delete or added to this page as some sort of footnote or background information. They involved publicity seeking stunts in the same small community, by the same AWB leaders. While I appreciate your efforts at adding content, your sole sources seem to be the completely biased white supremacist AWB. I suggest you start citing reliable references showing that this incident is noteworthy (see <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">Wikipedia:Reliable sources</a>). --<a href="../../../d/e/o/User%7EDeon_Steyn_e30c.html" title="User:Deon Steyn">Deon Steyn</a> 07:10, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

BOV1993 also hasn't provided independent references and has been blocked for unacceptable behaviour.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>My ban's been lifted, I'm editting under IP at the moment but I'll soon return with an account. I was wondering why you had classed the www.arthurkemp.com website with information concerning the 'Ventersdorp Incident' as biased? When even the BBC has a bias against the AWB.</p>

<p>Firstly the AWB hasn't been given a fair hearing on this article regarding the Goedgevonden incident, perhaps it should be more clear that they were forcing people <b>off their own property</b>, I agree that attacking the nearby township was uncalled for but this article doesn't stress how let- down by their own people the Boers felt by 1991.</p>
