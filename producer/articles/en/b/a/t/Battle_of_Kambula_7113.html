<p>Following the disaster at <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Hlobane_4933.html" title="Battle of Hlobane">Hlobane</a> on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_28.html" title="March 28">March 28</a>, Colonel <a href="../../../e/v/e/Evelyn_Wood_%28British_army_officer%29_b421.html" title="Evelyn Wood (British army officer)">Eveyln Wood’s</a> forces prepared to receive an attack by the entire <a href="../../../z/u/l/Zulu.html" title="Zulu">Zulu</a> <a href="../../../i/m/p/Impi.html" title="Impi">impi</a>, of which they had only previously encountered the leading sections. Soon after dawn of the 29th Transvaal Rangers rode out to locate the enemy impi, the cattle were put out to graze and, after some deliberation, two companies were despatched to collect firewood. By 11am the Rangers had returned with the news that the impi was on the move and was to attack Kambula at noon. Wood also now received information that the impi was nearly 25,000 men strong, consisting of regiments that had already defeated the British at <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Isandlwana_5822.html" title="Battle of Isandlwana">Isandlwana</a> and other battles and that many of the Zulus were armed with rifles taken from the British dead at these battles. Shortly after this the Zulu impi was sighted 5 miles away across the plain, coming on due westwards in five columns. The woodcutters and cattle were brought back in and, confident that the defences could be manned within a minute and a half of an alarm being sounded, Wood ordered the men to have their dinners.</p>

<p>The defences on Kambula consisted of a hexagonal laager formed with tightly locked together wagons, and a separate kraal for the cattle, constructed on the edge of the southern face of the ridge. Trenches and earth parapets surrounded both sections, and a stone-built redoubt had been built on a rise just north of the kraal. A palisade blocked the hundred yards between the kraal and redoubt, while four 7-pounders were positioned between the redoubt and the laager to cover the northern approaches. Two more guns in the redoubt covered the north-east also.</p>
<p>Two companies were sited in the redoubt; another company in the cattle kraal and the remaining infantry manned the laager. The gunners had been told that if the Zulus got in close they were to abandon their guns and make for the laager. In all, Wood’s force mustered 121 <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Artillery_85a7.html" title="Royal Artillery">Royal Artillery</a> and <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Engineers_bc48.html" title="Royal Engineers">Royal Engineers</a>, 1,238 infantry and 638 mounted men. With headquarters staff, it totaled 2,000 men, of which 88 were sick in hospital.</p>

<p>At 12.45 the tents were struck, reserve ammunition was distributed and the troops took up their battle stations. As the troops moved to their posts they could see the Zulu right horn, circling north out of British artillery range before halting north-west of the camp. The left horn and centre of the impi continued westwards until they were due south of Kambula. At 1.30 Lieutenant-Colonel <a href="../../../r/e/d/Redvers_Henry_Buller_284c.html" title="Redvers Henry Buller">Redvers Henry Buller</a> suggested his mounted troops sting the right horn into premature attack, which was agreed to. The men rode out to within range of the massed Zulus, fired a volley and then galloped back, closely followed by a great wave of 11,000 Zulu warriors. As soon as the horsemen had reached Kambula, and cleared the field of fire, the British infantry open fire with support from their four 7-pounders firing <a href="../../../s/h/e/Shell_%28projectile%29.html" title="Shell (projectile)">shell</a>, and then when the Zulus got closer <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canister_shot.html" title="Canister shot">canister shot</a>. A small number of Zulus managed to burst into the laager, and were repelled with bayonets, while the bulk of the advance was held at bay by the steady British musketry and gunfire. Some of the Zulu force swung right to come in against the western sides of the laager, but were met with equally effective resistance. After about half an hour the Zulu right horn drew back to the north-east.</p>
<p>At 2.15, as the right horn made its withdrawal, the left horn and center surged up out of the ravine, their leading warriors falling to crossfire from the laager and kraal as they came over the crest. However, more and more swarmed on to the <a href="../../../g/l/a/Glacis.html" title="Glacis">glacis</a> between the cliff and the defenders, funneling into the gap between the kraal and laager. The Zulus soon forced their way into the cattle Kraal and fought hand-to-hand with men of the 1/13th company. The cattle in the kraal hampered both sides, but with Zulu pressure mounting up the heavily outnumbered British troops managed to extricate themselves and pull back to the redoubt. Zulu rifleman were now able to open fire from behind the walls of the kraal to give their advancing comrades cover. At about this time the right horn came on again from the north-east, charging across the north face of the redoubt towards the guns and the eastern sides of the laager.</p>

<p>Although now attacked on both sides, Wood appreciated that the situation to the south was critical and ordered two companies to clear the Zulus off the glacis. Led by Major Hackett the men formed in line with bayonets fixed and charged across the open ground, forcing the Zulus back over the rim. The troops then lined the crest and opened volley fire into the packed warriors in the ravine. The counter-attack had succeeded perfectly but Hackett’s men suddenly found themselves under fire from their right, where Zulu marksmen had concealed themselves in a refuse tip. Hackett sounded the ‘Retire’ and his men returned to the cover of the laager, but not before losing a colour-sergeant, a subaltern and himself receiving a blinding head wound. The sight of this withdrawal encouraged the Zulus in the ravine to charge again, but along the narrow killing zone in front of the laager they could not this time prevail against the controlled volleys from behind the wagons and the redoubt.</p>
<p>On the north side the Royal Artillery men fought their guns in the open, not taking cover, and poured round after round directly into the right horn.</p>
<p>The Zulus charged again and again, with unwavering courage, but the head of each charge was shot away and at about 5pm Wood sensed the impetus was going out of their attack. Two companies moved to clear the kraal and lined the rim off the cliff with a further company to fire into the dead ground. As soon as the Zulus began to pull away eastwards he ordered Buller to mount his men up and pursue. The Zulus were harried mercilessly for 7 miles, mounted troops firing one handed with carbines from the saddle or spearing them with discarded <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assegai.html" title="Assegai">assegais</a>. The Frontier Light Horse men singled abaQulusi warriors for their special attention, chasing them as far as Hlobane and extracting a savage revenge for their comrades killed the day before at the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Hlobane_4933.html" title="Battle of Hlobane">Battle of Hlobane</a>.</p>

<p>Over 800 Zulu dead were counted in the immediate vicinity of the position and hundreds more perished in the ravine and during the pursuit. 18 British soldiers were killed, and 8 officers and 57 men wounded, 11 of which later died. Kambula is considered as the turning point of the war, for the Zulus learnt the unhappy lesson that shield and assegai, no matter how courageously wielded, were no match for artillery and the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martini-Henry_3cce.html" title="Martini-Henry">Martini-Henry</a>. Never again would an impi come on with the ferocity and resolution displayed up to this date.</p>
