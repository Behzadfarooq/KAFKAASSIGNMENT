<p>As Imperial Germany feared a long war against France and the <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russian_Empire_7810.html" title="Russian Empire">Russian Empire</a>, the <a href="../../../s/c/h/Schlieffen_plan.html" title="Schlieffen plan">Schlieffen plan</a> was conceived which suggested a quick strike to beat France first, as is was done successfully in the <a href="../../../f/r/a/Franco-Prussian_War_94d8.html" title="Franco-Prussian War">Franco-Prussian War</a> of 1870. In order to do this, neutral Belgium had to be attacked and crossed within a few days.</p>
<p>However, there were two problems with this plan. The violation of the neutrality of Belgium would certainly make the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_of_Great_Britain_and_Ireland_5d03.html" title="United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland">United Kingdom</a> enter the war on France's side. Also, the highly fortified city of <a href="../../../l/i/%C3%A8/Li%C3%A8ge_%28city%29.html" title="Liège (city)">Liège</a> was in the path of the German forces.</p>

<p>The Belgian city of <a href="../../../l/i/%C3%A8/Li%C3%A8ge_%28city%29.html" title="Liège (city)">Liège</a> lies at the confluence of the <a href="../../../m/e/u/Meuse_river.html" title="Meuse river">Meuse</a> and the <a href="../../../o/u/r/Ourthe.html" title="Ourthe">Ourthe</a> rivers, between the <a href="../../../a/r/d/Ardennes_Forest_8bd0.html" title="Ardennes Forest">Ardennes Forest</a> to the south and <a href="../../../m/a/a/Maastricht.html" title="Maastricht">Maastricht</a> of the <a href="../../../n/e/t/Netherlands.html" title="Netherlands">Netherlands</a> to the north. The Meuse flowed through a deep ravine at Liège, posing a significant barrier to the German advance.</p>
<p>It lay on the main rail line leading from Germany to <a href="../../../b/r/u/Brussels.html" title="Brussels">Brussels</a>, and eventually to Paris - the same railway that von Schlieffen and von Moltke had planned to use as transport into France. There were massive <a href="../../../i/n/d/Industry.html" title="Industry">industrial</a> facilities, factories, and other facilities that would assist the modern defense of the city.</p>
<p>In addition, a ring of twelve forts, based on then-current German fortification methods, had been completed in an 6-10-km radius around the city in <a href="../../../1/8/9/1892.html" title="1892">1892</a>. The forts overlapped each other's protective zones of fire, and were designed so that if any one fort fell, the two neighboring forts could still attack a force trying to move through the gap.</p>
<p>Six of the fortresses were built as primary forts, and were given a <a href="../../../p/e/n/Pentagon.html" title="Pentagon">pentagonal</a> shape with a surrounding ditch and barb-wire entanglements. They were concrete structures armed with two 6-inch and four 4.7-inch guns, two 8-inch mortars and four machine-guns. The guns were mounted in a cupola that could be elevated to fire, then retracted. The forts were linked by underground tunnels, and contained magazines for ammunition, crew quarters for up to eighty men, and ventilation systems. Between each pair of major forts was a triangular secondary fort, named a <i>fortin</i>. These were armed with two 6-inch and two 4-inch guns, a single 8-inch mortar and three machine-guns.</p>
<p>In total the forts had 400 pieces of artillery, although the guns were considered of obsolete design and impractical. (At the time the German <a href="../../../k/r/u/Krupp_Arms_Works_0845.html" title="Krupp Arms Works">Krupp Arms Works</a> was under contract to replace the guns, so the German Army was familiar with the weaponry at the fortresses.) The other weaknesses of the forts were a lack of field artillery pieces to cover the openings between the gaps, a shortage of men needed to guard the city, and (according to German reports after their capture) extremely poor quality concrete used in their construction. <a href="../../../l/i/e/Lieutenant_General_1f33.html" title="Lieutenant General">Lieutenant General</a> <a href="../../../g/%C3%A9/r/G%C3%A9rard_Leman_431d.html" title="Gérard Leman">Gérard Mathieu Leman</a> had been personally selected to command the Liège fortifications, and he was under orders from the King to hold the fortress system to the end. Leman had a force of about 25,000 soldiers, including members of the civic guard, to man the defenses.</p>

<p>To reduce the fortifications of Liège, a special task force of 30,000 troops was allocated, consisting of six brigades of infantry and three divisions of cavalry. These were placed under the command of General <a href="../../../o/t/t/Otto_von_Emmich_9cc3.html" title="Otto von Emmich">Otto von Emmich</a>, accompanied by the staff officer <a href="../../../e/r/i/Erich_Ludendorff_40ad.html" title="Erich Ludendorff">Erich Ludendorff</a> as an observer. War with Belgium was declared on the morning of <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_4.html" title="August 4">August 4</a>, and the lead elements of Task Force Emmich crossed the border a few hours later. They advanced to the Meuse river, but found the bridge crossings had been destroyed. By the 5th, however, German forces had crossed the Meuse to the north at Visé.</p>
<p>The Belgian 3rd Division guarded the town from behind hastily constructed earthworks, and on the 5th they successfully repulsed attacks by German infantry passing between the forts. An attack against Fort Barchon was beaten back with heavy losses due to machine-gun and artillery fire. After this failed attack, the Germans performed the first air raid in history by using a <a href="../../../z/e/p/Zeppelin.html" title="Zeppelin">Zeppelin</a> to drop bombs on Liège. Meanwhile cavalry moved south from Visé to encircle the town. With the town likely to be invested soon, Leman now ordered the 3rd division to withdraw from the town and rejoin the mobilizing Belgian army to the west.</p>
<p>Ludendorff now took command of the 14th brigade that was able to infiltrate between the forts. This brigade succeeded in capturing the town on the 7th. However the outer ring of forts continued to hold out, blocking German advance due to their interdiction of the railroad lines. The forts endured steady bombardment and attack by the German forces, but most of the forts continued to repulse enemy attacks. Only Fort Fleron was put out of action, its cupola-hoisting mechanism being destroyed by shell fire. The only fort to be captured by infantry assault would be Fort Barchon, which was taken on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_10.html" title="August 10">August 10</a>.</p>
<p>To reduce these fortifications, the Germans would have to employ their massive siege artillery. These would include the Krupp "Big Bertha" 420mm <a href="../../../h/o/w/Howitzer.html" title="Howitzer">howitzer</a> and some <a href="../../../a/u/s/Austria.html" title="Austria">Austrian</a> 305mm Skoda guns. At the time of the construction of the forts it was assumed that the largest guns that could be moved overland were 21cm howitzers, so they had never been designed to withstand the enormous shells from the bigger guns. The shells from these guns landed on the forts from directly above, penetrating the concrete sides and then detonating inside by means of a delayed fuze. One by one the forts were bombarded into submission, with the last, Fort Boncelles, capitulating on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_16.html" title="August 16">August 16</a>. On the 15th Leman was injured at Fort Loncin, and he was carried out unconscious to become a prisoner of the Germans.</p>
<p>Some had suggested the valiant ten-day stand made at Liège served to knock the German timetable off by two days, buying time for the Allies. However, German commanders denied that the siege significantly delayed the schedule of their still-mobilizing army. The ten day siege did, however, serve as a morale boost to Allied forces, and the French President would bestow the cross of the <a href="../../../l/%C3%A9/g/L%C3%A9gion_d%27honneur.html" title="Légion d'honneur">légion d'honneur</a> on the town for their resistance.</p>

</ul>
<p>Overall, there were about 30,000 infantry, 500 cavalry, and 250 artillery pieces to face the German onslaught.</p>
