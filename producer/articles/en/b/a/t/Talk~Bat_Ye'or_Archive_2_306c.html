<h2><span class="mw-headline">Short version</span></h2>
<p>I have rewritten the article in line with the recent abbreviated revision of the equally hotly contested article on <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Spencer_4b9f.html" title="Robert Spencer">Robert Spencer</a>. Let's stick to biography here and move the discussion of her writings to the pages dedicated to her books. It worked for rebert Spencer, why shouldn't it work here? Other articles on historians of Islam look pretty much the same without causing much controversy, see <a href="../../../b/e/r/Bernard_Lewis_9c79.html" title="Bernard Lewis">Bernard Lewis</a>, for example.--Pecher 20:57, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I disagree with this approach . An encyclopdia is meant to be informative , and an author's page should provide a comprehensive overview of the authors work not just a skeleton of their life. What you are doing is slicing off anything that would be contentious , supposedly moving it to other pages, which is simply moving it out of sight where the wikipedia reader is not very likely to get to, so in essence the result is a loss of information in the wikidia experience. If you goal is no controversy then just erase all the wikipedia pages and you will achieve that--<a href="../../../c/l/t/User%7ECltFn_aba7.html" title="User:CltFn">CltFn</a> 15:10, 28 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I approve of "Just the facts, Ma'am" approaches because there are the only demonstrated method that results in a high ratio of facts to smothering Wiki editor POV. Bloating entries seldom provide a "comprehensive overview of X's work;" rather, they provide a battlefield for POV turf-war with umpitty people hair-splitting over what's "comprehensive" and what's not. (I.e., Wiki editor "Bob" has an opinion, so he dashes to Google for a slam piece from the New York Times, and gives in prominance; then "Jay", of contrary opinion, wants to give The Wall Street Journal equal time; then "Mitch" cites Drudge...whereup everyone goes apeshit over "credibility" since Drudge Report is a website as opposed to the "credible" NYT, where a reporter is seemingly fired every week for lying and/or plagerism. And around and around and around it goes.)</dd>
<dd>The short version works well for Spencer, since his main "projects" are a blog (where anyone can spleen away) and writing books (where anyone can spleen away in an Amazon.com review). Given the ready availability of just about anything on the net, "exhaustive" articles are neither necessary nor advisable; giving the reader fast tips to further <i>his own research</i> in a rapidly-changing datascape should be, I think, a more paramount mission.--<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike18xx_f1c0.html" title="User:Mike18xx">Mike18xx</a> 04:04, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">"JournalistCruft"</span></h2>
<p>Dhummy, I'm actually pretty lenient -- if you can dredge up something claiming Bat Ye'or is the love-slave of over-sexed space-aliens ("with shocking photographs!") and wanna connect it in External Links, I couldn't care less (although others might zot it). But one-sentence throw-aways in the main body of the article, essentially boiling down to "This person sucks, according to this press blowhard!", followed by "And another ink-strained wretch says 'Does not!'", just get in the way of the more primary information (bibliography, etc). Virtually all of this criticism is self-evident anyway (e.g., Bat Ye'or is a Jew critical of many aspects of Islam--tough guess who doesn't like her).</p>
<p>There's plenty of room at the BOTTOM of the entry for all the hair-pulling.--<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike18xx_f1c0.html" title="User:Mike18xx">Mike18xx</a> 06:37, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Short version</span></h2>
<p>I think it's about strange to have an article about somebody known only for their writings which does not discuss how those writings are regarded. As it stands, this page would give a reader the impression that Bat Ye'or's status as a reputable historian was not a matter of considerable doubt (to put it mildly). The controversy over her opinions needs to be reflected here; otherwise it is a severe distortion (and yes, it is possible to distort by ommission). I will put a POV tag on the page until we reach agreement on this. <a href="../../../p/a/l/User%7EPalmiro_d72a.html" title="User:Palmiro">Palmiro</a> | <a href="../../../p/a/l/User_talk%7EPalmiro_7aea.html" title="User talk:Palmiro">Talk</a> 10:10, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><i>"I think it's about strange to have an article about somebody known only for their writings which does not discuss how those writings are regarded."</i> -- Perhaps an equal-length endorsement by Spencer or Pipes or Fallaci alongside each criticism would be appropriate. Of course then it would just "cancel out" the section. And there would also be incessent wrangling over which sources each editor preferred for inclusion (as cover for their own POV).--<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike18xx_f1c0.html" title="User:Mike18xx">Mike18xx</a> 19:25, 3 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Any time anyone tries to include criticism one or the other of Pecher and Mike18xx gets rid of it.

Pecher has been beyond reasonable in attempting to get ANY of you to dispute any <i>particular</i> assertion contained in Ye'or's work cited elsewhere (e.g., Dhimmi); and the very best I've seen so far is sputtering <i>ad-hominem</i>. While Wikipedia is indeed the free encyclopedia that anyone can edit, it's greatly preferred that the editors actually be familiar with the subjects they are editing. -- Having a cloudy perception that someone is a "right-wing extremist" doesn't really cut it (especially when that someone's major adversaries include, among others, Islamists who make up their own swastika flags, give the "fascist salute" at their rallies [<i>if you think I'm making that up, I'll be happy to direct you to a choice selection of photographic evidence</i>], and are making translated renditions of "Mein Kampf" and "The Protocols of the Elders of Zion" best-sellers).--<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike18xx_f1c0.html" title="User:Mike18xx">Mike18xx</a> 20:36, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>For inclusion when this page is unprotected:</p>
<p>Sidney H. Griffith in the International Journal of Middle East Studies writes of <i>The Decline of Eastern Christianity under Islam</i>: "The problems one has with the book are basically twofold: the theoretical inadequacy of the interpretive concepts <i>jihad</i> and <i>dhimmitude</i>, as they are employed here; and the want of historical method in the deployment of the documents which serve as evidence for the conclusions reached in the study. There is also an unfortunate polemical tone in the work." <a href="http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0020-7438%28199811%2930%3A4%3C619%3ATDOECU%3E2.0.CO%3B2-N&amp;size=LARGE" class="external autonumber" title="http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0020-7438%28199811%2930%3A4%3C619%3ATDOECU%3E2.0.CO%3B2-N&amp;size=LARGE" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>--<a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELeeHunter_0ab1.html" title="User:LeeHunter">Lee Hunter</a> 21:48, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>"Weasel-worded"?? What exactly do see as being weaselly? It's an utterly straight-forward critique.

<dd>Only the third point sounds more or or less lucid to me; however, examples are necessary to illustrate it. The first two, however, are vague. How exactly are her interpretations weak? What do you mean "her historical method is lacking"? Is there some kind of historical method that is specific to her? My understanding of criticism is: "Bat Ye'or says, quoting from a Syriac chronicle, that in the Abbasid Caliphate Muslims paid taxes to non-Muslims. However, the chronicle that she relies on had been proved to be a forgery by Julius Wellhausen 100 years before Bat Ye'or wrote her works." That's specific, substantiated crticism. On the other hand, "theoretical inadequacy of the interpretive concepts <i>jihad</i> and <i>dhimmitude</i>" sounds smart and scholarly, but is in fact general amd unsubstantiated.Pecher <sup><a href="../../../p/e/c/User_talk%7EPecher_4b24.html" title="User talk:Pecher">Talk</a></sup> 07:57, 10 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Huh? You write "How do you distinguish between a "controversial" and an "uncontroversial" person?" How about applying this simple test: "Do people express criticism about this person in notable publications?" Yes? The person is controversial. No? The person is non-controversial (but may be otherwise notable). You also write "Should we include all praise and criticism into the article then?" No, its not necessary to include ALL praise or criticism but a representative sample would be nice. The reader should, at the very least, be informed that the criticism exists! Your suggestion that including criticism is a "bad practise" is staggering. To be honest, it is quite ludicrous.

<dd>You need to spend more time reading articles in WP. You'll find that adding critical commentary to an article is entirely normal, proper and expected. Saddam Hussein is a poor example. Since he was an actor on the world stage, we can, indeed, simply let his actions speak for themselves. But Bat Ye'or, Noam Chomsky et al are academics and thinkers and their research and viewpoints cannot be evaluated by the average reader who has no background in linguistics, Middle East history etc. That is why we can't just summarize their ideas without including the commentaries of others. Bat Ye'or is notable for her ideas. This is a fact. Her ideas are accepted by some and rejected by others. This is another fact. I would suggest that if anyone is doing original research, it is you, because you are arbitararily deciding that we should publish the first fact, but hide the second. Wikipedia is a compendium of verifiable and notable information. Whether it makes someone look good or bad is pretty much irrelevant. Regarding your question of what is "representative", that is a question which is decided on a case-by-case basis by the editors of an article and is subject to change as new editors come along. One thing I can tell you for sure, is that trying to "cleanse" an article of all criticism is unacceptable and goes against everything this encyclopedia stands for. --<a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELeeHunter_0ab1.html" title="User:LeeHunter">Lee Hunter</a> 16:25, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Re the Chebel Malek citation: unfortunately his remarks are not accurate. After the rise of Zionism Jews in a number of Arab lands became the object of various abuses, including a small number of events which while not pogroms in the strict sense were certainly murderous sectarian riots. Obviously none of this was inspired by Islam or had anything to do with the dhimma, but was a response to contemporary political and, in the case of Palestine, economic developments, and he doubtless means to refer to periods of Islamic rule proprement dit; but it does mean that his remarks will make a lot of reasonably well-informed people go "what's he talking about? what about the <a href="../../../f/a/r/Farhud.html" title="Farhud">Farhud</a> (etc)?"

Just open Bernard Lewis to find out that Chebel is simply lying because Lewis never "established" anything Chebel ascribes to him. The reference to the Jewishness of the authors Chebel cites is particularly disgusting, as if an opinion of a Jewish author on matters of Jewish history carries more weight than opinions of non-Jewish scholars.

<dd>I am kind of bewildered as to how Wikipedia doles out "historian" honors. To me, "historian" means several of the following are true about a person: he has a doctorate in history; he teaches history at a reputable school; he has published articles in peer-reviewed, respected journals of history; he has written a history book that is used in history courses at several reputable schools; his writings are cited by other people who are considered historians. I'm not sure if Bat Ye'or meets a single one of these criteria; I'm going to change her to being a "writer" unless her resume can be beefed up a little. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_66.82.9.91_b028.html" title="Special:Contributions/66.82.9.91">66.82.9.91</a> (<a href="../../../6/6/2E/User_talk%7E66.82.9.91.html" title="User talk:66.82.9.91">talk</a>) 03:31, 20 December 2006 (UTC).</small></dd>

<dd>I don't see how it could possibly be argued that she is not a public figure. According to the article "Bat Ye'or has authored 8 books. She provided briefings to the US congress and has given talks at major universities such as Georgetown, Brown, Yale, Brandeis and Columbia universities." She's even appeared in a documentary video and there's a picture of her in the article speaking on CSPAN. If that's not public, what is? --<a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELeeHunter_0ab1.html" title="User:LeeHunter">Lee Hunter</a> 14:36, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Legitimacy of citing Johann Hari as a source.</span></h2>
<p>Somebody keeps deleting Johann Hari's criticisms on the grounds he is not "a scholar of Islam". You do not have to be a scholar of Islam to be posted on wiki; you have to be a notable source. Hari has written for the New York Times and been shortlisted for the Orwell Prize. His criticisms are totally legitimate to be posted here, and Ye'or's fans shoudl stop deleting them just ebcause they are critical.</p>

<dd>Both Spencer and Johann Hari are not specialized in the field of Bat Ye'or. Albert Einstein is notable in matters related to physics but he is not a qualified source for his views on history. Similarly, Johann Hari is NOT a reliable source for criticism of Bat Ye’or. Why don't you google it and find a published reliable source on Bat Ye'or? --<a href="../../../r/e/z/User%7EReza1_9735.html" title="User:Reza1">Reza1</a> 06:07, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>What does "qualified in the field of Bat Ye'or" mean? They are distinguished writers epxressing a clear, properly sourced and researched opinion. Albert Einstein's views on both religion and nuclear weapons (neither of which are his specialism) can be found on wiki entries. You are plainly removing the references because they are critical. This constitutes vandalism - can the Wiki authorities please adjudicate on this question?</p>
<p><br />
I think it's quite revealing that the vandals who were deleting passages form this page have chosen not to engage in discussion about it here, but have simply slinked away.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Misrepresenting Bernard Lewis statement</span></h2>
<p>The current statement <b>"Bernard Lewis, in his book The Jews of Islam states that Bat Ye'or emphasizes the negative aspects of the Muslim record."</b> is taken out of context and is a misrepresentation of what is actually presented in the book. (which I have by the way)</p>
<p>Here is what is actually in the book ,in the Chapter 1 NOTES sections: ( I have <b>bolded</b> the sentence in question )</p>
<p><b>Notes</b></p>
<p>THE FOLLOWING abbreviations have been used in the notes:</p>
<p>ONE. ISLAM AND OTHER RELIGIONS 1 The position of the non-Muslim subjects of the Muslim state has been studied by A. S. Tritton, The Caliphs and their Non-Muslim Subjects: A Critical Study of the Covenant of 'Umar (London, 1930; reprinted 1970), and by Antoine Pattai, Le Statut legal des nonmusulmans en pays d'Islam (Beirut, 1958). The literature on the different non-Muslim communities is uneven. Scholarly work on the Christians tends to be concerned with the history of Christianity and of the churches rather than with the actual life of the Christian communities. There is a quite extensive literature in Arabic. General works in Western languages include A. S. Atiya, A History of Eastern Christianity (London, 1968), and B. Spuler, Die Morgenländischen Kirchen, in Handbuch der Orientalistik (Leiden, 1964). On the history and historiography of the Jews in Islamic lands, there are two excellent recent publications: Norman A. Stillman, The Jews of Arab Lands: A History and Source Book (Philadelphia, 1979), and Mark R. Cohen, 'The Jews under Islam: from the Rise of Islam to Sabbatai Zevi,” in Bibliographical Essays in Medieval Jewish Studies (New York, 1976), pp. 169-1219, reprinted with a supplement as Princeton Near East Paper Number 32, Princeton, 1981. On the writings of S. D. Goitein, by far the most important body of scholarly work on Judaeo-Arab history, see chapter 2, note 1 below, and passim. The history of both Jews and Christians under Muslim rule is discussed in A. J. Arberry, ed., Religion in the Middle East (Cambridge, 1969), where bibliographies are also given. For a selection of documents in translation, see B. Lewis, Islam from the Prophet Muhammad to the Capture of Constantinople, II (New York, 1974), pp. 217-235. On Islamic tolerance in general, see Rudi Paret, “Toleranz und Intoleranz im Islam,” Saeculum 21 (1970): 344-365; Francesco Gabrieli, “La Tolleranza nell'Isiam,” La Cultura 10 (1971): 257-266, reprinted in idem, Arabeschi e Studi Islamici (Naples, 1973), pp. 25-36; Adel Khoury, Toleranz im Islam (Munich, 1980). <b>Two other works, which emphasize the negative aspects of the Muslim record, are Bat Ye'or (pseudonym), Le Dhimmi: Profil de l'oprimé en Orient et en Afrique du nord depuis la conquête arabe (Paris, 1980),</b> and Karl Binswanger, Untersuchungen zum Status der Nichtmuslime im osmanischen Reich des 16. Jahrhundert, mit einer Neudefinition des Begriffes “Dhimma” (Munich, 1977). The latter is very critical of what he calls the “dogmatic Islamophilia” of many orientalists.</p>
<p><br />
As you can see this is a far cry from the spin that is currently in the article.<a href="../../../r/e/z/User%7EReza1_9735.html" title="User:Reza1">user:Reza1</a> take note</p>
<p>Thus a more accurate presenting of what Bernard Lewis says would be something like this:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../b/e/r/Bernard_Lewis_9c79.html" title="Bernard Lewis">Bernard Lewis</a>, in his book <i>The Jews of Islam</i> cites that Bat Ye'or's book "Le Dhimmi: Profil de l'oprimé en Orient et en Afrique du nord depuis la conquête arabe (Paris, 1980) noting that it is emphasize the negative aspects of the Muslim record.</li>

<dd>I suggest you get a english dictionary and find out what the word "works" means , then ask yourself what could it be referring to.

<p>The current statement alleges that Lewis refers to Bat Ye'or, while he actually refers to one of her books, which he specifies. However, he doesn't cite the book, he mentions it and gives a qualifier. Here goes:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../b/e/r/Bernard_Lewis_9c79.html" title="Bernard Lewis">Bernard Lewis</a>, in his book "The Jews of Islam" notes that Bat Ye'or's book "Le Dhimmi: Profil de l'oprimé en Orient et en Afrique du nord depuis la conquête arabe" emphasizes the negative aspects of the Muslim record.</li>
