<p>There probably needs ot be some POV changes made here as well. Specifically to the usage of the word "enemy" <a href="../../../a/a/n/User%7EAanghelescu_df6f.html" title="User:Aanghelescu">Aanghelescu</a> 05:03, 18 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Also the use of:</b> - "treacherous Ashau Valley" in the section battle - "Vietnamese troops and supplies" (soldiers from North and South Vietnam are both Vietnamese troops thus needs to be specified) - "intelligence indicated that the Vietnamese were looking for a big fight." Which North or South? Or from South but supporting the cause the North was advocating (One Vietnam?) - The way this part is written is too much focused on US efforts and not objective report of the battle "the enemy". fbvdloo 05:03, 18 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>I've attempted to address these POV issues to neutralize the focus, but the material available is thus far exclusively American in reporting.

<li>Also, by 1969 and thereafter, the term PAVN had been largely discontinued by English-speakers, whether in the military, media, or common language. The article switched to NVA halfway thru--so I switched all the references to NVA. Buckboard 10:53, 20 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Is it simply a coincidence that there are battles (and books/films about them) called both <a href="../../../p/o/r/Pork_Chop_Hill_bbd4.html" title="Pork Chop Hill">Pork Chop Hill</a> and <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hamburger_Hill_b033.html" title="Hamburger Hill">Hamburger Hill</a>? Is the latter usage somehow a reference to the former? Is this worth noting somewhere?--82.10.133.130 13:20, 3 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yes, it is coincidental. Neither has anything to do with the other. No need to cross-reference on Wikipedia. It's not unusual for hills to be referred to by their shape, like Sugarloaf or Pork Chop. --<a href="../../../h/a/b/User%7EHabap_8f9b.html" title="User:Habap">Habap</a> 14:49, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/t/Talk%7EBattle_of_Hamburger_Hill_97cd.html" title="Edit section: Hamburger Hill &amp; Apache Snow">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Hamburger Hill &amp; Apache Snow</span></h2>
<p>Does anyone know the story here? There was a hammer and anvil operation planned as (or part of) Apache Snow. The idea was to entice a force of NVA to attack a poorly defended base (the bait - FSB Airborne) then chase them with a superior force (the hammer) toward Laos. When their likely entry point into Laos was determined, a second force (the anvil) would be dropped between the NVA and Laos.</p>
<p>The bait (FSB Airborne) was kept intentionally poorly defended. The perimeter defenses consisted of makeshift bunkers of logs and sand bags with a single strand of concertina wire. There were 2-artillery batteries of 3-guns each. The base was on a smaller point on a ridge, surrounded on 3-sides by higher ground. The 4th side formed the head of a side valley leading to the Ashau Valley. Tunnel complexes were found off 2-sides of the hill. This set-up was very inconsistent with practices of the 101st at the time. For a week or more, all material and manpower on the hill were put into building the operation center (the TOC) and nothing was done to improve the the perimeter.</p>
<p>The planned operation, in addition to being rather transparent, was probably leaked to the NVA. The policy of involving the ARVN in operations usually had that effect (at least I heard some disturbing rumors).</p>
<p>The NVA took the bait (over-running Fire Base Airborne) then headed west. However, instead of continuing to run for Laos, they detoured to a well fortified hill (Dong Ap Bia aka Hamburger Hill) where they managed to repel several assaults from the 3rd of the 187th. When more American units joined the fight (including the 2nd of the 501st---part of which had been the bait) the NVA used their tactical advantage to continue to hold off the 101st while the majority of their force dispersed through the jungle. By the time the last assult was made, there was a reinforced platoon defending the hill and most of them escaped.</p>
<p>I will dig up what documentation I can and edit this comment. Meantime, the 2nd Battalion of the 501st Infantry was in the 2nd Brigade not the 3rd. They were involved in the earlier operations in the southern A Shau for 2-months then assigned to the 3rd Brigade for Apache Snow. They took over Fire Base Airborne from the 3rd of the 187th. An official publication of the 101st Division, possibly published in the fall of 1969, gives the American dead as 60+ from the assault on Dong Ap Bia. No mention is made of Fire base Airborne having been over-run. The only mention of enemy dead (as I remember) was around 40 from mop-up operations in the 2-3 days after the main battle and the assertion that captured NVA had given their losses as 80%. My best recollection is shy of 40 Americans killed on FSB Airborne, times 3 wounded (as Tom hanks character might have said). The number of NVA dead found on Airborne after the attack was 6 or 7. Initial reports from the assault on Dong Ap Bia said 20-30 American dead. This was revised to around 50. Rumors among the field troops put the American dead at 250 or more from the assault. This is probably high. The wounded from the main assaults were stabilized at a mass casualty treatment facility set up by the medical battalion of the 3rd Brigade. The number of wounded treated on the heaviest day may be listed as part of the citation recieved by the members of the medical battalion. I think 400-500 wounded might have been treated at the mass casualty facility which would not be 100% of the wounded. The 600+ NVA dead is pure fabrication. The bodies were never found. The early reports listed 500 dead as speculation based on the belief that the NVA carried away their dead. Does this mean that the remaining NVA carried 500 dead comrades through the jungle while evading 3-battalions of Americans and 1- of ARVN that, collectively, had them surrounded? The discovery of a mass grave of 500 dead NVA in the vicinity became a tired joke in the week after the battle. I would, in any case, dispute that this was an American victory. --<a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArthurk_2182.html" title="User:Arthurk">Dennis-K</a> 18:43, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
