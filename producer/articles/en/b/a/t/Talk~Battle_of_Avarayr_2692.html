<p>Yazdegerd II was not present at the battle. The commander of the Sassanid troops was Mihr-Narseh.</p>
<p>Letter by Mihr-Narseh, the Sassanid commander:</p>
<p>From Elishe's The History of Vartanank</p>
<p>To the Armenian Nobles:</p>
<p>Quote: Manifold Greetings;</p>
<p>Be it known to you, that every man who dwells beneath the heavens and holds not the Mazdean religion, is deaf and blind and is deceived by the devils of Ahriman. Because the heavens and the earth were not yet in existence when the great God Zruan made offerings for a thousand years and said: 'Perhaps, I will have a son by the name of Vormizt, who will create heaven and earth.' And he conceived two in his abdomen: one for the offerings he had made, and the other because he said 'perhaps'. When he perceived that there were two in his abdomen, he said: 'Whichever shall come first, to him I will give my sovereignty.' But he who had been conceived in doubt, ruptured the abdomen and came out.</p>
<p>But I do not want to mention all the details in writing, because the things they [Christians] say are many. Their preachings, that God was crucified by men, that he died, and that He was buried, and then He rose again and ascended into heaven, is worse than all we mentioned above. Should it not have been worthy of you properly to appraise such unworthy preachings? Even the devils, who are evil, cannot be caught and tortured by men, let alone God, Who is the Creator of all beings. It is shameful for you to say things which are utterly incredible to us.</p>
<p>Now then, there are two ways open to you: either you answer this letter word for word, or you repair to the Court and present yourselves at the great assembly.</p>
<p>The response:</p>
<p>Quote: To Mihrnerseh, the Grand Commander:</p>
<p>Many greetings to You and to the Great Army of the Aryans, in Peaceloving Spirit.</p>
<p>This Jesus Christ, who within Himself redeemed the whole world, came to death of His own will; and, by means known to Himself and God, he assumed a solid form from the Pure Virgin, was born, wrapped in swaddling clothes and laid in a manger, to which He guided the wise men from the East to worship Him. He performed great miracles and magnificent deeds among the Hebrews, was betrayed by the priests and convicted by Pontius Pilate. He was crucified, died, was buried, and rose gain on the third day, and appeared to His twelve disciples and to many others to more than five hundred persons. He promised to come a second time with a terrible might to wake the dead, to redeem the whole world, to deal strict justice to the innocent and the sinners, to reward the deserving and to punish the wicked who do not believe in these benevolent deeds.</p>
<p>From this faith no one can shake us, neither angels nor men, neither sword, nor fire, nor water, nor any, nor all horrid tortures. All our goods and possessions are in your hands, our bodies are before you; dispose of them as you will. If you leave us to our belief, we will, here on earth, choose no other master in your place, and in heaven choose no other God in place of Jesus Christ, for there is no other God. But should you require anything beyond this great testimony, here we are; our bodies are in your hands; do with them as you please. Tortures from you, submission from us; the sword is yours, the neck ours. We are no better that our fathers, who, for the sake of this faith, surrendered their goods, their possession, and their bodies.</p>
<p>Were we even immortal, it would become us to die for the love of Christ; for He Himself was immortal and so loved us that He took death on Himself, that we, by His death, might be freed from eternal death. And since He did not spare His immortality, we, who became mortal of our own will, will die for His love willingly, so that He may make us participators in His immortality. We shall die as mortals that He may accept our death as that of immortals.</p>
<p>Do not, therefore, interrogate us further concerning all this, because our bond of faith is not with men to be deceived like children, but to God with whom we are indisoluably bound and from Whom nothing can detach and separate us, neither now, nor later, nor forever, nor forever and ever. --<a href="../../../e/u/p/User%7EEupator_a3d1.html" title="User:Eupator">Eupator</a> 15:19, 21 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>This article is awfully biased and clearly written from an Armenian perspective:</p>
<p>"Sassanid overlords"</p>
<p>"Although the Persians eventually subdued the rebellion, they had to revise their plans for persecution of Christians"</p>
<p>After doing a term project on the Sassanids I believe that this article should be relegated to a Start article. The Sassanids punishing of the Armenians was meant to prevent any further interference from the Byzantines in Sassanid affairs.</p>

<p>I agree, and though I have the utmost respect for Armenians and Armenian history, calling it an "Armenian victory" (As it is labelled in outcome) even though the article itself contradicts this, does deduct the quality of the article. It is a little biased, but then again it must be understood that even in spite of the fact that Iranians and Armenians maintained historically friendly relations, this one battle is often considered the "Armenian Thermopylae", and Vartan considered a hero, so even though it is biased, it is "understood" at the subconscious level. I can accept that this battle was a moral victory for the Armenians, but in the technical, strategical and tactical sense, this battle was a Sassanid victory. This is not a downplay on Armenian valour or courage, but I get the sense that this battle was purely an attack on Christianity, and with respect to the context it seems to me rather like the Sassanids wished to consolidate Armenia away from Roman influence. The Sassanids, although the war on the Armenians seems unfair, had all the reasons to be suspicious towards Christianity, considering their rivalry with the Romans. I think these additions may serve to give the article more perspective, without violating Armenian integrity. I do however urge a change on the supposed "Armenian victory" in the outcome, as this never was the case. --The Persian Cataphract 22:54, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Am I missing something? Where the hell does it say Armenian victory? It was an Armenian military loss. In every other sense it was an Armenian victory though. Armenians had outrageous priviliges in Sassanid times. The marzpanate of Armenia was governed by an Armenian while every other marzpanate was governed by Persians for example.--<big><b><a href="../../../e/u/p/User%7EEupator_a3d1.html" title="User:Eupator"><font color="#00N510">Ευπάτωρ</font></a></b></big> <sup><small><a href="../../../e/u/p/User_talk%7EEupator_d1d3.html" title="User talk:Eupator"><font color="#974423">Talk!!</font></a></small></sup> 23:21, 9 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>It used to say Armenian victory some hours ago, Nareklm changed it back. Note that according to Armenian sources, the Persians lost approximately 3 times more men than the Armenians. However, that doesn't change the fact that the Armenians lost military. In the decades following the battle, the continued Armenian resistance led by Vahan Mamikonian (the successor of Vartan) eventually forced the Persians to accept the Nvarsak Treaty (<a href="../../../4/8/4/484.html" title="484">484</a>) which guaranteed freedom of religion to the Armenians. I'll add some this info to the article. -- <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavo88_09f3.html" title="User:Davo88">Davo88</a> 00:20, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
