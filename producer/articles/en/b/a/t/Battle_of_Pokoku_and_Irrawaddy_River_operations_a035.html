<p>Early December 1944 Major General G C Evans took over command of the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Indian_Army_4a5e.html" title="British Indian Army">British Indian Army</a>. The Japanese 31st Division had been decimated at Kohima and their 33rd and 15th Division had also met the same fate and had cost Japanese at least fifty thousand dead. In previous years there used to be lull during the monsoon period but not this year (1944-45). The command decided that it was time to target the heart of <a href="../../../i/m/p/Imperial_Japanese_Army_18cd.html" title="Imperial Japanese Army">Japanese Army</a> in Burma. General Slim's plan through the monsoon months had been pursuit of the defeated Japanese in <a href="../../../k/o/h/Kohima.html" title="Kohima">Kohima</a> and plains of <a href="../../../i/m/p/Imphal.html" title="Imphal">Imphal</a> with 5th Indian Division down the Tiddim Road and 11th East African Division down the Kabaw valley, until the two joined hand at Kalemyo. The next offensive plan centred on the occupation of Central Burma, as far South as <a href="../../../m/a/n/Mandalay.html" title="Mandalay">Mandalay</a> to exploit further South and destroy the Japanese Forces in the Shewbo Plains, North of <a href="../../../i/r/r/Irrawaddy.html" title="Irrawaddy">Irrawaddy</a>, where armour could be used. Allied Forces crossed River Chindwin and the spearheads of both Corps of the Fourteenth Army { IV and XXXIII Corps} were moving into selected battle areas, which surprised Japanese as they had not anticipated any major operations during the monsoon period. The <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Fourteenth_Army_7859.html" title="British Fourteenth Army">British Fourteenth Army</a> was now faced with a major obstacle (<a href="../../../i/r/r/Irrawaddy.html" title="Irrawaddy">Irrawaddy</a>) covered by determined Japanese. The Irrawaddy River in its middle is about two thousand yards broad and dotted with treacherous and shifting sand bars. An opposed direct crossing would have been very expensive with low percentage of success.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Pokoku_and_Irrawaddy_River_operations_a035.html" title="Edit section: Offensive Plan">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Offensive Plan</span></h2>
<p>The new situation required a different plan, revolving under surprise and crossing of the <a href="../../../i/r/r/Irrawaddy_River_64ed.html" title="Irrawaddy River">Irrawaddy River</a> for fighting major battles in the plains around <a href="../../../m/a/n/Mandalay.html" title="Mandalay">Mandalay</a> and in the low hills of Meiktila. Since there was not enough equipment to make an opposed river crossing, Slim planned more than one crossing with adequate deception plans as to where the real assault in strength was to take place. It was decided to make sufficiently strong crossing North of <a href="../../../m/a/n/Mandalay.html" title="Mandalay">Mandalay</a> to draw main enemy forces, while making the main crossing in the South of Japanese concentrations below <a href="../../../m/a/n/Mandalay.html" title="Mandalay">Mandalay</a>. The revised plan pertaining to 7 Indian Infantry Division was IV Corps less 19th Division (7th and 17th Indian Divisions, 28th East African Brigade, Lushai Brigade and 255 Indian Tank Brigade) to move due South, down the Gangaw valley for nearly 300 miles, seize a bridgehead on Irrawaddy at Pokoku and then strike Southeast with mechanised forces at Meiktila and Thazi, with air maintenance.</p>

<p>Next operation across <a href="../../../i/r/r/Irrawaddy_River_64ed.html" title="Irrawaddy River">Irrawaddy River</a>, was to be a magnificent stroke of bravery and deception, that was to make possible the destruction of the Japanese army in Burma. This involved advance through Gangaw Valley and crossing of Irrawaddy River at Nyungu. Thereafter a quick thrust to Meiktila, capture of which was to cut off Japanese Army fighting in the North and Central Burma. The operation of the 7th Indian Infantry Division was initiated by 114th Indian Infantry Brigade by their move to Tamu, over a motorable road; constructing a stretch of 180 miles (Over 280 Kilometres) of motorable road from Tamu to Gangaw in 15 days 114th Brigade and Divisional Headquarters moving along the main axis Kaley Valley road,. The advance was to begin on 19 January 1945 and the 7 Indian Infantry Divisional tasks were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Advance and seize the Pauk area up to and including crossing of Yaw Chaung by not later than 1 February 1945.</li>
<li>To seize a bridgehead over the Irrawaddy between Chauk and Pokoku suitable for advance to Meiktila by not later than 15th February 1945.</li>

<p>The Japanese had been defeated in the Battles of <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Kohima_c2b1.html" title="Battle of Kohima">Kohima</a> and <a href="../../../i/m/p/Imphal.html" title="Imphal">Imphal</a> and offensive to destroy Japanese Forces North of Irrawaddy River was planned with a surprise crossing of the River. <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indian_7th_Infantry_Division_e2ae.html" title="Indian 7th Infantry Division">Indian 7th Infantry Division</a> and other formations were to seize a bridgehead on Irrawaddy at Pokoku by 15 Feb 45 and move southeast with mechanised forces. Operations of 7 Division initiated by 114 Indian Infantry Brigade was led by <a href="../../../5/g/r/5GR_84b6.html" title="5GR">4/5 Royal Gurkha Rifles (Frontier Force)</a>. The battalion left Merema on December 4, 1944, and reached the area on 3 February, 1945 and close to given objective Pokoku on February 5, 1945, after C Company (Major Beytagh) cleared the road. The Japanese shelled the troops from their positions in Kahnla, a village on the South Bank of the Irrawaddy.</p>
<p>On February 5th, three companies of the <a href="../../../5/g/r/5GR_84b6.html" title="5GR">4/5th Gurkha Rifles</a>, led by Captain Fisher, Major Brown <a href="../../../m/i/l/Military_Cross_3e00.html" title="Military Cross">MC</a>* and the Commanding Officer Lieutenant Colonel J H Turner, made an encircling move on the village of Kahnla. One company moved further left and attacked from Northeast, after coming under intense Japanese attack, while a second Company forming up in Kahnla village for the attack from West; with Hotel Hour at 5-30 PM fought its way, overran half of the Japanese position, including a strong <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medium_Machine_Gun_fdcc.html" title="Medium Machine Gun">Medium Machine Gun</a> (MMG) bunker. Not less than 30 Japanese were killed and many wounded, while two <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medium_Machine_Gun_fdcc.html" title="Medium Machine Gun">Medium Machine Guns</a> (MMG’s), three <a href="../../../l/i/g/Light_Machine_Gun_74a4.html" title="Light Machine Gun">Light Machine Guns</a> (LMG's) and twenty rifles were recovered. One of the Battalion’s wounded was CHM Bhagta Bahadur Gurung, whose outstanding courage and leadership in this attack brought him a well-earned Indian Order of Merit (IOM). Major I M Brown MC was awarded one more Bar to MC (Military Cross). These were two of the 41 major awards won by the Battalion during operations in <a href="../../../c/h/i/China_Burma_India_Theater_8af9.html" title="China Burma India Theater">Burma Theatre</a> during <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a>.</p>
<p>Further reconnaissance on the 6th of February indicated remainder objective strongly held and on 7 February <a href="../../../1/g/r/1GR_affd.html" title="1GR">4/1 Gurkha Rifles</a> established firm base for the Battalion. On February 8, the Company led by Major Brown cleared another Japanese position, killing twelve and wounding three Japanese. The main attack planned for early morning hours of February 10, was pressed without any aerial support due to bad weather. The attack began with one Company and tanks of the <a href="../../../g/o/r/Gordon_Highlanders_27cd.html" title="Gordon Highlanders">Gordon Highlanders</a>. By the afternoon, three troop companies with armoured support captured their objective. Unfortunately, the Commanding Officer of the battalion was killed in action during the assault. Resistance by Japanese position defended by a battalion was fanatical. One Prisoner of War (POW) was taken and 51 bodies counted. During night 10th February 1945, Japanese launched six unsuccessful counterattacks and on the night of 11th and 12th February 1945, they tried to infiltrate into the Battalion position, without success. On the night of February 13th, troops of the <a href="../../../5/g/r/5GR_84b6.html" title="5GR">4/5 Royal Gurkha Rifles</a> first occupied positions closer to Pokoku Village, called Sinlan, then proceeded to search and occupy Pokoku itself. With this operation, unique as it was, decimating nearly battalion strength of Japanese, the first stage of 7 Indian Infantry Division task was completed and foothold gained on the West Bank of <a href="../../../i/r/r/Irrawaddy_River_64ed.html" title="Irrawaddy River">Irrawaddy River</a>, for further operations. The operation was magnificent stroke of bravery and deception, making possible the next phase of offensive for the destruction of Japanese in Burma.</p>

<p>After the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indian_7th_Infantry_Division_e2ae.html" title="Indian 7th Infantry Division">Indian 7th Infantry Division</a> had captured Pokoku, on February 14, the Allied forces crossed the <a href="../../../i/r/r/Irrawaddy_River_64ed.html" title="Irrawaddy River">Irrawaddy River</a> at Nyungu, North of ancient Burmese capital of Pagan. By February 20th, most of the forces crossed the river and captured <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Meiktila_d1f6.html" title="Battle of Meiktila">Meiktila</a>, as planned. Capture Pokoku by <a href="../../../5/g/r/5GR_84b6.html" title="5GR">4/5 Royal Gurkha Rifles (Frontier Force)</a> opened way for further operations of <a href="../../../1/7/t/17th_Infantry_Division_%28India%29_8c4a.html" title="17th Infantry Division (India)">Indian 17th Infantry Division</a>. On February 19th, the <a href="../../../5/g/r/5GR_84b6.html" title="5GR">4/5 Royal Gurkha Rifles</a> cleared an island, five miles long and three miles broad, in the Irrawaddy River, off Pokoku, which was interfering with forward movement.</p>
<p>On February 24th, the Gurkhas moved south of Pokoku, crossed Irrawaddy River and took over part of Nyungu bridgehead. On February 25th, a squadron of the 116th Regiment RAC (Gordon Highlanders) supported the assault of the battalion and the village was soon secured, in which seven Japanese including an officer were killed. Throughout the month of April, the allies continued to engage the Japanese in the area and this led to the capture of Letse and Seikpyu. On the morning of the 24th of April, leading troops were pinned down with heavy fire from a ridge with a prominent Golden Pagoda and a monastery. The objective was captured by a company of the <a href="../../../5/g/r/5GR_84b6.html" title="5GR">4/5 Royal Gurkha Rifles</a>, under Captain G W Maycock, supported by heavy artillery concentration. Thirty-nine Japanese bodies were recovered. By 30th April Battalion secured Pwinbu and then moved to clear Japanese position at Pagan village. From 5th to 8th of May concerted assaults on Japanese positions were launched which a ring around the position from the South on 6th, roadblock in the rear of the Japanese on 7th and assault launched on Pagan Village on 8th.</p>

<p>While these subsidiary operations, minor in comparison, had been taking place West of Irrawaddy River, the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Meiktila___Mandalay_a524.html" title="Battle of Meiktila / Mandalay">Battle of Mandalay</a> had been fought out. The Japanese had been decisively and finally beaten. The <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burma_Area_Army_7cf3.html" title="Burma Area Army">Japanese Army in Burma</a> except for those still East of Sittang River had ceased to exist as an organised and integrated force. On 2nd May 1945 Rangoon had been reoccupied and General Slim's plans had been brought to a triumphant conclusion. The monsoon was about to break and the next phase was to be a large scale mopping up operations. On 14th May the Battalion left Pagan for what it hoped would be a fairly permanent monsoon location. After several changes of location, the Battalion arrived at Allanmyo, forty mile North of Prome. Orders were soon received on 27th May to move to Prome for further operational tasks.</p>
