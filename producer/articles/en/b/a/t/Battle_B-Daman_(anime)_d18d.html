<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_B-Daman_%28anime%29_d18d.html" title="Edit section: Shadow Alliance">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Shadow Alliance</span></h2>
<p>The Shadow Alliance (called simply "Shadow" in Japan) are the main bad guys of Season One with goals of B-DaWorld Domination. Some members of the Shadow Alliance have a 3rd eye which is the symbol of the Shadow Alliance and is a sign that the character is under Marda B.'s control. There are two incarnations of the group. There was the original and the Neo Shadow Alliance. The members of this group are:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Marda B</b>: Marda B. is the main villain of the 1st season who established the Shadow Alliance and Neo Shadow Alliance. Marda B. was mysterious being who invented B-Daman and was never defeated. He was the first B-DaMaster. Thanks to his combetive spirit he was split into two halves - good and evil. It is noted that his evil half could only be defeated by his good side: B-Energy. When Yamato had defeated Ababa (thus freeing him from Marda B.'s control), he started the Neo Shadow Alliance where all of the members he sent to attack Yamato and Co. were innocent B-DaPlayers under his control (with the exception of Enjyu, Biarce, Cain and Joshua who joined on their own free will). Marda B.'s evil form seems to be one giant flaming eye that always seemed to be floating in the sky.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the last episode of the series Marda B. fuses with Biarce to form, Mardabiarce, and reveales his plot: He made the shadow alliace, the Neo shadow, desroyed Cobalt Blade and even created Biarce, just so he could have the ultimate B dabattle with Yamato. At the end of the episode, his full good form is revealed - a seemingly huge gray cat wearing in a white top hat.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Ababa</b>: An evil cat who worked for Marda B. in season 1. Ababa was the leader of the Shadow Alliance which consisted of Gray, Enjyu, Wen, Li and other minor characters from Season 1. When Depowered by Marda B. he is just another purple cat with extremely long hair. He was seen again at the end of the last episode of the series.</li>

Enjyu</div>
</div>
</div>
<ul>
<li><b>Enjyu</b>: A wicked boy who killed everyone else in his village with His B-Daman Lightning Khan. Before joining the shadow alliance Enjyu use to be a talented kid who wished to improve his skills more as a B-Daman player. His father however wanted him to take a dive on each of his battles so his dad could pay for their rent. Before each battle, Enjyu's opponents would pay him to lose the match, making them look skilled and Enjyu an amateur. Fed up of his life, Enjyu joined the Junior B-Daman Tournament. There he was disqualified after unfairly being accused of cheating due to his refusal to repeat his past life. After being betrayed by his only "friend", Enjyu took out his anger on his father in a B-DaBattle. As soon as the battle commenced, Enjyu's personality and hair changed from blue to red. Why his hair changed color is uncertain. After the battle (which had no proof of a victor), Enjyu joined the Shadow Alliance where he later received Lightning Khan, the brother of Cobalt Blade, as his new B-Daman. Later in the series, Lightning Khan was upgraded to Blazing Khan by Marda B. and later in season 2 or 3 is upgraded once more into Variable Khan. In order to defeat Yamato in the finals. However, instead of defeating him, Enjyu saved Yamato's life and quickly be-friended him. He later rejoined the Neo Shadow Alliance so that he could've fought Marda B. to avenge his new "friends". At the end of season one, Marda B brainwashes Enjyu, and Terry used his part of the B energy to set him free, but Enjyu wasn't happy about that. He was angry because he felt as if Terry wasted his B-Energy, which he could use to save the world, to save him. Although, Terry reasoned that he was his friend and he figured out, with the help of Joe, that it was the right thing to do.</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Wen Yong Fa</b>: The oldest of the Yong Fa brothers. He joined the Shadow Alliance at a young age to become a stronger B-DaPlayer. Wen is often blunt and stubborn but also openhearted and loyal to those he cares about. He uses the B-Daman Bakuso which was later upgraded to King Bakuso by Bull. He changed his ways and left the Shadow Alliance after Yamato helped him in a battle against Enjyu. After Wen left, he continued to help Yamato and Co. often under Armada's direction. He sometimes wore a mask and cape. When his younger brother, Li Yong Fa, joined the Neo Shadow Alliance, he traveled with Yamato and his friends in order to help them defeat Marda B. and rescue his brother from Marda B.'s control. He eventually fought Li and brought him back to normal. The brothers have not separated since.</li>

He uses the B-Daman Rekuso which was later upgraded to King Rekuso which can be combined with Bakuso to form Bakurekuso and King Bakurekuso. He and his older brother have been helping Yamato after they left the Shadow Alliance. Later in the series, Enjyu begged Li to help him defeat Marda B. Like Enjyu, Li pretended to work for the Neo Shadow Alliance in order to find Marda B.'s weakness. But certain members did not trust Li's loyalities towards the Neo Shadow Alliance so Marda B. claimed Li's mind giving Li the third eye and erasing all his past memories. Later, Wen tried to save his brother through a B-Dabattle. Luckily, Wen won and returned Li to his normal self.</li>

<li>Gannos - <a href="../../../m/a/k/Makiko_Ohmoto_75cf.html" title="Makiko Ohmoto">Makiko Ohmoto</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Gannos is a rookie b-da player who first appears in Season 2: Episode 2. Despite being hotheaded, sarcastic and limited experience he possesses amazing skill. He enters the Winners Tournament for his village as he promises them when he left that he would go and win. After encountering Yamato, he tags along and becomes part of the regular rivalry between the two. While he is rude and obnoxious to Yamato, he is extremely polite towards others such as Terry &amp; Jou, even bowing down to them because he thinks they are 'cool and smart.'</p>
<ul>
<li>Akyuras - <a href="../../../s/o/i/Soichiro_Hoshi_4e85.html" title="Soichiro Hoshi">Soichiro Hoshi</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Little is known about this boy. He is said he is the last survivor of a clan who knows the secret of a special B-Daman move. His B-Daman is Revolver Hades. He is befriended by Bull, and slowly begins to accept him as a companion and friend. Bull then vows to make Revolver Hades even better than Cobalt Saber in order to help Akyuras win the tournament. In the qualifying rounds of the 2nd Winners Tournament, Akyuras is Division 2 and the contestants had to navigate through a series of difficult obstacles to shoot their b-da ball into the final hole - a b-damon version of golf. Akyuras is the first to finish making him the first to qualify. In the quarter finals, the 10 contestants that made it through are regrouped into Set A and B. Akyuras is grouped into Set A where the five contestants enter a pyramid to face three challenges. They would have to hit a hovering blue ball to pass a challenge and that would transport them to a higher level and eventually out of the pyramid. Akyuras and Enjyu are the victors of this challenge and they come out together so the first to emerge is unknown. In the semi-finals, there are only four contestants left, Yamato, Gannos, Enjyu and Akyuras. Enjyu and Akyuras face off in a game where you must defend your goal with your b-damon while attempting to shoot your own b-da balls into the opponents goal. Each player had to score ten goals before they would be declared the winner. Akyuras easily defeats Enjyu, but not before Enjyu finally uses all his strength to score one goal - tarnishing Akyuras's perfect 10-0 to 10-01.</p>

However, a miss shot causes played to descend from the tower.</li>
<li><b>DHB</b>:Direct Hit Battle, whoever hits the opponents B-Daman wins. This is the most commonly played variation.</li>
