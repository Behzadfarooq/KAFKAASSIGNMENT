<p>This battle took place during the Chinese <i>Fifth Phase Offensive</i> (also known as the <i>Chinese Spring Offensive</i>) in April 1951.</p>
<p>The forces involved on the <a href="../../../p/e/o/People%27s_Volunteer_Army_3fb5.html" title="People's Volunteer Army">Chinese</a> side were the 3rd Field Army, consisting of the 64th Army on the western flank, 63rd Army in the centre, and 65th Army in the east. These were positioned on the northern bank of the Imjin River, but concentrated some way back, as was usual for Chinese forces at this time.</p>
<p>Facing them on the southern bank were the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_29th_Infantry_Brigade_6abc.html" title="British 29th Infantry Brigade">British 29th Infantry Brigade</a> (commanded by Brigadier General Tom Brodey), consisting of the 1st battalion <a href="../../../g/l/o/Gloucestershire_Regiment_beeb.html" title="Gloucestershire Regiment">Gloucestershire Regiment</a> on the left, 1Btn <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Northumberland_Fusiliers_1b8e.html" title="Royal Northumberland Fusiliers">Royal Northumberland Fusiliers</a> (RNF) in the centre, and, on the right the 1Btn <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Ulster_Rifles_d301.html" title="Royal Ulster Rifles">Royal Ulster Rifles</a>(RUR), with the Belgian battalion forward of them. The Gloucesters were guarding a ford over the Imjin, known as Gloster crossing; the RUR were covering Ulster crossing, while the Belgians were north of the river occupying a feature called Hill 196, around the village of Tagampo.</p>
<p>The battle opened on night of 22nd April 1951; after a fierce bombardment, 3 Chinese divisions of 63 Army attacked along 29 Bdes front, concentrating on Gloster crossing and the Belgian positions. By morning, 187 Div had forced the crossing and were pressing on the Gloucesters A and D companies positions; in the east 189 Div had the Belgians surrounded, but a counter-attack by tanks and infantry of <a href="../../../u/s/_/US_3rd_Infantry_Division_a62d.html" title="US 3rd Infantry Division">US 3rd Div</a> during the day (23rd April) enabled them to withdraw.</p>
<p>Chinese attacks through the night of the 23rd saw continued pressure on 29th Bde, leaving the Gloucesters surrounded on Hill 235 (later known as <a href="../../../g/l/o/Gloster_Hill_84f6.html" title="Gloster Hill">Gloster Hill</a>) and forcing RNF to fight their way south. RUR acted as rear-guard before withdrawing also to a new defensive position at the Takchong crossroads.</p>
<p>An attempt by US and <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philippine_Army_dcf8.html" title="Philippine Army">Filipino</a> forces to break though on the 24th to the Gloucesters was beaten back, and on the 25th, all resistance on Gloster Hill was crushed. In the 3 days of fighting, the determined resistance of 29 Bde severely disrupted the Chinese offensive, causing it to lose momentum and allowed UN forces in the area to withdraw to the No-Name Line, a defensible position north of Seoul, where the PVA were halted.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>

<p>The Gloucestershire Regiment were assigned to guard one of the crossings across the Imjin River. When the Chinese first attacked, they were held up by only a couple hundred men at the crossing, now called "Gloster Crossing". But the Chinese kept attacking, and the men at Gloster Crossing ran out of ammunition. They had no choice; reduced to only one officer and less than sixty men, and relying entirely on supporting artillery, they had to fall back and rejoin the rest of the battalion on Gloster Hill.</p>
<p>The Glosters were fighting off the Chinese, but things were getting precarious. The Glosters were almost surrounded. Acting in desperation, Brodey sent a column of tanks up the only road to Gloster Hill, determining to blast his way throuth to the Glosters. But then disaster struck when the lead tank was hit. The tank was blown sideways, blocking the route; all hope of getting through to the Glosters vanished. Brodey's tanks left the Glosters to their fate.</p>
<p>During the course of the battle, (and true to their actions at <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Alexandria_8000.html" title="Battle of Alexandria">Battle of Alexandria</a> in 1801 for which the regiment has the distinction of wearing <a href="../../../c/a/p/Cap_badge.html" title="Cap badge">badges</a> both at the front and at the back of their head-dress), the 1st Battalion, <a href="../../../g/l/o/Gloucestershire_Regiment_beeb.html" title="Gloucestershire Regiment">Gloucestershire Regiment</a> (the Glorious Glosters), and their mortar battery — numbering at most 750 men in total — fought on when surrounded on <a href="../../../g/l/o/Gloster_Hill_84f6.html" title="Gloster Hill">Gloster Hill</a> by at least 4 Chinese divisions of 10,000 men.</p>
<p>Finally towards the end of the struggle, some of the Glosters prepared for the fight of their lives. Those Glosters who could planned to try to make a break for it. Those who could not run would spend the last of their ammunition providing cover fire. The Glosters set out.</p>
<p>The Gloucestershire Regiment had started the Battle of the Imjin with between 700-750 men. At the end of the battle, only 63 Glosters had made it back to the Allied lines. The rest were either killed or captured.</p>

The citation says:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>The 1st. Battalion, Gloucestershire Regiment, British Army and Troop C. 170th Independent Mortar Battery, Royal Artillery, attached, are cited for exceptionally outstanding performance of duty and extraordinary heroism in action against the armed enemy near Solma-ri, Korea on the 23rd, 24th, and 25th&#160;of April 1951.</i></dd>
<dd><i>The 1st. Battalion and Troop C were defending a very critical sector of the battle front during a determined attack by the enemy. The defending units were overwhelmingly outnumbered.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>The 63rd Chinese Communist Army drove the full force of its savage assault at the positions held by the 1st Battalion, Gloucestershire Regiment and attached unit. The route of supply ran southeast from the Battalion between two hills.</i></dd>
<dd><i>The hills dominated the surrounding terrain northwest to <a href="../../../i/m/j/Imjin_River_c12b.html" title="Imjin River">Imjin River</a>. Enemy pressure built up on the battalion front during the day, 23&#160;April. On 24&#160;April, the weight of the attack had driven the right flank of the battalion back. The pressure grew heavier and heavier and the battalion and attached unit were forced into a perimeter defense on Hill 235. During the night, heavy enemy forces had by-passed the staunch defenders and closed all avenues of escape. The courageous soldiers of the battalion and attached unit were holding the critical route selected by the enemy for one column of the general offensive designed to encircle and destroy I Corps. These gallant soldiers would not retreat. As they were compressed tighter and tighter in their perimeter defense, they called for close-in air strikes to assist in holding firm. Completely surrounded by tremendous numbers, these indomitable, resolute, and tenacious soldiers fought back with unsurpassed fortitude and courage. As ammunition ran low and the advancing hordes moved closer and closer, these splendid soldiers fought back viciously to prevent the enemy from overrunning the position and moving rapidly on the south. Their heroic stand provided the critically needed time to regroup other I Corps units and block the southern advance of the enemy. Time and again efforts were made to reach the battalion, but the enemy strength blocked each effort. Without thought of defeat or surrender, this heroic force demonstrated superb battlefield courage and discipline. Every yard of ground they surrendered was covered with enemy dead until the last gallant soldier of the fighting battalion was overpowered by the final surge of the enemy masses. The 1st. Battalion, Gloucestershire Regiment and Trop C. 170th. Independent Mortar Battery displayed such gallantry, determination, and esprit de corps in accomplishing their mission under extremely difficult and hazardous conditions as to set them apart and above other units participating in the same battle. Their sustained brilliance in battle, their resoluteness, and extraordinary heroism are in keeping with the finest traditions of the renowned military forces of the British Commonwealth, and reflect unsurpassed credit on these courageous soldiers and their homeland.</i></dd>

<dd><i>The Belgian battalion with the Luxemburg detachment of the UN Forces in Korea is mentioned for exceptional execution of its missions and for its remarkable heroism in its actions against the enemy on the Imjin, near <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hantan_River_2b91.html" title="Hantan River">Hantangang</a>, Korea during the period from 20 till 26&#160;April 1951. The Belgian battalion with the Luxemburg detachment, one of the smallest units of the UNO in Korea, has inflicted thirty-fold losses on the enemy compared to its own, due to its aggressive and courageous actions against the Communist Chinese. During this period considerable enemy forces, supported by fire by machine guns, mortars and artillery, repeatedly and heavily attacked the positions held by the battalion but, Belgians and Luxembourgers have continuously and bravely repulsed these fanatic attacks by inflicting heavy losses to the enemy forces. When the Chinese troops had succeeded in occupying positions endangering the liaison with the allied neighboring units, The Belgian battalion with the Luxembourg detachment launched furious counter-attacks with the bayonet. The enemy, surprised by the tenacity of these attacks became disorganised and withdrew in disorder. Finally, the Belgian-Luxembourg battalion withdrew by order of higher authority, evacuated its wounded, was resupplied and requested to be put back in the line. Having arrived at the frontline again, numerous enemy infantry and cavalry units were observed heading south. When the enemy was sufficiently close, the Belgian-Luxembourg battalion launched a rain of mortar shells with the devastating effect that its front area was covered with bodies. When the Chinese communists continued to bring in fresh troops in the attack, the Belgian-Luxembourg troops fought a successful delaying battle which enabled the adjoining positions to be methodically evacuated with minimum losses. The Belgian battalion with the Luxemburg detachment has shown so much proof of courage, decision and esprit de corps in the accomplishment of its missions during these actions in difficult and hazardous circumstances, that it has to be placed above any other units participating in these actions. The extraordinary courage shown by the members of this units during this period has bestowed extraordinary honor on their country and on themselves</i></dd>
