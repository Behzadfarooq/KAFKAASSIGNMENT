<p>Terry was born in <a href="../../../g/o/t/Gotham_City_7766.html" title="Gotham City">Gotham City</a> on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_27.html" title="June 27">June 27</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/2/2023.html" title="2023">2023</a>, to <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warren_%26_Mary_McGinnis_7356.html" title="Warren &amp; Mary McGinnis">Warren</a> and <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warren_%26_Mary_McGinnis_7356.html" title="Warren &amp; Mary McGinnis">Mary McGinnis</a>. By his own admission, he was once a "bad kid." A member of a street gang run by youthful racketeer Charlie "Big Time" Bigelow, Terry had his fair share of run-ins with the <a href="../../../g/o/t/Gotham_City_Police_Department_c62a.html" title="Gotham City Police Department">Gotham City Police</a> while in his early teens, even serving a three-month stint in <a href="../../../j/u/v/Juvenile_hall.html" title="Juvenile hall">juvenile hall</a>. Years after <a href="../../../b/a/t/Batman.html" title="Batman">Batman</a> was last seen, he found himself on the run from another street gang, the <a href="../../../j/o/k/Jokerz.html" title="Jokerz">Jokerz</a>, who had modeled themselves after the deceased <a href="../../../j/o/k/Joker_%28comics%29.html" title="Joker (comics)">Clown Prince of Crime</a>. Terry fled onto the grounds of <a href="../../../w/a/y/Wayne_Manor_1f40.html" title="Wayne Manor">Wayne Manor</a>, where an aged <a href="../../../b/r/u/Bruce_Wayne_68b8.html" title="Bruce Wayne">Bruce Wayne</a> came to his defense. The strain of the fight placed substantial stress on Bruce's <a href="../../../h/e/a/Heart.html" title="Heart">heart</a>, and he collapsed. Terry helped Bruce into the mansion and in the process, stumbled upon the entrance to the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Batcave.html" title="Batcave">Batcave</a>.</p>
<p>After Bruce kicked him out, Terry returned home to find his father murdered, and later discovered that <a href="../../../d/e/r/Derek_Powers_1408.html" title="Derek Powers">Derek Powers</a> — who had assumed leadership of a merged Wayne-Powers — was responsible. He sought Bruce's assistance to bringing Powers down, but despite Terry's insistence, Bruce, still shaken from the ordeal of having relied on a <a href="../../../g/u/n/Gun.html" title="Gun">gun</a> for self-defense, maintained that he had given up the cowl. However, that did not deter Terry in the slightest. As soon as Bruce's back was turned, Terry took matters into his own hands and stole the latest incarnation of the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Batsuit.html" title="Batsuit">Batsuit</a>. Bruce admonished him through the suit's <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radio_communications.html" title="Radio communications">communicator</a> (their mentor-pupil <a href="../../../b/a/n/Banter.html" title="Banter">banter</a> would become a staple of subsequent <i><a href="../../../b/a/t/Batman_Beyond_1992.html" title="Batman Beyond">Batman Beyond</a></i> episodes), but Terry was adamant on confronting Powers, who had ordered Warren's death after the latter discovered Powers' plan to mass-produce <a href="../../../b/i/o/Biological_weapons.html" title="Biological weapons">biological weapons</a>.</p>
<p>The high-tech Batsuit turned Terry into a powerhouse; he disrupted Powers' covert operation, laying a beating on the security personnel, only to have Bruce shut the suit down midway at the touch of a button. Terry pleaded with Bruce for a chance to prove himself, and appealed to the murder of Bruce's parents, as the man who killed Terry's father was on the bio-weapon hover-transport and that it was his only chance to avenge his father, which persuaded Bruce to reactivate the Batsuit and let him carry on as Batman for the time being. Bruce's decision resulted in the moratorium of Powers' operation; in the end, Powers, who had been exposed to his own hazardous chemicals, experienced the onset of his mutation into <a href="../../../d/e/r/Derek_Powers_1408.html" title="Derek Powers">Blight</a>.</p>
<p>Convinced that there was still a need for a Batman, Bruce hired Terry as his personal assistant and began secretly training him for his new role as Batman. In addition, Bruce assisted Terry in the field primarily by keeping in continual contact with the boy at the Batcave.</p>
<p>After Powers' criminal identity was revealed to the public and he finally brought retribution to his father's killers, Terry decided to continue his role as Batman to make up for his past sins, in hope that his heroic role is his chance at <a href="../../../r/e/d/Redemption.html" title="Redemption">redemption</a>. Even though Bruce decided to fight crime after his parents were murdered, Terry has a different reason to continue since his father's killers paid for their crime toward his family. Before Warren was murdered, Terry always felt guilty about letting his family and friends down because of his past as a juvenile delinquent. Because of this, he always tries to find a way to make up for what he's done – trying his best at school, joining athletic teams, and helping others, in the hope that someday people will see him differently. Terry originally assumed the role of Batman for his father, but eventually sees it as a chance to help people and to look like a worthwhile human being again, in his eyes if in no one else's.</p>

<p>Despite his role as the new <a href="../../../b/a/t/Batman.html" title="Batman">Batman</a>, Terry and Bruce lead very different lives. In addition to coping with his father's death, Terry struggles to keep his secret identity from his mother and younger brother, much like <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robin_%28Tim_Drake%29_68f1.html" title="Robin (Tim Drake)">Tim Drake</a> did during his tenure as <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robin_%28comics%29.html" title="Robin (comics)">Robin</a> in the comics. Because of his responsibilities as Batman, he was not afforded the same licenses the Robins enjoyed and was expected to be on the call whenever he was needed. As a result, Terry was just barely successful at balancing out his dual life, and the issue of him sacrificing his civilian life for his costumed one or neglecting his duties as Batman due to personal commitments became a source of tension between mentor and pupil, on several occasions prompting both men to reconsider Terry's reliability.</p>
<p>Terry and Bruce developed a respect for each other, with Terry regarding Bruce as a surrogate father. This was demonstrated in the episode "<a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Batman_Beyond_episodes_4543.html" title="List of Batman Beyond episodes">Sneak Peek</a>" where Terry pays reporter Ian Peek a visit to plead on Bruce's behalf:</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>Peek:</b> "He was the original Batman, wasn't he? Wasn't he?"</dd>
<dd><b>Terry:</b> "I don't care what you do to me, but he doesn't deserve this. He's done too much for this city to wind up in the middle of a media circus."</dd>
<dd><b>Peek:</b> "He means a lot to you, doesn't he?"</dd>
<dd><b>Terry:</b> "Yes...he does."</dd>
</dl>
<p>In turn, Bruce treated Terry the same way he treated <a href="../../../d/i/c/Dick_Grayson_3d69.html" title="Dick Grayson">Dick Grayson</a> and <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robin_%28Tim_Drake%29_68f1.html" title="Robin (Tim Drake)">Tim Drake</a>, possibly because of Terry's youth and inexperience. In time, Terry grew into the cowl, and Bruce grew to accept him as his heir. The Justice League Unlimited episode "<a href="../../../e/p/i/Epilogue_%28Justice_League_Unlimited%29_ad8d.html" title="Epilogue (Justice League Unlimited)">Epilogue</a>" reveals that Terry is Bruce's biological son, though it is unknown if Bruce is aware of this fact.</p>

<p>Terry valued his mother, <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warren_%26_Mary_McGinnis_7356.html" title="Warren &amp; Mary McGinnis">Mary McGinnis</a>, and his younger brother, <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matt_McGinnis_7531.html" title="Matt McGinnis">Matt</a>, as the closest family he had left. At the time of his death, Warren was <a href="../../../d/i/v/Divorce.html" title="Divorce">divorced</a> from his wife and their sons split between them: Terry with his father, Matt with his mother. After the divorce, Terry's relationship with his father was shown in the episode "<a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Batman_Beyond_episodes_4543.html" title="List of Batman Beyond episodes">Rebirth</a>" to be strained. After Warren's death, Terry moved back in with his mother.</p>
<p>Even though there existed the obligatory spark of <a href="../../../s/i/b/Sibling_rivalry.html" title="Sibling rivalry">sibling rivalry</a> and <a href="../../../t/o/u/Tough_love.html" title="Tough love">tough love</a> between him and Matt, Terry would be there to raise his brother's spirits when he was feeling down, notably on one occasion in the episode "<a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Batman_Beyond_episodes_4543.html" title="List of Batman Beyond episodes">Revenant</a>" when Matt was reminiscing about their father.</p>
<p>As far as Mary and Matt were concerned, Terry was simply employed by <a href="../../../b/r/u/Bruce_Wayne_68b8.html" title="Bruce Wayne">Bruce Wayne</a> to run errands. They found the idea of Terry being <a href="../../../b/a/t/Batman.html" title="Batman">Batman</a> to be absurd, and ridiculed him when he once attempted to reveal his secret in the episode "<a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Batman_Beyond_episodes_4543.html" title="List of Batman Beyond episodes">Sneek Peek</a>".</p>

<p><a href="../../../m/a/x/Maxine__Max__Gibson_e518.html" title="Maxine &quot;Max&quot; Gibson">Maxine "Max" Gibson</a> was Terry's classmate and closest friend. Exceptionally capable when it came to <a href="../../../c/o/m/Computers.html" title="Computers">computers</a> and <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electronics.html" title="Electronics">electronics</a>, Max created a program that succeeded in uncovering <a href="../../../b/a/t/Batman.html" title="Batman">Batman</a>'s <a href="../../../s/e/c/Secret_identity.html" title="Secret identity">secret identity</a>. After unmasking Terry, she insisted on being a part of his secret life and helped him with everything from <a href="../../../c/o/m/Computer_hacking.html" title="Computer hacking">computer hacking</a> to <a href="../../../b/a/b/Babysitting.html" title="Babysitting">babysitting</a> to detective work to coming up with excuses for him to give his girlfriend, Dana. Terry and Max remained close, but their relationship was never shown to exceed the boundaries of friendship. Max is, essentially, Terry's version of <a href="../../../a/l/f/Alfred_Pennyworth_d0b8.html" title="Alfred Pennyworth">Alfred Pennyworth</a>, and Terry even jokingly referred to her as such on one occasion.</p>
<p>The show has been revisited several times since its cancellation, in <a href="../../../j/u/s/Justice_League_%28animated_series%29_2edc.html" title="Justice League (animated series)">Justice League</a> and in the movie <i><a href="../../../r/e/t/Return_of_the_Joker_3918.html" title="Return of the Joker">Return of the Joker</a></i>, but Max has not been seen nor mentioned in any of these.</p>

<p>Although Terry flirted with several girls throughout the show, his true love has always been Dana, whom he met while attending Hamilton Hill High School. In the episode "<a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Batman_Beyond_episodes_4543.html" title="List of Batman Beyond episodes">Big Time</a>", she recognized Charlie Bigelow by sight, suggesting that Dana and Terry were already together at age 14. Despite their commitment to each other, their relationship was strained as Terry struggled early on as <a href="../../../b/a/t/Batman.html" title="Batman">Batman</a> to balance his dual obligations. The two verged on the possibility of breaking up multiple times, especially when Terry met Melanie Walker, AKA Ten of the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Flush_Gang_418a.html" title="Royal Flush Gang">Royal Flush Gang</a>.</p>
<p>However, as the <i><a href="../../../j/u/s/Justice_League_Unlimited_c8c8.html" title="Justice League Unlimited">Justice League Unlimited</a></i> episode "<a href="../../../e/p/i/Epilogue_%28Justice_League_Unlimited_episode%29_0491.html" title="Epilogue (Justice League Unlimited episode)">Epilogue</a>" reveals, Terry ultimately grows into full acceptance of his role as <a href="../../../b/a/t/Batman.html" title="Batman">Batman</a>, and somewhere along the line disclosed his secret to Dana. Although it takes him some time to get over his fears for her safety in the event that his identity is ever compromised, Terry eventually proposes to Dana.</p>
<p><a name="Melanie_Walker.2FTen" id="Melanie_Walker.2FTen"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/t/Batman_%28Terry_McGinnis%29_ef05.html" title="Edit section: Melanie Walker/Ten">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Melanie Walker/Ten</span></h3>
<p>In the midst of a breakup with Dana, Terry met Melanie Walker and the two became attracted to one another. However, Terry was crushed when he learned she too led a double life—as Ten, the youngest member of the latest incarnation of the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Flush_Gang_418a.html" title="Royal Flush Gang">Royal Flush Gang</a>. In a burst of clarity, he discarded a note Melanie had left him before he apprehended her as <a href="../../../b/a/t/Batman.html" title="Batman">Batman</a>, choosing instead not to read it, and went back to Dana, while Melanie remained in the dark about her enemy and her love being the same person.</p>
<p>Terry would have future encounters with Ten and the Royal Flush Gang, and each time, he advised her to turn straight, showing that he still cared deeply about her. Their relationship is somewhat reminiscent of the one the original Batman had with <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catwoman.html" title="Catwoman">Catwoman</a>, and Bruce even notes it.</p>

<p>Terry upheld tradition by forging an alliance with <a href="../../../g/o/t/Gotham_City_7766.html" title="Gotham City">Gotham City</a>'s <a href="../../../p/o/l/Police_Commissioner_e958.html" title="Police Commissioner">Police Commissioner</a>, <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barbara_Gordon_c354.html" title="Barbara Gordon">Barbara Gordon</a>, the daughter of <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Gordon_%28comics%29_3507.html" title="James Gordon (comics)">James Gordon</a> and formerly <a href="../../../b/a/t/Batgirl.html" title="Batgirl">Batgirl</a>, the original <a href="../../../b/a/t/Batman.html" title="Batman">Batman</a>'s trusted ally. The alliance started out a rocky one, as Barbara never failed to take Terry's juvenile record into account and believed he was too reckless for the role of Batman. The fact that Terry occasionally ruined police <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stakeout.html" title="Stakeout">stakeout</a> operations by intervening without fully assessing the situation sometimes bore that belief out.</p>
<p>Barbara was reluctant to assist the new Batman and to have a teenager as <a href="../../../g/o/t/Gotham_City_7766.html" title="Gotham City">Gotham</a>'s new protector. The direct-to-video movie <i><a href="../../../r/e/t/Batman_Beyond%7E_Return_of_the_Joker_e85a.html" title="Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker">Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker</a></i> revealed that Barbara remains haunted by the torture and humiliation <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robin_%28Tim_Drake%29_68f1.html" title="Robin (Tim Drake)">Tim Drake</a> long ago suffered at the hands of the <a href="../../../j/o/k/Joker_%28comics%29.html" title="Joker (comics)">the Joker</a>. She advised Terry to give up being Batman, and once tried to arrest him after he was framed for murder of criminal Mad Stan by <a href="../../../s/p/e/Spellbinder_%28DC_Comics%29_a4d8.html" title="Spellbinder (DC Comics)">Spellbinder</a>. However, realizing that she couldn't deter him anymore than she could've been deterred from being Batgirl, Barbara relented.</p>
<p>Barbara eventually warmed up to Terry, assisting him when Bruce was put out of action by a revived Joker. She stated that she hoped Terry would avoid the lonely existence that Bruce eventually led. However, Barbara's attitude was different from James Gordon's, and she noted once that she was "not my(her) father", never working as closely with Terry as her father did with Bruce. (i.e. using a <a href="../../../b/a/t/Bat-signal.html" title="Bat-signal">Bat-signal</a>, directly giving him cases, etc.)</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/t/Batman_%28Terry_McGinnis%29_ef05.html" title="Edit section: Charlie Bigelow">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Charlie Bigelow</span></h3>
<p>One of the characters to have the most influence on Terry's childhood was Charlie Bigelow, a young swindler who dragged Terry into a life of crime. In the episode "<a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Batman_Beyond_episodes_4543.html" title="List of Batman Beyond episodes">Big Time</a>", Terry states that <i>"Charlie was 18 and I was 14. Then Charlie decided to prove himself to this big gang and he dragged me along on a heist. I didn't even know what we were doing until he was climbing in the window. Next thing I knew, the cops were shouting 'Freeze' and I was doing 90 days in juvie. That was a slap on the wrist next to Charlie. He was in prison for three years."</i> After this, Terry carried a guilty feeling toward Charlie; he would e-mail Charlie periodically while he was in prison.</p>
<p>Despite Terry's friendship with Bigelow and the regret that his time in jail didn't reform him, subsequent events in the episode "<a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Batman_Beyond_episodes_4543.html" title="List of Batman Beyond episodes">Betrayal</a>" make clear that this friendship was never truly reciprocated by Bigelow who viewed Terry as hired muscle and a pawn while he unseated a crime lord known as the Major. Terry finally lets go of his guilt toward Charlie and sees the monster he really is.</p>

<p>Terry grew up admiring other superheroes of his day, the <a href="../../../j/u/s/Justice_League_Unlimited_c8c8.html" title="Justice League Unlimited">Justice League Unlimited</a>. Eventually, he was recruited by <a href="../../../s/u/p/Superman.html" title="Superman">Superman</a> to root out a traitor in the team...who turned out to be Superman himself, under the control of an <a href="../../../e/x/t/Extraterrestrial_life_in_popular_culture.html" title="Extraterrestrial life in popular culture">extraterrestrial</a> creature. Though initially the rest of the team distrusted him due to his perceived inexperience, Terry gained their trust by saving their lives.</p>
<p>While Terry apparently departed the team after freeing Superman from the alien's mind control, he seems to have rejoined, as later episodes of <i><a href="../../../j/u/s/Justice_League_Unlimited_c8c8.html" title="Justice League Unlimited">Justice League Unlimited</a></i> show him as a regular member (and possibly leader).</p>

Terry McGinnis, age 32.</div>

</div>
<p>In the <i><a href="../../../j/u/s/Justice_League_Unlimited_c8c8.html" title="Justice League Unlimited">Justice League Unlimited</a></i> episode "<a href="../../../e/p/i/Epilogue_%28Justice_League_Unlimited_episode%29_0491.html" title="Epilogue (Justice League Unlimited episode)">Epilogue</a>", which transpires 15 years after <i><a href="../../../b/a/t/Batman_Beyond_1992.html" title="Batman Beyond">Batman Beyond</a></i>, Terry discovers the shocking truth about his parentage. When the elderly <a href="../../../b/r/u/Bruce_Wayne_68b8.html" title="Bruce Wayne">Bruce Wayne</a> requires tissue for the cloning of a <a href="../../../k/i/d/Kidney.html" title="Kidney">kidney</a> to transplant, Terry is checked for compatibility, and to his surprise, his <a href="../../../d/n/a/DNA_396c.html" title="DNA">DNA</a> is similar to Bruce's.</p>
<p>Decades earlier, government agent <a href="../../../a/m/a/Amanda_Waller_81d9.html" title="Amanda Waller">Amanda Waller</a> launched a program using her old <a href="../../../p/r/o/Project_Cadmus_5a1b.html" title="Project Cadmus">Project Cadmus</a> connections, codenaming it <b>Project Batman Beyond</b>. Despite the often antagonistic relationship she had with Batman, Waller had surmised Bruce's secret identity, and, as years passed, she came to believe that the world would always need a Batman. Retrieving genetic samples from injuries Batman sustained while fighting crime, she obtained the necessary <a href="../../../d/n/a/DNA_396c.html" title="DNA">DNA</a> for the next phase of her project.</p>
<p>Tests run found a compatible couple with psychological profiles nearly identical to Thomas and Martha Wayne in <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warren_%26_Mary_McGinnis_7356.html" title="Warren &amp; Mary McGinnis">Warren</a> and <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warren_%26_Mary_McGinnis_7356.html" title="Warren &amp; Mary McGinnis">Mary McGinnis</a>. When Warren went in for an <a href="../../../f/l/u/Flu_shot.html" title="Flu shot">flu shot</a>, he was secretly administered a dose of <a href="../../../n/a/n/Nanotechnology.html" title="Nanotechnology">nanites</a> that rewrote the genetic code of his reproductive material into an exact copy of Bruce Wayne's. Thus, Bruce is Terry's biological father, and Matt's by proxy. Upon learning this, Terry contemplates giving up being Batman, believing that Bruce machinated this from the very beginning. However, after meeting with Waller, he discovers that Bruce knew nothing about Project Batman Beyond, and he became Batman by pure chance.</p>
<p>Waller hired The Phantasm, <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrea_Beaumont_2041.html" title="Andrea Beaumont">Andrea Beaumont</a> (the love interest and villain from <i><a href="../../../m/a/s/Mask_of_the_Phantasm_91d6.html" title="Mask of the Phantasm">Mask of the Phantasm</a></i>) to assassinate Warren and Mary, to simulate the circumstances that propelled Bruce to become Batman. But Andrea abandoned her mission at the last minute; knowing first hand what losing his parents had done to Bruce, she refused to force another innocent child to suffer, also believing that continuing the Batman legacy by such methods would betray everything Bruce stood for. Andrea managed to convince Waller of her viewpoint, and Waller never again tried to have Warren and Mary killed. In spite of this, Warren was murdered years later by <a href="../../../d/e/r/Derek_Powers_1408.html" title="Derek Powers">Derek Powers</a>, and Project Batman Beyond ended up succeeding.</p>
<p>Once he leaves Waller's home with this knowledge, Terry comes to terms with the reality that Bruce is technically his biological father, prepares to propose to Dana (who now knows his secret identity), and returns to the role of Batman.</p>
<p>According to episode writer <a href="../../../d/w/a/Dwayne_McDuffie_8d61.html" title="Dwayne McDuffie">Dwayne McDuffie</a>, Bruce, as the world's greatest detective, became aware that Terry and Matt are his genetic offspring at some point after Terry assumed the role of Batman, and figured out the machinations of Waller and Project Cadmus. However, he never brought it up as he wanted Terry to be his own man, and out of respect for Warren McGinnis. <a href="http://jl.toonzone.net/episode50/episode50.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://jl.toonzone.net/episode50/episode50.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>

<p>In addition to the training he received from <a href="../../../b/r/u/Bruce_Wayne_68b8.html" title="Bruce Wayne">Bruce Wayne</a>, Terry appeared at least to be an able street-fighter. In the first part of the pilot episode, "<a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Batman_Beyond_episodes_4543.html" title="List of Batman Beyond episodes">Rebirth</a>," he participated in his high school's wrestling team, and he fended off several Jokerz alone, displaying uncommon agility and tenacity for a civilian. Under Bruce's tutelage, Terry has honed his body to at least <a href="../../../o/l/y/Olympic_Games_4ea8.html" title="Olympic Games">Olympic</a> levels. As expected of <a href="../../../b/a/t/Batman.html" title="Batman">Batman</a>, he engages in regular, rigorous training to minimize his reliance on the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Batsuit.html" title="Batsuit">Batsuit</a>.</p>
<p>Terry has engaged in combat outside of the Batsuit at various instances, at one time going up against the Batsuit itself when it was possessed by a <a href="../../../c/y/b/Cyberpathy.html" title="Cyberpathy">cyberpathic</a> entity. His training has granted him exceptional reflexes, enabling him to evade gunfire and make impressive leaping attempts whether in or out of the Batsuit. In one instance, without the suit's aid, Terry survived a fall from several stories high by bounding off a pillar that was about to crush him, and landed on his feet.</p>
<p>In "<a href="../../../e/p/i/Epilogue_%28Justice_League_Unlimited_episode%29_0491.html" title="Epilogue (Justice League Unlimited episode)">Epilogue</a>," <a href="../../../a/m/a/Amanda_Waller_81d9.html" title="Amanda Waller">Amanda Waller</a> comments that Terry has inherited all of Bruce's qualities, though she does note that "You don't quite have his magnificent brain." Though he possesses a remarkably above-average <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intellect.html" title="Intellect">intellect</a> and has been trained by Bruce as a <a href="../../../d/e/t/Detective.html" title="Detective">detective</a>, Terry is by no means a <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genius.html" title="Genius">genius</a>. He seems to be a capable <a href="../../../a/c/t/Actor.html" title="Actor">actor</a>, having successfully conned his way in and out of many sticky situations.</p>
<p>As Batman, Terry emulates Bruce's deep, harsh tone. He does this of his own accord, to separate the entities of Terry and Batman (Terry can be heard using his "Batman voice" outside of the Batsuit in the episode "<a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Batman_Beyond_episodes_4543.html" title="List of Batman Beyond episodes">Shriek</a>").</p>

<p>The <a href="../../../b/a/t/Batsuit.html" title="Batsuit">Batsuit</a> currently utilized by Terry was actually almost 18 years old at the time of the series' inception. However, its <a href="../../../t/e/c/Technology.html" title="Technology">technology</a> is so advanced that the Batsuit is still considered state-of-the-art. One of the most notable features of the suit is that it now covers the entire face, a departure from previous costumes (though <a href="../../../b/a/t/Batman.html" title="Batman">Batman</a>'s mouth is still left exposed, a possible design flaw, especially when faced with opponents like <a href="../../../i/n/q/Inque.html" title="Inque">Inque</a>). The cape has been eliminated, being replaced by <a href="../../../g/l/i/Glider.html" title="Glider">glider</a> wings along the armpits. <a href="../../../t/h/r/Thruster.html" title="Thruster">Thrusters</a> built into the boots allow Batman to fly in the absence of wind. However, for long range flight, he has an aerial version of the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Batmobile.html" title="Batmobile">Batmobile</a> to use.</p>
<p>The Batsuit conforms to the size and physique of its wearer, as seen by how it was able to fit both Terry and Bruce, who had different physical statures at the time. It is very durable, being able to withstand massive concussive forces (it was able to sustain blows from <a href="../../../s/u/p/Superman.html" title="Superman">Superman</a>), <a href="../../../f/i/r/Fire.html" title="Fire">fire</a>, <a href="../../../l/a/s/Lasers.html" title="Lasers">lasers</a>, electric shocks, underwater pressure, and wind force.</p>
<p>The Batsuit grants Batman the following abilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enhanced strength by a factor of ten.</li>
<li>Minimal reduction (or increase) in flexibility.</li>
<li>Enhanced visual assistance that allows him to <a href="../../../n/i/g/Night_vision.html" title="Night vision">see in the dark</a> (visual from the Batsuit can be fed back to the main computer in the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Batcave.html" title="Batcave">Batcave</a>; it can also receive visual from the main computer, allowing for superior tactical planning). The visor can also serve as digital <a href="../../../b/i/n/Binoculars.html" title="Binoculars">binoculars</a> and an <a href="../../../i/n/f/Infra-red.html" title="Infra-red">infra-red</a> filter.</li>
<li>Personal communicator allows Terry to keep in constant contact with Bruce at the Batcave.</li>
<li>Enhanced ballistic protection.</li>
<li>Significantly resistant to <a href="../../../h/e/a/Heat.html" title="Heat">heat</a>, <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electricity.html" title="Electricity">electricity</a>, <a href="../../../w/a/t/Water.html" title="Water">water</a>, and vibrations, but only slightly resistant to <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radiation.html" title="Radiation">radiation</a>.</li>
<li>Built-in <a href="../../../r/e/b/Rebreather.html" title="Rebreather">rebreather</a> for underwater combat/exploration.</li>
<li>Dispensable <a href="../../../b/a/t/Batarang.html" title="Batarang">Batarangs</a> with a range of auxiliary functions, such as producing electric shocks. However, there is a limit to the amount of Batarangs the Batsuit can dispense; Batman has run out on at least one occasion.</li>
<li>Electrical discharges throughout the suit that can be activated by pushing the button on the belt.</li>

<li>Launchable tracers.</li>
<li>A retractable <a href="../../../p/i/n/PIN_cdbc.html" title="PIN">PIN</a> or password decipherer in the form of a key on the right index finger.</li>
<li>Retractable wings under the arms to glide on.</li>

A countermeasure used by Commissioner <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barbara_Gordon_c354.html" title="Barbara Gordon">Barbara Gordon</a> to this in one incident where she was hunting Batman down was through tracking him using an <a href="../../../u/l/t/Ultraviolet_light.html" title="Ultraviolet light">ultraviolet light</a> to illuminate him. The origin of the <a href="../../../c/l/o/Cloaking_device.html" title="Cloaking device">cloaking device</a> could be based on the failed light refractive polymer developed in the <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/Batman%7E_The_Animated_Series_3563.html" title="Batman: The Animated Series">Batman: The Animated Series</a></i> episode "See No Evil." The reason the <a href="../../../i/n/v/Invisibility.html" title="Invisibility">invisibility</a> plastic failed in the <i>B:TAS</i> episode was that sending electrical current through the material caused it to become toxic, affecting the mind as well as the body. This did not cause concern for an ex-con who made a suit and covered his car in the plastic, going on a crime spree and kidnapping his daughter. Regardless, the original Batman may have saved samples of the plastic and/or the research notes and resolved the toxicity issues, incorporating them into the <i>Beyond</i> <a href="../../../b/a/t/Batsuit.html" title="Batsuit">Batsuit</a>.</li>
<li>Retractable claws which can be used to slice or facilitate climbing.</li>
<li>Can uplink with the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Batmobile.html" title="Batmobile">Batmobile</a> for remote piloting.</li>

<p>The <a href="../../../b/a/t/Batsuit.html" title="Batsuit">Batsuit</a> augments Terry's physical prowess considerably, and thus he is sometimes prone to complacency in the midst of danger. Terry favors jibing his opponents, even when defusing volatile situations, though this trait may be productive depending on the opponent he is facing. When he faced <a href="../../../j/o/k/Joker_%28comics%29.html" title="Joker (comics)">the Joker</a>, he was able to get under the villain's skin and gain the upper hand by mocking his opponent and laughing out loud – something Bruce Wayne never did.

<p>In addition to having his own ongoing <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comic_book.html" title="Comic book">comic book</a>, the Tomorrow Knight made an appearance in <i>Superman Adventures</i> #64, chasing a futuristic version of <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brainiac_%28comics%29.html" title="Brainiac (comics)">Brainiac</a>.</p>
