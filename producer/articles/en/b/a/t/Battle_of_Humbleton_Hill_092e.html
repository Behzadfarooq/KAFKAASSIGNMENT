<p>Angered by the setback at Nesbit, Douglas appealed to <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Stewart%2C_1st_Duke_of_Albany_f458.html" title="Robert Stewart, 1st Duke of Albany">Robert Stewart, 1st Duke of Albany</a>, the regent of Scotland. By early September troops were beginning to concentrate on the east march. A party of French knights came, having recently arrived in the country. Douglas was also joined by forces led by Murdoch Stewart, Albany's eldest son, his kinsman, <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Douglas%2C_1st_Earl_of_Angus_02f1.html" title="George Douglas, 1st Earl of Angus">George Douglas, 1st Earl of Angus</a>, Thomas Dunbar, <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earl_of_Moray_e83c.html" title="Earl of Moray">Earl of Moray</a>, and a party of Gallwegians, led by Fergus Macdouall. Other contingents were headed by the chiefs of the houses of Erskine, Grahame, Montgomery, Seton, Sinclair, Lesley and the Stewarts of Angus, Lorn and Durisdeer. This was a national rather than a border army, comprising some 10000 men in all.</p>
<p>By early August <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_IV_of_England_6f6d.html" title="Henry IV of England">Henry IV</a> was aware of the build-up of hostile forces on the border. He ordered the sheriff of Lincoln to hold his troops in readiness to assist the <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_Percy%2C_1st_Earl_of_Northumberland_c161.html" title="Henry Percy, 1st Earl of Northumberland">Henry Percy, 1st Earl of Northumberland</a> if necessary; but beyond that he was content to leave matters to the northern levies.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Humbleton_Hill_092e.html" title="Edit section: Storm Let Loose">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Storm Let Loose</span></h2>
<p>The storm finally broke at harvest time. Dense columns of Scots crossed the border, in all probability following the same route that the second earl of Douglas had in 1388; but this was no surprise attack: the whole countryside was alerted to the presence of the enemy. Moving eastwards without interruption Douglas marched through Northumberland onwards into <a href="../../../c/o/u/County_Durham_194a.html" title="County Durham">County Durham</a>, ravaging and plundering all the way. On the advice of George, Earl of Dunbar and March but now an ally of the English, the Percies decided to let them come on, with the intention of intercepting them on the return, when their progress would be slowed by plundered livestock. The whole countryside gave way before the invaders. It is estimated that over 1000 people left Northumberland, fleeing south in pursuit of refuge. Panic spread to <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newcastle_upon_Tyne_155c.html" title="Newcastle upon Tyne">Newcastle</a>, where 100 armed men were detailed to watch the walls every night for the duration of the emergency, and armed vessels stood ready on the <a href="../../../t/y/n/Tyne.html" title="Tyne">Tyne</a>.</p>
<p>Archibald Douglas, who clearly was attempting to cast himself in the role of the heroic second earl, appears to have been blind to the dangers into which the army was being drawn. English troops were concentrating at <a href="../../../a/l/n/Alnwick.html" title="Alnwick">Alnwick</a> and Dunstanburgh Castle to the north of his position, poised to cut off his retreat. Douglas also seems to have been blinded to reality by the comforting illusion that the victory at <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Otterburn_9640.html" title="Battle of Otterburn">Otterburn</a> had given the Scots a decisive edge over their opponents-failing to appreciate how close they had been to disaster on that occasion. He also appears to have taken comfort from the strength of his force, perhaps believing that most of the English army was with King Henry on the Welsh marches. Loaded down with booty he began a leisurely retreat through the valley of the <a href="../../../r/i/v/River_Till_2e07.html" title="River Till">River Till</a> back towards the border at <a href="../../../c/o/l/Coldstream.html" title="Coldstream">Coldstream</a>, ready to reaquaint his countrymen with the power of the longbow.</p>
<p><a name="Homildon_Hill" id="Homildon_Hill"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Humbleton_Hill_092e.html" title="Edit section: Homildon Hill">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Homildon Hill</span></h2>
<p>When he reached Wooler on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_14.html" title="September 14">14 September</a> Douglas learned that the enemy were ranged across his line of retreat at Milfield, just over five miles to the north-west. Appreciating the extreme danger of his situation he ordered the army, booty and all, to deploy in a dense phalanx on the nearby height of Homildon-now Humbleton-Hill. This was a good position, rising in successive tiers to an elevation of nearly 1000 feet above sea level, with a flat top upon which there were some ancient fortifications; but it was also twined with another eminence, the nearby Harehope Hill, separated from Homildon by a ravine, although within arrow range. Douglas was well enough situated to repel a cavalry attack; but the very denseness of his army, and his failure to secure Harehope, made him extremely vulnerable to archery; and it was archers who made up the bulk of the approaching English army.</p>
<p>From Milfield the English army advanced down the Till valley, under the leadership of Northumberland, his eldest son <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_Percy_d84c.html" title="Henry Percy">Harry Hotspur</a>, previously taken captive at Otterburn, and the earl of March. On finding the enemy at Homildon they took up their own battle positions. The exact distribution of the English troops is not altogether clear, so a recreation of the Battle of Homildon Hill has to involve a degree of guesswork. It would certainly appear that a party of longbowmen was allowed to occupy Harehope, without interruption from Douglas. Here they were comfortably out of range of the Scottish shortbow, and protected by the deep ravine that runs between Harehope and Homildon. The rest of the army, including the remaining archers and men-at-arms, seemed to have been deployed on the lower ground, slightly to the north-west of the Scots in a field, subsequently known as Red Riggs, where a stone still stands said to commemorate the battle.</p>
<p><a name="Hail_of_Death" id="Hail_of_Death"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Humbleton_Hill_092e.html" title="Edit section: Hail of Death">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Hail of Death</span></h2>
<p>Hotspur, true to his name and nature, wanted to begin the battle by ordering an immediate charge on the Scots. He was restrained by March, whose knowledge of the fighting strengths of both armies was invaluable: as a Scot he was well aware that his people fought best at close quarters, whereas the English had the greatest advantage in dealing death from a distance with the mighty longbow. Each of the bowmen was armed with twenty-four arrows, and it was said of old that they carried twenty-four Scots under their belt. Never was this truer than at Homildon, perhaps the most complete victory for the longbow in English history.</p>
<p>From Harehope and the lower reaches of Homildon the arrows began to whistle into the packed Scottish ranks. The lightly protected Gallwegians suffered most, but even the latest plate armour failed to deflect the punch of the arrows, which cut through helmets with ease. The Scots were so badly deployed that they had scarcely any room to manoeuvre or use their weapons. The horror of the situation was made worse by the screams of the horses and the plundered livestock, maddened by the rush of arrows. <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walter_Bower_ca05.html" title="Walter Bower">Walter Bower</a>, the Scottish chronicler depicts the scene thus;</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>...the English bowmen, advancing towards the Scots, smothered them with arrows and made them bristle like hedgehogs, transfixing the arms and hands of the Scots to their own lances. By means of this very harsh rain of arrows, they wounded others and they killed many.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Even the bravest soldier could only take so much of this. It was not a question of fighting: the only test of courage was to stand and die without turning their backs on an enemy they could not reach. The advancing English archers were unsupported by other infantrymen and could conceivably have been dispersed by a cavalry charge, as their ancestors had been by Robert Keith at <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Bannockburn_0abc.html" title="Battle of Bannockburn">Bannockburn</a>. No such attack was ordered by Douglas, who seems to have frozen in indecision. Finally, two knights, Sir John Swinton and Sir Adam Gordon, could take no more, and ordered their own retainers, some 100 men in all, to follow them on a downhill charge. Unsupported by the main army, both men were killed, and their attack destroyed. The survivors of Swinton and Gordon's men were streaming back only to be met by their comrades coming down from the heights, which caused some confusion, made worse when the whole army came across a sudden precipice.</p>
<p>The English archers remained calm, simply giving way, more rapidly in the centre than on the flanks, firing all the time. Before reaching the enemy the Scottish army finally broke, fleeing in all directions, with riderless horses charging wildly across the Till Valley. The English men-at-arms, who had not been engaged at all until now, joined the pursuit, which continued all the way to the <a href="../../../r/i/v/River_Tweed_9833.html" title="River Tweed">River Tweed</a>, thirteen miles to the north, where a further 500 Scots were drowned in a desperate attempt to escape, their bodies borne rapidly downstream by the strong current.</p>

<p>An unknown number of men died on the slopes of Homildon Hill; perhaps thousands. There was also a rich hoard in prisoners, numbering among them <a href="../../../m/u/r/Murdoch_Stewart%2C_2nd_Duke_of_Albany_9ce2.html" title="Murdoch Stewart, 2nd Duke of Albany">Murdoch of Fife</a>, the earls of <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earl_of_Moray_e83c.html" title="Earl of Moray">Moray</a>, <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Douglas%2C_1st_Earl_of_Angus_02f1.html" title="George Douglas, 1st Earl of Angus">Angus</a> and <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_I_Sinclair%2C_Earl_of_Orkney_eb43.html" title="Henry I Sinclair, Earl of Orkney">Orkney</a>; Lords Montgomery, Erskine, Seton and Abernethy; Sir Robert Logan, Sir William Graham, Sir Adam Forester, Sir David Fleming and Pierre des Essarts with a number of French knights. The chief captive was Archibald Douglas himself who, despite his costly armour, had been wounded in five places, losing one of his eyes. Only five Englishmen are said to have been killed; and while one is normally suspicious of claims of this kind, in the circumstances of the battle this is, perhaps, not improbable.</p>
<p>Homildon was a serious blow to Scottish morale, showing what Otterburn might have been if Hotspur had kept his head. It was a reminder of the massed power of the longbow, which prevailed against the Scots at the past battles of <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Dupplin_Moor_7719.html" title="Battle of Dupplin Moor">Dupplin Moor</a>, <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Halidon_Hill_d8dc.html" title="Battle of Halidon Hill">Halidon Hill</a> and <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Neville%27s_Cross_b2b5.html" title="Battle of Neville's Cross">Neville's Cross</a>, but which seems to have been forgotten in the intervening years. It was also Archibald Douglas' first major battle and he never did more to justify the title he was subsequently given-the 'Tyneman' (the Loser). His ill-fated raid was the last major invasion of England until another Scots army campaigned in the valley of the Till in the late summer of 1513.</p>
