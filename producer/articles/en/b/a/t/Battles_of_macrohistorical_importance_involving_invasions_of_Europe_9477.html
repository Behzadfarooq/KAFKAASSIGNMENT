<p>The outcomes of <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battles.html" title="Battles">battles</a> have often been assessed by historians in respect to their influence on the development of polities, states or cultures. This article provides an overview of those battles whose outcome has been judged by at least two modern historians to be of lasting cultural or political importance for <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europe.html" title="Europe">European</a> nation-states—or European polities recognized by historians as independent nation-states—and invading outside forces. It does not include the battles where both opposing factions were European, but may contain battles where both opposing forces belonged to a similar culture, and it examines only those battles which two or more historians since 1960 believe to have massively affected the course of history. The historians consulted on the subject considered European culture and civilization as a development from the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greco-Roman_a471.html" title="Greco-Roman">Greco-Roman</a> world to the modern civilizations of that area, which did and does not include all of Europe within its defined geographic borders.</p>

Leonidas at Thermopylae, by Jacques-Louis David (1814)</div>

</div>
<p>The battle of Thermopylae took place on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_11.html" title="August 11">August 11</a>, <a href="../../../4/8/0/480_BC_198f.html" title="480 BC">480 BC</a>. In the context of the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greco-Persian_Wars_ae8f.html" title="Greco-Persian Wars">Greco-Persian Wars</a>, <a href="../../../x/e/r/Xerxes_I_of_Persia_e8ee.html" title="Xerxes I of Persia">Xerxes I of Persia</a> was preparing his assault on <a href="../../../a/t/h/Athens.html" title="Athens">Athens</a>, while the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greek_people.html" title="Greek people">Greeks</a> were forced to retreat. Having dismissed all but 1,200 of the 7,000 strong Greek army, king <a href="../../../l/e/o/Leonidas_I_a00f.html" title="Leonidas I">Leonidas I</a> of <a href="../../../s/p/a/Sparta.html" title="Sparta">Sparta</a> prepared a <a href="../../../l/a/s/Last_stand.html" title="Last stand">last stand</a> in order to give time to the rest of the Greek soldiers to retreat. Even though Leonidas and his <a href="../../../3/0/0/300_Spartans_c0a0.html" title="300 Spartans">300 Spartans</a> were eventually killed after three days of battle, they were able to inflict the (comparatively) enormous losses of 20,000 men to the Persians. This was even more impressive because of the fact that the Persian army commanded by Xerxes was almost two hundred times larger than Leonidas' army. Even though in the end the Persians annihilated the Greek combatants, the result was a <a href="../../../p/y/r/Pyrrhic_victory.html" title="Pyrrhic victory">pyrrhic victory</a> for the Persians, and it represented a turning point in the Greco-Persian wars, which would continue with the Greek victories at <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Plataea_7d1a.html" title="Battle of Plataea">Plataea</a> and <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Mycale_1320.html" title="Battle of Mycale">Mycale</a>.</p>
<p>The resistance of the Spartan-led army offered Athens the invaluable opportunity to make battle preparations and decisively defeat the Persians at the battles of Salamis. <a href="http://en.allexperts.com/e/b/ba/battle_of_thermopylae.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.allexperts.com/e/b/ba/battle_of_thermopylae.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> Militarily, it was this vital purchase of time that the Spartans bought so bravely with their very lives that literally saved the Greek fleet. Modern Historian Michael Grant says "so Leonidas, after dismissing most of his force, fought with his own men to the death, falling in defeat, but creating a saga of Spartan heroism; and he had delayed the Persians for at least a week, thus saving the Greek fleet at Artemisium."<sup id="_ref-Grant_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Grant" title="">[1]</a></sup> N.S.

<dl>
<dd>"The three-day battle for the pass at Thermopylae (the Hot Gates)--a critical contest in Xerxes's massive invasion of Greece. The bloody stand made there by Leonidas and his small Spartan army in 480 B.C. has been hailed ever since as an outstanding example of patriotism, courage, and sacrifice."</dd>

<p>Historian Steven Pressfield says in <i>Gates of Fire</i>: "This is a story of heroism. But it is also a story of discipline, of loyalty between fighting men and to a state. For a book as violent as this, it is also a story of profound caring, among the characters of a timeless story." Because a great part of European civilisation is based on the heritage of <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_Greece_e4c9.html" title="Ancient Greece">Ancient Greece</a>, a successful invasion of Greece by the Persians and their subsequent domination would have surely changed the history of Europe. Dr.Ellis L. Knox, Historian at Boise State University, says in <i>The Persian Wars</i></p>
<dl>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"Thermopylae was always hailed as a triumph for Greek arms because the Persian army was crucially delayed. Thermopylae allowed the Greeks time to organize. Themistocles did not lose heart and continued to drive the shipbuilders for all they were worth. He was still confident of victory at sea. Moreover, the Greeks were heartened by the example of Leonidas, the Spartans, and the others who fought at Thermopylae. This battle served as an example to officers and soldiers alike, not only through Greek history but Roman as well, of what can be accomplished through heroic self-sacrifice." <a href="http://history.boisestate.edu/westciv/persian/19.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://history.boisestate.edu/westciv/persian/19.shtml" rel="nofollow">[3]</a></dd>

<p>The battle of the Metaurus was fought in <a href="../../../2/0/7/207_BC_77d5.html" title="207 BC">207 BC</a> by the <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Republic_9497.html" title="Roman Republic">Roman Republic</a> and <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carthage.html" title="Carthage">Carthage</a>, who were then waging the <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_Punic_War_97a8.html" title="Second Punic War">Second Punic War</a>. It took place near the <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metaurus_river.html" title="Metaurus river">Metaurus river</a> in northern <a href="../../../i/t/a/Italy.html" title="Italy">Italy</a>, and it was fought between a <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carthaginian.html" title="Carthaginian">Carthaginian</a> army headed by <a href="../../../h/a/s/Hasdrubal_Barca_d3ce.html" title="Hasdrubal Barca">Hasdrubal Barca</a>, brother of <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hannibal_Barca_bf41.html" title="Hannibal Barca">Hannibal</a> and a slightly larger Roman army headed by <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_consul.html" title="Roman consul">consuls</a> <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marcus_Livius_Salinator_1553.html" title="Marcus Livius Salinator">Marcus Livius Salinator</a> and <a href="../../../g/a/i/Gaius_Claudius_Nero_853c.html" title="Gaius Claudius Nero">Gaius Claudius Nero</a>. When the latter found out that Hasdrubal was planning on joining Hannibal's armies in order to launch a final all-out attack on <a href="../../../r/o/m/Rome.html" title="Rome">Rome</a>, he hastily set out to join Salinator to intercept the <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carthaginian.html" title="Carthaginian">Carthaginian</a> armies. Hasdrubal, knowing that his forces were inferior in number and in fighting prowess, tried to avoid combat, but he was eventually caught at the banks of the Metaurus. There, the <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_legion.html" title="Roman legion">Roman legionaires</a> were able to achieve an important victory, and Hasdrubal found his death at the end of the battle.</p>
<p>This battle prevented a full-scale attack on Rome to which the city may well have fallen. Historian Paul K. Davis says:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"For 11 years Hannibal had his own way in Italy, defeating every force the Romans could send against him. Still, the constant warfare and inability to recruit quality troops locally meant he had to have reinforcements if he was going to capture Rome itself and dictate terms. Hasdrubal's defeat near the Metaurus River meant that would not happen...had Hasdrubal joined with his brother, the resulting force could well have captured Rome and changed the fortunes of the Mediterranean Basin."<sup id="_ref-Davis_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Davis" title="">[2]</a></sup></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>The success of Hannibal's military tactics, the defection of several allies of Rome and the political instability in Rome had brought it to the brink of defeat, but after the victory at the banks of the Metaurus, the current of the conflict shifted and the tide turned to the favour of the Roman Republic. Robert F. Pennell wrote in <i>Ancient Rome from the Earliest Times Down to 476AD</i> in 1890:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"The war in Italy was now virtually ended, for, although during four years more Hannibal stood at bay in a corner of Bruttium, he was powerless to prevent the restoration of Roman authority throughout Italy."<a href="http://www.nalanda.nitc.ac.in/resources/english/etext-project/history/ancrome/chapter16.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nalanda.nitc.ac.in/resources/english/etext-project/history/ancrome/chapter16.html" rel="nofollow">[4]</a></dd>

<p>The battle of Chalons, sometimes called the Catalaunic Fields took place on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_20.html" title="June 20">June 20</a>, <a href="../../../4/5/1/451.html" title="451">451</a>. The <a href="../../../h/u/n/Hunnic.html" title="Hunnic">Hunnic</a> king <a href="../../../a/t/t/Attila.html" title="Attila">Attila</a> had ravaged almost all Europe, and was vying for control of <a href="../../../g/a/u/Gaul.html" title="Gaul">Gaul</a>. After besieging the city of <a href="../../../o/r/l/Orl%C3%A9ans.html" title="Orléans">Orléans</a>, Attila was confronted by a Roman army headed by <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flavius_A%C3%ABtius_8dc3.html" title="Flavius Aëtius">Flavius Aëtius</a> (who had been exiled with the Huns during his youth) and his <i><a href="../../../f/o/e/Foederati.html" title="Foederati">foederatus</a></i>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theodoric_I_fa79.html" title="Theodoric I">Theodoric I</a>, king of the <a href="../../../v/i/s/Visigoths.html" title="Visigoths">Visigoths</a>. Both sides also had a number of other minor allies which fought at their side. The Hunnic forces tried to take a dominant position but were repelled by Roman troops, which subsequently launched a charge against the Huns. During this charge, in which Theodoric was killed and his son <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thorismund.html" title="Thorismund">Thorismund</a> almost trapped in the Hunnic camp, the Huns were nevertheless crippled. They were not annihilated, though; many historians, including Gibbon, believe that Aëtius convinced Thorismund that it was better not to destroy the Huns, on the grounds that total extermination of the Huns would inevitably lead to Rome finding a new enemy in the strengthened Visigoths. Indeed, J.F.C. Fuller, in <i>A Military History of the Western World</i>, claims that Attila survived only because Aetius allowed him to, in "a battle that saved Europe." (Fuller, vol. 1: p.297)</p>
<p>This battle, especially since <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_Gibbon_4de8.html" title="Edward Gibbon">Edward Gibbon</a> addressed it in <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Decline_and_Fall_of_the_Roman_Empire_af8d.html" title="The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire">The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire</a> and Sir <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_Shepherd_Creasy_a39c.html" title="Edward Shepherd Creasy">Edward Creasy</a> wrote his <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Fifteen_Decisive_Battles_of_the_World_e2c1.html" title="The Fifteen Decisive Battles of the World">The Fifteen Decisive Battles of the World</a></i>, has been considered by many historians as one of the most important battles of late antiquity.</p>
<p>Creasy quoted Herbert's work "Attila" concerning this battle, i., line 13.</p>

<dd>Attila's attacks on the Western empire were soon renewed, but never with such peril to the civilized world as had menaced it before his defeat at Châlons; and on his death, two years after that battle, the vast empire which his genius had founded was soon dissevered by the successful revolts of the subject nations. The name of the Huns ceased for some centuries to inspire terror in Western Europe, and their ascendency passed away with the life of the great king by whom it had been so fearfully augmented."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Historian Paul K, Davis, in <i>100 Decisive Battles</i>, argues for its importance: "Roman defeat of the Huns stopped the Asian spread westward, setting up the collapse of Attila's empire two years later".<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[3]</a></sup> He says that "by halting hun expansion, the battle at Chalons kept Attila from dominating western Europe. Aetius force was thrown together at the last minute, if had not been defeated, there was really no other organized population that could have withstood the huns."<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>John J. Nowrich, the historian known for his works on Vienna and on Byzantium, said of the battle of Chalons:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"it should never be forgotten that in the summer of 451 and again in 452, the whole fate of western civilization hung in the balance. Had the Hunnish army not been halted in these two successive campaigns, had its leader toppled Valentinian from his throne and set up his own capital at Ravenna or Rome, there is little doubt that both Gaul and Italy would have been reduced to spiritual and cultural deserts."<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[5]</a></sup></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>He goes on to say that though the battle in 451 was</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"indecisive insofar as both sides sustained immense losses and neither was left master of the field, it had the effect of halting the Huns advance."<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[6]</a></sup></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>However, J.B. Bury expresses a quite different judgement:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The battle of Maurica was a battle of nations, but its significance has been enormously exaggerated in conventional history. It cannot in any reasonable sense be designated as one of the critical battles of the world. The Gallic campaign had really been decided by the strategic success of the allies in cutting off Attila from Orleans. The battle was fought when he was in full retreat, and its value lay in damaging his prestige as an invincible conqueror, in weakening his forces, and in hindering him from extending the range of his ravages.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[7]</a></sup></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Contributing to the Battle's fearsome reputation through the ages are the terrible losses suffered by both sides, as well as the notoriety of Attila himself—the self-called "scourge of God"—and the fact that the battle ended his reputation as undefeatable. Considering the extravagant totals for casualties, Gibbon remarked that they "suppose a real and effective loss, sufficient to justify the historian's remark that whole generations may be swept away by the madness of kings in a single hour".<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>

<p>The battle of Toulouse was fought in the context of the <a href="../../../u/m/a/Umayyad_conquest_of_Hispania_003f.html" title="Umayyad conquest of Hispania">Umayyad conquest of Europe</a>. <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Samh_ibn_Malik_al-Khawlani_1c58.html" title="Al-Samh ibn Malik al-Khawlani">Al-Samh ibn Malik al-Khawlani</a>, <i><a href="../../../w/a/l/Wali.html" title="Wali">wali</a></i> of <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Andalus_24f6.html" title="Al-Andalus">Al-Andalus</a>, had assembled a formidable army in order to continue <a href="../../../u/m/a/Umayyad.html" title="Umayyad">Umayyad</a> expansion northwards. From his base in <a href="../../../n/a/r/Narbonne.html" title="Narbonne">Narbonne</a>, he deployed an army which laid <a href="../../../s/i/e/Siege.html" title="Siege">siege</a> to the city of <a href="../../../t/o/u/Toulouse.html" title="Toulouse">Toulouse</a>. With Narbonne and its port secure, al-Samh ibn Malik, Emir of al-Andalus, moved swiftly to subdue the surrounding area, taking Alet, south of Carcassonne, and Béziers, Agde, Lodève, Maguelonne (Montpellier) and Nîmes in fairly quick succession. By 721, he was ready for a new, decisive and far-reaching campaign, which he intended to result ultimately in the conquest of the "Great Land" as Roman Gaul was called by the Umayyads.</p>
<p>This was raid, as some modern historians claim, no karr wa-farr (attack and withdraw) slash across southwestern France. Al-Samh's aim was to strike west, take the key Garonne River valley, capture Toulouse—then the capital of Eudes, Duke of Aquitaine—and open up a vast territory stretching all the way to the Atlantic and back south through Andalusia to the Mediterranean and the Maghrib.</p>
<p>According to Muslim histories of the period, Al-Samh evidently felt confident that, with Toulouse in his grip, he could repeat what he had done in Narbonne: Create by treaty a string of lslamo-Christian principalities, sealed in the usual way by marriage between the leading princes and families on both sides. But first he returned to al-Andalus to muster fresh troops. Reinforced, he crossed back into Occitania in early spring, 721, and immediately marched west toward Toulouse.</p>
<p>Al-Samh's army included siege engines, infantry, a few horsemen and numerous mercenaries, as well as the redoubtable Basque slingers. Toulouse was a big, well-defended city, whose walls had been consistently strengthened since Roman and Visigothic times, and Eudes wasted no time in leaving to gather help. The siege of Toulouse, with its near-impregnable walls, lasted until early summer. The defenders, short of provisions, were close to surrendering when, around <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_9.html" title="June 9">June 9</a>, <a href="../../../7/2/1/721.html" title="721">721</a>, Eudes of Aquitaine returned at the head of a large force, hurled himself at al-Samh's rear and launched a highly successful encircling movement. A major, decisive battle ensued; on this, three major Muslim historians of the period agree: Ibn Hayyan (d. 1067), Ibn al-Athir (d. 1234) and al-Maqqari (d. 1632).</p>
<p>These Muslim histories suggest that al-Samh fell into the classic trap of static warfare and had concentrated his entire potential against the walls of Toulouse. With too few horsemen—the extensive use of Arab and Berber cavalry in Europe came later in 732—he was unable to react fast enough to Eudes's charge, which completely engulfed him. Caught between the city's defenders and Eudes's men, al-Samh tried to break out, but was trapped with the bulk of his troops in a place called Balat (Plateau), where he made a determined last stand.</p>
<p>There are historians, such as the Toulouse historian Sydney Forado,<a href="http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/199302/the.arabs.in.occitania.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/199302/the.arabs.in.occitania.htm" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> who believe the Battle of Toulouse halted the muslim conquest of Europe even more than the later—and more celebrated—<a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Tours_b847.html" title="Battle of Tours">Battle of Tours</a> (<a href="../../../o/c/t/October_10.html" title="October 10">October 10</a>, <a href="../../../7/3/2/732.html" title="732">732</a>, between <a href="../../../t/o/u/Tours.html" title="Tours">Tours</a> and <a href="../../../p/o/i/Poitiers.html" title="Poitiers">Poitiers</a>). Historians such as Sir Charles Oman argue however that even had the Arabs won at Toulouse, they still would have had to conquer the Franks to have retained control of the region.<sup id="_ref-Oman_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Oman" title="">[9]</a></sup> Other historians such as Paul K. Davis agree that the <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian.html" title="Christian">Christian</a> victory at Toulouse was important in a <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macrohistorical.html" title="Macrohistorical">macrohistorical</a> sense; it gave Charles Martel badly needed time to strengthen his grip on power and build the veteran army which stood him in such good stead eleven years later at Tours. Davis said in <i>100 Decisive Battles</i> "Having defeated Eudes, he turned to the Rhine to strengthen his northeastern borders - but in 725 was diverted south with the activity of the Muslims in Acquitane." Martel then concentrated his attention to the east, virtually for the remainder of his life.</p>
<p>His controversial seizure of church property to buy supporters, secure power, settle his northern frontier by any means necessary, including bribes in some cases, allowed him to fund his army and prepare for the coming danger. This earned great enmity from the Church at the time, but after Tours, Rome swiftly saw the necessity of the Frankish Army. Without his veteran Frankish Army, Martel could not have prevailed at Tours, where his veterans accomplished what was thought impossible—infantry withstanding armoured cavalry without firearms or even longbows. The eleven years between Toulouse and Tours without question gave him time to fully secure power, inspire the loyalty of his troops, and most importantly, drill the core of veterans who stood so stoutly in 732.</p>
<p>While Eudes faded into history after his horrific defeat at Bordeaux, the Battle of Toulouse carries macrohistorical importance as it bought time for Martel to prepare for the greater invasion mounted by Abd al Rahman in 732. Ironically, while Eudes is forgotten, Martel became hailed as the savior of <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europe.html" title="Europe">Europe</a>, and of the Church itself. While both are debatable, these events and Martel's later campaigns against the Muslims in 736-7 almost certainly assured the development of Europe and the <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catholic_Church_2beb.html" title="Catholic Church">Catholic Church</a> as we know them today.</p>

<p>In 732, the Emir of Al-Andulas returned with a veteran army, which swept north to face the hero of the Battle of Toulouse first. Eleven years after that glorious victory, duke Eudes once more stood against the invading Muslims in the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_the_River_Garonne_761f.html" title="Battle of the River Garonne">Battle of the River Garonne</a>—nevertheless, this time his forces were literally exterminated by the Arab troops, and the <i><a href="../../../m/o/z/Mozarabic_Chronicle_of_754_7cc9.html" title="Mozarabic Chronicle of 754">Mozarabic Chronicle of 754</a></i> commented "solus Deus numerum morientium vel pereuntium recognoscat" (<i>God alone knows the number of the slain</i>). Whereas eleven years earlier, Eudes had not had to face the dreaded Arab heavy cavalry, this time he did—and the result was catastrophic. Eudes himself managed to escape and fled to <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Martel_3f32.html" title="Charles Martel">Charles Martel</a>, Mayor of the Palace, and <i>de facto</i> ruler of the Frankish realm, agreed to help him in return for an <a href="../../../o/a/t/Oath.html" title="Oath">oath</a> of <a href="../../../f/e/a/Fealty.html" title="Fealty">fealty</a>. When the Frankish ruler got wind that the Umayyads were planning to storm the city of <a href="../../../t/o/u/Tours.html" title="Tours">Tours</a> and loot the Abbey of Saint Martin of Tours, then the holiest and richest shrine of Europe, he put together an army of about 20,000 veteran infantry and 1,000 cavalry and marched to meet <a href="../../../a/b/d/Abdul_Rahman_Al_Ghafiqi_4b67.html" title="Abdul Rahman Al Ghafiqi">Abdul Rahman Al Ghafiqi</a>, whose forces numbered about 80,000 men, mostly cavalry. Duke Eudes, and what remained of his forces, joined Martel and fought on his left flank.</p>
<p>The two armies engaged at the point where the rivers <a href="../../../v/i/e/Vienne_river.html" title="Vienne river">Vienne</a> and <a href="../../../c/l/a/Clain.html" title="Clain">Clain</a> join, between <a href="../../../t/o/u/Tours.html" title="Tours">Tours</a> and <a href="../../../p/o/i/Poitiers.html" title="Poitiers">Poitiers</a>, in <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_10.html" title="October 10">October 10</a>, <a href="../../../7/3/2/732.html" title="732">732</a>. The Frankish army took up a <a href="../../../p/h/a/Phalanx_formation.html" title="Phalanx formation">phalanx formation</a> and was able to withstand the numerous Islamic cavalry charges. Although the Muslim cavalry was able to pierce the Franks' defensive formation, the Franks never broke, and at the height of the fighting, scouts sent by Martel to raid the Muslim camp in hopes of drawing off part of their forces succeeded beyond their wildest dreams. Part of the Umayyad forces headed back to camp to secure their loot, and soon the remaining Umayyad troops began a full-scale retreat. Panic spread amongst the Umayyad lines and the situation soon turned into a <i>real</i> chaotic retreat of the Islamic troops. The Frankish cavalry was able to take advantage of this disorganisation and struck down a great number of invaders, amongst them the commander Abdul Rahman Al Ghafiqi.</p>
<p>Many historians agree that this is the most important battle in the <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Europe_0f59.html" title="History of Europe">history of Europe</a> as we know it.

<li>Robert W. Martin: "[The battle of Tours was] one of the most decisive battles in all of history".</li>
<li>Bernard Grun in his "Timetables of History," reissued in 2004: "In 732 Charles Martel's victory over the Arabs at the Battle of Tours stems the tide of their westward advance.”<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[11]</a></sup></li>
<li><a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_Gibbon_4de8.html" title="Edward Gibbon">Edward Gibbon</a>: "The establishment of Frankish power in western Europe shaped that continent's destiny and the Battle of Tours confirmed that power".</li>

</ul>
<p>In those historians' view, had the Frankish kingdom fallen, it is doubtful that the rest of Europe—divided into little, squabbling states—could have resisted the Muslim expansion.</p>
<p>H.G. Wells in his "<i>A Short History of the World</i>" lavishes praise on Martel in Chapter XLV, "The Development of Latin Christendom":</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"The Moslim when they crossed the Pyrenees in 720 found this Frankish kingdom under the practical rule of Charles Martel, the Mayor of the Palace of a degenerate descendant of Clovis, and experienced the decisive defeat of Poitiers (732) at his hands. This Charles Martel was practically overlord of Europe north of the Alps from the Pyrenees to Hungary. He ruled over a multitude of subordinate lords speaking French-Latin, and High and Low German languages."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Other historians, such as <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Watson_f444.html" title="William Watson">William Watson</a> and <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antonio_Santosuosso_743c.html" title="Antonio Santosuosso">Antonio Santosuosso</a> agree that the Battle was of macrohistorical importance as it brought the powerful Frankish army into the conflict, but are more nuanced in their interpretation of the battle's place in history; Watson writes:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"There is clearly some justification for ranking Tours-Poitiers among the most significant events in Frankish history when one considers the result of the battle in light of the remarkable record of the successful establishment by Muslims of Islamic political and cultural dominance along the entire eastern and southern rim of the former Christian, Roman world. The rapid Muslim conquest of Palestine, Syria, Egypt and the North African coast all the way to Morocco in the seventh century resulted in the permanent imposition by force of Islamic culture onto a previously Christian and largely non-Arab base. The Visigothic kingdom fell to Muslim conquerors in a single battle on the Rio Barbate in 711, and the Hispanic Christian population took seven long centuries to regain control of the Iberian peninsula. The Reconquista, of course, was completed in 1492, only months before Columbus received official backing for his fateful voyage across the Atlantic Ocean. Had Charles Martel suffered at Tours-Poitiers the fate of King Roderick at the Rio Barbate, it is doubtful that a "do-nothing" sovereign of the Merovingian realm could have later succeeded where his talented major domus had failed. Indeed, as Charles was the progenitor of the Carolingian line of Frankish rulers and grandfather of Charlemagne, one can even say with a degree of certainty that the subsequent history of the West would have proceeded along vastly different currents had ‘Abd ar-Rahman been victorious at Tours-Poitiers in 732."<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[12]</a></sup></dd>

<p>Indeed, lands such as <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Britain_b139.html" title="Great Britain">Great Britain</a> or the <a href="../../../t/e/u/Teutonic.html" title="Teutonic">Teutonic territories</a> were far weaker than the Franks, both in military and in political terms, and it is difficult to imagine what population in Europe could have resisted the Islamic conquest. Military Historian Victor Davis Hanson says:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"What is clear is that Poitiers marked a general continuance of the successful western defense of Europe. Flush from his victory at Poitiers, Charles went on to clear southern France from Islamic invaders for decades, unify the warring kingdoms into the foundation of the Carolingian Empire, and ensure ready and avaiable troops from local estates."<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[13]</a></sup></dd>

<p>Sir Edward Creasy wrote "Martel's victory rescued Christendom from Islam, preserved the relics of ancient and the germs of modern civilization." Dexter Wakefield says "European schoolchildren learn about the Battle of Tours in much the same way that American students learn about Valley Forge and Gettysburg." It decided, as Creasy said, "the fate of nations."</p>
<p>However, there is a school of thought which disagrees with the view that this battle decided "the fate of nations." Tomaz Mastnak, in <i>Crusading Peace: Christendom, the Muslim World, and Western Political Order</i> presents a completely different view:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"Modern historians have constructed a myth presenting this victory as having saved Christian Europe from the Muslims. Edward Gibbon, for example, called Charles Martel the savior of Christendom and the battle near Poitiers an encounter that changed the history of the world... This myth has survived well into our own times... Contemporaries of the battle, however, did not overstate its significance. The continuators of Fredegar's chronicle, who probably wrote in the mid-eighth century, pictured the battle as just one of many military encounters between Christians and Saracens—moreover, as only one in a series of wars fought by Frankish princes for booty and territory... One of Fredegar's continuators presented the battle of Poitiers as what it really was: an episode in the struggle between Christian princes as the Carolingians strove to bring Aquitaine under their rule.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[14]</a></sup></dd>

The 5-hour battle was fought at the northern edge of the <a href="../../../g/u/l/Gulf_of_Patras_5d21.html" title="Gulf of Patras">Gulf of Patras</a>, off western <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greece.html" title="Greece">Greece</a>, where the Ottoman forces sailing westwards from their naval station in <a href="../../../n/a/u/Naupactus.html" title="Naupactus">Lepanto</a> met the Holy League forces, which had come from <a href="../../../m/e/s/Messina%2C_Italy_852c.html" title="Messina, Italy">Messina</a>, in the morning of Sunday <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_7.html" title="October 7">7 October</a>.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[15]</a></sup> It was the final major <a href="../../../n/a/v/Naval_battle.html" title="Naval battle">naval battle</a> in world history solely between rowing vessels, and it marked the beginning of the end of Ottoman supremacy in the Mediterranean.<a href="http://www.nafpaktos.com/battle_of_lepanto.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nafpaktos.com/battle_of_lepanto.htm" rel="nofollow">[7]</a></p>
<p>The Holy League's fleet consisted of 206 galleys and six <a href="../../../g/a/l/Galley.html#The_Galleas_warship" title="Galley">galleasses</a> (large converted merchant galleys carrying substantial <a href="../../../a/r/t/Artillery.html" title="Artillery">artillery</a>), and was ably commanded by <a href="../../../d/o/n/Don_John_of_Austria_08a6.html" title="Don John of Austria">Don John</a> (or Don Juan) of Austria, the <a href="../../../i/l/l/Illegitimacy.html" title="Illegitimacy">illegitimate</a> son of Emperor <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_V%2C_Holy_Roman_Emperor_df63.html" title="Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor">Charles V</a> and halfbrother of King <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philip_II_of_Spain_23db.html" title="Philip II of Spain">Philip II of Spain</a>.

All members of the alliance viewed the Turkish navy as a significant threat to their maritime trade in the <a href="../../../m/e/d/Mediterranean_Sea_0b44.html" title="Mediterranean Sea">Mediterranean Sea</a> and were determined to put an end to it. The various Christian contingents met the main force, that of Venice (under <a href="../../../s/e/b/Sebastiano_Venier_b6af.html" title="Sebastiano Venier">Veniero</a>), in July and August 1571 at <a href="../../../m/e/s/Messina.html" title="Messina">Messina</a>, <a href="../../../s/i/c/Sicily.html" title="Sicily">Sicily</a>. Don John arrived on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_23.html" title="August 23">23 August</a>.</p>
<p>This fleet of the Christian alliance was manned by 12,920 sailors and 43,000 rowers. In addition, it carried almost 28,000 fighting troops: 10,000 Spanish regular infantry of superior quality, 7,000 German and 6,000 Italian <a href="../../../m/e/r/Mercenary.html" title="Mercenary">mercenary</a> contingents from the various Habsburg dominions, and 5,000 others. There were also a large number of volunteers from all of Christian Europe.</p>
<p><a href="../../../a/l/i/Ali_Pacha_4090.html" title="Ali Pacha">Ali Pasha</a> (Turkish: "Kaptan-ı Derya Ali Paşa"), supported by the corsairs Chulouk Bey of <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexandria.html" title="Alexandria">Alexandria</a> and <a href="../../../u/l/u/Uluj_Ali_b557.html" title="Uluj Ali">Uluj Ali</a> (Uluch Ali), commanded an Ottoman force of 216 galleys, 56 <a href="../../../g/a/l/Galley.html#Renaissance" title="Galley">galliots</a>, and some smaller vessels. The Turks had skilled and experienced crews of sailors, but were somewhat deficient in soldiers, having only 25,000 of them, including only 2,500 <a href="../../../j/a/n/Janissary.html" title="Janissary">Janissaries</a>, who at that time were the only warriors equal to the Spanish infantry in the world. Some naval historians argue that this shortage of first-rate infantry was one of the decisive factors in the Ottoman defeat at Lepanto, especially in that it led to the capture and execution of Ali Pasha.<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[16]</a></sup> Others consider that the main difference between the two sides was primarily the presence of the larger, longer-ranged broadside <a href="../../../c/a/n/Cannon.html" title="Cannon">cannon</a> on the Venetian galleases. The thick <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armour.html" title="Armour">armour</a> of the Spanish infantry and the large number of Muslim <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archery.html" title="Archery">archers</a> are also considered to have been important. Certainly the few galleases had an influence out of proportion to their number and only a few prominent Christians were lost to arrows.</p>
<p>One of the better-known participants in the battle was Spanish author <a href="../../../m/i/g/Miguel_de_Cervantes_9688.html" title="Miguel de Cervantes">Miguel de Cervantes</a>, who was wounded in the battle and effectively lost the use of his left hand. Several years later he was captured by the Turkish <a href="../../../c/o/r/Corsairs.html" title="Corsairs">corsairs</a> and spent five years in captivity as a <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slave.html" title="Slave">slave</a> in <a href="../../../a/l/g/Algiers.html" title="Algiers">Algiers</a> before being ransomed by the <a href="../../../t/r/i/Trinitarian_Order_6aee.html" title="Trinitarian Order">Trinitarian Order</a>. This episode of his life is believed to be referenced in his masterpiece, <a href="../../../d/o/n/Don_Quixote_1079.html" title="Don Quixote">Don Quixote</a> (First Part, Chapters XXXIX-XLI).</p>
<p>The Turkish fleet suffered the loss of approximately 210 ships—of which 130 vessels, 117 galleys, 10 galliots and three fustas were captured, and in good enough condition for the Christians to keep. On the Christian side 20 galleys were destroyed and 30 were damaged so seriously that they had to be scuttled. One Venetian galley was the only one kept by the Turks. All others were abandoned by them and recaptured.</p>
<p>Uluj Ali, who had captured the flagship of the Maltese Knights, succeeded in extricating most of his ships from the battle when defeat was certain. Although he had cut the tow on the Maltese flagship in order to get away, he sailed to Istanbul, gathering up other Ottoman ships along the way and finally arriving there with 87 vessels. He presented the huge Maltese flag to Sultan Selim who thereupon bestowed upon him the honorary title of "kιlιç" (Sword); Uluj thus became known as <a href="../../../k/i/l/Kilic_Ali_Pasha_e450.html" title="Kilic Ali Pasha">Kιlιç Ali Pasha</a>.</p>
<p>The Holy League had suffered around 13,000 soldiers, sailors and rowers dead, but freed about as many Christian prisoners. Turkish casualties were around 25,000, and at least 3,500 were captured. The Holy League credited the victory to the Virgin Mary, whose intercession with God they had implored for victory through the use of the <a href="../../../r/o/s/Rosary.html" title="Rosary">Rosary</a>. Pius V instituted a new Catholic feast day of Our Lady of Victory to commemorate the battle, which is now celebrated by the Catholic Church as the feast of Our Lady of the Rosary. <a href="http://www.udayton.edu/mary/questions/yq/yq103.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.udayton.edu/mary/questions/yq/yq103.html" rel="nofollow">[8]</a> Andrea Doria had kept a copy of the miraculous image of our <a href="../../../o/u/r/Our_Lady_of_Guadeloupe_dc50.html" title="Our Lady of Guadeloupe">Our Lady of Guadeloupe</a> given to him by King <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philip_II_of_Spain_23db.html" title="Philip II of Spain">Philip II of Spain</a> in his ship's state room.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[17]</a></sup></p>
<p>This battle was a crushing defeat for the Ottomans, who had not lost a major naval battle since the fifteenth century. To most of Christendom, this event encouraged hope for the downfall of "the Turk", whom they regarded as the "Sempiternal Enemy of the Christian". Indeed, the Empire lost all but 30 of its ships and as many as 30,000 men, and some Western historians have held it to be the most decisive naval battle anywhere on the globe since the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Actium_50da.html" title="Battle of Actium">Battle of Actium</a> of <a href="../../../3/1/_/31_BC_fa60.html" title="31 BC">31 BC</a>. Historian Victor Davis Hanson said:</p>

<p>Despite the massive defeat, however, the Holy League's inability to stay united prevented the victors from capitalizing on their triumph. Plans to seize the Dardanelles as a step towards recovering <a href="../../../i/s/t/Istanbul.html" title="Istanbul">Istanbul</a>, formerly <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constantinople.html" title="Constantinople">Constantinople</a>, for Christendom, were ruined by bickering amongst the allies. <a href="http://www.molossia.org/milacademy/lepanto.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.molossia.org/milacademy/lepanto.html" rel="nofollow">[9]</a> With a massive effort, the Ottoman Empire rebuilt its navy, adding eight of the largest capital ships ever seen in the Mediterranean. Within six months this new fleet was able to reassert Ottoman naval supremacy in the eastern Mediterranean. On <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_7.html" title="March 7">7 March</a> <a href="../../../1/5/7/1573.html" title="1573">1573</a> the Venetians thus recognized by treaty the Ottoman possession of <a href="../../../c/y/p/Cyprus.html" title="Cyprus">Cyprus</a>, which had fallen to the Turks under <a href="../../../p/i/y/Piyale_Pasha_3fa1.html" title="Piyale Pasha">Piyale Pasha</a> on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_3.html" title="August 3">3 August</a> <a href="../../../1/5/7/1571.html" title="1571">1571</a>, just two months before Lepanto, and remained Turkish for the next three centuries, and that summer the Ottoman navy ravaged the geographically vulnerable coasts of Sicily and southern Italy. A Turkish Grand Vizier famously said "<i>In wresting Cyprus from you we deprived you of an arm; in defeating our fleet you have only shaved our beard. An arm when cut off cannot grow again; but a shorn beard will grow all the better for the razor.</i>"</p>
<p>In 1574 the Ottomans retook the strategic city of <a href="../../../t/u/n/Tunis.html" title="Tunis">Tunis</a> from the Spanish supported <a href="../../../h/a/f/Hafsid.html" title="Hafsid">Hafsid</a> dynasty, that had been re-installed when Don Juan's forces reconquered the city from the Ottomans the year before. With their long-standing alliance with the French coming into play they were able to resume naval activity in the western Mediterranean. In 1579 the capture of <a href="../../../f/e/s/Fes%2C_Morocco_21ec.html" title="Fes, Morocco">Fez</a> completed Ottoman conquests in <a href="../../../m/o/r/Morocco.html" title="Morocco">Morocco</a> that had begun under <a href="../../../s/u/l/Suleiman_the_Magnificent_4f7d.html" title="Suleiman the Magnificent">Süleyman the Magnificent</a>. The establishment of Ottoman <a href="../../../s/u/z/Suzerainty.html" title="Suzerainty">suzerainty</a> over the area placed the entire coast of the Mediterranean from the Straits of <a href="../../../g/i/b/Gibraltar.html" title="Gibraltar">Gibraltar</a> to <a href="../../../c/r/o/Croatia.html" title="Croatia">Croatia</a> and <a href="../../../s/l/o/Slovenia.html" title="Slovenia">Slovenia</a> (with the exceptions of the Spanish controlled trading city of <a href="../../../o/r/a/Oran.html" title="Oran">Oran</a> and strategic settlements such as <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melilla.html" title="Melilla">Melilla</a> and <a href="../../../c/e/u/Ceuta.html" title="Ceuta">Ceuta</a>)—under Ottoman authority. However the loss of so many of its experienced sailors at Lepanto sapped the fighting effectiveness of the Ottoman navy, a fact underlined by their minimizing confrontations with Christian navies in the years immediately after. Historian Paul K. Davis said:</p>

<dd>"This Turkish defeat stopped Turkey's expansion into the Mediterranean, thus maintaining western dominance, and confidence grew in the west that Turks, previously unstoppable, could be beaten."<sup id="_ref-Davis_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Davis" title="">[2]</a></sup></dd>

<p>Thus, this victory for the Holy League was primarily important not because the Turks lost 80 ships sunk and 130 captured by the allies, and 30,000 men killed (not including 12,000 Christian galley slaves, who were freed; allied losses were 7,500 men and 17 galleys), but because this was a victory which heralded the end of Turkish supremacy in the Mediterranean.<a href="http://www.trivia-library.com/b/famous-battles-in-history-the-turks-and-christians-at-lepanto.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.trivia-library.com/b/famous-battles-in-history-the-turks-and-christians-at-lepanto.htm" rel="nofollow">[10]</a></p>

<p>The battle of Vienna is chronologically the last of these battles. During the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Turkish_War_72cd.html" title="Great Turkish War">Great Turkish War</a>, the <a href="../../../o/t/t/Ottoman_Empire_4168.html" title="Ottoman Empire">Ottoman Empire</a> had managed to capture most if not all of eastern Europe and Turkish forces fought their way to the gates of <a href="../../../v/i/e/Vienna.html" title="Vienna">Vienna</a>. Because of its strategic position in both fluvial (through the <a href="../../../d/a/n/Danube.html" title="Danube">Danube</a>) and land trade, the Ottoman commanders wanted to assume control of the city as soon as possible. Instead of opting for an all-out attack—with good prospects for success, since the Ottoman soldiers greatly outnumbered <a href="../../../a/u/s/Austria.html" title="Austria">Austrian</a> defenders—<a href="../../../g/r/a/Grand_vizier.html" title="Grand vizier">grand vizier</a> <a href="../../../k/a/r/Kara_Mustafa_Pasha_cc2e.html" title="Kara Mustafa Pasha">Kara Mustafa Pasha</a> decided to lay siege on the city, in order to capture it with the minimal possible amount of damage. What the Ottomans did not take into account however was that time was not on their side. Their lack of urgency at this point, combined with the delay in advancing their army after declaring war, eventually allowed a relief force to arrive. Historians have speculated that Kara Mustafa wanted to take the city intact for its riches, which by Ottoman tradition went to him in the event of a surrender, and declined an all-out attack in order to prevent the right of plunder which would accompany such an assault.<sup id="_ref-brandon_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-brandon" title="">[19]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Ottoman siege cut virtually every means of food supply into Vienna,<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[20]</a></sup> and the garrison and civilian volunteers suffered extreme casualties. Fatigue became such a problem that Graf Ernst Rüdiger von Starhemberg ordered any soldier found asleep on watch to be shot. Increasingly desperate, the forces holding Vienna were on their last legs when in August, Imperial forces under <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_V%2C_Duke_of_Lorraine_ac55.html" title="Charles V, Duke of Lorraine">Charles V, Duke of Lorraine</a> beat <a href="../../../i/m/r/Imre_Th%C3%B6k%C3%B6ly_f16c.html" title="Imre Thököly">Imre Thököly</a> of <a href="../../../h/u/n/Hungary.html" title="Hungary">Hungary</a> at Bisamberg, 5km northeast of Vienna.</p>
<p>On 6 September, the Poles crossed the Danube 30km north west of Vienna at <a href="../../../t/u/l/Tulln.html" title="Tulln">Tulln</a>, to unite with the Imperial forces and additional troops from <a href="../../../s/a/x/Saxony.html" title="Saxony">Saxony</a>, <a href="../../../b/a/v/Bavaria.html" title="Bavaria">Bavaria</a>, <a href="../../../b/a/d/Baden.html" title="Baden">Baden</a>, <a href="../../../f/r/a/Franconia.html" title="Franconia">Franconia</a> and <a href="../../../s/w/a/Swabia.html" title="Swabia">Swabia</a> who had answered the call for a <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holy_League_%28Great_Turkish_war%29_e164.html" title="Holy League (Great Turkish war)">Holy League</a> that was supported by <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope_Innocent_XI_59c7.html" title="Pope Innocent XI">Pope Innocent XI</a>.

A combined charge of four <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holy_League_45bc.html" title="Holy League">Holy League</a> cavalry groups and 3,000 heavily armed winged Polish lancer hussars broke the Turkish lines. Less than three hours after this charge, the Ottoman troops were forced to retreat and the Christian forces saved Vienna from capture. The Catholic Encyclopedia says of this battle: <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14061c.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14061c.htm" rel="nofollow">[11]</a></p>

<dd>"On 11 Sept., Sobieski was on the heights of Kahlenberg, near the city, and the next day he gave battle in the plain below, with an army of not more than 76,000 men, the German forming the left wing and the Pole under Hetmans Jahonowski and Sieniawski, with General Katski in command of the artillery, forming the right. The hussars charged with their usual impetuosity, but the dense masses of the foe were impenetrable. Their retreat was taken for flight by the Turks, who rushed forward in pursuit; the hussars turned upon them with reinforcements and charged again, when their shouts made known that the "Northern Lion" was on the field and the Turks fled, panic-stricken, with Sobieski's horsemen still in pursuit."</dd>

<p>Although no one realized it at the time, the battle shaped the outcome of the entire war as well. The Ottomans fought on for another 16 years, losing control of Hungary and Transylvania in the process, before finally giving up. The end of the conflict was finalized by the <a href="../../../t/r/e/Treaty_of_Karlowitz_881f.html" title="Treaty of Karlowitz">Treaty of Karlowitz</a>.</p>
<p>The battle of Vienna is seen by many historians as marking the beginning of the decline of the Ottoman Empire. The battle also marked the historic end of Turkish expansion into southeastern Europe, therefore preventing Ottoman domination of the continent.
