<p>Since my intention is to discuss content (rather than indulge in incivility as you do), I will point out that your ambition to represent the battle as a clash between "Ukraine" (anachronistic term) and "Muscovy" (also incorrect) is flawed. Trubetskoy's army contained a lawfully elected Ukrainian hetman (Vyhovsky had been deposed) and substantial Ukrainian contingents. So, it was a mixed East Slavic Orthodox force. Vyhovsky's army was a motley crew composed of peoples of different religions and ethnicities: Tatars, Poles, and Cossacks. Any attempt to represent this battle in isolation from the events of the Russo-Polish War is doomed. Since Vyhovsky betrayed the Treaty of Pereyaslav and returned to the policy of a Polish alliance, he naturally became the enemy of the Tsar, whose army occupied Vilnius at the period. A failure to mention these basic facts is the best evidence of bias. --<a href="../../../g/h/i/User%7EGhirlandajo_b904.html" title="User:Ghirlandajo"><font color="#FC4339">Ghirla</font></a> <sup><a href="../../../g/h/i/User_talk%7EGhirlandajo_34f7.html" title="User talk:Ghirlandajo"><font color="#C98726">-трёп-</font></a></sup> 17:40, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>By the way, in your article about <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Ruin_5697.html" title="The Ruin">the Ruin</a> you say that Vyhovsky was supported only by the higher echelons of the Cossackdom (<i>starshina</i>). Why do you assume that the army of <i>starshina</i> was the army of "Ukraine", while the army of ordinary Ukrainian Cossacks was that of "Muscovy"? It seems to me that there was an internal struggle within the Hetmanate rather than a "Russian-Ukrainian War" as you try to paint it. Wikipedia is not a propaganda machine, and such tricks are easily exposed for what they are. --<a href="../../../g/h/i/User%7EGhirlandajo_b904.html" title="User:Ghirlandajo"><font color="#FC4339">Ghirla</font></a> <sup><a href="../../../g/h/i/User_talk%7EGhirlandajo_34f7.html" title="User talk:Ghirlandajo"><font color="#C98726">-трёп-</font></a></sup> 17:45, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>In my view, your recent <b>significant</b> changes are just as bias and POV-ish, if not more. You have cut whole chunks of the article without consultation or discussion to suit your flawed view of Ukrainian history. I have asked you repeatedly to consult before making siginificant changes and yet you seem to be looking for confrontation. As such, I will no longer be discussing this article, or any other issue with you and will seek outside mediation. --<a href="../../../h/i/l/User%7EHillock65_13a1.html" title="User:Hillock65">Hillock65</a> 17:53, 19 December 2006 (UTC)

<p>Dear Hillock65; I have to agree with Ghirla that there is much that can be discussed on this talk page. The article history shows no <a href="../../../r/e/v/Revert_war.html" title="Revert war">revert war</a>, and Ghirla has made some arguments above - with which I don't all agree - but which await a meaningful responce from you. The article is now tagged, you can still edit it, but I'd strongly suggest you two discuss the changes here - how was the POV changed, what references back it, and what and why info was removed. PS. Also, please read the definition of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. While again I will stress I often disagree with Ghirla's edits, in this case it looks to me like a good faith edit dispute about possible POV items, and not any kind of bad faith vandalism.--<sub><span style="border:1px solid #228B22;padding:1px;"><a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPiotrus_27db.html" title="User:Piotrus">&#160;Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus&#160;</a>|<a href="../../../p/i/o/User_talk%7EPiotrus_217f.html" title="User talk:Piotrus"><font style="color:#7CFC00;background:#006400;">&#160;talk&#160;</font></a></span></sub> 21:01, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Dear Piotr; thank you for your comment. By all means I will make an effort to discuss it even with Ghirla. I only ask for administrators to watch this page as in my view, he is using my inexperience in English Wikipedia to threaten me with all kinds of sanctions. You can see those on my discussion page. That's why I was seeking mediation to protect me from this kind of agressive behaviour. My only concearn is history and objectivity. Clearly, we have different views, I only hope that things could be discussed and agreed to mutually acceptable variant before being changed.

<p>The title of the conflict cannot be Russo-Polish war, that is incorrect. There are several reasons for that. Namely:</p>
<ul>
<li>1. The name of the country that is now Russia was still Muscovy, no matter how much some seem to be ashamed of the name. (I can't think why?) Please see article: <a href="../../../m/u/s/Muscovy.html" title="Muscovy">Muscovy</a>. There it clearly states that <i>Muscovy (Moscow principality (княжество Московское) to Grand Duchy of Moscow (Великое Княжество Московское) to Russian Tsardom (Царство Русское)) is a traditional Western name for the Russian state that existed from the 14th century to the <b>late 17th century</b>.</i> Events described in the article are clearly the late 17th century - 1659.
<ul>
<li>It is me who is in charge of the article about Muscovy. If I consider it prudent, I will move it to <a href="../../../m/u/s/Muscovite_Russia_9c8e.html" title="Muscovite Russia">Muscovite Russia</a>. The term "Muscovy" is (ab)used throughout Wikipedia primarily in Poland-Ukraine related articles, since it has derogatory connotations in the languages of those two countries. Its use in post-1552 context is certainly misleading. Since you don't deny that alternative names include "Russian Tsardom" and "the Russian state", I see your efforts at purging these from the text as tendentiously motivated. --<a href="../../../g/h/i/User%7EGhirlandajo_b904.html" title="User:Ghirlandajo"><font color="#FC4339">Ghirla</font></a> <sup><a href="../../../g/h/i/User_talk%7EGhirlandajo_34f7.html" title="User talk:Ghirlandajo"><font color="#C98726">-трёп-</font></a></sup> 08:23, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You seem to be labouring under some misconception that you own something here, or "in charge" of something. The term Muscovy is the generally accepted term for the country of that peoriod in the English language. As this is an English Encyclopedia, naming rules shoul remain the same as they always have been. As well, considerable changes or movig of content of articles without prior discussion is considered vandalism. That includes the article about Muscovy.--<a href="../../../h/i/l/User%7EHillock65_13a1.html" title="User:Hillock65">Hillock65</a> 12:18, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>2. Secondly, the events of the battle cannot be part of a bigger war, because the main source of the event - records of Russian historian <s><a href="../../../s/o/k/Sokolov.html" title="Sokolov">Sokolov</a></s> <a href="../../../s/e/r/Sergey_Solovyov_8897.html" title="Sergey Solovyov">Sergey Solovyov</a> (see sources) state that Poland's participation was limited to about 4000 men. To ascribe to which country different territories of Ukraine belonged is extremely difficult.
<ul>
<li>Sorry, I don't know what Sokolov you talk about. Of course, there was no such state as "Ukraine" at the period. No primary source mentions it under this name. I'm afraid all this is <a href="../../../o/r/i/Original_research.html" title="Original research">original research</a>. --<a href="../../../g/h/i/User%7EGhirlandajo_b904.html" title="User:Ghirlandajo"><font color="#FC4339">Ghirla</font></a> <sup><a href="../../../g/h/i/User_talk%7EGhirlandajo_34f7.html" title="User talk:Ghirlandajo"><font color="#C98726">-трёп-</font></a></sup> 08:23, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I misspelled it first time. Please educate yourself on famous Russian historian <a href="../../../s/e/r/Sergey_Solovyov_8897.html" title="Sergey Solovyov">Sergey Solovyov</a>, and his research in this area <a href="http://www.magister.msk.ru/library/history/solov/solv11p1.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.magister.msk.ru/library/history/solov/solv11p1.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. Not a <b>single time</b> does he mention the word 'Россия' (Russia) in the whole book, it is either Muscovy or Moscow - and he was Russian himself! --<a href="../../../h/i/l/User%7EHillock65_13a1.html" title="User:Hillock65">Hillock65</a> 12:18, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>3. The army of Trubetskoy was sent to deal with Ukrainians, not with Poles and events took place in Ukraine. That same <a href="../../../s/e/r/Sergey_Solovyov_8897.html" title="Sergey Solovyov">Sergey Solovyov</a> mentions Ukraine in description of events, and about a conflict between Muscovy and Vyhovsky.
<ul>
<li>It was not sent "to deal with Ukrainians", because Vyhovsky's forces were as Ukrainian as they were Polish or Tatar. Trubetskoy's force operated against the Poles together with large contingents of Ukrainian Cossacks.

<dd>It is part of the "civil war" from the Ukrainian perspective, but it is part of the Russo-Polish conflict from the Russian perspective. One hetman involved Russia into a costly and bloody war with Poland which dragged for thirteen years. When Russian armies reached Wilno, his successor reneged on Khmelnytsky's promises and allied himself with Poland. I don't know why you are so ashamed to call his actions a "betrayal", since a betrayal it was. Please don't wipe out the vital background of the battle. --<a href="../../../g/h/i/User%7EGhirlandajo_b904.html" title="User:Ghirlandajo"><font color="#FC4339">Ghirla</font></a> <sup><a href="../../../g/h/i/User_talk%7EGhirlandajo_34f7.html" title="User talk:Ghirlandajo"><font color="#C98726">-трёп-</font></a></sup> 08:23, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>There was no Russo-Polish conflict. See the notes on names of Muscovy. Secondly, let's stay away from Russian or Namibian or whatever else point of view. Let's consider sources. My primary <a href="http://www.magister.msk.ru/library/history/solov/solv11p1.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.magister.msk.ru/library/history/solov/solv11p1.htm" rel="nofollow">source</a> of this article was <a href="../../../s/e/r/Sergey_Solovyov_8897.html" title="Sergey Solovyov">Sergey Solovyov</a>, a prominent Russian historian. While he writes extensively not only on this conflict, but also on other wars of Muscovy of the time, this conflict in his representation is viewed as Moscow's fight for influence in Ukraine. That included not just military option, but extensive and well documented negotiations with Vyhovsky and other rival factions of Ukrainian civil war. To term the Trubetskoy misadventure at Konotop a Muscovy-Poland conflict is wrong and is not supported by reputable source. Again, to have a meaningful discussion you have to educate yourself with well respected sources on this conflict. --<a href="../../../h/i/l/User%7EHillock65_13a1.html" title="User:Hillock65">Hillock65</a> 12:18, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The Russian wiki lists it as part of the Ruin, the Polish wiki lists it as Polish-Russian war.

<dd>Sure. But then Russians must include mentioning of the Ruin in all articles and Poles should list the Ukrainian and Russian variants. Is that feasible? Why don't Russian nationalists just leave us alone? Does everything have to be what <b>they</b> like? Someone doesn't like the name Muscovy in the title - fine, I changed it, now they don't like the new title either. It has to stop. This is counterproductive.

<dd>That is a usual outcome if you have to deal with sensitive issues. In these cases it is helpful not to be overly emotional but to keep a rational mind. If you feel the progress of the article is massively hampered by these conflicts you can call in other editors who have some knowledge on the topic.

<dd>I have been trying to resolve it amicably, you can see it on this page - I have cited sources and in responce just got reverting back and forth.

<p>Hillock, there is a space where Ukrainians can write about their own history without the interference of their neighbores. It is uk-wiki. Because en-wiki is much more of an international project, here we have to edit our articles together with editors representing different national POV. The crux of the matter is the middle ground between keeping "foreigners" from the national articles and allow them to engage into <a href="../../../t/e/_/WP%7ETE_1869.html" title="WP:TE">Tendentious editing</a> that results in giving certain POVs an undue weight in the articles about the Ukrainian history. We should be looking for such middle ground rather than seeking non-Ukrainians banned from editing the Ukrainian topics. --<a href="../../../i/r/p/User%7EIrpen_a72e.html" title="User:Irpen">Irpen</a> 21:16, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I am not banning anyone, I think you are exagerrating it. My intention is that others, who have different perceptions, and often skewed perception of history of others allow people to write articles without harrasment because they don't like the name for their country that I cite from sources, or because in their view some other historical figure is a traitor, or some other silly reason. I do welcome criticism, but a criticism that leads to impovement of the article, not the kind of harassment that I received from our common Russian friend. I have a right to write whatever I want and wherever I want, I will consider other people view's, but will fight tooth and nail to defend my own.</dd>

<dd>BTW, have you already criticized Ghirla for moving pages without warning, or I missed it?

<dd>Fine. If you can use the source for the article just go on. To mention you a different example would be the use of <a href="../../../g/e/r/German.html" title="German">German</a> for <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germanic_people.html" title="Germanic people">Germanic peoples</a> in Roman times.

The Dutch for example proudly present their Germanic roots but would run amok if you misspelled it as German roots.

<p>The article gives anachronistic name of the Cossack state. Vyhovsky started his declaration of war against Russia with words "We, the Army of Zaporizhya", the official name of the state.

<p>The article gives no coverage of the begining of the campaign, unwillingness of Trubetskoy to clash with Cossacks (according to recommendations of the Russian goverment "to persuade Cossacks"), his long negotiations with Vyhovsky. It gives to schedule of forwarding Russian troops:</p>
<ul>
<li>January, 30 1659 - Putivl (Russian border)</li>
<li>End of March (about 2 months later, after unsuccessfull negotiaitons with Vyhovsky) Russian troops passed into Hetman Ukraine territory.</li>
<li>April, 19 1659 the beginning of the siege of Konotop.</li>

Now, that you replied, you can either wait for the reaction to see whether the tagger is now satisfied, or if you <i>really</i> can't wait <i>and</i> really think that the objections are with no merit or asnwered fully. You may remove the tag and see, whether Russianname will replace it. To summarize, I reverted Alex Kov, because, unlike you, he did not bother to respond to the tagger's objections at all.

<dd>Let's wait and see. However, I do believe you were right in saying that placing a tag is a serious matter, and as long as discussion is still going on I don't see the point in putting it over the whole article. There were some general questions and disagreements, it doesn't warrant the whole article being tagged. I don't want to make a big issue over this, it doesn't matter if the tag stays, what at issue is that placing a tag should not be taken lightly by anyone and should be treated without bias in all cases by everyone.
