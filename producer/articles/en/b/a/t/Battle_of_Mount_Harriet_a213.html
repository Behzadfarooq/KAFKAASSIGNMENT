<p>The <b>Battle of Mount Harriet</b> was an engagement of the <a href="../../../f/a/l/Falklands_War_17db.html" title="Falklands War">Falklands War</a> which took place on the night of 11/<a href="../../../j/u/n/June_12.html" title="June 12">12 June</a> <a href="../../../1/9/8/1982.html" title="1982">1982</a> between British and Argentine forces. It was one of three battles in a brigade-sized operation on the same night.</p>
<p>The British force consisted of <a href="../../../4/2/_/42_Commando_Royal_Marines_63dd.html" title="42 Commando Royal Marines">42 Commando (42 CDO)</a>, <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Marines_5256.html" title="Royal Marines">Royal Marines</a> under the command of Lt. Col. Nick Vaux <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Marines_5256.html" title="Royal Marines">Royal Marines</a> (who later became a general) with artillery support from a battery of <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Regiment_of_Artillery_28cc.html" title="Royal Regiment of Artillery">29 Commando Regiment, Royal Artillery</a>. The 1st Battalion, <a href="../../../w/e/l/Welsh_Guards_4318.html" title="Welsh Guards">Welsh Guards</a> (1WG) and two companies from 40 CDO were in reserve. <a href="../../../h/m/s/HMS_Yarmouth_%28F101%29_c0dc.html" title="HMS Yarmouth (F101)">HMS <i>Yarmouth</i></a> provided naval-gunfire support for the British forces. The Argentinian defenders consisted of Lieutenant-Colonel Diego Soria's <a href="../../../4/t/h/4th_Infantry_Regiment_e633.html" title="4th Infantry Regiment">4th Infantry Regiment</a> (RI 4).</p>
<p>On the night of 30 May, K Company of 42 CDO moved forward of San Carlos to secure the commanding heights of Mount Kent, at 1,504 feet the tallest of the peaks surrounding Stanley, where the D Squadron SAS Troops had already established a strong presence. However when these arrived at their landing zone some 3 kilometres (2 mi) behind the ridge of the mountain, the Marines were surprised to see the flashes and lines of tracer ammunition light up the night . After a fierce fight at close quarters the Argentine patrol (Captain Tomas Fernandez's 2nd Assault Section, 602nd Commando Company) melted away from the boulders and snow-soaked scrub and grass. By the end of May Major Cedric Delves' D Squadron had gained Mount Kent and Tactical HQ commenced patrolling Bluff Cove Peak which they took with a loss of two wounded.</p>
<p>The attack was preceded by many days of observation and nights of patrolling. Some night-fighting patrols were part of a deception plan to convince the Argentinians that the attack would come from a westerly direction. Other, more covert, patrols were to find a route through a minefield around the south of Mount Harriet. Sniping and naval artillery were used to harass the defenders and deny them sleep.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_3.html" title="June 3">3 June</a> Lieutenant Chris Marwood's Reconnaissance Troop of 42 CDO patrolling forward from Mount Challenger encountered an RI 4 fighting patrol (3rd Platoon of B Company). Two of the conscripts were instantly killed in a withering burst of rifle fire, and a corporal went down wounded to a head shot by one of the Marine snipers as he took cover among the rocks. The Royal Marines were taken completely by surprise when Argentine special-forces commandos joined in the movement and a general counter-attack developed. Captain Nick D' Appice remembers:</p>
<p>We were separated from our heavy bergans with the radios and all our gear. The patrol was spread over quite a large area, with lots of shouting, noise and firing going on. The Marines abandoned all their equipment, and although no one told us, it became clear that we were to withdraw. With no information, and the likelihood of having to fight our way out, Dave Greedus and I decided to abandon our equipment, destroying as much as we could. The two radio sets (HF and UHF) were tough enough, but the HAZE unit of the laser target marker was designed to withstand the weight of a tank! (Hugh McManners, The Scars of War, p. 238, Harper Collins Publishers, 1993)</p>
<p>On the night of 8-9 June, action on the outer-defence-zone flared when Lieutenant Mark Townsend's 1 Troop (K Company, 42 CDO) probed Mount Harriet, killing two Argentines. At the same time three strong fighting patrols from 3 PARA attempted the same on Mount Longdon, but the Rasit ground surveillance radar there was able to detect the Paras and artillery fire dispersed the force.</p>
<p>On the morning of the <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_11.html" title="June 11">11 June</a> the orders for the attack were given to 42 CDO by Vaux; K Company were ordered to attack the eastern end of the mountain while L Company would attack the southern side an hour later, where it, if the mountain was secured, would then move north of Mount Harriet to Goat Ridge. J Company would launch a diversionary attack (codenamed Vesuvius) on the western end of Mount Harriet.</p>
<p>In the closing hours of the <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_11.html" title="June 11">11 June</a>, K and L Companies moved from their assembly area on Mount Challenger (which lay to the west of Mount Harriet) and made their way south, around their objective, across the minefield, to their respective start lines. As they moved around the feature in the dark, J company launched their very loud diversionary "attack" from the west.</p>
<p>BATTLE SUMMARY</p>
<p><a href="../../../w/w/w/Image%7EWwwF56BattleMtHarriet.GIF_988a.html" class="image" title="Image:WwwF56BattleMtHarriet.GIF"><img src="../../../upload/2/23/WwwF56BattleMtHarriet.GIF" alt="Image:WwwF56BattleMtHarriet.GIF" width="401" height="296" longdesc="../../../w/w/w/Image%7EWwwF56BattleMtHarriet.GIF_988a.html" /></a></p>
<p>The battle for Mount Harriet began on the evening of 11 June with a blistering naval bombardment which killed two Argentines and wounded twenty-five. John Witheroe, one of the British war correspondents, later recalled the softening up fire:</p>
<p><i>We were involved with one night attack on Mount Harriet, when the Welsh Guards were coming up as a back-up. This involved marching for several hours on a very dark night, through a minefield. Sporadic shellfire slowed our progress tremendously. Eventually we made the base of Mount Harriet, which was coming under incredible fire from a frigate ashore. The whole mountain seemed to erupt in flame. It seemed impossible that anybody could survive an attack like that. This went on for well over an hour, shell after shell whistling over our heads and hitting the mountain. Eventually this was lifted and the Marines went in. To our amazement there seemed to be an incredible amount of fighting going on. There was a lot of tracer fire. The whole night was being lit up by flares, which cast a dead, unrealistic, pall over the whole scene.</i> (Speaking Out: Untold Stories from the Falklands War, p. 271, Andre Deutsch, 1989)</p>
<p>Captain Peter Babbington's K Company crossed their start-line first and proceeded up the mountain undetected, knifing two sentries on the way. They remained undetected until they approached Sub-Lieutenant Mario Juarez's 120-mm Mortar Platoon positions and decided to engage them. They were assisted in the advance by HMS <i>Yarmouth</i>, artillery and mortars. During the engagement Corporal Larry Watts was killed. About 150 metres from Soria's HQ, Corporal Nigel Ward circled behind a group of Argentines who were setting up an ambush. Although half a dozen Argentines and a MAG were placed to massacre anyone who broke cover, Ward darted out from under cover to charge the enemy machine gun. He grenaded two of the crew, but reaching the rear of the machine gun position, he was shot through both legs. With the enemy machine gun out of action, Corporals Mick Eccles and Chrystie Ward were able to clear the position without losses. The three corporals were awarded the Military Medal. Increasing numbers of Argentine soldiers, mainly conscripts from RI 4's Recce Platoon began to surrender, but the Commanding Officer and Intelligence Officer and several senior NCOs still fought on according to their orders.</p>
<p>L Company crossed their start line shortly after K Company and were almost immediately engaged by effective machine gun fire from Sub-Lieutenant Pablo Oliva's platoon defending the lower southern slopes. These weapons would not be silenced until being hit by several <a href="../../../m/i/l/MILAN_7303.html" title="MILAN">MILAN</a> anti-tank missiles and six 105 mm artillery guns from Mount Challenger. The L Company Marines contend they took fire from at least seven machine guns that only wounded five men, but as Hugh Bicheno detailed in Razor's Edge (Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, 2006), the 4th Regiment's passive night goggles were all with B Company.</p>
<p>Before first light Lieutenant Jerry Burnell's 5 Troop of L Company proceeded to an outcrop of rocks towards Goat Ridge. As they advanced the Royal Marine platoon came under heavy fire from Sub-Lieutenant Lautaro Gimenez Corvalan's 3rd Platoon and were forced to withdraw. L Company requested artillery fire onto the Argentinian platoon position, then 4 Troop moved forward and found that the Argentinians had withdrawn. Further fighting went on throughout the morning of <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_12.html" title="June 12">12 June</a> and a fanatically brave conscript, in a position just below the summit, held up L Company with accurate shooting until killed by an 84 mm anti-tank rocket fired at short range.</p>
<p>The battle was a textbook example of good planning and use of deception and surprise, and a further step towards their main objective of Port Stanley. British casualties were two killed and twenty-six wounded. Fifteen Argentine dead lay around the defences. Lance-Corporal Koleszar had the surprising experience of finding that two 'dead' Argentine soldiers, whose boots he was trying to remove, were very much alive and jumped up to surrender. Some British reporters were thus misled into depicting the Argentinians as hapless teenage conscripts who caved in after the first shots were fired, but Royal Marine Warrant Officer 2 John Cartledge who served with K Company during the battle corrected them, saying the Argentinians were good soldiers who had fought properly:</p>
<p>"They used the tactics which they had been taught along the way very well, they were quite prepared for an attack. They put up a strong fight from start to finish. They were also better equipped than we were. We had first generation night sights, which were large cumbersome pieces of equipment, while the Argentines had second generation American night sights that were compact and so much better than what we had. The one deficiency which we exposed was that they had planned for a western end of the mountain attack, and therefore had not bothered to extend their defensive positions to the eastern end, where we ultimately attacked’" (<a href="http://www.mercopress.com/detalle.asp?NUM=1210&amp;Palabra=mount%20harriet" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.mercopress.com/detalle.asp?NUM=1210&amp;Palabra=mount%20harriet" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>)</p>
<p>When J Company moved up the mountain on the bitterly cold morning of 12 June, the total catch was 300 prisoners, fifty of whom had been wounded.</p>
