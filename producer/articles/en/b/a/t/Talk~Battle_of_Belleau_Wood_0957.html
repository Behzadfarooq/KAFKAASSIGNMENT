<p>I am not sure that the following text is justified:</p>
<p><i>Thus ended one of the most bloody and ferocious battles in human history. (Although the Battle of Verdun and the Battle of the Somme in 1916 had been far worse.)</i></p>
<p>Even with the qualification, I do not think the casualties (particularly as the German ones are not given) justify such a statement. In comparison to other battles of the First World War, as stated above, let alone more ancient battles like the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Cannae_3437.html" title="Battle of Cannae">Battle of Cannae</a> the statement looks very exaggerated.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I just happened to wander by this article, and the same sentence jumped out at me, even before viewing the discussion page. Actually, the only reason I checked the talk page was that it seemed terribly obvious that someone had tacked an ill-fitting disclaimer on a bit of hyperbole, instead of rewriting the sentence. So, I rewrote the sentence. "On June 26th, a report was sent out simply stating, "Woods now U.S. Marine Corps entirely,"[4] (<a href="http://www.2ndbn5thmar.com/history/belleau3.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.2ndbn5thmar.com/history/belleau3.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.2ndbn5thmar.com/history/belleau3.htm</a>) ending the bloodiest and most ferocious battle U.S. forces would fight in the war." Hope that works for you, if not, modify as you see fit. <a href="../../../f/o/x/User%7EFox1_da16.html" title="User:Fox1">Fox1</a> 02:56, 3 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The statement is also false in the edit, many other battles the AEF fought (such as the Meuse-Argonne) ended in a much higher casualty count than Belleau Wood.</dd>

<p>Hi, not sure exactly how this works (am editing for the first time), but I've just removed a reference from this page - it said that a monument was built in 1921. I don't know when the monument was put up, but it definitely wans't -before- the battle happened, so I took it out. <small>—<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> <a href="../../../1/4/9/User%7E149.157.1.154.html" title="User:149.157.1.154">149.157.1.154</a> (<a href="../../../1/4/9/User_talk%7E149.157.1.154.html" title="User talk:149.157.1.154">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_149.157.1.154_9e37.html" title="Special:Contributions/149.157.1.154">contribs</a>) 4 January 2006.</small></p>

<dd>I'm confused, the article said 1923, not 1921, and the battle took place in 1918. 1923 is, by my calculations, chronologically considered to have occured after 1918. Anyway, I've restored the year, as I was able to confirm that.</dd>

<p>Why are the edit links in the middle of the part about Capt. Williams' quote? Does anyone else see this? I looked at the page and didn't see anything that stood out as wrong. I browsed the page using <a href="../../../f/i/r/Firefox.html" title="Firefox">Firefox 1.5.0.4</a>. <a href="../../../l/i/t/User%7ELittleman_TAMU_df2e.html" title="User:Littleman TAMU">Littleman TAMU</a> 16:40, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yeah, I tried fixing that too with no good result. I even looked at earlier versions of the page (where it looks right), copied that section (from its edit page) and repalced the current with it. No effect. It must be a weird wiki big. --<a href="../../../p/u/r/User%7EPurpleslog_79ef.html" title="User:Purpleslog">Purpleslog</a> 16:56, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>“The Germans held out stubbornly and did not surrender until Prince Wilhelm ordered a general retreat of soldiers surrounding the area.” No. That order came a month later.</p>
<p>“The battle was characterized by the different fire superiority tactics. The Americans used sharpshooters and snipers, while the Germans attempted to rake the battlefield with machine guns.” Sharpshooters and snipers were used right from the begiining of the war by all compatants the only difference being that the American rifles had better range. At Belleau Wood the Germans had their own sharpshooters and snipers and the Americans also had their own machine gunners when they assaulted the woods.</p>
<p>The battle was more characterized for a return to the way battles were fought in 1914. It’s a sin looking back on it now on how it was a battle that didn’t need to be fought and how US troops were thrown into that battle without knowing anything about infantry tactics and without a sound plan espeicially in 1918 after the huge strides in battlefield tactics and battle planning that were made. After the battle US troops were found where they had fallen in front of every machinegun nest while rushing them from the front. Something that the Allies and enemy had long since learned not to do. It wasn’t until months later when Pershing finally issued the orders for US troops to stop rushing machinegun nests.When the woods were finally cleared it was only after a heavy artillery barrage, something that was always done on WW1 battlefields before an attack would go in if the element of surprise was not an issue.</p>
<p>“The Marines were forced to make six sweeps” It would be more accurate to state that the Germans countered attacked six times each time removing the Americans from the Wood.</p>
<p><br />
Importance "Retreat, hell. We just got here” Famous last words. Maybe it could be noted that Captain Loyd Williams, along with many others, didn’t survive the battle. Sometimes it’s tactically advisable to retreat. it’s called a stragetic withdrawal.</p>
<p>“They fought off more than four divisions of Germans, often reduced to using only their bayonets or fists in hand-to-hand combat.” No they did not. It was elements of 5 divisions like this article already stated. Should this article not try to be acurate rather than suggesting that a larger number of the enemy was fought? Acording to first hand accounts there was no hand to hand combat.</p>
<p>“Combined with the actions at Chateau Thierry, the Battle of Belleau Wood brought an end to the last major German offensive of World War I.” No. The fifth offensive since March 21 and last major German offensive was launched on July 15. Belleau Wood didn’t stop the German offensive. It was an attack launched on the Germans in the woods who were already entrenched there.</p>
<p>“Today, at the American cemetery nearby, white crosses and Stars of David mark 2,289 graves, 250 for unknown service members, and the names of 1,060 missing men adorn the wall of a memorial chapel. Visitors also stop at the nearby German cemetery where 8,625 men are buried; 4,321 of them - 3,847 unknown - rest in a common grave.”</p>
<p>The German cemetery was created after the war and the German bodies were brought in from many locations where they had been killed in 4 years of war. Someone reading this article would go away thinking that they were killed at the Belleau Wood battle. 1200 Germans held the Wood and not all were killed. Brocky44 03:35, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
I don't understand the part about "After their victories at Cantigny and Chateau-Thierry" in the 2nd paragraph. [the big battle of] Chateau-Thierry was _after_ Belleau Wood. --75.85.15.24 04:37, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Well, the reasoning behind the statement about the Marines using sharpshooters and the Germans using MG's is that these were the main tactics. The U.S. troops were raked by machine gun fire until the Marines captured a small hill. Now, I've heard that at the time in Europe one was considered an excellent shot if he could hit a target at (I think) 500 yards. In the USMC, however, one was considered to be (I think) slightly above-average if he could hit a target at 800 yards, makeing <b>every</b> Marine a sharpshooter by European standards. The Marines flipped up their sights and went to work. One German commented "the Americans are savages-they shoot anything that moves!" (Nick31091 06:38, 26 February 2007 (UTC))</p>
