	    <p>Couldn't the first sentence state explicitly that <i>poetry</i> is what this is about? Even the second sentence, in stating that the term was introduced by a poet, doesn't really say it's about poetry; a poet can introduce a term that's about morality or nature or war and almost anything else. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Hardy_e932.html" title="User:Michael Hardy">Michael Hardy</a> 01:46, 8 Nov 2003 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>It can, except that the term isn't about poetry. <i>Peri Bathos</i> itself is prose, and, while Pope was talking about poetry, the term now refers to any situation in which an unintended comic effect is produced by an incongruous combination of high and low. I will try to clarify some more. Thanks for the input. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 00:59, 8 Aug 2004 (UTC)</li>

<li>Only if you consider "bathos" to be synonymous with undercutting (see below). Parody itself relies upon a countertext and an inversion. <i>The Rape of the Lock</i> takes the <i>form</i> of Virgil to discuss the apotheosis of a curl. Because Pope is fully aware that a lock of hair is not the proper cause of a feud, the joke works. If he were stupid and unaware and believed that the snipping of a curl warranted a fight, then he would be Lord Petre or Arabella Fermor and silly. (I.e. if <i>Rape of the Lock</i> is bathos, then so is <i>Macflecknoe,</i> <i>Lines on the Death of Dean Swift,</i> <i>Absalom and Achitophel,</i> <i>The Splendid Shilling,</i> and <i>Namby Pamby.</i>) <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 03:24, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>The article is now entirely rambling. Furthermore, it definitely conflates bathos with <i>deflation,</i> which is a longstanding comic technique that is totally unrelated to bathos. The first two examples are, in fact, not bathos at all. When Pope says, in <i>Rape of the Lock,</i> that great tragedies, like the death of a lover or Shock (the dog), he is doing it consciously for humorous effect. Consciousness of the technique means, in fact, that it is not "sinking" in poetry, but rather undercutting. (E.g. Kierkegaard saying that the self may be easily lost, and the loss of "an arm, a leg, or a wife" would be noticed more is a <i>joke,</i> and not bathos.) I almost reverted way back to the last version by Wetman.</p>
<p>I think there are some nice things said since then, but I also think it has wandered and flopped about too much. Yes, Pope applies it to all arts. Yes, the radical juxtaposition of high and low is bathos. No, it is not bathos when a person undercuts on purpose. (<i>Peri Bathos</i> was a satire. Not much point satirizing people who are doing it on purpose.) Further, I have yet to hear the term used in contemporary English for deflation or undercutting. I have heard it for unwitting undermining. The Mechanicals' performance of <i>Pyramus and Thisbe</i> in <i>A Midsummer Night's Dream</i> is the only case I can think of where there is conscious bathos: it is funny because it combines very lofty tragedy with very bad acting, and it only functions because the players themselves must be <b>unaware</b> of how bad they are.</p>
<p>In general, I have to say, "no, no, no." This article now needs a major restructuring. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 03:20, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>The thing about using an example from the book of Revelation is that it might be <i>possible</i> for someone to see the poetic figures as bathos, it is extremely unlikely. The verses are allegorical, and, generally, allegory regularly violates physical reality to achieve its philosophical and historical message. For example, Milton would never be accused of being bathetic for describing "the darkness visible." So, similarly, while it's possible for someone who misses the entirety of the allegory of <i>Revelation of St. John</i> to see the mere poetic tropes as disjunctive, the readership would never be looking at those tropes that way in the first place. In other words, there is no innocence of the author. (Bathos requires a poet unaware of the disjunction being created and therefore a significant <i>failure</i> ("art of sinking in poetry"), but John is aware of paradox and intent on it.) That's why I have removed the example: it simply isn't bathos. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 11:39, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Fair enough. To be honest, I came to the page to find out what bathos actually was after hearing the <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monty_Python_f0e0.html" title="Monty Python">Monty Python</a> sketch where a gangster uses sarcasm as a weapon:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"Well, I was terrified. Everyone was terrified of Doug. I've seen grown men pull their own heads off rather than see Doug. Even Dinsdale was frightened of Doug. He used…sarcasm. He knew all the tricks, dramatic irony, metaphor, <a href="../../../b/a/t/Bathos.html" title="Bathos">bathos</a>, puns, parody, <a href="../../../l/i/t/Litotes.html" title="Litotes">litotes</a> and…<a href="../../../s/a/t/Satire.html" title="Satire">satire</a>. He was vicious."</dd>
</dl>
<p>Having read what bathos was, especially the 'Dover pier' example, it reminded me of the verse in Revelation which I have always found funny. I visualise angels standing around looking at their watches. That's the disjunctive reception, on my part at least. Anyway, thanks for clearing it up. I'll be looking up litotes next.

<li>Sorry for being prickly, but there was a major rewriter who introduced a lot of ... static ... into the article, and since then people have been gradually trying to get it back in order. The rewriter also introduced some good stuff, so no one just wanted to revert him. At any rate, Pope's definition is still, I think, the operative one. <i>Bathos</i> is wonderful, though. It's probably like <a href="../../../k/i/t/Kitsch.html" title="Kitsch">kitsch</a>, except that it's specifically a radical disjunction between high and low. My favorite example from life was seeing a children's theatre doing <i>MacBeth</i>. I know that Tudor theater was often performed by children's companies, etc., but there is something surreal about 13 year olds acting out the complex grime of that play: the difference between the seriousness of the material and the youth and innocence of the actors created bathos -- a radical disjunction that the producers were unaware of. Some people have suggested that the <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Langley_Schools_Music_Project_e2b9.html" title="The Langley Schools Music Project">The Langley Schools Music Project</a>'s version of The Eagles's "Desperado" is bathetic, but I disagree. A 14 year old girl signing about longing and sadness is actually sort of right on the mark. (For more unconscious humor, though, where the <i>reader</i> being ironic creates the humor (which is what I think your example shows) is the infamous stage direction in Hamlet that Graham Chapman said was the funniest line in literature: "All die.") The Pythons were highly educated folks and bright fellows, but I think Dougie Dimsdale may have been using the term inappropriately.&#160;:-) ("He shows up -- in a tank -- and he says, 'Come on, Reg, let's go for a little scrape.'") <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 09:41, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Now someone (oh, I see it's a <a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottandrewhutchins_fac3.html" title="User:Scottandrewhutchins">Scottandrewhutchins</a>) has added a <sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> notice into one of the examples. How could this little challenge have been avoided? It intentionally defaces the article. Might we expect an explanation of his action by <a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottandrewhutchins_fac3.html" title="User:Scottandrewhutchins">Scottandrewhutchins</a> here at the Talkpage, if this little tag is not to be reverted again and ignored. Perhaps a <i>better</i> example of bathos would be best, to demonstreate that the perpetrator is not merely tone-deaf and eliminate any possible doubts about good intents. What about it? Let's hear <a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottandrewhutchins_fac3.html" title="User:Scottandrewhutchins">Scottandrewhutchins</a>'s example of bathos! Perhaps if the term is obscure to this one reader, the article needs to be made plainer and more obvious, so that <i>everyone</i> can understand bathos, and no one feels excluded and cross. --<a href="../../../w/e/t/User%7EWetman_82d0.html" title="User:Wetman">Wetman</a> 04:41, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Well, I'm against "citation needed" tags tossed in when what's really involved in "this makes no sense." I see from edit comments that he has a problem with the <i>language</i>, but I have a problem with the example itself. I don't think that the Moody Blues lyric is particularly bathetic, or at least not obviously so, and therefore we might be better off with another example. There is nothing wrong with putting "senior citizens" in. For serious bathos among contemporaries, I'd turn to <a href="../../../r/o/d/Rod_McKuen_0d0c.html" title="Rod McKuen">Rod McKuen</a>, whose poetry is dripping with bathos, or, in lyrics, perhaps "MacArthur Park." Some of the bad hair metal bands that attempted trolls 'n elves mythology (a la Spinal Tap's "Stonehenge") manage it, too, and <a href="../../../d/o/n/Donovan.html" title="Donovan">Donovan</a>'s "Atlantis" is pretty bathetic, but it's difficult to use pop music for bathos. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 10:26, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I agree that "MacArthur Park" is bathetic. <a href="../../../22/w/e/_Weird_Al__Yankovic_79e3.html" title="&quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic">"Weird Al" Yankovic</a>'s parody, "Jurassic Park" is easier to take seriously<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5MCrmNnEjs" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5MCrmNnEjs" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. But something other than pop music might be altogether better.

<dd>Part of the problem— which is more like the cultural equivalent of a <a href="../../../l/a/n/Language_barrier.html" title="Language barrier">language barrier</a> than to tone-deafness— has been that "<a href="../../../d/e/c/Decorum.html" title="Decorum">Decorum</a>" in Wikipedia was merely a redirect to "<a href="../../../e/t/i/Etiquette.html" title="Etiquette">Etiquette</a>" (vivid!). So I've begun an article on literary decorum: its deconstruction by modernism has rendered post-historical readers— those lacking any historical perspective— unable to <i>hear</i> bathos, <a href="../../../m/o/c/Mock-heroic.html" title="Mock-heroic">mock-heroic</a> or literary <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burlesque.html" title="Burlesque">burlesque</a>, because they have no expectations. You'all might help out with <a href="../../../d/e/c/Decorum.html" title="Decorum">decorum</a> as well as finding some better examples of bathos here, to introduce both ideas more effectively in virgin territory. --<a href="../../../w/e/t/User%7EWetman_82d0.html" title="User:Wetman">Wetman</a> 06:35, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>Oooh, very good idea. We really, really need to explain decorum. It's an important subject, and the classical locus of the discussion is Addison in <i>The Spectator.</i> He, of course, had French sources, but he also interpreted and made an English version of it. You have to have decorum to understand why bathos is such a literary crime. (As for the examples in Bathos, I was getting accused of WP:OWN because this has been "my" article, so I stepped back. When a mass of stuff got added in, I asked other readers if they thought I should revert. They didn't. They thought it was a mess, but that there was too much good with the bad to just revert, and then I got overwhelmed by the task of a wholesale rewrite that wouldn't leave me open to "OWN"ership criticisms.) <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 11:15, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
