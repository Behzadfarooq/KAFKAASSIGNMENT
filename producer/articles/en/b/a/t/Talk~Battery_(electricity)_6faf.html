<li>I think it was vandalized, but (given how long it's been since I'd looked at it) there were also improvements. Thanks for the link, which I used to reinsert some of the vandalized material. On the plus side, the "vandalized" version moved excessive history to another entry (yes!), some relevant equations were added, and it seems to have a more unified voice. On the minus side, it deleted some relevant circuit theory (my thanks to whomever provided the figure), some of the essential history of batteries (my own contribution), and some of how they work (my own), all of which I just replaced.

<p>This section sure could use more information. The NiCad article too. I'd write it but I don't know anything about it and need some information right now (I have six 80 lb NiCad batteries left by a neighbor that died and no one will take them &#160;:-( ). 71.226.121.41 21:36, 3 January 2006 (UTC) JCP</p>
<p>Actually, a cell is a single "Battery" like an AA, but a Baterry is just a plural word for cell i.e. a battery is made up from lots od cells. I don't think this is made clear in the article.</p>

<p>Why not have some chemical equations? There is an equivalent circuit of a battery here, but not much information on how electrochemical cells actually <i>work</i>. Does anyone who contributes to wikipedia know any chemistry?</p>
<p>Can the battery versus cell distinction be based on the fact that the cell voltage is fixed by electrochemistry while battery voltage can be any sum of cell voltages?</p>

<p>Hmm.. perhaps some more info on real batteries maybe? I dislike how you use the word battery vs. cell. Now that I'm thinking once more, I would like to see information about depolarizers on here, there is no article for it. You have jack information about that.

<p>Did they really use it for electric power (which to me implies an understanding of electric power to some degree), or did they use it for the side effects of electric power (which implies no understanding of electric power)?

<p>An "A" battery was used on battery powered vacuum tube radios from the 1920's onward. The "A" battery was typically a rechargeable lead acid battery or for portable sets a dry cell battery composed of several cells could be used. The current draw was usually over .5 ampere. It had to produce this fairly large current to power the tube filaments. Powering a tube radio from dry cells was very expensive due to their rapid exhaustion, even when hooked up in a series-parallel arrangement. The "B" battery was a low current, high voltage dry cell battery(one or more 45 volt batteries in series) used to power the plate circuit. A substitute today might be a number of 9 volt batteries in series. A "C" battery was a low voltage dry cell, 1.5 to 4.5 volts, used to provide grid bias for the circuit, and the terminology did not mean any equivalence with today's C cells. Today's equivalent might be 1 to 3 AA batteries in series. Except for rural users who had no electric utility and portable sets, the battery sets were largely obsolete by the late 1920's, when sets powered by 120 volt alternating current or direct current came along, eliminating the cost of buying batteries or paying to have the A battery recharged at a radio shop. Would a referenced historical section on these batteries be appropriate for inclusion?<a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 15:29, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>When Volta (from whose name the unit of measure volt) invented the battery, it was made of a raw of many diffferent disks (of two type, disposed alternatevely). The term battery (also in Italian and maybe in Latin) originally mean <i>a group of similar thing that are kept together</i>. I have found this meanig also in my little (modern) English dictionary. In my humbly opinion the link between battery and beat are quite not evident. In Italian the term 'batteria' nowdays means also a musical instrument: the drums (I mean the set of drums, cymbals and so on). Even if many persons not correctlly belive the term came from to beat (in Italian 'battere'), it cames from the fact that it a set of instrument. The name 'piles' comes from the Volta's bactery. It was a vertical coloum with many disk disposed in a pile. Often many batteries are used connected in series or paraller. Even if you see just one battery sometimes inside there are some battery connected among them. This is the case of the battery of 4.5 V (that by the way is not in the table) that is made by 3 real batteries of 1.5 V (but do not open it if do not know how to do it safely, be careful) <a href="../../../a/n/y/User%7EAnyFile_a868.html" title="User:AnyFile">AnyFile</a> 11:26, 15 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Volta invented the <i>electrochemical</i> battery in <a href="../../../1/7/9/1799.html" title="1799">1799</a>, but Franklin invented the <i>electrostatic</i> battery before that. It was Franklin who first used the word <i>battery</i> in the electrical sense, referring to an array of eleven capacitors, in a letter to Peter Collinson of the Royal Society in London on the 29th of April <a href="../../../1/7/4/1749.html" title="1749">1749</a>. (There is a transcript of the letter <a href="http://www.tufts.edu/as/wright_center/fellows/bob_morse_04/04_Franklin_Lab_Part_IV.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.tufts.edu/as/wright_center/fellows/bob_morse_04/04_Franklin_Lab_Part_IV.pdf" rel="nofollow">here</a>). You are probably right that Franklin was using the word in the sense of "an array of objects", not as in "a beating", but he probably chose that word (instead of the more obvious alternatives such as "array" or "whole bunch") because of its association with violence. --<a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHeron_606a.html" title="User:Heron">Heron</a> 14:58, 15 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The OED also gives the derivation for "battery" in the electrical sense from its meaning of "a number of pieces of artillery placed in juxtaposition for combined action" as opposed to the whacking-about-the-body-with-a-stick meaning. Even if Franklin was influenced by the word's association with violence, it would seem the current etymology given in this article is incorrect. Any objections to changing it?

<dd>In a broader sense batteries and fuel cells convert chemical energy to electrical energy. A flow battery also has (some or all) of its energy store outside of the converter/ reactor. Therefore, a fuel cell could be considered as a type of battery. Also metal-air batteries (also known as consumable anode fuel cells) take air as one of their reactive components - battery or not?</dd>

<p>That is an excellent question. I suspect that there are several different failure modes for batteries. Let me try adding my best guess to the article. Does anyone know any better? --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidCary_1a42.html" title="User:DavidCary">DavidCary</a> 05:12, 3 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The material is electrolyte paste and corroded metal. In the original carbon-zinc dry cell this happened very frequently becaused the "consumed" zinc electrode was the <i>outer can</i> of the cell and almost always developed holes through which electrolyte leaked just before it died. Modern batteries invert this construction, putting the "consumed" electrode on the inside and enclosing the cell in a steel jacket. However there are still a few small paths through which electrolyte can occasionally leak even in these cells (however it is usually limited to the ends by the steel jacket – the old cells could leak anywhere... wherever the zinc was eaten through first).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>But as <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidCary_1a42.html" title="User:DavidCary">DavidCary</a> stated, batteries have many failure modes, this leakage of electrolyte paste is only the external symptom of any of several internal failures. -- 205.175.225.5 02:23, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yep, old batteries could broke of their own. Today, some batteries "become older" and don't give as much power than before. But the main origin of their poor lifetime is from the manufacturer. They install a small system which lets some of the respective electrodes slowly melt with the other one, definitly damaging the cell. Of course, they wouldn't want to sell batteries which can be used during 10 years ( if they can be charged ), they usually break down after one year ... So that you go to buy an other one&#160;;-). So the battery can deplete even if it has never been used. This can't be much used in generic batteries, but in specific batteries, as in electronic products, you can find this system --<a href="../../../t/o/t/User%7ETotophe64_eaa8.html" title="User:Totophe64">Totophe64</a> 18:26, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>What you're probably asking is "How many Ampere-Hours" in each size of battery. The answer to that varies depending on the exact battery technology and vendor, but <b>roughly speaking</b>, an AAA <b>alkaline</b> battery is about 800 mAH, an AA battery is about 2000 mAH, and a D cell is probably 8 or 10 AH. By comparison, in NiMH, an AA battery rated 1800 mAH is about as good as it gets today (<a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>).</dd>

<dd>You might also be asking the question "How much current can a battery comfortably deliver?".

<p>Some people claim that hybrid-electric vehicles and BEVs ultimately consume more fossil fuel than internal combustion engines. They claim that constructing the batteries themselves requires lots of grid electricity (and it occurs in countries where most electrical power comes from fossil fuels). This large amout of fossil fuel consumed is never quite paid back by the better efficiency of the electric vehicles in operation.</p>
<p>A very rough estimate is made by <a href="http://www.rogerlsimon.com/mt-archives/2005/06/toyota_and_the.php#c54941" class="external text" title="http://www.rogerlsimon.com/mt-archives/2005/06/toyota_and_the.php#c54941" rel="nofollow">j.pickens</a>. It seems to support such claims. Does anyone know a more accurate estimate?</p>
<p>The argument sounds very similar to the <a href="../../../s/o/l/Talk%7ESolar_cell_a8d3.html" title="Talk:Solar cell">Talk:Solar cell</a> and <a href="../../../n/e/t/Net_energy_gain.html" title="Net energy gain">Net energy gain</a>.</p>

<dd>Unfortunently j.pickens has a few figures wrong, the $6000 Prius battery is more like $3000 MSRP plus $3000 core exchange, which might be where the $6K figure came from. In all reality the battery cost Toyota about $500 as the going high production volume rate is in the $500-$1000/kWh range for NiMH. Just for further referance Li-ion is at about $400/kWh. Now re-running his figures from the point of this error leaves us with 50% energy input or $250 worth of energy to create the battery pack. At $0.09/kWh we get 22.5kWh and not 33,000kWh to produce the battery, that's about the energy content of 1 gallon of gas vs 1000 gallons. Anyway, all of this is moot and I may have even misplaced a decimal. There really must be better referances out there. Can we get Sony or Panasonic to tell us what it actually costs them to run a factory for a year which produces X quantity of such and such battery? This would include to materials, labor, energy, etc, etc for a much clearer picture... --<a href="../../../d/0/l/User%7ED0li0_34ef.html" title="User:D0li0">D0li0</a> 13:24, 3 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Another approach would be to estimate the dollar value of the motor fuel savings over the life of the Prius battery. Presumably the hybrid powerplant has to yield a net <i>monetary</i> savings to the consumer, or it would not make sense to buy. Suppose the battery lasts for six years and saves $1000 in fuel per year. Then it would just break even at a $6000 replacement cost if we ignore the time value of money. If the consumer just breaks even, there must be a net energy savings, because the savings is all energy (fuel) cost, whereas the battery cost includes other non-energy costs such as labor and so on to manufacture. The hybrid powerplant might provide other advantages, such as less vulnerability to temporary shortages of fuel. If terrorists blow up Saudi Arabia or there is some other fuel emergency and governments have to impose rationing, hybrid drivers will probably fare better than <a href="../../../h/u/m/Hummer.html" title="Hummer">Hummer</a> drivers. Even if the hybrid vehicle yields no net energy savings, it will <i>already have been manufactured</i> and thus is not as dependent on the momentary supply of fuel. Of course a <a href="../../../b/i/c/Bicycle.html" title="Bicycle">bicycle</a> is even less dependent on the momentary supply of fuel, and thus confers even more energy security. --<a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETeratornis_723b.html" title="User:Teratornis">Teratornis</a> 20:49, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

I certainly wouldn't invest in this technology. This appears to be a fairly standard Al-air battery where they use ozone in place of air. This supposedly gives a slight increase in the cell voltage. Although it is clear where air comes from, how is the ozone produced? They mention using high voltages. This would entail an energy input to make the battery operate. So where does the initial energy come from? I wouldn't take this idea to seriously until they have published some peer-reviewed experimental results. <a href="../../../a/h/w/User%7EAhw001_85e1.html" title="User:Ahw001">Ahw001</a> 06:47, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I wonder if this recent text is actually a mistake? I've read about <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supercapacitor.html" title="Supercapacitor">supercapacitors</a> being used as stand-ins for batteries (and some of them are "big" enough that they're rated in mAH: <a href="http://www.epcos.com/inf/20/35/ds/B49410B2506Q000.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.epcos.com/inf/20/35/ds/B49410B2506Q000.pdf" rel="nofollow">3500 mAH!</a>), but I haven't yet hear about any "ultra-high-<b>voltage</b> capacitors being used.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Then again, the Supercaps article contains this text:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>As of spring 2006, EEStor Inc. claims to have a supercapacitor with a barium titanate dielectric nearing production. The company claims a unit with 37 farads capacitance and an operating voltage of 3.5 kV, capable of storing up to 52kWh. The technology is scheduled for third-party verification during the summer of 2006.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>so maybe by supercap standards 3.5KV is "ultra-high voltage"? It's certainly about 1400 times more than your typical low-voltage supercap.</dd>

<dd>Rough answer: the energy cost to manufacture any product is unlikely to exceed the normal selling price to the consumer, assuming the vendor is trying to make a profit (this is just common sense). Because the retail price has to pay for other costs (materials, labor, amortization on equipment, taxes), the energy cost will generally be some fraction of the ordinary final selling price, perhaps in the range of 10%-25%. Even when products are discounted during clearance sales, they rarely get discounted below the net cost of the energy required to make them and get them to the consumer. Most of the energy will have been purchased at industrial rates, but these are probably similar to what the individual pays for electricity and fuel, because the energy market is efficient and highly commoditized. Thus if a disposable battery retails for, say, US$1, you can look at your electric bill and see how much electric energy you can purchase for US$0.25, and that's probably an upper bound on the energy consumed to make that product and present it for sale to you. Note that for a disposable battery, the cost of the electricity it yields is many times higher than what the local power company charges. Residential consumers might pay from US$0.05 to US$0.10 per <a href="../../../w/a/t/Watt-hour.html" title="Watt-hour">kW·h</a>. Suppose a disposable battery retails for US$1 and yields 1 W·h. This is on the order of US$1000 per kW·h delivered, which in turn is on the order of ten thousand times the cost for residential electricity. Another way to look at it is that the disposable battery probably required around a thousand times as much energy to manufacture and distribute to the consumer as it will yield when the consumer uses it. <a href="../../../r/e/c/Rechargeable_batteries.html" title="Rechargeable batteries">Rechargeable batteries</a> obviously can have much better economics, and correspondingly lower environmental impact, when they take hundreds or thousands of recharges. But since the consumer has to pay for the electricity to recharge them, rechargeable batteries still end up costing more than electricity at the wall outlet, but not by nearly as large a multiple as disposable batteries, of course. <a href="http://www.greenbatteries.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.greenbatteries.com/" rel="nofollow">Here is a site which purports to be about batteries and the environment</a>. --<a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETeratornis_723b.html" title="User:Teratornis">Teratornis</a> 20:25, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The article talks about replacing the fruit in the homemade batteries because it gets used up. I don't think it is the fruit that wears down the battery. Maybe the fruit gets old &amp; moldy &amp; doesn't conduct as wel, but it is not the cause of the battery not working. The energy comes from the chemical transformation of the metal electrodes into their oxides or their chlorides or whatever the transformation is. The fruit is merely the path that the electricity takes, like the wires in a circuit.</p>

<p>Is there any source for Franklin connecting capacitors in series and in parallel? I can well believe he connected them in parallel, because that is basically the same as having a larger Leyden jar. But the concept of series and parallel electrical connection were cutting edge in the 1830s, when Joseph Henry distinguished "intensity" (series) from ""quantity" (parallel ) connections of cells and of windings. Morse, for instance, in the 1830s had no concept that a low resistance electromagnet and a single cell could not operate a telegraph over an appreciable distance through the high resistance of the wires. To connect several Leyden jars in series to increase the voltage, Franklin would have needed to charge them individually with his friction machine, and place the jars on a thick clean glass surface to avoid the table they sat on from draining off the voltage between the outer foils of the jars. Absent a verifiable source, this claim should be removed.<a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 18:02, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

(I am afraid, but other sources states that it is possible to recharge Ni-MH twice as less times as Ni-Cd. That is: nickel-cadmium provides over 1000 charge/discharge cycles; nickel-metal-hydride the performance starts to deteriorate after 200-300 cycles if repeatedly deeply cycled. <a href="http://www.batteryuniversity.com/partone-4.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.batteryuniversity.com/partone-4.htm" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>)</dd>

<p>because of the two contradicting viewpoints. We need more authoritative sources if we're going to say which type lasts longer, if such a judgement can be made at all. --<a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHeron_606a.html" title="User:Heron">Heron</a> 17:27, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>There is a Wikipedia article for the B battery, used in tube radios. Now there is no link to it from here, and no link to it from the article on battery sizes. There used to be an article on the "A battery" used in tude radios, but now if you go to "A battery" you are misdirected to "AA battery," which has nothing whatever to do with the big old battery used to provide filament current for vacuum tubes. See my discussion above from June 7. I own a couple of radios from the 1920's which use A batteries, B batteries, and C batteries. I guess I will re-link this article to "B battery" and add a link from battery sizes to "B battery." How does one find an article which has been deleted, like "A battery"???<a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 14:34, 21 July 2006 (UTC) Found the batteries under <a href="../../../a/_/b/A_battery_%28vacuum_tubes%29.html" title="A battery (vacuum tubes)">A battery (vacuum tubes)</a> etc and added links where appropriate. Also added historical info on the use of lead-acid batteries for electric cars in the early 20th century, radio batteries in the 1920's, and local batteries for early 20th century phone. These were probably a very big portion of the sales of batteries in the early 20th century. There should also be info on battery-powered flashlights. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 15:46, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Did you know that in the 50s or the 60s, modern science has invented the <a href="../../../n/u/c/Nuclear_battery.html" title="Nuclear battery">nuclear battery</a>&#160;? I've seen depictions in old science books, one saying that one of these can put out 250,000 volts, but the amps are low. It was the size of a "D" cell, was either a Kr-85 or a Cerium -150 unit. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartial_Law_9af9.html" title="User:Martial Law">Martial Law</a> 21:47, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>What on Earth do you need 250 kV's for? High voltage is good for long distance transmission, but for everyday use, locally, it doesn't make much sense. Dry air has about 30kV/cm breakdown voltage limit before it sparks through, meaning your 250 kV terminals would have to be separated by at least 10 cm, and even then they'd pretty much short circuit through air at the slightest instability in ionization, such as extra moisture, or just take the surface resistivity path and dance along the battery surface and short circuit. What's good about these batteries (functioning at reasonable, low voltages) is that they can last very long, and function even in places with no sunshine, or limited sunshine, such as deep space probes flying by Pluto, where the Sun is so distant that solar panels don't produce enough energy. As far as efficiency in energy conversion goes, these batteries aren't stellar, but neither is anything else nuclear (current power plants near 35%, your battery is probably much less.) Their capacity is still pretty good on a volume/weight basis, because nuclear fuel is so dense in energy, though their use in everyday terrestrial applications would probably never happen because of terrorism issues - any kind of nuclear battery is pretty much limited to heavily supervised space/military type applications. So why bother thinking about it? If you can come up with a tamperproof containment method, where you can give it to the public, and the container is so resistant that it cannot be melted at least to 3000C electric arc or acetylene torch, or punctured/crushed by dropping a 1 ton block of steel on it, and it can survive inside an explosion conventionally detonated TNT mixture at high pressures/temperatures with sudden shock, without anything happening to the container and its contents, then we can talk. Can you come up with such a tamperproof container? Otherwise forget about it.<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESillybilly_95b4.html" title="User:Sillybilly">Sillybilly</a> 06:05, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've fixed the description a bit. Batteries <i>don't</i> produce DC, since the current depends on the load. Look at the load current in any electronic device any you'll usually see lots of rapid changes (lots of AC.) Instead, batteries produce constant or DC voltage. The term "DC" means "unvarying" when used in this way. (Engineers use AC/DC to mean varying/unvarying, rather than their more obvious meaning as direct current and alternating current. Hence "DC voltage" means "constant voltage" and not "direct current voltage.") For this reason batteries are known as "DC devices."</p>
<p>Also, the idea that batteries produce a constant direct current is a very common misconception. L. McDermott just described this misconception as common among grade school science teachers (article in American Journal of Physics, Sept 2006 issue.) For this reason we should avoid saying that a battery can "produce current." It's more accurate to say that a battery produces voltage. A load can draw a current, but this current depends on the load, and if the value of load should vary, the current will also vary. Indeed, if the load is a changing capacitance, then the battery will "produce AC." --<a href="../../../w/j/b/User%7EWjbeaty_8fc7.html" title="User:Wjbeaty">Wjbeaty</a> 20:33, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>My Battery Summary!! By&#160;: Farasat Siddiqui (c)</p>
<p><br />
Batteries</p>
<p>A battery can be thought up as a medium that stores energy or a can full of chemicals that produces electrons. Batteries come in all types of different shapes, sizes and prices. They range from small circular batteries used in watches costing only a few dollars to batteries for car engines costing $30,000.</p>
<p>Primary and Secondary batteries are the 2 categories of batteries. Primary batteries are the “cheaper” and most often used batteries but they can be "wasteful” they have to be thrown away because they are not rechargeable. Usually these are AA, AAA, D, C; etc.These can cause toxic waste problems. On the other hand Secondary Batteries are the rechargeable type. These are usually car batteries, computer batteries etc. Secondary batteries or rechargeable batteries are made up of 2 components, wet cells and dry cells. Wet cells are used to start up things and dry cells are used up to make batteries able to be recharged.</p>
<p>There are many battery types like, conventional lead acid at 35 watts per kilogram, sealed lead acid at 39 watts per kilogram, bi-polar acid at 50 watts per kilogram, nickel cadium at 55 watts per kilogram, nickel iron of 55 watts per kilogram, nickel-metal hydrate at 90 watts per kilogram, sodium sulphur at 110 watts per kilogram, and at the most lithium at 155 watts per kilogram.</p>
<p>Batteries operate from electrolytes. An electrolyte comes in liquids and it is a combination of chemicals. Batteries have two terminals. These are Positive and Negative. What is usually found at the top of a standard everyday battery is the positive terminal, the “thing” that comes out. It connects the battery to another object to make it work. A battery also needs a voltaic cell. A voltaic cell works by using a strip or rod of copper and sulfuric acid mixed with water. More cells create higher voltage.</p>
<p>From this you can see batteries have different forms, different types, different prices, and complex structures. Batteries are used in everyday life and people would be amazed by how many things would go wrong if batteries did not exist.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/t/Talk%7EBattery_%28electricity%29_6faf.html" title="Edit section: Invention probably in 1799, announcement definitely in 1800">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Invention probably in 1799, announcement definitely in 1800</span></h2>
<p>Most sources associate Volta's pile with the year 1800. Many phrase this in wording like "Volta announced his development of the pile in 1800." 1800 was the year when Volta sent a description of the pile to the Royal Society (in April), which was read before the Society in June, and according to one source "caused a sensation."</p>
<p>Some sources describe Volta as having <i>invented</i> the battery in 1799. This seems very likely, but quick searches didn't turn up anything really definitive as to when he actually <i>did</i> the work that he wrote about in April, 1800. The actual 1800 published paper does not address this.</p>
<p>Many sources do actually say that Volta first constructed the pile in 1800, e.g. "In 1800, Volta constructed the first galvanic cell,"<a href="http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN2881245692&amp;id=53APqy0KDaQC&amp;pg=PA310&amp;lpg=PA310&amp;sig=SRQ-SFpQNzgo3_3WLDNfyAqibyg" class="external autonumber" title="http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN2881245692&amp;id=53APqy0KDaQC&amp;pg=PA310&amp;lpg=PA310&amp;sig=SRQ-SFpQNzgo3_3WLDNfyAqibyg" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>." Others say that Volta <i>anounced</i> it in 1800.</p>
<p>I suspect the sources that say he first invented or constructed it in 1800 are likely mistaken and careless, but in any case, it seems that it was the pile's <i>announcement</i> which "caused a sensation" and was really the significant event.</p>
<p>I think the safest thing to do is to stick to the statement that Volta <i>announced</i> the pile in 1800, while noting in a footnote that some sources say he <i>invented</i> it in 1799. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 21:56, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
