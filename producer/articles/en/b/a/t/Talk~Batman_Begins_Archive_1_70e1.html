<p>The current (very long) plot summary section should probably be renamed to "Story", as it is certainly no longer a summary, and reads more like a story than a plot description. - James Foster 06:27, 14 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Better yet, it should be condensed to cover the main plot elements and actually remain a plot summary.

<p>Hi, please see the discussion section titled "Plot Synopsis" below, I'd like to open this topic up.</p>
<p><a name="Plot_Synopsis" id="Plot_Synopsis"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">Plot Synopsis</span></h2>
<p>I found the synopsis on the page for <a href="../../../a/l/i/Alien_vs._Predator_%28film%29_6633.html" title="Alien vs. Predator (film)">Alien Vs. Predator</a> to be equally disorganized and poorly written and helped to re-write the overview of the film. I believe that encyclopedic entries have no need for spoiler-filled, long winded, play by play descriptions of films (such as is currently being seen here on the BB page). I'd like to re-write the synopsis section, and while doing so condense it and remove the spoilers and surpurflouos information. I'd like to hear feedback from a few people before taking this on; please keep in mind that the page will be open for other people to edit during and after my own revision work, so it's hardly like I'll be taking the page over.--71.140.148.233 23:14, 11 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You mean the fat Asian guy at the end? I've never been able to tell if it's supposed to be the same Fake Ra's from the beginning--the seemingly thinner Asian guy. (Who was obviously chosen because this is Ra's appearance in the comics, I believe.) Onslaught Six 07:58, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That kinda p*ssed me off when I first saw it, coz Ra's is supposed to be Asian, not some European guy, but it was interesting to see Liam Neeson play a bad guy for a change.

<dd>Ken Watanabe plays Ra's Al Ghul, and Liam Neeson plays Henri Ducard. There is no fake Ra's Al Ghul, because Ra's transferred his soul into Ducard at some point.

<p>It has been well established, on this site and other media, that Liam Neeson is Ra's Al Ghul all along. In the comic books Ra's maintained his existence by periodically immersing himself in "lazarus pits" giving him a kind of immortality.Having mortal bodyguards named Ubu, after battling in a tournament to the death to replace the old one. What I wanted to know was someone could find the bases of the character that is played by Ken Watanabe in the movie. From the writer director or someone like that. Knight22 28 June 2006</p>
<hr />
<p>This is speculation my part, but EVula's comment "Batman Begins is not Batman Beyond" seemed to be saying that the same plot elements enstablished in the DC animated universe do not apply to the continuty enstablished in Batman Begins, as Jienum was referencing events from Batman Beyond as "evidence" of him being able to do so in Batman Begins. In my opinion, whether or not Ra's performed mind transfer in the the comic series or animation seems to have little impact on the plot of Batman Begins, as Christopher Nolan and David Goyer have taken liberties with their presentation of the Batman mythos. For instance, In the comics Ra's al Ghul was depicted as being of Arab dessent(possibly removed from the film as not to infer connection with current events), had an environmental motivation for his actions, as opposed to seeking "true justice", and also in the films was there no mention of the lazarus pits he used in the comics to maintain his youth. Further, in the comic series, Bruce trained with Henri Ducard in France, not in an unnamed country in Asia, and likely was unaware of the existance of the League of Assassins/League of Shadows prior to becoming Batman. The removal of the more supernatural elements of the plot, such as Ra's alchemic abilities, as well as the overall mood of the film seems to infer that the film was taking a more "realistic" approach, for lack of a better word. The dialogue "But is Ra's al Ghul immortal? Are his methods supernatural?" "Or just cheap parlor tricks to conceal your true identity, Ra's?" seemed to infer that Liam Neeson's character was Ra's all along, not simply a new "host", along with the fact that "Ducard" kept a decoy around at Wayne's party, which infers that Ken Watanabe's character was a decoy as well. No where in the film, apart from Ducard's comment, was Ra's inferred to have the supernatural abilities he possesed in the comics.</p>
<p>On a side note, the post following EVula's seemed to be opposed to the civility policy on Wikipedia, specifically "now try reading this, if you can, And until you know what I'm saying, don't bother speaking about what you have no idea."</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Katie Holmes</span></h2>
<p>A recent addition mentions that intentions for a sequel have been announced, with the same cast except for Katie Holmes "because of her relationship with Tom Cruise". What exactly does this mean? Did the studio not offer her a part because of the relationship, or did she turn down the role because of her relationship? -<a href="../../../d/y/n/User%7EDynSkeet_3c0b.html" title="User:DynSkeet">DynSkeet</a> <a href="../../../d/y/n/User_talk%7EDynSkeet_b41f.html" title="User talk:DynSkeet">(talk)</a> 20:22, Jun 22, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I've removed this comment. General Hollywood rules dictate that the opposite lead must change in each franchise output. Her character was a bad idea in the first place.

<dd>Your "general Hollywood" rules sound like crap to me. They didn't replace Mary Jane in Spider-Man, did they?

<dd>Mary Jane is a major character in the Spider-Man comic books. James Bond, Austin Powers, Speed come immediately to mind in terms of the rule. -<a href="../../../a/c/j/User%7EAcjelen_acd8.html" title="User:Acjelen">Acjelen</a> 12:50, 25 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>According to Batman On Film, it has something to do with her appearances on talk shows and television, where she spent more time promoting the high profile relationship and less time promoting the movie. I'll try and get some links this, as I feel it is an important reason for her not being included in a sequel. - Lastanzabianca</p>

<dd>Well, also her character is not nearly as necessary as any of the other characters in the cast in terms of preserving faithfulness to the comic book.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Comic Book → Movie</span></h2>
<p>There's a new paragraph at the end of the plot summary about changes from the comic book to the movie. I can see this growing into its own section, and it doesn't really fit as part of the plot summary; might that be a good idea?</p>
<p>Also, I'll buy the change of Ra's Al Ghul's motives as a considerable change, but <i>going to a movie theatre, not leaving an opera</i> is rather insignificant. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79"><font color="#00A86B"><small>A</small>и<small>D</small>я<small>01D</small></font></a><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79"><font color="#B87333"><small>TALK</small></font></a><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Android79_a162.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Android79"><font color="#0047AB"><small>EMAIL</small></font></a> 21:54, Jun 22, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Maybe the difference is significant? In the original, the movie the Waynes had just seen was "The Mark of Zorro", which later influenced Bruce's decision to be a masked avenger, but in the movie it was apparently the opera "Die Fledermaus" that emphasized Bruce's fear of bats. That's an interesting storytelling point, I think. User:ShawnVW

<p>Bear in mind that this is a rehash of the entire series of Batman films.

Justin Timberlake is a bad actor and it would be a severe mistake for Christopher Nolan to use the NSYNC prep as one of the Batman villains. Especially two-face. I'm still getting over the fact they are using Brokeback Mountain boy Heath Ledger as the JOKER. The right decision for the Joker should of been Crispin Glover. He is dark, creepy, and a has a weird sense of humor. He would fit the role of the JOKER like a glove. But instead they are using a C+ actor like Heath Ledger who only has A Knights Tale and Brokeback Mountain to back him up. But actually Justin Timberlake is even worse. He has nothing. Nada. Just some really bad singing.</p>
<hr />
<dl>
<dd>From what I've read, it seems as though Justin Timberlake as Harvey Dent/Two-Face is just an unfounded rumor being thrown around, very similar to the rumors of Adam Sandler being considered for the role of the Joker. If you read through the history section for "The Dark Knight (film)", you'll see that many actors who were listed as canadates for the Joker, such as <a href="../../../h/u/g/Hugo_Weaving_be08.html" title="Hugo Weaving">Hugo Weaving</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christopher_Eccleston_1eaa.html" title="Christopher Eccleston">Christopher Eccleston</a>, and <a href="../../../c/r/i/Crispin_Glover_69b1.html" title="Crispin Glover">Crispin Glover</a>, were removed due to the fact that there was little evidence that they were even being considered for that role. Further, the only actors listed as canidates for Harvey Dent are <a href="../../../j/o/s/Josh_Lucas_883e.html" title="Josh Lucas">Josh Lucas</a>, who has allegedly stated that he is intrested in the role, and <a href="../../../l/i/e/Liev_Schreiber_cf19.html" title="Liev Schreiber">Liev Schreiber</a>, who has stated that he has not even been spoken to about the role, but was interested in the role. Adding to that, the only reason he is listed as a canidate is because, much like Crispin Glover, a large number of fans thought he would be a good actor for the role as he resembles Two Face as he appeared in <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Long_Halloween_9d6d.html" title="The Long Halloween">The Long Halloween</a> (in fact, I have good reason to remove Liev from the listing as soon as I finish this post). As for my opinion regarding Heath Ledger being cast as the Joker, though I am a bit skeptical of Chris Nolan making this choice, think about what roles Christian Bale played in before Batman Begins, yet how well (in my opinion) he did with the role. Nolan appears to have a knack for picking actors suited to the characters he wants to portray (watch Memento, Insomnia, or his upcoming film <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Prestige_%28film%29_f547.html" title="The Prestige (film)">The Prestige</a>). Also, think about how diferent the roles of a knight and a gay cowboy are (although I personally have never seen the film regarding the latter of the two). This seems to infer that Ledger is capable of diverse roles, although no one cannot be sure how he will do with the role until The Dark Knight, or at least a trailer, is released. Finally, according to both Nolan and Bale, this interpretation of the Joker is going to be much more dark than Jack Nicholson's, Nolan having referred to it as "very creepy and very extreme", and probably more down to earth given the nature of Batman Begins. It does, however, seem highly unlikely that they are going to use Timberlake as Two Face, anyway.66.24.224.205 18:48, 14 August 2006 (UTC)

Lastly, your post really didn't contribute ANYTHING to the discussion beforehand, Mike.

<dd>In response to your comment that Ledger only has A Knight's Tale and Brokeback Mountain to back him up, he was also in <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lords_of_Dogtown_d326.html" title="Lords of Dogtown">Lords of Dogtown</a> and <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Brothers_Grimm_fece.html" title="The Brothers Grimm">The Brothers Grimm</a>, admitingly I have seen neither of these. Mike, you've mentioned elsewhere that you are a member of imdb, look up Ledger's profile and see what other movies he's been in. Where I admit that he has not been in all that many films, he may actually do better than expected, considering that the movies he is known for are, from what I've heard, not very well done (A Knight's Tale) or in other cases the target of baseless prejudices (Brokeback Mountain), which could lead to viewers misjudging his acting abilities. In regards to the films which are not well recieved, this could either mainly be the directors fault, or it is completely possible that Heath is simply a bad actor, in any case it is too soon to know how he will do with <a href="../../../j/o/k/Joker_%28comics%29.html" title="Joker (comics)">the Joker</a>. The film <a href="../../../n/e/d/Ned_Kelly_%282003_film%29_4567.html" title="Ned Kelly (2003 film)">Ned Kelly</a> actually got fairly good reviews from imdb. At any rate, the decision to cast Ledger has been final for quite some time now, so debating his credibility does nothing for the quality of the articles.</dd>

<hr />
<p>Well Tim, you do have a point by saying that I may be jumping to conclusions with Heath Ledger. But sometimes it takes basic judgement on predicting how good an actor or actress really is. I mean, you told me to check out Heath's filmography, and quite frankly, i think that only makes things worse. You mention movies like "The Brothers Grimm" which recieved a 5.9/10, and Lords of Dogtown which recieved a 6.6/10 rating. Both being not real good movies, otherwise proving that either Heath Ledger is a bad actor or just picks bad roles. He's mostly proven like in The Patriot starring Mel Gibson, that hes an ok supporting actor, but not leading. The Joker is a major villain role, and i think it is a major gamble for Christopher Nolan to pick an actor like Heath Ledger who has shown no sign of true acting talent; to play a hopefully sadistic role of the Joker. I would of definitly picked Crispin Glover for the role Of the Joker. He's shown that he can play differnt types of roles. Being the hilarious nerd in Back To The Future, and has shown his creepiness and dark side in Williard. So maybe this is the role that will reprise Heath Ledger as an actor, and will be redeemed for all of his recent bad movies. But i will still be skeptical until the day the movie is released.</p>
<hr />
<dl>
<dd>Where I personally think that Glover would have been a good actor for the role of the Joker, he was never being considered for the role to begin with. The reason he was rumored to be a canidate for the role was because a considerable number of fans considered him ideal for the role, but the rumor was just that, a rumor (and if you go to the page on <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Dark_Knight_%28film%29_7d0d.html" title="The Dark Knight (film)">The Dark Knight</a>, you'll see that the Glover was not listed as one of the actors who expressed an interest in the role). Similarly various actors listed as canidates for Harvey Dent were also just rumors, such as Leiv Schrieber, Jake Gyllenaal, Ryan Phillippe, Guy Pierce, and yes, Justin Timberlake (yet Schrieber is still listed as a canidate due to the fact that he has stated that he is willing to play Dent if offered the role). Further, my listing of different movies was not so much to find movies Ledger played in that were good so much as to put forth the possibility that he may be able to play different types of characters. Look up Ned Kelly on imdb and you will see that it where it got mixed reviews, a good number of them were in the 8.0/10-9.5/10 range. Keep in mind that Phillip Seymor Hoffman started off his career playing minor roles in (relatively) low key films.

<dd>Again, where Heath Ledger does seem quite a bit out of place for the Joker, keep in mind that Nolan seems to have an idea for what he is going to direct, and hires actors in terms of whether or not they can portray his idea (reportedly, Senn Penn was a primary canidate for the role of the Joker and declined due to scheduling conflicts, although this could just be a rumor). Batman Begins definatly had a more, for lack of a better term, "down to earth" atmosphere (with the exception of <a href="../../../s/c/a/Scarecrow_%28comics%29.html" title="Scarecrow (comics)">Dr. Crane's</a> behavior near the end of the film), and Nolan has outwardly stated that his version of the <a href="../../../j/o/k/Joker_%28comics%29.html#Film" title="Joker (comics)">joker</a> would be less eccentric than previous incarnations, but will remain close to his look in the comics. As I stated before, the new Joker is stated to be "very creepy and very extreme", and, according to an old article which may or may not be all that credable of a source, (<a href="http://www.comicbookmovie.com/news/articles/2437.asp" class="external free" title="http://www.comicbookmovie.com/news/articles/2437.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.comicbookmovie.com/news/articles/2437.asp</a>) the Joker in the Dark Knight "won't be zany and clowny but rather, in keeping with the tone of director Chris Nolan's films, will be dark and frightening, with a broad smile under his wide-brimmed hat." Where I am very skeptical of whether or not Ledger can portray this, keep in mind that, with the exception of with the exception of The Patriot and Brokeback Mountain, most of his roles were in low key films like The Brothers Grimm which really don't require all that much talent. This could prove that he is either: a)not being cast to the best of his abilities, or b) simply not a talented actor. If the latter is true, that leads me to wonder why Nolan would have cast him, perhaps he fits Nolan's idea of how the Joker should appear, or perhaps he sees something in him that is overlooked by others or underused in Ledger's films. On a side note, where you said this may be the role that reprises Heath Ledger, many people see Brokeback Mountain to have done that (where others see his acting in it as poor). Allegedly, one of the reasons Ledger was cast was to suprise the audience with his performance; if <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robin_Williams_a8f4.html" title="Robin Williams">Robin Williams</a> or <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Bettany_5d93.html" title="Paul Bettany">Paul Bettany</a> were used, people would have an idea as to how they would play the Joker, with Heath, people could actually be suprised by his performance. At any rate, casting an underused actor is, like casting an unknown, a gamble in that no one will know how his performance will be until the film is finally released.66.24.224.205 20:26, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Basically you're saying its a hit or miss type of situation. I'll agree with you on that. Maybe Heath will shock the world with a sadistic performance of the much acclaimed villain The Joker. Or maybe he will miserably do horrible and be the complete opposite of what the public wants and expects from the role. I will say that i dont have complete doubt in him, but im very skeptical. A good example of an actor who i disliked very much before, and like now is Leonardo Dicaprio. Hold on let me finish... If you've seen Martin Scorsese's The Aviator (2004) then you will understand what i am talking about. He did an incredible job in this movie, and i never would of expected or saw it coming from an actor like Leonardo Dicapprio. Who I used to refer to as "Leonardo Dicrappio". So maybe Heath will do in The Dark Knight for what Leo did for the Aviator. A great performance. But still, we have to look on both sides of the situation. I say if he does a good job, then put him in more bigger roles in the future. But if he bombs the role, he's gonna be yesterdays trash. And let me just say that I still have resentment towards him for participating in such an unorthodox type of movie, Brokeback Mountain. You know my political point of view, and i dont want to go to battle on that. Just see it in my point of view if you can breifly try. Anaylize both political party point of views if you will. I know for a fact, the left wing has no problem with a movie about gay cowboys. But right wingers like me, have a huge problem with it. And a role like that could affect me in a negative way on if i'd ever watch his movies again. But i'll give him a shot because i enjoy Christopher Nolan's work, and like you said, "he seems to know what he is doing". So more because of the director's choices, i'm giving Heath a second chance. But at the end, what everyone can agree on is we all want something fresh, dark, and new with this sequel. And it couldn't be done any better than Nolan himself. So Tim, i hope this movie will be great, and i'm very excited and anxious to see it.</p>

<p>In effect that is what I'm saying, yes. Still, Nolan has stated in one or more interviews that he plans to deviate from the previous film interpretations of the Joker, and make him much darker. It has also been mentioned that he is cosulting with <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jerry_Robinson_62d0.html" title="Jerry Robinson">Jerry Robinson</a>, the man who originally came up with the Joker character back in the 1940's, on how to portray him in <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Dark_Knight_%28film%29_7d0d.html" title="The Dark Knight (film)">this film</a>. Heath Ledger himself has allegedly stated about the perfomance being asked of him: "It's defenately going to stump people. I think it'll be more along the lines of how the Joker was meant to be in the comics, darker and more sinister. I wouldn't have thought of me ,either. But it's obviously not going to be what Jack Nicholson did." and, "It's going to be more nuanced and dark and more along the lines of <a href="../../../a/_/c/A_Clockwork_Orange_0b0e.html" title="A Clockwork Orange">a Clockwork Orange</a> kind of feel. Which is, I think, what the comic book was after...". (<a href="http://www.darkhorizons.com/news06/060908m.php" class="external free" title="http://www.darkhorizons.com/news06/060908m.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.darkhorizons.com/news06/060908m.php</a>) As for what you said about Ledger's role in Brokeback Mountain, I will agree with you that if he does poorly, he will be more associated with Brokeback than the Dark Knight, and it may be a possibility that <i>certain</i> people will not see future movies of his (In my opinion, out of blatent homophobia of him being "that guy who played a gay cowboy"). Still, his willingness to play such roles shouldn't affect one's opinion of someone as an actor. As you've said yourself, Mike; Robert De Niro is more liberal on certain issues, yet you enjoy his movies regardless. At any rate, our discussion has gone on long enough, as until the film is released everything discussed is more or less speculation. With that, I'm going to end by listing several links which discuss this topic more in depth.</p>

<p>Did you know A Clockwork Orange was so dark that it was originally rated X? Which means if Christopher Nolan is aiming for this type of performance for the Joker, this role is most likely going to be uncomfortably dark and sadistic. A whole new turn for the Batman series and other super hero movies. Which makes The Dark Knight even more desirable to see ASAP. I tell you what, if Heath Ledger gets this role down right, my respect for him as an actor will go up immediatly most likely. What I want from this role is probably what you want; which is something far from the ordinary, and something so dark that you feel his creepiness each time hes on screen. And yes, going back to Mr. Robert Deniro, i respect him greatly as an actor even though hes a left wing extremest. I just put aside politics with him, and which is something maybe i should do with other actors and actresses as well. On the matter of the role for two face, I either want Josh Lucas (who was very good in Poseidon by the way) or Liev Schreiber who was good in The Manchurian Candidate. If Ryan Phillippe is chosen, i wont be upset but disappointed in a way that i know the other two have great potential. It looks like Ryan would be like Christain Bale in the newcomer role, since he really hasnt been in anything noteable. Being that we have much more advanced technology and computer special effects, i want the Two face character to be so horrific looking, that i can barely look at him without gasping. That would really put a spin on the Batman movies even more. You're comment about A Clockwork Orange really has given me a much more better idea on how this movie is going to be, and its most likely going to be great. And by the way, this conversation can go on forever. There is no end to this, we can go over so much other things. But if you want to end it here, well then ok. We can start on a different topic or movie discussion room if you want. Overall, i think Christopher Nolan is part of the reason for keeping super hero movies alive in theaters. Since catastrophy films like Batman and Robin could put an end to super hero movies permenantly. If movies like Spiderman 2 and Batman Begins never came along, we'd probably wouldnt be having this marvel and dc comic movie adaptation frenzy going on right now. So I'd like to thank Mr. Nolan right now for his creativity and genious for the screen. No matter how corny this may be, i still would like to thank him.</p>

<dd>I suppose that if I have anything to say or if I find out anything new I will respond. During a recent interview, Ledger made a similar comment about most pre-Batman Begins, saying that he hates comic book movies having stated that "they bore me sh*tless and they're just dumb. But I thought what Chris Nolan did with Batman was actually really good, really well directed, and Christian Bale was really great in it." Regarding the Joker, he stated; "He's going to be really sinister and it's going to be less about his laugh and his pranks and more about just him being just a f*cking sinister guy." I would suggest that you read it here:(<a href="http://www.moviehole.net/interviews/20060912_exclusive_interview_heath_ledg.html" class="external free" title="http://www.moviehole.net/interviews/20060912_exclusive_interview_heath_ledg.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.moviehole.net/interviews/20060912_exclusive_interview_heath_ledg.html</a>)</dd>

<dd>On a side note, the characterization of the Joker in the Dark Knight is, as I said before, based off the graphic novel <a href="../../../t/h/e/Batman%7E_The_Killing_Joke_3db1.html" title="Batman: The Killing Joke">Batman: The Killing Joke</a>, as well as his first two appearences in the comics back in 1940, in which he was supposedly portrayed as a "straitforward mass murderer" who left his victims' corpses disfigured with exagerrated smiles. The Killing Joke is considered one of the darkest portrayals of the Joker. In it, the Joker shows up at <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Gordon_a1c7.html" title="James Gordon">Commisioner Gordon's</a> home, shoots his daughter at point blank range through the spine, paralizing her, and kidnaps Gordon. He takes him to an abandoned carnival and performs psychological torture on him, primarily consisting of forcing him to look at images of his wounded daughter, his motive being to prove to Batman that under the right circumstances, anyone can become just as mad as the Joker is. This comic also depits the most widely accepted verson of the Joker's origin, in that he started off as an engineer who quit his job in order to become a comedian, only to fail miserably. Desperate to provide for himself and his pregnant wife, he agrees to assist a group of thiefs break cross through his old workplace and rob a building on the other side. During a meeting with the thiefs, the police inform him that his wife and unborn son died in an accedent involving a baby bottle heater. Later, the engineer tries to back out, but the ciminals threaten him into going through with it. The criminals are killed in a shootout with the police, and the engineer jumps into a tank of chemicals in order to excape Batman. When he finally gets washed out a drain, he looks at his reflection in a puddle, which has been disfigured into a clownlike appearence, and finally breaks from the combined stress. 66.24.229.233 22:40, 16 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Wow, i am totally speechless. Do you know anything about Nolan using any ideas from The Killing Joke for the portrayal of The Joker in his movie? Or is he going his own way I wonder. But i hope he uses what you just wrote. I found it interesting on the portrayal of his background life before he became the Joker. Psychological torture and shoot outs sound a little over board for The Joker. We're border lining sadistic and cereal killer now. I guess it never really hit me until now that Nolan is really going to make him dark. Even though you've been telling me repeatively that he was going to be darker, your description and reading the Killing Joke really opened my eyes. My gosh, i have a little fear in me already. If Nolan sticks to this material, we're gonna have ourselves an unbelievably creepy and evil villain; something marvel nor DC never really have tried. Out of curiosity Tim, what would be your opinion on an R rated Batman? I think that wouldnt be good to the fact that all of the younger batman fans couldnt see it then. But im asking you this because The Joker really has a sick background life and sounds really grisley. SThings that could fall under the R Rating category. But i guarentee it will be PG-13. Alright Tim, thanks for that reading. I got a kick out of that one.</p>
<hr />
<p>I highly doubt that Chris Nolan will be using the plot from the Killing Joke, but he will be basing the Joker's personality in part around how he acted in that graphic novel (<a href="http://www.betterthanfudge.com/?p=92500" class="external free" title="http://www.betterthanfudge.com/?p=92500" rel="nofollow">http://www.betterthanfudge.com/?p=92500</a>). You have to admit that Nolan's interpretation of Batman was considerably darker than Tim Burton's, so I see no reason why he won't be doing the same for the Joker. As for your comment that DC and Marvel haven't really tried going that dark, where the films haven't, the comic books certainly have on several occasions. In the comics, the Joker often would exhibit a rather <a href="../../../s/a/d/Sadism.html" title="Sadism">sadistic</a> personality, an example being him recently attempting to kill Batman in front of kidnapped orphans. So psychological torture and shootouts wouldn't be too much darker that the Joker in the conics. As for my opinion on an R rated Batman, I'd have to go with Christian Bale's idea that they should release two versions of the film, a PG-13 and an R (<a href="http://news.softpedia.com/news/Actor-Christian-Bale-wants-an-R-rated-Batman-movie-2813.shtml" class="external free" title="http://news.softpedia.com/news/Actor-Christian-Bale-wants-an-R-rated-Batman-movie-2813.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://news.softpedia.com/news/Actor-Christian-Bale-wants-an-R-rated-Batman-movie-2813.shtml</a>). With that, the producers could get the most people to see it in theaters (with the PG-13, as well as capture the dark mood of the comics (in the R version). 66.24.229.233 22:40, 16 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Alright. So it wont be the adaptation of the killing joke, but it certainly will be very dark like you said. On the matter of the P-13 and R, we actually discussed this in person. And you recall about our "unrated" discussion. Meaning release it in PG-13 and then have an unrated edtion come out on DVD. Either way I'll be happy.

<p>Ok Tim, i agree with you on having one main villain. Too many things going on at one time leaves less time for individual character development. Thus, being a disappointing performance most likely. But i do have to say I wont be complaining when they are all on screen. Just because it will increase the intensity between the charcters and make the movie more fun to watch. Im wondering how they are going to diversify the camera time for each villain in Spiderman 3. Oh, did i spell diversify wrong Mr. Swan? So actually, after saying that aloud, i could go both ways with this one. Give each villain good character development, and i say the more the merrier. Oh jeez, please dont take points off for me spelling merrier wrong Mr. Swan. Since you've made it noticible that you are some English teacher, it seems that some little spelling errors upset you and i should apologize...haha, jeez.</p>
<hr />
<p>Actually, I really <i>didn't</i> care about the spelling error, as I have made quite a few. I just thought that "Cereal killer" should be pointed out, as it brought to mind the image of a guy running through a grocery store stabbing boxes of cereal. It didn't upset me at all, I just thought it was funny and if I were upset I would have pointed out the other irrelevent spelling errors you made. Second, I already said above that I didn't care about the fact that wikipedia guidlines said to sign it, I just figured it would be easier to spot out your comments, but either way I really don't care.

<p>(I should note that this is meant as a continuation of the discussion above, not of the comments regarding signing posts.) Just to make it clear, the actors listed as candidates for Harvey Dent/Two-Face (Josh Lucas, Leiv Shrieber, etc.) are still rumors, and it is entirely possible that someone else may be cast in the role. Also, although this is made clear on the <a href="../../../d/a/r/Dark_Knight_%28film%29_4b11.html" title="Dark Knight (film)">Dark Knight (film)</a> page, I would just like to reinforce that Two-Face will <i>not</i> be an antagonist in the Dark Knight, rather, Harvey Dent will appear as an ally of Batman in this film, and become Two-face in Chris Nolan's third film. It is also rumored that <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penguin_%28comics%29.html" title="Penguin (comics)">the Penguin</a> and <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_Mask_%28comics%29_473e.html" title="Black Mask (comics)">Roman Sionis</a> will appear in the Dark Knight, although as minor villains, much like the mafia don <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carmine_Falcone_1434.html" title="Carmine Falcone">Carmine Falcone</a> and <a href="../../../s/c/a/Scarecrow_%28comics%29.html" title="Scarecrow (comics)">the Scarecrow</a> in Batman Begins.

<dl>
<dd>Personally, I like the idea of only having one major villain in the batman films, partially because it allows the character more screen time to develop. Further, the films that had only one antagonist (Batman Begins, <a href="../../../b/a/t/Batman_%281989_film%29.html" title="Batman (1989 film)">Batman (1989 film)</a>) were generally more accepted by fans than the films with multiple antagonists (<a href="../../../b/a/t/Batman_Forever_1d7b.html" title="Batman Forever">Batman Forever</a>, <a href="../../../b/a/t/Batman_and_Robin_848a.html" title="Batman and Robin">Batman and Robin</a>), although this was mostly due to the acting and overall mood of the films. Still, a small number of the complaints about these films centered around the "bad guys" seemingly competing with each other for screen time. 66.24.229.233 23:50, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The section that described possible future movies was not encyclopedic, it read more like an internet rumor mill written by fans. I have removed all mention of possible actors and plots for movies that have not even begun pre-production. We all know that actors and scripts can change a great deal from concept to finished product and putting these in here at this stage feels too fanboy-ish to me. <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeff_schiller_6670.html" title="User:Jeff schiller">Jeff schiller</a> 18:28, 19 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Not only that, but the timeline in "Begins" is all over the place--the Depression, twenty years later, forty years later, today--which is intentional IMO (and deserves comment in the article) and does serve a valid purpose--but also belies the article's statement that the producers wanted everything in the movie (including the B-mobile) to be as "realistic as possible."--Buckboard 10:23, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">The True Identity of Ra's al Ghul</span></h2>
<p>There seems to be some debate going on about the true identity of Ra's al Ghul - whether Ducard was him all along or whether he was a replacement. This excerpt (from memory) of the second meeting between 'Ducard' and Bruce Wayne may help matters:</p>
<p>WAYNE (confronted with the imposter): You're not Ra's. I watched him die.</p>
<p>DUCARD: But is Ra's al Ghul immortal? Are his methods supernatural?</p>
<p>WAYNE: Or cheap parlour tricks to conceal your real identity?</p>
<p>DUCARD: Surely a man who spends his evening scrambling on the rooftops of Gotham would not begrudge me duel identities.</p>
<p>It seems fairly clear to me that this indicates that Ducard was the real Ra's all along, and that the other two (the Ken Watanabe version and the party version) were just decoys. --<a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoseph_Q_Publique_03c8.html" title="User:Joseph Q Publique">Joseph Q Publique</a> 23:21, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>And in the <i>official</i> film guide book, there is an excerpt from the screenplay in which Liam Neeson's character is speaking and the script actually names him as Ra's al Ghul. Unless someone has conclusive proof that contradicts this, we need to go along with the idea that Henri Ducard was always the real Ra's al Ghul. I think some are changing this based on their own theories, which is original research and therefore verboten. --<a href="../../../b/a/c/User%7EBacteria_a7be.html" title="User:Bacteria">Bacteria</a> 00:19, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I would like for this information to be reviewed and made available somewhere for the benefit of my fellow curious soundtrack collectors (and Latin students), but this article doesn't seem to be the place - unless perhaps certain tracks were individually linked to relevant articles. -<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndromedaRoach_12db.html" title="User:AndromedaRoach">AndromedaRoach</a> 07:00, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You might be overcomplicating it. Just make the correction from "species" to "genus" or "genera".

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Bruce's age?</span></h2>
<p>Where does the information about Bruce's age (in the "Plot" section) come from? It's not sourced, and it's definitely incorrect. Much is made of the notion that Bruce is 24 during the course of the film. The "Casting" section has this to say -</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>Goyer's leaked first draft had him almost turning 30 on return to Gotham from Nepal, making him 22-23 when he is in Gotham for Joe Chill's hearing. However, it was changed to him ending the film at 25 years old to emphasize his youth.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Maybe that was the case at one point during pre-production, but if so they changed it back. Bruce is identified as turning 30 during the film (there is a large sign above the master staircase, seen before his birthday party, to that effect). That means all the references to Bruce's age must be corrected, working backwards.</p>
<p>By my count, given references in the film establishing the Chill hearing as being 14 years after the murder of Bruce's parents, and to Bruce having disappeared for seven years after that hearing, we can conslusively establish this chronology for him:</p>
<p>Bruce was 10 years old when his parents were murdered, 24 when Chill was himself murdered, and 29-turning-30 in the "present."</p>
<p>I'm going to correct the "Plot" section, but can anyone help with the background needed for the "Casting" section? --Chancemichaels 02:40, 13 September 2006 (UTC)Chancemichaels</p>

<dd>Oh, crud. I just noticed an error in my math above. Whoops.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Okay, looking at it again, we have four ages for Bruce Wayne in the film - <b>29-turning-30</b> when he starts his career as Batman (established on-screen during his birthday party), <b>22</b> when the Chill hearing is held, (7 years elapses between the hearing and Bruce's return to Gotham), and finally <b>8</b> when his parents are killed (14 years before the hearing). That also works with "Bruce Wayne - Age 8" in the credits. --Chancemichaels 17:23, 13 September 2006 (UTC)Chancemichaels</dd>

<dd>I don't know; I think that he's in his mid-twenties. Nolan and Goyer probaly made a mistake in the chronogly or something....remember it's year one, he's in his early twenties then. (unsigned)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Beats me, but possibly he could be 25 or 26. It's most likely left up to the viewer to decide. Robin hasn't shown up yet, nor have most of the Rogues Gallery, etc. Believe what you want to believe; I think he;s around mid to late twenties. --<a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonathan.Bruce_9151.html" title="User:Jonathan.Bruce">Jonathan.Bruce</a> Sept 14 2006, 03:38 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's Bruce's first year as Batman, but it's not an adaptation of Miller's "Year One" storyline. If you're the one who reverted my edits without comment, please refrain from doing so again. That's what this page is for, to hash out differences without editing the main article. --Chancemichaels 13:47, 14 September 2006 (UTC)Chancemichaels</dd>

<dd>Oh, no I didn't change your edits at all. Some fool, I guess. Anyways, I don't see what the fuss is about over an absurd topic. Like I said, believe what you want to believe, but if they put him at 30, then there won't be room in the future franchise for Robin, then Nightwing, then Tim Drake, if Batman will be over 40. --<a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonathan.Bruce_9151.html" title="User:Jonathan.Bruce">Jonathan.Bruce</a> 7:47 Sept 14, 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm sorry, but it isn't "left up to the viewer to decide" or a matter of belief. It's <b>explicitly stated</b> in the art direction of the film - Bruce turns 30 the night that Ra's Al Ghul unleashes his toxin on Gotham City. An anonymous poster keeps reverting it without comment and without any justification whatsoever. I don't know why this person keeps trying to replace fact with his opinion, but if he would sign his name to those edits, we could discuss it with him.</dd>

<p>I added a {{<a href="../../../u/n/r/Template%7EUnreferenced_31dd.html" title="Template:Unreferenced">unreferenced</a>}} tag to the article because outside the sections that use the film as a direct source, the article does not cite its sources.

I suggest we use <a href="../../../t/h/e/X-Men%7E_The_Last_Stand_40ad.html" title="X-Men: The Last Stand">X-Men: The Last Stand</a> as an example because it is a similar film, and the article is classified as a Good Article. --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisGriswold_2071.html" title="User:ChrisGriswold">Chris Griswold</a> (<big><a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChrisGriswold_df5d.html" title="User talk:ChrisGriswold"><span style="color:red">☎</span></a><span style="color:black">☓</span></big>) 19:14, 16 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
