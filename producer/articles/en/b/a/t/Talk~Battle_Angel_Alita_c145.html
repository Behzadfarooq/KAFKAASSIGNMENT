<p>Is someone willing to create a Last Order part? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 84.141.54.65 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_84.141.54.65_a099.html" title="Special:Contributions/84.141.54.65">contribs</a>) 09:37, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</small></p>
<p>On the short bio of Kaos, it says "He only sees at infrared wavelengths and hears and speaks at radio wavelengths." Should it be noted that later in the series, after he has his psychological battle with his alter ego, Den, he is once again able to hear/speak/see in a normal way (see fourth chapter of book 9) or would noting this just overcomplicate things at the moment? Does anybody know if the author actually explains why this happens, or why Kaos was like that originally? Also, I've noticed on both this page and the <a href="../../../a/l/i/Alita.html" title="Alita">Alita</a> page that there is a distinct avoidance of major plot spoilers, as in the constant reference to "The Secret of Tiphares" without actually ever stating what that secret is. Would there be any objections to an addition of explanations of these plot points, or to a time table of the future history of the Battle Angel Alita world, as outlined and explained in the most recent Last Order volumes? I was comparing this article to that of <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neon_Genesis_Evangelion_8beb.html" title="Neon Genesis Evangelion">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a>, and the approach to the story/plot summary section is vastly different. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShikan_0944.html" title="User:Shikan">Shikan</a> 06:53, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I say go for it. More info never hurts (I think). I'd only suggest you move the spoiler warning down to whereever you think the really important plot points begin, for emphasis. <a href="../../../s/h/o/User%7EShowdown_edf6.html" title="User:Showdown">Showdown</a> 20:05, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I added pictures of each of the characters, named in the major character section. I removed the "Kaos psychometry picture" and replaced it with the portraits of the major characters, for a more appropriate visual presentation. Bluebanta 06:32, 12 August 2006 (UTC)Bluebanta</p>

<p>Overall</p>
<ul>
<li>Previous talk was archived. Please time stamp your comments and create new sections from now on as necessary.</li>
<li>Cleanup tag removed.</li>
<li>Red links and bolding removed.</li>
<li>Linked <a href="../../../a/l/i/Alita.html" title="Alita">Alita</a>'s name to her page that I created. Check it out&#160;:)</li>
<li>Some structural changes. Needs to sound scholarly, after all.</li>
<li>Characters section added.</li>
<li>Live-action movie section was removed, info added to intro and disambiguated.</li>
<li>An extensive Motorball section will soon be created and either added to the article or linked from the article.</li>
<li>A short themes/motifs section *might* appear. I'll see how relevant it is.</li>
<li>Some images might change over the next few days.</li>
</ul>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>The previous introduction was overly long. The new introduction was based on the wiki entry for <a href="../../../b/l/e/Bleach_%28manga%29.html" title="Bleach (manga)">Bleach</a> which offers a quick summary of release info, then quickly moved to a short synopsis. However, this series has a lot of history, so release information is a lot longer.</p>
<ul>
<li>New picture of Alita for the infobox. I felt it better represented the plot (and looked better).</li>
<li>Criticism of OVA removed.</li>
<li>Info about suspension of Aqua Knight removed.</li>
<li>Info about renaming OVA removed (redundant).</li>
<li>Info about reasons for BAA's continuation removed.</li>
<li>Line about Galatea removed. Might re-add it directly to the <a href="../../../a/l/i/Alita.html" title="Alita">Alita</a> page later.</li>
<li>Short plot synopsis added.</li>
</ul>
<p>Storyline</p>
<p>The storyline is too specific. It needs to be a more holistic view of the manga rather than a detailed summary of volume 1. Alita's origins were kept, but detailed info about the fight with Makaku was removed.</p>
<p>Setting</p>
<p>This section was already very well done. The only thing it could use is a description of Tiphares, which I haven't (yet) added.</p>
<p>Links</p>
<p>I was hesitant to delete much of anything. However, the links were re-ordered and the ones I felt were most relevant are first.</p>

<p>I think Alita could be set in the distant future of what is now known as the US. Having looked at some maps that came with the manga, i can say that there are some strinking similarities between them and actual maps of central US. (e.g. Ruined City = Denver, (where Alita and Figure fought colonel Bozzle's Men), Southern River = Mississippi, Nothern River = Missouri,NORAD mountain = NORAD miliray installation (Colorado)). It seems to me that Tiphares could be located somewhere south of Des Moines (Illinois)and north of Kansas City(Kansas). I could try to get the maps scanned if anyone is interested. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by LaVic (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_LaVic_dbe7.html" title="Special:Contributions/LaVic">contribs</a>) 15:49, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</small></p>

<dd>The question on whether or not is in the US was answered long, long ago. If you look at the GUNNM FAQ (linked in the article), it is explained. <a href="http://www.reimeika.ca/marco/gfaq.html#Q16" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.reimeika.ca/marco/gfaq.html#Q16" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> <a href="../../../e/l/r/User%7EElric_of_Grans_aa53.html" title="User:Elric of Grans">Elric of Grans</a> 04:49, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>i see no section about the Gunnm OVA? it was a 2-episode miniseries or something (it was a long time ago...) based on the first volume. it was pretty cool but sadly only a promo for the comic book (like Berserk). <a href="../../../c/l/i/User%7EClich%C3%A9_Online_466b.html" title="User:Cliché Online">Cliché Online</a> 04:00, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It was not meant to be like Berserk. I seem to recall it being axed due to poor sales, but they had intended to animate the whole story. <a href="../../../e/l/r/User%7EElric_of_Grans_aa53.html" title="User:Elric of Grans">Elric of Grans</a> 22:39, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Shouldn't the Last order manga be entirely separate. The infobox shouldn't be there if it is a spinoff. The film link is a circular link back to the page itself. Those should split to separate articles. If not, at least Cameron's film. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenjwong_5487.html" title="User:Benjwong">Benjwong</a> 17:52, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I started a seperate page for Last Order: <a href="../../../l/a/s/Battle_Angel_Alita%7E_Last_Order_39f7.html" title="Battle Angel Alita: Last Order">Battle Angel Alita: Last Order</a>. I'll expand it later and clean up the main BAA page unless someone else is up to it. I copied the Last Order part of the infobox to the new page for now.</dd>
<dd>HertzaHaeon 03:43, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>if there is now a separate page for Last Order, should all the plot and character information given to us in Last Order be now taken off of <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_Angel_Alita_d49f.html" title="Battle Angel Alita">Battle Angel Alita</a>? <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShikan_0944.html" title="User:Shikan">Shikan</a> 05:15, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I've cleaned up the page a bit now and extended the Last order page. HertzaHaeon 22:31, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I think there should be a split for the upcoming Cameron film as well. According to IMDB the official title is <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_Angel_d41d.html" title="Battle Angel">Battle Angel</a>. It seems logical to use that page for the film. What do you think? HertzaHaeon 22:33, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, apparently there shouldn't be a split for the film yet. I'll put some film info back into the article for now. HertzaHaeon 00:33, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Given that there are so many characters in the Battle Angel universe, I think it would be better for organizational purposes to create a separate article or section called something like "List of characters in Battle Angel" broken down into seperate headings, with either more information on the characters (along the lines of how the Black Lagoon characters are currently organized), or create a link box linking to articles about each of the characters/affiliations (how the Naruto characters are organized). Sample headings could be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hunter-Warriors</li>
<li>Criminals</li>
<li>Barjack</li>
<li>Motorballers (not limited to just players)</li>
<li>Tiphareans</li>
<li>Civilians (Scrapyard residents or not)</li>
</ul>
<p>In this regard, the separate Alita article would be linked to and the section on the TUNED AR series taken out and incorporated into the character section, as it duplicates some of the info given in the Last Order article. Maybe the character section can also reference Last Order characters (because of the overlap), or have a section for just new characters introduced in Last Order. --<a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrokenSphere_f59e.html" title="User:BrokenSphere">BrokenSphere</a> 19:56, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I was thinking about fixing up the Trivia section a bit when something came to mind. I wanna get your guy's opinion on this.</p>
<p>I currently maintain a list of pop-culture references in Battle Angel Alita called <a href="http://www.nick15.com/kudos.html" class="external text" title="http://www.nick15.com/kudos.html" rel="nofollow">the Kudos List</a> (it's also in the Links section). Now I noticed that a lot of the trivia in the Trivia section are on the Kudos list. I also feel a lot of the entries in the Kudos list are Trivia section-worthy. However, I don't want the Trivia section to be overrun with entries; the Kudos list can show much much Trivia there is about the entire series. I was thinking that the Trivia section shouldn't be TOO long, but like, how do you choose what to use and what to leave out, given that there are a lot of choice pieces of Trivia?</p>
<p>Me personally, I think items in the Trivia section should be stuff that AREN'T Kudos list material; it should involve stuff like what happened during the life of the series, what inspired Yukito Kishiro during its run, etc. Maybe it could just general entires like "Kishiro tosses in a lot of heavy metal references", leaving out the specific details and just using the Kudos list or any other source as a Reference. What do you think? -- <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENick15_f3ed.html" title="User:Nick15">Nick15</a> 11:53, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Schwarzenegger as Ido is pure speculation and quite unlikely. I've read the rumors online as well, but that's all there is to it. There are no named sources in the original article and the whole things seems to be based on wishful thinking from Ahnuld fans. Cameron has gone on record to say that Battle Angel will not be a "star vehicle" either. I've removed Arnold from the page for now. HertzaHaeon 20:42, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I propose that the headings of the article are ordedred more logically, keeping the story, characters and setting together, followed by the bits about the different formats and media. If noone has any objections I'll do this cleanup soon. HertzaHaeon 14:52, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
