<p>Vukovar is an important regional centre on the border between Croatia and <a href="../../../s/e/r/Serbia.html" title="Serbia">Serbia</a>, situated on the right bank of the <a href="../../../d/a/n/Danube.html" title="Danube">Danube</a> river. It is a major <a href="../../../r/i/v/River_port.html" title="River port">river port</a> and <a href="../../../c/a/p/Capital.html" title="Capital">capital</a> of what was, before the war, an extremely ethnically mixed area. In the Vukovar <a href="../../../m/u/n/Municipality.html" title="Municipality">municipality</a>, which included the town and surrounding villages, the 1991 census recorded 84,189 inhabitants of which 36,910 were <a href="../../../c/r/o/Croats.html" title="Croats">Croats</a> (43.8%), 31,445 Serbs (37.4%), 1,375 <a href="../../../h/u/n/Hungarians.html" title="Hungarians">Hungarians</a> (1.6%), 6,124 "Yugoslavs" (7.3%), and 8,335 (9.9%) others or undeclared.</p>
<p>The town of Vukovar itself was inhabited by approximately 45,000 people at start of 1991. A small majority (52.98%) of the city's population was reported to be Croats. Serbs constituted 36.28% of the population and other nationalities made up the remainder.<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> Most of the Croats lived in the town centre, while most of the Serbs lived in the town's industrial <a href="../../../s/u/b/Suburb.html" title="Suburb">suburbs</a>. Prior to 1990, though, the town's population was largely integrated, with an unusually high percentage of mixed marriages and people describing themselves as "Yugoslavs" rather than Serbs or Croats.</p>

<p>On <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_25.html" title="June 25">25 June</a> <a href="../../../1/9/9/1991.html" title="1991">1991</a>, Croatia declared independence from the <a href="../../../s/o/c/Socialist_Federal_Republic_of_Yugoslavia_42d4.html" title="Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia">Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia</a>. This was strongly opposed by the country's substantial Serb minority, who took up arms against the Croatian <a href="../../../g/o/v/Government.html" title="Government">government</a> across a wide area of the country. They were supported in their opposition by the Serbian leader <a href="../../../s/l/o/Slobodan_Milo%C5%A1evi%C4%87_0fcd.html" title="Slobodan Milošević">Slobodan Milošević</a> and by the Serb-dominated leadership of the JNA.</p>
<p>At this stage in the Yugoslav conflict, the objectives of Milošević and the JNA were somewhat different. Milošević sought to support the efforts of the <a href="../../../r/e/b/Rebel.html" title="Rebel">rebel</a> Serb communities to secede from an independent Croatia and associate with a Serb-dominated Yugoslavia. The JNA leadership also supported the Serb rebellion but went further, aiming to decisively cripple or overthrow the new Croatian state. According to its former head, <a href="../../../v/e/l/Veljko_Kadijevi%C4%87_2b6f.html" title="Veljko Kadijević">Veljko Kadijević</a>, it planned to advance deep into Croatia, capture the capital <a href="../../../z/a/g/Zagreb.html" title="Zagreb">Zagreb</a> and destroy its armed forces. Having done this, the new Yugoslavia could dictate its western borders, leaving Croatia as a rump state shorn of much of its territory. A key element in this plan was the use of heavy armored forces to capture the Serb-populated region of <a href="../../../e/a/s/Eastern_Slavonia_e9da.html" title="Eastern Slavonia">Eastern Slavonia</a>, and then to advance west from there to Zagreb.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>The region was already in the grip of a long-running political crisis. The leading Croatian <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nationalist.html" title="Nationalist">nationalist</a> party, the <a href="../../../h/d/z/HDZ_226d.html" title="HDZ">HDZ</a>, had little direct influence in the Vukovar municipality, having won none of the area's five parliamentary seats in the 1990 elections. In July <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990.html" title="1990">1990</a>, the Serb-dominated Vukovar Municipal Assembly came into conflict with the seceding Croatian national government when it refused to endorse the controversial new <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constitution_of_Croatia_d349.html" title="Constitution of Croatia">Constitution of Croatia</a>, which downgraded the political status of the country's Serb minority. The assembly was dominated by the <a href="../../../l/e/a/League_of_Communists_of_Croatia_2551.html" title="League of Communists of Croatia">League of Communists of Croatia</a>. A Serb agricultural engineer, <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slavko_Dokmanovi%C4%87_fde6.html" title="Slavko Dokmanović">Slavko Dokmanović</a>, was elected chairman of the assembly.</p>
<p>By the spring of 1991, paramilitary <a href="../../../m/i/l/Militia.html" title="Militia">militias</a> from Serbia proper – reportedly supported by Milošević through the Serbian <a href="../../../i/n/t/Interior_Ministry_fe6f.html" title="Interior Ministry">Interior Ministry</a> (MUP) – had established themselves in a number of localities in Eastern Slavonia. Paramilitaries commanded by <a href="../../../s/e/r/Serbian_Radical_Party_62be.html" title="Serbian Radical Party">Serbian Radical Party</a> leader <a href="../../../v/o/j/Vojislav_%C5%A0e%C5%A1elj_a9fd.html" title="Vojislav Šešelj">Vojislav Šešelj</a> established a base in the Serb-populated suburb of <a href="../../../b/o/r/Borovo_Selo_16df.html" title="Borovo Selo">Borovo Selo</a> on the outskirts of Vukovar. <a href="../../../m/i/l/Militant.html" title="Militant">Militant</a> <a href="../../../p/r/o/Propaganda.html" title="Propaganda">propaganda</a> from both <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belgrade.html" title="Belgrade">Belgrade</a> and Zagreb added to the tension, radicalising many of the local population and encouraging each side to view the other in the worst possible light.

<p>The first casualties at Vukovar came in May 1991, when two Croatian policemen were taken prisoner in Borovo Selo. A detachment of Croatian Interior Ministry (MUP) police was sent in to rescue them on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_2.html" title="May 2">2 May</a> but came under heavy fire, suffering twelve fatalities and another 20 injured. It was widely reported that the bodies of the dead were mutilated and put on display by the paramilitaries. In the wake of the <a href="../../../b/o/r/Borovo_Selo_killings_a6ab.html" title="Borovo Selo killings">Borovo Selo killings</a>, relations between Croats and Serbs worsened sharply and intercommunal attacks took place in a number of other places in Croatia over the following months.<sup id="_ref-little_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-little" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>As the situation in Eastern Slavonia deteriorated, Serb and Croatian paramilitary groups mounted a sporadic campaign of violence and intimidation against each other and against civilians. In Vukovar itself the local militia commander, <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tomislav_Mer%C4%8Dep_3da6.html" title="Tomislav Merčep">Tomislav Merčep</a>, gained a reputation for brutality against local Serbs and was eventually removed from his post by the Croatian government. At least 80 Serb civilians were claimed to have been killed or disappeared in these incidents.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[4]</a></sup> On <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_9.html" title="April 9">9 April</a> <a href="../../../1/9/9/1991.html" title="1991">1991</a>, Dokmanović wrote a dramatic letter to Croatian President <a href="../../../f/r/a/Franjo_Tu%C4%91man_b3e8.html" title="Franjo Tuđman">Franjo Tuđman</a> declaring "that the current situation in Vukovar is extremely critical and threatens to escalate any time into inter-ethnic conflict with possible permanent, tragic and unforeseeable consequences, which is particularly emphasized by [the] increasingly frequent arming of civilian population, which continues and is causing the atmosphere of fear and absolute lack of confidence of the entire population in any government institutions."</p>
<p>In an effort to take control of the situation in Vukovar, the Zagreb government removed the municipal assembly and its chairman from office in July 1991. They were replaced by a government-appointed <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commissioner.html" title="Commissioner">commissioner</a>, Marin Vidić Bili. This further alienated the local Serbs, but Vidić appears to have had little influence on the ground in any case. Throughout July and August 1991, the Croatian government progressively lost control of Eastern Slavonia as paramilitary forces and local Serb militias, often supported by JNA units stationed in the area, expelled government officials and set up <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barricade.html" title="Barricade">barricades</a> and <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minefield.html" title="Minefield">minefields</a>.</p>
<p>The JNA took up positions on the other side of the Danube, and JNA <a href="../../../g/u/n/Gunboat.html" title="Gunboat">gunboats</a> patrolled the river. Sporadic mortar attacks on Vukovar began in July, and long-range <a href="../../../a/r/t/Artillery.html" title="Artillery">artillery</a> attacks began from early August. By the end of August, the population of the city had fallen to around 15,000 people. The remainder comprised a mixture of Croatians, Serbs and other nationalities.<sup id="_ref-little_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-little" title="">[3]</a></sup> Vukovar was by this time largely surrounded by Serb-controlled territory, and from <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_24.html" title="August 24">24 August</a> onwards was subjected to regular shelling and air attacks. There was, however, no attempt as yet to capture it; the fighting consisted principally of intense exchanges of fire between Croatian- and Serb-held territory.<sup id="_ref-CIA_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CIA" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>

<p>By the start of September 1991 the Croatian government had lost control of nearly a third of the country. Its forces were poorly armed and, without access to heavy weapons, were unable to put up effective opposition to its better-armed opponents. The JNA, as the national army of Yugoslavia, was still deployed throughout Croatia and was seen as a major threat to the republic's secession from the Yugoslav federation. It was, however, already seen to be openly acting in support of the Serb rebellion in the <a href="../../../c/r/o/Croatian_Krajina_ad60.html" title="Croatian Krajina">Croatian Krajina</a> and by mid-1991 most Croatians regarded it as a hostile force.</p>
<p>In order to eliminate the threat of the JNA's <a href="../../../g/a/r/Garrison.html" title="Garrison">garrisons</a> and remedy its own lack of heavy weapons, on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_14.html" title="September 14">14 September</a> <a href="../../../1/9/9/1991.html" title="1991">1991</a> the Croatian government launched an attack on JNA garrisons and arms depots throughout government-held territory – an <a href="../../../o/f/f/Offensive.html" title="Offensive">offensive</a> dubbed the "<a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_the_barracks.html" title="Battle of the barracks">Battle of the barracks</a>". They had already been effectively besieged for a couple of months but the Croatian forces had not, up to that point, attempted to capture them. The outcome of the offensive was mixed; some depots were successfully captured, while others were destroyed or evacuated after negotiations. Nonetheless, it enabled the Croatian forces to obtain a large number of heavy weapons, it eliminated a strategic threat to the Croatian rear and it significantly weakened the strength of the JNA.<sup id="_ref-CIA_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CIA" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>Vukovar's JNA barracks, in the southern suburb of Sajmište, was one of those attacked on 14 September. The local Croatian forces were, however, unable to capture it and, in retaliation, chetniks (Serbian paramilitaries) launched a major attack on the southwest of Vukovar from the direction of <a href="../../../n/e/g/Negoslavci.html" title="Negoslavci">Negoslavci</a>. 2,000 residents fled, reporting scores of civilian deaths and mass killings.<sup id="_ref-little_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-little" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>

<p>In response to the "battle of the barracks", the JNA activated its strategic offensive plan. The main element of this was the drive on Eastern Slavonia. The JNA's objectives in the first stage of the battle were to take the Serb-inhabited areas of Eastern Slavonia plus Vukovar, then to progress west via <a href="../../../v/i/n/Vinkovci.html" title="Vinkovci">Vinkovci</a> and <a href="../../../o/s/i/Osijek.html" title="Osijek">Osijek</a> to Zagreb.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_19.html" title="September 19">19 September</a> a huge column of JNA armor left Belgrade; foreign journalists reported that it stretched for nearly 10 km and included at least a hundred tanks, mostly <a href="../../../t/-/5/T-55.html" title="T-55">T-55s</a> and <a href="../../../m/-/8/M-84.html" title="M-84">M-84s</a>, as well as armored personnel carriers and numerous towed heavy artillery pieces. The force crossed the Croatian border on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_20.html" title="September 20">20 September</a>, near the Serbian town of <a href="../../../%C5%A1/i/d/%C5%A0id.html" title="Šid">Šid</a>. Further support was provided by other JNA units, notably the 12th (Novi Sad) Corps, advancing from Serbia's <a href="../../../v/o/j/Vojvodina.html" title="Vojvodina">Vojvodina</a> province.<sup id="_ref-little_3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-little" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>Few problems were experienced in the early days of the campaign, and the JNA took the time to expel non-Serbs from mixed communities en route, such as at <a href="../../../i/l/o/Ilok.html" title="Ilok">Ilok</a>.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[6]</a></sup> Pockets of Croatian defenders outside Vukovar were quickly routed and fell back to Vukovar. The JNA's 1st Guards Mechanised Division quickly reached the town's barracks and lifted the Croatian siege of the facility. They also moved to encircle Vukovar. By <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_30.html" title="September 30">30 September</a> the town was almost completely surrounded; all roads in and out of the town were blocked and the only route in was via a track through a perilously exposed cornfield.<sup id="_ref-Tanner_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Tanner" title="">[7]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-CIA_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CIA" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>During the period of 14th to 20th September, JNA launched some of the largest tank and infantry attacks at the city. One of the major attacks in this period was started on September 18th from the north on Trpinjska cesta; launched by the JNA's 51st <a href="../../../m/e/c/Mechanized.html" title="Mechanized">Mechanized</a> <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brigade.html" title="Brigade">Brigade</a>'s one Mechanized <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battalion.html" title="Battalion">Battalion</a> of about 30 tanks and 30 APCs. These fell into an ambush, and were almost wiped out. As a result, an area where the fighting occured was nicknamed <i>Tank graveyard</i>.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>Vukovar was cut off for a time after the village of Marinci, straddling the route out of the city, was captured on <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_1.html" title="October 1">1 October</a>. Shortly afterwards, Vukovar's deputy commander Mile Dedaković - Jastreb broke out through the Serbian lines to reach <a href="../../../v/i/n/Vinkovci.html" title="Vinkovci">Vinkovci</a>. His place was taken by his deputy Branko Borković (known as "Mladi Jastreb", or Young Hawk). A Croatian <a href="../../../c/o/u/Counter-offensive.html" title="Counter-offensive">counter-offensive</a> was mounted in the second week of October in an effort to break the siege and succeeded in retaking Marinci. However, the counter-offensive was called off by Croatian President Franjo Tuđman, apparently at the urging of <a href="../../../e/u/r/European_Economic_Community_18c5.html" title="European Economic Community">European Economic Community</a> negotiators attempting to obtain a <a href="../../../c/e/a/Ceasefire.html" title="Ceasefire">ceasefire</a>. The pause enabled the JNA's 252nd Armoured Brigade to retake Marinci on <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_14.html" title="October 14">14 October</a> and consolidate the captured territory.<sup id="_ref-Tus_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Tus" title="">[9]</a></sup> Vukovar was now fully besieged.</p>

<p>Vukovar was defended by a force of some 2,000 defenders drawn from local militias, the 204th brigade of the Croatian National Guard (ZNG) and Interior Ministry forces. Although the defenders were routinely castigated as extreme nationalist "<a href="../../../u/s/t/Usta%C5%A1e.html" title="Ustaše">Ustaše</a>" by the Serbian media, they reflected Vukovar's ethnic mix. As many as a third of defenders were said to be non-Croats. They were relatively poorly armed with little heavy weaponry, though they gained some additional weapons following the capture of JNA barracks elsewhere in Croatia.<sup id="_ref-Tus_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Tus" title="">[9]</a></sup> Despite their small numbers and poor weaponry, they were better motivated than their opponents, as [in some instances] their families were located in the town, and they would naturally fight with more vigor and emotion. They also benefited from the defensive advantages offered by urban terrain.<sup id="_ref-Gow_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Gow" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Dedaković and the defenders' <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chief_of_Staff_0860.html" title="Chief of Staff">Chief of Staff</a>, Branko Borković, played a key role in devising defensive tactics that kept the JNA out of Vukovar for a prolonged period of time. They created a unified command structure that created a single brigade from a number of previously disparate elements. Their tactics centred on the creation of an integrated defence system that featured the mining of approach routes, roving anti-tank teams, <a href="../../../s/n/i/Sniper.html" title="Sniper">snipers</a> and heavily fortified defensive strongpoints. This combination was intended to slow down and dissipate JNA attacks to the point where <a href="../../../c/o/u/Counter-attack.html" title="Counter-attack">counter-attacks</a> could force a retreat.</p>

<p>The attacking force was a mixture of JNA soldiers, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conscript.html" title="Conscript">conscripts</a> from the Serbian territorial defence force (<i>teritorialna obrana</i> or TO), chetniks (Serbian nationalist and royalist paramilitaries) and local Serb militiamen. At its largest, it numbered about 36,000 troops.<sup id="_ref-CIA_3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CIA" title="">[5]</a></sup> Although it was in theory far stronger than the Croatian forces and was much better equipped, it suffered from low <a href="../../../m/o/r/Morale.html" title="Morale">morale</a>, poor leadership, and constant <a href="../../../d/e/s/Desertion.html" title="Desertion">desertions</a>, which reduced the strength and capability of many units. Many of the JNA soldiers were not Serbs in the first place, a large number being <a href="../../../b/o/s/Bosniak.html" title="Bosniak">Bosniaks</a> and <a href="../../../k/o/s/Kosovo.html" title="Kosovo">Kosovo</a> ethnic <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albanians.html" title="Albanians">Albanians</a>. By this stage, the non-Serb members of the JNA were not particularly supportive of either Serbian nationalism or the nominal cause of Yugoslav unity. The non-Serb soldiers were distrusted by the Serb-dominated officer corps, and many deserted from a battle in which they felt that they had no stake of their own.</p>
<p>Low morale was a problem for the Serb members of the JNA as well, and desertions and protests were frequent among the largely conscripted force. The war was unpopular at home and the JNA experienced severe problems in mobilizing soldiers for the battle. The Army as a whole struggled to explain adequately what it was fighting for; it was only in October 1991 that its insignia was altered to replace the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communist.html" title="Communist">Communist</a> red star with the Yugoslav tricolor flag, symbolising its shift from Communist to nationalist ideologies.</p>
<p>The attackers also suffered from a persistent lack of coordination between the various groups involved. Even within the JNA, there were problems in establishing a unified chain of command between the different corps and divisions on the battlefield. There were even greater problems in coordinating movements with the Serbian TO militias, Serbian paramilitary groups and the local Croatian Serb militias. The paramilitaries and militias were often poorly organised and indisciplined, often drunk, and soon gained a reputation for considerable brutality. Massive desertions and the casualties suffered by poor organization during the battle led to JNA recruiting people off the streets in Serbia and sending them to the battle zone without any training<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> to be used as <a href="../../../c/a/n/Cannon_fodder.html" title="Cannon fodder">cannon fodder</a>, which only worsened their losses.</p>

<p>From mid-October 1991 to the fall of the city in mid-November, Vukovar was entirely surrounded by JNA and Serbian forces. Its remaining inhabitants – who included several thousand Serbs – took refuge in communal bomb shelters which had been built during the <a href="../../../c/o/l/Cold_War_f6d9.html" title="Cold War">Cold War</a> as insurance against a Soviet invasion. A crisis committee was established, operating from a nuclear bunker underneath the municipal hospital. It organised the delivery of food, water and medical supplies, keeping to a minimum the number of civilians on the streets and ensuring that each <a href="../../../b/o/m/Bomb_shelter.html" title="Bomb shelter">bomb shelter</a> was guarded and had at least one doctor and nurse assigned to it.</p>
<p>The hospital was kept busy dealing with hundreds of wounded people; in the latter half of September, it had received between sixteen and eighty wounded each day, three quarters of them civilians. Despite the building being clearly marked with the <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_Cross_7021.html" title="Red Cross">Red Cross</a> symbol it was shelled and bombed along with the rest of the city. On <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_4.html" title="October 4">4 October</a> the Yugoslav Air Force attacked it, destroying its operating theater. One bomb fell through several floors, failed to explode and landed on the foot of a wounded man, who survived.<sup id="_ref-little_4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-little" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>Despite the attacking forces' numerical superiority and far greater firepower, they were unable to dislodge the Croatian defenders. The JNA's attempts to storm the city were beaten back with heavy losses in manpower and equipment. Its largely conscript force had no training for urban combat and little desire to undertake such dangerous work. They were also ill-equipped for such work – the JNA, like other armies before it, found that its heavy armour was simply not suited for intense <a href="../../../u/r/b/Urban_combat.html" title="Urban combat">urban combat</a>.</p>
<p>Unable to engage the defenders directly, the army instead resorted to intensive long-range artillery <a href="../../../b/o/m/Bombardment.html" title="Bombardment">bombardments</a> supported by occasional Yugoslav Air Force bombing raids. By the end of October, much of Vukovar had been reduced to ruins. Ironically, though, this actually worked to the defenders' advantage; as the <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_Army_ccba.html" title="Red Army">Red Army</a> had found at <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stalingrad.html" title="Stalingrad">Stalingrad</a> fifty years previously, a destroyed city offered far more defensive positions than an intact one.</p>
<p>The poor performance of the JNA had been an unwelcome surprise to the Army's high command in Belgrade, and at the start of October General <a href="../../../%C5%BE/i/v/%C5%BDivota_Pani%C4%87_a545.html" title="Života Panić">Života Panić</a>, the commander of the First Army District, was put in charge of the Vukovar operation. He was accompanied to the <a href="../../../f/r/o/Front_line.html" title="Front line">front lines</a> by the JNA Chief of Staff, <a href="../../../b/l/a/Blagoje_Ad%C5%BEi%C4%87_1f9c.html" title="Blagoje Adžić">Blagoje Adžić</a>. The two men were appalled by what they found - a situation which Panić himself described as "chaos".</p>
<p>Panić swiftly made major changes, integrating the paramilitaries into the JNA command structure and putting in place a single chain of command with himself at the apex. Poorly motivated conscripts were replaced with nationalist Serb volunteers wherever possible.<sup id="_ref-little_5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-little" title="">[3]</a></sup> The Serbian Ministry of the Interior played a crucial role in facilitating this, organising volunteers from Serbian nationalist parties and clubs and sending them to Eastern Slavonia.

Map of the final phase of the Battle of Vukovar</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The battle was finally ended by a JNA objective organised by General Panić in late October 1991. Panić identified the JNA's key weakness as being its inability to carry out a coordinated assault with well-motivated and equipped troops. The Croatian defenders had previously been able to defeat the JNA's disjointed, single-sector attacks but did not have the numbers to defeat a coordinated attack on multiple sectors.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_30.html" title="October 30">30 October</a>, the JNA launched just such an attack with well-trained <a href="../../../i/n/f/Infantry.html" title="Infantry">infantry</a> and engineering troops systematically forcing their way through the Croatian defences, supported rather than led by armour. Paramilitary forces were used to spearhead the assaults. The JNA forces, divided into a northern and southern operation sector, attacked multiple points simultaneously; as predicted, the defenders were unable to repulse such an attack. On <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_3.html" title="November 3">3 November</a> JNA troops launched a successful <a href="../../../a/m/p/Amphibious.html" title="Amphibious">amphibious</a> assault across the Danube to meet up with the Serbian paramilitary "Tigers", led by the notorious <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warlord.html" title="Warlord">warlord</a> <a href="../../../%C5%BE/e/l/%C5%BDeljko_Ra%C5%BEnatovi%C4%87_7793.html" title="Željko Ražnatović">Željko Ražnatović</a> ("Arkan"). This split the Vukovar perimeter in half, isolating a pocket of Croatian defenders in the suburb of Borovo Naselje. Even so, the pocket held out until <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_16.html" title="November 16">16 November</a>.</p>
<p>Further south, the JNA's "Operational Group South" systematically cleared the town centre, isolating the remaining defenders.

<p>Throughout the siege, the international community attempted unsuccessfully to bring the fighting to an end. European Community negotiators repeatedly sought to arrange ceasefires, but neither side observed them; some broke down within hours. By September, some EC members were calling for military intervention by the <a href="../../../w/e/s/Western_European_Union_245c.html" title="Western European Union">Western European Union</a> but this was vetoed by the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>.

The closest either came to actually condemning one or other of the two sides was in a statement issued by the EC on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_12.html" title="November 12">12 November</a> <a href="../../../1/9/9/1991.html" title="1991">1991</a>, in which it condemned the escalation of attacks on Croatian towns by the JNA and Serbian forces.</p>
<p>In terms of international media coverage, there is little doubt that the Serbs were widely portrayed as the villains of the battle. There was no international media presence in Vukovar itself (unlike in the sieges of <a href="../../../s/a/r/Sarajevo.html" title="Sarajevo">Sarajevo</a> and <a href="../../../d/u/b/Dubrovnik.html" title="Dubrovnik">Dubrovnik</a>) and relatively little of the fighting at Vukovar was broadcast to foreign audiences.

<p>Reactions to the battle in Croatia and the rump Yugoslavia varied considerably. Croatians saw the battle for Vukovar as a life-or-death struggle for the survival of their nation, which they compared to the <a href="../../../s/o/v/Soviet_Union_ad1f.html" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a>'s decisive <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Stalingrad_f1b5.html" title="Battle of Stalingrad">Battle of Stalingrad</a>. The aftermath of the battle was marked by controversy over the Croatian government's apparent lack of resolve in dealing with the battle. Two half-hearted relief operations were mounted in October and November but failed to gain any ground. Dedaković and Borković both survived the battle and spoke out publicly against the government's actions. In an apparent attempt to silence them, both men were briefly detained by Croatian military police.</p>
<p>From a strictly military point of view, however, there was little to be gained from a Croatian counter-offensive. The battle of Vukovar had broken the back of the JNA offensive. The town itself was strategically expendable and was, in any case, probably indefensible. It was virtually surrounded by Serb-held settlements and overlooked Serbia itself, from where it could be (and was) bombarded and assaulted. Although the Croatian government undoubtedly felt the sting of defeat at Vukovar, in a strategic context the damage and delays inflicted on the JNA more than made up for the loss of the town.<sup id="_ref-CIA_6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CIA" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>

<p>The high number of casualties incurred in the battle caused serious popular discontent in Serbia and <a href="../../../m/o/n/Montenegro.html" title="Montenegro">Montenegro</a>, where tens of thousands of those receiving <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conscription.html" title="Conscription">draft</a> papers went into hiding or left the country.

In one famous incident, a tank driver named Vladimir Zivković drove his tank all the way from the front line at Vukovar to the federal <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parliament.html" title="Parliament">parliament</a> in Belgrade. Many Serbs simply did not identify with the Croatian Serb cause and were unwilling to see their lives, or those of their children, sacrificed at Vukovar.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[12]</a></sup> Although the great majority of JNA casualties were Serbian, Serbia itself was never formally at war.</p>
<p>In a sign of the popular distaste for the battle, the JNA's attempts to draft further troops for a deeper attack into Croatia failed dismally. Only 13% of those eligible for the draft actually reported for duty, and by the end of 1991 six thousand cases against deserters and <a href="../../../d/r/a/Draft-dodger.html" title="Draft-dodger">draft-dodgers</a> were pending in Belgrade's <a href="../../../m/i/l/Military_court.html" title="Military court">military court</a> alone.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[13]</a></sup> The failure of the draft meant that large elements of the JNA's planned offensive into Croatia had to be abandoned for simple lack of manpower.</p>

<p>The aftermath of the battle was dominated by two principal issues: the JNA's ongoing campaign in Croatia and the fate of the non-Serbs left in Vukovar when the town fell.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Vukovar_2d8e.html" title="Edit section: The end of the campaign">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The end of the campaign</span></h3>
<p>The three-month siege tied down some of the best units the Yugoslav Army had, including 2 Tank and 6 Mechanized brigades in the wider area - substantial part of the Army's tank assault force - which eased the pressure on other fronts in Croatia. This three-month pause, during which the JNA was concentrating on defeating just one Croatian brigade, enabled Croatia to complete the mobilization started in October. As a result: when the battle of Vukovar begun, Croatian Army had less than 20 infantry brigades, which rose to about 60 when it was over.</p>
<p>The JNA's General Panić was determined to carry forward the JNA's long-delayed advance into Croatia following the fall of Vukovar. After the battle had ended he moved most of his forces forward toward Osijek, the JNA's next strategic target. Vukovar itself was largely left in the hands of paramilitaries. Osijek was, however, a far tougher target than Vukovar. It was a much bigger city, with three times Vukovar's population; it was much better defended; it had better lines of communication with the rest of Croatia than Vukovar had enjoyed; and the JNA itself was a depleted force in the aftermath of the battle of Vukovar. Furthermore, Croatian forces were now better equipped than they had been at the start of the offensive, thanks to the capture of JNA supplies from former federal depots.</p>
<p>Osijek was subjected to intensive shelling in preparation for a planned assault but at this point, Serbia's Slobodan Milošević intervened. The JNA had by now captured most of the Serb-inhabited regions of Croatia and Milošević had little interest in taking predominantly Croatian-inhabited territory, much less in Panić's goal of toppling the Zagreb government and putting Croatia under <a href="../../../m/i/l/Military_occupation.html" title="Military occupation">military occupation</a>. Moreover, the ongoing war was causing serious political difficulties in Serbia. After Milošević compelled the JNA high command to order Panić to end his operations, ceasefire talks between Serbia and Croatia were opened under the mediation of UN envoy <a href="../../../c/y/r/Cyrus_Vance_7f31.html" title="Cyrus Vance">Cyrus Vance</a>. In January 1992, an <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armistice.html" title="Armistice">armistice</a> was agreed, temporarily ending the fighting in Croatia.<sup id="_ref-CIA_7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CIA" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>

<p>The fate of those captured at Vukovar – both military and civilians – was grim. Many appear to have been summarily executed by Serbian paramilitaries; journalists visiting the town immediately after its fall reported seeing the streets strewn with bodies in civilian clothes. <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_a61d.html" title="BBC">BBC</a> television reporters recorded Serbian paramilitaries chanting "<i>Slobodane, Slobodane, šalji nam salate, biće mesa, biće mesa, klaćemo Hrvate!</i>" ("Slobodan [Milošević], Slobodan, send us some salad, [for] there will be meat, there will be meat, we will butcher the Croats").<sup id="_ref-Tanner_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Tanner" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>The defenders of the northern pocket of Borovo Naselje were unable to escape and most are reported to have been killed.<sup id="_ref-Tus_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Tus" title="">[9]</a></sup> Many of the defenders of Vukovar proper were also killed although some, including the commanders, successfully broke through JNA lines and escaped to government-held territory. Of the non-Serb civilian survivors, most were expelled to government-held territory but around 800 of the men of fighting age (civilians and captured soldiers alike) were imprisoned in Serbian prisons at <a href="../../../s/r/e/Sremska_Mitrovica_94ce.html" title="Sremska Mitrovica">Sremska Mitrovica</a> and elsewhere. Although most were eventually freed in prisoner exchanges, some reportedly died after being tortured.</p>
<p>Many of the Croatians in the Vukovar hospital (around 260 people plus several medical personnel) were taken by JNA and Serb paramilitary forces to the nearby field of <a href="../../../o/v/%C4%8D/Ov%C4%8Dara.html" title="Ovčara">Ovčara</a> and executed.

<p>The Serbian chetniks (paramilitary) leader Vojislav Šešelj has been indicted on a variety of war crimes charges including several counts of <a href="../../../e/x/t/Extermination.html" title="Extermination">extermination</a> in relation to the Vukovar hospital massacre, in which his "White Eagles" were allegedly involved.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[16]</a></sup> In addition, Croatia has tried a number of Serbs for war crimes committed at Vukovar – although most of the original indictees either died before they could be tried, or had to be tried <i>in absentia</i><sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[17]</a></sup> – and in December 2005 a Serbian court convicted fourteen former paramilitaries for their involvement in the hospital massacre.<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[18]</a></sup></p>
<p>Although the initial attack on Vukovar has not been the subject of war crimes charges, the ICTY's indictment of Slobodan Milošević characterised the overall JNA/Serb offensive in Croatia – including the fighting in Eastern Slavonia – as a "joint criminal enterprise" to remove non-Serb populations from Serb-inhabited areas of Croatia.

<p>By the end of 1991, the official figures issued in Croatia showed that approximately 3,210 Croats were killed and 17,393 people injured during the conflict. Most of the casualties resulted from the siege of Vukovar. <a href="http://carbon.cudenver.edu/public/fwc/Issue3/croatia-2.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://carbon.cudenver.edu/public/fwc/Issue3/croatia-2.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> The exact numbers of casualties at Vukovar is still unknown.

<p>According to Croatian general Anton Tus, about 1,100 of Vukovar's defenders were killed, 2,600 defenders and civilians were listed as missing, and another 1,000 Croatian soldiers were killed on the approaches to Vinkovci and Osijek.

<p>Estimates of JNA losses are complicated by a lack of official figures. Former commander of the Novi Sad Corps, pensioned general Andrija Biorcevic, could not remember how many people he lost, but he said that he believed that it was not more than 1,500 killed. Biorcevic explained that during the siege of Vukovar, "most of the combat activities took place from a distance and from well <a href="../../../t/r/e/Trench_warfare.html" title="Trench warfare">entrenched positions</a>". <a href="http://mediafilter.org/Monitor/Mon.55-56/Mon.55-56.Vreme4.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://mediafilter.org/Monitor/Mon.55-56/Mon.55-56.Vreme4.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></p>
