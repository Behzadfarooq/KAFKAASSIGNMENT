<p>Originally in the comic books, Batman drove only a simple red automobile with nothing special in its functions. The car's design gradually evolved. It became a "specially built high-powered auto" by <i><a href="../../../d/e/t/Detective_Comics_f034.html" title="Detective Comics">Detective</a> #30</i>, and in <i><a href="../../../b/a/t/Batman_%28comic_book%29.html" title="Batman (comic book)">Batman</a> #5</i> it began featuring an ever-larger bat <a href="../../../h/o/o/Hood_ornament.html" title="Hood ornament">hood ornament</a> and an ever-darker paint job.</p>

<p>Although vehicles for the Batman films have been custom built for the purpose, perhaps the most famous Batmobile, the one from the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Batman_%28TV_series%29_0877.html" title="Batman (TV series)">1966-1968 live action television show</a>, began life as a <a href="../../../c/o/n/Concept_car.html" title="Concept car">Ford concept car</a> called the <a href="../../../l/i/n/Lincoln_Futura_a2a1.html" title="Lincoln Futura">Lincoln Futura</a>, built over a decade earlier in 1955. The body of the Futura was fabricated by Ghia of Italy, whose artisans hammered the car's panels over logs and tree stumps carved as forms to create the sleek manta ray-like car. In 1959, the Futura was featured sporting a fresh red paint job in the film, "It Started With A Kiss", starring Debbie Reynolds and Glenn Ford. In 1965, ABC-TV chose famed Hollywood customizer <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Barris_%28auto_customizer%29_28e3.html" title="George Barris (auto customizer)">George Barris</a> to design a "Batmobile" for their soon-to-go-into production BATMAN show. With only three weeks, Barris decided that rather than build a car from scratch, it would be best to transform the Lincoln Futura (bought from Ford for $1.00) into the famous crimefighting vehicle of TV's caped crusader. Barris hired Bill Cushenberry to do the metal modifications to the car. When filming for the series began, several problems arose due to the age of the car: the steering rack snapped constantly, it overheated, the battery went dead, it had engine problems, and the expensive Mickey Thompson tires kept blowing. By mid season, the transmission and the chassis were replaced with a <a href="../../../f/o/r/Ford_Galaxie_1f19.html" title="Ford Galaxie">Ford Galaxie</a>.</p>
<p>Barris built three fiberglass copies of the original Batmobile for exhibition on the car show circuit (one of which was used for exhibition drag racing). Eventually, the three copies were covered with a black velvet "fuzz" paint, presumably to hide stress cracks in the fiberglass bodies. Later, all three were restored to their gloss black paint job. The 3 replicas are all based on a 1965-1966 Ford Galaxie. Barris has retained ownership of the original TV car, which is currently on display at the <a href="../../../p/e/t/Petersen_Automotive_Museum_0897.html" title="Petersen Automotive Museum">Petersen Automotive Museum</a> in Los Angeles, California. The three Barris copies all reside in private collections.</p>
<p>According to <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Sun_e3a1.html" title="The Sun">The Sun</a>, one of these three Batmobiles will go on sale by Coys Auctions on the 27th of February at the Royal Horticultural Hall in London. Coys Auctions says it expects that the car is likely to fetch more than £75,000.</p>

<p>Later versions of the famed Batmobile would be built off the stretched-out platforms of other cars, such as the <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chevrolet_Caprice_a066.html" title="Chevrolet Caprice">Chevrolet Caprice</a> and <a href="../../../b/u/i/Buick_Riviera_f8c8.html" title="Buick Riviera">Buick Riviera</a>. This style was used in the two <i>Batman</i> films directed by <a href="../../../t/i/m/Tim_Burton_a41c.html" title="Tim Burton">Tim Burton</a>. Reputedly, every gadget seen on the Batmobile used in these films was fully functional, including the jet engine, which consumed fuel at such a high rate that there was only enough fuel capacity to run it for the approximately fifteen seconds of the longest shot in which you can see it operating. This version of the Batmobile was later seen in the <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/Lois_%26_Clark%7E_The_New_Adventures_of_Superman_11ed.html" title="Lois &amp; Clark: The New Adventures of Superman">Lois &amp; Clark: The New Adventures of Superman</a></i> episode called "Don't Tug On Superman's Cape," an episode which shows that some collectors had apparently stolen the Batmobile. This would explain why a new Batmobile replaced the old one in <i><a href="../../../b/a/t/Batman_Forever_1d7b.html" title="Batman Forever">Batman Forever</a></i>.</p>
<p>This long, sleek design was later adapted for <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/Batman%7E_The_Animated_Series_3563.html" title="Batman: The Animated Series">Batman: The Animated Series</a></i>, wherein the vehicle was a long, low machine inspired by <a href="../../../a/r/t/Art_Deco_3600.html" title="Art Deco">art deco</a> design style of the film series. As the <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990s.html" title="1990s">1990s</a> Batman films were handed over to director <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joel_Schumacher_bb0d.html" title="Joel Schumacher">Joel Schumacher</a>, the design for the Batmobile became increasingly implausible, as decorative lighting was added to the vehicle's rims and front edge, and the wing-shaped fins reached further into the air. <i><a href="../../../b/a/t/Batman_Forever_1d7b.html" title="Batman Forever">Batman Forever</a></i> was originally supposed to have a Batmobile designed by famed designer <a href="../../../h/2E/_/H._R._Giger_95c5.html" title="H. R. Giger">H. R. Giger</a>, but Giger backed out of the project when <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warner_Bros._b6cc.html" title="Warner Bros.">Warner Brothers</a> rejected his design.</p>
<p>The animated series <i><a href="../../../b/a/t/Batman_Beyond_1992.html" title="Batman Beyond">Batman Beyond</a></i> had a flying vehicle referred to as the Batmobile (in the show's future era, flying cars had become commonplace).</p>
<p>In the <i><a href="../../../h/u/s/Batman%7E_Hush_87ff.html" title="Batman: Hush">Batman: Hush</a></i> storyline, a splash page by <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jim_Lee_639e.html" title="Jim Lee">Jim Lee</a> shows all the previous Batmobiles (from comics, movies, and all TV series) in storage in the Batcave. A sample of dialogue between Batman and <a href="../../../d/i/c/Dick_Grayson_3d69.html" title="Dick Grayson">Nightwing</a> supports this point: <i>Batman: "We'll take the car." Nightwing: "O.K. Which one?"</i> In addition, some incarnations of the character, such as <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/Batman%7E_The_Animated_Series_3563.html" title="Batman: The Animated Series">Batman: The Animated Series</a></i>, establish that Batman has a large ground vehicle fleet of various makes and models as well as <a href="../../../u/t/i/Utility_vehicle.html" title="Utility vehicle">utility vehicles</a> to use when the Batmobile would be too conspicuous.</p>
<p>A collection of original Batmobiles are on display at the <a href="../../../c/a/r/Cars_of_the_Stars_Motor_Museum_e288.html" title="Cars of the Stars Motor Museum">Cars of the Stars Motor Museum</a> located in <a href="../../../k/e/s/Keswick%2C_Cumbria_9f07.html" title="Keswick, Cumbria">Keswick</a>, northern <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a>. A Batmobile from Batman Forever can also been seen on the Warner Bros. VIP Studio Tour.

<p>The Batmobile depicted in the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a> film <i><a href="../../../b/a/t/Batman_Begins_16f4.html" title="Batman Begins">Batman Begins</a></i> owes more to the tank-like vehicle from <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frank_Miller_%28comics%29_863f.html" title="Frank Miller (comics)">Frank Miller</a>'s <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/Batman%7E_The_Dark_Knight_Returns_5b08.html" title="Batman: The Dark Knight Returns">Batman: The Dark Knight Returns</a></i> than to the sleek automobiles seen in previous incarnations. The film's <a href="../../../p/r/o/Production_designer.html" title="Production designer">production designer</a> described the machine as being a cross between a <a href="../../../l/a/m/Lamborghini.html" title="Lamborghini">Lamborghini</a> and a <a href="../../../h/u/m/Hummer.html" title="Hummer">Hummer</a>. In that film, <a href="../../../b/r/u/Bruce_Wayne_68b8.html" title="Bruce Wayne">Bruce Wayne</a> modifies a military vehicle known as the Tumbler, and the vehicle that he creates is never referred to as the "Batmobile." When Batman asks Gordon to aid him in stopping Ra's al Ghul, he asks "can you drive a stick?". However, in the various interior sequences of the Batmobile/Tumbler being driven, it appears to drive not like a manual transmission automobile, but rather, a boat, based on throttle placement, use, and construction. Six individual Batmobiles were built for filming in the movie, each with a special purpose to meet the various stunt needs of the film: two regular, full-size driving Batmobiles for exterior shots; one full-size model with hydraulics for the jump sequences; one full-size functional vehicle with propane tanks to fuel the rocket blast out of the rear nozzle and a 1/3-scale radio-controlled electric model for the most involved stunts in the film (e.g. the roof-top chase sequence). These scenes were filmed on a massive set built on a stage at <a href="../../../s/h/e/Shepperton_Studios_7bdc.html" title="Shepperton Studios">Shepperton Studios</a> over the course of 9 weeks.</p>

<p>In the animated series <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Batman_%28TV_series%29_9fb6.html" title="The Batman (TV series)">The Batman</a></i>, the Batmobile resembled a sports coupe with multiple jet exhaust slits protruding from the back bumper.

This Batmobile was longer and had a lower profile with only one triangular jet exhaust coming from the rear of the car. At the end of the episode, Batman remarks that due to the <i>Batmobile EXP's</i> success, it's a "keeper".
