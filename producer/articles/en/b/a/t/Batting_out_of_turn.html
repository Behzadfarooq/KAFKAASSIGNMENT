<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/t/Batting_out_of_turn.html" title="Edit section: Determining the proper batter">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Determining the proper batter</span></h2>
<p>At any time, the proper batter is simply the player whose name follows the previous actual batter in the written batting order. Any batter's out-of-turn but completed <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plate_appearance.html" title="Plate appearance">plate appearance</a> is legalized when a pitch is thrown to any subsequent batter on either team. Thus, in order to determine who is the proper batter at any given time, it is necessary only to consider the last two batters who have received a pitch.</p>
<p>When an improper batter is legalized by a pitch to a subsequent batter, the written order does not change. The next time that position comes up in the batting order, the proper, written order should be followed.</p>
<p><a name="Penalty" id="Penalty"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/t/Batting_out_of_turn.html" title="Edit section: Penalty">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Penalty</span></h2>
<p>If an infraction is discovered immediately after a batter completes his appearance, then the umpire considers that batter and the previous one. If the batter who just finished batting does not follow the previous batter in the written order, his plate appearance was improper, any advances or scores due to his action are nullified, he is removed from the bases if he reached, and the proper batter is called <a href="../../../o/u/t/Out_%28baseball%29.html" title="Out (baseball)">out</a>. Outs made against runners other than the improper batter stand. (Please explain the sentence just before the remark you are reading. If the improper batter has hit into a double or triple play, that play should be nullified if the other team appeals immediately -- although the other team would be likely to say nothing in such a case, thus letting the double or triple play stand.)</p>
<p>If the infraction is discovered during a plate appearance (that is, a pitch has been thrown to the current batter), then the umpire considers the current batter and the previous one. If the current batter's name does not follow the previous actual batter's name in the written order, the current batter is improper. There is no penalty, but the situation is rectified--the proper batter comes to bat and assumes the improper batter's current count. In this situation, if the proper batter is on base, then he is simply skipped in the order, and the next batter in the order is now the proper batter.</p>
<p><a name="Example_situations" id="Example_situations"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/t/Batting_out_of_turn.html" title="Edit section: Example situations">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Example situations</span></h2>
<p>Suppose the batting order is: Abel, Baker, Charles, Daniel, Edward, Frank, George, Hooker, Irwin.</p>
<p><a name="Example:_A_proper_batter_fails_to_bat_and_is_called_out" id="Example:_A_proper_batter_fails_to_bat_and_is_called_out"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/t/Batting_out_of_turn.html" title="Edit section: Example: A proper batter fails to bat and is called out">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Example: A proper batter fails to bat and is called out</span></h3>
<p>Abel bats and is put out. Charles then bats out of turn. Charles makes a safe hit, reaching first base. Before any pitch is thrown to the next batter, a member of the defensive team asks the umpire to make a ruling. RULING: The proper batter after Abel was Baker, not Charles. Charles is removed from the bases, Baker is called out for failing to bat in his turn, and Charles comes to bat as the proper batter.</p>
<p><a name="Example:_An_improper_batter_is_legalized" id="Example:_An_improper_batter_is_legalized"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/t/Batting_out_of_turn.html" title="Edit section: Example: An improper batter is legalized">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Example: An improper batter is legalized</span></h3>
<p>Abel bats and is put out. Charles then bats out of turn. Charles makes a safe hit, reaching first base. Baker then comes to bat. A strike is pitched to Baker. A member of the defensive team then asks the umpire to make a ruling regarding the improper batting order. RULING: The first pitch to Baker made Charles's turn legal. The proper batter after Charles is Daniel, not Baker. Without penalty, Daniel comes to bat and assumes that one-strike count.</p>
<p><a name="Example:_An_improper_batter_causes_an_out_after_a_previous_improper_batter_was_legalized" id="Example:_An_improper_batter_causes_an_out_after_a_previous_improper_batter_was_legalized"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/t/Batting_out_of_turn.html" title="Edit section: Example: An improper batter causes an out after a previous improper batter was legalized">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Example: An improper batter causes an out after a previous improper batter was legalized</span></h3>
<p>Abel bats and is put out. Edward then bats out of turn. Edward reaches first base, and Charles then comes to bat and reaches base. The infraction is discovered by the defensive manager before a pitch is thrown to any subsequent batter, and it is reported to the umpire at that time. RULING: Edward did bat out of turn, but the first pitch to Charles legalized Edward's plate appearance. Therefore, the proper batter after Edward is Frank, so Charles is removed from the bases, Edward is returned to first base, Frank is called out for failing to bat in his proper turn, and George is now the proper batter.</p>
<p><a name="Example:_The_proper_batter_is_skipped" id="Example:_The_proper_batter_is_skipped"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/t/Batting_out_of_turn.html" title="Edit section: Example: The proper batter is skipped">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Example: The proper batter is skipped</span></h3>
<p>Suppose that Charles often bats second but was written as the third batter for this game. Abel bats and is put out. Charles then bats out of turn and makes a safe hit, reaching first base. Baker then bats out of turn and receives a base on balls, advancing Charles to second base. Edward then comes to bat and takes a strike. The defense then appeals to the umpire. RULING: The first pitch to Edward legalized Baker's turn at bat. The proper batter after Baker is Charles, but he is on base, so he is skipped in the order; thus Daniel is now the proper batter. There is no penalty; Daniel comes to bat and assumes the one strike Edward received.</p>
<p>In this example, you will notice that the umpire ignores the fact that Charles previously batted out of turn. This underscores the principle that any pitch legalizes all previous turns at bat. Charles's turn at bat became legal when a pitch was thrown to Baker. The umpire need consider only Baker and Edward, the last two batters who have received a pitch.</p>
<p><a name="Example:_Substitutions_and_batting_out_of_turn" id="Example:_Substitutions_and_batting_out_of_turn"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/t/Batting_out_of_turn.html" title="Edit section: Example: Substitutions and batting out of turn">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Example: Substitutions and batting out of turn</span></h3>
<p>When a substitute enters the game, he takes the written spot of the player whom he replaces. Suppose that George bats and is put out, then a <a href="../../../p/i/n/Pinch_hitter.html" title="Pinch hitter">pinch hitter</a>, Stephen, comes to bat. Stephen (a) reports that he is batting for Irwin, or (b) doesn't report. Stephen hits safely and reaches first base. Hooker then comes to bat and hits safely, advancing Stephen. The defense appeals to the umpire that batter was out of turn.</p>
<p>RULING: In (a), Stephen's name replaces Irwin in the batting order. The first pitch to Hooker legalized Stephen's turn at bat. The proper batter after Stephen is Abel. Thus Hooker is removed from the bases for being an improper batter; Stephen returns to first base; Abel is called out for failing to bat in turn, and the proper batter is now Baker.</p>
<p>In (b), since Stephen did not report as a substitute, he legally enters the game in the place of the proper batter. Stephen's name thus replaces Hooker in the order, and Hooker is out of the game. Since Hooker was not in the game when he came to bat, he was an illegal substitute and not a batter out of turn. The penalty for this infraction is not related to batting out of turn; it is an illegal substitution.</p>
