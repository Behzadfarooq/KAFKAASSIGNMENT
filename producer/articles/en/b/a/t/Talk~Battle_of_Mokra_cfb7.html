<p>Idiotic phrases as "armoured detachment" and "mounted artillery detachment" have been changed to "armoured battalion" and "mounted artillery battalion", respectively. The Polish word "dywizjon" should be translated as "battalion", not "detachment". Look guys, it's 1/4-1/3 of artillery/armoured regiment, while detachment is simply "oddział"</p>
<p>Musashi.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Look whom we have here! Thanks for the feedback, Musashi, I really appreciate your comments. As to specific issues you raised - there is a serious problem in translating the Polish military terms to English. The very word <i>dywizjon</i> is really problematic, as it might mean basically anything, from unit, through detachment, command, air wing, detached group, flotilla, battalion, half of battalion or any other small unit. It all depends on the context. So, in other words, an artillery <i>dywizjon</i> might indeed be <i>artillery battalion</i>, while an armoured <i>dywizjon</i> might be much, much smaller than actual armoured battalion. Hence my translation. <a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalibutt_9a46.html" title="User:Halibutt">Halibu</a><a href="../../../h/a/l/User_talk%7EHalibutt_5cbf.html" title="User talk:Halibutt">tt</a> 11:24, 27 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I would like someone to find a source for the following that I edited out of the page:</p>
<p>"...Polish positions in order to disrupt the Polish defence and use the civilians as <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human_shield.html" title="Human shield">human shields</a> for the advancing towns. However, lack of coordination between advancing German forces allowed for the Polish reconnaissance squadrons to direct the fleeing civilians further southwards, towards the town of Kłobuck."</p>
<p>now, can anyone prove that indeed the Germans planned to use the civilians as human shields? is there a combat report that has an outline of the German Commander's combat briefing for the morning, wherein he orders for the units to advance close behind the refugees.</p>
<p>The problem I see with this is that it claims the Germans were evil devils. It also assumes that the Germans failed to coordinate, instead of the fact that maybe they waited until the civilians were clear of the combat area before attacking. It was common practise to remove the civilians from a combat area in order to ensure their safety. Now, why would these Polish refugees go into Germany? this is the first day of the attack, and there is no polish land behind them to seek refuge in, they can only go in one direction, which is in the direction of Polish forces.</p>

<dd>Certainly a source for such controversial information must be provided. I looked briefly on Google and Google Print, but could find no sources about use of human shields in this battle (although it's possible it may be in sources not online/Polish - not covered by Google Print yet). On a related note, I found a reference for use of human shields by German troops during the Warsaw Uprising: <a href="http://books.google.com/books?ie=UTF-8&amp;vid=ISBN1841764167&amp;id=qYG7k15nal0C&amp;pg=PT59&amp;lpg=PT59&amp;dq=%22human+shields%22+Polish&amp;sig=n8pSwVRBFV-4NaHE-9_KSLlzEw4" class="external autonumber" title="http://books.google.com/books?ie=UTF-8&amp;vid=ISBN1841764167&amp;id=qYG7k15nal0C&amp;pg=PT59&amp;lpg=PT59&amp;dq=%22human+shields%22+Polish&amp;sig=n8pSwVRBFV-4NaHE-9_KSLlzEw4" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. --<a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPiotrus_27db.html" title="User:Piotrus">Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus</a> <sup><a href="../../../p/i/o/User_talk%7EPiotrus_217f.html" title="User talk:Piotrus"><font color="green">Talk</font></a></sup> 05:18, 19 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>If no sources can be given to unequivocally say that the Germans used them as human sheilds, the book <b>Panzer Commander: the memoirs of Colonel Hans von Luck</b> is very useful in that he describes what I believe is the same action (although he doesn't state the location I think) but the description of the location is almost identical, and can be used to discount this slanderous accusation against the German forces.</p>

<dd>Sure. Hitler was innocent and was never tried. Same for von dem Bach, and many others. Eichmann's trial was not free either, so he was innocent as well. Long live the application of modern law standards to historical war crimes. Nobody ever tried anyone for <a href="../../../n/e/m/Nemmersdorf.html" title="Nemmersdorf">Nemmersdorf</a>, so it did not happen.

<p>do you actually think before you type?

<p>You assumed that simply because Hans von Luck was German he committed war crimes, and covered them up in his war memoirs. It isnt even clear in this case if a crime was even committed. how can you charge someone with a crime that you cannot clearly varify has happened? --<a href="../../../j/a/d/User%7EJadger_b81c.html" title="User:Jadger">Jadger</a> 14:56, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Either you got my comment wrong, or I did get yours wrong, or both. You stated that the crime did not happen because it is not mentioned in von Luck's memoirs. I stated that it's not yet a proof as the Bible does not mention the crime either, yet it does not mean it did not happen. Then we went into the <i>innocent until proven</i> thing. Besides, I do not charge anyone, nor did I refer to von Luck personally, I don't believe I ever even heard of him. Which does not change a single thing here. There is a source to say the Germans used living shields and there are no sources so far disputing that.

<p>well, my point was that since it was an unreferenced and controversial point in the article, it should not be used. especially when a man fighting in the action describes the attack and never mentions something as major as forcing Polish civilians to run in front of tanks. Now where is this source you claim proves that human shields were used, this has been removed from numerous articles claiming the same thing, and it has not been reverted yet (it has been many months since I removed it), no one has ever had something to say about it, except of course Molobo, or as he is more commonly known, Trollobo. --<a href="../../../j/a/d/User%7EJadger_b81c.html" title="User:Jadger">Jadger</a> 03:03, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>it is not cited in the article, hence the {{fact}} tag in the article. And that link you provided is hardly credible, not only does it have tonnes of ad popups on the opening page, but its links to "Top 100 military sites" are fakes, when clicked on it says "tricked into coming here? enter without voting". the site is not even slightly credible in the least bit, it tries to solicit your vote to make it a credible site with lots of adverts. when looking for credible cites to research from, one does not classify one that solicits your vote and annoys one with popups as a credible one</dd>

<p>Wouldn't it be more appropriate to get rid of the mention of Silesia? Mokra is not geographically in Silesia, it is simply in the Silesian Voivodship, but a few dozen kilometers from what is geographically, historically and linguistically known as Silesia (Śląsk). I'll check for a more apropriate geographical term. <a href="../../../a/r/c/User%7EArczi_b28a.html" title="User:Arczi">arczi</a> 23:32, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Geographically Mokra belongs to <i><a href="../../../w/i/e/Wielu%C5%84.html" title="Wieluń">Wieluń</a> Uplands</i> (<i>wyżyna wieluńska</i> in Polish), but that term is fairly unknown even in Poland. What's more, the area of Częstochowa does not belong to any specifically-designed historical region as it changed hands quite often. It's a part of the Kraków-Częstochowa Upland, but also a part of historical Silesia and even at times of Greater Poland (sic!). Besides, the city is rather a modern settlement (both villages merged in 19th century), so it doesn't really fit well into the mediaeval scheme of historical regions, I'm afraid. <i><font color="#990011">//</font></i><a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalibutt_9a46.html" title="User:Halibutt">Halibu</a><a href="../../../h/a/l/User_talk%7EHalibutt_5cbf.html" title="User talk:Halibutt">tt</a> 00:47, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
