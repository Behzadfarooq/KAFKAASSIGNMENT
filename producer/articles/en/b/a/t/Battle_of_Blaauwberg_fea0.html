<p>The battle was an event of the <a href="../../../n/a/p/Napoleonic_War_8511.html" title="Napoleonic War">Napoleonic War</a> in <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europe.html" title="Europe">Europe</a>. At that time, the <a href="../../../c/a/p/Cape_Colony_7325.html" title="Cape Colony">Cape Colony</a> belonged to the <a href="../../../n/e/t/Netherlands.html" title="Netherlands">Netherlands</a> (then called the Batavian Republic), which was under French control. Because the sea route around the Cape was important to the British, they decided to seize the colony in order to prevent it - and the sea route - from also coming under French control. A British fleet was despatched to the Cape in July <a href="../../../1/8/0/1805.html" title="1805">1805</a>, to forestall French troopships which <a href="../../../n/a/p/Napoleon.html" title="Napoleon">Napoleon</a> had sent to reinforce the Cape garrison.</p>
<p>The colony was governed by Lt Gen <a href="../../../j/a/n/Jan_Willem_Janssens_6101.html" title="Jan Willem Janssens">Jan Willem Janssens</a>, who was also commander-in-chief of its military forces. The forces were small and of poor quality, and included foreign units hired by the Batavian government for the purpose. They were backed up by local militia units.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Blaauwberg_fea0.html" title="Edit section: Events">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Events</span></h2>
<p>The first British warship reached the Cape on Christmas Eve 1805, and attacked two supply ships off the <a href="../../../c/a/p/Cape_Peninsula_9aa8.html" title="Cape Peninsula">Cape Peninsula</a>. Janssens placed his garrison on the alert. When the main fleet sailed into <a href="../../../t/a/b/Table_Bay_cea9.html" title="Table Bay">Table Bay</a> on <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_4.html" title="January 4">4 January</a> <a href="../../../1/8/0/1806.html" title="1806">1806</a>, he mobilised his garrison, declared martial law, and called up the militia.</p>
<p>After a delay caused by rough seas, two British infantry brigades, under command of Lt Gen Sir <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Baird_de48.html" title="David Baird">David Baird</a>, landed at <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melkbosstrand.html" title="Melkbosstrand">Melkbosstrand</a>, north of Cape Town, on <a href="../../../6/_/j/6_January_5bcd.html" title="6 January">6</a> and <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_7.html" title="January 7">7 January</a>. Janssens moved his forces to intercept them. He had decided that "victory could be considered impossible, but the honour of the fatherland demanded a fight". His intention was to attack the British on the beach and then to withdraw to the interior, where he hoped to hold out until the French troopships arrived.</p>
<p>However, on the morning of <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_8.html" title="January 8">8 January</a>, while Janssens's slow-moving columns were still moving through the veld, Baird's brigades began their march to Cape Town, and reached the slopes of the Blaauwberg mountain (now spelled "<a href="../../../b/l/o/Blouberg.html" title="Blouberg">Blouberg</a>"), a few kilometres ahead of Janssens. Janssens halted and formed a line across the veld.</p>
<p>The battle began at sunrise, with exchanges of artillery fire. They were followed by an advance by Janssens's militia cavalry, and volleys of musket fire from both sides. Then, one of Janssens's hired foreign units, in the centre of his line, turned and ran from the field. A British bayonet charge disposed of the units on Janssens's right flank, and he ordered his remaining troops to withdraw.</p>
<p>Janssens began the battle with 2049 troops, and lost 353 in casualties and desertions. Baird began the battle with 5399 men, and had 212 casualties.</p>
<p>From Blaauwberg, Janssens moved inland to a farm in the <a href="../../../t/y/g/Tygerberg.html" title="Tygerberg">Tygerberg</a> area, and from there his troops moved inland to the Elands Kloof in the Hottentots-Holland mountains, about 50km from Cape Town.</p>
<p>The British forces reached the outskirts of Cape Town on <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_9.html" title="January 9">9 January</a>. To spare the town and its civilian population from attack, the commandant of Cape Town, Lieutenant-Colonel Hieronymus Casimir von Prophalow sent out a white flag. He handed over the outer fortifications to Baird, and terms of surrender were negotiated later in the day.</p>
<p>The formal Articles of Capitulation for the town and the Cape Peninsula were signed the following afternoon, <a href="../../../1/0/_/10_January_87a1.html" title="10 January">10 Januaryata</a> cottage at Papendorp (now the suburb of Woodstock) which became known as "Treaty Cottage." Although the cottage has long since been demolished, Treaty Street still commemorates the event. The tree under which they signed remains to this day.</p>
<p>However the Batavian Governor of the Cape, General Janssens had not yet surrendered himself and his remaining troops and was following his plan to hold outfor as long as he could, in the hope that the French troopships for which he'd been waiting for months would arrive and save him.</p>
<p>He had only 1238 men with him, and 211 deserted in the days that followed.</p>
<p>Janssens held out in the mountains for a further week. Baird sent Brig Gen <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Beresford_5e67.html" title="William Beresford">William Beresford</a> to negotiate with him, and the two generals conferred at a farm belonging to Gerhard Croeser near the Hottentots-Holland on <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_16.html" title="January 16">16 January</a> without reaching agreement. After further consideration, and consultation with his senior officers and advisers, Janssens decided that "the bitter cup must be drunk to the bottom". He agreed to capitulate, and the final Articles of Capitulation were signed on <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_18.html" title="January 18">18 January</a>.</p>
<p>Uncertainty reigns as to where the Articles of Capitulation were signed. For many years it has been claimed that it was the Goedeverwachting estate (where a copy of the treaty is on display), but more recent research, published in Dr Krynauw's book <i>Beslissing by Blaauwberg</i> suggests that Croeser's farm (now the Somerset West golfcourse) may have been the venue. An article published in the 1820s by the then resident clergyman of the Stellenbosch district, Dr Borcherds, also points towards Croeser's farm.</p>
<p>The terms of the capitulation were reasonably favourable to the Batavian soldiers and citizens of the Cape. Janssens, and the Batavian officials and troops were sent back to the Netherlands in March.</p>
<p>The British forces occupied the Cape until <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_13.html" title="August 13">13 August</a> <a href="../../../1/8/1/1814.html" title="1814">1814</a>, when the Netherlands ceded the colony to Britain as a permanent possession. It remained a British colony until it was incorporated into the <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Africa_1287.html" title="South Africa">Union of South Africa</a> on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_31.html" title="May 31">31 May</a> <a href="../../../1/9/1/1910.html" title="1910">1910</a>.</p>
