Before any structural changes, perhaps the perspective could be balanced between American and British, because it seems that the British is exaggerated at the expense of American history. Now Americans and Brits have gotten along for 200 years. Lets insure our most significant battle is well recorded and an equal representation. Possibly the term Revolutionist could simply be replaced by Americans to make it less like rowdy colonist and more like freedom fighters.</p>

<p>I agree that the story could be more balanced by including more on the German, Indian and Tory contingents, and the American Militias involved. The Germans were almost 60% of the troops involved. A seemingly forgotten fact is that the British used almost 30,000 German troops and only about 38,000 British troops in the revolutionary war. There should also be a much more detailed account of what Milita groups were involved and where they came from and what they did. Originally this section didn't even have anything on the important role played by the Tyron county militia in the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Oriskany_9b1a.html" title="Battle of Oriskany">Battle of Oriskany</a>. There is also almost no mention of the Indians involved who served as significant British auxilaries. Their involvement in this and more battles seems to be a taboo subject. The <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Oriskany_9b1a.html" title="Battle of Oriskany">Battle of Oriskany</a>, <a href="../../../w/y/o/Wyoming_Valley_Massacre_e41b.html" title="Wyoming Valley Massacre">Wyoming Valley Massacre</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/e/Cherry_Valley_Massacre_f3f5.html" title="Cherry Valley Massacre">Cherry Valley Massacre</a>, <a href="http://www.americanrevolution.org/ind3.html" class="external text" title="http://www.americanrevolution.org/ind3.html" rel="nofollow">Stockbridge Massacre</a> and continued depradations on settlers in New York and Pennsylvania directly led Washington to order in 1779 the <a href="../../../s/u/l/Sullivan_Expedition_0695.html" title="Sullivan Expedition">Sullivan Expedition</a> which essentially drove most of the Iroquois out of New York into Canada. This was the major action by American forces in 1779. After we get the basics right it might be worth worrying about the British.</p>

<p>It's my intention to change the structure of this article. This will take a number of steps, and I'd like you to read the current page and changes in terms of the outline of where I'm going. When I get through I hope to have the following structure:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Saratoga Campaign (Strategy, Stanwix, Saratogo, and analysis}.
<dl>
<dd>Battle of Saratoga (general final events, and surrender)
<dl>
<dd>Battle of Freeman's Farm - Finished short Article</dd>
<dd>Battle of Bemis Heights - finished short Article</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Updated major biographies (Fraser, Morgan, Poor, Learned) and some related articles. Still need to update Arnold and Gates. We also need biographies on Schuyler and Lincoln as well as other minor characters. But, its making progresss. The Saratoga Campign has been expanded to describe St. Ledger's advance, but now I need more biographies, Fort Stanwix, and Oriskany entries.</p>
<p>In the meantime I may scatter stubs, and leave open links or redundent material that you'd rather see closed. Feel free, of course, to complete any of them with an article.&#160;:-)</p>
<p>I'll post status on this page from time to time.</p>

<dd>I've finally gotten at least an outline started for the Burgoyne expedition part of the Saratoga Campaign article.

<dd>This page needs an update. Some officers (Burgoyne) were immediately sent home, but most troops remained prisoners for years.

<p>Great work on all these articles Lou. (I realize I'm writing this more than two years later, so you may not even be watching this page any longer.)</p>
<p>There is one major problem that has developed with this structure over the years since you initially wrote the articles. The issue is that of "<a href="../../../f/o/r/Forking.html" title="Forking">forking</a>". Suppose that a person wants to add or correct something about the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Bemis_Heights_b597.html" title="Battle of Bemis Heights">Battle of Bemis Heights</a>. There are several possibilities: he or she might edit the <a href="../../../s/a/r/Saratoga_campaign.html" title="Saratoga campaign">Saratoga campaign</a> article, or the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Saratoga_4143.html" title="Battle of Saratoga">Battle of Saratoga</a> article, or the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Bemis_Heights_b597.html" title="Battle of Bemis Heights">Battle of Bemis Heights</a> article. That person might not edit all three articles, and may not even understand how the three articles relate. Multiply this by the many editors who contribute to the articles over the years, and you get diverging accounts of the battles and expeditions.</p>
<p>One way to avoid this is with "<a href="../../../s/u/m/Wikipedia%7ESummary_style_1b75.html" title="Wikipedia:Summary style">Wikipedia:Summary style</a>." Make it clear when the "see main article" notice is used that what follows is a summary of that topic, and that additional information should be added to the "main" article, in order to avoid forking.</p>
<p>Additionally, there may not be a need for a "Battle of Saratoga" article at all, since all that information can be divided between the "Saratoga campaign" article and well as the two battle articles. This will prevent confusion and further forking.</p>
<p>Because my time is limited, I have no intention of making these changes myself. I hope someone reading this will attempt to reorganize the Saratoga articles to make them easier to understand and edit, and to prevent forking. The fact that I must add this notice to four or five different articles is an illustration of the problem. --<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Myers_58fc.html" title="User:Kevin Myers">Kevin Myers</a> | <a href="../../../k/e/v/User_talk%7EKevin_Myers_d288.html" title="User talk:Kevin Myers">(complaint dept.)</a> 19:02, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thank you for the articles but I am still unclear on why there is a <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Saratoga_4143.html" title="Battle of Saratoga">Battle of Saratoga</a> and <a href="../../../s/a/r/Saratoga_campaign.html" title="Saratoga campaign">Saratoga campaign</a>. IMO the articles cover much of the same ground and should be merged. P.S. Since the articles are pretty complete I would hate to mar them with a vote on merger template. <a href="../../../a/m/e/User%7EAmericasroof_3ff1.html" title="User:Americasroof">Americasroof</a> 17:42, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I take it you are addressing Lou, since you agree with me that "Battle of Saratoga" and "Saratoga campaign" are redundant. I don't think Lou watches this page anymore, however. If you want to do a merger, I'd say go for it, since it seems few people are paying attention, and if you do it right, they'll be happy you took the initiative, if they ever notice at all. "Saratoga campaign" should be the main article, with summary sections on the two battles. --<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Myers_58fc.html" title="User:Kevin Myers">Kevin Myers</a> | <a href="../../../k/e/v/User_talk%7EKevin_Myers_d288.html" title="User talk:Kevin Myers">(complaint dept.)</a> 13:45, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I will try to add something about Kosciuszko's fortification impact. In the opinion of some of the contemporaries, it was crucial for American victory; yet it is not even mentioned in the article.</p>

<dd>It's very important. There is a whole set of monuments to Kosiuszko as you enter the park. I'm kicking myself for not taking the photos right away thinking there would be more later on.

<p>In the first paragraph in the Background section, there is a reference to "Putnam's forces." Putnam is not introduced prior to the reference so it reads a bit oddly and should be fixed.</p>

<p>In the last paragraph of the "Points of Interest" section of the Battle of Saratoga, it states:</p>
<p>"It is said that on the Battle of Saratoga Historical site there is a statue of a single leg with no caption. Purportedly this represents the response Benedict Arnold (wounded in the leg in Quebec and Saratoga) got when he asked a British officer what the Americans would do if he were captured: "They would cut your leg off and bury it with full military honors for your work at Quebec and Saratoga. The rest of you they would hang."</p>
<p>I believe there is an eror in stating that Arnold asked the British officer a hypothetical question about what "the <i>Americans</i> would do if he were "captured" -- since he is asking a <i>British</i> officer, and the logical answer from that officer is that "they" -- certainly implying the British forces --would have "cut your leg off and bury it with full military honors for your work at Quebec and Saratoga. The rest of you they would hang." I take that to mean that the British officer would respect Arnold's military prowess, in the honorable way that officers of even opposing armies would acknowledged such things in the 18th century, but that the British government would hang him, along with other American Revolutionary political and miliray leaders, for treason.</p>
<p>I can't imagine that the Briritish officer would assume that would be any reason for the Americans to "capture" Arnold, or that the Americans would have any reason to hang Arnold -- at least not at this juncture in the war, when he was still an active General on the side of the Continental Army, and was considered to be somewhat of a war hero (by everyone except Gen. Gates, perhaps) for his military successes in Quebec and Saratoga.</p>
<p>This is my first attempt at making an update/correction on Wikipedia. I hope it is up to your standards and proper procedures...!</p>

<dd>You did well. (Just be sure to sign your discussion page posts by typing "~~~~" at the end of your last paragraph, so people know who wrote it.) Probably the story about the British officer talking to Arnold, if true, dates from after Arnold's treason, long after Saratoga, when he was on the same side as the British. The British officer is saying that, if the Americans recapture Arnold (as sometimes happened), they'd hang him for treason but honor the leg. Sounds like a bogus quote to me, and it needs a source. --<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Myers_58fc.html" title="User:Kevin Myers">Kevin Myers</a> | <a href="../../../k/e/v/User_talk%7EKevin_Myers_d288.html" title="User talk:Kevin Myers">(complaint dept.)</a> 01:37, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It is interesting to note that the Battle of Saratoga was the first time that both powers had a sizeable army on a battlefield at the same time. Most of the fighting done prior to Saratoga leaned heavily on "guerilla warfare" (essentially terrorism) tactics on the part of the Revolutionaries. Moreover, the Battle of Saratoga would serve as the first major army-to-army clash. It was the first battle America had won without surprising British forces (See: <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Trenton_47a7.html" title="Battle of Trenton">Battle of Trenton</a>) and it helped convince the French monarchy that they could hurt the British significantly by helping the Americans.</dd>

<p>This was an inaccurate unsourced stream of consciousness. The Americans won the <a href="../../../s/i/e/Siege_of_Boston_effa.html" title="Siege of Boston">Siege of Boston</a> which was the last big battle in New England and Saratoga marked the failed British initiative to retake New England. The <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Long_Island_0662.html" title="Battle of Long Island">Battle of Long Island</a> was the biggest battle in the conflict. <a href="../../../a/m/e/User%7EAmericasroof_3ff1.html" title="User:Americasroof">Americasroof</a> 22:35, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>youve been hit! this battle made it so the French would join the war</p>
