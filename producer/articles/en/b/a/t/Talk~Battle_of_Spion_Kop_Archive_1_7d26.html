<p>Isn't Spion Kop spelt Spioenkop?--<a href="../../../j/c/w/User%7EJcw69_dff3.html" title="User:Jcw69">Jcw69</a> 17:41, 28 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>How do you figure that? Since South Africa does have English as a national language, and the accepted spelling is "Spioenkop" (according to not only the SA Government, military and a few museums), how is that not English? Simply because the British cannot spell it correctly? "Kop" in itself is not an English word, and therefore the whole name is a borrowed name. If it was something like "Spioen Head", it would have been a different matter. Furthermore, I believe your search claim is misleading, since not only English results are relevant. The search for "spioenkop" delivers hits primarily in South Africa, and "spion kop"'s hits lie primarily within British webspace. I vote to move and rename in the article to Spioenkop, with appropriate redirects from "spionkop", "spion kop" and "spioen kop". <a href="../../../d/e/w/User%7EDewet_832c.html" title="User:Dewet">Dewet</a> 13:49, 31 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You are ignoring what I said; the accepted "English" spelling (albeit South African English), <i>is</i> Spioenkop, according to the sources I mentioned. And, from your cited policy document, which I did indeed read:
<dl>
<dd><i>(As a reminder, all national standards of English spelling are acceptable on the English-language Wikipedia, both for titles and content. American spellings need not be respelled to British standards nor vice-versa; for example, either Aeroplane or Airplane is acceptable.)</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Therefore, Spioenkop being the national (South African) standard of spelling, it should be named as such, since this is, after all, a South African topic. QED. <a href="../../../d/e/w/User%7EDewet_832c.html" title="User:Dewet">Dewet</a> 14:50, 31 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>English is <i>a</i> language of India, but our article on Calcutta is at <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calcutta.html" title="Calcutta">Calcutta</a>, not "Kolkata", the local spelling, because the former is still the most common form in English. (We have Madras at <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chennai.html" title="Chennai">Chennai</a> now because that has now become the most common form <i>in English</i>, as is <a href="../../../m/u/m/Mumbai.html" title="Mumbai">Mumbai</a> for Bombay.)</dd>
<dd>I realize that "Spion Kop" was originally a mistake, but alas it's now by far and away the spelling that's prevalent (by over a 4 to 1 margin) throughout the English-speaking world. <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 15:52, 31 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That's not a fair comparison at all â€“ "calcutta" delivers about 3.5 million hits on Google (as per your own metric) and is a world city, known for many more things than a (comparatively) tiny battle a century ago. Ergo, this is inherently a South African topic (I mean, what percentage of Brits even know what happened in the Boer wars?), and should have the (correct) South African spelling. Note that I don't want to delete all references to "spion kop"; I'd even be happy to write a sentence or two to explain the difference in naming, but I maintain that we should move and rename. <a href="../../../d/e/w/User%7EDewet_832c.html" title="User:Dewet">Dewet</a> 16:51, 31 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You simply continue to ignore the point of my argument. Policy dictates that <b>national standards</b> of spelling is okay, which is what this is all about. South African <b>ENGLISH</b> (Afrikaans never entered into it) says "Spioenkop". Therefore, no matter what you say about "history being wrong, we should keep it" â€” its irrelevant, since the policy makes no mention of that. Don't patronise me about being parochial; I only brought it up because <b>you</b> insisted on following the policy, which I am doing. <a href="../../../d/e/w/User%7EDewet_832c.html" title="User:Dewet">Dewet</a> 19:32, 1 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's you who simply continues to ignore the point of my argument. The policy says <i>use the most commonly used English version of the name for the article</i>, and in English the "most commonly used .. version" throughout the English-speaking world as a whole is definitely "Spion Kop" - something you seem determined to ignore.</dd>
<dd>(The reference to "national standards" is clearly meant to apply to ordinary words which have variant spellings, as the example - Aeroplane/Airplane - shows.) In any event, that policy is not going to help you, because the standard with variant English spellings is to keep whichever variant national spelling was used <b>first</b>, and "Spion Kop" was used first. <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 20:06, 1 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I do not think that Spioenkop is so well known in the world that we are obliged to keep this mistake. Calcutta and Bombay <i>were</i> once the correct names - Spion Kop never was. I think we should lead, and not follow, and use the correct spelling. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikiwizzy_6422.html" title="User:Wikiwizzy">Wizzy</a> 16:08, Jan 31, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Spion Kop is a bastardised spelling of the word and if you want it to be Britsh English them we must change it to <i>Spy Head</i> or we can change it to the correct name of the hill which is Spioenkop. There is no such place as Spion Kop in South Africa. I feel that it should be re-directed but keep the in-correct spelling as re-directs in case someone who is looking for this battle site and does not know how to spell it correctly can find it--<a href="../../../j/c/w/User%7EJcw69_dff3.html" title="User:Jcw69">Jcw69</a> 16:42, 31 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Almost all names in language X for places in country Y which differ in spelling are "bastardised spelling(s)". I await with bated breath your attempt to move <a href="../../../../fr/l/o/n/Londres.html" class="extiw" title="fr:Londres">fr:Londres</a> to "London" on the grounds that "there is no such place as Londres in England". I repeat, this is the <i>English</i> Wikipedia, and <i>for the vast majority of the English-speaking world</i> (which is a lot more than the UK, no matter what some people seem to think), it's "Spion Kop". If you want to have an article at "Spioenkop", go for it - on the Afrikaans Wikipedia. <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 18:04, 1 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If the UK government and all of the British people insisted on "Londres", I'm sure that something would come of it. At the time of the battle, Spioenkop was an accepted name, the British simply got it wrong.

<p>Right, I've <a href="../../../b/e/_/Wikipedia%7EBe_bold_6b7b.html" title="Wikipedia:Be bold">been bold</a> and went ahead with the renaming in the body of the page. I've added more info, including a sentence about the naming confusion.

<p>I protest. Only a single user here wants to keep the page where it is. Jwc69 has been doing an amazing job of filling out the English wikipedia with South African information. Just check his user page - that is all <i>new pages</i>. The other three discussing it here are all in South Africa, though I am not a native. I have been to Spioenkop myself though, and climbed the hill. I write about Zulu topics and other African things. I request <a href="../../../n/o/e/User%7ENoel_2944.html" title="User:Noel">User:Noel</a> to go along with the majority and agree to the renaming. You admit yourself the current spelling is a mistake. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikiwizzy_6422.html" title="User:Wikiwizzy">Wizzy</a> 18:59, Feb 1, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree, and wish to salute Jcw69 for his tireless job filling out this wikipedia with tidbits about South Africa. Don't let a single user ruin this; if the argument had merit (ie., there was genuine doubt about the naming, or that the British had been right all along), I would have agreed, but this is turning into a farce. <a href="../../../d/e/w/User%7EDewet_832c.html" title="User:Dewet">Dewet</a> 19:32, 1 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I fail to see the point of having a Wikipedia policy on something if the editors of any page can ignore it. If the policy said "naming of pages is a matter for the editors of the page", I would cheerfully rename this page myself.

Australians, Canadians, Indians and New Zealanders, raised contingents which fought in the war. I have seen New Zealand books which refer to "Spion Kop", so this is not just a South African v British argument. I have read a number of English Books published in SA about the war and most used "Spion Kop" . I do not think that the official South African English usage is "Spioenkop" (for the Battle and not a placename on a map) because like English everywhere common usage is at least as important and on the net spionkop seems to be the most common in SA.</p>
<p>BTW "Kop" a borrowed word in British English, many football terraces are known as Kops and <a href="http://family.maltanet.net/hawk/html/Stadium" class="external text" title="http://family.maltanet.net/hawk/html/Stadium" rel="nofollow">Anfield's "Spion Kop"</a> is one of the more famous. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Baird_Shearer_a81d.html" title="User:Philip Baird Shearer">Philip Baird Shearer</a> 22:48, 1 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thank you, Philip, for at least suggesting a compromise. I think it is acceptable to have the introductory sentence using the old naming, and then using the correct naming throughout the article. I would still like to see it moved to the correct name, with relevant redirects added, but since <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Spioenkop_2753.html" title="Battle of Spioenkop">Battle of Spioenkop</a> already exists, an admin will have to do this. <a href="../../../d/e/w/User%7EDewet_832c.html" title="User:Dewet">Dewet</a> 11:03, 2 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Just to point out a flaw in <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a>'s logic: he first states that he did a search on "Spioenkop" <b>restricted to English pages</b> and got 1,490 hits (thus actually proving that "Spioenkop" is indeed an acceptable spelling in English, albeit a less popular variant, seemingly) but then blithely goes on to state that "Since policy on the English Wikipedia is to use the <i>English version</i> (my Italics) of names...". Thus the argument that the article should keep its current name due to it being the (only?) correct English-language spelling is fallacious. <a href="../../../e/l/f/User%7EElf-friend_659a.html" title="User:Elf-friend">Elf-friend</a> 16:05, 4 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

The previous afternoon I saw the Indian mule-train moved up the slopes of the Kop carrying water to the distressed soldiers who had lain powerless on the plateau. The mules carried the water in immense bags, one on each side, led by Indians at their heads. The galling rifle-fire, which heralded their arrival on the top, did not deter the strangely-looking cavalcade which moved slowly forward, and as an Indian fell, another quietly stepped forward to fill the vacant place...</i></dd>

<p>I am moving this article to the proper South African English title of Spioenkop. An example of why this has been done that most of my fellow South African editors may not be aware of is the fact that in Boston, the Battle of Bunker Hill Monument was built on the wrong hill. Because most Google links discuss the monument, this does not mean that the article about the battle should state that it took place on the wrong hill. Furthermore, it is not nationalism to state that an article pertaining to the history of that specific country is of national interest. No one would fault someone from the United States if someone said the Bunker Hill Battle was of US interest, and thus a proper American standard of spelling should be the name of the article. Furthermore, the only editor that would prefer this to remain at Spion Kop is Noel. <a href="../../../p/z/f/User%7EPZFUN_b231.html" title="User:PZFUN">PÃ¡ll</a> 08:43, 9 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Agree. Furthermore, I find the claim that Google is the final arbiter of (the most) popular usage to be nonsensical, seeing as there is a whole, wide world out there that is not linked to Google. Also, as I pointed out on the <a href="../../../t/s/h/Tshwane.html" title="Tshwane">Tshwane</a> talk page, when Pretoria is (probably) renamed to Tshwane later this year, should Wikipedia only rename (or merge &amp; redirect) its Pretoria article to Tshwane once the latter's Google count (currently 83,100) surpasses the former's (currently 3,400,000)? I can name many more examples where it would be silly to stick to so-called rules, instead of using common sense (see <a href="../../../l/u/f/Luftwaffe.html" title="Luftwaffe">Luftwaffe</a>, for example). <a href="../../../e/l/f/User%7EElf-friend_659a.html" title="User:Elf-friend">Elf-friend</a> 09:38, 9 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I do not think that anyone would dispute that the place is called Spioenkop, but the name of the battle is commonly known as <b>Battle of Spion Kop</b>. In this case it is the battle name which is under debate and battle names are often names which have little to do with modern locations (or the correct local location at the time). In this case I thought we had reached a workable compromise by keeping the title to the common name outside South Africa and using the South African name inside the article along with a reletitivly long note explaining why this is so. This compromise allows search engines to pick up on either name.</p>

<dd>I could agree with the battle/place differentiation. I heartily agree with the <i>more words and effort</i> comment. Perhaps we should go with the historians on this one. It still galls me that Wikipedia would perpetuate something that is obviously a spelling mistake. The English wikipedia must also wear the mantle of the international wikipedia. You can pretend it is the wikipedia for English speakers, but really it is the definitive wikipedia.

<dd>Noel is not quite right, the correct South African English name for the battle is the "Battle of Spioenkop", and not "The Battle of Spion Kop". Though the latter may have been used years ago, the accepted spelling in South Africa today is Spioenkop. For example. the term "Battle of Spioenkop" is used by: <a href="http://www.news24.com/News24/South_Africa/News/0,,2-7-1442_1369188,00.html" class="external text" title="http://www.news24.com/News24/South_Africa/News/0,,2-7-1442_1369188,00.html" rel="nofollow">The SA Navy</a> (<a href="../../../s/a/s/SAS_Spioenkop_%28F147%29_0131.html" title="SAS Spioenkop (F147)">SAS Spioenkop</a> - named after the battle not the place); <a href="http://ladysmith.kzn.org.za/ls/24.xml" class="external text" title="http://ladysmith.kzn.org.za/ls/24.xml" rel="nofollow">the official Ladysmith site</a>; <a href="http://www.lcci.co.za/tourism.html" class="external text" title="http://www.lcci.co.za/tourism.html" rel="nofollow">the Ladysmith Chamber of Commerce and Industry site</a>; <a href="http://www.anglo-boer.co.za/chrono1.html" class="external text" title="http://www.anglo-boer.co.za/chrono1.html" rel="nofollow">the Anglo-Boer War Museum</a>; <a href="http://www.sahistory.org.za/pages/people/cronje-p.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.sahistory.org.za/pages/people/cronje-p.htm" rel="nofollow">the SA History Online project</a>; <a href="http://www.militarymuseum.co.za/main.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.militarymuseum.co.za/main.htm" rel="nofollow">the SA National Museum of Military History</a> and the <a href="http://rapidttp.com/milhist/vol072sw.html" class="external text" title="http://rapidttp.com/milhist/vol072sw.html" rel="nofollow">South African Military History Society Journal</a>. There are also some non-SA sources that use this spelling, including <a href="http://www.haa.harvard.edu/alumni/html/ts_africapolicy_itinerary_mar_2005.html" class="external text" title="http://www.haa.harvard.edu/alumni/html/ts_africapolicy_itinerary_mar_2005.html" rel="nofollow">the Harvard University Alumni Association</a>, the UK's <a href="http://www.armourer.co.uk/back_issues4.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.armourer.co.uk/back_issues4.htm" rel="nofollow">the Armourer magazine</a> and books such as Pakenham's <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0349104662/ref=ase_casusbellimilitb/026-6909844-4958030" class="external text" title="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0349104662/ref=ase_casusbellimilitb/026-6909844-4958030" rel="nofollow">the Boer War</a> (easily one of the best books on the subject). Many of the above sources are extremely authoritative, and so it would not be wise to dismiss "Spioenkop" so quickly as some wish to do. It's evident that both spellings are important and neither can be ignored. However, on balance, I think it is the official spelling as used officially in SA, that should be the title of the article, with a redirect from Spion Kop and an explanation of the spelling difference. <a href="../../../i/m/p/User%7EImpi_7672.html" title="User:Impi">Impi</a> 13:25, 13 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Most of the military histories written in English were written by the British Empire side and their works still influence most of what is written today. Most English language military histories use the general <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commonwealth_of_Nations_38fc.html" title="Commonwealth of Nations">Commonwealth</a> spelling for the battle names. Men from Australia, New Zealand, and Canada where thought to make superior soldiers for the sort of campaign waged in the second half of the war, so volunteers from those countries were encouraged to join. In New Zealand for example there are many Boer War memorials and the war is marked as the first war on the <a href="http://www.nationalwarmemorial.govt.nz/index.html" class="external text" title="http://www.nationalwarmemorial.govt.nz/index.html" rel="nofollow">National War Memorial</a> consequently the war has a higher profile in NZ than it does in the UK. So this is debate should no be viewed as a chance to bash the Poms. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Baird_Shearer_a81d.html" title="User:Philip Baird Shearer">Philip Baird Shearer</a> 18:09, 10 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's clear that Spion Kop is common in English. As long as there are redirects and search, I see no problem reverting to the native Latin-based names even in historical events. Anyone is free to link to or mention <b>Battle of Spion Kop</b>, which gets redirected to <b>Battle of Spioenkop</b> with "also known as <b>Battle of Spion Kop</b>" in the intro, noone is harmed. This is exactly what happens with many Russian names like <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_Suvorov_9a45.html" title="Alexander Suvorov">Suvorov</a>/<a href="../../../s/u/v/Suvarov.html" title="Suvarov">Suvarov</a>, and I've yet to see any negative effect of similar <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_Battle_of_Z%C3%BCrich_82d2.html" title="Second Battle of ZÃ¼rich">Second Battle of ZÃ¼rich</a> case. --<a href="../../../d/m/i/User%7EDmitryKo_2815.html" title="User:DmitryKo">DmitryKo</a> 10:08, 14 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It is important, because when a page is moved like this even if the person who makes the move intends that one string is contained with the alternative name, subsequent modifications often remove the former. Take the "Second Battle of Zurich" which was changed to the "Second Battle of ZÃ¼rich", if one uses www.google.co.za then the main page does not show up because, despite the redirect, the the Google search engine does not find the page because the word Zurich is not present on the page. If this page name is changed to "Battle of Spioenkop" there is a chance (possibly by another pedant in a few months or years) that the string "Spion Kop" will be removed and the page will not be found using a search on "Spion Kop" by popular search engines used in many Commonwealth countries. E.g. using www.google.co.za:</p>
<ul>
<li>about 4 for "Second Battle of ZÃ¼rich" +wikipedia</li>
<li>about 75 for "Second Battle of Zurich" +wikipedia And does not include the Battle page on Wikipedia.</li>
</ul>
<p>Personally I think that the current page structure using the non SA name first and then the SA name for the rest of the article is a good compromise which fulfils the Wikipedia educational remit and allows the technology of an on-line resource to work at its most effective. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Baird_Shearer_a81d.html" title="User:Philip Baird Shearer">Philip Baird Shearer</a> 11:26, 14 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Nowhere was there a motion to remove all references to Spion Kop. In fact, I offered (and did, to some extent try) to make specific mention of the disparity in naming. I'm not for a moment trying to deny the fact that a significant part of the world refers to this battle using the name "Spion Kop"; my primary motive is correctness (being pedantic, if you insist) in terms of naming. It has been sufficiently established that the <b>correct</b> spelling is Spioenkop, while the <b>accepted</b> spelling is Spion Kop. Google will still have its chance to index the page, barring any indexing bugs it might have, and the world will be a wiser place. <a href="../../../d/e/w/User%7EDewet_832c.html" title="User:Dewet">Dewet</a> 12:22, 14 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>On another note, the whole google not indexing the second battle of Zurich correctly seems to be an anomaly -- using both zurich and zÃ¼rich search terms (plus site:wikipedia.org) do not deliver the correct result, as does a search for the city. I would argue that google needs to fix their indexing/search schemes to equate 'Ã¼' with 'u' -- the lack of hits by google would be felt by any site using the correct spelling, not just wikipedia. <a href="../../../d/e/w/User%7EDewet_832c.html" title="User:Dewet">Dewet</a> 12:27, 14 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>An obvious solution is to include "also known as <b>Second Battle of Zurich</b>" in the intro, which is what I did today, and to revert any unneeded removals of <b>Battle of Spion Kop</b> as well. <a href="../../../d/m/i/User%7EDmitryKo_2815.html" title="User:DmitryKo">DmitryKo</a> 12:55, 14 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I am not sure we have established <b>common English usage</b>. By <b>primary author</b> do you mean the initial author of the page&#160;? (Lets skip the initial author, we would not be discussing any of this if we were not ever to rename pages). Impi, above, has listed some authoritative references for preferred English South African spelling. Am I being pedantic to ask for some recent, authoritative, sources for "Battle of Spion Kop" spelling&#160;? If the South African Navy chooses to name a ship after the battle, does that not indicate preferred spelling, and should we not go along, as per the Calcutta renaming&#160;? We have established no consensus yet on this page, and the voting margin is too small to decide. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikiwizzy_6422.html" title="User:Wikiwizzy">Wizzy</a>â€¦<a href="../../../w/i/k/User_talk%7EWikiwizzy_3a7f.html" title="User talk:Wikiwizzy"><big><big><b>â˜Ž</b></big></big></a> 11:28, Mar 15, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Primary author is one of the guidelines for how words should be spelt on the page. There is a second guideline which states that when an article of national interest then national spelling overrides primary author. EG if you write an article about an American regiment you can expect it to be copy edited into American spelling. Just as you would do to an article about a South African regiment. (This is nothing more than the guidelines recognising what happens in practice and trying to reduce time consuming conflict over this type of thing). But when one is taking about an article about a war or a battle between two English speaking countries, there are two (or more) specific national interests, so the article tends to remain in the English of the primary author, however common usage and sources, still has some weight in the decision. Trying to forcing this change on this article breaks at least two guidelines primary author and common usage in favour of one guideline on national usage. Why have guidelines (which are there to help to reduce silly time consuming arguments like this one) if people are going to ignore them when it suits them? People should spend their time changing the guidelines, so that they can then change articles within those guidelines. To ignore the guidelines in articles like this just results in everyone spending lots of time in these petty arguments and setting precedents for more to come. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Baird_Shearer_a81d.html" title="User:Philip Baird Shearer">Philip Baird Shearer</a> 14:57, 15 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It is not <i>Wikipedia policy to have the winner take all</i>. If it is, please provide a link to the policy page which says this. WP:RM requires a rough consensus before the move is made.

<dd>Then we'd never get anywhere, and I'd be tempted to just start a new article at the correct name. We have the ability to correct history, without having to impede, destroy or negate the legacy. There's definitely more "consensus" to change the name, in fact by a 20% margin. Let's sum up what we have collectively agreed to:
<ul>
<li>Spioenkop has been in use since before the battle, when the Voortrekkers/other Afrikaner inhabitants named it; this is evident from the fact that it wasn't simply called "Spy Head".</li>
<li>A fork occured at the time of the battle, with "Spioenkop" being predominantly in South African literature, and "Spion Kop" being recorded in British and Commonwealth literature.</li>
<li>The British naming has become somewhat entrenched by virtue of the British Empire's reach, while the naming in South Africa hasn't changed; in fact, the South African naming has become official in as far as the government and other authorities are concerned.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>My argument, again, is simply this: the correctness of "Spion Kop" is supported solely by the sheer volume of colonial literature on it, not by any geographical or other virtue. That we cannot change, but we can inform. This is the point of the whole exercise; Wikipedia <b>is</b> striving to be an authorative, correct source, isn't it? <a href="../../../d/e/w/User%7EDewet_832c.html" title="User:Dewet">Dewet</a> 15:33, 15 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm sorry, I do not want to denegrate into name calling, but I dislike the suggestion that I am impartial. I have made my vote, as have you. To me, a 20% lead is a clear margin of support. This is a highly obscure topic for most people, and I am quite amazed that we have had as many votes as we have. I did not say that I would move it now, but I did say that I was calling for final votes because this debate cannot drag on forever.

<p>A consensus is not a simple majority. If it were then the WP:RM page would say that. PÃ¡ll, you are interested in the result, as am I. I have mearly suggested that a disinterested administrator who monitors WP:RM, decides if (as the template says) "there is a clear consensus". In the interests of <a href="../../../n/a/t/Natural_justice.html" title="Natural justice">natural justice</a>, when there is a debate on if there is not a clear consensus, someone who has a partial interest in the result, should not make that decision. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Baird_Shearer_a81d.html" title="User:Philip Baird Shearer">Philip Baird Shearer</a> 17:14, 15 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'm not disinterested, but I would say consensus has not been reached with 8 out of 13 votes (62%). The <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EConsensus_ada0.html" title="Wikipedia:Consensus">proposed policy</a> mentions 70% and 80%.</p>
<p>But the total number voting is quite small. Perhaps there are some places we could flog this vote to get more (and more disinterested) participants, to get this proposal to more clearly pass or fail.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Dutch and Afrikaans</span></h2>
<p>As far as I know the confusion comes from the fact when the battle took place the Afrikaans language was not yet a widely written language, and certainly not an official language. <i>Spioen</i> is the Afrikaans word for 'spy' or 'look-out' while the Dutch word is <i>spion</i>.</p>
<p>At the time though Afrikaans was the <i>spoken</i> language of the Boers, Dutch was the <i>written</i> and official language. Therefore the place would have been written in Dutch as <i>Spionkop</i> or <i>Spion Kop</i> (I'm not sure whether Dutch combines words in the same way as Afrikaans). Afrikaans only replaced Dutch as an official language 25 years after the battle. Since then many Dutch place names have been changed to their Afrikaans versions.</p>
