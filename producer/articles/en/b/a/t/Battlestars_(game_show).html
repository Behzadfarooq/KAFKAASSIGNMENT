<p>Two contestants - one a returning champion - competed; the one in the champion's seat (on the right) was designated "blue," the other "red." They faced a six-member celebrity panel, who sat in a large space-like set made up of triangles. Each triangle had three numbers (1-10) attached to their points; hence, they were called "points of light" (1-4-5, 2-5-6, 3-6-7, 4-5-8, 5-6-9, and 6-7-10).</p>
<p>The contestant in control would push a plunger on his/her podium to stop a flashing randomizer, and the number it stopped on determined what celebrity would be asked a question. The questions were asked in the style of <i>The Hollywood Squares</i>, and after the contestant gave his/her answer, the contestant was asked whether he/she agreed or disagreed with the celebrity. A correct response meant that he/she kept control. If the contestant was wrong, control passed to his/her opponent. Regardless of how the contestant in control answered, the point of light was lighted and it was then taken out of play.</p>
<p>If the player in control lights the last "point of light" around a celebrity, even if his/her opponent was responsible for the other two lights, the player "captured" that star. The first contestant to "capture" three stars won $500 and the game, and played the bonus round.</p>
<p>If a number was attached to two triangles, the contestant chose which celebrity to play with, although the choice defaulted if it meant a star could be "captured" (unless of course more than one star can be captured). Also, if a contestant managed to "capture" all six celebrities (a rare feat), he/she won $1,000.</p>

<p>The rules were identical except for these minor changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The points of light were now extinguished regardless of the contestant's decision.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The randomizer was only used when control passed between contestants. Upon getting a correct answer, the contestant in control simply chose a number verbally.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The celebrity, and studio and television audiences saw two possible answers (one of them was correct). The contestant never saw them.</li>

<p>A famous celebrity face was completely hidden under 16 numbered blocks. The winner of the game chose three cards, which Trebek would put in a scanner on his podium. After the three blocks were removed, the contestant picked one more square that would help them most, then they had a chance to identify the celebrity for $5,000.</p>
<p>However, if they gave a wrong guess or couldn't answer, the contestant drew up to three additional cards (one at a time) and could solicit help from the celebrities. The prize value dropped to $3,000 for the first card, then $2,000 and $1,000.</p>
<p>The game ended when one of the two things happened:</p>
<ul>
<li>A correct answer was given, which netted the contestant the value of the jackpot.</li>
<li>He/she failed to identify the face after four attempts, in which case the contestant won nothing.</li>

<p>The winner and the three captured Battlestars (or three of the contestant's choice if more were captured) played a three-question bonus round. Each multiple-choice question had three possible answers (everybody sees the three answers in this game). After the celebrity offered his/her choice, the contestant was asked whether he/she agreed or disagreed. If the contestant was correct in disagreeing, he/she had to choose the correct answer from the two remaining choices to win any cash.</p>
<p>The first two questions were played for $500 each. If the contestant answered all three questions correctly, he/she won $5,000 and a prize package (the "Battlestars Bonanza"), which would usually make the total bonus round worth $10,000 or more.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/t/Battlestars_%28game_show%29.html" title="Edit section: Technical information">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Technical information</span></h2>
<p>The series was well-known among game show fans for two hallmarks: its set and "<a href="../../../o/u/t/Outer_space.html" title="Outer space">outer space</a>"-type sound effects.</p>
<p>The series was also called by game show purists <i>Hollywood Triangles</i> due to the rules that are more or less similar to <i>The Hollywood Squares</i>.</p>
<p>The celebrities sat in three large diamonds, each divided in half to resemble an isosceles triangle. Each triangle had a numbered "point of light" (numbered 1-10), which determined the celebrity whom the contestant would be playing with on a question.</p>
<p>One of the sound effects used was a Pac-Man-esque sound when a player captured a celebrity; the electronic "time's up" bell carried over to <i>Scrabble</i> sometime in 1986, used to indicate <i>speedword</i> rules were in effect. The former of the two also carried over to <i>Scrabble</i> to indicate a player guessed a word immediately after landing on a pink or blue square, resulting in bonus money, but that effect was later discontinued.</p>

<p><a href="../../../j/e/r/Jerry_Seinfeld_0ee4.html" title="Jerry Seinfeld">Jerry Seinfeld</a> appeared as a panelist in 1982. At the time he was a relatively unknown comic working the stand-up circuit.</p>
<p><i>Battlestars</i> Returned to NBC in the 12:00 noon death slot in 1983 in which many stations preempted the show for Local News. Two other shows that had the same fate were <i>Go!</i> and <i>Hot Potato.</i></p>
<p>This was Alex Trebek's last game show in 1983 before striking gold with Jeopardy! the following year.</p>
