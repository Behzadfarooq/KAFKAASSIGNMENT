<p>Very big. I just copied over some stuff from <i>Fall of France</i> (which is now a redirect).

<p>Is "Case Yellow" really the same thing as the Battle of France? Case Yellow was the German plan for the invasion of France. And, as I recall, it was actually an early version of the German plan that wasn't actually used. We shouldn't be calling Case Yellow an equivalent name for the Battle of France. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john</a> <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Kenney_ebe6.html" title="User talk:John Kenney">k</a> 05:20, 24 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>"Case Yellow" (Fall Geib) was the name of the operation, just as Fall Weiß was the conquest of Poland and Fall Blau was the 1942 Eastern offensive. I've seen "Fall" in this context translated as "operation." It's as correct to call the "Battle of France" "Case Yellow" as it is to call the "Battle of Normandy" "Operation Overlord." There were different plans for Fall Geib, but the name of the operation remained the same. I think "Battle of France" is the most neutral way to describe what happened. --ArminTamzarian 09:02, 30 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I noted that listed as possible causes for the German victory was French "defeatism". I was wondering if there is any basis in this aside from anti-french sentiment so common in the US today. <a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarley_peters_50eb.html" title="User:Harley peters">Harley peters</a></p>

<dd>Well, the phenomenon is quite old and has been a part of most Polish history books since WWII. It is definitely not a recent idea. [[User:Halibutt|<a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalibutt_9a46.html" title="User:Halibutt">Halibutt</a>]] 04:37, Dec 18, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I think that if it were covered more in-depth, it would be more palatable. I agree that throwing the phrase "French defeatism" out there by itself stinks of anti-French bias, but from my understanding of the politics of the time, there is some ground to stand on that may be worth pointing out in this article provided that it is done in the context of facts and realities of French wartime politics. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Faanes_5d45.html" title="User:Adam Faanes">Adam Faanes</a> 08:17, 10 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Yes, I also agree that this interpretation "stinks with bias". It is much more important to understand that 1) the allies were not prepared to fight a war in 1940 that had recently incorporated new technologies and ideas. The Germans had perfected their communication problems as well as the mobility problems which plagued the Schlieffen Plan in 1914. Additionally, Britain only half-heartedly came to the aid of France, and when it appeared that the outlook was not favorable, the British withdrew their air support in preparation for fighting another day - They had this advantage that the French did not.</p>
<p>In conclusion, defeatism is a ridiculous interpretation of these events. Britain had the advantage of distance, and the Channel (as well as its navy) provided a boundary that was sufficient enough to avoid being overrun as the French had, and the mistakes they made early on did not jeopardize their existance as it had for the French. The Allies expected to fight the war exactly as they had in World War I - not just the French - just as the Germans had expected 1914 to go the same way as it did in 1870. France's proximity did not allow for a second chance after this mistake had been realized. Defeatism is garbage, and no American knows what life is like when a war is being fought literally in their backyard, let alone the same continent. Please remove and preserve this article's integrity. --Hohenstauf 22:42, 10 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The first remarks were made when the article was very different from what it is now. Defeatism is now only mentioned as one of the more common explanations that <i>have been given</i> — and the article should of course reflect this historical fact, that it has indeed been used as an explanation, most often in France itself. But you show a little bias yourself by suggesting that the armies of the Entente (yes, it was still called this way then&#160;:o) were somehow less modernised than the German forces. This is in fact an extreme simplification of a very complex technological and tactical situation.</dd>

Yes, I agree. Their strengths were relatively the same and so on. I would consider improved communication a distinct edge for the Germans, however - even if earlier conclusions about Allied equipment have changed over the years. --Hohenstauf 11:10, 20 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>On the strategic level, command &amp; control on the French side were poor; but this was in part intentional, to give commanders more freedom. Ironically the, most certainly <i>not</i> intended, failure on the German side to exert strategic control allowed Guderian and Rommel to implement true Blitzkrieg tactics during a few crucial days.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>On the tactical level it's true all German tanks were equipped with radio sets (though most had listening sets only), while French <i>light</i> tanks, with the exception of a single unit, had none.--MWAK 05:44, 21 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I too like the new article, but there are a few major problems:</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>It doesn't make very clear that operationally the German offensive had the nature of a counter-attack. The allied commanders didn't act hesitantly but very forcefully. They advanced as swiftly as the Germans in a modern motorized operation - but into friendly territory, wasting their fuel and readiness on gaining a position that proved to be inferior.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>It will suggest to some that Gamelin also tactically expected some kind of WWI attack. In fact he was fully aware the Germans would try to attempt a mechanized breakthrough - he just thought they would do so at Gembloux on a very narrow frontage following their own doctrine of <i>Schwerpunkt</i>. So he concentrated half of his armoured reserves at that sector. The possibility of an attack through the Ardennes was considered but rejected as it wouldn't fit a breakthrough by tanks.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>It doesn't mention the one decisive event of the whole campaign: the carpet bombing at Sedan, punching a hole in the French lines (and no, this was not done by Stuka's and tanks as all diagrams show...). So the decisive strategic surpise was that the Germans did <i>not</i> use tanks for the breakthrough itself - just for the strategic exploiting (the classic cavalry role!). And so Gamelin had been fatally right.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>It confuses the (attempted) attacks by 1, 2 and 3 DC with the later attack of 4 DC under de Gaulle on the 17th.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>It doesn't mention the fundamental difference of opinion between Guderian and Rommel on the one and the High Command on the other hand. The latter saw tanks simply as a means to conquer and protect enough room for the main body of infantry divisions to position itself favourably. The opinion of the two generals they didn't really understand themselves: at the time there was no clear concept of "Blitzkrieg" yet, neither at the High Command nor in the minds of Rommel and Guderian (read <i>Achtung: Panzer!</i> - or read it again). After the fact they would formalize it into a doctrine.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>It doesn't mention the counter-attacks at Amiens and Abbéville not making clear how crippling the materiel losses were that threw away the last chance for effective defense.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>It doesn't clearly differentiate between the two main phases of <i>Fall Rot</i>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>It doesn't make clear how utterly surprising the German victory was: the defeat of an enemy that was numerically superior in men, artillery, tanks and motorised units - and that this could only have been accomplished because that enemy gave up its main strength: the advantage of the defender - by being too offensive! (which brings us back at point one&#160;:o)</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course there are also some minor factual inexactitudes: e.g. the Allies were already cut off at the 20th.</p>

<p>It's certainly a much better article now - and very well written!

But I'll try to mention some indisputed facts - without patterning them too much...</p>
<p>MWAK--84.27.81.59 12:05, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Also, no information is given at all on the war as it unfolded in the Netherlands and Belgium. Especially the Dutch defense was in many places relatively effective at stopping or seriously delaying the Germans (despite lack of equipment and training). The Grebbe for example held out to the end as did fortress Kornwerderzand (with the assistance of elements of the Dutch navy). These forces surrendered only after German threats that the massacre of Rotterdam would be repeated against other major cities (especially Amsterdam and Utrecht were mentioned). In the Netherlands it is generally believed that the German bombing of Rotterdam despite the city surrendering was NOT a failure or an error on the parts of the Germans but a deliberate show of force to get the Dutch forces they couldn't otherwise defeat without serious loss of life and time on their own side into submission.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, we need separate articles for both the attack on The Netherlands (German invasion of The Netherlands) and the attack on Belgium (German invasion of Belgium in 1940). But <i>some</i> information is already given.&#160;:o) To describe these complicated and very interesting subcampaigns in the level of detail they deserve would, I feel, put too great an emphasis on events that in the end hardly influenced the general outcome.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>To address some of your factual points: the Dutch Field Army had already been withdrawn to the New Waterline on the 14th, abandoning the Grebbeline. Still, it's true four of the nine Dutch divisions had seen no fighting at all. To call the Kornwederzand position a "fortress" perhaps stretches the meaning of the word too much, but that clever array of pillboxes blocking the Enclosure Dam was probably impregnable to the German 1st Cavalry Division attacking it. I'm personally convinced the bombardment of Rotterdam, whatever its tactical desirability, also had the nature of a planned terror attack. Also it's indisputable the Germans demanded the surrender of Utrecht, threatening to bomb the city itself even though the New Waterline ran east of it. Nevertheless the former has never been proven and in the latter case we shall never know what they would have bombed exactly. Though I fear the worst...</dd>

<p>I would like to revise the numbers that we currently have. The ~400K is the number given as total French persons killed during both the combat AND the following occupation.

<p>Sorry: only now I understand that you were referring to the first list. I think the creator of that one has simply made an error in his calculations: it should be 301,000 for all allies, in stead of 401,000.&#160;:o)</p>

<p>And again I've made a mistake: not the first list was wrong, but the second, giving only 100,000 French wounded. So the total is about 401,000 for all allies, which then just happens to coincide with the total number of French casualties in the war.</p>

<p>Polish losses: 1140 KIA, 4850 WIA: but on other pages i saw that one division alone had 5200 losses, so it would mean that 2nd (only two IIRC actually saw the battle) had not large losses. around 10.000 soldiers interned in Switzerland. 19-25.000 (saw different estimates) evacuated to UK.

<p>I read in a book a few years ago (the book was a biography on Hitler written at the latest in the 80s but maybe as early as the early-mid 70s, I don't have it on hand currently) that the Allies had very specific intelligence on the planned German invasion, but did not take advantage of it because a) they had recieved the information many times before and the German attack didn't come, even though it was supposed to occur, but the weather prevented the Luftwaffe from doing its part so the invasion was delayed, reslting in a similarity to "The Boy Who Cried Wolf". and/or b) the Allies just did not use the information properly.

<dd>Dutch diplomats had contacts with dissident German officers who gave them the exact time of the start of the German offensive — each time that is, for the offensive was many times postponed. The Dutch then, despite their neutrality, informed the Entente. All this mattered very little. The offensive was hardly a surprise attack. Even if Gamelin had received the full German operational plan, it's doubtful whether he would have changed his dispositions much. What makes the campaign so special for us: its Blitzkrieg aspect, was not part of that plan! On the other hand even slight changes might have led to German failure because, if you model the campaign, such failure is the typical outcome anyway. The Germans were very lucky on many occasions: e.g. Guderian considered postponing the breakthrough attempt to 14 May because he feared not having enough infantry. If so, the counterattack would have been carried out by 3 DCR instead of 7 BCL and might well have reduced the bridgehead, leaving Heinz without sufficient means for a second try&#160;:o).</dd>

<li>Mmm, well Hitler was concerned about a two-front war and the conquest of Franch freed up most of his army for Barbarossa. It also provided coastal bases for U-boat operations, and provided a potential launching point for a potential invasion of England. The French colonies became a concern for England, and it took the French fleet out of action in the Mediterranean. Oh yes, it also cost England much of her army equipment, which was abandoned at Dunkirk and wouldn't be available for a devense against Seelowe. — <a href="../../../r/j/h/User%7ERJHall_ff1f.html" title="User:RJHall">RJH</a> 22:16, 16 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>And not to forget France and the Low Countries were an important asset in themselves with their modern industry, mines, strategic food, raw materials and oil stocks and labour force.

<p><i>The next morning, on the 14th, two French tank battalions tried to counter-attack but were repulsed by suicidal attacks with satchel charges by fanatical German combat engineers</i></p>
<p>Were these actually engineers who used risky (suicidal) tactics to destroy french tanks by planting charges on them (like the greasy socket charges in <i>saving private ryan</i>) or did they actually blow themselves up like suicide bombers? I would find the latter hard to believe, such things were generally not done by european soldiers. Of course there are examples of a few soldiers who were willing to sacrifice themselves for their comrades or the fatherland (a single prussian engineer blew himself up to create a breach in a danish fortification in the war of 1864), but the text implies large numbers of soldiers doing it. A clarification and source would be nice.</p>
<p><br />
<i>Admiral Darlan's promise to prevent the French fleet at Toulon from falling into German hands was not entirely upheld</i></p>
<p>What exactly does this referr to? The capture of french vessels at Toulon in 1942 would be out of place here, as the location of this sentence the text makes it sound as if french ships were handed to the Germans before British actions at Mers-el-Kebir. AFAIK this did not happen.</p>

<dd>Good questions! I'll try to answer them:</dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li>They were indeed suicidal attacks, not suicide attacks&#160;:o). However the entire passage has to be rewritten anyway: while writing it I was fooled by German propaganda. On 14 May at noon Stuka's bombed Chémery, though it was already taken. They killed several German officers among whom the commander of <i>Pionierbataillon 43</i>. To cover up the mistake they invented a <i>Heldentod</i> for him. I will detail and correct the account of the events of 14 May, as I have been much too imprecise.</li>
<li>Darlan gave Churchill his word that he would ensure the French fleet at Toulon was scuttled, should the Germans attempt to gain control over it. However article 8 of the armistice stipulated the Germans would control the fleet there. Of course in the latter case "control" meant "check whether it adhered to the armistice conditions", but the British saw the ambiguity as a serious danger, best remedied by sinking most of the French fleet.</li>

<p>Hi, The title for this article is incorrect as the content covers both the Battle of France <u>and</u> the Battle of the Low Countries. The battle of the Low Countries (Belgium, Luxembourg and Holland) is planned by the German military operation Case Yellow (<i>Fall Gelb</i>) while the battle of France, a successive offensive to Case Yellow, is planned by the German military operation Case red (<i>Fall Red</i>). Next, the current title gives the impression that independant countries <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belgium.html" title="Belgium">Belgium</a>, <a href="../../../l/u/x/Luxembourg.html" title="Luxembourg">Luxembourg</a> and <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holland.html" title="Holland">Holland</a> are part of <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">France</a>, which is not. A possible solution would be to change the title into <i>The Battle of the Low countries and France</i> or even better to split it into 2 articles; Operation Yellow (Battle of the Low Countries) and Operation Red (Battle of France). <a href="../../../w/o/2/User%7EWO2_ccdc.html" title="User:WO2">WO2</a> 18:45, 4 January 2006 (UTC) <a href="../../../u/p/l/Special%7EUpload_3661.html" class="new" title="Image:Palm.jpeg">Image:Palm.jpeg</a></p>

<dd>Well, it's an existing convention to name the entire conflict (<i>Fall Gelb</i> and <i>Fall Rot</i> together) "The Battle of France". The title of this article simply reflects that normal usage; it's not an endorsement of it. An encyclopedia is not an authority; it's simply a mirror. However it would certainly be desirable to have a separate <i>Fall Rot</i> article, detailing the events in June&#160;:o)--MWAK 08:40, 5 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Ok, it is a piety that the historians forgot to provide reasonable details about the Low Countries in this offensive. Let's work to have a separate Fall Rot and Fall Gelb article to emphasize the military planning behind the main offensive to Holland, Belgium, Luxembourg and France. Today Fall Gelb is rerouted to Battle of France. I propose to write an article on Fall Gelb and Fall Rot with an <i>italic highlight</i> in the beginning to the main article Battle of France. <a href="../../../w/o/2/User%7EWO2_ccdc.html" title="User:WO2">WO2</a> 19:10, 5 January 2006 (UTC) <a href="../../../u/p/l/Special%7EUpload_3661.html" class="new" title="Image:Palm.jpeg">Image:Palm.jpeg</a></dd>

<p>Hi MWAK, this is JQ. I see that you reverted some of my changes and no big deal. I do believe the staffing vs. training issue regarding the "B" divisions is not accurately portrayed in this article, but it really is a small issue in the big scheme. However, lets look at one in particular passage:</p>
<p>Line 158 reads now:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Equipment imbalances. Contrary to popular opinion, often assuming that the Germans had a completely mechanized army, while the French only had WWI equipment, there was no general disparity of armament levels. It is generally acknowledged that in a pure battle of <a href="../../../a/t/t/Attrition.html" title="Attrition">attrition</a>, the Germans could not have won.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>"Contrary to popular opinion"??? <i>Who holds this opinion?</i></p>
<p>"It is generally acknowledged that in a pure battle of <a href="../../../a/t/t/Attrition.html" title="Attrition">attrition</a>, the Germans could not have won." <i>Who acknowledges this?</i></p>
<p>Statements like this, maybe they are right, maybe not, but in all cases they need to be qualified with a reference or an explanation. How can we fix this passage so it is either referenced or qualified? - JQ 17:39, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Sorry for answering so late: I was pondering on what response would be best; your edit has now forced me to make up my mind&#160;:o).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>When referring to a "popular opinion", I was perhaps too ambiguous: what I meant was a "popular belief" among the greater part of the semi-informed public (the majority of humanity of course living happily along without being bothered by these issues). So I couldn't give a direct reference quote to <i>that</i>. We might of course, on a higher level, refer either to popular books perpetuating the myth in question or, on a higher level again, to serious publications lamenting it (both of which are quite numerous), but that would be beside the point. When stating "Contrary to popular belief, Caesar never said <i>veni, vidi, vici</i>" are we then supposed to proof that there is such a belief to begin with? Or could we simply work from a shared background knowledge — while tacitly suggesting to the reader who didn't share it, that he is invited to?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>A similar ambiguity laid in my use of "generally" — but now I didn't refer to the semi-informed, but to the informed only. Then the question "Who acknowledges this?" becomes easy to answer. There is a true consensus among experts that in an ideal battle of attrition those qualitative advantages the Germans might have had, were in any case not enough to compensenate for the lack of numerical superiority needed to overcome the tactical advantage of the defender. I know of no writer holding the opposite point of view. In this case it might of course be functional to give a quote; and yet it would again be a bit beside the point.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Now as to explanation, you are absolutely right. The article really needs an analysis of the military potential of both sides. But this is a contentious issue; treating it in the level of detail that is needed to prevent it from misleading the reader would make it far too long for a short section in Historiography. And this is the reason I presented it as a simple contrast between the myth that only the Germans were modernly equipped and the (by experts) uncontested truth that there was a general parity in equipment levels. That there are many pitfalls is shown by your own edit: you state that both sides were numerically roughly equal in armour. That is fully in line with all scientific literature. But more recent works for and by armour enthusiasts clearly show that the number of tanks and self-propelled guns actually committed to battle by the Allies was about 50% larger. The French materiel reserves had not properly been taken into account; also not a single "scientific" publication gives the correct production numbers. The situation with the respective airforces is even more complex. So I basically shrank away from <i>any</i> detail.&#160;:o)--MWAK 14:45, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Although I think the most recent edit is excellent and improves the article, I have to question the use of the term "main battle tank". I am not sure the concept existed at the time; if it did, none of the tanks then in use were so designated. Also, the majority of the tanks used by both sides were light tanks, not even mediums. I understand the general point being made, I just think we could make it a bit more accurately with slightly modified language.

<dd>Dear MWAK and DMorpheus, thank you for the notes. MWAK, I'll have to get back to your note later this week as I'm snowed under until at least Friday afternoon and you make many points I should think on for a bit. DMorpheus, you are probably making a good and valid point. The specific tanks I was thinking of when I wrote of the MBT's were French: B-1bis and Souma's; British Matalida's; and German Pzkw-III, Pzkw-IV and Pskw-38t's. But I think your point is correct and if you feel a revision is in order just go to it and set the passage right. JQ 05:09, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's a tough call, frankly. I don't think it is necessary to the article to get into this issue at all; it is a narrow technical issue that had no major influence on the campaign. So one option is to simply remove any reference to tank quality. On the other hand, many popular histories make the claim that the German tanks were somehow better or more numerous. I believe this may be what MWAK was getting at. Even if that broad statement were true (and it isn't really) it doesn't automatically follow that it had any real importance in the campaign. But in the immediate post-campaign period, it was used by Allied sources such as Churchill to explain away the shocking collapse of the French Army. It's always useful to dispel a myth.</dd>
<dd>Maybe the issue should be set in that context. Both the "Fifth Column" and German tank superiority were myths created to explain the duller truth - that the German Army out-thought and out-maneuvered the French, without any "magic bullets". <a href="../../../d/m/o/User%7EDMorpheus_f8a6.html" title="User:DMorpheus">DMorpheus</a> 15:17, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Italian troop numbers are given as 700,000 here; the CommandoSupremo site says 300,000. I will try to find a reliable figure. The 32-Division count appears correct, but there is no direct way to work out the troop numbers from that. They fought only for the last 11 days of the campaign, on a minor front, and accomplished virtually nothing, so I am not sure this should really be labeled an "Axis victory". It is literally correct but gives a false impression nonetheless. <a href="../../../d/m/o/User%7EDMorpheus_f8a6.html" title="User:DMorpheus">DMorpheus</a> 21:00, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I tend to agree. As I already pointed out to Kurt, the real number of divisions partcipating is about sixteen (non-reserve divisions of 1st and 4th Army). What really happened was that the Italian troops approached the French main positions, overran some outposts and halted their advance when taking losses. The number of troops in western North Italy was higher than one would expect though, as there were many smaller units, see <a href="http://www.comandosupremo.com/France.htmland" class="external free" title="http://www.comandosupremo.com/France.htmland" rel="nofollow">http://www.comandosupremo.com/France.htmland</a>&#160;; the units of 6th Army not allocated to the front armies were also in theatre and there was of course an extensive supply and training system. 300,000 is a good estimate for the front line units, 700,000 for the total of all soldiers present in theatre. --MWAK 08:16, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>THE ITALIAN FORCES (BATTLE OF THE ALPS): 4th Army (General Guzzoni) (Northern sector), with target Moutiers: 9 divisions and 3 alpine groups; 1st Army (General Pintor)(Southern sector), with target Nice: 13 divisions.

<p>The fact that Italians achieved little during the campaing does not change the facts. Italy was Germany's ally, one of the Axis, and France, Italy's enemy was defeated decisively, even if Italians achieved little during the campaing.</p>

<p>Should the listed sizes of the air forces reflect the amount possessed by France, or the amount actually used?

<dd><i>The Collapse of the Third Republic</i> is a very poor and outdated source. There are many ways to measure these numbers and perhaps it is fundamentally undecidable which way to use.

<dd>No, it needs to be completely rewritten. I should know: I wrote most of it in the first place&#160;:o). Especially the section about the German planning distorts the facts very severely. In February 2005 I left most of it untouched, hesitating to open that particular can of worms. Also we should notice that the "Historiography" gives all kinds of data that should really be treated in separate sections about French and German equipment and tactical doctrine. But that is an even bigger can of worms. The problem is that recent research has falsified many popular notions about the battle and that present research is debunking even more. We are in the middle of a paradigm shift in our thinking about what happened in the beginning of WWII. As could be expected, it was the German side that got the most attention. That put me in a difficult position while expanding the article: if I treated the subject in a correct encyclopedic way, by giving in detail the different views about it, the German side of things would get a more modern, or "revisionist" account, while the French side would still be rather outdated because profound research there is just beginning to get published. This would create a totally unbalanced representation of events. So I went for a more superficial consensus view, leaving much vague with a lot of hidden "sap verb" and glossing over most areas of contention. I'm glad it made for a good narrative but it is more illusion than substance...--MWAK 07:02, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, it's quite possible you're right. But to avoid an (equally possible) misunderstanding, could you indicate which (kind of) statements exactly you consider to be revisionist? It could be that the "facts" you refer to aren't hypotheses made by reputable historians but those to be found in popular literature, which happens to be of an extremely poor quality on this subject. So statements like "There was no general equipment imbalance between Germany and France" or "There was no serious fifth column activity" might seem "revisionist" to someone who has only read popular historical works, but have really always been mainstream. --MWAK 06:54, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There is no mention in the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_France_ab9b.html#Historiography" title="Battle of France">Historiography section</a> of the lack of adequate anti-tank weapons amoung the French infantry. They were equiped primarily with 25mm AT guns, which were useless against German tanks. Consequently the French infantry tended to melt away when attacked by Panzers. The French were well aware of this short coming before the war, and it was a major reason why over half of the French tanks were spread out all along the front, to provide support to the infantry. This resulted in the French tanks usually being outnumbered by the more concentrated German tanks. While the significance of this can be debated, I do not understand why it is not being mentioned at all. Madmax 8 August 2006</p>

<dd>Maybe it's not mentioned because it may not be accurate. Let's look at the data.</dd>

<dd>47mm AT gun agaionst armor sloped at 30 degrees: 39mm at 100 meters, 33mm at 500 meters.</dd>

</dd>
<dd>Armor protection
<dl>
<dd>Pzkw-II ausf C (the most common German tank in May 1940): 16mm turret front, 14mm sides, near vertical.</dd>
<dd>Pzkw-III ausf E (best German tank in May 1940): 30mm turret front, sides, hull front and sides, near vertical.</dd>
<dd>Pzkw-IV ausf D (best-protected German tank in May 1940, at least from the front): 35mm turret front, 30mm hull front, 20mm hull sides, near vertical.</dd>
<dd>We can ignore the thinly-armored but common Pzkw-I; IIRC protection on the numerous 35(t)s and 38(t)s was similar to the Pzkw-III.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Draw your own conclusions, but I would say if the French Infantry "melted away" it wasn't because their AT weapons wouldn't do the job. "Tank panic" was common in many Armies in the blitzkreig era.</dd>
<dd>French tank deployment has been discussed at length, but consider that the vast majority of French tanks (all except the B-1bis and S35) had guns *worse* than the towed weapons cited above. So why would they be deployed to defend against German tanks?</dd>
<dd>Finally, I would also add that most of the combatants of WW2 devoted a high percentage of their tanks to Infantry support; the Germans were the sole major exception to this.

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I generally agree with DMorpheus's points — and like to make a few comments of my own:</dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li>The French 25 mm anti-tank gun was indeed adequate to destroy all German tanks frontally, as it showed by doing so on several instances. The German penetration data mentioned are even somewhat pessimistic as they were based on thick test plates (and those of the very powerful 47 mm probably simply wrong, see: <a href="http://forum.axishistory.com/viewtopic.php?t=79218&amp;highlight=char" class="external free" title="http://forum.axishistory.com/viewtopic.php?t=79218&amp;highlight=char" rel="nofollow">http://forum.axishistory.com/viewtopic.php?t=79218&amp;highlight=char</a>&#160;:o). The problem was that there were sometimes too few available. It's true the 25 mm was easily deflected by sloped armour; but then the German tanks used a lot of vertical plates.</li>
<li>The fact that most French tanks were part of the <b>I</b>nfantry, the Weapon, has deceived many into concluding that they therefore were mainly used for infantry support. This description of their function is however very ambiguous. Certainly the tanks weren't "divided among the infantry" as an organic part of infantry units, such as a division or even an army corps. They were specialised <i>offensive</i> breakthrough vehicles that were <i>concentrated</i> into <i>independent</i> armoured units acting as a <i>reserve</i>; some, as the Armoured Divisions, on the highest operational level; others as <i>Groupements</i> of brigade strength on army level. When effecting the breakthrough they obviously had to cooperate with infantry and artillery. The problem for the French in this was not so much that the ties between armour and infantry were too close, but to the contrary that they were too weak as the armoured units had little or no organic infantry and artillery component and higher level training with infantry units had been rare, so that in the war coordination proved to be too slow. Never was a decision made on the strategic level to divide tanks to protect infantry against German tanks. On several occasions some commanders would split armoured units to bolster the front line. They were probably right in assuming it was better to prevent an enemy breakthrough than to try counterattacking with the Infantry armoured units that were ill-equipped for the encounter fight.</li>
<li>Official German doctrine prescribed that the armoured divisions be used for the exploitation phase — not the breakthrough, that had to be executed by the Infantry. Although after 1936 many Infantry Independent Armoured Brigades had been raised for infantry support, the last of these had been disbanded after the Polish campaign, not inspired by some doctrinal insight that tanks should be concentrated into <i>Panzerdivisionen</i> but because the Infantry, then the dominant Weapon, hadn't much faith in tanks anyway. They, correctly, assumed that superior training would enable German infantry to break the enemy lines without armour support. Besides, the PzKpfw Is that had been made available were of little value. They waited for enough <i>Sturmgeschütze</i> to be build to give some really effective support. This also means that, contrary to popular accounts, the French doctrine had a larger emphasis on mechanisation than the German: both used armour for exploitation, but only the French for the breakthrough phase. And this again explains why German tank production lagged behind the French.</li>
<li>As a result in May 1940 German armour made relatively little contact with French infantry, considering the scale of the campaign. The fortified lines at Sedan and Monthermé were not broken by tanks but by infantry (in the first case crucially supported by carpet bombing). At Dinant there simply was no fortified line. In The Netherlands 9PD made almost no contact with Dutch troops. German armour avoided heavily defended zones if possible, so the quality of French anti-tank guns was basically irrelevant. If all French divisions would have been equipped with 72 90mm direct fire guns, the outcome would probably have been the same. On the one occasion in May where a fortified line <i>was</i> attacked however (against higher orders), it ended in failure: on 15 May 4PD was repulsed by the 47 mm guns of the 1st Moroccan Infantry Division, losing some 120 vehicles.</li>

<p>These are valid points, I don't agree with all of them, but they are interesting. However my point is not whether or not the AT guns really affected the campaign, but rather that many historians have CLAIMED they were a major cause of the French defeat, and thus they should be included in the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_France_ab9b.html#Historiography" title="Battle of France">Historiography section</a>, perhaps along with a refutation. This has been done with many other claimed causes of the defeat. Madmax 9 August 2006</p>

<p><br />
I´d like to point out fe few things that should be changed.</p>
<p>Equipment imbalances:</p>
<p>It says “In armor protection and penetrating power of main armament many of the French and British tanks were actually superior to their German counterparts.” That´s not correct. The part about the armor protection is right, but not the one about the armament. French AFV were armed with four different guns:</p>
<p>1.The 25mm gun: Does not sound like much, but it could kill any german tank at distances up to 700 meters.</p>
<p>2.The 47mm gun: One of the most powerful Tank/AT-guns at that time. Killed german tanks at up to 1500 meters.</p>
<p>3.The 37mm gun SA-38: The typical 37mm gun, not as powerful as the 47mm, but unlike the 25mm it could fire HE shells.</p>
<p>4.The 37mm gun SA-18: Obsolete gun from WW1. It was ok for firing HE, but with a muzzle velocity of just 388 m/s it was totally useless against tanks.</p>
<p>And now guess what the most common gun was. For more detailed information take a look at what David Lehmann wrote on axishistory.com: <a href="http://forum.axishistory.com/viewtopic.php?t=90110&amp;highlight=&amp;sid=53858171aa54a8403aa96f254dd87b18" class="external free" title="http://forum.axishistory.com/viewtopic.php?t=90110&amp;highlight=&amp;sid=53858171aa54a8403aa96f254dd87b18" rel="nofollow">http://forum.axishistory.com/viewtopic.php?t=90110&amp;highlight=&amp;sid=53858171aa54a8403aa96f254dd87b18</a></p>
<p>And one most important factors is not mentioned at all. The German tanks had three men turrets, while almost all of the French ones had one man turrets. As a result the commander/gunner/loader was totally overworked and could do neither of his jobs properly.</p>
<p>Poor strategy:</p>
<p>The forces General Gamelin sent noth to defend the Netherlands were his only reserves. As a result the French had to defend a frontage of several hundred kilometres without any mobile reserves. This was a flagrant violation of the french doctrine, but in spite of criticism form other high ranking Generals nothing was done to correct this mistake. Markus Becker 16:43, 13 August 2006 (CET) By the way, how do I add my name , date and time of the posting automatically?</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>To add your name automatically just type four tildes (four of these ~) at the end of your post. It makes for much better communication.</dd>
<dd>Now as to your points, I am sorry, the original language is not incorrect. Both the original sentence and your post make generalizations, while we should perhaps be more specific. It is certainly true that "many" British and French tanks had better firepower than many of their German counterparts. The French S35 and B-1 tanks, and any of the British cruisers, had guns that could penetrate any of the German tanks at long range (by 1940 standards). You are correct that the *most common* tank gun on the French side was the SA18 37mm, but that does not contradict the original sentence at all. You might want to add, as an aside, that some of the French light recon tanks such as the AMR series were armed only with rifle-caliber MGs. So your list of French tank guns is not complete.</dd>
<dd>What was the most common German tank gun? Was it not the 20mm on the Panzer II&#160;?</dd>
<dd>As to the German tanks: Many had three-man turrets, but the majority did not. The most common German tanks in 1940 were the Panzer II, Panzer I, and the ex-Czech 35(t) and 38(t). The excellent Panzer III with its three-man turret was a distinct minority of tank types, with a few hundred available. Although it was probably the best tank on either side, it is no more accurate to generalize from the Panzer III to all German tanks than it would be to generalize from the B-1 to all French tanks. Even in June 1941 less than half the German tanks were Panzer IIIs. Likewise with the Panzer IV, only a few hundred were present.</dd>
<dd>To take the most common French tank gun, the SA18, and compare it to the most common German tank, the Panzer II, we see that, far from being useless, the SA18 firing APC can penetrate the frontal 16mm armor of the Panzer II at ranges beyond 500 yards, and can get a side penetration against the 14mm armor at 1000 yards. Compared to the most common tanks being fielded in 1941 or 1942, yes, the SA18 is pretty useless, but in 1940 it was not scrap metal.</dd>
<dd>As to the British tanks, the 2-pounder had better performance that the German or Czech 37mm, good enough to penetrate any of the German tanks at long range.</dd>
<dd>As for armor protection, again we are all generalizing. The tiny number of British Infantry tanks and the French cavalry S35 and battle tank B-1 were much better protected than any of the German vehicles of any weight.</dd>
<dd>Finally, of course, none of this was decisive, or even of great importance, in the campaign. <a href="../../../d/m/o/User%7EDMorpheus_f8a6.html" title="User:DMorpheus">DMorpheus</a> 15:21, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Nevertheless this sentence creates a wrong impression. Let´s concentrate on the modern tanks. As David pointed out the French had 2,300, the Germans had roughly 1,000. But while all of the modern german tanks had decent guns, almost 2/3 of the French did not. As far as the absolute numbers are concerned the French had even less decently armed Tanks than the Germans. So it should say “in penetrating power of main armament most of the French tanks were inferior to their german counterparts, except for obsolete tanks like Pz.I and II.” By the way, I don´t find this "~" on my keyboard.

<p>Again I agree with DMorpheus — and again I'd like to add a few things&#160;:o):</p>
<ol>
<li>David Lehmann wrote this in early 2002. He today perhaps would put a lesser emphasis on the material factors. Certainly he made some mistakes, as including the German command tanks and excluding the AMR 33 and 35s from the tank numbers just because they were called <i>automitrailleuse</i>; also it should be mentioned that the French had far larger materiel reserves than the Germans. The French had about 3700 modern tanks in France. When the campaign ended the allied forces had committed about 2300 AFVs with a reasonable anti-tank capacity to battle, the Germans less than 1300. The 37 mm SA18 was in itself of course a very poor gun to fight other armour, especially since many PzKpfw IIs had been uparmoured to 30 mm; however this depended strongly on the type of ammunition used; many of the cavalry 37 mm SA18 guns were modified to fire a superior type.</li>
<li>The sentence as you give it would be equally deceptive. The situation was that the majority of both French and German tanks was obsolescent and underarmed. However those French tanks that weren't were superior in firepower to their German counterparts (being the PzKpfw 35(t), 38(t), III and IV). They were slightly less in number: about 1000 to 1100, including materiel reserves. And to the French tanks we should add about 500 British and Belgian AFVs with 40 or 47 mm guns.</li>
<li>What you wrote about the strategy was as such completely correct, but partly implied by the text as it stands and certainly largely made explicit in what was written before. To speak in defence of Gamelin it should be added that he had good reasons to try to maintain a connection with the Dutch: he knew that when the Nazi regime hadn't collapsed in 1941 he would have to take the offensive himself. The prospect of assaulting the Siegfried Line frontally didn't appeal to him at all, so like Montgomery four years later he intended to go around the <i>Westwall</i> on its northern flank. For this it would be extremely convenient to already have a toehold on the northern bank of the Rhine. It's true that the article is deficient in the treatment of both the German and the French development of strategy. As it happens I'm writing a Dutch version which discusses these subjects more adequately and I hope to improve this one when I'm finished.--MWAK 18:10, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><i>There was however a materièl reserve of about 3000 aircraft on the continent</i> this is incorrect. These figures were first published by former Air Minister Pierre Cot, who was in office from 1936 on. Cot's point was, basically, to prove that he provided the Armée de l'air with more than enough aircraft, and it was solely the commanders' fault if the Allies did not manage to establish air superiority during the campaign. As said on the French wiki <i>Profondément touché par la défaite française de mai 1940, il essaiera durant sa vie entière d'en comprendre les raisons et de prouver que l'aviation n'est pas le principal artisan de cette défaite.</i></p>
<p>For a less biased account of the Armée de l'air strenght, we can use Patrick Facon's book as a source.

<dd>Read carefully: it doesn't say this was the <i>French</i> materièl reserve&#160;:o) That was about 2000 according to most sources. French operational strength was about 800-900. The numbers I gave are those of all Allies combined. However I agree that the most recent numbers should be mentioned, especially as those sources might well have confused total production numbers with actually available aircraft.--MWAK 17:57, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>We have to balance interpretations like this one by Kirkland:</dd>
</dl>
<p><i>Possibly because of their disenchantment with the government for using their service as a political toy, the aviators were unable or unwilling to believe that they might be provided with more than a handful of additional aircraft. Thus, when the director of aircraft production advised General Vuillemin, the chief of the air force, in January 1939 that 370 to 600 aircraft per month would come from French factories in 1940, the general said the air force required only 40 to 60. There were not enough aircrews or ground crews for a larger number, and to expand the training program would require the efforts of the entire strength of the air force. In March, Vuillemin agreed to accept 330 aircraft per month. However, even by using forty- to forty-five-year-old reservists to fly in first-line combat units, he could not fully man his units after mobilization. The availability of aircrews became the limiting factor on the number of units that Vuillemin could field, and the physical capacities of his aging pilots became the limiting factor on how frequently the aircraft would fly.</i></p>
<p><i>To keep from being buried under the flood of aircraft pouring from the factories, the air staff imposed multiple requirements for modifications, conducted complex acceptance inspections, and kept key components (guns, propellers, and radios) separated from the aircraft on which they were to be installed. Aircraft newly arrived from America were let in their crates. Still the air force received many more aircraft than it could man, and the air staff had to conceal the surfeit from prying parliamentary eyes by dispersing brand-new, combat-ready planes to remote airfields far from the battle zone.</i></p>
<dl>
<dd>To the contrary, if we go by Facon's interpretation, we have a reserve of just 500 planes&#160;:o).--MWAK 20:35, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Kirkland amazes me, how can people take him seriously when he writes <i>To keep from being buried under the flood of aircraft pouring from the factories, the air staff imposed multiple requirements for modifications, conducted complex acceptance inspections, and kept key components (guns, propellers, and radios) separated from the aircraft on which they were to be installed.</i> Yes, of course, numerous authors have demonstrated how the Armée de l'air's management of new planes effectively acted a bottleneck between factories and operational units. However, there are multiple reasons for this, the most logical for me being the typically French military paranoia. Secret equipment such as radio sets, gunsights and obviously guns were not to be handled by untrustworthy and possibly communist civilians. But to argue that the Armée de l'air set up that bottleneck <i>on purpose</i> is just ludicrous. Vuillemin was painfully aware that his equipment was outdated! On the personnel side of things, of course, the Armée de l'air could not double its size overnight. Older reservists trained on biplanes failed to convert on the new generation of high wing-loading aircraft, and training programs set up after the declaration of war were simply too late for this phase of the war. For more references on the Armée de l'air of the time I suggest reading Ehrenghardt or Facon or Danel - unfortunately little decent stuff has been published in English on the subject. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../p/p/p/User%7EPpPachy_9184.html" title="User:PpPachy">PpPachy</a> (<a href="../../../p/p/p/User_talk%7EPpPachy_276f.html" title="User talk:PpPachy">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_PpPachy_ad6d.html" title="Special:Contributions/PpPachy">contribs</a>) 21:18, 11 February 2007 (UTC).</small></dd>

<dd>I can only agree. Indeed, from a quantative point of view French aircraft production was clearly too low: if the training facilities <i>had</i> been adequate they would have lost so many planes through accidents that it would quickly have depleted stocks.

<dd>All very true, but precisely because the German victory was more specific, it is more informative to say it was an Axis victory. For this implies in this context that Germany took part, whereas just saying that it was a German victory obviously doesn't imply Italy took part, a bit of information (often forgotten) which is then lost to the reader. That the German effort was more predominant probably doesn't need to be stressed&#160;;o).--MWAK 08:58, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>As yet I am not persuaded by your line of argument, because it implies that every battle fought in World War II should be labeled either an Axis or Allied victory. I think that is far less informative than crediting the victory to the major participants. Obviously if there is a large proportion of the troops from more than one participating state than it should be labeled an Axis or Allied victory, but not otherwise.

<dl>
<dd>Well, firstly it isn't a matter of credit. It's not the task of an encyclopedia to say things like "Well done, Germany, for beating France". Secondly, if indeed in any battle troops from several nations actually participated, it is more informative to call the reader's attention to this, than only name the major participant, the identity of which will surely be abundantly clear from the article itself.--MWAK 11:35, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>The battle box is meant to be a summary of the article. So if it is abundantly clear from the article then the battle box should say the same thing. Another way of doing it is to count the casualties on both sides. If the number of dead of one of the participating forces is not a significant percentage of the casualties (on their side) then that is a fairly good indicator of how heavily engaged in a battle an ally was. In this case what % of the Axis forces casualties were made up of Italians? --<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Baird_Shearer_a81d.html" title="User:Philip Baird Shearer">Philip Baird Shearer</a> 17:22, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, when calling it an Axis victory the battle box <i>would</i> say the same thing, given that the context is known. Of course this depends on whether people even know what "Axis" means. I'm personally not very optimistic about this, so perhaps you'r e right when simply calling it a German victory&#160;;o).

<p>I think the casualties give are incorrect. There is a difference between those captured in battle and those who fall into the hands of the adversary following surrender or mass capitulation.

This term is also used in the opening sentence of Article 4, replacing the expression "captured" which was used in the 1929 Convention (Article 1). It indicates clearly that the treatment laid down by the Convention is applicable not only to military personnel taken prisoner in the course of fighting, but also to those who fall into the hands of the adversary following surrender or mass capitulation.</p>
<p>So those French soldiers who fell into "hands of the adversary following surrender" are not casualties of the Battle of France and the numbers of casualties should only include those captured during the battle. --<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Baird_Shearer_a81d.html" title="User:Philip Baird Shearer">Philip Baird Shearer</a> 17:33, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Obviously they aren't casualties as such, as this term simply doesn't include those captured. I presume the battle box heading is "casualties" because "losses" could also include materièl losses. However I'm a bit puzzled by your reference to the convention, the point of its legal norms being precisely that although a distinction <i>could</i> be made between those captured during an immediate fight and those involved in a mass surrender, this distinction is irrelevant to the convention. This does not imply that distinction would, in contrast, be very relevant in other contexts. The real point is however that the number of 1.9 million <i>is</i> indeed the number of French soldiers actually taken prisoner until 25 June 1940. The almost four million men belonging to the French armed forces in metropolitan France that evaded capture are not included.--MWAK 18:13, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Casualties should include those captured, but not those who fall into the hands of the enemy after a general capitulation. The point of quoting GCIII commentary is to show that the distinction does exist in laws of law (and is not a figment of my imagination), so only those captured during the battle should be included in the causality lists not others. I am not sure if the figure should include those captured after June 22, as that is when the article says the fighting stopped. However the article should make it clear that the figure is only those captured up to 25th. BTW what is the source that the numbers are those captured, and that it does not include those who fell into the hands of an enemy power? --<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Baird_Shearer_a81d.html" title="User:Philip Baird Shearer">Philip Baird Shearer</a> 19:16, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, the article is as yet wrong on this point: the fighting stopped only on 25 June. The Armistice conditions basically stipulated that Germany would not take the remnant prisoner, so there simply was no mass surrender in that sense&#160;:o). France was even treated rather harshly in this respect: Germany let go the entire Dutch army.--MWAK 07:40, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The air effort above the Meuse Bridgehands around Sedan was almost entirely British, because the <i>Armée de l'air</i> only had approximately 30 bombers available this morning, due to losses of the 3 previous days, and general shortage of modern planes. Therefore the French bomber losses in the area are as follows: one LeO.451 (shot down by fighters) and one Amiot 143. All other bombers lost in the Area were British, Battles and Blenheims of the AASF, plus some Blenheims flying directly from England.

<dd>Well, the section, if you go back to study <i>its</i> history&#160;:o), started as an attempt to put all kind of theories about the subject safely away under the nomer "Historiography" to hide the fact it was full of unbalanced points of view (now you know why). It then grew considerably — showing it was quite effective in this function&#160;:o). Of course a good article really shouldn't need such a section: cause cannot be seperated from effect and if the course of events is adequately described all questions about causality should be answered. However there is in this case indeed an enormous amount of interpretative literature about the subject with distinct phases and fashions, so this article would need a real historiography section. I've recently rewritten much of it, going from top to bottom and in the end I hoped to tackle this particular subject, throwing out those issues adequately decribed and restructuring with proper references those parts that are of a real historiographic nature. Keeping the old title until it is justified by the content would prevent a new one from obstructing the justification process&#160;;o).--MWAK 18:11, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>At least four men in this picture are obviously French, including the first of the line. More significantly, this picture isn't at all from Dunkirk, but was actually taken in Veules-les-Roses near St. Valéry-en-Caux. Hard to say from this one, but there are wider views of these prisoners with common background elements, for example here: <a href="http://saintvalerymai1940.ifrance.com/prisonniers-Veules.gif" class="external autonumber" title="http://saintvalerymai1940.ifrance.com/prisonniers-Veules.gif" rel="nofollow">[5]</a></p>
<p>(a different one was also published in <i>Militaria Magazine hors-série</i> n°31, Histoire &amp; Collections, 1998, p. 73) By comparing these with both older and recent pictures of Veules-les-Roses as found <a href="http://www.geog.sussex.ac.uk/BAR/images/Pictures-France%202003/pourville%20to%20fecamp/Page.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.geog.sussex.ac.uk/BAR/images/Pictures-France%202003/pourville%20to%20fecamp/Page.html" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> here, there is no doubt. <a href="../../../p/p/p/User%7EPpPachy_9184.html" title="User:PpPachy">PpPachy</a> 00:05, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Germany did not have 45 Reserve Divisions, which is where the problem arises. Only the sixteen divisions of the 2nd Wave were once known as Reserve Divisions (as they were raised from Reserve regiments). The 20 Divisions of the 3rd wave were Landwehr (formed from Landwehr Regiments). etc. It is very hard for me to tell what those <b>45 reserve divisions</b> in the West are supposed to represent, particularly if <b>most would not see any real fighting</b>. The term Reserve Divisions really had gone out of use in Germany by the time the war started. Which is why I assume these are the divisions in the Reserve of the OKH (including divisions in formation that number seems about right (39 + 9), though a number of these were not in the West).</p>
<p>By the way, there is no way for German forces to achieve the number of 93 front line divisions without counting the divisions of the 2nd and later waves (the first wave had 39 divisions, including the motorised ones, add 10 Panzer, 1 Cavalry and 3 Mountain (2 in Norway) which leaves you at 53 divisions).--<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECaranorn_eafd.html" title="User:Caranorn">Caranorn</a> 12:22, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Indeed they did not have the official designation "reserve division" and obviously the number of 93 is not the total of prewar active divisions — I hope that this is made quite clear by the text as it is. The number of 45 is debatable; Frieser e.g. uses the number 42. The total of the official OKH reserves, minus 22nd <i>Luftlandedivision</i>, is 39 but the OKH reserves also would be released in response from demands by the Army Groups to increase their operational reserve and had been given a possible destination beforehand. It is for this reason that I objected to the statement that they were in "Strategic Reserve". Not only did they not form <i>a</i> strategic reserve, they also weren't really committed in reponse to considerations on the deeper strategic level. Nevertheless I have to admit that the OKH reserves of course formally <i>were</i> in strategic reserve — though it is not a point, I feel, that should be stressed&#160;:o). I'll change the text to clarify.--MWAK 20:01, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Okay I now understand your point. Interestingly enough both sides treated their supposedly strategic reserve (reserve of the OKH and reserve of the GQG) in a similar way, feeding it unit by unit into combat with little strategic planning.--<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECaranorn_eafd.html" title="User:Caranorn">Caranorn</a> 20:50, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Note, I believe more then 5 of those OKH reserve divisions were committed to the frontline armies and corps, but it's quite possible that few saw real action. But to get exact numbers I'd have to annalyse unit presence with the various field armies in June (Verbände und Truppen, though I believe a <i>Schematische Kriegsgliederung</i> of that date also survived), but I believe that would be borderline original research.--<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECaranorn_eafd.html" title="User:Caranorn">Caranorn</a> 20:55, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You're right: I was focussed too much on May&#160;:oS. In June the majority of them was in France and only a third was more or less kept out of the fighting. We'll change it again&#160;:o).--MWAK 07:04, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
