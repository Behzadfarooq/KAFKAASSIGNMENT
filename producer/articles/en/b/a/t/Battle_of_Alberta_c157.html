<p>The rivalry between the two cities dates back to the 1880s when the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_Pacific_Railway_f10d.html" title="Canadian Pacific Railway">Canadian Pacific Railway</a> suddenly shifted its planned route across <a href="../../../w/e/s/Western_Canada_90a7.html" title="Western Canada">Western Canada</a> from a northern one (via Edmonton) to a more southerly path (via Calgary). The next major battle between the two cities was to see which would become Alberta's <a href="../../../c/a/p/Capital_city.html" title="Capital city">capital city</a> when the province was created in 1905. Edmonton was the eventual victor, and as well Edmonton's neighbour, <a href="../../../o/l/d/Old_Strathcona_de33.html" title="Old Strathcona">Strathcona</a> won the right to host the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Alberta_6b63.html" title="University of Alberta">University of Alberta</a> (see below). The last important battle was over economic leadership, especially in the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_Oil_Patch_82e9.html" title="Canadian Oil Patch">Oilpatch</a>. Calgary's nearby <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turner_Valley%2C_Alberta_7b18.html" title="Turner Valley, Alberta">Turner Valley</a> deposits were discovered in 1914, well ahead of Edmonton's <a href="../../../d/e/v/Devon%2C_Alberta_b22c.html" title="Devon, Alberta">Leduc #1</a> field in 1947. This in part accounts for the predominance of corporate head offices in the city of Calgary. Edmonton is an also-ran in terms of the corporate oil sector, but with the help of government and university influence it is arguably the artistic and cultural hub of Alberta. Edmonton has also become the research and manufacturing centre of the Canadian petroleum industry, and roughly 80% of Canada's oil production is sent to market through one of Edmonton's many refineries. Although the rivalry is generaly only shown during sporting events there is an 'unspoken' rivalry between residants on general days.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Alberta_c157.html" title="Edit section: Ice hockey">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Ice hockey</span></h2>
<p>The first professional hockey rivalry between the two cities dates to the founding of the <a href="../../../w/e/s/Western_Canada_Hockey_League_356f.html" title="Western Canada Hockey League">Western Canada Hockey League</a> in 1921. Both cities received teams, Calgary the <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calgary_Tigers_6aad.html" title="Calgary Tigers">Tigers</a>, and Edmonton the <a href="../../../e/d/m/Edmonton_Eskimos_%28hockey%29_31b3.html" title="Edmonton Eskimos (hockey)">Eskimos</a>. The Eskimos won the WCHL title in 1923, but lost the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stanley_Cup_a81d.html" title="Stanley Cup">Stanley Cup</a> to the rival <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Hockey_League_6c9a.html" title="National Hockey League">National Hockey League</a>'s <a href="../../../o/t/t/Ottawa_Senators_%28original%29_e59d.html" title="Ottawa Senators (original)">Ottawa Senators</a>. Calgary also appeared in a Stanley Cup championship series in 1924, but lost to the <a href="../../../m/o/n/Montreal_Canadiens_e9b9.html" title="Montreal Canadiens">Montreal Canadiens</a> of the NHL. After the demise of the WCHL in 1927, Alberta hockey fans turned to junior hockey. Both cities had teams in the <a href="../../../w/e/s/Western_Hockey_League_6e9f.html" title="Western Hockey League">Western Hockey League</a> and <a href="../../../a/l/b/Alberta_Junior_Hockey_League_6673.html" title="Alberta Junior Hockey League">Alberta Junior Hockey League</a>.</p>
<p>Pro hockey did not return until the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Hockey_Association_fb62.html" title="World Hockey Association">World Hockey Association</a> arrived in 1972. Both cities received teams, but Calgary's <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calgary_Broncos_f0e2.html" title="Calgary Broncos">Broncos</a> folded without playing a game. The new <a href="../../../e/d/m/Edmonton_Oilers_2a78.html" title="Edmonton Oilers">Edmonton Oilers</a>, then were left without an intra-provincial rival until a new WHA team, the <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calgary_Cowboys_3765.html" title="Calgary Cowboys">Calgary Cowboys</a> arrived in 1975, but they folded after two years. The short and sporadic nature of the Calgary WHA franchises made building meaningful rivalries more difficult. The WHA itself was unstable and merged with the NHL in 1979.</p>
<p><a name="Oilers_vs._Flames" id="Oilers_vs._Flames"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Alberta_c157.html" title="Edit section: Oilers vs. Flames">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Oilers vs. Flames</span></h3>
<p>In recent years, one of the most intense and passionate expressions of this rivalry is the frequent matchups between the professional NHL hockey clubs based in each city - the <a href="../../../e/d/m/Edmonton_Oilers_2a78.html" title="Edmonton Oilers">Edmonton Oilers</a> and the <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calgary_Flames_a592.html" title="Calgary Flames">Calgary Flames</a>.</p>
<p>The Oilers joined the NHL as one of the teams making the switch from the World Hockey Association in 1979, and they were soon followed by the Atlanta Flames moving to Calgary in 1980, making the question of who would reign as the top team in Alberta a hot topic. The Flames were the dominant squad during their inaugural season, making it to the conference final, while the Oilers were making headlines with their young superstar, <a href="../../../w/a/y/Wayne_Gretzky_af9c.html" title="Wayne Gretzky">Wayne Gretzky</a>. The Oilers' <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stanley_Cup_a81d.html" title="Stanley Cup">Stanley Cup</a> Championship in 1984 set the building blocks for the last dynasty of the NHL. They repeated as champions in 1985, 1987, 1988, and 1990, with lineups that featured legends like <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grant_Fuhr_bfa0.html" title="Grant Fuhr">Grant Fuhr</a>, <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Coffey_201e.html" title="Paul Coffey">Paul Coffey</a>, and <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mark_Messier_fe55.html" title="Mark Messier">Mark Messier</a>. The Flames won the Cup in 1989 with <a href="../../../l/a/n/Lanny_McDonald_898d.html" title="Lanny McDonald">Lanny McDonald</a>, <a href="../../../d/o/u/Doug_Gilmour_45fb.html" title="Doug Gilmour">Doug Gilmour</a> and <a href="../../../m/i/k/Mike_Vernon_f228.html" title="Mike Vernon">Mike Vernon</a> leading them.</p>
<p>The Oilers defeated the Flames in the playoffs in 1983, 1984, 1988, and 1991. However, the Flames did get their moral victory; the infamous 1986 Battle of Alberta was decided by an own-goal by Oiler Steve Smith. The Flames were heavily favoured in the 1988 playoffs, but the Oilers quickly disposed of them in a four-game sweep. 1991 was last year the teams met in the playoffs, and it went to the limit. Esa Tikkanen led the underdog Oilers to victory in overtime with his third goal of the game. It is often cited as one of the most exciting playoff series of all time.</p>
<p>Due to the sheer talent and skill exhibited by both teams in the mid to late-1980s, Alberta was considered somewhat of a "Death Valley" for teams coming to play on a road trip, especially those of the other conference. With the fortunes of both teams taking a slide during the 1990s, the rivalry cooled off. The passions ignited in the 1980s playoff sagas would only make brief appearances during the regular season. Recently, however, it seems the rivalry has been somewhat reignited, with the Flames' Stanley Cup Finals appearance in 2004 and the Oilers' subsequent appearance in 2006; however, the recent regular season battles have been in Calgary's favour. The 2005-2006 season series was won by the Flames, 5 wins to 2 losses, and the 2006-2007 regular season battle has thus far been decidedly in the Flames' favour, as they are currently winning the season series 5 to 2.</p>
<p>Its ironic because of the current Team Captains are born in the opposite town. <a href="../../../j/a/s/Jason_Smith_4bd4.html" title="Jason Smith">Jason Smith</a> born in Calgary, while <a href="../../../j/a/r/Jarome_Iginla_1c93.html" title="Jarome Iginla">Jarome Iginla</a> was born in Edmonton.</p>

<p>The rivalry between the cities' professional <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_Football_League_451d.html" title="Canadian Football League">CFL</a> football teams is equally intense, and predates the Oilers-Flames feud, at least back to the <a href="../../../1/9/3/1938_in_Canadian_football_692c.html" title="1938 in Canadian football">1938 season</a> of the <a href="../../../w/e/s/Western_Interprovincial_Football_Union_2c70.html" title="Western Interprovincial Football Union">Western Interprovincial Football Union</a>.

Calgary won the <a href="../../../c/h/a/Champion%27s_Cup_3d08.html" title="Champion's Cup">Champion's Cup</a> in 2004 while Edmonton's first win came in Calgary with only .2 seconds left in the game.</p>

<p>Another prominent rivalry exists between the major universities in each city, notably the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Alberta_6b63.html" title="University of Alberta">University of Alberta</a>, in Edmonton, and the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Calgary_4bce.html" title="University of Calgary">University of Calgary</a>. This dates back to the early 20th century, when Calgarians were put off by the building of the University of Alberta in Edmonton in 1908. As the story goes, the location of the university was to be decided along the same lines as that of <a href="../../../s/a/s/Saskatchewan.html" title="Saskatchewan">Saskatchewan</a>. (The province of Saskatchewan shares the same founding date as Alberta, 1905.) Saskatchewan had to please two competing cities when deciding the location of its capital city and provincial university. Thus, <a href="../../../r/e/g/Regina%2C_Saskatchewan_e128.html" title="Regina, Saskatchewan">Regina</a> was designated the provincial capital and <a href="../../../s/a/s/Saskatoon%2C_Saskatchewan_cc87.html" title="Saskatoon, Saskatchewan">Saskatoon</a> received the provincial university, the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Saskatchewan_dd26.html" title="University of Saskatchewan">University of Saskatchewan</a>. The same heated wrangling over the location of the provincial capital also took place in Alberta between the cities of Calgary and Edmonton. In the end, Edmonton was designated as the capital of Alberta. A city south of Edmonton did end up with the provincial university. However, it was not Calgary. Instead, the city of Strathcona, located south across the river from Edmonton, received the provincial university. The municipalities of Edmonton and Strathcona were later amalgamated in 1912 into what is now known as the city of Edmonton. To this day, Calgarians feel frustrated by this political sleight of hand.(<a href="http://www.ucalgary.ca/pres/22337_flash/index.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ucalgary.ca/pres/22337_flash/index.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>) Calgary was not granted a university until 1966. Competitions between the two universities have taken place over who has possession of a painted rock. The University of Alberta has consistently ranked much higher than the University of Calgary in all national and international rankings of Universities.</p>

<p>Alberta's most prominent baseball rivalry existed between the <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calgary_Cannons_9ce5.html" title="Calgary Cannons">Calgary Cannons</a> and <a href="../../../e/d/m/Edmonton_Trappers_e4a2.html" title="Edmonton Trappers">Edmonton Trappers</a> of the <a href="../../../p/a/c/Pacific_Coast_League_795c.html" title="Pacific Coast League">Pacific Coast League</a>. The Cannons existed from 1985 to 2002 while the Trappers existed from 1980 to 2004. The rivalry never reached the same level as it did in other sports, and ultimately both teams relocated to the United States. The Trappers would capture four PCL championships during their run, the Cannons won none.</p>
<p>Today, the two cities compete in the <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northern_League_%28baseball%29_df91.html" title="Northern League (baseball)">Northern League</a> as the <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calgary_Vipers_a70a.html" title="Calgary Vipers">Calgary Vipers</a> and <a href="../../../e/d/m/Edmonton_Cracker_Cats_1185.html" title="Edmonton Cracker Cats">Edmonton Cracker Cats</a>, who both came into the league as expansion cousins in 2005.</p>

<p>The origins of and effects of the political leanings of the two cities are intertwined with and as old as the rivalry itself. When the CPR shifted its route southward, Canada was governed by the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conservative_Party_of_Canada_%28historic%29_e5a6.html" title="Conservative Party of Canada (historic)">Conservatives</a> who had generously supported the railway - this helped entrench a loyalty to the <a href="../../../t/o/r/Tories.html" title="Tories">Tories</a> in Calgary that persisted even during the early days of Confederation when most of <a href="../../../w/e/s/Western_Canada_90a7.html" title="Western Canada">Western Canada</a> was solidly <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberal_Party_of_Canada_1b0c.html" title="Liberal Party of Canada">Liberal</a>. Few federal Liberal MPs have ever gained election from Calgary, and none have served more than a single term. However, when the Liberals gained power they championed not one but two more transcontinental railways, both of which passed through Edmonton. The result was boom times and massive immigration in and around Edmonton, which quickly displaced Calgary as Alberta's largest city and became solidly Liberal. As a direct result of these leanings, the Liberal government in Ottawa designated Edmonton the provincial capital in 1905.</p>
<p>These political leanings have persisted over the years. Undoubtedly, Calgary's conservative politics have been entrenched by the migration of corporate head offices to the city. Although <a href="../../../l/a/b/Labour_Party_of_Canada_a0dc.html" title="Labour Party of Canada">Labour</a> and <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_Credit_Party_of_Canada_349d.html" title="Social Credit Party of Canada">Social Credit</a> made inroads in the 1920s and 1930s, it was the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Progressive_Conservative_Party_of_Canada_d0d3.html" title="Progressive Conservative Party of Canada">Progressive Conservatives</a> who dominated federal elections in Calgary, with few exceptions, until the <a href="../../../r/e/f/Reform_Party_of_Canada_d10e.html" title="Reform Party of Canada">Reform Party</a> swept the federal Tories out of Alberta in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1993.html" title="1993">1993</a>. Reform and its successor, the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_Alliance_ea7c.html" title="Canadian Alliance">Canadian Alliance</a> continued to dominate in Calgary (and Alberta) until merging with the PCs to form the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conservative_Party_of_Canada_de3b.html" title="Conservative Party of Canada">Conservative Party of Canada</a>, which continues to dominate in Calgary's eight ridings.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the stronger government and university presence in Edmonton has helped to keep the city on the political left, at least by Albertan standards. In federal politics, Edmonton remained friendly to the Liberals in early decades, although in recent decades Edmonton's federal ridings have tended to follow the trend set by the rest of Alberta, usually electing Social Credit, PC, Reform, CA and finally Conservative MPs although usually by much reduced pluralities than those found in Calgary. However, the federal <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Democratic_Party_ef87.html" title="New Democratic Party">New Democratic Party</a> won their only Albertan seat <a href="../../../a/s/_/As_of_2006.html" title="As of 2006">as of 2006</a> in Edmonton in 1988. The Liberals then achieved their first real success in Edmonton in decades in 1993 when four Liberals were elected compared to three Reformers. Two of these Liberals, <a href="../../../a/n/n/Anne_McLellan_9be5.html" title="Anne McLellan">Anne McLellan</a> and <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Kilgour_48c8.html" title="David Kilgour">David Kilgour</a> managed to win re-election in Edmonton three times each before being defeated and retiring, respectively in the face of the Tory sweep of Alberta in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>.</p>
<p>In provincial politics the political differences are more noticeable. The <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_Credit_Party_of_Alberta_15ae.html" title="Social Credit Party of Alberta">Social Credit Party of Alberta</a> dominated most of Alberta's ridings, including Edmonton and Calgary, for most of the time it governed from <a href="../../../1/9/3/1935.html" title="1935">1935</a> until <a href="../../../1/9/7/1971.html" title="1971">1971</a>. When the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Progressive_Conservative_Association_of_Alberta_fa5a.html" title="Progressive Conservative Association of Alberta">Progressive Conservatives</a> under Calgarian <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Lougheed_f179.html" title="Peter Lougheed">Peter Lougheed</a> won election in 1971, they would go on to dominate nearly all Albertan ridings themselves until <a href="../../../1/9/8/1986.html" title="1986">1986</a>, when the <a href="../../../a/l/b/Alberta_New_Democrats_b025.html" title="Alberta New Democrats">Alberta New Democrats</a> and <a href="../../../a/l/b/Alberta_Liberal_Party_1b11.html" title="Alberta Liberal Party">Alberta Liberal Party</a> made a breakthrough in Edmonton. Since then, the provincial Tories have continued to win a majority of seats in every election both provincewide and in Calgary but have only gained a majority of Edmonton's seats once (in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2001.html" title="2001">2001</a>). In 1989 Lougheed's successor (former Eskimos <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quarterback.html" title="Quarterback">quarterback</a> <a href="../../../d/o/n/Don_Getty_04da.html" title="Don Getty">Don Getty</a>) was defeated in his Edmonton district and forced to run outside the city in a by-election. Getty's successor <a href="../../../r/a/l/Ralph_Klein_fcd9.html" title="Ralph Klein">Ralph Klein</a> was a former <a href="../../../m/a/y/Mayor_of_Calgary_9747.html" title="Mayor of Calgary">mayor of Calgary</a> who defeated a former <a href="../../../m/a/y/Mayor_of_Edmonton_ec18.html" title="Mayor of Edmonton">mayor of Edmonton</a>, Liberal <a href="../../../l/a/u/Laurence_Decore_1b4c.html" title="Laurence Decore">Laurence Decore</a> in the <a href="../../../a/l/b/Alberta_general_election%2C_1993.html" title="Alberta general election, 1993">1993 election</a>.

During the <a href="../../../a/l/b/Alberta_Progressive_Conservative_leadership_election%2C_2006_3dc8.html" title="Alberta Progressive Conservative leadership election, 2006">2006 Tory leadership race</a> Calgary-based candidates <a href="../../../t/e/d/Ted_Morton_5ea1.html" title="Ted Morton">Ted Morton</a> and <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jim_Dinning_5ec3.html" title="Jim Dinning">Jim Dinning</a> both faired poorly in Edmonton, which contributed to the victory of <a href="../../../e/d/_/Ed_Stelmach_787f.html" title="Ed Stelmach">Ed Stelmach</a>. Stelmach's victory continues a pattern under which since Lougheed assumed the premiership in 1971 the Tories have had their successive leaders (and premiers) alternating between Calgary and Edmonton-area ridings (Stelmach represents <a href="../../../f/o/r/Fort_Saskatchewan-Vegreville_d427.html" title="Fort Saskatchewan-Vegreville">Fort Saskatchewan-Vegreville</a> which borders Edmonton's eastern city limits).</p>
