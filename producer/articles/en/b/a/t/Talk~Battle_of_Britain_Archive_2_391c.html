<h2><span class="mw-headline">British?</span></h2>
<p><i>In British military tradition, the Battle of Britain is remembered with at least as much pride as the Battle of Trafalgar, Waterloo and Agincourt. In addition, the battle has entered popular legend around the world as an inspiring story of how a small island, standing alone against Nazi tyranny, managed to defeat a powerful enemy.</i></p>
<p>Guys, are we forgetting to remember the difference between British, English and Scots? One can argue the first two battle examples, but how can Agincourt be considered a British Military victory, or even an example of British history? Occuring in 1415 puts it well before the union of the crowns of England and Scotland, let alone the actual Act of Union that created Great Britain.</p>
<p>Let's remember that anything before the Act of Union cannot officially be "British"; it must be either English, or Scots. Agreed?</p>
<p>At present the article states this: "Another way in which the RAF conserved its strength is by ordering its pilots to pretend to be shot down when facing long odds. They were to enter a spin and then regain control before they hit the ground. If the Germans had watched the planes they shot at to be sure they crashed, then they would have been shot by one of the downed airman's allies, so they could not afford to pay too close attention to most of the "casualties". Due to this tactic, the Luftwaffe reported shooting down more than twice as many pilots as were in the RAF."</p>
<p>Whilst this may be a tactic which was employed (and I've never heard of it despite reading extensively around the subject) it almost certainly cannot be said to have been singularly responsible for the overclaiming of Luftwaffe pilots. Overclaiming occurred on both sides due to the inherent confusion of air combat involving massed formations, not because of deliberate tactics to trick the opposition into thinking they had shot unharmed planes down.</p>
<p>Similarly US bomber formations filed hugely exaggerated claims of german fighter kills during the daylight raids over Germany later in the war.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Commonwealth Air Training Schools=</span></h2>
<p>I'm just wondering, why aren't the Commonwealth Air Training Schools mentioned in the article, didn't they train most of the pilots? MattD-July 1st, 2006 (Canada Day)</p>
<dl>
<dd><a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Commonwealth_Air_Training_Plan_4b63.html" title="British Commonwealth Air Training Plan">British Commonwealth Air Training Plan</a> says that the scheme started in May 1940. I would have thought that would be too late for many pilots to have been trained and then to have participated in the battle given that it finished in October. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimbo_c673.html" title="User:Shimbo">Shimbo</a> 08:33, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Battle of Britain vs. The Blitz</span></h2>
<p>There are full length articles on both of these. Both seem to cover much the same ground. Why does Wikipedia need two?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Because they are not the same thing. The Battle of Britain was daylight attacks in the summer and early autumn of 1940 preparatory to a (cancelled) invasion. The Blitz was night time attacks in the winter of 1940/41 in a (failed) attempt to terror bomb Britain into submission. The reason there is some overlap in the articles is that some people don't realise this and put information in the wrong article.--<a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimbo_c673.html" title="User:Shimbo">Shimbo</a> 12:04, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Canadian number too low?</span></h2>
<p>Acording to the official site of the Royal Canadian Air Force:</p>
<p><i>"Canadian airmen played their part in the Battle of Britain. <b>Over 100 Canadian pilots flew on fighter operations during the Battle of Britain</b>. Another 200 fought with the RAF's Bomber and Coastal Commands. An untold number served as groundcrew, keeping the fighters, bombers and patrol Aircraft flying.[/b]</i></p>

<p><i>More than 2,800 people turned out to the Battle of Britain parade held at the Canada Aviation Museum in Ottawa commemorate the 64th anniversary of the event. It was the largest turnout ever. [b]<b>One hundred and three Canadians flew in the Battle of Britain</b>, 23 died and 30 were killed later in the war.</i></p>

<p>I think the number of Canadians should be changed from 86 to 103 respectfully.</p>
<dl>
<dd>The point here is that the RAF roll of honour only recognises 86. The table specifically references the RAF Roll of Honour. That is why the change to the table was reverted. IMHO what is needed is a separate sentence saying something like "Although the RAF only recognises 83 Canadian pilots who flew on fighter operations during the Battle of Britain, the RCAF claims the actual figure was over 100." I will make a change as above, which I hope will satisfy everyone. Please let me now if it doesn't. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimbo_c673.html" title="User:Shimbo">Shimbo</a> 22:29, 23 May 2006 (UTC)

<dl>
<dd>Perhaps there could be another column beside the roll of honour number with the number of pilots from official government websites. Veterans affairs Canada also claims 103 fighter pilots flew in the battle, along with 200 others in RAF bomber and costal command. Erik</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Dowding-System</span></h2>
<p>Hi, there is considerable doubt about the term "dowding-system" since it is hard to find sources about when and by whom such a term was installed (except of the english wikipedia), can anyone bring light to that ? rgds--80.121.111.78 13:56, 29 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>In response to your question about information on the Dowding System, it was a invented by a man called Sir Hugh Dowding. One aspect of the system was that aircraft (for example the Spitfire and Hurricane) would fly in tight formations to create a bigger punch against German Bombers. The system theorised that 12 aircraft (1 squadron)= 96 guns firing 1100 rpm.</p>
<p>The system was flawed because it allowed the last section of the squadron to be jumped from behind without warning. Dowding also theorised that the lead aircraft should start firing 400 yards away from the enemy aircraft. This did <b>not</b> work because the bullets diverged and fell away from the target while in the air. Eventually all these mistakes were rectified with the English aircraft spread out to allow more people to look for the enemy. Firing also started at 200-150 yards instead of 400 yards.--Atilla 02:25, 16 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Books</span></h2>
<p>I recently read Richard Overy's short book "The Battle". It dispels many of the myths surrounding the Battle of Britain. I believe it should be on the book list for this subject. Has anyone else here read it?</p>
<p>The Battle - <a href="http://www.time.com/time/europe/magazine/2000/0828/battle.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.time.com/time/europe/magazine/2000/0828/battle.html" rel="nofollow">[8]</a> . Richard Overy - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Overy" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Overy" rel="nofollow">[9]</a> . Penguin Books, 2000.</p>
<p>I have read Overy's book. (In the US, it bears a slightly longer title, "The Battle of Britain," with the sub-title, "The Myth and the Reality.") I found the book outstanding and would join the recommendation that it be on the book list for this subject. Overy's book is quite concise yet sets out a keen, sometimes highly original analysis of the topic. (I have also read some of Overy's longer books including "The Air War: 1939-1945" and find his work consistently both solid and illuminating.)</p>

They were certainly more important at night as without them the aircraft had dificulty finding their targets.

The successor X-Gerät system was accurate only within a few hundred yards, and Knickebein, presumably, was considerably less accurate than that (as one would expect from a basic radio navigation system at that distance, even with a narrow beam).

<p>I removed this paragraph: actually in the battle of britain the australian contribuion was very slow in process as the asutralians didnt know about how often the bombing supplies would be sent. The reason for this was that their communication was low and they couldnt be told of the rate of income and import to the australian defence force.</p>

<p>There were Australians flying in the Battle of Britain, one notable being Flying Officer Desmond Sheen, though he flew as a member of the RAF rather than as a member of the RAAF. RAAF personnel were easy to identify due to their uniforms, which were darker blue than the standard RAF/RCAF/RNZAF blue-grey. Australians in the RAF also wore nationality shoulder titles, I believe.--<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarshallStack_700f.html" title="User:MarshallStack">MarshallStack</a> 23:07, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You are right. I went and watched various Anzac day parades in Melbourne. The uniforms were indeed a dark blue, so much different than the British uniforms, more like Navy.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">74 Squadron "South African"?</span></h2>
<p>Can anyone provide reference for RAF 74 Sqn being called "South African" other than its commander being "Sailor" Malan, a South African? Unlike the other Dominions, there was no separate South African Air Force during WWII. South African air squadrons were part of the Army and wore Army uniform with a distinctive cap badge and RAF-derived aircrew badges. The main difference was that their aircraft roundel centres were orange, rather than red. South Africans in the RAF wore RAF uniform with "South Africa" shoulder titles, as pictures of Group Captain Malan will show. There were no entirely South African-manned units taking part in the Battle of Britain, though there were of course South Africans in RAF units.</p>
<p>On the same note, rarely, if at all, were Dominion units entirely Canadian, Australian, South African or New Zealand-manned. There was much interchange of nationalities between RAF and Commonwealth units, though possible exceptions of course were home-based Australian, New Zealand, Canadian and South African units.--<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarshallStack_700f.html" title="User:MarshallStack">MarshallStack</a> 23:03, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Anything I find on 74 Squadron does not call it South African, although some RAF Squadrons did reference nationalities. For example, my father in law, a Canadian, first flew with 44(Rhodesia) Squadron in Bomber Command. In Fighter command, there was 242(Canadian) Squadron of the RAF, as opposed to 1 Squadron (later 401 Squadron) RCAF. 139.142.75.220 03:14, 11 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Yes. I am also concerned about the lack of coverage for South Africa, not only in this article, but all WW2 related items. I guess that it is due to the humility of these people, the old Dutch spirit. They don't brag. They just do it. South Africa played a crutial role. <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWallie_96b2.html" title="User:Wallie">Wallie</a> 11:03, 27 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Some RAF Squadrons were 'adopted' by Commonwealth nations and resulted in exmmples like 44(Rhodesia), 222 (Natal), 257 (Burma) squadron, etc etc. This shouldnt be confused with RCAF RAAF or such squadrons. In the case of South Africa, the SA Government specifically requested no SAAF units serve with the Allies outside of the African continent, hence all SAAF units were with the Desert Air Force in the African campaign ( Some dd serve on into the Italian campaign in the latter war years.) As had been mentioned many South africans joined the RAF and served in Europe. Harryurz 14:17, 27 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I am a personal friend of one of the few surviving 74 Squadron members from the battle, and one of its tops scorers, John Freeborn DFC. I have had extensive discussions with him about his experience and his relationship with Sailor Malan. The squadron was not at all a South African squadron. Malan simply took over as squadron leader during the battle after its previous commander was promoted to station commander at Hornchurch. John has a somewhat sour view of Malan, after Malan attempted to avoid blame for The Battle of Barking Creek by blaming John at his courts martial. John also remembers Malan as an inveterate gambler who was always borrowing to pay his debts. <a href="../../../p/r/u/User%7EPrune_8d59.html" title="User:Prune">Prune</a> 13:42, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Italian participation</span></h2>
<p>Italian expeditionary force called Corpo Aereo Italiano, (Italian Air Corps) CAI, took part in the Battle of Britain from October 1940 to January 1941. It was formed from the 13th Bomber Wing (13o Stormo BT), 43rd Bomber Wing (43o Stormo BT), 56th Fighter Wing (56o Stormo CT) and 179th Recon Flight (179a Squadriglia).</p>

<p>I think all the Nation should mentioned because we have to respect all the Fallen. The Corpo Aereo Italiano concentrated its attacks especially on Harwich. 54,320 Kg. of bombs were dropped. The "C.A.I" lost 20 men and 8 planes (3 bombers and 5 fighters). The famous movie of 1969 about the battle of England full ignore the Italian Fallen in the final list!!!!!</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, I agree we should respect the fallen, but I think that including them under 'Combatants' might confuse people who are new to the subject. The sources I have managed to find put the date of Italian contribution as being from around the 10th of September onwards, which is long after the generally agreed date on which the BoB began (and the one referred to in the article). In my opinion, a section on The Italian Contribution should probably be enough. <a href="../../../m/u/m/User%7EMumby_d362.html" title="User:Mumby">Mumby</a> 12:52, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The problem is that "accurate details" mean that certain countries who amde minor contributions have so few pilots, that each one's exploits are explained at length. The North American contribution to this Battle was minimal. Certainly there should be no mention of individual pilots, unless they did something special. But anyone reading this would think that it was significant.

<p>The reason why I have included individual references to US aircrew is because of the continuing false perception ( perpetuated by Hollywood films like Pearl Harbour) that some nation's contribution to the Battle of Britain was more than any others.

<p>As we move further and further away from the events of 1940 the time may have come to put the Battle of Britain into proper historical perspective. The heroism and sacrifice of the young pilots will, of course, never be forgotten; but the battle itself has less strategic significance than is usually assumed. Above all it is important to understand that it was not the RAF that stopped a German invasion but the Royal Navy. Any attempt to cross the Channel in the face of the massive superiority of the navy would have been military suicide. <a href="../../../w/h/i/User%7EWhite_Guard_fe26.html" title="User:White Guard">White Guard</a> 02:34, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Ships were vulnerable to Stuka/dive bombing attack ( as seen in the Crete campaign in 1941). However at least 6,000 feet of clear visibility was vital for effective aiming in a diving attack; something the Luftwaffe would not have in any measure over the Channel in the late summer autumn of 1940. So the threat to the Home Fleet would not be that high. The destruction of the RAF fighters would still have left a largely intact Bomber force, who, with the navy. would have taken huge losses but would have inflicted critic losses on an invasion force.

<dd>I've added citations for both the strength and losses for both sides now. I've also split the initial strength into various sub-components. The numbers, however, will never "add up" as the strenght, replacement rate and so on varied on a daily basis. The current numbers reflect the strength around <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_1.html" title="July 1">1 July</a> <a href="../../../1/9/4/1940.html" title="1940">1940</a>, but would be vastly different if one looked at the strength a couple of weeks later or previously. As to the strengt and losses not adding up - of course they dont - the losses were replaced as the battle went on. <a href="../../../a/b/e/User%7EAbel29a_ae37.html" title="User:Abel29a">Abel29a</a> 20:34, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Stop doing so. Italy took part in the battle with one Air Corps. Corpo Aereo Italiano, (Italian Air Corps) CAI, took part in the Battle of Britain from October 1940 to January 1941. It was formed from the 13th Bomber Wing (13o Stormo BT), 43rd Bomber Wing (43o Stormo BT), 56th Fighter Wing (56o Stormo CT) and 179th Recon Flight (179a Squadriglia). The size (which is not that small) or overall effect of the Italian expeditionary force is not relevant. What is relevant is that Italy took part in the battle on German side. --<a href="../../../k/u/r/User%7EKurt_Leyman_1ee7.html" title="User:Kurt Leyman">Kurt Leyman</a> 14:15, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>As far as the Western front goes, I don't know that much about the Battle of Britain, but from what I've read, British victory was owed not to the fact of any crushing british victory, but the fact that Hitler had a limited window of opportunity in which to act before he wanted to launch barbarossa. If Germany had displayed it's full might against Britain, without any regard for the Eastern Campaign, then Britain would have been utterly crushed.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Issue with combatants</span></h2>
<p>More than one contributor has seen fit to add the flags of other nations to both sides in the 'Combatants' section of the infobox. I always remove the flags but perhaps it is time to think about a better solution for the problem of how to represent the multinational nature of the forces on both sides, but particularly in the RAF. The Battle of Britain page in other languages seems to have the same problem, with no consistency in which flags are displayed. Unfortunately there is no equivalent to, for exapmle, the <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Brigades_5c52.html" title="International Brigades">International Brigades</a> in the <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spanish_Civil_War_7a30.html" title="Spanish Civil War">Spanish Civil War</a>.

<dd>I like the idea of adding the different combatants as a bullet point list, but maybe we should have a minimum number of pilots participating before a country is listed? Palestine for instance had one pilot involved, if we are to list all the countries with just a handfull of participants we'd have a long list, I'd imagine. (Not that I have no idea about the actual numbers involved tough). Maybe we should list the numbers of pilots all the nations listed had involved as well? <a href="../../../a/b/e/User%7EAbel29a_ae37.html" title="User:Abel29a">Abel29a</a> 20:09, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for the comment. I think I agree that the bulleted list is the best way to go, even though it was my idea. Even including the countries which contributed just 1 pilot the list is not too long, so I think if we have it it should include all the nations. There is a good explanation of how many were from each nation at <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Britain_Foreign_Contribution_81ca.html" title="Battle of Britain Foreign Contribution">Battle of Britain Foreign Contribution</a> so we might not want to repeat too much of that here. The alternative is to add a note to the infobox saying something like "including many combatants from other nations, see text of main article." or something like that.<a href="../../../m/u/m/User%7EMumby_d362.html" title="User:Mumby">Mumby</a> 21:59, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't agree with that. According to the RAF museum website the Corpo Aereo Italiano flew 97 bomber and 113 fighter sorties, I don't see how this can be considered more notable than, for example, the USA's involvment or anybody elses. Here is the link to the RAF museum website <a href="http://www.rafmuseum.org.uk/milestones-of-flight/british_military/1940_6.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.rafmuseum.org.uk/milestones-of-flight/british_military/1940_6.html" rel="nofollow">[10]</a>. What I would really like to do is make a detailed entry on the Corpo Aereo Italiano at the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Britain_Foreign_Contributions_16ac.html" title="Battle of Britain Foreign Contributions">Battle of Britain Foreign Contributions</a> page, but I am yet to find a decent reference for any information (in English!).

<p>According to my information, the Italian expeditionary force Corpo Aereo Italiano, (Italian Air Corps) CAI was formed from the 13th Bomber Wing (13o Stormo BT), 43rd Bomber Wing (43o Stormo BT), 56th Fighter Wing (56o Stormo CT) and 179th Recon Flight (179a Squadriglia). The Corpo Aereo Italiano concentrated its attacks especially against Harwich. During its life:</p>
<p>Bombers: 137 missions for 315 flight hours and 54,320kg of bombs dropped. Fighter: 934 missions for 1470 flight hours. Recon: 5 missions for 20 flight hours. Recorded aerial victories: 15. Complete losses: 8 planes; 3 bombers and 5 fighters. 20 dead. A number of men were also captured, but I don't have the figures.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the famous 1969 movie "Battle of Britain" ignored the Italian participation and losses completely.</p>
<p>Here is a decent site with information of the Corpo Aereo Italiano in English. <a href="http://surfcity.kund.dalnet.se/falco_bob.htm" class="external free" title="http://surfcity.kund.dalnet.se/falco_bob.htm" rel="nofollow">http://surfcity.kund.dalnet.se/falco_bob.htm</a></p>

<dd>Thanks for the info Kurt. That is a pretty good website, I want to track down some of the sources it quotes because I would rather cite them in an article than a website.

Maybe it even deserves its own page? Either way, I would like to read a good, non-website, reference.

<dd>Good work there Trekphiler - I've asked for a GA review, hopefully we can push this puppy up the quality ladder quite smartly. <a href="../../../a/b/e/User%7EAbel29a_ae37.html" title="User:Abel29a">Abel29a</a> 08:39, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks. Glad to do it. Just, check the sources for footnoting. I don't have them handy. Also, crosscheck <i><a href="../../../l/u/f/Luftwaffe.html" title="Luftwaffe">Luftwaffe</a></i>; some of the same issues are dealt with there. (See the talk page, too; modesty forbids saying what you'll find...) <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrekphiler_ea82.html" title="User:Trekphiler">Trekphiler</a> 12:49, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Misleading paragraph</span></h2>
<p>Quote- "Despite the demonstrated inadequacy of the Defiant and <a href="../../../f/a/i/Fairey_Battle_1e36.html" title="Fairey Battle">Fairey Battle</a>, these were never retired and scrapped, allowing their precious <a href="../../../r/o/l/Rolls-Royce_Merlin_1e2b.html" title="Rolls-Royce Merlin">Merlins</a> to be turned over to fighters and their pilots (about three thousand in all) to be retrained on Hurricanes, thereby freeing large numbers of high-time, combat-experienced Hurricane pilots for Spitfires.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[7]</a></sup>"; This is a somewhat misleading, controversial and generally incorrect statement- the Defiant went onto night fighting, the Battles and their crews were held in hand for combating the predicted invasion. Further to that the huge increase in aircraft production meant there was no shortage of fighter aircraft or a need to swop Merlin engines from bombers to fighters. Using anything from the Allen book <i>Who Won the Battle of Britain?</i> as a legitimate reference source should be with considerable caution , as much of the 'factual' information is simply 'Dizzy' Allen's own, often flawed opinions. I request this misleading paragraph be removed if all in agreement. Thanks.Harryurz 22:45, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>What if one rewrote the sentence somewhat and added the fact that the planes were used for different roles? But I agree about the Merlin part, there were "never" a lack of planes, only trained pilots-- How would this work?: "Despite the demonstrated inadequacy of the Defiant and <a href="../../../f/a/i/Fairey_Battle_1e36.html" title="Fairey Battle">Fairey Battle</a>, these were never retired and scrapped, allowing their their pilots (about three thousand in all) to be retrained on Hurricanes, thereby freeing large numbers of high-time, combat-experienced Hurricane pilots for Spitfires. Instead the Defiants saw action as night fighters, and the Battles were held ready to attack the German invasion fleet." At least it gives a reason for them not being scrapped. <a href="../../../a/b/e/User%7EAbel29a_ae37.html" title="User:Abel29a">Abel29a</a> 07:39, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
