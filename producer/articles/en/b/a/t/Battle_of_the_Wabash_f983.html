<p>The <a href="../../../t/r/e/Treaty_of_Paris_%281783%29_408e.html" title="Treaty of Paris (1783)">Treaty of Paris of 1783</a>, which ended the <a href="../../../w/a/r/War_of_American_Independence_fc9a.html" title="War of American Independence">War of American Independence</a>, recognized United States sovereignty of all the land east of the <a href="../../../m/i/s/Mississippi_River_e27c.html" title="Mississippi River">Mississippi River</a> and south of the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Lakes_2a98.html" title="Great Lakes">Great Lakes</a>. The Indian tribes in the <a href="../../../o/l/d/Old_Northwest_bbdf.html" title="Old Northwest">Old Northwest</a>, however, were not parties to this treaty, and many of them, especially leaders such as Little Turtle and Blue Jacket, refused to recognize American claims to the area northwest of the <a href="../../../o/h/i/Ohio_River_8c4c.html" title="Ohio River">Ohio River</a>. During the mid- and late 1780s, white settlers in <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kentucky.html" title="Kentucky">Kentucky</a> and travelers on and north of the river suffered approximately 1500 casualties during the ongoing hostilities, during which whites often retaliated against Indians. As a result of this continual violence, President Washington and his <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Secretary_of_War_e0d8.html" title="United States Secretary of War">Secretary of War</a>, <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_Knox_d4a8.html" title="Henry Knox">Henry Knox</a>, decided to use military force to pacify the region.</p>
<p>In 1790, a force of 1,453 men (320 <a href="../../../r/e/g/Regular_Army_8fde.html" title="Regular Army">Regular U.S. Troops</a>, 1,133 <a href="../../../m/i/l/Militia.html" title="Militia">militia</a>) under <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brigadier_General_8b0d.html" title="Brigadier General">Brigadier General</a> <a href="../../../j/o/s/Josiah_Harmar_3fdd.html" title="Josiah Harmar">Josiah Harmar</a> marched northwards from <a href="../../../f/o/r/Fort_Washington%2C_Cincinnati%2C_Ohio_1ab6.html" title="Fort Washington, Cincinnati, Ohio">Fort Washington</a> on the <a href="../../../o/h/i/Ohio_River_8c4c.html" title="Ohio River">Ohio River</a> at 10:00 a.m. on <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_7.html" title="October 7">October 7</a>, <a href="../../../1/7/9/1790.html" title="1790">1790</a>. On <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_22.html" title="October 22">October 22</a>, near present-day <a href="../../../f/o/r/Fort_Wayne%2C_Indiana_093e.html" title="Fort Wayne, Indiana">Fort Wayne, Indiana</a>, Harmar committed only 400 of his men under Col. John Hardin to attack an Indian force of some 1,100 warriors. When a courier informed Harmar (rumored to be drunk) of the size of the enemy force, out of fear he refused to come to Hardin's aid. Had he supported Colonel Hardin with the other 800-900 men, the Indian force almost certainly would have been defeated. But, cowering, he formed his part of the army into a hollow defensive square, and did not move. Hardin, expecting reinforcements, put up a valiant fight for over three hours, then fell back to the main army's encampment and Harmar ordered a retreat back to Ft. Washington. <i>(See main article: <a href="../../../h/a/r/Hardin%27s_Defeat_7c93.html" title="Hardin's Defeat">Hardin's Defeat</a>).</i></p>
<p>At least 129 troops (14 officers,115 enlisted) were killed in action and another 94 wounded, for a total of 223 casualties. Estimates of total Indian casualties, killed and wounded, range from 120 to 150. Washington then ordered St. Clair, who served both as governor of the <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northwest_Territory_2237.html" title="Northwest Territory">Northwest Territory</a> and as a <a href="../../../m/a/j/Major_general.html" title="Major general">major general</a> in the army, to mount a more vigorous effort by summer 1791. Congress agreed to fund the expedition as well as to authorize the raising of an additional <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_army_07ef.html" title="United States army">U.S. Army</a> regiment for the purpose, thus bringing the total number of army regiments in existence to two. St. Clair augmented this force with Kentucky <a href="../../../m/i/l/Militia.html" title="Militia">militia</a>.</p>
<p><a name="The_Campaign" id="The_Campaign"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_the_Wabash_f983.html" title="Edit section: The Campaign">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Campaign</span></h2>
<p>While Washington was adamant that St. Clair move north in the summer months, various logistics and supply problems greatly slowed his preparations in Fort Washington (present-day <a href="../../../c/i/n/Cincinnati%2C_Ohio_33af.html" title="Cincinnati, Ohio">Cincinnati, Ohio</a>). The new levies were poorly trained and disciplined, the food supplies substandard, and the horses, low in number, were of poor quality. The expedition thus failed to set out until October 1791. Building supply posts as it advanced, the army's objective was the town of <a href="../../../k/e/k/Kekionga.html" title="Kekionga">Kekionga</a>, the capital of the Miami tribe, near present-day Fort Wayne, Indiana.</p>
<p>When it did get underway, the force, including some 200-250 camp followers (wives, children, laundresses, and <a href="../../../p/r/o/Prostitute.html" title="Prostitute">prostitutes</a>) numbered around 1,486. Going was slow and discipline problems were severe; St. Clair, suffering from <a href="../../../g/o/u/Gout.html" title="Gout">gout</a>, had difficulty maintaining order, especially among the militia and the new levies. The force was constantly shadowed by Indians, and skirmishes occasionally erupted.</p>
<p>By the end of <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_2.html" title="November 2">November 2</a>, through desertion and illness, St. Clair's force had been whittled down to around 1,120, including the camp followers. He had 52 officers and 868 enlisted and militia present for duty on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_3.html" title="November 3">November 3</a>. At dawn on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_4.html" title="November 4">November 4</a>, St. Clair's force was camped near the present-day location of <a href="../../../f/o/r/Fort_Recovery%2C_Ohio_67b0.html" title="Fort Recovery, Ohio">Fort Recovery, Ohio</a>. An Indian force consisting of around 1,800-2,000 warriors, led by Little Turtle, Blue Jacket, and Tecumseh, struck quickly and, surprising the Americans, soon overran their perimeter. The Americans almost immediately collapsed into disorder. St. Clair had three horses shot out from under him as he tried in vain to rally his troops, many of whom hid beneath wagons and behind trees despite goading from their commander (who at one point moved among them chanting "Cowards, cowards, cowards,") and from female camp followers.</p>
<p>The casualty rate was the highest ever suffered by a United States Army, and included St. Clair's second in command. Of the 52 officers engaged, 39 were killed and 7 wounded, around 88% of all officers became casualties. After two hours, St. Clair ordered a retreat, which quickly turned into a rout. "It was, in fact, a flight," St. Clair described a few days later in a letter to the Secretary of War. The American casualty rate, among the soldiers, was 97.4 percent, including 632 of 920 killed (69%), and 264 wounded. Nearly all of the 200 camp followers were slaughtered, for a total of 832 Americans killed. Approximately one-fourth of the entire standing United States Army had been wiped out. Only 24 of the 920 troops engaged came out of it unscathed. Indian casualties were between 80 and 100, with at least 67 killed.</p>
<p>The battle, if such it can be called, was a <a href="../../../m/a/s/Massacre.html" title="Massacre">massacre</a> in the truest sense of the word. The number of soldiers killed alone was more than three times the number the <a href="../../../s/i/o/Sioux.html" title="Sioux">Sioux</a> would kill 85 years later at <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Armstrong_Custer_54fa.html" title="George Armstrong Custer">Custer</a>'s last stand at the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Little_Bighorn_ba0e.html" title="Battle of Little Bighorn">Little Big Horn</a>. The next day the remnants of the force arrived at the nearest U.S. outpost, Fort Jefferson (then Fort Hamilton) and from there returned to Fort Washington.</p>

<p>St. Clair himself soon traveled to the national capital at <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philadelphia.html" title="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a> to report on what had happened. Blaming the <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quartermaster.html" title="Quartermaster">quartermaster</a> as well as the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Department_of_War_9516.html" title="United States Department of War">War Department</a>, the general asked for a <a href="../../../c/o/u/Court-martial.html" title="Court-martial">court-martial</a> in order to gain exoneration and planned to resign his commission after winning it. Washington, however, denied him the court-martial and forced St. Clair's immediate resignation.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../h/o/u/House_of_Representatives_5c56.html" title="House of Representatives">House of Representatives</a>, meanwhile, began its own investigation into the disaster. This was the first investigation that Congress had ever undertaken, as well as the first investigation of the executive branch, and as part of the proceedings, the House committee in charge of the investigation sought certain documents from the War Department. Knox brought this matter to Washington's attention, and because of the major <a href="../../../s/e/p/Separation_of_powers.html" title="Separation of powers">separation of powers</a> issues involved, the president summoned a meeting of all of his department heads (Knox, <a href="../../../s/e/c/Secretary_of_State_088f.html" title="Secretary of State">Secretary of State</a> <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Jefferson_1b17.html" title="Thomas Jefferson">Thomas Jefferson</a>, <a href="../../../s/e/c/Secretary_of_the_Treasury_05ff.html" title="Secretary of the Treasury">Secretary of the Treasury</a> <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_Hamilton_3fe5.html" title="Alexander Hamilton">Alexander Hamilton</a>, and <a href="../../../a/t/t/Attorney_General_303a.html" title="Attorney General">Attorney General</a> <a href="../../../e/d/m/Edmund_Randolph_addf.html" title="Edmund Randolph">Edmund Randolph</a>). This was one of the first meetings of all of these officials together, and some scholars consider this occasion the beginning of the <a href="../../../c/a/b/Cabinet.html" title="Cabinet">Cabinet</a>.</p>
<p>At this and subsequent meetings, the president and his advisers set forth, in theory, the concept that the <a href="../../../e/x/e/Executive_branch.html" title="Executive branch">executive branch</a> should refuse to hand over any papers or materials that the public good required them to keep secret, and that at any rate they not hand over any originals. This is the earliest appearance of the doctrine of <a href="../../../e/x/e/Executive_privilege.html" title="Executive privilege">executive privilege</a>, which later became a major separation of powers issue in matters such as <a href="../../../a/a/r/Aaron_Burr_2154.html" title="Aaron Burr">Aaron Burr's</a> <a href="../../../t/r/e/Treason.html" title="Treason">treason</a> trial, <a href="../../../w/a/t/Watergate.html" title="Watergate">Watergate</a>, the <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iran-Contra_78ce.html" title="Iran-Contra">Iran-Contra</a> affair, and the <a href="../../../i/m/p/Impeachment.html" title="Impeachment">impeachment</a> of President <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Clinton_75aa.html" title="Bill Clinton">Bill Clinton</a>. In the end, though, Washington authorized the release of copies of the materials that the committee sought.</p>
<p>The final committee report sided largely with St. Clair, finding that Knox and other War Department officials had done a bad job of raising, equipping, and supplying St. Clair's expedition. Other than issuing these findings, however, neither the committee nor the House of representatives took any further steps, such as recommending impeachment.</p>
<p>In 1794, a new U.S. force under Major General <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anthony_Wayne_e568.html" title="Anthony Wayne">"Mad Anthony" Wayne</a> achieved what St. Clair had not when he decisively defeated the Indians of the Old Northwest at the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Fallen_Timbers_6277.html" title="Battle of Fallen Timbers">Battle of Fallen Timbers</a></p>
