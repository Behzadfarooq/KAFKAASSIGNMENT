<p>The consequences paragraph bugs the heck outta me. Why is this sort of thing so frequently written from the German point of view? Wouldn't it make more sense to say something like:</p>
<p>While the Soviet forces suffered heartbreaking losses in the battle of Kiev, they at least bought time for the defense of Moscow, thereby contributing to the eventual Allied victory.</p>
<p>With no reply to my previous note, I have no marked the former consequences paragraph as "consequences from the Nazi point of view", and written a new "consequences from the Soviet point of view" paragraph. I don't realy think this is a great "end state" for the article either, but at least it should be a better starting point for further discussion than the former state of affairs. William Jockusch 08:58, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Well, I was the one that wrote that paragraph and initially that article. But saying that this is a nazi point of view is misplaced. I have this point of view from Alan Clarkes Barbarossa, who was one of the foremost western historians on this conflict. Maybe true that it is a litte too western point of view, but calling it a nazi point of view is certainly misplaced. ----<a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELucius1976_ad53.html" title="User:Lucius1976">Lucius1976</a> 08:21, 18 June 2006 (UTC) 08:15, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm not sure if this is right. Whilst it was an operational victory surely the failure to subsequently take Moscow makes it a strategic defeat? --<a href="../../../j/2E/s/User%7EJ.StuartClarke_596c.html" title="User:J.StuartClarke">J.StuartClarke</a> 21:08, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>...I agree, if this were decisive the Germans would have ended up winning the war (or at least the Eastern front) as a result of this battle. They didn't, but they managed to destory the South-Western front which makes this victory strategic. <a href="../../../c/o/u/User%7ECounterstrike69_17ab.html" title="User:Counterstrike69">Bogdan</a> 18:18, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Something wrong with numbers. 700 total strength cannot give 300 dead + 650 captured. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 2 July 2005 01:44 (UTC)</p>
<p>Ok maybe someone got the numbers wrong but the fact remains that a lot of people died and were captured.</p>
<p>This is an extremely impressive victory. However, it also gave Hitler a big ego and over confidence which would doom him at Stalingrad.</p>
<p>Well, it had more consequences on the subsequent Battle of Moscow, because it delayed the latter for 4 weeks, which proved decisive. --<a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELucius1976_ad53.html" title="User:Lucius1976">Lucius1976</a> 12:47, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>it is high time that wehrmacht self-congratulatory overestimates of soviet losses inflictid be no longer automatically accepted as gospel but understood to be essentially nonsense. after all the germans conducted no census of prisoners captured except in the summer of 42' and the winter of 42-43' when it emerged that intial estimates of prisoners were quite fantastically exaggerated. the pitiful cold war legacies coupled with an unwillingness to admit how thoroughly scondrouls like Rundstet,manstein and guderian decieved post war military "historians" in the west.it shoud make way for a greater reliance on Soviet records marked by circumspection rather than the automatic rejection charecteristic of the ignorant</p>
<p>NOT AGAIN! I have corrected the grotesquely inflated soviet casualties figures only to be reverted. again I reintroduced the correct figures but this is becoming revolting. I cannot avoid the feeling that the author or authors of the articles on the nazi-soviet war are pathological wehrmacht worshipers attempting to retroactively undo the ww2 defeat oe the forces of racial nobility through such articles, for similiar defects uglify the article on kursk. should not the matter be somehow remedied and another thing. why must my incurable revertor insist on citing the soviet commander as budyenii. it was kiroponos</p>

<dd>The German army's casualties are ridicolously high. How could the Wehramcht suffer a 30% casualty ratio in Kiev, but a 17% casualty ratio in the Battle of Moscow? I have not found any sources that state Soviet casualties as 300,000 captured.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p><br />
Citation from the article: "Nearly the entire Soviet Southwestern Front of the Red Army was encircled with the Germans claiming 650,000 captured, as this was the initial paper strengh of the encircled divisions, as revealed to them from captured records. In reality, however, these had by then dwindled to 452,000 of whom 150,541 later escaped , nonetheless the Soviet losses were astonishing." So the Wehrmacht thought they had captured 650,000 POW, because they had found "records" of the Soviets that said so, but in fact they had only 300,000 POW? Excuse me, but that is too ridiculous a claim. Please provides sources. Please provide sources for the German losses. They are grossly inflated compared to all numbers I have seen so far. 141.13.8.14 14:17, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I've done some superficial editing to the article as I felt the language contained was severely lacking, including the overuse of &amp; and several words.</p>

<p>There is no article for this. That wouldn't be bad, except in this article and one other, I found explicit reference to it ("see Lotzen decision"). Kind of a teaser to do that and then have no article for it. Presumably, in context, it explains why and how the decision was made to divert the German Army Group Center south to help out in Kiev, which did help out that effort, but in retrospect, given the winter that occurred, may have doomed the Moscow drive. If nobody else wants to, I suppose I could do it, but I would have to do some research. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Bigmac31 (<a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigmac31_d9db.html" title="User talk:Bigmac31">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bigmac31_2cd6.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bigmac31">contribs</a>) 18:44, 18 December 2006 (UTC).</small></p>

<dd>Let me rephrase that then; "<i>Do nazis deserve credit for what they did?</i>" As for "<i>All Germans being nazis</i>", I never said that.

<p>"Do nazis deserve credit for what they did?" Again, that has nothing to do with the discussion at hand. If you can't do this without trying to mix nazis with this then I suggest that you stay out, for I have no desire to discuss such here. "I do hold the idea that the overall majority of the Germans were nazis, and for that statement I have history on my side." And I have read and posses several books which say quite the opposite.

<p>There can be decisive victories without winning the war, that's obvious. What kind of logic is that of yours? Saying that Germans indeed had decisive victories is same as praising Nazism? Nice....

<dd>Read before you comment. User: Kurt Leyman claimes the nazis/germans or whatever he likes to call them are being discredited. This has nothing to do with "decisive" battles.

<dd>Decisive is differen't from strategic or tactical. A decisive battle decides the outcome of a war. Usually these battles take place at the end of a war. Examples are Normandy, in which the Nazi grip on France effectively collapsed and Kursk, the turning point in the East Front war, and El Alamein which was a turning point in Africa. This battle decided nothing in the long term, the Allies were reinforced and later pushed on to kick the crap out of the Germans/nazis all the way to berlin and beyond. Not very decisive.<a href="../../../r/e/x/User%7ERex_Germanus_1602.html" title="User:Rex Germanus">Rex</a> 18:31, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>
