The rebels refused to provide Uthman with food or water, and kept him imprisoned, hoping to force his <a href="../../../a/b/d/Abdication.html" title="Abdication">abdication</a>. Uthman was murdered despite <a href="../../../a/l/i/Ali_ibn_Abi_Taleb_e0c0.html" title="Ali ibn Abi Taleb">Ali ibn Abi Taleb</a> having sent his two sons, Hasan and Husayn, with troops to defend Uthman.</p>
<p>Ali was offered the caliphate by a large number of Muslims of Madina after Uthman's death. He is reported to have refused the caliphate at first but later he, upon their insistence, accepted the caliphate.</p>
<p>These events displeased Aisha (sacred mother of the faithfull) and a large number of most significant Sahaba of Muhammad. They evidently believed that Ali was wrong to occupy himself in other tasks before finding Uthman's murderer. They challenged Ali's caliphate under the claim that Ali had been unsuccessful in finding Uthman's murderer, claiming <a href="../../../q/i/s/Qisas.html" title="Qisas">Qisas</a> for Uthman. Also, Ali was never to be blamed for Uthman's death, since he did the best he could, even sending both of his sons, to defend the deceased caliph Uthman.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Bassorah_85f6.html" title="Edit section: Massing support">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Massing support</span></h3>
<p>Aisha was returning to Medina from Mecca after <a href="../../../h/a/j/Hajj.html" title="Hajj">Hajj</a>, but turned back when she heard the news of Uthman's assassination and the accession of Ali to the caliphate. Aisha's two brothers-in-law <a href="../../../t/a/l/Talha.html" title="Talha">Talha</a> and <a href="../../../z/u/b/Zubayr_ibn_al-Awwam_c0e8.html" title="Zubayr ibn al-Awwam">Zubayr ibn al-Awwam</a>, who were considered to be two of the most significant Sahaba of Muhammad, also arrived in Mecca. Uthman's governor in Mecca was Abd-Allah ibn Umayr al-Hadrami. <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marwan_I_d09c.html" title="Marwan I">Marwan ibn al-Hakam</a> and other members of <a href="../../../b/a/n/Banu_Umayya_0ddc.html" title="Banu Umayya">Banu Umayya</a>, Uthman's clan, were staying as his guests. All of them held a meeting.</p>
<p>Aisha got <a href="../../../t/a/l/Talha.html" title="Talha">Talha</a>'s and <a href="../../../z/u/b/Zubayr.html" title="Zubayr">Zubayr</a>'s support despite them having already given their oath of allegiance to Ali. Both had been previously nominated for the caliphate by <a href="../../../u/m/a/Umar.html" title="Umar">Umar</a>, the second caliph, before his death; but <a href="../../../u/t/h/Uthman.html" title="Uthman">Uthman</a> was appointed for the caliphate in priority to them. Aisha also managed to enlist the support of the powerful clan of <a href="../../../b/a/n/Banu_Umayyah_ad50.html" title="Banu Umayyah">Banu Umayyah</a>, to whom Uthman had belonged. The ex-governors of Uthman, who had been displaced by Ali, also joined her. Yala, the ex-governor of <a href="../../../y/e/m/Yemen.html" title="Yemen">Yemen</a>, had carried off to <a href="../../../m/e/c/Mecca.html" title="Mecca">Mecca</a> a large sum of treasure when he was displaced. He gave over to Aisha sixty thousand <a href="../../../d/i/n/Dinar.html" title="Dinar">dinars</a>, along with six hundred camels; one of which was a very large and well-bred, valued at 200 gold pieces. It was named Al-Askar and was especially presented for Aisha's personal transportation.</p>
<p>Having completed her preparations for the battle, Aisha unsuccessfully tried to convince one of the previous wives of Muhammad, <a href="../../../u/m/m/Umm_Salama_5a7e.html" title="Umm Salama">Umm Salama</a>, to side with her. <a href="../../../u/m/m/Umm_Salama_5a7e.html" title="Umm Salama">Umm Salama</a> instead tried, and almost succeeded in convincing Aisha to abandon her plan; but <a href="../../../z/u/b/Zubayr.html" title="Zubayr">Zubayr</a>'s son <a href="../../../a/b/d/Abdullah.html" title="Abdullah">Ibn Zubair</a> persuaded her to proceed. Aisha had also tried to persuade another of Muhammad's previous wives, <a href="../../../h/a/f/Hafsa.html" title="Hafsa">Hafsa bint Umar</a>, to follow her; but Hafsa's brother <a href="../../../i/b/n/Ibn_Umar_b282.html" title="Ibn Umar">Ibn Umar</a> stopped her from doing so. Aisha mounted on a litter on the camel al-Askar, and marched from Mecca at the head of 1,000 men. On her right was <a href="../../../t/a/l/Talha.html" title="Talha">Talha</a>, and on her left <a href="../../../z/u/b/Zubayr.html" title="Zubayr">Zubayr</a>.</p>
<p>The other widows of Muhammad residing in Mecca accompanied her a little way and then returned. As they parted the company gave vent to their feelings and wept bitterly at the louring outlook; "there was no such weeping, before or after, as then; so that day was called The Day of Tears." <sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup>. On their way many more joined them, and their numbers swelled to 3,000.</p>
<p>A month after the death of <a href="../../../u/t/h/Uthman.html" title="Uthman">Uthman</a>, and during the march of the Meccan troops, queries began to arise if either <a href="../../../t/a/l/Talha.html" title="Talha">Talha</a> or <a href="../../../z/u/b/Zubayr.html" title="Zubayr">Zubayr</a> would appoint himself as Caliph, in the event of a victory. Thus, the position of the <a href="../../../i/m/a/Imamat.html" title="Imamat">Imamat</a> (leadership) of prayers, which was correlated to the <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamic_caliphate.html" title="Islamic caliphate">Islamic caliphate</a>, was diputed among the troops. But Aisha, seeking to cease the strife, resolved that neither <a href="../../../t/a/l/Talha.html" title="Talha">Talha</a> nor <a href="../../../z/u/b/Zubayr.html" title="Zubayr">Zubayr</a> should lead the prayer, and <a href="../../../z/u/b/Zubayr.html" title="Zubayr">Zubayr</a>'s son <a href="../../../a/b/d/Abdullah.html" title="Abdullah">Ibn Zubair</a> should lead the prayers instead. And so it was later given out that the choice of the future Caliph, in case of victory of the Meccan troops, should be left to the men of <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medina.html" title="Medina">Medina</a>.</p>
<p>The ex-governor of <a href="../../../k/u/f/Kufa.html" title="Kufa">Kufa</a> named Sa'id, who had previously sworn allegiance to the Meccan party, distrusted the motives of the rebel leaders, and he at the last moment withdrawed back with his troops, and returned back to Mecca. As the remaining cavalcade swept by Sa'id, shouting that they were on their way to destroy the murderers of <a href="../../../u/t/h/Uthman.html" title="Uthman">Uthman</a>, Sa'id cried out, "Whither away? the objects of your vengeance (meaning Talha and Zubayr) are on their camels' humps before your eyes. Slay them both and return to your homes!"</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Bassorah_85f6.html" title="Edit section: Ali receives news">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Ali receives news</span></h3>
<p>When rumours of the defection first reached Medina, Ali refused to move against the malcontents so long as no overt act of rebellion threatened the unity of the Islamic nation. But shortly after, news arrived of the design on <a href="../../../b/a/s/Basra.html" title="Basra">Basra</a>. At first, Ali thought that the insurgents had not made <a href="../../../k/u/f/Kufa.html" title="Kufa">Kufa</a>, with its greater <a href="../../../b/e/d/Bedouin.html" title="Bedouin">Bedouin</a> population, their object. <a href="../../../i/b/n/Ibn_Abbas_d33f.html" title="Ibn Abbas">Ibn Abbas</a>, however, pointed out that Basra was really the more dangerous, because fewer of the leading chiefs were there, able to curb the people and repress rebellion.</p>
<p>Ali admitted this; and alarmed, gave orders that the column destined for Syria should march instead to <a href="../../../n/e/j/Nejd.html" title="Nejd">Nejd</a>, hoping thereby to intercept the insurgents on their way to Basra. A column of 900 men was got together, at the head of which Ali marched hastily in pursuit of the insurgents; but on striking the Mecca road he found that they had already passed. Not being equipped for further advance, he halted there. Messengers were sent to Kufa, Egypt, and elsewhere, demanding reinforcements; and for these the Caliph waited before he went forward.</p>

Messages were exchanged, and Uthman ibn Hanif, the governor of Basra, aware that the cry of vengeance on the regicides really covered designs against his chief <a href="../../../a/l/i/Ali_ibn_Abi_Taleb_e0c0.html" title="Ali ibn Abi Taleb">Ali ibn Abi Taleb</a>, called an assembly to try the temper of the people. Finding from the uproar that the strangers had a strong party in the city, he put on his armour, and, followed by the larger portion of the citizens, went forth to meet the enemy, who, on their side, was joined from the town by all the malcontents. A parley ensued. Talha, Zubair, and Aisha all three declaimed against the murderers of <a href="../../../u/t/h/Uthman.html" title="Uthman">Uthman</a> and demanded justice.</p>
<p>The other side were equally loud in their protestations against Aisha and her attack upon their city. They said it was a shame and a slight on the legacy and memory of <a href="../../../m/u/h/Muhammad.html" title="Muhammad">Muhammad</a> for her to forego the sanctity of the <a href="../../../v/e/i/Veil.html" title="Veil">Hijab</a>, and the proprieties of Umm el-Mu'minin ("Mother of the Faithful.") Ali had been elected and saluted caliph; and now Talha and Zubayr were violating the allegiance which they had been among the very first to swear it.</p>
<p>Both protested that the oath had been forced upon them. On this point the controversy turned; and from words they fell to blows. Night interposed, but fighting was resumed the following day; and with so serious a loss to <a href="../../../b/a/s/Basra.html" title="Basra">Basra</a> that a truce was called and agreement come to, on the understanding that the facts should be ascertained from Medina. If force had really been put upon Zubayr and Talha to take the oath, then Uthman ibn Hanif, the governor, would retire and leave the city in their hands.</p>

<p>According to Shia sources, on the way to Basra in Iraq, the rebel army received news that Ali had come out of Madina in their pursuit. They decided to leave the main road and proceed to Basra through a different route. When they passed through the valley of Haw'ab, the dogs of the village surrounded Ayesha's camel, barking loudly. She was immediately worried and asked for the name of the place. When she was told it was Haw'ab, she was shocked and she cried, "Alas! Alas! I am the wretched woman of Haw'ab. The prophet of Allah had already warned me against this."</p>
<p>She was reminded of what <a href="../../../u/m/m/Umm_Salama_5a7e.html" title="Umm Salama">Umm Salama</a> hade told her:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>"I also remind you that you and I were with the prophet of Allah and he said to us: 'Which one of you will be the rider of the trained camel, at whom the dogs of Haw'ab will bark, and she will have deviated from the right path?' We said: 'We seek refuge from Allah and his prophet from that'. He touched your back and said: 'Don't be that one, O Humayra.'" Aisha said: "I remember that."</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Aisha remembered the warning of Muhammad, and she cried and said: "Take me back! Take me back!" But Talha and Zubair brought fifty men and bribed them to testify in front of her that this place was not the plain of Haw'ab.</p>
<p>Some historians consider those fifty men to be the first ones who gave a falsified group testimony in the history of Islam. <sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Bassorah_85f6.html" title="Edit section: Envoy to Medina">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Envoy to Medina</span></h3>
<p>An envoy accredited by both sides was deputed to Medina. He arrived there while and forthwith proclaimed his mission before the assembled City. The people at first were silent. At last, one declared that both Talha and Zubayr had done homage under compulsion, whereupon a great tumult arose; and the envoy, having seen and heard enough to prove diversity of view, at once took leave.</p>
<p>When the news of these things reached the caliph Ali ibn Abi Taleb, who was with his army in Najd, he addressed a letter to his Basra governor Uthman ibn Hanif. "There was no compulsion," he wrote, "on either Talha or Zubayr; neither of these my adversaries was constrained otherwise than by the will of the majority. By the Lord! if their object be to make me abdicate, they are without excuse; if it be any other thing, I am ready to consider it."</p>
<p>So when the envoy returned from Medina, and when upon his report the insurgents called on Uthman ibn Hanif to evacuate the City according to agreement, he produced the caliph's letter and refused. But the insurgents had already obtained a footing within the city. Arming themselves, they repaired to the Mosque for evening service, and, the night being dark and stormy, were not perceived until they had overpowered the bodyguard, entered the adjoining palace, and made a prisoner of the governor Uthman ibn Hanif.</p>

<p>On the following day, a severe conflict raged throughout the city, which ended in the discomfiture of Ali's party, and so the government passed into the hands of Talha and Zubayr.</p>
<p>They took seventy of the governor's officers who were in charge of the public treasury as prisoners. They brought them to Aisha who ordered that they be put to death. The life of the Basra governor Uthman ibn Hanif was spared though. Set at liberty, his head and beard were shaven, and his eyelashes and moustaches clipped; and in this sorry plight the ousted governor made the best of his way back to Ali.</p>
<p>Talha and Zubayr now made a proclamation that every citizen who had engaged in the attack on Uthman, the deceased Caliph, should be brought forth and executed. The order was carried out, and great numbers were put to death. It is reported that there were 400 men and that they were the first Muslims whose heads were cut off whilst they were patient.</p>
<p>The insurgents communicated tidings of their success to Syria, where <a href="../../../m/u/a/Muawiya_I_b2d2.html" title="Muawiya I">Muawiya I</a> ruled. Aisha also wrote letters to Kufa, Medina, and Yemen, dissuading the people from their allegiance to Ali, and stirring them up to avenge the death of Uthman.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the Citizens of Basra swore allegiance to Talha and Zubayr conjointly. To avoid appearance of rivalry, prayers were conducted alternately by a son of each.</p>
<p>Talha proclaimed an expedition against Ali, but no one responded to the call, and so his spirits fell. Thus some weeks passed, till the City was aroused by the announcement that Ali was in full march upon it, with an army on his side.</p>
<p><a name="Hasan_and_Kufa" id="Hasan_and_Kufa"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Bassorah_85f6.html" title="Edit section: Hasan and Kufa">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Hasan and Kufa</span></h3>
<p>Finding that the insurgent troops, with Aisha, Zubayr, and Talha had already passed, Ali halted for a while on the road to Basra, waiting to strengthen his army, for although joined on his march by certain loyal tribes, he still felt too weak for immediate action.</p>
<p>To Kufa he addressed a special summons, inhabited as it was by many veterans on whose loyalty he might reasonably depend; and he added force to the call by promising that Kufa should be his seat of government.</p>
<dl>
<dd>"See," he wrote, "have not I chosen your city before all other cities for my own? Unto you do I look for succour, if happly peace and unity should again prevail as it behoveth, among brethren in the faith."</dd>
</dl>
<p>But the summons was at the first unheeded. The City was made up of many factions; and from some of these the message of <a href="../../../a/i/s/Aisha.html" title="Aisha">Aisha</a>, demanding revenge for <a href="../../../u/t/h/Uthman.html" title="Uthman">Uthman</a>'s blood, had already found response.</p>
<p>Abu Musa, its governor, was unequal to the emergency. Loyal to the memory of the murdered Caliph, he yet sought to allay the ferment by a neutral course, and urged the citizens to join neither party, but remain at home. A second deputation meeting with no better success, Ali bethought him of sending his elder son Hasan, in Company with <a href="../../../a/m/m/Ammar_ibn_Yasir_9287.html" title="Ammar ibn Yasir">Ammar ibn Yasir</a>, the former governor of Kufa, to urge his cause.</p>
<p>Al-Hasan bin 'Ali was at the top of the pulpit and Ammar was below Al-Hasan. We all gathered before him. I heard Ammar saying,</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>"Aisha has moved to Al-Busra. By Allah! She is the wife of your prophet in this world and in the Hereafter. But Allah has put you to test whether you obey him (<a href="../../../a/l/l/Allah.html" title="Allah">Allah</a>) or her (<a href="../../../a/i/s/Aisha.html" title="Aisha">Aisha</a>)."</i></dd>
</dl>
<p><sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>The appeal of <a href="../../../h/a/s/Hasan.html" title="Hasan">Hasan</a>, grandson of Muhammad, had at last the desired effect. A tumult arose, and Abu Musa, unable to maintain his weak neutrality, was deposed. The Arab tribes rallied around the loyalists.</p>
<p>Soon 10,000 men, partly by land, partly by river, set out to join the Caliph, who, advancing slowly, awaited their arrival. Thus reinforced, Ali was able at last to take the field effectively, and march on the rebellious city.</p>
<p><a name="Negotiations" id="Negotiations"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Bassorah_85f6.html" title="Edit section: Negotiations">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Negotiations</span></h3>
<p><a href="../../../b/a/s/Basra.html" title="Basra">Basra</a> itself was not wholly hostile, and scores of the citizens came out to join the camp of Ali. The insurgent army, which still nearly equalled that of the <a href="../../../c/a/l/Caliph.html" title="Caliph">Caliph</a>, now marched forth with <a href="../../../t/a/l/Talha.html" title="Talha">Talha</a> and <a href="../../../z/u/b/Zubayr_ibn_al-Awwam_c0e8.html" title="Zubayr ibn al-Awwam">Zubair</a> at their head, and <a href="../../../a/i/s/Aisha.html" title="Aisha">Aisha</a> herself seated in a well-fenced litter of the camel <i>al-Askar</i>.</p>
<p>But Ali's thoughts were for peace if possible. The cry of Talha and Az-Zubeir was for vengeance against the murderers of Uthman; and against these, Ali as yet did not deny that justice should be dealt. But he was obliged to temporise. He had in his army great numbers of the very men who had risen against <a href="../../../u/t/h/Uthman.html" title="Uthman">Uthman</a>; and he felt that to inflict punishment on them, as his adversaries required, would for the present be impossible. Holding these views, he halted, still some little way from Basra, and sent forward Al-Ka'ka' (who with other leaders of renown had joined him from Kufa) to expostulate with Talha and Zubair.</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>"Ye have slain 600 men of Al-Basra,"</i> said Al-Ka'ka' to them, <i>"for the blood of Uthman; and lo! to avenge their blood, 6000 more have started up. Where is this internecine war to stop? It is peace and repose that Islam needeth now. Give that, and again the majesty of law shall be set up, and the guilty brought to justice."</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>As he spoke, Zubair, Talha and Aisha returned word that if these really were the sentiments of Ali, they were ready to submit. After several days spent in such negotiations, Ali, glad at the prospect of a bloodless compromise, advanced.</p>

<p>Ali's army recruited from the Bedawi settlements and comprised a great number of notorious besiegers of <a href="../../../u/t/h/Uthman.html" title="Uthman">Uthman</a>. Afraid of bringing these into contact with the heated army of his opponents, still breathing out fire and slaughter against them, Ali commanded that; <i>none who had shared in the attack on Uthman should for the present accompany him in his advance</i>. These in their turn, with Al-Ashtar at their head, became alarmed.</p>
<p>Talha's troops, sworn to their destruction, were double their number, if peace were patched up, no hope remained. Reasoning thus, they held a secret conclave, and came to the conclusion that their only safety lay in precipitating hostilities, and thus forcing Ali's hand to crush their enemies. Accordingly they remained behind, but with the resolve that at the right moment they would advance and throw themselves upon the enemy.</p>

<p>The army of Al Basra, numbering some 10,000 men, remained encamped on the outskirts of the city. Ali's force, advancing unopposed, halted within sight; and negotiations for peace went on, evidently substantial and sincere. Ali himself approached on horseback and Talha with Zubair rode forth to confer with him.</p>
<p>"Wherefore have ye risen against me" said Ali; "did ye not swear homage to me?" "Yea" replied Talha "but with the sword over our necks; and now our demand is that justice be executed against the murderers of Uthman." Ali replied that he no less than they held the murderers of Uthman to be guilty; he even cursed them in no measured terms, but added that for their punishment they must bide their time.</p>
<p>Zubair on his side was softened by certain words of Muhammad towards him which Ali recalled to his mind, and bound himself by an oath that he would not fight. Then they all retired. Both armies, understanding that negotiations were in progress, went to rest that night in security such as they had not felt for many weeks.</p>

<p>Towards morning, a sudden shock changed the scene. The besiegers of Uthman, during the night, carried their design into execution. Led by them, squadrons of Bedawi lances bore down, while yet dark, upon the Basra tents. In a moment all was confusion. Each camp believed that it had been attacked by the other; and the dawn found both armies drawn up, as the conspirators desired, in mortal combat against each other. In vain Ali endeavoured to hold back his men. The sense of treachery embittered the conflict. It was a strange engagement,—the first in which Muslims had crossed swords with Muslims. It resembled a battle of the old Arab times, only that for tribal rivalry were now substituted for other issues.</p>
<p>Clans were broken up, and it became in some measure a contest between the two rival cities; "The Beni Ar-Rabi'a of Al-Kufa fought against the Beni Ar-Rabi'a of Al-Basra, the Beni Modar of the one against the Beni Modar of the other," and so on, with the various tribes, and even with families, one part arrayed against the other. The Kufa ranks were urged on by the besiegers of Uthman, who felt that unless Ali conquered, they were all doomed men. The fierceness and obstinacy of the battle can be only thus accounted for. One of the combatants tells us that <i>"when the opposing sides came together breast to breast, with a furious shock, the noise was like that of washermen at the riverside."</i></p>
<p>The attitude of the leaders was in marked contrast with the bitter struggle of the ranks. Zubair, half-hearted since his interview with Ali, left the battlefield according to his promise, and was killed in an adjoining valley.</p>

<p><a href="../../../m/a/r/Marwan_I_d09c.html" title="Marwan I">Marwan ibn al-Hakam</a> shot his own general <sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup>. <a href="../../../t/a/l/Talha.html" title="Talha">Talha</a> became disabled in the leg by the shot, and carried into <a href="../../../b/a/s/Basra.html" title="Basra">Basra</a>, where he died. Bereft of their leaders, the insurgent troops gave way. They were falling back upon the city, when they passed by the camel of <a href="../../../a/i/s/Aisha.html" title="Aisha">Aisha</a>.</p>
<p>Attacked fiercely from all around, she from within her litter, held the Quran and cried out,— "Slay the murderers of 'Othman." The words ran through the retiring ranks, that "the Mother of the Faithful was in peril," and they stayed their flight to rescue her. Long the conflict raged around the camel. One after another warriors rushed to seize her standard; one after another they were cut down.</p>
<p>Of <a href="../../../q/u/r/Quraish.html" title="Quraish">Quraish</a>, 70 perished by the bridle. At last, Ali, perceiving that her camel was the rallying-point of the enemy, sent one of his captains to hamstring, and thus disable it. With a loud cry the animal fell to the ground. The struggle ceased and the insurgents retired into the city.</p>
<p>The litter, bristling with arrows like a hedgehog, was taken down, and, by desire of Ali, placed in a retired spot, where Aisha's brother <a href="../../../m/u/h/Muhammad_ibn_Abu_Bakr_e095.html" title="Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr">Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr</a> pitched a tent for her.</p>
<p>As he drew aside the curtain, she screamed at the unknown intrusion;— he said "Are thine own people, then become strange unto thee?", she exclaimed, "it is my brother!", and agreed to be led into the tent. The lady had escaped without a wound.</p>

<p>The carnage in the ill-starred Battle of Camel (for so it came to be called) was very great. The field was covered with 10,000 bodies in equal proportion on either side; and this, notwithstanding that the victory was not followed up. Ali had given orders that no fugitive should be pursued, nor any wounded soldier slain nor plunder seized, nor the privacy of any house invaded.</p>
<p>Later a great trench was dug, and into it the dead were lowered, friends and foes alike. Ali, encamped for three days without the city, himself performed the funeral service. It was a new experience to bury the dead slain in battle not against the infidels, but believer fighting against believer, brother against brother. Instead of cursing the memory of his enemies, Ali spoke hopefully of the future state of such as had entered the field, on whatever side. When they brought him the sword of <a href="../../../z/u/b/Zubair.html" title="Zubair">Zubair</a> he cursed the man who took his life; and calling to mind the feats displayed by the man that wielded it in the early battles of Islam, exclaimed:—<i>"Many a time hath this sword driven care and sorrow from the Prophet's brow."</i></p>
<p>A man named <a href="../../../a/m/r/Amr_ibn_Jarmouz_1f77.html" title="Amr ibn Jarmouz">Amr ibn Jarmouz</a> followed <a href="../../../z/u/b/Zubayr_ibn_al-Awwam_c0e8.html" title="Zubayr ibn al-Awwam">Zubair</a> and murdered him while he performed Salat. The Muslims might well mourn the memory both of <a href="../../../t/a/l/Talha.html" title="Talha">Talha</a> and Zubair, remembering how on the field of <a href="../../../u/h/u/Uhud.html" title="Uhud">Uhud</a> the Talha had saved the life of <a href="../../../m/u/h/Muhammad.html" title="Muhammad">Muhammad</a> at the peril of his own; and how often the Zubair had carried confusion into the ranks of the idolaters of Mecca. Their fall, and that of many of the Companions, was a loss to the Ummah itself, because it left the <a href="../../../q/u/r/Quraish.html" title="Quraish">Quraish</a> seriously weak in the struggle yet to be fought out between them and those Arab tribes responsible for all the misunderstanding and Uthman's Murder.</p>
<p>In fact, this victory of Ali was virtually the victory of the besiegers of Uthman, supported by the factious citizens of <a href="../../../k/u/f/Kufa.html" title="Kufa">Kufa</a>. Thence forward Ali was wholly dependent upon them. Some scholars predict that if, instead, Ali had effected a compromise with Talha and Zubair, his position would have been incomparably stronger.</p>

<p>The bearing of 'Ali was generous towards his fallen foe. Having entered the city, he divided the contents of the treasury amongst the troops which had fought on his side, promising them a still larger reward "when the Lord should have delivered Syria (Muawiyah I) into his hands."</p>
<p>But otherwise he treated friends and foes alike, and buried in oblivion animosities of the past. Marwan I and the adherents of the house of Banu Umayyad fled to their homes, or else found refuge in Syria and Muawiyah I. All that remained in the city swore fealty to Ali. The only class dissatisfied was that of the slaves and rabble, who murmured at having no share in the treasure, nor any chance of plunder. These, gathering into marauding bands, occasioned much disquietude to the Caliph, and hastened his departure from the city, with the view of checking the mischief they were bent on.</p>

<p><a href="../../../a/i/s/Aisha.html" title="Aisha">Aisha</a> was treated by Ali with the reverence due to one who bore the title of "the Prophet's spouse in this life and also in the life to come." She was now <i>45</i> years of age, but had lost little of the fire and vivacity of youth. After the battle, the Caliph visited her tent, and expressed his satisfaction at finding her unhurt; adding mildly, but half reproachfully:—<i>"The Lord pardon thee for what hath passed, and have mercy upon thee."</i> <i>"And upon thee also!"</i> was the pert and ready answer by Aisha.</p>
<p>The best house in Basra was given up to her and there she was waited on by her own adherents. Not long after, she left with a retinue of 40 maids, attended by her brother. Ali himself accompanied her a short distance on foot; and a large party went as far as the first stage to bid her farewell.</p>
<p>Proceeding to <a href="../../../m/e/c/Mecca.html" title="Mecca">Mecca</a>, she performed the <a href="../../../u/m/r/Umrah.html" title="Umrah">Umrah</a> (lesser <a href="../../../p/i/l/Pilgrimage.html" title="Pilgrimage">pilgrimage</a>); and then retired back to <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medina.html" title="Medina">Medina</a>, no more attempting to interfere with the affairs of the <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamic_State_3130.html" title="Islamic State">Islamic State</a>. Her nephew <i>Abdullah ibn Zubair</i>, retired with her. He became famous in the subsequent history of the caliphate; but that was not till Aisha had died. She spent the remainder of her days at Medina. There crowds of pilgrims visiting Muhammad's grave (her own apartment) gazed wonderingly at the once beautiful and one of the favourite wives of <a href="../../../m/u/h/Muhammad.html" title="Muhammad">Muhammad</a>; while she, garrulous in old age, became the fertile source of tradition and the narrator of incidents in Muhammad's life beginning with her earliest childhood.</p>
