<p>By <a href="../../../j/a/n/January.html" title="January">January</a> 1918, the First World War had disintegrated from a mobile conflict into one of trench warfare. On the Western Front, three British offensives, attempting to break the stalemate, has failed and resulted in 860,000 British and 590,000 French casualties, with 850,000 German losses.</p>
<p>Russia had departed from the war thanks to the Bolshevik’s revolution and peace negotiations, America had not yet established a strong fighting force in Europe, and the French Army was suffering heavily. This left only the British forces to oppose any German offensives. With new divisions freed up by the closure of the Eastern Front and victories in Italy, the German high command saw their chances of success with an offensive as favourable.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the French had disbanded many divisions in order to keep others fully manned, and the British forces had vital reinforcements withheld from them due to a conflict between British Prime Minister, <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Lloyd_George_0b0a.html" title="David Lloyd George">David Lloyd George</a> <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Expeditionary_Force_ffa2.html" title="British Expeditionary Force">British Expeditionary Force</a> commander, Field Marshal <a href="../../../d/o/u/Douglas_Haig%2C_1st_Earl_Haig_ea8a.html" title="Douglas Haig, 1st Earl Haig">Sir Douglas Haig</a>, Lloyd George feared giving more men to Haig, lest they be fed into a slaughter akin to what had been seen by the British public during 1917.</p>
<p>In contrast, German divisions were fully manned, well equipped, and experienced. General <a href="../../../e/r/i/Erich_Ludendorff_40ad.html" title="Erich Ludendorff">Erich Ludendorff</a> was tasked with planning the offensive. Three German armies (2nd, 17th and 18th), would break through the weakest section of the Allied lines, the areas of the 5th and 3rd Armies. On <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_21.html" title="March 21">March 21</a> 1918, at 0400hrs and under the cover of a heavy artillery barrage, the German offensive began. The British, part of whose defences was a 40km long stretch of poorly prepared French trenches recently taken over, were quickly forced to withdraw.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_23.html" title="March 23">March 23</a> the German forces broke through to the village of Ham and the 3rd Cavalry division, commanded by Brigadier-General A.E.W. Harman, was ordered to the village of Bouchoire along with 200 men from the Canadian Cavalry Brigade. As the German advance moved onwards, the newly formed force fought actions at Cugny, Villeselve, <a href="../../../l/a/_/La_Neuville_02e3.html" title="La Neuville">La Neuville</a> and <a href="../../../b/e/a/Beaumont.html" title="Beaumont">Beaumont</a>. On the 26th, the enemy broke through the lines, and Allied forces began a withdrawal with the force under Harman conducting rearguard actions. By this time, the German advance had travelled up to 45 kilometres into Allied positions, however by this time supply lines were beginning to be stretched, and Ludendorff diverted his objectives and thus lost some momentum of his attack while he attempted to drive a wedge through between British and French forces.</p>
<p>By the 30th, the attack was renewed, however by this time the Allied forces had rallied and received reinforcements. By the morning of the 30th, the German 23rd Saxon Division had occupied the Moreuil woods overlooking the River Arve and controlling the Amiens - Paris railway.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Moreuil_Wood_e076.html" title="Edit section: The Battle">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Battle</span></h2>
<p>At 0830hrs on the 30th, General <a href="../../../j/2E/_/J._E._B._Seely%2C_1st_Baron_Mottistone_389b.html" title="J. E. B. Seely, 1st Baron Mottistone">Seely</a> and his aides travelled towards the Moreuil woods from where his forces were stationed on the other side of the <a href="../../../a/v/r/Avre.html" title="Avre">River Avre</a>, with orders to cross the river and delay the enemy advance as much as possible. At 0930hrs, upon reaching the wood, having received fire from German forces that were occupying it, Seely ordered the Royal Canadian Dragoons to send sections to protect the village of Moreuil, while other sections were to seize the northeast corner of the wood itself. While this was being undertaken, Lord Strathcona's Horse was ordered to occupy the southeast face of the wood and disperse any German units found there (both the Canadian Dragoons and Lord Strathcona’s Horse were two units making up the Canadian Cavalry Brigade).</p>
<p>The remaining squadrons of the Canadian Cavalry Brigade were ordered to enter the wood from the Northwest, and sweep through it towards the eastern face where Lord Strathcona’s Horse was awaiting them. After being driven back from their first assault by machine gun fire, the cavalry units dismounted and proceeded to attack a second time with fixed bayonets, driving German forces from the edge of the wood and into it’s centre. Hand to hand fighting broke out in several locations with swords and pistols as Allied forces fought through the German 101st Grenadiers, who became disorganised and demoralised.</p>
<p><a name="Inside_the_wood" id="Inside_the_wood"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Moreuil_Wood_e076.html" title="Edit section: Inside the wood">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Inside the wood</span></h3>
<p>As Canadian cavalry fought through the wood, they were channel eastwards by German machine gun fire, simultaneously, units of the Canadian Dragoons were forced to wheel into the woods at the north due to German attack. This battle quickly became a series of separate engagements due to the nature of the battlefield, with units separated and dispersed inside the German formations, and the fact that horses were ineffective in the woodland led to the pace of the battle slowing down considerably.</p>
<p>By this time, the remainder of the 3rd Cavalry had crossed the river and was distributed around the wood to support various Canadian forces currently engaged with German forces, many of these reinforcements were instructed to dismount before entering the battle. At this time, units from Lord Strathcona's Horse were formed into scouting teams of around ten men each and sent to discover details about the enemy forces and positions.</p>
<p>Commander of ‘C’ company, Lieutenant Flowerdew, ordered his forces to secure the northeast corner then report back to him. Flowerdew was then ordered to cut off the German forces who were retreating to the east in the face of the Allied forces advancing through the wood. During this time, the forces dispatched by Flowerdew to the northeast corner ambushed and killed German forces looting from a French wagon, then proceeding to dismount and entered the wood under fire. Flowerdew arrived, assessed the situation, and decided that his unit would move to cut off the German retreat while the other section would help to drive the Germans from the wood.</p>
<p>By this time there were six squadrons of cavalry in the wood, planes from the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Flying_Corps_45d7.html" title="Royal Flying Corps">Royal Flying Corps</a> were also attacking German forces from overhead, dropping 109 bombs and firing 17,000 bullets. Cavalry forces approached the southwest corner of the woods, coming under heavy fire and suffering heavy casualties, they were forced to temporarily halt. Flowerdew reached high ground at the northeast corner of the wood just in time to encounter a 300 strong German force from the 101st Grenadier’s who were withdrawing. Flowerdew ordered "It's a charge boys, it's a charge!" however the bugle call was silenced by German fire before it was even sounded. During the charge, both sides were decimated, and Flowerdew was killed, with only 51 of his unit still alive.</p>
<p>By 1100 hrs. Only the southern point of the wood was still occupied by German forces. With reinforcements arriving for the British, Seely ordered the remaining Germans to be driven away. Seely ordered British artillery fire into the wood to cease so he could operate without fear of friendly fire. The Germans were routed from the wood, and the day ended with 305 Allied casualties but the wood was in Allied hands.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Moreuil_Wood_e076.html" title="Edit section: The following morning">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The following morning</span></h3>
<p>The next morning, the 31st, a German attack recaptured most of the wood, and the nearby Rifle wood one mile to the northeast. General Seely was given command of the Allied counterattack. The Canadian Brigade attacked in three waves, securing their flanks whilst moving through the wood, and engaging the enemy in hand to hand combat. Once the German forces were again driven out, they commenced heavy artillery bombardment and several counterattacks, however control of the wood remained with the Allies at the end of the day. To the northeast, Rifle wood was attacked at 0900hrs and by 1100hrs was also in Allied hands. By 1500hrs, the Allied forces were relieved by fresh divisions.</p>
<p>Despite German forces eventually regaining control of the Moreuil woods and surrounding area, Ludendorff ending the offensive on <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_5.html" title="April 5">5 April</a>, 1918.</p>

<p>The German offence had come to an end after dogged Allied resistance. Despite capturing 1930 square kilometres of territory, it was at a cost of 250’000 men killed, wounded or missing. In the poor economic state of Germany by this time in the war, they could never recover such losses. The Allies, in comparison, lost 240’000. The strength of Allied forces in defence and in slowing down the German advance in engagements such as those at Moreuil wood contributed to the defeat of the German offensive.</p>
<p>After the end of the offensive, Lloyd George sent the reinforcements to Haig. American presence also increased from 162’000 to 318’000. Ludendorff commented that it was a black day for the German army. Flowerdew’s posthumous Victoria Cross for his charge on the German forces was one of twenty awarded during the German offensive.</p>
<p>The Moreuil wood were finally taken from the Germans in August by French forces, with elements of the Canadian Cavalry taking Rifle wood.</p>
