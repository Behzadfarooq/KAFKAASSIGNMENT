<p>I do not feel that the article, as currently written, gives an accurate depiction of the 7th Infantry Division's participation. First, only parts of the 7th, to be precise roughly 1/3rd of the division, was in or near the battle at all. The major units of the 7th which were present include Task Force MacLean/Faith, located east of the reservoir and northeast of the Marines and B Co. of the 31st Infantry Regiment, which formed part of Task Force Drysdale, the relief effort from the south. In other words roughly one regimental combat team, approximately 3,000 men total out of a division which numbered between 12 and 15,000 men.</p>
<p>Also, I have never read anywhere that the Marines picked up the "abandoned equipment" of the 7th and used it in their "advance to the rear." There was little or no equipment to pick up as Task Force MacLean/Faith, which was virtually destroyed and did lose all of its equipment, was miles away from the Marines, and not on their marching route south from Chosin. An Army tank company - manned by soldiers - did play an important role in the battle, fighting its way to Hagaru in company with the Marines and providing much needed firepower.</p>
<p>So, in the next day or so(this being 11-9-05)I would like to see some sources for the assertions that the Marines picked up the abandoned equipment of the presumably fleeing 7th Division, or I will alter the article to reflect what I believe is a more accurate description of the battle.</p>
<p>MY sources are: Clay Blair's, THE FORGOTTEN WAR, Times Books, NY(1987); Roy Appleman's, EAST OF CHOSIN, Texas A&amp;M Univ. Press, College Station(1987); and ENCYCLOPEDIA OF THE KOREAN WAR, Spencer Tucker, ed.,Checkmark Books(Facts on File), NY(2002).</p>
<p>Beau Martin, aka dubeaux</p>
<p>Your suspicions are correct--the story about Marines picking up abandoned equipment has no basis in fact although it is still taught to Marines in boot camp that Marines recovered abandoned army artillery (totally false). At any rate, it appears to have been deleted.</p>
<p>I added a few things in regards the army but am unskilled in restructuring the article itself. P1340 16:36, 5 November 2006 (UTC)P1340</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Glad to see this topic! I play wargames and have one on this topic, called "Semper Fi!" by The Gamers. Some good historical notes in the rulebook, and I also have a book on the subject. May add a bit to this down the road. Something that struck me in the reading (and I haven't finished) is the friction between the Army and the Marines (an Army general was the overall commander of the operation and wasn't very highly thought of by the marines who seemed to do most of the work). The battles for the hills (Fox Hill for instance) were something I would never want to be a part of, a few battalions holding off a couple of Chinese divsions over two nights. It's too bad this war is so forgotten except in M*A*S*H episodes. I'm against war myself (a paradox I know, in that I play the games) but the marines who participated in these battles have my utmost respect for their conduct in the battle itself. --<a href="../../../r/g/a/User%7ERgamble_65c4.html" title="User:Rgamble">Rgamble</a></p>
<p>As a Chinese, I could only show my utmost respect for these Chinese soldiers who fought in such an extreme condition with such poor equipments. It was them who reevaluated China to a status of great power and ended a century of impotence against foreign army. --Zhouyn</p>
<p>Welcome, Zhouyn. My father actually fought in the Chosin Reservoir with the US Marines, which is where my interest, and a great deal of information I have contributed to this article, have come from. He's expressed great respect for the skill of the Chinese forces in Korea. He told me once about one time that the US forces had trouble getting their radios to work (I'm not entirely sure whether or not this was in the Reservoir, but it was in Korea). While they were having this trouble, he heard bugles in the distance. The Chinese were using bugles to coordinate their troops in the field, and were doing a better job at it than the Americans could do with their radios.</p>
<p>It's truly interesting to learn that this battle is remembered with as much if not more pride among the Chinese as it is among the US Marines.

<p>Someone above mentioned Fox Hill. It is not mentioned in the article, nor in the wiki article on Ray Davis. It would perhaps make a nice entry in one or the other. It would more naturally belong here, but, it might be a US-POV problem. I can't write about it without using a US POV, and I gather that this article is attempting neutrality between the UN and the Chinese combatants. <a href="../../../s/i/v/User%7ESivamo_f90d.html" title="User:Sivamo">Sivamo</a> 09:29, 4 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>I read that Almond gave DSCs to Smith, Litzenberg, Murray, Beall, and Puller on Dec 4 (1950) at Hagaru-ri, but that later Smith recommended all three regimental commanders for upgrade to Navy Cross, and it was approved at least for Puller -- so probably also for Liztenberg and Murray -- does anyone know for sure if Litzenberg and Murray were awarded Navy Crosses for their leadership at Chosin? <a href="../../../s/i/v/User%7ESivamo_f90d.html" title="User:Sivamo">Sivamo</a> 10:01, 4 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

Navy Cross is the Navy/Marine equivalent of the DSC. They're both equal--there's no upgrade.</p>

<p>I am changing the result from Chinese Pyrrhic victory to just Chinese victory. Chosen reservoir wasn't a pyrrhic victory for the Chinese they defeated the UN-forces and drove them back, albeit with heavy casualties. Chosen reservoir didn’t seriously damaged the Chinese army, they could easily replace there losses. - Carl Logan</p>
<p>The definition of a Pyrrhic victory would be a victory in which the losses required to attain it exceeded the gain earned through victory. The assault by the Chinese against the 1st Marine Division and its accompanying UN units was unnecessary, as the 1st Marine Division was not going to assault forward on its own without the rest of the UN force and would have been forced to withdraw under any circumstances. The Chinese, however, decided to attempt to destroy the Division, and lost eight of their own in the process. The loss of eight divisions in an unsuccessful attempt to kill one renders this a Pyrrhic victory in terms of the specific and discrete resources expended compared to specific and discrete gains achieved. - Tommythegun</p>
<p>I agree with Tommythegun; I can't recall the specifics but all those divisions were rendered ineffective for months. P1340 16:25, 5 November 2006 (UTC)P1340</p>

<dd>I'm changing it back to "Chinese victory" independent of this discussion. IMO "pyrrhic victory" is a tactical victory that is worse than defeat. To quote the "Aftermath" section, "This campaign, with the simultaneous victory against U.S. forces to the west, was the first time in a century a Chinese army was able to defeat a Western army in a major battle, despite the heavy losses." Not only did the Chinese achieve their strategic goals after the battle, the Chinese's reputation soared in anti-American countries during the <a href="../../../c/o/l/Cold_War_f6d9.html" title="Cold War">Cold War</a> after the battle. Moreover, if <a href="../../../t/h/e/Mao%7E_The_Unknown_Story_f77e.html" title="Mao: The Unknown Story">Mao: The Unknown Story</a> and a few other controversial books could be taken seriously, losing the divisions (said to be ex-Nationalists) was actually Mao Zedong's goal. Or, if we take it from another perspective, the South Korean and US forces failed in their offensives. <a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EAranherunar_05c3.html" title="User:Aranherunar">Aran</a>|<a href="../../../a/r/a/User_talk%7EAranherunar_ee4b.html" title="User talk:Aranherunar">heru</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Aranherunar_c9f7.html" title="Special:Contributions/Aranherunar">nar</a> 07:55, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><br />
Also dont forget that even thought the Chinese lost many division during this battle against the Marines, dont forget that Mao Zedong said that he wouldnt mind to sacrifice another 10 division just to reach his goal, this prove that the Chinese still has the human resource to remain fighting.</p>
<p>Hanchi 26 November 2006</p>
<p>But we have to remember that it was a pyrrhic victory from the perspective of the Soviet Union, which had a vested economic as well as political interest in the war. The fact that Mao disagreed only made matters worse. To the American leadership only the Soviet's goal really mattered (with the notable and ultimately ironic exception of General MacArthur), and in that sense the battle and the war's eventual outcome was far from a loss for the American side. So "pyrrhic victory" would make sense if we're talking about the Communist alliance and/or the Soviet sphere of influence in Asia, but it is also understandable from a short term perspective why it would simply be called a Chinese victory. On the other hand, Mao is not a good source for determining whether or not human costs were worth it.<a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShield2_8ee2.html" title="User:Shield2">Shield2</a> 06:10, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The box is wrong in stating a <i>Pyrrhic Chinese victory</i>. From <a href="../../../p/y/r/Pyrrhic_victory.html" title="Pyrrhic victory">Pyrrhic victory</a>: "However, the Romans had a much larger supply of men from which to draw soldiers and their losses did less to their war effort than Pyrrhus's losses did to his." The chinese (unlike Pyrrhus) had the larger pool of soldiers to draw from compared to the UN forces. They lost more soldiers than their opponents, however since they could replace these losses, it was not a pyrrhic victory. --Xeeron 14:15, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

some details of retreat upon Turkish brigade's defence.
</pre>
<p>"(The Turkish perspective from "The Korean War -- a short history by the Turkish War Veterans Association.)</p>
<p>The Turkish Brigade has been the subject of the world's praise, by showing a very superior combat capability which provided our state with honor through the successes it won one after another during the three year period of blood and fire starting from the hardest and most critical moment it entered the battlefield until the signing of the "Ceasefire" agreement. Because addressing all the battles of the Turkish Brigades, however briefly, will extend the subject, we will just suffice to list the battles fought and briefly address the most important ones.</p>
<p>The Turkish brigades, between the dates of November 1950 and July 1953, have fought the following battles the Kunuri diversion; the Kumyangjangni-Illi-431-639 -Imjin attacks; 22/23 April 1951; the Chorwon-Seoul diversion; the Taegyewonni defense; the Barhar-Kumhwa-701 attacks; and the Wegas defense battles. We will not just talk here about the battles accomplished by our Brigades--for the Turkish brigades have accomplished all their war tasks without default but about four important battles which affected the course of the war. And these are the battles of Kunuri, Kumjangjangni, Taegyewonni and Wegas.</p>
<p>The Kunuri Battle</p>
<p>The United Nations Forces started to attack on the morning of 24 November 1950, under the command of Five Star General Douglas MacArthur with the objective being the Yalu River (Border Line). At this time the Turkish Brigade was constituting the reserve force of the IXth Army Corps, 3.5 km. west southwest of the town of Kunuri. The attacks of the United Nations Forces had easily developed until the evening of 25 November. However the attacks of the Chinese which started as raids on the night of 25/26 November 1950, created great surprise and confusion at the fronts.</p>
<p>When morning came on 26 November it was understood that the Chinese Forces had penetrated the front of the II'nd South Korean Army Corps situated in the Central Segment of the front and that they had stalked behind the U.S. Divisions situated on the western segment of the front. Especially the Chinese Forces, advancing towards Tokchon from the area of the II (Second) South Korean Army Corps had started to threaten the Eighth Army and specifically the IXth (U.S.) Army Corps.</p>
<p>Therefore upon the IX Army Corps advance the Turkish Brigade on reserve against the forces threatening its eastern side and back. After dusk on 26 November the Turkish Brigade began to march by way of the Kunuri-Kaechon-Sinnimni-Wawon-Tokchon. The Brigade was given the task of capturing the town of Tokchon. The Turkish Brigade had started to advance towards the battlefield having undertaken a very rare and heavy war task which reserves could ever meet against disproportional enemy forces and under negative conditions.</p>
<p>Having spent the night in Wawon the Brigade restarted to march at 0530 in the morning (27 November). As the units were crossing the steep Karill Yon Mountain and as the Advance Guard were descending on the Tokchon Valley (1430 hrs) the Army Corps gave the order "Do not advance any further and get on the defensive on the line which you have reached." General Tahsin RAZICI having read in the order the seemingly innocent and unimportant news "If you do not have troops in Changsangni, our aircraft have identified a force about the size of a regiment whose nationality is unknown" perceived a danger and ordered the Turkish Brigade to get on the defensive not where the Army Corps ordered, but on the Wawon line 15 km, back west. General Yazici's decision would take the Turkish Brigade back from the point of destruction and bring it to a point which would prevent the destruction of the allied forces.</p>
<p>Let us briefly dwell here. We have to show the degree of validity of the claim that "the U.S. general spent the Brigade by using it as a pawn" which had been tried to be imposed on our public. When our accounts are looked at it is obvious how General Tahsin Yazici took responsibility whenever required to protect the existence of the Brigade and to successfully implement the tasks of war. General Yazici never gave in to the short and dark orders of the U.S. generals such as Stop-Go.The reinforced Reconnaisance Unit which was the rear guard of the Brigade prevented the enemy from striking the Brigade at night, by distracting the enemy raid which started on the night of 27/28</p>
<p>November at 2400 until dawn on 28 November. At 0800 hours on 28 November the Wawon Battle of the Brigade began. That day all of the attacks of the numerically superior enemy forces first against the Pass Axis and then against the Pass' Points of Shoulder were broken. In the fore-noon the close enveloping operations were defeated with our counter offensives. In the afternoon upon the efforts of the enemy to cut the Kunuri-Wawon road by transferring forces to the back beyond the effective area of the Brigade, General Yazici ordered preparations to be made for the withdrawal of the Brigade to the Sinnimni segment. It was understood that both sides of the Brigade were open and that friendly forces had withdrawn. We would want to strongly emphasize this point.</p>
<p>During the Korean War the enemy always found the opportunity to surround the Brigade by penetrating neighboring friendly unit fronts. But no enemy attack ever succeeded in penetrating the front of the Turkish Brigade. The Brigade started to withdraw to the Sinnimni segment from Wawon after dusk at 1830 hours. The units which withdrew to Sinnimni hastily started to occupy defensive positions. At 2400 hours the attack of the enemy started in the form of a raid. While the units which were situated in favorable terrain continued to defend, the other units of the Brigade failing to hold started to withdraw towards Kunuri. Part of the units which had withdrawn were stopped west of Sinnimni through the tough and resolved stance of the Brigade Command and put in a new defensive position.</p>
<p>Fore-noon on 29 November an attack was undertaken with an Infantry Company to save the II'nd Battalion and the 2nd Company which were under enemy encirclement in Sinnimni. The enemy circle was broken and the safe withdrawal of the units to Kaechon was provided for. The attacks undertaken by the enemy in the afternoon against the Kaechon position were destroyed to their last soldiers. However the forces which the enemy sent beyond the effective area of the Brigade to the back could not be stopped.</p>
<p>Faced with this situation, at 1530 hours General Tahsin Yazici ordered the II'nd and III'rd Battalions to withdraw to the west of Kaechon. Before the battalions could get 2 km. away from Kaechon, they were divided into small groups by the effective fires they received from three directions. As the Brigade was entering the night of 29/30 November, the Hacham-Kunuri road was cut and the enemy circle was complete. At 1715 hours the I'st Battalion which had withdrawn from Kaechon engaged in combat in the Hacham circle. Although the units were dispersed and liaison and management was non existent, the small groups managed by the young officers started to break the enemy circle. The Brigade succeeded in getting out of the Hacham circle through attack and infiltration actions which continued all night long.</p>
<p>On 30 November 1950 the various groups advancing to Sunchon from the south of Tunuri met with a new enemy circle here. The Sunchon Pass had been under enemy control for the past two days. The attacks which the 2nd US Division undertook from the north and the British Brigade from the south had not produced results. After a short rest, our infantry started to attack the enemy which had dug in on the Sunchon Pass. With this attack in which US Infantry and tanks also participated the pass was opened.</p>
<p>The bayonet of the Turkish Infantry had once again asserted its rule, and had opened the Sunchon Pass where the 2nd Division had come up against a stone wall. Thus the battles of the Brigade which were given the name Kunuri came to an end in a successful conclusion. The Turkish Brigade had succeeded to provide the necessary time and space for the withdrawal by preventing the encirclement of the Eighth Army and the IXth Army Corps and the destruction of the 2nd US Division, through the battles it fought on the dates of 27-30 November. The Turkish Brigade, which had no war experience, was affecting a great battle from its roots, was saving the friendly Army, which was starting to roll down a dangerous cliff, by stopping the superior numbers of enemy forces. Thus the Brigade was achieving fame in the world by playing an important role in the course of the war in its first battle. CASUALTIES:904 Killed and missing,2068 wounded,244 P.O.W.</p>
<p>Echoes of the Kunuri Battle</p>
<p><br />
"4500 soldiers in the middle of the firing line have known how to create miracle. The sacrifices of the Turks will eternally remain in our minds." - Washington Tribune</p>
<p>"The courageous battles of the Turkish Brigade have created a favorable effect on the whole United Nations Forces." - Time</p>
<p>"The surprise of the Korean battles were not the Chinese but the Turks. It is impossible at this moment to find a word to describe the heroism which the Turks have shown in the battles." - Abent Post</p>
<p>"The Turks have shown in Kunuri a heroism worthy of their glorious history. The Turks have gained the admiration of the whole world through their glorious fighting in the battles." - Figaro</p>
<p>"The Turks who have been known throughout history by their courage and decency, have proved that they have kept these characteristics, in the war which the United Nations undertook in Korea." - Burner - U.S. Congressman</p>
<p>"There is no one left who does not know that the Turks, our valuable allies, are hard warriors and that they have accomplished very great feats at the front." - Claude Pepper, U.S. Senator</p>
<p>"I now understand that the vote I gave in favor of assistance to Turkey was the most fitting vote I gave in my life. Courage, bravery and heroism are the greatest virtues which will sooner or later conquer. In this matter, I know no nation superior to the Turks." - Rose - U.S. Senator</p>
<p>"While the Turks were for a long time fighting against the enemy and dying, the British and Americans were withdrawing. The Turks, who were out of ammunition, affixed their bayonets and attacked the enemy and there ensued a terrible hand to hand combat. The Turks succeeded in withdrawing by continuous combat and by carrying their injured comrades on their backs. They paraded at Pyongyang with their heads held high." - G.G. Martin - British Lieutenant General</p>
<p>"The Turkish forces have shown success above that expected in the battles they gave in Korea." - General Collings - Commander US Army</p>
<p>"We owe the escape of thousands of United Nations troops out of a certain encirclement to the heroism of the Turkish soldiers. The Turkish soldiers in Korea have added a new and unforgettable page of honor to the customs and legends of heroism of the Turkish nation." - Emanuel Shinwell - U.K. Minister of Defense</p>
<p>"The heroic soldiers of a heroic nation, you have saved the Eighth Army and the IX'th Army Crops from encirclement and the 2nd Division from destruction. I came here today to thank you on behalf of the United Nations Army." - General Walton H. Walker, Commander, Eighth Army</p>
<p>"The Turks are the hero of heroes. There is no impossibility for the Turkish Brigade." - General Douglas MacArthur - United Nations Forces Commander in Chief</p>
<p>"The military situation in Korea is being followed with concern by the whole American public. But in these concerned days, the heroism shown by the Turks has given hope to the American nation. It has inculeated them with courage. The American public fully appreciates the value of the services rendered by the Turkish Brigade and knows that because of them the Eighth American Army could withdraw without disarray. The American public understands that the United Nations Forces in Korea were saved from encirclement and from falling in to the hands of the communists by the heroism shown by the Turks." - 2</p>
<p>December 1950, from the commentary of a US radio commentator The Turkish Brigade, as can be understood from the summary of the Kunuri battles and the echoes it produced in the world, had successfully accomplished its mission. The Brigade was proud to have informed the country of the news of success which the state and nation expected, at the highest level. A handful of soldiers had provided the state with power, great opportunities and esteem. "</p>

<p>Someone who has a good military history book of the Korean War must get to work immediately to fix this article. Most of it is just cut and paste from other sites, and the part that isn't is just written sloppily. The article repeats itself and is not, in my opinion, from a completely neutral POV. Notice the list of Americans who got medals, but not only does it not mention any Chinese soldiers, it doesn't mentioned anybody from the UN allies either.

<p>You're right. The article is lousy as is. I might try to completely revise it, but right now I haven't got the time to do the necessary research. I do suggest, if you are interested and have the time, to check out Clay Blair's excellent history of the Korean War, THE FORGOTTEN WAR, which has a very good account of the Chosin Reservoir.</p>
<p>As for the lack of mention of individual Chinese participants, there is, even today, very little in English(indeed, virtually nothing)from the Chinese side. Many of the generals who commanded Chinese units were later disgraced during the Cultural Revolution of the 1960's, or otherwise fell out of favor with Mao's regime. The few Chinese accounts(translated)I've seen of the war are little more than formulaic communist diatribes where the virtuous peasant-soldiers of Mao trounce the evil capitalist war-dogs of the West.</p>
<p>It would be great to have the story of the Chosin campaign from both sides.</p>
<p>But you can't write history worthy of the name based on the Chinese propaganda currently available. BEAU MARTIN/dubeaux</p>
<dl>
<dd>Great work starting the article but even to get more balance on the UN side would be good. The article starts with describing things from the US/ UK perspective then half way through forgets about anything but the US. The impression is that all the other UN forces had packed up and gone home at this point.--82.133.79.7 23:39, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Not all Chinese war diary was written by Leaders or generals or "propaganda", dont you think the American side use "propaganda" as well? For example by praising the small victory for the Marines as a "Feel Good" factors. Anyways there are alot of none written accounts about Korean War by surviving Chinese veterans who fought in the war, but doesnt have the writing skill to put it down, most of their story is just "memories". Also in Hong Kong there are written study of the Korean War from the Chinese point of view, and just because its written by a Chinese doesnt mean its going to be "propaganda" (Must all "Neutral" view be written by a "Westerncentric" point of view?).</p>
<p>Hanchi 00:18 16 Januari 2006 Greenwhich Time.</p>
<p>To Hanchi: I'm all in favor, as I said above, of including Chinese accounts of Chosin Reservoir. However, until recently, there have been no translated accounts generally available in the USA(my location)that were not mere propaganda. This situation is changing and as soon as I or other interested parties, competent in English, obtain and study such accounts, I'm sure the article will be modified to integrate the Chinese POV as well as the American.</p>
<p>dubeaux 14 May 2006</p>
<dl>
<dd>The admitted POV of this article is just evidence of a systemic problem here - you can only cite sources in English, and the vast majority of information about the Korean War from the DPRK or Chinese side hasn't been translated. I also think it's wrong to dismiss all Chinese accounts that seem too optimistic or positive as pure propaganda. The Volunteers were an incredible bunch of soldiers on an individual level, and you can't get that without high morale as well. Of course, there are plenty of propagandistic accounts, but we shouldn't silence all aspects that don't fit with the UN forces line. <a href="../../../d/e/l/User%7EDeleuze_eace.html" title="User:Deleuze">Deleuze</a> 09:42, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
