<p><b>Battle of Nahrawan</b> was a battle between <a href="../../../a/l/i/Ali_ibn_Abu_Talib_a9ac.html" title="Ali ibn Abu Talib">Ali ibn Abu Talib</a> (the 4th Sunni <a href="../../../c/a/l/Caliph.html" title="Caliph">Caliph</a> and the 1st Shi'a Imam) and the <a href="../../../k/h/a/Kharijites.html" title="Kharijites">Kharijites</a>.</p>
<p>After the unsatisfactory conclusion to the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Siffin_3bb8.html" title="Battle of Siffin">Battle of Siffin</a>, <a href="../../../i/m/a/Imam.html" title="Imam">Imam</a> Ali ibn Abu Talib returned with his army back to Kufa on the 13th of Safar 37 A.H. During the march, a group of 12,000 men kept themselves at a distance from the main part of the army.</p>
<p>The group was furious at the way things had ended at Siffin. These were the Kharijites. They were the same people who had put down their weapons on the battlefield. Now they said that Ali ibn Abu Talib had betrayed Islam by agreeing to the truce and should have referred judgment to the Holy <a href="../../../q/u/r/Quran.html" title="Quran">Quran</a> alone or continued to fight. They demanded that he repent for this great sin.</p>
<p>When the army neared <a href="../../../k/u/f/Kufa.html" title="Kufa">Kufa</a>, the Kharijites camped at a village named Harura. They started saying that all Muslims were equal and nobody could rule over the other. In this way, they denounced both Ali ibn Abu Talib and <a href="../../../m/u/a/Muawiyah.html" title="Muawiyah">Muawiyah</a> and said that their belief was in "La Hukma Illa Lillah", meaning, "No Ruler ship except by <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allah.html" title="Allah">Allah</a> alone."</p>
<p>Ali ibn Abu Talib sent Sasaa ibn Sauhan and Ziad ibn Nazr Harisi in the company of ibn Abbas towards them and afterwards himself went to the place of their stay and tried to explain to them that they were misunderstanding the words "La Hukma Illa Lillah", and that in accepting the arbitration (peace talks) at Siffin, he had not gone against the teachings of the Holy Quran.</p>
<p>He pointed out that they themselves were at fault, because they should never have laid down their arms and forced him to call back <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malik_ibn_Ashter_2141.html" title="Malik ibn Ashter">Malik ibn Ashter</a>, who was at the point of securing victory. He reminded them that they had pressed for the arbitration and had forced him to appoint Abu Musa Ash'ari as their representative. He told them that he found their present behavior very strange, considering their involvement in Siffin. To this they admitted that they had sinned but now they had repented for it and he should do the same.</p>
<p>Ali ibn Abu Talib replied that he was a true believer and did not have to repent because he had not committed any sin and dispersed them after discussion.</p>
<p>The Kharijites refused to accept the words of Ali ibn Abu Talib and awaited the decision of Amr al-Aas and Abu Musa Ash'ari. When they learnt of the decision they decided to revolt, and they set up their headquarters at Nahrawan, twelve miles from Baghdad. Some people came from <a href="../../../b/a/s/Basra.html" title="Basra">Basra</a> to join the rebels.</p>
<p>On the other side, after hearing the verdict of Arbitration Ali ibn Abu Talib rose for fighting the army of Syria and wrote to the Kharijites that the verdict passed by the two arbitrators in pursuance of their heart's wishes instead of the Quran and Sunnah was not acceptable to him, that he had therefore decided to fight with them and they should support him for crushing the enemy. But the Kharijites gave him this reply, "When you had agreed to Arbitration in our view you had turned heretic. Now if you admit your heresy and offer repentance we will think over this matter and decide what we should do." Ali ibn Abu Talib understood from their reply that their disobedience and misguidance had become very serious. To entertain any kind of hope from them now was futile. Consequently, ignoring them he encamped in the valley of an-Nukhaylah with a view to marching towards Syria to fight against Muawiyah.</p>
<p>Ali ibn Abu Talib had already started towards Muawiyah when he received the news that they had butchered the governor of Nahrawan namely Abdullah ibn Khabbab ibn al-Aratt and his slave maid with the child in her womb, and have killed three women of Banu Tayyi and Umm Sinan as-Saydawiyyah. Ali ibn Abu Talib sent al-Harith ibn Murrah al-Abdi for investigation but he too was killed by them. When their rebellion reached this stage it was necessary to deal with them. There was a danger that the Kharijites might attack Kufa while Ali ibn Abu Talib and his men were marching towards Muawiyah, so Ali ibn Abu Talib decided to stop them. He changed his course eastward, crossed the river Tigris and approached Nahrawan.</p>
<p>On reaching there Ali ibn Abu Talib sent a messenger to the Kharijites demanding that those people who had murdered innocent Muslims around their camp should be surrendered. The Kharijites replied that they were all equally responsible for killing these sinners.</p>
<p>There was some reluctance in the army of Ali ibn Abu Talib to fight the Kharijites, because they had been their companions against Muawiyah at Siffin. Ali ibn Abu Talib himself did not desire the bloodshed of these misguided fanatics, so he sent Abu Ayyub al-Ansari with a message of peace. So he spoke to them aloud, "Whoever comes under this banner or separates from that party and goes to Kufa or al-Mada'in would get amnesty and he would not be questioned. As a result of this Farwah ibn Nawfal al-Ashja'i said that he did not know why they were at war with Ali ibn Abu Talib. Saying this he separated along with five hundred men. Similarly group after group began to separate and some of them joined Ali ibn Abu Talib. In the end, only cores of 1,800 die-hards were left under the command of Abdullah ibn Wahab. These Kharijites swore that they would fight Ali ibn Abu Talib at any cost.</p>
<p><br />
<b>Nahjul Balagha - Sermon 36/Warning the people of Nahrawan of their fate:</b></p>
<dl>
<dd><i>"I am warning you that you will be killed on the bend of this canal and on the level of this low area while you will have no clear excuse before Allah nor any open authority with you. You have come out of your houses and then divine decree entangled you. I had advised you against this arbitration but you rejected my advice like adversaries and opponents till I turned my ideas in the direction of your wishes. You are a group whose heads are devoid of wit and intelligence. May you have no father! (Allah's woe be to you!) I have not put you in any calamity nor wished you harm."</i></dd>
</dl>
<p><br />
The Kharijites attacked Ali ibn Abu Talib army with desperate courage. However, they did not stand a chance against the superior army that faced them and they were all killed except nine men. These nine managed to flee to Basra and elsewhere, where they spread the fire of their hatred and recruited more followers. From Ali ibn Abu Talib's army suffered only eight casualties, people whom Ali's followers regard as 'martyrs'. The battle took place on the 9th Safar, 38 A.H. Two years later, in 40 A.H., it was the Kharijites who sent out three assassins to kill Ali ibn Abu Talib, Muawiyah and Amr al-Aas. The latter two survived but Ali ibn Abu Talib was assassinated following ibn Muljim's cowardly attack in the mosque of Kufa.</p>
<p>Having disposed of the Kharijites at Nahrawan, Ali ibn Abu Talib resumed his march to Syria. However, the chiefs of his followers urged him to stop at Kufa to let the men rest before the long journey and to enable the army to repair their weapons and armors. Ali ibn Abu Talib agreed to this request and camped at Nukhayla outside Kufa. The soldiers were allowed to leave the camp for a day.</p>
<p>On the next day, hardly any men returned and at length, Ali ibn Abu Talib entered Kufa and gave a stern sermon to the people. However, nobody came forward and finally, Ali ibn Abu Talib turned away from them in disappointment. The Syrian expedition was abandoned, never to be resumed.</p>
