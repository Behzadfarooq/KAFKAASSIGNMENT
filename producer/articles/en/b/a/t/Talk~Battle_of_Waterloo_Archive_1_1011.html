<p>In the battle box it states only 25,000 prussians engaged but later in the article it is stated that 30,000 prussians attacked Plancenoit. Shouldn't someone fix the battle box?</p>
<hr />
<p><br />
The 106000 men mentioned in the article sound like the entire anglo-allied army under Wellingyons command. I think just 67000 men of the Anglo allied army were fielded at Waterloo.</p>
<p>Cadr, you removed the section: After an hour, in the centre and on the French right flank, he committed general d'Erlons I corps to the assault. Wellingtons habbit of positioning his troops just after the crest shielded them from the worst of the French artillery. Throughout the 18th, Ney assaulted the Allied line with alternating infantry attacks and cavalry charges.</p>
<p>At about 14.00 elements of the Prussian IV and I corps started to arrive at the battle field and put pressure on the French right flank. When at the end of the afternoon, Napoleon ordered an assault of his Old Guard aggainst the battered and exhausted British line, the experienced French Old Guard did not manage</p>

<hr />
<p>Reading through this article again, I think it was a good article one or two years ago. But imho it is time for a major expansion. The description of the actual battle is just some 13 lines. I am sure there is much more to sy about this battle. For example, elements which are missing are the wet grass on the morning of the battle, thea map of the battlefield, the position of the French and Allied units at the start of the battle, Napoleons health(stomach), the misunderstanding between Dutch/Belgian troops and Prussian troops, more detail of the fight in the center, which british units which repelled the final assault of the French old guard, Wellintons reverse slope tactics, names of the farms on Wellingtons left, (papelotte, I think, was one of them), and so on.</p>
<p>Also, except for the Prussians, about whose participation has been much debate, the order of battle is pretty clear. This could be added to the article.</p>
<p>Who is willing to undertake a major rewrite of this article? I will not, as I am afrain someone will throw away my contributions again (the previous deletion, without any attempt at explanation, still hurts me)<a href="../../../t/e/u/User%7ETeunSpaans_fef5.html" title="User:TeunSpaans">TeunSpaans</a> 06:17 10 Jun 2003 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Timing</span></h2>
<p>There seems to be some confusion in the sources about what happened when. Part of this may be due to watches being set to the time of the capitals of the combatants and not sun time. However because London and Paris are quite close this should not be much of a problem.</p>
<p>I think all times in the battle shoud be on the 24 hour clock. At the moment it is a mishmash of both 24:00 and am/pm.</p>
<p>There are some other problems. For example in the curren page it says:</p>
<dl>
<dd>The battle commenced at about 11:20 in the morning and concluded at about</dd>
<dd>22:00 that evening when General Cambronne surrendered to Col Halkett.</dd>
</dl>
<p>and further up the page it says</p>
<dl>
<dd>When the French artillery eventually opened fire on Wellington's ridge at around 11.35am,</dd>
</dl>
<p>THE START</p>
<p>Yet in <a href="http://www.wtj.com/archives/wellington/1815_06f.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.wtj.com/archives/wellington/1815_06f.htm" rel="nofollow">Wellington's Dispatches</a> he says "yesterday morning, and at about ten o'clock he commenced a furious attack upon our post at Hougoumont."</p>
<p>Now it is possible that the French attack on Hougoumont for went on for 1:30 before the main artillery opend up but in which case I think that the start of the attack on Hougoumont should be mentioned as the start of the battle.</p>
<p>Afterall a further contributary reason (apart from the weather) for the delay in the main artillery opening up against the centre, could be that Napoleon was trying to get Wellington to shif forces to reinforce Hougoumont before he started his major attack on the centre near the road past La Haye Sainte.</p>
<p>THE END.</p>
<p>The pursuit of the French by the British went on for more 2 hours after the Last Stand and by the Prussians for longer than that.</p>
<p>So the simplest point to say that the battle finished was when Wellington and Blücher met at the inn La Belle Alliance, which was around around 21:00 hours. It was NOT when General Cambronne surrendered to Col Halkett because that was before the French last stand was over <a href="http://www.napoleon-series.org/research/miscellaneous/c_cambronne.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.napoleon-series.org/research/miscellaneous/c_cambronne.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Links to more details</span></h2>
<p>I agree with TeunSpaans I think the article needs expanding, and I think this should be done with links to other pages. That way people can read a summary of the battle here and details in the links. Just as happens with the current links of Hougomont, La Haye Sainte and La Belle Alliance. For example some usefull links would be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Franco Prussian confrontation.</li>
<li>The French last stand.</li>

<dd>I agree with you (and TeunSpaans) that this article is inadequate. I had been thinking that Waterloo would make an excellent signature article for <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Battles_64fd.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Battles">WikiProject Battles</a>; it's well known, well documented, relatively short, and shouldn't arouse too much argument (wishful thinking). However, I've got zero knowledge on the subject so can't really contribute much (I can do a map of the movements leading up to the battle; Ligny, Wavre, Quatre Bras and Waterloo, but that's about it). Anyway, you have my support if you want to make the necessary changes. <a href="../../../g/s/l/User%7EGsl_d00e.html" title="User:Gsl">Geoff/Gsl</a> 04:40, 17 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I looked in the <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia%7EManual_of_Style_350a.html" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style">Wikipedia:Manual of Style</a> and can not see a prohibition on quotes in the lead section. Where is it? But I did see:</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>Rules and regulations such as these, in the nature of the case, cannot be endowed with the fixity of rock-ribbed law. They are meant for the average case, and must be applied with a certain degree of elasticity.</b></dd>
</dl>
<p>I also looked in the <a href="../../../l/e/a/Wikipedia%7ELead_section_3c3e.html" title="Wikipedia:Lead section">Wikipedia:Lead section</a> There is nothing there that says that <i>"All articles must first start with a definition"</i>. What it says is <b>The lead should briefly summarize the article. It is even more important here than for the rest of the article that the text is accessible, and some consideration should be given to creating interest in reading the whole article (see Wikipedia:Summary style and News style).</b> I think the quote is a brief summery of the battle and in <b>creating interest in reading the whole article</b> is appropriate.</p>
<p>This is a very sensitive battle for many Europeans (as you are not one, you may not appreciate it,) particularly Dutch, English, French and Germans, but few of them would disagree with the quote. There are much more contentious quotes which could be used at the start of the article and I would agree with removing because they could be defined as a point of view (POV) e.g.</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>"They came on in the same old way and we stopped them in the same old way"</i> – <a href="../../../a/r/t/Arthur_Wellesley%2C_1st_Duke_of_Wellington_10be.html" title="Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington">Duke of Wellington</a></dd>

<dd>Sigh. Having to mention plainly obvious things is really annoying: A lead section needs to start with a lead sentence.

<hr />
<p>I don't think any article should begin with a quote. Put it in a later paragrapgh is you have to. But don't begin the article with it. If you do that we could just as easily argue for starting the article with a quote from Napoleon or Blücher. <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMintguy_d760.html" title="User:Mintguy">Mintguy</a> <a href="../../../m/i/n/User_talk%7EMintguy_20fd.html" title="User talk:Mintguy">(T)</a> 16:51, 20 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>If Napoleon or Blücher had said something which succinctly summed up the battle and is not controversial, then a quote from either or them would be suitable, but AFAIK they did not. Think of as a <a href="../../../s/o/u/Sound_bite.html" title="Sound bite">sound bite</a> about the battle not as quote. If the sentence was included in the lead section without attribution then presumably you would not object to it as it is an accurate summery. Why do you object to it as a quote? As an example of what I mean have a look at the style used by <b>The Economist</b>. For example one of their lead articles published this week 21th July entitled "<i><a href="http://www.economist.co.uk/agenda/displayStory.cfm?story_id=2940895" class="external text" title="http://www.economist.co.uk/agenda/displayStory.cfm?story_id=2940895" rel="nofollow">Alan Greenspan’s testimony</a></i>", subtitle "<i>your flexible friend</i>" first sentence "<i>The hard times are behind us, says Alan Greenspan.</i>" or another article in the business section printed edition 15th July "<i><a href="http://www.economist.co.uk/printedition/displayStory.cfm?Story_ID=2922951" class="external text" title="http://www.economist.co.uk/printedition/displayStory.cfm?Story_ID=2922951" rel="nofollow">Stuart Rose and the future of retailing</a></i>" "<i>A Rose-tinted vision</i>", "<i>Has Stuart Rose seen the future of retailing? 'A BIT boring,' is how Stuart Rose describes some of the products sold by Marks &amp; Spencer (M&amp;S).</i>"</p>
<p>The news section that you highlighted mav is for journalists who can not know how short their article will be edited down too given the changing nature of news in a daily news paper, so they have to use a pyramid style. I my opinion the <a href="http://www.economist.com/research/styleGuide/" class="external text" title="http://www.economist.com/research/styleGuide/" rel="nofollow">weekly news magazine style</a> is a better guide, as journalists know the number of words they will be allocated and can therefore break out of the highly stylized format of daily papers. There is no need to <i>Sigh</i> mav, as in the words of Keynes "<i>when the facts change I change my opinion, what do you do?</i>" If you can convince me that it is better not to use a quote at the start then I'll happily agree with you, but so far you have not and I hope that I have given you food for thought <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Baird_Shearer_a81d.html" title="User:Philip Baird Shearer">Philip Baird Shearer</a> 20:46, 21 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">More on Quotes</span></h2>
<p>As about the quote, i think it can be moved to a seperate quotes section, where the 'merde' of the french imperial guards officer can also be included. No doubt old Nap also made a nice statement. <a href="../../../t/e/u/User%7ETeunSpaans_fef5.html" title="User:TeunSpaans">TeunSpaans</a> 06:00, 19 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>I do not think that the quote should be moved. As I said before think of it as a sound bite. There are lots of other quotes which could be included in a quotes section but I think thay are better in context. For example under <b>Scots Greys</b> you will find a Napoleonic quote <i>Ces terribles chevaux gris! Comme il travaillent!</i> and you can find the word(s) of Cambronne' in the article on the <b>Imperial Guard</b> both on links from this page. BTW following the link to Cambronne you will see that he almost certainly did not utter the imortal phrase and that if anyone did it was <b>General Michel</b>.</p>
<p>What would be much more useful in this article than a list of quotes, is a detailed descrition of the last stand of the Imperial Guard and the fighting retreat some French regiments made. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Baird_Shearer_a81d.html" title="User:Philip Baird Shearer">Philip Baird Shearer</a> 17:48, 21 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Dutch-Belgians at Waterloo</span></h2>
<p><i>Wellington's hodge-podge command consisted of British, German, Dutch and Belgian troops. Some of these were of very poor quality (some Belgian and Dutch had even fought in the French Army and were thus sympathetic towards Napoleon), and ran away before the conflict began.</i></p>
<p>Um, this bit is utter nonsense and very POV. Most Dutch and Belgians did not support the occupation and annexation of their country by Napoleon, and liked even less that their men-folk were rounded up to be used as cannon fodder for the Russian campaign. Many Dutch officers were indeed veterans from Dutch regiments in French service, but those same officers led their soldiers with distinction while holding off the French at Quatre Bras (though sadly the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Quatre_Bras_bc5a.html" title="Battle of Quatre Bras">Battle of Quatre Bras</a> article also suffers from the same Anglo-centric themes). As <a href="http://web2.airmail.net/napoleon/Waterloo_Cowards.html" class="external text" title="http://web2.airmail.net/napoleon/Waterloo_Cowards.html" rel="nofollow">this site</a> mentions, the Dutch-Belgian regiments at Waterloo were only forced to retreat after enduring an artillery bombardment and repelling several infantry assaults. No cavalry charge came to their rescue, unlike what happened when British regiments were similarly pressed.</p>
<p>While English-language popular history texts, movies and television programmes emphasise the British contribution, the British-born were in fact a minority of the total Allied forces at Waterloo - Germans and Belgian-Dutch made up the majority! <a href="http://hnn.us/roundup/comments/8630.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://hnn.us/roundup/comments/8630.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> --<a href="../../../k/u/d/User%7EKudz75_c95a.html" title="User:Kudz75">kudz75</a> 01:58, 10 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>It is true that if one looks at the popular histories of each country that each country fought a different battle! I personally was never happy with the paragraph as it was because it was open to different interpretations. I think that what the original author meant was</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Wellington's hodge-podge command consisted of British, German, Dutch and Belgian troops. Some of these were of very poor quality and ran away before the conflict began.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>It does not specify which nation's troops ran and it only states that "some" did. However as it is a slur and the regiments (if any) that ran away ought to be named, or the paragraph ought to be removed.

<dd>You're quite right, while I was re-writing the paragraph I had a nagging thought that it didn't seem to belong in the Conclusion anymore but since the running-away stuff was already there...

<p>I have a 1902 history book with a color painting in it titled The Sunken Road at Waterloo, by Stanley Berkley. It shows a bunch of cavalry running off the edge of a hill above a road. If it seems like it might be useful, please give me a holler on my talk page, and I'll scan it in and post it.

<p>&gt; "I have a 1902 history book with a color painting in it titled The Sunken Road at Waterloo... Great picture, can someone put something in the article about the sunken road itself?..."</p>
<p>Here is what Victor Hugo says about it, writing 35 years later: my translation -- from "Les Misérables" (Livre de Poche) v. 1 <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 2-253-00503-7</a>, pages shown below --</p>
<p>"The undulations of the farm fields where Napoleon met Wellington no longer exist -- no one remembers what they were, on June 18, 1815. In taking over this funereal scene, for the building of monuments, they have removed the real geography of the place, and the history has been so disturbed that it no longer is remembered. To glorify it, they disfigured it. Wellington, revisiting Waterloo two years after, cried, 'They have changed my battlefield!'.</p>
<p>"Where today there is that enormous earthen pyramid surmounted by a lion, at the time of the battle there was a hillcrest, which fell toward Nivelles in a manageable incline but toward Genappe in what amounted to an escarpment. The height of this escarpment still may be judged today from the height of two large monuments which line the Genappe road; one a tomb for the English, on the left; the other a tomb for the Germans, on the right. No tomb for the French -- for France, the entire plain is a sepulchre.</p>
<p>"Thanks to thousands upon thousands of farm carts filled with soil, today one reaches this hillcrest 150 feet high and 500 feet round via an easy ascent; but on the day of the battle, above all on the Haie-Sainte side, it was a tough and abrupt climb. The slope there was so steep that the English cannons positioned at the top could not aim below, toward the farm in the bottom of the valley at the center of the combat. On June 18, 1815 the rains had dug into this even more: the mud complicated the ascent, so that one not only fell back but sank into the bog. And for the length of the plateau crest there ran a sort of ditch, which was impossible to see for any observer who was far away...</p>
<p>"What sort of ditch? Let me tell you... Braine-l'Alleud is a Belgian village, Ohain is another. These villages, both hidden by rises in the terrain, are joined by a pathway of about one and one half leagues' length, which crosses a rolling plain, and often enters and leaves the hillocks like a plowed furrow or deep groove, so that at various points this pathway becomes a ravine. In 1815, as today, this pathway cut the crest of the Mont-Saint-Jean plateau between the two roads from Genappe and from Nivelles; only today it is at the same level as the plain; back then it was it was a sunken common pathway.</p>
<p>"Stones have been taken from this path for the building of the pyramid-monument. The path was then and is still a trench, for the greatest part of its route; a trench sometimes a dozen feet wide in which stones from its steeper sides wash out and collect, here and there, above all in wintertime during the rains. And accidents happen...</p>
<p>"The pathway is so narrow at its entry near Braine-l'Alleud that a passer-by there was crushed by a cart, as a stone cross in the nearby cemetery testifies, giving the name of the decedent, 'Monsieur Bernard Debrye, Brussels merchant', and the date of the accident, 'February 1637'.</p>
<p>"This pathway was so deep, on the plateau of the Mont-Saint-Jean, that a peasant, one Mathieu Nicaise, was crushed there in 1783 by a landslide, as another stone cross once testified -- the cross disappeared during all the refurbishments, but its pedestal still is visible on the grassy slope to the left of the road between La Haie-Sainte and the farm of Mont-Saint-Jean.</p>
<p>"On the day of battle, this little community pathway which no one knew about, bordering the crest of the Mont-Saint-Jean, this deep ditch at the summit of the escarpment, this rut in the road hidden in the earth, was invisible, in other words it was terrifying...</p>
<p>pp. 331-2</p>
<p><br />
"All at once, tragedy: on the English Left, on our Right, the head of the column of cuirrasiers reared up with a terrible roar. Arriving at the very height of the crest, wildly excited, all in their fury and on course to exterminate the English 'squares' and cannons, the cuirassiers suddenly discovered between them and the English a crevasse, a ditch. It was the community pathway of Ohain.</p>
<p>"It was a terrible moment. There was the ravine, unexpected, gaping, immediately beneath the hooves of the horses, two fathoms deep between its two sides; the second rank pushed the first in, and then the third rank pushed the second in; the horses shying, and rearing, and falling, throwing their hooves into the air, crushing their riders, no way to escape, the entire mounted column at this point being a projectile, the force gathered to crush the English thereby crushing the French, the inexorable ravine unsatisfied until it filled with bodies, horsemen and horses rolling and grinding each against the other, melding into a single fleshy mass in this whirlpool, and, once this ditch was filled with living men, the rest marched over and passed on. Nearly a third of Dubois' brigade collapsed into this abyss. And here the loss of the battle began..."</p>
<p>pp. 336-337</p>
<p><br />
-- lots of versions, both original French and in-translation, are available of all of this, online &amp; otherwise, so pls slice &amp; edit away... I have real trouble making cuts to any of Hugo's texts, myself...</p>
<p>The explanations / excuses for the performance of all at Waterloo, not just the French, have been legion. The new French prime minister blames Grouchy, in large part: see D. Villepin, "Les Cent-jours ou L'esprit de sacrifice" (2003). Others including Hugo have blamed the rain, there are partisans of the Prussians who grumble about the English and vice versa, and Napoleon's bravado and loss of perspective have had their due. But thanks to the above passage from Hugo the "sunken road" hypothesis has been a leader: read the rest of Hugo's account, for that. I expect that all theories on Waterloo are true: must have been a mess, in that mud.</p>

<p>I think it is much too long. A sound bite length quote, yes but not a page in an article pushing the limits on size. Besides the theory is not only one. I have always liked the explanation by Brigadier Gerard a creation of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle in "The Adventures of Gerard":</p>

<dd>OK how about simply that second paragraph, then -- from ""It was a terrible moment" down through "And here the loss of the battle began..." This is Victor Hugo, after all: a shame to miss out on his prose, politically correct or incorrect as his overall views might be -- and here he is only describing, &amp; pungently -- added to which we have this wonderful painting, currently lacking any explanation. The overall Wikipedia point being to provide not just facts but also something readable: soundbite length perhaps but also a real "quote", as you say, not just a bon mot. It's a dramatic juxtaposition, that painting with a really poetic description of it.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Compliments on your "solid, immovable beef" quote, incidentally. I've known a couple of Englishmen like that -- even some English relatives of my own, a ways back. As "solid" as the French are "excitable": I suppose Doyle was correct in saying those two types are what met &amp; clashed at Waterloo.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Terrain</span></h2>
<p>The Waterloo Battlefield, Victor Hugo's "mournful plain", is a small farming valley set among rolling hills. The natural gentleness of the site makes little impression from above or from afar, and so offers the map-bearing bicyclist -- or foot-soldier -- unanticipated surprises. GoogleEarth barely notices Waterloo, although focusing close-in on the valley base and then "tilting" your screen can bring the contours out a bit. On the day of the battle Napoleon, tragically for the French, overlooked or simply could not see several things through his telescope, among them a Sunken Road...</p>
<p>The French approach, from the south, leads down a gentle slope to the little farm of <i>la Belle Alliance</i>, and the valley's base. But from there the land gradually rises toward the highest "rolling hill" in the immediate region, the Mont St. Jean, across the upper slopes of which the Allied forces were positioned, just beyond the farm of <i>la Haye Sainte</i>. The French plan was to charge uphill, but that night it poured rain: in <i>Les Misérables</i> Hugo describes the result -- "today one reaches this hillcrest 150 feet high and 500 feet round via an easy ascent; but on the day of the battle, above all on the Haye-Sainte side, it was a tough and abrupt climb. The slope there was so steep that the English cannons positioned at the top could not aim below, toward the farm in the bottom of the valley at the center of the combat. On June 18, 1815 the rains had dug into this even more: the mud complicated the ascent, so that one not only fell back but sank into the bog. And for the length of the plateau crest there ran a sort of ditch, which was impossible to see for any observer who was far away..."</p>
<p>Among the many things which went wrong for Napoleon at Waterloo was that ditch, known in later battle lore as <i>The Sunken Road</i>: "a pathway of about one and one half leagues' length... like a plowed furrow or deep groove, so that at various points this pathway becomes a ravine... sometimes a dozen feet wide... hidden in the earth, (it) was invisible, in other words it was terrifying..." On the day of the battle, as Hugo tells it,</p>
<p>"It was a terrible moment. There was the ravine, unexpected, gaping, immediately beneath the hooves of the horses, two fathoms deep between its two sides; the second rank pushed the first in, and then the third rank pushed the second in; the horses shying, and rearing, and falling, throwing their hooves into the air, crushing their riders, no way to escape, the entire mounted column at this point being a projectile, the force gathered to crush the English thereby crushing the French, the inexorable ravine unsatisfied until it filled with bodies, horsemen and horses rolling and grinding each against the other, melding into a single fleshy mass in this whirlpool, and, once this ditch was filled with living men, the rest marched over and passed on. Nearly a third of Dubois' brigade collapsed into this abyss. And here the loss of the battle began..."</p>
<dl>
<dd>-- Hugo's view only, of course, that conclusion, but there are many theories as to what happened at Waterloo.</dd>

<p>It is disingenuous to emphasise the ethnic background of the soldiers as if they were fighting in the modern nation states which control the territory today and provided contingents to the army as states do to NATO. Some Hanoverian units for example were to all intense and purposes integrated into the British Army in a similar way as the Gurkhas today (see <a href="../../../h/u/g/Hugh_Halkett_35e9.html" title="Hugh Halkett">Halkett</a>). When the Gurkhas provided the screen for the British Army's advance into Kosovo no one talked about Naples taking part in the advance, although the Serbian police who met them, in what the Gurkhas called "the jungle" (woodland), could have been in no doubt about who they were. That is not to say that the units provided by other nations, such as the Dutch and others under the command of the Prince of Orange were not part of a combined Allied army, which should be mentioned, but that over emphasis of the ethnic diversity of the allied army is as bad as pretending that it was all part of a British Army. -- <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Baird_Shearer_a81d.html" title="User:Philip Baird Shearer">Philip Baird Shearer</a> 09:38, 8 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I had done so in order to provoke a strong reaction from you.

My changes were meant to serve as a wake-up call. Nothing more, nothing less. In the meantime I have amended my tone and realised, that you did incorporate some of my ammendments as well. Furthermore the tale, that Napoleon had left the battlefield is of revisionist french origin and does not hold any ground.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">cavalry attack</span></h2>
<p>David Hamilton-Williams states that at the time it was the logical thing to do as d'Erlon needed time to sort out his command after his repulse and with the Prussians starting to menace his right flank, Napoleon had no viable infantry reserves at hand to compete with Wellington. After all II Corps had been shattered by Uxbridge, I Corps was facing Hougoumont and VI Corps was sent to Plancenoit. Leaving only the Guard and the cavalry corps of Kellermann, Milhaud,... given the fact it was still only about 14h it was still too soon to sent in the Guard. Leaving Wellington alone was no option because it would have lead to defeat as Wellington would have been given a breathing space when time was of the essence for Napoleon and Wellington would have been able to act in cooperation with the Prussians. Thus the cavalry was called upon to busy Wellington, hoping to break the enemy centre as Murat had done at Eylau. Attacking squares with cavalry is perfectly feasible <i>as long as the cavalry is directly supported by horse artillery batteries</i>. The cavalry attack would keep the infantry immobile in their squares and would give the French artillery time to unlimber at 200 yards and pepper the squares with canister (as <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexandre-Antoine_Hureau_de_S%C3%A9narmont_dc75.html" title="Alexandre-Antoine Hureau de Sénarmont">Sénarmont</a> had done at the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Friedland_1dc2.html" title="Battle of Friedland">Battle of Friedland</a>). As a result, square after square would have faced the choice at either standing still and die or flee and be chopped to pieces by the roaming cavalry. Chances are very big that the center would have collapsed after witnessing several squares being blasted to pieces.</p>
<p>Ney was blamed later by Napoleonic apologists of having squandered the Emperor's master plan by charging, thus leading to defeat but the only blame one could place on Ney is that he neglected to use his cavalry in combination with the horse artillery (Ney being an infantry general and no cavalry general). The same could be said of Napoleon as he too neglected to send in the horse artillery when he reinforced the first cavalry attacks with the Guard cavalry.</p>

<dd>Thanks for the reference I'll add it so you can see how it is done for anything else you add like this.
<dl>
<dd>sorry I miss read the references what are the page numbers for the arguments above?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Whether from an infantry of cavalry background, a French Marshal would know better than to send unsupported cavalry against formed infantry in squares. The traditional view that from the valley floor the repositioning of some of Wellington's regiments was taken to be a general retreat is the best explanation of why the French cavalry was sent over the ridge.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Even if the French had known the Allies were not retreating and had sent horse artillery with the cavalry what would have happened the first time that the French cavalry had retreated (as they did a number of times)? The French guns unprotected by infantry would have been captured or spiked. So to succeed against a still formed army cavalry and horse artillery had to be supported by infantry.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Given that the French knew that Wellington was known to be a cautious field general and was unlikely to leave the high ground to attack the French until he was sure that victory was his, why would he French have thrown away their cavalry, like they did, to stop an advance that was very unlikely to be made?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As the French still had the middle guard in reserve, the only explanation as to why the French launched a cavalry attack and not a combined arms attack is that they thought a general Allied retreat was starting to happen which if pushed could become a route. IMO throwing in the cavalry and the infantry separately as happened does not make sense under any other analysis.</dd>
</dl>

<dd>Although it is said that Napoleon left the field, it may have been that he left Ney to conduct the left wing of the army, while he concentrated in stopping the Prussians, after all someone had to do it. So it may not be that he left the field but he may have delegated what had become a slugging match against Wellington to concentrate in setting up a another front line on the French left against the Prussians. After all, the reason for a left and right wing with sperate commanders as well as corps commanders was so that Napoleon could delegate on what were towards the end of the Napoleonic wars increasingly becomming multi-army battles. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Baird_Shearer_a81d.html" title="User:Philip Baird Shearer">Philip Baird Shearer</a> 21:24, 19 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The horse artillery would not necessarily have been left to their own during the retreats of the cavalry. As it would have been horse cavalry, they were able to limber and unlimber rapidly and would have been able to follow the cavalry wherever they went. Also, the cavalry and artillery would have been coordinated so the cavalry would have been screening the artillery and would not leave them completely unguarded. Also, the effect of several squares collapsing due to the artillery fire would have made a great impression on the allies. A square losing cohesion would be overrun by cavalry. What would you think would the effect of this be on the other squares? either face shrapnell or the sabre...</dd>
<dd>As to the Middle Guard, Napoleon was always very reluctant to use his Old and Middle Guard, they were reserved for the "final push". In fact, most of the fighting by the Guard in the different Napoleonic campaigns was done by the Young Guard. Given the run of the battle, he would only use them for the final push or to stop an imminent breakthrough (such as the two batallions of the Old Guard which were sent to support Lobau [VI Corps] and Duhesme [Young Guard] at Plancenoit) and not already between 14h and 15.30h.</dd>
<dd>Given the fact that II Corps was out of the action for a few hours until sorted out again, I Corps was engaged around Hougoumont, VI Corps and the Young Guard were facing the Prussians and the old and middle guard being the last reserve, Napoleon simply didn't have any infantry available to face the allies with. The only arm he had left in plenty quantity was his cavalry. -- <a href="../../../f/d/e/User%7EFdewaele_175e.html" title="User:Fdewaele">fdewaele</a> October 20, 2005, 13:00 CET</dd>

<p>(EDIT: CanHist): Oh dear, you can not rely on Hamilton-Williams' narrative at all for most of his "sources" can not be found nor traced and he was accused of deception and F R A U D, by most acclaimed historians. People, specifically in germany tried to follow his footnotes but were unable to do so. Some of the information with regard to his handling of sources is readily available on the net. Just enter Hamilton-Williams in to google-com and you will be surprised! Its a fabrication, nothing less! "Is there a recorded instance during the <a href="../../../n/a/p/Napoleonic_Wars_898f.html" title="Napoleonic Wars">Napoleonic Wars</a> of the French ever breaking a British square?" Are you kidding?

<dl>
<dd>As to the other question can you name a regiment and a battle where a British square was broken? I suspect it is like the myth that German paratroopers were never to be used as airborne troops after Crete because of the losses they suffered. For example they were planned to be used in the Battle of the Bulge but lack of fuel prevented it. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Baird_Shearer_a81d.html" title="User:Philip Baird Shearer">Philip Baird Shearer</a> 17:07, 20 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I did google for Hamilton-Williams but found several negative opions but even more positive. And that person (Hofschröer) seems to hold the Siborne's version to be canon! Whereas that work has been disproven by various Dutch and Belgian authors, time after time as Anglo centric and riddled with bias against the "Dutch-Belgians" and Prussians. I have the impression there is some character assassination going on against Hamilton-Williams... I have yet to find a reasonable published account which proves he deliberately falsified his account anywhere of the Waterloo campaign, or deliberately falsified his sources. I don't claim he holds the truth, nobody does but he wrote a very good work which has been praised by many. Some of his theories are perhaps theories and opinion but they were well thought but that counts for many scholars. To me it seems, the blackening of Hamilton-Williams is mainly done by the more Anglo centric scholars whereas the more "continental" minded seem to embrace it.</dd>
<dd>According to Luc De Vos - professor of military history at the Belgian military academy - in his work "Het einde van Napoleon: Waterloo 1815", one British square was cut to pieces by the French cavalry at Waterloo: the 69th Regiment... and three allied colors were lost to the French cavalry.
<dl>
<dd>Did a quick Google seems that it was at <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Quatre_Bras_bc5a.html" title="Battle of Quatre Bras">Battle of Quatre Bras</a> and was due to a mix up in orders. (I think it forms an important backdrop in Bernard Cornwell novel "Sharpe's Waterloo" ). First they were ordered to form a square and then reform into lines. It was at this point that they were caught by French cavalry. Of the two colours a regiment carried into battle the King's colour captured, but the 69th's Regimental colour was not. At least that is what happened according to this source<a href="http://waterloobattletours.users.btopenworld.com/page14.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://waterloobattletours.users.btopenworld.com/page14.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>.

(Edit: CanHist):I will get into Wikipedia etiquette at one point and then sign etc.... Ad Hamilton-Williams: Look at these accounts of people trying to follow his footnotes.... It is striking! It starts with looking at his maps, actually... I have read the book myself and the way he's smearing at Siboorne is un-paralleled. Siborne's meticulous work airs only a few incidents which do not get independent backing. Ad Hofschroer? What is fabulous about his work is, that he accurately gives you the german sources (which I happen to know as they've been in part part of my own research) as something moreless un-read in the english world. He is painstakingly honest and almost "glued" to sources! Ad Siborne: Please read Hofschroer "Wellington's smallest victory". In the english I myself happen to trust Chesney and Siborne the most as their work gets independent support (from Dutch/German sources)...!! Ad Square: I recall several more incidents (Peninsular, Quatre Bras), but I'd have to look them up. Ad German paras: They saw action throughout WW2 (specifically in Italy and the eastern front) but were never used again in an all-out airborne mission without support other than from the air....</p>
<dl>
<dd>It is not that they did not see action. But the often stated (as it is in the wikipedia article): "meant that the fallschirmjäger were never again used as airborne troops", however there were plans to use German paras in the Battle of the Bulge in a similar way to the use of Allied paras over the previous summer. Lack of fuel and bad weather being the reasons for the delay and the scale of Operation Stösser. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Baird_Shearer_a81d.html" title="User:Philip Baird Shearer">Philip Baird Shearer</a> 00:51, 21 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

(Edit: CanHist): I quote from a website: In Waterloo - New Perspectives, David Hamilton-Williams writes about Napoléon's Lancers: "Able to impale a standing or mounted enemy by the force of his forward impetus, he could also make stabbing thrusts at men crouching or lying flat on the ground, something virtually impossible for sword- or sabre-armed cavalry... Un-quote. This is only an example of H-W cluelessness as of course a ordinary rider could reach out at anything within range with his sabre and certainly could touch the ground with it. Cavalry sabres were also specifically designed for that i.e. a tad longer than those carried by officers serving in the infantry! H-W admittedly writes very good prose, but his facts are nothing but an abstruse albeit-interesting-to-read collection of thoughts that are not founded on factual knowledge. It is fiction par excellence mixed with some historical knowledge. An interesting mix, but not more. With regards to Siborne, please do consult Gareth Glover, Letters from the Battle of Waterloo. He, after crawling through the Siborne letters again, confirms the validity of Siborne's work .... There is little room to maneuver for revisionist "historians" like Hamilton-Williams as objectivity and truth, although apparently hard to grasp, must remain something to aim for....</p>
<dl>
<dd>That might be an anglocentric view but it is definately not shared by the Belgian and Dutch historians. I do not discount Siborne's original map contribution and Wellington's vendetta but the problem with the Siborne papers as with many of the British historians until in the 20th century is his attitude with regards to the Dutch-Belgians. (In fact, Glover largely is conspicuously silent with regard to the Dutch-Belgians). Ever since the 1840s, the <b>main beef against</b> Siborne by Dutch contemporaries and later historians is the view of Siborne as onesided, biased and inacurate with regards to the Dutch-Belgian troops. The best example of this bias are for instance the often quoted letters by Mercer about the Dutch Belgians...</dd>
<dd>For instance the work of W.J. Knoop in 1847, de Bas and T'Serclaes de Wommersom in the early 20th century and more recently Vels Heijn and De Vos all see Siborne as an anglo centric writing which partly distorts the truth to the greater glory of the British. Of course this is something many British historians of the time did but Siborne is definately no better than any of them, in fact he and his son are often attributed as the main creators of the popular myth of the Dutch Belgian cowardness which is found in so many British works about the battle. --<a href="../../../f/d/e/User%7EFdewaele_175e.html" title="User:Fdewaele">fdewaele</a> October 26, 2005, 22:40 CET</dd>

<p>(CanHist)You must finally venture to correct this paragraph. Old Boney never left the battlefield (even Thiers does not mention this) and this whole affair is but an invention by Victor Hugo! It is also rather strange to see Hamilton-Williams still quoted on this rather curious Waterloo page. Look after Chesney or Thiers even to get a hunch. This is about history and facts and not about wishful thinking a la Hugo! - who apparently got this fairy tale from a book published in the 1860ies by a fellow called Dumaine.

<p>It was indeed me ;-), believe it or not, I managed to get through this log-on thingie and apparently learnt how to sign... Ad: H-W, I must say, that I do not wish to get deeper into this than necessary for my own work, for he who deals with rubbish loses too much time to deal with real important things ;-) It is totally sufficient to say that his writing, despite of being nicely styled and good prose, is obsolete and fraudulent. Honestly, I would not allow a student of mine to quote from his "content". We could exchange some of that over email as well, at one point, if needed CanHist 03:17, 7 December 2005 (UTC) Btw, my IP frequently switches (so should yours!)...</p>
<p>For that matter, if we're talking bias: two of the references (Waterloo - The German Victory, Myths and lies about the Dutch-Belgian performance at Waterloo) are from the same site. Whilst there are some decent articles on their pages, generally they tend to involve anti-British racism. There's a mild dose in the latter of those two; others on the site are far worse. It is important to note the contribution of the non-British in the battle, but it is also important to supply good and fair further reading: can better references be found to direct people to than those, particularly the second? <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgema_7a73.html" title="User:Agema">Agema</a> 22:58, 23 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Nonetheless, the term Dutch-Belgians is often used to denote the troops from the then United Kingdom of the Netherlands, mainly I believe because the distinction was made by the Netherlands themselve as some units were designated as <i>Belgian</i>. <a href="../../../f/d/e/User%7EFdewaele_175e.html" title="User:Fdewaele">fdewaele</a> - 24 April 2006, 22:48</dd>
