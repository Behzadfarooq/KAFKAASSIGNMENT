<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_the_Burning_Plains_a6bf.html" title="Edit section: Prelude">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Prelude</span></h2>
<p>There had been constant tensions between the <a href="../../../v/a/r/Varden.html" title="Varden">Varden</a> and <a href="../../../g/a/l/Galbatorix.html" title="Galbatorix">Galbatorix</a>, king over <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alaga%C3%ABsia.html" title="Alagaësia">Alagaësia</a>. <a href="../../../s/u/r/Surda.html" title="Surda">Surda</a>, which was regarded as inconsequential by Galbatorix, had been secretly supporting the Varden.</p>
<p>After the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_under_Farthen_Dur_964d.html" title="Battle under Farthen Dur">Battle under Farthen Dur</a>, <a href="../../../n/a/s/Nasuada.html" title="Nasuada">Nasuada</a>, who soon after the battle became leader of the Varden, decided to take advantage of the imbalance caused to the empire by the death of <a href="../../../d/u/r/Durza.html" title="Durza">Durza</a> and the subsequent loss of the alliance of the Urgals by moving the headquarters of the Varden from Farthen Dur to Surda and openly seeking confrontation. While the losses of the Varden were significant in the earlier battle they received a veritable flood of volunteers after word of the battle and Eragon's appearance spread. In Surda, Nasuada could also rely on the forces of the kingdom in case of open confrontation.</p>
<p>While <a href="../../../e/r/a/Eragon_%28character%29.html" title="Eragon (character)">Eragon</a> was undergoing his training to become a <a href="../../../d/r/a/Dragon_Rider_3e5f.html" title="Dragon Rider">Dragon Rider</a> under the elf <a href="../../../d/r/a/Dragon_Rider_3e5f.html" title="Dragon Rider">Dragon Rider</a> <a href="../../../o/r/o/Oromis.html" title="Oromis">Oromis</a> in <a href="../../../e/l/l/Ellesm%C3%A9ra.html" title="Ellesméra">Ellesméra</a>, he scryed (magically spied) upon his friends <a href="../../../n/a/s/Nasuada.html" title="Nasuada">Nasuada</a> and <a href="../../../a/r/y/Arya.html" title="Arya">Arya</a>, whom he heard were planning for battle. At that point Eragon and <a href="../../../s/a/p/Saphira.html" title="Saphira">Saphira</a>, his <a href="../../../d/r/a/Dragon_%28Inheritance%29_ea83.html" title="Dragon (Inheritance)">dragon</a> decided to partake in the battle themselves, and to finally unleash the fruits of their long and arduous training.</p>
<p>He went and told of his resolve to his trainer Oromis, and they heard the news that the elves had also decided to join in this campaign, which they felt could take decades to resolve. However, the elves would not be present at the Battle of the Burning Plains, since it would take far too much time to mobilize their army and resources. Queen Islanzadi promised Eragon that they were to invade from the north and divide Galbatorix's force. Eragon and Saphira along with <a href="../../../o/r/i/Orik.html" title="Orik">Orik</a>, the dwarf who was accompanying them, reached the battlefield on dragonback, where they found the situation for the <a href="../../../v/a/r/Varden.html" title="Varden">Varden</a> and <a href="../../../s/u/r/Surda.html" title="Surda">Surda</a> grim.</p>
<p>At the battlefield, two armies were arrayed opposite each other, the Varden and armies of Surda to the south and <a href="../../../g/a/l/Galbatorix.html" title="Galbatorix">Galbatorix</a>'s army towards the north, with two miles of empty space between them. The Varden's and Surda's armies were said to have <i>"paled in comparison to the size of the force assembled in the north. Galbatorix's army was so large, it measured three miles across on its leading edge, and how many in length it was impossible to say, for the individual man melted into a shadowy mass in the distance"</i><sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>The numbers of the Varden are not told but one can assume that they had recovered from losses which had occurred in the previous battle. Orik stated to Eragon that the Varden numbered 4,000 people living in Farthen Dur. When king Orrin appoints Nasuada as overall military commander this is done over the objection of his prime minister, implying that Surda is carrying a major burden of the war effort. Since the Varden have managed through lace-making to become financially independent, this perhaps means that Surda has supplied a large number of soldiers compared to the Varden.</p>
<p>Eragon took control of the <i>Du Vrangr Gata</i>, the magical society loyal to the Varden, and met with <a href="../../../n/a/s/Nasuada.html" title="Nasuada">Nasuada</a> and <a href="../../../o/r/r/Orrin.html" title="Orrin">Orrin</a>, the leaders of the Varden and Surda respectively.</p>
<p>Then, a faction of <a href="../../../u/r/g/Urgal.html" title="Urgal">Kull</a>, huge elite Urgals, under their leader Garzhvog, had a meeting with Nasuada, and decided to join the rebel armies, because Galbatorix had abused their kind for too long. Being "<a href="../../../n/o/b/Noble_savage.html" title="Noble savage">noble savages</a>" with a strong tribal nationalism, they swore to complete loyalty in exchange for Galbatorix's death. On the eve of battle, four Kull, including Garzhvog himself, joined Eragon to guard him on Nasuada's orders. Eragon reluctantly accepted, though he also accepted the help of 7 dwarves, including his friend Orik. They encountered <a href="../../../a/n/g/Angela_%28Inheritance%29_bb3a.html" title="Angela (Inheritance)">Angela</a>, a witch friendly to their armies, coming into their camp from the opposing camp. Suspecting her of treason, they confronted her, only to find out that she had poisoned the food of the officer leading the armies of Galbatorix, and thus, managed to kill many of them. We are never told of the name of the person who Galbatorix sent to lead his army.</p>
<p><a name="Battle" id="Battle"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_the_Burning_Plains_a6bf.html" title="Edit section: Battle">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Battle</span></h2>
<p>When daybreak arrived, Eragon roused himself and his guard, and they joined the army marching out of their camp, armor padded to prevent any noise. Because of the nearly opaque vapors rising out of the ground which give the Burning Plains their name, the army remained undiscovered until they crossed three-fourths of the <a href="../../../n/o/-/No-man%27s_land.html" title="No-man's land">no-man's land</a>. The cavalry of King Orrin, and the Kull, who could run as fast as horses made a detour and attacked the imperial army from the flank, probably intending to anchor it in place, while the infantry ran the last quarter of the distance and the two forces met. What latter happened to Orrin's cavalry we are not told, it is implied that they kept on attacking the imperial army from the flank. Orrin is later only mentioned as the first to notice the dwarves.</p>
<p>Eragon had placed magical protective wards around himself, and those whom he held dear. His original plan during the battle was to discover the enemy spellcasters, and kill them, and then in turn, those soldiers who were under their protection. However, the cunning of the spellcasters made it difficult for him to find them, though he was ultimately able to find some, with the help of <i>Du Vrangr Gata</i>. He was able to wrench the order from their minds that they were not supposed to harm either Saphira or himself. Recovering from the initial assault, Galbatorix's armies mobilized their machines of war: <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catapult.html" title="Catapult">catapults</a>, <a href="../../../t/r/e/Trebuchet.html" title="Trebuchet">trebuchets</a> and <a href="../../../b/a/l/Ballista.html" title="Ballista">ballistae</a>, which caused severe damage to the Varden and led them to retreat towards their starting position. However, Eragon devised a cunning plan: he took control of the mind of a soldier near a machine and used him to render it unusable. He similarly disposed off the other machines.</p>
<p>In the midst of this Nasuada, badly injured came to Eragon, and told him <i>"We need...a Rider"</i>.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup> Eragon, inspired by her courage, made three sorties into the opposing forces, on foot with the help of Saphira and his guards. Though, however much they would try, the numbers of the opposing armies were too great to be quelled. As the battle dragged on three of the dwarves and two of the Kull in his guard were killed.</p>
<p><a name="Expansion" id="Expansion"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_the_Burning_Plains_a6bf.html" title="Edit section: Expansion">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Expansion</span></h3>
<p>At this point, the dwarves made their entry into the battle under their king, <a href="../../../h/r/o/Hrothgar.html" title="Hrothgar">Hrothgar</a> from the east. They joined Orrin's forces and attacked from the flank. These reinforcements invigorated them, though soon they spotted a ship, coming up the Jiet River. Thinking that the ship was bringing reinforcements for the armies of Galbatorix, Eragon set out to destroy it, only to encounter his cousin <a href="../../../r/o/r/Roran.html" title="Roran">Roran</a>, and the entire population of his home village <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carvahall.html" title="Carvahall">Carvahall</a>. Eragon was pleasantly surprised to see his elder cousin, though Roran did not reciprocate his feelings, because the entire village had been driven as refugees from Carvahall due to the fact that it was Eragon's home.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup> Roran, as their captain, ordered the people to ground the ship and use the ballistae on their ship to wreak havoc on Galbatorix's army.</p>
<p>With the entry of Hrothgar and the dwarves into the battle, the opposing soldiers, most of whom were conscripted and torn out of their families, lost heart. The imperial army started retreated towards their starting position.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup> Many of them surrendered, turned on their comrades, or simply fled. The officers also gave irrational orders (due to <a href="../../../d/r/u/Drugs.html" title="Drugs">drugs</a> slipped to them by Angela the herbalist), which helped the Varden break through the Empire's lines.</p>
<p><a name="Final_battle" id="Final_battle"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_the_Burning_Plains_a6bf.html" title="Edit section: Final battle">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Final battle</span></h3>
<p>During the battle, Eragon sighted a flying figure, which he had earlier mistaken to be a <a href="../../../r/a/27/Ra%27zac.html#Lifecycle" title="Ra'zac">Lethrblaka</a>. Actually it turned out to be a red dragon, which had hatched from one of the two eggs that Galbatorix had in his possession. The <a href="../../../d/r/a/Dragon_Rider_3e5f.html" title="Dragon Rider">Dragon Rider</a> killed King Hrothgar with a <i>"shaft of crackling ruby energy"</i>.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[6]</a></sup> Eragon, filled with desire for revenge, flew off on Saphira to confront the unknown Rider, only to find himself facing a mighty opponent, one beyond his powers to defeat. The two dragons battled, but ultimately Eragon made a bold move by jumping off his saddle to cut the hamstring of the other dragon. As he fell through the air, Saphira caught him and Eragon told her to land so that the two Riders could fight face to face on the ground. However, the other rider was able to heal his dragon by magic which took just 3 seconds ( he was still strong enough to lift Saphira later).</p>
<p>Eragon and the other Rider dueled, but the latter was able to fend off all of Eragon's attacks, no matter how clever or complex, because Eragon was already tired from the battle. Had the rider come earlier Eragon, who by now had the physical ability of an elf, could have defeated him. Exhasuted by the ordeal, Eragon slipped and fell, and in a flash of realization, he remembered that he knows the person, through all of his fighting moves. He reached up and ripped his helm off, to reveal that his friend <a href="../../../m/u/r/Murtagh.html" title="Murtagh">Murtagh</a> was standing there.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the book, Murtagh, a friend Eragon had met in his travels and also the son of <a href="../../../m/o/r/Morzan.html" title="Morzan">Morzan</a>, a close compatriot of Galbatorix, was captured by a raiding party of <a href="../../../u/r/g/Urgal.html" title="Urgal">Urgals</a>, along with <a href="../../../a/j/i/Ajihad.html" title="Ajihad">Ajihad</a>, former leader of the Varden and father of Nasuada, and <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Twins_e24f.html" title="The Twins">The Twins</a>, the strongest spellweavers of the Varden.</p>
<p>Murtagh now revealed how The Twins were the spies of Galbatorix, and they had planned the ambush to kill Ajihad, and to capture Murtagh and bring him before Galbatorix. There Thorn, the red <a href="../../../d/r/a/Dragon_%28Inheritance%29_ea83.html" title="Dragon (Inheritance)">dragon</a> hatched for Murtagh, and Galbatorix made Murtagh and Thorn swear loyalty to Galbatorix in the <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_language.html" title="Ancient language">ancient language</a>, and thus made it a vow which they could not break. Murtagh also revealed that Galbatorix, during their training, had told them of ancient secrets, <i>"...spells so powerful that the elves dare not utter them[...] Words in the ancient language that were lost till Galbatorix discovered them. Ways to manipulate energy...Secrets, terrible secrets, that can destroy your enemies and fulfill all your desires."</i><sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>Eragon, then realized that The Twins were also on the battlefield, and the powerful spellweavers that they were, were wreaking havoc on the Varden's spellcasters. Then the two Riders espied Roran climbing up the hill where The Twins were, and killing them both with his <a href="../../../r/o/r/Roran.html#.22Stronghammer.22" title="Roran">hammer</a>. Murtagh did not warn The Twins because they had enjoyed torturing him when he was their prisoner.</p>
<p>Murtagh then explained why Galbatorix wanted Eragon and Saphira both alive, because Saphira is female, and Galbatorix wanted to use her to spawn a new race of Dragon Riders loyal to him. Eragon tried to convince Murtagh to turn to his side, but in vain. Then, left with no other option, he attacked Murtagh, but meets his match, and is left half dead. Murtagh then prepared to take Eragon back to <a href="../../../u/r/%C3%BB/Ur%C3%BB%27baen.html" title="Urû'baen">Urû'baen</a>, the capital of Galbatorix's empire, but Eragon convinced him to leave him and Saphira behind. Murtagh, showing his humane side, agreed, at the expense of his own suffering at the hands of Galbatorix, saying that Galbatorix's order had been to <i>"...try and capture [Eragon] and Saphira"</i> and that he had tried.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p><a name="Revelation" id="Revelation"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_the_Burning_Plains_a6bf.html" title="Edit section: Revelation">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Revelation</span></h3>
<p>Just as he was about to leave, Murtagh revealed a final deadly truth to Eragon, that the latter is also a son of <a href="../../../m/o/r/Morzan.html" title="Morzan">Morzan</a>, the closest ally of Galbatorix. Eragon was shocked, but on further thought came to believe it. Murtagh, in his final revelation said <i>"...Zar'roc should have gone to Morzan's <b>eldest</b> son, not his <b>youngest</b>. It is mine by right of birth"</i><sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[9]</a></sup> As an inheritance of being their father's eldest son, Murtagh took Eragon's blood-red sword, <i>Zar'roc</i>, which was originally Morzan's and declares it a fit match to his dragon Thorn, whose color was also red.</p>
<p>After the Twins had died, the Varden, Surdians, Kull and Dwarves were able to regroup and launch a final assault. The imperial army, attacked from three sides, disintegrated though most soldiers fled across the Jiet river, out of reach of the army opposing them that had no forces available to chase them. The leader of the Empire then decided to retreat back to camp so that the Empire could regroup and launch another assault later.</p>
