But to the south, Cassius was defeated by Antony, and committed suicide after hearing a false report that Brutus had also failed. Brutus rallied Cassius's remaining troops and both sides ordered their army to retreat to their camps with their spoils, and the battle was essentially a draw, but for Cassius' suicide.</p>
<p>A second encounter, on <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_23.html" title="October 23">23 October</a>, finished off Brutus's forces, and he committed suicide in turn, leaving the triumvirate in control of the <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Republic_9497.html" title="Roman Republic">Roman Republic</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Philippi_fb19.html" title="Edit section: Prelude">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Prelude</span></h2>
<p>After the murder of Caesar, Brutus and Cassius (the two main conspirators, also known as the <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberatores.html" title="Liberatores">Liberatores</a>) had left <a href="../../../i/t/a/Italy.html" title="Italy">Italy</a> and taken control of all Eastern provinces (from Greece and Macedonia to <a href="../../../s/y/r/Syria_%28Roman_province%29_aa09.html" title="Syria (Roman province)">Syria</a>) and of the allied Eastern kingdoms. In Rome the three main Caesarian leaders (Antony, Octavian and <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marcus_Aemilius_Lepidus_%28triumvir%29_91a8.html" title="Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (triumvir)">Lepidus</a>), who controlled almost all the Roman army in the west, had crushed the opposition of the senate and established the second triumvirate. One of their first tasks was to destroy the Liberators’ forces, not only to get full control of the Roman world, but also to avenge Caesar’s death.</p>
<p>The triumvirs decided to leave Lepidus in Italy, while the two main partners of the triumvirate (Antony and Octavian) moved to Northern Greece with their best troops (a total of 28 legions). They were able to ferry their army across the Adriatic and sent out a scouting force of eight legions (commanded by Norbanus and Saxa) along the via Egnatia, with the aim of searching for the Liberators' army. Norbanus and Saxa passed the town of <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philippi.html" title="Philippi">Philippi</a> in eastern Macedonia and took a strong defensive position at a narrow mountain pass. Antony was following, while Octavian was delayed at Dyrrachium because of his ill-health (which would accompany him throughout the Philippi campaign). Although the triumvirs had been able to cross the sea with their main force, further communications with Italy were made difficult by the arrival of the republican admiral <a href="../../../g/n/a/Gnaeus_Domitius_Ahenobarbus_%28consul_32_BC%29_6f90.html" title="Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus (consul 32 BC)">Ahenobarbus</a>, with a large fleet of 130 ships.</p>
<p>The Liberators did not wish to engage a decisive battle, but rather to attain a good defensive position and then use their naval superiority to block the triumvirs’ communications with their supply base in Italy. They had spent the previous months plundering Greek cities to swell their war-chest and had gathered in <a href="../../../t/h/r/Thrace.html" title="Thrace">Thrace</a> the Roman legions from the Eastern provinces and levies from allies. With their superior forces they were able to outflank Norbanus and Saxa, who had to abandon their defensive position and retreat west of Philippi. Thus, Brutus and Cassius could seize a strong defensive position holding the high ground along both sides of the via Egnatia, about 3.5 km west of the city of Philippi. On the south their position was anchored to a supposedly impassable marsh, while on the north to impervious hills. They had plenty of time to fortify their position with a rampart and a ditch. Brutus put his camp on the north while Cassius on the south of the via Egnatia. Antony arrived shortly and positioned his army on the south of the via Egnatia, while Octavian put his legions north of the road.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Philippi_fb19.html" title="Edit section: Opposing Forces">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Opposing Forces</span></h2>
<p>The Triumvirs' army included nineteen legions (other legions had been left behind). The sources report specifically the name of only one legion (IIII legion), but other legions present included the VI, VII, VIII, X Equestris, XII, III, XXVI, XXVIII, XXIX, and XXX, since their veterans participated in the land settlements after the battle. Appian reports that the triumvirs’ legions were almost at full-ranks. Furthermore, they had a large allied cavalry force (13,000 horsemen with Octavian and 20,000 with Antony).</p>
<p>The Liberators' army had seventeen legions (eight with Brutus and nine with Cassius, while other two legions were with the fleet). Only two of the legions were at full ranks, but the army was reinforced by levies from the Eastern allied kingdoms. <a href="../../../a/p/p/Appian.html" title="Appian">Appian</a> reports that the army mustered a total of about 80,000 foot-soldiers. Allied cavalry included a total of 17,000 horsemen, including 5000 bowmen mounted in the Eastern fashion. This army included the old Caesarian’s legions present in the East (probably with XXVII, XXXVI, XXXVII, XXXI and XXXIII legions), thus most of his legionnaires were former Caesarean veterans. However, at least the XXXVI legion consisted of old Pompeian veterans, enrolled in Caesar's army after the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Pharsalus_50f9.html" title="Battle of Pharsalus">battle of Pharsalus</a>. The loyalty of the soldiers who were supposed to fight against Caesar’s heir was a delicate issue for the Liberators. It is important to emphasize that the name "Octavian" was never used by contemporaries: he was simply known as <i>Caius Iulius Caesar</i>. Cassius tried in all ways to reinforce the soldiers’ loyalty both with strong speeches ("Let it give no one any concern that he has been one of Caesar's soldiers. We were not his soldiers then, but our country's") and with a gift of 1,500 denari for each legionnaire and 7,500 for each centurion.</p>
<p>Although ancient sources do not report the total numbers of men of the two armies, it seems that they had a similar strength (modern historians put the total at about 100,000 men on each side)</p>

<p>Antony offered battle several times, but the Liberators were not lured to leave their defensive stand. Thus, Antony tried to secretly outflank the Liberator's position through the marshes in the south. With a lot of effort he was able to cut a passage through the marshes, throwing up a causeway upon them. This manoeuvre was finally noticed by Cassius who tried a countermove by moving part of his army south into the marshes and making a transverse dam, trying to cut-off the outstretched <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antony.html" title="Antony">Antony</a>’s right wing. This brought a general battle on October 3, 42 BC.</p>

First Battle of Philippi</div>

<p>Antony ordered a charge against Cassius, aiming at the fortifications between Cassius camp and the marshes. At the same time, Brutus soldiers, provoked by the triumvir’s army, rushed against <a href="../../../a/u/g/Augustus.html" title="Augustus">Octavian</a>’s army, without waiting for the order of attack (given with the watchword "Liberty"). This surprise assault had complete success: Octavian’s troops were put to flight and pursued up to their camp, which was captured by Brutus’ men, led by <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marcus_Valerius_Messalla_Corvinus_f5dc.html" title="Marcus Valerius Messalla Corvinus">Marcus Valerius Messalla Corvinus</a>. Three of Octavian’s legionary standards were also taken, a clear sign of disbandment. Octavian was not found in his tent: his couch was pierced and cut to pieces. Most ancient historians say that he had been warned in a dream to beware of that day, as he had himself written in his Memoirs. <a href="../../../p/l/i/Pliny_the_Elder_bac4.html" title="Pliny the Elder">Pliny</a> bluntly reports that Octavian went hiding into a marsh.</p>
<p>However, on the other side of the via Egnatia, Antony was able to storm Cassius’ fortifications, demolishing the palisade and filling up the ditch. Then he easily took Cassius’ camp, which was defended by only a few men. It seems that part of Cassius’ army had advanced south: when these men tried to come back they were easily repulsed by Antony. Apparently the battle had ended in a draw. Cassius had lost 9,000 men, while Octavian had about 18,000 casualties. However, the battlefield was very large and clouds of dust made it impossible to make a clear assessment of the outcome of the battle, so both parts were ignorant of each other's fate. Cassius moved to the top of a hill, but could not see well what was happening on Brutus’ side. Believing that he had suffered a crushing defeat he ordered his freedman Pindarus to kill him. Brutus mourned over Cassius’ body, calling him "the last of the Romans". However, he avoided a public funeral, fearing its negative effects on the army morale.</p>
<p>Alternative sources credit the avarice of Brutus' troops as the factor that undid their definitive victory on October 3. Premature looting and gathering of booty by Brutus' advancing forces allowed Octavian's troops to re-form their line. In Octavian's future reign as Emperor, a common battle cry became, "Complete the battle once begun!"</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Philippi_fb19.html" title="Edit section: The Second Battle">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Second Battle</span></h2>
<p>On the same day of the first battle of Philippi the Republican fleet, patrolling the Ionian Sea was able to intercept and destroy the triumvirs reinforcements (two legions and other troops and supplies led by <a href="../../../d/o/m/Domitius_Calvinus_0601.html" title="Domitius Calvinus">Domitius Calvinus</a>). Thus, the strategic position of Antony and Octavian became quite serious, since the already depleted regions of Macedonia and <a href="../../../t/h/e/Thessaly.html" title="Thessaly">Thessaly</a> were unable to supply their army for long, while Brutus could easily receive supplies from the sea. The triumvirs had to send a legion south to <a href="../../../a/c/h/Achaia.html" title="Achaia">Achaia</a> to collect more supplies. The morale of the troops was boosted by the promise of further 5,000 denarii for each soldier and 25,000 for each centurion.</p>
<p>On the other side, however, the Liberators’ army was left without his best strategic mind. Brutus had less military experience than Cassius and, even worse, he could not obtain the same sort of respect from his allies and his soldiers, although after the battle he offered another gift of 1,000 denarii for each soldier.</p>
<p>In the next three weeks, Antony was able to slowly advance his forces south of Brutus’s army, fortifying a hill close to the former Cassius’ camp, which had been left unguarded by Brutus.</p>

Second Battle of Philippi</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>To avoid being outflanked Brutus was compelled to extend his line to the south, parallel to the via Egnatia, building several fortified posts. Brutus' defensive position was still secure, holding the high ground with a safe line of communication with the sea and he still wanted to keep the original plan of avoiding an open engagement while waiting for his naval superiority to wear out the enemy. Unfortunately, most of his officers and soldiers were tired of the delaying tactics and demanded another attempt at an open battle. Probably both Brutus and his officers feared the risk of having their soldiers deserting to the enemy if they did not keep their ascendancy on the troops. Plutarch also reports that Brutus had not received news of Domitius Calvinus' defeat in the Ionian Sea. Thus, when some of the eastern allies and mercenaries started deserting, Brutus was forced to attack on the afternoon of October 23. As he said "I seem to carry on war like Pompey the Great, not so much commanding now as commanded."</p>
<p>The battle resulted in close combat between two armies of well-trained veterans. Arrows or javelins were largely ignored and the soldiers packed into solid ranks fought face-to-face with their swords, and the slaughter was terrible. In the end, Brutus’ attack was repulsed, and his soldiers routed in confusion, their ranks broken. Octavian's soldiers were able to capture the gates of Brutus’ camp before the routing army could reach this defensive position. Thus, Brutus’ army could not reform making the triumvirs’ victory complete. Brutus was able to retreat into the nearby hills with the equivalent of only 4 legions. Seeing that surrender and capture were inevitable Brutus committed suicide.</p>
<p>The total casualties for the second battle of Philippi were not reported, but the close quarters fighting likely resulted in heavy losses for both sides.</p>

<p><a href="../../../p/l/u/Plutarch.html" title="Plutarch">Plutarch</a> reports that Antony covered Brutus' body with a purple garment as a sign of respect: they had been friends. He remembered that Brutus had placed as a condition for his joining the plot to assassinate Caesar that the life of Antony should be spared.</p>
<p>Many other young Roman aristocrats lost their life in the battle or committed suicide after the defeat, including the son of great orator <a href="../../../h/o/r/Hortensius.html" title="Hortensius">Hortensius</a>, and <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marcus_Porcius_Cato_%28II%29_bfd7.html" title="Marcus Porcius Cato (II)">Marcus Porcius Cato (II)</a> (the son of <a href="../../../c/a/t/Cato_the_younger.html" title="Cato the younger">Cato the younger</a>), and <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marcus_Livius_Drusus_Claudianus_dfa1.html" title="Marcus Livius Drusus Claudianus">Marcus Livius Drusus Claudianus</a> (the father of <a href="../../../l/i/v/Livia.html" title="Livia">Livia</a>, who became Octavian’s wife). Some of the nobles who were able to escape negotiated their surrender to Antony and entered his service (among them <a href="../../../l/u/c/Lucius_Calpurnius_Bibulus_4615.html" title="Lucius Calpurnius Bibulus">Lucius Calpurnius Bibulus</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marcus_Valerius_Messalla_Corvinus_f5dc.html" title="Marcus Valerius Messalla Corvinus">Marcus Valerius Messalla Corvinus</a>). Apparently, the nobles did not want to deal with the young and merciless Octavian.</p>
<p>The remains of the Liberators’ army were rounded up and roughly 14,000 men were enrolled into the triumvirs army. Old veterans were discharged back to Italy, but some of the veterans remained in the town of Philippi, which became a Roman colony (<i>Colonia Victrix Philippensium</i>).</p>
<p>Antony remained in the East, while Octavian returned to Italy, with the difficult task of finding the land to settle a large number of veterans. Despite the fact the <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sextus_Pompeius_2788.html" title="Sextus Pompeius">Sextus Pompeius</a> was controlling Sicily and Domitius Ahenobarbus still commanded the republican fleet, the republican resistance had been definitely crushed at Philippi.</p>
<p>The Battle of Philippi probably also marked the highest point of Antony's career: at that time he was the most famous Roman general and the senior partner of the Second Triumvirate. Antony's life was defined in this moment.</p>

<p><a href="../../../p/l/u/Plutarch.html" title="Plutarch">Plutarch</a> reports the famous Brutus’ vision of a ghost a few months before the battle. One night he saw a huge and shadowy form appearing in front of him; when he calmly asked, "What and whence art thou?" it answered "I am thy evil genie, Brutus: we shall meet again at Philippi." He met again the ghost the night before the battle. This episode is one of the most famous in <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shakespeare.html" title="Shakespeare">Shakespeare</a>’s play <a href="../../../j/u/l/Julius_Caesar_%28play%29_e75d.html" title="Julius Caesar (play)">Julius Caesar</a>.</p>
<p>Plutarch also reports the last word of Brutus, quoted by a Greek tragedy "O wretched Virtue, thou wert but a name, and yet I worshipped thee as real indeed; but now, it seems, thou were but fortune's slave."</p>
<p>Augustus’ own version of the Battle of Philippi: "I sent into exile the murders of my father, punishing their crimes with regular tribunals, afterwards, when they made war to the Republic I twice defeated them in battle". <i>Qui parentem meum [interfecer]un[t eo]s in exilium expuli iudiciis legitimis ultus eorum [fa]cin[us, e]t postea bellum inferentis rei publicae vici b[is a]cie</i>. Res Gestae 2.</p>
