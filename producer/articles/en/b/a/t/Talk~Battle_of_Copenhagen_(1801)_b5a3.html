<p>Why does this article suggest that the Danish-Norwegian army lost ships? When Nelsons terms of peace reached the Danish King not a single Danish-Norwegian ship had been sunk and not a single Danish-Norwegian ship had been captured.</p>
<p>Not to mention that three of Nelsons line ships had just gotten into the firing range of the fortress of Trekroner. Had the Danish king only consulted with his admirals before agreing to the peace treaty Nelsons ships would have been devestrated seriously damaging the naval poweress of the English.</p>

<p><i>"Judging from what he could see, and the fact that the wind and current prevented his bringing his own division into the action, Parker told his flag captain: "I will make the signal of recall for Nelson's sake. If he is in condition to continue the action, he will disregard it; if he is not, it will be an excuse for his retreat . . . . "</i></p>
<p><i>It is claimed that Parker was aware of the consequences to his own personal reputation; but it would be cowardly in him to leave Nel;son to bear the whole shame of the failure, if shame it should be deemed."</i> <a href="../../../d/a/b/User%7EDabbler_9770.html" title="User:Dabbler">Dabbler</a> 20:26, 14 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

Nelson turned to Captain Foley and said ‘You know…I have only one eye. I have a right to be blind sometimes’ and raising a spyglass to his right eye added ‘I really do not see the signal’ (Hibbert, page 261).

<p>This is written rather overmuch with the British in mind. It says that 350 men died and 850 were wounded on the British ships but I'm pretty sure there were Danish casualties as well considering they lost the war... Does anyone know how many died? I'd be grateful&#160;:)</p>

<dd>More precisely, 1135 killed and wounded. The British figures are also debatable. The figures given for British casualties in this article was according to Admiral Nelson himself — a notorious lier. Admiral Parker, who was a larger admirer of the truth, gave the figure 2237 dead and wounded on the British side. Boreanesia 15:57, 19 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>As all the British ships maintained crew logs 2,000+ killed would show up clearly, but they don't reflect this figure.<a href="../../../a/l/c/User%7EAlci12_990b.html" title="User:Alci12">Alci12</a> 11:50, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Dudley Pope, in "The Great Gamble" has British casualties at 256 killed, 688 wounded, with a detailed breaksdown between officers, seamen and marines, soldiers. His figures for the Danes are: 370 killed, 106 died of wounds, 559 wounded (total 1,035), with abreakdown between officers, 'officials', seamen, warrant &amp; petty officers, army NCOs &amp; soldiers, volunteers &amp; pressed men.Cliff 14:18, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I had edited it to read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After the cease-fire, formal negotiations for peace ensued. These talks lasted for more than a week focusing on the British demand that Denmark-Norway leave the League of Armed Neutrality. The negotiations were difficult and at times almost called for the resumption of hostilities. When it was learned that the Russian Emperor Paul, who was the driving force behind the League of Armed Neutrality, had just died, the British demands suddenly became irrelevant. A 14-week armistice was signed on <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_9.html" title="April 9">April 9</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/0/1801.html" title="1801">1801</a>, as a beginning of peace between the two parties. The final peace agreement was then signed on <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_23.html" title="October 23">October 23</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/0/1801.html" title="1801">1801</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This was not to be the end of Danish-Norwegian difficulties with the British. In <a href="../../../1/8/0/1807.html" title="1807">1807</a> similar circumstances led to another British attack, in the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Copenhagen_%281807%29_7be6.html" title="Battle of Copenhagen (1807)">Second Battle of Copenhagen</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Back in England, nobody was decorated for the battle. Nelson's conduct during the battle, wherein he disobeyed Parker's orders and thereafter sent a deceptive note to the Danish-Norwegian Crown Prince, was seen as an unworthy conduct.</p>

<dd>I think there was an edit conflict and your edits and mine clashed. However there is a factual inaccuracy in one of your edits. I would point out that Nelson was created Viscount Nelson of the Nile as a result of the battle, hardly a sign of disapproval. I have reinstated the comment about the 2nd battle and will also put in the part about the Tsar's death and the peace negotiations.<a href="../../../d/a/b/User%7EDabbler_9770.html" title="User:Dabbler">Dabbler</a> 18:14, 19 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>We need to consider the background when considering the viscountcy. See <a href="../../../h/o/r/Horatio_Nelson_b37a.html" title="Horatio Nelson">Horatio_Nelson</a> for an explanation of his anger over his barony. It was generally accepted at the time that Copenhagen would probably not of itself have gained him that distinction had it not been for the feeling that perhaps an error had been made previously.<a href="../../../a/l/c/User%7EAlci12_990b.html" title="User:Alci12">Alci12</a> 12:25, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I concede that Nelson was indeed decorated. As for the British casualty figures, all of my Danish sources say the same thing: i.e., 2237 killed and wounded according to Parker. Danish casualty figures range from 1135 to 2215 depending on which source you look at. Fischer's report, which you have so kindly shown me, does indeed show that nobody really knows the exact figures. In fact, the Danish ships were hastily manned by volunteers from the streets of Copenhagen, not many of whom had any naval experience. Boreanesia 18:36, 19 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"Supporting the British line were smaller British bomb vessels, which were positioned where they could bombard the city without fear of retaliation."</p>
<p>The high trajectory of a bomb vessel's weapon was useful and intended for attack on fortifications. It didn't provie long range compared to a cannon. If the designer of the shore defences had built forts which commanded the roads, <i>except</i> for positions convenient to shell the defences and the city at short range, then perhaps he didn't do it very well? In that cae something to that effect might go in the article there. <a href="../../../m/i/d/User%7EMidgley_e5a1.html" title="User:Midgley">Midgley</a> 14:32, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think during the battle, the bomb vessels will have been there to fire at the Danish shipd, not the city. They were positioned hard up against the Middle Ground, as far from the city as possible. <a href="../../../m/a/g/User%7EMAG1_a42b.html" title="User:MAG1">MAG1</a> 11:25, 30 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Bomb vessels were usually used to fire on cities and forts rather than other ships. They were not very accurate and hitting another ship would be difficult (though easier if they were moored in lines), for examples of their use and their threat see the Second <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Copenhagen_%281807%29_7be6.html" title="Battle of Copenhagen (1807)">Battle of Copenhagen</a>, the threatened bombardment of Cadiz. Basically they were there to intimidate the political leadership with the fear of mass civilian casualties and to encourage surrender. <a href="../../../d/a/b/User%7EDabbler_9770.html" title="User:Dabbler">Dabbler</a> 11:55, 30 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>But they were sited far away from the shore, so it is unlikely that they would have been intimidating to the city itself, see the map <a href="http://www.historyofwar.org/Maps/maps_copenhagen3.html" class="external text" title="http://www.historyofwar.org/Maps/maps_copenhagen3.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>. The Danish ships and forts were fixed, and so they might have been effective against them. Incidentally, the map was published in 1899- anyone know whether that means it is out of copyright? <a href="../../../m/a/g/User%7EMAG1_a42b.html" title="User:MAG1">MAG1</a> 14:22, 30 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>This <a href="http://website.lineone.net/~d.bolton/Guns/guns2.htm" class="external text" title="http://website.lineone.net/~d.bolton/Guns/guns2.htm" rel="nofollow">link</a> gives ranges of up to 4200 yards for mortars fired from ships and although its hard to see from the map above, the bombs would be in range of the city from the edge of the Middle Ground. However, once the Danish ships had been subdued, there would be nothing to stop the bombs from approaching closer to bombard the city. The web site also suggests that it was this threat (later carried out in 1807) which prompted the agreement for a ceasefire once the Danish ships started surrendering. <a href="../../../d/a/b/User%7EDabbler_9770.html" title="User:Dabbler">Dabbler</a> 15:39, 30 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>You're completely right- it's what it says in the DNB as well, though the idea was for the bomb vessels to move towards the city once the Danish ships had been silenced, hence their little huddle out of harm's way. I've changed the article. <a href="../../../m/a/g/User%7EMAG1_a42b.html" title="User:MAG1">MAG1</a> 21:14, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've added quite alot that explains much of the contoversies. I can find no support for the assertion that Parker reported 2237 casualties- perhaps he was referring to Danish casualties? In any case, this is a thing that would have been known exactly from ships' records. I am afraid I have taken out the paragraph suggesting that 'Danish historians' stating that somehow the battle was not a British victory, partly because of the weasel 'Danish historians', partly because it was not at all clear what was being asserted. <a href="../../../m/a/g/User%7EMAG1_a42b.html" title="User:MAG1">MAG1</a> 11:25, 30 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I notice that the text here about the flag incident is inconsisteny with that in the article <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Bligh_8a49.html" title="William Bligh">William Bligh</a> which says "When Nelson feigned not to notice the signal 43 of Admiral Parker to stop the battle and kept the signal 16 hoisted to continue the engagement, Bligh on the Glatton was the only captain who could see the conflicting two signals." whereas this article says "Seeing that Nelson had not repeated the signal, nearly all the Captains also ignored it." Which is true? --<a href="../../../r/g/c/User%7ERgclegg_deb7.html" title="User:Rgclegg">Richard Clegg</a> 12:22, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Search me- what's your article? I gleaned this from the Dictionary of National Biography, which is pretty authoritative, and included the story about Graves. It seems a bit unlikely that Bligh would be the only one, but it's possible: all accounts from battle participants are amazingly confused. I've made the wording in the article cagier. <a href="../../../m/a/g/User%7EMAG1_a42b.html" title="User:MAG1">MAG1</a> 21:42, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Afraid I know nothing which would help. I was browsing Wikipedia and I happened to notice the inconsistency. --<a href="../../../r/g/c/User%7ERgclegg_deb7.html" title="User:Rgclegg">Richard Clegg</a> 23:48, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
