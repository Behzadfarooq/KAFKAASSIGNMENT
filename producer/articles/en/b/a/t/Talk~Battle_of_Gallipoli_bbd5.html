<p>Strictly speaking, Von Sanders(An ottoman Pasha even before World War) was the Turkish commander. I only included Germany as a combatant because they provided machine gunners and artillery(*false batteries over gallipoli was built by Abdulhamit II) . Also submarines, I guess, plus the German crews remained on the <i>Breslau</i> and <i>Goeben</i> even once they became Turkish vessels. Perhaps Germany's role in Gallipoli isn't big enough to warrant a "combatant" tag. If we include them, we probably should include Newfoundland and Malta and the Zion Mule Corps and so on for the Allied side. <a href="../../../g/s/l/User%7EGsl_d00e.html" title="User:Gsl">Gsl</a> 06:33, 19 Dec 2003 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Von Sanders was not in Turkish side,he was infact dieing on the other. He have made many "mistakes" like moving troops inner fields at the beginning of the invasion. So the allied forces have landed easily to Gallipoly. It is obviousy an evidence of exceptional stupidity for a costal war. But in fact it wasn't the stupidity.</dd>
<dd>He aimed to make war longer to lighten Allied forces for Germany. That made the Turks pay much higer price for the victory.</dd>

<p>Hamilton's leadership was distant &amp; incompetent, &amp; the ANZACs were little better. They went ashore against trivial opposition &amp; stopped, evidently not aware (or concerned) their objective was to link up &amp; defeat the Turks. Something needs to be said about this. Something also needs to be said about the poor planning &amp; co-ordination that hamstrung the troops when they did land. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrekphiler_ea82.html" title="User:Trekphiler">Trekphiler</a> 06:25, 29 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>The problem with this article is that the campaign is <i>never</i> called "the Battle of Gallipoli" in any of the combatant countries. In Britain it is called the Dardanelles Campaign and in Australia and New Zealand it is simply called Gallipoli, or sometimes the Gallipoli Landings. I don't know what it's called in France.

<dd>Perhaps the current <a href="../../../g/a/l/Gallipoli.html" title="Gallipoli">Gallipoli</a> page becomes "Gallipoli (disambiguation)".

<p>I have no problems with amee foxs suggestion, but I think on further thought that the problem is that Gallipoli wasn't a "battle" at all, it was a campaign lasting several months, with a series of engagements but no single "battle." I could therefore argue that the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Gallipoli_132c.html" title="Battle of Gallipoli">Battle of Gallipoli</a> article be dropped and its content shifted to Gallipoli (military campaign) or something like that. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 02:32, 29 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There are plenty of month-long "battles" made up of a series of smaller engagements, for example the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_the_Somme_%281916%29_72c7.html" title="Battle of the Somme (1916)">Battle of the Somme (1916)</a> ("Somme Offensive") and <a href="../../../t/h/i/Third_Battle_of_Ypres_dcca.html" title="Third Battle of Ypres">Third Battle of Ypres</a> ("Flanders Offensive"). That said, I agree "Battle of Gallipoli" isn't the conventional name here however I favour the consistent "battle of" nomenclature for the main entry, though I seem to be in the minority. Unless someone wants to make an executive decision, I guess we assemble the alternatives and run a vote. <a href="../../../g/s/l/User%7EGsl_d00e.html" title="User:Gsl">Geoff</a> 23:25, 29 Jan 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I agree, Adam. <a href="../../../g/a/l/Gallipoli_campaign.html" title="Gallipoli campaign">Gallipoli campaign</a> or Gallipoli (campaign) or something similar. It isn't called "the Battle of Gallipoli" by anyone, and it wasn't a battle, it was a whole series of them. From the point of view of link-friendliness, most people will want to just link it as <a href="../../../g/a/l/Gallipoli.html" title="Gallipoli">Gallipoli</a>, so Gallipoli (campaign) allows the pipe trick. On the other hand, <a href="../../../g/a/l/Gallipoli_campaign.html" title="Gallipoli campaign">Gallipoli campaign</a> looks better. Or even (shock horror) <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Gallipoli_132c.html" title="Battle of Gallipoli">Battle of Gallipoli</a>?

<dd>Is "the Dardanelles Campaign" the official British designation (for example, for <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_honours.html" title="Battle honours">battle honours</a>)?

<p>Seems to me "Battle of Gallipoli" is inappropriate. It wasn't a single action, as "battle" implies, but a campaign. I agree, it's rarely called "Dardanelles Campaign", which would be correct; I'd suggest retitle the page &amp; redirect via Gallipol links (the most common usage) from pages that are concerned with it. Others I'd say should go to a disambiguation page. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrekphiler_ea82.html" title="User:Trekphiler">Trekphiler</a> 05:47, 29 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Gallipoli should be a Campaign, not a Battle! As it is always called in Australia &amp; New Zealand, while in Britain it is the Dardanelles Campaign (not Battle). While said to be against the Wiki naming policy, but the page dealing with the policy does not make any mention of Campaigns or Theatres in a War! Wiki has in WWI “the Sinai-Palestine Campaign” and in the American Civil War the Franklin-Nashville Campaign and the Trans- Mississippi Theatre. Are we going to call them the Sinai-Palestine Battle etc? Hugo999 12:46, 7 February 2007 (UTC) PS: this discussion started in 2004, why not do it!</p>

<p>It is an very good article; however, I think it would be <i>more</i> historically accurate to use the word Ottoman wherever possible, instead of "Turkish", except in relation to specific individuals (etc). That is to say, it's possible that two thirds of the Ottoman forces were Arab conscripts. Obviously there were many other ethnic groups in the empire as well. Check this interesting article at al Jazeera's website: "The forgotten Arabs of Gallipoli", by Jonathan Gorvett, 14 January 2004<a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/25781E12-417F-43A7-BD92-EC91CD62D509.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/25781E12-417F-43A7-BD92-EC91CD62D509.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> (By the way, the article doesn't mention that some Arabs -- Egyptians -- served as labourers with the Allied forces.)

<dd>The history of my grandfather's unit (which was at Gallipoli, Sinai, Palestine, Syria) uses "Turk|Turkish|Turkey" an even 100 times; there's no use of "Ottoman". The first chapter of Vol VII (Sinai &amp; Palestine) of the Aus. official history is called "The Turks Invade Egypt" and uses "Turk|Turkish|Turkey" throughout (9 times on the first page, 0 for "Ottoman"). It quotes Enver Pasha as saying "Turkey has defeated the British Navy." Picking any page in Vols I, II or VII the usage is invariably "Turk*". It's the same in Keegan's "The First World War" -- once he gets over introducing it as the "Ottoman Empire", he uses "Turk*". Likewise turning to any random page in Carlyon's "Gallipoli". Even a conference article I've got, "The impact of the Ottoman Empire in the German strategy of 1915", uses "Turk*" almost exclusively.</dd>

<dd>Geoff, my apologies for not responding sooner. I disagree strongly with you on this matter; just because the Ottoman Empire forces are commonly referred to as "Turks" or Turkish", it doesn't mean that is correct. It's like the usage of "British", when the correct term would be "British Commonwealth"/"British Empire"; or "American" when the correct term is "Allied".

<dd>There were Arab divisions which were sent to Gallipoli as reinforcements but there are many legends about their effect on the war and at one point Atatürk said "Give me the Turks" because of the poor performance of the Arab troops both because of their poor will of fight and the unsuitable battleground for them (they were trained and fought in the Middle East, a totally different place than Gallipoli).

<p>Nothing so exotic. A unit of a couple of hundred soldiers were seen to push on against weak opposition, became cut off and none returned in a campaign where most Allied dead were not identifed. The Graves Commission found the bodies in 1919. Reason the incident was more well known than other incidents was most of them were employed by the English Royal Family at the Sandringham Estate.

<p>"The Ottoman Empire had been dismissed by Tsar Nicholas I of Russia as "the sick man of Europe" but after victory over the Allies at Gallipoli, Turkey's visions of the empire were renewed." It seems absurd to call turkish military operations as "visions of empire", especially in an article about a british millitary operation in the ottoman territory.</p>

<dd>Note - before checking the changes to this talk page I reverted an edit of blatant vandalism (insertion of the words 'prostitute' and 'pimp' etc., but moved two versions back, not having seen any justification for the removal of the paragraph. Feel free to re-remove the para from aftermath if considered justified, but be careful not to switch back to the vandalised version. Is there a source for this para? it sounds like a quote. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDramatic_bee8.html" title="User:Dramatic">dramatic</a> 08:58, 8 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Consider it fourthed. The numbers in the box at the top right of the page seem idiotic. 700,000 turkish dead? 550,000 British empire and french dead? That cant be right.

<p>I found the numbers. Here they are.</p>
<ul>
<li>Australia: 18.500 wounded and missing - 7,594 killed.</li>
<li>New Zealand&#160;: 5,150 wounded and missing - 2,431 killed.</li>
<li>British Empire (excl. Anzac)&#160;: 198,000 wounded and missing - 22,000 killed.</li>
<li>France&#160;: 23,000 wounded and missing - 27,000 killed.</li>
<li>Ottoman Empire (Turkey)&#160;: 109,042 wounded and missing - 57,084 killed.</li>
<li>Furthermore 1.700 Indians died in Gallipoli, plus an unknown number of Germans, Newfoundlanders and Senegalese.</li>

<p>I noticed an inconsistency in the article: in the intro, it is mentioned that an estimated 500 000 soldiers died, but in the table near the end of the article, it says no more than 130 000 soldiers were killed. Since the number of wounded troops is quite similar in the intro and in the table, I would tend to believe the number of deaths would be roughly 130 000. Plus, rare are the battles leaving more dead than wounded.</p>

<p>Can the extensive "What if?" segment that opens the Aftermath section really be considered anything other than original research and thoroughly unencyclopaedic?

<blockquote>
<dl>
<dd>It is tempting to suppose the Gallipoli campaign could have had a different outcome by asking "What if?" certain events had followed a different course, whether through luck or leadership.</dd>
<dd>The Battle of Gallipoli was a finely balanced struggle with neither side able to exploit any slight advantage. When the Allies achieved a breakthrough, such as at Lone Pine or the second battle of Krithia, they lacked the reserves to continue the advance. Likewise when the Turks halted an Allied attack, their counter-attacks were unable to rout the enemy.</dd>

<p>I heard a LOT of paranormal reports about this one battle... like the on posted somewhere above me about the 5th Norfolk. Also I heard that there were supposebly bombs either fired from the ships or dropped by British bombers, not sure which one, that never hit the ground!

<p>Turkish is not just an ethnical definition dude. He, who is a Turkish Citizen, is Turkish. Battle of Gallipoli can said to be the most important section of the Turkish Independency War. And in fact, the commander of this battle was Mustafa Kemal who is honoured by Turkish nation with the name 'Atatürk' that means 'Father of Turks'. Battle of Gallipoli's why he is named so.

<p>I've restored the word "tragically" to this sentence. <i>The Turks launched a major assault at Anzac on 19 May — 42,000 Turks attacked 10,000 Australians and New Zealanders — but the attack tragically miscarried.</i></p>
<p>An anon removed the word with the following edit summary: "Non neutrol POV - Inappropriate to say "tragically" - one side's tragedy is another side's victory.."</p>
<p>I don't agree with this. To my mind the use of the descriptive word is linked to the attack, not the campaign as a whole. Of course this attack was a tragedy for the Turks, just as the Nek assault was a tragedy for the Australians.
