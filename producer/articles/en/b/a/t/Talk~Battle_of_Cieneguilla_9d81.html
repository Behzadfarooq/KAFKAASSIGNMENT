<p>for the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Cieneguilla_71f0.html" title="Battle of Cieneguilla">Battle of Cieneguilla</a> and have put my questions on the discussion page. I am going to ask this of all the candidates and would prefer your answer to be here, though duplicating it on the talk page seems like a good idea. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarptrash_5c7f.html" title="User:Carptrash">Carptrash</a> 19:21, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I've been working on the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Cieneguilla_71f0.html" title="Battle of Cieneguilla">Battle of Cieneguilla</a> for a couple of years, mostly because it occurred perhaps 10 miles from where I live. There is not much out about this event (<a href="../../../1/s/t/1st_Cavalry_Regiment_%28United_States%29_7b2f.html" title="1st Cavalry Regiment (United States)">see here</a>), on wikipedia or elsewhere, and so much of what I have to offer is perilously close to being the dreaded <a href="../../../o/r/i/Original_research.html" title="Original research">original research</a>. The exact location of the event is not very public knowledge, it is remote and very close to the edge of <a href="../../../p/i/c/Picuris_Pueblo_18a9.html" title="Picuris Pueblo">Picuris Pueblo</a>, where one should not just go wandering in. However when I did locate the site of the fight I discovered the markers left by US government archeologists who did a survey. So, anyway, my question is, what role, if any should such research play in the constructing of a wikipedia article? Also, the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Park_Service_2873.html" title="National Park Service">National Park Service</a> archeologist would prefer that the site location not be public knowledge. How should I handle this request in my write-up? <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarptrash_5c7f.html" title="User:Carptrash">Carptrash</a> 19:21, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>the archeologists are going to publish their results. This will be material you can quote on the topic. If it is OK you can take some pictures from the excavation, but wait until they have finished. The big problem are tombraiders who dig for anything they can sell appropriate it to themselves illegally. The biggest problem is that this way they destroy the possibility for a closer interpretation of the findings based on their relative position. <a href="../../../w/a/n/User%7EWandalstouring_ea93.html" title="User:Wandalstouring">Wandalstouring</a> 19:41, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>From a first cut I would question notability at present, the article makes no assertion of notability other than the occurence. So the first thing I'd be asking for is some published evidence of importance.</dd>
<dd>Clearly both <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">WP:COI</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> would have some bearing on how to approach things. My interpretaion of COI isn't too strict so I wouldn't wish to prevent you writing on what's clearly a hobby. In terms of OR and reliability I'd be prepared to discuss unpublished sources as long as there was some way to demonstrate their authority. There is a lot of material which could be used but doesn't meet a strict interpretaion of the guidelines, ephemera, internal documents (regimental history for example) which are now available in public domain etc. I'd be expecting a fairly rigorous discussion of the situation though, drawing attention to the ephemeral nature of the evidence used to support the article and caveating the content. There are some who take a much harder line than this but I'm very conscious that WP brings people from all disciplines, not just academia!</dd>
<dd>I would not support the use of the archeologists markers as evidence and would await the publication of their results before it can be used.</dd>
<dd>If the detailed location of the site is not published then I would respect the wishes of the archeologist. There are many good reasons for not encouraging visits to sites where field research is not complete. Should the location be included in any subsequent publication of results then it can be sourced and included.</dd>

<dd>They, the archeologists were there perhaps 5 or 6 years ago (I was there on the day of the 100th anniversary and they'd been there years before that) and nothing beyond a newspaper article has come to my attention. As far as the notability of the skirmish goes, well that will hopefully come out soon. I mostly posted this stub to have a place to ask candidates questions about the use of <a href="../../../o/r/i/Original_research.html" title="Original research">original research</a> and about their attitudes to requests from officials and other authority figures. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarptrash_5c7f.html" title="User:Carptrash">Carptrash</a> 20:13, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'd leave the mention of the specific archaeological markers out as non-notable and original research, but I'd probably put in a DMS geographical coordinate so people could find the general location on a map. --<a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPetercorless_834d.html" title="User:Petercorless">Petercorless</a> 22:59, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I could be misinterpreting the purpose of this exercise, but as it appears to be something of a test towards our opinions and approaches as asst coordinators, I'm responding w/o reading anyone else's responses. -- (1) I think that if you have access to actual research data or results, even unpublished, it's fine to use here on Wikipedia, as it's produced by professional archaeologists &amp; researchers, and reflects the truthful, accurate results of their research even if it's not officially published. If, however, you've simply found the site and are essentially interpreting it yourself based on what you've found, then I would advise against pursuing it unless you're a professional. Using unpublished research produced by professionals is not <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>, but interpreting the site on your own is. (2) I couldn't care less what The Government wants, but I have a great respect for archaeologists and researchers - if they do not want their site invaded, trampled, or otherwise disturbed by visitors or tourists, then I think we owe them our cooperation in not revealing its precise location. <a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELordAmeth_30dd.html" title="User:LordAmeth">LordAmeth</a> 11:51, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Actually you are one of only two or three who seemed to have understood "the purpose of this exercise." I was not asking for help in finding resources, rather trying to get your {all the candidates} opinions on the issues I apparently did NOT present well. Yet you seem to have understood them. I have, for example a letter, a typed version of a letter, given to me by the Nat PArk Service archeologist, written by an officer who was in New Mexico at the time that was the catalyst for the Court of Inquiry that followed the battle. Yet this letter has never, to my knowledge, been published, nor do I even know where the original is. I also have perhaps a dozen pages of the transcript of of C of I, also given to my by the NPS folks that I don't think has been published. I feel that there are crucial to the telling and understanding of this event. You (if I am reading you correctly) suggest that I should use them in subsequent postings here and I intend to do so.

<dd>Sorry to respond late, I but I have been bogged down a bit over the weekend. In my opinion if the site of the battle is wanted to be kept away from public by archaeologists, I think we should respect their wishes. But I do think that we sould put a marker on a map to show an approximate location of the batle field. <a href="../../../k/y/r/User%7EKyriakos_b5e6.html" title="User:Kyriakos">Kyriakos</a> 09:12, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My general comments is the stub can be easily fleshed out into a good short article drawing from the above resources, which I would expect an editor to look around and check before doing things such as marking them for deletion (AfD), and also to corroborate the assertions of even a stub. I'd encourage you to do a bit more checking, as what I came up with was only cursory initial findings. You mention archaeologists. In a way, we are data archaeologists. So... Get into a search engine and start digging! --<a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPetercorless_834d.html" title="User:Petercorless">Petercorless</a> 23:08, 14 February 2007 (UTC)

Bennett, (aka James Bronson) a Sergeant who . . ...</i> " so I've made him a private for now and perhaps he'll get a promotion shortly. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarptrash_5c7f.html" title="User:Carptrash">Carptrash</a> 18:10, 15 February 2007 (UTC) In <i>Forts and Forays</i> it says of him, "<i>In six years his rank climbed from private to sargent before an unknown infraction reduced him to the ranks.</i>" Where he was in March 1854 is not yet clear. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarptrash_5c7f.html" title="User:Carptrash">Carptrash</a> 18:15, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Do we have a ref which tells us that James Bennett and James Bronson (aka Beaty) are the same person? I don't doubt it as both men were from Virginia as Davidson was but i am just being curious. -- <i><a href="../../../f/a/y/User%7EFayssalF_b498.html" title="User:FayssalF"><font size="2px" face="Verdana"><font color="DarkSlateBlue">Szvest</font></font></a></i> - <small><a href="../../../f/a/y/User_talk%7EFayssalF_f604.html" title="User talk:FayssalF"><font style="background: gold"><sup><i>Wiki me up ®</i></sup></font></a></small> 19:18, 15 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, they are the same person. I have the book at home (I'm at <a href="../../../k/l/d/KLDK_3160.html" title="KLDK">KLDK</a> now). but I'll post it later.

<dd>I am a bit surprised to se Bennett/Bronson re-emerge as both a Sargent and a Private. Since it is my policy to not revert folks edits of my edits I'm, hoping for some explaination. The story on the fellows two names - from his book <i>Forts and Forays</i> is that as a 18 year old he (Bennett) got drunk and enlisted as a 21 year old Bronson. Since he later deserted he probably became Bennett again at that time and it is as Bennett that he publishes his memoirs. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarptrash_5c7f.html" title="User:Carptrash">Carptrash</a> 18:45, 16 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>You might want to edit the refences to Bennett/Bronson, and include his story here in this page, and make a redirect to this article, since I doubt he will get a full biography elsewhere as a notable person. However, his story here might make for a nice bit of color. --<a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPetercorless_834d.html" title="User:Petercorless">Petercorless</a> 19:27, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, I can expand on him a bit -though today is my daughter's birthday and tomorrow is a largish social event at my house, so it might wait a bit. However Bennett's memoirs of his life and times in New Mexico is one of the significant first person accounts of that time, so I think an argument for notability could be made. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarptrash_5c7f.html" title="User:Carptrash">Carptrash</a> 20:29, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In cases where there is uncertainty like this, it is best to put a range, and cite each of the conflicting sources. Rather than make an assumption that any of them are correct, especially without evidence, it would be best to cite these sources which alternately say 130, 250, or 400 Native Americans, and then put 130–400 in the range for the forces involved in the battle. --<a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPetercorless_834d.html" title="User:Petercorless">Petercorless</a> 23:30, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I just received an email from someone who is preparing to publish an account of this fight in the New Mexico Historical Review - a pretty solid source as far as they go. Here is what he writes: (The <b>bold</b> is mine)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Einar: Thanks for the note. The dead are buried in Taos. The Jicarillas were apparently led by Chacon.</dd>
<dd>I have read Bell's letter and the transcript of the court of inquiry. As noted by Bell, the troops did not have sufficient ammunition for a 4 hour battle. He (Sgt. or Pvt. Bennett) testified favorably to Davidson at the court of inquiry. Davidson had made him a sergeant in Company B and Mrs. Davidson had kindly tended to his wounds after the battle. <b>He was most certainly biased</b>. Bell was not allowed to testify at the hearing and cross-examine Davidson's witnesses. In short, <b>the hearing was a cover up with Davidson's version taken as gospel for the next 150 years.</b></dd>
</dl>
<p>So the "biased" and the "cover up" versions are what have been published and is thus (<b>question for candidates</b>) are still what we should be using to write the article? <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarptrash_5c7f.html" title="User:Carptrash">Carptrash</a> 03:39, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Cite references and then also cite counter-references. Let the people decide between the claims. If this person is going to publish their work soon, cite it also.
