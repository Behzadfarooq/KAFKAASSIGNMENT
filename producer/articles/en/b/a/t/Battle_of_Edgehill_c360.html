The inconclusive result denied the Royalists the chance to march on London and achieve a quick victory over the Parliamentarians, and led to three years of civil war.</p>
<p><a href="../../../p/r/i/Prince_Rupert_5295.html" title="Prince Rupert">Prince Rupert</a>, at Shrewsbury, held <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_Civil_War_6bfe.html#The_First_English_Civil_War" title="English Civil War">war council</a> considering two courses of action: Either to advance towards Essex's new position near Worcester, or as the road to London was open to advance towards London. It was decided to advance towards London not to avoid a battle, for the Royalist generals wanted to fight Essex before he grew too strong, and the temper of both sides made it impossible to postpone the decision. In the <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earl_of_Clarendon_3746.html" title="Earl of Clarendon">Earl of Clarendon</a>'s words: "it was considered more counsellable to march towards London, it being morally sure that Essex would put himself in their way". Accordingly, the army left Shrewsbury on October 12th, gaining two days' start on the enemy, and moved south-east. This had the desired effect as it forced Essex to move to intercept them. On the morning of October 23rd, the Royalists readied for battle near the top of Edgehill, facing towards Kineton. Essex, was an experienced soldier, yet lacked trust in the rather inexperienced Parliamentarian army too much to decide the previous <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Powick_Bridge_0f1b.html" title="Battle of Powick Bridge">Battle of Powick Bridge</a> on the 23rd of September.</p>

In parallel to Charles' southerly movement, the <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Devereux%2C_3rd_Earl_of_Essex_42e1.html" title="Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex">Earl of Essex</a> with the <a href="../../../r/o/u/Roundhead.html" title="Roundhead">Parliamentarian</a> forces set out from <a href="../../../w/o/r/Worcester%2C_England_597c.html" title="Worcester, England">Worcester</a>, also headed for London. By <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_21.html" title="October 21">21 October</a> they were barely seven miles away from each other.</p>
<p>Perceiving the dangers of a <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flank.html" title="Flank">flanking</a> attack, Charles was persuaded by <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prince_Rupert_of_the_Rhine_0e3c.html" title="Prince Rupert of the Rhine">Prince Rupert</a> to deploy on the side of <a href="../../../e/d/g/Edge_Hill%2C_Warwickshire_d805.html" title="Edge Hill, Warwickshire">Edge Hill</a>. Essex, unaware of their proximity, drew dangerously close before actually preparing his troops. Battle commenced in the afternoon of <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_23.html" title="October 23">23 October</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Edgehill_c360.html" title="Edit section: Tactics">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Tactics</span></h2>
<p>As Charles rode past his forces to raise <a href="../../../m/o/r/Morale.html" title="Morale">morale</a>, the Parliamentarian <a href="../../../a/r/t/Artillery.html" title="Artillery">artillery</a> opened fire because they thought they were being teased. This started an exchange of artillery fire that lasted for about an hour. At this point Prince Rupert started the battle properly by leading the Royalist <a href="../../../c/a/v/Cavalry.html" title="Cavalry">cavalry</a> charge, whereupon a substantial number of the Parliamentarian cavalry defected by prior arrangement and rode off to join the Royalists. A swath was cut through the remaining cavalry on the Parliamentarian left wing so that two neighboring <a href="../../../i/n/f/Infantry.html" title="Infantry">infantry</a> regiments were disrupted. Many of their men routed and ran when faced by Rupert's cavalry and the sight of their own cavalry's treachery. The Royalist cavalry continued in pursuit of the fleeing infantry sensing a raid on Essex's baggage train at Kineton, leaving the Royalist right unsupported.</p>
<p>Soon after, with Parliamentarians and Royalists engaged below Edgehill, before <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radway.html" title="Radway">Radway</a>, Balfour routed <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Byron%2C_1st_Baron_Byron_2ca1.html" title="John Byron, 1st Baron Byron">Sir John Byron</a>'s Brigade at the heart of the Royalist formation. On the right flank of the action, a dramatic moment marked the peak of the fighting, when Sir <a href="../../../e/d/m/Edmund_Verney_803d.html" title="Edmund Verney">Edmund Verney</a> was killed defending the Royalist Standard. Though the Standard was briefly captured by Parliamentarian Ensign Arthur Young, it was soon back in the hands of the Royalists after only six minutes.</p>
<p>The Parliamentarian cavalry reserve was brought up and the Royalist infantry centre, unprotected by cavalry, was cut apart from the rear. This is where <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Bertie%2C_1st_Earl_of_Lindsey_5068.html" title="Robert Bertie, 1st Earl of Lindsey">Lord Lindsey</a> died. The Royalist Cavalry at Kineton returned to the fold and kept Rupert's center from collapsing entirely under Lieutenant General Balfour's assault. The Royalist infantry managed to regroup and form a new defensive line. Essex, conscious of the gathering darkness, soon decided to disengage, though the battle wouldn't officially end until the next morning.</p>
<p>The greatest error of the battle would prove to be Rupert's Cavalry raid at Kineton, which ultimately cost the Royalists the chance of a decisive victory over the Parliamentarians.</p>
<p>The action before Edgehill on the 23rd of October, 1642 is said to have lasted only four hours. Four hours inevitably leading to four years of bloodshed and civil war.</p>
<p><a name="Outcome" id="Outcome"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Edgehill_c360.html" title="Edit section: Outcome">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Outcome</span></h2>
<p>Neither side at Edgehill could claim a decisive victory. Essex withdrew to Warwick Castle and the road to London was now open to King Charles. Prince Rupert pieced together the remains of his cavalry and appealed to King Charles to advance upon London. Charles denied Rupert's desire and rightfully so. In London, the Parliamentarians gathered numerous though inexperienced citizen-troops as a garrison (by the time his troops reached Reading, Essex had regained the city, preventing any further royalist advance).</p>
<p>Charles' caution asserting itself, the Royalists lost the clearest opportunity of the war to strike at the Parliamentarians center of resistance to the crown. Both sides having lost an oddly symmetrical 3000 wounded and 3000 dead (estimated), neither side could claim the day, though Essex claimed a victory for the Parliamentarians. This claim came after King Charles offered Essex a pardon and marked the beginning of a bloody, modern war.</p>
<p>The high number of surviving wounded has been attributed to the cold conditions of the night from October 23rd to the 24th, 1642 (allowing many wounds to congeal and stave off infection or simply, bleeding to death).</p>
<p>On the morning of the 24th, both sides were still on the field, but neither engaged in further action. England would have two "Capitals". London in the hands of the Parliamentarians and Oxford.</p>
<p>Charles and the Royalists rested at the university-city of Oxford for the winter, securing the city and forming a redoubt.</p>
<p>The next time King Charles would see London would be in the arms of his captors for his beheading.</p>
