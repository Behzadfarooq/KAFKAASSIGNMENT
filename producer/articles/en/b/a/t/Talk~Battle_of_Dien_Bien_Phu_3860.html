<dd>"the first time that a non-European colonial independence movement had evolved through all the stages from guerrilla bands to a conventionally organized and equipped army able to defeat a modern Western occupier in pitched battle."</dd>
</dl>
<p>What "does Non-European colonial mean"? Does that exculude movements made up of decendents of Europeans? But even if one ignores the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_War_of_Independence_edf0.html" title="American War of Independence">American War of Independence</a>, (and south American independence wars), European colonial history is littered with examples of locals defeating European's in pitched battles. For example <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_Anglo-Afghan_War_9781.html" title="First Anglo-Afghan War">First Anglo-Afghan War</a>, and closer to all things French (which also meets the guerrilla bands proviso without any quibbles), <a href="../../../h/a/i/Haiti.html#Independence" title="Haiti">Haitian Independence</a> and the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Verti%C3%A8res_4f26.html" title="Battle of Vertières">Battle of Vertières</a> (<a href="../../../n/o/v/November_18.html" title="November 18">November 18</a>, 1803) which was only the last of several pitched battles the rebels won against a number of European powers. As the quote is so clearly incorrect I think it should be removed. --<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Baird_Shearer_a81d.html" title="User:Philip Baird Shearer">Philip Baird Shearer</a> 22:20, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The "non-european colonial" is obviously in there to exclude something, but I don't know what that something is. The American Revolution was entirely a conventional (read: non-guerilla) conflict, so by defintion, it never evolved through the stages. I don't know enough about the other conflicts you mention to say for sure, but I doubt that those evolved through the stages either. I think it's correct and should stay in. <a href="../../../r/a/u/User%7ERaul654_54a3.html" title="User:Raul654">Raul654</a> 23:13, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm not sure if I can accuratly answer what non european colonial might be trying to exclude, but I can tell you that the lines <i>the first time that a non-European colonial independence movement had evolved through all the stages from guerrilla bands to a conventionally organized and equipped army able to defeat a modern Western occupier in pitched battle.</i> have been lifted <b>precisly as they are there</b> from Martin Windrow's <i>the last valley</i>. Isn't direct copying of such a book a violation of copyright or something? Unless of course, Mr. Windrow wrote parts of this article himself, which of course is fine. Incidentally, I know this for certain because I was reading that very line as i clicked onto this talk page. <a href="../../../s/g/g/User%7ESGGH_ea0b.html" title="User:SGGH">SGGH</a> 20:28, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This line also, while not lifted from the text, isn't something I expected, <i>As a result of blunders in the French decision making process, the French undertook to create an air-supplied base, at Dien Bien Phu, deep in the hills of Vietnam</i> the same text that I am reading refers to the fortress construction as a deliberate attempt to draw Giap into "smashing his inexperienced forces against [the fortress]". This is just a minor query of course, my point above is more pressing. <a href="../../../s/g/g/User%7ESGGH_ea0b.html" title="User:SGGH">SGGH</a> 20:32, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The box on the right states that the strength of the French force was 10,800 soldiers, but immediately below, under "Casualties," it gives the following:</p>
<p>2,293 dead, 5,195 wounded, 11,800 captured</p>
<p>Obviously, at least one of the figures is wrong. I'm guessing it's the "captured" tally, but I don't know for certain. <a href="../../../f/u/n/User%7EFunnyhat_e35c.html" title="User:Funnyhat">Funnyhat</a> 05:48, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Neither is wrong. The strength given is for March 13 (the day the fighting started). The casualty figure is for the entire battle (through May 7). The difference between the two is [approximately] the number of reinforcements the French dropped into the battle between March 13 and May 7. <a href="../../../r/a/u/User%7ERaul654_54a3.html" title="User:Raul654">Raul654</a> 06:38, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I feel that a few of the edits were solid changes. Raul recently reverted the edits, so I feel a discusion is in order here to determine which should stay and which should be changed. I'm not all that interested either way, since both are accurate enough, so I'll leave most of the discusion to the main writers. — <b><a href="../../../d/e/c/User%7EDeckiller_96c6.html" title="User:Deckiller">Deckill</a><a href="../../../d/e/c/User_talk%7EDeckiller_aecd.html" title="User talk:Deckiller">er</a></b> 04:49, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Removing and worse - altering - quotes is not an improvement at all. Removing the refereence to Oskar von Hutier is not an improvemet.

<p>What was that Bulwinkle cartoon? Freeless Leader was obsessing about the anti-antimissile missile. I am glad that the phrase counter-counter is no longer in the article. The rest of today's attempted changes were incremental at best and rejected by those better-read in the matter. But I still dislike direct quote about no-medical-facilities being bad for morale. Wikipedia should be able to indicate thus in its own authentic voice. It hardly strains credulity and there is a supporting citation.

<p>This article is weighted quite heavily against the French high command. The French Generals, Navarre in particular, were not as ignorant as this article seems to make out. I've made one edit to try to remove a little bit what I feel is a traditionalist dominated account which is rather unencyclopedic in place, but I won't proceed with more without mentioning it on the talk page, as per wikiquette.</p>
<p>I am hoping to give fair article time to the more revisionist historians in order to give space for both interpretations, or in the least to just remove the one sided attack of the French high command.</p>
<p>This isn't a comment on contributers, so please don't see it as an attack. Cheers <a href="../../../s/g/g/User%7ESGGH_ea0b.html" title="User:SGGH">SGGH</a> 16:30, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>firstly, Navarre didn't blindly fall into the trap, I don't believe that this article is neutral enough on this point. There is plenty of evidence showing Navarre to be aware of the risks, and that his plan to lure the Viet Minh into a traditional battle had merit, in light of previous failures at Na San and during Giap's 'western style' failed assault on the Delta.</li>
<li>secondly, there were other constaints Navarre had to deal with which also I don't think have fair mention in this article, particularly the continuous demand for troops from the french commanders in the Delta, which absorbed part of Navarres command. I also don't think the article gives enough merit to the fact that the possibility of having to defent laos was an important factor for Navarre, the article just makes a small mention of it at the end without alluding to the true weight of it in the thinking process.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm not proposing major changes, I just think this article should give more air time to the factors which Navarre had to content with, rather than focusing on his 'inability' to command, which is what I feel it does now. <a href="../../../s/g/g/User%7ESGGH_ea0b.html" title="User:SGGH">SGGH</a> 16:34, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>For example, <i>The arrival of the 316th Viet Minh division prompted Cogny to order the evacuation of the Lai Chau garrison to Dien Bien Phu, exactly as Giap had anticipated</i>. The evacuation of the garrison at Lai Chau had been planned before the establishment of an air-base at Dien Bien Phu, as far as I knew... <a href="../../../s/g/g/User%7ESGGH_ea0b.html" title="User:SGGH">SGGH</a> 17:33, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think there are some serious POV issues with this article, I'm surprised that it has been a featured article. In contrast to the French side, there is no discussion of the strategic significance of the battle for the Viet Minh. I assume this kind of information is now in the public domain. The narrative is told essentially from a European POV - a concrete example, but which to my mind illustrates the general tone - section 2.8 is called "the final defeat" - why not "the final victory" or, more NPOV, "the final battle"? I don't know enough about the subject to change this myself, but I would be interested to know what the general feeling is. I think this is very POV. --Brianpie 09:43, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I tend to agree, though I think the addition or replacement of just a few words would go some way to balancing things out - your suggestion of <i>the final battle</i> is a good example. Otherwise, I'd certainly like to see much more information about/from the Viet Minh forces. <a href="../../../p/i/n/User%7EPinkville_8753.html" title="User:Pinkville">Pinkville</a> 11:23, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Article sited that "The battle was depicted in Diên Biên Phu, a 1992 documentary film by French director Pierre Schoendoerffer."

<p>I changed a reference to giving survivors "basic triage" to "basic first aid," because triage is a quick judgement process, not medical care. While I was in there I fixed some other language, but the Prisoners section is still a little muddy. For example, the statement "many of [the prisoners were] Legionnaires of German origin" is (A) buried in this section, and (B) not supported by its citation. The source says "[M]any ex-SS men fought and died at the Battle of Dien Bien Phu in 1954," but that's not the same as saying many of the <i>survivors</i> were German. If somebody's interested enough they can remove that or move the reference to German fighters somewhere else. Chester320 08:47, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Well, I missed the boat on the FAC discussions, but I hope you all don't mind that I've started adding some queries and corrections to this generally excellent article. I left a fair number of SGML questions/comments that refer to lingering minor problems. I got about half way through the article and I'd like to go through the rest later on today.

<p>Continuing with some copyediting, etc.... The paragraph beginning <i>Much to French disbelief...</i> is confused and confusing. I knew nothing about direct and indirect artillery and, I fear, I'm none the wiser having read this. I have a sense of the point intended - that in spite of the fact that the Viet Minh were forced (due to lack of effective lines of communication and experienced gun crews) to use poorly regarded direct artillery, they turned this apparent setback to their advantage and inflicted greater damage on French positions than the French command would have anticipated. Do I understand this correctly? As it stands, the paragraph in question has several unfinished ideas and is very wooly. Can someone tighten it up?</p>
<p>In the subsection <i>March 30–April 5 assaults</i>, we are suddenly introduced to the designations <i>Dominique 1 and 2</i>, etc. but without explanation. There are numbers on some of the maps that presumably correspond to the numbers in the main text, but what do they refer to? Hills? Troop positions? Map coordinates? A one or two word explanation would be nice.</p>
<p>We read that <i>the French launched a fierce counterattack against Eliane 2, and recaptured half of it</i>, but in the preceding paragraph we read that <i>The 316th division captured... half of Eliane 2..."; doesn't this mean that the French counterattack resulted in the recapture of all of Eliane 2, or is something missing?</i></p>
<p>The description of low morale among the Viet Minh troops comes across as not quite believable - sandwiched as it is between descrptions of their remarkable military successes... And isn't there more information about conditions, planning, etc. within the Viet Minh forces?</p>
<p>Also, at times it's "Castries" at other times it's "de Castries". The better form should be used consistently through the article - I suspect it's "de Castries", but I don't know for sure. <a href="../../../p/i/n/User%7EPinkville_8753.html" title="User:Pinkville">Pinkville</a> 02:49, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
