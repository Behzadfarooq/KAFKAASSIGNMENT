<p>Please be aware that you shouldn't re-link avery time you repeat an already-linked item, unless it is far removed from the original link. It makes the text less readable. Wikipedia also has specific formats for things like in a book. The "lead" paragraph should be a summary of the subsequent article, which I sort of just made it.

<dd>Pitcairn held the perimeter while Smith began to restore what order he could to his tired men, now low on ammunition. Here they met the reinforcement they had asked for. <a href="../../../h/u/g/Hugh_Percy%2C_2nd_Duke_of_Northumberland_35ab.html" title="Hugh Percy, 2nd Duke of Northumberland">General Hugh Percy</a> brought 1,000 men, fresh ammunition, and some cannon. Marching through Roxbury and Cambridge he met the returning troop at Lexington and took command. By 2:00 in the afternoon the expanded column continued, but so did the fighting. <a href="../../../s/f/a/User%7ESfahey_e531.html" title="User:Sfahey">Sfahey</a> 14:55, 23 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I expanded upon the facts and deleted the errors. Fischer's scholarship emphasizes that no perimeter was held and there was little order until after they met Percy. Also, Percy most likely arrived in Lexington at around 2 but the rescue didn't occur until about 2:30 and the column didn't leave Lexington until about 3:30 and there were 2 cannon. The details of Percy's rescue and the fighting are an important part of the battle and are expanded upon in this version. <a href="../../../f/l/y/User%7EFlying_Jazz_a2b8.html" title="User:Flying Jazz">Flying Jazz</a> 21:01, 23 May 2005 (UTC)

<p>I hate to tell you this, but history will edit out things.(unsigned, 9/7/05)</p>
<p>In 1908 the US Senate decreed the Battle of Point Pleasant as a battle of the American Revolutionary War. The Battle of Point Pleasant occured October 10, 1774, prior to the Battle of Lexington and Concord.</p>
<p>Since the US Senate has decreed the Battle of Point Pleasant as a Revolutionary War battle, doesn't seem more accurate to describe the Battle of Lexington and Concord as "one of the first battles", rather then as "the first battle"?</p>
<p>If Wikipedia proclaims Lexington-Concord as "the first battle", doesn't comprehensive scholarship require notation that the US Senate has proclaimed Point Pleasant.</p>
<p>As quick, top-of-my-head background, to regarding Lexington-Concord as "one of the first battles", I will simply note that Lexington-Concord was without strategic significance. Lexington-Concord was essentially a defensive effort to perserve the fruits or prior offensive military action against British. After all, the British expedition to Concord was seeking to recover arms and powder taken by force of arms from British Army blockhouse in New Hampshire; and to avenge British casualties in the block house battle; and to assert British military dominion over rebel-held New England countryside: the rebels having driven British civil authority from the countryside into Boston. In this regard is seems that Lexington-Concord was secondary to other New England battles.</p>
<p>Moreover, where Lexington-Concord is without stratetic effect, Point Pleasant determined the strategic direction of the American Revolutionary War.</p>
<p>First, Virginia victory foiled British attempt to destroy military capacity of Virginia militia. The victory enabled Virginia to expell British by force of arms by end of 1775. Absent British expulsion from Virginia, would George Washington have abandoned his beloved Mt. Vernon to British occupation? With George Washington in Virginia defending his beloved Mt. Vernon, who would have commanded the Continental Army? Probably, someone from New England.</p>
<p>Second, expulsion of British from Virginia forced Britain into a dual theater war: North and South.</p>
<p>Third, Pt. Pleasant victory preserved peace on the frontier, depriving British of Indian allies necessary to create a third, Western theater of war.</p>
<p>Fourth, Pt. Pleasant victory obviated the Quebec Act. The Quebec Act had extended the Canadian Border south to the Ohio River, superceding Virginia sovereinty over present-day Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan and the entire US Northwest and US North Central. Absent Pt. Pleasant Victory, Canadian border will still extend to the Ohio River.</p>
<p>Also recall that Lord Dunmore had served King George as Royal Governor of New York. As Royal Governor of New York, Lord Dunmore had maintained public support for the King. When Virginia began tipping into rebellion, King George moved Lord Dunmore to Virginia to preserve Virginia for the British Crown.</p>
<p>Lord Dunmore had directed the Virgnia militia to encamp within the triangular convluence of two great rivers. With the Virginia militia so encamped, the militia had no opportunity for retreat if attacked from the open rear, toward the rivers. With destruction of the Virginia militia, Lord Dunmore would have accomplished his mission of preserving Virginia for the Empire.</p>
<p>Lord Dunmore had promised to lead the British Army to Point Pleasant to join with the colonial militia into an expeditionary attack into what was now Canada. After King George had taken the northern Ohio valley from Virginia, why would his loyal governor attack into Canada to preserve the northern Ohio valley from Virginia. Does this make any sense?</p>
<p>Lord Dunmore took led the British Army from Alexandria toward Point Pleasant via For Pitt (Pittsburg). At Fort Pitt, Lord Dunmore had arranged a peace conference with the Iroquois Confederation. At this conference Lord Dunmore promised to keep Virginians from the Canadian Ohio Valley, if only the Indians could destroy the Virginia Militia.</p>
<p>Lord Dunmore had promised to meet the Virginia militia at Point Pleasant on October 1. His army traveled down the Ohio River toward Point Pleasant, but he stopped the British Army six miles short. On October 9, Chief Blue Jacket, was observed in the British encampment. Blue Chief was principal deputy to Chief Cornstalk, commander of the Iroquios (principally Shawnee) forces.</p>
<p>During the night of October 9-10 Samuel Crowley (Croley) and James Crowley (Cawley), father-son longhunters serving as scouts for Virginia militia, observed Shawnee crossing the Ohio, noth of Point Pleasant, in front of the British encampment. Father Samuel was killed protecting son James's escape to warn the militia.</p>
<p>At dawn October 10, Shawnee attacked into the "V" intending to slaughter the sleeping colonials, or drive them into the rivers, where the colonials would become easy targets for younger bowmen stationed on the opposing river banks. The forwarned colonials met the assault.</p>
<p>The hotly-contested, close battle continued through the day. With the Indians and the Virginian intensly engaged, the British Army slowly closed the six miles between their emcampment and the battle. In late afternoon, the Virginians flanked the Shawnee. The Shawnee began to retreat. As the Shawnee retreated, the British approached in battle formation. The British allowed the retreating Shawnee passage through their lines. The British Army battle line continued toward the exhaused Virginians. The Virginians re-grouped to receive the British assault.</p>
<p>Then two companies of Virginia militia appeared behind the British. These two companies were late to the Point Pleasant assembly. They had traveled overland 16 miles toward the sound ot gunfire.</p>
<p>When Lord Dunmore saw that his army was sandwiched betwwen colonial lines, hiw battle line halted. It was late afternoon in October. Lord Dunmore sent an emmisary to the Virginians offering his assistance. Fighting ceased.</p>
<p>Over the next few days, Shawnee Chiefs took refuge within British Forts. To preserve their treachery, British murdered the Shawnee Chiefs.</p>
<p>In evaluating this battle, many historians limit their research to Lord Dunmore's battle report. Lord Dunmore's battle report was limited to the battle. His battle report did not encompass his prior peace conference and agreement with the Iroquis.</p>
<p>After Virginians expelled Lord Dunmore by force of arms, King George gave Lord Dunmore another, more stable governorship.</p>
<p>Also consider the political context of the battle of Point Pleasant. During the summer of 1774, in a meeting chaired by George Washington and attended by James Madison, Virginia had adopted the Fairfax Resolves, precursor to the American Declaration of Independence.</p>
<p>Proclaimation of Lexington-Concord as "the first battle" seems a very narrow view, with too much deference to Longfellow and Walt Disney.</p>

You're right that the course of history was dramatically changed by the battle of Point Pleasant with huge strategic consequences for the upcoming revolution. But it was the last American Colonial battle. Not the first battle of the revolution. Simply put, the British Army and Virginians were on the same side, fighting against a common foe. Maybe some historians consider this the first battle of the revolution and they certainly received congressional support a hundred years ago. But some scientists think that human activity has nothing to do with global warming and they receive political support all the time too. I think most people reasonably expect encyclopedias to call something a battle when the two opposing sides actually fight one other. That's not a Walt Disney version of history. Very often, a simple view when it comes to labels actually does reflect reality.

<p>A few months ago, the battle result in the battlebox was listed as "Indecisive." I changed this to "Indecisive in terms of territory gained/lost. Defeat of British military objectives." Someone else has changed this recently to "American victory. British defeat." 1775 has changed a lot in the last few months.</p>
<p>I'm considering reverting to "Indecisive in terms of territory gained/lost. Defeat of British military objectives," but I'm looking for opinions. Here's mine:</p>
<p>The British Army won at Lexington. The Americans won at Old North Bridge, but the British managed to follow all of Gage's orders in Concord and complete the specific mission of the expedition. However, their mission didn't accomplish much because the Americans had good intelligence. And the overall British objective of preventing rebellion failed miserably. The Return March has been called a retreat because the soldiers were coming back under heavy fire, but they really were engaging in a planned return to their base. They just hadn't planned on doing that under heavy fire. The British won the last large engagement of the day at Watson's Corner.</p>
<p>Before the day began, the British Army was just in Boston and after the day was over, they were still just in Boston, so I don't see how this could be considered a victory for anyone unless it's thought of as the beginning of a war of attrition where casualties are everything instead of a war for territory. The Americans won in terms of casualties, but I don't think that matters much. This is just about semantics, but semantics are important. I don't believe the Massachusetts militia thought of themselves as a force representing "America" at that time, so how could this be an American victory?</p>
<p>Encarta calls this battle "a strong American victory," so there's support for that view, but I think that's too simple. What do you think? <a href="../../../f/l/y/User%7EFlying_Jazz_a2b8.html" title="User:Flying Jazz">Flying Jazz</a> 17:48, 18 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I would say that it was a defeat for the British. I would say the action at Lexington was a skirmish and pretty much everything from that point was fairly hellish for the British soldiers. They retreated all the way back to Boston whilst coming under constant attack from the rebels. The rebels aim was to start a war and inflict a defeat on the British, they achieved both. The next day the British awoke to find 10000 Rebels outside the city, they were hemmed in and remained that way. I am interested in the Revolutionary War from a British perspective and from where I'm standing Concord&amp;Lexington sure looks like a defeat to me.</p>

<dd>I wrote most of this article during <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Battles_of_Lexington_and_Concord&amp;diff=14113212&amp;oldid=13369896" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Battles_of_Lexington_and_Concord&amp;diff=14113212&amp;oldid=13369896" rel="nofollow">this time period</a> about a year ago. Before my edits, the article contained lies from a British source such as "The British drove most of the Minutemen from their towns." That pissed me off, so I wrote this factual version which looks neutral to me. I based the article on a great book: "Paul Revere's Ride" by David Hackett Fischer. Fischer's number of 900 in Smith's force included both British soldiers and British marines. Published estimates of 700 may have only included the army. Fischer's book is a good read and also very scholarly with ample references. He backs up his numbers. <b>Fischer and I are both Americans and we both live near sites of the battle.</b> Please stop making assumptions about the backgrounds of the editors here and assumptions about who can and cannot write something neutral, and please talk about specific items in the article itself. One thing I noticed about the current article version is that the portraits are all of the British participants, and the American participants are all represented by statues (less life-like, more cold). This may give the visual appearance of bias. I'll be adding portraits of Revere, Heath, and maybe Warren to correct that. Of course, citizens from any nation should make any edits needed to improve this article's neutrality, but I still hope someone who thinks the current article isn't neutral can come up with a single example to back up their opinion. This battle is so entrenched in the psyche of many Americans that an NPOV article about the facts may appear biased towards the British side to many American readers. <a href="../../../f/l/y/User%7EFlying_Jazz_a2b8.html" title="User:Flying Jazz">Flying Jazz</a> 02:01, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I would suggest that to some readers an even handed approach to both sides can be seen as bias from American eyes as many Americans have had a distorted narrative presented to them over the years. Then when seeing something that doesnt tally with what is perceived to be the truth they feel it is biased against the Americans.</p>
<p>Also the Concord history is wrong a battle actually occured, not just observation. Sorry got no time to fix.</p>

<p>A few things I noticed, the number 900 is subject to question. The National Park Service, along with a large number of scholarly authors give the number of 700 to 800 at most. This number between 700 and 800 is more logical, because if one studies the muster rolls of the regiments stationed in Boston on April 18, 1775 one would see that by taking each company of light infantry and genadiers the highest number that could possibly be reached was around 800 to 850. Taking into account that some soldiers were on leave for illness, the most Lt. Col. Smith could have taken is 800. It can also be noted, that the times in the article are off as well. Smith called his officers to the Province House, at 8pm to inform them. At 9pm Smith and Pitcairn both had return to their quarters to be ready, and the orders for the had been written in advance and already sent off to the adjuant of each regiment, because the troops were woke up at 9pm and told to be assemblied on the far end of Boston Common by 10pm. The location that the soldiers left from in their boats to Phipps Farm is in about the middle of St. Charles St. in Boston, between the common and public gardens. The timing is important, because upon orders from the Province House, all town folks out between 9pm and dawn were detianed by sentries, in a hope that the Patriots would not be able to pass the word of the movement along. We of course know this failed because of Paul Revere, and William Dawes. The troops departed Phipps Farm where they landed at 2am. At 4am word was sent back to Boston that the countryside was alarmed, and they reinforcements were needed. It was only at this point that Smith divded the troops in half, sending the light infantry head with Pitcairn, and keeping the grenadiers with himself. The actual skirmish occured between 5am and 6:30 am. According the the re-enactment held on Lexington Green each year, old belfry is rung at 5:30am and the re-enactment occurs at 6am. This is followed by the arrival of the British in Concord at 7:30am and the skirmish at North Bridge occuring at 8:30am. At 9am in Boston Lord Percy along with the 1st Brigade, leave for Lexington over the Boston Neck. The delay in movement is because when word first arrives at the Province House from Smith, new orders needed to be written off for each regiment. The orders were sent to the adjuant of the 1st Brigade. Lord Percy was told to have his men under arms at 5am, but at they were not actually assemblied until 7:30. The delay was with the Marine Battalion. A officer at Province House forgot that Pitcairn the marine commander was off with Smith's party and sent the orders to his house in North Sq. next the home of Paul Revere. It was not until 6:30 that new orders were sent to the adjuant of the marine battalion and they too were assemblied. At 7:30 the 1000 man relief column was ready, but their was a dispute as to whether food and extra powder should be provided. The troops were give the food and powder, and the brigade set off to the tune of "Yankee Doodle Dandy" at 9am. It should be noted the 1000 men were only the line companies of the regiments of the 1st brigade, because all of the light infantry and grenadiers were already with Smith. The total force to return to Boston, some time around 7:30 pm that evening over the Charlestown neck was 1800. (Historybuff483s) July 4, 2006 @ 13:43</p>

<p>You are right that if one takes the muster rolls for each company of light infantry and grenadiers the highest number that could possibly be reached was around 800 to 850. However, this company-by-company data is absent for the marine battalian until 1777. If one assumes that marine grenadiers and light infantry companies were about the same size as the army's then one gets an estimate closer to 800. But there are two pieces of evidence arguing for a larger number:</p>
<dl>
<dd>1) The size of the total marine battalian in Boston on April 1, 1775 was 122% of the mean army regiments.</dd>
<dd>2) The same marine battalian as of 1777 (when roster numbers are available) had grenadier+light infantry companies that were 194% of the size of the mean grenadier+light infantry companies in the army as of April 1775.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Fisher (1994) uses these two facts to estimate Smith's total Concord expedition at between 841 and 909 men (hence roughly 900 is better than roughly 800). From January to June of that year, attrition due to non-combat losses in all ranks was only 1.9% and a special effort was made to transfer men from the line companies into the grenadiers and light infantry to keep those companies at full strength. Fischer's book came out over 10 years ago, and I'm not familiar with how well-accepted his numbers are in recent articles about the subject. <a href="../../../f/l/y/User%7EFlying_Jazz_a2b8.html" title="User:Flying Jazz">Flying Jazz</a> 01:58, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>British are woken up (9 pm, not 10) and assemble (10 pm, not 11): Good catch. I should have checked these out before reverting you. My apologies. Smith divides troops/sends word to Boston:According the Fischer, these two events didn't happen at the same time, but it does seem unlikely that they were separated by an hour. First, Smith ordered Pitcairn ahead with the light infantry, and then he "halted the grenadiers, and ordered an aide to ride back to Boston..." at around 4 AM. Lexington: Many eyewitnesses on both sides testified that the regulars arrived at Lexington Green at sunrise. That's 4:57 Eastern Standard time and 5:22 apparent local standard time (Fischer) Arrival at Concord: Fischer takes a look at a lot of sources and computes distances and foot speed to estimate this at 9 am, not 7:30 am as you write above. Fight at North Bridge: Couldn't be at 8:30. Probably closer to 10. Return over Charlestown Neck: Many sources say this occured at sunset. That's 6:30 pm Eastern Standard time and 6:55 pm apparent local standard time. 7:30 pm would be daylight savings time. <a href="../../../f/l/y/User%7EFlying_Jazz_a2b8.html" title="User:Flying Jazz">Flying Jazz</a> 01:58, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've read in several places the claim that the command from Maj. Pitcairn was to "law down your arms in the name of George the Soverign King of England" and that the response from a Jonas Clarke was that "We recognize no Soverign but God and no King but Jesus". I'm not sure if this is apocryphal; but I notice that, either way, it's not mentioned in this article. Does anyone know if this is story true? And, if it is, shouldn't it be added? <a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELordjeff06_d69d.html" title="User:Lordjeff06">Lordjeff06</a> 19:41, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Before my most recent edit, this page stated that the Battles of Lexington &amp; Concord were the second engagement of the American Revolutionary War, after the storming of Fort William and Mary. After doing some research on the storming of the fort and the events that followed immediately thereafter, I have decided to remove this statement. While the storming of the fort is no doubt a significant event in New Hampshire history, and represents an act of colonial defiance against the Crown, to state that it was the beginning of the American Revolution is not NPOV. A series of defiant conflagrations (including the Boston Massacre and the Tea Party, along with the storming of the Fort) represent a lead-up to the Revolution, but the vast preponderance of historians agree that Lexington &amp; Concord led directly to the outbreak of the armed conflict. The <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Revolutionary_War_48ec.html" title="American Revolutionary War">American Revolutionary War</a> article unequivocally states the same: "with the Battles of Lexington and Concord, the war had begun." The opening paragraph of this article agrees that "The battles marked the outbreak of open armed conflict between Great Britain and its thirteen colonies in the mainland of British North America." Absent some serious historical rebuttal, beyond that offered by New Hampshire partisans, these battles must be recognized as the beginning of the Revolution. <a href="../../../v/e/n/User%7EVenicemenace_b4a4.html" title="User:Venicemenace">Venicemenace</a> 04:31, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I am doing a project for school on the battles of lexington and concord. The project is do in January and I have to have 50 facts. Does anyone know any other sites on the subject? How do the people of time know everything about history? WHen did someone take the time to go and look at the specific dates and times of every single little thing wasn't it confusing?</p>
<dl>
<dd>I hope you check out a book from the library for your project instead of using internet sites. Some good books are listed <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battles_of_Lexington_and_Concord_977e.html#References" title="Battles of Lexington and Concord">here</a>. I like Fischer's book best. Historians of today learn about history from <a href="../../../p/r/i/Primary_source.html" title="Primary source">primary sources</a>. Those sources usually agree about dates and important people, but times and details about every little thing can be different and then it can get very confusing, like the discussion above about <a href="../../../b/a/t/Talk%7EBattles_of_Lexington_and_Concord_2679.html#Numbers_and_times" title="Talk:Battles of Lexington and Concord">numbers and times</a>. Taking the time to try to find out what really happened is what historians do but they can still disagree. One historian can say one thing happened using one primary source and another historian can disagree because they like a different primary source better. But finding 50 good facts should be easy with a book about the battle. <a href="../../../f/l/y/User%7EFlying_Jazz_a2b8.html" title="User:Flying Jazz">Flying Jazz</a> 01:04, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I couldn't agree more with Flying Jazz: "Paul Revere's Ride" by David Hackett Fischer is *the* go-to book for this little slice of history. <a href="../../../v/e/n/User%7EVenicemenace_b4a4.html" title="User:Venicemenace">Venicemenace</a> 01:58, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have today uploaded new versions of two images in the article, from not the NY Public Library digital archive but from a Colonial Williamsburg site, much better resolution. I will do two more later. --Dumarest 20:07, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
