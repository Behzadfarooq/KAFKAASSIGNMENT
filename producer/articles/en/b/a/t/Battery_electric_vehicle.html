<p>A <b>battery electric vehicle</b> (BEV) is an <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electric_vehicle.html" title="Electric vehicle">electric vehicle</a> that utilizes chemical <a href="../../../e/n/e/Energy.html" title="Energy">energy</a> stored in <a href="../../../r/e/c/Rechargeable_battery.html" title="Rechargeable battery">rechargeable battery</a> <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battery_pack.html" title="Battery pack">packs</a>. Electric vehicles use <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electric_motor.html" title="Electric motor">electric motors</a> instead of, or in addition to, <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internal_combustion_engine.html" title="Internal combustion engine">internal combustion engines</a> (ICEs). Vehicles using both, electric motors and ICEs, are examples of a <a href="../../../h/y/b/Hybrid_vehicle.html" title="Hybrid vehicle">hybrid vehicles</a>, and are usually not considered pure BEVs. Hybrid vehicles with batteries that can be charged and used without their ICE are called <a href="../../../p/l/u/Plug-in_hybrid_electric_vehicle.html" title="Plug-in hybrid electric vehicle">plug-in hybrid electric vehicles</a>, and are pure BEVs while they are not burning fuel. BEVs are usually <a href="../../../a/u/t/Automobile.html" title="Automobile">automobiles</a>, <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truck.html#Light_trucks" title="Truck">light trucks</a>, <a href="../../../m/o/t/Motorized_bicycle.html#Electric" title="Motorized bicycle">motorized bicycles</a>, <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electric_scooter.html" title="Electric scooter">electric scooters</a>, <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golf_cart.html" title="Golf cart">golf carts</a>, <a href="../../../f/o/r/Forklift_truck.html" title="Forklift truck">forklifts</a> and similar vehicles, because batteries are less appropriate for larger long-range applications.</p>
<p>BEVs were among the earliest automobiles, and are more <a href="../../../e/n/e/Energy_efficiency.html" title="Energy efficiency">energy-efficient</a> than all internal combustion vehicles. BEVs produce no exhaust fumes, and minimal pollution if charged from most forms of <a href="../../../r/e/n/Renewable_energy.html" title="Renewable energy">renewable energy</a>. Many are capable of <a href="../../../a/c/c/Acceleration.html" title="Acceleration">acceleration</a> exceeding that of conventional <a href="../../../g/a/s/Gasoline.html" title="Gasoline">gasoline</a> powered vehicles.

<p>Ongoing battery technology advancements have addressed many problems with high costs, limited travel distance between battery recharging, charging time, and battery lifespan. Those drawbacks have historically been blamed for the limited adoption of the BEV. Toyota, Honda, Ford and General Motors all produced BEVs in the 90s, but with minor exceptions those models were withdrawn from the market and destroyed by their manufacturers. A handful of future production models have been announced, although many more have been prototyped. The major US automobile manufacturers have been accused of deliberately <a href="../../../s/a/b/Sabotage.html" title="Sabotage">sabotaging</a> their electric vehicle production efforts. <sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>

<p>BEVs were among the earliest automobiles, because electric vehicles <a href="../../../p/r/e/Predate.html" title="Predate">predate</a> gasoline and diesel. Between 1832 and 1839 (the exact year is uncertain), <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scotland.html" title="Scotland">Scottish</a> businessman Robert Anderson invented the first crude electric carriage. Professor Sibrandus Stratingh of Groningen, Netherlands, designed the small-scale electric car, built by his assistant Christopher Becker in 1835.</p>
<p>The improvement of the storage battery, by Frenchmen <a href="../../../g/a/s/Gaston_Plante_3255.html" title="Gaston Plante">Gaston Plante</a> in 1865 and by Camille Faure in 1881, paved the way for electric vehicles to flourish. France and Great Britain were the first nations to support the widespread development of electric vehicles.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Just prior to 1900, before the pre-eminence of powerful but polluting <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internal_combustion_engines.html" title="Internal combustion engines">internal combustion engines</a>, electric automobiles held many speed and distance records. Among the most notable of these records was the breaking of the 100 km/h (60 mph) speed barrier, by <a href="../../../c/a/m/Camille_Jenatzy_51cf.html" title="Camille Jenatzy">Camille Jenatzy</a> on <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_29.html" title="April 29">April 29</a>, 1899 in his 'rocket-shaped' EV, <a href="../../../j/a/m/Jamais_Contente_df2c.html" title="Jamais Contente">Jamais Contente</a> which reached a top speed of 105.88 km/h (65.79 mph).</p>
<p>BEVs, produced by Anthony, <a href="../../../b/a/k/Baker_Motor_Vehicle_b382.html" title="Baker Motor Vehicle">Baker</a>, <a href="../../../d/e/t/Detroit_Electric_c041.html" title="Detroit Electric">Detroit</a>, <a href="../../../e/d/i/Edison.html" title="Edison">Edison</a>, <a href="../../../s/t/u/Studebaker.html" title="Studebaker">Studebaker</a>, and others during the early 20th Century for a time out-sold gasoline-powered vehicles. Due to technological limitations and the lack of <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transistor.html" title="Transistor">transistor</a>-based electric technology, the top speed of these early production electric vehicles was limited to about 32 km/h (20 mph). These vehicles were successfully sold as <a href="../../../t/o/w/Town_car.html" title="Town car">town cars</a> to upper-class customers and were often marketed as suitable vehicles for women drivers due to their clean, quiet and easy operation. Electrics did not require hand cranking to start, and a backfire during hand-cranking could break the owners arm.</p>

<p>The introduction of the <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electric_starter.html" title="Electric starter">electric starter</a> by <a href="../../../c/a/d/Cadillac_%28automobile%29.html" title="Cadillac (automobile)">Cadillac</a> in 1913 simplified the task of starting the internal combustion engine, formerly difficult and sometimes dangerous. This innovation contributed to the downfall of the electric vehicle, as did the mass-produced and relatively inexpensive <a href="../../../f/o/r/Ford_Model-T_64d0.html" title="Ford Model-T">Ford Model-T</a>, which had been produced for four years, since 1908.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup> Internal-combustion vehicles advanced technologically, ultimately becoming more practical than -- and out-performing -- their electric-powered competitors.</p>
<p>Another blow to BEVs was the loss of <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Edison_ebd8.html" title="Thomas Edison">Edison's</a> <a href="../../../d/i/r/Direct_current.html" title="Direct current">direct current</a> electric power transmission system in the <i><a href="../../../w/a/r/War_of_Currents_5310.html" title="War of Currents">War of Currents</a></i>. This deprived the BEV of the source of DC current necessary to recharge their batteries. As the technology of <a href="../../../r/e/c/Rectifier.html" title="Rectifier">rectifiers</a> was still in its infancy, producing DC current locally was infeasible.</p>
<p>By the late 1930s, the electric automobile industry had completely disappeared, with battery-electric traction being limited to niche applications, such as certain industrial vehicles.</p>
<p>The 1947 invention of the point-contact <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transistor.html" title="Transistor">transistor</a> marked the beginning of a new era for BEV technology. Within a decade, Henney Coachworks had joined forces with National Union Electric Company, the makers of Exide batteries, to produce the first modern electric car based on transistor technology, the <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henney_Kilowatt_bb10.html" title="Henney Kilowatt">Henney Kilowatt</a>, produced in 36-volt and 72-volt configurations. The 72-volt models had a top speed approaching 96 km/h (60 mph) and could travel nearly an hour on a single charge. Despite the improved practicality of the Henney Kilowatt over previous electric cars, it was too expensive, and production was terminated in 1961. Even though the Henney Kilowatt never reached mass production volume, their transistor-based electric technology paved the way for modern EVs.</p>
<p>Battery electric vehicles became popular for some limited range applications. Forklifts were BEVs when they were introduced in 1923 by Yale<a href="http://www.yale.com/ygl_history.asp?language=ENGLISH" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.yale.com/ygl_history.asp?language=ENGLISH" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> and some battery electric fork lifts are still produced. Golf carts have been BEV since their introduction including early models by Lektra in 1954.<a href="http://www.lektro.com/about_history.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.lektro.com/about_history.asp" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> Their popularity led to their use as <a href="../../../n/e/i/Neighborhood_electric_vehicle.html" title="Neighborhood electric vehicle">neighborhood electric vehicles</a> and expanded versions became available which were partially "street legal".</p>
<p>As of July, 2006, there are between 60,000 and 76,000 low-speed, battery powered vehicles in use in the US, up from about 56,000 in 2004 according to Electric Drive Transportation Association estimates.<sup id="_ref-wsj_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-wsj" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>

<p>BEVs have become much less common than <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internal_combustion_engine.html" title="Internal combustion engine">internal combustion</a> vehicles. Therefore, it is often helpful to consider many aspects of BEVs in comparison to <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internal_combustion_engine.html" title="Internal combustion engine">ICE</a> vehicles.</p>
<p><a name="Cost" id="Cost"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/t/Battery_electric_vehicle.html" title="Edit section: Cost">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Cost</span></h3>
<p>Electric vehicles typically cost between two and four cents per mile to operate, while gasoline-powered ICE vehicles currently cost about four to six times as much.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>The total cost of ownership for modern BEVs depends primarily on the <a href="#Batteries" title="">cost of the batteries</a>, the type and capacity of which determine several factors such as travel range, top speed, battery lifetime and recharging time; several trade-offs exist.</p>
<p><b>Ownership costs</b></p>
<p>Ownership costs for battery electric cars are higher than for their petrol or diesel equivalents, primarily because their purchase price is higher to begin with. Typically for a new car, or a small van, the price is increased by up to 80%. Very often the batteries are not included within the purchase price because they are also expensive. Instead they are often leased for £60-£70 ($116-$135) a month. If the battery is purchased outright, the owner will also be required to replace it every 3 to 5 years, depending on the battery type.</p>
<p>In the UK other changes in ownership costs include vehicle excise duty or road tax. Electric vehicles are now exempt and so BEV owners will save around £100 per year compared with an average conventional car. There remains some uncertainty about annual depreciation rates and resale values for BEVs due to the unknown length of battery-life and the low demand for battery electrics compared to other green car types. As BEVs lose their value faster than conventional cars depreciation rates are likely to be higher than for a conventional car at this time.</p>
<p>In the UK, BEV users who install additional recharging equipment will face additional financial penalties. Costs per standard charge point are around £500-£2000, depending on the difficulty of installation. Fully installed fast-chargers will cost between £10,000 and £30,000 per point although this depends on whether an on-board or off-board fast-charging system is used.</p>
<p><b>Running costs</b></p>
<p>Some running costs are significantly less for BEVs than for conventional cars. In particular, fuel costs are very low due to the competitive price of electricity - fuel duty is zero-rated - and to the high efficiency of the vehicles themselves. Taking into account the high fuel economy of battery electric cars, the fuel costs can be as low as 1.0-2.5p per mile (depending on the tariff). For a typical annual mileage of around 10,000 miles per year, switching from a conventional car to a battery electric could save you around £800 in fuel costs. However if the battery hire is considered a running cost, then the saving on fuel is cancelled out by the monthly battery leasing cost.</p>

<p>When comparisons of the total, <i>well-to-wheel</i> energy cycle are made, the relative efficiency of BEVs drops. Generating electricity and providing liquid fuels for vehicles are thus almost entirely separate wings of the energy economy, with different inefficiencies and environmental harms. When considering only the driving cycle (ie, not the charging and elecricity production, a 55 % to 99.9 % improvement in CO2 emissions takes place when driving an EV over an <a href="../../../i/c/e/ICE_22fb.html" title="ICE">ICE</a> (gasoline, diesel) vehicle <sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[8]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Relatively few of today's BEVs are capable of <a href="../../../a/c/c/Acceleration.html" title="Acceleration">acceleration</a> performance which exceeds that of equivalent-class conventional gasoline powered vehicles. An early solution was <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Motors_9063.html" title="American Motors">American Motors</a>’ experimental <a href="../../../a/m/i/Amitron.html" title="Amitron">Amitron</a> piggyback system of batteries with one type designed for sustained speeds while a different set boosted acceleration when needed.</p>
<p>Electric vehicles can utilize a direct motor-to-wheel configuration which increases the amount of available <a href="../../../p/o/w/Power_%28physics%29.html" title="Power (physics)">power</a>. Having multiple motors connected directly to the wheels allows for each of the wheels to be used for both propulsion and as braking systems, thereby increasing <a href="../../../t/r/a/Traction.html" title="Traction">traction</a>. In some cases, the motor can be housed directly in the wheel, such as in the <a href="../../../w/h/i/Whispering_Wheel_a5c0.html" title="Whispering Wheel">Whispering Wheel</a> design, which lowers the vehicle's <a href="../../../c/e/n/Center_of_gravity.html" title="Center of gravity">center of gravity</a> and reduces the number of moving parts. When not fitted with an <a href="../../../a/x/l/Axle.html" title="Axle">axle</a>, <a href="../../../d/i/f/Differential_%28mechanics%29.html" title="Differential (mechanics)">differential</a>, or <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transmission_%28mechanics%29.html" title="Transmission (mechanics)">transmission</a>, electric vehicles have less drivetrain rotational inertia. A gearless or single gear design in some BEVs eliminates the need for gear shifting, giving such vehicles both smoother acceleration and braking. Because the power output of an electric motor is a function of current, not rotational speed, electric vehicles can use their peak power at all speeds during acceleration; internal combustion engines can only use their peak power at high RPM.</p>
<p>For example, the <a href="../../../v/e/n/Venturi_Fetish_36f6.html" title="Venturi Fetish">Venturi Fetish</a> delivers <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supercar.html" title="Supercar">supercar</a> acceleration despite a relatively modest 300 <a href="../../../h/o/r/Horsepower.html" title="Horsepower">horsepower</a>, and a top speed of around 100 miles per hour. Some <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electric_motor.html#DC_motors" title="Electric motor">DC motor</a>-equipped drag racer BEVs, have simple two-speed transmissions to improve top speed.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[10]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[11]</a></sup> Larger vehicles, such as electric trains and land speed record vehicles, overcome this speed barrier by dramatically increasing the <a href="../../../w/a/t/Watt.html" title="Watt">wattage</a> of their power system.</p>

<p>BEVs most commonly charge from the <a href="../../../p/o/w/Power_grid.html" title="Power grid">power grid</a> (at home or using a street or shop <a href="../../../r/e/c/Recharging_point.html" title="Recharging point">recharging point</a>), which is in turn generated from a variety of domestic resources; such as <a href="../../../f/o/s/Fossil_fuel_power_plant.html" title="Fossil fuel power plant">coal</a>, <a href="../../../h/y/d/Hydroelectricity.html" title="Hydroelectricity">hydroelectricity</a>, <a href="../../../n/u/c/Nuclear_power.html" title="Nuclear power">nuclear</a> and others. Home power such as roof top <a href="../../../p/h/o/Photovoltaic.html" title="Photovoltaic">photovoltaic</a> solar cell panels, <a href="../../../m/i/c/Micro_hydro.html" title="Micro hydro">microhydro</a> or <a href="../../../w/i/n/Wind_power.html" title="Wind power">wind</a> may also be used. Electricity can also be supplied with a portable fueled generator. Although not strictly a BEV, the <a href="../../../f/o/r/Ford_Reflex_f7d4.html" title="Ford Reflex">Ford Reflex</a> concept car incorporates <a href="../../../p/h/o/Photovoltaics.html" title="Photovoltaics">photovoltaics</a> into its exterior to help provide power to its lights, slightly reducing drain on its hybrid powertrain.</p>
<p>Charging time is limited primarily by the capacity of the <a href="../../../g/r/i/Grid.html" title="Grid">grid</a> connection. A normal <a href="../../../h/o/u/Household.html" title="Household">household</a> <a href="../../../o/u/t/Outlet.html" title="Outlet">outlet</a> is between 1.5 <a href="../../../k/i/l/Kilowatt.html" title="Kilowatt">kilowatts</a> (in the US, Canada, Japan, and other countries with 110 Volt supply) to 3 kilowatts (in countries with 240 <a href="../../../v/_/_/V.html" title="V">V</a> supply). The main connection to a house might be able to sustain 10 kilowatts, and special wiring can be installed to use this. At this higher power level charging even a small, 7 kilowatt-hour (14–28 mi) pack, would probably require one hour. This is small compared to the effective power delivery rate of an average <a href="../../../p/e/t/Petrol.html" title="Petrol">petrol</a> <a href="../../../p/u/m/Pump.html" title="Pump">pump</a>, about 5,000 kilowatts. Even if the supply power can be increased, most batteries do not accept charge at greater than their charge rate ("C1".)</p>
<p>In 1995, some charging stations charged BEVs in one hour. In November 1997, Ford purchased a fast-charge system produced by <a href="../../../a/e/r/AeroVironment_b7e2.html" title="AeroVironment">AeroVironment</a> called "PosiCharge" for testing its fleets of <a href="../../../f/o/r/Ford_Ranger_EV_f5d6.html" title="Ford Ranger EV">Ranger EVs</a>, which charged their lead-acid batteries in between six and fifteen minutes. In February 1998, General Motors announced a version of its "Magne Charge" system which could recharge <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nickel_metal_hydride_battery.html" title="Nickel metal hydride battery">NiMH</a> batteries in about ten minutes, providing a range of sixty to one hundred miles.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 2005, <a href="../../../h/a/n/Handheld.html" title="Handheld">handheld</a> device battery designs by <a href="../../../t/o/s/Toshiba.html" title="Toshiba">Toshiba</a> were claimed to be able to accept an 80% charge in as little as 60 seconds.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[13]</a></sup> Scaling this <a href="../../../s/p/e/Specific_power.html" title="Specific power">specific power</a> characteristic up to the same 7 kilowatt-hour EV pack would result in the need for a peak of 336 kilowatts of power from some source for those 60 seconds. It is not clear that such batteries will work directly in BEVs as heat build-up may make them unsafe.</p>
<p>In 2007, <a href="../../../a/l/t/Altairnano.html" title="Altairnano">Altairnano</a>'s <a href="../../../n/a/n/NanoSafe_9565.html" title="NanoSafe">NanoSafe</a> batteries are rechargeable in a few minutes, versus hours required for other rechargeable batteries. A NanoSafe cell can be charged to over 80% charge capacity in about one minute.</p>
<p>Most people do not always require fast recharging because they have enough time, six to eight hours, during the work day or overnight to recharge. As the charging does not require attention it takes a few seconds for an owner to <a href="../../../p/l/u/Plug.html" title="Plug">plug</a> in and unplug their vehicle. Many BEV drivers prefer refueling at home, avoiding the inconvenience of visiting a <a href="../../../f/u/e/Fuel_station.html" title="Fuel station">fuel station</a>.

<p>The charging power can be connected to the car in two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first is a direct electrical connection known as <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conductive_coupling.html" title="Conductive coupling">conductive coupling</a>. This might be as simple as a <a href="../../../m/a/i/Mains.html" title="Mains">mains</a> lead into a weatherproof <a href="../../../s/o/c/Socket.html" title="Socket">socket</a> through special high capacity cables with connectors to protect the user from <a href="../../../h/i/g/High_voltage.html" title="High voltage">high voltages</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The second approach is known as <a href="../../../i/n/d/Inductive_coupling.html" title="Inductive coupling">inductive coupling</a>. A special '<a href="../../../p/a/d/Paddle.html" title="Paddle">paddle</a>' is inserted into a <a href="../../../s/l/o/Slot.html" title="Slot">slot</a> on the car. The paddle is one winding of a <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transformer.html" title="Transformer">transformer</a>, while the other is built into the car. When the paddle is inserted it completes a magnetic circuit which provides power to the battery pack.</li>
</ul>
<p>The major advantage of the inductive approach is that there is no possibility of <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electric_shock.html" title="Electric shock">electrocution</a> as there are no exposed conductors, although interlocks can make conductive coupling nearly as safe. Conductive coupling equipment is lower in cost and much more efficient due to a vastly lower component count.</p>

<p>Discharged modular electric car batteries could be automatically replaced by charged ones in fuel stations, car shops, general shops or as part of the automatic roadway system. This would require some <a href="../../../s/t/a/Standardization.html" title="Standardization">standardization</a> of the battery and associated components. By supplying energy in energy packets along the path the depth of discharge can be greatly reduced increasing battery life and the size and weight of the battery pack is reduced. Instead of attempting to carry an entire day's charge you only need tiny sips of energy. Battery packs that have limited charge cycles would be exchanged several times in one trip and the energy supplier, most likely the power company, would maintain the battery pack and charge for electrical energy supplied. The battery would be analogous to the power transformer on the power pole behind a house that supplies the neighborhood. The transformer does not show up on the bill as a line item but the kilowatt-hours used are charged at a rate that amortizes the delivery system just like the batteries on charge. The power company gains because they can use the excess storage capacity to flatten their daily power demand curve so this storage resource is shared between energy delivery and transportation.</p>

<p>Given suitable infrastructure, BEVs could also be <b>recharged</b> <b>while the user drives</b>. The BEV establishes contact with an electrified rail, plate or overhead wires on the highway via an attached conducting wheel or other similar mechanism (see <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conduit_current_collection.html" title="Conduit current collection">Conduit current collection</a>). The BEV's batteries are recharged by this process - on the highway - and can then be used normally on other roads.</p>
<p>This provides the advantage of <b>virtually unrestricted highway</b> <b>range</b>. Since most destinations are within 100 km of a major highway, this <b>reduces the need for expensive battery systems</b>.</p>

<p>The range of a BEV depends on the number and type of batteries used, and the performance demands of the driver.

<p>Individual batteries are usually arranged into large <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battery_pack.html" title="Battery pack">battery packs</a> of various <a href="../../../v/o/l/Voltage.html" title="Voltage">voltage</a> and <a href="../../../a/m/p/Ampere-hour.html" title="Ampere-hour">ampere-hour</a> capacity products to give the required energy capacity. Battery life should be considered when calculating the extended cost of ownership, as all batteries eventually wear out and must be replaced. The rate at which they expire depends on a number of factors.</p>
<p>The depth of discharge (DOD) is the recommended proportion of the total available energy storage for which that battery will achieve its rated cycles. Deep cycle lead-acid batteries generally should not be discharged below 80% capacity. More modern formulations can survive deeper cycles.</p>
<p>In real world use, some fleet <a href="../../../t/o/y/Toyota_RAV4_EV_4eb0.html" title="Toyota RAV4 EV">Toyota RAV4 EVs</a>, using <a href="../../../n/i/m/NiMH_117f.html" title="NiMH">NiMH</a> batteries, have exceeded 100,000 miles (160,000 km) with little degradation in their daily range.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[15]</a></sup> Quoting that report's concluding assessment:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"The five-vehicle test is demonstrating the long-term durability of Nickel Metal Hydride batteries and electric drive trains. Only slight performance degradation has been observed to-date on four out of five vehicles.... EVTC test data provide strong evidence that all five vehicles will exceed the 100,000-mile mark. SCE’s positive experience points to the very strong likelihood of a 130,000 to 150,000-mile Nickel Metal Hydride battery and drive-train operational life. EVs can therefore match or exceed the lifecycle miles of comparable internal combustion engine vehicles.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>"In June 2003 the 320 RAV4 EVs of the SCE fleet were used primarily by meter readers, service managers, field representatives, service planners and mail handlers, and for security patrols and carpools. In five years of operation, the RAV4 EV fleet had logged more than 6.9 million miles, eliminating about 830 tons of air pollutants, and preventing more than 3,700 tons of tailpipe carbon dioxide emissions. Given the successful operation of its EVs to-date, SCE plans to continue using them well after they all log 100,000-miles."</dd>

<p>Since the late 1980s, electric vehicles have been promoted in the US through the use of tax credits. BEVs are the most common form of what is defined by the <a href="../../../c/a/l/California_Air_Resources_Board_f4d3.html" title="California Air Resources Board">California Air Resources Board</a> (CARB) as <a href="../../../z/e/r/Zero_emission_vehicle.html" title="Zero emission vehicle">zero emission vehicle</a> (ZEV) passenger <a href="../../../a/u/t/Automobile.html" title="Automobile">automobiles</a>, because they produce no emissions while being driven. The CARB had set a minimum quota for the use of ZEVs, but it was withdrawn after complaints by auto manufacturers that it was economically infeasible due to a lack of consumer demand.</p>
<p>The California program was designed by the CARB to reduce air pollution and not specifically to promote electric vehicles. So the zero emissions requirement in California was replaced by a combined requirement of a very small number of ZEVs to promote research and development, and a much larger number of <a href="../../../p/a/r/Partial_zero-emissions_vehicle.html" title="Partial zero-emissions vehicle">partial zero-emissions vehicles</a> (PZEVs), an administrative designation for a <i>super ultra low emissions vehicle</i> (<a href="../../../s/u/l/SULEV_d750.html" title="SULEV">SULEV</a>), which emit about ten percent of the pollution of ordinary low emissions vehicles and are also certified for zero evaporative emissions.</p>

<p>Hobbyists often build their own EVs by <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electric_vehicle_conversion.html" title="Electric vehicle conversion">converting</a> existing production cars to run solely on electricity. There is a <a href="../../../c/o/t/Cottage_industry.html" title="Cottage industry">cottage industry</a> supporting the conversion and construction of BEVs by hobbyists. Universities such as the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_California%2C_Irvine_b2f0.html" title="University of California, Irvine">University of California, Irvine</a> even build their own custom electric or hybrid-electric cars from scratch.</p>
<p>Short-range battery electric vehicles offer the hobbyist comfort, utility, and quickness, sacrificing only range. Short-range BEVs may be built using high-performance lead–acid batteries, using about half the mass needed for a 60 to 80 mile (100 to 130 km) range; the result is a vehicle with about a thirty mile (50 km) range, which when designed with appropriate weight distribution (40/60 front to rear) does not require <a href="../../../p/o/w/Power_steering.html" title="Power steering">power steering</a>, offers exceptional acceleration in the lower end of its operating range, is freeway capable and legal, but are expensive due to the higher cost for these higher-performance batteries. By including a <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manual_transmission.html" title="Manual transmission">manual transmission</a>, short-range BEVs can obtain both better performance and greater efficiency than the single-speed BEVs developed by major manufactures. Unlike the converted golf carts used for <a href="../../../n/e/i/Neighborhood_electric_vehicle.html" title="Neighborhood electric vehicle">neighborhood electric vehicles</a>, short-range BEVs may be operated on typical suburban throughways (40 to 45 MPH or 60 or 70 km/h speed limits are typical) and can keep up with traffic typical on such roads and the short "slow-lane" on-and-off segments of freeways common in suburban areas.</p>
<p>Some drag race such conversions as members of <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Electric_Drag_Racing_Association_a98b.html" title="National Electric Drag Racing Association">National Electric Drag Racing Association</a> (NEDRA). Battery electric vehicles are also very popular in quarter mile (400 meter) racing. The NEDRA regularly holds electric car races and often competes them successfully against exotics such as the <a href="../../../d/o/d/Dodge_Viper_2b78.html" title="Dodge Viper">Dodge Viper</a> or <a href="../../../s/a/l/Saleen_S7_abf9.html" title="Saleen S7">Saleen S7</a>.</p>

<p>The three major US automobile manufacturers, <a href="../../../g/e/n/General_Motors_Corporation_a513.html" title="General Motors Corporation">General Motors</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/r/Chrysler_Corporation_347c.html" title="Chrysler Corporation">Chrysler Corporation</a> and <a href="../../../f/o/r/Ford_Motor_Company_7541.html" title="Ford Motor Company">Ford Motor Company</a> have been accused by a variety of consumer advocates, activists, commentators, journalists, and documentary makers of deliberately <a href="../../../s/a/b/Sabotage.html" title="Sabotage">sabotaging</a> their companies' BEV efforts through several methods: failing to market, failing to produce appropriate vehicles, failing to satisfy demand, and using lease-only programs with prohibitions against end of lease purchase. By these actions they have managed to terminate their BEV development and marketing programs despite operators' offers of purchase and assumption of maintenance liabilities. The Chrysler "golf cart" program has seemed to some as an insult to the marketplace and to government mandates; Chrysler has been accused of intentionally failing to produce a vehicle usable in mixed traffic conditions. Moreover, the three major American motor companies have almost exclusively promoted their electric cars in the American market, where gas has been comparatively cheap, and virtually ignored the European market, where gas is significantly more expensive.</p>
<p>The manufacturers, in their defense, have responded that they only make what the public wants. At the end of their programs GM destroyed its BEV fleet, despite offers to purchase from drivers. Ford's Norwegian-built "Th!nk" fleet was covered by a three-year exemption to the standard US motor vehicle safety laws, after which time Ford had planned to dismantle and recycle its fleet. However, Ford was persuaded by activists to refrain from destroying its fleet and return them to Norway and sell them as used vehicles. Ford also sold a few lead-acid battery <a href="../../../f/o/r/Ford_Ranger_EV_f5d6.html" title="Ford Ranger EV">Ranger EVs</a>, and some fleet purchase Chevrolet S-10 EV pickups are being refurbished and sold on the secondary market.<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Critics have pointed out that General Motors' customer survey highlights the company's efforts to lower demand. GM called interested customers and emphasized negative characteristics disputed by EV1 drivers. CARB removed their zero emission regulations in part because such surveys purported to show that no demand existed for the EV1s.<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Both Honda and Toyota also manufactured BEVs. Honda followed the lead of the other majors and terminated their lease-only programs, completely destroying their fleet and its components by shredding. Toyota offered vehicles for both sale and lease. While Toyota has terminated manufacture of new vehicles, it continues to support those manufactured. A small number of <a href="../../../t/o/y/Toyota_RAV4_EV_4eb0.html" title="Toyota RAV4 EV">Toyota RAV4 EVs</a> are still on the road.</p>
<p>Oil companies have been accused of using patent protection to keep modern battery technology from use in BEVs<a href="http://www.evworld.com/blogs/index.cfm?page=blogentry&amp;authorid=51&amp;blogid=104&amp;archive=1" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.evworld.com/blogs/index.cfm?page=blogentry&amp;authorid=51&amp;blogid=104&amp;archive=1" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/t/Battery_electric_vehicle.html" title="Edit section: Proponents' arguments">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Proponents' arguments</span></h3>
<p>Supporters point out the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>BEVs reduce dependence on oil.</li>
<li>BEVs reduce dependence on price manipulated oil markets.</li>
<li>BEVs reduce vehicle energy costs by up to 90%</li>
<li>BEVs are up to 75% energy efficient (with ReGen) VS as little as 15% for a petrol ICE powered car (inc. transmission losses)</li>
<li>BEVs have much more torque than an ICE (for a given power rating) and a flat torque curve.</li>
<li>BEVs mitigate <a href="../../../g/l/o/Global_warming.html" title="Global warming">global warming</a>.</li>
<li>BEVs are quieter than internal combustion engine vehicles (Though in the newest ICE vehicles engines only account for a small fraction of the noise; most noise is produced by tires and aerodynamics in an equal measure as BEVs).</li>
<li>BEVs do not produce noxious fumes.</li>
<li>BEVs can readily satisfy the needs for short trips and up to 500 km with Li-Ion and regeneration.</li>
<li>Home recharging is more convenient than trips to gasoline stations. If combined with green home energy or devices like Honda's Home Energy Station (which uses hydrogen to produce electricity) BEVs can truly be considered emission-free.</li>
<li>Regenerative braking can significantly improve vehicle efficiency.</li>
<li>Recharging costs are more predictable than gas prices, and not subject to volatile international incidents.</li>
<li>Maintenance such as oil changes, smog inspections (and their sometimes expensive consequences), cooling fluid replacement, and periodic repair and adjustments are reduced or completely eliminated, significantly reducing the cost of ownership.</li>
<li>BEVs can be powered indirectly by home <a href="../../../s/o/l/Solar_cell.html" title="Solar cell">photovoltaics</a> using <a href="../../../n/e/t/Net_metering.html" title="Net metering">net metering</a>, which offers advantages to both power producers and other grid users through peak demand satisfaction and to the EV user through cost reduction and load balancing, especially with time of use net metering.</li>
<li>BEVs can provide power to a home in the case of a power outage if specially equipped.</li>
<li>Even if powered by electricity from polluting coal plants, they are still far more energy efficient than gasoline-powered cars.</li>
<li>In case of an accident or during refueling no need to be worried about burning or exploding gasoline.</li>
<li>BEVs are favorable to <a href="../../../h/y/d/Hydrogen_vehicle.html" title="Hydrogen vehicle">hydrogen vehicles</a> because there is no need to invest in a large scale system of hydrogen distribution/storage. The electricity distribution system is already in place.</li>
</ul>
<p>The greatest supporters of BEVs are often those who have obtained or built and used them. This is a self-selected group because BEVs have not been promoted by the major manufacturers in the United States, so their enthusiasm may be misleading. Owners of conventional gasoline vehicles, once given the chance to live with a BEV often leave their gasoline cars sitting in the driveway.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/t/Battery_electric_vehicle.html" title="Edit section: Detractors' arguments">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Detractors' arguments</span></h3>
<p>Skeptics of the viability of BEVs argue on conventional practicality grounds and in more general terms. Practicality grounds include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Electricity is produced using such methods as <a href="../../../n/u/c/Nuclear_fission.html" title="Nuclear fission">nuclear fission</a>, with its attendant regulatory and waste issues, or (more often) by burning coal, the latter producing about 0.97 kg of CO<sub>2</sub> (2.1 pounds) per kilowatt-hour<a href="http://www.esru.strath.ac.uk/EandE/Web_sites/01-02/RE_info/C02.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.esru.strath.ac.uk/EandE/Web_sites/01-02/RE_info/C02.htm" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> plus other pollutants and strip-mining damages: electric vehicles are therefore not "zero emissions" in any real-world sense, except at their point of use unless <a href="../../../r/e/n/Renewable_energy.html" title="Renewable energy">renewable energy</a> (solar, wind, wave, tidal, geothermal, or hydro power) is employed;</li>
<li>Zero emission electrical sources such as solar panels must still be manufactured, producing various pollutants.</li>
<li>Limited driving <a href="../../../r/a/n/Range.html" title="Range">range</a> available between recharging (using certain battery technologies)</li>
<li>Expensive batteries, which may cost $2,000 (lead acid) to $20,000 (li-ion) to replace; most real EV cars do not get 20,000 miles (32,000 km) from a set of batteries due to low miles per day, therefore the cost per mile can be 20 to 30 cents more than gasoline cars due to battery replacement in a limited number of cases.<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></li>
<li>Poor cold weather performance of some kinds of batteries.</li>
<li>Danger of electrocution and electromagnetic interference.</li>
<li>Poor availability of public charging stations reduces practicality and may hinder initial take-up. People who live in flats or houses without private parking may not have an option to charge the vehicle at home.</li>
</ul>
<p>Those arguing in more general terms ponder the <a href="../../../f/u/t/Future_of_the_car.html" title="Future of the car">future of the car</a> as a transport solution for even more widespread global adoption, noting that the issues of traffic jams, noise pollution, total life-cycle pollution, land use, road fatalities, energy expenditure and the health toll of a sedentary lifestyle, will not be solved by zero-emission vehicles.</p>
<p>It can also be argued that the current state of the automobile industry is simply experiencing a shift due to superceding technologies, as was the case when the automobile drove the production of horse-drawn carriages, saddles, and buggy-whips into obscurity. Future automobiles will thusly shift toward low-cost and low-maintenance items, compared to today.</p>
