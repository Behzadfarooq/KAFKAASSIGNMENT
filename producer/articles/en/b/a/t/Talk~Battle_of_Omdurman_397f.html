<dd>See the article. The second part is essentially a slightly modified version of Winston Churchill's original report from 1898. Of course it is heavily POV. On the other hand, I think there is a lot of value in having a first-hand historical document in there. Maybe the source should be stressed more. --<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephan_Schulz_3024.html" title="User:Stephan Schulz">Stephan Schulz</a> 18:16, 4 Oct 2004 (UTC)

<dd>Sure, I'm not requesting it be removed because it is POV, but if the second part is more or less written by Churchill it seems quite obvoiusly copyvio, and the least thing that should be done is to make it a quote which is probably more appropriatly placed in <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikiquote.html" title="Wikiquote">Wikiquote</a>.--<a href="../../../d/i/t/User%7EDittaeva_4664.html" title="User:Dittaeva">Dittaeva</a> 20:38, 4 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually, I think it is probably not, since it was probably published before 1923 (see <a href="http://www.gutenberg.net/howto/copyright-howto" class="external text" title="http://www.gutenberg.net/howto/copyright-howto" rel="nofollow">Project Gutenberg copyright howto</a>), it would be nice to have this confirmed though. That is according to US law however, under european law it protected 75 years after the author died, if it was covered by british <a href="../../../c/r/o/Crown_Copyright_1d49.html" title="Crown Copyright">Crown Copyright</a> not assigned to the crown then it was covered by british copyright law 50 years after publication. When it is in the PD and is not a direct quotation, I suggest we just work through it and make it NPOV.--<a href="../../../d/i/t/User%7EDittaeva_4664.html" title="User:Dittaeva">Dittaeva</a> 09:58, 5 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I seriously doubt it is copyrighted anywhere in the world. If a newspaper article from the second but last century is still under copyright, something is very wrong with our copyright system (ok, so it is...). Anyways, it was written in 1898, so while it would be protected under current law, it certainly fell into ~~--the public domain in the intervening time. --<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephan_Schulz_3024.html" title="User:Stephan Schulz">Stephan Schulz</a> 11:50, 5 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I would agree, however, that the Churchillian account is highly problematic as an encyclopedia article. Someone needs to go through and revamp the article. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john</a> <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Kenney_ebe6.html" title="User talk:John Kenney">k</a> 02:38, 5 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>I think this is a dangerous fallacy. We can go through the article and make it more politically correct (remove "enemies", "our side"...), but that will not change the factual base of the article. It will just hide the inherent POVness of Churchill's account. It might be good to dig out the original, unmodified text and precede it with a clear warning (or to put it into WikiSource and link to it). We can add whatever modern information is available in a separate paragraph.--<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephan_Schulz_3024.html" title="User:Stephan Schulz">Stephan Schulz</a> 11:50, 5 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>OK, I'm always torn between amusement and outrage when I find articles like this. "<a href="../../../d/e/r/Dervish.html" title="Dervish">Dervishes</a>" are <a href="../../../s/u/f/Sufi.html" title="Sufi">Sufi</a> <a href="../../../m/y/s/Mysticism.html" title="Mysticism">mystics</a> that are chiefly known for their poetry and ability to twirl in place for long periods of time. I had a vision of British soldiers with Maxim guns gunning down 10,000 mystics twirling in white robes when I started reading this article. The term they called themselves was "Ansar" (supporters) - like <a href="../../../a/n/s/Ansar_al-Islam_47a0.html" title="Ansar al-Islam">Ansar al-Islam</a>. <i>Khalifa</i> means <i>successor</i>, because the chief claim to fame al-Taashi had was that he came after the Mahdi. I've gone through and changed these, which were the most blatant POV I saw, and also the few things I know given my limited knowledge of Mahdists. I do like the operational detail of it though.</p>
<p>So the original reason I wandered over here from <a href="../../../o/m/d/Omdurman.html" title="Omdurman">Omdurman</a> was because I was wondering what people thought about moving this article to Battle of Karari and making this a redirect. And yes Google has a couple orders of magnitude more hits for Battle of Omdurman rather than Battle of Karari, but there's a case for historical accuracy to be made. The article clearly states the location of the battle was Karari (well, Kerreri before I changed it) and that the army moved on to Omdurman only after the victory. - <a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBanyanTree_2a5f.html" title="User:BanyanTree"></a> — <a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBanyanTree_2a5f.html" title="User:BanyanTree">Banyan</a><a href="../../../b/a/n/User_talk%7EBanyanTree_059e.html" title="User talk:BanyanTree"><i>Tree</i></a> 02:23, 17 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>OK this has been written ages ago but i still have to answer:<br /></dd>
<dd>I disagree that the term <i>Dervish</i> is incorrect or inapropriate. All Dervishes don't do the twirling dance: you're thinking of the Turkish <a href="../../../m/e/v/Mevlevi.html" title="Mevlevi">Mevlevi</a> order. Other Dervishes are simply members of Sufi Muslim fraternities that differ greatly in practise. Read the <a href="../../../d/e/r/Dervish.html" title="Dervish">Dervish</a> article for more info. As followers of a Sufi preacher, the Mahdists could well be considered Dervishes. There are also, i'll concede, strong arguments against the use of this term, as Mahdism was as much a political as a religious movement, but even if this is the case the term was widely used at the time by different authors(Churchill among others). So it's no use saying they were "<i>mistakenly referred to as Dervishes</i>" as that term has historical significance. ie it's not for us to judge what is incorrect or not. Different people use different words for the same thing: Americans call trousers "pants" but British people don't go around saying "trousers mistakenly referred to as pants"!<br /></dd>
<dd>Also with replacing "Dervish" by "Ansar", the article has slipped from a British to a Sudanese POV, as Ansar is the word the Mahdists used to define themselves. I prefer to simply use the word "Mahdist"(ie followers of the Mahdi) as this is more neutral.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As for renaming the battle... Historically(as in <b>all</b> the history books) it is called Battle of Omdurman. This is because Omdurman was the objective of the Anglo-Egyptians, and also the nearest significant town. Kererri(or Karari - as you will: transliterations from the Arabic are notoriously imprecise and subject to interpretation) was just an insignificant village(at the time) next to which Kitchener's army happened to camp. In point of fact, if you want to be <b>really</b> accurate the battle was fought on a plain near Karari, so you could try calling it The Battle on the plain between Karari and Omdurman but I'm not sure that would go down too well.</dd>

<dd>This article could do with improving (the <a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schlacht_von_Omdurman" class="external text" title="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schlacht_von_Omdurman" rel="nofollow">German article</a> is much better), and I'll be editing it soon.</dd>

<p>This article states the 21st Lancers performed what became the last cavalry charge by a British Cavalry unit, but the <a href="../../../t/i/m/Timeline_of_the_British_Army_0597.html" title="Timeline of the British Army">Timeline of the British Army</a> states for 8 November 1917, "About 200 men of the Warwickshire Yeomanry and Worcestershire Yeomanry charge with sabres drawn and defeat an Ottoman battery and a large group of Ottoman infantry at Huj. It was one of the last cavalry charges by the British Army." The <a href="http://www.national-army-museum.ac.uk/pages/faq.html" class="external text" title="http://www.national-army-museum.ac.uk/pages/faq.html" rel="nofollow">National Army Museum</a> states that the last British Cavalry charge occurred at the Battle of El Mughar, 13 November 1917, by the Buckinghamshire Hussars. This "last charge" issue could be perhaps clarified with a distinction between "cavalry," "yeomanry," and "hussars," but the <a href="../../../c/a/v/Cavalry.html" title="Cavalry">cavalry</a> page notes that yeomanry and hussars are subcategories of cavalry.</p>
<p>The Timeline page also adds this qualifier: that the 21st Lancers here "perform <i>one</i> of the last <i>full</i> cavalry charges." So what is the difference between a "cavalry charge" and a "full cavalry charge?"</p>
<p>Addmittedly one of the problems in history is definitively identifying something as <i>the</i> first or <i>the</i> last. So these cavalry charges are all qualified as "one of the last..." But, still, it would be great to be able to identify <i>the</i> last. [okay, it's my whimsy]</p>
<p>Can this "last charge" issue be clarified? --<a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedJ_17_aa16.html" title="User:RedJ 17">RedJ 17</a> 18:05, 16 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Not sure but you've persuaded me at least that Omdurman shouldn't be described as the last cavalry charge by the British. <a href="../../../l/i/s/User%7ELisiate_1b7e.html" title="User:Lisiate">Lisiate</a> 00:41, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have removed the image of Churchill "in South Africa", as it is clearly of a much older man, taken sometime after the Dardanelles affair (when he was serving in Europe not Africa). <a href="http://www.churchillsociety.org/Ch_18.jpg" class="external text" title="http://www.churchillsociety.org/Ch_18.jpg" rel="nofollow">This</a> 1898 picture from the <a href="http://www.churchillsociety.org" class="external text" title="http://www.churchillsociety.org" rel="nofollow">Churchill Society</a> would be more appropriate, if copyright allows - <a href="../../../b/a/s/User%7EBastie_a178.html" title="User:Bastie">Bastie</a> 12:58, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>We have somewhat of a discrepancy in the article. It says that 21st Lancers lost 5 offices and 65 men, yet Aftermath section says the total loss in all the forces was 48 men. Someone with sources of reference on the subject should look into this. Keije 18:39, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</p>
