<h2><span class="mw-headline">Bruce's age, again</span></h2>
<p>Once again, people are changing the references to Bruce's age at the various stages of the film. The film is very clear on the timeline. <b>156.34.241.62</b> and <b>64.228.192.97</b>, I don't know why you're doing this, but please stop. If you would like to dispute the facts of the film, this is the place to do it. A series of constant reversions, especially when demonstrably false, is not the way to make your point. --Chancemichaels 16:12, 26 October 2006 (UTC)Chancemichaels</p>
<dl>
<dd>Okay, how about we just <i>don't</i> include Bruce's different ages in the film, if it creates much controversy? Maybe that will stop this edit war. Just a suggestion --<a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonathan.Bruce_9151.html" title="User:Jonathan.Bruce">Jonathan.Bruce</a> 08:43, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>One small problem with that suggestion: there is no "controversy." Bruce's age is quite clearly established in the film, both on the screen and in dialogue. That you personally would <i>like</i> Batman to be younger in this film doesn't change the basic facts of Goyer's script, nor does somebody inserting false information into the article make it true. Additionally, given the complicated narrative, I think referring to Bruce's age is very important in keeping the three time periods separate in any brief synopsis.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Do you have any evidence to challenge the article that Bruce is 8, 22 and 29-turning-30 in the film? If so, I would love to hear it. Until then, there is no controversy. --Chancemichaels 15:15, 31 October 2006 (UTC)Chancemichaels</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Let's just say "Years later, Joe Chill is murdered after agreeing to testify against Falcone....." instead of having this "disagreement," not a controversy as you said. Or, we can say "That night, at Bruce's birthday, he is confronted by Ducard," so we can avoid this disagreement, as I suggested earlier. Besides, I've got important things to do (study, job, prepare for college), so let's not mention ages at all. It's not worth a waste of time. --<a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonathan.Bruce_9151.html" title="User:Jonathan.Bruce">Jonathan.Bruce</a> 06:52, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Look, I'm sorry for inconviences I or anybody else have caused you. I wonder why Goyer and Nolan weren't thinking that Batman is around 30 in the current comics con, but he's in his twenties when he debuts! Perhaps, in writing the script, they forgot he started out younger and made him 28-30. Maybe in later films, they can retcon this little detail.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>If Ra's al Ghul is brought back by Talia and the League of Shadows in the future, Batman is beaten and injured in a fight, uses a Lazarus Pit and is restored to full health and reverts a few years younger (mid-twenties) and must stave off the temporary madness that comes with a dip in the pit. It's not impossible to make such a story like this for a future film, but Batman will be middle-aged by the time Robin, Tim Drake, and all those characters come into the picture. Just a thought, but lets just ignore or leave out the ages in the synopsis. --<a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonathan.Bruce_9151.html" title="User:Jonathan.Bruce">Jonathan.Bruce</a> 07:02, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Your issue, then, is with the filmmakers. They are the ones who quite explicitly state Bruce's age in several places throughout the course of the film. Obviously, they had reason for doing so, as nothing in a Christopher Nolan film is there by accident. Your objection is largely based on your <b>not liking</b> the choices he made, which seems to fall under <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">original research</a>. That is not evidence. The article should be about describing <i>what is</i>, not <i>what you would like to be</i>. --Chancemichaels 17:33, 1 November 2006 (UTC)Chancemichaels
<dl>
<dd>If the ages are explicitly stated in the film than they should be featured within the article. Exact ages will make the summary easier to follow rather than vague "Years later". If these ages are spoken or presented in an obvious fashion than Chancemichaels is right in that there is no dispute. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Filmaker_d97f.html" title="User:The Filmaker">The Filmaker</a> 18:15, 1 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>To be fair, the "explicit" reference is just the number "30" a watchful viewer can <i>just</i> make out in the form of an ornament around the party area <i>before</i> the actual celebration. <i>During</i> the actul celebration, it is nowhere to be seen, almost as if removed intentionally. <a href="../../../a/c/e/User%7EAce_Class_Shadow_f213.html" title="User:Ace Class Shadow">Ace Class Shadow</a>; <a href="../../../a/c/e/User_talk%7EAce_Class_Shadow_3120.html" title="User talk:Ace Class Shadow">My talk</a>. 19:36, 1 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>There's also the mathematics. Much is made of the timeline in dialogue, with multiple references to how much time has passed. Fourteen years between the murder of Bruce's parents and the murder of Joe Chill, "You have been gone seven years" and all that. When you throw in the large "30th birthday" graphic (which fills the background in a couple shots, then yes. I'd say that it is explcitly referred to. --Chancemichaels 20:55, 2 November 2006 (UTC)Chancemichaels</dd>

<dd>Isn't it kinda funny how we see it in a few shots (before Rachel heads to Arkham), and it isn't shown at the party? (I've got poor eyesight, and I didn't see it until much later after I rewatched the movie) Maybe Goyer and Nolan thought they explained the timeline enough and left it out...or did they? Beats me. It is similar to the whole Chuck Cunnigham disappearance and later re-appearance on "Happy Days," or Jim Lahey's daughter disappearing without explanation on Trailer Park Boys. Anyways, you're right on. --<a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonathan.Bruce_9151.html" title="User:Jonathan.Bruce">Jonathan.Bruce</a> 07:40, Nov 2 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I don't know that I would consider it "funny" at all, unless you have some evidence that Nolan and his editor "left it out." There's no indication that they changed their minds, only that some details of the art direction are visible in some shots but not others (hardly unusual for filmmaking). They certainly hammer the point through with the repeated references in dialogue. --Chancemichaels 17:38, 3 November 2006 (UTC)Chancemichaels</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Improving the article</span></h2>
<p>As one of the editors for <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Dark_Knight_%28film%29_7d0d.html" title="The Dark Knight (film)">The Dark Knight</a></i>, I'd like to improve this article of its preceding film to quality standards. The References section is underwhelming, and I'd like to expand on this article with stronger citations. Three key sections to expand are Production, Cast, and Reaction. The paragraph in the Cast section is especially in dire need because anyone can make outlandish claims about who was considered for the film without citation. Below are my suggestions for improving the article:</p>
<ul>
<li><s>Move Synopsis section above Production section and rename as Plot section</s></li>
<li>Expand and cite Production section; segment into subsections based on different stages of production</li>
<li><s>Change table in Cast section into what can be seen at <a href="../../../g/o/o/Wikipedia%7EGood_articles_eaa4.html" title="Wikipedia:Good articles">GA</a>-class <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/X-Men%7E_The_Last_Stand_40ad.html" title="X-Men: The Last Stand">X-Men: The Last Stand</a>'</i>s <a href="../../../t/h/e/X-Men%7E_The_Last_Stand_40ad.html#Cast" title="X-Men: The Last Stand">Cast section</a></s></li>
<li><s>Clean up Reaction section and avoid <a href="../../../a/v/o/Wikipedia%7EAvoid_weasel_words_0886.html" title="Wikipedia:Avoid weasel words">weasel words</a>, especially in Criticism section</s></li>
<li><s>Create separate "Film vs. canon"-style section to compare and contrast objectively</s></li>
<li><s>Reach consensus on inclusion of "Canceled Batman projects" section that doesn't seem to have a place here, especially with lack of citation</s></li>
</ul>
<p>To expand this article, new information needs to be added. This new information must be <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> by other editors. To do this, <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">cite accordingly</a> and use <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>. Reliable sources <b>do not include</b> blogs, scooper reports, forums, etc. I have a <a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EErikster_Film_article_expansion_guide_fe1e.html" title="User:Erikster/Film article expansion guide">film article expansion guide</a> that can be used to help expand this particular article. I suggest the following news archives for retrieval of old information for <i>Batman Begins</i>:</p>

</ul>
<p>If you can help contribute, it would be appreciated. An article about this quality film should be quality as well. --<a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EErikster_b4a3.html" title="User:Erikster">Erik</a> (<small><b><sup><a href="../../../e/r/i/User_talk%7EErikster_fbba.html" title="User talk:Erikster">talk</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Erikster_523f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Erikster">contrib</a></sub></b></small>) @ 22:21, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Some questions I'd like to ask to fellow editors:
<ul>
<li><s>Should uncited information, such as the body of the Influences subsection, be kept in the article to be cited later, or just be removed immediately?</s></li>
<li><s>Should the Batmobile get its own section or be placed under a section different from Production -- such as "Technology"?</s></li>
<li>When we compare and contrast <i>Batman Begins</i> to the rest of Batman canon, do we need to cite information from Batman canon, such as Robin becoming Batman's sidekick before ever dealing with Ra's al Ghul?</li>
<li><s>Does the information about canceled Batman projects belong in this article, as this isn't "development hell" information, but separate <i>Batman</i> projects entirely?</s></li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>Please let me know what you think, and feel free to suggest any other improvements that this article should have. --<a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EErikster_b4a3.html" title="User:Erikster">Erik</a> (<small><b><sup><a href="../../../e/r/i/User_talk%7EErikster_fbba.html" title="User talk:Erikster">talk</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Erikster_523f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Erikster">contrib</a></sub></b></small>) @ 17:43, 4 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Cancelled Projects</span></h2>
<p>I think the Cancelled Projects has been allowed to exist for far too long. The tag for not citing sources has been there for at least a month and now another completely uncited section has been added.

<dd>I concur. This doesn't seem to belong, at least not in this film article. If this information has citation behind it, maybe it can be part of some <i>Batman</i> film franchise article, but definitely not here. --<a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EErikster_b4a3.html" title="User:Erikster">Erik</a> (<small><b><sup><a href="../../../e/r/i/User_talk%7EErikster_fbba.html" title="User talk:Erikster">talk</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Erikster_523f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Erikster">contrib</a></sub></b></small>) @ 05:01, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>My recommendation is to trim that section of the article into the production section. Begins evolved really from Year One. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWiki-newbie_efab.html" title="User:Wiki-newbie">Wiki-newbie</a> 13:24, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The production based on <i>Year One</i> and the production of <i>Batman Begins</i> both drew from the same source. I don't think that <i>Batman Begins</i> drew from the leftovers of the <i>Year One</i> cancelled project. Of course, there's no citation whatsoever about these projects, so that information can't be <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verified</a>. Actually, I think that all the cancelled project information should be merged to <a href="../../../b/a/t/Batman_in_popular_media.html#Cancelled_Batman_Projects" title="Batman in popular media">Batman in popular media#Cancelled Batman Projects</a>, which currently exists. --<a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EErikster_b4a3.html" title="User:Erikster">Erik</a> (<small><b><sup><a href="../../../e/r/i/User_talk%7EErikster_fbba.html" title="User talk:Erikster">talk</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Erikster_523f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Erikster">contrib</a></sub></b></small>) @ 17:15, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>

<dd>In the absence of any citation, I would tend to agree. If anyone can substantiate that the Batman Begins budget was charged for those aborted films, as was the case for Superman Returns, then it would merit inclusion here. I don't know that to be the case, though, and until we do they all belong in their own article. --Chancemichaels 19:22, 5 November 2006 (UTC)Chancemichaels</dd>

<p>Okay. Done. Couldn't find anything concrete on the <a href="../../../d/k/r/DKR_7bb2.html" title="DKR">DKR</a> mention. Like you said, it just sorta goes south into a plug for the new comic. Jim Lee name dropping DKR out of nowhere is the turning point. Overall, it's good stuff. I actually thought the whole "all these comics were inspiration" thing was BS, but the way they explain it makes sense. In particular Ra's asian bodyguard is dressed strikingly similar to Ken's role. I guess that was a tell for older comics fans. <a href="../../../a/c/e/User%7EAce_Class_Shadow_f213.html" title="User:Ace Class Shadow">Ace Class Shadow</a>; <a href="../../../a/c/e/User_talk%7EAce_Class_Shadow_3120.html" title="User talk:Ace Class Shadow">My talk</a>. 08:23, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Probably just the feel of the comics (Year One, Long Halloween) was what influenced Batman Begins. Hopefully, they can adapt some of the other stories like Dark Victory and/or The Killing Joke. Look at Sin City, they were able to adapt that to the big screen quite faithfully.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Departure from comics</span></h2>
<p>I have just added reasonably substantial content to the "Departure from canon" bit, and fixed a few parts as well. It is interesting that such a part exists here and should be applied to other Bat-film articles as well. Batman's tendency not to save some villains is not exclusively present in <i>Batman Begins</i> (note when he threw a thug into a pothole and let him explode in <i>Batman Returns</i>, or when he used the Joker to shield himself from bullets in <a href="../../../a/_/d/Batman%7E_A_Death_in_the_Family_d76e.html" title="Batman: A Death in the Family">Batman: A Death in the Family</a>. Also, major parts (which I have just added in, but only a little) such as Bruce's training around the world and how he came to use the bat as his totem were neglected. Anyway, keep it up, fellow editors of this article!<br /></p>

<p>You're right on. I mean, Bats coulda saved Ra's on the burning train, but he chose not to save him. It's not like in Tim Burton's films where he just kills without remorse, (that made Batman too dark) but he will use extreme force to protect himself and others. Perhaps, if some major comics fan, like you Jedd the Jedi, could direct an installment, he/she could include that training in Alaska (see the Man Who Falls and LEGENDS OF THE DARK KNIGHT #1) and how he chose the bat as his totem. You could direct a film, man, keep working on it! --<a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonathan.Bruce_9151.html" title="User:Jonathan.Bruce">Jonathan.Bruce</a> 07:20, 6 Nov 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No kidding. I'm working on a script treatment of "The Long Halloween" right now. I'm planning to ask Jeph Loeb and Tim Sale's permission, then I'll contact Warner Bros within a few years to try and have it adapted. Of course, this could contradict the Begins sequels, but I can have Harvey Dent get plastic surgery and resort back to Two-Face by the end!

<p>Isn't "Departure from Comics" a better title for the section than "Departure from Canon"? The film series has no canon, and there are several Batman canons - the 60s series and film, the 1990s animated series, the 2000s animated series, the first film series and now the new film series. The only "departures" discussed are from the comics. --Chancemichaels 15:31, 7 December 2006 (UTC)Chancemichaels</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Gotham City</span></h2>
<p>Can anyone write a paragraph about Gotham City in the film to precede the paragraph about how Nolan and Crowley conceived of its design? The Batmobile and Batsuit subsections have lead paragraphs detailing its existence in the fictional universe, and Gotham City should have the same thing. Just describe (as objectively as possible) the history of Gotham City, such as the train system being implemented by the Waynes, Ra's al Ghul trying to bring the city down via economics as a weapon, Carmine Falcone being in charge, the corrupt police, etc. It would be greatly appreciated, thanks. --<a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EErikster_b4a3.html" title="User:Erikster">Erik</a> (<small><b><sup><a href="../../../e/r/i/User_talk%7EErikster_fbba.html" title="User talk:Erikster">talk</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Erikster_523f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Erikster">contrib</a></sub></b></small>) @ 16:38, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I gave it a go, though my memory of the film is a bit foggy.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Plot section</span></h2>
<p>I was wondering if it would be more appropriate to write the Plot section with a linear perspective. For example, is it really necessary to try to explain the film in the exact order of the scenes? Why can't we just write about how Bruce Wayne was born to the Waynes (with brief background on the family and their involvement with Gotham City), then talk about the events that happened to 8-year-old Bruce Wayne (the encounter with the bats and his parents' deaths), then go forward to 22-year-old Bruce Wayne out of college and desiring to kill Joe Chill, and so forth? The back-and-forth perspective works on film, but it seems too confusing in a summary because there's less impact in just reading succinct sentences. What do you think? --<a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EErikster_b4a3.html" title="User:Erikster">Erik</a> (<small><b><sup><a href="../../../e/r/i/User_talk%7EErikster_fbba.html" title="User talk:Erikster">talk</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Erikster_523f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Erikster">contrib</a></sub></b></small>) @ 18:05, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think that the Production section needs to forego sectioning, as many FA-class film articles seem to have that kind of setup. The challenge would be "stitching" the production information together so that it would flow. I'd suggest, though, that "Influences" and "Departure from canon" be exported from the Production section, since the information is supplementary in nature. Perhaps they can be set up as subsections under an "Adaptation" section, since influences and comparisons would fall under that category. I'm not sure about the film score, though... I think there's a couple of citations about IGN's interview with the composers which would help flesh out the film score to have its own section. That would leave the Development and Filming subsections to combine, and I think we can expand on that using the production notes from the film (you can find them in References). Any additional suggestions or comments are welcome. --<a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EErikster_b4a3.html" title="User:Erikster">Erik</a> (<small><b><sup><a href="../../../e/r/i/User_talk%7EErikster_fbba.html" title="User talk:Erikster">talk</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Erikster_523f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Erikster">contrib</a></sub></b></small>) @ 17:01, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I don't think that the new image for the Gotham City subsection suits it very well; it's about as useful as the image in the Plot section with Batman and Gordon.

<dd>Well, image's been removed, anyway.&#160;:) I haven't seen the movie in a while; are there any prominent shots of contemporary Gotham City in the film that would help illustrate the universe?

<dd>This isn't "let's find all the differences in the film compared to the 'many' comics it was inspired from". I'm sure there are plenty of similarities and differences between this film and the comics. IMO, if we don't have a reliable source discusses the differences (even then try and keep them to the most important ones..the fact that batman's symbol is different at this point in his life is irrelevant, or anything like that) then we shouldn't be including it. Personal comparisons of two source materials is still Original Research, because you can't see if it's just a coincidence or intention or what. No source no place. Just my opinion. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBignole_566d.html" title="User:Bignole">Bignole</a> 00:06, 12 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I agree. In addition, the sources should be about the observations made and not just citing a comic book issue (like an issue where the actual Ra's Al Ghul appears in his Arabic look in order to compare to the film version).

<dd>Diddo. The section started out as fan criticism and still exists as a a short "free for all" OR-factory. I'd say either delete it wholesale or find/require citations and remove the rest.

<dd>As I'm looking at it again, I'm thinking Ace has the best idea..get rid of it completely. It really does nothing more than compare the film to the comic, when the film is based on not only several comics (not just one), but also an original interpretation of the character. There really isn't a point to say "Batman didn't do this in the comics" when this isn't an adaptation. This isn't like "JAWS" where you have a film based on a novel, it's film based on a character, with elements from several sources. What changes they make doesn't really make a difference in an encyclopedia. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBignole_566d.html" title="User:Bignole">Bignole</a> 00:19, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Influences section</span></h2>
<p>Hey, fellas, just got your message regarding my edits to this section. I appreciate the guidance. My question is this: the points I made are easily verifiable by viewing the movie and reading the Year One comic. Couldn't I just cite Year One as my reference? Probably not, I'm assuming. I respect the guidlines regarding citing references, and I realize my frustration is not with this section of the article per se but more with the original reference downplaying the film's debt to Year One as there are clearly more parallels to that comic than what are mentioned in the DVD documentary cited (forgive me, but I haven't seen the documentary; my DVD is the special "sucker" edition with no extras). I'm new to Wikipedia and having fun with it, but I want to make additions that are relevant and valuable, so your advice is apprecated. <a href="../../../v/a/r/User%7EVarengo71_c3b2.html" title="User:Varengo71">Cris Varengo</a> 03:38, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>In my experience, it's a pretty thin line between making "obvious" connections and relatively obscure connections. A lot of trivia on film articles tend to be based on these connections and usually aren't qualified as encyclopedic. I doubt that your connections between <i>Batman Begins</i> and <i>Year One</i> are wrong, but some editors, myself included, desire a high level of authenticity on this article, <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Dark_Knight_%28film%29_7d0d.html" title="The Dark Knight (film)">The Dark Knight</a></i>, and <i><a href="../../../s/p/i/Spider-Man_3_8aa2.html" title="Spider-Man 3">Spider-Man 3</a></i> (though the articles on Spider-Man's preceding films are in pretty gross shape). I think what you could do, if you wanted to expand the <i>Year One</i> connection, is Google for <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> with <i>Year One</i> and <i>Batman Begins</i> as the keyword. Who knows, maybe there's an interview where the connections are more explicitly drawn than in the DVD featurette. —<a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EErikster_b4a3.html" title="User:Erikster">Erik</a> (<a href="../../../e/r/i/User_talk%7EErikster_fbba.html" title="User talk:Erikster">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Erikster_523f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Erikster">contrib</a>) - 03:44, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for the tip. I might do that, but I'll probably just leave it alone; this section does refer to the film's debt to Year One and any one who decides to compare the two will discover the other parallels between the film and the comic for themselves. My own personal observation is definitely that the film drew heavily from Year One, which is a good thing. I loved Year One and I loved this film. My opinion is that the featurette (which in all fairness I haven't seen) must kind of downplay the film's debt to Year One. But this is making an issue out of nothing, I suppose. Many scenes in the movie have direct, nearly identical parallels in Year One, but I guess any faithful film translation of Batman's early career would have to if they were following current comics canon. <a href="../../../v/a/r/User%7EVarengo71_c3b2.html" title="User:Varengo71">Cris Varengo</a> 04:02, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The featurette mentions various comics and isn't the best resource for full encyclopedic citation or comic fan satisfying data. The use of Year One is mostly implied through imagery rather than wording. Ultimately, I'd encourage you and anyone else to seek out sources and cite sources better suited for an encyclopedia. I'm sure the DVD extra just doesn't do the facts justice. <a href="../../../a/c/e/User%7EAce_Class_Shadow_f213.html" title="User:Ace Class Shadow">Ace Class Shadow</a>; <a href="../../../a/c/e/User_talk%7EAce_Class_Shadow_3120.html" title="User talk:Ace Class Shadow">My talk</a>. 08:27, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Expansion</span></h3>
<p>I followed my own advice of Googling the keywords <i>Batman Begins</i> and <i>Year One</i>. In the process, I uncovered some interesting sources. First of all, David S. Goyer talked a bit more about <i>Year One</i> influences with in an <a href="http://cinecon.com/news.php?id=0409294" class="external text" title="http://cinecon.com/news.php?id=0409294" rel="nofollow">interview</a> with <i>SFX</i> magazine (couldn't find the interview on <i>SFX</i> home page). This could be inserted into the Influences section; probably would need to change the DVD featurette citation into multiple references if we're going to go back and forth between citations. Secondly, I have an idea to address the "Departure from comics" dilemma. We could provide informative sites in the External links and keep any comparison out of the article entirely. IGN has a Comic Vs. Film <a href="http://comics.ign.com/articles/624/624890p1.html" class="external text" title="http://comics.ign.com/articles/624/624890p1.html" rel="nofollow">analysis</a>. There's also a less reliable <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/merussell/iblog/B835531044/C31175526/E148703776/index.html" class="external text" title="http://homepage.mac.com/merussell/iblog/B835531044/C31175526/E148703776/index.html" rel="nofollow">blog entry</a> that draws comparisons and differences as well. My suggestion is that the editors can agree on what seems to be the most appropriate links to include in External links. I'm fine with including both, but if I had to choose one, I'd go with the IGN analysis. Let me know what you think. —<a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EErikster_b4a3.html" title="User:Erikster">Erik</a> (<a href="../../../e/r/i/User_talk%7EErikster_fbba.html" title="User talk:Erikster">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Erikster_523f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Erikster">contrib</a>) - 18:37, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think including more information, from other sources, into the "influences" section would be the best thing to do. Obviously, the DVD featurette takes precidence over anything else, as it literally has the film makers discussing what was what, but sometimes even they can forget something or just not have time to go into detail. I'd also just use the IGN "Comic/Film" entry. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBignole_566d.html" title="User:Bignole">Bignole</a> 19:15, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

The lighter direction Schumacher had taken the franchise was abandoned, and a new film was written concerning the origins of Batman with some inspirations from the <i>Year One</i> and <i>Long Halloween</i> storylines.</p>
<p>The film is an exploration of Batman's origins, and was the first sucessful film adaptation of this stage of the character's history. In the story, Bruce Wayne joins a group of vigilantes to fight crime after the murder of his parents, and returns to challenge the master of his hometown of Gotham's criminal element, Carmine Falcone. During this conflict, however, he discovers Falcone is in league with a more dangerous and destructive power which seeks the destruction of Gotham, rather than its corruption.</p>
<p><i>Batman Begins</i> was a critical and commercial success, and a sequel entitled <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Dark_Knight_%28film%29_7d0d.html" title="The Dark Knight (film)">The Dark Knight</a></i> was commissioned for a <a href="../../../2/0/0/2008_in_film.html" title="2008 in film">2008</a> release with both Nolan and Bale returning.</p>

<dd>I don't recall a request for expansion. Besides, your addition was poorly written. "The first origin story" or some similarly brief note is enough. Your changed adds "successful" which makes the final paragraph about said success somewhat redundant. Not to mention, it implies that there may have been other, non-success origin stories, which I certainly don't believe there were. The first sentence of your expanded second paragraph is a also either a <a href="../../../r/u/n/Run-on_sentence.html" title="Run-on sentence">run-on sentence</a> or <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comma_splice.html" title="Comma splice">comma splice</a>. I find this part especially telling, in a bad way: "returns to challenge the master of his hometown of Gotham's criminal element". What the hell is that? Borderline nonsense. How about not using two possessives and "of"s concurrently in the same sentence? For example: "returns to defeat <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carmine_Falcone_1434.html" title="Carmine Falcone">Carmine Falcone</a>, the top mobster corrupting his home of <a href="../../../g/o/t/Gotham_City_7766.html" title="Gotham City">Gotham City</a>"? Then, once again, there's the actual messages implied by the poor wording.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Let say what I get from that expanded second paragraph which is supposed to summarize the story. Bruce joins a gang after his parents are murdered. He tries to stop a mob boss, but learns that boss is working with some ambiguous "destructive force". This thoroughly misinforms the reader <i>while</i> actually uninforming them at the same time. You make it sound like Bruce joined the gang right after the murder, or at the very least, not ten some odd years later! Then you skip right over how Bruce leaves the gang with their HQ destroyed. The reader's supposed to assume Bruce's "return"—from where, BTW? You never explain where he went or anything. Was the murder and gang joining just after his parents moved or something?—is a complete separate event following his alliance and disalliance with the gang? Or does he bring the gang with him to fight Falcone? Now, let's return to the end and ambiguous "force". Let me guess, you're trying to save the readers the surprise of finding out that "force" is Bruce's old gang? Or maybe it's some evil corporation. Hey! Maybe it's a <a href="../../../p/e/r/Personification_of_death.html" title="Personification of death">personification of death</a> or <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_devil.html" title="The devil">the devil</a>!</dd>

<dd>It was on the to-do list, but I'm seeing your point --<a href="../../../l/e/n/User%7ELenin_and_McCarthy_e05a.html" title="User:Lenin and McCarthy">Lenin and McCarthy</a> | (<a href="../../../l/e/n/User_talk%7ELenin_%26_McCarthy_0b4e.html" title="User talk:Lenin &amp; McCarthy">Complain here</a>) 20:04, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Seriously? Oh...well, sorry. I might have been a little harsh. I suppose something could be done. <a href="../../../a/c/e/User%7EAce_Class_Shadow_f213.html" title="User:Ace Class Shadow">Ace Class Shadow</a>; <a href="../../../a/c/e/User_talk%7EAce_Class_Shadow_3120.html" title="User talk:Ace Class Shadow">My talk</a>. 20:39, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Okay. I mentioned the death of Bruce's parents, wikified the glorified name drippings of "Year one" and "Halloween", mentioned the three villains—Joe doesn't really count—and still avoided trying to explain the whole, fairly complex plot. As a side note, the article was at 41 kb before and after I editted it. <a href="../../../a/c/e/User%7EAce_Class_Shadow_f213.html" title="User:Ace Class Shadow">Ace Class Shadow</a>; <a href="../../../a/c/e/User_talk%7EAce_Class_Shadow_3120.html" title="User talk:Ace Class Shadow">My talk</a>. 21:19, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think it looks good, if you were interested in my opinion. Otherwise, er, carry on with whatever you were planning to do --<a href="../../../l/e/n/User%7ELenin_and_McCarthy_e05a.html" title="User:Lenin and McCarthy">Lenin and McCarthy</a> | (<a href="../../../l/e/n/User_talk%7ELenin_%26_McCarthy_0b4e.html" title="User talk:Lenin &amp; McCarthy">Complain here</a>) 12:20, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
