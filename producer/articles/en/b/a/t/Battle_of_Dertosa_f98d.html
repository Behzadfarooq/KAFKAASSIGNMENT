<p>The <b>Battle of Dertosa</b>, also known as the ‘’’Battle of Ibera’’’, was fought in the spring of 215 BC on the south of the <a href="../../../e/b/r/Ebro_River_379c.html" title="Ebro River">Ebro River</a> across the town of Dertosa. A Roman army, under the command of <a href="../../../g/n/a/Gnaeus_Cornelius_Scipio_Calvus_ecea.html" title="Gnaeus Cornelius Scipio Calvus">Gnaeus Cornelius Scipio Calvus</a> and <a href="../../../p/u/b/Publius_Cornelius_Scipio_2187.html" title="Publius Cornelius Scipio">Publius Cornelius Scipio</a> defeated a similarly sized Carthaginian army under <a href="../../../h/a/s/Hasdrubal_Barca_d3ce.html" title="Hasdrubal Barca">Hasdrubal Barca</a>. The Romans, under Gnaeus Scipio, had established themselves after winning the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Cissa_325f.html" title="Battle of Cissa">Battle of Cissa</a> in 218 BC. The expedition of Hasdrubal Barca to evict them had ended in defeat of the Spanish contingent of the Carthaginian navy at the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Ebro_River_b462.html" title="Battle of Ebro River">Battle of Ebro River</a> in 217 BC. Hasdrubal launched another expedition in 215 BC, but the defeat at Dertosa cost the Carthaginians a chance to reinforce Hannibal at a critical juncture, and the Romans gained the initiative in <a href="../../../h/i/s/Hispania.html" title="Hispania">Hispania</a>. The Scipio brothers continued with their policy of subjugating the Spanish tribes and raiding Carthaginian possessions. Hasdrubal, losing of most of his field army, had to be reinforced with the army that was to sail to Italy and reinforce Hannibal. Thus, by winning this battle, the Scipios had indirectly prevented the situation in Italy from getting worse in addition to improving their own situation in Spain. This battle also demonstrates the danger of implementing the <a href="../../../d/o/u/Double_envelopment.html" title="Double envelopment">double envelopment</a> tactic.</p>

<p>The Romans had fielded several armies, which followed a strategy of avoiding Hannibal in the open field and striking at his allies whenever possible. The main Roman army under the dictator M. Julius Pera was guarding the direct approach to Rome in southern Latinum. <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marcus_Claudius_Marcellus_7315.html" title="Marcus Claudius Marcellus">Marcus Claudius Marcellus</a> had battled Hannibal at Nola and also secured Neapolis from falling to the Carthaginians.

<p>The legion posted in Sardinia suffered from sickness. The praetor, Muscius Scavola, had to collect pay and provisions for the troops locally. This had caused unrest among the Sardinians, and Hampsicora, a Sardinian chieftain, was fermenting rebellion among the locals and had requested Carthaginian aid.</p>

<p>Hasdrubal has been on the defensive since the defeat of his fleet at <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Ebro_River_b462.html" title="Battle of Ebro River">Battle of Ebro River</a> in the spring of 217 BC. He had left Boaster, a subordinate commander with a force to guard the Ebro line against any Roman encroachment. Boaster had retreated when the Romans had crossed the Ebro, furthermore, he was tricked into surrendering the Spanish tribal hostages held at Saguntum to the Romans by a Spanish chieftain named Abylix. This had caused revolts in Barcid Spain, especially among the Trudetani tribe near Gades in 216 BC. Hasdrubal had received 4,000 foot and 500 horsemen, with orders to march to Italy after securing Spain. The better part of 216 BC was spent in subduing the Spanish tribes, with little effort to confront the Romans.</p>
<p>Gnaeus Scipio had received 8,000 reinforcements under his Brother Publius Scipio after the battle of Ebro River. The brothers enjoyed proconsular rank, and exercised joint command. The brothers adopted an aggressive naval strategy given the destruction of the Carthaginian navy, raiding Barcid possessions in Spain and Balearic Islands. The Scipios also recruited auxiliary troops from Spanish tribes, garrisoned towns to expand their operational sphere, consolidated their hold north of the Ebro River and dealt with tribal unrest there. They also encouraged Spanish tribes friendly with the Romans to raid tribes loyal to Carthage beyond the Ebro.</p>

<p>In early 215 BC The Romans had crossed the Ebro River in force and had laid siege to Ibera, a small Spanish town allied to Carthage. Hasdrubal, leaving Himilco in charge at Cartagena, marched north with his field army and reached the Ebro. However, he chose not to cross the Ebro to raid the Roman possessions nor did he attack the Roman army besieging Ibera. The Carthaginian army besieged a town allied with the Romans across Dertosa instead. The Scipios lifted the siege and moved to engage Hasdrubal. Thus, Hasdrubal had gained the strategic initiative, he had aided his allies by forcing the Romans to lift their siege and also face the Carthaginian army on a site of his own choosing. The opposing armies encamped on a plain between Ibera and Dertosa within 5 miles of each other. After 5 days of skirmishing, the commanders drew out their armies for battle.</p>

<p>The Roman infantry consisted of 2 Roman legions of 10,000 soldiers, and 18,000 allied Italian troops. The cavalry was made up of 600 Roman and 1,800 Italian heavy horsemen. The Romans also had recruited an auxiliary force of 2,000 Spanish footmen and 400 heavy horsemen.</p>
<p>Hasdrubal had 15,000 Libyan spearmen, 1,000 mercenaries (mostly Ligurians from Italy) and 8,000 Spanish troops in his infantry detachment. The Carthaginian cavalry was made up of 450 Libyan/Punic and 1,200 Spanish heavy horsemen and 2,300 light Numidian horsemen. The Carthaginian army also had 20 elephants and 1,000 Balearic slingers with them.</p>

<p>The Romans posted their troops in traditional manner, with the cavalry on the wings and the infantry in the center. The Roman and Spanish horse was placed on the right wing, the allied Italian horse on the left wing. The infantry line had the Italian troops on the wings next to the cavalry, and the Roman legions were posted in the center of the infantry line. 2,000 Roman/Italian troops and the Spanish infantry guarded the Roman camp.</p>
<p>Hasdrubal placed the Libyan and Spanish horse on his left wing facing the Roman/Spanish horse, and the Numidian light horse on his right wing facing the allied Italian horsemen. Next to the Spanish cavalry contingent, Hasdrubal placed a phalanx of Libyans infantry, backed up by mercenaries, facing the Italian foot, and another phalanx of Libyan foot was placed next to the Numidian horsemen on the Carthaginian right wing, also facing Italian foot deployed against them. Between the Libyan infantry phalanxes in the center of the Carthaginian infantry line, facing the Roman legions, was a thinned out Spanish infantry line. The Elephants were divided into two groups of 10 and placed in front of the cavalry on both of the wings. The Balearic slingers formed a skirmish line in front of the infantry. 2/3,000 troops were left to guard the Carthaginian camp.</p>

<p>After a brief skirmish between light troops, the Roman legions placed in the center charged the thinned out line of Spanish infantry opposite them, and having the advantage of both number (10,000 against 8,000) and formation depth, drove back the Spaniards almost instantly. However, this is an integral part of the double envelopment tactic Hasdrubal was trying to implement. The Carthaginian elephants placed on both the wings charged the Roman and Italian cavalry opposite them. The charge proved ineffective, the Roman and Italian horsemen were not disrupted, and the elephants played no further role in the battle. The Italian infantry formations closed with the Libyan formations opposite then in support of the Romans attacking the Spaniards.</p>

<p>The Libyans and mercenaries placed on the flanks of the hard pressed Spaniards charged the Italian infantry opposite them, and despite their advantage in numbers (16,000 against 18,000), the Italians were pushed back. Unlike Cannae, the Libyans did not outflank the Romans. The Carthaginian cavalry placed on the wings, on the flank of the Libyans closed with the Roman and Italian horsemen opposite them. Despite having the advantage in numbers on both wings (1,600 Libyan/Punic and Spaniards faced 1,000 Roman/Spaniards on the left of the Carthaginian line and 2,300 Numidians faced 1,800 Italian horsemen on the right of the Carthaginian line), the Carthaginian horsemen were unable to drive the Romans from the battlefield. An indecisive skirmish developed on the both wings of the armies between the opposing cavalry, with neither side gaining any advantage. At this point, the Spanish infantry on the Carthaginian center line collapsed, and began to flee the battle.</p>

<p>At Trebbia, the center of the Carthaginian infantry line had also collapsed under Roman infantry assault. But Hannibal had managed to win the battle as his infantry had outflanked the Romans on both sides, and his cavalry, after driving their Roman opponents from the field, had attacked the Roman infantry from the rear along with Mago's ambushing troops. Hasdrubal had no ambush in place at Dertosa, but the Libyans had been driving the Italian infantry back when the Spaniards at the center had collapsed.</p>
<p>The Carthaginian cavalry, seeing their infantry center break and run, broke off their skirmishing with their Roman counterparts and also fled the battlefield. The Roman infantry, after scattering the Spaniards, returned to help the Italian infantry. The Libyan infantry managed to put up a hard resistance, inflicting and suffering heavy casualties before being routed.</p>

<p>Hasdrubal survived the battle with most of his elephants and cavalry, and a few infantry (mostly Spaniards). The Roman pursuit was not vigorous enough to repeat their success after the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Cissa_325f.html" title="Battle of Cissa">Battle of Cissa</a>. The Romans managed to storm the Carthaginian camp, after Hasdrubal had hastily evacuated his soldiers. The provisions and booty fell into the hands of the victorious Romans. The shattered Carthaginian army retired to Cartagena, leaving the Romans firmly established on the south of the Ebro.</p>
<p>Hasdrubal would be reinforced by 2 armies under <a href="../../../m/a/g/Mago_Barca_8e20.html" title="Mago Barca">Mago Barca</a> and <a href="../../../h/a/s/Hasdrubal_Gisco_51b8.html" title="Hasdrubal Gisco">Hasdrubal Gisco</a> to keep the Romans in check and keep the Carthaginian possessions under control. The Carthaginians would not mount any effective campaigns north of the Ebro again, and would be fated to battle the Romans until 205 BC for the control of Spain with varying success.</p>
<p>The Scipio brothers did not mount a vigorous pursuit or an immediate campaign against the Carthaginians immediately after their victory. They chose to follow their strategy of mounting raids, instigating Spanish tribes to rebel, and building up their powerbase. The Scipios would receive no reinforcements from Italy for the remainder of their command in Spain. They would fight the Barca brothers and Gisco with varying results until 212 BC, when they launched a major campaign leading to the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_the_Upper_Baetis_1ad7.html" title="Battle of the Upper Baetis">Battle of the Upper Baetis</a>.</p>

<p>Hasdrubal had tried to imitate the tactics used by Hannibal at Cannae. While Hannibal had brought about a spectacular victory, Hasdrubal had suffered a shattering defeat. Some of the factors for this contrasting result are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Hannibal had a better army and staff officers, and better control over his troops. The Spaniards of Hasdrubal were lukewarm about leaving Spain, which may have affected morale.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>The skill of the Carthaginian staff officers at Cannae was demonstrated by the maneuvers of Hasdrubal (not Hasdrubal Barca), commanding the heavy cavalry. His unit charged and broke the Roman horse, regrouped, crossed the battlefield to attack the Italian horse from the rear, again regrouped, then attacked the Roman infantry from the rear. These were extremely complex moves orchestrated with flawless efficiency, a tribute to the skill of the troops and their commander. Hasdrubal Barca did not have such assets at Dertosa.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Hannibal had a decisive advantage in Cavalry (10,000 against 6,000) at Cannae and took advantage of this to the fullest. Hasdrubal had a slight advantage (4,000 against 2,800), but failed to take any advantage or devise any formation to gain the upper hand.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Hannibal had no elephants at Cannae. Hasdrubal had 20, but he gained no advantage from his use of them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Dertosa_f98d.html" title="Edit section: Strategic Importance">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Strategic Importance</span></h3>
<p>Although the Battle of Dertosa is not given the same importance as the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_the_Metaurus_576e.html" title="Battle of the Metaurus">Battle of the Metaurus</a>, it had a critical influence on the strategic course of the war.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Had Hasdrubal won the Battle, there would have been at least 4 Carthaginian armies operating in Italy by 214 BC, that of Hasdrubal, Hannibal, Mago and Hanno the Elder.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>The cornerstone of the strategy which <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hamilcar_Barca_fd5c.html" title="Hamilcar Barca">Hamilcar Barca</a> had planned depended on undisputed command of the Barcids in Spain, and the ability to draw manpower and wealth from it. The defeat caused Carthage to send Mago Barca, along with Hasdrubal Gisco, a political rival of the Barcids to Spain. This ended the Barcid domination, with far reaching consequences. In addition, Hannibal never managed to receive further reinforcements from Spain.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>The Romans gained the initiative in Spain, which caused a drain of resources better employed elsewhere. Consequently, Mago was sent to Spain with the reinforcements meant for Hannibal.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Although Hannibal would receive 4,000 Numidian Horse and 40 elephants in 215 BC, these were pitiful compared to the 17,000 soldiers that would be lost in Sardinia and the 28,000 soldiers that would be tied up in Sicily later. In short, the defeat at Dertosa took away most of the political capital Hannibal had won in Carthage through his victory at Cannae.</li>
