<p>What on earth is the "Batclimb cameo"&#160;? 194.97.166.245 09:18, 26 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think that was a short scene in which Batman and Robin would be scaling a wall in pursuit of the villan, and as they passed a window, someone (often, or maybe always) a famous actor or personality, would stick their head out and have a brief conversation with the two heros. As I recall it typically went something like:</dd>
<dd><b>Citizen</b> (personality doing the cameo): Batman and Robin!? What are you doing here?</dd>
<dd><b>Batman</b>: We're just practicing our wall climbing skills.</dd>
<dd><b>Robin</b>: There's nothing to worry about sir, you can go back to bed.</dd>

<p>When Fox Home Entertainment releases this (hopefully in 2006, for the show's 40th anniversary), I really hope they include the complete West, Ward, and Lyle Wagonner screentests, as can be found at <a href="http://www.batfriend.com" class="external free" title="http://www.batfriend.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.batfriend.com</a> as well as getting West, Ward, and Lorenzo Semple to do audio commentary for the pilot and other selected episodes.</p>
<dl>
<dd>The screentests have already been released on the Batmania 2-disc set that came out last year. A lot of people consider it to be the "bonus features" for a non-existent box set of the series. From what I hear the odds of this seeing DVD release in the near future are virtually nil due to the fact Fox (which owns the series) and Warner Brothers (which owns the character) can't come to an agreement. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 01:59, 8 December 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Thank you for that tip&#160;! I am going to look for that DVD&#160;! I'm surprised there is a problem between Fox and WB. WB didn't hold up Sony's release of the Batman serials. Time-Warner is just greedy...they should give thier cut to West and Ward instead.</dd>

<p>Has anyone else noticed the similarities between the theme song for Batman and the song 'Taxman' released by The Beatles released in 1967 on their album Revolver? Is it just me or is there some actual link between the two? - Draven5</p>
<dl>
<dd>I know the song quite well. I see no similarities except the fact "Taxman" and "Batman" are both 2-syllable words. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 17:13, 26 January 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>That, and the harmonized cries of "<a href="../../../t/a/x/Taxman.html" title="Taxman">Taxman</a>!" are <i>slightly</i> echoic of the "Batman!" chorus. But the songs are highly dissimilar in all other respects. Of course, the whole idea is a real stretch: "Well me and the lads were watchin' <i>Batman</i> on the telly and the theme comes on and we look at each other and says, 'Right!' And I mean there you have it." <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarryEyes_74d0.html" title="User:StarryEyes"><font color="#FF0000">Starry</font></a><a href="../../../s/t/a/User_talk%7EStarryEyes_a831.html" title="User talk:StarryEyes"><font color="#0000FF">Eyes</font></a> 17:33, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm not sure if this is true or not, but I've heard that in one episode that had Kato and the Green Hornet fighting Batman and Robin, there was some off-the-set trash-talk by Robin that was directed at Lee. When the actors went onto the set to throw stage punches, Lee went out there and fought for real, injuring Robin. Is there any truth to this? Dariustriplet 02:04, 12 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>No, Burt Ward and Bruce Lee were friends, and trained in Martial Arts together. When the fight in question was to be filmed, Lee decided to play a joke on Ward by acting very angry the entire day. Ward started to get nervous, and when they started filming the fight, Lee acted like he was going to beat Ward for real which caused Ward to go into a panic. Lee then started laughing at Ward revealing that it was just a joke.
<dl>
<dd>The above incident is described in Burt Ward's autobiography. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 21:41, 10 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>You're right. The article listing Batman guest stars notes that Batclimb cameo. 23skidoo is wrong. Ward and Lee were not friends. <a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoczilla_1c36.html" title="User:Doczilla">Doczilla</a> 03:54, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Can we say that the series is widely believed to have 'jumped the shark' with the introduction of Batgirl and the other changes, hence its cancellation?</p>
<p>There's no mention of the story that another network was willing to take over the series, but by that point the Batcave set had been destroyed and the cost of recreating it was a major factor in stopping a final agreement.</p>
<p>If Warner isn't involved in the failure to have a DVD release, what's the problem?</p>
<p>I am hugely amused that the main Batman page calls the TV series 'silly' but manages to give the comics' character's history with a straight face.</p>

<dd>I'd personally say that the series jumped the shark two minutes after the first exec at the studio got the idea to make it. But that's just me. --70.121.26.115 05:45, 28 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't believe the show should be classified as "parody". This is very misleading. The IMDb entry lists a whole slew of genres and none of them are comedic - actually, the show seems to accurately reflect the outlandish nature of some of the <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golden_Age_of_Comic_Books_1c51.html" title="Golden Age of Comic Books">Golden Age</a> Batman stories. --<a href="../../../j/t/a/User%7EJtalledo_ca0a.html" title="User:Jtalledo">Jtalledo</a> <a href="../../../j/t/a/User_talk%7EJtalledo_8071.html" title="User talk:Jtalledo">(talk)</a> 04:50, 28 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>The show is generally considered a parody, however. This is certainly how Adam West and Burt Ward approached the material.

<p>No mention of the addition of Aunt Harriet to the TV show after having not been in the comic? It's my understanding that she was added to deflect questions that would arise in middle America about a man living alone with his "young" ward.

The world over people know the song as:-</p>
<p>DER NER DER NER DER NER DER NER DER NER DER NER DER NER DER NER</p>
<p>BATMAN!- BATMAN!- BATMAN!</p>
<p>This has resulted in the joke, "How does Batman's mother tell him it's time for Dinner"?. "Dinner, Dinner, Dinner, Dinner, Dinner, Dinner, Dinner, Dinner, BATMAN!". As the joke has now become widely told and the answer is one of the most known, an alternate response to the joke is "Dinners ready, Batman".<br />
---<br /></p>
<p>I feel if we list one joke we have to list them all. And the joke is meaningless unless one is familiar with the theme song melody. We cannot assume this. Consider this a snap poll. Do you support or oppose this being included? I <b>oppose</b>. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 14:30, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

I <b>support</b>, we don't have to include all jokes if we include one. If that was true we'd have to mention every single thing that happens in the TV show if we mention some of it.Complete fabracation and nonsence! The wording describes the theme concept very well and then the joke, so one does not have to know it already to understand. It's very well written.</p>
<p><b>Support</b>, relevant to the pop culture of Batman. 69.204.6.21 22:06, 31 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I <b>support</b> this too. Important pop culture as this is a well known joke in many countries. I see someone has deleted it without talking on this page, that is vandalism. I have added it back in. <a href="../../../2/0/5/User%7E205.188.117.70.html" title="User:205.188.117.70">205.188.117.70</a> 15:51, 1 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I <b>oppose</b>. It looks really rough and does not fit with the tone of the rest of the article, nor with much of Wikipedia. There is a place for this joke, and it is not in the short section about the theme. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisGriswold_2071.html" title="User:ChrisGriswold">Chris Griswold</a> 06:51, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I <b>oppose</b>. I also <b><a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBOLD_e2a0.html" title="WP:BOLD">boldly</a></b> forged ahead, which seems especially legitimate given that the only "support" votes are anons. I rewrote the "theme song" section, giving it a more encyclopedic tone, and moved it down the page. I wasn't even aware of this vote when I did that, I admit, but I stand by it. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarryEyes_74d0.html" title="User:StarryEyes"><font color="#FF0000">Starry</font></a><a href="../../../s/t/a/User_talk%7EStarryEyes_a831.html" title="User talk:StarryEyes"><font color="#0000FF">Eyes</font></a> 17:11, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>P.S.</b> Here's how the section reads after my revision:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The title theme to Batman is one of the best-known theme tunes of all time. Composed by Neal Hefti, the song is built around a minimalistic and foreboding but catchy guitar hook reminiscent of spy film scores and surf music. It is a simple twelve bar blues progression using only three chords until the coda. The lyrics to the theme are sung by a female chorus and comprise ten repetitions of "Batman!" followed by a coda of "Dadadadadadadadadadadadada...Batman!"</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The famously minimal song has been widely parodied in the decades since its debut, and remains a prominent pop-culture subject to this day. The theme has been re-recorded by literally dozens of artists, the most notable including Link Wray, The Ventures, The Kinks, The Who, and The Jam. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarryEyes_74d0.html" title="User:StarryEyes"><font color="#FF0000">Starry</font></a><a href="../../../s/t/a/User_talk%7EStarryEyes_a831.html" title="User talk:StarryEyes"><font color="#0000FF">Eyes</font></a> 17:14, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I like it, with one adjustment: I have edited "literally dozens of artists" to say "countless artists." <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisGriswold_2071.html" title="User:ChrisGriswold">Chris Griswold</a> 02:17, 8 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hmmm...I'm not so sure "countless" is the right word, since I think, conceivably, they could be counted, with the help of the <a href="../../../a/l/l/All_Music_Guide_0e49.html" title="All Music Guide">All Music Guide</a>, for instance. Obviously such hyperbole is common in everyday discourse, but I'm not so sure about using it an encyclopedic context. I agree "literally dozens" does sound silly, so I'll change it back to just "dozens". Believe me, I do not want to start an edit war over so trivial a matter, and if you feel <i>really</i> strongly about "countless", by all means change it back. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarryEyes_74d0.html" title="User:StarryEyes"><font color="#FF0000">Starry</font></a><a href="../../../s/t/a/User_talk%7EStarryEyes_a831.html" title="User talk:StarryEyes"><font color="#0000FF">Eyes</font></a> 17:22, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't think you can count every recording of the song, even using the Internet. I am sure there have been lots of garage bands who have recorded the theme. Dozens works as well, though. "Literally" just sounded weird. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisGriswold_2071.html" title="User:ChrisGriswold">Chris Griswold</a> 02:17, 8 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Following in the footsteps of another editor earlier today, I have taken a knife to the trivia section, which had become loaded with POV, speculation, unsourced statements, unnecessary information, and information that belongs in the various movie articles. As it stands, I still think the section can be cut by another 1/3 to 1/2 easily. I have added "citation needed" tags to several statements that need sources as well. If no one adds sources for these, I'll delete them at a later date to tighten the section further. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 23:11, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>There is too much reliance on the word "campy" and the phrase "campy humor" in the article.
