<div class="dablink"><i>This article is about the term "batting order" as used in cricket. For other uses of the term, see <a href="../../../b/a/t/Batting_order.html" title="Batting order">Batting order</a>.</i></div>
<p>In <a href="../../../c/r/i/Cricket.html" title="Cricket">cricket</a>, the <b>batting order</b> is the sequence in which <a href="../../../b/a/t/Batsman.html" title="Batsman">batsmen</a> go to the <a href="../../../c/r/e/Crease.html" title="Crease">crease</a> to bat. All eleven players in a cricket side must bat, unless a <a href="../../../d/e/c/Declaration_and_forfeiture.html" title="Declaration and forfeiture">declaration</a> is made. The batting order is usually subdivided into:</p>
<ul>
<li>Opening batsmen or <i>openers</i> (the two batsmen who start, or open, the innings)</li>
<li>Upper or Top order (batsmen at positions three and four in the order)</li>
<li>Middle order (batsmen five to seven)</li>
<li>Lower order or <i>tail</i> (batsmen eight to eleven)</li>
</ul>
<p>The order in which the eleven players will bat is usually established prior to the commencement of a cricket match, but may be altered during play. The decision is based on factors such as each player's specialities, the position each batsman will feel most comfortable in, each player's skills and attributes as a batsman and possible combinations with other batsmen.</p>

<p>The <a href="../../../c/a/p/Captain_%28cricket%29.html" title="Captain (cricket)">captain</a> of the team can change the batting order during the game at their discretion. There are no rules about the nature or number of changes made, and if more than one <a href="../../../i/n/n/Innings.html" title="Innings">innings</a> is played the orders for each need not be the same. It has even been known for a captain to completely reverse his batting order for the second innings after <a href="../../../f/o/l/Following_on.html" title="Following on">following on</a>. This has made it possible for a bowler to take a <a href="../../../h/a/t/Hat-trick.html" title="Hat-trick">hat-trick</a> across three consecutive overs of a match, including the same batsman twice <sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>There are various reasons that the captain might make a change from the established order. Often, however, captains and coaches prefer not to adjust the batting order unless necessary as it can destabilise the team psychologically.</p>

<p>If the state of the game requires runs to be scored quickly, a captain will often promote a batsman who is known to score quickly up the order. This is usually a lower-order batsman, as their wicket is not regarded as being so valuable. A batsman who is promoted up the order with the intention of scoring quick runs is called a <a href="../../../p/i/n/Pinch_hitter.html" title="Pinch hitter">pinch hitter</a>.</p>

<p>When a wicket falls near the end of the day, a lower order (less capable) batsman might be sent in to bat, with the intention that the more capable players will be held in reserve till morning. The more capable players are then not exposed to the risk of dismissal while tired or in low-light conditions. The batsman who is sent in is known as the nightwatchman.</p>
<p><a name="Injury" id="Injury"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/t/Batting_order_%28cricket%29.html" title="Edit section: Injury">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Injury</span></h3>
<p>A batsman might be <a href="../../../i/n/j/Injury.html" title="Injury">injured</a> or unwell and unable to take his place in the batting order. The batsman may return further down the order if he recovers or if the situation of the game requires it. For example, if a game is nearly won and a top order batsman has a slight injury, then a few batsmen who usually bat lower than him in the order may go out to bat first. If they win the game, then the injured batsman's health was not further damaged. If however more wickets fall and he is able, the injured batsmen may then go out and try to score enough runs to win the game. In this case, he may opt to use a <a href="../../../r/u/n/Runner_%28cricket%29.html" title="Runner (cricket)">runner</a>.</p>
<p>In some circumstances, if a player has been off the field during the opposition's innings for a long time, then he is not allowed to come in to bat until a certain number of <a href="../../../o/v/e/Over_%28cricket%29.html" title="Over (cricket)">overs</a> have passed.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/t/Batting_order_%28cricket%29.html" title="Edit section: Opening batsmen or openers">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Opening batsmen or openers</span></h2>
<p>The opening <a href="../../../b/a/t/Batsmen.html" title="Batsmen">batsmen</a> or openers are the batsmen who "open" the <a href="../../../i/n/n/Innings.html" title="Innings">innings</a>. The position is important as the openers must get the innings off to a good start. The early fall of <a href="../../../w/i/c/Wickets.html" title="Wickets">wickets</a> can have a psychological impact on the rest of the team, affecting their performance with the bat. The opening batsmen also get the first experience of the <a href="../../../c/r/i/Cricket_pitch.html" title="Cricket pitch">pitch</a> and conditions, and must be able to adjust to them quickly.</p>
<p>Most importantly, the opening batsmen must face a new <a href="../../../c/r/i/Cricket_ball.html" title="Cricket ball">ball</a>, which is hard and has a pronounced seam. This makes it more liable to travel fast, bounce high, <a href="../../../s/e/a/Seam_bowling.html" title="Seam bowling">seam</a> around (bounce unpredictably off the seam) and <a href="../../../s/w/i/Swing_bowling.html" title="Swing bowling">swing</a> (deviate sideways when travelling through the air). These early conditions favour the bowling team, so the opening batsmen should have a strong technique and be good defensively. As the ball gets older, its condition starts to favour the batting team. Therefore, the openers will ideally stay at the <a href="../../../c/r/e/Crease.html" title="Crease">crease</a> long enough to protect the batsmen further down the order.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../f/i/r/First-class_cricket.html" title="First-class cricket">First-class cricket</a>, the rate at which the openers score runs is not as important as "taking the shine off" the new ball. This is the process of softening and roughening the <a href="../../../c/r/i/Cricket_ball.html" title="Cricket ball">cricket ball</a>. By occupying the crease for a long time and taking the shine off the ball, the openers themselves are able to score more freely later on. This also makes batting easier for the rest of the order. Because of the defensive technique required early on, openers traditionally have been less fluent stroke-players than the specialist batsmen who follow. An example of a classic opener in this mould was <a href="../../../g/e/o/Geoffrey_Boycott_aad2.html" title="Geoffrey Boycott">Geoffrey Boycott</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../l/i/m/Limited_overs_cricket.html" title="Limited overs cricket">limited overs cricket</a>, the role of opening batsman is slightly different. In this type of cricket a high <a href="../../../r/u/n/Run_rate.html" title="Run rate">run rate</a> a necessity. Also, in the early 1990s, <a href="../../../f/i/e/Fielding_restrictions_%28cricket%29.html" title="Fielding restrictions (cricket)">fielding restrictions</a> were introduced in the early overs of the game, limiting the fielding side to only two players on the <a href="../../../b/o/u/Boundary_%28cricket%29.html" title="Boundary (cricket)">boundary</a>. To start the innings effectively and take advantage of the fielding restrictions, it became beneficial to have an aggressive batsman opening the batting.</p>
<p><a href="../../../m/a/r/Martin_Crowe_da69.html" title="Martin Crowe">Martin Crowe</a>'s <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Zealand_cricket_team_b7ed.html" title="New Zealand cricket team">New Zealand</a> team in the <a href="../../../1/9/9/1992_Cricket_World_Cup_8217.html" title="1992 Cricket World Cup">1992 World Cup</a> took to promoting <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mark_Greatbatch_23b1.html" title="Mark Greatbatch">Mark Greatbatch</a> up the order to take this role. <a href="../../../i/a/n/Ian_Botham_39d4.html" title="Ian Botham">Ian Botham</a> undertook the same role for England in that competition. After <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sanath_Jayasuriya_1ead.html" title="Sanath Jayasuriya">Sanath Jayasuriya</a> and <a href="../../../r/o/m/Romesh_Kaluwitharana_8c4a.html" title="Romesh Kaluwitharana">Romesh Kaluwitharana</a> destroyed bowling attacks in the <a href="../../../1/9/9/1996_Cricket_World_Cup_224f.html" title="1996 Cricket World Cup">1996 World Cup</a> through aggressive batting in the first 15 <a href="../../../o/v/e/Overs.html" title="Overs">overs</a>, the position of one-day opener began to be regarded as one reserved for individuals capable of clean hitting against fast bowling.</p>
<p><a name="Top_order" id="Top_order"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/t/Batting_order_%28cricket%29.html" title="Edit section: Top order">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Top order</span></h2>
<p>The batsmen who bat at positions 3 and 4 in the order are typically the most technically proficient batsmen with the best stroke play. As they are likely to face an older ball that is easier to score runs against, they must aim to make a large number of runs. They may be exposed to the new ball if an opener loses his wicket early on, and so must be equipped to deal with this scenario as well.</p>
<p><a name="Middle_order" id="Middle_order"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/t/Batting_order_%28cricket%29.html" title="Edit section: Middle order">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Middle order</span></h2>
<p>The middle order usually consists of versatile batsmen who must continue to build an innings. Again, defensive abilities are crucial and it is likely they will face a much older ball bowled by a <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spin_bowling.html" title="Spin bowling">spin bowler</a>. Middle order players should also be adept at making runs when playing with the poor quality batsmen in the lower order.</p>
<p><a name="Lower_order_or_tail" id="Lower_order_or_tail"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/t/Batting_order_%28cricket%29.html" title="Edit section: Lower order or tail">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Lower order or tail</span></h2>
<p>The lower order is made up of players who have poor or average batting skill. These players are probably part of the team for their ability as <a href="../../../b/o/w/Bowler_%28cricket%29.html" title="Bowler (cricket)">bowlers</a> or wicketkeepers, rather than batting. Therefore the start of the lower order may vary in position depending on the balance of the side.</p>
<p>Low-order batsmen are known as tail-enders. Particularly weak batsmen are known as <a href="../../../r/a/b/Rabbit_%28cricket%29.html" title="Rabbit (cricket)">rabbits</a>, bunnies or <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_cricket_terms.html#F" title="List of cricket terms">ferrets</a>.</p>
<p>It is likely that these batsmen will be dismissed for low scores. However, as expectations on these players are low when they are batting, they often play aggressive, carefree shots in the hope of achieving as many runs as possible. On occasion, the scores posted by the lower order have made a difference to the outcome of a Test match. If a significant contribution has come from the tail-enders, the tail is said to have "wagged".</p>
