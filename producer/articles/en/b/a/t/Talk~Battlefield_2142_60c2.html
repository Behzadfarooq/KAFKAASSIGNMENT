<p>Which parts in particular are you talking about? It would be much more helpful to give specifics (as the majority of the article has cited its sources). Also your edit comment about changing the last unamed guy's comment about the AED into something more factual is slightly inccorect. I wrote almost the entire weapons section and reorganized it (and to be precise, you didn't change it to be more factual, you just added additional content). <a href="../../../e/c/h/User%7EEcho.brian_3ebd.html" title="User:Echo.brian">Echo.brian</a> 00:54, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Okay pheasant. You're edit was not much of a change of mine, it just mainly added one slightly insignificant fact and removed a different fact. But kept the same combat unfavorable system the same. And, the section that needs clean up IS the weapon system. So now I know where all these terrible and poor quality spelling and grammar came from. Some notes are: It's EU not Eu and PAC not Pac (check 2142's main page for that). It's shield, not sheild, etc. Please review the section before you add poor quality sections. There are other parts of the article that need improvement in general, but the weapon section is the worst. --<span style="font-family:'Script MT Bold'"><b><a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_Pembroke_734a.html" title="User:William Pembroke"><span style="color:Cyan">William</span> <span style="color:Grey">Pembroke</span></a></b></span><span style="font-family:'times new roman'"><sup><a href="../../../w/i/l/User_talk%7EWilliam_Pembroke_f226.html" title="User talk:William Pembroke">(talk)</a></sup></span> 04:07, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Then perhaps instead of attacking me you'd care to actually do something about the grammar and spelling. Excuse me for relying on others to catch my typos. And if the weapons section is the one that needs cleanup, then why did you add the tag over the entire article? By the way, I edited your addition becuase it had poor grammar (perhaps the reason you feel the need to criticize my own grammar is because yours is not much better). Look, I'll go back today and try to clean up the spelling and other mistakes.

<p>After reviewing the first few paragraphs, I found only 1 or 2 minor grammatical mistakes, mainly from the use of parentheses. Although, I do not feel that going through the entire section to correct a few inconsistencies is worth my time, so I added a tag for someone else to do the work (if they really feel that it needs cleanup).

<p>I removed the Clan section because it pretty much serves no purpose except to advertise for clans.

<p>I've never played 2142, but in the section describing player ranks, the last two ranks, General Special, and Commander Special, don't have a point value next to them. Shold there be one?</p>
<p>No, the "special" is not supposed to be part of the name (I can see where that is confusing).

<li>Create a heading called "Criticisms" and make subheadings for "In-game advertising", "Widescreen support", and "Bugs".</li>
<li>Shorten the "Bugs" subheading to be a summary - an exhaustive description of complaints about the game is unwarranted. People can go read the forum if they care that much.</li>
<li>Shorten the heading on pre-order bonuses and place it under Criticisms.</li>
<li>Expand Gameplay heading to more thoroughly describe conquest and titan modes, contrast them.</li>
<li>Make a new heading called Player tracking or similar to describe how the servers keep track of all of your stats.</li>

<p>I'm going to propose that the unlock table be removed. I have nothing against it, but it makes the article into a game guide again. A neutral bystander who has no idea what Bf2142 is would not know what that equipment table means, and therefore it is only useful to players of the game, making it a game guide (excuse the run on sentence). I know this makes me a hypocrit, but since this was found to be superflous before, it probably will still be considered excess. Instead, I suggest that the unlocks table be removed and the information should be more clearly stated in the kit section (since the items are already listed there but with short descriptions). perhaps the unlocks for the kits should be removed from the kit section, the table should be removed, and the information shuld be summarized in 5 or less sentences udner the unlocks heading.<a href="../../../e/c/h/User%7EEcho.brian_3ebd.html" title="User:Echo.brian">Echo.brian</a> 21:09, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I just noticed on the picture caption for the PAC BattleWalker that it uses the phrase "A PAC Bogatyr", which is correct, however in the context it seems that "A PAC BattleWalker" would be less confusing (since the Bogatyr is not mentioned in the section). Perhaps "A PAC Bogatyr BattleWalker" would fit best. The picture could also be moved to the vehicles section to fit the context better and another picture could be placed in its stead?<a href="../../../e/c/h/User%7EEcho.brian_3ebd.html" title="User:Echo.brian">Echo.brian</a> 23:52, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I went ahead and and moved the picture of the Bogatyr into the vehicle section (and added another picture as well). I couldn't integrate into the text very well, so the section probably needs reformatting to make it fit (or revert the page if there are too many pictures). I left the text caption the way it was since it fits in the context.<a href="../../../e/c/h/User%7EEcho.brian_3ebd.html" title="User:Echo.brian">Echo.brian</a> 00:47, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Is this truly necessary? I'm seriously contemplating on whether or not to remove it, it seems to add more of a game guide then an actual article. <span style="font-family:'Script MT Bold'"><b><a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_Pembroke_734a.html" title="User:William Pembroke"><span style="color:Cyan">William</span> <span style="color:Grey">Pembroke</span></a></b></span><span style="font-family:'times new roman'"><sup><a href="../../../w/i/l/User_talk%7EWilliam_Pembroke_f226.html" title="User talk:William Pembroke">(talk)</a></sup></span> 03:24, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'm not quite sure. It's not really a gameguide in that it doesn't help players play the game, yet the info technically isn't necessary. I guess it just shows the types of vehicles in the game and attempts to describe them. People who don't know about the game might be curious about the types of vehicles though (maybe the section should be changed to paragraph form?). In comparing the section to the BF2 equivalent article, it seems like it is less game guide like (the bf2 describes the ways to destroy vehicles and health bars etc.).<a href="../../../e/c/h/User%7EEcho.brian_3ebd.html" title="User:Echo.brian">Echo.brian</a> 04:03, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>I don't think BF2142 supports true widescreen -ever-. You can only trick it into cropping top/bottom. There was a huge debate on the EA forums asking for it, but EA just said "No." and closed down the 10-20 page thread begging for widescreen --70.171.27.13 23:24, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Sorry it took me so long to get back to you, but I've been busy. I see that David has gone over a few things I missed (thanks David!). Here are some other things that I noticed:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>I still think that <i>It is the first Battlefield game not to feature the United States of America as a playable military faction</i> is not nearly notable enough to merit a mention in the lead. Move it to gameplay if you so wish.</li>
<li>As for the images, I think they could be rearranged to better match the sections they appear in. I would move the GUI image up to where the "Titan assault scenario" image is currently, and move the latter down to where the "support soldier crouching behind a shield" image is now. That image could be moved down a bit.</li>
<li><i>As of January 18, 2007, Electronic Arts has announced that it will release the Northern Strike booster pack for the Battlefield 2142 game.</i> Revise this to say: "On January 18, 2007, Electronic Arts announced that it will release a booster pack titled <i>Northern Strike</i> for <i>Battlefield 2142</i>.</li>
<li><i>In the public beta release of v1.20, the BFHQ page is updated with Northern Strike unlocks and awards, and the pin mentioned is the Assault Lines Pin.</i> Can you clarify this? I have no idea what you're trying to say here.</li>
<li>All of the image captions should end with a period. As well, the Hachimoto image caption should be reworded to identify that it's from the booster pack, and the billboard image should be reworded to identify that it's from Armored Fury.</li>
<li><i>Amazon.com also offered the free 64MB dog tag styled flash drive with a pre-order.</i> Citation needed.</li>
<li><i>Players who pre-ordered Battlefield 2142 from Game Stop received a free in-game rank. This rank was stackable with the Battlefield 2 Veteran's Program promotion, allowing players to receive two ranks upon release of the retail game.</i> Citation needed here as well.</li>
<li><i>The expansion will add three new vehicles: the FAV Hachimoto for the PAC, the IFV Goliath for the EU, and the Mk.7 Titan for both coalitions, set to be announced in early February.</i> What is set to be announced in February? I thought the booster pack was announced on Janurary 17th. As an additional note, the vehicles probably don't need to be wikilinked, as it's pretty unlikely that they'll ever have their own articles.</li>
<li>There is a gap of white space between the "Titan" and "Statistics tracking" sections. Remove this.</li>
<li><i>Battlefield 2142 was officially announced and playable at E3.</i> Reword again (sorry) to say: "Battlefield 2142 was officially announced and playable at that year's E3 convention." (and wikilink E3.)</li>
<li><i>When the hull of the Titan fails, a 20-second abandon ship timer is triggered, allowing players to evacuate the Titan before it is completely destroyed and avoid dying in the ensuing explosion. During the beta release of the game, there was an award for those who managed to escape the destroyed Titan before the 20-second timer ends. In the retail game, the round ends when the Titan is destroyed, and because player deaths triggered by the end of a round do not count, the evacuation is entirely for inducing a rush in the player.</i> Citations needed here as well (it's a running theme, I know.)</li>
<li><i>The PAC has set up strongholds in the urban areas left abandoned because of the war. The EU launches an offensive to take back its land from PAC.</i> Reword to "The PAC has set up strongholds in the urban areas left abandoned because of the war, and the EU launches an offensive to take back its land from the PAC."</li>
<li>I think what David meant about fair use rationales is that this article needs <i>more detailed</i> ones. As David said, look at the rationales on the <a href="../../../h/a/l/Halo_2.html" title="Halo 2">Halo 2</a> article, and you'll find that they have more detail and are more properly worded.</li>

<p>Ok, I have a few concerns with this article:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, the lead. <i>Battlefield 2142 is a first-person shooter computer game designed by Digital Illusions CE and is the fifth game in the series. It is set in the 22nd century, during a new ice age. Currently, there have been over one million rounds played since its release.[1] It is the first Battlefield game not to feature the United States of America as a playable military faction.</i> et al. Ok, first, the beginning paragraph seems kind of clumsy, with It is... It is... repetition. The second paragraph seems to just talk about multiplayer, not giving much info on what the game is about, interesting features, etc.</li>
<li>"<i>Battlefield 2142 uses a modified, critically acclaimed, engine of Battlefield 2 and is the first game in the series to not include the United States as a playable faction.</i>" - source needed for both parts of that sentence.</li>
<li>Soldier Kits section- merge into gameplay and expand; right now it has little context.</li>
<li>Some dates need to be linked. See <a href="../../../d/a/t/WP%7EDATE_3c44.html" title="WP:DATE">WP:DATE</a>. (ex: expansion packs section.)</li>
<li>Rumors of development- it's been released, so why are they rumors?</li>
<li>All images need fair use rationale. See the images of <i><a href="../../../h/a/l/Halo_2.html" title="Halo 2">Halo 2</a></i> for an example of what I mean.</li>
<li>Image captions: lots of the captions don't have any context. What the hell is a Hachimoto? I can assume its some type of vehicle, but point is its pointless there if you've never played BF2142.</li>
<li>Beta release: fold into development.</li>
<li>Perhaps fold the advertising into reception?</li>
</ul>

<dl>
<dd>Did most of your request, but the fair use was already on the images and the beginning paragraph is fine in my opinion as well as the advertising. Good suggestions however, I did about seventy percent of what you suggested. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_Pembroke_734a.html" title="User:William Pembroke"><font face="French Script MT" size="4">Pem</font></a><a href="../../../w/i/l/User_talk%7EWilliam_Pembroke_f226.html" title="User talk:William Pembroke"><font face="French Script MT" size="4">bro</font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_William_Pembroke_c668.html" title="Special:Contributions/William Pembroke"><font face="French Script MT" size="4">ke</font></a> 23:04, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>The paragraph describes what a Hachimoto is (the picture is merely labeled so as to reference the paragraph). What should be put in its place? A paragraph description? (that's what the section is for) I took out the part about it carrying a squad (there are only 2 soldiers, and "squad" may be misleading to think that there are more).<a href="../../../e/c/h/User%7EEcho.brian_3ebd.html" title="User:Echo.brian">Echo.brian</a> 20:42, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>How 'bout my second round of comments above? This has gotten complicated, as technically I am the one responsible for passing the article, because I took up GA reviewing it first. The article should not have been "un-held" until I either passed or failed the article (although David caught a lot of things that I missed and probably wouldn't have noticed, which is always nice). Anywho, that's in the past, and I await the implementation of my other comments. Hope this works for you. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreen451_48b7.html" title="User:Green451">Green451</a> 03:09, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Can someone tell me where to find the release dates for northern strike on the EA website, i couldnt find it and it seems odd to me that they would release it on the 16/3 as stated in this article when the anniversary of the battle for the bridge at remagen is on the 7/3.</p>
<dl>
<dd>The preload is on March 1st. No release date has been announced, and I highly doubt it is the 16th. The announced Rolling Thunder tourney by EA is set for the 18th which is only two days after the 16th.--Arrowhead2006 04:10, 1 March 2007 (UTC)

<p>I'm from Melbourne, Australia, and as such i never had the in-game billboards...but i was shocked to come across an add for Intel in Northern Strike, i was under the impression that there were laws preventing this in Australia. I assume this has something to do with the fact that i downloaded it from EA Link rather then bought it locally, but wouldnt the laws still cover this? if anyone has an answer for this i'd love to hear it. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_202.4.74.65_179c.html" title="Special:Contributions/202.4.74.65">202.4.74.65</a> (<a href="../../../2/0/2/User_talk%7E202.4.74.65.html" title="User talk:202.4.74.65">talk</a>) 13:39, 11 March 2007 (UTC).</small></p>
<p>They should, technically, but if EA was confident enough to stick in-game ads in with Northern Strike, then they may have found a way around that law. I'd hate to try your luck in court though.--JavaJawaUK 11:25, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>To add a one sentence description of each map [excluding Titan maps] to the maps section. It wouldn't consume much space and would help expand on some of the settings, eg:</p>
<p>Belgrade - Constricted, close-quarters combat set in a conurbation of the Serbian capital. Battles in the central park can be intense and shifting</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>Shuhia Taiba - Vehicle dominated combat on an EU farming project. A mountain complex in the center of the map makes for a heated battle.</p>

<p>I agree this is a good idea, but one warning... It would be ill considered to attempt to describe strategy or combat regarding these maps.

<p>Maybe, maybe not. The point is there is no assertion by EA or DICE in or out of game as to the likelihood of that so it doesn't belong on Wikipedia.
