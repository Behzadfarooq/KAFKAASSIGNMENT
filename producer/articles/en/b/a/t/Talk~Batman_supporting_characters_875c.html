<p>I don't believe characters like Harvey Bullock are considered part of the Batman Family. When the series was published, it essentially covered Batman, Robin, Batgirl, and Alfred. The majority of characters on the list are supporting characters, of which, Batman Family is only a subset. The proposed merge was for Supporting characters of Batman; I'm not sure why it was moved here instead. Because it seems arbitrary and not in keeping with the original merge notice nor any sort of concensus, I am moving it to the proper location. --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisGriswold_2071.html" title="User:ChrisGriswold">Chris Griswold</a> 06:53, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Why exactly was this moved before consensus was reached here, less than a day after the discussion was opened?

<dd>At any rate -- I agree with Ipstenu, that the name should remain at Batman Family. I believe this term is far more inclusive than just the inner-circle, and is not the subset, but the umbrella title. <a href="../../../c/s/4/User%7ECS42_8631.html" title="User:CS42">~CS</a> 09:50, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm moving it back. Chris, this was Bold but you didn't really give anyone but you or me time to say anything, which was impolite, nor did you call for votes. The fact that we ended up with Batman Family after the merge of the two articles is fair evidence that the title that (currently) won out was BF.

<dd>I agree with Chris' proposal of making the pagename <a href="../../../b/a/t/Batman_supporting_characters.html" title="Batman supporting characters">Batman supporting characters</a> rather than <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supporting_characters_of_Batman_0771.html" title="Supporting characters of Batman">Supporting characters of Batman</a>, however. The later uses a strange possessive voice that doesn't make sense for a fictional character, and the former puts the primary subject as the first word of the article. <a href="../../../c/s/4/User%7ECS42_8631.html" title="User:CS42">~CS</a> 19:41, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>To recap what was said before: Although I can work with it either way, I do believe that "Batman Family" is a more inclusive term than Chris Griswold does. It is not limited to the close group of regulars (Robin, Nightwing, Alfred, Oracle, et al) but also includes the extended network (Gordon, Bullock, Fox, Thompkins). Since this term "Batman Family" exists, I think it works better than a generic title. <a href="../../../c/s/4/User%7ECS42_8631.html" title="User:CS42">~CS</a> 19:34, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I feel that, since the term is so popular, that it's logically the first place one looks for the supporting characters. It's like a disambig link: if the first 'batman' that comes to mind is the superhero and not the officer's assistant, then the main link should be for the hero. Same with Batman Family. I think it's a broad and inclusive term that can expand to cover the cops and others. -- <font color="green"><b><a href="../../../i/p/s/User%7EIpstenu_5894.html" title="User:Ipstenu">Ipstenu</a></b> <i>(<a href="../../../i/p/s/User_talk%7EIpstenu_7a4a.html" title="User talk:Ipstenu">talk</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ipstenu_a5b5.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ipstenu">contribs</a>)</i></font> 20:40, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I too feel that the article should be about the comic book series of the same name, while a "Batman supporting characters" article should cover those characters that have been part of the mythos without being important enough to deserve their own wikipedia articles. (Bullock, Vesper Fairchild, etc.) I've never seen the heroes of Gotham City call themselves "Batman Family" (even if technically some of them are, due to their emotional relationships.) We should go what's official in the comics. The article should have links to other Gotham heroes, however, in the "See Also" section. - <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilfredo_Martinez_bee1.html" title="User:Wilfredo Martinez">Wilfredo Martinez</a> 02:51, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I do like the theme of similarly-composed pictures of an embrace and a kiss flowing down the page, however. Perhaps someone could scan the picture of Talia in BATMAN #244 ("The Demon Lives Again") to continue the flow? <a href="../../../c/s/4/User%7ECS42_8631.html" title="User:CS42">~CS</a> 16:17, 5 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Okay, but then we end up with WAY too many images on the page. Again. So it sort of sounds like your contradicting yourself. Catwoman is perennial, and if we put in Talia, we should take out Sasha. Also, I think the movie still is a better juxtaposition than the Hush image, since if shows you Bruce/Selina, which is a much a fuction of their relationship as Batman/Catwoman. -- <font color="green"><b><a href="../../../i/p/s/User%7EIpstenu_5894.html" title="User:Ipstenu">Ipstenu</a></b> <i>(<a href="../../../i/p/s/User_talk%7EIpstenu_7a4a.html" title="User talk:Ipstenu">talk</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ipstenu_a5b5.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ipstenu">contribs</a>)</i></font></dd>

<dd>I was thinking exactly what Carnyfoke suggests below: The B:TAS image seems awkward to me, and it could be replaced with a good picture of Talia. I'm ambivalent about the Sasha picture -- I do like the image itself, but disagree with Carnyfoke that she's one of three most important relationships, but the fact that it's the most recent might mean its deserving of its spot. As far as the movie still goes, I don't think it works visually -- all I see are two actors in a scene that could be from any movie. <a href="../../../c/s/4/User%7ECS42_8631.html" title="User:CS42">~CS</a> 05:06, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't know. It seems kinda unfair to have two Catwoman images and not have one referencing the relationship that Batman most likely had a child with (Talia). Can't we just replace the B:TAS Bat/Cat pic with one (a good one) of Talia? I believe that the three most important relationships that Bats has ever had are Sasha, Talia, and Selina, as they have had the greatest impact on the character and his history. So I'm of the opinion that all three should have pics up. --Carnyfoke 02:13, 6 September 2006 (UTC)Carnyfoke</dd>

<dd>I was just trying to get images to reflect the multiple media incarnation of Bats+Cats. And I would have said the most important love interests are Selina and Talia only. Sasha's not got that much history behind her (only a few RL years), when you look at decades for Selina. And yeah, Talia too. But if someone dropped of comic for ten years, Sasha remains a 'who the hell?' She's not even showing up in Bats anymore, even as a guest. She's only important cause she's recent, I feel. Selina and Talia, yes. Wonder Woman ... there was one issue and while my fangirl heart adores that idea *hee!*, it's not canon and not 'big' so no image. -- <font color="green"><b><a href="../../../i/p/s/User%7EIpstenu_5894.html" title="User:Ipstenu">Ipstenu</a></b> <i>(<a href="../../../i/p/s/User_talk%7EIpstenu_7a4a.html" title="User talk:Ipstenu">talk</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ipstenu_a5b5.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ipstenu">contribs</a>)</i></font> 11:34, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The little links that someone put in to replace the Poison Ivy books referenced in the Love Interests section don't work. Could somebody fix them so that they do? Or maybe just bring the original Ivy book references back? --71.110.16.11 02:47, 6 September 2006 (UTC)Carnyfoke</p>

<p>At this point I feel it is presumptive to conclude that all of Cass's behavior OYL are attributed to the drugging by Deathstroke. Setting aside arguments that she may be injected with other materials other than that of Rose and/or Rose's own abilites to fight her father's chemical and Machivellian manipulation, mind control does not necessarily yield that she is not still innately evil. Cassie could still be the killer leader of the League of Assassins and was brainwashed/drugged to pull her away from the group. In short, until we see conclusively that she is not acting of her own fruition for EVERYTHING OYL, we shouldn't attribute Slade as the sole cause. <a href="../../../6/6/2E/User%7E66.109.248.114.html" title="User:66.109.248.114">66.109.248.114</a></p>
