<p>Indian casualties at the Little Big Horn were much higher than written in the Wikipedia article. New discoveries in Indian testimonies point at least 200 dead warriors. See the Friends of the Little Big Horn newspaper:</p>
<p><b>Cook also pointed to red pin flags in the ground. He said I’d be able to spot them throughout the area; they represent recent research for locations of fallen warriors. He warned me to be prepared for high numbers. I’ve always believed that number to be near 100. He said there were approximately 200 pin flags. If this turns out to be true (still more research is required by Chief Historian John Doerner), then it is evidence that the 7th Cavalry fought hard (just as the Indian accounts have always stated). Most importantly, it contradicts recent theories that this battle was one of massive soldier disintegration and command structure breakdown. There may be as many dead warriors upon this field as there were soldiers, a result that is relatively impossible if soldiers are running and throwing their weapons away at the same time.</b> <a href="http://www.friendslittlebighorn.com/Members.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.friendslittlebighorn.com/Members.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.friendslittlebighorn.com/Members.htm</a></p>
<p>It's all right with Indian testimonies which always told us about a great and very hard battle (some Indians even said that the battle was not decided until the very end of the fight, for example Sitting Bull said that he had no idea of the outcome of the fight. The Sioux chief also said that Custer was always looking at the east, for support by Benteen and Reno (a support that never came - a military betrayal), and was fighting as hard as a human can do (Rain In the Face, Iron Hawk, Low Dog and many many others, see Gregory Michno's excellent book "Lakota Noon" (Mountain Press, 1997).

<p>The rivers, mountains, and county were originally named after a <b>horn</b>, not a sheep. The name had nothing to do with Bighorn sheep or big horns. The river it flows into was the <b>Horn River</b> initially. That was okay. Then the tributary <b>Little Horn</b> was named.</p>
<p>Still okay, but then the confusion started: in response to <b>Little Horn</b>, the <b>Horn</b> began to be called the <b>Big Horn</b>. Then (of course!?) the <b>Little Horn</b> had to be called the <b>Little <i>Big</i> Horn</b>. Well, everybody around there understood that. The mountains nearby that were the source of much of the water of the system were named the <b>Big Horn Mountains</b>. The county where the Big Horn and the Little Big Horn converge was named <b>Big Horn</b> county. But sometime after that.....</p>
<p>...some (probably)pointy-headed non-local person who only knew about the Battle, said "hey, that must be the sheep name, bighorn, written incorrectly by these ignorant westerners." (okay, I'm making up some of this scenario.) So the people who write books began to use <b>Bighorn</b> instead of <b>Big Horn.</b> So you will see <b>old</b> books and sources say <b>Big Horn</b> River, <b>Big Horn</b> Mountains, and Little <b>Big Horn</b> River. Meanwhile, <b>new</b> books and maps are usually using <b>Bighorn</b> for the rivers and some other features. Here is an illustration: at <a href="http://www.fs.fed.us/r2/bighorn/|" class="external text" title="http://www.fs.fed.us/r2/bighorn/|" rel="nofollow">Bighorn National Forest</a> is the US Forest service stuff on <b>Bighorn</b> National Forest, a more recent naming.

<p>The number on the indian side is very exaggerated. If it was 5000 then the whole dakota nation would be present, and its proven that the majority was home. The true number is 1,200. I also corrected the numbers on the US side (Source&#160;: Centennial campaign by John S.Gray)</p>
<dl>
<dd>5000 was the entire Dakota (i.e. Sioux--which is a misnomer anyway) population? How do you come by this?--Buckboard 08:04, 22 March 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>While 5000 is certainly too high, WADR the 1200 would be at the extreme low end of present estimates, and the Gray reference is now pretty dated. See Michno's Lakota Noon, or Bruce Liddic's recent book. Most current sources come in between 1700 and 2000. US estimates are best given by Nichols in Men with Custer, 2000; that would be about 750 men in the regiment, independent of civilians and scouts. The latter two categories would add another 30 MOL, for a total of 780. Best wishes, Seesdifferent 24.182.100.66 18:27, 5 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"The U.S. cavalry detachment commanded by Lt. Col. George Armstrong Custer was killed to the last man, but overall, the majority of soldiers survived the fight."

<p>Someone had changed the body count of the Native American casualties from about 40 to about 200. I had never heard of this count and have always heard 40.

<dd>The National Park Service, administrators of the Little Bighorn Battlefield National Monument, has made this statement on their website (and a similar one in their brochures)— "An accurate count of the Sioux and Cheyenne dead was not possible, but at least 60 are known to have died." Hence, the 40 figure is too low, and the 200 is too high.

<dd>The 40 is originally based on Lakota and Cheyenne accounts of dead ("lists of the dead") taken away and buried. But there were also a number left on the field and unrecoverable when the encampment broke up and fled on the approach of Terry.--Buckboard 07:59, 22 March 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>"a number left on the field and unrecoverable when the encampment broke up and fled on the approach of Terry"? I find this not very credible. The "wolves" anounced Terry's coming long in advance. How much time elapsed between the departure of the Indians and Terry's arrival? Half a day? More? There were many hours time to recover the slain. "Leave no man behind" is a concept more American than many Americans are aware of. Even under the most dangerous battle circumstances Indians often risked and sometimes lost their lives to prevent the body of a slain warrior from falling into enemy hands. This had religious and metaphysical reasons. You entered the next world just as you left the last one: in one piece or not quite so. The latter option was worse than death itself and in fact the reason why enemies were often mutilated after killing them. Killing an enemy and not mutilating him meant chasing them at your ancestors who already lived in the afterworld. Only mutilation neutralized the threat to your deceased loved-ones. For the mutilated warrior, in turn this meant eternal life as a physical wreck. Ample reason to recover any slain warrior, even when under fire - which was not the case here between the Battle and Terry's arrival. Lookoo, 21:11 CET, 17 May 2006</dd>

<p>I just watched an excellent TV documentary in Australia called Battlefield detectives.

<p>Sorry I should have added that the documentary ststed the Native americans were armed with over 200 repeating Henry rifles (not Spencer and winchester). They claim the rifles were the decisive factor in the victory - 13 shots in 30 seconds as opposed to 4 in 30 seconds for 7 Cav rifles. So the main article is wrong when it says "some of the Indians were armed with repeating Spencer and Winchester rifles". 200 is quite significant and they actually found forensic evidence of the 200 weapons.

<p>I have removed bolding from Pvt Taylor's quote because by having it bold...and the only quote in the whole article bold, at that...it seems to me to provide obvious bias and violates NPOV. To include the quote is historically justifiable, but not to give it undue prominence. One Private's viewpoint, when he may or may not have seen or understood the bigger picture, including Custer's own planning failures, does not a condemnation make. I have also added information about Reno and Benteens suspicion that they had been abandoned by Custer as he had previously done to Major Elliot at Washita. For more on this, please also refer to the edits I've made to the <a href="../../../f/r/e/Frederick_Benteen_ee29.html" title="Frederick Benteen">Frederick Benteen</a> entry, including its discussion page.</p>

<dd>It's not just the word of a "disgruntled" pvt. (Has anybody ever heard of a "gruntled" comment?) Sklenar's <i>To Hell With Honor</i> (OK U Press, 2000) makes a good case Benteen &amp; Reno were incompetent or cowardly, or both, &amp; failed to support Custer.

<p>I removed the Pvt. Taylor quote because it distorts the article with a pro-Custer bias. There are many quotes trashing Custer that could be included but should not because it skews the article with the opposite bias. Larry Sklenar’s sole work is filled with blatant hero-worship and hypothetical leaps that are not substantiated. Although it is hard to understand how Miles reached his conclusions after studying the battlefield a year after the battle, I left the quote in as it does not effect the description of the battle.Grahamboat 16:40, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm writing some biographical pages on the main participants, and have noticed this list's rather inconsistant usage of middle names. Since the articles end up using these links, what's the consenses on middle names in article titles? Should they be used or dropped or just the initials used? For instance, should Dr. DeWolf's biography be as 'James Madison DeWolf', 'James M. DeWolf', 'James DeWolf', or 'Dr. James DeWolf'? <a href="../../../c/f/l/User%7ECFLeon_0a91.html" title="User:CFLeon">CFLeon</a> 00:19, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have written dozens of Civil War biographies, and I asked the same questions a couple of years ago. I found that the normal convention for most ACW bios was "First M. Last," although this at times needs adjusted when ambiguity exists. It's also not common to include the rank or occupation in the article title unless it adds clarity to a specific person, and then, it's common to do so in parentheses—<a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Pope_%28military_officer%29_8d50.html" title="John Pope (military officer)">John Pope (military officer)</a> and <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Griffin_%28general%29_2349.html" title="Charles Griffin (general)">Charles Griffin (general)</a>.

<dd>Thanks for the answer. Dr. DeWolf may have been a poor example, since I had already used the full middle name.

<p>I'm planning to put up a page on this topic, but is this the best title? I really can't think of a better one that gets the idea across, and while "Little Big Horn Survivors" or "Survivors of the Battle of the Little BigHorn" may be more accurate or less clumsy grammatically, they may be too wordy for an article title. What do you think, people? <a href="../../../c/f/l/User%7ECFLeon_0a91.html" title="User:CFLeon">CFLeon</a> 09:43, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Keep in mind that "survivors of the Battle of the Little Bighorn" would technically encompass all the Indians who lived, as well as most of Reno and Benteen's columns, as the Reno fight was indeed a part of the battle. A better title might be Army survivors of Custer's last stand, and then you begin to drop into speculation, rumors, wild claims, publicity seekers, etc. I'm not sure any of them deserve an encylopedia article devoted to the topic. However CFLeon, you seem to have an impressive interest level in the topic and time to research the subject matter, so I have no strong opinion. Any other thoughts out there on this proposed article? <a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScott_Mingus_78b1.html" title="User:Scott Mingus">Scott Mingus</a> 11:31, 17 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I actually would prefer putting the topic as a subsection on this page, but the main article is too cluttered as it is. I agree that probably no one particular individual is worth an entry (except perhaps Nathan Short and the Edgar Rice Burroughs story), but I think the phenomenon itself is and putting up an entry will cover the aspects you are mentioning. At the moment, I'm seriously considering putting it up as "Custer Survivor Claims" with a caveat about the true Battle survivors. As in so many other things in Life, all the viable choices have some flaw or another, but we make do. <a href="../../../c/f/l/User%7ECFLeon_0a91.html" title="User:CFLeon">CFLeon</a> 07:37, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The perspective of this story is almost soley on the US forces. The native forces are just seen as a reactive force, an afterthought, while the US troops every move is meticulously documented. This is ironic, given the fact that the Native American forces won. This is a heavily biased piece of work. I'm adding an NPOV tag until this becomes less a tale from the perspectives of US Americans, and more of a balanced account of what happened. (<a href="../../../b/t/i/User%7EBtipling_4d9e.html" title="User:Btipling">Bjorn Tipling</a> 02:26, 25 August 2006 (UTC))</p>
<ul>
<li>Perhaps the article has been much changed since the NPOV tag was added (I haven't reviewed the history), but in its current state the article is not in violation of NPOV. The greater detail on the disposition and movement of the US cavalry units is a byproduct of the more extensive contemporary documentary record available for them, and the fact that, as the losers, the archaeological record of their skeletal remains and artifacts is also more extensive. The editors of this article appear to have used the Indian sources and accounts, and I see no indication that these sources and their perspective have been slighted. It is inappropriate to put an NPOV tag on an historical article merely because the extent of the historical record varies among the participants in the event; e.g., the article on the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_the_Teutoburg_Forest_61e3.html" title="Battle of the Teutoburg Forest">Battle of the Teutoburg Forest</a> is not non-neutral because it relies on Roman sources. I think the tag needs to be pulled, but I've not done so, so as to give other editors a chance to see this discussion.<a href="../../../m/a/y/User%7EMayerG_a4be.html" title="User:MayerG">MayerG</a> 04:27, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>I second the proposition to remove the NPOV tag. Especially that as far as I can check that, all available Native Americamm relations of the battle which where recorded have been used in the article. In fact, I have no idea what the NPOV could be? Do we underestimate the Lakota-Northern Cheyenne victory? Or maybe overestimate it to create a "cavalry martyrology"? Seriously speaking, I think both propositions afre false. Therefore, I'll remove the tag. If you disagree, feel free to reinstate it and let's discuss the issue here.<a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriendly_Neighbour_e987.html" title="User:Friendly Neighbour">Friendly Neighbour</a> 06:19, 20 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I agree that the NPOV tag should be removed, but do see a little of what Bjorn is getting at. I'll work on this a bit when I get time, but he is right that a little more detail on the Native American warbands' specific movements (which is available) might be illustrative. The map is a good start, and the article alludes to some of the specifics, but more can be added to help flesh out which band went where; similar to the movements of the individual Army columns. However, the article is not biased or NPOV; merely light on manuevers by the Indians. <a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScott_Mingus_78b1.html" title="User:Scott Mingus">Scott Mingus</a> 10:39, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I agree with Bjorn, though I think the one-sidedness is fairly innocent, and can be rectified in places. eg: the sentence "Unfortunately (for Custer and his troops), this aggressive action was deeply flawed as a military tactic" can have the first clause removed without detriment to the writing, and avoiding accusation of NPOV</p>

<p>This might be the article that has pained me most to fail. To be honest, this article strikes me as one of the most comprehensive, encyclopedic articles of military history I've seen on Wikipedia. Nevertheless, this article still fails on the criteria mentioned before: the lack of proper citations and proper credit to references. Hence, this article fails primarily on the criteria of verifiability. Basically, what the editors of this article should remember is that, especially with historical articles, the easy verification of facts is a must. Frequently, editors mistakenly think as though only opinions or analysis need citation, but facts need citation just as well. The problem that arises, especially with GA nominations, is that lack of proper citation leaves other categories of evaluation in limbo: for example, how would I be able to decide whether this article is truly NPOV without being able to consult the references it listed? If I were to see the movie Birth of a Nation, and it had only references to sources that, on the surface, seeing the citation, seemed legitimate, would I be able to tell that this movie was not a product of historical study, but instead an item of propaganda for white supremacists? Unless I had prior knowledge, I'd most likely skip down that primrose path that suggested the movie maintained a neutral, objective perspective.</p>
<p>Obviously, the lack of citations throughout the bulk of this article is troublesome. The citations given are no less problematic. For example, references 1 and 2 are wholly unacceptable. The first says "See Sarf for a breakdown of the composition of each of these columns." It is not up to the reader to sort out your reference information. This should be, for a book not available online most especially, noted by page. Furthermore, just saying, "see this reference" as does the second citation, also fails the second criterion for good article status. It is the responsibility of the editors, if they desire GA status, to make each and every fact easily verifiable to the reader. It isn't an easy task, but with a topic such as this, it is one that can be accomplished.</p>
<p>Basically, I apologize to the editors if they feel as though my analysis was condescending, but because this article has failed before on the same criterion, I wanted to make sure my thinking, as I presume the thinking of the previous evaluators, was adequately presented. With regret, I must fail this article until it meets the requirements of #2 of the good article criteria.</p>
<p>I encourage the editors of this article to address this problem and resubmit. Cheers! <a href="../../../c/h/u/User%7EChuchunezumi_fe5d.html" title="User:Chuchunezumi">Chuchunezumi</a> 01:20, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
