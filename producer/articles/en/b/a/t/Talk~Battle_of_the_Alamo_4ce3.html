<p>I found the word Texian used about five times, and the word texan used four times. Do the words have seperate meanings, or do they mean the same thing?

According to the biography of Sam Houston (I will fill in the author later), a Texian is an Anglo native of Texas. A Tejano is a Latino native. But he seems to also use Texian for any Anglo Texas resident, regardless of birth.</p>
<p>I see two items which could be addeded.</p>
<p>1. Santa Anna's decision to give no quarter (execute prisoners) was made at the beginning of the campaign. According to the source above, Santa Anna marched all the way from Mexico under the no-quarter flag. You could clarify that when Santa Anna asked for the Texans surrender "with discretion" that meant once he took them prisoner, he reserved the right to summarily execute them, which of course is what he did.</p>
<p>2. The entire battle was quixotic, and should never have been fought. Major General Sam Houston, the commander of the Texas forces, and a highly qualified soldier, had ordered Jim Bowie to strip and raze the Alamo, and join the main body of the Texas forces. Bowie did not do this, and he and Travis lost all the men under their command. Bowie was at best a freebooter (thug would be more like it, IMHO), so for him to disobey Houston was merely imprudent. Travis was a regular officer of the Army of Texas, so his disopbedience was muntinous. As Houston forsaw, the Mexicans occupied the Alamo, and got considerable tactical advantage from the facitlity.</p>
<p>The battle of San Jacinto, which saved Texas independance, was won mostly by luck, due to a rare lapse in judgement by Santa Anna, one of the finest generals in the hemisphere. So the loss of 100-200 highly aggressive fighters in the Alamo ultimately had no effect, but that was not forseeable at the time.</p>

<p>In the following paragraph:</p>
<p><i>Before the battle, Santa Anna ordered that a red flag be raised indicating to the defenders that no quarter would be given. Several defenders who had not been killed in battle were captured and executed. Among its defenders were James Bowie (the leader of the militia forces), David Crockett, and William Barret Travis. Two dozen women and children, as well as two slaves at the Alamo, were released.</i></p>
<pre>
==
</pre>
<p>Does <i>Among its defenders</i> refer to those who had not been killed in battle? Crockett wasn't killed in battle but I thought Travis was. It seems to be mixing things which happened before the battle with things which happened afterward. Could someone make this clearer, maybe put it in two paragraphs? <a href="../../../s/h/o/User%7EShoaler_5952.html" title="User:Shoaler">shoaler</a> 21:55, 6 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>You are correct Shoaler, William Travis was killed during the battle, very early on in fact. A ridiculas legend about him emerged soon after the battle. It said that he stood up on the wall and directed vollies of fire for several minutes before a Mexican sniper killed him. Davy Crockett survived the battle, critically wounded many reports say, and he was executed by the Mexicans. This report was heavily biased though. It described the Mexicans as 'cruel, savage murderers'. Reports about him, rumors, legends and so forth are enormously confusing and contridictory though.</p>

<ul>
<li>We only have Travis' slave's version of when Travis died during the battle. Most accounts does put his death at early on in the battle. Whether it was five minutes, ten or fifteen, we'll never know. As to Crockett's death, again, we'll never know for certain if he was taken prisoner by Castrillon or died 'swinging ol Betsy' as Mrs. Dickinson claims. She was a non-combatant and was inside the chapel so how would she know? Crockett's death is extremely contraversial among Texas historians. <i>Reply Posted 25 June 2005</i></li>

<p>I heard this facinating story about Jim Bowie at the Alamo. Bowie was sick with pneumonia (or flu, depending on who you ask) at the time of the attack. When the Mexicans breached the fort, a horde of them burst into Jim Bowie's room, where he was on his sick-bed. He had two, single-shot pistols and his Bowie knife on the table. He fired both pistols into the crowd of Mexicans before he was riddled with bullets. After the battle three Mexican bodies were found in his room along with his. Two pistol shots and...what happened to the third guy? The Bowie knife was still on the table. Any thoughts. -<a href="../../../e/2E/_/User%7EE._Brown_cd32.html" title="User:E. Brown">E.

<ul>
<li>Yes. According to what legend you wish to believe, Bowie was either dead before the final assault or killed during the assault. According to Andrea Castanon Villanueva or as she's better known Madam Candelaria who claims to have been with Bowie at the time of his death, he died a few minutes before the final assault on 6 March. Her story, albeit a good one, doesn't have much creedo to it since she had changed it on several occasions. Bowie's death, along with Travis and Crockett will never been known for certain.</li>

<p>What a romantic modern assumption to assume a man who is on the verge of death from pneumonia could kill two people with two shots from weapons with a very low success rate and then somehow kill someone with a knife, even though he is bedridden. <a href="../../../s/a/v/User%7ESavidan_59ac.html" title="User:Savidan">savidan</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/v/User_talk%7ESavidan_3fd9.html" title="User talk:Savidan">(talk)</a> <a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><span style="color:#008000;">(e@)</span></a></sup> 06:41, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li>Actually, it seems to me that the existence of the <a href="../../../t/e/x/Texas_Revolution_278c.html" title="Texas Revolution">Texas Revolution</a> article makes the Prelude to Battle section too long, if anything.

<p>I replaced some of the instances of "Texian" with "Texan" because as I understand it Texian refers to American (white) settlers in Texas; the defenders of the Alamo were not only white, so the more general "Texan" covers both in most cases.

<p>I've read that one factor - not the primary reason - for the Alamo defenders' opposition to the Mexican government was the government's anti-slavery policy.</p>
<p>The defenders of the Alamo were in part fighting for the continued right to own slaves.</p>
<p>Why does the article not mention this whatsoever? It mentions other factors, from the increasingly dictatorial powers of the Mexican president to the loyalty of the Alamo defenders to the US over Mexico; I'd think it should also mention the difference on slavery between the two sides, that the battle was in part between the forces for and against slavery.</p>
<p>Indeed, the statement of Texas upon seceding from the United States clearly indicates the importance to them of defending the right to slavery:</p>
<p>"In all the non-slave-holding States, in violation of that good faith and comity which should exist between entirely distinct nations, the people have formed themselves into a great sectional party, now strong enough in numbers to control the affairs of each of those States, based upon an unnatural feeling of hostility to these Southern States and their beneficent and patriarchal system of African slavery, proclaiming the debasing doctrine of equality of all men, irrespective of race or color-- a doctrine at war with nature, in opposition to the experience of mankind, and in violation of the plainest revelations of Divine Law. They demand the abolition of negro slavery throughout the confederacy, the recognition of political equality between the white and negro races, and avow their determination to press on their crusade against us, so long as a negro slave remains in these States...</p>
<p>We hold as undeniable truths that the governments of the various States, and of the confederacy itself, were established exclusively by the white race, for themselves and their posterity; that the African race had no agency in their establishment; that they were rightfully held and regarded as an inferior and dependent race, and in that condition only could their existence in this country be rendered beneficial or tolerable." <small>โThis <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Craig234 (talk โข <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Craig234_63c6.html" title="Special:Contributions/Craig234">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

<p>+this is my understanding as well, I was a history major at a university in San Antonio, so we studied the Alamo ad naseum, my understanding is that travis and the defenders believed Santa Anna would wait until spring to start his march north in order to have forage for his calavary, and accordingly thought that they had several months more than they actually did. Also Travis had no knowledge of Fannins' action and believed he and his 400 men were coming as reinforcements, which fannin belatedly set out to do before the battle of Goliad.</p>

<p>I'm willing to accept the myth-busting revision, but not the ranting tone (encyclopedic articles shouldn't normally be proving negatives), and most of the detail was inappopriate for the introduction. Thus I moved it down to a larger discussion of the defenders and their sympathies. The whole paragraph, however, is unsourced and the claims -- especially -- that this 19th century historian promulgated myths is just the sort of thing that we should have a citation for. Otherwise, perhaps we should restore the text as of yesterday. --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 07:06, 7 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The article mentions differing claims about casualites depending on Mexican or Texan sources. However, the Introductory summary still states an unequivocal number of 1,000 Mexicans killed. This should be expressed in a range to show up front the uncertainty of the numbers.</p>

<p>From the <b>Prelude to battle</b> section:</p>
<p><i>Santa Anna assembled an estimated force of 6,100 soldiers and 20 cannon at San Luis Potosรญ in early 1836 and moved through Saltillo, Coahuila, towards Texas. His army marched across the Rio Grande through inclement weather, <b>including snowstorms</b>, to suppress the rebellion.</i></p>
<p>I live in south Texas along the Rio Grande. We got snow here 2 years ago...for the first time in 118 years (that's right, it never snowed here in the 20th Century). I would really like to know where these "snowstorms" are documented. I'm not saying he didn't march his army through snowstorms, it just sounds a little out of the ordinary for the region.</p>

<dd>Agreed - that's a bold claim for most of that area. I can see that earlier versions of the article (Junish) said "including snowstorms in mountain passes" - no idea why that was</dd>

<p>+it is my understanding that a norther hit and the temp dropped very low, but I've always had a hard time believing the stories about several feet of snow.</p>

<p>The description of the flag of the revolution is a little unclear; I am assuming that the <b>brown</b> field referred to is a typo, and should read blue?

<p>Under casualties it says</p>

<dd>However, most historians and military analysts accept those reports which place the number of Mexican casualties at approximately 1,500.</dd>
</dl>
<p>and under Mexican casualties it says</p>
<dl>
<dd>The accounts most commonly accepted by historians are the ones that single place the number of Mexican dead around 200 and the number of initial Mexican wounded around 400 [...] the Texian account of 1,500 dead also lacks logic.</dd>
</dl>
<p>There seems to be a lot of opinion in the article in general. I came here not knowing about Alamo at all and have a hard time figuring out what is historical fact and what is "interpretation".
