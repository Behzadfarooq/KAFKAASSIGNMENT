<p>If you merge <a href="../../../g/a/t/Gatchaman.html" title="Gatchaman">Gatchaman</a> and <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_The_Planets_318a.html" title="Battle of The Planets">Battle of The Planets</a>, then you should merge <a href="../../../p/o/w/Power_Rangers_5c57.html" title="Power Rangers">Power Rangers</a> and all the other <a href="../../../s/u/p/Super_Sentai_1aff.html" title="Super Sentai">Super Sentai</a>.

<p>I'd really like it if we could keep information correctly sorted between this and the <a href="../../../g/a/t/Gatchaman.html" title="Gatchaman">Gatchaman</a> article, so that this article contains only the information relevant to <i>Battle of the Planets</i>, not everything relevant to Gatchaman. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 18:24, 11 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I totally agree. Additionally Battle of The Planets is known to the entire X Generation of American kids like myself as Battle of The Planets. I can see anime purists wanting to merge the two but I'd never even heard of <a href="../../../g/a/t/Gatchaman.html" title="Gatchaman">Gatchaman</a> till reading this. Battle of the Planets deserves its own entry. --207.172.210.36 01:55, 12 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>One more vote for a seperate entry of BOTP. Growing up in the 80'ws BOTP was the cartoon to watch. A link back to the original series is warrented, but BOTP had a lot of creative change.</p>
<p>--- Honestly, I'm anti-merge for several reasons. First, I think merging BOTP into Gatchaman will confuse a lot of searchers of Wiki. Many Xers only know the show as BOTP, and are not interested in Gatchaman. Second, Gatchaman is a show for adults, and BOTP for children. The animation is primarily the same (though Sandy Frank cut and pasted and drew some stuff [Zark, the "ready room" to pull their version together), but the storylines are not. Though the BOTP eps often are based on the original Gatch storyline, they are typically so different that it's a whole different story. And not only is the storyline different -- so are the characters. Jason is a far cry from Joe, Ken never had anything going on with Jun (Mark and Princess), and the original Gatch team was very adult -- older than their years. The BOTP characters are still kids, and the messages embedded in the episodes are for kids.Finally, BOTP stripped out the most pivotal episodes in the Gatch series -- Ken and Red Impulse, Joe dying of brain damage, Katse as a hermaphrodite, Ken and Joe as friends and near-equals rather than a resentful second and an arrogant leader. The things that make Gatchaman what it is are not present in BOTP -- but then, the things that make BOTP what it is are not present in Gatchaman -- the campy humor, the ridiculous robot, the simplistic relationships among characters, the messages intended to teach children to behave (though I really think Eagle Riders wins the prize on that one). I do think G-Force and Eagle Riders should also fall into the BOTP category (in spite of the fact that G-Force in particular was much closer to the original storylines) because they are all Americanized shows based on (but not usually translated from) the original Japanese. On the other hand, I think the OAVs and the recent ADV translations should fall into the Gatch category.</p>

<p>I agree that they should be kept separate; I don't know the first thing about either of these topics, but I would have been confused, and less edified, if I had to wade through a single combined article of the two. The American series was popular enough, apparently, to get its own article separate from the original, IMO. <a href="../../../n/a/e/User%7ENae%27blis_3d56.html" title="User:Nae'blis">nae'blis</a> <i><sub><a href="../../../n/a/e/User_talk%7ENae%27blis_9b41.html" title="User talk:Nae'blis">(talk)</a></sub></i> 21:14, 15 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>The section on BOTP had been removed from the above page. Judging by recent article edits, and the fact that there seemed to be no consensus on the discussion, this still seems to be disputed so I have re-added it.

<p><br />
Are you kidding me? BOTP stands on its own</p>
<p><br />
Why would you merge them together?! That would be like merging Super Sentai with Power Rangers even though both series are VERY different from one another. Just because two series use the same footage does not mean they are the same thing. If the story and plot is drastically different, they arent the same bloody thing.</p>
<p>-Battle of the Planets deserves its own entry. However, it should have a link to the Gatchaman entry, as they are related. They are related, but not enough to merge them.</p>
<p>Honestly, I'm anti-merge for several reasons. First, I think merging BOTP into Gatchaman will confuse a lot of searchers of Wiki.

<p>I agree on the G-Force: GoS part. I am also heavily revising the G-Force:GoS page, seeing as it was entirely plagiarized from another Gatch fansite's page. I've held discussions with people who really know about the obscure "G-Force", which has provided me with more accurate information than what's out there, which is slightly incorrect/dated with all due respect.

<p>TV show times is cool, but time zones aren't mentioned (EST? GMT? PST?) and appear to be exclusive to US television. It would also be nice to include citations of resources. <a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKatsesama_dfd3.html" title="User:Katsesama">Katsesama</a> 10:50, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think it would be nice if they included if possible other countries the show was broadcast i know in the 1980s it was broadcast in the UK on the BBC <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/classic/titles/battleotplanetstitle.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/classic/titles/battleotplanetstitle.shtml" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> dwanyewest</p>

<p>Added episode listing including related Gatchaman episode number. A chart format seemed like the most space-friendly way to do things, but you'll notice the episodes are listed horizontally rather than vertically, which has a lot to do with laziness; adding all the little wiki markers to make the chart was enough work for me for tonight. If someone wants to reorganize so #2 is UNDER #1 rather than to it's right, please feel free.</p>
<p>I chose the chart format I did because I liked the way it looked better than some of the charts that have thick borders on a plain white background. That's just Aesthetics According to Carolyn, so if someone has an idea to make it look purtier, I'm a-ok with that.</p>

<p>I removed the Race Bannon redirect because it makes no sense. Race Bannon is apparently a reference to Johnny Quest, which has nothing to do with BotP (other than perhaps that it was aired around the same time). I know it wasn't a Tatsunoko production, I think off the top of my head that it was Hanna Barbera?</p>
<p>The formal Race Bannon inquiry does in fact redirect correctly to Johnny Quest; I'm thinking this redirect was in error?</p>
