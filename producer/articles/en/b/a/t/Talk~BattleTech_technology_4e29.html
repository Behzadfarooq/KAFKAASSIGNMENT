<p>WOAH. What mech transforms into an aerospace fighter? Are you sure you aren't thinking of Zeta Gundam or something? For now, I'm going to change it because I'm pretty sure there is no transformer mech, being that it definitely goes against the whole mold that is the idea of a mech in the Battletech universe. If there is a transformer mech, tell me what book I can find it in, and if you want to be super cool, on what page, too.</p>
<p>--James 10:45, Jan 1, 2005 (UTC) (fixed for accuracy, the original Gundam was a combiner, not a transformer.)</p>
<p>Land-Air Mechs (LAMs) can be found in the old edition of Technical Readout: 3025. As noted in the article, they were removed due to copyright issues with the owners of the Macross titles.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Here are additional answers:</p>
<p>LAMs can also be found in the <i>AeroTech</i> box board game extension of BattleTech (not to confound with <i>AeroTech 2</i> which is not the second edition of the <i>AeroTech</i> box). Here we're speaking about the very first <i>BattleTech</i> products. Rules to design LAMs are in <i>AeroTech</i>, too.</p>
<p>Rules about using LAMs can also be found in the <i>BattleTech Compendium</i> book (the old one, with a lansdscape format like <i>Technical Readout'</i>s, not to confound with the later BattleTech <i>Compendium: The Rules of Warfare</i> book).</p>

<dd>Thank you for the correction. Currently I don't own it but I'm quite sure I saw LAM rules in this landscape oriented book. I searched the Internet to find its name and reference but found no place to look at. Wouldn't it be great to list all BattleTech books on WikiPedia? By the way I don't find any suitable place to explain things about BattleTech as a board game; the <a href="../../../b/a/t/BattleTech_28c2.html" title="BattleTech">BattleTech</a> subject speaks about the BattleTech thing as a whole, with no focus about the board game which I'm fond of.</dd>

<dd>I think the part about the prosthetic arm is relevant. It is what many of the prosthetic limbs in the BT universe are made of and therefore a common use of the mynomer. I think it deserves mention, maybe not the part about saving his wife, but the rest. Also I started to change all the BT shorthand to BattleTech, but then I thought that there might be some legitimate reason for it. Otherwise, it just seems a little lazy to me.<a href="../../../a/i/d/User%7EAidanPryde_ad47.html" title="User:AidanPryde">AidanPryde</a> 02:46, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Done some restructuring, I think the BattleMech section in its entirety deserves its own article (and have marked it as such). It was dominating the article which is supposed to be about technology in the BT Universe of which a BattleMech is just one part.</p>
<p>De-duplicated some of the information in the rest of the sections (not completely, there's too much for one sitting). Also added some headings for items that should be in this article in order to complete its stated objectives.</p>
<p>Not yet confident in removing the clean-up request as the article is still overly long and I think the 'Mech discussion needs agreeing first. Kyle 17:11, 7 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I did some mostly minor editing today, but I realized this article is written from the point of view of the table top game. I think the POV should be from the novels, as that better covers every aspect of BT technology. There could be a seperate article about the technology within the table-top game.<a href="../../../a/i/d/User%7EAidanPryde_ad47.html" title="User:AidanPryde">AidanPryde</a> 16:23, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Yes, I've also checked "what links here," and it looks like most links are coming through the BattleMech and Battlemech redirects anyway, which reinforces the case that it should be broken out. --<a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGroggy_Dice_1730.html" title="User:Groggy Dice">Groggy Dice</a> 19:16, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The part about how jump ships work doesn't make sense to me. It says that to make a succesful jump, there needs to be negligible gravitational influence. But the article says that the nadir and zenith points are above and below a star. It shouldn't matter if youre above below to the side or caddy corner from a star, it still has the same amount of gravity unless another planetary body is negating that force through its own gravity, like in a pirate point. The novels I've read never explained anything more than that jumpships used nadir zenith or pirate points and that pirate points were much closer to the target planet than the other two. So is this a user error or is this info from a sourcebook and the fiction is flawed, or am I just an idiot who doesn't understand physics?</p>

<dd>Your physics is right. There's functionally no difference high above the poles (<i>Mass distribution through the star would have some negligible effect, but not in game-scale terms</i>) then at the equater. I can't find any reference in the source materials I have at the moment, but my guess is that if there is such a reference it's the result of artistic license on the part of the authors - or simply a game designer / SciFi author who slept through Physics 101.</dd>

<dd>I thought about this problem some more and I think i understand the problem, the Nadir and Zenith points are far enough away from the star to have only a small amount of influence. The points also have to be above or below the star because otherwise the planets of the system would affect the jump. This is why pirate points are so useful, since they are so much closer.It seems so obvious now. <a href="../../../a/i/d/User%7EAidanPryde_ad47.html" title="User:AidanPryde">AidanPryde</a> 20:31, 9 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>(Just having fun speculating about BattleTech physics now.) I don't think that explanation holds.</dd>
<dd>* At various times the planets might all be an the opposite side of the star. Is it safe to jump then?</dd>
<dd>* Planet mass varies wildly; Arthur Charles Clarke described the solar system as "consisting of the Sun, Jupiter, and assorted debris", Jupiter is 2.5 times more massive than all the other planets combined. Everything but the large gas giants should be negligible for jumps, and their effect should probably be felt far, far outside the star system.</dd>
<dd>A better explanation for the jump points would be some effect of the star's rotation, but that would kill Lagrange points. --217.235.218.107</dd>

<dl>
<dd>The 'zenith' and 'nadir' coordinates would probably be the 'above' and 'below' points located as precisely up and down from the plane of the ecliptic as possible, to allow for avoiding gravitational influences and mass objects. So, in this case, these positional references assume a generally flat orbital plane in a system, and the points exists 'above' and 'below' that plane, relatively, at 90 degree angles centered off the sun to allow optimal flight time to any given destination in-system.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>This is mostly correct. According to the <i>Dropship and Jumpship</i> a point above and below the eliptical plain in points of minimumal gravitational effects were choosen as central points of commerece. While it is recognized that "pirate points" may actually be closer to the planet of destination, the computations required for a successful jump are more involved. This isn't as big of a problem for ships that have reliable jump computers but for those ships that are not in good operating condition it is a hazerdous jump at best, final at worst. Hence the establishment of the two main jump points. Should breakdowns occur facilities would be on hand to deal with all but the worst of these failures.

<p>It seems there are more problems with the Jumpship section, an anonymous user seems to object to calling <a href="../../../n/a/d/Nadir.html" title="Nadir">Nadir</a> and <a href="../../../z/e/n/Zenith.html" title="Zenith">Zenith</a> points Nadir and Zenith, asking that Nadir and Zenith articles be understood. I have read the Nadir and Zenith articles and I understand that in the real world, the words nadir and zenith do not refer to arbitrary points below or above a star or anything specific for that matter. But in the BattleTech universe, this is what these points are called. I can't say much for the source books, but the novels clearly refer to Nadir and Zenith points being below and above a star. So to avoid a revert war, does anybody have any beef with these points being called here what they are called in the fiction?</p>

<dd>Yes, I have, as the Wikipedia shouldn't contain false or misleading information. However, there are at least two ways to keep the names without polluting the rest of Wikipedia with BattleTech misconceptions:
<ul>
<li>Create Nadir (BattleTech) and Zenith (Battletech) (While you are at it you might as well create above (BattleTech) and below (BattleTech), but I disgress.)</li>
<li>Explain the problem ("... which in the BattleTech universe are the points above and below a star ..."), without linking to the real-world articles.</li>

Since I'm not a book person (and you guy's point is in going beyond the games), I cannot add these sections myself, but here's a few things I was questioning while doing the dishes:</p>
<ul>
<li>An overview opening. Battletech technology seems based on giving a realistic feel or take to many sci-fi staples, like faster-than-light travel and communication, hi-tech weaponery, scientific achievements and so. Minor stuff like medical and cybernetic prothesis are considered normal, stuff does breaks down, school life is quite XXth century-ish in overall scheme (Source: Mechwarrior books), and cars still have wheels. What else can be said? What about handguns? Clothes? Their knives are blades or little laser swords? Constructions? Entertainment? Do they have cyberpunk stuff like the simchips and hitech drugs seen in Shadowrun? What about the workmechs? Is there anything remarkable in everyday life to be ponted out?</li>
<li>Also, a section explaining about equipment axioms -- critical space, weight, efficiency (range / damage) and specially heat, which plays a quite big role in the game. Most article seems to assume the reader already has understanding in Battletech 'tech, so those should be explained ja? <a href="../../../k/o/b/User%7EKobayen_55db.html" title="User:Kobayen">Kobayen</a> 21:13, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Good point. Maybe your first point could best be tackled by something to the effect of a 'BattleTech Technology in daily life' article?<a href="../../../a/i/d/User%7EAidanPryde_ad47.html" title="User:AidanPryde">AidanPryde</a> 05:56, 30 June 2006 (UTC)

<p>That would make sense, as otherwise the article would be a bit unwieldy with large sections covering one thing, and much smaller sections on the others.</p>
<p>I too support the split. So long as a link to the new BattleMech article remains on this page.<a href="../../../a/i/d/User%7EAidanPryde_ad47.html" title="User:AidanPryde">AidanPryde</a> 17:19, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I would say splitting was a good idea, too. BattleTech 'Mechs are well-established enough to have their own page. This one could remain and perhaps incorporate some of Kobayen's above ideas.

<p>Ok I went ahead and split the BattleMech part into a new article, Im still a little bit of a noob at Wikipedia, so help me clean it up. On a side note in the midst of spliting the article, i discovered that the three pictures of battle mechs were the cause of the 4 edit buttons being push around. as they were supposed to provide pictures of BattleMechs, I'll try to readd them to the newly split article with out causing the same problem. <a href="../../../a/i/d/User%7EAidanPryde_ad47.html" title="User:AidanPryde">AidanPryde</a> 23:26, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sorry, I don't. I keep making the point that BattleTech is not the real world and is not generally considered to be influential enough to redefine words. However, the fan boys keep ignoring reason and keep reintroducing sentences that do not parse in English. As this is the English Wikipedia, not the BattleTech one, I don't see why these sentences should stand as they do. They make no sense, as 'above' and 'below' have no meaning without a reference system.</dd>
<dd>So, please, don't think that BattleTech is more important than the English language, and, please, don't disrupt Wikipedia again by adding sentences that simply make no sense in the English langauge. If you want to explain the meaning of the words 'Nadir', 'Zenith', 'above' or 'below' in the BattleTech universe, feel free to do so, but don't assume that every reader knows this fringe dialect of the English language.</dd>

<dd>In the fiction, Zenith and Nadir are used to refer to the jump points. they are referred to as the "Zenith Jump Point" or "Nadir Jump Point" If you need proof, I took a little time to look and on page 24 of the "Operation Audacity" novel, are the words "Nadir Jump Point." The words still retain their meaning of above and below, Zenith and Nadir sound better though, which is probably why they are used. The reference for the above or below is the elliptical plane of the solar system. The points would lie on a line going directly through the center of a star, 90 degrees from the elliptical plane of the solar system.</dd>
<dd>Zenith and Nadir Jump Points is the way I used them in the last revision and I did not link them to the Nadir and Zenith Wiki articles because some confusion could be drawn from that. Maybe above and below don't belong as they don't make sense in zero gravity, but Zenith and Nadir definitely belong. This article is about the fictional Battletech universe, therefore it should reflect the way the things work and are talked about in the fictional universe. If you want to explain all the inaccuracies in the Battletech, create an article about it. I agree with Wizardry Dragon that this is not the place for it. <a href="../../../a/i/d/User%7EAidanPryde_ad47.html" title="User:AidanPryde">AidanPryde</a> 22:02, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't have any BattleTech novel handy, sorry. I don't have any doubts that, in the BattleTech universe, the words have exactly the meaning everyone claims here.</dd>
<dd>Personally, I don't understand the 'above' and 'below' stuff <i>at all</i>. To wrap it into a simple question: Which of the two points is Nadir and which is Zenith? What makes them different? If one is 'below', do things fall up from there? This is just confusing. I don't expect you to change what the words mean in the BattleTech universe, but to provide the casual reader with the means to make sense of the explanation. Yes, the explanation of jump point physics is bogus, but I don't care in the scope of this article. However, one should be able to understand the article without implicit redefinitions of English words.</dd>
<dd>I don't think that Nadir and Zenith should be avoided at all cost. I certainly don't think that 'above' and 'below' should be avoided. I <b>do</b> think that any deviations from standard English should be noted.</dd>

<dd>I have no idea which point is "above" and which is "below." I'm guessing that is decided when the first jump in a solar system is first calculated. So to explain the jump points, would this be more to what you mean, "The Zenith and Nadir points lie on an imaginary line going directly through the center of a star, 90 degrees from the elliptical plane of the solar system far away from the star."? If so, I think it's a little too much for the average reader. It needs to be stated in simple terms. But next time, please provide an alternative to the problem or start a discussion before you delete important information. <a href="../../../a/i/d/User%7EAidanPryde_ad47.html" title="User:AidanPryde">AidanPryde</a> 23:26, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't think I have to provide an alternative just because I identify and delete an erroneous statement. I can in fact not think of a simple replacement, just because BattlePhysics is so damn weird. The best thing would probably be a section on JumpPoints which explains the BattleTerms and gives some background.

<dd>Repeating it doesn't make it more true (and in fact makes you look slightly childish). (Well, it may work in BattleVerse, but not in real life.) You can read my statements here to understand my point. OTOH, all I read are far-fetched accusation (not to mention misquotes).</dd>
<dd>It's really simple: Explain which point is Nadir and which is Zenith <i>without</i> assuming the reader agrees with the BattleTech authour on which point in the Universe is up. That's all. No need to pull Wikipedia rules out of your ass. Just explain the facts in English iso BattleEnglish.</dd>
<dd>This article can (and in fact should) be used to explain fictional matters; it should not use a fictional language.

<dd>Wouldn't Zenith obviously mean above, since the term refers to a high point, an apex, etc.?

<dd>We can't explain which point is which because I've never seen or heard it explained which is which. Maybe its out there somewhere, in a source book or something, but I don't know. Wizardry Dragon isn't pulling rules out of his ass, you are being disruptive, whether you know it or not. The way the article is written before you keep reverting it, was not fictional language, it was using the terms as they are used in BattleTech. No its not correct usage of the term but many sci-fi and other fictional works use scientific terms incorrectly and do not garner explicit explanations of problems. An explicit explanation of what jump points are and how they are unrealistic or inaccurate in the real world does not belong in this article and would be asinine. If YOU think it's important that this problem be explained, then <a href="../../../b/e/_/Be_bold.html" title="Be bold">be bold</a> and create an article about jump points and explain it there.

<p>(I just now noticed the irony of my "See above" message below.) The statement as it was written is not parsable in English and thus has no place in en:Wikipedia.</p>
<p>Explanation: The statement uses in-game vocabulary to explain in-game concepts. no attempt is made to provide definitions for the in-game vocabulary, so the statement is not understandable. Additionally, since the in-game vocabulary looks exactly like English words, many readers will be confused. The words <i>above</i> and <i>below</i> used in the statement cannot be used in their English meaning. The explanation of BattleNadir and BattleZenith relies on position relative to a star and the orbital plane of its planets. Concepts as <i>above</i> and <i>below</i> without making a reference point make no sense here. In the words of AidanPryde: "I have no idea which point is 'above' and which is 'below.'"</p>
<dl>
<dd>This I can get on board with, with some reservations. The thing everyone seems to miss is that <b>the point of reference is the system's star.</b> Perhaps this could be made more obvious and clear in the article? -- <b><a href="../../../w/i/z/User%7EWizardry_Dragon_6d1a.html" title="User:Wizardry Dragon">Wizardry Dragon</a></b> (<a href="../../../w/i/z/User_talk%7EWizardry_Dragon_3463.html" title="User talk:Wizardry Dragon">Talk to Me</a>) (<a href="../../../w/i/z/User%7EWizardry_Dragon_Wikipedia_Neutrality_Project_89be.html" title="User:Wizardry Dragon/Wikipedia Neutrality Project">Support Neutrality on Wikipedia</a>) 23:25, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'll give it some further reading later tonight, but as far as I can recall, the "Zenith" point uses the planet you're orbiting as a reference.

<dd>Nonono, the Zenith and Nadir is for calculating a jump point. Jump points, as I understand the BT lore, are createds dynamically by certain ships outfitted with jump drives. These ships, ever so originally, are called jump ships. To calculate the area where you can jump, <small>(by whatever science BT uses, I don't even pretend to understand it. Something about gravity that flies in the face of Newtonian physicics)</small>, you need to calcualte these two "imaginary" points. You can then enter a jump gate at either by some method that I, again, don't understand. (The previous explanation wasn't wrong per se, but it was very incomplete and therefore grossly misleading) -- <b><a href="../../../w/i/z/User%7EWizardry_Dragon_6d1a.html" title="User:Wizardry Dragon">Wizardry Dragon</a></b> (<a href="../../../w/i/z/User_talk%7EWizardry_Dragon_3463.html" title="User talk:Wizardry Dragon">Talk to Me</a>) (<a href="../../../w/i/z/User%7EWizardry_Dragon_Wikipedia_Neutrality_Project_89be.html" title="User:Wizardry Dragon/Wikipedia Neutrality Project">Support Neutrality on Wikipedia</a>) 00:19, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think that the main life supporting planet in a system determines the Zenith jump point by its poles. If the North pole of the planet is pointing more or less in one direction, that direction is the side of the orbital plane that the Zenith point is on. Which of course means the Nadir is on the opposite side. This is how I have understood it. <a href="../../../a/i/d/User%7EAidanPryde_ad47.html" title="User:AidanPryde">AidanPryde</a> 06:28, 1 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Oy ve! you people... Why can't we just say "Generally, Jumpships can safely enter a planetary system at only two points, designated in the fiction as 'Zenith' and 'Nadir'. At certain periods, planetary motion causes the temporary creation of 'Pirate Jump Points' some of which lie closer to the planet." And avoid use of ABOVE/BELOW completely. Forget the plane of the elliptic (even though I agree), it is too much to expect non-fans to understand our terminology. --Claytonius3 15:24, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In the books, the LaGrange points are usually described as abov/below the planet, such as "Because the reinforcements were coming from the Nadir jump point, the Castle Brian could not communicate intelligence; the bulk of the planet shielded the radio waves." But I'm not sure that it makes any difference to anyone whether the LaGrange points are in relation to the planet. I think the important info is that there are two standard points, and sometimes pirate points appear closer to the planet. Everything else just makes it overly complicated. --Claytonius3 21:32, 17 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Back in after a lengthy break. Some good suggestion here I think, but I want to say two things: First, currently Naddir and Zenith are stated, but not explained. That doesn't make the article wrong, just a bit weird. Second, I think the missing link is to make the reader understand that BattlePhysics does not make sense here. Once this is done, one could to everything. (Again, see Heisenberg Compensators for an example.) So, very simply: "In the BattleVerse, Nadir and Zenith describe two fixed points relative to a star. For dramatic reasons, these points are determined assuming a fixed plane of reference. Also, it is assumed that a star's gravity is lower at a right angle to the planetary plane." yaddayadda.</dd>
<dd>Nagyss, are you trying to say that Nadir and Zenith are relative to a planet? Sigh. --217.235.231.214</dd>

<p>So the main problem is the definition of 'above' and 'below', and whether Nadir and Zenith should be included/explained? The Jumpship section has more problems than just these, (no offence) it could use some help.Nagyss 21:25, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think part of the problem may be that no actual explanation is given for how a JumpShip "jumps." Something about the bending of space, etc. should be included. Perhaps once that occurs, the rest of the section would make more sense. <a href="../../../s/c/a/User%7EScaletail_7a31.html" title="User:Scaletail">Scaletail</a> 21:11, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>There are significant portions of this article which require editing. Here is what I have noticed needs work in the article:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Citations</b>: This article has none. It needs them, or it may face a challenge for deletion under <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Paragraph style</b>: The frequent small paragraphs in the article suggest a lack of organisation and result in an article that reads very "choppily". This kind of choppy prose indicates that the article needs reogranization to be more cohesive and succint.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>List-like</b>: With the exception of some large blocks of text at the end, the majority of the article reads like a list that is only elaborated on a little. We need it to appear more cohesive, and more like an encyclopedia article. Wikipedia <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">is not a collection of lists</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Importance/organization</b>: With the largest blocks of text at the end, there is a suggestion that the information at the top is the most important, and yet, these portions are elaborated on the least. Either you need to assert the importance of these articles, or reorganize them to the bottom of the paragraph.</li>

<p>Hi, I'm an administrator who saw a request for assistance at the Village Pump. While I'm unfamiliar with the BattleTech universe, I'd like to offer a few suggestions. First, please sign your posts on talk pages. There's a <i>Sign your name</i> option right below the <i>Show changes</i> button on your edit screen. Second, it doesn't seem that <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> is being violated here. An editor appears to be genuinely concerned about how to describe a part of this fictional world in the article. I suggest posting at <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_dbd4.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment">Wikipedia:Requests for comment</a> to get some more outside views.

<dd>I think the primary crux of the argument is a lack of any desire to compromise, or change. The editors on the article think it's more or less fine and have been resistant to change, except for a proposed split, whereas some editors have proposed changes tha thave either been ignored (mine) or controversially reverted (217.235.242.235's). I'm trying to mitigate things from snoballing too much, if I come off as anything else, then I apologize. I'm not adverse to changes to this article - I've been trying to affect chanes myself. However, it is NOT constructive to simply say something need changed. Please, if you want a change, offer an alternative other than sasrcastic redefinitions of obvious terminology. If you want to be taken seriously, act seriously. If you want to affect a change that would improve the article, then propose one. Simply deleting parts of the article because they are "bad" is not constructive.

<dd>I disagree, a simple delete can be constructive. The statement was bogus in my opinion, I had no alternative handy (still don't), and I considered it to be better to remove the false statement than to leave it in; the article was improved by that action.</dd>

<p>You're right. Just what a data core is has not been covered either.

<dd>I added info for Narc, AMS, and artillery. I also added a brief section on terraforming and other civilian technology, though that is somewhat problematic.

I left the bullets for weapons that are different from others within a single category, but combined the same ones into one or two paragraphs. I also removed a few references to 'Mechs that really didn't add anything to the subject matter, i.e. stating that a certain 'Mech used the particular weapon being discussed but not mentioning anything special about it.

<p>I'm wondering out loud if the best way to organise this page would be to not use it as a shopping list of technologies, but rather a detailing of the progression of technology in the BT universe as based upon the timeline. The organisation of the history of the BattleTech universe article works fairly well and gives a good structure in which to provide detail about the various technologies introduced along the way.</p>
