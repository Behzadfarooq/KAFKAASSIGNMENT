<p>The Seattle settlement of the time was located roughly where Seattle's <a href="../../../p/i/o/Pioneer_Square%2C_Seattle%2C_Washington_bed4.html" title="Pioneer Square, Seattle, Washington">Pioneer Square</a> now sits. <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Phelps_0a39.html" title="Thomas Phelps">T. S. Phelps</a>, present at the time, wrote a memoir of the event, in which he describes the settlement as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>…on a point, or rather a small peninsula, projecting from the eastern shore, and about two miles from the mouth of <a href="../../../d/u/w/Duwamish_River_41e8.html" title="Duwamish River">Duwam-sh River</a>, debouching at the head of the bay. The northern part of this peninsula is connected with the mainland by a low neck of marshy ground, and about one-sixteenth of a mile from its southeastern extremity a firm, hard sand-pit nearly joined it to the adjacent shore, severed only by a narrow channel through which the surplus waters of an inclosed swamp escaped into the bay. The south and west sides rose abruptly from the beach, forming an embankment from three to fifteen feet high; and proceeding thence northerly, the ground undulated for an eighth of a mile, when it gradually sloped towards the swamp and neck.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>At the intersection of the latter with the main, and overlooking the water, rose a mound about thirty feet above the level of the bay; and to the eastward through a depression in the hills, and passing the head of the swamp, was a broad Indian trail leading to Lake Duwam-sh [now <a href="../../../l/a/k/Lake_Washington_9322.html" title="Lake Washington">Lake Washington</a>], distant two and a half miles.<sup id="_ref-Phelps_3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Phelps" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Phelps's also remarks that the tailings from <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_Yesler_32bb.html" title="Henry Yesler">Henry Yesler</a>'s then recently erected mill were steadily filling in the marshy land at the north of the head or peninsula where the settlement was located.<sup id="_ref-Phelps_4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Phelps" title="">[2]</a></sup> Further, he describes the arrangement of the troops arrayed in defense on the nights before the battle:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The divisions… nightly occupied the shore, vigilantly guarding the people as they slept, and resting only when the morning light released them from the apprehended attack. … [They] were distributed along the line of defense in the following order: The fourth, under Lieutenant Dallas, commencing at Southeast Point, extended along the bay shore to the sand-bar, where, meeting with the right of the first division, Lieutenant Drake, the latter continued the line facing the swamp to a point half-way from the bar to a hotel situated midway between the bar and Yesler's place, and there joined the second, under Lieutenant Hughes, whose left, resting on the hotel (<i>see <a href="../../../m/o/t/Mother_Damnable_cfac.html" title="Mother Damnable">Mother Damnable</a></i>), completed an unbroken line between the latter and Southeast Point, while the howitzer's crew, Lieutenant Morris, was stationed near Plummer's house, to sweep the bar and to operate wherever circumstances demanded. The third division, Lieutenant Phelps, occupied that portion of the neck lying between the swamp and mound east of Yesler's place, to secure the approaches leading from the lake, and the marines, under Sergeant Carbine, garrisoned the block-house.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The divisions, thus stationed, left a gap between the second and third, which the width and impassable nature of the swamp at this place rendered unnecessary to close, thereby enabling a portion of the town to be encompassed which otherwise would have been exposed.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The distance between the block-house and Southeast Point, following the sinuosities of the bay and swamp shores, was three-quarters of a mile, to be defended by ninety-six men, eighteen marines, and five officers, leaving Gunner Stocking, Carpenter Miller, Clerks Francis and Ferguson, and fifteen men with Lieutenant Middleton, to guard the ship.<sup id="_ref-Phelps_5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Phelps" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>

<p>The battle was part of the <a href="../../../p/u/g/Puget_Sound_War_2814.html" title="Puget Sound War">Puget Sound War</a>, a series of skirmishes in the region that had been occurring over the course of several months, beginning <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_28.html" title="October 28">October 28</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/5/1855.html" title="1855">1855</a>. The natives had been angered by treaties imposed by Territorial Governor <a href="../../../i/s/a/Isaac_Stevens_3e70.html" title="Isaac Stevens">Isaac Stevens</a>. There had been nearby fighting between federal troops and natives in southern <a href="../../../k/i/n/King_County%2C_Washington_c929.html" title="King County, Washington">King County</a> (the county in which Seattle is located) and <a href="../../../t/h/u/Thurston_County%2C_Washington_0ade.html" title="Thurston County, Washington">Thurston County</a>, to the immediate south. <sup id="_ref-Crowley-Wilma_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Crowley-Wilma" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>The <i>Decatur</i> had been called to Puget Sound both on account of the trouble with local natives and to deter frequent raids by <a href="../../../v/a/n/Vancouver_Island_06d5.html" title="Vancouver Island">Vancouver Island</a> natives. Captained by Isaac L. Sterret, during most of this period, it was commanded on the day of the battle by <a href="../../../g/u/e/Guert_Gansevoort_c66d.html" title="Guert Gansevoort">Guert Gansevoort</a>. The <a href="../../../s/l/o/Sloop.html" title="Sloop">sloop</a> had undergone significant damage when it struck an uncharted <a href="../../../r/e/e/Reef.html" title="Reef">reef</a> near <a href="../../../b/a/i/Bainbridge_Island%2C_Washington_a001.html" title="Bainbridge Island, Washington">Bainbridge Island</a> on <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_7.html" title="December 7">December 7</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/5/1855.html" title="1855">1855</a>. It limped into Seattle for repairs (which lasted until <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_19.html" title="January 19">January 19</a>, a week before the raid) and Sterret was temporarily taken off of active duty <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_10.html" title="December 10">December 10</a>; later, after the battle, he was vindicated and returned to active duty.<sup id="_ref-Phelps_6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Phelps" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>From <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_19.html" title="January 19">January 19</a>, <i>Decatur</i> lay at anchor in deep water, in a position from which it had total command of the settlement,<sup id="_ref-Phelps_7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Phelps" title="">[2]</a></sup> to whose defense it contributed two nine-pounder <a href="../../../c/a/n/Cannon.html" title="Cannon">cannon</a> and 18 stands of arms.<sup id="_ref-Crowley-Wilma_3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Crowley-Wilma" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>The fifty or so Seattle settlers were joined by additional settlers from farther south who had taken refuge in the settlement. Assisted by marines from the <i>Decatur</i> they had constructed a blockhouse.<sup id="_ref-Crowley-Wilma_4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Crowley-Wilma" title="">[1]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Phelps_8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Phelps" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Only days before the battle (<a href="../../../j/a/n/January_21.html" title="January 21">January 21</a>), Governor Stevens arrived in Seattle aboard U.S.S. <i>Active</i>, discounting rumors of war. Almost immediately upon his departure, reports from friendly natives warned that the governor had been completely mistaken and that an attack was imminent; these reports have been variously credited to <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chief_Seattle_2311.html" title="Chief Seattle">Chief Seattle</a>, his daughter <a href="../../../p/r/i/Princess_Angeline_a672.html" title="Princess Angeline">Princess Angeline</a>, or another chief, Sucquardle (known also as "Curley" or "Curly Jim").<sup id="_ref-Crowley-Wilma_5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Crowley-Wilma" title="">[1]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Phelps_9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Phelps" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p><a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Swinson_Maynard_86e4.html" title="David Swinson Maynard">David Swinson "Doc" Maynard</a>, an Indian agent reputed to have had far more than the usual concern for the natives' rights and well-being, evacuated 434 friendly natives to the west side of <a href="../../../p/u/g/Puget_Sound_d14a.html" title="Puget Sound">Puget Sound</a> (at his own expense and with the assistance of his wife).<sup id="_ref-Crowley-Wilma_6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Crowley-Wilma" title="">[1]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>The settlers had, to some extent, organized themselves for their own defense as volunteers under a Captain Hewett. However, this company of volunteers had disbanded and re-formed several times over the months leading up to the battle. On the evening <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_22.html" title="January 22">January 22</a>, with <i>Decatur</i> now in a commanding position, its leaders declared that "they would not serve longer while there was a ship in port to protect them". Phelps writes that "a more reckless, undisciplined set of men has seldom been let loose to prey upon any community than these eighty embryo soldiers upon Seattle… after much rough argument about thirty of their number became partially convinced that their individual safety depended upon unity of action under a competent leader, and they finally consented to form a company, provided Mr. Peixotto would consent to serve as captain. That gentleman accepted the honor…"<sup id="_ref-Phelps_10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Phelps" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Phelps lists the hostile natives as including the "Kliktat" (<a href="../../../k/l/i/Klickitat_tribe.html" title="Klickitat tribe">Klickitat</a> and <a href="../../../s/p/o/Spokane_%28tribe%29.html" title="Spokane (tribe)">Spokane</a>, "Palouses" (<a href="../../../p/a/l/Palus_%28tribe%29.html" title="Palus (tribe)">Palus</a>, <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walla_Walla_%28tribe%29_c282.html" title="Walla Walla (tribe)">Walla-Walla</a>, "Yakami" (<a href="../../../y/a/k/Yakama.html" title="Yakama">Yakama</a>), Kamialk, <a href="../../../n/i/s/Nisqually_%28tribe%29.html" title="Nisqually (tribe)">Nisqually</a>, <a href="../../../p/u/y/Puyallup_%28tribe%29.html" title="Puyallup (tribe)">Puyallup</a>, "Lake" (?), "and other tribes, estimated at six thousand warriors, marshaled under the three generals-in-chief Coquilton, Owhi, and Lushi, assisted by many subordinate chiefs. They had failed to recruit several tribes or nations from the <a href="../../../o/l/y/Olympic_Peninsula_8b22.html" title="Olympic Peninsula">Olympic Peninsula</a>, nor did they succeed in winning the <a href="../../../s/n/o/Snoqualmie_%28tribe%29.html" title="Snoqualmie (tribe)">Snoqualmie</a> over to their cause. Despite the cordial hatred Snoqualmie chief <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patkanim.html" title="Patkanim">Patkanim</a><sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[4]</a></sup> held toward the whites, he decided that it was more expedient to take their side in the war.<sup id="_ref-Phelps_11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Phelps" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Two hostile chiefs—Phelps says Owhi and Lushi (presumably, <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chief_Leschi_0cb7.html" title="Chief Leschi">Leschi</a><sup id="_ref-Crowley-Wilma_7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Crowley-Wilma" title="">[1]</a></sup>), other sources say Owhi and Coquilton—disguised themselves as friendly Indians and reconnoitered the situation the night before the battle.<sup id="_ref-Crowley-Wilma_8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Crowley-Wilma" title="">[1]</a></sup> Phelps describes this in some detail: he, himself was the sentry whom they tricked with a plausible story.<sup id="_ref-Phelps_12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Phelps" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>According to Phelps' account, it would appear that at least two native chiefs were playing a double game. Curley Jim had been considered friendly enough by the settlers to remain within their encampment; conversely, his nephew Yark-eke-e-man had been considered one of the hostile force, but, according to Phelps, had every intention of betraying it from within. Curley Jim now left the settlement in the company of his visitors, and they parleyed around midnight at the lodge of a chief named Tecumseh; Yark-eke-e-man and several "chiefs of lesser note" were also present. They set out a plan to slaughter all of the settlers and U.S. military; Curley requested that his friend <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_Yesler_32bb.html" title="Henry Yesler">Henry Yesler</a> be allowed to live, but accepted being overruled in the matter.<sup id="_ref-Phelps_13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Phelps" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>They resolved to attack in only a few hours, planning to attack around 2 a.m.; Phelps believes the plan would have succeeded, since no one was really planning for a pre-dawn attack. However, they were undercut by Yark-eke-e-man who managed to convince them that a mid-morning attack would be a better plan, using a small decoy force to draw the <i>Decatur's</i> men out of the well-defended areas to do battle on First Hill.<sup id="_ref-Phelps_14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Phelps" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>There are no reliable estimates of the size of the attacking force. Isaac Stevens (who was not present), wrote to Washington that settlers estimated that 200 to 500 Indians had taken the field against them; Phelps put the number of enemy at 2,000, but (write Crowley and Wilma) "frontier military officers often inflated the number of opposing forces to reinforce their accomplishments (or to minimize their failures)."<sup id="_ref-Crowley-Wilma_9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Crowley-Wilma" title="">[1]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Phelps_15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Phelps" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Seattle_%281856%29_5c8a.html" title="Edit section: The battle begins">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The battle begins</span></h2>
<p>An Indian known as "Jim", a relative of Curley's who died a few months later in a hunting accident, evaded Curley's vigilance and warned Dr. Williamson of the impending attack. Williamson sent a messenger to Yesler, who informed Gansevoort, and <i>Decatur's</i> troops abandoned their breakfast and returned to the positions they had held by night. 52 women and children found refuge on board <i>Decatur</i>, and others on board the barque <i>Brontes</i>.</p>
<p>The non-combatants of the friendly tribes took to their canoes to get out of the way. Curley's sister (and Yark-eke-e-man's mother) Li-cu-mu-low ("Nancy"), whom Phelps describes as "short, stout, and incapable of running," warned as she headed for her canoe that the Kliktat were gathered around Tom Pepper's house, which was in the forest, near the crest of First Hill. <i>Decatur</i> fired off a <a href="../../../h/o/w/Howitzer.html" title="Howitzer">howitzer</a> shell in that direction, the first shot of the battle. Phelps and a few others had been trying unsuccessfully to rouse the volunteers from their torpor. At the sound of the howitzer shell, they rushed as one for the blockhouse. There "Sergeant Carbine several times charged them out of one door, to return as often by the other, till, wearying of the trouble, he left them to cower behind the wooden bulwarks, protected from the bullets of the foe."<sup id="_ref-Crowley-Wilma_10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Crowley-Wilma" title="">[1]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Phelps_16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Phelps" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>The third division, contrary to orders, charged up the trail that led towards the lake. This foolhardy charge met with an undeserved success, as they pushed the attackers back without taking any casualties themselves. Klakum held a position behind a tree, and got a rather clean rifle shot at Peixotto standing on the block-house steps, but missed and killed a boy, Milton G. Holgate who was standing a few steps higher. Hans Carl, an invalided sailor on <i>Decatur</i>, died shortly thereafter, but for reasons unrelated to the battle.<sup id="_ref-Phelps_17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Phelps" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Meanwhile, shooting continued where the south end of the peninsula was separated from the mainland by a slough, with settlers on the peninsula faced off against natives on the mainland. Phelps describes "the incessant rattle of small-arms, and an uninterrupted whistling of bullets, mingled with the furious yells of the Indians," but there were few casualties. A settler (Clarence Bagley, quoting William Bell two days after the event, says the casualty was Christian White; Phelps, writing 17 years later, says Robert Wilson<sup id="_ref-Crowley-Wilma_11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Crowley-Wilma" title="">[1]</a></sup>) was killed when he ducked out from behind a stump to try to get some drinking water.<sup id="_ref-Phelps_18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Phelps" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Because the natives' only common language was <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chinook_jargon.html" title="Chinook jargon">Chinook jargon</a>—a trade language that plenty of the white settlers also spoke—the settlers were able to hear and understand the attackers' shouted orders "and revealed many incidents of the battle they were anxious to conceal."<sup id="_ref-Phelps_19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Phelps" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>

<p>According to Phelps's account, at about 11:45 a.m. the native forces suddenly ceased fire and Coquilton could be heard "issuing undistinguishable orders". Those orders turned out to be an attack on Phelps's own (Third) division, with the apparent intention of outflanking the other defenders. When <i>Decatur's</i> bell announced noon, they came, "like so many demons, tearing through the bushes, and filling the air with frightful yells, till they reached the edge of the chaparral, not twenty feet away, where they delivered a terrific volley, and, arrested by the firmness of fourteen men, undismayed by their noise and numbers, suddenly turned and sought shelter behind the trees and logs." Phelps accounts that the retention of nerve by his troops and the failure of nerve by the attackers determined the fate of the battle.<sup id="_ref-Phelps_20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Phelps" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>"The Indians, ignoring their fatal error, now appeared bent on overwhelming us with bullets," his account continues, "and from their front and enfilading fire no avenue of escape seemed open, yet throughout those wearying hours of exposure to that ceaseless flow of deadly missiles not one of that little band was harmed." Seven of the volunteers arrived on the scene, allowing them to hold their ground for two hours, "when the howitzer came to their assistance, and her crew increased the force on the Sawdust to thirty-one, with the important addition of a field-gun throwing a 12-pound projectile, and when the latter was in position I directed Morris to land a 2-second shrapnel in Klakum's ambuscade." Klakum appears to have retreated, lightly wounded.<sup id="_ref-Phelps_21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Phelps" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p><i>Decatur's</i> divisions had held out well, but having not slept all night nor eaten since the previous day, they were becoming worn out. At 3:30 p.m, "escorted by Indian bullets", they returned to their ship to hold the enemy at bay with its artillery until nightfall. Under cover of the darkness, the attackers made several efforts to set fire to buildings, but artillery fire (even at the sacrifice of some buildings) sent them back to the protection of the woods. By 10 p.m. they had retreated. The next morning, they were not to be seen in the vicinity, although fighting elsewhere in the county continued.<sup id="_ref-Phelps_22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Phelps" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>

<p>News of the attack spread rapidly. By 4 p.m. it was known in <a href="../../../b/e/l/Bellingham%2C_Washington_1fe8.html" title="Bellingham, Washington">Bellingham</a>. At noon the day after the battle, <i>Active</i> steamed into Elliott Bay, Governor Stevens aboard. Stevens was, in Phelps's words, "at last compelled to acknowledge the presence of hostile Indians in the Territory." <i>Active</i> headed south in the direction of <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steilacoom%2C_Washington_4d8e.html" title="Steilacoom, Washington">Steilacoom</a> which seemed the most likely next target of an attack, dropping the governor at <a href="../../../o/l/y/Olympia%2C_Washington_3b70.html" title="Olympia, Washington">Olympia</a> on the way.<sup id="_ref-Phelps_23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Phelps" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Yark-eke-e-man reported that the hostile chiefs were ill-provisioned, because, confident of victory, they expected to provision themselves from the settlers supplies. They spent the next several weeks scouring the land for food.<sup id="_ref-Phelps_24" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Phelps" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Two days after the battle, Coquilton threatened, through a messenger, "that within one moon he would return with twenty thousand warriors, and, attacking by land and water, destroy the place in spite of all the war-ship could do to prevent." The threat was taken seriously, and it was decided that Seattle's defenses must be improved. <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_Yesler_32bb.html" title="Henry Yesler">Henry Yesler</a> volunteered ship's cargo of house lumber and on <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_1.html" title="February 1">February 1</a> <i>Decatur's</i> divisions began a two-week's project to erect two fences five feet high, placed eighteen inches apart, and filled in with well-tamped earth, 1,200 yards long, and enclosing a large portion of the town. A second block-house was also erected, and an old ship's cannon plus a 6-pounder field-piece borrowed from <i>Active</i> functioned as its artillery.<sup id="_ref-Phelps_25" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Phelps" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Trees and undergrowth were removed (variously attacked with levers, axes, and shovels, or burned in place) to provide an esplanade and enable <i>Decatur's</i> howitzer to sweep the shores. Much brush was also cleared from the town's inland edges, to reduce the cover for future attacks. On <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_24.html" title="February 24">February 24</a>, <a href="../../../u/s/s/USS_Massachusetts_%281845%29_19a0.html" title="USS Massachusetts (1845)">USS <i>Massachusetts</i></a> arrived and on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_28.html" title="March 28">March 28</a> <a href="../../../u/s/s/USS_John_Hancock_%281850%29_f8e0.html" title="USS John Hancock (1850)">USS <i>John Hancock</i></a>.<sup id="_ref-Phelps_26" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Phelps" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>In the event, the well-defended town did not face a second battle. Defeat in the Battle of Seattle had discouraged the hostile natives; they did not again amass a comparable force, and (especially with the naval presence) Seattle was now a much better defended town. Furthermore, Governor Stevens had convinced Patkanim and his men to take on the role of <a href="../../../b/o/u/Bounty_hunter.html" title="Bounty hunter">bounty hunters</a>, paying them handsomely for the scalps of leaders of the hostile tribes, a task at which he was gruesomely successful.<sup id="_ref-Phelps_27" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Phelps" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Also by Stevens order, a court-martial convened at Seattle on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_15.html" title="May 15">May 15</a> for the trial of Klakum and twenty other Indians; the military trial acquitted them, deeming their actions as having been legitimate warfare, not criminal acts, and they were released after a declaration of peace. It was certainly not the end of violence between settlers and natives in the region, but it was the end of outright war.<sup id="_ref-Phelps_28" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Phelps" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>

<p>As mentioned above, only two settlers were killed and one sailor died of natural causes during the battle, which Phelps characterizes as "incredible" and "miraculous", given that "one hundred and sixty men were for seven hours exposed to an almost uninterrupted storm of bullets". The casualties on the native side are unknown. Phelps claimed personally to have seen ten die from one shell, and that they later "would admit" to 28 dead and 80 wounded, but remarked that the native women "secret[ed] the dead beyond all chance of discovery."<sup id="_ref-Phelps_29" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Phelps" title="">[2]</a></sup> No Indian bodies were found.<sup id="_ref-Crowley-Wilma_12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Crowley-Wilma" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
