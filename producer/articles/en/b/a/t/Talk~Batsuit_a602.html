<p>You seem to have a nearly obscene and phallic obsession with Batman's crotch. I'm not arguing that the man wears short-shorts, but the way you're presenting it is in an unseemly light, and it implies that Batman wears the crotch-cover just to show off his lower parts. The basic description of what Batman's outfit looks like, including the historically accurate mention that the shorts have at times been tight briefs and also baggier, covers what you're trying to say in a more flattering light. -- <font color="green"><b><a href="../../../i/p/s/User%7EIpstenu_5894.html" title="User:Ipstenu">Ipstenu</a></b> <i>(<a href="../../../i/p/s/User_talk%7EIpstenu_7a4a.html" title="User talk:Ipstenu">talk</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ipstenu_a5b5.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ipstenu">contribs</a>)</i></font> 14:19, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Okay, retract flattering and put in accurate and unbiased. By flattering I meant simply a more pleasing to read, not that the information itself was agreeable to all, but the reading process was clean, accurate and easy to follow. The difference between a flowing sentence and a stilted on. I apologize, it was the wrong word. That said, I don't see how your additions are <b>adding</b> anything to the article? The information is already there, and you're adding a personal spin on things: specifically in this case 'defining, and displaying the genital region' ... They're BRIEFS/SHORTS! Of course they cover the groin. That's the definition of what they do. We don't need to repeat it. People can go to the shorts/briefs link if they need more explanation. Do they display it? No more than his cape displays his shoulders. Simply put, I don't think your additions lately have added any new information, or even any information that expands what we already have, and it puts the outfit in a rather erotic light. -- <font color="green"><b><a href="../../../i/p/s/User%7EIpstenu_5894.html" title="User:Ipstenu">Ipstenu</a></b> <i>(<a href="../../../i/p/s/User_talk%7EIpstenu_7a4a.html" title="User talk:Ipstenu">talk</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ipstenu_a5b5.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ipstenu">contribs</a>)</i></font> 17:01, 16 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>face the fax, homie: many of the contributorz 2 the batman material on WP are fanboyz (yes, you also), and are certainly trying to protray him in a flattering light. there is no possible way you can accurately call the <i>above</i> the hip-joint, tight, seamless, pocketless bikini on batman "shorts." why on earth one would think "briefs" "speedos" or "bikini" are somehow less accurate (and less flattering) is puzzling. just trying to call a spade a spade, dude. if you have issues with descibing the batsuit objectively, take it up with jim lee and alex ross. word. --<a href="../../../g/h/e/User%7EGhetteaux_4f72.html" title="User:Ghetteaux">Ghetteaux</a> 17:29, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I personally would agree with Ipstenu. Mention of the briefs is needed, and I would think that the word "briefs" is the right one. As a note, neither calling someone a fanboy nor saying they have an obsession with someone's crotch is particularly conducive to a civil discussion - but I'm not here to argue. The article currently says:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"The basic foundation of the Batsuit is a tight, revealing unitard (similar to many superheroes). In early depictions, contrasting, tight, briefs are worn over the unitard, similar to early 20th century circus performers (who wore briefs over their circus bodystockings). The inclusion of this feature might have been influenced by Superman's similar costume, which preceded Batman's by a few years. Usually, however, these briefs are depicted as being integrated into the unitard, so that section of the costume constitutes only a seam and color change from the rest of the suit, rather than another piece of clothing worn over the suit. These have varied in color and style as depicted by different artists, from light blue tights with peacock briefs, to all black bodystockings with a black bikini bottom."</dd>
</dl>
<p>I can't find the quote that's causing the trouble in the article, so I would assume it's gone. I don't necessarily speak for the entire Comics Project, but I think that the above passage describes the suit accurately, not trying to skip over details or go into too much detail. <a href="../../../g/a/m/User%7EGamesmaster_d57e.html" title="User:Gamesmaster">Gamesmaster</a> 20:47, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Does Batman always carry a Kryptonite ring with him all the time? I doubt such an item would be standard in his utility belt. Given the difficulty of acquiring and even duplicating Kryptonite in post-Crisis continuity, makes more sense he would keep it safe in the Batcave and take it out only in an emergency. There've been several occasions where he lost the belt or is forced to ditch it. If he did claim to always carry one, it's more likely he's bluffing. --<a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDestron_Commander_a9db.html" title="User:Destron Commander">Destron Commander</a> 05:41, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>He only carries it when he thinks he might need it. And since he's the Goddamn Batman, he only carries it when the plotline dictates. FWIW, though, I don't think every item on the list is carried every time, otherwise it'd be a Utility Backpack.

<p>Very much agree that there should be mention of the changes that the Utility Belt has undergone over the years in the comics.

The rest was just way too many images. -- <font color="green"><b><a href="../../../i/p/s/User%7EIpstenu_5894.html" title="User:Ipstenu">Ipstenu</a></b> <i>(<a href="../../../i/p/s/User_talk%7EIpstenu_7a4a.html" title="User talk:Ipstenu">talk</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ipstenu_a5b5.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ipstenu">contribs</a>)</i></font> 13:58, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I put back the bat-belt images, since I think they're appropriate illustrations of the batbelt and very much static to the batsuit. -- <font color="green"><b><a href="../../../i/p/s/User%7EIpstenu_5894.html" title="User:Ipstenu">Ipstenu</a></b> <i>(<a href="../../../i/p/s/User_talk%7EIpstenu_7a4a.html" title="User talk:Ipstenu">talk</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ipstenu_a5b5.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ipstenu">contribs</a>)</i></font> 13:38, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>To quote ChrisGriswold here: "The unitard/catsuit/body armor varies, but the other aspects do not"</p>
<p>I think we're best leaving the <b>Body Suit</b> section titled as is, since it encompases the armor variants as well as the skin tight outfits he also wears. -- <font color="green"><b><a href="../../../i/p/s/User%7EIpstenu_5894.html" title="User:Ipstenu">Ipstenu</a></b> <i>(<a href="../../../i/p/s/User_talk%7EIpstenu_7a4a.html" title="User talk:Ipstenu">talk</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ipstenu_a5b5.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ipstenu">contribs</a>)</i></font> 13:59, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Did the DVD say the <b>nipples</b> were inspired by the Greeks, or just that the suit/style was?

<p>Are any other readers taken by the fact that Bob Kane - the designer of the original batsuit is not referenced anywhere in this article? In addition to his acknowledgement of Da Vinci's flying machine, and Zorro's mask, an interesting quotation from Kane might come from his description of the killer in the film 'The Bat'..."he wore a costume that looked a little like my early Batman's, with a black robe and a bat shaped head. This made him look like a bat - very ominous. The film not only helped inspire Batman's costume but also the bat signal".</p>
<p>Also...</p>
<p>Would readers like to know more about the introduction of the 'new-look' batsuit (i.e. the first 'yellow-oval' suit)? For example that it was designed by Carmine Infantino, introduced in a story entitled 'Mystery of the Menacing Mask', in Detective comics #237, May 1964, etc.</p>
<p>Would readers like to know which issue the post-knightfall suit (i.e. the all black suit with yellow-oval but no visible 'briefs') first appeared in (and the fictional reasoning behind its introduction)?</p>
<p>Would readers like to know something about the 'Batman Knight Gallery'? For example that this was a one-shot 'Elseworlds' title - which essentially presented a number of the proposed post-knightfall suit designs (as drawn by many of the 'bat-artists' of the mid 1990s).</p>
<p>Would readers like to know which issue the present suit (i.e. with visible 'briefs', without the yellow-oval, with utility belt pockets) first appeared in (and the fictional reasoning behind its introduction)? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_81.106.197.156_40bd.html" title="Special:Contributions/81.106.197.156">81.106.197.156</a> (<a href="../../../8/1/2E/User_talk%7E81.106.197.156.html" title="User talk:81.106.197.156">talk</a>) 15:22, 14 February 2007 (UTC).</small></p>
<p>I agree that a timeline-based list of the main comic book Batsuits is definitely required, including dates and issue # of their first appearance. The 'post-knightfall' suit in all black, but retaining the yellow-oval is a key costume in Bat history. As is the post 'Cataclysm' suit which finally got rid of Infantino's yellow-oval. Fictional reasoning behind their introduction would add some 'meat' to the article. Goalump 08:48, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
