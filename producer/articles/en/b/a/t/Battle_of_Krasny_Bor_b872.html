<p>The battle was an important event in the period after <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Stalingrad_f1b5.html" title="Battle of Stalingrad">Stalingrad</a> because it represented a revitalized <a href="../../../s/o/v/Soviet_Army_7542.html" title="Soviet Army">Soviet Army</a>'s attempt at a strategic offensive in the northern sector of the front.

<p>After the invasion of the Soviet Union by <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazi_Germany_add9.html" title="Nazi Germany">Nazi Germany</a> on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_22.html" title="June 22">22 June</a> <a href="../../../1/9/4/1941.html" title="1941">1941</a>, an all-out drive for the central Russian city of Moscow was advised by some members of the German General Staff, such as Guderian, but overruled by Hitler who in turn decided to send his forces to the Ukraine first. In early November 1941, it was obvious that the drive had failed due, in part, to intense cold, generally bad weather, poorly planned supply routes, strong resistance by the Red Army on the Moscow approaches and Soviet partisans behind Axis lines. Soviet General <a href="../../../g/e/o/Georgy_Zhukov_8573.html" title="Georgy Zhukov">Georgy Zhukov</a> launched a counter-attack against the German lines in December 1941, driving back Army Group Center, and effectively putting Moscow out of its reach. <a href="../../../a/d/o/Adolf_Hitler_fdc0.html" title="Adolf Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> gave a "standfast" order to all forces, to prevent the complete collapse of the front.</p>
<p>In the sector of Army Group North, following the failed offensive towards <a href="../../../t/i/k/Tikhvin.html" title="Tikhvin">Tikhvin</a> and the <a href="../../../s/v/i/Svir_River_065a.html" title="Svir River">Svir River</a>, reserves were inserted to stop the Soviet counter-offensive on the <a href="../../../v/o/l/Volkhov_River_2a4d.html" title="Volkhov River">Volkhov</a>. These included the recently arrived 250. Infanterie-Division, the Blue Division in the Leningrad sector. After fighting in the Volkhov-<a href="../../../l/a/k/Lake_Ilmen_dfef.html" title="Lake Ilmen">Lake Ilmen</a>-<a href="../../../n/o/v/Novgorod.html" title="Novgorod">Novgorod</a> area from October 1941-August 1942, the Blue Division was transferred to the southern boundary of the Leningrad pocket, where a siege was underway since that city had been surrounded by the Wehrmacht Army Group North in September of 1941. Enduring immense cold and almost constant shelling after November 1942, the Blue Division dug in around Krasny Bor, <a href="../../../p/u/s/Pushkin_%28town%29.html" title="Pushkin (town)">Pushkin</a> and <a href="../../../k/o/l/Kolpino.html" title="Kolpino">Kolpino</a>, towns which are located south-east of Leningrad.</p>
<p>After the reverses of mid-late 1941, the Soviet 55th Army was formed based on reserves from east of <a href="../../../m/o/s/Moscow.html" title="Moscow">Moscow</a>. This new unit consisted of four infantry divisions, two armoured regiments and several other support groups. In January 1943, it was moved to Leningrad where it became part first of the Northern and then of the <a href="../../../l/e/n/Leningrad_Front_012a.html" title="Leningrad Front">Leningrad Front</a> which were attempting to break the <a href="../../../s/i/e/Siege_of_Leningrad_5a77.html" title="Siege of Leningrad">siege of Leningrad</a> by Army Group North.</p>

<p>In January 1943 the Red Army conducted <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Spark_%281943%29_87f2.html" title="Operation Spark (1943)">Operation Spark</a> and managed to break through the bottle-neck between <a href="../../../s/i/n/Sinyavino.html" title="Sinyavino">Sinyavino</a> and the shore of <a href="../../../l/a/k/Lake_Ladoga_29e6.html" title="Lake Ladoga">Lake Ladoga</a>, to create a land-connection to Leningrad along the lake shore for the first time since September 1941. This narrow stretch could still be brought under fire from German positions, and it was therefore important to extend it further south and west. The Soviet command quickly conceived a much larger operation which it named Operation Polar Star. This foresaw a three-front attack by Northwestern Front under <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marshal.html" title="Marshal">Marshal</a> <a href="../../../s/e/m/Semyon_Timoshenko_0fff.html" title="Semyon Timoshenko">Semyon Timoshenko</a>, <a href="../../../v/o/l/Volkhov_Front_aab5.html" title="Volkhov Front">Volkhov Front</a> under <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colonel_General_2426.html" title="Colonel General">Colonel General</a> <a href="../../../k/i/r/Kirill_Meretskov_05a9.html" title="Kirill Meretskov">Kirill Meretskov</a>, and Leningrad Front under Marshal <a href="../../../l/e/o/Leonid_Govorov_1fad.html" title="Leonid Govorov">Leonid Govorov</a>, of which 55th army was now a part. Northwestern Front was ordered to advance northwest towards <a href="../../../l/u/g/Luga.html" title="Luga">Luga</a> and the <a href="../../../g/u/l/Gulf_of_Finland_19ac.html" title="Gulf of Finland">Gulf of Finland</a> coast, thereby cutting off the entire 18th Army in a large encirclement. The 55th army's aim was to break open the vital Leningrad-Moscow Highway starting from its jump-off position in <a href="../../../k/o/l/Kolpino.html" title="Kolpino">Kolpino</a> towards <a href="../../../t/o/s/Tosno.html" title="Tosno">Tosno</a>, to join with a northbound attack pincer of 54th Army of Volkhov Front, thereby encircling German formations in the <a href="../../../m/g/a/Mga.html" title="Mga">Mga</a> sector. The highway is an important road/railway connection linking Moscow and Leningrad. The pivot-point for this highway was Krasny Bor, situated between the highway and the railway line. 55th Army's attack would also hit sectors defended by other German formations to establish secure flanks and draw them into battle. Once this attack had succeeded, the plan was for the second echelon forces to advance through the gap towards Tosno. The attack was planned for <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_10.html" title="February 10">10 February</a> <a href="../../../1/9/4/1943.html" title="1943">1943</a> and was to jump off from Kolpino. The 55th Army planned to attack with a force of approximately 33,000 men and 30 tanks in first echelon, to be followed by a mobile group consisting of the 122nd Tank Brigade and 35th Ski Brigade.</p>
<p>At the end of January 1943, <a href="../../../e/m/i/Emilio_Esteban_Infantes_a737.html" title="Emilio Esteban Infantes">Emilio Esteban Infantes</a>, the general in command of the 250th Infantry Division (Blue Division) was aware of a build-up of Soviet forces (55th Army), which indicated that an attack was imminent. To deflect it he ordered his reserves, two cycle companies and 9th and 11th Battery of the 250th Artillery Regiment, into Krasny Bor on <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_2.html" title="February 2">2 February</a>. On <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_9.html" title="February 9">9 February</a> he ordered that at least one-third of all men with all available automatic weapons were to withdraw 2,000 meters behind the main line of resistance; that the Infantry Regiment 269 should be ready to give up its 2nd Battalion as soon as that was requested; and that the Infantry Regiment 263 had to provide one infantry company, two Füsilier companies, and a machine-gun company as reserves. Some additional mine fields were laid, and minor improvements to firing positions undertaken. The German command promised to send two anti-tank companies with 75 mm <a href="../../../p/a/k/Pak_40.html" title="Pak 40">Pak 40</a> AT guns and <a href="../../../8/8/_/88_mm_gun.html" title="88 mm gun">88 mm AT guns</a> (although only one of these arrived in time for the battle) as well as an infantry regiment.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_infantes"><sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Krasny_Bor_b872.html#endnote_infantes" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Krasny_Bor_b872.html#endnote_infantes" rel="nofollow">[3]</a></sup></span></p>

Shells, mortars and <a href="../../../k/a/t/Katyusha.html" title="Katyusha">Katyusha</a> rockets pounded the <a href="../../../t/r/e/Trench_warfare.html" title="Trench warfare">trenches</a>, <a href="../../../b/u/n/Bunker.html" title="Bunker">bunkers</a> and dugouts which had been constructed to strengthen the eastern flank of <a href="../../../a/r/m/Army_Group_North_23f6.html" title="Army Group North">Army Group North</a>. At 8.45 hours, the bombardment shifted from the front lines onto Krasny Bor itself, also striking the villages of Podolvo and Raikelevo (both located east and south-east of Krasny Bor, respectively), the latter being the location of <a href="../../../e/m/i/Emilio_Esteban_Infantes_a737.html" title="Emilio Esteban Infantes">Infantes</a>' forward command post.</p>
<p>At approximately 8:40, the 45th and 63rd Guards and the 72nd Rifle Divisions, followed by some <a href="../../../t/a/n/Tank.html" title="Tank">tanks</a>, advanced towards Staraia Mgsa (east of Krasny Bor), Krasny Bor, Raikelevo and Podolvo; they were met by 5,900 troops of the 250th Infantry Division, holding the eastern flank of the line. Pinned by Soviet shelling, Spanish formations were unable to retreat towards the town and in many cases fought to the death. The frontline was quickly overrun, and many Spanish formations were destroyed there.</p>
<p>Inside Krasny Bor, a company of 250th Infantry Division held the October <a href="../../../r/a/i/Railway_station.html" title="Railway station">Railway Station</a>, repulsing infantry charges and three tank charges by advancing Soviet forces. By 11:00 the company was reduced to 40 combatants yet these managed to hold the factory until 12:00, when they fell back into the town. From 9:00 to 10:40, isolated Spanish units fought off Soviet attacks but were cut off when the Soviets seized the October Railway. Now encircled, the units still holding the Leningrad-Moscow Highway decided to hold as long as possible and were destroyed in combat.</p>
<p>The 55th Army, in the meantime, had advanced despite heavy casualties inflicted by the dug-in Spanish troops. The Soviets took Raikelevo, which cut off Podolvo from Krasny Bor. In Krasny Bor itself the Spanish artillery, <a href="../../../m/i/l/Military_engineer.html" title="Military engineer">engineer</a> and other assorted stragglers came under attack from Soviet infantry and armour, and by 12:00, 63rd Guards Rifle Division reported the capture of Krasny Bor, despite the fact that the southern half of the town was still controlled by the Spanish. Soviet tanks opened fire on a hospital and retreating ambulances but were eventually beaten off by Spanish troops armed with <a href="../../../m/o/l/Molotov_Cocktail_0fd7.html" title="Molotov Cocktail">Molotov Cocktails</a> and <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hand_grenade.html" title="Hand grenade">hand grenades</a>. The afternoon brought belated support for the defenders in the form of a <a href="../../../l/u/f/Luftwaffe.html" title="Luftwaffe">Luftwaffe</a> fighter-bomber attack on the Soviet positions around the town of Kolpino, to the east of Krasny Bor, while the 45th Guards Rifle Division seized Mishkino. Sviridov decided to insert the mobile group into the battle late on the day, but they were stopped by a combination of fierce resistance and a sudden thaw that stopped the Ski Brigade from operating off road. The German command reinforced the Spanish defenses with battle groups</p>
<p>The 55th Army advanced as far as the central-western part of the town, and after 15:15 managed to push a small formation into the rear of the Spanish division's forward command post. Meanwhile the remaining Spanish troops were ordered to new positions on the <a href="../../../i/z/h/Izhora_River_474f.html" title="Izhora River">Izhora River</a>, on the west of the town. Here they held out against 55th Army's last attacks of the day.</p>
<p>After 16:30 hours a battle group of the German 212th Infantry Divisions and two companies each of the <a href="../../../6/t/h/6th_SS_Volunteer_Sturmbrigade_Langemarck_c63e.html" title="6th SS Volunteer Sturmbrigade Langemarck">Flemish Legion</a> and the Lithuanian Legion were able to support the Spanish by a counter-attack on the forest at Staraya Rechka, and by taking over the frontline from the highway to the Izhora River.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, the 55th Army had advanced 4-5 kilometers and captured Krasny Bor, Mishkino, Staraya Mirza, Stepanovka, and Popovka Station. On its left wing, the attack by 43rd Rifle Division and 34th Ski Brigade had had initial success, driving the 4th SS Police Division into the Tosno River.</p>
<p>In the Ishora River sector, 72nd Rifle Division pushed back the lines of the Spanish towards the river, destroying the Field Replacement Battalion, but suffering up to 70% casualties in the process.</p>

<p>The next day, <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_11.html" title="February 11">11 February</a> <a href="../../../1/9/4/1943.html" title="1943">1943</a>, left forward 55th Army units surrounded in several places, but 55th Army in control of Krasny Bor by evening.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_map"><sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Krasny_Bor_b872.html#endnote_map" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Krasny_Bor_b872.html#endnote_map" rel="nofollow">[4]</a></sup></span> A planned counter-attack by the Spanish division and the German 112th Infantry Division was thought likely to be successful, but ultimately not carried out due to concern over the overall position of 18th Army.</p>
<p>By <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_13.html" title="February 13">13 February</a>, 55th Army had lost almost a third of its initial strength and most of its tanks, and could no longer advance. The total penetration achieved reached to a depth of 4-5 kilometres on a frontage of 14 kilometres. After the Spanish 262nd infantry Regiment and 1st Artillery Battalion evacuated, they bombarded the Soviet positions and attempted a counter-attack to recapture Krasny Bor on <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_12.html" title="February 12">12 February</a>. The attack by 55th Army made a flanking attack by 67th Army in the Sinyavino sector easier, because of the withdrawal of German forces from the sector.</p>
<p>The main road to <a href="../../../m/o/s/Moscow.html" title="Moscow">Moscow</a> was still controlled by the 18th Army, despite the capture of 3 km of railway line, and the Soviets launched their last major attack in this sector on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_19.html" title="March 19">19 March</a> <a href="../../../1/9/4/1943.html" title="1943">1943</a>. It was also repelled with heavy losses on both sides.</p>
<p>Soviet general staff critiques after the battle highlighted the reasons for the failure of the attacks during Operation Polar Star as strongly fortified defenses, faulty reconnaissance, poor command and control on all levels, clumsy employment of tanks and ineffective artillery support.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_reason"><sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Krasny_Bor_b872.html#endnote_reason" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Krasny_Bor_b872.html#endnote_reason" rel="nofollow">[5]</a></sup></span></p>

<p>The failure by the 55th Army to follow through on its initial success meant that the encirclement of the German forces in the Mga sector had lost its northern pincer. Failures by the other attacking armies, for similar reasons, led to the overall failure of the grandly conceived Operation Polar Star. It would take almost another year before 18th Army withdrew from the direct approaches to Leningrad. The German 50th Corps, and there in particular the 250th (Spanish) Infantry Division had managed to hold the Red Army inside the perimeter of the siege of Leningrad, at a heavy cost in casualties.</p>

<p>On <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_15.html" title="February 15">15 February</a> the 250th Infantry Division reported casualties of 3,645 wounded or killed and 300 missing or taken prisoner (a 75% casualty rate). It claimed 11,000 Soviet troops of the 55th Army had been killed in the five days beginning <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_9.html" title="February 9">9 February</a>, although it must be noted that these claims were probably not verified. Because of these heavy losses and <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allies_of_World_War_II_afb4.html" title="Allies of World War II">Allied</a> pressure on the <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spanish_State_1e6d.html" title="Spanish State">Spanish government</a>, the Blue Division was withdrawn to Germany and later disbanded. A new, smaller volunteer formation called the <a href="../../../b/l/u/Blue_Legion_818c.html" title="Blue Legion">Blue Legion</a> (<i>Legión Azul</i>) remained in combat on the <a href="../../../e/a/s/Eastern_Front_%28World_War_II%29_e4c6.html" title="Eastern Front (World War II)">Eastern Front</a>, attached to 121st Infantry Division until March <a href="../../../1/9/4/1944.html" title="1944">1944</a>, when it also was disbanded and the majority of the volunteers sent back to Spain. The 55th Army eventually took part in the re-capture of <a href="../../../s/a/i/Saint_Petersburg_5667.html" title="Saint Petersburg">Leningrad</a>, securing the Leningrad-Moscow line in 1944. Afterwards, it advanced into <a href="../../../e/s/t/Estonia.html" title="Estonia">Estonia</a> and fought against the <a href="../../../a/r/m/Army_Group_Courland_730a.html" title="Army Group Courland">Courland pocket</a> until <a href="../../../1/9/4/1945.html" title="1945">1945</a>.</p>
<p>Those captured in the battle, on the Spanish side, were sent to <a href="../../../g/u/l/Gulag.html" title="Gulag">gulag</a> camps, primarily in <a href="../../../s/i/b/Siberia.html" title="Siberia">Siberia</a>, and were not repatriated to Spain until <a href="../../../1/9/5/1954.html" title="1954">1954</a>. Krasny Bor remains, for the most part, an obscure battle in modern historical knowledge relating to this devastating war. The Blue Division was awarded a Combat Service Medal, personally designed by <a href="../../../a/d/o/Adolf_Hitler_fdc0.html" title="Adolf Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a>, for its defense of Army Group North's precarious eastern flank.</p>
