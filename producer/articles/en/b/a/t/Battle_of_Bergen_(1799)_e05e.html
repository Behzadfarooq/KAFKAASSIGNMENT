<p>The following is an extract from an article compiled by the British Army's INTELLIGENCE BRANCH OF THE QUARTERMASTER-GENERAL'S DEPARTMENT in 1884</p>
<p>The Duke of York landed on the 15th [September], and assumed the command of the army, which now amounted to about 30,000 men with 1,200 Light Cavalry. At this period the Allies possessed a superiority of force with which it was material, as early as possible, to strike a decisive blow. The Dutch, to the number of 12,000, were in a strong position about Langedijk, somewhat in advance of the French, who, by drawing in all detachments, had raised their field strength to 10,000 men, who were posted in Alkmaar, Bergen, Schoorl, and Egmond-aan-Zee. On the 19th of September the forces, under the Duke of York, formed in four columns, moved forward from Schlagenbrug. The left column, commanded by Sir Ralph Abercromby, consisted of:</p>
<p>Two squadrons 18th Light Dragoons. Major-General the Earl of Chatham’s Brigade. Major-General Sir J Moore’s Brigade. Major-General the Earl of Cavan’s Brigade. First battalion of British Grenadiers of the line. First battalion of Light Infantry of the line. The 53rd and 55th Regiments, under Colonel Macdonald.</p>
<p>The right column, commanded by Lieutenant-General Hermann, consisted of:</p>
<p>The 7th Light Dragoons. Twelve battalions of Russians. Major-General Manners’ Brigade.</p>
<p>The left-centre column, commanded by Lieutenant-General Sir James Pulteney, was composed of:</p>
<p>Two squadrons 11th Light Dragoons. Major-General Don’s Brigade. Major-General Coote’s Brigade.</p>
<p>The right-centre column, under Lieutenant-General Dundas, consisted of:</p>
<p>Two squadrons 11th Light Dragoons. Two brigades of Foot Guards. Major-General H.R.H. Prince William’s Brigade.</p>
<p>The plan of operations was as follows: The left column was to turn the enemy’s right, on the Zuyder Zee; the right was to drive the enemy from the heights of Camperdown, and to seize Bergen; the right-centre had to force the position at Warmenhuizen and Schoorldam, and to cooperate with the right column; while the left-centre had to obtain possession of Oudkarspel, on the main road leading to Alkmaar. The enemy’s left was advantageously posted on the high sand hills which extend from the sea, in front of Petten, to the town of Bergen. The ground over which the centre columns had to move was intersected every three or four hundred yards by broad, deep, wet ditches and canals. The bridges across the few roads leading to the points of attack were destroyed, and obstacles had been carefully arranged. The action was commenced by Lieutenant-General Hermann’s column, which had by 8am, 19th September, obtained possession of Bergen; but in moving against the main body of the enemy, posted in the woods surrounding the village, the Russian troops lost their order, and were driven back. Lieutenant-Generals Hermann and Cherchekov were made prisoners, and their troops were forced back through Bergen to Schoorl, which they also had to abandon. This village was immediately retaken by Major-General Manners’ Brigade, which was then reinforced by two battalions of Russians, by Major-General D’Oyley’s Brigade of Guards, and by the 35th Regiment, under Prince William. The action was renewed by these troops, who in their turn repulsed the enemy; but want of ammunition and the exhausted state of the corps engaged in that part of the field obliged them to retire on Petten and the Zuype Canal. The column under Lieutenant-General Dundas, at dawn, attacked the village of Warmenhuizen, where the enemy, with a large force of artillery, was strongly posted. Three battalions of Russians, under Major-General Sedmoratskiy, moving from Krabbendam, gallantly stormed the left of the village, the 1st Regiment of Guards entering it on the right at the same time. The Grenadier battalion of Guards, the 3rd Regiment of Guards, and the 2nd battalion 5th Regiment, which had been previously detached to march upon Schoorldam to keep up the communication with Sir James Pulteney, were joined by the remainder of the column, which, after taking Warmenhuizen, had been reinforced by the 1st battalion 5th Regiment, and the whole moved forward and seized the village, which they held under a galling fire of artillery until the conclusion of the action. The left-centre column, though opposed by the bulk of the Batavian army, under General Daendels, had overcome all opposition and taken possession of Oudkarspel, thus securing the direct line of advance on Alkmaar. Sir Ralph Abercromby had equally well accomplished his task by capturing the town of Hoorn, on the coast of the Zuyder Zee, and placing himself in a favourable position for completing the turning movement. However, in consequence of the partial failure on the right, it was considered necessary to recall all the troops and re-occupy the former position. In this action the force under Sir Ralph Abercromby took no direct part; consequently the allied troops engaged amounted to no more than from 15,000 to 18,000 men. The losses on both sides were considerable: English: 6 officers, 2 sergeants, 109 rank-and-file, killed; 43 officers, 20 sergeants, 2 drummers, 345 rank-and-file, wounded; 22 sergeants, 5 drummers, 463 rank-and-file, missing. Russians: 1,741 non-commissioned officers, rank-and-file, and 44 officers, killed or captured. 1,225, including 49 officers, wounded. Republicans: 3,000 prisoners, including 60 officers. 16 guns taken. The failure of this attack by the Allies was due to the careless action of the Russian troops, and to the loss of their two principal officers at the most critical period of the struggle. The corps under Sir Ralph Abercromby began their march on the evening of the 18th September, but his advance was delayed by the bad state of the roads, and he arrived at Hoorn many hours later than was expected. The objects to be gained by the movements of this column would, if attained, have had a material effect on the result of the whole expedition, and could only be attempted while the Duke of York possessed a superiority of force. The enemy had left their right uncovered, and a very strong country unoccupied, from which it was evident that it would have been very difficult for them to correct their error if the attack on that flank had been vigorously carried out, and they had also left Amsterdam undefended on the only side by which it was accessible. The strength of the column which attacked Bergen would have been more than sufficient if it had been employed with common prudence. This column was at all times very superior in numbers to the enemy who opposed it, but it moved in mass in an intersected country, never covered its flanks, and its operations having, contrary to order, been commenced long before daylight, its fire wsa probably more destructive to itself than to the enemy. That the other columns were not too weak is sufficiently shown by their having taken and held, until recalled, the points against which they had been directed. The Republicans re-occupied all the positions from which they had been driven, and their general line of defence was now covered on the right by inundations, the only roads across which were covered by field works. The space between Alkmaar and the Zuyder Zee was thus rendered defensible by small numbers, and Amsterdam was secured on the land side. The remainder of the army, which had been reinforced, was concentrated between the Langedijk and the sea, and the post of Oudkarspel was strengthened by additional works, and by inundations. Schoorldam and the Koedijk were also fortified.</p>
