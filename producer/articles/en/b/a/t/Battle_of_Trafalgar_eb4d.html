<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Trafalgar_eb4d.html" title="Edit section: Origins">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Origins</span></h2>
<p>In 1805, the <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_French_Empire_8d79.html" title="First French Empire">First French Empire</a>, under <a href="../../../n/a/p/Napoleon.html" title="Napoleon">Napoleon</a>, was the dominant military land power on the European continent, while the British <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Navy_80f7.html" title="Royal Navy">Royal Navy</a> controlled the seas. During the course of the war, the British imposed a <a href="../../../n/a/v/Naval_blockade.html" title="Naval blockade">naval blockade</a> on France, which affected trade and kept the French from fully mobilising their own naval resources. Despite several successful evasions of the blockade by the French navy, it was unable to inflict a major defeat on the British. The British were able to attack French interests at home and abroad with relative ease.</p>
<p>When the <a href="../../../t/h/i/Third_Coalition_6e8c.html" title="Third Coalition">Third Coalition</a> declared war on France after the short-lived <a href="../../../p/e/a/Peace_of_Amiens_80ac.html" title="Peace of Amiens">Peace of Amiens</a>, Napoleon Bonaparte was determined to invade Britain. To do so, he had to ensure that the Royal Navy would be unable to disrupt the invasion <a href="../../../f/l/o/Flotilla.html" title="Flotilla">flotilla</a>, which would require control of the English Channel.</p>
<p>The main French <a href="../../../n/a/v/Naval_fleet.html" title="Naval fleet">fleets</a> were at <a href="../../../b/r/e/Brest%2C_France_092f.html" title="Brest, France">Brest</a> in <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brittany.html" title="Brittany">Brittany</a> and at <a href="../../../t/o/u/Toulon.html" title="Toulon">Toulon</a> on the <a href="../../../m/e/d/Mediterranean_Sea_0b44.html" title="Mediterranean Sea">Mediterranean</a> coast. Other ports on the French Atlantic coast contained smaller <a href="../../../s/q/u/Squadron_%28naval%29.html" title="Squadron (naval)">squadrons</a>. In addition, France and Spain were allied, so the Spanish fleet based in <a href="../../../c/%C3%A1/d/C%C3%A1diz.html" title="Cádiz">Cádiz</a> and <a href="../../../f/e/r/Ferrol.html" title="Ferrol">Ferrol</a> was also available.</p>
<p>The British possessed an experienced and well-trained corps of naval officers. By contrast, most of the best officers in the French navy had either been executed or dismissed from the service during the early part of the <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_Revolution_970a.html" title="French Revolution">French Revolution</a>. As a result, Vice-Admiral <a href="../../../p/i/e/Pierre-Charles_Villeneuve_fc12.html" title="Pierre-Charles Villeneuve">Pierre-Charles Villeneuve</a> was the most competent senior officer available to command Napoleon's Mediterranean fleet. However, Villeneuve had shown a distinct lack of enthusiasm to face Nelson and the Royal Navy after his defeat at the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_the_Nile_7fc3.html" title="Battle of the Nile">Battle of the Nile</a>.</p>
<p>Napoleon's naval plan in 1805 was for the French and Spanish fleets in the Mediterranean and <a href="../../../c/%C3%A1/d/C%C3%A1diz.html" title="Cádiz">Cádiz</a> to break through the blockade and combine in the <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Indies_8d74.html" title="West Indies">West Indies</a>. They would then return, assist the fleet in Brest to emerge from blockade, and in combination clear the <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_Channel_c0e5.html" title="English Channel">English Channel</a> of Royal Navy ships, ensuring a safe passage for the invasion barges. The plan seemed good on paper but as the war wore on, Napoleon's unfamiliarity with naval strategy and ill-advised naval commanders continued to haunt the French.</p>

<p>Early in 1805, Admiral Lord Nelson commanded the British fleet blockading Toulon. Unlike <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Cornwallis_aea7.html" title="William Cornwallis">William Cornwallis</a>, who maintained a tight blockade of Brest with the Channel Fleet, Nelson adopted a loose blockade in hopes of luring the French out for a major battle. However, Villeneuve's fleet successfully evaded Nelson's when his forces were blown off station by storms. While Nelson was searching the Mediterranean for him, Villeneuve passed through the <a href="../../../s/t/r/Straits_of_Gibraltar_0dbd.html" title="Straits of Gibraltar">Straits of Gibraltar</a>, rendezvoused with the Spanish fleet, and sailed as planned to the <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Indies_8d74.html" title="West Indies">West Indies</a>. Once Nelson realized that the French had crossed the <a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlantic_Ocean_570a.html" title="Atlantic Ocean">Atlantic Ocean</a>, he set off in pursuit. <sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Trafalgar_eb4d.html" title="Edit section: Cádiz">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Cádiz</span></h3>
<p>Villeneuve returned from the West Indies to Europe, intending to break the blockade at Brest, but after two of his Spanish ships were captured during the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Cape_Finisterre_%281805%29_7de9.html" title="Battle of Cape Finisterre (1805)">Battle of Cape Finisterre</a> by a squadron under Vice-Admiral Sir <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Calder_4552.html" title="Robert Calder">Robert Calder</a>, Villeneuve abandoned this plan and sailed back to Ferrol.</p>
<p>Napoleon's invasion plans for England depended entirely on having a sufficiently large number of ships of the line before <a href="../../../b/o/u/Boulogne-sur-Mer_baa6.html" title="Boulogne-sur-Mer">Boulogne</a>, <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">France</a>. This would require Villeneuve's force of 32 ships to join Vice-Admiral <a href="../../../h/o/n/Honor%C3%A9_Joseph_Antoine_Ganteaume_7a73.html" title="Honoré Joseph Antoine Ganteaume">Ganteaume</a>'s force of 21 ships at Brest, along with a squadron of five ships under Captain Allemand, which would have given him a combined force of 58 ships of the line.</p>
<p>When Villeneuve set sail from Ferrol on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_10.html" title="August 10">10 August</a>, he was under strict orders from Napoleon to sail northward toward Brest. Instead, he worried that the British were observing his manoeuvres, so on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_11.html" title="August 11">11 August</a> he sailed southward towards <a href="../../../c/%C3%A1/d/C%C3%A1diz.html" title="Cádiz">Cádiz</a> on the southwestern coast of Spain. With no sign of Villeneuve's fleet by <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_26.html" title="August 26">26 August</a>, the three French army corps invasion force near <a href="../../../b/o/u/Boulogne-sur-Mer_baa6.html" title="Boulogne-sur-Mer">Boulogne</a> broke camp and marched to <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germany.html" title="Germany">Germany</a>, where it would become fully engaged.</p>
<p>The same month, Nelson returned home to England after two years of duty at sea, for some well-earned rest. He remained ashore for 25 busy days, and was warmly received by his countrymen, who were understandably nervous about a possible French invasion. Word reached England on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_2.html" title="September 2">2 September</a> about the combined French and Spanish fleet in the harbour of Cádiz. Nelson had to wait until <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_15.html" title="September 15">15 September</a> before his ship <a href="../../../h/m/s/HMS_Victory_0c3b.html" title="HMS Victory">HMS <i>Victory</i></a> was ready to sail.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_15.html" title="August 15">15 August</a>, Cornwallis made the fateful decision to detach 20 ships of the line from the fleet guarding the channel and to have them sail southward to engage the enemy forces in Spain. This left the channel somewhat denuded of ships, with only eleven ships of the line present. However this detached force formed the nucleus of the British fleet that would fight at Trafalgar. Initially this fleet was placed under the command of Vice-Admiral Calder, reaching Cádiz on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_15.html" title="September 15">15 September</a>. Nelson joined the fleet on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_29.html" title="September 29">29 September</a> to take command.</p>
<p>The British fleet used <a href="../../../f/r/i/Frigate.html" title="Frigate">frigates</a> to keep a constant watch on the harbour, while the main force remained out of sight 50 miles (80 km) west of the shore. Nelson's hope was to lure the combined Franco-Spanish force out and engage them in a "pell-mell battle". The force watching the harbour was led by Captain Blackwood, commanding <a href="../../../h/m/s/HMS_Euryalus_%281803%29_4db0.html" title="HMS Euryalus (1803)">HMS <i>Euryalus</i></a>. He was brought up to a strength of seven ships (five frigates and two schooners) on <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_8.html" title="October 8">8 October</a>.</p>

<p>At this point, Nelson's fleet badly needed provisioning. On <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_2.html" title="October 2">2 October</a>, five ships of the line, <a href="../../../h/m/s/HMS_Queen_%281769%29_edaf.html" title="HMS Queen (1769)"><i>Queen</i></a>, <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_ship_Franklin_%281797%29_daf0.html" title="French ship Franklin (1797)"><i>Canopus</i></a>, <i>Spencer</i>, <i>Zealous</i>, <i>Tigre</i>, and the frigate <a href="../../../h/m/s/HMS_Endymion_%281797%29_d06c.html" title="HMS Endymion (1797)"><i>Endymion</i></a> were dispatched to <a href="../../../g/i/b/Gibraltar.html" title="Gibraltar">Gibraltar</a> under Rear-Admiral Louis for supplies. These ships were later diverted for convoy duty in the Mediterranean, whereas Nelson had expected them to return. Other British ships continued to arrive, and by <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_15.html" title="October 15">15 October</a> the fleet was up to full strength for the battle. Although it was a significant loss; once the first-rate <i>Royal Sovereign</i> had arrived, Nelson allowed Calder to sail for home in his flagship, the 98-gun <i>Prince of Wales</i>. Calder's apparent lack of aggression during the engagement off Cape Finisterre on <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_22.html" title="July 22">July 22</a>, had caused the Admiralty to recall him for a court martial and he would normally have been sent back to Britain in a smaller ship.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Villeneuve's fleet in Cádiz was also suffering from a serious supply shortage that could not be readily rectified by the cash-strapped French. The blockades maintained by the British fleet had made it difficult for the allies to obtain stores and their ships were ill fitted. Villeneuve's ships were also more than two thousand men short of the force needed to sail. These were not the only problems faced by the Franco-Spanish fleet. The main French ships of the line had been kept in harbour for years by the British blockades with only brief sorties. The hasty voyage across the Atlantic and back used up vital supplies and was no match for the British fleet's years of experience at sea and training. The French crews contained few experienced sailors, and as most of the crew had to be taught the elements of seamanship on the few occasions when they got to sea, gunnery was neglected. Villeneuve's supply situation began to improve in October, but news of Nelson's arrival made Villeneuve reluctant to leave port. Indeed, his captains had held a vote on the matter and decided to stay in the harbour.</p>
<p>On the 16th of September, Napoleon gave orders for the French and Spanish ships at Cadiz to put to sea at the first favourable opportunity, join seven Spanish ships of the line then at <a href="../../../c/a/r/Cartagena.html" title="Cartagena">Cartagena</a>, go to <a href="../../../n/a/p/Naples.html" title="Naples">Naples</a>, and land the soldiers they carried to reinforce his troops there, and fight a decisive action if they met a British fleet of inferior numbers.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Trafalgar_eb4d.html" title="Edit section: Nelson's battle plan">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Nelson's battle plan</span></h2>
<p>Prevailing <a href="../../../n/a/v/Naval_tactics_in_the_Age_of_Sail_8d1b.html" title="Naval tactics in the Age of Sail">tactical orthodoxy</a> at the time involved manoeuvring to approach the enemy fleet in a single <a href="../../../l/i/n/Line_of_battle.html" title="Line of battle">line of battle</a> and then engaging in a parallel line. Nelson instead planned to sail directly into the enemy line, splitting the after part from the front, and concentrating forces against the isolated rear portion.</p>
<p>During the period of <a href="../../../b/l/o/Blockade.html" title="Blockade">blockade</a> off the coast of <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spain.html" title="Spain">Spain</a> in October <a href="../../../h/o/r/Horatio_Nelson%2C_1st_Viscount_Nelson_5aea.html" title="Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson">Nelson</a> instructed his captains as to how he meant to fight the approaching battle over two dinners aboard <a href="../../../h/m/s/HMS_Victory_0c3b.html" title="HMS Victory"><i>Victory</i></a>. The governing principles of his instructions were that the order of sailing in which the fleet was when the enemy was seen was to be the order of battle; that no time was to be wasted in forming a precise line; that the attack was to be made in two bodies, of which one, to be led by the second in command, <a href="../../../c/u/t/Cuthbert_Collingwood%2C_1st_Baron_Collingwood_3323.html" title="Cuthbert Collingwood, 1st Baron Collingwood">Collingwood</a>, was to throw itself on the rear of the enemy, while the other, led by Nelson, was to take care that the centre and vanguard could not come to the assistance of the cut-off ships.</p>
<p>Nelson was careful to point out that something had to be left to chance. Nothing is sure in a sea fight beyond all others; and he left his captains free from all hampering rules by telling them that ‘No captain can do very wrong if he places his ship alongside that of the enemy.’ In short, the execution was to be as circumstances dictated, subject to the guiding rule that the enemy's rear was to be cut off and superior force concentrated on that part of the enemy's line.</p>
<p>The plan had three principal advantages. Firstly, it would allow the British fleet to close with the French-Spanish fleet as quickly as possible, reducing the chance that it would be able to escape without fighting. Secondly, it would quickly bring on a mêlée or pell-mell battle, by breaking the French-Spanish line and inducing a series of individual ship-to-ship fights, in which the British were likely to prevail. Nelson knew that the better seamanship, faster gunnery and higher morale of his crews were decisive advantages that could not be compensated for by any amount of bravery on the part of their opponents. Thirdly, it would bring a decisive concentration on the rear of the French-Spanish fleet. The ships in the van of the enemy fleet would have to turn back to support the rear, which would take a long time.</p>
<p>The main drawback of attacking head on was that the Franco-Spanish ships would be able to maintain a <a href="../../../r/a/k/Raking_fire.html" title="Raking fire">raking</a> <a href="../../../b/r/o/Broadside.html" title="Broadside">broadside</a> fire on the bows of the leading British ships as they approached, to which the British ships would be unable to reply. However, Nelson was well aware that French and Spanish gunners were ill-trained, would in all probability be supplemented with soldiers, and would have difficulty firing accurately from a moving gun platform. In the event, the Combined Fleet was sailing across a heavy swell, causing the ships to roll heavily and exacerbating the problem. Nelson's plan was indeed a gamble, but a carefully calculated one.</p>
<p>Nelson's plan was a radical break from the prevailing <a href="../../../n/a/v/Naval_tactics_in_the_Age_of_Sail_8d1b.html" title="Naval tactics in the Age of Sail">tactical orthodoxy</a>, which involved manoeuvring to approach the enemy fleet in a single <a href="../../../l/i/n/Line_of_battle.html" title="Line of battle">line of battle</a> and then engaging in a parallel line. The intention of going straight at the enemy echoed the <a href="../../../n/a/v/Naval_tactics_in_the_Age_of_Sail_8d1b.html" title="Naval tactics in the Age of Sail">tactics</a> used by <a href="../../../a/d/a/Adam_Duncan%2C_1st_Viscount_Duncan_of_Camperdown_4610.html" title="Adam Duncan, 1st Viscount Duncan of Camperdown">Admiral Duncan</a> at the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Camperdown_23f4.html" title="Battle of Camperdown">Battle of Camperdown</a> and <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Jervis%2C_1st_Earl_of_St_Vincent_535f.html" title="John Jervis, 1st Earl of St Vincent">Admiral Jervis</a> at the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Cape_St._Vincent_%281797%29_d9e3.html" title="Battle of Cape St. Vincent (1797)">Battle of Cape St. Vincent</a>, both in 1797.</p>
<p>In preparation for the battle, Nelson ordered the ships of his fleet painted in a distinctive yellow and black pattern (later known as the Nelson Chequer) that would make them easy to distinguish from their opponents.</p>

<p>On <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_18.html" title="October 18">18 October</a>, <a href="../../../p/i/e/Pierre-Charles_Villeneuve_fc12.html" title="Pierre-Charles Villeneuve">Villeneuve</a> received a letter informing him that Vice-Admiral François Rosily had arrived in <a href="../../../m/a/d/Madrid.html" title="Madrid">Madrid</a> with orders to take command. At the same time, he received intelligence that a detachment of six British ships had docked at <a href="../../../g/i/b/Gibraltar.html" title="Gibraltar">Gibraltar</a> (this was Admiral Louis's squadron). Stung by the prospect of being disgraced before the fleet, Villeneuve resolved to go to sea before his successor could reach Cadiz. Following a gale on <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_18.html" title="October 18">18 October</a>, the fleet began a rapid scramble to set sail.</p>
<p><a name="Departure" id="Departure"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Trafalgar_eb4d.html" title="Edit section: Departure">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Departure</span></h3>
<p>The weather, however, suddenly turned calm following a week of gales. This slowed the progress of the fleet departing the harbour, giving the British plenty of warning. Villeneuve had drawn up plans to form a force of four squadrons, each containing both French and Spanish ships. Following their earlier vote to stay put, the captains were reluctant to leave Cádiz and as a result they failed to follow closely Villeneuve's orders (Villeneuve had reportedly become despised by many of the fleet's officers and crew). As a result, the fleet straggled out of the harbour in no particular formation.</p>
<p>It took most of <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_20.html" title="October 20">20 October</a> for Villeneuve to get his fleet organised, and it set sail in three columns for the Straits of Gibraltar to the south-east. That same evening, the ship <i><a href="../../../f/r/e/French_ship_Achille_%281803%29_0f88.html" title="French ship Achille (1803)">Achille</a></i> spotted a force of 18 British ships of the line in pursuit. The fleet began to prepare for battle and during the night they were ordered into a single line. The following day Nelson's fleet of 27 ships of the line and four frigates was spotted in pursuit from the north-west with the wind behind it. Villeneuve again ordered his fleet into three columns, but soon changed his mind and ordered a single line. The result was a sprawling, uneven formation.</p>
<p>The British fleet was sailing, as they would fight, under signal 72 hoisted on Nelson's flagship. At 5:40 a.m., the British were about 21 miles (34 km) to the north-west of Cape Trafalgar, with the Franco-Spanish fleet between the British and the Cape. At 6 a.m. that morning, Nelson gave the order to prepare for battle.</p>
<p>At 8 a.m., Villeneuve ordered the fleet to <i>wear together</i> and turn back for Cádiz. This reversed the order of the Allied line, placing the rear division under Rear-Admiral <a href="../../../p/i/e/Pierre_Dumanoir_le_Pelley_9901.html" title="Pierre Dumanoir le Pelley">Pierre Dumanoir le Pelley</a> in the <a href="../../../v/a/n/Vanguard.html" title="Vanguard">van</a>. The wind became contrary at this point, often shifting direction. The very light wind rendered manoeuvring all but impossible for the most expert crews. The inexperienced crews had difficulty with the changing conditions, and it took nearly an hour and a half for Villeneuve's order to be completed. The French and Spanish fleet now formed an uneven, angular crescent, with the slower ships generally leeward and closer to the shore.</p>

<p>Villeneuve was painfully aware that the British fleet would not be content to attack him in the old-fashioned way, coming down in a parallel line and engaging from van to rear. He knew that they would endeavour to concentrate on a part of his line. But he was too conscious of the inexperience of his officers and men to consider making counter movements.</p>
<p>By 11 a.m. Nelson's entire fleet was visible to Villeneuve, drawn up in two parallel columns. The two fleets would be within range of each other within an hour. Villeneuve was concerned at this point about forming up a line, as his ships were unevenly spaced and in an irregular formation. The French-Spanish fleet was drawn out nearly five miles (8 km) long as Nelson's fleet approached.</p>
<p>As the British drew closer, they could see that the enemy was not sailing in a tight order, but rather in irregular groups. Nelson could not immediately make out the French flagship as the French and Spanish were not flying command pennants.</p>
<p>The six British ships dispatched earlier to Gibraltar had not returned, so Nelson would have to fight without them. He was outnumbered and outgunned, nearly 30,000 men and 2,568 guns to his 17,000 men and 2,148 guns. The Franco-Spanish fleet also had six more ships of the line, and so could more readily combine their fire. There was no way for some of Nelson's ships to avoid being "doubled on" or even "trebled on".</p>

<p>The battle progressed largely according to Nelson's plan.

Pasco suggested to Nelson that <i>expects</i> be substituted for <i>confides</i>, since the former word was in the signal book, whereas <i>confides</i> would have to be spelt out letter-by-letter. Nelson agreed to the change<sup id="_ref-HMS_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-HMS" title="">[2]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>The term <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a> was widely used at the time to refer to the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>, though the British fleet included significant contingents from <a href="../../../i/r/e/Ireland.html" title="Ireland">Ireland</a>, <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scotland.html" title="Scotland">Scotland</a> and <a href="../../../w/a/l/Wales.html" title="Wales">Wales</a> as well as England. Unlike the photographic depiction, this signal would have been shown on the mizzen mast only and would have required 12 'lifts'. The fleet was approaching the French line in two columns. Leading the windward column in <a href="../../../h/m/s/HMS_Victory_0c3b.html" title="HMS Victory"><i>Victory</i></a> was Nelson, while <a href="../../../c/u/t/Cuthbert_Collingwood%2C_1st_Baron_Collingwood_3323.html" title="Cuthbert Collingwood, 1st Baron Collingwood">Collingwood</a> in <a href="../../../h/m/s/HMS_Royal_Sovereign_%281786%29_958a.html" title="HMS Royal Sovereign (1786)"><i>Royal Sovereign</i></a> led the second, leeward, column.</p>
<p>As the battle opened, the French and Spanish were in a ragged line headed north as the two British columns approached from the west at almost a right angle. The northern, windward column of the British fleet was headed up by Nelson's 100-gun flagship <i>Victory</i>. The leeward column was led by the 100-gun <i>Royal Sovereign</i>, the flagship of Vice-Admiral <a href="../../../c/u/t/Cuthbert_Collingwood%2C_1st_Baron_Collingwood_3323.html" title="Cuthbert Collingwood, 1st Baron Collingwood">Cuthbert Collingwood</a>. Nelson led his line into a feint toward the van of the Franco-Spanish fleet and then turned toward the actual point of attack. Collingwood altered the course of his column slightly so that the two lines converged at the line of attack.</p>
<p>Just before his column engaged the allied forces, Collingwood said to his officers, "Now, gentlemen, let us do something today which the world may talk of hereafter". Because the winds were very light during the battle, all the ships were moving extremely slowly, and the lead British ships were under fire from several of the enemy for almost an hour before their own guns could bear.</p>

At 12:45, <i>Victory</i> cut the enemy line between Villeneuve's flagship <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_ship_Bucentaure_%281804%29_d733.html" title="French ship Bucentaure (1804)"><i>Bucentaure</i></a> and <i>Redoutable</i>. <i>Victory</i> came close to the <i>Bucentaure</i>, firing a devastating <a href="../../../r/a/k/Raking_fire.html" title="Raking fire">raking</a> broadside through her stern which killed and wounded many on her gundecks. Villeneuve thought that boarding would take place, and with the Eagle of his ship in hand, told his men: "I will throw it onto the enemy ship and we will take it back there!" However Admiral Nelson of <i>Victory</i> engaged the 74 gun <i>Redoutable</i>. <i>Bucentaure</i> was left to be dealt with by the next three ships of the British windward column <a href="../../../h/m/s/HMS_Temeraire_%281798%29_ba68.html" title="HMS Temeraire (1798)"><i>Temeraire</i></a>, <a href="../../../h/m/s/HMS_Conqueror_%281801%29_334e.html" title="HMS Conqueror (1801)"><i>Conqueror</i></a> and <a href="../../../h/m/s/HMS_Neptune_%281797%29_e71d.html" title="HMS Neptune (1797)"><i>Neptune</i></a>.</p>
<p>A general mêlée ensued and, during that fight, <i>Victory</i> locked masts with the French <i>Redoutable</i>. The crew of the <i>Redoutable</i>, which included a strong infantry corps (with 3 captains and 4 lieutenants), gathered for an attempt to board and seize the <i>Victory</i>. A <a href="../../../m/u/s/Musket.html" title="Musket">musket</a> bullet fired from the mizzentop of the <i>Redoutable</i> struck Nelson in the left shoulder and passed through his body lodging in his spine. Nelson exclaimed, "They finally succeeded, I am dead." He was carried below decks and died at about 16:30, as the battle that would make him a legend was ending in favour of the British.</p>

Trafalgar Battle, situation at 17h</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>As more and more British ships entered the battle, the ships of the allied centre and rear were gradually overwhelmed. The allied van, after long remaining quiescent, made a futile demonstration and then sailed away. The British took 22 vessels of the Franco-Spanish fleet and lost none. Among the taken French ships were the <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_ship_Aigle_64ea.html" title="French ship Aigle"><i>Aigle</i></a>, <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_ship_Alg%C3%A9siras_8b3d.html" title="French ship Algésiras"><i>Algésiras</i></a>, <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_ship_Berwick_eec1.html" title="French ship Berwick"><i>Berwick</i></a>, <i>Bucentaure</i>, <i>Fougueux</i>, <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_ship_Intr%C3%A9pide_c88e.html" title="French ship Intrépide"><i>Intrépide</i></a>, <i>Redoutable</i>, and <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_ship_Swiftsure_bae8.html" title="French ship Swiftsure"><i>Swiftsure</i></a>. The Spanish ships taken were <i>Argonauta</i>, <i>Bahama</i>, <i>Monarca</i>, <i>Neptuno</i>, <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spanish_ship_San_Agust%C3%ADn_1a59.html" title="Spanish ship San Agustín"><i>San Agustín</i></a>, <i>San Ildefonso</i>, <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spanish_ship_San_Juan_Nepomuceno_329b.html" title="Spanish ship San Juan Nepomuceno"><i>San Juan Nepomuceno</i></a>, <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spanish_ship_Sant%C3%ADsima_Trinidad_3f6e.html" title="Spanish ship Santísima Trinidad"><i>Santísima Trinidad</i></a>, and <i>Santa Ana</i>.

<p>As Nelson lay dying, he ordered the fleet to anchor as a storm was predicted. However, when the storm blew up many of the severely damaged ships sank or ran aground on the <a href="../../../s/h/o/Shoals.html" title="Shoals">shoals</a>. A few of them were recaptured by the French and Spanish prisoners overcoming the small prize crews or by ships sallying from Cádiz.</p>

<p>Only eleven ships regained Cádiz, and of those only five were considered seaworthy. Under captain <a href="../../../j/u/l/Julien_Cosmao_8033.html" title="Julien Cosmao">Julien Cosmao</a>, they set sail two days later and attempted to re-take some of the English prizes; they succeeded in re-capturing two ships, and forced Collingwood to scuttle a number of his prizes.</p>

<p>When Rosily arrived in Cádiz, he found only five French ships remained rather than the 18 he was expecting. The surviving ships remained bottled up in Cádiz until 1808, when Napoleon invaded Spain. The French ships were then seized by the Spanish forces and put into service against France.</p>
<p>HMS <i>Victory</i> made its way to Gibraltar for repairs carrying on board the body of Admiral Nelson. It put into Rosia Bay, Gibraltar and after emergency repairs were carried out it returned to England. Many of the injured crew were brought ashore at Gibraltar and treated in the Naval Hospital. Those that subsequently died from injuries sustained at the Battle are buried in and near the Trafalgar Cemetery, at the south end of Main Street, Gibraltar.</p>
<p>All of the Royal Marine Corps officers in HMS <i>Victory</i> were killed, leaving the Sergeant Major of Marines (who was first by Nelson's side when he was hit) in command of <i>Victory'</i>s Marine detachment.</p>
<p>The Battle took place the very day after the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Ulm_3a51.html" title="Battle of Ulm">Battle of Ulm</a>, and Napoleon did not hear about it for a few weeks - the <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grande_Arm%C3%A9e_6e6e.html" title="Grande Armée">Grande Armée</a> had left Boulogne to meet Britain's allies before they could muster a huge force. He had tight control over the Paris media and kept the defeat a closely guarded secret. In a propaganda move, the battle was declared a "spectacular victory" by the French and Spanish.</p>
<p>Vice-Admiral Villeneuve was taken prisoner aboard his flagship and taken back to England. After his parole in 1806 and return to France, Villeneuve was found in his inn room during a stop on the way to Paris stabbed six times in the chest with a dining knife. While the verdict was that he had committed suicide, he was very likely murdered on the orders of Napoleon. Villeneuve had fallen from favour with Napoleon before Trafalgar and it was rumoured he was to be relieved of command. Losing the battle resulted in further disfavour with Napoleon.</p>
<p>Less than two months later, the War of the <a href="../../../t/h/i/Third_Coalition_6e8c.html" title="Third Coalition">Third Coalition</a> ended with a decisive French victory over Russia and Austria, Britain's allies, at the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Austerlitz_4bfe.html" title="Battle of Austerlitz">Battle of Austerlitz</a>. Prussia decided not to join the Coalition and, for a while, France was at peace again. However, it could no longer defeat Britain at sea, so Napoleon went on to impose a continental blockade in an attempt to deny Britain trade with the continent.</p>

<p>Following the battle, the Royal Navy was never again seriously challenged by the French fleet in a large-scale engagement. Napoleon had already abandoned his plans of invasion before the battle and they were never revived.</p>
<p>Nelson became - and remains - Britain's greatest naval war hero, and an inspiration to the Royal Navy, yet his unorthodox tactics were only infrequently emulated by later generations.

<p>The disparity in losses has been attributed by some historians less to Nelson's daring tactics, than to the difference in fighting readiness of the two fleets<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup>. Nelson's fleet was made up of ships of the line which had spent considerable amount of sea time during months of blockades of French ports, whilst the French fleet had generally been at anchor in port. However, Villeneuve's fleet had spent just spent months at sea crossing the Atlantic twice, the main difference was the morale of the leaders.</p>
<p>The Royal Navy proceeded to dominate the seas for the remaining years of sail. Although the victory at Trafalgar was typically given as the reason at the time, modern analysis by historians such as <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Kennedy_acb0.html" title="Paul Kennedy">Paul Kennedy</a> suggests that relative economic strength was a more important underlying cause of British naval mastery.</p>
<p>An anecdotal consequence, somehow related to Trafalgar, is that <a href="../../../r/a/n/Ranks_in_the_French_Navy_67a1.html" title="Ranks in the French Navy">French Navy officers have not been called "sir"</a> ever since for some reason.</p>
