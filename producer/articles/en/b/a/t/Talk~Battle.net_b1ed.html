<dl>
<dd>There are typically four types of people who go on Battle.net;</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>1) Gamers - The gamers go on to play either Diablo II, StarCraft, Warcraft III, and sometimes Warcraft II. Some gamers join "clans" that allow them to game together or fight against other clans in games.</dd>
</dl>
<p>So basically, "gamers" are people that play the game? Does this really need to be pointed out?</p>
<dl>
<dd>2) Map Makers - These are usually clans of organized people that create maps for the gamers to play on. Map makers are usually associated with Starcraft, but there are a few Warcraft 3 map makers.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Some reference to where you found this information would be nice. Or did you conduct your own survey and found this information?</p>
<dl>
<dd>3) Warrers - The warrers join clans and fight (war) with other clans, but they do it outside of the game. Some warrers use massload bots with join spams to "fill up" a rival clan's channel. Since the channel limit is 40, when they get "full" no more users can join the channel. Other warrers use floods to disable clients and bots of a channel, sometimes even causing them to drop offline.</dd>
</dl>
<p>OK this is the most confusing paragraph I've ever read. Who came up with the word "warrers"? What does it mean to "join clans and fight (war)"? Are they having rap-wars? What is "massload bots" with "join spams" that "fill up" a rival's clan's channel? Are you on crack??</p>
<p>Other warrers use floods to disable clients and bots of a channel? What are floods, what are clients, and what are bots?</p>
<p>See what I'm getting at? This thread is so people can find out information about Battle.net. Reading this section would confuse the hell out of me if I never used Battle.net. And I doubt the majority of Battle.net users know what you're talking about either.</p>
<dl>
<dd>4) Chatters. Chatters go on just to communicate with other Battle.net users. A sub-group of chatters is the role-players. They can typically be found in the channel Town Square, or one of the many standard channels all players enter when connecting to Battle.net.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Yes, this is pretty typical of gaming servers. Doesn't need to be pointed out.</p>
<p>Major reworking needs to be done on this if you plan to put it back into the article.</p>

<dd>I concur Dearly, but there might be a place in wikipedia for this information if it isn't original research. I agree with you that it doesn't belong here, especially if it isn't verifiable. <a href="../../../m/c/k/User%7EMckaysalisbury_3eaf.html" title="User:Mckaysalisbury">McKay</a> 16:51, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Im a Warrer myself, and some of the things mentioned here are true to the core, but there are other key elements about it that are needed. – — … ° ≈ ± − × ÷ ← → · § LorDYeP&#160;: LorDYeP 08:33, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I couldn't help but notice this, but it seems like the Community &amp; External links section of this article is nothing but a large advertisement for Valhalla Legends (vL), the creators of BNLS and all other items listed in those sections. If bots arn't a important topic to seekers of battle.net information, then why would they want to know about the creators and creations of such bot programmers? The section should either be expanded in order to include developers other than Valhalla Legends, or reworded to let people know that vL is not the only group of people making any developments related to battle.net. I doubt anyone reading this article would care to know that 'BNCSUtil.dll' has been ported to .NET, BNCSUtil should have it's own article. And the external links section needs to be edited to include information related to battle.net itself, not BNLS Protocol Specifications and ClanGnome information, more vL crap. Instead, links should be posted to various areas on battle.net's informative website and major community sites that have sprung up around the battle.net community. I'm not trying to take a stab at vL, but this article was clearly written with them in mind and it really gives a skewed view at what battle.net is. <a href="../../../6/4/2E/User%7E64.12.116.130.html" title="User:64.12.116.130">Matt</a> 02:57, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>

<dl>
<dd>I agree with Matt. I think one or more vL members added stuff to this article, basically promoting themselves. We should also not be advertising clan names in sections such as listing "known warring clans". I believe the Battle.net Community section should be made into a seperate article. I removed the vL external links. Not appropriate for the article, but would possibly be acceptable in a seperate article about the Battle.net community. <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDuran_064a.html" title="User:Duran">Duran</a> 03:02, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree with whoever removed the "four types of people" section--that was highly specific and bias and shouldn't have been in a Wikipedia article. If I recall correctly, Valhalla's Legend had their own article at one point, but majority agreed that it should be merged with Battle.net as they are the lead innovators in Battle.net developement, or something along those lines. I noticed that the Community section has gone into too much detail, specifically with "Imitators" and "Other Similar Products". Those two subsections in particular are way too specific and bias and should probably not even be there, and just have one single subsection per topic in the Community section (BNLS is broken up into two at the moment). Keep it simple and interesting. Also, creating a new article Battle.net_(community) for this is probably a good idea, so we can keep the original Battle.net article respectable.dearly 22:36, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I doubt it was intended as an ad (or that anybody from vL had anything to do with it), but I agree that the development section is horribly written. It goes to a level of technical detail that is out of sync with the rest of the article about things that are more or less trivial to Battle.net in general. A more elegant way to deal with it might be to have a short section briefly outlining the usage of third-party clients by Battle.net's users and the reasons for them, and to then link to such a community article (I do think the community contributions should be preserved somewhere). I could clean this up myself, but as a primary source I am not sure it is my place to do so. <a href="../../../z/a/k/User%7EZakath_8d11.html" title="User:Zakath">Zakath</a> 04:58, 11 July 2006 (UTC)

<p>warrers isnt a type of battle.net people, i wouldnt classify a few kids with bots as a type. Instead i would replace that with "Backstabbers" or "BSERS" or "Game wreckers" that last ones a niche name but it still works. They a far more prominant type of people. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 81.179.71.183 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_81.179.71.183_dd6d.html" title="Special:Contributions/81.179.71.183">contribs</a>) .</small></p>
<p>I disagree with the above statement because many clans, gaming and warring alike, brought problems to many clans if not discouraged the members to be apart of the clan. Many clans on battle.net also were "warring clans" and are very well known for "warring". Many people who also use bots that connect to battle.net required a type of filters to protect themselves from flooding and warrers. Also, Moderation bots were created inorder to defend your channel against this warring. I think anyone who was apart of battle.net witnessed warring, making it a large part of the program. <a href="../../../f/a/d/User%7EFaDeS_3f58.html" title="User:FaDeS">FaDeS</a></p>

<p>I think a section on channel warring and bots should be added because a significantly large segment of Battle.net users participate in channel wars and use bots. As they are an unavoidable part of the Battle.net experience, they should be noted.</p>
<p>Compile what you know here and when there's enough to constitute a new section, some one will come along and edit it into a good paragraph or two.</p>

<p>significantly large segment of Battle.net users: wrong.Most users play games,some chat,some are clan members(clearly a minority,evident on any game channel).amount of people who actively disrupt chat activities(flood,spam,harrasment,clan warring) is neglicible.Its ignorant to assume that rival clans use members for such exploits.Its usually one expirienced user who controls a bot(s) on multiple accounts to intrude rival clan channel or spam one of public channels. This is comparable to spamming,which is controlled by very few that disrupt chat expirience across all battle.net(this is attributed to commerical(websites organized for companies dedicated to this scale of activity,such as "D2legit" which operates in public Diablo2 channels ) Diablo II item spam,trivia bots(most use same old questions copied years ago), and clan advertisements(some just promote the clan instead of recruiting or any practical reason)) frequently utilizing dozens of open proxies(or shell accounts that run their bots/scripts).</p>

<p>Dont know how relevant any of this is, or if all of my facts are correct. This is entirely based on my own recolection...</p>
<p>Originally in all "Private" channels (that is: all channels not specifically designated public by blizzard) users were given ops (Operators status, giving them the ability to kick/ban others from the channel) based on their cronological order (unless a designated heir were chosen by the current op using the "/designate" command). Ops moved on to the next person whenever a op left the channel.</p>
<p>This is what spawned the need for Ops Bots, Allowing users to keep ops for long periods of time, while retaining the ability to ban others from the channel. This then started the rivalry for securing top spot, and taking over popular channels, etc. The most popular ops bot of the time was Ultimate Bot (<a href="http://www.ultimatebot.com/" class="external free" title="http://www.ultimatebot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.ultimatebot.com/</a>). After the Ultimate Bot project was halted and eventually fell behind all of the Battle.net patches, a number of other ops bots sprung up. The current favorite ops bot is Stealth Bot (<a href="http://www.stealthbot.net" class="external free" title="http://www.stealthbot.net" rel="nofollow">http://www.stealthbot.net</a>).</p>
<p>In addition to Ops bots mass loading bots sprung up like the popular zDs bot. This allowed people to load a large mass of bots. At some point Battle.net was exploited somehow allowing multiple bots to load up on a single cd key. That didnt last too long and as it is now you can only load 1 bot per cd key and sustain 8 connections per ip (or proxy). This encouraged people to collect CD-Keys and Proxies to load up all these bots. There have been a good number of scam programs out (especially bots) that would report any cd keys you gave it to the creator of the bot. Besides that alot of people used trojan horses to steal keys from other gamers. People trade cd keys as well.</p>
<p>At some point Clan channels were introduced. This allowed users to join the channel "Clan [USERNAME]", giving that username automatic ops upon entering the channel. This also allowed for up to 2 operators since the auto-oped username could use "/designate [USERNAME]" to designate a heir then rejoin the channel giving that username ops and since the clan originator gets auto ops both ops remain. This is important since once a account is given ops there is no way of booting it from ops unless you have direct access to it. This allowed for rival clans to trick someone into giving a spy access to an ops bot allowing the rival clan to put one of their bots in ops and just ban all of its members.</p>
<p>Shortly after the introduction of Warcraft 3 Clan Channels became "Op" Channels where instead of the traditional "Clan [USERNAME]", you could go to "Op [USERNAME]" to acheive the same effect. Clan channels became a more complicated system where you are required to have at least 10 Warcaft3 persons/bots (each its own cd-key) to create a clan channel. The initial clan creater becomes the Chieftan of the clan and can assign some 20 or so clan members the rank of Shaman which makes them auto-oped in the channel.</p>
<p>To this day it is not uncommon to come acrossed a clan "load" where some person will load a giant bundle of bots (somtimes in exess of 500 bots -- each being its own valid cd-key), though it has now become a frivallous display of a persons coolness.</p>
<p>There are also brute forcing bots that will try to crack a persons password at a rapid rate by just trying out passwords in a given sequence. These have been pretty much put out of commission since the introduction of the email recovery system that blizzard just recently put in its games.</p>
<p>Lastly there are the win bots common on Starcraft that rule the starcraft ladder with wins/losses that are completely unreasonable. Though ive never found use for a win bot, its basically used again for coolness, in that they generally take a good deal of resources in regards to keys/proxies/time. Nobody takes the starcraft ladder seriously anymore.</p>
<p>According to popular belief the USWest server is where most of the warring clans reside(d), and USEast is more about gaming and map making.</p>
<p>^.^ That'll be it for me.</p>

Um this is coming from a Warrer who did this day to day, and to tell you the truth, you guys went way off topic here. For starters, Warring didnt start with the introduction of Clan channels, it only fueled the fire. Warring has been going on since 1998 on Battle.Net, Only Recently in 2000-Present has it started to become more popular.</p>
<p>Warring is basically this. You scan for proxies, using a Proxy Scanner, such as Tiny Elite Scanner (TLS) or PFinder. What you do then is put in a Proxy RANGE. Example: 201.1.0.0- 202.0.0.0 Port:1080. Than you Start the scan at say 200 Socks. and of Course, a Test Server,Site. Ive used Battle.Net Servers as Test sites. Because when you War, you need about 250-800 Proxies for a REALLY Good Load. This is because, One IP Can Support 8 CD-Keys or however you want to Word it, on Battle.Net, before you are IP Banned. And whoever said more than 500? Try more than 4000. I always loaded more than 800 every tme I loaded. But for those who know what I Speak of, it can get ugly Fast. Not the Clan Situations, but the Consequences of Warring. Warring can cause you to lose your Client Key for the Games you Actually play on Battle.Net, The Voiding of Your Massloading//Flooding Keys, and the Banning of your Username Accounts. And a Final Warning in an attempt by Battle.Net, is to IP Ban your IP Address for a Long Time.</p>
<p>ALSO *WARNING* For those Attempting to load DO NOT load During Weekdays until 10:30-11pm Monday-Friday (EST is the time) Weekends are the times to load because Battle.Net Representatives are Offline than, however a Idle Rep might be in the channel your trying to load or flood. to determine this, if the channel is filled @ 39 or less, theres a rep, if it fills @ 40 than its good to go. Happy Hunting.</p>
<p>Now, for those who are curious as to Defend a Load, its Simple...There are a few Moderation Bots aka Ops, to use. I would Go with Neglected Fury, made by Fleet- or l2uthless Ops made by l2k-Shadow...</p>
<p>With these Bots, they have the Commands such as Loadban, Floodban, Autoload, etc. What they do, is ban any bot coming in too fast after a ban, or infact even a user coming in at the wrong time.</p>
<p>An Easier way to End it, Clan Channels only...Is to Clan Private. this means to basically block access to the channel accept for Clan Members only (The members in the War3 Clan). But This is Considered to be Weak..</p>
<p>And For those of you knowing who I am, I am YeP@USEast, aka Apostasy@USEast and Deathstar@USWest. I am one of the Great Warrers of USEast, only 2-3 People can say they are better than me.</p>
<p>I Always Loaded with 600+ Keys and around 300-1k Proxies. Im the Former Secretary of War for Clan vN Former Secretary of War for Clan HunT Former Leader of Clan PwN Former Leader of Clan WaR Former General of Clan EgN Former Member of Clan aC Former Squad Commander of Clan RH</p>

<p>It looks like you described the entire history of Battle.net up to the present, but it's all about how people hacked the server? Battle.net is a gaming network--that's what this article is supposed to be about. Why are you going into such major detail about "bots," "ops," "mass loading," etc.? How many people seeking information on Battle.net would really care about this as it has absolutely no relevance to the purpose of Battle.net...</p>
<p>It looks like you put A LOT of time into researching and documenting this, but what you written in several paragraphs should be summed up into one and put into some "Battle.net hackers" category.</p>

<dd>I feel that bots, warring, and hacks are as big a part of Battle.net as is its original intention. I feel that the full history of Battle.net should be preserved. I believe all of these things contributed to its overall success and cult-like following. When you say "How many people seeking information on Battle.net would really care about this as it has absolutely no relevance to the purpose of Battle.net" i think you are very wrong. It seems ignorant to me that you should assume that people do/will not care about the full history/evolution of such an influential medium. Eventhough Battle.nets original purpose was not to harbor actions such as botting, warring, etc, i believe it played an important part in the evolution of the internet. I will agree that much of this information may be inapporopriate for the "Battle.net" thread itself, however, it may occupy a thread of its own as FrozenVoid and yourself have suggested. I'm not sure that there should nessisarilly be a section on "Battle.net Hacking" as much as Battle.net Community, bots and waring were all products of the social environment. My article above was meant to simply get the ball rolling. I do not presume to know all there is to know on the subject, i merely meant to provide a framework. On a side note, i feel that the term "ops" was fairly clearly defined in my article, eventhough it is irrelevant because i never meant for my article to be generally published in the first place. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShixish_bcb9.html" title="User:Shixish">Shixish</a> 18:42, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The first one you mentioned it was not related the the parts I believe should not be removed, the second mention of it was in a discussion about adding Bots and Warring data to this article (nothing in the article itself). The third one is the first mention I saw of it, yet the content was removed <i>before</i> you posted that, so there was no discussion about that section being Original Research before it was removed.

<dd>Not that it concerns me a whole lot, as I added the link there to be helpful, but how is it any more of a violation than the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_of_Warcraft_d385.html" title="World of Warcraft">World of Warcraft</a> article linking to a WoW Wiki and fan sites? I'm pretty sure all those links you've given apply to the articles themselves, not external links. I believe a link to a wiki that is dedicated to the specifics of the article itself is quite noteworthy. --dearly 23:26, 20 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I can't speak for all of the content on that page, but I would presume that wowwiki might be notable. It is an approved fansite by blizzard. I personally know that bnetwiki violates <a href="../../../s/o/a/WP%7ESOAP_5cc8.html" title="WP:SOAP">WP:SOAP</a> and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, so it shouldn't be here. Maybe someone should evaluate the links on the WoW page, but that's different. <a href="../../../m/c/k/User%7EMckaysalisbury_3eaf.html" title="User:Mckaysalisbury">McKay</a> 00:01, 21 February 2007 (UTC)
