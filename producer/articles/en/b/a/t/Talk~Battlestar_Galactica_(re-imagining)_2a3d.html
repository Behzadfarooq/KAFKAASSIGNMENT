<p>During a showing of new TV series by the m,ajor networks to the TV media in June, 2003. Bonnie Hammer the President of the Sci-Fi Channel was there to show off the mini-series along with the show's star Edward James Olmos. Bonnie Hammer stated that this new version that fans of the original 1978 series will like this new version. Edward James Olmos immediately stepped up and stated, "Actually fans of the original series will hate this new version they are better off buying the DVDs that are coming out." Reporters that attended the news conference there said that Bonnie Hammer had a shocked looked on her face. Some that were closer to the stage reported heard Bonnie Hammer saying something to the effect, "oh, kill me now." As the news conference kept going everytime Bonnie Hammer said something positive about the new version, Edward Olmos kept saying something negative saying the original fans shouldn't watch it.</p>

<p>Should there be some discussion about some of the backlash from fans of the original? While I think the new Galactica is one of the best shows on TV there was a LOT of backlash from fans of the original who just could not adjust to the new version</p>

<p>How do we know it's a distant galaxy? In fact, isn't it supposed to be the same galaxy that Earth is in? <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEvercat_8d16.html" title="User:Evercat">Evercat</a> 20:37, 17 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>For the 'modern' version of Battlestar Galactica, we don't. In the original there was a line in the end about the rag-tag fleet at the edge of their galaxy and venturing across space to another one - something to that effect. It was very clear, at least, that they were to find Earth in a different galaxy in that episode (don't have the ep. title ATM). [We won't get into the sheer impossibility of the rag-tag fleet venturing through and across totally empty space to a different galaxy...]</dd>
<dd>Perhaps it should read: <i>on a distant world lie the Twelve Colonies of Kobol...</i> instead?</dd>

<p>It would have to be the same galaxy.

<p>This occurred to me after seeing the mini-series. The "12 tribes of Kobol" struck me as being somewhat analogous to the "12 tribes of Israel." When they mentioned the "13th tribe" that went to Earth, it also reminded me of Mormonism. Don't the Mormons believe that there was a 13th tribe of Israel that crossed the ocean and settled in North America? If so, is this parallel only coincidence? I never saw the original series, did it contain this same mythology? In any case, is it even worth mentioning in the article? --<a href="../../../b/j/s/User%7EBjsiders_eb21.html" title="User:Bjsiders">Bjsiders</a> 15:50, 24 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Mormons believe that there were 12 tribes of Israel. However, they believe that the "Ten Lost Tribes of Israel" settled in North America. The creator of the original series, Glen A. Larson, is Mormon so this parallel is probably not a coincidence. <a href="../../../k/i/t/User%7EKitHutch_df66.html" title="User:KitHutch">KitHutch</a> 15:59, 24 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The original BSG had a huge Mormon influence. In one of the early episodes, Adama conducts a wedding - "sealing" the couple (a somewhat distinctive Mormon term). That influence is largely from Glen Larson, who is Mormon. In the original it was very intentional, but not in a "let's push Mormonism on people" way, rather a "let's draw parallels to Earth," etc., way.</dd>

<p>The <a href="../../../q/u/o/Quorum_of_the_12.html" title="Quorum of the 12">Quorum of the 12</a> (a political body in BSG) looks like a direct reference to the Mormon group of the same name. Wclapier 05:02, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This is the text of the original press release regarding the announcement of the additional 6 episodes.</p>
<p><i>"Battlestar Galactica, the update of the classic 1979 television series that is at the center of a war between the studio that produces it and the fans who can't wait for its January, 2005 launch on the US Sci Fi Channel, has been given an extra six-episode pickup. This will bring the total for season one to 19 episodes.</i></p>
<p><i>While this doesn't guarantee a second season, it is seen as a good sign. Executive producer David Eick told Sci Fi Magazine, "Just after I finished exhaling, it'll be time to jump right back into it".</i></p>
<p><i>The success of the series during its run on the Sky One channel in the UK has been cited as the primary reason to order more episodes before the series has even premiered in the US. The new series has generated a high amount of interest and has been one of the most active downloads in the various file trading groups, something that has worried Galactica's producer, Universal Studios, to the point of taking action against fans who would try to see the series early. This early indicator of the series' success would seem to torpedo some of the studio's own arguments against the file traders that included the possibility of diminished ratings and loss of revenue for the series. Battlestar Galactica will premiere on the US Sci Fi Channel on January 14th, 2005."</i></p>
<p>Clearly states the additional episodes will be added to the end of series one, and not become part of series two.</p>

<p>I think the opening text before each episode should be removed as it is misleading. It changes throughout the series, and while it is still composed of mainly the same lines, some are added or removed depending on the needs of the individual episode.</p>

<p>As of Season 2, unless I'm misremembering, the US opening titles match the UK opening titles. The three episodes broadcast on NBC also used the UK titles, including the population count.</p>

He hasn't been seen or mentioned since. He was never credited as a regular or as a regular guest, and he hasn't appeared in the second series, so the removal is a good decision. <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanonblack_67f7.html" title="User:Canonblack">Canonblack</a> 17:43, 11 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Now that a new season of Battlestar is coming out; I wonder if the title should be changed from <b>Battlestar Galactica (2003)</b> to something like <b>Battlestar Galactica (mini series)</b> or something similar?

<dd>Hm. It seems that both the miniseries AND the new TV show have their own articles now, making this a catch-all for all the new stuff. This makes the "2003" moniker even less appropriate. I even more strongly propose that we rename this article "Battlestar Galactica (re-imagining)" now, especically considering that the first line is, "This article is about the re-imagining..." etc. I mean, this article is no longer about any specific instance of the show from 2003, right?

<dd>The general concept of BSG being "re-imagined" isn't directly associated with 2003, other than that the <b>miniseries</b> aired in 2003. If "Battlestar Galactica (2003)" is a term that's supposed to describe Ron Moore's version of the show as a whole, then that term should include the miniseries and the series, not exclude them and force them into different pages. The re-imagining didn't just happen in 2003, it first aired in 2003. And it's still being re-imagined right now, and it will be for as long as the show goes on. So the year, if it is used in the title, should indicate the starting point for this version of the show. And the miniseries and the series would be subsections of that article, because they're part of the same production. But even then, we're just basically finding another way of saying "The reimagined series." So basically, ToastyKen is spot on. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaprica_c6f0.html" title="User:Caprica">Caprica</a> 13:21, 23 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>There are significant differences in the titles between the UK and overseas versions of the show. The "reflective" segment of the title sequence has vocals over a lilting theme in the UK version, while the overseas version is slow and somber and lacks vocals. The UK and overseas versions have the same music in the "active" segment of the titles, using a fast-paced version of the distinctive taiko drumming that characterises the Galactica score.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The contrasting UK and overseas versions arose as a result of creative differences between Moore, the series composer Richard Gibbs and the Sci Fi Channel's management. The Vedic vocals were originally devised as "temp music" intended to serve as a placeholder for a forthcoming score. Moore and fellow producer David Eick liked the temp music so much that they opted to retain it, and instructed Gibbs to work it up into a full score, though the composer himself was far from happy with this</dd>
</dl>
<p>Should the references to UK instead be U.S.? I don't know as I have not caught myself up on the series or its origins, but if the series is airing first in the U.S., then I imagine the 'overseas' would be the U.K.-airing ones. 12.106.100.92 19:28, 15 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Nope, 'cos the series aired in the UK first. You lot are overseas to us, you know. Typical US-centrism. Tut tut. (Just kidding.) My version of the DVD, which I assume (being bought in the UK to run on a UK DVD player) is the UK version of the series, has the nice lilting vocals. So I believe the article is correct as it stands.</dd>

<dd>I don't think a page for that term would survive an AFD. Frak has been used in both BSG series and also has had limited use in the "real world". Felgercarb has developed no such notability.

<p>The intro contains the line: "in the tradition of Star Trek, the writers use science fiction to examine contemporary social, moral and ethical issues in allegory."</p>
<p>It'd probably be more accurate to say: "in the tradition of <i>science fiction</i>, the writers use science fiction to examine contemporary social, moral and ethical issues in allegory." It's not like this is original or unique to Star Trek.</p>
<dl>
<dd>While it's true that the original series of star trek was not the first (nor the only) science fiction to explore societal issues (if I had to guess, that honor belongs to <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Time_Machine_5e75.html" title="The Time Machine">The Time Machine</a> which explored differences between the worker class and rich; other obvious earlier examples would be <a href="../../../a/_/c/A_Canticle_for_Leibowitz_8720.html" title="A Canticle for Leibowitz">A Canticle for Leibowitz</a> and Stranger in A Strange Land). However, the difference is that (A) I believe star trek was the first TV science fiction show to do it, and (B) star trek built a franchise around it -- the whole basis of the show - the federation, the klingons, the romulans -- were allegories to the world of the late 1960s. Further, they also explored racism, class issues, and a whole range of stuff not touched by other TV shows of hte day. <a href="../../../r/a/u/User%7ERaul654_54a3.html" title="User:Raul654">→Raul654</a> 23:14, July 15, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hey, I wanted to add to the article couple sentences about unique filming style of the Galactica. Something like <i>What makes Battlestar Galactica so unique is probably the style of filming. The constant shakiness of the camera, close-ups and uncommon shooting angles give the impression that it is more of a documentary than a sci-fi serie.</i> I was pretty impressed by the unique shakiness... i now call it "Shaky camera movie".&#160;:) Robert 19:26, 15 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, the style of filming is like someone is carrying a documentary camera on their person and filming.

<dd>The only thing about BSG's "unique filming" style I'm against is that it's NOT unique. For the shaky cam stuff watch "Law and Order" - they been doing it for years. Plus, their shakey cams and weird off-center framing is not even unique to a Sci-Fi show - Joss Whedon's "Firefly" series is filmed that way, and even the outer space scenes, you get the quick zoom ins and darted panning, and "Firefly" did that 2 years before the new BSG series. <a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberia23_c7e4.html" title="User:Cyberia23">Cyberia23</a> 20:10, 17 August 2005 (UTC)

When i was watching B5 and then Stargate i managed to formulate to myself that i love those shows because they are believable.. it is a science fiction and not a fairytale like Star Wars or Farscape. When Galactica arrived i was instantly in love with the show. Now i know why i like it so much.

<p>Let's look at all models revealed so far:</p>
<p>For humanoids:</p>
<ol>
<li>Number Six</li>
<li>Aaron Doral</li>
<li>Leoben Conoy</li>

<li>New raider</li>
<li>Original basestar</li>
<li>New basestar</li>
<li>Heavy raider</li>

<p>That adds up to 13 total. Clearly, the "12 new models" only applies to humanoids, especially since Ronald D.

<dd>No. First off, you're counting the ships as models, which there is no particular reason to do. While the ships are biological in design, they are not necessarily Cylons per se--they're not particularly intelligent, and Galactica-Boomer instinctively treats the captured Cylon Raider like a pet and not a person. Second off, you're counting *past* models as part of the 12, which also makes no sense--if I say "there are five BMW models" I'm clearly not counting every model BMW has ever manufactured since 1965. That narrows it down to six humanoids and the Cylon Centurion, which is seven models—leaving five more to be unveiled. (The two Cylons we know of remaining to be revaled in Season 2 are D'anna Biers, played by <a href="../../../l/u/c/Lucy_Lawless_32e1.html" title="Lucy Lawless">Lucy Lawless</a>, and Gina, played by <a href="../../../t/r/i/Tricia_Helfer_60b8.html" title="Tricia Helfer">Tricia Helfer</a> as a renegade Six.) Finally, Adama finds a note in the miniseries that says "there are only 12 Cylon models", which is clear and indisputable. — <b><a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilwelch_fd5e.html" title="User:Philwelch">Phil</a></b> <i><a href="../../../p/h/i/User_talk%7EPhilwelch_8d58.html" title="User talk:Philwelch">Welch</a></i> 01:34, 27 August 2005 (UTC)

<dd>It is obviously not clear enough if people are still confusing it. And I don't see what your BMW argument has to do with anything; this is BSG, not Earth, and Baltar (if that's actually who wrote it) was just going by what Six told him. And speaking of which, as I recall, a conversation between he and she in the mini went something like this:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Baltar: <i>The last time anyone saw the Cylons they looked more like walking chrome toasters.</i></li>
<li>Number Six: <i>Those <b>models</b> are still around.</i></li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Clearly, Six considers - at the least - the old Centurions to be 'models' of Cylons. And also, it makes no sense for her to be talking about Cylon models as a whole, rather than just humanoids. Baltar asked her if there were 'others like you;' he clearly meant humanoid versions, and Six knew that when she replied. Also, why would he feel the need to tell Adama if there are twelve different Cylons altoegther? He knew that Adama would only be interested in humanoid infiltrators; other types cna just be killed on sight. <a href="../../../k/u/r/User%7EKuralyov_a64e.html" title="User:Kuralyov">Kuralyov</a> 04:19, 27 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>All that Six confirms is that there are still models around that look like walking chrome toasters, not that they're identical to the one seen in the museum. She's obviously referring to the new Centurions, not the "original" ones. So, even if we assume that there are only twelve Cylon models, all that Six has done has said that one of those models is the Centurion.</p>
<p>People are still confusing the issue, perhaps, because the writers weren't as clear as they could have been, and because the exact wording of Adama's note (or its existence) isn't as distinctly remembered as the more vague dialogue. Secondly, it's a presumption that Baltar left Adama the note. It could have been Boomer (acting under Cylon programming during a blackout, like when she bombs the water tanks or kills Adama). It could have been yet another Cylon agent hiding in the fleet. The purpose of the note and who left it is still a mystery. "There are only 12 Cylon models" is cryptic and not all that helpful to Adama. Even if it's intended to help him, Adama has no reason *not* to count the Centurions as a Cylon model—if the purpose, as you suggest, is to tell Adama how many humanoid infiltrators there are, the note would speak of them specifically and not simply talk about Cylon models in general. "There are only 12 Cylon models" has a very clear, distinct, unambiguous meaning.</p>
<p>As for my BMW argument, it's about the English language, not Earth. If Six, or the note, had said "There have been a total of twelve Cylon models since the creation of the Cylons", then we would know for certain that it included the original Centurion. But they did *not* say that, they said "there are only twelve Cylon models", which is present tense, i.e. presumably not referring to 40 year old models that aren't in operation anymore. It's not impossible that it refers to old models, but we have no reason to conclude definitively and unambiguously that it does, especially in the face of more definite and clear evidence to the contrary. As for the ships—it's never been definitively stated that the ships themselves are Cylons, only that the Raiders appear to be autonomous biological units. There's room for ambiguity there. To me, it makes absolutely no sense to reject clear, unambiguous evidence written into the script by Ron Moore for a mishmash of ambiguity, 3-second references to the original series, and fanon. — <b><a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilwelch_fd5e.html" title="User:Philwelch">Phil</a></b> <i><a href="../../../p/h/i/User_talk%7EPhilwelch_8d58.html" title="User talk:Philwelch">Welch</a></i> 06:16, 27 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I think it's fair to say that there is ambiguity surrounding the "twelve models" statement. We reference it in the differences section, is there a need to state something so unsure at the top of the article?

<p>There's misunderstanding, perhaps.

<dd>I agree completely. Number Six obviously meant HUMANOID Cylons "Finally, Adama finds a note in the miniseries that says "there are only 12 Cylon models", which is clear and indisputable." ---------------&gt;FELGERCARB PHIL. Baltar obviously meant the humanoid models. *******They never use the term "humanoid Cylon" or "Humano-Cylon" or whatever. They call both mechanical and organic ones "Cylons" (or "Cylon Agents). This Phil guy is the only one purporting this edit here. I've already asked RDM's blog to specific and I hope one day we get an answer back. But Phil, seriously, if they reveal maybe 2 new Humanoid Cylons a year, if they counted Centurions etc that means there could only be 11 or less. Don't you think they'd like as many as possible, to keep the threat of sleeper agents going? ---Ricimer, 31 Aug, 2005</dd>
</dl>
<p>How do you know Baltar left the note? It could have been Boomer, or another sleeper agent. If the person who left the note meant the humanoid models, then why didn't the note say "there are only 12 humanoid Cylon models" or something to that effect? Why did the note reference Cylon models in general, which as you concede include the Centurion? Finally, counting the Centurions, there are still five Cylon models waiting to be revealed. You're the one who seems set on counting spacecraft as Cylon models, which is a bit of an presumption on your part. — <b><a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilwelch_fd5e.html" title="User:Philwelch">Phil</a></b> <i><a href="../../../p/h/i/User_talk%7EPhilwelch_8d58.html" title="User talk:Philwelch">Welch</a></i> 17:33, 31 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>We do at least know that the "new" cylon raiders are Cylons - when Starbuck "killed" one and then used it to get back to Galactica, I think it was made very clear that it was alive in a frighteningly similar way to the bioCylons like Six (all blood and guts and a few tubes and wires inside). Still, I did understand the "12 models" to be 12 bioCylons and not 12 total types including the classic chromedomes.</dd>

<p>Just want to point out two things. 1) The new Ford Mustang, while not anything like the old Mustang, is still a Mustang Model. So, the new Centurion design may be merely an upgraded or redisigned version of that model. 2) That information "12 models" is very subject to change. After all I can say there are 10 Ford models on the road. Then Ford can go and make 4 new models. And so can the Cylons make new models from the point that the information of 12 models comes into the audienced knowledge. 4.249.132.93 20:57, 8 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I wonder if it might be worth noting in a trivia item or elsewhere that, while most current TV series have gone out of their way to not have characters smoking, BSG has sort of gone the opposite direction. Of course we have Starbuck who smokes cigars, and we also know Adama does as well. And then we have the ship's doctor who smokes like a chimney. Maybe it's not worth mentioning, but these days it seems to unusual for a show to have smoking -- and in the case of Starbuck make it an endearing part of her character.

<dd>I agree but I also think that's the whole point. Does anyone LIKE the doctor? He's a jerk to everyone.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>With Starbuck, we all know how frakked-up she is, and this is another way. It's the problems in life and how we deal with them that are important. It's also one of the few attributes of the original Starbuck/Dirk Benedict that can be evenly applied to Katee Sackhoff.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Society, too, still seems to see cigar smoking as not very bad, as opposed to cigarette smoking, which is seen as unhealthy. We know both are bad for health, but society still can tend to see cigars as a very upscale, sophisticated thing to do.</dd>

<dd>I have no objections to that at all - and the scene where he lights up in front of Roslin (after discussing her cancer) was a very funny moment, in a gallows humor sort of way. It's just the fact that so many other TV series are going out of their way to pretend smoking doesn't exist that for a show like BSG to come along and feature it - it kinda calls attention to itself. Again, I don't know if it warrants a trivia item, unless anyone knows of any actual controversy surrounding this. Clearly BSG is not considered a kids' show (unlike the original series) nor is it marketed as one, so maybe there's no issue as a result. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 06:09, 1 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Question: With the shows trying to maintain a realistic tone in regards to science, isn't smoking a problem. It uses precious oxygen to burn and contaminates the recirulated air. Even if the air is scrubbed clean, the filtering agents would need replacing more frequently. I am surprised that the issue isn't addressed in regards to the nesasity to breathe and to the crew's health. 4.249.132.93 21:05, 8 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I am guessing that a Battlestar would have industrial-size filters- a few people smoking would probably not affect the whole crew of thousands of people. Anyway, if they used pure oxygen on the Galactica, smoking a cigarette would make the ship explode. They probably just recirculate the air over and over, making that a valid point. However, what if they dont need to replace the scrubbers, but clean them instead? I am anticipating an episode where the Cylons attack the scrubbers, I guarantee that will come sooner or later.--<a href="../../../z/x/c/User%7EZxcvbnm_9dac.html" title="User:Zxcvbnm">Zxcvbnm</a> 21:19, 8 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I wonder if a subsection listing examples of intentional similarities with 21st Century Earth might be interesting? Unlike the original series which strove to introduce "alien" concepts, there are a lot of familiar trappings on the new series, ranging from men wearing ties to graffiti in Caprica City to, as noted above, the use of cigarettes and cigars. The episode "Colonial Day" included a fairly obvious parody of not only Talk Radio (called Talk Wireless here) but also debate-oriented political shows such as Crossfire and the McLaughlin Group. There has even been a couple of examples of (possibly) unintentional references, such as the appearance of a <a href="../../../r/e/a/Readers_Digest_60ac.html" title="Readers Digest">Readers Digest</a> book in Adama's office or a visible Scotiabank logo on one of Caprica's buildings. It's been noted the article is becoming a bit long as it is, but do you think it might be worth starting a separate article to discuss these similarities? <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 14:46, 1 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I was watching the episode where the Cylons shut off main power for Galactica, and they had it drifting in space.

<dd>I found it really lame that when the BSG lost power and drifted - it was the only ship in the fleet floating at a weird angle too let the viewer know there was a problem. INERTIA??? Would it not continue on the same direction forever until it hit something? i.e. the way the ship was pointed when it lost power? About gravity... since the show is filmed on Earth, it's a little hard to simulate zero gravity on the stage sets. That too is cheesey, but I let that go due to budget contraints. With no gravity, you'd need probably more CGI and other effects than you could afford. Plus the bullets would bounce around the halls until they impacted something soft and fleshy. <a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberia23_c7e4.html" title="User:Cyberia23">Cyberia23</a> 18:53, 5 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I haven't actually seen the episode during which this occurs (although I did read the transcript&#160;:D) but I'm not sure that would explain it. Explosions contained fully in the ship (i.e., no hull breach) wouldn't do anything except wreck the insides a bit (the force of the explosion pushing the ship one way is fully countered by the force of the expanding gas hitting the other side of the room) while venting/uncontained explosions would cause the ship to go into a (very slow) spin, rather than just assume a weird angle. Also, while I at first thought (in the case of the Mark VIIs) that the change in orientation was caused by their inherent instability (as an example, modern aircraft, without constant computer corrections would essentially crash and burn), this instability is only a factor when an external force is being applied. Guess we'll chalk this up to a slip by the producers? After all, they do prove that they know about inertia during the space combat scenes.</dd>

<dd>Nothing can go perfectly straight. For example if, hypothetically, a gun was held completely still and then shot 5 times, the 5 bullets would end up in different locations. This has to do with two prominent things: vibration and imperfect weapon design. The Earth vibrates causing the gun to shift position (though this has no analogue really for BSG). In addition, the barrel of the gun is not perfectly straight, the bullet is not perfectly cylindrical, and, even if they were, the firing action does not propel the bullet on a perfect trajectory. In BSG's case, this amounts to an asymmetrical ship design (both very minute flaws in design as well as varying contents depending on where you are in the ship); this would cause the Galactica to tend to rotate around its center of mass (i.e. it no longer has the capacity to stabilize its trajectory). This is the very reason that satellites in orbit around our planet must have gyroscopes and corrective methods for maintaining prescribed orbits. We don't know, but it could've also had something to do with the thrusters cutting out at different times. Even slight course alterations can severely affect an object's trajectory, especially if it's going as fast as a spaceship. With no method of correcting such alterations, BSG's drift doesn't seem that unlikely after all.</dd>

<p>C'mon folks, this is an encyclopedia entry, not a fan site. Do we really need to know every single detail of what is different between the old and new shows?

Frankly, I think it would be madness to merge any of these articles, given the amount of information being presented. <i>Battlestar Galactica</i> could be compared with <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Trek_7a4f.html" title="Star Trek">Star Trek</a> in terms of scope, and <i>Trek</i> has hundreds of articles associated with it. -- <a href="../../../s/c/j/User%7EScjessey_ab91.html" title="User:Scjessey">Scjessey</a> 20:09, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I disagree. <i>BSG</i> is not <i>Star Trek</i>: it has not had ~ 800 episodes and 10 movies produced, nor has it had the wealth of merchandising attached to it. There is no need for the cruft in these now split articles about the new series. Why on earth has the story arc sections which I tried to keep lean now got virtually all the plotlines in them—written to conclusion, no less. Caprica, the as yet unproduced TV show, IMHO requires nothing more than a single page attached to the BSG category. It would be madness to spread the BSG articles thinner still, and then attempt to pad them out with conjecture, trivia and fancruft. —<a href="../../../n/e/u/User%7ENeuropedia_a641.html" title="User:Neuropedia">Neuropedia</a> 19:57, 1 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well so far it is just a single page in the BSG category. Anyway, I agree that BSG is nowhere near the scope of star trek, but I'm not too fussed about the episode outlines, though some are a little less concise than I'd like (i started concisioning them, for lack of a better word, but got bored). I'm happy with those. What concerns me is the articles governing (what i consider to be) non-notable things, like the <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tomb_of_Athena_504d.html" title="Tomb of Athena">Tomb of Athena</a> and so forth. And I think an awful lot of articles simply repeat information. The article on the ship pegasus, as well as the article on her commander (if there is one, i forget... they might be same actually) repeats information that's detailed in the episodes. <a href="../../../r/u/n/User%7ERun%21_9192.html" title="User:Run!"><font size="-2" color="white" style="background:red">&#160;<b>-- Run!</b>&#160;</font></a> 07:46, 2 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I agree that there is too much cruft, but I still don't think that there should be any kind of merger with the main articles. The thing is, <i>Battlestar Galactica</i> is more mainstream than regular science fiction shows like <i>Star Trek</i>. It should certainly get no less attention than any of the other popular television shows of the day. Absolute <i>garbage</i>, like <a href="../../../a/m/e/Category%7EAmerican_Idol_2f0d.html" title="Category:American Idol">American Idol</a>, for example, gets an entire category chock full of articles (and even a bunch of subcategories). -- <a href="../../../s/c/j/User%7EScjessey_ab91.html" title="User:Scjessey">Scjessey</a> 11:11, 2 May 2006 (UTC)

<p>I have made the DVD release a subcategory of the Episode list, but it seems more appropriate to move the DVD section to be a "part 2" of the main article. Then the "Episode List" can be changed to "Episodes" with an intro as to how many shows have been produced and what's available on DVD, yadda yadda, followed by a link to the existing main article with the list.

<p>I support Lucius1976's addition of Canada to the country of origin. Not only is it filmed in Canada - Vancouver standing in for Caprica - but a number of cast members are Canadian as well. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 00:00, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm not sure that saying the country of origin is Canada is entirely accurate. Normally, it is a matter of <i>money</i>. The mini-series was co-funded by NBC Universal and Sky, and the television series is entirely funded by NBC Universal. Shooting in Canada does not make a show Canadian. Would you say that <i>Revenge of the Sith</i> or <i>The Matrix</i> were Australian, because they were shot in Australia? Interestingly, the IMDb refers to the mini-series as being from the USA, and the <i>television series</i> as being USA/UK. I'm not sure that is right either. It'll upset Canadian fans, but I think the country of origin should say <b>USA</b> -- <a href="../../../s/c/j/User%7EScjessey_ab91.html" title="User:Scjessey">Scjessey</a> 12:13, 30 January 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Actually, I have seen ROTS and Matrix referred to as Australian co-productions. Farscape is considered an Australian co-production, while Xena and Hercules: the Legendary Journeys are considered New Zealand co-productions. And X-Files was considered a Canadian co-production. That's because all these shows made significant use of local assets. If BSG was made using completely American assets (as many films and TV shows are) then there would be no co-production necessary. But if a large number of crew and cast are Canadian, then yes it should be listed as a Canada co-production. There's a difference then, say, <i><a href="../../../c/a/s/Casino_Royale_%282006_film%29_af91.html" title="Casino Royale (2006 film)">Casino Royale</a></i> which cannot be called a Eastern European co-production because, while it's filming there, all significant cast and crew are still British. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 13:34, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You make some interesting points, but I still think that classification depends on who pays the bills.

It may <i>feel</i> right to have Canada as one of the countries of origin, but I think it breaks standard Wikipedia convention (which appears to follow the money).

Well, actually I don't think it only the funds matter. Many funds of movies in the past came from Germany (stupid German money). So just giving money does make it a production of a country. It more matters where it is produced, not just some shots, but where the bulk of it is produced, edited etc. Therefor it's fair to include Canada. --<a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELucius1976_ad53.html" title="User:Lucius1976">Lucius1976</a> 08:08, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Country of origin</b> means, quite literally, the <i>originating</i> country. The program is funded and produced (different from shot) in the United States. Furthermore, the rights to the series are owned by a US company. Even if the series was entirely shot in Canada, starring <i>only</i> Canadians, it would <i><b>still</b></i> be a US production, and the USA would be the country of origin. In almost all cases, it is the <i>money</i> that counts, even if that doesn't seem fair.

<dd>Actually, it isn't really the money. Because many Hollywood movies are funded by money from outside of the US. Just check out where funding of most production came from.

<p>This is getting absurd. We can't have this article being renamed back and forth without discussion, as seems to have happened recently. Right now, the Battlestar Galactica name, as it pertains to visual media, encompasses <i>at least</i> the following, to my knowledge:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Original Universe
<ul>
<li>A 1978 film</li>
<li>The subsequent 1978 TV series</li>
<li>A short-lived 1980 sequel series</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Re-imagined Universe
<ul>
<li>A 2003 miniseries</li>
<li>The subsequent 2004 TV series</li>
<li>A series of "webisodes" (which may be considered part of the 2004 series)</li>
<li>A proposed prequel series</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This article is about the re-imagined universe, not any of the specific TV series. Therefore, in my opinion, naming it by the year in which it was re-imagined is entirely inappropriate. Article name disambiguation should be done based on the disambiguating factor. In this case, it's the fact that this article describes the <b>re-imagined universe</b> that differentiates it from the other "Battlestar Galactica" articles, and therefore, the name "Battlestar Galactica (re-imagining)" seems to be the most appropriate, if a little unwieldy (accuracy is much more important than brevity in article names). A logical name needs to be agreed on and stuck with.<br />

<dd>While I agree "re-imagining" is a somewhat silly word, it has become the standard term when discussing the series, so with that in mind, I prefer it to "updated". I'm more strongly against using the year, I guess, as that introduces <i>much</i> more confusion with the miniseries, which is what really needs to be avoided here. IMDb, for example, uses "2003" when referring to the miniseries. Tying the year, which is normally associated with a particular production, to the re-imagined universe as a whole, seems to me to be a bad idea. -- <a href="../../../f/r/u/User%7EFru1tbat_fa7f.html" title="User:Fru1tbat">Fru1tbat</a> 13:59, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>ron moore said in a season one dvd extra feature that he came up with the idea to film BSG like a documentary. well, firefly actually came out before BSG and was shot the same way, so shouldnt a mention of it be in the article, stating that he didnt actually come up with it?-<a href="../../../x/o/r/User%7EXornok_b13e.html" title="User:Xornok">Xornok</a> 13:14, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I don't think it's really necessary, especially if he wasn't influenced by Firefly. It's not necessarily accurate to say Moore didn't come up with it, since it's possible he conceived the idea independently, maybe before Firefly even aired (assuming he has seen Firefly in the first place). If the article were stating that Moore pioneered the style, it might be relevant to point out that other series used it first, but as it's written, it's only stating that he <i>used</i> the style. I think it's probably best left alone. -- <a href="../../../f/r/u/User%7EFru1tbat_fa7f.html" title="User:Fru1tbat">Fru1tbat</a> 13:43, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'd really like to see a section for popular criticisms of the show. Such points as:</p>
<ul>
<li>The acceptance of the word <i>frack</i> into series vocabulary, but eschewing of <i>centon</i> and <i>yaren.</i></li>
<li>Use of the term "download" to refer to a cylon consciousness transferring out of a dead body. "Upload" is the proper term for this direction of transfer.</li>
<li>What is almost "Twin Peaks" Syndrome - so much effort is made to keep the story obfuscated that it can be difficult to figure out what the themes and story actually are.</li>
</ul>
<p>Anybody have any good reasons why I shouldn't add these to the main article? It would be interesting to see what people decide to add to it. <a href="../../../t/r/a/User%7ETransentient_702c.html" title="User:Transentient">Transentient</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>I have good reasons why not. First of all, <i>centon</i>, <i>yaren</i> and the like would add nothing to the show. <i>Frak</i> is a great way of giving the show a harder feel without pissing off the censors. Secondly, why is <i>upload</i> a more proper term than <i>download</i>? Essentially, the consciousness is being "passed along" to the next generation. Any discussion of "direction" is a bit meaningless. We don't know if the memories are being "sent" or "received". Thirdly, what exactly do you find confusing? I can follow the story, themes and concepts with no difficulty at all. Finally, the Wikipedia is supposed to be an encyclopedia of sorts. Any criticism falls into the realm of <i>point of view</i>, which doesn't have a place here. -- <a href="../../../s/c/j/User%7EScjessey_ab91.html" title="User:Scjessey">Scjessey</a> 17:49, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for your suggestions Transentient, but I also think things like that are better left out. None of your 3 points have any strong informational value. They'd be perfect for a fansite but not so much in an encyclopedia. --<a href="../../../p/a/x/User%7EPax%7EVobiscum_3a44.html" title="User:Pax:Vobiscum">Pax:Vobiscum</a> 17:55, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I would object to it, personally. I haven't heard those criticisms mentioned much, anyway. I'm not sure that things like nitpicks, minor production goofs, and minor continuity errors are encyclopedic. The parts that are opinion certainly aren't, unless the backlash concerning those opinions has a noticeable effect on the show as a whole. The minor technical stuff, on the other hand, aren't really notable. If they were, the various Star Trek articles would be about 100 pages long... Specifically:
<ul>
<li>The use of the word "frak" but not others is an intentional creative decision. Isn't this already mentioned in the context of the language of the show? Maybe it's in a different article. I don't think anything else is really necessary.</li>
<li>The term "download" isn't necessarily a goof at all, but more a matter of interpretation. It may occasionally be used incorrectly as a general term, but specifically, in the episode "Downloaded", the consciousnesses seem to be downloaded from a central repository of some sort into the new bodies, which is a correct use of the term. If it's used incorrectly sometimes, it's not important enough to make note of.</li>
<li>The part of the story that's the most hidden is the Cylons' master plan. Development on everything else has been moving along fairly steadily, and I don't think the show's themes are significantly obfuscates. This seems to me to be a subject for a debate, not an encyclopedia article.</li>

<dd>While I agree that the fannish criticisms Transentient mentions are probably non-notable and wouldn't be able to be supported by <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>, the article probably could have a more thorough treatment of the reaction to the series in the media. I came to the article to add a mention of the recent <i><a href="../../../s/l/a/Slate_%28magazine%29.html" title="Slate (magazine)">Slate</a></i> article <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2151425/?nav=navoa" class="external text" title="http://www.slate.com/id/2151425/?nav=navoa" rel="nofollow">Battlestar: Iraqtica</a> — it's not exactly a criticism, but it does analyze way the series has recently changed its central metaphor from post-9/11 America to occupied Iraq. One of the most notable elements of the new <i>BSG</i> is the way that it deals unflinchingly with complex moral issues. This has been noted in reliable sources, and it would be appropriate for the article to relect it with relevant citations. —<a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJosiah_Rowe_4f72.html" title="User:Josiah Rowe">Josiah Rowe</a> <small>(<a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJosiah_Rowe_ba00.html" title="User talk:Josiah Rowe">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Josiah_Rowe_5f31.html" title="Special:Contributions/Josiah Rowe">contribs</a>)</small> 16:50, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The <i>Slate</i> article is still POV, and therefore does not seem to be relevant to this medium. Furthermore, there is no way I would see BSG's willingness to echo current affairs as any form of criticism. Any section that is headed <b>Criticism</b> is almost certainly going to be a repository of opinion. -- <a href="../../../s/c/j/User%7EScjessey_ab91.html" title="User:Scjessey">Scjessey</a> 17:13, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Perhaps I wasn't clear: what I was suggesting was a section summarizing the reactions to BSG's socio-political content in non-fan-based media. I didn't mean "criticism" in the sense of "this is something that's wrong with the program", but "criticism" in the sense of "thoughtful, mainstream discussion triggered by the program." If such a section were created, <i>reporting</i> the mainstream critical reaction — both positive and negative — it would be in keeping with the NPOV policy. —<a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJosiah_Rowe_4f72.html" title="User:Josiah Rowe">Josiah Rowe</a> <small>(<a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJosiah_Rowe_ba00.html" title="User talk:Josiah Rowe">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Josiah_Rowe_5f31.html" title="Special:Contributions/Josiah Rowe">contribs</a>)</small> 19:07, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That's sounds like a good idea. I'd prefer if it was integrated into the text and not had its own "criticism" section, since that easily evolves into a list of random inconsistencies and criticism from single editors. --<a href="../../../p/a/x/User%7EPax%7EVobiscum_3a44.html" title="User:Pax:Vobiscum">Pax:Vobiscum</a> 19:52, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm requesting that someone who is familiar with the new series of Battlestar Galactica rewrites this page. As stated in the description at the top of this article, the content is meant to be about the universe of the reimagined series of Battlestar Galactica. As someone who has never watched Battlestar Galactica, I can say unequivocally that this article explains nothing to me. It is overly concerned with production data, and poorly written/organised.
