<p>Yeah, I'd like to see this too. The numbers cited seem to be taken from the worst possible Axis perspective and the best possible Russian perspective. When I first read this article some years ago, the Russians had more than twice the casualties that the Axis had. Now it's reversed, and the Axis actually have more casualties listed than the Russians. This has no basis in history, and reeks of bias. Anti-German sentiments should not have that much of an impact on a supposedly neutral article.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I don't like this post. Your thread is messed up because you have made a big deal over something small. Look, the numbers of casualties ranges based on whoever estimates it, because different people have different opinions. There is no reason to say that this article is biased or use the phrase "supposedly neutral" just because you feel like insulting somebody else's work. Whoever wrote this article found a reliable source online, who got their numbers from either another website, or an actual casualty esmtimator (whoever may be held accountable for this job). A few numbers are wrong, maybe, but that doesn't meant the whole article is biased nor does it mean the author is biased. The history was written by the victor, Russia, so they are naturally to seem the better force. I feel insulted as a person that other people actually troll the internet looking for minute things that are incorrect so you can assault the person who put it there. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_68.100.53.115_d0a9.html" title="Special:Contributions/68.100.53.115">68.100.53.115</a> (<a href="../../../6/8/2E/User_talk%7E68.100.53.115.html" title="User talk:68.100.53.115">talk</a>) 23:21, 20 February 2007 (UTC).</small></dd>

<p>I'm just going to waltz on in and say if anything from Stalingrad, by Anthony Beevor, is even half correct. Wikipedia is more then half wrong. NKVD killed thousands of soldiers at Stalingrad, for treasonous activities against the state and othersuch generic accusations. Even more thousands deserted to join the Germans. To even try and pretend that all Russians were 110% devoted to the Motherland is outright laughable. Also, to pretend that the Germans, were their highly mechanized and trained Wermacht, had more casualties inflicted on a army that often sent soldiers to fight without weapons or for the sole task of being a suicide bomber, is once again, charmingly miscorrect. Just throwing it out there, breathing a bit of fresh air into Wiki, no matter how miscorrect that fresh air is.</p>

<p>The article should address these points to keep its GA status&#160;:</p>
<ul>
<li>It would be nice to have subsections for the different sections since it is getting too crowded to be easily browsable.</li>
<li>I would like to also see a section that addresses the future of the battle, aftermath or strategies that came out of the battle.</li>
<li>How was the battle seen by the public? Were the civilians killed mentioned outside the war?</li>
<li>There aren't enough references because some of the mentions in the text are close to POV... especially in this section <b>Operation Blau</b>.</li>
<li>The <b>dramatization</b> titled section is POV. It should be changed or maybe it should address why they dramatize such event.</li>
<li>The article is clearly missing lots of citations/references. Such a subject should be betterl referenced.</li>

<p>Hello<br />
My comment is not related to the content of the topic, rather to the structure of one particular sentence that I found somewhat ambiguous.<br />
<br />
In the fifth paragraph under the section titled, <b><i>The Soviet counter-offensive: Operation Uranus</i></b><br />
I found one sentece that I needed to reread for clarity. After rereading the sentence I have an idea for how to make it more easily understood at first glance.<br />
<br />
Here is the sentence:<br /></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This would allow the Germans in the city to fight on while a relief force could be assembled, a plan that had been used successfully a year earlier at the Demyansk Pocket on a much smaller scale (an army corps versus an entire army)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br />
I found the parenthetical aside a bit confusing on first read.<br />
I would like to propose, what I feel is, a more easily read, though longer, alternative.<br />
My words:<br />
<i>(it had been only an army corps at Demyansk as opposed to an entire army)</i><br />
<br />
How do contributors who have been working on this page for some time already feel about this slight change of wording?<br />
<br />

<p>I have delisted Battle of Stalingrad as a <a href="../../../g/a/_/WP%7EGA_8191.html" title="WP:GA">good article</a>. This is because of the problems raised above.

<p>In the 8th paragraph in the "In the City" section is: "With no end in sight, the Germans started transferring heavy artillery to the city, including a gigantic 800 mm mortar." The Dora was 800 mm caliber, but was not a mortar. You sure can't muzzle load this gun. Click the link for a picture. Joeylawn 05:41, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm not commenting directly on Dora, but if you're saying that a mortar is defined partly by muzzle-loading, that is not technically correct. Most mortars are muzzleloaders, but despite what it says in wikipedia's own mortar article, breechloading mortars exist.

<p>The integral problem with all forms of heavy weapons is recoil and how to absorb it. A mortar relies on the shock waves being absorbed by the earth. Artillery relies on springs and hyrdaulics. Dora was artillery.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>We're all agreeing Dora was not a mortar. However, the type of recoil system (base plate or some form of mechanical dampening system) is not part of the definition of a mortar. The Soviet 160mm, for example, had a recoil system. Your proposed definition would also be hard-pressed to deal with the numerous vehicle-mounted mortars.

<p>The tone of much of this article gushes like something I would expect to read in Sport Illustrated. We would like the facts without the constant reference to comparative and superlative aspects of how this was the "greatest" struggle ever. I do not mean to bleed the article of its spirit, but what is important is getting the facts straight. -- 71.141.244.13 23:18, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I agree. The gushing prose about "discipline and determination" reads like propaganda sometimes. I think the article needs to note that one of the reasons soldiers didn't retreat and fought on in terrible conditions is that both sides were commanded by totalitarian leaders who would not permit retreat. On both sides soldiers were brutally punished and sometimes killed (or put back into suicidal combat positions) for retreating even when it was the sensible military option. --mgaved 11:06, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I agree in some respects to what the two users above have said. The article needs a cleanup, but I was unprepared to pepper the entire article with fact and other tags.

<dd>I wouldn't be too hasty about making substantial changes. This article has been worked on for a long time by many editors, and there are substantial disagreement between different sources which the current article reflects. It may be worthwhile to go through the discussions about sources in the talk page before making changes. Also note that one of the two critics you mention (IP 71.141.244.13) is quite uninformed about the battle. He or she is the one who wrote that victory at Moscow ensured victory at Stanlingrad (sic).

<dd>On review of the talk archives, there seems to have been little reliance on RS. I did take out of it that the article should be non contradicting (ie listing casualties exceeding troop strength). If the consensus is that it's that troublesome, a range, with sources cited, should be included. Really no reason to have a big fight. Cantankrus 22:32, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You cannot easily separate the Soviet victories of Stanlingrad and Moscow because the victory at Moscow freed up troops to assist in the relief of Stanlingrad. Let's avoid all this talk about Stalingrad being the turning point of the WW II or we will get into a pointless contest about Stanlingrad vs. Moscow as the "greatest" battle. The fact is that two mechanized national armies, Nazi and Soviet where in a total-warfare struggle with each other. Once Moscow was secured, the entire Soviet national army was directed at rolling/grinding on to Stanlingrad and beyond. -- 71.141.244.13 23:25, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Firstly, the Battle of Moscow occurred a year before Stalingrad (not Stanlingrad). Between Moscow and Stalingrad there were other important important battles like the 2nd Battle of Kharkov that resulted in massive Soviet casualties (over 200,000 by some estimates). So to say that success at Moscow led inevitably to success at Stalingrad is an error. It is true though that Moscow was the first time that the German Army was forced into a major retreat. Secondly, "entire Soviet national army was directed at rolling/grinding on to Stanlingrad" is factually wrong. The Soviets had a greater number of troops on the North and Central fronts combined than at the South front (Stalingrad). <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayanta_Sen_1e6a.html" title="User:Jayanta Sen">JS</a> 02:40, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Also given that the Battle for Moscow was mostly over by the end of 1941, and the German attack on Stalingrad did not begin till August 1942 the following makes no sense "Once Moscow was secured, the entire Soviet national army was directed at rolling/grinding on to Stanlingrad and beyond." <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayanta_Sen_1e6a.html" title="User:Jayanta Sen">JS</a> 03:24, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>While its true that one battle has an influence on the other, it doesn't mean we can't critically assess and evaluate what the significance of each individual battle means.</dd>
<dd>The German army wasn't forced to fight at Stalingrad -- it chose to. The decisions made by the different sides had an impact, and the war could have turned out different if other decisions had been made. During the battle is where the strategic initiative passed from the German forces to the Soviet forces. By this measure, it was the "turning point" of the war in the East.</dd>
<dd>Before an edit by me, the battle was listed as the costliest battle in terms of lives. The sources I consulted seemed to have various estimates, but it was clear that it was close to the top. This article is on my TODO list, but I haven't been able to make it to the library to check up on my FACT tags. I'll address the tone and bulk up the refs at the same time.

<dd>JS - I have access to a number of good libraries, and the library loan system in my area is excellent. What I'm looking for is good reliable sources for battle casualties, for statements on different phases of the battle, etc. I don't expect to have everything done in one run, but I haven't been to the library since I started my FACT tagging.</dd>
<dd>As far as other battles go, many eastern battles are not really described fully in general WW2 books. There tends to be a focus on Western campaigns, as that is where general reader focus is. If you have any info, please either add it to the article, or here on the talk page. Cantankrus 04:51, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hello C, I think when it comes to casualties, most sources are biased one way or the other, and it is hard to say which is unbiased. In such a situation the best we can do is probably to mention the various sources. What usually is beyond dispute is which army advanced, and which retreated at what dates. You are right about most sources focusing on the Western campaigns. If you want an alternative view, you could try Alexander Werth's "Russia at War". I cannot vouch for its accuracy, but it certainly is a different take. Regards, <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayanta_Sen_1e6a.html" title="User:Jayanta Sen">JS</a> 07:20, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>IMHO this section should be reworked to reflect what was seen as important <u>prior</u> the battle, not the numerous speculations and myths generated <u>afterwards</u>. At least these two should not be mixed together.</p>
<p>There was no shortage of cities named after Stalin in Soviet Union: <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stalino.html" title="Stalino">Stalino</a> (<a href="../../../d/o/n/Donetsk.html" title="Donetsk">Donetsk</a>) was larger (500,000 inhabitants) city and the centre of <a href="../../../d/o/n/Donbass.html" title="Donbass">important industrial area</a>, captured by Italian troops. <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stalinogorsk.html" title="Stalinogorsk">Stalinogorsk</a> (<a href="../../../n/o/v/Novomoskovsk%2C_Russia_45b9.html" title="Novomoskovsk, Russia">Novomoskovsk, Russia</a>) was somewhat smaller city which was captured as well.

<dd>The main danger to the Germans as they pushed west in the southern part of the front was that they were creating a long flank to the north-east of their forces. They did not have enough troops to defend this flank and used allies like the Romanians and Italians. This is what proved to be their undoing at Stalingrad when the Soviets attacked the German allies on this flank (Uranus and Saturn). The claim that the Germans would have benefited if they had pushed even deeper south-west while ignoring Soviet strong points like Stalingrad is rather dubious. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayanta_Sen_1e6a.html" title="User:Jayanta Sen">JS</a> 19:46, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That's true, but it is also true that the long open flank to the north-west (not east, if you mean with reference to the tip of the spear) was irrelevant unless the Soviets massed suffcient force and mounted an major offensive there. The long open southern flank of US forces in France beginning at the end of July 1944, for example, was strategically risky only if the Germans had the forces to do something about it.</dd>
<dd>I mention this because this is another one of those situations in which the 'error' is obvious in hindsight *because* we know the outcome. At the time, even though there were plenty of objections from German officers, there was also a conclusion that the risk was worth it - the Red Army seemed to be melting away. <a href="../../../d/m/o/User%7EDMorpheus_f8a6.html" title="User:DMorpheus">DMorpheus</a> 21:04, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I meant "north-east" as in the front stretching from north-west to south-east, with the Germans on the south-west side of it. You are right about the amount of remaining strength and reserves being the critical issue. There is much evidence that the Germans consistently underestimated that, beginning of course with Hitler's prediction at the start of Barbarossa that it would last only six weeks.

<p>I watched the evolution of this article for more than 2 years now, and I must say that it clearly shows Wikipedia's most fatal flaw. The article has gone through so many revisions; it makes me sick to my stomach. The POV, ideology, tone, facts, etc in this article changed sides more than on Mamayev Kurgan. People spend more time arguing sides (primarily the subject of “the” vs “a” turning point), than looking for concrete evidence and citations. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_72.0.199.131_d3bb.html" title="Special:Contributions/72.0.199.131">72.0.199.131</a> (talk) 21:27, 28 January 2007 (UTC).</small></p>
<p>I think the evolution of the article simply reflects the disagreements that exist about history. I would say that it is rather evidence of Wikipedia's "bright" rather than "dark" side.

<p>THIS Is the third time i wrote the same headline. There is a serious problem here and editors dont want to solve it. Is irritaing, i will tell you why. Is not about the number of casualties higher than the troops deployed. I now germany sent many reinforcements to the battle. THE PROBREM HERE IS THE NUMBER OF RUSSIAN CASUALTIES; NOT GERMAN ONES. Whermacht and axis satellites loosses are ok, and well documented, but russian casualties are 60% higher than the showed here.</p>

<dd>According to Krivosheev, Soviet casualties in the Stalingrad battle (defensive operation+offensive operation) were 478 741 irrecoverable losses (KIA, MIA, dead of other causes, captured) and 650 878 sanitary losses (wounded/sick). Those losses occured from July 17th, 1942 to Februrary 2nd, 1943.

<p>Please state sources which say that Slovakian units took part in the battles in and around Stalingrand. As far as I know, Slovakian troops were fighting in Caucasus, not Stalingrad. Croatian units on the other hand did take part in the battle, if I recall correctly. Then again, I might be wrong.</p>
<p>Conserning the information I added regarding Axis troops who chose not to surrender, this information comes from the German documentary that came with the special edition of movie "Stalingrad" and was confirmed by Soviet documents and veterans.

<p>"Hello Kurt, Could you please provide more details about the movie "Stalingrad"? Which year was it made, who was the director etc.?" Stalingrad is 1993 German movie. See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stalingrad_%281993_movie%29" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stalingrad_%281993_movie%29" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stalingrad_%281993_movie%29</a> for details. "Did the movie explicitly mention the number 10,000?" It is not the movie where I got the information from, but from German documentary that came with the movie's special DVD-edition. The documentary is named "Stalingead" and is in three parts called "The Attack", "The War", and "The Fall". In total the documentary lasts for hours. It is in the last part in which Soviet veterans who are interviewed mention German/Axis troops who did not surrender, and that they kept getting casualties for two weeks after the surrender. This is confirmed by official Soviet documents that give the figure of 10000.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Your reply is confusing. It appears that you are now saying that the 10,000 figure did not come from the movie but from "official Soviet documents". Can you specify what these documents are? 10,000 is quite a large number and this would be significant. Anthony Beevor does not mention such holdouts in his book, although I do not claim his book is exhaustive.

<p>"There is no sources no nothing just his own poersonal point of view," I have given you sources but you are ignoring them and refusing to discuss this properly. This has nothing to do with my "poersonal point of view". On the other hand, it is issue of Croatia and Slovakia we should discuss too. I have not seen any sources given about Slovakia's role in the Battle of Stalingrad. Then again, I have not given any about Croatia, which I why I ask for serious discussion about the issue.

I could not find any evidence (sources) that some Germans (moreso 10000 of them) kept fighting after that date. There is a possibility that some (very few) Germans went into hiding and either died from starvation or surrendered later. Unless the sources are provided by Kurt, I will revert him.

<p>Kurt and Potaaatos, both of you should relax. The issue isn't difficult. If Kurt can provide sources for the 10,000 number we can keep the information.

<p>"It appears that you are now saying that the 10,000 figure did not come from the movie but from " As far as I know I never said that the information came from the movie, but from the documentary that came with it.</p>
<p>Unless someone can prove that the documentary is flawed then we have a problem. The documentary's name is Stalingrad and it is German, but obviously made with Russian assistance, since several Soviet veterans and civilians are interviewed (+German veterans and civilians, and even Romanian veteran). It is clearly a relatively new documentary. Besides Soviet veterans confirming that a large number of enemies refused to surrender, you can see Soviet documents that give the figure.</p>
<p>I am now watching that certain part of the documentary. A Soviet veteran named Fjodor Iltschenko says: "On 13th of February we were in movies. They were showing us a film outside. Suddenly we were being fired at from somewhere. When the men of my company started to fall back, the Germans kept firing at them. They had been hiding in a cellar of destroyed house. They, of course, were killed right after this." According to the documents showed, 2418 of the men were killed, and 8646 were captured. --<a href="../../../k/u/r/User%7EKurt_Leyman_1ee7.html" title="User:Kurt Leyman">Kurt Leyman</a> 20:48, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>P.S. I would like to correct my mistake. It was early March, not April, and the figure was over 10000, 11064 (I just watched the part of the documentary with the documents again (the last time I saw it was several months ago, which caused me to make the mistakes. Again, I apologise), and that is the number that is given) according to Soviet intelligence documents.</p>

<dd>I think I see the cause of misunderstanding. Surrender of an Army could not just happen overnight. Rounding up 100k+ Germans probably took weeks after the German capitulation, it was a logistic nighmare, worse than the evacuation of New Orleans after Katrina. During this period of cleanup Soviet Army understandably took some casualties in sporadic fights and this was probably reported in the documentary.

<p>I think that the point needs to be made that although the Luftwaffe was capable of flying in 300 tonnes of food per day, this was the maximum. It was usually closer to around 90 - 100 tonnes of food per day, which is, when you think about it, a significant difference from 300 tonnes. In addition, there were some points where they were unable to fly food in at all, due in part to both the weather and Soviet airforce activity.</p>

<p>Did Paulus in fact "surrender" at Stalingrad? The acclaimed 1999 book, "Stalingrad" by Antony Beevor disputes this. Paulus, when his headquarters was captured by the Soviets, said that he did not surrender, and that, in fact he had been "taken by surprise." He then rebuffed his Soviet captors' request that he order his troops to surrender. Hitler's resulting anger was not over Paulus's "surrender," but rather over the fact that Paulus had allowed himself to be captured alive, instead of shooting himself.</p>

<p>While it may be true that Paulus did not in fact "surrender" it is known as a fact that about 90,000 German prisoners were taken at the end of the battle. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/l/i/User%7EClimie.ca_09e1.html" title="User:Climie.ca">Climie.ca</a> (<a href="../../../c/l/i/User_talk%7EClimie.ca_0f2a.html" title="User talk:Climie.ca">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Climie.ca_e007.html" title="Special:Contributions/Climie.ca">contribs</a>) 19:33, 17 March 2007 (UTC).</small></p>
