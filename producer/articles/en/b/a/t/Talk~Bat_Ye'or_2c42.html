<dd>Because he is saying that she is the favorite on Right wing web-sites, which is unsubstantiated and misleading and an unwarranted characterization since her writings make no mention of right wing political ideas .

<dd>Well many different types of websites use her articles and Jason Burke's comment is a general statement which omits to specify which web sites and why are they characterized as right wing and how does he determine that she is a favorite. Its just not good encyclopedic material.

<p>Bat Ye'or is a researcher. It is NPOV and I think Bat Ye'or does consider herself as a researcher. But saying she is a historian is not NPOV. John Esposito criticized Bat Ye'or for lacking academic credentials. Esther Benbassa stated that Bat Ye'or is not a professional historian. --<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminz_b269.html" title="User:Aminz">Aminz</a> 11:29, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have provided a credible citation that states that she is a historian. Like it or not, what you state is your own opinion, and your repeated attempt at removing the title of historian is making it look like you are only trying to discredit her for personal reasons. If you read any of her books , you will see that she is a historian , and she meets the highest academic standards in her writings as everything is cited with volumes of primary sources.--<a href="../../../c/l/t/User%7ECltFn_aba7.html" title="User:CltFn">CltFn</a> 18:15, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>She is not a historian because she has no academic qualifications in history, has never taught history in an institution of higher learning, indeed, has never held an academic post. I accept that she does provide voluminous references for points, but so do many other writers whose work is classified in Wikipedia as "pseudohistory". <a href="../../../i/t/s/User%7EItsmejudith_5347.html" title="User:Itsmejudith">Itsmejudith</a> 18:21, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The people you cited seem all to be from circa 1000 CE. If we are to apply today's standards to that time, probably every notable politician and military leader would be a war criminal. In the context of circa 1000 CE, these people were historians, much as their contemporaries who knew nothing formal about empirical methods or experimental design were scientists simply because they tried interesting things and recorded their results.</dd>

<dd>If her work was accepted by most historians as being a valid contribution to the discipline then perhaps the word "historian" would apply, although even then "amateur historian" would probably be more applicable. But it isn't, so she shouldn't have the description. The four examples you gave above are all from the Middle Ages, mostly from the early Middle Ages. Those authors were in fact engaged in scholarship of the highest order. They were members of large scholarly communities, studied in the best schools that existed in their times, or with the best authorities, and their work remained valid for centuries afterwards. To say they had no academic credentials is either deliberate anachronism or just plain wrong. <a href="../../../i/t/s/User%7EItsmejudith_5347.html" title="User:Itsmejudith">Itsmejudith</a> 21:35, 15 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well so has Bat Ye'or , she studied at the Institute of Archeology (University of London) and University of Geneva . She has 8 published books , and is considered a major authority in the history of the dhimmi and dhimmitudte. I do not know about you but when I read her books ,there is absolutely no doubt that she is her work reflects "scholarship of the highest order". <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Spencer_4b9f.html" title="Robert Spencer">Robert Spencer</a> described Bat Ye’or on <a href="../../../c/-/s/C-SPAN_811a.html" title="C-SPAN">C-SPAN</a> as&#160;:

<dd><i>Bat Ye’or is the pioneering scholar of dhimmitude, of the institutionalized discrimination and harassment of non-Muslims under Islamic law. She is the first person to study this as her field and to make it into a field of academic study. Her books are highly recommended and are full – most of them are almost half primary source documents so that one can see the veracity of what she is saying from very ancient texts. And so this is something that she has opened up that the Middle East studies establishment was afraid or indifferent or unwilling to look at. And she has opened up this study which is a very important field of study particularly in light of the ongoing Islamization (ph) of the societies of Europe nowadays.</i> <a href="http://www.q-and-a.org/Transcript/?ProgramID=1086" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.q-and-a.org/Transcript/?ProgramID=1086" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> --<a href="../../../c/l/t/User%7ECltFn_aba7.html" title="User:CltFn">CltFn</a> 21:49, 15 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Nothing inherently wrong with being an islamophobe, its all a matter of point of view. Many authors are routinely accused of islamophobia by people who object to their writings and who themselves might be labelled "apologists" and "revisionists". I personally have a far higher respect for writers who have the intellectual courage to continue to write about what they have observed regardless of attempted <a href="../../../c/e/n/Censorship.html" title="Censorship">censorship</a>.

<dd>Simple question: is Noam Chomsky a historian? He is a professor, and he writes foot-noted chronologies of historical events, and a lot of (non-historians) cite his historical work. I don't think he is, and neither is Bat Ye'or, at least not based on the evidence provided so far.
<dl>
<dd>This all comes down (as far as I can see) to a simple question of whether someone without academic credentials can be described as a "historian". My feeling is that in Bat Ye'or's case it's not unreasonable. Whether or not you agree with her conclusions, she's still notable for researching and writing about history. You can be a dentist without graduating from medical school. Whether you are practicing dentistry competently and with the approval of those who regulate dentists is an important but separate question. If you're known for your dental work, you're a "dentist" (even if you wind up in jail for practicing without a license) --<a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELeeHunter_0ab1.html" title="User:LeeHunter">Lee Hunter</a> 17:02, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>So you think Noam Chomsky is a historian? How about Gore Vidal? Would you at least go for calling her an "author of historical writings" or "writer of histories" or some such? Can you at least see that calling someone a historian implies a lot of things that are not true in Bat Ye'or's, or Noam Chomsky's, or Gore Vidal's cases? How about Holocaust deniers? A very, very few of them probably are, by most reckonings, historians, but what about the cottage industry of writers of very selective histories that are mostly read only by like-mindless people? Aren't some of these writers "notable for researching and writing about history," which you hold out as the criterion for being called a historian? (By the way, dentists normally go to dental school, not medical school, as any physician will be very quick to tell you&#160;;) ). -- DLH</dd>

<dd>Also coming from RFC. The relevant question is whether she is a public or non-public figure. If she is a public figure, then we clearly should state her name. (This wouldn't be enough reason to add truly private details such as how to contact her.) If she is a non-public figure then, to quote WP:BLP "editors should exercise restraint and include only information relevant to their notability." I don't see a real name as relevant to notability, so if non=public the name should be out. (But I'd still leave the redirect in place; only editors, as opposed to readers, will see it.) That said, my review of the talk page here plus some of the citations make me believe that she is a public figure. I would omit her maiden name; that is an irrelevant level of detail and infringes even further on her privacy. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 01:58, 10 December 2006 (UTC)

Insofar as her real name has appeared in peer-reviewed journals (in addition to the link above, I remember seeing her real and maiden names disclosed in another book review), there are probably no good reasons to hide it.

No? <i>(<a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetscott_c779.html" title="User talk:Netscott"><span title="Leave me a message.">→</span></a><a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetscott_af86.html" title="User:Netscott"><span style="background: white; color: grey" title="Go to my userpage.">Netscott</span></a>)</i> 05:47, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's not obvious to me that the connection between her writing and ethnicity is so central to what she does that it needs to be in the lead. It's in the next section for anyone who wants to know about it.

<dd>I agree. It is interesting on article dealing with critics of Islam , certain editors go around trying to emphasize ethnic/religious roots , particularly if they are Jewish , but for people who might be construed to be sympathetic to the causes of Muslims like Noan Chomsky, or Kofi Annan there seems to be little interest in their ethnic roots.--<a href="../../../c/l/t/User%7ECltFn_aba7.html" title="User:CltFn">CltFn</a> 13:11, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I also agree. Race or religion should never be mentioned in the lead paragraph unless it is somehow central to the person's notability. The fact that Ye'or is a Jew writing about Islam is part of her story but it has nothing to do with why she's notable (or notorious, depending on your POV). --<a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELeeHunter_0ab1.html" title="User:LeeHunter">Lee Hunter</a> 15:25, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Will the last three commentators please explain whether they think "British" should be left in? I think the intro should note somehow that she is an Egyptian Jewish woman who now lives in Great Britain: that she is an Egyptian Jewish woman is the main thing that makes her perspective interesting, isn't it? She writes about dhimmitude having been a dhimmi, after all. That's different from just having an academic interest in it, and not just because the reader might read in that she is biased (can't you give Wikipedia readers a little credit?). -- DLH</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Actually, I believe she lives in Switzerland now. I agree that her background is a relevant part of the article as it no doubt informs her writing, but I haven't seen anything to indicate that she became known <i>because</i> of it or that her background gives her any special authority. By pushing it up into the lead, we would be implying that her background is special. I'd rather let the readers decide for themselves. For example, in the lead paragraph for <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alex_Haley_c108.html" title="Alex Haley">Alex Haley</a> we don't mention that he's black even though he's very well known for writing about African-Americans.--<a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELeeHunter_0ab1.html" title="User:LeeHunter">Lee Hunter</a> 17:16, 20 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>How can readers decide what to think about it if they don't even know? An introduction, I think, ought to give a very quick overview of the subject that includes all the salient facts that might be of further interest. Many readers might not go beyond the intro, particularly if matters of direct interest are not indicated in it. I think the fact that Bat Ye'or is an Egyptian Jewish woman is such a matter, and apparently she agrees, else why would she have chosen the Hebrew for "daughter of the Nile" as her pen name? Her background IS special, at least as related to her main writing subject. Do you deny that, Lee? And I frankly think that Alex Haley's intro ought to indicate fairly directly that he is African-American, even if only by noting that his most famous work is a chronicle of his family's history from Africa through American slavery through recent times. -- DLH
<dl>
<dd>I think <i>everyone's</i> background is special for some reason or another. The policy at WP and most other publications that I'm aware of, is to focus on a person's achievements rather than their race or religion. We shouldn't hide the fact that she's Jewish and we shouldn't present it as being <i>more significant</i>. She's only significant for what she has written about others, not for the details of her life story. I also think most editors would disagree about Haley as well. Shakespeare wrote about white people but I'm sure (without even checking) that the lead paragraph to his article doesn't mention his race. --<a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELeeHunter_0ab1.html" title="User:LeeHunter">Lee Hunter</a> 18:53, 20 December 2006 (UTC)

<dl>
<dd>Is she not significant for the authority and perspective with which she writes what she writes?

It really, really should if it doesn't. -- DLH</dd>

<dd>I would always state people's <i>nationality</i> right in the first line of a bio. Even in "XXX is a <a href="../../../u/s/a/USA_f75d.html" title="USA">American</a> baseball player". The main reason for this is to counter the systemic bias towards an American point of view in the encyclopedia, a bias that creeps in because so much of the web is US-created. Next point that needs to be considered in every bio, to be consistent, is that many notable people have migrated between countries during their lives and this also should be considered. A bio of a living person should generally describe these facts in a way that the subject would approve of. In Bat Ye'or's case she has made much of her birth in Egypt and the circumstances of her leaving, so that would seem to constitute a good argument for including her Jewish faith in the lead, as well as her moving to Britain as a refugee and her current residence in Switzerland.<a href="../../../i/t/s/User%7EItsmejudith_5347.html" title="User:Itsmejudith">Itsmejudith</a> 19:03, 20 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Nationality and/or citizenship should certainly be mentioned in the intro. That's customary. On the other hand, her place of residence is a bit of trivia which is barely worth mentioning anywhere. I certainly can't see any reason for including it in the lead. I did a quick scan of bios in WP and found very few that mentioned the religion of the subject in the lead paragraph and in each of those cases there were compelling reasons to do so. Perhaps if you could show me examples of other articles where a writer's religion or race is mentioned in the lead paragraph I would find it easier to understand your point. --<a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELeeHunter_0ab1.html" title="User:LeeHunter">Lee Hunter</a> 19:57, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't think being an Egyptian Jewish woman is so much her race/religion as her national origin. We have <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_Said_407a.html" title="Edward Said">Edward Said</a> identified as "Palestinian-American," <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Soros_3686.html" title="George Soros">George Soros</a> indicated as having been born in Hungary, <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karl_Popper_510f.html" title="Karl Popper">Karl Popper</a> identified as being "Austrian and British" (?), <a href="../../../l/u/d/Ludwig_Wittgenstein_69e0.html" title="Ludwig Wittgenstein">Ludwig Wittgenstein</a> called "Austrian," <a href="../../../a/r/n/Arnold_Schwarzenegger_088f.html" title="Arnold Schwarzenegger">Arnold Schwarzenegger</a> noted as being born in Austria -- it seems that it is typical for trans-national people to have their original nationalities noted in the introduction, one way or another, even when it is largely irrelevant to whatever they are notable for. -- DLH</p>
<p><a href="../../../a/l/b/Albert_Einstein_8441.html" title="Albert Einstein">Albert Einstein</a> is noted in his intro as having been "born to a family of Jewish ancestry in Ulm, Württemberg, Germany," and his later American citizenship is not stated at all. -- DLH</p>

<dd>Sure there's a case for describing her as being born in Egypt. Actually it's customary in WP that the date and place of birth appears in the first sentence, but why "Jewish"? We don't introduce Edward Said as Christian, Soros as Jewish, or Wittgenstein as Catholic. I must say that Einstein is a surprise. I can't see any reason for mentioning his religion in the first paragraph. Looking at the talk page I see that this sentence has been disputed for a long time. --<a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELeeHunter_0ab1.html" title="User:LeeHunter">Lee Hunter</a> 21:16, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Was her nationality at birth Egyptian, though, or Jewish Egyptian? I expect that if you asked her, she would say that she was most distinctly not Egyptian, being a dhimmi. I don't see any reason not to mention Einstein's religion; while he was famous for his physics, there were many aspects of his public life for which his religion was relevant -- leaving Germany, for example. Don't concede this point to me, though, before considering why Bat Ye'or left Egypt.&#160;;) -- DLH
<dl>
<dd>It was certainly an important part of her life story but her life story is not the reason why there is an article about her in Wikipedia. Einstein's life story, on the other hand, is more relevant (although I still don't think it justifies making an exception). Religion also played a part in the life stories of Soros, Said, Wittgenstein, but we don't introduce them by their religion. In the same way you wouldn't introduce someone at a party by proclaiming their religion or race. You'll find this is very consistent throughout Wikipedia. Einstein is an exception but there is an ongoing debate over the question even there. --<a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELeeHunter_0ab1.html" title="User:LeeHunter">Lee Hunter</a> 21:41, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>The part I objected to was "she personally experienced living as a dhimmi". This goes beyond a factual statement of her life story to an interpretation of what it was about.

<dd>You missed my point completely.

Furthermore, Spencer and Ye'or are part of the same inbred clique of pseudo-historians making their living entirely through selling the idea of Islam as enemy.

Quoting masses of primary sources, for example, is not in itself evidence of good historical research.<a href="../../../i/t/s/User%7EItsmejudith_5347.html" title="User:Itsmejudith">Itsmejudith</a> 19:38, 21 December 2006 (UTC)

<p>We can definitely write an article. It is a biography of a living person so we have guidelines to help us. And we have consensus on a structure: 1. who is she, 2, what has she done, 3. achievements/praise/accolades, 4. criticism. I would support the point being made briefly that she refers copiously to primary sources - go ahead and add it. I remember somewhere on a talk page saying that at least she cites her sources properly so editors have what you could call an "audit-trail" for the facts. Everyone's got some good points!

<dd>In the Communist Party’s Morning Star newspaper last September, Geoff Brown cited both the BNP’s support for Israel against Hezbollah, and chairman Nick Griffin’s support for the Jewish writer Bat Ye’or who has warned of an Islamist takeover of Europe, as evidence of a Jewish/fascist axis. <a href="http://www.melaniephillips.com/articles-new/?p=463" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.melaniephillips.com/articles-new/?p=463" rel="nofollow">[13]</a></dd>

<dd>And, for Griffin, the most important of these "real struggles" is against Muslims. In an article posted on the BNP website earlier this year, Griffin stated emphatically: "To even hint of making common cause with Islam – or put ourselves in a position when opponents can suggest to the masses that this is the case – is political insanity." He rejected the arguments of "those 'hardliners' who would rather attack the Jews than the Muslims," condemning them as "people whose one-track concern about 'the Jews' is blinding them to the clear and present danger of resurgent Islam." Griffin argued that, rather than attacking the Jewish community, "We should be positioning ourselves to take advantage for our own political ends of the growing wave of public hostility to Islam currently being whipped up by the mass media. Significantly, Griffin has justified his party's anti-Muslim policy by referring approvingly to the writer Bat Ye'or, whom the New York Times has described as one of the "most extreme voices on the new Jewish right." <a href="http://www.islamophobia-watch.com/islamophobia-watch/2006/9/20/muslims-are-the-bnps-new-target.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.islamophobia-watch.com/islamophobia-watch/2006/9/20/muslims-are-the-bnps-new-target.html" rel="nofollow">[14]</a></dd>

<p>I am against including the full academic credentials inline of everyone who has written about Bat Ye'or (or about anyone in a bio). To my mind it makes for clunky reading and leaves the way open to point-scoring about which authority sounds most eminent. If they're worth citing, and especially if they have their own WP entry, then they are worth citing.

<dd>I'd say I mostly agree with that. I don't think Professor at Harvard is problematic but Laurence A. Tisch professor is getting rather wordy... and it's not that it isn't useful to know that they are paid by endowment and not just another professor... but, professors like that tend to have their own pages. I am more worried about context for quotes produced on the back of the book, however. (or any other quotes that we only have a snippet of). <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGrenavitar_5bda.html" title="User:Grenavitar">gren</a> <a href="../../../g/r/e/User_talk%7EGrenavitar_133f.html" title="User talk:Grenavitar">グレン</a> 21:17, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's important to tell readers who we're quoting, in part as a courtesy so people don't have to move back and forth between articles, and in part because it's relevant to Bat Ye'or's reputation that she has full professors at top universities either praising or criticizing her.</dd>

<dd>There is a problem of systemic bias in that the concept of "full professor" does not exist in the UK or European context. In the UK the mainstream academic staff are called "lecturers", and I have had tiresome arguments with those who have tried to say that those staff are not worth quoting, and the equivalents of US "full professors" are called simply "professors". They are less likely in the US to be the "Fred Bloggs Professor". In France the situation is different again. As for quotes from the back of books are concerned, I don't think they're appropriate. Publishers are always going to take the best bits.

<dd>*sigh* two replies destroyed by edit conflicts since IE doesn't save inputs when you press back. Summary: 1) I don't particularly care about the professors since I see the point with both of you. 2) I think we need to take the book cover issues up at <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_Sources_b1a8.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable Sources">Wikipedia:Reliable Sources</a>. I think it is clear that they are biased but it's also clear that the reviewers are important. Hopefully we can find full reviews. Cohen's quote means that Bat Ye'or takes certain acts out of context to make it seem like more persecution than there is? I don't understand how it doesn't actually mean anything"... As to the context around the quote it should be cleared up and make sure that it is the main point of his review... and a complete bibliographic entry should be made.

<dd>In reality, Cohen is talking about the "myth of interfaith utopia" and, mostly as an aside, contrasts it with the "counter-myth of Islamic persecution"; it's a complicated argument and point that's mostly about the folly and historical anachronism of "constructing Jewish history around the idea of Islamic tolerance". Perhaps unsurprisingly, Cohen's point has been misrepresented, and used as a crude club to misleadingly bash Bat Ye'or. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 14:16, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Arrow, do you have any source for qualifications she might hold? As the article stands it reads like she started programs of study but didn't complete them.

<dd>She has had her work published in peer-reviewed academic journals. That is some qualification. We should point out that the state of Islamic Studies departments has been such that it would be hard for someone as critical as her to get a PhD despite the high level of scholarship. <a href="../../../a/r/r/User%7EArrow740_2a2c.html" title="User:Arrow740">Arrow740</a> 21:49, 13 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Sorry to have left a break between these. Any papers she has in peer-reviewed academic journals should be cited here - they aren't at the moment. All I found from a search of the main journal database was some letters to journals. Please note that she wouldn't necessarily have had to get a PhD from an Islamic Studies department - are they of identical politics in all Western countries? In <i>Eurabia</i> she is addresses the history of the European Union so could have enrolled in a European Studies department. Or for her other interests perhaps in a history department. <a href="../../../i/t/s/User%7EItsmejudith_5347.html" title="User:Itsmejudith">Itsmejudith</a> 19:05, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Re a point made by Slim in an earlier section: can it be the case that book reviews are written only for a publisher? I have never heard of this. I think publishers read the reviews and pick out sentences that reflect well on the book. Even good publishers seem to have no compunction about cherry-picking in this way. I have found an internet link to a comment by Martin Gilbert about <i>Eurabia</i> that seems to be a different extract from the same review - it is from a book distributor so not really a reliable source - but it would seem to indicate that a longer piece was originally written. <a href="../../../i/t/s/User%7EItsmejudith_5347.html" title="User:Itsmejudith">Itsmejudith</a> 16:37, 13 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Publishers have been known to solicit comments.

<dd>The comment was published, and we use material that has been published. We never enquire as to whether more of it was published elsewhere, so I don't know why we'd want to do it in this case. Also, publishers do elicit comments, and sometimes people will write to the publisher spontaneously after reading a first edition or a manuscript. It's smacking a little of original research to be trying to track down the origin and context of the reviews. If the comments were negative, would we still be doing that, I wonder. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 07:59, 14 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>This isn't like we're using "The Clash of Civilizations" article but could learn more from <i>The Clash of Civilizations</i> book. And original research? I have no idea how you could come to that conclusion. It would seem to me that it would only make an article better to actually contextualize specific points of praise and it seems ludicrous to me that you think this could be negative in any way. I was not inspired by the urge to remove all positive comments--nor have I asked that it be done. I reacted when I saw a citation saying "Review reproduced on the back cover of <i>Eurabia</i>" thinking it was a troll. I have no problem keeping that or other praising quotes if it represents the author's view. I have no problem if you believe that it is okay to use quotes from book covers--I disagree, but these things happen. I do have a problem that you would make it seem like I want to promote original research and an attempt to pan the book. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGrenavitar_5bda.html" title="User:Grenavitar">gren</a> <a href="../../../g/r/e/User_talk%7EGrenavitar_133f.html" title="User talk:Grenavitar">グレン</a> 08:26, 14 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Gren, I have a lot of respect for your editing, as I hope you know. But I've been concerned about what's been happening on this article for a long time — nothing to do with you, I should add. As a community, we have an unfortunate tendency to create attack pages about living persons, and this page has seen some really poor editing, and even some spiteful editing. So when I see positive comments being scrutinized, but not negative ones, I wonder why.</dd>
<dd>As to the reviews, there's no way that a review by Sir Martin Gilbert or any of the others would be used inappropriately by a responsible publisher, and we have no reason to believe that Fairleigh Dickinson University Press is anything but responsible. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 08:36, 14 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>No, I agree with you and I haven't really been present for all the debates of this article. Can we agree on this, at least: if there is a full review it is always to be preferred over book cover quotes? And, it's not that I think Fairleigh Dickinson University Press is taking his argument from thin air, but, you almost never find such simplistic reviews and I think our whole method of "Author X likes Bat Ye'or; Author Y doesn't" is providing a relatively uninformative laundry list to people. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGrenavitar_5bda.html" title="User:Grenavitar">gren</a> <a href="../../../g/r/e/User_talk%7EGrenavitar_133f.html" title="User talk:Grenavitar">グレン</a> 09:00, 14 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, I agree with both your points: that full reviews are to be preferred, and that laundry lists are not good. The only reason I added to the list was that there were positive reviews by notable people that weren't included, and the negative had to be balanced by them, but I totally agree with your point below about the importance of nuance, and that it would be preferable to write an intelligent article about her views, interspersed with criticism or support from authoritative commentators. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 10:10, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There have been several other reviews of Bat Ye'or's books in academic journals and the serious/literary press. Does anyone have any objections if I begin to include them? I promise to reflect them in a completely even-handed way irrespective of whether they are favourable, unfavourable or mixed. I will add all the views that I can find so long as the source is reliable in WP terms. The individual authors are not necessarily going to be "notable".

<dd>I'm not persuaded of the need to keep adding review comments. It's fair enough if the author is notable and knowledgeable, but I'm unclear about the value of including random comments from unknown reviewers. I suppose if the comment itself is particularly interesting, that might make a difference. Perhaps you could let us know in advance what you'd like to include? <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 08:40, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm not against it, per se, but I think we need to evaluate how we do reviews. Right now it's a laundry list of who generally supports her idea and who doesn't which serves no real purpose. I think it should be a discussion of her thesis and criticism of it that represents a discussion (based on the reviews) of what parts of her methodology come into question and which parts generally hold up. Presenting arguments about her as a dichotomous good or bad serves to do nothing and I would assume that scholars who generally support her or disagree will have nuance to their argument which can help us to understand which of her arguments come under the most criticism and which seem to stand up. But, this is a distant dream... We could do a bibliography of reviews from notable publications / people at the end, maybe, so people can know where to find reviews... but that may better be done on the book pages instead of hers. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGrenavitar_5bda.html" title="User:Grenavitar">gren</a> <a href="../../../g/r/e/User_talk%7EGrenavitar_133f.html" title="User talk:Grenavitar">グレン</a> 09:09, 14 February 2007 (UTC)

<p>I agree with Slim that there is no point in multiplying comments unless we are working systematically. Scholarly reviews will naturally be nuanced and that creates an onus on all of us to be honest and not cherry-pick. This is the full list of academic reviews from 1980 onwards. I have only accessed a few of them so far. All of them are good candidates for RS; they are the outcome of serious consideration and may yield many insights not only for this article but for others too.</p>

<dd>Arrow, her books were published by *a* university press, which is not a mainstream academic imprint. It is only one opinion that her views have been widely accepted by scholars. So far we have no indication that she holds any qualifications at all and she has never held an academic post. I personally don't believe she meets WP criteria as a source for history articles. It would be useful to have a judgement from on high to settle this question and perhaps at the same time the similar questionmark over <a href="../../../k/o/e/Koenraad_Elst_d769.html" title="Koenraad Elst">Koenraad Elst</a>. <a href="../../../i/t/s/User%7EItsmejudith_5347.html" title="User:Itsmejudith">Itsmejudith</a> 22:18, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, maybe we'll judge when we've read all the reviews and see what they say about her scholarship. It will also be interesting to see whether they change over time, i.e. whether her latest books have been received differently from her earlier ones. I certainly didn't mean to present an incomplete selection of reviews: these are all those turned up by a systematic search of the journals under the keywords "Bat Ye'or" and "dhimmi" in one of the main scholarly databases. Please add any more you can find. Of course there are also the literary magazines and others that are not listed as scholarly journals but are good sources. As for "a judgement from on high", I'm musing really, but it would be good to have a ruling following thorough discussion by people not directly involved in this particular case. Without the possibility of getting further opinions in, these arguments drag on so long. I always tend to the view that WP disputes are best resolved by looking to the sources: is it reliable, is it quoted fairly, is there no undue weight. Problem should be solved - would it were so simple in reality though. <a href="../../../i/t/s/User%7EItsmejudith_5347.html" title="User:Itsmejudith">Itsmejudith</a> 23:17, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No, I know what you put on the Talk: page. And this issue must be cleared up, because if you won't use the Talk: pages in good faith, then there's no point in continuing. If I know that you will admit you didn't know who Craig Smith was, and will be truthful going forward, then there's a possibility we will come to agreement on all sorts of things. However, if you continue to make false statements on the Talk: page then I can't trust anything you do, and will simply have to revert it regardless.

<dd>Jayjg I suggest you keep religion out of this. If you were faithful to <b>any</b> religion (including Judaism) you would not attempt to portray Islam as racist and anti-semitic (Judaism doesn't teach Israelites to hate their Ishmaelite brothers does it?). Sure I was confused by Craig Smith, but that was due to a typo on Beit Or's part. Clearly I shouldv'e known better than to assume that Biet Or had presented the name correctly. <b>What I don't understand is why you will "revert instantly in everything [I] do" because of a typo?</b> Please respond to the argument I've made and stop making a HUGE deal out of a typo.<a href="../../../b/l/e/User%7EBless_sins_31e5.html" title="User:Bless sins">Bless sins</a> 04:27, 25 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>You liked the fact that it was criticism, and didn't care who made it. Then when you were challenged on who made the criticism, you dodged and twisted for several days. Then you finally found out it was a different Craig Smith than you thought, and pretended that you had it right all the time, but were merely responding to Beit Or's question. And by the way, the article has <b>always</b> referred to him as "Craig R. Smith", for at least 6 months now, so it's not Beit Or's fault.</dd>
<dd>You've wasted an awful lot of our time here, and have been untruthful. It's very hard to work with someone who does that. The huge deal isn't the "typo", it's all the rest of it, <i>as you know</i>. You continue to act this way on other pages as well; at first insisting that all references on an article must refer to "antisemitism", then when the tables are turned and it is pointed out that the references <i>you</i> have brought don't refer to antisemitism, play dumb for 2 weeks, edit-warring and wasting huge amounts of time. I need to know that you'll stop doing this from now on; no weaseling, no nonsense. Otherwise, I'll have to assume that every single one of your edits is made under false pretenses or in violation of policy. This is really getting close to the end here, Bless sins. You have a chance now; I really suggest you admit your errors and move on. After that I'll respond to the arguments you've made, but <i>only</i> after that. And if you don't; well, it's hard to edit when your edits can't be trusted, and therefore must be reverted. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 04:36, 25 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I have discussed this briefly with SlimVirgin before and I don't disagree... but I feel Jayjg and you(?) are using this as an excuse to remove the content as if it were vandalism or simple policy violation instead of a neutrality dispute. The content is not particularly malicious. It's very critical of her work--yes--but this should be solved by discussing what is the most neutral, not using BLP to blanket label it as against policy to post it. Looking at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bat_Ye%27or&amp;diff=114702589&amp;oldid=114691451" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bat_Ye%27or&amp;diff=114702589&amp;oldid=114691451" rel="nofollow">the edit in question</a> I believe that the right hand side is more better; however, that does not mean that I support the logic that we have to support that version because of BLP. We should support it because it's more neutral. The bias BLP is talking about is in our writing not that we can't use sources that dislike the person in question. The policy is not an excuse for us to question if our (reliable) sources are biased... but to make sure our writing isn't. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGrenavitar_5bda.html" title="User:Grenavitar">gren</a> <a href="../../../g/r/e/User_talk%7EGrenavitar_133f.html" title="User talk:Grenavitar">グレン</a> 03:32, 13 March 2007 (UTC)

<p>&lt;reset&gt; Ahmed is the President and director of Minaret of Freedom Insitute.

<dd>Why are you asking me to repeat information? Ahmed's area of expertise are: religion and progress, religion and freedom, Islam, Muslim-Christian Understanding.

<dd>I think critical material from the Ahmad article meets standards. First, the review was published in the "American Journal of Islamic Social Sciences", which seems to be a refereed (albeit little-known) journal that is included in all of the major journal indexes and repositories I can see. Second, although Dr. Ahmad is not a professor, neither is Bat Ye'or, and he is a lecturer at a major university. Third, if the quote being used from the review right now isn't appropriate, there are better ones from that article. I'm not saying this in agreement or disagreement with the criticism, but I will stand up for the right for appropriate criticism to appear in any Wikipedia article. - <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerzbow_28f9.html" title="User:Merzbow">Merzbow</a> 04:49, 20 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>It's important to note that being published by the Association of Muslim Social Scientists and the International Institute of Islamic Thought, the American Journal of Islamic Social Sciences is a highly partisan source. Ahmad is no conceivable way an expert on the history of non-Muslims under the Muslim rule, which is the subject of Bat Ye'or; academically, he is a very minor figure. He is a Muslim and a social scientist, which qualifies him to publish in the American Journal of Islamic Social Sciences, which is precisely a forum for people like him. The article already includes criticism by notable people, and per <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>, I strongly oppose including any criticism by random individuals that can be unearthed. <a href="../../../b/e/i/User%7EBeit_Or_17e0.html" title="User:Beit Or">Beit</a> <a href="../../../b/e/i/User_talk%7EBeit_Or_8e68.html" title="User talk:Beit Or">Or</a> 21:57, 20 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Yet again I have to step in to to defend the place of academic comment in Wikipedia. Please see <a href="../../../a/c/a/Academic_journal.html" title="Academic journal">academic journal</a> for why trying to apply the epithet "highly partisan" to the American Journal of Islamic Social Sciences tells us more about you as an editor than it does about that journal. It is a reliable source. The author is an academic and it is spurious to bring up his religion, which in any case we do not know for sure. <a href="../../../i/t/s/User%7EItsmejudith_5347.html" title="User:Itsmejudith">Itsmejudith</a> 22:06, 21 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>See <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a> as to why editors should comment on content, not on other editors. Your comment above says exactly nothing on content, nor does it contain any arguments on why an article by non-notable person in a fringe (and, yes, partisan) magazine is an example of notable criticism, worthy being included in the article. <a href="../../../b/e/i/User%7EBeit_Or_17e0.html" title="User:Beit Or">Beit</a> <a href="../../../b/e/i/User_talk%7EBeit_Or_8e68.html" title="User talk:Beit Or">Or</a> 17:51, 22 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Because it's *not* a magazine, it's an *academic journal*. There is still such a thing as scholarship, still, thank goodness. <a href="../../../i/t/s/User%7EItsmejudith_5347.html" title="User:Itsmejudith">Itsmejudith</a> 20:58, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
