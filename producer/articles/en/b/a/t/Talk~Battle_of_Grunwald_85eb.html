<p><b>The battle was fought in a plain betwwen the villages of Grunwald, Stebark/Tannenberg and Lodwigowo.</b> -- cc 06:49, 8 Dec 2003 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>Is it Grunwald, or Grünewald? <a href="../../../j/h/k/JHK_7325.html" title="JHK">JHK</a></p>
<p>In Polish it is certainly Grunwald. And it is in middle of Poland now, so that should be a default spelling on Wikipedia. Not to mention that its simpler (On the other hand this is etymologically clearly a German word.). If German spelling is Grünewald or whatever you can add a note about this spelling. --<a href="../../../t/a/w/Taw.html" title="Taw">Taw</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>Taw, here's my take in it -- if the battle took place when the area had a German name, then the German name is the one most English-speakers would use. In the case of all of those Baltic ex-German places that now have Russian or Polish names, I think we should go by the current name -- the difference is that cities are living things, so to speak -- our point of reference is now, and then we trace back through history to see other names. For a battle or other event, like the Defenestration of Prague (not Praha), we default to the most normally used (in current English) name. Does that make sense? I'm still not sure about the name, though -- does Grunwald mean Green Forest in Polish? or is it a Polanization of a German name? I'll try to look up the Battle in English and see what the norm is. <a href="../../../j/h/k/JHK_7325.html" title="JHK">JHK</a></dd>
</dl>
<p>I believe it should be "Grunwald" - apart from the current name of the Polish location, this name is most common. Currently, the re-enacting groups are inviting to the battle of Grunwald, not Grünewald (and such is the name on roadmapes). Searching in Google, I've found 722 entries of "battle of Grunwald" and only 21 "battle of Grünewald". So, most speakers don't use it. There are also 477 entries of "battle of Tannenberg" 1410. This battle is not known in Poland as battle of Tannneberg at all. Therefore, I think, that there should be a redirect from <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Tannenberg_%281410%29_06ed.html" title="Battle of Tannenberg (1410)">battle of Tannenberg (1410)</a> to <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Grunwald_ebf5.html" title="Battle of Grunwald">battle of Grunwald</a>, and the later should be supplemented with info: "also known as the battle of Tanneberg (1410)" <a href="../../../p/i/b/User%7EPibwl_a4e2.html" title="User:Pibwl">Pibwl</a> 12:35, 2 Dec 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>In my opinion the preferred term is <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Grunwald_ebf5.html" title="Battle of Grunwald">Battle of Grunwald</a> as it is commonly known. The alternative name is Battle of Tannenberg(Stebark). Please note that there was another battle of Tannenberg in 1914 during <a href="../../../w/w/i/WWI_f5e9.html" title="WWI">WWI</a> -- cc, 21:56, 3 Dec 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>I added merge boilerplates. For the record this Battle is called Battle of Tannenberg in Encyclopedia Britannica Online <a href="../../../p/r/z/User%7EPrzepla_2561.html" title="User:Przepla">Przepla</a> 19:22, 4 Dec 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>I see this has been discussed already, but I thought I would mention (as someone who lives nowhere near the site of the battles) that both the 1410 one and the 1914 one are known as Tannenberg, to me. I'm not sure if it matters that it called Grunwald in Poland, since this is in English...we've had this debate over other things on the Wikipedia today, too. Ah well, I suppose Grunwald is acceptable...as long as it's not at Zalgris&#160;:) <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Bishop_face.html" title="User:Adam Bishop">Adam Bishop</a> 06:42, 8 Dec 2003 (UTC)</p>

<pre>
The article refered by the first external link is better then the wikipedian.
For one main reason.
It is not so inclined towards one point of view.
</pre>
<p>Dlugosz is the only source, no german sources, no letters, no good.</p>
<p>There are some interesting places.</p>
<p>--- "The battle of Grunwald is regarded as one of the most important battles in the Polish history. In Poland there is commonly known a symbol of two swords, which were supposedly given to king Jagiello before the battle by the Teutonic envoys to "raise Polish desire for battle"."</p>
<p>It was one of the most important battles in Order, Polish and Lithuanian history. That is in history of all together, each two, and each one of mentioned above.</p>
<p>Two swords for one man? Interesting. AFAIK the two unsheathed swords were for Vytautas &amp; Jogaila, just the former was busy. Jogaila took them both but they were not both for him. This should be mentioned.</p>
<p>The story about "The commonly known symbol" was written down in some primary source(s) and now translated into other languages, including lithuanian. The story is actually known to all that study this matter, but in Lithuania it is in the school program, so we may say it is "commonly known" here also.</p>
<p>So it is not "in the Polish", "In Poland" and not "to raise Polish desire".</p>
<p><br /></p>
<hr />
<pre>
"In 1385 the Union of Krevo joined the crowns "
</pre>
<pre>
"of his cousin Vytautas the Great 
(to whom Jagiełło had ceded power in Lithuania in the wake of his marriage to the Polish queen)"
</pre>
<p>Lithuania had no crown at the time and joining of smthing else then bloodshed before the end of internal conflicts in 1392 is questionable.</p>
<p>Yes, Jogaila ceded power, but that should be evaluated as more or less formal act, for, actually, not ceding it he could loose it at any moment. One shouldn't write first without another and another is a separate paragraph.</p>
<p>I think it would look better without braces smth like.. In 1392 after internal conflict Vytautas became defacto ruler of GDL. and link.</p>
<hr />
<pre>
"but soon the withdrawal turned into a rapid retreat towards the marshes and woods."
</pre>
<p>You forgot to cite the other polish author that states that lithuanians fled to the Vilnius itself. And still were important in the siege.</p>
<p>Now thats another point of view as an opposition.</p>
<p>Lithuanians commited a m a n e u v e r .</p>
<p>Read the first external link if nothing better is available to you.</p>
<p>It is as probable as the fact that it was polish peasantry that killed poor Jungingen or as real are the numbers. So it should be mentioned in the similar manner. ___maybe more remrks later___</p>
<hr />
<pre>
", it was already to late for the"
</pre>
<p>If this is a grammar mistake this article is not ready to be a "featured article" candidate. And still "they were doomed" sounds so much better then "it was too late"</p>
<hr />
<p>There are overestimations about every great battle. The fact that chroniclers were educated enough to know how big numbers(and not only "big hosts" or "as far as the eye can see") are written does not make their estimations more important. It should be better to write some probable,believable and/or agreed upon numbers o n l y. And then links links links to sources and excerpts if you wish.<a href="../../../v/y/t/User%7EVytautas_8aa0.html" title="User:Vytautas">Vytautas</a></p>

<dl>
<dd>Ok, one by one:
<ol>
<li>Długosz and the anonymous report of the battle are the only credible sources out there (and even their credibility is somehow difficult to assess). That's why it is better to give the reader a choice, instead of supporting just one version. I believe that the <b>Opposing forces</b> chapter gives a pretty good insight in the matter. Could you be more specific as to what you think should be changed?</li>
<li>Also, what German sources or letters should be mentioned? Please put them down so that we could check them.</li>
<li>As to the symbol - feel free to change it. It's wikipedia, after all. It would take less time to correct that than to complain at the talk page ;)</li>
<li>As to the Union of Krevo - I believe that it is but a sidenote here. Both of us know the complexity of the matter, but IMHO it should be described in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/Union_of_Krevo_c1f7.html" title="Union of Krevo">Union of Krevo</a> article, not here. For an average reader interested in the battle, the political background of the leaders is but a matter of secondary importance.</li>
<li>As to the retreat - again, feel free to add the Lithuanian point of view. It is not certain what actually happened, so both versions are correct. I find the Lithuanian version of the story with some sort of a strategic withdrawal slightly less credible (and especially so because of the exposed Polish flank after the Lithuanians fled the battlefield), but it is but my own oppinion. Feel free to add the other leg.</li>
<li>As to the too late/they were doomed - don't you think it's a matter of style? <a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalibutt_9a46.html" title="User:Halibutt">Halibu</a><a href="../../../h/a/l/User_talk%7EHalibutt_5cbf.html" title="User talk:Halibutt">tt</a> 15:34, Jan 9, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<blockquote>
<p>The battle of Grunwald is regarded as one of the most important battles in the Polish history. In eve of WWI (1910 marking half millennium of the battle has been erected Grunwald monument in Krakow. The ceremony spawn demonstration of outraged of Polish society against aggressive politics of German Empire including forcible germanisation of Poles. Polish poet Konopnicka wrote fiercely anti-German poem Rota. About the same time Henryk Sienkiewicz wrote his anti-German book The Teutonic Knights. The book was eventually depicted in the propaganda film The Teutonic Knights (Polish: Krzyżacy) by Aleksander Ford.</p>

<p>Actually the article contains the most common error.. it's written as thought the battle was the war at the same time - but we cannot treat it in that way. BoG was a single battle of the whole war 1409-1411 (there were more battles like Koronowo for example that was also an interesting piece of warcraft). I dont know why (ok i know actually :P) but this is an example of a battle which is more important than the war.

<p>The Poland and Lithuania parts are well thought out, and the German part is ok. However I'm having a hard time with the Russia / Soviet Union / Belarus parts.

<p>I am more than sure he ment "verb"... He is actually correct, despite the mediocre english. If you look at a historic map of Europe couple of centuries before Tannenberg/Grunwald you shall see Kievan Rus, a country that was home to the ancient russians (eastern slavs). Or did you really think that Lithuania, a small country which got it's own writing in 17-18th centuries was a medieval superpower? Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, at it's peak, had 50 to 70 percent of it's population as ethnically russian (eastern slav).</p>

<dd>Sorry, but I cannot register. Halibutt, you are most likely right about the herb/gerb thing, I'm astonished how that interpretation hasn't crossed my mind. To Piotrus - the numbers were from my memory - unfortunately I was unable to locate any sorces that support the 70% as of yet, so I have to say that 50% sounds more reasonable. Ruthenians came from the same root as modern Russians, Ukrainians and Belorussians - the Ancient Russians (which are obviously not the same as the modern Russians). As a matter of fact, Ukrainians refered to themselves as Russians (руський) until the early 19th century. The Jagellonian dynasty itself had some solid Ancient Russian roots. Ruthenia is latin for Russia (ie. like the element Ruthenium). In Russian Ruthenians are known as Rusins (русины).</dd>

<p>This discussion, due to anonyms and Halibutt has one big inconsistency, that makes me laugh. If the ancient Lithuania was Ruthenia or Rus, then why it is called Lithuania? Actually, due to Mongol invasion Kievan Rus was weakened and medieval Lithuania overpovered it in 13-15 century. Some of Lithuanian rulers had been Ruthenian only in their mothers lineage, and it is just natural, in most European countries the ruling nobles married for political reasons, and you hardly find "poor blood" ruler of even the most ethnically monolithic countries of Europe. Lithuanians do use pillars of Gediminas, not as a state coat of arms (English doesn't have a word 'herb' in that meaning), but as a national symbol often. As to knight symbol, both Lithuania and Belarus are historically entitled to use it, there is no problem with the symbols repeating in different states, for example, an eagle in various forms is used in many countries and they don't argue over the ownership of it. <a href="../../../j/u/r/User%7EJuraune_3bc3.html" title="User:Juraune">Juraune</a> 18:12, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Corrected the list of battle participants according to the monography 'Battle of Grunwald' by Mečislovas Jučas, but still some of the men under Vytautas, mentioned in the monography are not in the list.

<p>Re-reading this section, a few months later in its entirety, is kind of funny. Two points, Juraune has very succinctly put the <a href="../../../h/e/r/Heraldry.html" title="Heraldry">Heraldry</a> issue to bed on July 18. It was what the anon meant (not verb), and somehow her comments seems to be more correct than Hal's interpretation of Lithuanian heraldry. Part of my laugh came as a result of Piotrus' interesting and revealing comment <i>Or did you really think that Lithuania, a small country which got it's own writing in 17-18th centuries, was a medieval superpower</i>? Very interesting comment! This is especially interesting, considering Piotrus' recent conciliatory remarks on the Jogaila talk page. The remarks that said the size and demographics of the two countries are irrelevant in the larger scheme of things, seemed rather neutral and poignant as I read them at the time. Doesn't seem to agree and concur with your above comments, does it? It's extra humorous when one takes into consideration that most historians don't equate medieval might (superpower), with literacy (got its own writing). Furthermore regarding the question of size and it's importance, in context of the discussion. Sweden did quite a number on the Rzeczpospolita during the <a href="../../../d/e/l/Deluge.html" title="Deluge">Deluge</a>.

<p>Why did you decide to name Grand Duke Vitovt - Vytautas? Why not to call him John? Vytautas is as close to the chronicles as John! His full name was Grand Duke Vitovt Alexander. In some chronicles you can see Vitold, but never Vytautas. Like for example here, where the page discusses the Order of Dragon: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_the_Dragon" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_the_Dragon" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_the_Dragon</a></p>
<p>There is a mistake though. Here the author called him Vitovd.</p>

I do not understand: "he is known as Vytautas today". In a tiny Lithuania maybe he is known as Vytautas. Nodoby argues about this. But what was his name? Vitovt Alexander. Plus, the name Vitovt is used by a much bigger number of people in Belarus, Ukraine, and even Russia.

<p>Moreover, I would suggest for everyone to read this rule of Wikipedia:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>NPOV requires views to be represented without bias. A bias is a prejudice in a general or specific sense, usually in the sense for having a predilection to one particular point of view or ideology. One is said to be biased if one is influenced by one's biases. A bias could, for example, lead one to accept or not-accept the truth of a claim, not because of the strength of the claim itself, but because it does or does not correspond to one's own preconceived ideas.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>In the current article we can see a very good example of <i>"Ethnic or racial bias, including racism, nationalism and regionalism"</i> The only point of view represented here is the one of the modern day Lithuania. This country is very much different from the claimed ancestor <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grand_Duchy_of_Lithuania_4695.html" title="Grand Duchy of Lithuania">Grand Duchy of Lithuania</a>, which included Belarus, and some parts of Ukraine and Russia. Nowadays Lithuania was just a small part of it, which was mostly ethnically and linguistically different from the rest of the land.</p>
<p>This article abuses national feelings of other people who comprised the state. And the issue of a fictional name of Vytautas is just an egregious lie. What can I do with this? I just name things with their own names.Max Kanowski 03:48, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Surely it was known enough yb Germans to deliberately call the later battle in 1914 also "Tannenberg". Anyway. it's quite common thing - Swedes do not know about Kircholm, while we do not know about some battles won by them.</dd>

<dd>I don't know who first brought up that non-sense that "re-naming" the battle of 1914 is anyhow connected with the battle of 1410. The press, that was unaware of any details of the battle, dubbed the battle initially the "Battle of Allenstein", but Hindenburg wanted it to be called the "Battle of Tannenberg". Why? Take a look at a map of the battle field and one can clearly see (<a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bild:Tannenberg3008.jpg" class="external free" title="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bild:Tannenberg3008.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bild:Tannenberg3008.jpg</a>) that Tannenberg is much more appropriate.</dd>

<p>I agree about the over importance which this article lauds upon the Battle of Tannenberg. While it was a decisive defeat for the Teutonic Knights, it was just one small part of a much larger decline AND Heinrich von Plauen reversed virtually all of Poland's gains within a year. Tannenberg is really not a widely known battle outside of Poland and Lithuania.</p>

<p>I think there is an error with that part of the text, the moldavian soldiers were certainly not merceneries, they were sent by the Moldavian Vojvode Alexander the Good (Alexandru cel Bun 1400-1432) as part of his alliance with the poles (initiated and restated in a few treaties around 1407 and 1412). Actually Alexander sent aid twice to his polish allies, during the battles of Grunwald and of Marienburg. These are well known and taught in school facts (in Romania). //Nea Draku'//</p>

<p>The issue of a false Lithuanian retreat on the left flank has been ruled almost impossible by just about every non-Lithuanian historian of the battle. It is outrageously difficult to organize the full-scale retreat of 1/3 of a terribly multi-ethnic army; the explanation that Tatar troops counter attacked out of the retreat is completely unsupported by historical evidence. This is an era where you didn't know if your battlefield commander was dead for hours. Imagine attempting to organize the turn-around of thousands of men, many of whom are probably less keen about standing and fighting than their leaders would prefer. The left flank was basically a contest between light Eastern European forces and heavy Western men-at-arms. A retreat seems totally understandable under such circumstances though Vitautus masterfully took advantage of the Order's blind charge for glory.</p>
