<p>Battle Cry is just starting up, so it's not yet clear how militant it will become. The leader, <a href="../../../r/o/n/Ron_Luce_5f9c.html" title="Ron Luce">Ron Luce</a>, has advocated disruptive non-violent protest in the past <a href="http://www.barf.org/archive/carman_ministries/01/index.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.barf.org/archive/carman_ministries/01/index.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. The language gets aggressive at times: <i>"A R.I.O.T. Squad is a group of wild teens who want to stir up some trouble for the devil. They are tired of living a boring Christian life and they want some action."</i> This is a concern. There's no verified track record of violence. But Luce is forging a weapon. What will he do with it? --<a href="../../../n/a/g/User%7ENagle_f5e2.html" title="User:Nagle">John Nagle</a> 18:51, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>You would really need to try to understand the concept of "<a href="../../../s/p/i/Spiritual_warfare.html" title="Spiritual warfare">spiritual warfare</a>" before you can begin to understand the "weapon" metaphors that <a href="../../../r/o/n/Ron_Luce_5f9c.html" title="Ron Luce">Ron Luce</a> and other evangelistic Christian ministers use in sermons and exhortations. Christianity teaches that there is an ongoing spiritual war for the souls of mankind, and some sects and denominations teach that there are "demonic forces" at work. One example in Christian literature that illustrates the principle is <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frank_Peretti_e23d.html" title="Frank Peretti">Frank Peretti</a>'s novel <a href="../../../t/h/i/This_Present_Darkness_6d0b.html" title="This Present Darkness">This Present Darkness</a> (and others in the series). The "fight" that Luce promotes is against personal sin and immorality, and in actively avoiding placing oneself in positions of temptation. The "weapons" that Luce speaks of are spiritual tools that provide teens with means to resist their temptations, and to help their friends to resist as well.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Luce explains that some cultural icons (such as <i><a href="../../../m/t/v/MTV_b498.html" title="MTV">MTV</a></i>, prom night, etc.) tend to promote and encourage immorality (and illegal activity) among young people (eg: underage drinking, drug use, rampant sexual activity, "date rape", etc.), and that young people are being desensitized by non-stop imagery and immoral role models provided in the media. The "action" is in the teen's personal lives, as they engage in prayer and ministry to each other, to overcome their temptations, and to live Christlike Godly lives. The plan is to "stir up some trouble for the devil (demonic forces)" by forming and growing active networked Christian youth groups, to the point where the majority of teens are striving to live Godly lives, rather than living enslaved in immorality and despair. These teens want to be freed from the bondage of sin. That is "the action". Did you look up what <i>R.I.O.T.</i> stood for - or just assume it meant something bad?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The sad fact is most youth groups now are pretty boring - averaging 12 members and a leader or two, sitting in a circle singing "Kumbaya" or something. Todays teens want something a little more loud and interesting - something that can "compete" with <i>MTV</i>, the Internet, and other audio visual media. The Battle Cry goal is to establish 100,000 networked youth groups, with 300+ members each, for 30+ million teens committed to living Godly lives. That is a lot of work to do, and that is what Battle Cry is working to achieve. Even though Battle Cry itself is a relatively new manifestation of an old principle, the <a href="../../../t/e/e/Teen_Mania_6667.html" title="Teen Mania">Teen Mania</a> <a href="../../../a/c/q/Acquire_the_Fire_8059.html" title="Acquire the Fire">Acquire the Fire</a> ministry activities and medium-large venue youth rallys have been around for some 20 years, and have been hosting similar large venue Christian youth rallys (such as the 1999 national "Day One" giant youth rally held in Detroit at the <a href="../../../p/o/n/Pontiac_Silverdome_1ce0.html" title="Pontiac Silverdome">Pontiac Silverdome</a> shortly after the <a href="../../../c/o/l/Columbine_high_school_massacre.html" title="Columbine high school massacre">Columbine high school massacre</a>). It is understandably difficult to imagine (unless you have personally seen it) how dynamic and inspirational a room full of 300+ screaming teenagers can be, much less a stadium full of 30,000+, when they are "getting crazy" for God. Anyway it is a lot of work to do, and it is what Battle Cry is working to achieve.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It would seem to be rather shallow and paranoid to assume concern that, because there's no <i>verified</i> track record of violence, and no <i>public</i> advocacy of violence, then there might or must be some kind of covert, surreptitious, underground hidden agenda or "weapon" being "forged" by Luce in preparation for "militant" youth violence or some other dreadful thing. Posting curious little conditionally toned phrases like "...does not <i>publicly</i> condone violence" and "There's no <i>verified</i> track record of violence" clearly implies (and readers are supposed to infer) that something must be going on covertly on the inside that we on the outside are not allowed to know about. That is an old <a href="../../../y/e/l/Yellow_journalism.html" title="Yellow journalism">yellow journalism</a> trick, quietly planting a seed of doubt, in order to make a subliminal point in the minds of the readers. And although there will certainly be some disagreement as to the Luce's methods and his Christian message, it is still permissible (and encouraged) in the context of freedom of speech and religion. In any case, thank you very much for creating the Ron Luce -related articles, I enjoyed contributing my personal knowlege on these subjects, and providing clarifications and reference links, and now defending the man and the organization - which is easy: there is simply nothing going on that needs to be defended, that's why there is no "evidence" of anything going on. Again, Battle Cry is simply the latest "banner" youth rally manifestation of the 20-year ongoing message of the Teen Mania / Acquire The Fire youth ministry program, re-tailored and repackaged for the current generation of teens. Oh and by the way - Acquire The Fire does <i>NOT</i> mean set fire to things either. It means "get on fire for God", but I am too tired to have to explain that right now. --<a href="../../../t/-/d/User%7ET-dot_4520.html" title="User:T-dot">T-dot</a> 04:47, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>OK. Too early to say where this movement is going. The combination of certainty of rightousness, organization for group action, and the trappings of fanaticism is troubling. Historically, that's a bad combination. --<a href="../../../n/a/g/User%7ENagle_f5e2.html" title="User:Nagle">John Nagle</a> 06:03, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>A couple of brief notes. First, on terminology. Calling Battle Cry an 'organization' is inaccurate; it's just the extension of Teen Mania's ongoing activities. Their terminology, more accurate I think, is that of "project" or "initiative," or "coalition" if referring to the involvement of other high-profile personalities and organizations.</p>
<p>Second, regarding T-dot's defense of "<a href="../../../s/p/i/Spiritual_warfare.html" title="Spiritual warfare">spiritual warfare</a>" and its relevance to Teen Mania's current activities. It would be one thing if what Ron Luce was saying could be exclusively viewed in that context; that is no longer possible. He has now gone on record during the stadium events (San Francisco and Detroit) as advocating that young people get involved in the so-called "<a href="../../../c/u/l/Culture_war.html" title="Culture war">culture war</a>" and at that point the effects are far beyond the "spiritual." Teen Mania advocates both the spiritual and the social-political conflict, but to my ear most of what's being said by Luce right now ultimately has little to do with the spiritual aspect.</p>
<p>Likewise with regard to the advocacy of violence, or not. There is a torrent of symbiology and language in Teen Mania's events - perhaps most notably, the entire staged firefight scene at the finale of the '04-'05 season ATF - that in that case, is followed by the observation by the central character that the confict he's been dreaming about is somehow "real." It isn't "<a href="../../../y/e/l/Yellow_journalism.html" title="Yellow journalism">yellow journalism</a>" to observe and report that a call to action in the political and social sphere is being made with this torrent of images of actual war, with images of what are in real-life actual weapons and hardware, and a deliberate blurring between the real and these images of violence is being made. There is a reason why people are calling Teen Mania 'fascist' in some way, and it's the imagery, the flags, the attitude, and not to mention, the fact that in San Francisco Ron Luce made his pronouncement from the scene of a previous act of violence that was part of the same "<a href="../../../c/u/l/Culture_war.html" title="Culture war">culture war</a>" he's advocating participating in - the assassination of <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harvey_Milk_78a5.html" title="Harvey Milk">Harvey Milk</a>.</p>
<p>I've been observing Teen Mania for some years now, attended, for research purposes, a number of the "Acquire the Fire" and stadium events (including the one in Pontiac mentioned above) and am the co-creator of <a href="http://www.acquiretheevidence.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.acquiretheevidence.com/" rel="nofollow">acquiretheevidence.com</a> and, previously, <a href="http://www.barf.org/" class="external text" title="http://www.barf.org/" rel="nofollow">barf.org</a>. --<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike_Doughney_d438.html" title="User:Mike Doughney">Mike Doughney</a> 02:33, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>OK, well if <a href="../../../r/o/n/Ron_Luce_5f9c.html" title="Ron Luce">Ron Luce</a> and his various ministry outreach programs have such a horrifying and frightening PR image among outsiders, observers, and skeptics, apparently appearing to be militant neo-con neo-nazi militia types bent on conducting assassinations, and the destruction of freedom, liberty and justice in America, then that is another very serious problem that will have to be addressed at the ministry headquarters. T-dot has also been very closely connected and involved with Luce's and other similar Christian youth ministry outreach programs for 25+ years, and has not yet detected that particularly subtle and evil-within vibe. Admittedly the Programs tend to contain a lot of hype and bluster in conveying the message of personal holiness, just have not picked up on the plans for violent confrontations and overthrow yet. Must be a serious lack of the gift of discernment on my part. So - please feel free to Post Away! with slander, rumor, and gossip as you wish. Oh - here's another lead to chase down: we heard some of these "christians" say they actually drink the blood of a lamb that was sacrificed to pay for for all their evil deeds! They celebrate this during "<a href="../../../e/a/s/Easter.html" title="Easter">Easter</a>" of all things - instead of chasing bunnies and coloring eggs! Better dig into that one, real deep. --<a href="../../../t/-/d/User%7ET-dot_4520.html" title="User:T-dot">T-dot</a> 22:20, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>A little harsh on Mike there, aren't we? I think the main point here is that the symbolism employed by Battle Cry, combined with their goals tend to blur critical lines between a metaphorical army and an actual army in ways that are disturbing for the general public. Rile people up to think of themselves as soldiers enough and you may be surprised at the events that follow, ala Zimbardo. ^_~</dd>

<dd>How funny. Does anyone have a hymn book handy? I believe hymnals are full of violence and literal armies that are ready to fight till the death. Why not protest hymnals and songs that have been written decades and even centuries ago? What I see with the biased, left-wing media is fear from students and the young people in America. I asked my good pal Google about the San Francisco protest and the first page listed was titled: Battle Cry Christian Extremists... NBC's Today Show and CNN had nothing bad to say about the demonstrators and (yes this is a bit biased but) the Bill O'Reilly bashed the counterdemonstrators for being so hypocritical. But why worry when only "4% of America's teens are followers of Christ"? When I saw this, I couldn't help but feel sad for the country. How are we going to be tolerant to all people when even the most extremely "tolerant" activists bash minors because of their religion. Pathetic for the adults who did nothing in the 70's and 80's and pathetic for such tolerant groups. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../n/i/s/User%7ENissi_Kim_a53e.html" title="User:Nissi Kim">Nissi Kim</a> (<a href="../../../n/i/s/User_talk%7ENissi_Kim_20e2.html" title="User talk:Nissi Kim">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Nissi_Kim_5c7f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Nissi Kim">contribs</a>).</small></dd>

<dd>A lot of the points you bring up seem to be strawmen of the actual argument going on, Nissi. People find Battle Cry disturbing today because they are currently active and working under heavy military symbolism, which could encourage militant stances on issues involving Christianity. Hymns are depictions of battles which don't necessarily encourage people to be violent, nor are they an actual threat to societies. Now Hymns that encourage people to start wars against people for theology would be a different issue and could be construed as inciting hatred.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Also, the "bashing" against Battle Cry is not for being Christian, but for mixing militant symbolism with Evangelical Christian doctrine, which in itself can have unnerving consequences. As I said before, its an echo of what we learned from the experiments of Zimbardo: Get people riled up enough to think of themselves as armies and they'll actually act like an army, think like an army, become an army.</dd>

I'd say military metaphors used in sports is more scarier than someone attacking the "evils and Satans" in the world. The way I see it is the better teens act in my generation, the less problems they'll be in the future.

<p>Something is going on with Battle Cry and Xianz. Until the recent rallies, Battle Cry had their own forums. Then they relaunched their web site, linking to Xianz. Now they don't seem to be connected to Xianz. Meanwhile, Xianz now says they're "in beta". So I added a note that the link between Xianz and Battle Cry now seems unclear. --<a href="../../../n/a/g/User%7ENagle_f5e2.html" title="User:Nagle">John Nagle</a> 21:21, 12 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>There was no mention of xianz at the two Battle Cry events thus far, nor have I seen any mention of it in any other Teen Mania materials in the past, included printed materials such as the event program/"manual" - if it was there, I certainly missed it - and there is none now. The only thing being promoted as an online service by Teen Mania now is battlecry.com, including a full-blown live demo of the site on stage during the finale of the stadium events. Edited the entry to delete reference to Xianz and repoint the link. --<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike_Doughney_d438.html" title="User:Mike Doughney">Mike Doughney</a> 03:09, 16 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That makes sense. Xianz, the site, has very little information about who's behind it. Even their "terms" page doesn't say. But the domain is registered to the CEO of Praize, Inc, which runs <a href="http://www.praize.com" class="external text" title="http://www.praize.com" rel="nofollow">Praize.com</a>, a search/IM/blog/forum site with a Christian orientation run out of Canada. If you have a Praize account, you can get an Xianz account. So they're probably connected. Xianz itself is back in "beta" until late May, limiting new accounts until the system is ready. --<a href="../../../n/a/g/User%7ENagle_f5e2.html" title="User:Nagle">John Nagle</a> 19:10, 16 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Xianz, incidentally, has a multi-level-marketing aspect. You have to be "invited", and who invited you is a piece of public information. So members have a "downline", the subtree of all the people they've recruited. Unclear what this info is for. Xianz also runs banner ads for something called <a href="http://www.maximumsuccess.com" class="external text" title="http://www.maximumsuccess.com" rel="nofollow">Maximum Success</a>, which is some kind of Christian make-money-fast scheme. --<a href="../../../n/a/g/User%7ENagle_f5e2.html" title="User:Nagle">John Nagle</a> 03:28, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Please review the Wikipedia's guidelines on <a href="../../../p/l/e/Wikipedia%7EPlease_do_not_bite_the_newcomers_ec77.html" title="Wikipedia:Please do not bite the newcomers">not biting the newcomers</a>. On the other hand, the User may not be as new as you think: WorldChanger may well be a <a href="../../../s/o/c/Sockpuppet.html" title="Sockpuppet">sockpuppet</a> of another user, but there is nothing inherently wrong with that. Many users use sockpuppets to compartmentalize their edits. That is completely acceptable, and certainly encouraged by the Wikipedia to help protect the privacy of the User. Anyway it seems you may have become a little too close to "owning" the article, refusing to allow other "new" editors a chance to contribute their thoughts and views. You probably should go back and review the <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a> guidelines yourself, and tone down your own approach, and reconsider some of your own edits, which still have the tone of a "hostile" reporter going after "exposing" a secret paramilitary cult in order to sell a story, rather than simply stating what the Organization is all about. There is nothing wrong with stating the Battle Cry's views, directly and unfiltered through your dark glasses of suspicion, even if those tenents offend your personal sensibilities. Sometimes when older editors have been "around" for a while, we get a little cranky about "these young whippersnappers" coming in and ruining everything. When you have to resort to blanket reversions, without really trying hard to pick out some "good" from the "bad", then you have crossed the line.

<dd>True, a total reversion may have been overdoing it. But the article doesn't reflect the "anti-Battle Cry position". For that, see <a href="http://www.acquiretheevidence.com" class="external text" title="http://www.acquiretheevidence.com" rel="nofollow">acquiretheevidence.com</a> (with which I have no connection), which is much more critical than anything currently in the article.

<dl>
<dd>OK. Made a few changes starting from there, mainly because Battle Cry's activities seem focused on growing Battle Cry, not general evangelism. It's more about "Come to Battle Cry", than "Come to Jesus", or so their literature indicates. By the way, where did that "double the size of every group every year" line come from? I haven't seen that one. --<a href="../../../n/a/g/User%7ENagle_f5e2.html" title="User:Nagle">John Nagle</a> 02:37, 5 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Actually, John, I think you're misinterpreting the systemic role of what "BattleCry" and Ron Luce have been doing for a long time. The promotional materials are written based on certain assumptions about church growth and the role of parachurch ministries like this one that are taken as givens in the evangelical community. This is about, at its root, growing and perpetuating churches, which is symbiotic with a political agenda, and then, since churches look for means to continue, support methods, events, etc., church leaders support and pipe participants into Teen Mania/"BattleCry" and back out. I would actually put it back to the way WorldChanger had it, but dejargonify the evangelism terminology. The "double the size of every youth group every year" - I recall three more words, "for five years" - is in "BattleCry" promotional and other materials, including recent books, and it's certainly a big part of the events, but I don't have a cite at hand right this second. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike_Doughney_d438.html" title="User:Mike Doughney">Mike Doughney</a> 04:30, 5 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I understand your point. For Wikipedia's purposes, it seems appropriate to describe verifiable statements and actions in plain language whenever possible. I tend to do that to Wikipedia articles, independent of topic. (Usually, it's the business articles that need major point of view work.) Really, though, probably all that can be usefully said about Battle Cry has been said for now, until they do something more. They're a very new organization. I'd encourage WorldChanger (<a href="../../../w/o/r/User_talk%7EWorldChanger_694f.html" title="User talk:WorldChanger">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_WorldChanger_4d9e.html" title="Special:Contributions/WorldChanger">contribs</a>) to work on some other articles outside this area for a while, to get some sense of the flavor of Wikipedia articles. --<a href="../../../n/a/g/User%7ENagle_f5e2.html" title="User:Nagle">John Nagle</a> 04:56, 5 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I think perhaps the best course of action here is to let those Users who have direct familiarity, and a positive insider-perspective with the positions and statements of Battle Cry organization, to freely and clearly represent and state those positions, and to do so unmolested by outsiders and critics. There should be "proof" links back to the Battle Cry and Teen Mania Ministries web sites, directly quoting excerpts from the PR information, exactly as stated and posted by Battle Cry. It should be presented as Official Battle Cry Positions - not the POV of the User posting it. If there are additional materials in pamphlets, then those should be quoted as such with published source information, like any published book would be quoted. Presumably others can get such materials from Battle Cry on request, or from participants in the meetings, or at the rallies from Press Kits, for verification. These "official positions" (which cannot be disputed as POV because they are direct quotes) can then be "balanced" by a separate "Criticisms" section, posted by those critics and outsiders who wish to point out any discrepancies or disputes or concerns with the official Battle Cry positions. I think it is outrageous and patently unfair for the "anti-Battle Cry" users to come in and manipulate and regulate <i>both sides</i> of the "argument", and make false claims and spread gossip, rumors, and speculation about what they feel Battle Cry stands for, when Battle Cry clearly and publically states what it stands for. It would be as if a staunch Christian were to come in and regulate and twist and make claims in the main article on what Buddhists believe, when there are plenty knowledgeable Buddhists experts who are much better able to present that information correctly. The Christians can then come in and state what THEY think about what Buddhists believe, in a separate "Criticisms of..." section, if they wish. Other non-christian religious wiki-articles have the religious jargon posted directly and freely, I do not see why Battle Cry and Christian Ministries in general cannot have the same courtesy. --<a href="../../../t/-/d/User%7ET-dot_4520.html" title="User:T-dot">T-dot</a> 16:41, 5 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Wikipedia is supposed to represent a neutral point of view, difficult though that is. The "presenting both sides separately" approach tends to break down when many people can edit the article. It's not a religious issue; <a href="../../../p/e/a/Peak_Oil_a7ee.html" title="Peak Oil">Peak Oil</a> is currently suffering from this problem. Also, here we're writing about a real-world organization, not a philosophical concept, so a who/what/when/where/why style works. It can be tough to write in specialized fields without jargon, but it's worth the trouble. I just got through editing <a href="../../../t/o/o/Tooling_University_b9d9.html" title="Tooling University">Tooling University</a>, which, in its original form, never mentioned what they actually taught: metalworking with machine tools. --<a href="../../../n/a/g/User%7ENagle_f5e2.html" title="User:Nagle">John Nagle</a> 16:57, 5 May 2006 (UTC)

And being that I'm on staff with Teen Mania, I happen to know what our organization is about and what our goals are extremely well... and ought to be able to state what they are without being so harshly scrutinized by people who aren't a part of the organization. Certainly things need to be presented from an unbiased perspective, and I understand that, but when it comes down to the goals and intents of the Battle Cry campaign, I think I know very well what they are.

<p>I saw a reference to "paintball" in the article, and looked for more info.</p>
<p>Teen Mania's "Extreme Camps" have facilities and training similar to basic military training:</p>
<p><i>"3 Paintball Fields, 3 300+ ft. Zip Lines, 50 ft. Climbing Tower".</i> <a href="http://www.extremecamps.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=home.show&amp;pageId=32" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.extremecamps.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=home.show&amp;pageId=32" rel="nofollow">[4]</a></p>
<p><i>The paintball course is situated in an area with various surrounding environments that allow the participant to have an exciting paintball experience.

We climbed cargo nets. We low crawled far too much. We waded through waist deep muddy water. We did all manner of physical exercises in ankle deep mud and water. We marched everywhere.

<dd>Excuse me?? Small unit tactics? I'm sorry, but using language that suggests or implies that Teen Mania or the Honor Academy teach some sort of combat tactics goes beyond just stretching the truth - that's outright ludicrous. It's one thing to play a paintball game; or to work together in a small team of people; or to choose to go through an event like ESOAL and have yourself pushed to your absolute limits physically, emotionally, mentally and spiritually. But paramilitary training is quite another thing. They aren't practicing their submachine gun skills in the back forty. No one's teaching them how to build bombs or blow up bridges or how to evade capture by an enemy. The purpose of events like ESOAL is to provide a voluntary opportunity for participants to stretch themselves and challenge their physical, mental, emotional and spiritual stamina... not to train them for physical warfare. You've far overstepped your bounds in what you suggest, and your malice for the organization is quite evident.</dd>

<dd><i>Paintball is a sport whose participants use markers to shoot paintballs (roughly marble-sized, .68 caliber, gelatin capsules filled with colored polyethylene glycol "paint") at other players.

<dd>The web site itself seems to use "BattleCry.com" and "Battle Cry Campaign". When they simply write "BattleCry", they're usually talking about their web site. --<a href="../../../n/a/g/User%7ENagle_f5e2.html" title="User:Nagle">John Nagle</a> 18:04, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've made a partial revert of the edits by <a href="../../../b/t/l/User%7EBtl_1f78.html" title="User:Btl">Btl</a> as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reference to specific bible passages is necessary to clarify how militaristic bible references are used by Teen Mania and the campaign. Removing the links to biblegateway.com removes the references to specific bible passages, particularly those for which there are citations as to their use in the campaign. If this edit was somehow meant to suggest that linking to a bible reference is somehow not supportive of a neutral POV, I doubt that there would be agreement on that, considering the content of these particular passages. Thus I've restored the links to biblegateway.com. If there is some other Wikipedia convention that recommends how the specific verses of the bible are to be referenced in articles perhaps the article should be changed to match that convention, while preserving the specific chapter/verse citations.</li>
<li>The item on the so-called "Christian alternative to MySpace" makes no sense without a reference to what that "alternative" is. I restored battlecry.com, but not as a link. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike_Doughney_d438.html" title="User:Mike Doughney">Mike Doughney</a> (<a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMike_Doughney_6fb6.html" title="User talk:Mike Doughney">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mike_Doughney_1c28.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mike Doughney">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<p>Battle Cry is having rallies again this year. The San Francisco event just finished. They tried a demonstration at City Hall again, but it was something of an anticlimax.<a href="http://origin.mercurynews.com/localnewsheadlines/ci_5406255" class="external autonumber" title="http://origin.mercurynews.com/localnewsheadlines/ci_5406255" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> I happened to be driving by City Hall during this, and some guy was yelling "George Bush loves you". Unclear what faction he represented.</p>
<p>Battle Cry is now reselling Tivo, with some censorware attached.<a href="http://battlecry.com/pages/KidsZone%20Redirect.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://battlecry.com/pages/KidsZone%20Redirect.php" rel="nofollow">[8]</a> "And if you purchase TiVo through Battlecry.com you’ll actually be supporting the work of Teen Mania! A portion of every sale will be returned to the ministry to further our work with teens. How’s that for a WIN-WIN?" <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../n/a/g/User%7ENagle_f5e2.html" title="User:Nagle">Nagle</a> (<a href="../../../n/a/g/User_talk%7ENagle_c56f.html" title="User talk:Nagle">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Nagle_40e6.html" title="Special:Contributions/Nagle">contribs</a>) 04:14, 12 March 2007 (UTC).</small></p>

<dd>Hey John, you shoulda stopped by and said hi. There's not much I can add about the City Hall scene, but there was a Vice President of TIVO on stage at the stadium Saturday night, wedged in between members of a Phoenix church youth group that hassled Spencer's Gifts for carrying the so-called "Pornaments" Christmas novelties, and the producers of the upcoming movie "Bella," which is being touted as some kind of anti-abortion/evangelism tool. They spent an enormous amount of time complaining about relative trivialities: clay figures from China and the images on screens. There are now plenty more interesting details to add to this article, eventually. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike_Doughney_d438.html" title="User:Mike Doughney">Mike Doughney</a> 07:43, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
