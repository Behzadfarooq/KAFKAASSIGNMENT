<p>This is one of the most absurd articles I have ever red! I mean, how can the one who wrote the article possibly belive that an army over 80,000 Turks would even lose against 34,000 soliders. This is obiviously a fake source, it actually makes me laught. I have studied this battle for a long time, and I am going to fix it as fast as I am a 100% sure that I am writing the correct information!</p>
<dl>
<dd>1) numbers are sourced from good-class source</dd>
<dd>2) in article is 50 000 austrian soldiers, no 34 000 (it is infantry only)</dd>
<dd>3) Ottoman army was <b>suprised</b> in time of <b>river crossing</b></dd>
<dd>4) here was main ottoman army - do you want really argue seriously: <i>main army of <a href="../../../o/t/t/Ottoman_empire.html" title="Ottoman empire">ottoman empire</a> under personal command of sultan had 20000 man?</i>&#160;:o)</dd>

<p>I do have 100% reliable sources, and I´ve been reading lots of theories about this(and many other) battles. These numbres are incorrect. I do not write incorrect articles, and if I do, then all books and researchers are wrong,not me, since I get the information from them. And, you also need to describe which units that fought, it was mostly mercenaries, not Turks.</p>

<p>Hungarian name Zenta simply was not official historical name for this town in the time of this battle. Hungarian language was not official here before 1867, and in the time of the battle, town of Senta was still de jure part of Ottoman Empire and was mainly inhabited by Serbs. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPANONIAN_cecc.html" title="User:PANONIAN"><font color="blue"><b>PANONIAN</b></font></a> <a href="../../../p/a/n/User_talk%7EPANONIAN_df46.html" title="User talk:PANONIAN"><font color="purple"><b>(talk)</b></font></a> 19:48, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>With google hits? Are you serious? What can google prove? Before the Treaty of Karlovci in 1699, Senta was de jure part of Ottoman Empire, and was mainly inhabited by Serbs who used name Senta (read for example dr Dušan J. Popvić, Srbi u Vojvodini, Novi Sad, 1990.). Do you have one single reason why we should use Hungarian name here? <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPANONIAN_cecc.html" title="User:PANONIAN"><font color="blue"><b>PANONIAN</b></font></a> <a href="../../../p/a/n/User_talk%7EPANONIAN_df46.html" title="User talk:PANONIAN"><font color="purple"><b>(talk)</b></font></a> 23:44, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>So, here are reasons why we should use name Senta:</p>
<ul>
<li>1. It was name used by majority of its population in the time of the battle.</li>
<li>2. The town in that time belonged to Ottoman Empire and that empire usually officially used for the places same names as they were used by local inhabitants.</li>
<li>3. It is also a current official name of this town.</li>
<li>4. Name Senta is most often used for this town in English.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now please tell me any specific reason why name Zenta should be used? I would suggest that you use this talk page before your next revert. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPANONIAN_cecc.html" title="User:PANONIAN"><font color="blue"><b>PANONIAN</b></font></a> <a href="../../../p/a/n/User_talk%7EPANONIAN_df46.html" title="User talk:PANONIAN"><font color="purple"><b>(talk)</b></font></a> 00:54, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>If the Britannica (and 100 more sources <a href="http://www.historycentral.com/WH1400-1900/Europe/Europe/BattleofZenta.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.historycentral.com/WH1400-1900/Europe/Europe/BattleofZenta.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>) accepts it, we can so <a href="http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9078325" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9078325" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. <span style="background: #fff0e0;"><font color="red">♥</font><font color="white">♥</font><font color="green">♥</font>:&#160;<a href="../../../g/u/b/User%7EGubbubu_93d7.html" title="User:Gubbubu"><font face="Lucida handwriting" color="green">Gubb</font></a>&#160; <font size="+1"><a href="../../../g/u/b/User_talk%7EGubbubu_3713.html" title="User talk:Gubbubu">✍</a></font> &#160;&#160;</span> <small><a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>. <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_6.html" title="July 6">July 6</a> 11:36 <a href="../../../c/e/s/CEST_318d.html" title="CEST">(CEST)</a></small> 11:36, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>That is not much of the argument. Britannica obviously used Hungarian source for its article where name was Zenta (If it used Serbian source, it certainly would have name Senta). The question is which of the two names is historical and which is not. Do you have answer to it? <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPANONIAN_cecc.html" title="User:PANONIAN"><font color="blue"><b>PANONIAN</b></font></a> <a href="../../../p/a/n/User_talk%7EPANONIAN_df46.html" title="User talk:PANONIAN"><font color="purple"><b>(talk)</b></font></a> 12:09, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>De facto there was a no man's land and battlefield, and there were four houses (what houses just dugouts) in five rows.</p>
<p>You must tell these arguments to the editors of <a href="../../../b/r/i/Britannica.html" title="Britannica">Britannica</a> and Wikipedia too, and they will immediatly change several thousands of articles.</p>
<p><i>Battles</i> Austerlitz to Slavkov, Eylau to Bagrationovsk, Weissenstein to Paide, Kokenhausen to Koknese, Kircholm to Salaspils, Port Arthur to Lü-shun, Chocim to Hotin, Liegnitz to Legnica, Iwo Jima to Io-jima and Little Bighorn to I don't know etc.</p>
<p><i>Treaties</i> Karlowitz to Sremski Karlovci, Passarowitz to Požarevac, Pressburg to Bratislava, Nystad to Uusikaupunki, Tilsit to Sovetsk etc.</p>

<dd>Names of some of the articles you mentioned should be also changed, but that is not our subject. You still did not proved that Zenta was historical name used for this town in the time of this battle. I am waiting for such proof from you. Tell me also why you removed from the article categories "History of Vojvodina" and "History of Serbia"? Also if it was "no man's land" as you claim, then why you insist that it was "Hungarian land" by posting Hungarian name here? It was battle between Austrians and Ottomans, so maybe we can post German or Turkish name for it. But how interesting, the German name for the town is also Senta, as you can see here: <a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liste_der_Orte_der_Vojvodina#Gemeinde_Senta" class="external free" title="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liste_der_Orte_der_Vojvodina#Gemeinde_Senta" rel="nofollow">http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liste_der_Orte_der_Vojvodina#Gemeinde_Senta</a> Regarding Britannica, there are many other errors in that encyclopaedia, so the title used there is not relevant. Can you tell me please just one reason why you consider name Zenta historical here? Just one single reason? Can you? <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPANONIAN_cecc.html" title="User:PANONIAN"><font color="blue"><b>PANONIAN</b></font></a> <a href="../../../p/a/n/User_talk%7EPANONIAN_df46.html" title="User talk:PANONIAN"><font color="purple"><b>(talk)</b></font></a> 14:00, 6 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Just one more note: the term "historical name" means that this name was used in time to which historical article refer. For example, I do not object that article about <a href="../../../b/%C3%A1/c/B%C3%A1cs-Bodrog_f248.html" title="Bács-Bodrog">Bács-Bodrog</a> county have Hungarian name, because Hungarian was official language in that time, but we speak here about year 1697 when things were very different. If you want to impose here one name only because this name come from your mother language and because you like this name more than another, with claim that this name is "historical", but if you cannot explain why you consider this name historical, then about what we talk here really? <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPANONIAN_cecc.html" title="User:PANONIAN"><font color="blue"><b>PANONIAN</b></font></a> <a href="../../../p/a/n/User_talk%7EPANONIAN_df46.html" title="User talk:PANONIAN"><font color="purple"><b>(talk)</b></font></a> 16:23, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>No, no, no, no Panonian. Did you mean Battle+of+Senta Berger? And when you see inside you found mainly chess sides with .yu domain. And these are Yahoo hits. And Senta is a name. Do not exert yourself. I think my opinion is proved with Google search in these languages:</p>
<p>Russian-Битва при Зенте (completely or mainly)</p>
<p>Swedish-Slaget vid Zenta (completely or mainly)</p>
<p>Danish-Slaget ved Zenta (completely or mainly)</p>
<p>French-Bataille de Zenta (completely or mainly)</p>
<p>Portuguese-Batalha de Zenta (completely or mainly)</p>
<p>Spanish-Batalla de Zenta (completely or mainly)</p>
<p>Italian-Battaglia di Zenta (completely or mainly)</p>
<p>Dutch-Slag bij Zenta (completely or mainly)</p>
<p>Polish-Bitwa pod Zenta (completely or mainly)</p>

<dd>What ever, what I already told you is that google hits are not relevant for the discussion. Would you finally explain why you consider name Zenta historical? <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPANONIAN_cecc.html" title="User:PANONIAN"><font color="blue"><b>PANONIAN</b></font></a> <a href="../../../p/a/n/User_talk%7EPANONIAN_df46.html" title="User talk:PANONIAN"><font color="purple"><b>(talk)</b></font></a> 00:15, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Let say like this: if one source (we can name it source A) write something wrong, and if many other sources take this wrong information from source A, we would have many sources with wrong information. But what then happens? Somebody realize that there was a wrong information and correct it, so the new source (we can name it source Z) have correct information. You see the difference between quality and quantity? It is not important how many sources use one information, but whether that information is correct or not. I presented on this page why name senta is historically more correct, while you only insist on the quantity of the sources. I suggest that you try to explain historical relevance of the name Zenta for this article. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPANONIAN_cecc.html" title="User:PANONIAN"><font color="blue"><b>PANONIAN</b></font></a> <a href="../../../p/a/n/User_talk%7EPANONIAN_df46.html" title="User talk:PANONIAN"><font color="purple"><b>(talk)</b></font></a> 00:30, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Please protest at the USA government why they use illegally the term <b>America</b>. In 1492 Cristopher Columbus didn't discover America but India or let us say New World. On that score the legal and right name will be <i>United States of India</i> or <i>United States of New World</i>.</dd>

<p>The source of this "wrongfulness" is probably <a href="http://lazarus.elte.hu/hun/maps/lazar150.jpg" class="external text" title="http://lazarus.elte.hu/hun/maps/lazar150.jpg" rel="nofollow">here</a>. In the Middle Ages the historians had one or two maps and one source. And they didn't know for your claims. If they knew for your claims it would be probably Senta.They knew nothing about significant Serb population in these four dugouts.Sorry.</p>
<p>And the first writer of the article is a guy from Brazil and not Hungarian. Let's revert again. Luftburger 11:17, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>First of all: WATCH WHAT YOU REVERT, PLEASE!!!. If you do not agree with name, then do not revert my other edits, and do not remove categories that I added, ok? Second, we do not talk about America. Third, maybe there was only 4 houses, but it is about 30-40 people that lived in them. Today you have the village of Obornjača in Bačka Topola municipality populated with only two persons, both of them ethnic Hungarians, so it is listed here as a place with Hungarian majority: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarians_in_Vojvodina#Settlements_with_Hungarian_majority" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarians_in_Vojvodina#Settlements_with_Hungarian_majority" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarians_in_Vojvodina#Settlements_with_Hungarian_majority</a> Also, I explained that Senta is also German name, and since you do not like much Serbian names, we can use German one because the area was de facto controled by Austria where German was official language. And I bored myself with this already, but I will ask you again to explain historical relevance of the name Zenta. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPANONIAN_cecc.html" title="User:PANONIAN"><font color="blue"><b>PANONIAN</b></font></a> <a href="../../../p/a/n/User_talk%7EPANONIAN_df46.html" title="User talk:PANONIAN"><font color="purple"><b>(talk)</b></font></a> 15:16, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I propose you to see <a href="http://lazarus.elte.hu/hun/maps/lazar150.jpg" class="external text" title="http://lazarus.elte.hu/hun/maps/lazar150.jpg" rel="nofollow">this map</a> from 1528 but what you don't want to see, you will not see it. If you see the map you will see mainly German toponyms.Let's play with these toponyms.</p>
<p>Zolnok (on map) - Sollnock (in German nowadays) - Szolnok</p>
<p>Segedein - Szegedin or Segedin - Szeged</p>
<p>Zenta -Senta - Senta</p>
<p>Eseck -Essegg or Esseg - Osijek</p>
<p>Grichisch Weissenburg -Belgrad -Beograd</p>
<p>Debretin -Debreczin -Debrecen</p>
<p>And what we see? German toponyms were modified between these dates. Your lack of elasticity is amazing and amusing for me.Luftburger 22:25, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Of course that they were modified, but the important thing is what name was used in the time of the battle, not in 1528, and that name would be the one that Germans hear from local Serbs. And did I told you not to remove categories?

<dd>Yes, I saw too another map where name Zenta is used, but that still do not solve the problem. Since both names, Zenta and Senta, are historical names (both were used in that time), then we still should use name Senta because the town is better known under this name. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPANONIAN_cecc.html" title="User:PANONIAN"><font color="blue"><b>PANONIAN</b></font></a> <a href="../../../p/a/n/User_talk%7EPANONIAN_df46.html" title="User talk:PANONIAN"><font color="purple"><b>(talk)</b></font></a> 22:23, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Really? I know it only as Zenta. I newer heard Senta, I newer saw Senta (If this battle was not, I did not know this small town to exist). Where is Senta better known? In czech not. In english? May be, I don't know, but battle is better known as Battle of Zenta - after all: it is historical events and was named in history, not today. <a href="../../../c/i/n/User%7ECinik_ff8f.html" title="User:Cinik">Cinik</a> 02:53, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The town is better known under name Senta in English of course (this is English Wikipedia, right?).

<dd>Wrong, Austrian emperor treated lands that he conquered as the "new-conquered lands" not as Hungary or anything like that. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPANONIAN_cecc.html" title="User:PANONIAN"><font color="blue"><b>PANONIAN</b></font></a> <a href="../../../p/a/n/User_talk%7EPANONIAN_df46.html" title="User talk:PANONIAN"><font color="purple"><b>(talk)</b></font></a> 22:48, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>And one more thing: in the time of the battle, the area still officialy belonged to the Ottoman Empire, so the territories about what we talk here were officially OTTOMAN territories in the time of the battle (and in the time of the treaty as well), i.e. they were vilayets and the later Habsburg provinces existed officially only after the peace treaty was signed in 1699. In another words, sultan Mustafa II ceded his vilayets to Habsburgs. He did not ceded Hungary because it was not Hungary - it were vilayets. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPANONIAN_cecc.html" title="User:PANONIAN"><font color="blue"><b>PANONIAN</b></font></a> <a href="../../../p/a/n/User_talk%7EPANONIAN_df46.html" title="User talk:PANONIAN"><font color="purple"><b>(talk)</b></font></a> 00:21, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
