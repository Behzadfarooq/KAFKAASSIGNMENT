<p>Firstly, Zhuge Liang decided that fire was the best way to destroy Cao Cao's fleet. Secondly, what Cao Cao says does matter.

<dd>Cao Cao's arrogance has no place in the infobox. The number, however, can stay. Zhuge Liang suggested fire...ONLY in the Romance of the Three Kingdoms, he did close to nothing in actual history except persuading Sun Quan to resist Cao Cao.

<p>We can talk here, that's what this page is for. Here is my case from reading <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sanguo_Zhi_2fa4.html" title="Sanguo Zhi">Sanguo Zhi</a>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Zhuge Liang was not the commander for Sun Quan's fleet.</li>
<li>Zhuge Liang's only historical role in Chibi was convincing Sun Quan not to surrender to Cao Cao, and ally with Liu Bei instead.</li>
<li>Zhuge Liang was not the commander for Liu Bei's small ambush army in Wulin, Liu Bei was.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you can prove me wrong using reliable sources (as in not anything derived from RoTK), I'm happy to let the page stay this way. <a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeadkid_dk_3237.html" title="User:Deadkid dk">deadkid_dk</a> 05:14, 23 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>Yes, but our conversations are limited here</p>
<ol>
<li>Zhuge Liang suggested the use of fire rafts against Cao Cao's fleet</li>
<li>Zhuge Liang also suggested using Pang Tong as a mole</li>
</ol>
<p>Furthermore, Sanguo Zhi was the groundwork for the Romance of the Three Kingdoms, so material found in RoTK has some credibility, unless you would question the credibility of your own sources.</p>
<p>But seriously, tell me if you have IM or something along those lines, as this isn't the best way for us to communicate. - Anon <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 69.213.185.157 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_69.213.185.157_93a5.html" title="Special:Contributions/69.213.185.157">contribs</a>) 06:24, 23 April 2006 (UTC)</small></p>

<dd>I don't feel comfortable giving you my IM. You can talk on my talk page if you don't like talking here.</dd>
<dd>And I'd like to point out neither of those happened. Pang Tong was not even in the battle.</dd>
<dd>Putting those aside, <b>even if</b> Zhuge Liang did suggest the use of fire and put Pang Tong into Cao Cao's forces, that does not make him commander, as he did not <b>commmand</b> any troops to do anything.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>RoTK was based on Sanguo Zhi, yes. But Sanguo Zhi is accepted to be a historical record, while RoTK is nothing more than fiction. While RoTK contains some facts, it should not be considered a historical source. Much like you wouldn't consider the film <i>Titanic</i> as history, though it's based on the real sinking ship.</dd>

<p>You know that if you dont wish to talk to me on an IM service, you could merely block me or simply tell me. I am very reasonable.</p>
<p>And I never said that Pang Tong participated in the battle. Zhuge Liang suggested that he act as a defector to Cao Cao's forces. It was Pang Tong's idea to chain Cao Cao's fleet together. Furthermore, Zhuge Liang did control a less-than-sizeable division of Shu marines. -Anon <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 69.213.185.157 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_69.213.185.157_93a5.html" title="Special:Contributions/69.213.185.157">contribs</a>) 16:41, 23 April 2006 (UTC)</small></p>

<dd>And told you I did.</dd>
<dd>You missed my point. I'm saying Pang Tong did no such thing, he wasn't even there. Cao Cao decided to chain the ships himself.</dd>
<dd>If we're supposed to list everyone who commanded a less-than-sizeable troop we'll have to bust that infobox.

<hr />
<p>well, if you want to be difficult ... Sorry, but thats just not something Cao Cao would do. His tactics were more along the lines of a massive overrun and limber battle formations, so he wouldn't chain his ships together without some huckster there to tell him to do so. And the whole army of Shu was commanded by Zhuge Liang. Even though Shu and Wu were two allied forces, they flew different standards, camped in different areas, utilized different tactics, et cetera. Besides, I wouldnt dream of listing every officers, as there were probably several thousand, but Zhou Yu was not Field Marshal of the allied Wu-Shu (get it?) forces and all generals deserve a mention. - Anon <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 69.213.185.157 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_69.213.185.157_93a5.html" title="Special:Contributions/69.213.185.157">contribs</a>) 02:08, 24 April 2006 (UTC)</small></p>

<dd>Check Sanguo Zhi if you don't believe me. I was trying to show, with common sense, what Cao Cao would do. And Zhuge Liang did control a Shu force, which was not garrisonned in Wulin.

<p>Okay, now that I think of it, who made Cao Cao chain his boats have no relevance to whether or not Zhuge Liang was a commander. Even if Zhuge Liang put Pang Tong into Cao Cao's forces, that wouldn't make him commander.</p>
<p>I was avoiding this, but now I think I have to provide you with the original sources in Chinese: Sanguo Zhi,</p>

From Chapter 32 (on Liu Bei)</p>
<pre>
先主遣諸葛亮自結於孫權，權遣周瑜、程普等水軍數萬，與先主並力，與曹公戰於赤壁，大破之，焚其舟船。
先主與吳軍水陸並進，追到南郡，時又疾疫，北軍多死，曹公引歸。
</pre>
<p>Here "Liu Bei sent Zhuge Liang to ask Sun Quan for assistance, and Sun sent Zhou Yu and Cheng Pu. Together with Liu Bei, they battled in Chibi and burnt his ships. Then <b>Liu Bei</b> and the Wu marines persued to Nanjun, when a plague affected the Cao Cao forces, so Cao Cao retreated." Note that it makes no makes no mention of Zhuge Liang's contributions in the battle, if he had any.</p>
<p><br />
From Chapter 35 (on Zhuge Liang)</p>
<pre>
權大悅，即遣周瑜、程普、魯肅等水軍三萬，隨亮詣先主，並力拒曹公。曹公敗於赤壁，引軍歸鄴。
</pre>
<p>Here "Sun Quan sent Zhou Yu, Cheng Pu, and Lu Su to follow Zhuge Liang to meet up with Liu Bei, and so together they defeated Cao Cao." Note that it does not state that Zhuge Liang participated in the battle, though this chapter is on Zhuge Liang.</p>
<p><br />
From Chapter 47 (on Sun Quan)</p>
<pre>
備進住夏口，使諸葛亮詣權，權遣同瑜、程普等行。是時曹公新得表眾，形勢甚盛。諸議者皆望風畏懼，多勸權迎之。
惟瑜、肅執拒之儀，意與權同。<b>瑜、普為左右督，各領萬人，與備俱近，</b>遇於赤壁，大破曹公軍。
公燒其餘船引退，士卒饑疫，死者大半。備、瑜等復追至南郡。曹公遂北還，留曹仁、徐晃於江陵，使樂進守襄陽
</pre>
<p>Here it says "Liu Bei sent Zhuge Liang to Sun Quan for help, so Sun Quan sent Zhou Yu and Cheng Pu. Many feared Cao Cao's forces but Zhou Yu and Lu Su resisted. <b>Zhou Yu and Cheng Pu, as left and right commander, each led ten thousand men and met with Liu Bei</b>. They met at Chibi and defeated Cao Cao. Cao Cao then burnt his remaining ships and retreated. Due to disease and famine, casualties were heavy. Liu Bei and Zhou Yu persued until Nanjun. Cao Cao fled back north, leaving Cao Ren and Xu Huang in Jiangling, Yue Jin in Xiangyang." Note no mention of Zhuge Liang in battle again, and Cheng Pu and Liu Bei, if anyone, should be listed in the commander box instead of Zhuge Liang.</p>
<p><br />
From Chapter 54 (on Zhou Yu)</p>
<pre>
時劉備為曹公所破，欲引南渡江。與魯肅遇於當陽，遂共圖計，因進住夏口，遣諸葛亮詣權。權遂遣瑜及程普等與備並力逆曹公，遇於赤壁。
時曹公軍眾已有疾病，初一交戰，公軍敗退，引次江北。瑜等在南岸。瑜部將黃蓋曰："今寇眾我寡，難與持久。然觀操軍船艦，首尾相接，可燒而走也。"
乃取蒙沖鬥艦數十艘，實以薪草，膏油灌其中。裹以帷幕，上建牙旗，先書報曹公，欺以欲降。又豫備走舸，各系大船後，因引次俱前。
曹公軍吏士皆延頸觀望，指言蓋降。蓋放諸船，同時發火。時風盛猛，悉延燒岸上營落。頃之。
煙炎張天，人馬燒溺死者甚眾，軍遂敗退，還保南郡。備與瑜等復共追。曹公留曹仁等守江陵城。逕自北歸。
</pre>
<p>"Liu Bei was defeated by Cao Cao [in Changban], and met with Lu Su in Danyang. Liu Bei sent Zhuge Liang to Sun Quan, and Sun sent Zhou Yu and Cheng Pu back to Liu Bei, and encountered Cao in Chibi. Cao Cao's forces were already affected by disease, and was initially defeated, so he led his forces on the north side of the river. Zhou Yu and the others were on the south side of the river. Zhou Yu's officer, Huang Gai said, "The enemy's numbers overwhelm us, and we can't last long. I see Cao Cao's ships linked together, we can burn his ships." And so Huang Gai pretended to surrender to Cao Cao, and once he got close, he set Cao Cao's ship on fire. The wind was fierce then, and soon the fire spread towards the encampment on the north shore. Many soldiers were burnt or drowned to death, and Cao Cao fled to Nanjun. Liu Bei and Zhou Yu pressed on. Cao Cao left Cao Ren in Jiangling and went back north himself." Again, no mention of Zhuge Liang being a commander of anything.</p>
<p><br />
From Chapter 55 (on Cheng Pu)</p>
<pre>
<b>與周瑜為左右督</b>，破曹公於烏林
</pre>
<p><b>With Zhou Yu, as left and right commander</b>, defeated Cao Cao at Wulin. Makes no reference to Zhuge Liang at all.</p>
<p><br />
I believe I had established my case that Zhuge Liang was not a commander in this battle at all, and that <b>Zhou Yu, Cheng Pu, and Liu Bei</b> should appear as commanders in the infobox. I would also like you to make my life easier by providing <b>actual proof from reliable sources</b> instead of pure speculation and "proofs" from works of fiction when you present your case. Thank you.</p>
<p>(p.s. Yes, most of the whole article is RoTK bogus. The Chinese Wikipedia does a more accurate job in presenting this battle.)</p>

<p>First, you're an uncredible and unimpressive translator. Second, I'm beginning to have serious questions about your blind loyalty to Sanguo Zhi, a piece that has been criticized almost as many times as ROTK. It is a biased chronicle composed so soon after the end of the Three Kingdoms Era that its contents may be mere memories of the author, instead of actual facts. Perhaps you should look at the objectivity of your sources more often. And sometimes, the greatest commanders are not the foremost. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 68.250.190.252 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_68.250.190.252_4a41.html" title="Special:Contributions/68.250.190.252">contribs</a>) 03:17, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</small></p>
<hr />
<p>I admit I did a half-assed job of translating the sources, because I didn't want to translate them in the first place. Now I'm assuming that you understand the Chinese, so you can read the original text for yourself and decide. If you don't know Chinese, you're in no position to say I'm uncredible and unimpressive.</p>
<p>Well sir, <b>at least Sanguo Zhi is not a blatant piece of fiction written a thousand years after the events happened</b>. And you tell me that Sanguo Zhi is biased...compared to what? RoTK? Try again.</p>
<p>In defence of Sanguo Zhi, it is officially included in the <a href="../../../t/w/e/Twenty-Four_Histories_13cb.html" title="Twenty-Four Histories">Twenty-Four Histories</a> of China, which is:</p>
<p>"...often considered <b>an authoritative source of traditional Chinese history and culture</b>, and is used for research on literature, art, music, science, military affairs, geography, ethnography and other subjects."</p>
<p>I have a very valid reason for my "blind loyalty" to Sanguo Zhi - I'm just trying to get this right. I'd like to ask you, however, to cease your blind loyalty to a dead Zhuge Liang whose abilities and contributions had been grossly exaggerated.</p>
<p><br />
The problem is, the infobox is not for identifying who contributed the most, or who was the greatest commander in the battle, it is for listing, like you said, who was the foremost.</p>
<p><br />
I'm tired of this, how would you like to solve this mess?</p>

<p>My ability to translate chinese has no bearing on your credibility and objectivity. Furthermore, I have no loyalties to ROTK or Zhuge Liang, I just want to see factual accuracy represented. However, I do wish for an expidited and peaceful resolution to this, so I would propose that this argument be suspended indefinitely until a third party (i.e. not you or me using another username) contributes their knowledge. Until then, the 'factual accuracy' sticker will suffice. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 69.95.86.73 (<a href="../../../6/9/2E/User_talk%7E69.95.86.73.html" title="User talk:69.95.86.73">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_69.95.86.73_2987.html" title="Special:Contributions/69.95.86.73">contribs</a>) 12:45, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</small></p>

You are just making the page harder to read. May I also ask that you not request to use IM to discuss this matter? This article is of interest to other people besides yourselves and should be discussed publicly on Wikipedia.

<p>I might get an account. I dont know chinese, but since you are a belligerent party, you are a biased translator. And whats wrong with me wanting a feasable conversation with someone? And how is unimpressive unconstructive? By the way, here are your tildes. 69.95.86.69 17:11, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Well... of the passages provided above, he pretty much did a word-for-word translation, so there's really little room for him to be biased. Of course, he didn't translate the whole SanGuoZhi, but I'm sure you can find a lot of English translations of it online yourself. I have some basic knowledge of Chinese, not enough to translate anything myself, but enough to detect blantant mistranslations. Also, SanGuoZhi is really the only thing you can go by here, because RoTK was intended to be, and is, a dramatic work of fiction, admitted to by the author himself. On the other hand, SanGuoZhi, while no doubt containing some unavoidable bias from the author, was intended to be, and is recognized as, a historical document, and is the only one that records the events of the time period with any amount of detail. 169.229.74.11 21:38, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Mr. 69.95.86.69, now you're just being unreasonable. Since you don't know Chinese, you have no right to assume that my translation is biased (when another annoymous user pointed out that I am not). Please, <a href="../../../g/f/_/WP%7EGF_4344.html" title="WP:GF">assume good faith</a>. Veyklevar already answered your question why you shouldn't ask for my IM: <i>This article is of interest to other people besides yourselves and should be discussed publicly on Wikipedia.</i> And calling someone's work unimpressive is <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">uncivil</a>, and being uncivil is being unconstructive.

<p>How am I unreasonable? Because you have one side in a bipartisanned argument, you can only be considered biased. I merely wanted to talk with you more quickly. 10 minutes on an IM conversations is about the equivalent of a month's worth of posts on a discussion page. But if you wish to discuss here, then that's fine with me. Furthermore, I apologize if you considered my comment rude; however because you can objectively translate chinese doesnt mean that you will translate it objectively and the mere ability to translate anything doesn't guarantee you any credibility. 69.218.226.195 15:47, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Again, please assume good faith, or at least give me the benefit of doubt when you read the translations. Still waiting for third opinion to come. <a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeadkid_dk_3237.html" title="User:Deadkid dk">deadkid_dk</a> 07:16, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I didn't give you any because there is no place to apply it on you: I've asked you for sources, you've provided none. Also, your question has nothing to do with the task at hand, which is to check on the factuality of Zhuge Liang being commander. <i>Please assume good faith</i> (this is the third time), and do not respond if you just wanted to lash back at me to defend yourself, not your point. <a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeadkid_dk_3237.html" title="User:Deadkid dk">deadkid_dk</a> 16:17, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I apologize, but I couldn't find my sources online; I do most of my research at libraries. I'm looking for online parallels, however. Furthermore, I find it difficult to assume good faith in you, as you've given me no reason to. Now, I think a suspension of this argument would be best. I will contain myself if you will do the same. 69.95.86.73 17:06, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Alas, I can't keep my word so now I'm talking again. Mind you, I want to suspend this arguement, but something must be done to that "Zhuge Liang" entry in the infobox so I can take that dispute sticker off. I'm not sure what, due to a lack of consensus, so I suggest we wait for that to come before we continue arguing with each other (not that I like to, nooooo). I did assume good faith, or else I would throw meaner things at you.

<p>Since I don't have the skill to translate SanGuoZhi myself, the following translated excerpts are from www.kongming.net. You can read them there yourself if you'd like, that they really have no reason to be biased. The following is from Zhuge Liangs biography:</p>
<p><i>"Zhuge Liang persuaded Sun Quan saying: “All domains within the seas are in turmoil. You, my general, have raised troops to occupy Jiangdong and Liu of Yuzhou [Liu Bei] has also gathered his followers south of the Han, contesting the Empire with Cao Cao. Today Cao Cao has pacified great disorders, establishing peace in most areas. He has conquered Jingzhou and his prestige resonates to the four seas. Yuzhou [Liu Bei] has fled to this place because his heroes haven’t had an opportunity to exercise their might. If you, my general, calculate that you can manage the situation with your power; if you can oppose the Middle Kingdom by rallying the host of Wu and Yue, then it would be best to break off relations with Cao Cao in advance. If you cannot oppose him, then it would be best to demobilise the troops, discard your armour and submit to the north. At present you are seemingly compliant on the exterior, yet making indecisive plans within. You take no action in this critical situation, on the very eve of disaster!” Sun Quan said: “If it is as you, sir, say, then why hasn’t Liu of Yuzhou submitted?” Zhuge Liang said: “He is as Tian Heng, the heroic warrior of Qi, who defended justice and refused to be dishonoured. Moreoever, Liu of Yuzhou is a descendant of the imperial clan and a hero of his generation. Followers go to him as the rivers go to the ocean. If he is unsuccessful, then it is for the will of Heaven. He can never be subordinate to Cao Cao.” Sun Quan was furious and said: “I cannot take all the lands of Wu, a host of one hundred thousand and offer it for the rule of others. I have made up my mind! Other than Liu of Yuzhou there is no one who can oppose Cao Cao. But Yuzhou was recently been defeated. Can he still combat this menace?” Zhuge Liang said: “Even though Yuzhou’s army was defeated at Changban, the dispersed soldiers who have returned, in addition to Guan Yu’s elite marines, number ten thousand. The soldiers of Jiangxia assembled under Liu Qi also number no less than ten thousand. The host of Cao Cao have travelled from afar, and are weary and improvised. I have heard that to pursue Yuzhou, light cavalry travelled more than three hundred miles in a day and a night. This is what was meant in the phrase ‘when the bolt of the powerful crossbow reached its target, it could not pierce even the thin silk of Lu.’ Hence The Art of War warned against such action: ‘in a forced march of fifty miles, the commander of the van will probably fall.’ Moreover, the men of the north are untrained in naval warfare. Also, even though the people of Jingzhou have given in to Cao Cao, they were coerced by force and have by no means genuinely submitted. Today you can truly command your fierce generals in leading tens of thousands of soldiers and working in full cooperation and unity of purpose with Yuzhou, Cao Cao’s army will surely fall. After Cao Cao’s army is defeated, he will surely return to the north, the strength of Jing and Wu will increase, and a tripartite will form. The time to decide triumph or fall is today.’ Sun Quan was greatly pleased, and subsequently sent Zhou Yu, Cheng Pu, Lu Su and others with marines numbering thirty thousand, accompanying Zhuge Liang to pay respects to the Former Lord and to join forces to oppose Duke Cao. Duke Cao was defeated at Red Cliffs, and led his army back to Ye. The Former Lord then absorbed Jiangnan and made Zhuge Liang Army Advisor General of the Gentlemen of the Household, superintending the three commandieries of Lingling, Guiyang and Changsha, and collecting local taxes for military purposes."</i></p>
<p><i>Zhuge Liang is credited with helping to persuade Sun Quan to fight Cao Cao, but no mention is made regarding any contribution he made for the actual battle. From Zhou Yu's bio:</i></p>
<p><i>"At that moment, Liu Bei was defeated by Cao Cao and he met Lu Su at Dang Yang. In the meeting, both devised plans for alliance against Cao Cao. Subsequently, Liu Bei stationed himself at Xia Kou. In addition, Liu Bei sent Zhuge Liang as an envoy to Sun Quan. Following that, Sun Quan dispatched Zhou Yu, Cheng Pu and other Wu generals to meet Liu Bei in order to consolidate their forces against Cao Cao’s army. The army of the Sun-Liu alliance engaged Cao Cao’s army at Chi Bi. During then, Cao Cao’s army was already having problems with many soldiers falling sick. As such, during the initial engagement, Cao Cao’s army was promptly defeated and retreated back to the northern shore of the river Yang Tze.</i></p>
<p><i>Seeing that Cao Cao’s army was numerous, Huang Gai felt that it would be difficult to resist them for long. However, he observed that Cao Cao’s ships were linked together and he suggested to Zhou Yu that it was actually possible to repel the enemies if they launched a fire attack at them. The suggestion was accepted and preparations were made for the fireboats (boats stuffed with inflammable materials). Subsequently, a letter was sent to Cao Cao falsely claiming that Huang Gai intended to surrender. The ruse was successful and the soldiers of Wei were anticipating the arrival of Huang Gai. At that moment, Huang Gai arrived and set his fireboats on fire. Aided by the strong winds and the fact that Cao Cao’s ships were chained together, the fire quickly spread throughout Cao Cao’s navy and even to the naval camps on the shore. Within moments, the raging inferno resulted in heavy casualties in Cao Cao’s army. Cao Cao was forced to retreat and defend Nan prefecture against the victorious allied armies. Meanwhile, Liu Bei and Zhou Yu led their troops in pursuit. Nevertheless, Cao Cao himself had returned to the north after leaving Cao Ren to guard the city of Jiang Ling."</i></p>
<p><i>Notice that Zhuge Liang was an envoy, diplomat. Not a commander. The commanders were Zhou Yu/Cheng Pu, as well as Liu Bei.</i></p>
<p><i>Also, I couldn't find anything non-RotK regarding Pang Tong and ChiBi. 169.229.74.11 07:29, 30 April 2006 (UTC)</i></p>
<p><i>There is very little factual evidence to suggest that Zhuge Liang was anything other than a diplomat at Red Cliffs. Outside of Romance of the Three Kingdoms, and other works of fiction and folklore, there is no historical proof that mentions him advising for the battle, commanding or serving as a millitary officer under either Liu Bei or Sun Quan during that time. The chaining of the ships should be seen as a tactical blunder by Cao Cao, rather than a ploy of either Zhuge Liang's or Pang Tong's. The fire ploy was also concieved by Sun Quan's officer Huang Gai, possibly with aid from Zhou Yu and others.</i></p>
<p><i>An interesting notion from the Sanguo Zhi (quoted from a previous comment by deadkid_dk):</i></p>
<p><i><br /></i></p>
<p><i>"Cao Cao then burnt his remaining ships and retreated."</i></p>
<p><i>According to the Sanguo Zhi, Cao Cao must not have lost his entire navy from the actions of the allies. Instead, we can assume that after recieving casulties and losses of ships, he decided to destroy his remaining fleet, possibly to stop them from falling into the hands of Liu Bei or Sun Quan. I never thought about his before, and it lessens the impact of the allied fire attack, suggesting that at least some of Cao Cao's ships were intentionally burnt by his own men.</i></p>

<p><i>As many of you know, the ROTK novel points out how things went accordingly from its own P.O.V. It is true that Zhuge Liang was around at the time, but I would hardly say he did any military action except provide the South Land Army with the South-East Wind and the Arrows. More or less, Zhuge Liang only stirrs Zhou Yu and Sun Quan into action rather then have them submit to Cao Cao. (All from the novel's P.O.V.)</i></p>
<p><i>Zhou Yu, on the other hand, he would have been willing to submit; however, if Zhuge Liang did not bring his wife into the matter then Chi Bi would have never existed. The only funny thing was is that Zhou Yu and Lu Su saw how easily the South Land was used to do the work of fighting against Cao Cao and sending his army back to Xu Chang. Thus, with that happening, Zhuge Liang would be able to expand Shu's border lines and gain Jing in the process. (Once again, from the novel but please correct me if I'm wrong.)</i></p>
<p><i>For those of you who have read the novel as I have, remember this: It is only being based on inaccurate events, but everything that happened I'm sure was real enough. Get back to ya about it later on.--<a href="../../../z/h/a/User%7EZhang_Liao_42eb.html" title="User:Zhang Liao">Zhang Liao</a> 22:59, 27 May 2006 (UTC)</i></p>
<p><i>Even from the novel it is quite apparent that Zhou Yu is teasing everyone by constantly flip-flopping his stance on war or peace. And in SGZ Zhou Yu was pretty much set on fighting from the start. 67.121.241.18 19:50, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</i></p>
<p><i><br />
I just wanted to add I've removed references to Wu and Shu since those Kingdoms came to exist after the battle and instead opted to refer to them as Sun and Liu, respectively. I didn't want to change it without discussion, but for consistency's sake, I think we should either refer to Cao Cao as Cao, or add full names for Sun Quan and Liu Bei. Otherwise it seems to be biased.</i></p>
