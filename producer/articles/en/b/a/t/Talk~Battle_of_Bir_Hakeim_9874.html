<p>First and to be honest, I am French, so I might be biaised and ignore it. I think it is weird to consider this battle an Axis victory considered they didn't reduce the place before the English could regroup, which was the objective. Secondly, the French could not be captured either, (except the wounded), so basically the Axis couldn't reach any of their objective (take the place on time to carry on pursuing the British, and capturing the FFL). It s hardly a "French victory" either, couldn't we have a middle ground&#160;? I want the opinion of other persons, if some people express against mine, I will be ok with this. BTW, I check the Battle of Cameron, and it is considered a Mexican victory, even though the two battles can be somehow compared in aftermath (the French held long enough).</p>

<dd>Hmm, a strategic victory but a tactical loss. I suggest taking this to <a href="../../../m/i/l/WP%7EMILHIST_2318.html" title="WP:MILHIST">WP:MILHIST</a> and seeing what the opinion there is. <a href="../../../o/b/e/User%7EOberiko_30df.html" title="User:Oberiko">Oberiko</a> 21:38, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Let me say&#160;: this is far from being an accettable historycal introduction to the Bir Hakeim episode. Any linking between Bir Hakeim and El Alamein is pure fiction. Should be written again by zero, explaining step by step&#160;: 1 - the existance of the Gazala - Bir Hakeim line, consisting mainly of British minefields 2 - so Rommel was running overnight into the desert, outflanking Bir Hakeim, his plan was to beat quickly the British troops entrenched back to the Gazala line 3 - Bir Hakeim was left simply warded by Italian troops (Trieste division? not sure), not encircled 4 - Italian troops were not so consistent and equipped to get Bir Hakeim, nor this was their target 5 - Italians had to suffer strong attacks from a British armoured brigade, fortunately they withdraw to North to join the main battle 6 - the first attack of Rommel to Britsh troops was a disaster,loosing 1/3 of his tanks, so he was reduced into the Caudron in short supply and the forgotten Bir Hakeim became a vital problem 7 - the problem was over when Italian division Brescia opened some clean ways into the minefields 8 - by this new supply line, Bir Hakeim was no longer a major problem 9 - Rommel won the Caudron battle BEFORE considering any new action against Bir Hakeim 10 - Bir Hakeim was finally taken after strong bombing by Stuka and arrival of new Italian division (Ariete?) 11 - Axis losses were strong in first Gazala battle, but only very few men and tanks were lost in Bir Hakeim, and mainly they were Italians, so considered not of primary level 12 - on the other side, many Stuka of Luftwaffe were lost on Bir Hakeim due to RAF and good ground antiaircraft defence Concluding: By numbers, hardly we can say there was a battle at Bir Hakeim, this was just a local fighting. Under any military point of view, the overal battle of Gazala was an Axis victory, while Bir Hakeim was a local and tactical Allied victory and the definition of "Axis pyrrhic victory" is total nonsense. More important, Bir Hakeim was the first moral victory for free French troops, making aware the world of their existance and succesfully fighting Axis troops. Most important, BBC emphasize the Bir Hakeim fighting and got a brilliant propaganda success for Allied, creating a new mood for French-British cooperation after the bad things happened in Mers-El-Kebir and Dakar.</p>
<p>Some remarkable notes. There were many Germans into the Legion, some of them (maybe wounded) were kept by Italians and released to Germans, by personal order of Rommel they were not shooted and treated as French. Africa was a gentlemen war. My father was in in Italian division Ariete and was one among the first entering Bir Hakeim. He and many others Italian were still believing that De Gaulle was in Bir Hakeim and he was taken away in hurry by an English airplane before the fall of the fortress. My father still swore to have found "the hot bed and hot lunch of the just escaped De Gaulle" in Bir Hakeim, diary and many papers originally written by him, these were delivered to Italian HQ.

<p>Previous comment was written straight off. Anyway it is correct and after a brief documentation, need some qualification only. Italian division Trieste was originally charged to cover Bir Hakeim, but during the night lose its way in the desert, colliding then with minefields in Gott El Ualeb, north of Bir Hakeim, just in front of the 150° armoured brigade. It is confirmed that taking Bir Hakeim was not in the Axis plan. General Bayerlein complained with Rommel for this decison, adding another uncertainty to an already too risky plan. In fact DAK (Deutsche Afrika Korp) was close to be defeated for this bad plan. During the outflanking, on May 26th overnight, division Ariete was the Axis corp passing closer to Bir Hakeim and was leaving some troops to mask the position. The major part of division Ariete joined the main battle in the Caudron. This part of Ariete masking Bir Hakeim was 30 tanks and two companies of Bersaglieri only. On May 27th, morning, they were attacked in Rugbet el Atasc by a tank group, most probably the 3rd Indian Mot. Brigade (have found the name of British Gen. Harry Filose). The Indian brigade was 10 times stronger than this small group of Ariete, anyway its attack was badly managed. The Italians lost 15 tanks, 30 killed and 40 wounded, one tenth of Indian losses, and captured many tanks, vehicles and 1000 prisoners. Then the Italians were only feeling the ground and testing the French in Bir Hakeim until June 2nd. The battle of Bir Hakeim started only on June 2nd, when division Trieste finally arrived. It is reported by some authors that Rommel sent a part of the 90th Light division to South for assaulting Bir Hakeim. On June 2nd the DAK had overpassed its shortage, by crushing the 150th brigade, keeeping Gott El Ualeb (the true SCHWERPUNKT of the battle), opening some supply corridors into the minfields, so was well furnished and entrenched. But it is unlikely that Rommel divested consistent German forces from the coming defensive battle of June 5-6 for sending them to Bir Hakeim. On June 2nd, with a total underevaluation of French willpower and defensive disposal, the Ariete and Trieste (have no evidence of Germans joining the assault) attacked Bir Hakeim, getting a severe kick and loosing 34 tanks, 4 deads and 87 prisoners. I have to amend my former statement "not of first quality": Ariete was at the top of Italian Army, one of the few corps estimated same level of German divisions 21st, 15th and 90th, at least by training and moral, not certainly by equipment. The further 5 days Bir Hakeim was heavy bombed by Stuka. The result was poor and many aicraft were lost (have no number). Incredible, but true, the French stated that German bombing was only "a lot of sand in the sky", but complained for RAF bombing them several times by mistake and inflicting serious damages. During the night from 10 to 11 June, the French troops retired with few losses. Aftermath now. The original plan of Rommel was first to outflank Bir Hakeim, go North and beat the British in 24 hours, so nothing else was needed, unfortunately after 3 days nothing was decided and DAK went short in water, oil and ammunition. As a secondary option, Italian engineers were charged to open the minefields at Gott El Ualeb. Key of the trouble for the DAK was German Intelligence, not knowing (as usual) that 150th brigade was deployed in Gott El Ualeb, just back the minefields and was in position to fire the Italian engineers of division Brescia and Pavia while they were working into the minefields. Without Bir Hakeim and without Gott El Ualeb, Rommel was much close to have to surrender. The turning point of the battle was the British Army staying inactive for 6 days while the Germans were distroying the 150th brigade. The resistance of free French men in Bir Hakeim was strategically valuable until June 2nd, even if they were partially neglected by Axis troops. After Germans destroyed the 150th brigade, got Gott El Ualeb and Italians broke the minefields, Bir Hakeim lost its importance and any the further resistance was not strategically needed. But the French were not ordered to retire until June 10th. The French victory of June 2nd is anyway much valuable for other reason: moral, ethical, propaganda. So the decision to retire on July 10th was totally correct. French Free Corp performed over any expectation at Bir Hakeim. Its resistance, although secondary to the battle of 150th at Gott El Ualeb, gave to British Army a full chance to destroy the DAK and the Ariete, so ending the war in Africa 1 year before El Alamein. It is much established that gen. Ritchie, in his HQ in Gambut, never appreciated correctly the situation and miss the bus by leaving inactive the British Army for 6 days. Note: I am talking of British Army (of Nile), as VIII Army has born only October 23, 1942. Any quote of this army before this date should be regarded as a mistake.
