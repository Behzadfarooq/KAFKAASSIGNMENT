<p>Ok, whoever wrote this article needs to clean it up. I am not saying that the Japanese did not commit the atrocities citied, on contrare, it fits the modus operandi of the era we are talking about. The main problems are that it is inconsistently written, largly from the 1st person (a major no-go for an encyclopedia) and what is there is unbelivably biased. Definitivky needs a looking over.

<ul>
<li><b>Battle of Chingshanli</b> is a POV title, since the battle was carried on between Koreans and Japanese. Especially when Koreans were victorious, shouldn't it be in Korean &amp; why should anybody want the title to be in Chinese? Isn't there a Japanese title for this battle also?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>Since they suffered from shortage of human resources and financial difficulties, they frequently crossed the border into Korea and raided people and officials who were mostly ethnic Koreans</i> seems a little off from facts that I know.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>All the sources are Japanese &amp; pre-1990. Japan did not do much to acknowledge what happened during their occupation of Korea until ~2000. Out of so many better and more recent sources, why on Earth are we relying on these old junks that other users in the US can't check upon?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>However, it has already been proved by primary sources that their claim is groundless propaganda.</i> is called <a href="../../../w/e/a/Weasel_words.html" title="Weasel words">weasel word usage</a>. This is against <a href="../../../n/p/o/Wikipedia%7ENPOV_7fb1.html" title="Wikipedia:NPOV">Wikipedia:NPOV</a> policy. <b>We don't use primary sources in Wikipedia</b>. See <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>South Koreans refer to this battle as the "great victory at Cheongsalli" and believe that it was a decisive victory of the self-claimed Independence Army</i> should be changed. The two sentences are repetitive &amp; it seems as if the editor who put this phrase wants to emphasize the word "great" and "victory", as if s/he were aiming to show this childish arrogance that s/he belives all Koreans have.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>Chaoxian duli yundong zhi xieshi by Bak Inseok (1920) states "900-1,600 including Regimental Commander Kano," Daehan Minguk jeongdangsa compiled by the National Election Commission (1964) "over 1,000," Hanguk jeonjaengsa by the Military History Compilation Committee of the Ministry of National Defense (1967) "3,300 dead and wounded," and Hanguk Minjok Undongsa by Jo Jihun (1975) "3,300 inclugin Regimental Commander Kano." Apparently the number of Japanese casualties have been exaggerated.</i> Apparently, this is the exact reason why we don't use primary sources. Maybe, Koreans don't claim all these exaggerations, but you <b>construct</b> these Korean claims all yourself. I've never heard of this &amp; I don't care.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>NPOV policy states that not only should you present Japanese point of view, but also you should give Korean point of view as well. Additionally, I don't see too much problem with the casualties thing. I think that the editor who wrote this put all these POV claims out of spite. I believe that s/he is a Japanese nationalist &amp; can't stand anything that could be considered a great loss to the inferior Koreans.</li>

<dd>I say we must change the "Controversies" part. It's POV. As for the title, I say just let it be, since the place WAS in China, and we can just get by with the <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hanja.html" title="Hanja">Hanja</a>. - <a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGeneral_Tiger_b180.html" title="User:General Tiger">General Tiger</a></dd>
</dl>
<p><br />
The casualties was 800-1,100 killed or wounded not 11 or 3,300 I would like that to be changed as well the title im fine with but the rest has already been adressed by Wikimachine thanks for adressing this after my request from this article the editer is <a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENanshu_9373.html" title="User:Nanshu">Nanshu</a> -<a href="../../../e/a/s/User%7EEasternknight_6bbb.html" title="User:Easternknight">Easternknight</a></p>

<dd>I demand the source about Japanese casualties(800~3,000or800-1,100). And, I demand the implementation of the thing that you said."you construct these Japan claims all yourself" --<a href="../../../o/p/p/User%7EOpp2_e07e.html" title="User:Opp2">Opp2</a> 21:44, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>What does <i>"All the sources are Japanese &amp; pre-1990. Japan did not do much to acknowledge what happened during their occupation of Korea until ~2000"</i> concretely indicate? I do not hear that new historical materials was discovered. What are grounds to which you assume them to be junk?<br /></li>
<li>Let's practice <i>"NPOV policy states that not only should you present Japanese point of view and but also you should give Korean point of view as well"</i> and <i>"you construct these Korean claims all yourself"</i> at another article.<br /></li>
<li><i>"s/he is a Japanese nationalist"</i> I will think that such a smear word is a deception and emptiness.<br /></li>
<li><i>"Apparently, this is the exact reason why we don't use primary sources"</i> Daehan Minguk jeongdangsa, Hanguk jeonjaengsa and Hanguk Minjok Undongsa are not primary sources. Chaoxian duli yundong zhi xieshi also is not primary source because the author goes down to Shanghai, and doesn't participate in the combat at all. And these are also quoted in Sasaki's thesis.<br /></li>
<li><i>"I've never heard of this &amp; I don't care"</i> Your investigation might merely be insufficient.<br /></li>
</ul>
<p>I am advising to you. Never quote Shin Young-Ha's thesis. --<a href="../../../o/p/p/User%7EOpp2_e07e.html" title="User:Opp2">Opp2</a> 16:36, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><i>"However, it has already been proved by primary sources that their claim is groundless propaganda"</i> This should be changed and be left. What about <i>"However, their claim and primary sources are the opposite extremes."?</i> This comparison is being written in Sasaki's book.I also have confirmed primary source.</li>
<li><i>Since they suffered from shortage of human resources and financial difficulties, they frequently crossed the border into Korea and raided people and officials who were mostly ethnic Koreans seems a little off from facts that I know.</i> Did you really read the source that was able to be trusted? I want to know the source of YOUR FACT. They attacked the mail clerk and the farmer etc. A lot of the complaints had come to the Chosun Soutokufu. A miserable recognizance of six related groups remains. The statistical material of there crime remains, too.</li>

<dd>Just an addendum: I don't know why Bak Inseok's book is referred to in Chinese, whereas it was in Korean. A little bit of background on Bak Inseok might be in order: he is an old time Korean nationalist who compiled the stories of Korean resistance against Japanese, mostly in Manchuria, which became the book mentioned in the article--its title can be translated as Blood History of Korean Independence movement. Many of the figures cited by Korean nationalist historians of the old days come out of his compilation--among others, the casualties during the March 1 movement and the activities of the nationalist fighters in Manchuria and Sino-Korean border regions. While the figures claimed in the book were indeed collected with a great deal of difficulty, it is nevertheless a book with agenda and perhaps not an entirely trustworthy source. For something like March 1 movement, where neither Korean nationalists nor Japanese military authorities had incentives to report truthfully on the death toll, the figures in Bak's book may have some relevance, but for something like this article, I'd rate official Japanese records (not articles) to be superior sources of information simply for the fact that military logistics requires that accurate records of personnel and equipment be kept. --<a href="../../../h/2/7/User%7EH27kim_6434.html" title="User:H27kim">h27kim</a> 01:41 18 March 2007 (PST)</dd>

Then, what is your concrete grounds that you judged the material of Japan to be <b>junks</b>? I admit Shin Young-Ha's thesis is made a junk. Because he is intentionally misinterpreting material.

Furthermore, I added the emphasis on the fact that Japanese government did not welcome other theories about the occupation than the ones that their historians came up with - until the 1990s. The references are from the 1980s. So, they are very likely to be POV. (<a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikimachine_1c21.html" title="User:Wikimachine">Wikimachine</a> 05:47, 3 January 2007 (UTC))

<dd>Where of the policy of wikipedia is it being written? It is your original standard. Is Japanese Government rejecting?ãIs the concrete evidence about that? --<a href="../../../o/p/p/User%7EOpp2_e07e.html" title="User:Opp2">Opp2</a> 05:55, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Are not you misunderstanding no acceptance of Japan of the historical view of Korea? Are not you only assuming junk based on KOREA POV? --<a href="../../../o/p/p/User%7EOpp2_e07e.html" title="User:Opp2">Opp2</a> 06:00, 3 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>It's not a policy, it's my opinion. (<a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikimachine_1c21.html" title="User:Wikimachine">Wikimachine</a> 06:01, 3 January 2007 (UTC))

<dd>Do you assume junk only by your opinion? Moreover, you verify neither the thesis nor the book. I verified the thesis of Shin'yongha. Cancel assumption as Junk. --<a href="../../../o/p/p/User%7EOpp2_e07e.html" title="User:Opp2">Opp2</a> 06:09, 3 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I'll withdraw my offensive description of the references as junks. Sorry, Opp2. (<a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikimachine_1c21.html" title="User:Wikimachine">Wikimachine</a> 06:11, 3 January 2007 (UTC))

<dd>I understand. I advise to you. The Korean did not touch this topic on the Japan-Korea translation BBS.--<a href="../../../o/p/p/User%7EOpp2_e07e.html" title="User:Opp2">Opp2</a> 06:30, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
