<p>Missing wikipedic form: "<i>You can visit the tombs..., the venerable companion..., Zaid fought in matchless spirit of bravery until he fell..., Credited with great wisdom and piety...</i>" - This is a hagiographical narration, no sober encyclopedic article.

<p>Upon a quick skimming, I really had no idea how/why/what the battle of Mut'ah was, just that people died from it. It is very descriptive of the tombs however, so i think that this might actually fit into a different artic, maybe Shrine's near/from Kerak. I couldn't really grasp any of the nuances (if recorded) of this battle. Chapparal 21:42, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The place is clear, however, not really showable. Only can be shown in near/from sentences.That is, Mut'ah, now, doesn't exists. In early Islamic history, there, was a place that best swords had been made. But in certain Islamic sources, this battle is known.</p>
<p>Its importance may not be seeable to everyone, but its heroic story is well known among muslims. Though, it is said that the Byzantinian army was 100.000, in some sources, it is also said that it may be 15.000. The important thing is the Byzantinian part of the battle was outnumbered.</p>
<p>This battle is fought because the Gassanid-Byzantinian King Shurahbil had killed the messenger of the prophet. It was not decided to be a battle of ten of thousands men. It was only an adventure, sort of, that the Prophet had to punish the kingdom that killed his messenger. In turn, Shurahbil, may have heard the power growing in Arabia and gathering Arabs in union, so, he may have thought that a big army is coming, or may have thougth to punish them. Because Arabia was, kind of, no-man's land or a place no one wants, only keeping there in silent was acceptable. At that time, also Persian Empire wanted this silience, because Yemen was in control of the Persian Empire. Yemen near that time (it is certain that nearly a couple hundreds year before ) was a nice place with plenty of water. But it is known that a flood made this area a desert. Whatever...</p>
<p>And there is a mistyping or similarity in the name.. Some one calls the place (as in wikipedia) Mut'ah. It is the a name for a type of marriage (not very acceptable to muslims). Also there is a link at the bottom of the page in the <a href="../../../m/u/t/Mut%27ah.html" title="Mut'ah">Mut'ah</a>. Some calls it Mutah, some calls it Mootah, some calls it Mûtah. Turks calls it Mûta. I think we must overcome this at first, I mean finding the real name.</p>
<p>Western sources usually do not note this battle, because, it has not viable consequences for the history. Think of a weird battle, that one part is outnumbered, and the same part had some gain, but the the other part had gainings too in battle. At last, the other part withdrawed from the battle with its gainings, and the outnumbered part did not follow them. What do you call this. A victory, a defeat? Islamic scholars have been arguing about that for 1400 years. Mfyuce 19:46, 4 March 2006 (UTC)mfyuce</p>

<p>I agree that the article is in need of a cleanup, as some of the wording needs improvement e.g. "you can visit". As a compramise, how about adding the article to the category in question, so it appears on the correct cleanup list but without having the banner splashed across the top?

<dd>Ok, in order to stop reverts concerning the word 'prophet' i think it is better to let the article be the way it is now:mentioning the word only once in the beginning. --<a href="../../../h/e/c/User%7EHectorian_d70e.html" title="User:Hectorian">Hectorian</a> 20:24, 1 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Calling Muhammad a "Prophet" is POV because many people think otherwise; this is why we call him just Muhammad as per <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia%7EManual_of_Style_%28Islam-related_articles%29_b44f.html" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style (Islam-related articles)">Wikipedia:Manual of Style (Islam-related articles)</a>.

<p>Muslim Commanders of that war were the idol of the fight, who fought in front. This encourages the soldiers. They are not like the commanders of our time. Our commanders administer the fight on a hill near the battle field, so no harm comes to him. This is why so many muslim commanders killed in that battle. Mfyuce 16:58, 30 June 2006 (UTC)mfyuce</p>

<dd>Commanders of our time? Our commanders are not cowards. Besides, why can't everyone just accept that it was a clear cut Byzantine vicory? The Muslims completely obliterated the Byzantines anyways at Yarmuk. Why not just Boast Yarmuk. That should keep some face. Its all about keeping face.</dd>

<dd>Ok correction, Commanders of that time used to get involved in the heat of the battle more so than today where they are particularly in the rear line planning and playing command &amp; conquer; its not saying they're cowards but the way of doing it changes with how we mentally approach war then and today.

I need consensus against the edits to be able to semi-protect the page. The problem with the IP address isn't that it is from Saudi Arabia, but if you read the WHOIS report it says "Part of this IP block has been used for proxy/cache service at the National level in Saudi Arabia. All Saudi Arabia web traffic will come from this IP block." Of course we can't block an entire country over a one person.

<p>How he held the banner with no hands? Simple. After both of his hands were cut off, Jafar held the banner to his chest by pressing it with his upper arms, until he was killed. The event is known in many Islamic sources. He was given the name Flying Jafar because, from the muslim POV, Allah replaced his cut off hands with wings to fly in paradise.</p>

<p>Okay, the above protection section isn't discussing the issue. Yes, it seems that the anon aren't exactly doing a great job sourcing things... but, let's discuss. We'll use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Battle_of_Mu%27tah&amp;diff=56366990&amp;oldid=56322293" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Battle_of_Mu%27tah&amp;diff=56366990&amp;oldid=56322293" rel="nofollow">this diff</a> as the difference between the two versions.</p>
<p>The first thing is the version in use now only cites <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philip_Khuri_Hitti_d0f7.html" title="Philip Khuri Hitti">Philip Khuri Hitti</a>'s book. Does this book cover all of the differences? Honestly, this does read like hagiography... or its portrayal of individuals... that's fine if it's labelled as such and not presented as fact. So, can we source up some of those traditions... mention that they are traditions and should not be accepted as we would well documented history. Does that sound good? But, it all needs to be well sources... page, etc. from various sources. So, does this sound like a good basis? <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGrenavitar_5bda.html" title="User:Grenavitar">gren</a> <a href="../../../g/r/e/User_talk%7EGrenavitar_133f.html" title="User talk:Grenavitar">グレン</a> 09:44, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Pecher, Why are their question marks in front of the names of Muslim commanders? There shouldn’t be any confuses as far as that is concerned, right. If you are confused about something that doesn’t mean you should make other confused as well. The Casualties part if you don’t know the numbers then how can you say "Unknown, but heavy". I don’t get it man where you come up with these kinds a things man. Were you present on the day of the Battle and were you counting the soldiers being killed from each side, no right so how can you say “Unknown, but heavy” and put question marks in front of the names of Muslim commanders. Please man; don’t try to hide the truth by trying to make it look like a part of confusion. Thank You <a href="../../../s/a/l/User%7ESalman01_ae51.html" title="User:Salman01">Salman</a></p>

Questions marks are ugly and bad practice. It should be made into a footnote discussing what the sources are and the fact that it is not necessarily accepted by academics. If I'm not mistaken there are no contradictory commander names so that works.</p>
<p><a href="../../../t/h/e/Theodorus.html" title="Theodorus">Theodorus</a> links to a generic page... so don't link it. Location should be "present day Jordan" probably... because it wasn't Jordan then. "Unknown, but heavy" is wordy and not very good. If there is any information (even if only traditions and not academic) then cite them as such. Ibn Ishaq says XXX about casualties or whatever the case may be... traditions are fine as long as they are noted marked in the proper context.</p>
<p>"According to the Muslim sources" is too vague. Because, the issue is historical Muslim traditions that tend to be far enough removed to not be fully trustworthy, to say the least. However, as it stands it's basically saying that Muslims can't be honest or academic about their history...</p>
<p>Before this turns into an edit war can we agree on that? <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGrenavitar_5bda.html" title="User:Grenavitar">gren</a> <a href="../../../g/r/e/User_talk%7EGrenavitar_133f.html" title="User talk:Grenavitar">グレン</a> 22:09, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I reverted to Pecher, Salman01s edits where not acceptable - whatever issued might need to be adressed. "Muslims can't be honest or academic": the article states indeed that Muslims bend history to further their aims ...as all else did, from Jengis Khan to Charlemagne to Mao Tse Tung. That Muslim historiography and particularly the hagiography were acurate accounts to be understood literally is a stance evaluated critically even by major Muslim historians when there were. --<a href="../../../t/i/c/User%7ETickle_me_f9ac.html" title="User:Tickle me">tickle</a> <a href="../../../t/i/c/User_talk%7ETickle_me_c608.html" title="User talk:Tickle me">me</a> 00:58, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"Muslims bend history to further their aims" is a universal that cannot be substantiated... saying "Communists bend history to futher their aims" is not better. Because, the old Muslim sources which are very hagiographic are not Muslims. Modern Muslim scholars need not be hagiographic but using such a phrase as "According to the Muslim sources" lumps all Muslim sources into one category... when it is in fact exact sources of these traditions that are relevant (the level of acceptance in the Muslim community of these sources is also an issue--and the traditions are widely accepted as fact). <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGrenavitar_5bda.html" title="User:Grenavitar">gren</a> <a href="../../../g/r/e/User_talk%7EGrenavitar_133f.html" title="User talk:Grenavitar">グレン</a> 07:18, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I was to curt: the academic view section IMO doesn't make an unwarranted point of a general Muslim tendency of misrepresentation but points to the specified event in question. However, it would be good if the "traditional Muslim sources" cited would be specified, as their summarily mention leads to generalisations and slanted interpretation by the reader.</dd>

We are not going to imply that Muslim scholars are sloppy, pious idiots.

The only common thing is that they are non-Muslim and have deceided to ignore 1400 Muslim research and start from scrach. And therefore, they come to other conclusions. Also, they many times have a "Muhammad can not be a true prophet" pov, either since they are secular and dont belive in miracles, or since they are christians and need to belive he was a false prophet. Claiming non-Muslim scholars have the right to be labeled "Academics" in exlusion to Muslim scholars is nothing more than egocentric arrogance, and wikipedia is not going to tolerate such childish behavior.--<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 11:50, 1 July 2006 (UTC) --<a href="../../../t/i/c/User%7ETickle_me_f9ac.html" title="User:Tickle me">tickle</a> <a href="../../../t/i/c/User_talk%7ETickle_me_c608.html" title="User talk:Tickle me">me</a> 01:38, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Along with undoing the unfortunate change of section title "Academic view" to "Non-Muslim view", perhaps it'd be better to label what is now called the "Muslim account" the "Traditional account"? That would seem significantly less presumptious in this regard. The current section titles "Muslim view" vs. "non-Muslim view" divides readers into camps before they've even read the text, instructing them which to favor according to their religious beliefs.Timothy Usher 16:29, 1 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Striver, there's no such thing as the "Non-Muslim view" of the Battle of Mu'tah. Beyond the fact that most people have <i>never heard of</i> the Battle of Mu'tah, there's certainly no "non-Muslim" ideology, religious or otherwise, which asks that we have any particular view about it (or about most other things).Timothy Usher 02:33, 2 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Is there something fundamentally nonsensical about the allowance that a Muslim might be critical of traditional accounts of history? Perhaps the problem can be avoided by getting specific about sources - right now there's only Buhl, sourced by Pecher, I'd presume, from a subscription-only site. Whence does this "Muslim view" derive (which you've now just presented as "The Battle"), and whence the "academic view" (which you've retitled the "Non-Muslim view")? He-said she-said s a poor way of organizing articles.Timothy Usher 04:23, 2 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The roman guy is not going into the main view, since his data is disputed. Only undisputed facts go into the main view.

<dd>I see that as a spirit of cooperation. You see, you are correct that hadith <b>in them selves</b> are a primary source, but when a scholar has autheticated it, it becomes a secondary source to quote it. So quoting Sahih Bukhari is a secondary source, just stating a random hadith from no book is a primary source. regarding "crucial distinction here is between historical Muslim sources and modern scholarship". Tell me the difference, in great detail. Tell me how the difference is NOT that the "modern scholarship" (as you refer to them) are non-Muslims. and tell me, were does the PRESENT Islamic centers of Qom (Shi'a) and Al-Ahzar (Sunni) come into your definition. Im still convinced that you lump al non-Muslims into "academic" and all muslims as ...

So I am only changing that Muslims section of this article and if someone doesn’t feel comfortable with the material in that section then please discus it on the talk page first.

<p>I have stopped inserting POV text. And no, I dont have the <i>Encyclopaedia of Islam</i>. I am only performing minor edits to the muslim view of the battle. Besides, it was stated before I wrote 'His withdrawal plan was entirely successful', that 'Al-Walid managed to save the remaining troops from complete annihilation', meaning he was successful. The reason I changed it in the <b>Muslim view</b> of the battle is because Islamic sources do not state that the muslims were going to be completely annhilated. Sherif9282</p>

<dd>In many Islamic sources, it is said that Al'Walid reorganized the muslim army, by reshuffling the left and right flanks of the army and making new banners. He wanted to create the impression on the Byzantines that a new army had arrived from Madinah, and that the army the Byzantines had been fighting against for the past six days was hiding somewhere else. So when they retreated, the Romans didn't follow because they feared an ambush. They stayed behind, thinking the muslims might attack again, and the muslim army was safe. Sherif9282</dd>

<ul>
<li>the figure for the number of muslims participating at the battle of mu'tah (3,000) is cited in za'ad al-ma'ad of ibn al-qayyim volume 2 page 155, fath al-baari volume 7 page 511 of ibn hajar, and subsequently ar-raheeq al-makhtoom (the sealed nectar) by mubarakpuri (sidenote: <s>mubarakpuri puts the figure of byzantines present at a mere 200,000</s> i see it's already present in the article)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>in the same works as mentioned above it is mentioned that khaalid ibn al-waleed made a strategic change (za'ad al-ma'ad page 156 of same volume, fath al-baari pages 513-514 of same volume, and again raheeq al-makhtoom- in which mubarakpuri explains that the nature of the change was the shuffling of the left and right flanks while bringing fighters from the rear into the front-line), which deluded the byzantines into thinking that the muslims had fresh reinforcements and thus made them unwilling to press forward- thereby allowing a calculated and successful withdrawl by the muslims with minimal damage.</li>
</ul>
<p>therefore, some parts of the "traditional" account need change (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Battle_of_Mu%27tah&amp;oldid=66923575" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Battle_of_Mu%27tah&amp;oldid=66923575" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> seems to be a more accurate narration of traditionalist perspective of events) <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItaqallah_7a9f.html" title="User:Itaqallah"><small><b><font color="#029DDD">ITAQALLAH</font></b></small></a> 00:20, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

Just Qu'ran and Sunnah... Talking of which - something shocking's coming up: this masterwork of, ugh, Islamic science mentions the "Prophet" 1269 times, "Muhammad" 380 times and the combination "Prophet Muhammad" 26 times.

<p>well i have to admit 'tickle me', you've got me pretty puzzled! with all due respect i find your critique lacking almost any credibility whatsoever. i don't understand why you are focusing on the name "mubarakpuri", where "mubarakpuri" simply indicates the place he was born (i.e. mubarakpur, india) which i am sure you already knew. perhaps you should take a good look at the <a href="http://www.dar-us-salam.com/store/main.mvc?Screen=PROD&amp;Store_Code=Dus&amp;Product_Code=004&amp;Category_Code=Eng_History" class="external text" title="http://www.dar-us-salam.com/store/main.mvc?Screen=PROD&amp;Store_Code=Dus&amp;Product_Code=004&amp;Category_Code=Eng_History" rel="nofollow">cover of raheeq al-makhtoom</a> and see where it says "Islamic University Medina al-Munawwarah". it is endorsed by the islamic university of medina and thus easily qualifies as RS. the hard copy, of which i do not have immediate access to right now, also has a certificate of authentication from the university of medina. the book is published by dar-us-salam, the official press of saudi, and a well known muslim press. and as far as i know, mubarakpuri is currently working in riyadh. furthermore perhaps you should check out the <a href="http://www.dar-us-salam.com/store/main.mvc?Screen=PROD&amp;Store_Code=Dus&amp;Product_Code=Q09&amp;Category_Code=Eng_Quran" class="external text" title="http://www.dar-us-salam.com/store/main.mvc?Screen=PROD&amp;Store_Code=Dus&amp;Product_Code=Q09&amp;Category_Code=Eng_Quran" rel="nofollow">abridged translation</a> of ibn katheer into english (the only english translation of tafseer ibn katheer to my knowledge), which was done by mubarakpuri at the head of a "group of scholars" as claimed by dar-us-salam (mubarakpuri is referred to as "<i>Head of the Research Committee of Darussalam</i>" in the publishers note). his credibility and scholarship is proven (please be sure to read the overviews and publisher's notes for both publications in the links provided). therefore i don't quite understand why you have been so verbose in trying to dismiss him as an unreliable source. as for the honorifics (or lack of according to your wonderful OR), so what? are you going to discredit ibn hisham too? what about the plethora of historical texts written by muslim classical scholars which contemporary historians/encyclopaedias rely upon? or do they simply not exist just because you know not of them? hope that clarifies any misunderstandings <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItaqallah_7a9f.html" title="User:Itaqallah"><small><b><font color="#029DDD">ITAQALLAH</font></b></small></a> 16:52, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>as for this ranking you have provided, which is extremely irrelevant in this context, then quite clearly it depends on what criterion they are ranked. islamic studies, which is what the university naturally and exclusively specialises in, does not seem to be one of them, or at least not a sinificant factor. regardless, i'm guessing that you are going to have to try much harder if you want to dismiss a verifiable, relevant and reliable source as non-RS. <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItaqallah_7a9f.html" title="User:Itaqallah"><small><b><font color="#029DDD">ITAQALLAH</font></b></small></a> 17:26, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>i forgot to mention that perhaps you should note that the letter پ (pa) does not exist in the arabic language (it exists in urdu/hindi/farsi), which is why in arabic his name his written with a ف (fa)- and this is why his name is written as both mubarakfuri (or can be even mubarakburi) and mubarakpuri <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItaqallah_7a9f.html" title="User:Itaqallah"><small><b><font color="#029DDD">ITAQALLAH</font></b></small></a> 18:47, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>What qualifies something as a reliable source is a process called "peer review" whereby the author's peers check the work for accuracy and compatibility with scholarly standards. This is the reason why works published by reputable scholarly journals and university presses qualify as reliable sources. We know exactly nothing about review processses at <a href="http://www.iu.edu.sa/english/index.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.iu.edu.sa/english/index.htm" rel="nofollow">Islamic University of Medina</a>, but we know for sure that on the scale of scholarly authority it's exactly nowhere. Another thing we can say for sure is that <i>The Sealed Nectar</i> is a piece of hagiogrpahy, not a scholarly work. The question is whether it qualifies as a good source source to describe the Muslim hagiographic view of the events. Here, the answer is "no". Biogrpahies of Muhammad are numerous, and they differ from each other; for example, in the number of the Byzantine troops cited. Therefore, to give to the reader a complete picture, we need a reliable academic source that would present a study of the most notable Muslim biogrpahies of Muhammad and give a concise picture, describing common and diverging features in Muslim hagiogrpahy. The <i><a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopaedia_of_Islam_8ed9.html" title="Encyclopaedia of Islam">Encyclopaedia of Islam</a></i> qualifies as such source, <i>The Sealed Nectar</i> does not.

<p>regarding "peer review", i did request that the publishers notes be read. i quote:</p>
<p><i>The first Islamic Conference on Seerah (biography of the Prophet) was held in 1976 in Pakistan sponsored by the Muslim World League. The League announced a world contest for writing a book on the life of the Prophet. One hundred fifty thousand Saudi Riyals (SR 150,000) (forty thousand U.S. Dollars) was the grand prize for the best five books. One hundred and seventy-one manuscripts were received from all over the world. Out of these, eighty-five were in the Arabic Language, sixty-four in Urdu, twenty-one were in English and one in French and Hausa.</i></p>
<p><i><b>A board of highly qualified scholars judged the manuscripts and announced the results</b>. The manuscript of Shaikh Safiur-Rahman Mubarakpuri, Jamiah Salafiyah Banaras (India), author of the book in hand (The Sealed Nectar) received first the grand prize of SR 50,000 (fifty thousand Saudi Riyals) for its authentic and sound collections of the narrations. Dr. Majid Ali Khan, New Delhi, India, placed second. The third prize went to Dr. Naseer Ahmed, Islamic University, Lahore, Pakistan. ...</i></p>
<p><i>... Afterwards, the book was published by the Muslim World League and then many other organizations gained the honor of publishing this masterpiece. Darussalam also published this book in the Arabic language. I had wished to publish this book in the English language for the wider benefit of humanity. Shaikh Safiur-Rahman willingly agreed to the idea and consented to publish the English translation. The stage of translation was traversed with the help of brother Mahir Abu Dhahab, owner and general manager of Markaz Noor Ash-Sham in Damascus, Syria.</i> unquote.</p>
<p>the fact that it has been published by a number of presses, endorsed by the islamic university of medina and the <a href="../../../m/u/s/Muslim_World_League_ccc1.html" title="Muslim World League">Muslim World League</a> indicates that it has received significant review and analysis.</p>
<p>" <i>we need a reliable academic source that would present a study of the most notable Muslim biogrpahies of Muhammad and give a concise picture, describing common and diverging features in Muslim hagiogrpahy.</i> "</p>
<p>you would thus be eliminating all scholarly secondary sources, notably those of muslim origin as they would be denounced as hagiography. even then, the sealed nectar is a tertiary source as it brings together material from secondary sources like ibn hisham, ibn al-qayyim and ibn hajar et al. and cites secondary sources in a large number of the paragraphs. i will set up an RfC for this so we can establish the relevance and reliability of the source. <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItaqallah_7a9f.html" title="User:Itaqallah"><small><b><font color="#029DDD">ITAQALLAH</font></b></small></a> 20:08, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

They wouldn't be ashamed of such prestigious collaborator, would they? Not that it matters, given the institution's thunderous rep. Again, speaking of sloppyness: Saifur Rahman al-Mubarakpuri would spell himself Saif al-Rahman al-Mubarakpuri if he was well advised by somebody knowledgeable about proper transliteration, but the <i>Merciful's Sword</i> seems not to be too sharp a cutter.</dd>

<dd>"<i>are you going to discredit ibn hisham too? what about the plethora of historical texts written by muslim classical scholars which contemporary historians/encyclopaedias rely upon? or do they simply not exist just because you know not of them?</i>".

And no, I won't discredit <i>those</i> guys, both were accomplished scientists, in a time when the Islamic world had real cloud on that turf - ugh, 8th and 9th century, isn't it? And I won't stand to discredit <i>any</i> <b>M</b>uslim classical scholar, the point is: they <i>were</i> secondary source to their contemporaries, but they <i>are</i> mere primary sources now.

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>"<i>you would thus be eliminating all scholarly secondary sources ... the sealed nectar is a tertiary source as it brings together material from secondary sources like ibn hisham, ibn al-qayyim and ibn hajar et al.</i>": again, no, I wouldn't.

However, historic erudition of 1000 years ago has been superceded by now: it may astound, but 1000 years is a sizable amount of time for scientific progress.

<dd>the question is whether (<i>according to WP policy</i>) interpretations, analysis and evaluation of reports specific to Muhammad's life by traditionalist muslim historians (some of whom come over half a millenium after Muhammad) are to be considered primary or secondary sources when it comes to ascertaining events during his life. it seems that WP treats such sources as secondary (and rightly so) and should be legitimate for us to use in the way secondary sources are used, unless WP policy is provided explicitly negating the literature of such scholars as secondary sources. <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItaqallah_7a9f.html" title="User:Itaqallah"><small><b><font color="#029DDD">ITAQALLAH</font></b></small></a> 16:10, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>From the text of WP:RS:</b> <b>A primary source is a document or person providing direct evidence of a certain state of affairs; in other words, a source very close to the situation you are writing about. The term most often refers to a document produced by a participant in an event or an observer of that event.</b> It could be an official report, an original letter, a media account by a journalist who actually observed the event, or an autobiography. Statistics compiled by an authoritative agency are considered primary sources. In general, Wikipedia articles should not depend on primary sources but rather on reliable secondary sources who have made careful use of the primary-source material. Most primary-source material requires training to use correctly, especially on historical topics. Wikipedia articles may use primary sources only if they have been published by a reliable publisher e.g. trial transcripts published by a court stenographer, or historic documents that appear in edited collections. We may not use primary sources whose information has not been made available by a reliable publisher. See Wikipedia:No original research and Wikipedia:Verifiability.</dd>
<dd>The fact that a volume compiles and categorises content that would otherwise consist of primary sources doesn't make the book itself a primary source. It isn't the source document and is not close to the events they describe. While a book like Sahih Al Bukhari might be considered closer to being a primary than a secondary source, other books by scholars (including Al Raheequl Makhtum) that compile narrations from such hadiths are secondary sources. Note that WP:RS doesn't ban the use of primary sources outright, just those not made available by a reliable publisher. PLEASE, if someone challenges your sources using Wikipedia policy as reason, READ the policy and make sure it's not being exploited or misinterpreted. There is no reason to exclude these very reliable sources. <a href="../../../h/i/s/User%7EHis_excellency_ec70.html" title="User:His excellency">His Excellency...</a> 00:33, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>A primary source is what is used by historians as a basis for research. Muslim biogrpahies of Muhammad are thus by definition primary sources because they are much closer to the events than modern historians are. We can draw parallels between Muslim biogrpahies of Muhammad and ancient or medieval chronicles; the latter are also primary sources, even though many were written centuries after the events they describe.

<p>The Sealed Nectar definitely qualifies as a reliable source. It is a secondary source, most importantly. Just because it bases its accounts on compilations of primary sources, doesn't mean IT is a primary source. Secondly, it's notable as it has recieved acclaim and awards from Islamic institutions. It's published and easily available. There is no good excuse for excluding it, other than that it isn't a western publication (which happens to be a very bad excuse). <a href="../../../h/i/s/User%7EHis_excellency_ec70.html" title="User:His excellency">His Excellency...</a> 00:36, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Because its plainly wrong - anywhere. The Roman Empire existed between the 8th to the 5th century BC, while Byzantion was it's successor till the the 15th century. The Romans spoke Latin, the Byzantines Greek. The historical and cultural ties are well known and undoubted - however, that doesn't alter what historical sciences have established as authoritaive terminology to describe things that where related, but no the same. swordofallah.com is a lot of things, but not a source of academic repute. Nobody doubts that Islamic religious sources speak of Rome where Byzantion is meant for want of accurate terminology. And nobody doubts that as consequence this misconception is popular among Muslims. I included it in the "Muslim account" section, as it might be of interest to non-Muslim readers as well.</dd>

<p>No you are completely wrong. <i>The Roman Empire existed between the 8th to the 5th century BC</i> No it lasted from 753Bc to AD1453 - this is not disputed by any scholar Western or Islamic. See <a href="http://www.encyclopedia.com/html/R/Romanlaw.asp" class="external text" title="http://www.encyclopedia.com/html/R/Romanlaw.asp" rel="nofollow">here</a> <i>while Byzantion was it's successor till the the 15th century.</i> A successor state requires that there be some break between it and the prior state. This is not the case with the Byzantine empire where there is no break only continuity - hence the Byzantine empire is the Roman empire as argued in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1841763608/002-0943671-6679233?v=glance&amp;n=283155" class="external text" title="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1841763608/002-0943671-6679233?v=glance&amp;n=283155" rel="nofollow">this</a> recent book by a Western Byzantine scholar. The term Byzantine empire is used simply to distinguish the late Christian medieval Roman empire from the Ancient Roman empire it does not mean that there were two separate entities. See <a href="http://www.assemblage.group.shef.ac.uk/4/4turner.html" class="external text" title="http://www.assemblage.group.shef.ac.uk/4/4turner.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>and <a href="http://www.friesian.com/decdenc1.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.friesian.com/decdenc1.htm" rel="nofollow">here</a>. <i>The Romans spoke Latin, the Byzantines Greek.</i> This is overly simplistic - Latin never displaced Greek as the main language in the east of the empire - the empire was effectively bilingual which is why you find Greek &amp; Latin inscriptions throughout the empire. See <a href="http://www.chass.utoronto.ca/edicta/shaw/a2.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.chass.utoronto.ca/edicta/shaw/a2.htm" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>
<p>With reference to your comment that my statement above is to use your phrase "pathetic OR" maybe you should try reading something about it and then you would see it is by no means OR - I even listed some books that support what I said.

<dd>Could you be bothered not to cross-post constantly, to force reaction where it's not warranted? And could you be bothered to prove that it's established terminology in contemporary academic literature to equate Romans with Byzantines? All you "proved" so far is that Western historical science is well aware of the ties between Byzanztium and Rome. Incidentally, that's what nobody denies. --<a href="../../../t/i/c/User%7ETickle_me_f9ac.html" title="User:Tickle me">tickle</a> <a href="../../../t/i/c/User_talk%7ETickle_me_c608.html" title="User talk:Tickle me">me</a> 02:02, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I posted it on your talk page because I found your accusation of "pathetic OR" offensive. If you acctually read any of the links I posted you would see that it affirms the fact that the Byzantines were Romans and referred to themselves as such and their empire as 'the Roman Empire'. Every book on Byzantium acknowledges this. Gibbon in his decline and fall of the Roman Empire goes up to 1453 and the fall of Constantinople. <a href="http://www.roman-emperors.org/impindex.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.roman-emperors.org/impindex.htm" rel="nofollow">This</a> index of Roman emperors goes all the way till 1453. All Islamic sources refer to Byzantines as Romans and most modern scholarship recognises that it was the continuance of the Eastern Roman Empire and not a successor state as you claim.

The term Byzantine was introduced as a descriptor after the empire stopped existing, for the same reasons we are discussing now, to help distinguish its historical period from the earlier periods. In all likelyhood no contemporary historical account of the empire has ever called it by the term byzantine empire. I feel putting the word Roman in confuses people into thinking of a empire centered around Rome. As UserTickle me's confusion has already demonstrated, the term Roman Empire is better associated today with the one that existed in the pre-division period, with Caesar and Nero etc. The western empire was already been overrun by the 5th, so in 7th the only surviving part that remained was the east, which is why they still saw and called themselves Romans. If you must have Roman I suggest you consider making it so: Eastern Roman (Byzantine), while it is redundant, atleast in this form it gives the readers more accurate and less confusing information which I suppose is good.--<a href="../../../t/i/g/User%7ETigeroo_ae66.html" title="User:Tigeroo">Tigeroo</a> 07:13, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree with Byzantine. I also think the section names should be parallel, or at least not promote a judgment on sources, so I've changed "Secular academic view" to "Non-Muslim account". I hope this will be temporary until we can find a better organization for the material that doesn't split it into Muslim and non-Muslim sections, but with the material we have now, this is the fairest compromise. - <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerzbow_28f9.html" title="User:Merzbow">Merzbow</a> 18:19, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Roydosan, unless you're directly quoting the Islamic sources, we should use terms based on their most common and accepted usage, and in English Byzantine is the accepted term for this particular empire (see <a href="../../../b/y/z/Byzantine_Empire_38f2.html" title="Byzantine Empire">Byzantine_Empire</a>). If you want to change that usage, here is not the place to fight that battle.

<p>If you disbelieve me look at <a href="http://www.swordofallah.com" class="external text" title="http://www.swordofallah.com" rel="nofollow">this</a>. And as I repeatedly stated above I have not argued that Roman should replace Byzantine throughout the article (nor am I trying to change the accepted terminology as you claim (though that is a moot point as far as the 600s go since many scholars still refer to the Byzantines as Romans at this point as <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0297778218/202-4233280-1206235?v=glance&amp;n=266239&amp;s=books&amp;v=glance" class="external text" title="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0297778218/202-4233280-1206235?v=glance&amp;n=266239&amp;s=books&amp;v=glance" rel="nofollow">this</a> book does) - only that the box should read Roman (Byzantine) Empire which does not cause confusion because any Muslim expecting to read about the Romans will see that they are referred to as Byzantines throughout the article because of this. Also the opening paragraph should state that the Muslim accounts refer to the defeat of a Roman force because Muslims do not have the term Byzantine; so it is a complete misnomer to state that Muslim accounts refer to a 'Byzantine' force when no Muslim account does. <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoydosan_77f2.html" title="User:Roydosan">Roydosan</a> 09:24, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I took a look at the illicit copy of The Sealed Nectar that someone posted online ... no, I would not rate it highly as an academic source. It IS hagiography. However, I think that it's notable hagiography, as representing the approved <b>Saudi</b> take on the life of Muhammad. We've been having this battle over "reliable sources" in numerous WP articles. The same cadre of editors keeps trying to exclude Muslim voices on the ground that they aren't "reliable." They aren't reliable in the academic sense; they wouldn't pass peer review in a Western academic press. BUT -- by completely shutting them out of WP you're denying useful knowledge to encyclopedia users.</p>
<p>I had an interesting email exchange with a professor at a California college, who talked about his difficulties teaching classes re Islam. He would make certain statements, his Muslim students would erupt in outrage, and he would be left wondering exactly went wrong. I was able to explain what went wrong (thanks to endless sparring here on WP) and he was grateful. He's going to be a better teacher now. He can make exactly the same points he was trying to make -- he won't censor himself, and I wouldn't want him to do so -- but now he knows where he can expect difficulty.</p>
<p>If you exclude Muslim POVs from WP you are condemning countless encyclopedia users to the same problems. Non-Muslims need to know what Muslims think. You don't have to present those POVs as true; all you need to note is that they exist and what they are. Trying to make those views go away by censoring them from WP isn't going to work. Full and fair exposure works a lot better at combatting musty medieval POVs than censoring them does. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 02:07, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>thank you Zora for your input, i have some (actually a lot) questions for you: i am struggling to understand what kind of peer review is required for a work to be considered reliable. does it require <i>western academic</i> approval specifically for it to be RS on WP? i don't seem to be able to pinpoint exactly where in WP:RS the conflict is occuring regarding the status of mpuri and moreover his work. if the methodology of the work is scientific and sourced, does the POV put forward negate its reliability? .. or does WP only accept secular scholarship as reliable?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>on the premise that the work is not reliable according to WP (which i don't feel is necessarily correct), to what extent can the work be used in relation to islamic history? facts, figures, names, places? cause, effect, context? what about using other sources like ibn hisham.. or at-tabari, or later sources like ibn hajar and ibn katheer... is it legitimate to have a sentence of narrative or a particular assertion and then citing such works (which from a secular viewpoint will also be hagiographical) as can be done with usual RS (as long as there is no conflict, in which case both views are mentioned as per WP:NPOV), or is it only a tool for balancing out opposing POV when the relevant RS are missing? thank you. <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItaqallah_7a9f.html" title="User:Itaqallah"><small><b><font color="#029DDD">ITAQALLAH</font></b></small></a> 04:01, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Zora, what are you talking about, of all things? The "Muslim account" account section is already almost twice as large as the "Academic view" - plenty of opportunity to amend it by hagiographic expertise, to which so far nobody did object outspokenly. How dare you smear us as "cadre of editors", allegedly forbidding that. The "Muslim account"s existence or possible alteration has not been contended in this dispute.</dd>

<dd>Western, hmmmm ... Western-style academic tradition has in fact become international, so that degrees from New Delhi or Tokyo schools are recognized as readily as degrees from Stanford. That is, if they're accredited. Islamic institutions aren't accredited. They're in their own little closed-off universe. BUT ... the Islamic traditionalists are also right in seeing the world of accredited universities as being Western in origin (if not necessarily in practice, these days) and alien to traditional Islamic academic institutions. I usually don't use just the word "academic" for that reason; I'll use Western academic or Western-style academic. If you try to reserve "academic" exclusively for one faction, that's subtly POV.</dd>

<p>NPOV is perhaps the most frequently misunderstood policy, and this discussion demonstrates how and why. The whole point of NPOV is not to give equal validity to science and pseudoscience, like astrology, flat Earth theories, or intelligent design. Such views are either not described at all, if they are insignificant, or their existence is acknowledged, if they are significant, like in this case. Thereore, it's incorrect to invoke NPOV when one wants to give equal validity a scientific and a non-scientific view. It's even more incorrect to invoke NPOV to justify an argument that a non-scientific view must be given preference over the scientific one, as Itaqallah and Tigeroo are claiming.

This can easily be resolved we are talking about issues such as estimates on number of combatants (these can get usually no better than just estimates for histories), generals involved, tactics employed etc. I agree the victory condition needs to read byzantine because they were the last ones left standing on the field by all accounts, and if people claim muslim victory they need to contextualize it, because there are things such as pyrrhic victories. I am sure we can qualify and contextualize the usage of the reference texts appropriately to reflect slants.

<p>Fred Donner, <i>The Early Islamic Conquests</i>, pp. 105-110 (treated glancingly)</p>
<p>Hugh Kennedy, <i>The Prophet and the Age of the Caliphates</i>, pp. 42 and 46 (again, glancingly)</p>
<p>Montgomery Watt, <i>Muhammad at Medina</i>, pp. 53-55. Watt treats the matter in much greater detail and says that it is not at all clear who could be described as "winning" the encounter. He suggests that it may have been an inconclusive skirmish rather than a battle. Later accounts were manipulated, he believes, to exalt or blacken various people involved.</p>
<p>I don't want to write the article, but surely someone could look up Watt and give his version. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 08:45, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have begun to reorganize and layout the article at <a href="../../../b/a/t/Talk%7EBattle_of_Mu%27tah_draft_ddb4.html" title="Talk:Battle of Mu'tah/draft">Talk:Battle of Mu'tah/draft</a>. Please feel free to contribute to its development or provide feedback. As it stands I have used a second Muslim account that is older than the sealed nectar. I intend to source and see if my copy of lings or something has things to add and use them as well. The layout works on the premise that most of the information available about the battle comes only from muslim accounts, and such most the information available will be from such a POV therefore the article will mostly refer to this POV for information however it will be clearly indicated as such. As when we can find source other accounts we can incorporate them into the article, so far most of the information and details beyond a brief sentence or too seem to only be available from Muslim sources and so they will have to be backbone of this article, beyond various interpretations of this information I am not sure if there is too much add about this battle from other sources to actually create a detailed enough account to contrast with. I have provided links to information available online to both my two books used as muslim sources, and am trying to take this from a disputed one to possibly a GA rating.--<a href="../../../t/i/g/User%7ETigeroo_ae66.html" title="User:Tigeroo">Tigeroo</a> 18:49, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It looks like a good start. We definitely need to find more Western sources... Zora mentions that Watt has written on it. - <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerzbow_28f9.html" title="User:Merzbow">Merzbow</a> 00:20, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The author of "The Sealed Nectar" stated that the muslim casualties were only 12, and that the Byzantine losses were much higher. As this is not confirmed, I kept <i>unknown</i> in the casualties' box. Sherif9282</p>

<p>This article has been worked over by Muslim editors anxious to prove that it wasn't really a defeat. Western historians see no problem in calling it such. I worked on one section, removing the rebuttal, the claims that only Muslim historians wrote the truth, etc. I'll work on the rest of the article later. I'm not really done. For one thing, I need to slog through and add all the Arabic diacritics that Donner uses. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 03:28, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I rewrote some more; still haven't added diacritics. I discovered that huge swathes of the text were copyvios from WitnessPioneer. There are NO references anywhere in the detailed account per Muslims. I suspect that the account is taken from later, heavily mythologized histories, and that earlier histories, such as Ibn Ishaq, Waqidi, Baladhuri, or Tabari would be be much more sparse. I think we need to break down the currently monolithic "Muslim" account into a multitude of Muslim accounts. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 03:58, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Can somebody ask the editor of this article show some evidence on how there were only 12 muslim casualties and 20000 byzantine casualties!!!!!!!!!!!!How long do you think it took for an army of 3000 muslims to inflict 20000 worth of men on the byzantine side how can you say that?The next day i come back here and its changed and i see these kind of results.PROVE IT!!!!!!!!!if you cant switch it back respectively..............it even says in the article that with the combined force plus arab allies that it is usually reported as 5,000!!!!!!! <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_209.167.194.117_cd25.html" title="Special:Contributions/209.167.194.117">209.167.194.117</a> (talk) 06:33, 3 March 2007 (UTC).</small></p>
<p>Yes, whoever wrote this article probably didnt finish kindergarten, or he'd know this is absolute nonsense. I changed the numbers of troops to show how ridiculous they are, but some muslim behind-the-computer-fundamentalist will probably edit them back again.

<p>i agree with wiki the muslim sources have proven useless,very useless!.i really dont like have to keep talking to get my point to the editor because he doesnt no how to think of whats write!would somebody want to show me that muslim source saying 20,000!then i will show how wrong it is!</p>

<p>Please leave the numbers &amp; casualties as "unknown, muslims claiming x". Saying 15 vs 20,000 casualties is normal because it is "sourced" in some muslim book is ridiculous. I know some people still need to go through the enlightenment but its just irritating to have to revert mindless edits all the time. Jagged85, you cant just say 15 vs 20,000 is what this article should say because you think you have a sourced basis, I cant find any books on most of these Arab-Byzantine battles but this doesnt mean we have to accept muslim numbers. for God's sake, 3,000 muslims vs 200,000 Romans making 15 vs 20,000 casualties would be hard even if the muslims were armed with AK-47's (compare with the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Omdurman_0073.html" title="Battle of Omdurman">Battle of Omdurman</a>).</p>

<dd>Wiki, I never said the Romans had 200,000 soldiers or that they suffered 20,000 casualties. I placed the Roman army at 100,000, the lowest possible estimate we currently know of. The 20,000 casualties figure was added in by an anonymous editor, which I changed back to unknown. If you can find alternative estimates which contradict the Roman army being 100,000, then by all means add it in, but don't remove cited estimates just because you disagree with them, no matter how unbelievable some numbers might be. I feel the same way about some of the numbers given in the Greco-Persian Wars battles, but that doesn't mean I should edit out sourced numbers. Wikipedia is not the place for <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>. <a href="../../../j/a/g/User%7EJagged_85_b01d.html" title="User:Jagged 85">Jagged 85</a> 23:23, 5 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Alright, I'll look for some sources that have more reasonable numbers in my free time, frankly I think in this case NOR is a bit of a glitch in the system, allowing things as 15 casualties to remain on this site. Its not so much that I was disagreeing or anything, just that the numbers involved seemed ridiculous, however you are right. I wasnt really aware that everything that has some sourced backup beats 'common sense' per definition in an encyclopedia, but I stand corrected.</p>

<dl>
<dd>I agree that 15 casualties is quite unrealistic (the actual number must have been somewhere in the hundreds), but it's quite common for primary sources on many battles to exaggerate the numbers. If you do find any other sources pointing to different estimates, feel free to add them. <a href="../../../j/a/g/User%7EJagged_85_b01d.html" title="User:Jagged 85">Jagged 85</a> 02:28, 6 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>
