	    <p>A <b>Battle of annihilation</b> is a military strategy whereby an attacking army seeks to destroy the military capacity of the opposing army in a single planned pivotal <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle.html" title="Battle">battle</a>. This is achieved through the use of tactical surprise, application of overwhelming force at a key point, or other <a href="../../../m/i/l/Military_tactics.html" title="Military tactics">tactics</a> performed immediately before or during the battle.</p>
<p>The intention is that the opposing government will then be forced to <a href="../../../s/u/e/Sue_for_peace.html" title="Sue for peace">sue for peace</a> to prevent the unopposed capture of his capital or other core areas.</p>
<p>It is not necessary to kill or capture all, or even most, of an opposing army's soldiers to annihilate him in the sense used here. Rather, the destruction of the enemy army as a cohesive military force able to offer further meaningful resistance, even if temporarily, is the objective.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_annihilation.html" title="Edit section: Significance of the Term">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Significance of the Term</span></h2>
<p>In ancient and classical times, many battles ended with the annihilation of one of the forces -- the battles of <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Cannae_3437.html" title="Battle of Cannae">Cannae</a> and <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Zama_3fb1.html" title="Battle of Zama">Zama</a> being famous examples. From the <a href="../../../r/e/n/Renaissance.html" title="Renaissance">Renaissance</a> onward, however, the battle of annihilation became rare, at least in Europe. The greatest exception is seen in the battles of <a href="../../../n/a/p/Napoleon_Bonaparte_f92d.html" title="Napoleon Bonaparte">Napoleon Bonaparte</a>, and it is with Napoleon that the battle of annihilation in the modern sense is most closely associated, so that term "Napoleonic battle of annihilation" is sometimes used, and the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Austerlitz_4bfe.html" title="Battle of Austerlitz">Battle of Austerlitz</a> is often cited as the apotheosis of the modern battle of annihilation.</p>
<p><a name="Alternatives_to_the_Battle_of_Annihilation" id="Alternatives_to_the_Battle_of_Annihilation"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_annihilation.html" title="Edit section: Alternatives to the Battle of Annihilation">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Alternatives to the Battle of Annihilation</span></h2>
<p>At first blush, it might seem that annihilation of the opposing army is the obvious object of any <a href="../../../m/i/l/Military_campaign.html" title="Military campaign">military campaign</a>. This is not true, however. Many battles have been fought to cause an enemy army simply to <a href="../../../r/e/t/Retreat.html" title="Retreat">retreat</a>, or to suffer <a href="../../../a/t/t/Attrition.html" title="Attrition">attrition</a>; and many campaigns have been waged to avoid rather than seek such a battle.</p>
<p>Reasons for not seeking a battle of annihilation include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Avoidance of the risk and cost associated with such a battle.</li>
<li>Lack of means to attempt such a battle.</li>
<li>Ability to achieve desired objectives through other means.</li>
<li>Accepted practice.</li>
<li>Political concerns.</li>
</ul>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_annihilation.html" title="Edit section: Risk and Cost">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Risk and Cost</span></h3>
<p>A successful battle of annihilation usually requires exposing one's own army to loss in a way that more conservative tactics do not. For example, attempting to turn an enemy's flank generally requires one to separate the flanking force from one's main body. This exposes the attacking force to <a href="../../../d/e/f/Defeat_in_detail.html" title="Defeat in detail">defeat in detail</a>. Attempting to pierce the enemy's center is usually costly in itself, and also exposes the <a href="../../../v/a/n/Vanguard.html" title="Vanguard">vanguard</a> force to a destructive counterstroke.</p>
<p>This was an especially important consideration during the pre-Napoleonic era, when armies were relatively small forces composed of professional career soldiers and losses were difficult to replace.</p>
<p><a name="Lack_of_Means" id="Lack_of_Means"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_annihilation.html" title="Edit section: Lack of Means">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Lack of Means</span></h3>
<p>From the Renaissance until the advent of military mechanization, armies were slow <i>on the battlefield</i> (not necessarily slow operationally). This was due to the declining efficacy of <a href="../../../c/a/v/Cavalry.html" title="Cavalry">cavalry</a> and to the advent of <a href="../../../a/r/t/Artillery.html" title="Artillery">artillery</a>, which is difficult to move. This made it difficult to move quickly enough to prevent an enemy from countering a battle stratagem, or, failing that, to withdraw safely.</p>
<p>In later times, the classic Napoleonic battle of annihilation has been rendered difficult or impossible by the great size and defensive <a href="../../../f/i/r/Firepower.html" title="Firepower">firepower</a> of modern armies.</p>
<p><a name="Using_Other_Means" id="Using_Other_Means"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_annihilation.html" title="Edit section: Using Other Means">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Using Other Means</span></h3>
<p>If the object of war is to destroy the enemy's ability to resist politically, this may be achieved by other, less expensive, methods.</p>
<p>For example, one may attempt to <a href="../../../m/a/n/Maneuver.html" title="Maneuver">maneuver</a> one's army in such a way as to cut off the enemy from his base of supplies. If this done successfully, the enemy may be forced to seek terms with his army intact. This sort of campaign was typical of <a href="../../../a/g/e/Age_of_Enlightenment_2fd3.html" title="Age of Enlightenment">Enlightenment</a> armies, and is especially associated with the campaigns of <a href="../../../f/r/e/Frederick_the_Great_9da3.html" title="Frederick the Great">Frederick the Great</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_Campaign_4aa0.html" title="French Campaign">French Campaign</a> of 1940 offers an example. After the Germans broke into the French rear at <a href="../../../s/e/d/Sedan.html" title="Sedan">Sedan</a>, they were able to surround the main Allied armies and render their position untenable. No great battle of annihilation was required. (Alternatively, the Germans considered instead striking toward Paris. Capture of the French capital might have broken the French morale and <i>political</i> will to resist.)</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_annihilation.html" title="Edit section: Accepted Practice">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Accepted Practice</span></h3>
<p>In warfare, as in many avenues of human endeavor, the optimal application of material means is sometimes limited by the failure of imagination. A successful battle of annihilation generally requires great skill and daring on the part of the attacking commander. If a commander's training, experience, and peer relationships have not prepared him to expect a battle of annihilation, this alone may prevent him envisioning such a battle.</p>
<p><a name="Political_Considerations" id="Political_Considerations"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_annihilation.html" title="Edit section: Political Considerations">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Political Considerations</span></h3>
<p>If a war has limited political objectives, this may require the adoption of limited military strategy, including the disinclination to pursue a battle of annihilation.</p>
<p>In the <a href="../../../g/u/l/Gulf_War_bc7b.html" title="Gulf War">Gulf War</a>, the Allied (mostly American) forces could have sought and won a battle of annihilation against the <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iraqi_Republican_Guard_a650.html" title="Iraqi Republican Guard">Iraqi Republican Guard</a>. It was decided, however, that the annihilation of the Republican Guard might have led to the dissolution of the Iraqi state, not a desired political objective.</p>
<p>Some historians have speculated that Hitler declined to seek the destruction of the British army at <a href="../../../d/u/n/Dunkirk.html" title="Dunkirk">Dunkirk</a> in 1940 for political reasons -- to show magnimity by allowing the British to withdraw, facilitating a political end to the war. (This is disputed -- other historians feel that Hitler simply wanted to avoid the risk to his armored formations that a battle of annihilation would have required.)</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_annihilation.html" title="Edit section: After Napoleon">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">After Napoleon</span></h2>
<p>Napoleon's victories at <a href="../../../a/u/s/Austerlitz.html" title="Austerlitz">Austerlitz</a> (1805) and <a href="../../../j/e/n/Jena.html" title="Jena">Jena</a> (1806) are often cited as the classic battles of annihilation. Napoleon himself was unable to again achieve such decisive results, partly due to his enemies' adjusting to his tactics. For example, <a href="../../../b/o/r/Borodino.html" title="Borodino">Borodino</a>, while a victory, did not result in the desired destruction of the Russian army.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, post-Napoleonic strategists, most notably <a href="../../../c/l/a/Clausewitz.html" title="Clausewitz">Clausewitz</a>, held the Napoleonic battle of annihilation to be the proper objective of modern military campaigns. This interpretation is contested, though, by <a href="../../../l/i/d/Liddell_Hart_9304.html" title="Liddell Hart">Liddell Hart</a>, who claims in <i>Strategy</i> that a poor choice of words by Clausewitz led his interpreters to overestimate the value of annihilation battles.<sup id="_ref-Hart_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Hart" title="">[1]</a></sup> Consequently, at the beginning of the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Civil_War_90af.html" title="American Civil War">American Civil War</a>, many top military commanders, expected a battle of annihilation to quickly end the war. This did not occur. Already, the size and firepower of armies was making the battle of annihilation harder to achieve.</p>
<p>A contrast may be seen between the Confederate general <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_E._Lee_733b.html" title="Robert E. Lee">Robert E. Lee</a> and the Union general <a href="../../../u/l/y/Ulysses_S._Grant_1b52.html" title="Ulysses S. Grant">Ulysses S. Grant</a>. Lee, when on the offensive, usually maneuvered with the intent of forcing a battle of annihilation. His archetypical attempt was at the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Chancellorsville_6ca4.html" title="Battle of Chancellorsville">Battle of Chancellorsville</a>, where a classic Napoleonic flanking maneuver defeated but was not able to destroy the Union Army under <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joseph_Hooker_211f.html" title="Joseph Hooker">Joseph Hooker</a>.</p>
<p>Lee may be faulted for attempting to achieve a battle of annihilation, particularly at <a href="../../../g/e/t/Gettysburg.html" title="Gettysburg">Gettysburg</a>, in an age when this stratagem was becoming obsolete.</p>
<p>In contrast, Grant was noted for waging campaigns of maneuver. In the <a href="../../../v/i/c/Vicksburg.html" title="Vicksburg">Vicksburg</a> campaign, he forced <a href="../../../p/e/m/Pemberton.html" title="Pemberton">Pemberton</a>'s army into a siege position where it was forced to surrender without a battle.</p>
<p>In the Virginia campaign of 1864 against Lee, he continually maneuvered around Lee, forcing him to withdraw further and further south until he had to choose between abandoning the Confederate capital of Richmond or withdrawing into siege lines.</p>
<p><a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Sherman_6337.html" title="William Sherman">William Sherman</a> may also be cited. Rather than pursuing the chimera of destroying <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Bell_Hood_4e04.html" title="John Bell Hood">Hood</a>'s army, he chose to operate directly against the Confederate economy. His famous march through Georgia, directly <i>away</i> from Hood, was basically the opposite of a Napoleonic strategy.</p>
<p>Thus the quest for a battle of annihilation was not successful during the American Civil War. (A Confederate army was destroyed at the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Nashville_d357.html" title="Battle of Nashville">Battle of Nashville</a>, but this was not battle of annihilation in the sense discussed here; it was simply the overrunning of an already weak and demoralized army.)</p>
<p>The Napoleonic ideal was still alive at the beginning of <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_I_9429.html" title="World War I">World War I</a>. In fact, the Germans were able to execute a battle of annihilation against the Russian 2nd Army at the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Tannenberg_%281914%29_2475.html" title="Battle of Tannenberg (1914)">Battle of Tannenberg</a> in the war's opening weeks. But attempts to create such a result on the <a href="../../../w/e/s/Western_Front_b785.html" title="Western Front">Western Front</a> resulted in great slaughter to no effect. Armies were now too large to have flanks to turn, and had too much firepower and too much defensive depth to be broken by assault.</p>
<p>Since World War I, the paradigm of armies maneuvering in the empty countryside for weeks and then meeting in a battle lasting (usually) a single day no longer applies (at least to wars between <a href="../../../m/a/j/Major_powers.html" title="Major powers">major powers</a>). Instead, armies are deployed in more-or-less continuous lines stretching perhaps hundreds of miles. Thus the battle of annihilation may be considered to be mainly of historical interest, except for secondary campaigns.</p>
