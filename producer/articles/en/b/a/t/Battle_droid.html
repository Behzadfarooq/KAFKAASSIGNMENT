<p>Battle droids are designed to <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human_wave_attack.html" title="Human wave attack">win through numbers</a>, even though a swarm of battle droids can be cut down by only two <a href="../../../j/e/d/Jedi.html" title="Jedi">Jedi Knights</a>. Battle droids are relatively mindless and, while apparently capable of some independent behaviour, are usually slaved to a central control mainframe, disallowing them to think on their own. While this rigid command structure does have serious drawbacks, it also ensures that the battle droids will follow instructions precisely and unquestioningly. It should be noted that in Episode III, pilot droids aboard Grievous' ship can be seen running from Anakin Skywalker when he cut down droids in the control room. It's possible that droids assigned to pilot duty were ordered to avoid the Jedi (or any intruder, for that matter) or that they were programmed to seek weaponry to fight back. It is also possible that high level droids, or droids requiring higher degrees of processing power, including droid commanders and capital ship captians, are independently thinking to allow more flexible tactical options.</p>
<p>Battle droids are frequently controlled by outside devices, which can be located on starships or in other well-defended facilities. The control system is a central point-of-failure: if it is destroyed, the battle droids it controls become inactive. This occurred during the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Naboo_7371.html" title="Battle of Naboo">Battle of Naboo</a>, in which <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anakin_Skywalker_c92f.html" title="Anakin Skywalker">Anakin Skywalker</a> destroyed the <a href="../../../d/r/o/Droid_Control_Ship_270f.html" title="Droid Control Ship">Droid Control Ship</a>. The monumental defeat spurred interest in independent droids, and this technique gained ground following the battle.</p>
<p>Battle droids have speech abilities and can be programmed to have male or female voices. They often acknowledge their orders with the words "Roger, roger."</p>

<p>There are battle droid foundries on the planet <a href="../../../g/e/o/Geonosis.html" title="Geonosis">Geonosis</a> (the factory was intially located on Eos; when this foundry was destroyed by <a href="../../../n/y/m/Nym.html" title="Nym">Nym</a>, production was moved to Geonosis), where Anakin Skywalker and <a href="../../../p/a/d/Padm%C3%A9_Amidala_3a57.html" title="Padmé Amidala">Padmé Amidala</a> were caught during <i><a href="../../../a/t/t/Star_Wars_Episode_II%7E_Attack_of_the_Clones_5ae6.html" title="Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones">Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones</a></i>. It is possible that Battle droids are modeled after the Geonosians, although other sources state they are based on <a href="../../../n/e/i/Neimoidian.html" title="Neimoidian">Neimoidian</a> skeletons. There was also a Battle droid factory on the planet Mustafar, at least during the second Separatist uprising.</p>

<p><b>Pilot droids</b>, also known as <b>Engineer droids</b>, distinguish themselves from their battle droid brethren simply because they are not designed for combat duty. While at a first glance one cannot determine any difference between this class of droid and any other, like most of the Confederacy's droid designs the difference lies within the programming. The Pilot Droid is designed to simply pilot the vehicles and craft of the Confederacy. If they need to protect themselves, they essentially take it upon themselves to attack. They can also provide minor repair capabilities to droid forces on the battle field. With blue shoulder markings, they stand out for their duties. When Pilot droids simply <i>have</i> to fight, they use powerful shotguns. Pilot droids are in <i><a href="../../../b/a/t/Star_Wars%7E_Battlefront_II_981c.html" title="Star Wars: Battlefront II">Star Wars: Battlefront II</a></i>. In this game and its prequel <a href="../../../b/a/t/Star_Wars%7E_Battlefront_b4ad.html" title="Star Wars: Battlefront">Star Wars: Battlefront</a>, pilots are armed with laser shotguns as well as <a href="../../../g/r/e/Grenade.html" title="Grenade">grenade</a> launchers.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_droid.html" title="Edit section: Battle droid commanders">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Battle droid commanders</span></h3>
<p><b>Battle droid commanders</b> are droids in the <a href="../../../d/r/o/Droid_Army_a0b1.html" title="Droid Army">Droid Army</a> that function as the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commissioned_officer.html" title="Commissioned officer">officer</a> class. Battle droid commanders are seen in the prequel trilogy.</p>
<p>Battle droid commanders distinguish themselves by having yellow markings on their head and <a href="../../../a/b/d/Abdomen.html" title="Abdomen">abdomen</a>; otherwise they are superficially identical to standard battle droids. They have greater autonomy and strategic skills when compared to standard battle droids, although they are still ultimately subservient to the Droid Control Ships. They were used by the Trade Federation during the occupation and the Battle of Naboo and, presumably, by the Confederacy of Independent Systems after the Trade Federation lent their support to the CIS during the <a href="../../../c/l/o/Clone_Wars_%28Star_Wars%29_b249.html" title="Clone Wars (Star Wars)">Clone Wars</a>. An example of a battle droid commander is Commander OOM-9, who is seen giving the order to a unit of <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armored_Assault_Tank_4940.html" title="Armored Assault Tank">AATs</a> to open fire on the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Star_Wars_races_%28F-J%29_49e7.html#Gungan" title="List of Star Wars races (F-J)">Gungan</a> shield in <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Phantom_Menace_9257.html" title="The Phantom Menace">The Phantom Menace</a></i> prequel movie. In the novelization of The Phantom Menace, OOM-9, the commander battle droid, is leader of the droid armies during the invasion of Naboo. He reports and responds directly to Nute Gunray and the leaders of the Trade Federation.</p>

<p>The <b>Assault droid</b> is a member of the Confederacy Droid Army, uses missile launchers to destroy the Clone Army's various vehicles such as the AT-TE, LAAT gunships, or the Republic IFT-X Hover Tank. The BAW E-60R is the common weapon used by the Assault Droids. Although not as powerful as the ARC Trooper of the Galactic Republic, the droids are still a threat to the Galactic Republic. Clone Engineers of the Republic learned to stay away and fear its presence on the battlefield. Assault Droids are also equipped with Conner Ship Systems HX2 Mines.</p>

Four super battle droids opening fire</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><b>Super battle droids</b> are upgraded battle droids used by the <a href="../../../t/e/c/Techno_Union_1cd4.html" title="Techno Union">Techno Union</a>. They were first unleashed by the Confederacy of Independent Systems in the Battle Of Geonosis.</p>
<p>One of the main design flaws of the standard B-1 battle droid was its reliance on a Droid Control Ship to provide a signal; if the ship is disabled, the battle droids would become utterly useless. The super battle droid (or B-2) does not rely on such a signal and has a greater capacity for independence, as well as much more aggressive combat intelligence. In the Battle of Geonosis, Super Battle Droids were known to mow down older-model B-1s in order to get a better shot at the enemy (as seen in <a href="../../../a/t/t/Attack_of_the_Clones_7a4d.html" title="Attack of the Clones">Attack of the Clones</a>, a Super Battle Droid shoved a damaged battle droid out of the way) , and could sometimes go berserk by simply shooting its blaster arm faster than a Droideka's. Their frames are larger and more heavily armored (to that of a droideka in certain parts) but remain skeletal to emphasize intimidation. Blasters are mounted on their arms, but they are capable of using certain external weapons, though their large hands make it difficult for them to use smaller <a href="../../../b/l/a/Blasters.html" title="Blasters">blasters</a>. Due to the high cost of manufacturing a new droid, the super battle droid uses some of the same parts as the standard B-1.</p>
<p>Though more advanced than standard battle droids, super battle droids are still no match for the creative intelligence of <a href="../../../c/l/o/Clone_troopers.html" title="Clone troopers">clone troopers</a>, but they were physically far superior to clones--a swat from a super battle droid could smash the skull of a clone without headgear, whereas a clone could hope to do nothing other than hurt his fist should he try the same thing on a super battle droid. Both super battle droids and clone troopers first saw combat at the Battle of Geonosis, and the new B-2 designs proved formidable but ultimately inferior. All of this is mainly due to the CIS giving little effort for its lack of a secondary blaster arm and possibly a wrist rocket launcher.</p>
<p>A second type of super battle droid was produced, the B-2A, which was used for clearing Republic starships and protecting vital assets. These droids were often encountered by Clone Commandos. These droids replaced one arm, with a huge cannon, which was strong enough to cause damage to Katarn armour. These droids were able to utilize an energy shield to protect themselves from Grenade blasts and had more advanced armour which was able to take damage from a DC-17m assault repeater. These droids however had deadly weaknesses, which were exploited by Clone Commandos. They often wore darker armour than the battlefield configuration of the B-2 series.</p>
<p>Tens of thousands of super battle droids saw use throughout <a href="../../../c/l/o/Clone_Wars_%28Star_Wars%29_b249.html" title="Clone Wars (Star Wars)">The Clone Wars</a> as "marines" for the Confederacy along with its smaller cousins and the dreaded Droideka. Though the first Super Battle Droids seen on Geonosis wore an unpainted dull silver tone, many of the droids used in later battles of the Clone Wars were painted a metallic blue, likely to help them stand out from the red coloration the Confederacy used for its standard battle droids.</p>
<p>It is unclear who invented the B-2 battle droid; the Geonosians designed the standard B-1 and even modeled it after themselves. It is believed that the B-2 upgrade (which had some design elements of the B-1) was produced following a deal between <a href="../../../c/o/u/Count_Dooku_e0e0.html" title="Count Dooku">Count Dooku</a> and <a href="../../../p/o/g/Poggle_the_Lesser_35b1.html" title="Poggle the Lesser">Poggle the Lesser</a>, but other sources claim that the Techno Union foreman <a href="../../../w/a/t/Wat_Tambor_08bf.html" title="Wat Tambor">Wat Tambor</a> took the existing design and upgraded it. The Techno Union and its member world of Geonosis are the chief suppliers of both kinds of droids for the Confederacy.</p>
<p>In the PC game <a href="../../../g/a/l/Star_Wars%7E_Galactic_Battlegrounds_317f.html" title="Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds">Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds</a> the super battle droids in the Clone Campaigns expansion pack have robotic voices similar to the older battle droids but much deeper. In Battlefront 2, Super Battle Droids are currently assigned as soldiers although this is pretty debatable when Standard Battle Droids are considered the primary class.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_droid.html" title="Edit section: Droid Sniper">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Droid Sniper</span></h3>
<p>Also known as Assassin droids these droids featured red shoulder markings or camo markings. It is programmed to use the sniper rifle and hunt the enemy's commanders or leaders. It has superb skills and is also programmed to infiltrate the enemy's defenses and command stations. The Droid Sniper is very weak and it can usually be taken out with a few shots from a clone blaster rifle.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_droid.html" title="Edit section: Vulture Droid/Droid Fighter">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Vulture Droid/Droid Fighter</span></h3>
<p>The Vulture Droid is a walker unit that can convert to a flight mode, allowing it to navigate space (much like a starfighter). In fighter mode they have blasters concealed within their wings - these wings unfold into 4 spider-like legs in walking mode. They are large units and, like many other battle droids, they attack through numbers. They first had a brown and tan colour scheme (episode I), then became a light blue (episode III). In <a href="../../../b/a/t/Star_Wars%7E_Battlefront_b4ad.html" title="Star Wars: Battlefront">Star Wars: Battlefront</a>, this droid was a vehicle instead of a playable droid.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_droid.html" title="Edit section: Hailfire Droid">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Hailfire Droid</span></h3>
<p>Used in the Battle for Geonosis, the Hailfire Droid is an artillery droid designed for fast travel. It uses two large hoop-like wheels to navigate terrain, and is armed with shoulder-mounted rocket launchers. The rockets can be identified by the thick black exhaust they leave behind. Like the Vulture, this is a vehicle in Battlefront.</p>

Droidekas in <i><a href="../../../a/t/t/Star_Wars_Episode_II%7E_Attack_of_the_Clones_5ae6.html" title="Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones">Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones</a></i></div>

<p>The <b>Droideka</b>, or <b>Destroyer Droid</b> heavy infantry unit are seen in the prequel films. These droids can transform, appearing first in a "wheel" state allowing rapid movements and easy storage, then unfold into insect-like attack-robots with a slow three-legged gait. In their walking state, Droidekas have powerful twin blasters on each of their arms, extremely accurate in close range and a personal shield generator. The Droidekas used their shield generators in the prequel movies <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/Star_Wars_Episode_I%7E_The_Phantom_Menace_412d.html" title="Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace">The Phantom Menace</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../r/e/v/Revenge_of_the_Sith_bd67.html" title="Revenge of the Sith">Revenge of the Sith</a></i> to protect themselves. These shields make the Droidekas very valuable assets on the battlefield, as they are somewhat impervious to small arms fire (although not strong enough to resist vehicle or starfighter-mounted cannons). Due to their built-in shields and the strength of their blasters, the Droidekas give some Jedi Knights pause. The Droidekas sometimes have limited speech abilities (as seen in Episode III, when they said to Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi on the Invisible Hand: 'Nobodymovenobodymove;' in the script and novel-version of Episode I, the Destroyer Droids that attack Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi inside the Droid Control Ship are shown to have spoken as well, although this is not evident during the actual movie) and their gender would be male or female depending on their programmings, which is similar to the battle droids, but those droids speak in Droid language. They were deployed at <a href="../../../n/a/b/Naboo.html" title="Naboo">Naboo</a>, and Geonosis, and <a href="../../../c/o/r/Coruscant.html" title="Coruscant">Coruscant</a>, and are mainly the property of the Trade Federation and the Confederacy of Independent Systems.</p>
<p>Destroyer Droids actually come in two series: Heavy Units (shielded) and Infantry Units. Infantry Units are not produced with shields because tactically their shields can be of hindrance to their own infantry trying to fire at the enemy, and also to drastically reduce cost. 40 Infantry Type Droidekas can be transported in the Open Chamber type MTT. The Droideka can fire up to 240 dual blasts a minute (unless their system for their blaster arms features overheating) making it virtually impossible for enemy infantry to defeat a squad of them in good time (even if they aren't shielded). However, it's recommended that the droidekas' opponents "circle" around them or go directly close to them and between their twin blasters; they can't hit their foes. In The Phantom Menace, when the droids are first seen, they drop their shields as they pursue the fleeing Jedi. This was either because the shield was a hindrance to movement, or because they were attacking a fleeing enemy with no way of attack.</p>

<p>According to the <a href="../../../e/x/p/Expanded_Universe_%28Star_Wars%29_acd4.html" title="Expanded Universe (Star Wars)">expanded universe</a>, the original design was developed by the insectoid people of Colla IV, who were displeased by the limitations of Baktoid Combat Automata's basic battle droids, and chiefly manufactured there. The Trade Federation, and presumably the Confederacy, used trading in rare meats as a way to ease bargaining with the ravenously carnivorous Colicoids, and were able to get special rates on these special infantry droids. Before the Federation's defeat at Battle of Naboo, these droids were usually slaved to a central computer, although this technique fell out of favor in the aftermath of this battle. Although the droids are not shown en masse in the films (mainly <i>Attack of the Clones</i> and <i>Revenge of the Sith</i>), they were still mass-produced (in comparable numbers to Super Battle Droids) with full specifications. A Droideka made a rare post-prequel era appearance in <a href="../../../s/u/r/Survivor%27s_Quest_2448.html" title="Survivor's Quest">Survivor's Quest</a>, where it proved a formidable opponent for <a href="../../../l/u/k/Luke_Skywalker_d1fc.html" title="Luke Skywalker">Luke Skywalker</a> and his wife, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mara_Jade_a09f.html" title="Mara Jade">Mara Jade</a>.</p>

<p>The <b>IG Lancer droid</b> is tall (1.96 meters), black, and lanky in appearance, with numerous red optics on its pointed cylindrical head and having pointed shoulders, giving it a medieval look. The IG Lancer Droid, mounted on a speeder bike, uses molecularly sharpened lances to cut through heavy armor, such as that found on the <a href="../../../a/t/-/AT-TE_a8c4.html" title="AT-TE">AT-TE</a>. During the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Muunilinst_3e7e.html" title="Battle of Muunilinst">Battle of Muunilinst</a>, the Gen'Dai bounty hunter, <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minor_bounty_hunters_in_Star_Wars_cb65.html" title="Minor bounty hunters in Star Wars">Durge</a>, deployed a battalion of IG lancers to destroy the Republic's <a href="../../../s/p/h/SPHA-T_cd3c.html" title="SPHA-T">SPHA-T</a> walkers. Their appearance foreshadows the <a href="../../../i/g/-/IG-88_da8e.html" title="IG-88">IG-88</a> <a href="../../../b/o/u/Bounty_hunter.html" title="Bounty hunter">bounty hunter</a> seen in <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/Star_Wars_Episode_V%7E_The_Empire_Strikes_Back_3943.html" title="Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back">The Empire Strikes Back</a></i>.</p>
<p>As an InterGalactic Banking Clan asset, the tall, thin assassin droids were created in the image of the gaunt Muuns that developed them. They had quicker response time and were considered to be more lethal than the standard Baktoid droids, and possibly Super Battle Droids and Droidekas, which were used by the Trade Federation. Working with the military advice of bounty hunter Durge, the Banking Clan armed the droids with power lances and anti-vehicle mines, and deployed them on speeder bikes as homeworld security around the commerce citadels of Muunilinst.</p>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_droid.html" title="Edit section: History">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h4>
<p>As moneylenders to many of the most advanced technology firms in the galaxy, the <a href="../../../i/n/t/InterGalactic_Banking_Clan_b04b.html" title="InterGalactic Banking Clan">InterGalactic Banking Clan</a> had at its disposal the latest high-tech weapons to turn against the Republic during the Clone Wars. Phlut Design Systems, a Muunilinst-based weapons development firm, took out a sizable capital investment loan from the IBC to fund a secret battle droid program that it hoped to sell to the Trade Federation. When PDS was unable to make payments on the loan, the IBC responded by seizing the assets of the company, and, ironically, added the IG-series droids to the new Confederacy of Independent Systems army.</p>

<p>The elite <b>MagnaGuard</b> is a droid built to specifications provided by General Grievous. They wield electrostaffs, which cannot be cut through with a lightsaber, have reflexes "operating at almost the speed of light" and shoot electricity or mini-missiles out of both ends. Nute Gunray, the head of the Trade Federation claims that these droids cost a fortune to make unlike any droid created from the past. These droids were used during the end of the Clone Wars. On Kashyyyk, Delta Squad had to battle these droids, learning that they had remarkable acrobatic ability and superb stamina.</p>
<p>MagnaGuards were also are seen in <i>Episode III: Revenge of the Sith</i> and during the Battle of Coruscant, they fought Obi-Wan and Anakin on the bridge of the <i>Invisible Hand</i>. Later on, four of them attacked Obi-Wan at Utapau but were defeated before they could strike a blow when Obi-Wan used the Force to drop part of the roof on them. Throughout the Clone Wars, one can conclude that MagnaGuards were superior to any infantry droid ever made because of their superior duranium armor, their ability to "feel" what surrounded them, backup processors, and their ability to wield a variety of deadly weapons as well as fight like the Jedi. Unlike the other droids, this one can still fight if its head was cut off as if their head wasn't cut off.</p>
