<p>This statement is so harsh that it needs to be backed up.

<p>The article states: <i>individual Scientologists were reportedly also ordered to buy copies of the book</i> and later that article re-states, <i>According to Miller, Scientologists throughout the United States were instructed to go out and buy at least two or three copies each.[11]</i> and the second instance of Scientologists being "ordered" or "instructed" is cited. However, the first instance of Scientologists being "ordered" is uncited. I frankly don't believe anyone could find, anywhere, an instance of any Scientology organization "ordering" any Scientologist, ever, to "buy a copy of a book". I believe that is utterly false information. Now I realize the article was created to convey a criticsm of Scientology, but nonetheless, it should be cited according to <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a>. Specifically a line stating that individual Scientologists were ordered to do something, then who was ordered, who did the ordering, was it in writing or by word of mouth, and any additional information should be placed into the article, citing such an order. Myself, I'm pretty sure that is another of the google group rumors. <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerryeo_a180.html" title="User:Terryeo">Terryeo</a> 14:49, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That's a rather frivolous objection. Basically, you are calling a claim "uncited" even though you yourself are pointing to the citation that supports it just a few sentences away. Or are you claiming that it's possible for "According to Miller, Scientologists throughout the United States were instructed to go out and buy at least two or three copies each" to be true, and "individual Scientologists were reportedly also ordered to buy copies of the book" to be false? -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 01:00, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hmmmm, a voluntary organization cannot be ordered about? Then I guess we'll have to revise the description of the Church of Scientology to make it clear that it is no way a "voluntary organization" -- if it was, then L. Ron Hubbard would never have issued so many Ethics Orders. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 16:17, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><i>individual Scientologists were reportedly ordered to buy copies of the book</i>. Who <b>reported</b> they were ordered? Ordered by whom?How many were ordered? What reliable publication which we can verify <b>Ordered</b> individual Scientologists to buy copies of the book&#160;? Do you see now how a statement appears which is uncited? The sentence is jarring because it goes against the freedoms espoused by the Church it its various declarations. As we all know, one's participation in religion is (at least in the western world) voluntary. <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerryeo_a180.html" title="User:Terryeo">Terryeo</a> 20:05, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Your objection hinges upon the idea that the word "ordered" can only be interpreted according to one particular narrow definition, which is not the case. Even if it <i>were</i> the case, which it is not, and even if the numerous "Ethics Orders" issued by LRH didn't make the idea that the Church of Scientology has never "ordered" anyone to do anything ludicrous, your idea that no one <i>can be</i> "ordered" to do anything in a "voluntary organization" is quaint and naive. Can that "voluntary organization" exact substantial penalties for disobedience if you do not follow their instruction? Then it is not an instruction, but an order. If you are told to get your stats up or be assigned to the RPF, it's an order. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 01:25, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Terryeo's comments about a "voluntary organisation" are somewhat fanciful - the CoS may be voluntary but adherence to its rules and instructions certainly isn't. (The same would be true for just about any workplace.) Note Bent Corydon's cited statement in the article: "We were ordered to sell 1000 copies of Hubbard's recently released science-fiction book Battlefield Earth "before Thursday" or I would be kicked out as mission holder." This testifies to actual coercion being used. -- <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisO_f9d7.html" title="User:ChrisO">ChrisO</a> 08:02, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>The only thing presently voluntary about the cofs is joining it. Even auditing and training now are "regged" for using very coercive tactics.

<p>I recall the Battlefield Earth campaign quite well. I would not use the word "ordered". "Instructed" or "cajoled" or "strongly urged" would be accurate as a description for the tactics that were used to sell that series. Int management made use of cofs public "opinion leaders" to push this campaign.I ignored that insane crap and those who promoted it. --<a href="../../../f/a/h/User%7EFahrenheit451_16ab.html" title="User:Fahrenheit451">Fahrenheit451</a> 02:33, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>OK, I've changed the wording to "urged" per your suggestion. I think it's sufficiently loose to blur the distinction between a request and an order, as it covers both possibilities. -- <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisO_f9d7.html" title="User:ChrisO">ChrisO</a> 08:02, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>RE:The word "Psychlo" is revealed to have originally meant "mental patient" in the alien language. Well in my copy Psychlo is stated to mean "brain,' according to some old dictionaries. Another form of the word also means 'property of"</p>
<p>Also I dont think Soth is a "supporting" character, I dont know what else to refer to him as, but he only has a very very small part right at the end. And again "his mother who was a member of a resistance group, a so-called "church," the actaul line in the book is "I used to think it was because my mother was a member of an underground church group. They believed that sentient creatures had souls and they felt very strongly about it.", which if you see has no reference to "Resistance group". It was Kers "Adoptive Father" who was in a resistance group. I dont know if Scientology thinks that animals have souls, but that is what Soth is stating his Mother belived YOurs H&amp;K</p>
