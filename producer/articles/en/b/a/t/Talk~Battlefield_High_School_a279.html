Uh... not too sure how the importance thing is done... but I put this up here because I was reading one of the wikipedia projects was to include all the information from other encyclopedia's. Near this was an article saying that facebook.com submitted like 20,000 High Schools to Wikipedia that still needed to be documented. I was simply documenting one of them.</p>
<p>Important? *shrug* I was just trying to help I guess. --<a href="../../../d/a/m/User%7EDamDisIsShiznats_dfa7.html" title="User:DamDisIsShiznats">Nate D</a> 07:28, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Battlefield High School operates on an alternating block schedule, rotating between Purple and Black days. (These are the two primary school colors of the Bobcats.)</p>
<p>Purple Days include "even" periods. You can remember this because "purple" has an even number of letters. (Six.) Purple Days include classes during periods 1, 2, 4, and 6.</p>
<p>Black Days include "odd" periods. You can remember this because "black" has an odd number of letters. (Five.) Black Days include classes during periods 1, 3, 5, and 7.</p>
<p>Key times are announced by electronic signal bell broadcast over the public address system. The bell schedule follows below for the 2006-2007 school year. This is changed from the 2005-2006 school year.</p>
<p>7:13 - Warning Bell 7:20 - First Period begins 8:20 - First Period ends 8:26 - Second / Third Period begins 9:56 - Second / Third Period ends 10:02 - Fourth / Fifth period begins 12:12 - Fourth / Fifth period ends 12:18 - Sixth / Seventh period begins 1:50 - Sixth / Seventh period ends, school is dismissed</p>
<p>Morning announcements begin at 7:20 each day, first conducted by P.A. system by foreign language teacher Ms. Byers, and usually followed Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday by the daily television broadcast by BCTV, the Bobcat Television Network. These televised announcements include news, information, events, instructions, public service announcements, and student-produced content from both instructional classes and from the BCTV production team.</p>
<p>Afternoon announcements generally take place by P.A. system at approximately 1:48 each day, and are generally conducted by Assistant Principal Warner.</p>
<p>Lunches are conducted between 10:02 and 12:12 during Fourth / Fifth period. There are four lunches, labeled A through D, held in the Commons Area and Enclosed Dining Room on the first floor. A Lunch attends the meal for the first half hour of the period, and attends class for the last 90 minutes. B and C lunches split class, attending class first, then leaving for the meal, before returning to class, for a total of 90 minutes of instruction. D Lunch attends class for the first 90 minutes, and is then released to the meal for the final half hour.</p>

<p>I've added the latest VDOE information and have updated quite a few statstics based on recent conversations with guidance and documentation from staff members. Hopefully 2006-2007 data will start to roll in and we can get this page updated ahead of even VDOE web resources, though I can only keep my fingers crossed! I also added staff information for several programs, to mirror the format used with (for example) the JROTC section. This provides points-of-contact for information verification... and that's a "wiked" good thing! <a href="../../../b/h/s/User%7EBhs_itrt_7eca.html" title="User:Bhs itrt">Bhs itrt</a> 14:25, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>PWCS asked BHS to submit information to update the county's "splash pages" for high school vital information, and some of that information has been included here. Specifically, the communities served by Battlefield, updated staff statistics, and a more detailed description of the school's location and region have been included. <a href="../../../b/h/s/User%7EBhs_itrt_7eca.html" title="User:Bhs itrt">Bhs itrt</a> 14:24, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I took a quick look at the article and it is well-written in an <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">objective style</a>, and contains some good information. Great pictures, also: they add a lot to the article. Here's some suggested areas to look at to ensure it conforms to WP style guidelines. Some of these issues are significant enough (especially in the areas of <a href="../../../a/t/t/Wikipedia%7EAttribution_916a.html" title="Wikipedia:Attribution">references</a>) that they should be addressed ASAP to retain an "A" rating.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Infobox</b> — great job on the Infobox design, but consider using one of the existing templates for this, such as {{<a href="../../../i/n/f/Template%7EInfobox_Education_in_the_United_States_e8a1.html" title="Template:Infobox Education in the United States">Template:Infobox Education in the United States</a>}}. This makes it easier for editors unfamiliar with html and wiki mark-up to update the box's info.</li>
<li><b>References</b> — all information, especially statistics, needs to be referenced. This makes it <a href="../../../a/t/t/Wikipedia%7EAttribution_916a.html" title="Wikipedia:Attribution">verifiable</a> and also easy for other editors to update data — such as AYP, census and SOL info — that changes year-to-year. Make sure ALL sources are <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources">cited</a>. Using the standard <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECitation_templates_28d4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citation templates">templates</a> should make this easy for all editors to maintain.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Also, a "Footnotes and references" section should be added at the end of the article. The notes will automatically be formatted and listed if the citation templates are used with the &lt;ref&gt; {cite} &lt;/ref&gt; tags.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><b>Images</b> — remove the size parameter and just use the "thumb" argument. This allows automatic resizing according to the viewers preferences. Example:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>[[Image:BRHS Ethnic Breakdown Graph.JPG|<b>thumb</b>|right|Broad Run Ethnicity Analysis — 2006/2007]]</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Also, try varying the image positioning a bit just for aesthetics (alternate left/right every now and then). Do not group them together at the beginning of the section — this disrupts the text flow of the page (that's why there are blank areas in the article).</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><b>Address forms</b> — don't use addresses. For instance, don't refer to a principal or teacher as "Mr.", "Ms." or "Dr.". For "Dr.", however, add the title after the person's name (<a href="../../../d/o/c/Doctor_of_Education_b13e.html" title="Doctor of Education">Ed. D.</a>).</li>
<li><b>Section headers</b> — Capitalize only the initial word in the section header (unless the word is part of a proper name). For example, "Test Scores" and "Facility Design" should be "Test scores" and "Facility design".</li>
<li><b>Dates</b> — format dates with wikilinks. If a date includes both a month and a day, then the date should almost always be linked to allow readers' date preferences to work, displaying the reader's chosen format. The day and the month should be linked together, and the year should be linked separately if present. For example:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Month and day
<dl>
<dd>[[February 17]] → February 17</dd>
<dd>[[17 February]] → February 17</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Day, month, and year
<dl>
<dd>[[February 17]], [[1958]] → February 17, 1958</dd>
<dd>[[17 February]] [[1958]] → February 17, 1958</dd>
<dd>[[1958-02-17]] → February 17, 1958</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Also, the <b>Lead</b> should be beefed up. It should summarize the information in the article, and be interesting enough to draw the casual reader into the rest of the article (and identify what makes it notable).</li>
</ul>
<p>For an example take a look at <a href="../../../b/r/o/Broad_Run_High_School_1e8c.html" title="Broad Run High School">Broad Run High School</a>. This article took a lot of effort to bring to GA status, much less A. It's not perfect (yet), but conforms to WP Style guidelines and is organized pretty much as suggested by <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Schools_9658.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Schools">WikiProject Schools</a> (including an standard Infobox and a good Lead).</p>
<p>I hope this helps. Feel free to leave any questions or comments on my Talk page. Good article.</p>

<p>Thanks so much for the advice! I've taken the liberty of making as many of your suggested changes as I can for the time being, and will continue to work on compiling sources. A lot of the statistical data is material we generate in-house, so I'll try to get some of our printouts compiled into an actual "report" to keep on file, and in that way can serve as a primary source document.</p>
<p>Formatting-wise and policy-compliance-wise, I certainly see the significant improvements! THANKS!</p>

This does not reflect an actual <i>degradation</i> of it, but places it where it should have originally been <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVersion_1.0_Editorial_Team_Assessment_0e4d.html" title="Wikipedia:Version 1.0 Editorial Team/Assessment">assessed</a>.</p>
<p>The article is still in need of cites (especially third-party) and should draw upon WikiProject Schools as a guideline for <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Schools_9658.html#Structure" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Schools">format and structure</a>. Although not explicitly required, a path through "GA" nomination (and review) on its way to an "A" assessment is a good idea. Excellent progress has been made in the past week or so!</p>

<p>Firstly, I can totally appreciate the issue of moving the images to the gallery. While I agree with Jim's assessment that photographic images of this nature add tremendously to getting the sense of a location (particularly as Wikipedia has an obligation to take advantage of the multimedia environment in which it exists), I can fully appreciate Phoenix's perspective from an article-formatting standpoint.</p>
<p>Secondly, as an educator, I have to give full reinforcement to Jim's comments. A grade that isn't "perfect" (not that there is such a thing) isn't a slander, but a vehicle for growth. A clear set of criteria has been established by the WikiSchools project, and that serves as the "rubric" by which editors (myself included) can judge progress and plan future work, not only on this article, but others. In education, we too frequently see people (or we ourselves) get wrapped up in "if it's not A, it's F" mentality.</p>
<p>Particularly with an article about a SCHOOL, I'm glad to see a thoughtful participation in assessment... not grade inflation!</p>

<p>The copyright tag was corrected and the image restored. This was apparently an oversight on my part as the original uploader. I do not recall using a tag that failed to specify the appropriate use, but apparently I did the first time. Oops!</p>
