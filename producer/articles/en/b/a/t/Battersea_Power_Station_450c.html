<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/t/Battersea_Power_Station_450c.html" title="Edit section: Background">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Background</span></h2>
<p>During the <a href="../../../1/9/3/1930s.html" title="1930s">1930s</a> electricity was supplied by small companies that built stations dedicated to a single industry or group of factories, and sold any excess power to the public.</p>
<p>Due to differing standards of voltage and frequency, <a href="../../../u/k/_/UK_Parliament_33da.html" title="UK Parliament">Parliament</a> decided that the power grid should be a single system under public ownership. This sparked a storm of protest from those who thought that the government should not be involved. It would be another 30 years before nationalization was completed.</p>
<p>Meanwhile several private power companies reacted to the proposals by forming the <b>London Power Company</b> in <a href="../../../1/9/2/1925.html" title="1925">1925</a>. Their plan was to build a smaller number of very large stations and sell the power to anyone who wanted it. Their first power station was planned for the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battersea.html" title="Battersea">Battersea</a> area on the south bank of the <a href="../../../r/i/v/River_Thames_9174.html" title="River Thames">River Thames</a> in <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/t/Battersea_Power_Station_450c.html" title="Edit section: Architecture">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Architecture</span></h2>
<p>This sparked off protests from those who felt the building was too large and would be an eyesore, and from those who were worried about the pollution. The company addressed the former by hiring Sir <a href="../../../g/i/l/Giles_Gilbert_Scott_3ab8.html" title="Giles Gilbert Scott">Giles Gilbert Scott</a>, a noted architect and industrial designer (also famous for the design of the <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_telephone_box.html" title="Red telephone box">red telephone box</a>, of <a href="../../../l/i/v/Liverpool_Cathedral_9efc.html" title="Liverpool Cathedral">Liverpool Cathedral</a>, and also another London power station, <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bankside_Power_Station_b362.html" title="Bankside Power Station">Bankside</a>, which now houses the <a href="../../../t/a/t/Tate_Modern_788e.html" title="Tate Modern">Tate Modern</a> art gallery).</p>
<p>The resulting design is a steel-framed building with brickwork hung from the outside, similar to the skyscrapers being built in the US at the time. Construction started in 1929 and was completed by 1939. The original power station had a single long hall with a chimney at either end. From 1953 to 1955 a second <i>Station B</i>, identical from the outside, was constructed alongside the original, which then became known as <i>Station A</i>. This gave the station its familiar four-chimney layout. Far from being an eyesore, the station has since become one of London's most famous landmarks and is generally loved.</p>
<p>The power station was the site of a fire on <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_20.html" title="April 20">April 20</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/6/1964.html" title="1964">1964</a>, which caused power failures throughout London including at the <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_a61d.html" title="BBC">BBC</a> Television Centre, which was slated to launch <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_Two_4086.html" title="BBC Two">BBC Two</a> that night. The launch was delayed until the following day at 11am.</p>

<p>After the end of the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">Second World War</a> the London Power Company took the opportunity to introduce a new innovation - a district heating scheme better known now as <a href="../../../c/o/g/Cogeneration.html" title="Cogeneration">Cogeneration</a>. Some 11,000 people benefitted from the scheme which provided hot water and central heating to the newly redeveloped areas within <a href="../../../p/i/m/Pimlico.html" title="Pimlico">Pimlico</a>.</p>

<p>When it first opened, the station had a 105 <a href="../../../m/e/g/Megawatt.html" title="Megawatt">megawatt</a> steam turbine. At the time, this was the largest in Europe. After World War II this was enlarged to approximately 500 MW. In the 1950s, 60 MW was considered to be 'large' for UK stations. Power stations' output continued to grow and this factor, coupled with increased operating costs (Battersea required flue gas cleaning) led to its demise. In <a href="../../../1/9/7/1975.html" title="1975">1975</a> Station A (by then quite out of date) was shut down, with rumours that Station B would soon follow. Intense public pressure mounted to save the buildings, notably Station A's <a href="../../../a/r/t/Art_Deco_3600.html" title="Art Deco">Art Deco</a> interior. In <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980.html" title="1980">1980</a> the station was declared a heritage site, and in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1983.html" title="1983">1983</a> production at Station B ended.</p>

Inside Battersea Power Station, Oct 2006</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Up to November 2006, the power station was owned by <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parkview_International_01e7.html" title="Parkview International">Parkview International</a>, who had started work on a <a href="../../../p/o/u/Pound_sterling.html" title="Pound sterling">£1.1bn</a> project to restore the 75 year old building and to redevelop the 38 acre site, in one of the largest privately owned development projects in the UK. Parkview, a company headquartered in <a href="../../../h/o/n/Hong_Kong_6282.html" title="Hong Kong">Hong Kong</a>, is one of the largest overseas investors in urban regeneration. At a public meeting in June 2004, a representative of Parkview claimed that they had spent £100m on the <a href="../../../r/e/d/Redevelopment.html" title="Redevelopment">redevelopment</a> so far. However this claim was disputed by Battersea Power Station Community Group as no conservation and repair work had been carried out on the building since Parkview took control of the site in 1993. The condition of the building is described as "very bad" by <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_Heritage_58b3.html" title="English Heritage">English Heritage</a>, who have included it on their register of Buildings at Risk.</p>
<p>Parkview's plan included <a href="../../../r/e/s/Restaurant.html" title="Restaurant">restaurants</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/t/Retail.html" title="Retail">retail</a>, <a href="../../../m/o/v/Movie_theatre.html" title="Movie theatre">cinemas</a> and a massive cultural and commercial entertainment and events centre within the Power Station as well as new buildings comprising two hotels, a theatre, flats, offices, showrooms and a £26m scheme to modernise and upgrade nearby <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battersea_Park_railway_station_8aa6.html" title="Battersea Park railway station">Battersea Park railway station</a>. The design for the new scheme was by Grimshaws Architects and <a href="../../../b/u/r/Buro_Happold_9b39.html" title="Buro Happold">Buro Happold</a>.</p>
<p>Battersea Power Station Community Group has campaigned for an alternative community-based scheme to be drawn up. The Group is sceptical that Parkview will deliver its redevelopment project, and that the benefits claimed for Parkview's scheme - improved local transport <a href="../../../i/n/f/Infrastructure.html" title="Infrastructure">infrastructure</a>, thousands of new jobs, large public spaces and opening up the riverside, leisure and recreation amenities as well as the transformation of an industrial monument - are an illusion. BPSCG describe Parkview's plans as "a deeply unattractive project that has no affordable housing anywhere on the 38-acre site, no decent jobs for local people and no credible public transport strategy". The group also says "... this is just the last in a long line of planning applications from Parkview going back over 10 years that have gone nowhere. We fear that Parkview is merely proposing unrealisable projects while the value of the land increases and the power station crumbles."</p>
<p>Conversely, the Battersea Power Station Community Forum which represents the interests of more than fifty local organisations including elected offices, the Council, residents associations, places of worship, educational establishments, business and amenity groups enthusiastically support Parkview’s plans for regeneration. The Forum was established by Parkview, and local people who are critical of Parkview's lack of progress and neglect of the listed building are not allowed to attend.</p>
<p>An independent <a href="../../../e/n/v/Environmental_impact_assessment.html" title="Environmental impact assessment">environmental impact assessment</a> conducted by <a href="../../../a/r/u/Arup.html" title="Arup">Arup</a> Associates had forecast that the project would be responsible for creating some 6,000 (full time equivalent) new jobs and that nearly 3,500 of these would go to people living within the locality. At the launch of a recruitment office in July 2005, the then <a href="../../../s/e/c/Secretary_of_State_for_Work_and_Pensions_5e06.html" title="Secretary of State for Work and Pensions">Secretary of State for Work and Pensions</a> <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Blunkett_4667.html" title="David Blunkett">David Blunkett</a>, said: "This development is good news for the people of East Battersea, indeed the whole of London."</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chancellor_of_the_Exchequer_78e8.html" title="Chancellor of the Exchequer">Chancellor of the Exchequer</a> <a href="../../../g/o/r/Gordon_Brown_e90d.html" title="Gordon Brown">Gordon Brown</a>, <a href="../../../s/e/c/Secretary_of_State_for_Education_and_Skills_833e.html" title="Secretary of State for Education and Skills">Secretary of State for Education and Skills</a> <a href="../../../r/u/t/Ruth_Kelly_017c.html" title="Ruth Kelly">Ruth Kelly</a> and Education Minister <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Rammell_e850.html" title="Bill Rammell">Bill Rammell</a> visited the Power Station in March 2006 to launch a joint venture between developers Parkview International, their construction manager Bovis Lend Lease, the Learning and Skills Council, Lambeth College and <a href="../../../w/a/n/Wandsworth_Council_ae73.html" title="Wandsworth Council">Wandsworth Council</a> to provide onsite training for students learning building skills. Speaking at the event the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Gordon Brown, said “this is exactly the sort of project that we want to see more of - one which develops the skills of young people and adults, and where employers are investing in their workforces. I would like to thank Lambeth College, Job Centre Plus, Bovis Lendlease and Parkview International and look forward to visiting you all in a few years time when this project is complete."</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_13.html" title="October 13">13 October</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>, Wandsworth Council approved Parkview's plan to demolish and then rebuild the power station's chimneys. Despite an engineers' report which found that the existing chimneys could be repaired, Parkview, English Heritage and the <a href="../../../l/o/n/London_Borough_of_Wandsworth_feaa.html" title="London Borough of Wandsworth">London Borough of Wandsworth</a> claim the chimneys are structurally unsound and irreparable. Parkview claims to have given a legally binding undertaking to the London Borough of Wandsworth to provide certainty that the chimneys will be replaced like for like in accordance with the requirements of English Heritage and the planning authorities. However, campaigners have pointed to the fact that as Parkview is registered in the British Virgin Islands, the council would not be able to enforce the legal agreement. Further concerns have been raised as the Wandsworth Borough Solicitor, when questioned by Wandsworth Council's planning applications committee members, was not able to give an assurance that a watertight legal agreement to rebuild the chimneys could be made with an offshore company.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_30.html" title="November 30">30 November</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>, it was announced that Real Estate Opportunities, led by Irish businessmen Richard Barrett and Johnny Ronan, had purchased Battersea Power Station and the surrounding land for <a href="../../../e/u/r/Euro.html" title="Euro">€595m</a>. It is unclear what impact this transaction will have on the redevelopment plans.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>

It also appears on the cover of Jan Hammer's 12" single of <i>The Runner (marathon mix).</i> The photograph on the sleeve of <i><a href="../../../q/u/a/Quark%2C_Strangeness_and_Charm_f9c4.html" title="Quark, Strangeness and Charm">Quark, Strangeness and Charm</a></i> by <a href="../../../h/a/w/Hawkwind.html" title="Hawkwind">Hawkwind</a> is of the power station's control room. The station also appears in the 1997 music video by American pop band <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hanson.html" title="Hanson">Hanson</a> for the song <i>Where's The Love</i></p>
<p>It was a setting in <a href="../../../a/l/f/Alfred_Hitchcock_0cee.html" title="Alfred Hitchcock">Alfred Hitchcock</a>'s 1936 film <i><a href="../../../s/a/b/Sabotage_%28movie%29.html" title="Sabotage (movie)">Sabotage</a></i>. It appeared for a moment in the British <i><a href="../../../d/o/c/Doctor_Who_d5fc.html" title="Doctor Who">Doctor Who</a></i> television science fiction series in <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Dalek_Invasion_of_Earth_51a4.html" title="The Dalek Invasion of Earth">The Dalek Invasion of Earth</a></i> in 1963, which saw the station in the 22nd century, having been converted to nuclear power. It appeared briefly in <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Beatles_3737.html" title="The Beatles">The Beatles'</a> 1965 film <i><a href="../../../h/e/l/Help%21_%28film%29.html" title="Help! (film)">Help!</a></i>, and many years later the interior was seen in the "Find The Fish" segment of <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monty_Python%27s_Flying_Circus_5f2b.html" title="Monty Python's Flying Circus">Monty Python's</a> <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Meaning_Of_Life_3b99.html" title="The Meaning Of Life">The Meaning Of Life</a></i>. Battersea Power Station was also used as the façade for the <a href="../../../m/i/n/Ministry_of_Love_57e9.html" title="Ministry of Love">Ministry of Love</a> in <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Radford_e8ed.html" title="Michael Radford">Michael Radford</a>'s <a href="../../../1/9/8/1984_%28film%29.html" title="1984 (film)">1984 film</a> of <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Orwell_0bc4.html" title="George Orwell">George Orwell</a>'s <i><a href="../../../n/i/n/Nineteen_Eighty-Four_808a.html" title="Nineteen Eighty-Four">Nineteen Eighty-Four</a></i>. The streets surrounding the Power Station and its interior were also used in <i>Cry Havoc</i>, a 1991 episode of the long running police drama, <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Bill_cabc.html" title="The Bill">The Bill</a></i>.</p>
<p>The station (rather unconvincingly) stood in for an Eastern European military camp in the <i><a href="../../../m/a/c/MacGyver_d762.html" title="MacGyver">MacGyver</a></i> TV movie <i>The Lost Treasure of Atlantis</i>, and it appeared briefly in the background of an episode of the ABC television series <a href="../../../l/o/s/Lost_%28TV_series%29_c407.html" title="Lost (TV series)"><i>Lost</i></a> entitled <a href="../../../e/p/i/Episodes_of_Lost_%28season_2%29_3c0f.html#Fire_.2B_Water" title="Episodes of Lost (season 2)">"Fire + Water"</a>. Originating from a statement in the official Lost Podcast, controversy surrounded the signage which appeared on the building, as it was believed to be a huge clue for future episodes. The building was also used as inspiration for the "Advanced Power Plant" structure in the PC game <a href="../../../r/e/d/Command_%26_Conquer%7E_Red_Alert_807a.html" title="Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert">Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert</a>. It was rented by <a href="../../../b/r/u/Bruce_Dickinson_67d9.html" title="Bruce Dickinson">Bruce Dickinson</a> to be a film location of three of his videos, but only appeared in one, "Man Of Sorrows", in 1999.</p>
<p>In recent years the building has occasionally played host to concerts and to performances by the <a href="../../../c/i/r/Cirque_du_Soleil_fe99.html" title="Cirque du Soleil">Cirque du Soleil</a> (in a nearby marquee). In <a href="../../../i/a/n/Ian_McKellen_4f6f.html" title="Ian McKellen">Ian McKellen</a>'s <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_III_%281995_film%29_a763.html" title="Richard III (1995 film)">film</a> of <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Shakespeare_c1d2.html" title="William Shakespeare">Shakespeare</a>'s <i><a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_III_%28play%29_1944.html" title="Richard III (play)">Richard III</a></i>, the derelict power station surreally stands in for Bosworth Field in Richard's final battle scene.</p>
<p>During <a href="../../../p/i/n/Pink_Floyd_f331.html" title="Pink Floyd">Pink Floyd</a>'s 2005 <a href="../../../l/i/v/Live_8.html" title="Live 8">Live 8</a> performance, during the song "Money", Battersea was briefly shown when the camera panned out away from the stage.</p>
<p>The power station made a reappearance in <i><a href="../../../d/o/c/Doctor_Who_d5fc.html" title="Doctor Who">Doctor Who</a></i> in the 2006 series. In the episode <i><a href="../../../r/i/s/Rise_of_the_Cybermen_0d45.html" title="Rise of the Cybermen">Rise of the Cybermen</a></i> (set on a "<a href="../../../p/a/r/Parallel_Earth_6f8d.html" title="Parallel Earth">parallel Earth</a>") it is used by Cybus Industries as a factory which upgrades people into <a href="../../../c/y/b/Cybermen.html" title="Cybermen">Cybermen</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../a/l/f/Alfonso_Cuar%C3%B3n_6fea.html" title="Alfonso Cuarón">Alfonso Cuarón</a>'s 2006 film <i><a href="../../../c/h/i/Children_of_Men_bae1.html" title="Children of Men">Children of Men</a></i>, the station appears rebuilt as the "Ark Of Art"; the film, set in 2027, imagines a world where sudden universal infertility has doomed the human race to extinction. The resulting global chaos leaves Britain as one of the few functioning societies on Earth (albeit one held together with fascist brutality). The Power Station contains art treasures salvaged from less stable nations and preserved for a "posterity" that's not coming, as the film's protagonist (<a href="../../../c/l/i/Clive_Owen_fed9.html" title="Clive Owen">Clive Owen</a>) points out to the curator, his cousin (<a href="../../../d/a/n/Danny_Huston_ba19.html" title="Danny Huston">Danny Huston</a>) as they dine beneath the shattered and rebuilt <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michaelangelo%27s_David_0dec.html" title="Michaelangelo's David">Michaelangelo's David</a>. An inflatable pig is tethered to the exterior of the building, a reference to the Pink Floyd album cover.</p>
<p>Bettersea Power Station stands as the hideout of Colonel Olrik, in the french comic "Menaces sur l' empire" by Pierre Veys and Nicolas Barral (DARGAUD 2005), a parody of the classic comic series of Edgard P. Jacobs' "<a href="../../../b/l/a/Blake_and_Mortimer_cf08.html" title="Blake and Mortimer">Blake and Mortimer</a>".</p>
