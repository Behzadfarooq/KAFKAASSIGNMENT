<p>I am aware that opinions on this subject vary widely, but the two defeats of the Arabs at Constantinople 674-678 Ad und 717-717 AD were <i>absolutely instrumental</i> in saving a distinct European culture. Since you listed the contemporary battle of Tours which saved <i>Western</i> Europe, it is plausible that you also include those two battles which saved <i>Eastern</i> Europe, and which in fact were fought on a much larger scale than in the West.</p>

<dl>
<dd>Hmmm. Does a siege qualify as a battle? Most sieges are just "stalling" conflicts, with one side blockading the other one inside a city and waiting for them to die out. In most sieges, there wasn't any battling at all. The article <a href="../../../s/i/e/Siege.html" title="Siege">siege</a> does not qualify sieges as <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battles.html" title="Battles">battles</a>; moreover, it states that "several battles may take place between the besieging and the defending forces". Therefore, I think the sieges of Constantinople do not fit into this article. -- Doctor France 16:56, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As you said the battle of Stalingrad was actually a protracted siege which took several months. The battle of Berlin was another siege. Many modern battles of encirclement and annihilation, notably of WW II, were actually in their character essentially sieges between encircling forces and those who tried to break out. In case of the Arab sieges they were a series of battles fought under the walls of Constantinople, conveniently summarized as 'sieges'. To be frank, I have quite often read that these Byzantine victories were actually even more important than the battle of Tours.

<dl>
<dd>That is precisely why I removed that example; I wanted to show a more modern example of the thing and I made a mistake. I do not deny that this battles may have been more important than the battle of Tours and are surely of macrohistorical importance, but according to the article on the <a href="../../../s/i/e/Siege_of_Constantinople_%28718%29_774a.html" title="Siege of Constantinople (718)">Siege of Constantinople (718)</a>, it actually was the harsh winter and attrition which destroyed the Umayyad army; during the siege, there were a few <b>skirmishes</b> and <b>raids</b> by the Bulgarians, but none which can definitely count as a battle. As for the <a href="../../../s/i/e/Siege_of_Constantinople_%28674%29_4175.html" title="Siege of Constantinople (674)">Siege of Constantinople (674)</a>... it is not a battle itself. It consists of a conflict with a few battles in it, such as the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Syllaeum_239a.html" title="Battle of Syllaeum">Battle of Syllaeum</a>, and ultimately, it was again the approach of winter which made the besiegers lift the siege. <b>IMHO</b>, a siege may include one or more battles but the siege is not a battle itself. In a siege, one faction cuts off the supplies of the other one and simply waits for it to succumb to starvation and illness; in a battle, deaths are caused by direct confrontation on the field.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I'll give you an example which is better suited than my previous one. The <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Vienna_080c.html" title="Battle of Vienna">Battle of Vienna</a> took place on the 11th and 12th of September of 1683; the siege had already began two months before. Therefore, it is quite obvious that the Battle of Vienna is not the same thing as the siege of Vienna. -- Doctor France 19:19, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>A skirmish is a <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle.html" title="Battle">battle</a>. A siege can also be a battle or have more battles (like the Siege on Constantinople in 1453).

<p><i>"in which the existence of the European civilisation as such was <b>compromised</b>"</i> - What do you mean by "compromised"? Irreversably altered of affected, or what do you mean?

If it was affected at that time, then it wouldn`t by today "as such" (and as such, in it`s turn to be affected centuries ago). Similary, if the European civilisation was not affected, than why the need for that intro? I think you should better reword the intro part. Btw, what criteriae are there for a battle to be included in this article?

<dd>Manzikert and Vaslui <b>did</b> affect the outcome of European civilisation, but this page is "reserved" for battles which, if lost, whould have probably meant the fall of all of or most of Europe (Vienna, Toulouse, Tours...) or of a nation which played a vital role in the formation of Europea heritage (<a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_Greece_e4c9.html" title="Ancient Greece">Ancient Greece</a> at Thermopylae, <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Empire_411e.html" title="Roman Empire">Roman Empire</a> at Metaurus...). While the defeat at Manzikert did spell the beginning of the end for the <a href="../../../e/a/s/East_Roman_Empire_9a48.html" title="East Roman Empire">East Roman Empire</a>, it did not threaten the integrity of Europe nor its historical culture. As for the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Vaslui_4a27.html" title="Battle of Vaslui">Battle of Vaslui</a>, I have tried to limit myself to those battles which have the consensus of most historians; Vaslui is not the case, mostly because many believe that, <b>even with a Turkish victory, the Ottoman Empire would have still been very far from attaining total (or almost total) control of Europe</b>.</dd>

<dd>It is yet to be proved if battles like Toulouse or Tours were lost (or even Vienna) the whole Europe would have been lost. Actually Toulouse was near the border of the Islamic Spain like Vaslui was near the border of the Ottoman Turks.

<p>from the last paragraph in the section:</p>

</dl>
<p>. . . all of whom attempted, to some degree, to assimilate and imitate the lifestyle of the Romans they conquered. Who says the Huns--who were, by the time of Attila's invasions, only the rulers of a large multi-ethnic confederation--wouldn't have done the same? Priscus wrote of farming and permanent buildings, including Roman-style stone baths, in Attila's lands--indicating that the Huns were already well on the way to abandoning nomadism and adopting a settled lifestyle. Heck, Attila's pretense for the invasion of 451 was a claim to Honoria's hand in marriage and rule of half the empire.</p>
<p>Consider the Magyars: they were pastoral nomads and fearsome raiders when they moved into Europe in the 9th century, but were rulers of a feudal kingdom similar to its western neighbors by the 12th. Who's to say that the Huns would not have likewise assimilated? (Who <i>does</i> say that? The paragraph is unsourced.) Who's to say that, had the Huns reached the Atlantic, the added territories wouldn't have been part of the general collapse of the Hun empire following Attila's death in 453?</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>in which <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christianism.html" title="Christianism">Christianism</a>, for example, would not have played such an important role as it actually did during the <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middle_Ages_99b9.html" title="Middle Ages">Middle Ages</a>.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>While one could speculate that the Hun paganism that appeared dominant at Attila's time would remain indefinitely, that would just be speculation, and unlikely: the only invaders of Christian Europe (late antique - medieval era) who did not either start out or end up Christianized were the Arabs.</p>
<p>This section (and indeed the article as a whole) needs better sourcing; the only section with any citations, vague though they are, is the one on the battle of Tours--and there the citations don't support any arguments on <i>why</i> it was important, but merely say that it was important, see, because all these people say it was. 67.68.242.65 17:50, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>A defeat at the Battle of Salamis would not have necessarily dealt a lethal blow to the Greeks, as they still had other forces left. On the other hand, the situation at Thermopylae was worse; had Leonidas and his 300 Spartans not held the onslaught for 3 days, the Greek army would not have been able to organise itself for Artemisium and Salamis itself and would have probably been overrun, leaving Greece at the Persians' mercy. As for the Mongol Invasions, see the discussion above on the sieges of Constantinople - this article concerns battles, not entire campaigns. On a further note, there was no battle in which European peoples defended their culture from the Mongol Empire; the only reason Europe was not overrun was because of the Khan's untimely death. -- Doctor France 10:58, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Doctor France is absolutely correct.

</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"Because a great part of European civilisation is based on the heritage of Ancient Greece, a successful invasion of Greece by the Persians and their subsequent domination would have surely changed the history of Europe."</dd>
<dd>"If, on the other hand, Rome had fallen, the Roman Empire would never have exerted its influence on European history, an influence which shaped a great deal of European culture."</dd>
<dd>"After having stormed most of the Roman Empire, Attila was intent on reaching the Atlantic Ocean. Had he reached his goal and had Rome been unable to mount resistance against his invasion, the masters of Europe after the end of the Roman Empire in 476 would have been very different. Instead of finding itself largely under Gothic control, Europe would have been dominated by the Huns, whose nomadic tradition and lifestyle would have shaped a very different kind of Europe, in which Christianism, for example, would not have played such an important role as it actually did during the Middle Ages."</dd>
<dd>"This view is widespread because it is seen as very improbable that, had the Frankish kingdom fallen, the rest of Europe, divided into little, squabbling states, would have been able to resist the Muslim expansion"</dd>

<li>POV and undue weight: though in the Wiki articles on some of these battles the controversy on importance is sometimes balanced, here the views against macrohistorical importance are totally missing giving the false impression this view is undisputed at all (and also in conjunction with the generalizing claims I've mentioned above).</li>
<li>misleading references: I'm wondering why exactly historians like Tomaž Mastnak or Pierre Riche are referenced. As the other POVs are missing, it gives the false impression to the reader that all those guys support (at least partially) the views given in the article.</li>

<dd>To answer you in part, Tomaž Mastnak's views, and several others in opposition to some of the findings on this page, are being presented. I did not write the article, but am attempting a rewrite, which will take considerable time - at least 10 days, because I feel opposing views need to be listed, the article needs renaming, et al. But in considerable part, you are citing statements that are well documented historically, such as:</dd>
<dd>"This view is widespread because it is seen as very improbable that, had the Frankish kingdom fallen, the rest of Europe, divided into little, squabbling states, would have been able to resist the Muslim expansion" This is almost taken word for word from the works of William Watson, one of our most respected modern historians:
<dl>
<dd>"There is clearly some justification for ranking Tours-Poitiers among the most significant events in Frankish history when one considers the result of the battle in light of the remarkable record of the successful establishment by Muslims of Islamic political and cultural dominance along the entire eastern and southern rim of the former Christian, Roman world. The rapid Muslim conquest of Palestine, Syria, Egypt and the North African coast all the way to Morocco in the seventh century resulted in the permanent imposition by force of Islamic culture onto a previously Christian and largely non-Arab base. The Visigothic kingdom fell to Muslim conquerors in a single battle on the Rio Barbate in 711, and the Hispanic Christian population took seven long centuries to regain control of the Iberian peninsula. The Reconquista, of course, was completed in 1492, only months before Columbus received official backing for his fateful voyage across the Atlantic Ocean. Had Charles Martel suffered at Tours-Poitiers the fate of King Roderick at the Rio Barbate, it is doubtful that a "do-nothing" sovereign of the Merovingian realm could have later succeeded where his talented major domus had failed. Indeed, as Charles was the progenitor of the Carolingian line of Frankish rulers and grandfather of Charlemagne, one can even say with a degree of certainty that the subsequent history of the West would have proceeded along vastly different currents had ‘Abd ar-Rahman been victorious at Tours-Poitiers in 732.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Nor of course is Watson alone in that - Victor Davis Hanson, military historian, says of that Battle:
<dl>
<dd>"What is clear is that Poitiers marked a general continuence of the successful western defense of Europe. Flush from his victory at Poitiers, Charles went on to clear southern France from Islamic invaders for decades, unify the warring kingdoms into the foundation of the Carolingian Empire, and ensure ready and avaiable troops from local estates." <sup id="_ref-Hanson_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Hanson" title="">[2]</a></sup></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>As to Attila, that is a rewrite of Gibbon's findings in the <i>Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire</i>. There is no question that the article needs at the least a complete rewrite, with heavy sourcing, and opposing viewpoints. I am in the process of doing just that. I believe you will find that all viewpoints will be fairly presented - you are welcome to join the effort to do so, instead of simply tagging the article, help fix it. I did not write this article, but believe as it is here, it either should be corrected or deleted. As a part of European history, it deserves to stay, perhaps retitled. It obviously, as I have repeatedly said, needs rewriting, sourcing, and opposing views to meet the wikipedia encyclopedic standard. I am in the process of doing that, and any help is welcomed. <a href="../../../o/l/d/User%7EOldwindybear_14b1.html" title="User:Oldwindybear">old windy bear</a> 16:56, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I usually go first on commenting and participate a bit later (unless I think it's something very obvious or non-contrversial). As you can see from my comments I believe this article is a far way from what I'd consider a NPOV presentation, so I expect the tags to stay there for a while.</dd>
<dd>From your quotes, I do not see any justification for "this view is widespread". Those quotes do not address the historiography, do not clarify how the majority or a certain minority is viewing the problem, do not clarify if a view is widespread or isolated. That's one of the problems I raised also in the AFD discussion.</dd>
<dd>I also do not agree how you inserted Mastnak's view on Tours. Hanson's opinion should be listed along the others supporting the same idea, not as a reply to Mastnak. Mastnak's view is encircled by the views of others supporting the macrohistorical significance, thus leaving the reader a biased impression. I agree with POV1 vs POV2 type of construction but not with POV1 vs POV2 vs POV1. <a href="../../../d/a/i/User%7EDaizus_dd8f.html" title="User:Daizus">Daizus</a> 17:35, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

This is a work in progress! Plesae give me a chance, and in 10 days, when I write "this is now ready for your inspection" I am willing to wager you will feel it is fair. Now it is just in transition, with Mastnak being the first opposing view to be entered - I need Hitti's book, which I have ordered, to quote him exactly. Part of the problem with this article is that it uses generalizations instead of exact quotes. I had Mastnak's book, so could quote from him immediately, as with Hanson, Oman, Fuller, Creasy, Gibbon, et al. I have no trouble with the tags being on - I AGREE WITH YOU, THEY SHOULD BE ON! I simply am not going to put in more generalizations - that is what the original problem was! Work with me, is all I ask, and I believe you will feel it is fairly done in the end, and I welcome your help. (or anyone else's!)

<dd>I apologize if I give you the impression I'm pressing you or anything. I am not. I am willing to give you all the time in the world you need. Even help you if I believe this is going to be helpful. For the time being, I just thought it's fair to start the give more space to justify my "delete" vote. Because, the way I see it, the solutions to these problems will trigger others:</dd>
<dd>* once both (or more) POVs are presented, what will be the justification of the article? What name shall it have? Battles which some see as macrohistorical but some not? And what will be its raison d'être? Why is it not just a category, if anything (all the content of the article should be also in the articles dedicated to those battles)?</dd>
<dd>* how will we then estabilish the content? Probably many other battles were seen by some historians as macrohistorical (and you can see in the talk pages several other battles were proposed) - on what criteria will we choose the battles? And macrohistorical to what? the entire Europe? and what is exactly the area and from what point of view (cultural/religious, geographic, etc.) - to Vienna, to Urals?</dd>
<dd>The attempt to give a NPOV look to this article will transform it in a huge essay: starting with differences on defining Europe, on interpreting some historical events of macrohistorical importance or not, on integrating the "battle history" of a certain Europe into it, on discussing each battle, etc. (and each time presenting as many POVs as we have knowledge of). That's why I concluded in my comments in AFD page it would be better to have an article for the debates around macrohistory, presenting the clashes of paradigms - this, IMO, could get an encyclopedic shape. The former, not. <a href="../../../d/a/i/User%7EDaizus_dd8f.html" title="User:Daizus">Daizus</a> 09:25, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Oh, and I want to clarify another little detail: in reality, these POVs are a bit more varied than POV1 vs POV2. I've read Watson's article from De Re Military site and beside the conclusion you quoted he also says:
<dl>
<dd><i>His invasion was neither simply a raid <b>nor part of a grand scheme to conquer all Christendom</b>, it was a failed attempt to elimi–nate a strategic threat located north of the Andalusi border. <b>Moreover, the battle did not decide the outcome of the Christian-Muslim struggle in Francia</b>. Rather, it brought a determined new participant into the field of combat, the Frankish army, which launched an offensive against the remaining Muslin bases to the south only a few years after Charles won his victory at Tours-Poitiers and earned himself the title Martel ("Hammer")</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>It's a bit unfair to put him side by side with historians like Gibbon et al. because Watson clearly puts a distance between him and them:
<dl>
<dd><i>Beginning in the eighteenth century, however, non-clerical authors <b>began to exaggerate the significance of the battle</b>. Edward Gibbon, for example, wrote in 1776 [...]. Similarly, M. Guizot and Mme. Guizot de Witt wrote in 1869 [...].</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Watson's alternative history of Europe is simply "vastly different" not "Islamic" as it would be for many other authors. <a href="../../../d/a/i/User%7EDaizus_dd8f.html" title="User:Daizus">Daizus</a> 09:25, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I don't feel you are giving me a hard time - you clearly know I did not write this, and am just trying to clean it up. You are raising genuine issues that need to be resolved, and that is always a positive. On Watson, it is true that Watson is very careful to use far more nuanced language when describing the outcome of the Battle - but he still says
<dl>
<dd>"There is clearly some justification for ranking Tours-Poitiers among the most significant events in Frankish history when one considers the result of the battle in light of the remarkable record of the successful establishment by Muslims of Islamic political and cultural dominance along the entire eastern and southern rim of the former Christian, Roman world. The rapid Muslim conquest of Palestine, Syria, Egypt and the North African coast all the way to Morocco in the seventh century resulted in the permanent imposition by force of Islamic culture onto a previously Christian and largely non-Arab base. The Visigothic kingdom fell to Muslim conquerors in a single battle on the Rio Barbate in 711, and the Hispanic Christian population took seven long centuries to regain control of the Iberian peninsula."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>And actually his conclusions are almost precisely those of Antonio Santosuosso, another modern historian who also found that the greatest effect of the battle was to bring the determined and dynamic presence of the Frankish Army into play, which put an end to Islamic expansion into the Great Land. (he emphasizes the Battle at the River Berre, far more than Tours, where Martel smashed a relief army coming to the aid of invasion forces being attacked by the Franks in the 734-37 campaigns!) Both did find macrohistorical importance in this, though they fall short of Gibbon's rhetoric! But even Hanson wonders if Gibbon was not simply engaging in hyperbole in his famous "sail up the Thames but for Martel" rant. I think Bury's description, though a century old, is probably the most accurate other than Watson's. (As I wrote someone else, that is an ongoing academic dispute, as you know, what role the works of the mid era historians should play - not everyone agrees that they should be discounted; indeed, at universities like UT Bury is still given as the definitive source on the later Roman Empire. Among the moderns, Grant for instance comes right out and practically says what Gibbon did, and Hans Drubeck, still one of Germany's greatest military historians, (despite his being pre-WW II) is so dramatic as to call this the greatest battle of history! But I appreciate your giving me time to correct this - if the vote is not to delete, I honestly believe it can be fairly rewritten, just as we did on the battle of tours main article. Remember, we faced the exact same problems with that article, and reached a fine article and complete consensus. The same can be done here, it will just take time and work. In that article, we were careful to draw distinctions between the early moderns, Gibbon, Bury, Creasy, and then the mids, Drubeck, Hitti, followed by this generation,Tomaž Mastnak, Watson, Grant, Santosuosso, Wakefield, et al.</dd>
<dd>As far as how to create the list, we will use Paul Davis's, or Hanson's, or David Eggenberger's, or find those battles specifically listed as macrohistorical in the west by respected historians, such as Paul Davis or Hanson. Of course, on the more controversial, such as Tours, opposing viewpoints will be listed. An encyclopedia has to use reference materials and source it's articles accordingly - and I believe it can be done. <a href="../../../o/l/d/User%7EOldwindybear_14b1.html" title="User:Oldwindybear">old windy bear</a> 12:17, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>There's no evidence from Watson to make us assume those Muslims raids were an attempt to properly expand the Ummeyad realm (anyway not furthermore than Loire valley, i.e. furthermore than Aquitania). Even in the proper content of the article, in the chapter dedicated to motivations, they have just an immediate goal as Watson speaks only of a military offensive against Aquitania, let's quote him for clarification: "Rather than being merely a raid for plunder in the dar al-Harb, or an attempt to conquer the entire Christian world, the northern expedition of Abd ar-Rahman was designed to eliminate the strategic threat that Eudo of Aquitaine posed to the Andalusi Muslims. "</dd>
<dd>In his assessment Watson makes a distinct position from Gibbon et al.. He is not just wondering if others hyperbolized, he clearly states they exaggerated greatly. The Christian world would have NOT fallen, had Martel lost the battle at Tours. The paragraph you quote from Watson comparing this situation with Muslim overruning the Visigothic Spain refers only to these territories (Septimania, eventually Aquitania), not to the entire Francia, not to the entire Europe. Putting all these historians in the same pot it is very dangeorous, and possibly qualifiable as original research. I believe it's fair (whereever this battle is described - here, in the article on Tours, or in the article on Charles Martel) to make it clear these historians argue from different POVs on the macrohistorical significance. For some it is the Europe being saved from Islam, for other it is just the warrant for the succcess of Carolingians in almost the entire Western Europe. Two very different views, even if essentially they can be reduced to a common denominator - the macrohistorical significance. Perhaps the section on macrohistorical importance may be divided in two others, perhaps from the text of the section we can point out the differences between these historians, we'll talk and see. <a href="../../../d/a/i/User%7EDaizus_dd8f.html" title="User:Daizus">Daizus</a> 12:51, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd><a href="../../../d/a/i/User%7EDaizus_dd8f.html" title="User:Daizus">Daizus</a> I agree with you completely. I have always tried to point out that Watson uses far more realistic, nuanced, and less bombastic language than Gibbon, and makes a far more detailed and realistic appraisal of why the Battle was important. I think also there is a very clear distinction between Watson, (and Santosuosso, whose findings are quite similiar), and Grant, Martin, and other modern historians who echo Gibbon. I personally believe Watson and Santosuosso are correct, (though obviously it does not matter what I personally think!). I think Tours was vital not in that it saved the world as we know it, but that it brought into the conflict a new and very vital element, the frankish army, which ended up ruling Europe for a century as the Carolingian Empire, and which set the stage for the Holy Roman Empire. Not to completely downgrade Tours - I do think it had macrohistorical impact, just not of the world-saving class - I think Santosuosso was correct that for pure military impact, the defeat of the relief force at the River Berre by Martel in 737 was probably his single most important military victory, because, as Santosuosso says, that defeat ended attempts to invade the great land while the Umayyads could. I believe your idea of a separate section for the "yes it was macrohistorical, no, it was not the saving of the western world" views, that Watson and Santosuosso espouse is a very good idea. If you will help, we can talk about how best to do that, once we see if there is going to be an article. I would also like your thoughts on which sources to draw on to get a list from, again, if there is going to be an article. I think this is a fascinating subject, that we can get an interesting article from, it just needs to be completely rewritten. <a href="../../../o/l/d/User%7EOldwindybear_14b1.html" title="User:Oldwindybear">old windy bear</a> 14:06, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Not really. But I have already thought of a structure for this article, in case the AfD would result in a "keep" vote.</dd>
<dd>The article needs an introduction about what a battle of macrohistorical importance is and about the general opposition of views - those supporting a history decisively shaped by battles vs those giving less importance to battles. Also a definition of Europe (a Christian Catholic Europe, or a Graeco-Roman inheriting Europe or perhaps geographically defined) should be made clear, of course, in the same balance of POVs.</dd>
<dd>The proper list of battles I suggest to be an open list. However, let's not allow any battle to be listed there. We can add supplementary conditions to filter notable and relevant battles - e.g. at least two relatively recent historians (writing in let's say last 50 years? last 100 years?) should openly support the battle's significance at macrohistorical level.</dd>
<dd>The format of each battle could be on the existing template - a link to the battle's main article, a little summary, opinions supporting the macrohistorical importance and opinions opposing that (criticism).</dd>
<dd>Anyway, whatever criteria are decided for these battles, they must be openly stated to avoid continuous tagging for POV.</dd>
<dd>These are my suggestions for start. If you can improve them or you have better suggestions, the better. <a href="../../../d/a/i/User%7EDaizus_dd8f.html" title="User:Daizus">Daizus</a> 12:28, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hmmm, <a href="../../../d/a/i/User%7EDaizus_dd8f.html" title="User:Daizus">Daizus</a> I think they are excellent suggestions. First, we include any battle that has at least two historians who have stated in their writings that the battle has macrohistorical importance, or, "changed Europe's history," - you know what I mean, language that clearly states macrohistorical importance. As to the defintion of macrohistorical, what about our own wikipedia definition, which defines macrohistorical as</dd>

<dd>"Macro-historical analysis seeks out large, long-term trends in world history, searching for ultimate patterns through a comparison of proximate details. For example, a Macro-historical study might examine Japanese feudalism and European feudalism in order to decide whether feudal structures are an inevitable outcome given certain conditions. Macro-historical studies often "assume that macro-historical processes repeat themselves in explainable and understandable ways" Examples of macro-historical analysis include Karl Marx's assertion that all history can be explained through economics and class struggle, and Arnold J.

<li>"Macrohistorical battles" is a contradiction in terms, as "macrohistory" would seem to entail long-span times, and battles occur, at most, in a few years (most of the times, a few days or weeks are enough).</li>
<li>"European civilization" is a POV and <a href="../../../f/u/z/Fuzzy_concept.html" title="Fuzzy concept">fuzzy concept</a>. If you guys can find me 30 sources from internationally-known historians and philosophers, <i>from various backgrounds and opinions</i>, defining in the same way "European civilization", you will be very strong indeed! But even if you managed that incredible feat, you would still have to explain why the member states of the European Union could not agree on a definition of that so-called "European civilization" during the debate on whether to include, or not <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_the_Treaty_establishing_a_Constitution_for_Europe_0661.html#Mention_of_Christianity_in_the_preamble" title="History of the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe">Christianity as a character of this so-called civilisation in the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe</a>. Not one person who voted "yes" has adressed this argument - with reason... I recall that the majority of member states decided <i>not to</i> include Christianity in the definition of "Europe", but only mentionned the "cultural, religious and humanist inheritance of Europe". <a href="../../../h/u/m/Humanism.html" title="Humanism">Humanism</a>, in a number of countries and for a number of persons, including <a href="../../../b/a/r/Baruch_Spinoza_f87e.html" title="Baruch Spinoza">Baruch Spinoza</a>, <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Locke_68b4.html" title="John Locke">John Locke</a>, <a href="../../../i/m/m/Immanuel_Kant_5dcb.html" title="Immanuel Kant">Immanuel Kant</a>, etc., etc., entails <a href="../../../s/e/c/Secularism.html" title="Secularism">secularism</a> and <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freedom_of_religion.html" title="Freedom of religion">freedom of religion</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>For all these reasons, the title remains disputed and will remain so until we solve this dispute. Maybe an Afd was not the correct way to proceed (although starting an article named like that is obviously taking <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#BATTLEGROUND" title="WP:NOT">WP for a battleground</a>). In this case, I apologize if need be - although I don't feel "guilty", probably because Christianism is not embedded that much on my European character. <i>In order to find a consensus which will suit everyone, I propose to rename the article to Important battles of the History of Europe</i> in accordance with <a href="../../../n/c/o/WP%7ENCON_841b.html" title="WP:NCON">naming conflict</a> guidelines:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<i>Names can sometimes be controversial because of perceived negative political connotations, historical conflicts or territorial disputes... Nevertheless, some degree of standardisation of terms is required for practical and technical reasons...</i><br />

Wikipedians should not seek to determine who is "right" or "wrong", nor to attempt to <i>impose a particular name for POV reasons</i>.

<dd>I'm not very clear on the <a href="../../../s/y/n/WP%7ESYNT_6790.html" title="WP:SYNT">a synthesis of sources</a> applied to such a topic. There are a lot of listing topics in Wikipedia, from categories to "list of x", topics with no reference on their structure and in some cases even unreferenceable as they are gathered in time, by many editors. Actually, on a more general perspective, the article's structure is seldom referenced by sources. As long as the items from a list do not infer an unsourced conclusion, I don't think it's any OR involved.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The syntagm "macrohistorical battle" is wrong, but in the other articles linked from this one and in their talk pages, I've seen used however "macrohistorical significance", "macrohistorical importance", "macrohistorical level", syntagms which you can find even on Google. I suspect "macrohistorical battle" is an unthoughtful shortened equivalent for "battles whose consequences were important at macrohistorical level" or "battles having a macrohistorical significance". In principle I agree with the move, but I don't think necessarily we should avoid the term "macrohistory" because essentially the scholars quoted so far to support such a view, they argue on a major importance, sometimes they use superlatives like "most important", "most influential", etc., they offer alternative scenarios of a "mirror-reversed world" (e.g. the Europe would have been non-Christian instead of Christian).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>But I agree with you we need a definition of Europe and the list should be open within the bounds of our definition. <a href="../../../d/a/i/User%7EDaizus_dd8f.html" title="User:Daizus">Daizus</a> 20:27, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ah, and Taz, while I browsed a number of history articles here on Wikipedia I noticed there's a general trend here in considering the history of mankind (especially until the dawn of modern era) as a history of kings and battles. While such an article would indeed support openly this paradigm, at the core, many of Wikipedia's historical articles encourage this approach. And consequently we might find readers or editors (fortunately not Oldwindybear and some others which so far are open and considering the arguments of the opposite side and I'm very thankful for that) labelling our attempt to create NPOV as "political correctness" or "postmodernist" or similar such labels people use to address on a blaming tone what they <i>perceive</i> as attempts to conceal an inconvenient reality. <a href="../../../d/a/i/User%7EDaizus_dd8f.html" title="User:Daizus">Daizus</a> 08:12, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p><a href="../../../d/a/i/User%7EDaizus_dd8f.html" title="User:Daizus">Daizus</a> HI my friend, I agree with you - the use of the EU would be too limiting. Oh well, I was trying to cut down the number of complaints on POV that will come up. Okay, then I agree, lets start off with Greek-Roman, and go from there. I also agree with you that most articles online - not just wikipedia, though I agree with you there also - tend to define historial events as a history of various Monarchs and battles. Thanks for seeing that I am open to other definitions, because I am, but alas, many see any attempt to depart from that as "political correctness," and we are going to get attacked for that. <a href="../../../o/l/d/User%7EOldwindybear_14b1.html" title="User:Oldwindybear">old windy bear</a> 11:14, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>When you are discussing european civilization, it seems you are under the impression that there is a homogenous nature to western thought and culture. Is europe a geographical land mass which would then include Russia and Turkey? The iberian penisula from the 9th to the 15th century was in arab hands as were the Balkans for 500 years under turkish rule. The greeks also had their outposts along the black sea and Anatolia. So then, is it a shared cultural heritage? Or is it a question of West as opposed to East; Catholicism and Protestantism as opposed to Eastern Orthodoxy; it seems that Christianity as opposed to Islam is the defining argument for the last 3 battles. It was in the mediterranean that European Civilization began in the threefold shape of ancient greece, Rome, and Christianity but in saying that, Europes borders were never fixed. So, when you are discussing European Civilization, it might be a fraction more accurate to exclude the word civilisation.Drappy 08:28, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Like it was argued, I believe the syntagm is indeed self-contradicting. I understand its intended meaning when used coloquially, but let's make the title with as little ambiguity possible. If you want an adjective for "battles" that would be "important", "significant", perhaps "major". And the lead of the article could shed some light on macrohistory and macrohistorical. <a href="../../../d/a/i/User%7EDaizus_dd8f.html" title="User:Daizus">Daizus</a> 08:03, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

It's true as Daizus points out above—in connection with the issue of <a href="../../../s/y/n/WP%7ESYNT_6790.html" title="WP:SYNT">a synthesis of sources</a>—that there are many listing topics in WP, but most are finite lists of the sort that can easily be verified to everybody's satisfaction with readily available sources, for instance <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Justices_of_the_Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States_21e5.html" title="List of Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States">List of Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States</a>, lists of tallest buildings, etc. There's a good reason why very few WP articles start with the word "Important"; those that do often get deleted due to intractable OR and POV problems, or become sprawling monsters like <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_important_publications_in_sociology.html" title="List of important publications in sociology">List of important publications in sociology</a>. The creation of a seemingly objective criterion—support from two historians—doesn't really solve this, as disagreements are likely over choice of historians, there will be objections that two is an arbitrary or insufficient number, and so on. Not sure what the answer is, but the name change would be a step in the right direction. <a href="../../../e/w/u/User%7EEwulp_8154.html" title="User:Ewulp">Ewulp</a> 09:33, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Claiming "macrohistorical" can provide a criteria for the selection or exclusion of battles first entails that we can find an objective, consensual definition of this — by "consensual", I don't mean "Wikipedia consensus" (<a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#DEMOCRACY" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#DEMOCRACY</a>) but something agreed on by the <a href="../../../h/i/s/History.html" title="History">historian</a> <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientific_community.html" title="Scientific community">scientific community</a>). However, the possibility itself of a "macrohistorical battle" is contested, as recalled by Daizus. It would really simplify things if we took the more common, and perhaps less pretentious term of "important" or "major". True enough, it would not guarantee an objective way of selecting or exclusing battles. Neither would "macrohistorical" for that matter. Furthermore, I agree with Daizus concerning Wikipedia's <a href="../../../s/y/s/Systemic_bias.html" title="Systemic bias">systemic bias</a> toward what Braudel called "<i>histoire événementielle</i>" (or "event history", "history based on events"), to the disadvantage of less exciting, but perhaps deeper at the end, studies based on analysis of long term tendencies, <a href="../../../s/t/a/Statistics.html" title="Statistics">statistics</a>, <a href="../../../e/c/o/Econometry.html" title="Econometry">econometry</a>, analysis of the climate, etc., most tools brought by modern science and which were not accessible to 19th century historians. The reason for this bias is simple: important battles, which can be easily remembered through the use of dates (and anyone who has learnt history knows how easy learning dates is, although it at first appears impossible to remember so much data...), and famous figures, which story can and are easily romanticized, fictionized and, now, made into popular films, are much more known by the general public than say, the price of corn or the evolution of the <a href="../../../y/e/r/Yersinia_pestis.html" title="Yersinia pestis">Yersinia pestis</a> bacteria. Another possible reason for this bias is the rather facility to create a biography, which basically only needs birth date, nationality, occupation, year of graduation, and one remarkable event which, as Hegel would have said, has made the guy enter "universal history" (or maybe just "universal Wikitrivia", but that's another matter - let's not conjoncture on the "end of history" and others similar apocalyptic ideas...) To go to the point, I really see no reason, in the current state of this rational debate and presented arguments, in strong refusal of this proposed move, others than ideological attempts at defining a determined conception of Europe which is obviously far from being the majority view point, both among European people (who are they? Turkish? Russian? Bosnian Muslims? Algerian refugees?----) and among contemporary historians. <a href="../../../t/a/z/User%7ETazmaniacs_ae79.html" title="User:Tazmaniacs">Tazmaniacs</a> 03:02, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Because it was suggested during the deletion period that the Battle of Lepanto, 1571, be added, as it was the largest naval engagement between European and invading forces in history, and certainly had macrohistorical importance, (more along the lines of Chalons, in that the Ottoman Navy rebuilt even stronger within six months of the defeat - but their aura of invincibility had been forever shattered). Does anyone object to the introduction of this battle as part of the article? As to the name, I will go along with whatever the majority wants. Believe it or not, I don't think the list of battles is going to be endless, because there simply are not that many battles that two or more historians have put in writing effected the fate of Europe, and/or the world, between European and invading forces. <a href="../../../o/l/d/User%7EOldwindybear_14b1.html" title="User:Oldwindybear">old windy bear</a> 14:21, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>the minimum that can be attributed to Lepanto is the strong cultural ties it caused between Italy and Spain at the time, therefore, yes, it should be part of this article.

<dd>I agree that defining Europe may not be the easiest task in the world, but going all over the map - the Africaner trek? We might as well include the Puritan flight to the New World! I think the idea of an article which discussed crucial battles fought as macrohistorial turning points vis a vis Europeans versus invaders was a good idea. Mind you, I did not write this article, i merely thought it an interesting idea, and still think so. I think Taz your motives are good ones - I don't doubt your good faith - but I think you are expanding this to global proporations, when it isn't that complex an idea. I think the idea of defining this to battles that two or more MODERN historians find as macrohistorical - and they do take climate, economics, cultural trends, and a host of factors that early chroniclers could not into account -- is a good place to start, and then we go from there. I don't think we should get into the Napoleanic Wars, or the 100 years War, or the host of other intra European war because that both destroys the whole concept of the article, and makes the list impossibly long, and besides, all those events have their own lists. I simply don't think it is going to be that hard to make a list that two or more modern historains find effected European or world history macrohistorically, and we use the wikipedia definition of macrohistorical effect. <a href="../../../o/l/d/User%7EOldwindybear_14b1.html" title="User:Oldwindybear">old windy bear</a> 04:05, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This is yet another example of political correctness running amok. How can anyone seriously debate that these battles were of historical importance in that they swayed all of history in their aftermath. Yet we debate the title? Aren't each of these battles between European forces and outsiders? Aren't all of them vetted by two or more modern historians as having world class implicaations!?

<p>I've restored the original order of comments above; <a href="../../../t/a/z/User%7ETazmaniacs_ae79.html" title="User:Tazmaniacs">Tazmaniacs</a>' refactoring and bolding of the word "support" may have had the effect of making my enthusiasm for the proposed name change seem greater than it is. I supported the change because, as others have pointed out, the present article name is very, very bad, and until a better alternative comes along, this is a reasonable stopgap. But Important battles in the History of Europe is not really an appropriate title for the text of this article--any article called Important battles in the history of Europe should include Malta and Normandy and Stalingrad and many others--they're important, right? If they are not included, the stipulations given in the opening paragraph--the battle has to be between a European entity and a non-European entity, and of macrohistoric importance--constitute a bait-and switch. It's as if <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_the_automobile.html" title="History of the automobile">History of the automobile</a> started off with a disclaimer that "only front-engine, rear-wheel drive autos with over 10 million sold will be mentioned in this article". That leaves out the entire first 30 years of automotive history, along with much else, and such an article needs a more accurate name. Others have pointed out what's wrong with "Macrohistorical battles tied to the existence of European civilisation"; the debate over this is not "political correctness run amok". To recap:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Macrohistorical battles" is not a sensible combination of words. <i>Macrohistorical</i> means "over a long period of history", so a macrohistorical battle would be a battle lasting for centuries. These ones were over quickly; historians described their <i>consequences</i> as macrohistorical. An article about people who are famous for having traveled extensively shouldn't be named Famous extensive people--it's the wrong adjective, same problem seen in this article's name. The error in usage should be corrected for the same reason we check dates for accuracy &amp; fix typos--without attention to standards WP looks amateurish &amp; loses credibility.</li>
<li>"tied to the existence of European civilisation" is hyperbolic, suggesting that, had the battle of the Metaurus (or any of the others) gone the other way, a civilization worthy of the name would not have existed in Europe afterwards. At least that's one way to read it. The text of the article states the facts more accurately: "If, on the other hand, Rome had fallen, the Roman Empire would never have exerted its influence on European history, an influence which shaped a great deal of European culture." Elsewhere, similar reasonable conclusions are presented--the outcome at Toulouse assured the development of the Catholic Church as we know it; Vienna curtailed Turkish expansion in southeastern Europe. Particular religions and languages are up for grabs; the existence of civilization itself is not. The title should not misrepresent the article.</li>
</ul>
<p>Given the premise of the article, an accurate title might be <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battles_of_macrohistorical_importance_involving_invasions_of_Europe_9477.html" title="Battles of macrohistorical importance involving invasions of Europe">Battles of macrohistorical importance involving invasions of Europe</a>, or Battles of macrohistorical importance between Europeans and invaders. These aren't great but they fit the article. Any thoughts? <a href="../../../e/w/u/User%7EEwulp_8154.html" title="User:Ewulp">Ewulp</a> 06:15, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p><a href="../../../e/w/u/User%7EEwulp_8154.html" title="User:Ewulp">Ewulp</a> I agree with all your conclusions above. I think a reasonable compromise might be <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battles_of_macrohistorical_importance_involving_invasions_of_Europe_9477.html" title="Battles of macrohistorical importance involving invasions of Europe">Battles of macrohistorical importance involving invasions of Europe</a> which would be far more accurate than the present title. The biggest problem with the present title is the word "civilization" (or "civilisation," as the author wrote it). All the battles listed carried huge impact for particular religions, cultures, and languages; all were, as <a href="../../../e/w/u/User%7EEwulp_8154.html" title="User:Ewulp">Ewulp</a> noted, up for grabs in those battles which at least two modern historians said they determined, but the existence of civilization itself was not in danger - it was what type of civilization that was. The title should not misrepresent the article. Basically the battles listed all defended a Greeco-Roman Culture that evolved into present day Orthadox and Roman Catholic Europe. (I would also argue that if we include Turkey we should include Manzikert, and the Battle of Ankara on July 20, 1402, plus the 717 seige of Constandinople, and it's fall to Memet the Conquerer.

<dd>Although the debate is difficult, I am pleased to see that some are willing to negotiate and find consensus. The recurrent use of the term "political correctness" clearly state the xenophobic POV of those not willing to negotiate — let's be clear on that. And don't call me a radical because I state that, as I've mentionned several times my POV is supported by many European states, many historians, lots of philosophers, etc. I will spare all of us another enumeration of sources concerning that. The main problems concerns the use of the concept of "macrohistory", as well as the use of the term "European civilization". If I've brought out the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Trek_8707.html" title="Great Trek">Great Trek</a> story, it is not at all by pure provocation. If you read <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hannah_Arendt_0a8a.html" title="Hannah Arendt">Hannah Arendt</a>'s <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Origins_of_Totalitarianism_663c.html" title="The Origins of Totalitarianism">The Origins of Totalitarianism</a></i>, tome II on Imperialism, you will see that the Afrikaneers were fleeing from "European civilization", and of the best part of European civilization: the <a href="../../../e/n/l/Enlightenment.html" title="Enlightenment">Enlightenment</a> and the abolition of slavery. H. Arendt is hardly a radical philosopher, although her thoughts may certainly disturb some far-right radicals who can't even carry out a <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communicative_rationality.html" title="Communicative rationality">rational debate</a>. If you do insist on including the idea - and not the concept (see <a href="../../../i/m/m/Immanuel_Kant_5dcb.html" title="Immanuel Kant">Immanuel Kant</a>'s distinction between an idea &amp; a concept) of a "European civilization", you will inevitably have to engage the whole of <a href="../../../w/e/s/Western_civilization.html" title="Western civilization">Western civilization</a>. Europe, as you know, has had a history of <a href="../../../i/m/p/Imperialism.html" title="Imperialism">imperialism</a>, which has lead it to spread its culture around, and not only in the "New World." Refusing to adress these concerns, on the grounds that they are too "philosophical", is simply admitting that the current title and idea of the article is POV and can not be defended against criticisms from some of the best <a href="../../../w/e/s/Western_philosophy.html" title="Western philosophy">representants of Western philosophy</a> as well as historians. Titling the article Invasions of Europe would at least have the advantage of being more straight-forward. Now, if you insist on retaining the epithets of "Macrohistorical", "Important Battles", etc., and tied it to "European civilization", in all logics you <i>will</i> have to include <a href="../../../w/a/r/Wars_of_religion.html" title="Wars of religion">wars of religion</a>, both <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_7bf7.html" title="World War">World Wars</a>, the <a href="../../../n/a/p/Napoleonic_War_8511.html" title="Napoleonic War">Napoleonic Wars</a>, etc.: don't tell me that these wars have not "engaged the existence of European civilization". Who can argue that the current aspect of Europe would have been the same if the <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_Revolution_970a.html" title="French Revolution">French Revolution</a> had been crushed in the egg, instead of being successfully maintained in its basic aspects by the <a href="../../../d/i/r/Directorate.html" title="Directorate">Directorate</a> and Napoleon? Read <a href="../../../h/e/g/Hegel.html" title="Hegel">Hegel</a> numerous works on <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philosophy_of_history.html" title="Philosophy of history">philosophy of history</a>. See Kant's amazement at the news of the French Revolution. Henceforth, there aren't many choices left: either you insist on maintaining this article on a "Us vs Them" slant, which I personally do not support as it is a simplistic reading of history which, willingly or not, carries out ideological undertones. In this case, name this article Invasions of Europe. Or you choose to insist on "European civilization"; but them you have to accept that the European Civil War, as some historians have called World War I, is one of the main battle which has engaged "European civilization". Another important problem is the confusion between Europe as a geographical place and Europe as a "civilization". As I and others have repeatedly point out, the concept of "Europe civilization" is grounded on the assumption of a monolithic European civilization, which would be Christian before everything. This is not only ignoring main thinkers of the European tradition, such as <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spinoza.html" title="Spinoza">Spinoza</a>, <a href="../../../v/o/l/Voltaire.html" title="Voltaire">Voltaire</a>, etc., the European conception of a <a href="../../../s/e/c/Secular_state.html" title="Secular state">secular state</a>. It is also reviving Wars of Religion and supporting <a href="../../../s/a/m/Samuel_Huntington_e6ae.html" title="Samuel Huntington">Samuel Huntington</a>'s controversial theory on the so-called "<a href="../../../c/l/a/Clash_of_civilization.html" title="Clash of civilization">clash of civilizations</a>". Concerning the sneaky comments about "political correctness", I've been used on Wikipedia of discussing with smarter people who rationally and openly support their far-right views. At least, <i>they</i> don't engage in political correctness, being able to engage in rational debates concerning their political opinions. For these anonyms users, I urge them to read and meditate the entry on <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communicative_rationality.html" title="Communicative rationality">communicative rationality</a>: honesty is a prerequisite of discussion. If you don't want to engage in discussion, let honest editors, such as Old Windy Bear &amp; others, debate.

<li>Oldwindybear and his ilk are almost as bad as the politically correct editors, because they refuse to engage them. His willingness to compromise is no virtue, to paraphrase someone who said the willingness to compromise your principles is no virtue! I have read Hegel, and Nietzsche. I think that the predominant European civilization should be represented - and it is Christian! No one wants to come out and say that most of the great battles fought since the explosion of Islam unto the world stage were those of desperate Christians fighting them off! <a href="../../../f/i/n/User%7EFinishedwithschool_ee3e.html" title="User:Finishedwithschool">Finishedwithschool</a> 18:07, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Sorry but I cannot agree with you, anybody who has lived in Europe will confirm that Christianity is part of the European culture, but only in counted regions the predominant identification point. And those Christians were mostly (well unless we take the 8th and 9th centuries) not as desperate as Roldan's chant would make anyone believe. Most of those desperate acts were driven by very strong economical interests and those who truly wanted to believe misused as cannon fodder to increase the richness of the likes of the Fugger family. This has also to be said in the name of political incorrectness <a href="../../../a/l/f/User%7EAlf_photoman_ad72.html" title="User:Alf photoman"><font face="Amazone BT">Alf</font><font face="Aldine401 BT" size="2"><sup>Photoman</sup></font></a> 18:16, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I agree. The Battle of Ankara on July 20, 1402, is as much an invasion of Europe as any of the others, (and if anyone wonders why it is not listed, it is because I have not found two modern historians that say it had macrohistorical impact), and it was a nominal muslim Timur, against the Sultan of the Ottomans. Further, I deeply resent any implication that our attempts to reach a compromise all can live with is anything other than the best of wikipedia, consensus, and not any form of political correctness. Further, anyone who has studied the franks knows that Martel would have opposed the Bzyantine Emperor with as much ferocity as he did the Umayyads. It was political, not religious, though certainly he used the religious card in rallying troops. I still think a reasonable compromise might be <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battles_of_macrohistorical_importance_involving_invasions_of_Europe_9477.html" title="Battles of macrohistorical importance involving invasions of Europe">Battles of macrohistorical importance involving invasions of Europe</a> as proposed by <a href="../../../e/w/u/User%7EEwulp_8154.html" title="User:Ewulp">Ewulp</a> and approved by <a href="../../../a/l/f/User%7EAlf_photoman_ad72.html" title="User:Alf photoman"><font face="Amazone BT">Alf</font><font face="Aldine401 BT" size="2"><sup>Photoman</sup></font></a> which would be far more accurate than the present title. <a href="../../../o/l/d/User%7EOldwindybear_14b1.html" title="User:Oldwindybear">old windy bear</a> 20:58, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'll support the previous positions arguing Christianity is part of European cultural identity and a feature of "European civilization" in almost any definition. Christianity doesn't mean a simple belief in certain type of god, but it's a whole philosophical and cultural framework developed since the Late Antiquity onwards, experiencing a rise, a culmination and a fall. European secularism could be defined post-Christian as announced by Nietzsche et al.. A tricky question is when to stop looking for events shaping Europe. It is clear that in this perspective after one moment in time we cannot speak anymore of such an "European" civilization: due to a change in values, in views, this "European spirit" dilluted (and merged with elements worldwide) in something we call today "Western civilization" which tends to cover the entire globe. This civilization is "the civilization". Its values (e.g. democracy, human rights, technological progress, etc.) are universal (I'm leaving aside that since the 20th century, several historiographies refined their discourse and came up with more complex and nuanced views on the history and how the events shaped our becoming during centuries; I already argued for consensus' sake I'm willing to accept as a historiographical representative position one supported by at least two relatively recent historians). These being said, probably a terminus ante quem for this "battle-history of Europe" should be chosen from: a) the French revolution b) the Napoleonic wars c) WWI d) other proposals?</dd>
<dd>In these battles I don't think it's necessarily though for the defenders to be Christians or "Europeans". Perhaps some historians believe (at this moment I can't think of any believing that, that's why I'm saying "perhaps") the battle of Ankara was providential saving Europe from Beyazit's wrath.</dd>
<dd>The model of invasions meets the same difficulties as the concept of Europe itself. When one can pretend it was an invasion of Europe or not? Defining Europe is vital to any alternative we would find for this article.</dd>
<dd>So I'll end up with a hopefully clarifying proposal: let's call Europe that core of culture and civilization which intermediated between the Graeco-Roman world and the modern civilization, "the civilization" as I have previously called it. <a href="../../../d/a/i/User%7EDaizus_dd8f.html" title="User:Daizus">Daizus</a> 09:35, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Ankara was important in that at least one modern historian - Norwich - says that the battle of Ankara was providential saving Europe from Beyazit's wrath, and in giving Constandinople another 50 years of existence, and another 50 years in blocking and protecting Europe from the oncoming Ottomans. I have not, however, found a second for that.

<li>On general principle, I hate to agree, but I am going to. He came up with a good compromise, and a workable definition. I hate to agree with oldwindybear, but Tamerlane actually gave Europe breathing room when he shattered the Ottomans at the Battle of Ankara. I went this morning and looked up Norwich's reference, and he is right, Norwich does say in his Bzyantine series that Tamerlane's destruction of the Ottomans gave the dying Bzyantine Empire another half century of existence, and Europe badly needed breathing room before the Ottomans fell upon them. Had Tamerlane not destroyed Beyazit, "the Lightening," as he was known, would have taken Constandinople a half century before it fell, and been in Austria 10 years later. <a href="../../../f/i/n/User%7EFinishedwithschool_ee3e.html" title="User:Finishedwithschool">Finishedwithschool</a> 17:14, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

Look at the state of Europe in 1402 - ALL of eastern Europe was gearing up for the great struggle between the Teutonic Knights and Poland, et al, which would result in Grunwald only 8 years later! France, England, were exhausted and devoid of money or men as the Hundred Years war was eating them both, with English civil war around the period of Beyazit's rule. In short, had Timur ah Link not destroyed Beyazit and his ferocious Ottoman army, Beyazit would have taken Constandinople a half century earlier than it fell - and then, with no barrier to stop them, the Ottomans would have advanced on into the heart of Europe. Unlike later, when the Holy League, Poland, Spain, all contributed troops and treasure to resist the Ottomans, NONE had either in 1402! ANYWAY, if I can find another respected modern historian, I would add Ankara, because it surely saved Europe from Beyazit.</dd>

<dd>I agree that macrohistorical is a rather strange word, important or decisive would be better, furthermore I feel that this is problematic, especially the battle of the Metaurus, since the Romans were exterminating Celtic tribes and these started to fight back before Hannibal and Hasdrubal entered Italy and brought Rome close to defeat with their help.

<dd>I'll make the redirect since this new article has been created. I still prefer Important battles in the history of Europe, but this title is better and less POV (as I hear Europe here as a geographical expression, more than an Occident vs. Orient "clash of civilizations"). Concerning the "last battle" as Daisus put it, I think <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_I_9429.html" title="World War I">World War I</a> is better than the Napoleonic War, because, as Daizus has pointed out, Europe used to conceive of itself as "the" civilization, and it was not until WWI (and not Napoleon) that it really realized that there were others "civilizations" out there (starting by the US which imposed themselves at the Peace Conference as arbitrors). Contrary to our other friend out there, I do think it is important to reach consensus, and thus agree on this move - despite noting that I still dissent from this use of the concept "macrohistorical" which is too much a <a href="../../../f/u/z/Fuzzy_concept.html" title="Fuzzy concept">fuzzy concept</a>.

I think the new title is a vast improvement on the old, and while it is not my first choice either, it is something we all can live with! On to the date - I am okay with WWI, because Taz has a legitimate point that until the US literally forced itself into the mix, with the 14 points, that the traditional European powers, France, England, Germany, Italy, et al, really realized that there were others "civilizations" out there. So is everyone okay with changing to WWI as our ending date for the invasions?

<dd>I have been thinking about this article and I think the big problem is that we do present here the POV of a group of historians, no agreed upon facts. Vienna for example was a battle between the acclaimed Roman Catholic successor of the Western Roman Empire against the acclaimed Sunni Islamic successor of the Eastern Roman Empire(the Turks very much stressed their Roman ties via the <a href="../../../s/u/l/Sultanate_of_R%C3%BBm_3094.html" title="Sultanate of Rûm">Sultanate of Rûm</a> and even contemporaries like <a href="../../../m/a/c/Machiavelli.html" title="Machiavelli">Machiavelli</a> considered their government quite similar to what they knew about the Romans). The problem is no matter who won or lost both claimed to belong to the Roman culture (and the Turks were probably a little bit more right with their claim). This leads directly to the next issue what is the Graeco-Roman world the authors refer to in this context? For example the whole Punic Wars were fought between to barbaric, but hellenised countries and both of them knew rites such as human sacrifices, including babies(Punic poisoned and burned them, Romans put them in a basket and made them sail the oceans). As a result of Carthage losing quite a lot of important Greek cities were sacked and lost their short lived independence. I just wonder what Greek world would have been saved, no matter who won.</dd>
<dd>All in all a possible approach could be:</dd>
<dd>'Battles of macrohistorical importance involving invasions of Europe' is a term coined by Foo in his work blabla in 19xx. He considers the outcome of these battles as essential in determining whether or not non-European powers were able to yield their influence on the part of Europe he refers to as the Graco-Roman world. In this context the term Graeco-Roman means blupblup. The following historians have taken up thisd idea in their works blabla or argued against it blabla. Generally in these works the following battles have been considered as qualifying according to the listed reasons.</dd>
<dd>It is just the same like writing about constant class-fighting which is an issue in Marxist historiography, but not a POV everybody agrees upon, especially if Graeco Roman world is used, which does include Mesopotamia before the sack of Bagdad for example or if you use the Turkish POV, than crushing the Rum(=Roman) Seljuq Empire did have lots of impact. <a href="../../../w/a/n/User%7EWandalstouring_ea93.html" title="User:Wandalstouring">Wandalstouring</a> 18:46, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><a href="../../../w/a/n/User%7EWandalstouring_ea93.html" title="User:Wandalstouring">Wandalstouring</a> You are absolutely correct - especially on the Ottoman consideration that they were the true heirs to Rome. The first thing Mehmet the Conquerer did after taking Constandinople, was to assert his right as Caesar to rule over the entire Roman Empire, especially those provinces in the West which he considered to be broken away (but still part of) the Empire. I stress I did not write this article, and thus am rewriting as we go along, to keep a good idea - a list of invasions which two or more modern historians said had macrohistorical impact - while not fostering POV. It is a work in progress, which has just begun. I will do more reading, and come up with a better definition to correct the deficiencies you pointed out. All of these battles, for instance, are in Paul K. Davis's book, <i>100 Decisive Battles</i> so I may find the necessary language there, I will reread. <a href="../../../o/l/d/User%7EOldwindybear_14b1.html" title="User:Oldwindybear">old windy bear</a> 10:13, 13 March 2007 (UTC)

<p>I have some problems with the intro, because it is not always evident that historians support the interpretation of cultural significance we use.</p>
<p>Currently the list of battles is focused on battles of importance for the Western and Central European area where Catholicism and the later protestants are dominant. With the <a href="../../../r/e/n/Renaissance.html" title="Renaissance">Renaissance</a>, ancient Greece became increasingly a cultural ancestor of this region. One of the problems is that while we do list historians, we do neglect to list at least the dates and context of their statements. I consider this a serious mistake when handling such an article about historiography.</p>
<p>Current intro:</p>
<p>'This is a list of battles which at least two historians have written were of macrohistorical importance between European nation-states—or European polities recognized by historians as independent nation-states—and invading outside forces. It does not include battles of macrohistorical importance where both opposing factions were European, and it examines only those battles which two or more modern historians believe to have massively affected the course of history. For purposes of this article "Europe" is that core of culture and civilization which intermediated between the Graeco-Roman world and the modern civilization.'</p>
<p>My proposal(feel free to edit):</p>
<p>'The outcome of battles have often been assessed by historians in respect to their influence on the development of states or cultures. The scope of this article is to provide an overview about the outcome of battles which at least two historians have considered of lasting cultural or political importance for European nation-states—or European polities recognized by historians as independent nation-states—and invading outside forces. It does not include the battles where both opposing factions were European, but may contain battles where both opposing forces belonged to a similar culture, and it examines only those battles which two or more historians since 1960 believe to have massively affected the course of history. The historians consulted on the subject considered European culture and civilization as a development from the Graeco-Roman world to the modern civilizations of that area, which did and does not include all of Europe within its defined geographic borders.' <a href="../../../w/a/n/User%7EWandalstouring_ea93.html" title="User:Wandalstouring">Wandalstouring</a> 13:41, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

I think the revised intro is acceptable. Certainly it is acceptable - such as with Tours - to cite older historians, but you have to also cite at least two - Martin and Wallace, or Davis and Hanson - that are modern within the 1960 (this generation) definition.

However, a huge number of historians, including two modern ones who are specifically named - thus meeting the article's criteria - regard Thermopylae as the Greek Alamo, a "defeat" which not only cost the enemy an inordinate number of casualities, delayed him for a vital period while the remainder of Greece rallied, but inspired all Greeks, including many who were wavering and considering settling with Xerses. Having lived in Greece as a younger person, I can tell you from personal experience that no Greek I knew regarded Thermopylae as a "defeat;" quite the opposite. They proudly regarded it as the ultimate example of courage and discipline, giving up one's life to delay the enemy and buy time for your country.

<dd>Yes; even though it was a Persian victory, it was a pyrrhic one, in that it cost Xerxes many men and it gave the Greeks two extremely important things - first, the morale and the wish to fight back the Persians; and second, it bought the rest of Greece vital time to reorganise their troops, without which they would probably have been crushed.

While Thermopylae was highly memorable, and undisputably important for the Greeks, if that battle hadn't been followed by victory at Salamis Thermopylae would have been for naught except for the stories later told of the heroism there. Thermopylae may be the most famous of all famous last stands, but for battles of strategic importance in that campaign Salamis seem to me to be the obvious candidate. jax 20:10, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree absolutely with <a href="../../../w/a/n/User%7EWandalstouring_ea93.html" title="User:Wandalstouring">Wandalstouring</a> . The historians now cited all flatly state that but for Thermopylae the fleet would have been destroyed - it bought time that was absolutely vital. If you have historians that say otherwise, (and there are some, I can think of three, offhand) we can either add Salamis or put in an opposing view section to the current article, whichever the majority wants. <a href="../../../o/l/d/User%7EOldwindybear_14b1.html" title="User:Oldwindybear">old windy bear</a> 21:05, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Nice work bringing this up to B class so quickly! The conflicts have been good for the article--friction coming from both sides makes a sharper knife, and it usually has the same effect in Wikipedia. I've spotted two lines that I think need either to be rephrased or sourced because as written they appear to present OR/POV problems. There may be some others but these two caught my eye. The first is in the Thermopylae section: "It is usually believed that this battle has a greater macrohistorical importance than that of the Battle of Marathon which had taken place a decade earlier." What would be needed here is not a source--or several sources--supporting the view that Thermopylae is more important than Marathon; it should be a source saying "it is usually believed" or words to that effect.</p>
<p>The other is in Battle of Toulouse:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"There are historians such as Toulouse historian Sydney Forado who believe the Battle of Toulouse halted the muslim conquest of Europe even more than the later—and more celebrated—Battle of Tours (October 10, 732, between Tours and Poitiers). This is highly problematic, however, because even had the Arabs won at Toulouse, they still would have had to conquer the Franks to have retained control of the region. However, virtually all historians agree that the Christian victory at Toulouse was important in a macrohistorical sense..."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unless an historian can be cited who calls Forado's position problematic, this appears to be stacking the deck by naming him only to call his idea problematic. <a href="../../../e/w/u/User%7EEwulp_8154.html" title="User:Ewulp">Ewulp</a> 05:08, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd><a href="../../../e/w/u/User%7EEwulp_8154.html" title="User:Ewulp">Ewulp</a> The Toulouse issue - you were right, and it is taken care of! Sir Charles Oman was one historian who stated had the Arabs won at Toulouse, they still would have had to conquer the Franks to have retained control of the region, and the section is rewritten, with he and Paul Davis cited for more accurate language. As for the quotation in the Thermopylae section, that is going to require some research -Doctor France - you wrote that, what was your source? If you don't answer, I will investigate, and as of now, I used what books I had, by Grant, and others, and rewrote it to eliminate language that could not be sourced, at least not by me. <a href="../../../e/w/u/User%7EEwulp_8154.html" title="User:Ewulp">Ewulp</a> what do you think?<a href="../../../o/l/d/User%7EOldwindybear_14b1.html" title="User:Oldwindybear">old windy bear</a> 17:07, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello <a href="../../../o/l/d/User%7EOldwindybear_14b1.html" title="User:Oldwindybear">old windy bear</a>, this looks much better. I adjusted one sentence to avoid any impression that Oman (writing in 1901) was directly answering Forado (writing ca.2000). <a href="../../../e/w/u/User%7EEwulp_8154.html" title="User:Ewulp">Ewulp</a> 05:27, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Effectively, I cannot source that. As I put it in the article, it is "generally" believed that Thermopylae was more important than Marathon, because the latter was in no way a decisive battle of the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greco-Persian_wars_eb1a.html" title="Greco-Persian wars">Greco-Persian wars</a>, even though it was the first time the Greeks had bested the Persians on land <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Marathon_775b.html#Aftermath" title="Battle of Marathon">Battle_of_Marathon#Aftermath</a>. -- Doctor France 07:59, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
