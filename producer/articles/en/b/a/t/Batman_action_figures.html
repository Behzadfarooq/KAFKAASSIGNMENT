<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/t/Batman_action_figures.html" title="Edit section: Captain Action">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Captain Action</span></h2>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/6/1966.html" title="1966">1966</a>, the <a href="../../../i/d/e/Ideal_Toy_Company_aefb.html" title="Ideal Toy Company">Ideal Toy Company</a> launched a line of super hero <a href="../../../d/o/l/Doll.html" title="Doll">dolls</a> called <a href="../../../c/a/p/Captain_Action_b589.html" title="Captain Action">Captain Action</a> in response to <a href="../../../h/a/s/Hasbro.html" title="Hasbro">Hasbro</a>'s popular <a href="../../../g/2E/i/G.I._Joe_2dc8.html" title="G.I. Joe">G.I. Joe</a> line. The Captain Action doll came dressed with a <a href="../../../c/l/o/Cloth.html" title="Cloth">cloth</a> super hero costume, hat, ray gun, and sword, ready for kids to enjoy. But parents could also buy additional super hero <a href="../../../c/o/s/Costume.html" title="Costume">costumes</a> that were sold separately. Kids could take Captain Action's costume off and replace it with one of several super hero costumes based on famous <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comic_book.html" title="Comic book">comic book</a> <a href="../../../f/i/c/Fictional_character.html" title="Fictional character">characters</a>.</p>
<p>A <a href="../../../b/a/t/Batman.html" title="Batman">Batman</a> costume was included in Captain Action's arsenal. This Batman costume was detailed with a horizontally striped cape as well as a black and gold chest emblem (the costume set was available with both metal and decal chest emblems). Batman's accessories included a blue Batarang, flash light, and drill which could attach to the <a href="../../../u/t/i/Utility_belt.html" title="Utility belt">utility belt</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/6/1967.html" title="1967">1967</a>, the Ideal Toy Company released a partner doll for Captain Action, his youthful sidekick, Action Boy. Ideal Toy's released only three costumes for Action Boy to change into, one of them being <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robin_%28comics%29.html" title="Robin (comics)">Robin</a>, Batman's sidekick.</p>
<p><a name="Mego" id="Mego"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/t/Batman_action_figures.html" title="Edit section: Mego">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Mego</span></h2>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/7/1972.html" title="1972">1972</a>, The <a href="../../../m/e/g/Mego_Corporation_1423.html" title="Mego Corporation">Mego Corporation</a> released their own line of <a href="../../../d/c/_/DC_Comics_9a75.html" title="DC Comics">DC Comics</a> character and <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marvel_Comics_b294.html" title="Marvel Comics">Marvel Comics</a> character dolls called The World's Greatest Super Heroes!. This line of 8" dolls featured many Batman characters, including Batman, Robin, <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catwoman.html" title="Catwoman">Catwoman</a>, and <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Joker_%28comics%29_77f9.html" title="The Joker (comics)">The Joker</a>. Like Ideal Toy's Captain Action line, these figures featured cloth costumes that fans could remove. Unlike Ideal Toy's Captain Action line, however, the costumes came with the figure, and were not sold separately.</p>
<p>Realizing the success of the 8" line of dolls, and wanting to offer fans more for less, Mego Corp. released a smaller plastic line of action toys called Comic Action Heroes! in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1975.html" title="1975">1975</a>. The Comic Action Heroes did not have any moving parts, like small plastic statues. The line featured several Batman characters as well as other DC Comics characters. Later, in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1979.html" title="1979">1979</a>, Mego re-released the line under the new name Pocket Super Heroes, a name that would return more than 20 years later as part of <a href="../../../d/c/_/DC_Direct_63e6.html" title="DC Direct">DC Direct</a>'s super hero line of figures (see below).</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/t/Batman_action_figures.html" title="Edit section: The Super Powers Collection">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Super Powers Collection</span></h2>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/8/1984.html" title="1984">1984</a>, the <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kenner.html" title="Kenner">Kenner</a> toy company was granted the rights to produce DC Comics character figures, and soon after, the Super Powers Collection of action figures hit toy shelves. Each figure, as the name implies, had a secret super power that would trigger when the figure's arms or legs were squeezed. Kenner produced 3 different Super Powers lines, ending production before such rumored Batman character figures as Catwoman and <a href="../../../m/a/n/Man-Bat_ae69.html" title="Man-Bat">Man-Bat</a> were produced.</p>
<p>During its time on the market, however, the Super Powers Collection managed to release the first-ever 5" action figures of Batman, Robin, The Joker, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Penguin_571c.html" title="The Penguin">The Penguin</a>, and <a href="../../../m/r/2E/Mr._Freeze_bbb2.html" title="Mr. Freeze">Mr. Freeze</a>. Toy shelves also reserved space for an accurately styled <a href="../../../b/a/t/Batmobile.html" title="Batmobile">Batmobile</a> and a <a href="../../../b/a/t/Batcopter.html" title="Batcopter">Batcopter</a> that would later be reproduced in black &amp; gold for The Dark Knight Collection of <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990.html" title="1990">1990</a> (see Kenner Film Figures).</p>

<p>Since Kenner had stopped production of DC Comics character figures in 1986 when the Super Powers line folded, DC Comics granted the license to the up and coming toy company, <a href="../../../t/o/y/Toy_Biz_3fd1.html" title="Toy Biz">Toy Biz</a>, in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1989.html" title="1989">1989</a>. Toy Biz first produced figures for the <i><a href="../../../b/a/t/Batman_%281989_movie%29.html" title="Batman (1989 movie)">Batman</a></i> movie tie-in, then released other DC Comics character figures under the name DC Comics Super Heroes, a name that would later be used again by different toy companies (see below). <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Flash_%28TV_series%29_2d64.html" title="The Flash (TV series)">The Flash</a></i> TV series character received a tie-in figure from Toy Biz as well.</p>
<p>Also in 1989, the <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_American_1d95.html" title="South American">South American</a> toy company Pacipa bought old Super Powers molds to create a line of DC Comics character figures called Super Amigos. Exclusive to South America, all of the figures were reproductions of Super Powers figures, but made with a low quality plastic and poor paint jobs. This collection also gave way to a Riddler action figure in the form of a repainted <a href="../../../g/r/e/Green_Lantern_12db.html" title="Green Lantern">Green Lantern</a> base sculpt. A rare piece, this figure is highly saught after by collectors.</p>
<p>Back in the US, the Toy Biz line brought some new figures to the shelves not previously featured in the Super Powers line including <a href="../../../t/w/o/Two-Face_e8c6.html" title="Two-Face">Two-Face</a> and <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Riddler_e2d1.html" title="The Riddler">The Riddler</a>. Like Pacipa's Super Amigos, the figures featured low quality plastic, and the majority were slightly retooled reproductions of the Super Powers line from Kenner. DC Comics noticed the poor quality of the figures, and quickly cancelled the license, awarding it back to Kenner.</p>

Batman movie figures</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The same year that Toy Biz won and lost the rights to produce DC Comics figures, Kenner quickly regained the rights and quickly produced a line of Batman movie figures, the first DC Comics character figures produced by Kenner in four years.</p>
<p>Kenner's Dark Knight Collection consisted of several versions of Batman, set apart only by different paint jobs and unique accessories. A Quick-Change Bruce Wayne and two versions of the Joker made up the rest of the figure line. The Dark Knight Collection also boasted several vehicles including a Batmobile and Turbo <a href="../../../b/a/t/Batwing.html" title="Batwing">Batwing</a> as well as role playing toys.</p>
<p>When the feature film <i><a href="../../../b/a/t/Batman_Returns_dae5.html" title="Batman Returns">Batman Returns</a></i> hit theaters in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1992.html" title="1992">1992</a>, Kenner renamed their movie line <i><a href="../../../b/a/t/Batman_Returns_dae5.html" title="Batman Returns">Batman Returns</a></i>. This new line included several versions of the same Batman figure sculpt as seen in the previous Dark Knight Collection line. The movie's two villains, Catwoman and Penguin, received their own figures. Catwoman received a new sculpt, but the Penguin figure was a repainted sculpt from Kenner's Super Power's line.</p>
<p>A new Robin figure based on his comic book counterpart was also introduced in the line even though the character was not in the movie.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/9/1995.html" title="1995">1995</a>, <i><a href="../../../b/a/t/Batman_Forever_1d7b.html" title="Batman Forever">Batman Forever</a></i> was released featuring <a href="../../../v/a/l/Val_Kilmer_5daf.html" title="Val Kilmer">Val Kilmer</a> as the Dark Knight. Breaking away from the repetitive base sculpt of the previous two movie collections, Kenner produced Batman Forever figures using a wider range of fresh sculpts.</p>
<p><a href="../../../t/a/r/Target_Corporation_8dc1.html" title="Target Corporation">Target</a> eventually released their own series of exclusive Batman Forever action figures as well. These were simply repainted figures from the original line, and they came on a newly styled card.</p>
<p>For the <a href="../../../1/9/9/1997.html" title="1997">1997</a> release of <a href="../../../b/a/t/Batman_%26_Robin_634f.html" title="Batman &amp; Robin">Batman &amp; Robin</a>, the final Batman film of the 90s, Kenner released the Batman &amp; Robin figure line. Unlike previous movie lines, the Batman &amp; Robin line featured several versions of the movie's villains, not just heroes. Kenner also released several hero/villain 2-packs and 12" figures.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/t/Batman_action_figures.html" title="Edit section: Batman: The Animated Series">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Batman: The Animated Series</span></h2>
<p>Shortly after the <a href="../../../1/9/9/1992.html" title="1992">1992</a> premiere of <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/Batman%7E_The_Animated_Series_3563.html" title="Batman: The Animated Series">Batman: The Animated Series</a></i>, Kenner produced a line of figures based on the new cartoon. Like the previous two Batman movie lines, the first few lines of figures included several versions of Batman, and also included multiple versions of Robin and new villains including <a href="../../../c/l/a/Clayface.html" title="Clayface">Clayface</a>, <a href="../../../s/c/a/Scarecrow_%28comics%29.html" title="Scarecrow (comics)">Scarecrow</a>, <a href="../../../p/o/i/Poison_Ivy_%28comics%29_4805.html" title="Poison Ivy (comics)">Poison Ivy</a>, and others.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/9/1993.html" title="1993">1993</a>, another Batman movie was released, an animated feature film called <i><a href="../../../m/a/s/Batman%7E_Mask_of_the_Phantasm_b867.html" title="Batman: Mask of the Phantasm">Batman: Mask of the Phantasm</a></i>. Kenner produced Mask of the Phantasm figures using old Batman: T.A.S. molds and only a few new sculpts such as Jet Pack Joker and Phantasm.</p>
<p>As time went by, Kenner's Batman: T.A.S. line began losing steam, so Kenner retooled some of their figures, releasing Batman: T.A.S.: Crime Squad. This line had several Batman variations, but only included one Robin figure, and no villain figures.</p>
<p>Later, Kenner renamed this line <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Adventures_of_Batman_%26_Robin_567e.html" title="The Adventures of Batman &amp; Robin">The Adventures of Batman &amp; Robin</a>, releasing several figures that were not released as part of the Batman: T.A.S. line, the most famous being a <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harley_Quinn_f479.html" title="Harley Quinn">Harley Quinn</a> figure, based on the popular animated series character.</p>
<p>Like Batman: T.A.S., The Adventures of Batman &amp; Robin line started to lose steam as well, so Kenner released The Adventures of Batman &amp; Robin: D.U.O. Force. Despite its introduction of a <a href="../../../b/a/t/Batgirl.html" title="Batgirl">Batgirl</a> figure, the collection primarily featured repaints of old molds with new accessories and quickly folded.</p>
<p><a name="The_New_Batman_Adventures" id="The_New_Batman_Adventures"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/t/Batman_action_figures.html" title="Edit section: The New Batman Adventures">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The New Batman Adventures</span></h2>
<p>As <a href="../../../h/a/s/Hasbro.html" title="Hasbro">Hasbro</a> bought out Kenner, a new line of action figures were produced by Hasbro based on the new animated series, <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_New_Batman_Adventures_c939.html" title="The New Batman Adventures">The New Batman Adventures</a></i>. This line featured new sculpts based on the updated animated series from the WB network. The first <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creeper_%28comics%29.html" title="Creeper (comics)">Creeper</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/d/Mad_Hatter_%28comics%29_4d53.html" title="Mad Hatter (comics)">Mad Hatter</a> figures were included in this line.</p>
<p>After the first line of figures were released, The New Batman Adventures line took on the sub title Mission Masters. This line featured new Riddler and Mr. Freeze sculpts.</p>
<p>The second Mission Masters line featured repaints of old Batman: T.A.S. figures, including The Joker.</p>
<p>To move away from The New Batman Adventures line, Kenner/Hasbro released the third and fourth Mission Masers lines under the basic Batman title. Included were figures from Batman: The Animated Series, The New Batman Adventures, Kenner's Superman Adventures line, and some <a href="../../../b/a/t/Batman_Beyond_1992.html" title="Batman Beyond">Batman Beyond</a> (see below) figures. Also included was a new comic style <a href="../../../b/r/u/Bruce_Wayne_68b8.html" title="Bruce Wayne">Bruce Wayne</a>/Batman figure and an animated style insect body Mr. Freeze.</p>
<p>Later, Hasbro released several Batman: T.A.S., The Adventures of Batman and Robin, and The New Batman Adventures repaints in the Spectrum of the Bat action figure line.</p>
<p><a name="Batman_Beyond" id="Batman_Beyond"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/t/Batman_action_figures.html" title="Edit section: Batman Beyond">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Batman Beyond</span></h2>
<p>Hasbro released a new line of figures based on the new WB Batman cartoon <i>Batman Beyond</i>. This line, like all Batman lines in the past, featured many versions of Batman, but only a few versions of the cartoon's villains and no supporting characters.</p>
<p>Later, Hasbro released Batman Beyond: Bat-Links. Unlike Hasbro's earlier Batman Beyond toy line, this line was not based on the popular cartoon series, but had an Elseworlds computer theme.</p>
<p>A <i><a href="../../../r/e/t/Batman_Beyond%7E_Return_of_the_Joker_e85a.html" title="Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker">Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker</a></i> movie tie-in line of figures were produced which included several The New Batman Adventures figures as well as Batman Beyond Figures.</p>

<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/9/1994.html" title="1994">1994</a>, Kenner released a whole new line of Batman action figures which included all new sculpts instead of reused molds of old figures. The Legends of Batman line of figures included several <a href="../../../e/l/s/Elseworlds.html" title="Elseworlds">Elseworlds</a> versions of Batman, but also included true to comic versions of several Batman characters including <a href="../../../k/n/i/Batman%7E_Knightfall_428d.html" title="Batman: Knightfall">Knightfall</a> Batman, Knightquest Batman, <a href="../../../n/i/g/Nightwing.html" title="Nightwing">Nightwing</a>, The Joker, Catwoman and The Riddler. This line never gained popularity, though, and was cancelled soon after it's debut. Several years later, <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warner_Bros._b6cc.html" title="Warner Bros.">WB</a> Stores bought the rights to sell exclusive repainted sculpts of the Legends of Batman line of figures.</p>
<p>After the failed Legends of Batman line, Kenner gave the Elseworlds version of Batman figures one last shot by releasing Legends of the Dark Knight. Based on the popular comic of the same name, Legends of the Dark Knight featured all Elseworlds versions of Batman and other characters. The only character figures in this line to stay true to their comic images were Dark Knight Detective Batman, an online exclusive, and Man-Bat. Like Legends of Batman, this line never gained popularity, and was quickly cancelled. Later, a few unproduced figures from this line were offered as online exclusives.</p>

<p>Also in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1994.html" title="1994">1994</a>, Kenner moved away from their focus on DC's Batman, and released a <a href="../../../s/u/p/Superman.html" title="Superman">Superman</a> comic character line called Superman: The Man of Steel. This line featured several popular characters from the Superman comics, but also included several two-packs which featured Batman and Superman together. Two of the Superman/Batman figures later turned up as mail-away exclusives in the Batman: Total Justice line of figures (see below)</p>
<p><a name="Batman:_Total_Justice" id="Batman:_Total_Justice"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/t/Batman_action_figures.html" title="Edit section: Batman: Total Justice">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Batman: Total Justice</span></h2>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/9/1996.html" title="1996">1996</a>, Kenner started production on a new line of DC Comics character figures. This line, like Legends of Batman and Legends of the Dark Knight, featured all new sculpts of popular DC Comics characters. To appeal to buyers, Kenner produced the line under the high selling Batman title, calling the line Batman: Total Justice. This line featured not only Batman, Robin, and <a href="../../../h/u/n/Huntress.html" title="Huntress">The Huntress</a>, but also included other DC Comics characters including Superman, Green Lantern, The Flash and others.</p>
<p>Even though this was the first line of DC Comics character figures released by Kenner since the Super Powers line folded 10 years earlier, some fans were disappointed. Despite remarkably detailed sculpts, the figures' static poses and "Fractal Armor" accessories caused unhappiness. Wanting more articulation and less gimmick, some abandoned the Total Justice line, and Kenner stopped production after the release of 14 figures.</p>
<p>Two years later, the <a href="../../../h/a/s/Hasbro.html" title="Hasbro">Hasbro</a> toy company produced the same figures included in the Total Justice line, but this time released them under the name <a href="../../../j/l/a/JLA_2c9b.html" title="JLA">JLA</a> (a tie-in with the popular comic title). Several of the unproduced Total Justice figures were produced in this line, but no new Batman related characters were included. A redesigned Joker figure was included in a JLA box set.</p>

<p>Returning to the comic roots of Kenner's Super Powers line, Hasbro released a new line of 7" figures called DC Super Heroes. Unlike the earlier Toy Biz line by the same name, this line featured new sculpts with great detail. Only one line of figures were released, though, and they were very hard to find. The reason for the short life of a great line that had many possibilities remains unclear.</p>
<p>Hasbro also produced several Mego like dolls in the DC Super Hero line as well.</p>

<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/9/1998.html" title="1998">1998</a>, Kenner produced a new line of Batman figures called Batman: Knight Force Ninjas. This line, like Legends of Batman and Legends of the Dark Knight, featured all new sculpts of Batman in an Elseworld theme. The only two figures worth remembering in this line were the first ever <a href="../../../a/z/r/Azrael_%28comics%29.html" title="Azrael (comics)">Azrael</a> figure, and a new <a href="../../../k/i/l/Killer_Croc_3941.html" title="Killer Croc">Killer Croc</a> figure.</p>

<p>To please fans and collectors who wanted better figures, not just repaints, DC Comics started production on their own line of action figures. These highly articulated figures, based on popular DC Comics characters, feature many Batman characters, and also feature storyline inspired character figures including Elseworld figures.</p>
<p>DC Direct also released a new line of Pocket Super Heroes, mini action figures that kids could put in their pocket. The Pocket Super Heroes come in boxed sets, including a Batman boxed set featuring Batman, Bruce Wayne, Robin, <a href="../../../a/l/f/Alfred_Pennyworth_d0b8.html" title="Alfred Pennyworth">Alfred Pennyworth</a>, Catwoman and Two-Face.</p>

<p>To please fans around the globe, DC Comics gave a license to Japanese toy company Yamato to produce a line of Batman action figures. These figures were only released in Japan in 2003, but DC Direct released the same figures in America in 2004. Later, another Japanese toy company, Takara, created a new line of Batman action figures under their <a href="../../../m/i/c/Microman.html" title="Microman">Microman</a> Toyline. Featuring more articulation than the Yamato line, these figures also saw their American debut in 2004.</p>

<p>Around the same time as Mattel took over production of Batman and DC Comics character figures, <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bandai.html" title="Bandai">Bandai</a> released their own line of figures based on the Cartoon Network's animated series <i><a href="../../../t/e/e/Teen_Titans_%28animated_series%29_71e3.html" title="Teen Titans (animated series)">Teen Titans</a></i>. Teen Titans: Go! features several Robin figures of different sizes. Batman, however, has no place within the cartoon or action figure collection.</p>

<p>In 2003, <a href="../../../m/a/t/Mattel.html" title="Mattel">Mattel</a> won the rights to produce Batman and other DC Comics character figures from Hasbro. Before losing control, Hasbro released their final sets of Batman animated figures. Most figures were featured in two packs, and were store exclusives. <a href="../../../k/-/m/K-Mart_9a25.html" title="K-Mart">K-Mart</a>, <a href="../../../w/a/l/Wal-Mart_0d83.html" title="Wal-Mart">Wal-Mart</a> and <a href="../../../t/o/y/Toys_%27R%27_Us_c3b8.html" title="Toys 'R' Us">Toys 'R' Us</a> released these figures before Mattel took over production.</p>
<p>After Hasbro's line faded, Mattel quickly produced their own line of retooled Batman animated figures to tide fans over until they could release all new figure lines. Some figures were new sculpts, some were just repaints of old Kenner/Hasbro sculpts.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/t/Batman_action_figures.html" title="Edit section: The Batman">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Batman</span></h2>
<p>After the quickly released animated line faded, Mattel released a new Batman animated line based on WB's new animated series, <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Batman_8792.html" title="The Batman">The Batman</a></i>. The Batman line of figures featured all new sculpts and more articulation than past animated lines.</p>
<p>After several waves of figures hit toy shelves, Mattel renamed the line The Batman: EXP. The EXP (EXtreme Power) hero figures come with a weapon that, when a power battery is connected and turned, reveals an "extreme power" feature.</p>
<p>When The Batman: EXP line faded, a new line of animated figures were announced. ShadowTek, a line that features new animated Robin &amp; Killer Moth figures based on their cartoon counterparts, hit shelves in late 2006. This line also includes re-released figures from earlier lines as well, a growing Mattel staple.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/t/Batman_action_figures.html" title="Edit section: Batman Begins">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Batman Begins</span></h2>
<p>Mattel released a collection of figures based on the hit movie <i><a href="../../../b/a/t/Batman_Begins_16f4.html" title="Batman Begins">Batman Begins</a></i>. The line featured all new sculpts, but it had its share of problems. Most of the costumes and characters featured in the line didn't match their movie counterpart. Central characters such as Ninja Bruce Wayne, <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henri_Ducard_ea73.html" title="Henri Ducard">Ducard</a>, and <a href="../../../r/a/27/Ra%27s_Al_Ghul_afc4.html" title="Ra's Al Ghul">Ra's Al Ghul</a> all featured identical body sculpts with different head sculpts. Most figures had poor distribution, which caused fans and collectors to miss out on their favorite characters.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/t/Batman_action_figures.html" title="Edit section: Superman Returns">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Superman Returns</span></h2>
<p>In 2006, Mattel released a new life of Superman figures based on the blockbuster feature film <i><a href="../../../s/u/p/Superman_Returns_385b.html" title="Superman Returns">Superman Returns</a></i>. Like the <i>Batman Begins</i> line of movie style figures, the <i>Superman Returns</i> line featured several versions of the Man of Steel, and two different versions of the movie's villain, <a href="../../../l/e/x/Lex_Luthor_a258.html" title="Lex Luthor">Lex Luthor</a>. Many fans and collectors were not pleased with the figures for several different reasons. One major complaint was that each Superman figure shared the same body sculpt with a different head design or action feature to set the figures apart. The Luthor figures shared the same sculpt as well, with a snow jacket molded over one of the figure's bodies.</p>
<p>In 2007, the Superman Returns line of figures were re-released under the name Superman Returns: Man of Steel. The same sculpts were used for Superman and Lex Luthor, while two new villains, <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metallo.html" title="Metallo">Metallo</a> and <a href="../../../m/o/n/Mongul.html" title="Mongul">Mongul</a>, who are featured in the Superman Returns video game received their own sculpts. While some Superman figures received the same paint job, some had a silver paint scheme which set this line apart from the movie line.</p>

<p>Realizing that fans wanted better figures based on their favorite comic characters, like the Toy Biz figure line <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marvel_Legends_2299.html" title="Marvel Legends">Marvel Legends</a>, Mattel released a new line of Four Horsemen designed comic styled Batman figures featuring all new sculpts and weapons. The new Batman figures were taller than previously released Batman figures, and featured more articulation. Fans loved the line, but it quickly faded before the release of new figures, including Bane and Scarecrow figures. These two figures never made it to America, but were released overseas.</p>

<p>After the Four Horsemen styled Batman line folded, Mattel announced they would release more Four Horsemen style Batman figures, as well as new Superman figures, with the new DC Comics Super Heroes line of figures. Unlike Toy Biz's earlier line of poor quality figures by the same name, the new figures were just what DC Comic fans were waiting for. The first line of figures included Batman, Killer Croc, and the unreleased Bane and Scarecrow figures from the Four Horsemen's previous Batman line. Used and unused molds from Mattel's Batman line would be used in later DC Super Heroes waves of figures, including the previously released Robin and the new Azrael sculpt.</p>

The Justice League line features several Batman figures. Later, the line was renamed <i><a href="../../../j/u/s/Justice_League_Unlimited_c8c8.html" title="Justice League Unlimited">Justice League Unlimited</a></i>, in order to keep up with changes made to the cartoon series.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>, Mattel released several of the Justice League Unlimited figures under the name DC Super Heroes: Justice League Unlimited.
