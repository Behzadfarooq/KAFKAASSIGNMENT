<hr />
<p>On the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_UK_geography_6ecd.html#Resources_and_guidelines" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject UK geography">project page</a> you can find detailed guides on how to write about counties and settlements, as well as where to find statistics, references and other useful things. Additionally, the following have been identified as specific improvements this article needs:<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Government</i></li>
<li><b>Divisions of Bath</b></li>
<li>Possible split of history section to History of Bath.</li>
<li>Cite more sources, especially for the climate section which is mostly facts and figures.</li>
<li>Review the linking - are all those minor tourist attractions ever actually going to have an article of their own?</li>
<li>With the list of places of interest consider either splitting or putting it into columns using tables to reduce whitespace.</li>
<li>The article is quite long. Consider making a Culture of Bath section and consolidating Culture, Media and Sport using <a href="../../../s/u/m/Wikipedia%7ESummary_style_1b75.html" title="Wikipedia:Summary style">Wikipedia:Summary style</a>.</li>
<li>Add a local map, originally requested at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Maps_Requested_and_orphan_maps_1ba9.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Maps/Requested and orphan maps">Requested_and_orphan_maps</a>.
<ul>
<li>There's a useful one at the bathblitz site <a href="../../../q/u/o/User%7EQuota_b8dd.html" title="User:Quota">quota</a> 19:38, 25 August 2006 (UTC)

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Give more information on the hot spring themself&#160;: how much water, how it evolved, composition, what it is good for, what it is supposed to be good for, where it comes from, age of the water (how long it was underearth)... --<a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAstirmays_b670.html" title="User:Astirmays">Astirmays</a>
<ul>

<p>which makes no sense to me. Surely the London-West railway was the Great Western Railway, not just a linking line between the GWR and the Midland, etc. In any case I think trying to deal with both canal and rail in one big sentence is asking too much.</p>
<p>I've also moved the ownership details of the S&amp;DJR to its page, where it belongs rather than cluttering up the Bath page.

<dd>Good edit. The Avon valley inland of Bath, btw., is something of a classic as it has all 4 transportation types in same narrow space (road, rail, canal, river). Often quoted in Geog. textbooks.

<p>If there was an article on the physical item then it should be under "Bath" (common usage), but the disambiguation page should not be here. As currently most of the suggested other pages are for places (most of which are not written), the first, the <a href="../../../c/i/t/City_of_Bath_2b92.html" title="City of Bath">City of Bath</a>, is the best fit.</p>

<p>I'm agnostic on whether a rename is appropriate. However if the article is renamed it should not be to <i>Bath, England</i> as that does not fit the disambiguation standard for English place names, which is <i>@place@, @ceremonial-county@</i>, ie. in this case <b>Bath, Somerset</b>. -- <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChris_j_wood_afc2.html" title="User:Chris j wood">Chris j wood</a> 13:52, 26 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Being a resident of Bath, I do not think this appropriate. Regardless of the fact that the votes, to-date, are against the move, I never hear the city's location expressed as "Bath, Somerset". It is always "Bath, Bath and North East Somerset" or "Bath, BANES". I realise there is distinction between the ceremonial and actual county but what is the point in moving to a never-used name? Further, I would say "Bath, England" is inappropriate - "Bath, United Kingdom" is more so. --<a href="../../../o/l/d/User%7EOldakQuill_3b15.html" title="User:OldakQuill">Oldak</a> <a href="../../../o/l/d/User_talk%7EOldakQuill_6507.html" title="User talk:OldakQuill">Quill</a> 19:25, 28 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As a fellow-resident of Bath I have to disagree. Bath &amp; North East Somerset (B&amp;NES/BANES) is the name of the local authority, not the county. <b>Bath, Somerset</b> is both correct and in fairly common use. (Admittedly, though, it fell into disuse during the brief tenure of the late and unlamented <a href="../../../c/o/u/County_of_Avon_97b4.html" title="County of Avon">County of Avon</a>.)[Roger Houghton]</dd>

<p>The article is so good that I won't do this edit myself: The early sentence "The city is founded on the only naturally-ocurring thermal spa in the United Kingdom" troubles me. Surely one or more of the many Roman baths in Wales, England, and elsewhere in the U.K. were "thermal" springs. They may well be unused since Roman times, but is the word "spa" (as opposed to "spring") the only thing that makes the quoted sentence "accurate"? <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStagehand_a5eb.html" title="User:Stagehand">Stagehand</a> 15:28, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>There are many uncited statistics in the <b>climate</b> section. 50% of days are overcast is debatable. Why are there figures for 2003; shouldn't they be for an average year? Plus these figures for 2003 are incorrect, the "extreme" of 14.2C is very odd. If it is refering to whole months, I'd imagine August 2003 to have an average of at least 19C.</p>
<p>The data for <b>demographics</b> is for the Bath and North east Somerset local authority. Bath only makes up about half of the population of this district, possibly slightly less. The paragraph starts by mentioning the surrounding areas, and then goes on to talk about only Bath, when it is still actually refering to the whole district.</p>
<p>The <b>tourism</b> section says "Bath is the most visited city outside of London for tourists travelling to the UK". Has anyone got a source for this? I thought it was Edinburgh but I may be mistaken.</p>

<p>I have already cleaned up this section (a while ago), but I think the list of "notable" secondary schools includes all but one of the city's schools. I thought that maybe the list should be made complete, given as a complete list (rather than a list of notable school) and maybe in bullet points rather than a messy paragraph?

<dd>I've tried to make the Education section more compact, with a right aligned table - but this doesn't work as well as I'd hoped, but is perhaps OK. If there are objections we can go back.

<p>As a Bath resident I am concerned about the prominence of Sally Lunn buns in Bath related articles generally. This seems more of an advert to me for the resturant rather than an accurate refection of its importance in Bath.--An unsigned contribution.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I have never been to Bath, but Sally Lunn does appear very prominently in the article. From that, one might think she was one of the most important people to ever live in Bath. This is not true? --<a href="../../../f/i/l/User%7EFilll_f8ad.html" title="User:Filll">Filll</a> 21:55, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sally Lunn's house is notable because it is the oldest building in Bath. The buns themselves are famous but not particulary notable. Also, they are disgusting. Not relevant, but my opinion. <a href="../../../a/b/b/User%7EAbbyemery_4417.html" title="User:Abbyemery">Abbyemery</a> 16:21, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I understand that it isn't Bath's oldest building, despite its tireless self-promotion as such - but I can't remember which building has the better claim. Can current Bath residents help? I left in 1999. <a href="../../../n/o/t/User%7ENotreallydavid_da70.html" title="User:Notreallydavid">Notreallydavid</a> 12:05, 3 December 2006 (UTC) (And the buns never did me any harm.)
<dl>
<dd>If you're talking about age of buildings and prominence then surely the Roman Baths should feature above Sally Lunn's anyway? Since its probably THE oldest 'building'. Also I am a current resident of Bath and, as a resident, I can't say I have ever really visited Sally Lunn's or ever wanted to. Its not really a tourist destination either, its in the back alleys, hard to find and in general the Roman Baths, Costume Shop and Abbey draw far superior crowds. --<a href="../../../b/o/t/User%7EBottlecapninja_5036.html" title="User:Bottlecapninja">Bottlecapninja</a> 23:37, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I investigated the Bath Hot Springs to substantiate the claim that they were the only hot springs in the UK. I was able to find that this is true, by some definitions, and compiled a list of 10+ definitions of hot springs with references. I also am not sure how many hot springs there are in Bath. Some of it depends on your definition of what a hot spring is, or a separate hot spring. Some of what are referred to as bath hot springs are in fact drilled wells. So to be honest I do not really know how many hot springs there are, naturally and otherwise, in Bath. I would steer clear of any claims of numbers (I was the one who made the list that apparently shows 5 in Bath. That was just a guess from the sources and I do not trust it that much). --<a href="../../../f/i/l/User%7EFilll_f8ad.html" title="User:Filll">Filll</a> 14:55, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>While there are other relatively small cities named Bath, this <b>Bath</b> is the only large, famous and particularly notable one, and, so, it makes sense to disambiguate it from all the other subjects that share the <b>Bath/bath</b> name with the standard Wikipedia disambiguation parenthetic remark, <b>(city)</b>. See <a href="../../../c/o/r/Cork_%28city%29.html" title="Cork (city)">Cork (city)</a>.</li>
<li><b>Bath</b> is not the <b>primary topic</b> for the name, per <a href="../../../d/a/b/WP%7EDAB_f303.html#Primary_topic" title="WP:DAB">WP:DAB#Primary topic</a>, which says:</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<dl>
<dd><i>When there is a well known <b>primary meaning</b> for a term or phrase, much more used than any other (...), then that topic may be used for the title of the main article, with a disambiguation link at the top.

</dl>
</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>No one can reasonably claim that the city <b>Bath</b> is used "much more" than the word <b>bath</b>, and, so, <i>the city</i> is not the <b>primary meaning</b> of the term, <b>bath</b>, and, therefore, it should not be the <b>primary topic</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Others have argued (in the 2005 survey for a similar move, above) that <b>bath</b> (the word, not place) is not encyclopedic, and, so, this city is clearly the most notable encyclopedic use of the name. However, with the fairly recent moves of <a href="../../../c/o/r/Cork.html" title="Cork">Cork</a> to <a href="../../../c/o/r/Cork_%28city%29.html" title="Cork (city)">Cork (city)</a> and even <a href="../../../m/i/s/Misery.html" title="Misery">Misery</a> to <a href="../../../m/i/s/Misery_%28novel%29.html" title="Misery (novel)">Misery (novel)</a>, the convention of treating "common words" (like bath and misery) as "unnotable" and "not encyclopedic" appears to be changing in this respect. Also note that the <a href="../../../h/a/i/Hair.html" title="Hair">Hair</a> article is about the stuff on your head, not the (arguably) more encyclopedic famous stage production and film (which are at <a href="../../../h/a/i/Hair_%28musical%29.html" title="Hair (musical)">Hair (musical)</a> and <a href="../../../h/a/i/Hair_%28film%29.html" title="Hair (film)">Hair (film)</a>).</li>
<li>Besides, it's not like <b>Bath</b> is a <a href="../../../g/l/o/Global_city.html" title="Global city">global city</a>. If it were, that might have made it notable enough to "trump" the other uses.</li>

<li><b>Weak oppose</b> Upon further consideration, I think that Bath is pretty clearly the most well-known of the places listed and merits primary topic status.

Seems that unlike in the United States and some other "new" countries, where a city is unambiguously subordinate to the next level of subnational entity, that relation isn't as clear-cut when the city has over a two thousand-year history while the surrounding county configuration has changed several times in the past century alone. <a href="../../../b/k/o/User%7EBkonrad_1453.html" title="User:Bkonrad">older</a> ≠ <a href="../../../b/k/o/User_talk%7EBkonrad_cb14.html" title="User talk:Bkonrad">wiser</a> 04:40, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>It's not arguing over semantics. Arguing over semantics would be arguing over whether <i>name</i> and <i>"location-qualified reference"</i> mean the same thing. The underlying issue here is: what is supposed to go into a title (regardless of what you call it), and whether <i>Cityname, Area-City-Is-In</i> qualifies as <i>that</i> (regardless of what you call it) for a city article. Another way to put it is: is adding comma-separated contextual information to the most common/simple name of an article subject in its title preferred to adding that or similar information in a parenthetic remark in the title? --<a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESerge_Issakov_7435.html" title="User:Serge Issakov">Serge</a> 20:46, 13 December 2006 (UTC)

<p>Are you suggesting that at the top of <a href="../../../b/a/t/Bath_%28city%29.html" title="Bath (city)">Bath (city)</a> there should be a dab header to a dab page for all the other cities named <b>Bath</b>, but not for all other non-city subjects named <b>bath</b>, because the <b>(city)</b> dab would already have "filtered" those out, in effect? Interesting. Yes, that's quite convincing. But to me, that's an argument for <b>Bath (city in England)</b>, <b>Bath (Somerset)</b>, <b>Bath (Somerset, England)</b> or <b>Bath (city in Somerset, England)</b>, not support for <b>Bath, Somerset</b> which I still think wrongly implies that <b>Bath, Somerset</b> is the most common name for that city, because, in that format, it is not clear that <b>, Somerset</b> is dab info. --<a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESerge_Issakov_7435.html" title="User:Serge Issakov">Serge</a> 20:58, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Serge, which of the reasons I offered for <a href="../../../b/a/t/Bath%2C_Somerset_c16f.html" title="Bath, Somerset">Bath, Somerset</a> do you dispute?
<ol>
<li>It <i>is</i> the convention for disambiguating ambiguous placenames in Somerset (see <a href="../../../t/o/w/Category%7ETowns_in_Somerset_e46f.html" title="Category:Towns in Somerset">Category:Towns in Somerset</a>)</li>
<li>It is <i>documented</i> as the convention for naming places in England (see <a href="../../../n/c/3A/WP%7ENC%7ECITY_dd78.html#United_Kingdom" title="WP:NC:CITY">WP:NC:CITY#United_Kingdom</a> )</li>
<li>There are many other places that <i>could</i> be described as <a href="../../../b/a/t/Bath_%28city%29.html" title="Bath (city)">Bath (city)</a> (see <a href="../../../b/a/t/Bath_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Bath (disambiguation)">Bath (disambiguation)</a> and <a href="../../../b/a/t/Bath%2C_Maine_ae66.html" title="Bath, Maine">Bath, Maine</a>)<a href="http://www.cityofbath.com/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cityofbath.com/" rel="nofollow">[5]</a></li>

<dd>I'm not disputing any of these facts, Scott. My argument is that the conventions reflected in the guidelines you cite should be changed for the reasons that I have provided.

<dd>Serge, it is disruptive and against <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> to be deliberately trying to get articles moved out of accordance with the accepted naming conventions just so that you can then wave those moved articles at <a href="../../../n/c/3A/WP%7ENC%7ECITY_dd78.html" title="WP:NC:CITY">WP:NC:CITY</a> as an example of why you want the documented convention changed.

<dd>Scott, since you are not addressing anything that Dave wrote, perhaps you did not understand his point? I don't know how to improve on it, so I can only repeat it:
<dl>
<dd><i>By disambiguating as <a href="../../../b/a/t/Bath_%28city%29.html" title="Bath (city)">Bath (city)</a>, the title reflects the fact that the need for disambiguation arises from the city sharing its name with another article(s) about subject(s) that are not cities. Simultaneously, <a href="../../../b/a/t/Bath_%28city%29.html" title="Bath (city)">Bath (city)</a> correctly implies that the city that the article is about is the most notable locale with that name.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>In other words, you seem to be arguing that, in general, <i>Name (city)</i> implies that <i>Name</i> is the <i>only</i> city with that name, while Dave is arguing that it implies that <i>Name</i> is the <i>only</i> city that is the <b>primary <i>city</i> topic</b> use of that name. Note that the article title <i>Name</i> (alone - no dabbing) does not necessarily imply that <i>Name</i> is the <i>only</i> use of that name, just that the given subject is the <i>primary topic</i> use of <i>Name</i>. Similarly, <i>Name (city)</i> implies that the given subject is the primary <i>city</i> topic use of that name. If it is "ambiguous disambiguation", then it is ambiguous only to the same degree that using <i>Name</i> is ambiguous as a primary topic when there are other uses; it's standard accepted usage in Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESerge_Issakov_7435.html" title="User:Serge Issakov">Serge</a> 16:57, 20 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I understood that, and believe that if it's worth the effort to fix about 1300 links to <a href="../../../b/a/t/Bath.html" title="Bath">Bath</a> so that it would be OK to move <a href="../../../b/a/t/Bath_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Bath (disambiguation)">Bath (disambiguation)</a> there, we might as well do it so that they won't need doing again when <a href="../../../b/a/t/Bath%2C_Maine_ae66.html" title="Bath, Maine">Bath, Maine</a> (or any other) has a growth spurt and becomes the best-known city by that name. I expect that <a href="../../../b/a/t/Bath_%28city%29.html" title="Bath (city)">Bath (city)</a> means the one in Maine for most people who live in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_England_30a7.html" title="New England">New England</a> or the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Maritimes.html" title="Maritimes">Maritimes</a>, perhaps to distinguish it from the <i>villages</i> of <a href="../../../b/a/t/Bath%2C_New_Brunswick_11b1.html" title="Bath, New Brunswick">Bath, New Brunswick</a> and <a href="../../../b/a/t/Bath%2C_New_Hampshire_3e04.html" title="Bath, New Hampshire">Bath, New Hampshire</a>. --<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottDavis_99e4.html" title="User:ScottDavis">Scott Davis</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/c/o/User_talk%7EScottDavis_9428.html" title="User talk:ScottDavis">Talk</a></sup> 01:56, 21 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Again, however bad the situation may be for this article to be at <a href="../../../b/a/t/Bath_%28city%29.html" title="Bath (city)">Bath (city)</a> with respect to future potential issues with other cities named Bath getting more prominent, it can be no worse than for it to stay at <a href="../../../b/a/t/Bath.html" title="Bath">Bath</a> (assuming the only conflicts were with cities). And, if there were no non-city conflicts, then this article would unquestionably stay at <a href="../../../b/a/t/Bath.html" title="Bath">Bath</a>, would it not? So how bad can this be? Not bad at all, I say. Practically speaking, the odds of some other city named Bath becoming sufficiently prominent to warrant another change is extremely unlikely in our lifetimes. If this is the crux of the argument against using <a href="../../../b/a/t/Bath_%28city%29.html" title="Bath (city)">Bath (city)</a>, it's pretty anemic. Our great grandchildren can fix <a href="../../../b/a/t/Bath_%28city%29.html" title="Bath (city)">Bath (city)</a>, should it ever need fixing... Speaking of odds, by that measure, <a href="../../../b/a/t/Bath%2C_Somerset_c16f.html" title="Bath, Somerset">Bath, Somerset</a> is much more likely to need a change, given the way counties seem to come and go in that part of the world...

<dd>The <a href="../../../c/e/r/Ceremonial_counties_of_England_16dc.html" title="Ceremonial counties of England">ceremonial counties of England</a> appear to be stable, despite relatively recent shuffling of the administrative counties.

<p>I must say that I think this decision to move to <a href="../../../b/a/t/Bath%2C_Somerset_c16f.html" title="Bath, Somerset">Bath, Somerset</a> was premature, and without a majority or final discussion; my count is that only 9 of the 20 votes favoured <a href="../../../b/a/t/Bath%2C_Somerset_c16f.html" title="Bath, Somerset">Bath, Somerset</a>. This proposal was for <a href="../../../b/a/t/Bath_%28city%29.html" title="Bath (city)">Bath (city)</a>, surely proper procedure would have been to call another vote for <a href="../../../b/a/t/Bath%2C_Somerset_c16f.html" title="Bath, Somerset">Bath, Somerset</a> - after all the discussion such a second voting round would have been better informed.

<dd>Acknowledged. However, it really depends how you look at it: as I explained in the closing note, there's a consensus for move, but there isn't really a consensus where.

<dd>A support vote for the move that expresses mere <i>preference</i> for an alternate name, but not opposition to the proposed name, should count as support for the proposed name. Counting in this manner I get out of the 20 votes:
<ul>
<li>Support RM of Bath -&gt; Bath (city): 13 (votes 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,10,11,12,13,15)</li>
<li>Prefer Bath, Somerset: 9 (votes 5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,14)</li>
<li>Support only Bath, Somerset and oppose Bath (city): 2 (votes 9, 14)</li>

<li>oppose move: 5</li>

<dd>Really innovative way of counting Serge. How come you count votes 5-12 (and possibly few more) into "support for Bath (city)" when they clearly indicated the preference for Bath, Somerset (along with oppose #2, let alone Bkonrad's scratched vote)? I'm not particularly happy with the outcome either, but reading the votes and the discussion, it was clear that the naming convention and general feeling <i>leans</i> toward "Bath, Somerset" far more than towards "Bath (city)". I dare not call it a "consensus" either, but it seemed to be the <i>least unnaceptable</i> choice. <a href="../../../d/u/j/User%7EDuja_17a6.html" title="User:Duja">Duja</a><span style="font-size:70%;"><a href="../../../d/u/j/User_talk%7EDuja_3032.html" title="User talk:Duja">►</a></span> 16:20, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

My vote (number 11) was for <a href="../../../b/a/t/Bath%2C_Somerset_c16f.html" title="Bath, Somerset">Bath, Somerset</a>. It was placed in the 'Support' section as others had already effectively used that section to urge a move to somewhere other than that suggested in the specific proposal. If you think it would be useful, we could call another vote and ask users explictly to vote between the two options, but <a href="../../../s/n/o/WP%7ESNOW_7008.html" title="WP:SNOW">WP:SNOW</a> seems to apply. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichaelMaggs_3ae0.html" title="User:MichaelMaggs">MichaelMaggs</a> 16:30, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Michael, I counted your vote as one of 9 out of 20 that preferred <a href="../../../b/a/t/Bath%2C_Somerset_c16f.html" title="Bath, Somerset">Bath, Somerset</a> to <a href="../../../b/a/t/Bath_%28city%29.html" title="Bath (city)">Bath (city)</a>, but isn't it fair to also count it as one of 13 out of 20 that supported the move of Bath to Bath (city)? After all, you voted Support in the survey for that specific move, didn't you? And, unlike two others who did make a qualification of actually opposing Bath (city), you did not say you would only support the move if it was to Bath, Somerset. How is this "entirely unfair"? --<a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESerge_Issakov_7435.html" title="User:Serge Issakov">Serge</a> 17:36, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Duja, there is nothing innovative about it. I think it's common sense. I counted "votes 5-12 (and possibly few more)" into "support for Bath (city)" because they were votes that indicated <b>Support</b> for the RM of Bath -&gt; Bath (city). The fact that in their comments they also mentioned a <i>preference</i> for an alternate name is immaterial to that fact. Suppose each one expressed a preference for a unique name - would you count those as one vote for each unique alternative name and not as a vote in support of the move to the proposed name? That would be clearly absurd. In this case it's a bit confusing because they all happened to choose the same alternate, but the fundamental vote in support of the original RM should remain. There were only two "support" votes that expressed actual opposition to Bath (city). All the others should count as support votes for the move to Bath (city), <i>because that's what this survey was about</i>, and they voted <b>Support</b>. If they didn't support Bath (city), they would have voted oppose, or indicated their opposition in their comment, as (only) two of them did.</dd>
<dd>Another way to look at it: for 11 out of 20, there is no evidence of any support for <b>Bath, Somerset</b>. For only 7 out of 20 there is no evidence of any support <b>Bath (city)</b>. I understand that <b>Bath, Somerset</b> <i>seemed</i> to be the <i>least unacceptable</i> choice, but to reach this conclusion you miscounted mere preferences for Bath, Somerset as votes of Bath (city) being unacceptable. I don't understand why. Logically, with 13 out of 20 expressing at least some support for Bath (city), and only 9 out of 20 expressing some support for Bath, Somerset, Bath (city) is clearly the <i>least unacceptable choice</i>, if not clearly the most favored choice. As the nominator, I'm biased of course, but I submit this logic should withstand any objective scrutiny.

<dd>My take on this is that the voting got so messy we should conclude no more than there was a majority for a move and no support for <a href="../../../b/a/t/Bath%2C_England_14d9.html" title="Bath, England">Bath, England</a>, and it would have been best to have had a second vote of some form after the Xmas break - maybe simple <a href="../../../b/a/t/Bath_%28city%29.html" title="Bath (city)">Bath (city)</a> v. <a href="../../../b/a/t/Bath%2C_Somerset_c16f.html" title="Bath, Somerset">Bath, Somerset</a> so those that opposed could give preference. I suspect <a href="../../../b/a/t/Bath%2C_Somerset_c16f.html" title="Bath, Somerset">Bath, Somerset</a> would have won, so I'm content to accept what has been done; but if someone feels very strongly they should organise another vote. <a href="../../../r/w/e/User%7ERwendland_44de.html" title="User:Rwendland">Rwendland</a> 18:25, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It is common practice in such RM surveys for participants to mention a preference of an alternative name when voting in support of a given move. This practice does not constitute making anything "messy". I strongly object to any crystal ball conjectures about "beliefs" that such-and-such "would have won" had this-or-that had happened, and the move made based upon such unsubstantiated claims. Now, I do believe that the initial move was made in good faith. But now that the counting error has been revealed, it should be done the other way. --<a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESerge_Issakov_7435.html" title="User:Serge Issakov">Serge</a> 18:47, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This survey was about a specific move of Bath to Bath (city). 13 out of 20 (a clear majority), including you, voted in <b>Support</b> of that specific move. That's what was counted. The fact that 9 (a minority) of you also preferred <b>Bath, Somerset</b> to Bath (city) is a separate matter. Trying to compare and weigh these votes with respect to each other on these distinct matters is what would be entirely unfair, for there would no objective or even reasonably subjective way to do it. I admire Duja's effort, but I think he missed the fundamental majority support (however reluctant it may be) for the move to Bath (city). A reluctant majority should still trump the strong minority, no? --<a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESerge_Issakov_7435.html" title="User:Serge Issakov">Serge</a> 19:28, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Scott, I suggest that when you vote in a survey in support of a proposed move from A to B, you should not be surprised to find your vote counted as one in support of, well, a move from A to B. We can't read your mind. How is one to know that "ambivalent at best" means <i>opposed</i>? If you did not support the proposed move to Bath (city), then you should not have voted in support of it, or at least make it clear in your comment that you were opposed to it. Even if we don't count your vote, that's still 12 vs. the minority of 9 that expressed a preference for Somerset.</dd>
<dd>Anyway, it doesn't matter much to me whether it's at (city) or Somerset; the main thing is that it not be at Bath. I just think having a minority preference trump a choice supported by a majority sets a bad precedent. What goes around comes around, especially in Wikipedia.

<dd>I think the issue is subtly different here, and it may be that neither Americans nor Australians will properly understand it. It appears that Bath <i>used to be</i> in Somerset, but may no longer be, although there are many references that appear to suggest that it is. We need to wait until the English people can confirm whether the name <a href="../../../b/a/t/Bath%2C_Somerset_c16f.html" title="Bath, Somerset">Bath, Somerset</a> would be <i>incorrect</i> as it turned out that <a href="../../../c/o/r/Cork%2C_County_Cork_84a4.html" title="Cork, County Cork">Cork, County Cork</a> would have been.

<dd>Well, it's pretty complicated. Bath used to be in the old county of <a href="../../../s/o/m/Somerset.html" title="Somerset">Somerset</a>, but in 1972 it was moved into a new county called <a href="../../../a/v/o/Avon_%28county%29.html" title="Avon (county)">Avon</a>. That was not a success, and in 1996 the county of Avon was abolished. Now, Bath is back in Somerset again, and mail is, for example, often addressed to "Bath, Somerset". Unfortunately, the county of Somerset is not the same as the local government body which controls Bath: the <a href="../../../l/o/c/Local_authority.html" title="Local authority">local authority</a> as it's known here is a different entity called <a href="../../../b/a/t/Bath_and_North_East_Somerset_4081.html" title="Bath and North East Somerset">Bath and North East Somerset</a>. As the name suggests, this authority covers only part of the old county of Somerset. But in practical terms a resident would never say "I live in Bath, Bath and North East Somerset", but might say "I live in Bath, Somerset". More likely, however, he or she would simply say "I live in Bath", as that's all that most people would need. So "Bath, Somerset" is at worst redundant, but is not wrong.--<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichaelMaggs_3ae0.html" title="User:MichaelMaggs">MichaelMaggs</a> 19:23, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Bath is not in the <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shire_county.html" title="Shire county">Shire county</a> (non-metropolitan county) of Somerset (i.e. for the purposes of local government), but is in the <a href="../../../c/e/r/Ceremonial_county.html" title="Ceremonial county">Ceremonial county</a> of Somerset (though for Bath with a <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lord_Mayor_8b1b.html" title="Lord Mayor">Lord Mayor</a> this is of little importance). So <a href="../../../b/a/t/Bath%2C_Somerset_c16f.html" title="Bath, Somerset">Bath, Somerset</a> would not actually be wrong, but I am asserting it is not something locals (or many others) would much use.

Sorry this is so confusing, but reflects the fact that the <a href="../../../a/d/m/Administrative_divisions_of_England_6ce3.html" title="Administrative divisions of England">Administrative divisions of England</a> are not uniform, and for Bath has been changed twice since 1972. AFAICT few Bath residents have a sense of belonging to <a href="../../../s/o/m/Somerset.html" title="Somerset">Somerset</a>, and even before 1972 Bath was a <a href="../../../c/o/u/County_borough.html" title="County borough">County borough</a> since 1889 independent of Somerset county council control, rather than the county-town. <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28places%29_59d5.html#Counties_of_Britain" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (places)">Wikipedia:Naming conventions (places)#Counties of Britain</a> isn't at all clear on the naming of places within a larger unitary authority, as opposed to town/city which composes the whole of a unitary authority: 'We should use the current, administrative, county ... We should mention historic (traditional) counties in articles about places ... but only as an afternote. If a place is a unitary authority and not administered by a county council, it is acceptable to use ceremonial counties as geographic references, as this is often more in line with common usage ... it is not useful to state that "Luton is a town in the county of Luton".' Really this is all rather a mess, and hard to see a good way forward - hence my preference with sticking to the current situation if at all possible. <a href="../../../r/w/e/User%7ERwendland_44de.html" title="User:Rwendland">Rwendland</a> 01:12, 17 December 2006 (UTC)

Saying Bath is "in Somerset" is in line with the part of the guidelines that say <i>If a place is a unitary authority and not administered by a county council, it is acceptable to use ceremonial counties as geographic references, as this is often more in line with common usage ...</i> which I recall is a broad compromise on the administrative vs ceremonial issue and accepting that some unitary authority names are either not useful for disambiguation or too unwieldy. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimrollpickering_f409.html" title="User:Timrollpickering">Timrollpickering</a> 23:33, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Bath Spa refers to the spa itself (the hot baths) and more recently is used in conjunction with the railway station, a University and various sporting clubs.

<ul>
<li><b>Support, sort of</b>: Of these two options, <a href="../../../b/a/t/Bath_%28city%29.html" title="Bath (city)">Bath (city)</a> is the best, because of the vagueness involved in whether Bath really is in Somerset or not, and because it's the <a href="../../../d/i/s/Wikipedia%7EDisambiguation_78fc.html#primary_topic" title="Wikipedia:Disambiguation">primary topic</a> for cities named Bath. Note that the apparent consensus above was that the city was not the primary topic for <a href="../../../b/a/t/Bath.html" title="Bath">Bath</a>, but it is surely the primary <i>city</i> named Bath. That said, I'm increasingly of the opinion that having the city at <a href="../../../b/a/t/Bath.html" title="Bath">Bath</a> was a better solution than either <a href="../../../b/a/t/Bath_%28city%29.html" title="Bath (city)">Bath (city)</a> or <a href="../../../b/a/t/Bath%2C_Somerset_c16f.html" title="Bath, Somerset">Bath, Somerset</a> — the other primary meanings are covered at the distinct words <a href="../../../b/a/t/Bathtub.html" title="Bathtub">bathtub</a> and <a href="../../../b/a/t/Bathing.html" title="Bathing">bathing</a>. —<a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJosiah_Rowe_4f72.html" title="User:Josiah Rowe">Josiah Rowe</a> <small>(<a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJosiah_Rowe_ba00.html" title="User talk:Josiah Rowe">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Josiah_Rowe_5f31.html" title="Special:Contributions/Josiah Rowe">contribs</a>)</small> 11:36, 27 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Josiah, I'm surprised to see you repeat this argument. Apparently I wasn't too convincing in the Lost debate, but I'll reiterate for those here: the primary topic provision only applies to the "main article" -- without disambiguation -- and does not apply to articles which already require disambiguation. The purpose of primary topics is to assist users when they search for an ambiguous term. Since no one is actually going to search for "Bath (city)", we're not helping anyone by using an ambiguous title. <span style="color: #F06A0F">–</span><small><span style="border: 1px solid #F06A0F"><a href="../../../a/n/%C3%BE/User%7EAn%C3%BEony_a6df.html" title="User:Anþony"><b><span style="background-color:White; color:#F06A0F">&#160;Anþony&#160;</span></b></a><a href="../../../a/n/%C3%BE/User_talk%7EAn%C3%BEony_4ae4.html" title="User talk:Anþony"><span style="background-color:#F06A0F; color:white">&#160;talk&#160;</span></a></span></small> 12:10, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Oppose.</b> I'm afraid to say that Serge arrives at his interesting conclusion only by creatively counting the votes in the Requested Move, above. (Note that he counts all users who said they <i>prefer</i> "Bath, Somerset" as voting <i>equally</i> for that and for "Bath (city)"). The closure was prefectly sound, and correctly implements the majority view. I regret that Serge so dislikes the result of his own poll that he feels the need to run it all over again only a few days later. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichaelMaggs_3ae0.html" title="User:MichaelMaggs">MichaelMaggs</a> 22:44, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Oppose</b> - as an Oppose voter above, my first choice, and what I argued for, was <a href="../../../b/a/t/Bath.html" title="Bath">Bath</a>, as against <a href="../../../b/a/t/Bath%2C_Somerset_c16f.html" title="Bath, Somerset">Bath, Somerset</a>. But I find <a href="../../../b/a/t/Bath%2C_Somerset_c16f.html" title="Bath, Somerset">Bath, Somerset</a> - which, at worst, is a trifle dated, but has unquestionably been usage - far preferable to <a href="../../../b/a/t/Bath_%28city%29.html" title="Bath (city)">Bath (city)</a>. If <a href="../../../b/a/t/Bath.html" title="Bath">Bath</a> is ambiguous, the page name should at least indicate <i>which</i> Bath we mean.

<dd>Look at the top of this page. There was a consensus not to move the page from 'Bath' back then. A sizable minority wanted to retain it at Bath in the recent vote. It is just plain stupid to have the page at Bath, Somerset when it's not even in bloody Somerset . The vote was completely flawed nand the arguments against the current name werenot properly put forward. Having the page at 'Bath, Somerset' is like having a page titled Washington D.C. , Maryland (364,000 Google hits for "Wasginton D.C, Maryland") <a href="../../../j/o/o/User%7EJooler_fb16.html" title="User:Jooler">Jooler</a> 04:36, 27 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>If "Bath is not in Somerset", there are a <i>lot</i> of Wikipedia articles that need to be corrected - perhaps a quarter of the ones I changed to [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] were immediately followed by ", <a href="../../../s/o/m/Somerset.html" title="Somerset">Somerset</a>". Then theres the categories and lists too.</li>
<li>About 2% of the links to <a href="../../../b/a/t/Bath.html" title="Bath">Bath</a> did not mean the city. Generally either <a href="../../../b/a/t/Bathing.html" title="Bathing">bathing</a>, one of the variants on that, or <a href="../../../b/a/t/Bath_Abbey_a4d0.html" title="Bath Abbey">Bath Abbey</a>.</li>
<li>(new thought)If there is an article about the cricket ground in Bath, it should be added to <a href="../../../b/a/t/Bath_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Bath (disambiguation)">Bath (disambiguation)</a> and have someone search for Bath and cricket to fix a lot of articles about cricketers who have played there. Maybe as much as 8-10% of the links (I didn't try to count those, as I took a while to realise it might be significant).</li>
<li>I don't think the city is ever referred to as "Bath Spa". I have found only the two links referred to somewhere about about the football clubs using that name.</li>

<dd>The current status is that there are still just over 200 links from articles to <a href="../../../b/a/t/Bath.html" title="Bath">Bath</a>, plus links from user, talk etc pages that are presumed to refer to the English city. These need to all be changed to link directly to <a href="../../../b/a/t/Bath%2C_Somerset_c16f.html" title="Bath, Somerset">Bath, Somerset</a> (or fixed to link elsewhere), then the current <a href="../../../b/a/t/Bath_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Bath (disambiguation)">Bath (disambiguation)</a> can be moved to <a href="../../../b/a/t/Bath.html" title="Bath">Bath</a> as per the RM in December. The consensus appears to be that Bath <i>is in</i> the <i>ceremonial</i> county of Somerset, regardless of any administrative tomfoolery. This is consistent with several hundred Wikipedia articles (text or semantics, not just that the link points to <a href="../../../b/a/t/Bath%2C_Somerset_c16f.html" title="Bath, Somerset">Bath, Somerset</a>) as well as the other web pages many people have cited or counted above. --<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottDavis_99e4.html" title="User:ScottDavis">Scott Davis</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/c/o/User_talk%7EScottDavis_9428.html" title="User talk:ScottDavis">Talk</a></sup> 05:32, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Update: I think just about all articles, categories, templates and user pages have been dabbed appropriately (by other people as well as me).
