Theodosius, the winner of the battle, became the last emperor of a unified Roman Empire.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The mainly Pagan <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Senate_0c85.html" title="Roman Senate">Roman Senate</a> had been arguing with the Christian emperors in <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constantinople.html" title="Constantinople">Constantinople</a> and <a href="../../../m/i/l/Milan.html" title="Milan">Milan</a> for over two generations, since <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constantine_I_%28emperor%29_5860.html" title="Constantine I (emperor)">Constantine I</a> had recognized Christian faith and Theodosius had made it the official religion of the State. The senators wrote letters and argued for a return to Paganism, often stressing the protection and good fortune the old <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_religion.html" title="Roman religion">Roman gods</a> had bestowed Rome since her beginnings as a small city-state. For their part, the Christian emperors emphasized the primacy of Christianity, although not all did so to the same extent. This clash between the Roman world's two main religions was for the most part merely an academic debate, without threats of armed uprisings.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_15.html" title="May 15">May 15</a>, <a href="../../../3/9/2/392.html" title="392">392</a>, however, the Western Emperor <a href="../../../v/a/l/Valentinian_II_cfef.html" title="Valentinian II">Valentinian II</a> was found hanged at his residence in <a href="../../../v/i/e/Vienne.html" title="Vienne">Vienne</a>, <a href="../../../g/a/u/Gaul.html" title="Gaul">Gaul</a>. Valentinian, who for a time showed some favoritism towards the <a href="../../../a/r/i/Arianism.html" title="Arianism">Arians</a>, had continued the imperial policy of suppressing Pagan interests over those of the Christians. Not surprisingly, this policy had resulted in increasing tensions between the emperor and the Pagan senators.</p>
<p>When the Eastern Emperor Theodosius heard the news of Valentinian's death, Arbogast, who was the <i>magister militum</i> and <i>de facto</i> ruler of Western Empire, informed him that the young emperor had committed suicide.</p>
<p>Tensions between the two halves of the empire were heightened further that summer. Arbogast made several attempts to contact Theodosius, but apparently none got further than the ears of the Eastern praetorian prefect Rufinus. The responses that Arbogast received from Rufinus were unhelpful. Theodosius himself was slowly coming around to the belief Valentinian had been murdered, in no small part because his wife <a href="../../../g/a/l/Galla_%28wife_of_Theodosius%29_b3bd.html" title="Galla (wife of Theodosius)">Galla</a> was convinced her brother's death was caused by treachery.</p>
<p>For his part, Arbogast had few friends in the Eastern court. His chief ally was his uncle <a href="../../../r/i/c/Ricomer.html" title="Ricomer">Ricomer</a>, but he was suffering from a mortal illness. As it appeared increasingly likely that whatever course Theodosius decided upon would be hostile towards Arbogast, the Frank decided to make the first move.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_22.html" title="August 22">August 22</a> of that year, Arbogast elevated <a href="../../../e/u/g/Eugenius.html" title="Eugenius">Flavius Eugenius</a>, the Western imperial court's <i>magister scrinii</i>, to the purple. Eugenius was a well-respected scholar of rhetorics, and a better claimant to the purple than Arbogast himself. His ascension was backed by the <a href="../../../p/r/a/Praetorian_prefect.html" title="Praetorian prefect">Praetorian prefect</a> of Italy, Nicomachus Flavianus the Elder, and also by many of the Pagan members of the Roman Senate. However, some senators, notably Symmachus, were uneasy with this action.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>After his elevation to emperor, Eugenius appointed several important Pagan senators to key positions in the Western government. He also supported a movement to advance the Pagan cause by granting it official recognition and by restoring important Pagan shrines such as the <a href="../../../a/l/t/Altar_of_Victory_73be.html" title="Altar of Victory">Altar of Victory</a> and the <a href="../../../t/e/m/Temple_of_Venus_and_Rome_0c2f.html" title="Temple of Venus and Rome">temple of Venus and Rome</a>. These actions earned Eugenius withering criticism from <a href="../../../a/m/b/Ambrose.html" title="Ambrose">Ambrose</a> and did little to endear him to Theodosius.</p>
<p>As a Christian, Theodosius was distressed by the Pagan revival that was occurring under Eugenius's reign. In addition there was the issue of Valentinian's death, which had never been resolved to his satisfaction. Furthermore, Eugenius had removed all the high civil officers left by Theodosius when he had given the Western half of the empire to Valentinian, so that Theodosius had lost his control on the Western Roman Empire.</p>
<p>When a party of Western ambassadors arrived in Constantinople to request that Eugenius be acknowledged as the Western <i><a href="../../../a/u/g/Augustus_%28honorific%29.html" title="Augustus (honorific)">Augustus</a></i>, Theodosius was noncommittal, even if he received them with presents and vague promises. Whether he had already decided on an offensive against Eugenius and Arbogast at this point is unclear. In the end, however, after declaring his two-years-old son <a href="../../../h/o/n/Honorius_%28emperor%29.html" title="Honorius (emperor)">Honorius</a> as the western <i>Augustus</i> in January of <a href="../../../3/9/3/393.html" title="393">393</a>, Theodosius finally resolved to invade the West.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_the_Frigidus_bed1.html" title="Edit section: Theodosius prepares">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Theodosius prepares</span></h2>
<p>Over the following year and a half Theodosius marshalled his forces together for the invasion.</p>
<p>The Eastern armies had atrophied since the death of the emperor <a href="../../../v/a/l/Valens.html" title="Valens">Valens</a> and most of his men at <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Adrianople_7d1d.html" title="Battle of Adrianople">Adrianople</a> and it fell to the generals <a href="../../../s/t/i/Stilicho.html" title="Stilicho">Flavius Stilicho</a> and Timasius both to restore discipline to the Eastern <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_legion.html" title="Roman legion">legions</a> and to bring them back up to strength through recruitment and conscription.</p>
<p>At the same time another of Theodosius's advisers, the eunuch <a href="../../../e/u/t/Eutropius_%28Byzantine_official%29_373c.html" title="Eutropius (Byzantine official)">Eutropius</a>, was sent out from Constantinople to seek the advice and wisdom of an aged Christian monk in the Egyptian town of <a href="../../../l/y/c/Lycopolis.html" title="Lycopolis">Lycopolis</a>. According to the accounts of the meeting given by <a href="../../../c/l/a/Claudian.html" title="Claudian">Claudian</a> and <a href="../../../s/o/z/Sozomen.html" title="Sozomen">Sozomen</a>, the old monk prophesied that Theodosius would achieve a costly but decisive victory over Eugenius and Arbogast.</p>
<p>The Eastern army set out towards the west from Constantinople in May of <a href="../../../3/9/4/394.html" title="394">394</a>. The regalvanized legions were bolstered by numerous barbarian auxiliaries including over 20,000 <a href="../../../v/i/s/Visigoth.html" title="Visigoth">Visigoth</a> federates and additional forces from Spain and Syria. Theodosius himself led the army, and among his commanders were his own generals Stilicho and Timasius, the Visigoth chieftain <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alaric_I_48f4.html" title="Alaric I">Alaric</a>, and an <a href="../../../c/a/u/Caucasian_Iberia_2adb.html" title="Caucasian Iberia">Iberian</a> named <a href="../../../b/a/c/Bacurios_Hiberios_8726.html" title="Bacurios Hiberios">Bacurius</a>.</p>
<p>Their advance through Pannonia of the Julian Alps was unopposed, and Theodosius and his officers must have had suspicions about what lay ahead when they discovered that the eastern ends of the mountain passes were undefended. Arbogast had, based on his experiences fighting against the usurper <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magnus_Maximus_8d7e.html" title="Magnus Maximus">Magnus Maximus</a> in Gaul, decided that the best strategy was to keep his forces united to defend Italy itself, and to that end he went so far as to leave the Alpine passes unguarded. Arbogast's forces consisted mainly of his fellow Franks and <a href="../../../g/a/l/Gallo-Roman_6694.html" title="Gallo-Roman">Gallo-Romans</a>, plus his own Gothic auxiliaries.</p>
<p>Thanks to Arbogast's strategy of maintaining a single, relatively cohesive force, the Theodosian army passed unhindered through the Alps and descended towards the valley of the Frigidus River above <a href="../../../a/q/u/Aquileia.html" title="Aquileia">Aquileia</a>. It was in this narrow, mountainous region that they came upon the Western army's encampment in a pass near present-day <a href="../../../v/i/p/Vipava%2C_Slovenia_6e2f.html" title="Vipava, Slovenia">Vipava, Slovenia</a>, in the first days of September.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_the_Frigidus_bed1.html" title="Edit section: The battle">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The battle</span></h2>
<p>Theodosius attacked almost immediately, having undertaken little to no prior reconnaissance of the field of battle. He committed his Gothic allies into action first, perhaps hoping to thin their ranks through attrition and lessen their potential threat to the Empire. The Eastern army's headlong attack resulted in heavy casualties but little gain, and the Spanish general Bacurius was among the dead.</p>
<p>Day's end saw Eugenius celebrating his troops' successful defense of their position while Arbogast sent out detachments to close off the mountain passes behind Theodosius's forces.</p>
<p>After a sleepless night, Theodosius was cheered by the news that the men Arbogast had sent to bottle him up in the valley intended to desert to his side. Buoyed by this favorable development, Theodosius's men attacked once again. This time nature was on their side as a <a href="../../../b/o/r/Bora_%28wind%29.html" title="Bora (wind)">fierce tempest</a> — apparently a regular occurrence in the region — blew along the valley from the east. The high winds blew clouds of dust into the faces of the Western troops (legend also says, that the fierce winds even blew the Western troops' own arrows back at them). Buffeted by the winds, Arbogast's lines broke and Theodosius gained the decisive victory that the Egyptian monk had prophesied.</p>
<p>In the aftermath, Eugenius was captured and brought before the emperor. His pleas for mercy went unanswered and he was beheaded. Arbogast escaped the defeat and fled into the mountains, but after a few days' wandering, he concluded escape was impossible and committed suicide.</p>

<p>It had been a costly but total victory for Theodosius, and a total loss for the Pagans. The western provinces quickly submitted to Theodosius, who became the last emperor of a united empire.</p>
<p>Most significantly, the battle was the last attempt to contest the Christianization of the empire, its outcome decided the fate of Christianity in the western Empire. The battle is on par with that of the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_the_Milvian_Bridge_ea43.html" title="Battle of the Milvian Bridge">Battle of the Milvian Bridge</a> in importance, for it was seen not only as a victory in a civil war, but a vindication of the Christian God and the triumph of Christianity - within a generation the elite Pagan families of Rome would give up any serious resistance to Christianity and re-invent themselves as the <a href="../../../p/a/p/Papal.html" title="Papal">papal</a> families of <a href="../../../l/a/t/Late_Antiquity_2491.html" title="Late Antiquity">Late Antiquity</a>.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Unfortunately, the battle also accelerated the collapse of the Roman army in the west. The legions were already losing their effectiveness due to reorganizations and a decline in the quality of their training and discipline, and the losses at the Battle of the Frigidus weakened the western legions — whose task in defending the empire from the barbarian invaders was much harder than the eastern ones — still further. This downturn in the capabilities of the Roman soldiers meant an increasing reliance by the Western Empire on barbarian mercenaries employed as <i>federates</i>, who often proved to be unreliable, or worse.</p>
