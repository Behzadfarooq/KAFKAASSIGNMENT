<p>Admiral Yi never destroyed 333 ships with 13 at Myeongnyang. He sunk 30 ships and damaged many others in that battle.

<p>I'm pretty sure that somebody is playing pranks on English articles about Korea by purposely putting grammar and spelling mistakes on them. There are so many mistakes that so obvious. I hope that all of you other Wikipedians take close look at Korean articles for any improper changes in such manner.</p>
<p>Take a look at this sentence:</p>
<p>"Shimazu and Konishi ordered the Japanese troops scaled Chinese ships."</p>

<dd>Commander Ii Sun Shin was not shot in the heart- he was shot under left armpit, and I believe he died of blood loss.

<p>This contribution has much wrong description. Especially the Konishi army has not participated in this battle. Furthermore, the result of this battle is based only on Korean record, and is exaggerated. Although it is known that South Koreans are not studying the world history in school, isn't even the objective history of its own country studied? It is a self-satisfied illusion to compare this battle to the Battle of Trafalgar. <a href="../../../b/y/o/User%7EByouyou_d33f.html" title="User:Byouyou">Byouyou</a> 19:04, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>&gt;Vice-Admiral Horatio Nelson and Koreans in Wikipedia</p>
<p>&gt;It seems that Koreans are appearing in the most unlikely places trying to insert Korean nationalist issues into Wikipedia with Vice-Admiral Horatio Nelson being compared unfavorably to the little known Korean naval hero, Yi Sun Shin.</p>

<dd>How you feel does not matter to Wikipedia. "Little known Korean naval hero"? Don't downgrade Admiral Yi, he is a venerated man and many people study him, not only Koreans but others as well.</dd>

<dd>First of all, you need to change your attitude toward Korea. Please stop your usage of the word "Koreans" because that is pointing out a specific race and it is not how we use the word "Korea".

<p>E Sun shin was the greatest Admiral of all time.</p>

<p>Take a look at the chart at the bottom. The record speaks for itself.</p>
<p>"Admiral Yi’s expertise on naval strategy is apparent in the fact that his successor Won Gyun, even with all of Admiral Yi’s ships and trained crew, could not defeat an enemy fleet of similar might."</p>
<p>The E Sun shin article on Wikipedia says it perfectly. Almost the entire Korean Navy was destroyed under Won Kyun's command yet E Sun shin defeated the japs with the twelve ships that escaped plus his flagship.</p>

<p>"Because these records were written by a man of strict integrity, who lived in a society where the progression of the war was reported meticulously to the king by his overseers, they provide trustworthy accounts of the events of the battles and are free from the exaggerations and inaccuracies so typical of historical records of wars."</p>
<p>Of course Admiral E never recorded the result of Noryang Point as he was killed but the other records are trustworthy. <a href="../../../t/a/e/User%7ETaeguk_Warrior_3b31.html" title="User:Taeguk Warrior">Taeguk Warrior</a> 02:09, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

This is just my opinion, but Noryang Point seems to be more connected to Trafalgar than Tsushima is as Trafalgar and the Straits share one thing in common: a decisive naval battle that changed the balance of power for years to come. Noryang Point Was also a decisive naval battle that Japan would not recover from for centuaries, and in Trafalgar and Noryang, commanders of the victorious sides (Korea and England) lost their commanders, who were considered to be the best their respective nations could field. Togo, the 'Japanese Nelson', did survive Tsushima. If you are going to compare Tsushima and Trafalgar, than I believe that it is justified to include Noryang in it too. ELV</dd>
</dl>
<p>My two sense is that Noryang is not like Trafalgar in a tactical or strategic sense. It is like Trafalgar in a sense that a national hero died in his last battle in the last victory. Field Marshall Monty Montgomery himself said that Admiral Yi died like Admiral Nelson. <a href="../../../w/a/n/User%7EWangKon936_304e.html" title="User:WangKon936">WangKon936</a> 05:58, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Someone just changed the result of Noryang Battle as "stratgic victory of Japan".</p>
<p>Noryang Point resulted in a Korean and Chinese victory and the Japanese retreat back to Tsushima Island. <a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGood_friend100_562e.html" title="User:Good friend100">Good friend100</a> 18:24, 28 June 2006 (UTC) Strategic victory of Japan sounds POV to me.

<p>Since the battle was completed by withdrawal of the Japanese fleet, it considers as the victory of the Chinese and Korean conbined navy tactically, but since withdrawal support of the Konishi army which was the purpose of this strategy was attained, it considers as strategic victory of Japan.<a href="../../../b/y/o/User%7EByouyou_d33f.html" title="User:Byouyou">Byouyou</a> 09:36, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Japan's objective was to pickup retreating land soldiers. Japan's objective was not to engage any Korean or Chinese forces. The Korean and Chinese fleet stopped the Japanese navy from reaching Suncheon, which was where the Japanese land troops were waiting. Japan was retreating overall, but they did not know of their upcoming battle at Noryang and they expected to retreat peacefully.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Japan never expected a battle at Noryang or when they decided to retreat. You don't win a battle because your purpose is to "retreat". You could say "Oh, we're going to retreat and if we retreat we win because our objective is to retreat".</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Stop talking so literally! Is it a joke or something, or is it because you really think Japan won this battle?. The coalition fleet detroyed the Japanese fleet and Konishi lost 450 ships out of 500. 50 Japanese ships limped back to Busan where they finally retreated back to Tsushima Island. <a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGood_friend100_562e.html" title="User:Good friend100">Good friend100</a> 19:25, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Good friend100, many sources (including mine) indicate that only 200 Japanese ships were destroyed. (<a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikimachine_1c21.html" title="User:Wikimachine">Wikimachine</a> 19:59, 1 July 2006 (UTC))</p>

<dd>There is an Imjin War book <i>Samurai Invasion: Japan's Korean War 1592-1598</i>, by a famous samurai historian, Stephen Turnbull. In the book, on page 227, it is clearly written "Out of 500 Japanese ships only 50 survived to limp home." <a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGood_friend100_562e.html" title="User:Good friend100">Good friend100</a> 23:27, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Good friend100, it seems that you don't have the fundamental knowledge about this battle. Konishi Yukinaga had not participated in this battle. The Konishi army was the garrison of Suncheon and retreated safely from Suncheon to Pusan on the next day of this naval battle. The Chinese and Korean combined navy was not able to prevent it.<a href="../../../b/y/o/User%7EByouyou_d33f.html" title="User:Byouyou">Byouyou</a> 09:48, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>As for this battle, the Korean version is more accurate than this English version. Therefore, you may read it.<a href="../../../b/y/o/User%7EByouyou_d33f.html" title="User:Byouyou">Byouyou</a> 10:25, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Don't change the subject. You are wrong about "Japan's victory". I have a good knowledge about the Noryang Point battle. Don't accuse me knowing nothing because I have been rewriting the entire <a href="../../../i/m/j/Imjin_War_7557.html" title="Imjin War">Imjin War</a> article. Also, nearly all the battle articles were stubs, which I have modified into what they are now and I have added the pictures too.</p>
<p>Also, where is the link to the Korean source? As I said before, you don't win by retreating. Japan's objective was to retreat. And they succeeded in doing that but they did not expect Admiral Yi to destroy their fleet.</p>
<p>"Retreated safely from Suncheon to Pusan"? The Korean and Chinese navy did very well to prevent the Japanese from picking up all the soldiers from Busan. That's what happened at the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Noryang_Point_07ea.html" title="Battle of Noryang Point">Battle of Noryang Point</a>!</p>
<p>Also, just because it is an English source doesn't mean that it is not as accurate.</p>
<p>Overall, your way of thinking is too literal. That wouldn't happen if you had a "fundamental knowledge" of the Imjin War itself. <a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGood_friend100_562e.html" title="User:Good friend100">Good friend100</a> 15:47, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>"Hero Yi sank 459 Japanese ships&#160;!" , this kind of insistence doesn't possess great significance. The numbers are various only even in Korean records. Moreover, the commander who was killed is none at all in Japanese fleet compared with Chinese and Korean navy at which many commanders were killed. Therefore, even children will understand it is foolish to insist that it was complete victory of Korea and to enumerate excessive counts.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Important point is to understand not uncertain numbers of sunken ships but the whole image of this battle correctly. It was Shimazu fleet that participated in this battle though repeated. Please understand the basic fact that the Konishi fleet had been staying in Suncheon on that day of the naval battle, and they bypassed around the south of Namhae island and escaped to east the next day. <a href="../../../b/y/o/User%7EByouyou_d33f.html" title="User:Byouyou">Byouyou</a> 11:33, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>First of all, you keep writing down a bunch of garbage that you have already repated up above. You're not even responding to what I wrote.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I already stated the reference where 450 Japanese ships were destroyed. You don't understand what I'm talking about. "Hero Yi sank 459 Japanese ships!" That has nothing to do with what I am saying. Also, look who is the one without "fundamental knowledge". Admiral Yi destroyed 450 battleships, not 459.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Are you Japanese or a Japanese sympathizer? It doesn't make sense why you keep stating that the Japanese army escaped and how you keep thinking the Battle of Noryang Point was not important and how the "number of Japanese ships" are not important. The Battle of Noryang was an important battle because the Korean and Chinese navy destroyed the Japanese navy and prevented them from escaping with their entire army.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"It was Shimazu fleet that participated" where is your source? "Bypassed around south of Namhae Island" I have not read any internet sources or books that state this. Where is your source? State all your references, and then you are probably right.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>So, there were two fleets, Shimazu and Konishi fleet? Um, no, only one fleet, Konishi's fleet of 500 ships were sent to pickup the Japanese army. And on the way there, the coalition fleet stopped them at Noryang. Read the article.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>So, Mr. Bigmouth, if you believe Japan won Noryang Point and retreated safely, then why don't you argue over the entire <a href="../../../i/m/j/Imjin_War_7557.html" title="Imjin War">Imjin War</a> on its talk page? If you believe Japan won the war overall, why don't you argue at the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Okpo_622f.html" title="Battle of Okpo">Battle of Okpo</a>, <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Sacheon_%281592%29_4b52.html" title="Battle of Sacheon (1592)">Battle of Sacheon (1592)</a>, or <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Myeongnyang_cc74.html" title="Battle of Myeongnyang">Battle of Myeongnyang</a>? At Myeongnyang, Admiral Yi destroyed a Japanese fleet of 300 with only 13 ships. Do you still think Admiral Yi is "Hero Yi"? Don't downgrade Admiral Yi because he is a very respected man.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>

<p>What the victory of the battle means? Does it mean the fullfilment of the goals that were settled? If it does, then I see no reason to claim victory for Korean and Chinese fleet. The goal of the Japanese guys was to retreat to Japan. And they managed to do that, despite the heavy causlties. Correct me if I wrong. The goal of the Korean-Chinese forces was to prevent the Japanese retreat. Did they achieved that goal? No. They managed to dammage only the half of the enemys fleet and even lost admiral Yi. So, the Koreans won the war, but the Japanese didnt lose this battle. There was no decisive victory.--<a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex_Kov_4f0b.html" title="User:Alex Kov">Alex Kov</a> 09:56, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>A truly accurate figure of casualties on the Japanese side may not be known because the Japanese do a poor job of recording events that were embarrassing to themselves. The Chinese tradition of accurately recording disasters for the benefit of good governance for future generations is a tradition that the Japanese did not follow well. However, the figure of 200 ships sunk and 100 captured is corroborated by Chen Lien's battle report given to the Ming court and in Yu Song Yong's "Book of Corrections." The figure of 15,000 Japanese casualties is my personal estimate based on the number of ships sunk and the total number of Japanese involved in combat. If you take the troop figures for the Shimazu, Tachibana, So and Wakizaka, plus naval personnel, you have about 20,000 men. <a href="../../../w/a/n/User%7EWangKon936_304e.html" title="User:WangKon936">WangKon936</a> 16:33, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>The Ming fleet had two Korean panokseon ships which were given to them by Yi Soon Shin. These two ships were boarded and destroyed by the Japanese during the battle probably because this was the first time that the Chinese had used the ships in combat and didn't know how to properly implement them and/or probably didn't have the proper weapons on board.

<p>I have cleaned up a number of minor basic grammatical and stylistic issues, and I think that following WangKon's hard work, the article deserves to be bumped up to B-class. It is well-cited, as neutrally POV as I might expect it to be, covers the topic well with seemingly no major omissions, contains the appropriate and well-filled-out infobox, and has no major grammatical errors. Overall, I must admit, I still think the writing style is somewhat awkward, but it's more than readable enough to be informative. Still needs some work to bring it close to A-class though.

<dd>Thanks for the wordsmithing! I agree that the structure still needs some work and I'll probably go back into it later.

<p><a href="../../../k/o/r/User%7EKorea_history_2826.html" title="User:Korea history">Korea history</a> has asserted that there were 60,000 Japanese at Noryang. That is simply not true.

<dd>Turnbull's assertion that 450 ships were sunk were from rather recent Korean secondary sourcs. The best estimates on Japanese casualties are from Hawley's book <i>Imjin War</i> where Hawley used Korean and Chinese primary sources. Chen Lin's battle report says 200 ships burned and 100 ships captured, whereas The Book of Corrections says 200 ships sunk. Chen Lin's battle report is more accurate then Turnbull's sources. Also, Chen Lin had no motivation to under count the Japanese casualties, given that Ming battle honors were based on the number of casualties that you claim against an enemy. <a href="../../../w/a/n/User%7EWangKon936_304e.html" title="User:WangKon936">WangKon936</a> 02:52, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That web site is actually not bad and I've gone there a few times. However, I said <i>primary</i> sources. That site is a secondary source. Do you not understand what a <i>primary</i> source is? Both <a href="../../../y/u/_/Yu_Songnyong_ba79.html" title="Yu Songnyong">Yu Songnyong</a> (Minister of Affairs) and Yi Wan (Admiral Yi's nephew) say 200 ships were sunk. You can see this in the <i>Chingbirok</i> and <i>Admiral Yi's Biography</i>. Chen Lin further adds to this by saying that an additional 100 ships were captured. This is taken from Hawley's book <i>Imjin Wars</i>, which Hawley got directly from Ming battle reports. These are <i>primary</i> sources. I too first believed that 450 ships were sunk, but I could not verify it, thus I must rely on the most accurate <i>primary</i> sources. My chief motivation is to best represent Admiral Yi's legacy through accurate reporting. Anything else is a severe disservice to him and damage the credibility of Yi's achievments. What is your chief motivation? <a href="../../../w/a/n/User%7EWangKon936_304e.html" title="User:WangKon936">WangKon936</a> 19:15, 18 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>You questioning my efforts? I'm trying to prevent this article, which I helped bring it up from stub status, to becoming some story. Why do we need to know who "Kumi" is? Why is it important?
<dl>
<dd>Not questioning your efforts. Questioning your motivation because you put a lot of information that is not well supported. The presence of Kumi, a servant girl, is in <i>Admiral Yi's Biography</i> written by Yi's nephew, Yi Wan. Kumi's presence is not mentioned in secondary sources because of Korean confucian bias toward's woman witnesses. Before I became involved, this article was at "start" phase. My goal is to get it to A-class, which will be one of the only <i>Imjin War</i> article that is A-Class status. <a href="../../../w/a/n/User%7EWangKon936_304e.html" title="User:WangKon936">WangKon936</a> 04:11, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The Chinese and Korean fleet did not attack the Japanese ships in melee combat until the later half of the battle. This accounts for the minimal casualties of the Korean and Chinese soldiers. The Chinese did not simply rush in before damaging the Japanese fleet with cannons.

<dd>It appears clear that you haven't read the latest book on the Imjin War by Samuel Hawley who implies that close in ship to ship fighting did occur rather early in the fight. <a href="../../../w/a/n/User%7EWangKon936_304e.html" title="User:WangKon936">WangKon936</a> 21:25, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There was no melee combat in the very beginning of the battle. How do you think this accounts for only the couple hundred casualties of Admiral Yi and Chen Lin? Its extremely low compared to Japanese casualties because we didn't start melee combat until later in the battle. In the first half, cannon fire and hwachas were used and practically no Korean or Chinese soldier was killed or wounded because of the few cannons the Japanese had and the arquebuses had not enough range. <a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGood_friend100_562e.html" title="User:Good friend100">Good friend100</a> 22:08, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Most of today's edits and practically all the inline cites are based on work that I did during the first and second weeks of March. I haven't finished on grammar yet. I've been too busy putting out pointless little fires on Talk|Koguryo. Neither of you guys have been all that helpful in putting inline cites, adding well documented content or freeing up my time at Talk|Koguryo so I can finish my work on Noryang. <a href="../../../w/a/n/User%7EWangKon936_304e.html" title="User:WangKon936">WangKon936</a> 21:29, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Ummm, what are you talking about. Before you came here, I was one of the major contributers who pulled this article from stub status as well as most of the other battles. Its inconsiderate to assume that I have been doing nothing. Check out the Japanese invasions of Korea article before you came here. It was pretty ugly and I contributed heavily to make the article the way it is.</dd>

<dd>Yes, I know participating in the talk page of Goguryeo is not very productive, but I'm pretty much out of the discussion because the talk is way over my head and what I can comprehend. <a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGood_friend100_562e.html" title="User:Good friend100">Good friend100</a> 22:05, 26 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>We are not talking about the Imjin War article or other Korean related articles here. We are talking specifically about the Noryang article. I started my edits in March 5, 2007 and if you see all the edits prior to this, you'll see a vastly different article. Poorly cited, not very well written, with very little prelude and aftermath detail. If you doubt me check here:<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Battle_of_Noryang&amp;oldid=112571875" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Battle_of_Noryang&amp;oldid=112571875" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Battle_of_Noryang&amp;oldid=112571875</a>.

<dd>Anyways, I doubt that this can be moved up to FA class. There is just not enough information out there to do so. There is a good deal of primary documentation on this battle, but I don't think there is enough. I think the best we can hope for is A-Class. But that's easier said then done. <a href="../../../w/a/n/User%7EWangKon936_304e.html" title="User:WangKon936">WangKon936</a> 00:55, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Goodfriend, where did you get info (source) for the following passage?</p>
<p><i>When the Japanese fleet was significantly damaged, Chen Lin ordered his fleet to engage in melee combat with the Japanese. This, however, allowed the Japanese to use their arquebuses and fight using their traditional fighting style of boarding enemy ships. When Chen Lin's flagship was attacked, Admiral Yi ordered his fleet to engage in hand to hand combat as well.</i></p>
<p>You don't cite a source. Personally, I don't know if the battle happened in that order. Is it an assertion based on your understanding of how the facts fit or was it from a source that can be cited? As far as I know, the Koreans and Chinese blocked the east end of Noryang together and attacked together. I could be wrong, but let's discover the source that may reflect this. <a href="../../../w/a/n/User%7EWangKon936_304e.html" title="User:WangKon936">WangKon936</a> 06:19, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>My source came from <i>Samurai Invasion</i>. It clearly says that that Admiral Yi used the same tactic like his other ones by bombarding the Japanese with cannons. Again, I have reasoned that only a couple hundred casualties that Admiral Yi and Chen Lin suffered (as well as all of Admiral Yi's other battles) does not account for the early melee engagement. The Korean and Chinese forces would have suffered far more casualties if that had happened. <a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGood_friend100_562e.html" title="User:Good friend100">Good friend100</a> 22:22, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The battle of Noryang was carried out the same way as Admiral Yi's previous battles. Although he did attack the Japanese in hand to hand combat, even that was after Chen Lin's flagship was attacked. <a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGood_friend100_562e.html" title="User:Good friend100">Good friend100</a> 22:23, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, <i>Samurai Invasions</i> isn't the best source out there. Even Turnbull will admit that there is much that can be done to improve it. He said (through emails to me) that he will work on getting another book or campaign book on the Imjin War out, although his current project is a book about the waesong (Japanese fortresses). How much bombardment vs. hand-to-hand fighting took place in the battle and when it took place, etc. are valid questions and may need further research to figure out. I'll have to do some digging. You may be right, and your reasoning certainly makes sense. I'd just feel more comfortable if we had stronger sources that bear it out. <a href="../../../w/a/n/User%7EWangKon936_304e.html" title="User:WangKon936">WangKon936</a> 21:43, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Ok then, but what about Samuel Hawley's <b>Imjin War</b>? Does it not have info of the Battle of Noryang? Sorry, I don't have the book. <a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGood_friend100_562e.html" title="User:Good friend100">Good friend100</a> 22:28, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Dear Alex,</p>
<p>I've reverted your changes in this article. The reason for this is because the battle of Noryang was not suppose to block the entire Japanese army from retreat. It's goal, as clearly stated in the article (and carefully derived from numerous reputable sources), was to keep Konishi and Shimazu seperated and do as much damage as possible to Shimazu's fleet. Once Admiral Yi knew that Shimazu was coming to Konishi's aid, he knew that the blockade was untenuable. All Japanese ships linked up in Pusan and left a week after the battle of Noryang and <i>then</i> left for Japan. Nowhere in Admiral Yi's diary or biography is any claim that his goal was to stop <i>all</i> Japanese troops from withdrawing. He was most focused on Konishi's waesong at Sun'chun. <a href="../../../w/a/n/User%7EWangKon936_304e.html" title="User:WangKon936">WangKon936</a> 15:35, 5 April 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>However, regardless of what the Korean goal was, the Japanese goal was to safely withdraw as many troops as possible, and in this they can be said to have succeeded. In any battle, the goals of both sides must be taken into consideration, no? <a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELordAmeth_30dd.html" title="User:LordAmeth">LordAmeth</a> 16:08, 6 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>But we are talking about the casualties and the damage done to each side. And, the Japanese simply could have turned back to Japan instead of doing their rendevous and then call the battle of Noryang their "victory".</p>
<p>We had an issue like this before and its becoming a serious pain in the neck with all these Japanese POV people wailing over this article. <a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGood_friend100_562e.html" title="User:Good friend100">Good friend100</a> 16:14, 6 April 2007 (UTC)</p>
