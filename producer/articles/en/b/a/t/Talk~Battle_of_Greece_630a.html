<p>Most of the material here seems to duplicate the material in <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greco-Italian_War_778d.html" title="Greco-Italian War">Greco-Italian War</a>, which is a more complete article. However this article has better formatting. I would like to propose that these two articles be merged. It is worth noting that <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greco-Italian_War_778d.html" title="Greco-Italian War">Greco-Italian War</a> already has details on the German intervention, which is not stricly Greco-Italian... I don't have an opinon yet on which name is better for the resulting article.</p>

<dd>That's true, but the solution is not a merger, but addition of information here. By the time the Germans and British are heavily involved, it has become the distinct "Battle of Greece."--<a href="../../../j/p/b/User%7EJpbrenna_8d3a.html" title="User:Jpbrenna">Jpbrenna</a> 22:53, 28 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>OK. That makes sense. In that case, the material here related to the initial battle with Italy should be shortened or removed (with a link to Greco-Italian War instead), and likewise the material in that article related to the German intervention should be shorened to removed (with a link here). If both articles are to remain, there needs to be a deliniation of where the "Greco-Italian War" ends and the "Battle of Greece" begins. Right now, <i>both</i> articles list the same start and end dates... <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmason888_4d94.html" title="User:Jmason888">Jamie</a> 23:53, 29 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The most obvious split is at the German intervention (6 April). That before (the fight between the Greeks and the Italians in Albania) should be "Greco-Italian War", after German intervention should be "German Invasion of Greece" rather than the more ambiguous "Battle for Greece". The problem may be correcting other articles that link in here to decide whaich of the 2 they should link to. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike_Young_44a7.html" title="User:Mike Young">Mike Young</a> 07:44, 30 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>The convention in English is to call it the "Battle of Greece," although it was a rapid series of battles, like the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_France_ab9b.html" title="Battle of France">Battle of France</a>. A Google search shows me that Η μάχη της Ελλάδος (literally: "The Battle of Greece") is at least somewhat productive in Greek circles, as well. I would even hazard a guess that the Germans even call it "Schlacht von Greichenland" or "Landschlacht um Griechenland," though you'd have to ask them. Googling for those terms brings up the German Wikipedia article about the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Platea_9709.html" title="Battle of Platea">Battle of Platea</a>.</dd>

<dd>It's true, the cadence is very rapid and the language is close to heaping praise on the German war machine, but I don't think it is pro-Nazi propaganda. The person who wrote it (not me, I just transferred some of it here) seems excited by the rapidity and efficiency with which the Germans took Greece, not the fact that they decided to do it. It is true that the German effort from a purely military standpoint was impressive; however, it should also be mentioned that the Greeks put up an astonishingly effective resistance given their limited resources, that the British participated too, and that the German campaign was often prosecuted with incredible cruelty against civilians. For instance, one of the reasons that the Germans were able to take Crete so soon after the fall of the mainland is that they built numerous fighter and bomber bases on the mainland and some of the islands, essentially with Greek civilian slave labor. The Greco-British forces on the mainland might have been able to put up a better fight against the Luftwaffe if they had more facilities available and could spread out their already limited air assets so that they couldn't all be destroyed in a single attack. Apparently though, the Greeks and their British allies didn't want to enslave the very people they were trying to protect, so they didn't corvee them. These are the kinds of things that should be mentioned in this article. Some of the excited language should be toned down as well; this is an encyclopedia, not a popular history magazine. Unfortunately, I will be too occupied with term papers, labs and tests etc. until about mid-December to do much work here. Perhaps some of the other contributors could make a start? --<a href="../../../j/p/b/User%7EJpbrenna_8d3a.html" title="User:Jpbrenna">Jpbrenna</a> 22:53, 28 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I say <i>no.</i> The current Operation Marita article is simply a not-very-detailed German order-of-battle, and it would be improper to reproduce a detailed orbat in this article. We should report army and corps-level formations in the article, and link to a detailed orbat down to the regimental level. This should be named "Greece order of battle," and expanded to include Greek, British, Italian and Bulgarian formations.

<p>The article has some faults about the casualties. First, it does not include the true German casualties, but it shows the 'official' casualties as announced in the Reichstag. Second, the casualties shown in the article are of both the attack against Greece AND Yugoslavia. Xristar</p>

how would the "true" casualties be determined?</p>

<dd>To ignore the official casualties released brings us into the realm of speculation and conjecture - this is highly inappropriate for a factual NPOV article.

<dd>Very well done indeed, Periklis! One problem this article still has, however, is that it includes too much of the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greco-Italian_War_778d.html" title="Greco-Italian War">Greco-Italian War</a>. Much of what is said in the present article (quotes of Mussolini etc) would be better transferred to the more relevant article. Also, I think the casualty figures refer to both campaigns, the Italian as well as the German.

<dd>Thanks. I feel that the info regarding the Italian invasion should be kept in this article as well as it gives relevent background to the campaign and constitutes a part of the "Battle of Greece". Also, when I think "Battle of Greece" I would imagine that it started from October 28, 1940. We could put the info in the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greco-Italian_War_778d.html" title="Greco-Italian War">Greco-Italian War</a> article as well, but I feel that we should keep it here as well.

<dl>
<dd><b>1. General suggestions</b>

<li>Prose: My feeling is that the article need an overall slight copyediting. Try the article tell a story. Make the prose coherent and the article to flow.

<li>Footnotes: I've many remarks here:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>I have some doubts about the credibility and the verifiability of some internet sources. Let's take note 8: <a href="http://www.onwar.com/chrono/1941/mar41/f16mar41.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.onwar.com/chrono/1941/mar41/f16mar41.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.onwar.com/chrono/1941/mar41/f16mar41.htm</a>. I go to an Internet article which is not signed. Who tells me that this is a credible source? Is there any author I can trust?</li>
<li>Let's go to the format of this notes. When you mention an internate source you must have:title, author (if there is one), date it was retrieved. In note 8 where is the date it was retrieved and where is the title?</li>
<li>You citate note 24 like this: <a href="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/4_May%2C_1941" class="external free" title="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/4_May%2C_1941" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/4_May%2C_1941</a> Adolf Hitler's speech to the Reichstag on May 4, 1941. The right format is this: <a href="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/4_May%2C_1941" class="external text" title="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/4_May%2C_1941" rel="nofollow">Adolf Hitler's speech to the Reichstag on May 4, 1941</a>, [author if there is one], retrieved: [date it was retrieved].</li>
<li>Notes 27-29 are not correctly citated. Where are the titles? The authors? The fact they are acrobat reader does not mean that this information is not needed.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>References and Further Reading: It is uncyclopedic to mix References and Further Reading. In "References" you should mention only the sources you used in the "Footnotes". All the other books go to "Further reading". In this way, you have three sections (something I also do in the articles I write):"Footnotes", "References" and "Further reading". Some other editors choose to mix "Footnotes" and "References", but "Further reading" is always seperated.</li>
<li>We do not <i>"quote"</i>. We just "quote".</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd><b>1. More specific suggestions</b>
<ul>
<li>"had unleashed its “Blitzkrieg” and overran much of Western Europe. Benito Mussolini had grown jealous of Hitler’s conquests and decided to do some conquering of his own. Italy had already occupied Albania (Greece’s northwestern neighbor) in 1939 and several British Commonwealth strongholds in Africa but could not boast the same victories of Nazi Germany. Mussolini, who regarded South-eastern Europe as lying within the Italian sphere of influence, decided to attack Greece, as it seemed to be an easy opponent.[3] Mussolini told Count Ciano: Hitler always faces me with a fait accompli. This time I am going to pay him back in his own coin. He will find out from the papers that I have occupied Greece.[4]" This section needs copyediting. In some sections the language is a bit uncyclopedic. Also the quote should not be in italics but like that: "Hitler always faces me with a fait accompli. This time I am going to pay him back in his own coin. He will find out from the papers that I have occupied Greece."</li>
<li>"Documents later discovered showed that every detail of the attack had been prepared... His prestige needed some indisputable victories to balance the sweep of Napoleonic triumphs of Nazi Germany." Who says that? And why are his words important? The citation is not enough. Tell us that this or this historian tells that, in order to emphasize on the importance of his words.</li>
<li>"The line was quickly outflanked by German Panzer forces (2nd Panzer Division) invading through southern Yugoslavia and down the Vardar Valley, meeting only sporadic resistance from hastily assembled Greek forces." Two participles in the line. I donot know this is the best prose.</li>
<li>"The outcome of initial clashes with the Germans at Vevi were not encouraging, while the rapid advance of the Panzers into Thessaloniki and Prilep in Southern Yugoslavia greatly disturbed Wilson, who was faced with the prospect of being pinned by the invading Germans operating from Thessaloniki while being flanked by the German XL Panzer Corps descending through the Monastir Gap." Tooooo long sentence.</li>
<li>"Effect on World War II" seems to me a bit stubby. I think you can expand it with further analysis and information.</li>
<li>"See also" section goes before "Footnotes" and "References". But in this case this section looks to me redundant. Most of its links are already linked within the main article. So, why do we need it. After all, "See also" sections are not in fashion this period.</li>

<p>To what extent should the battle of Crete be incorporated in this article? Should it constitute as a part of the battle of Greece because it was Greek territory or an entirely different episode?

<dd>As far as I am aware, the term "Battle of Greece" usually refers to the German invasion and occupation of the mainland alone. I suppose that is because from the British POV (they gave the names), they did indeed fight two distinct "battles": for mainland Greece and for Crete. The Greco-Italian War, likewise, was a different affair. In Greece, obviously, the term "Battle of Greece" would denote all 3 campaigns, but the separation in three phases remains. So I think that, just as with the Greco-Italian War, it should be briefly mentioned, since it was the conclusion of the German invasion, but otherwise it is considered a separate episode and is treated as such by most histories. <a href="../../../c/p/l/User%7ECplakidas_9a3f.html" title="User:Cplakidas">Cplakidas</a> 10:35, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As a Brit, I'd support Cplakidas. The Greco-Italian War and Crete are seen as separate actions with their own distinct characteristics. Merging the three would not clarify anything and is no more appropriate than merging, say, all the battles of the North African Campaign. From, say, a German or Italian POV, the split might be different, but the audience here is predominantly English-speaking. <a href="../../../f/o/l/User%7EFolks_at_137_5f34.html" title="User:Folks at 137">Folks at 137</a> 18:33, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I've commented on that article's talk page. The paragraph on Vevi in this article does a good job of describing the forces that were there and what they intended to do. However, it does not describe what happened there in all that great of detail. It just says "After heavy fighting the Germans broke through."

<p>Small thing, should be easy to fix. The Keegan quote that's just been cited in the new note 1, should explicitly mention at first reference which book it is, though I assume it is the 2005 one. Also should expand quote to say <i>why</i> it was significant for the outcome of war - no doubt for the delay in the invasion of Russia.

<dl>
<dd>Well, the entire quote says this <b>Mussolini's Greek adventure thus had the direct effect of driving Hitler into heightening his war effort against Britain, though in her Mediterranean empire rather than against her coasts; it also had the indirect effect of commiting him to a seizure of territory-useful but not essential to the launching of Barbarossa-which made any agreement of 'spheres of influence' between him and Stalin impossible. In that respect the Greek campaign was to be decisive in determing the future course of the Second World War.</b> (p. 144) His book is cited under "Further Reading" but it should have been under "References"-I will fix that. Well, that is the quote, any thoughts on how to better incorporate that into the article? <a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPeriklis__fc68.html" title="User:Periklis*">Periklis*</a> 05:11, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>What do you think of my addition to the sentence? Also, paragraph above, did Germany really invade 'reluctantly'? <a href="../../../b/u/c/User%7EBuckshot06_17a2.html" title="User:Buckshot06">Buckshot06</a> 05:39, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I've made a minor edit on the addition but I think it is alright. Maybe we can slightly expand it later, but its alright. Regarding the invasion-The Germans undoubtedly invaded reluctantly. This can be attested to by Goebbel's diaries and Hitler's speech to the Reichstagg or Wilhelm Kietel's memoirs where they repeatedly state they went in reluctantly.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Regarding Keegan however, I'm not exactly sure he says it delayed Barbarossa. I know that many scholars do argue that it did, but I'm not sure Keegan does. Keegan writes <b>In the aftermath, historians would measure its significance in terms of the delay Marita had or had not imposed on the unleashing of Barbarossa, an exercise ultimately to be judged profitless, since it was the Russian weather, not the contingencies of subsidiary campaigns, which determined Barbarossa's launch date.</b>(p. 158)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Do you think I should find another scholar who argues it delayed Barbarossa? Or should I say Keegan thinks it <i>may</i> have? <a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPeriklis__fc68.html" title="User:Periklis*">Periklis*</a> 06:27, 19 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>No, Keegan's a pretty solid historian, and I tend to think that if he says the delay in Barbarossa didn't matter we shouldn't try and twist things to say it did. What would be good is a little bit of explanation as to why the Germans invaded if they did it reluctantly - just to save the Italians? This may be already in there for all I know.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Perhaps we can expand a little on why the Germans invaded. General Wavell would say that Germany coult "not afford to see Italy defeated or even held." So it was partly to save the Italians. It was also because Hitler did not want British planes near the Ploesti Oilfields in Romania, and also because he wanted a secure southern flank. Perhaps we can expand on that but is it needed in the lead or somewhere else? <a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPeriklis__fc68.html" title="User:Periklis*">Periklis*</a> 20:25, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Regarding this edit:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Other historians such as Antony Beevor claim that it was not Greek resistance that delayed the Axis invasion of the Soviet Union, but instead the slow construction of airfields in Eastern Europe.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After having a look at the text itself, that doesn't seem to be at all what Beevor says <a href="http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-WH2Gree-c8.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-WH2Gree-c8.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>.

<dd>The text which you link us to was not written by <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antony_Beevor_095d.html" title="Antony Beevor">Antony Beevor</a>. Beevor, in his book "Crete:The Battle and the Resistance," says that the Greek campaign did not delay Barbarossa. I decided to add this in order to give more balance to both sides of the argument. Maybe I misunderstood you, what exactly is your concern?
