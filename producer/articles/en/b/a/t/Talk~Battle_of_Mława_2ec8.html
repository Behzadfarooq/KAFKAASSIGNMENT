<p>can we get another, more reputable source to back this up? sorry I did not see that before, but i read a translation of the article and there was nothing of that kind in it til you cited the exact sentence. We still need a better reference than a tabloid though. What's next? National Enquirer cited for proof of UFOs?</p>

<dd>Gazeta Olsztyńska is hardly a tabloid, at least not more than any local daily newspaper is. The fact that the article does not suit your POV does not yet make this newspaper a tabloid, does it. As such it is just as valid reference as any other reliable newspaper, but just to make you happier I added two sources more, just feel free to use them. <i><font color="#901">//</font></i><a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalibutt_9a46.html" title="User:Halibutt">Halibu</a><a href="../../../h/a/l/User_talk%7EHalibutt_5cbf.html" title="User talk:Halibutt">tt</a> 09:05, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>well, when you claim there is a reference that is claimed to say something, it helps that the reference should be more than one (1) sentence, perhaps a whole reference on this battle. not to mention that reference used does not cite it's sources, and is not concerned with history as this article is. We all know the tendencies of local newspapers to just print what the person they interviewed said, without asking for it to be backed up.</p>

<p>From the official web site of the <a href="../../../v/i/n/Vinkt_Massacre_0fe6.html" title="Vinkt Massacre">Vinkt</a> Museum: <a href="http://www.vinkt.be/pages/mei3.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.vinkt.be/pages/mei3.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> "Diezelfde dag poogden Duitse soldaten het Schipdonkkanaal in Deinze over te steken. Burgers uit de stad werden meegenomen als levend schild." Anyone who understands German should have no problem understanding the last sentence. "The same day, German soldiers tried to cross the Schipdonk Canal at Deinze. Civilians from the town were taken along as human shields." The Wikipedia article quoted has by now been translated into French. So, the fact that this was common (happened more than once), does not only have Polish (and Dutch) sources. --<a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Gerwazy_8ca1.html" title="User:Pan Gerwazy">Pan Gerwazy</a> 18:46, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>if it is that common as you claim than does it need mentioning? it was common but most battle articles don't refer to such actions. I don't mean that we should ignore it, but if it is as common as you claim, it would be assumed as it is a common part of war.</p>
<p>And we are not referring to the Vinkt Massacre here, you cannot point to it happening somewhere else and say definitively that it happened here. I asked for a second source on this event, not on a totally different event involving totally different people.</p>

<dd>Of course, it is not about Vinkt - this is a talk page, we can use intellectual argument here. I only wanted to point out that it happened more than once (without the German High Command punishing the officers responsible - very important), which makes the claim more plausible. And no, it was not THAT common that it does not need mentioning at all. It happened more frequently in the East than in the West, and more with raw troops than with seasoned detachments. By the way, your argument "if it was so common, why mention it" could be rephrased as "well we know they were all war criminals, so why mention this little detail". No, they were not all war criminals. --<a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Gerwazy_8ca1.html" title="User:Pan Gerwazy">Pan Gerwazy</a> 21:27, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>well, since this is a talk page, we should use INTELLECTUAL argmuments, not logical fallacies. <i>murders happened in Vinkt, so that means it happened in Mlawa</i> is not a intellectual argument.</p>
<p><i>well we know they were all war criminals, so why mention this little detail</i> u misunderstand, you claim it was commonplace, and I went on your presumption. another example of what I meant would be: <i>every living person breaths, so it doesn't need included in their biography</i>. I did not say they were common place, <b>you did.</b> notice at the start of my sentence you quoted: <i><b>if</b> it is that common as <b>you claim</b> than does it need mentioning?</i></p>

<dd>Jadger, I am sorry if I spoil what <a href="../../../c/a/s/Casablanca_%28film%29.html" title="Casablanca (film)">could be the beginning of a beautiful friendship</a>, but the point is that along with a number of reasonable edits, you deleted a <b>fact</b> with its reference. On the grounds that the reference was no good, uncheckable, standalone. Since that last point has now been refuted, that part of your edit looks suspiciously like vandalism. Now, because anyone else intervening may possible ruin the rest of your changes - would you please be so kind as to put it back yourself? --<a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Gerwazy_8ca1.html" title="User:Pan Gerwazy">Pan Gerwazy</a> 09:22, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>LMAO, have you ever heard of assuming good faith Pan Gerwazy? or atleast checking the article you are commenting on? the "reference" is already back in the article. So, before you make yourself look like even more of a fool, <i>kiss me, Pan gerwazy</i></p>
<p>now, back on topic, can someone cite another, more reliable source to back up the claims of this reference?</p>

<dd>I do not claim this is an authoritative source, and you may feel free to take it for what it is worth. Still, this is not propaganda, this is an intelligence bulletin which during wartime would be distributed mostly to American officers and enlisted men, and not available to the general population. I do not believe such a publication would have any incentive to lie in this matter, after all during a war it pays to have as accurate information as possible about the enemy available to one's own commanders. Besides, here they are just translating a German military document which sounds genuine (of course it would be much better to have access to the original).</dd>
<dd>Anyway, the dislaimer you point out applies mostly to information about military equipment, which obviously would have been much less accurate than what was available post war. Here is a description of this publication for those interested (in case the link goes down):</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>RIGHT: All able-bodied civilians are employed to clear debris. The German Army must enforce this point relentlessly, even when the work is performed under fire. (In this case the whole population was more or less directly assisting the insurgent Polish troops.)</dd>

</dl>
<p>that does not say human shields, that says they should be used to clean up debris, even under fire. It does not say they should purposefully put them in a combat zone to be shot at, it is implied that the common soldier would try to preserve civilian life (and provide covering fire). After all, if all the civilians are killed, the common soldier would have to clear the debris, something he would try to prevent. It says that they should be used to clean up debris, even under fire, not that they had to be placed in front of troops, much of the cleaning up of debris would be behind the trenches but still under fire from artillery and snipers and encircled stragglers.</p>
<p>And I also have a wartime book from the same American source that talks about Hitler's psychological state. none of the authors had ever even been on the same continent as Herr Hitler, they based all their claims on anti-Hitler rumours started by opposition parties pre-1933. It was also only available to US servicemen</p>

<p>I never used ad hominems. I simply stated that we should not assume something because it is <i>close</i> to what is stated in documents. We must take things for what they say, not what you want it to say. for instance: <i>a source says. "person A was run over by a car and died" we cannot then use that source and then say on wikipedia "person A jumped in front of a car and ended his life"</i></p>
<p>P.S. FYI your last post was ad hominem itself.</p>
