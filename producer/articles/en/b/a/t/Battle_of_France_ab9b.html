<p>Hitler had always fostered dreams about major military campaigns, to defeat the Western European nations as a preliminary step to the conquest of territory in the East, thus avoiding a two-front war. These intentions were however completely absent from the Führer-Directive N°6. This plan was firmly based on the seemingly more realistic assumption that Germany's military strength would still have to be built up for a number of years and that for the moment only limited objectives could be envisaged, aimed at improving Germany's position to survive a long protracted war<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> in the West. Hitler ordered a conquest of the Low Countries: the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg, to be executed on the shortest possible notice. It should prevent France from occupying them first, which would threaten the vital German <a href="../../../r/u/h/Ruhr_Area_6349.html" title="Ruhr Area">Ruhr Area</a>; it also should provide a basis for a successful long-term air and sea campaign against England. There was no mention whatsoever of a possible immediately consecutive attack to conquer the whole of France itself, although as much as possible of the border areas in northern France should be occupied.</p>
<p>While writing the directive Hitler had assumed that such an attack could be initiated within a period of at most a few weeks, but the very day he issued it he was disabused of this illusion. It transpired that he had been misinformed about the true state of Germany's forces. The motorised units had to recover for an estimated three months, repairing the damage to their vehicles incurred in the Polish campaign; the ammunition stocks were largely depleted.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>

The evolution of German plans for <i>Fall Gelb</i>, the invasion of the Low Countries. The series begins at the right upper corner.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>On <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_10.html" title="October 10">10 October</a> the British refused Hitler's offer for peace; on <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_12.html" title="October 12">12 October</a> the French did the same. On <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_19.html" title="October 19">19 October</a> <a href="../../../f/r/a/Franz_Halder_b4b0.html" title="Franz Halder">Franz Halder</a>, chief of staff of the <a href="../../../o/k/h/OKH_35b9.html" title="OKH">OKH</a>, the Army High Command, presented the first plan for <i>Fall Gelb</i> ("Case Yellow"), the pre-war codename of plans for campaigns in the Low Countries: the <i>Aufmarschanweisung N°1, Fall Gelb</i>, or "Instruction for the advance Number 1, Case Yellow". Halder's plan has often been compared to the <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_World_War_31c9.html" title="First World War">First World War</a> <a href="../../../s/c/h/Schlieffen_Plan_9ebc.html" title="Schlieffen Plan">Von Schlieffen Plan</a>, executed in 1914. It was similar to it in that both plans entailed an advance through the middle of Belgium. But whereas the Von Schlieffen plan had had a surprising gigantic encirclement of the French army in mind, aimed at a decisive victory, <i>Aufmarschanweisung N°1</i> was based on an unimaginative frontal attack, sacrificing a projected half a million German soldiers to attain the limited goal of throwing the Allies back to the <a href="../../../s/o/m/Somme.html" title="Somme">Somme</a>. Germany's strength would then for 1940 be spent; only in 1942<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup> the main attack against France could begin.</p>
<p>Hitler was very disappointed by Halder's plan. He had supposed the conquest of the Low Countries could be quick and cheap; but as it was now presented, it would be anything but. It has even been suggested that Halder, who was at the time conspiring against Hitler and had begun carrying a revolver to shoot him in person if necessary, proposed the most pessimistic plan possible to discourage Hitler from the attack entirely.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup> Hitler reacted in fact in two ways. Firstly he decided that the German army should attack early, ready or not, in the hope that Allied unpreparedness might bring about an easy victory after all. He set the date on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_12.html" title="November 12">12 November</a>. This led to an endless series of postponements, as time and again commanders managed to convince Hitler that the attack should be further delayed for a few days or weeks to remedy some critical defect in the preparations, or to wait for better weather conditions. Secondly, because the plan as it was didn't appeal to him, he tried to make it different, without clearly understanding in which way it could be improved. This mainly resulted in a dispersion of effort, as besides the main axis in central Belgium, secondary attacks were forseen further south. On <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_29.html" title="October 29">29 October</a> Halder let a second operational plan reflect these changes, <i>Aufmarschanweisung N°2, Fall Gelb</i>, which featured a secondary attack on the <a href="../../../l/i/%C3%A8/Li%C3%A8ge.html" title="Liège">Liège</a>-<a href="../../../n/a/m/Namur.html" title="Namur">Namur</a> axis.</p>
<p>Halder's plan was not only disliked by Hitler. <a href="../../../g/e/r/Gerd_von_Rundstedt_7c06.html" title="Gerd von Rundstedt">Gerd von Rundstedt</a>, the commander of Army Group A, also disagreed with it. Unlike Hitler however, Von Rundstedt, as a professional soldier, understood perfectly how it should be rectified. Its fundamental and obvious flaw was that it didn't conform to the classic principles of the <i>Bewegungskrieg</i>, the "<a href="../../../m/a/n/Manoeuvre_warfare.html" title="Manoeuvre warfare">manoeuvre warfare</a>", that had since the 19th century been the basis of German tactics. A breakthrough would have to be accomplished that would result in the encirclement and destruction of the main body of Allied forces. The logical place to achieve this would be the <a href="../../../s/e/d/Sedan.html" title="Sedan">Sedan</a> axis, which just happened to lie in the sector of Von Rundstedt's Army Group A. Von Rundstedt on <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_21.html" title="October 21">21 October</a> agreed with his chief of staff, Lieutenant-General <a href="../../../e/r/i/Erich_von_Manstein_5536.html" title="Erich von Manstein">Erich von Manstein</a>, that an alternative operational plan had to be arranged that would reflect these basic ideas, making his Army Group A as strong as possible at the expense of Army Group B to the north.</p>

Erich von Manstein</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>While Von Manstein was formulating the new plans in <a href="../../../k/o/b/Koblenz.html" title="Koblenz">Koblenz</a>, it so happened that Lieutenant-General <a href="../../../h/e/i/Heinz_Guderian_a6d3.html" title="Heinz Guderian">Heinz Guderian</a>, the commander of the XIXth Army Corps, Germany's elite armoured unit, was lodged in a hotel nearby.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup>. Von Manstein now considered that, if he should involve Guderian in his planning, the tank general might well come up with some rôle for his Army Corps to play in it; and this might then be used as a decisive argument to relocate XIXth Army Corps from Army Group B to Army Group A, much to the delight of Von Rundstedt. At this moment Von Manstein's plan consisted in a move from Sedan to the north, right in the rear of the main Allied forces, to engage them directly from the south in full battle. When during informal discussions invited to contribute to the plan, Guderian proposed a radical and novel idea: not only his army corps, but the entire <i>Panzerwaffe</i> should be concentrated at Sedan. And this concentration of armour should not move to the north but to the west, to execute a swift deep strategic penetration towards the <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_Channel_c0e5.html" title="English Channel">English Channel</a> independently, without waiting for the main body of infantry divisions. This could lead to a strategic collapse of the enemy, avoiding the relatively high number of casualties normally caused by a classic <i><a href="../../../v/e/r/Vernichtungsgedanke.html" title="Vernichtungsgedanke">Kesselschlacht</a></i> or "annihilation battle". Such a risky independent strategic use of armour had been widely discussed in Germany before the war, but had not at all been accepted as received doctrine; the large number of officers serving in the Infantry, which was the dominant Arm of Service, had successfully prevented this. Von Manstein himself had to admit that in this special case however it might be just the thing needed. His main objection was that it would create an open flank of over 300 kilometres, vulnerable to French counterattacks. Guderian convinced him these could be prevented by launching simultaneous spoiling attacks to the south by small armoured units. This however would be a departure from the basic concept of the Führer-Directive N°6.</p>
<p>Von Manstein wrote his first memorandum outlining the alternative plan on <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_31.html" title="October 31">31 October</a>. In it he carefully avoided mentioning Guderian's name and downplayed the strategic part of the armour units, in order not to generate unnecessary resistance.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[6]</a></sup> On <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_6.html" title="November 6">6 November</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_21.html" title="November 21">21 November</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_30.html" title="November 30">30 November</a>, <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_6.html" title="December 6">6 December</a>, <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_18.html" title="December 18">18 December</a> 1939 and <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_12.html" title="January 12">12 January</a> 1940 a further six memoranda followed, slowly growing more radical in outline. All were rejected by the OKH, nothing of their content reached Hitler.</p>
<p>The crash in <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belgium.html" title="Belgium">Belgium</a> of a light plane, on 10 January 1940, carrying two German officers with a copy of the then-current version of <i>Aufmarschanweisung N°2</i> forced <a href="../../../h/i/t/Hitler.html" title="Hitler">Hitler</a> to again postpone the invasion. It has often been suggested this incident was the cause of a drastic change in German plans, but this is incorrect; in fact a reformulation of them later on <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_30.html" title="January 30">30 January</a>, <i>Aufmarschanweisung N°3, Fall Gelb</i>, basically conformed to the earlier versions.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[7]</a></sup> Late January the troublesome Von Manstein was by instigation of Halder removed to the east by having him on <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_27.html" title="January 27">27 January</a> promoted commander of an army corps in Prussia, to begin his command in <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stettin.html" title="Stettin">Stettin</a> on <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_9.html" title="February 9">9 February</a>. His indignant staff then brought his case directly to the attention of Hitler, who was informed of it on <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_2.html" title="February 2">2 February</a>. Von Manstein was invited to explain his proposal to the <i>Führer</i> personally in Berlin on <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_17.html" title="February 17">17 February</a>; much impressed by it, Hitler the next day ordered the plans to be changed in accordance with Von Manstein's ideas. They mainly appealed to Hitler because they at last offered some real hope of a cheap victory.</p>
<p>The man who had to carry out the change was again Franz Halder — Von Manstein would not be further involved. Halder consented to shifting the main effort, the <i><a href="../../../s/c/h/Schwerpunkt.html" title="Schwerpunkt">Schwerpunkt</a></i>, to the south. Von Manstein's plan had the virtue of being unlikely (from a defensive point of view) as the <a href="../../../a/r/d/Ardennes.html" title="Ardennes">Ardennes</a> were heavily wooded and because of their poor road network implausible as a route for an invasion. An element of surprise would therefore be present. It would be essential that the Allies respond as envisioned in the original plans; namely, that the main body of French and British elite troops be drawn north to defend <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belgium.html" title="Belgium">Belgium</a>. To help to ensure this condition, German <a href="../../../a/r/m/Army_Group_B_328e.html" title="Army Group B">Army Group B</a> had to execute a holding attack in Belgium and <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Netherlands_cf8a.html" title="The Netherlands">the Netherlands</a>, giving the impression of being the main German effort, in order to draw Allied forces eastward into the developing encirclement and hold them there. To accomplish this, three of the ten available armoured divisions were still allocated to Army Group B.</p>
<p>However Halder had no intention of deviating from established doctrine by allowing an independent strategic penetration by the seven armoured divisions of Army Group A.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[8]</a></sup> Much to the outrage of Guderian this element was at first completely removed from the new plan, <i>Aufmarschanweisung N°4, Fall Gelb</i>, issued on <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_24.html" title="February 24">24 February</a>. The crossings of the river <a href="../../../m/e/u/Meuse.html" title="Meuse">Meuse</a> at Sedan should be forced by infantry divisions on the eighth day of the invasion. Only after much debate was this changed in this respect that the motorised infantry regiments of the armoured divisions would establish bridgeheads on the fourth day, to gain four days. Even now the breakout and drive to the Channel would start only on the ninth day, after a delay of five days during which a sufficient number of infantry divisions had to be built up in order to advance together with the armoured units in a coherent mass.</p>
<p>Even when adapted to more conventional methods, the new strategy provoked a storm of protest from the majority of German generals. They thought it utterly irresponsible to create a concentration of forces in a position where they couldn't possibly be sufficiently supplied, while such inadequate supply routes as there were, could easily be cut off by the French. If the Allies didn't react as expected the German offensive could end in catastrophe.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[9]</a></sup> Their objections were ignored however; Halder argued that, as Germany's strategic position seemed hopeless anyway, even the slightest chance of a decisive victory outweighed the certainty of ultimate defeat implied by inaction.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[10]</a></sup> The adaptation also implied that it would be easier for the Allied forces to escape to the south. Halder pointed out however that if so, Germany's victory would be even cheaper, while it would be an enormous blow to the reputation of the <a href="../../../e/n/t/Entente.html" title="Entente">Entente</a> — as the Anglo-French alliance was still commonly known in 1940 — to have abandoned the Low Countries. Moreover Germany's fighting power would then still be intact, so that it might be considered to immediately afterwards execute <i>Fall Rot</i>, the attack on France itself. However a decision to this effect would have to be postponed until after a possible successful completion of <i>Fall Gelb</i>. Indeed German detailed operational planning only covered the first nine days; there was no fixed timetable established for the advance to The Channel. In accordance with the tradition of the <i><a href="../../../a/u/f/Auftragstaktik.html" title="Auftragstaktik">Auftragstaktik</a></i>, much would be left to the judgment and initiative of the field commanders. This indetermination would have an enormous effect on the actual course of events.</p>
<p>In April 1940, the Germans launched for strategic reasons <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Weser%C3%BCbung_2f0d.html" title="Operation Weserübung">Operation Weserübung</a>, an attack on the neutral countries of <a href="../../../d/e/n/Denmark.html" title="Denmark">Denmark</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/r/Norway.html" title="Norway">Norway</a>. The British, French, and Free Poles responded with an <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allied_campaign_in_Norway_9bf7.html" title="Allied campaign in Norway">Allied campaign in Norway</a> in support of the Norwegians.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_France_ab9b.html" title="Edit section: Allied Strategy">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Allied Strategy</span></h2>
<p>In September 1939 Belgium and the Netherlands were still neutral. They tried to stay out of the war for as long as possible by adhering to a policy of strict neutrality. Though they in secret made arrangements with the Entente for future cooperation, should the Germans invade their territory, they refused to openly prepare for this. The Supreme Commander of the French army, <a href="../../../m/a/u/Maurice_Gamelin_f500.html" title="Maurice Gamelin">Maurice Gamelin</a>, suggested in September to take advantage of the fact that Germany was tied up in Poland by occupying the Low Countries before Germany could. This suggestion was not taken up by the French government however.</p>
<p>In September 1939, in a purely political move, French soldiers penetrated 3 miles into the Saar before withdrawing. At this time, France had deployed 98 divisions and 2,500 tanks against German forces consisting of 43 divisions and no tanks. It is probable that the French military would have defeated these forces if the Western allies had had the political will to take up an offensive.</p>
<p>After October, though important parts of the French army in the <a href="../../../1/9/3/1930s.html" title="1930s">1930s</a> had been designed to wage offensive warfare, it was decided not to take the initiative in 1940. The Allies believed that even without an <a href="../../../e/a/s/Eastern_Front_%28World_War_II%29_e4c6.html" title="Eastern Front (World War II)">Eastern Front</a> the German government might be destabilised by a <a href="../../../b/l/o/Blockade.html" title="Blockade">blockade</a>, as it had been in the First World War. For the event the Nazi regime wouldn't collapse, a possibility that seemed to grow ever more likely,<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[11]</a></sup> during 1940 a vast modernisation and enlargement programme for the Allied forces would be implemented, exploiting the existing advantages over Germany in war production to build up an overwhelming mechanised force, including about two dozen armoured divisions, to execute a decisive offensive in the summer of 1941. Should the Low Countries by that date still not have committed themselves to the Allied cause, the Entente firmly intended to violate their neutrality if necessary.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>
<p>Obviously the Germans might strike first and a strategy would have to be prepared for this eventuality. Neither the French nor the British had anticipated such a rapid defeat in Poland, and the quick German victory was disturbing. Most French generals favoured a very cautious approach. They thought it wise not presume the German intentions could be correctly predicted. A large force should be held in reserve in a central position, north of Paris, to be prepared for any contingency. Should the Germans indeed take the obvious route of advance through Flanders, they should only be engaged in northern France, when their infantry would be exhausted and they had ran out of supplies. When however they would try an attack on the centre of the Allied front, this Allied reserve would be ideally positioned to block it. If the Germans advanced through <a href="../../../s/w/i/Switzerland.html" title="Switzerland">Switzerland</a>, a large reserve would be the only means to deal with such a surprise.</p>

</div>
<p>Gamelin rejected this line of thought. For this he had several reasons. The first was that it was politically unthinkable to abandon the Low Countries to their fate, however prudent it might be from an operational point of view. Certainly the British government insisted that the Flemish coast remain under Allied control. The second reason was that the 1941 offensive had no chance of being decisive if it had to be launched from the north of France against German forces entrenched in central Belgium. The German offensive had to be contained as far east as possible. The last and for him personally most cogent argument was that Gamelin did not consider the French army capable of winning a mobile encounter battle with the German army. The French infantry divisions as yet were insufficiently motorised. The events in Poland only confirmed him in his opinion. Such a confrontation had to be avoided at all cost and Gamelin intended to send the best units of the French army along with the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Expeditionary_Force_ffa2.html" title="British Expeditionary Force">British Expeditionary Force</a> north to halt the Germans at the <a href="../../../k/w/-/KW-line_1e3f.html" title="KW-line">KW-line</a>, a defensive line that followed the river <a href="../../../d/y/l/Dyle.html" title="Dyle">Dyle</a>, east of <a href="../../../b/r/u/Brussels.html" title="Brussels">Brussels</a>, in a coherent tightly packed continuous front uniting the British, Belgian, and French armies. This plan thus presumed that the Germans planned to concentrate their forces where they could be well supplied by the better road network of northern Belgium.</p>
<p>Gamelin however did not have the personal influence to simply impose his will. The first step he took was to propose the "<a href="../../../e/s/c/Escaut.html" title="Escaut">Escaut</a>" variant as an option for Plan D — the codename for an advance into the Low Countries. It was named after the river in Flanders. This was a shrewd move: protecting the Flemish coast seemed the least one could do; on the other hand it created an enormous <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salients%2C_re-entrants_and_pockets.html" title="Salients, re-entrants and pockets">salient</a>, showing that it made more sense to defend along the shorter Dyle line, which was precisely the content of Gamelin's next proposal. This however was too transparent. His second "<a href="../../../d/y/l/Dyle_Plan_b7af.html" title="Dyle Plan">Dyle Plan</a>" met with strong opposition, not growing any less when the 10 January crash confirmed that the German plans conformed to Gamelin's expectations. Also <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Vereker%2C_6th_Viscount_Gort_f2b7.html" title="John Vereker, 6th Viscount Gort">Lord Gort</a>, the commander of the British Expeditionary Force, was beginning to expect that whatever the Germans came up with instead would not be what he had initially predicted. The main objection was that the manoeuvre was very risky. The Allied forces had to complete their advance and entrenchment before the Germans reached the line, for which there seemed to be too little time. When entrenched they would have trouble reacting to German strategic surprises, also because their fuel supplies would have to be replenished. The next problem was that this line was very vulnerable to the German main strength, their large tactical bomber force. Nothing seemed to prevent them from breaking the line by a massive bombardment, forcing the French Army to an encounter battle after all.</p>
<p>Gamelin successfully countered these arguments by adopting the seemingly reasonable assumption that the Germans would try to attempt a breakthrough by concentrating their mechanised forces. They could hardly hope to break the <a href="../../../m/a/g/Maginot_Line_9eb8.html" title="Maginot Line">Maginot Line</a> on his right flank or to overcome the allied concentration of forces on the left flank. That only left the centre. But most of the centre was covered by the river <a href="../../../m/e/u/Meuse_River_1713.html" title="Meuse River">Meuse</a>. Tanks were useless in defeating fortified river positions. However at <a href="../../../n/a/m/Namur_%28city%29.html" title="Namur (city)">Namur</a> the river made a sharp turn to the east, creating a gap between itself and the river Dyle. This Gembloux Gap, ideal for mechanised warfare, was a very dangerous weak spot. Gamelin decided to concentrate half of his armoured reserves there. By thus assuming that the decisive moment in the campaign would take the form of a gigantic tank battle, he avoided the problem of the German tactical bomber force as air attacks were considered less effective against mobile armoured units, the tanks of which would be hard to hit. Of course the Germans might try to overcome the Meuse position by using <a href="../../../i/n/f/Infantry.html" title="Infantry">infantry</a>. But that could only be achieved by massive <a href="../../../a/r/t/Artillery.html" title="Artillery">artillery</a> support, the gradual build-up of which would give Gamelin ample warning to reinforce.</p>
<p>During the first months of 1940 the size and readiness of the French army steadily grew and Gamelin began to feel confident enough to propose a somewhat more ambitious strategy. He had no intention of frontally attacking the German fortification zone, the <i><a href="../../../w/e/s/Westwall.html" title="Westwall">Westwall</a></i>, in 1941, planning instead to outflank it from the north, just as four years later <a href="../../../b/e/r/Bernard_Montgomery_2915.html" title="Bernard Montgomery">Bernard Montgomery</a> intended in <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Market_Garden_d364.html" title="Operation Market Garden">Operation Market Garden</a>. To achieve this, it would be most convenient if he already had an foothold on the north bank of the Rhine, so he changed his plans to the effect that a French army should maintain a connection north of <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antwerp.html" title="Antwerp">Antwerp</a> with the Dutch <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Redoubt_f9e6.html" title="National Redoubt">National Redoubt</a>, "Fortress Holland". He assigned his sole strategic reserve, the elite 7th Army, to this task. His only reserves now consisted of individual divisions. Again there was much opposition to this "Dyle-<a href="../../../b/r/e/Breda.html" title="Breda">Breda</a>-Plan" within the French army, but Gamelin was strongly supported by the British government, because <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holland.html" title="Holland">Holland</a> proper was an ideal base for a German air campaign against England.</p>

<p>Germany deployed about three million men for the battle. Because between 1919 and 1935 no conscription had been allowed by the <a href="../../../t/r/e/Treaty_of_Versailles_58e2.html" title="Treaty of Versailles">Treaty of Versailles</a>, in May 1940 only 79 divisions out of a total of 157 raised had completed their training; another fourteen were nevertheless directly committed to battle, mainly in Army Group C and against the Netherlands. Beside this total of 93 front divisions (ten armoured, six motorised) there were also 39 OKH reserve divisions in the West, about a third of which would not be committed to battle. About a quarter of the combat troops consisted of veterans from the First World War, older than forty.</p>
<p>The German forces in the West would in May and June deploy some 2700 <a href="../../../t/a/n/Tank.html" title="Tank">tanks</a> and <a href="../../../s/e/l/Self-propelled_gun.html" title="Self-propelled gun">self-propelled guns</a>, including materièl reserves committed; about 7500 artillery pieces were available with an ammunition stock for six weeks of fighting; an organic strength of about 2500 combat aircraft was ready for action, another thousand would during the campaign be committed to battle.</p>
<p>The German Army was divided into three army groups:</p>
<ul>
<li>Army Group A commanded by Gerd von Rundstedt, composed of 45½ divisions including seven armoured, was to execute the decisive movement, cutting a <i>"Sichelschnitt"</i> — not the official name of the operation but the translation in German of a phrase after the events coined by <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winston_Churchill_74d2.html" title="Winston Churchill">Winston Churchill</a><sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[13]</a></sup> as "Sickle Cut" (and even earlier "armoured scythe stroke"<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[14]</a></sup>) — through the Allied defenses in the <a href="../../../a/r/d/Ardennes.html" title="Ardennes">Ardennes</a>. It consisted of three armies: the Fourth, Twelfth and Sixteenth. It had three <a href="../../../p/a/n/Panzer.html" title="Panzer">Panzer</a> corps; one had been allocated to Fourth Army, but the other two were united on a special independent operational level in <i>Panzergruppe Kleist</i>. This was done to better coordinate the approach march to the Meuse river; once bridgeheads had been established they had again to be divided among Twelfth and Sixteenth Army and <i>Panzergruppe Kleist</i> abolished.</li>
<li>Army Group B under <a href="../../../f/e/d/Fedor_von_Bock_bac6.html" title="Fedor von Bock">Fedor von Bock</a>, composed of 29½ divisions including three armoured, was tasked with advancing through the Low Countries and luring the northern units of the Allied armies into a pocket. It consisted of the Eighteenth and Sixth Army.</li>
<li>Army Group C, composed of 19 divisions under <a href="../../../w/i/l/Wilhelm_von_Leeb_9454.html" title="Wilhelm von Leeb">Wilhelm von Leeb</a>, was charged with preventing a flanking movement from the east, and with launching small holding attacks against the <a href="../../../m/a/g/Maginot_Line_9eb8.html" title="Maginot Line">Maginot Line</a> and the upper <a href="../../../r/h/i/Rhine.html" title="Rhine">Rhine</a>. It consisted of the First and Seventh Army.</li>
</ul>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_France_ab9b.html" title="Edit section: Allies">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Allies</span></h3>
<p>Due to a low <a href="../../../b/i/r/Birthrate.html" title="Birthrate">birthrate</a> that had even further declined during the First World War, France had a severe relative manpower shortage. Its population was furthermore only half of that of Germany. To compensate France had mobilised about a third of the male population between the ages of 20 and 45, bringing the strength of its armed forces to over six million men, more than the entire German <i><a href="../../../w/e/h/Wehrmacht.html" title="Wehrmacht">Wehrmacht</a></i> of 5.4 million. Only 2.2 million of these served in army units in the North though, but the total was brought to over 3.3 million by the British, Belgian and Dutch forces in that area. On 10 May there were 93 French, 22 Belgian, ten British and nine Dutch divisions in the North, for a total of 134. Six of these were armoured divisions, 24 motorised divisions. Twenty-two more were being trained or assembled on an emergency basis during the campaign (not counting the reconstituted units), among which two Polish and one Czech division. Beside full divisions the Allies had many independent smaller infantry units: the Dutch had the equivalent of about eight divisions in independent brigades and battalions; the French had 29 independent Fortress Infantry Regiments. Of the French divisions eighteen were manned by colonial volunteer troops; nineteen consisted of "B-divisions", once fully trained units that however had a large number of men over thirty and needed retraining after mobilisation. The best trained Allied forces were the British divisions, fully motorised and having a large percentage of professional soldiers; the worst the very poorly equipped Dutch troops.</p>
<p>The Allied forces deployed an organic strength of about 3100 modern tanks and self-propelled guns on 10 May, another 1200 would be committed to battle in new units or from the materièl reserves; also 1500 obsolete <a href="../../../f/t/-/FT-17_c3ce.html" title="FT-17">FT-17</a> tanks were sent to the front for a total of about 5800. They had about 14,000 pieces of artillery. Enjoying thus a clear numerical superiority on the ground,<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[15]</a></sup> the Allies suffered from an inferiority in the air as only about 1500 combat aircraft were ready for action on the continent. Another 800 had been allocated to combat units. Most of the <a href="../../../r/a/f/RAF_4f12.html" title="RAF">RAF</a> was kept behind in Britain to defend it against possible German air attacks, but some 750 British planes would reinforce the 400 operational in France, either from the materièl reserves or by flying missions over the continent from British airbases. An additional 2000 aircraft were nominally part of French metropolitan combat aircraft strength but most were of an obsolete type or newly produced planes not yet ready for combat.</p>
<p>The French forces in the north had three Army Groups: the Second and the Third defended the Maginot Line in the east; the First Army Group under Gaston-Henri Billotte was situated in the west and had to execute a swing movement into the Low Countries. At the coast was the 7th Army, reinforced by a Cavalry armoured division, that had to move to the Netherlands via Antwerp; then came nine divisions of the BEF that had to position itself to the right of the Belgian army in the Dyle Line; next was the 1st Army that had to hold the Gembloux Gap, reinforced by two Cavalry armoured divisions and having an Infantry armoured division in reserve. The most southern to move was the 9th Army that had to cover the entire Meuse sector between Namur and Sedan. At Sedan the 2nd Army would form the "hinge" and remain entrenched.</p>
<p>The First Army Group had 35 French divisions; the total of forty divisions of the other Allies in its sector brought their forces equal in number to the combined German forces of Army Group A and B. However, the former only had to confront the eighteen divisions of 9th and 2nd Army and thus would have a large local superiority. To reinforce a threatened sector Gamelin had sixteen strategic reserve divisions available on General Headquarters level, two of them armoured. These were "reserve" divisions in the operational sense only, in fact consisting of high quality troops — most of them had been active divisions in peace time — and thus not comparable to the German reserve divisions that were half-trained. Confusingly, all mobilised French divisions were officially classified as A or B "reserve divisions", although most of them served directly in the front armies.</p>

<p>The French command reacted immediately, sending 1st Army Group north in accordance with Plan D. This move committed their best forces, diminished their fighting power through loss of readiness and their mobility through loss of fuel. That evening 7th Army crossed the Dutch border, finding the Dutch already in full retreat. The French and British air command was less effective than their generals had anticipated, and the <a href="../../../l/u/f/Luftwaffe.html" title="Luftwaffe">Luftwaffe</a> quickly obtained <a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_superiority.html" title="Air superiority">air superiority</a>, depriving the Allies of key reconnaissance abilities and disrupting Allied communication and coordination.</p>

<p>German 18th Army secured all the strategically vital bridges in and toward <a href="../../../r/o/t/Rotterdam.html" title="Rotterdam">Rotterdam</a>, which penetrated Fortress Holland and bypassed the <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Dutch_Water_Line_0a8a.html" title="The Dutch Water Line">New Water Line</a> from the south. However an operation organised separately by the <i>Luftwaffe</i> to seize the <a href="../../../c/a/p/Capital_of_the_Netherlands_3dd8.html" title="Capital of the Netherlands">Dutch seat of government</a>, The Hague, ended in complete failure. The airfields surrounding the city (Ypenburg, <a href="../../../o/c/k/Ockenburg.html" title="Ockenburg">Ockenburg</a>, and Valkenburg) were taken with heavy casualties, only to be lost that same day to counterattacks by the two Dutch reserve infantry divisions. The Dutch would capture or kill 1,745 <i>Fallschirmjäger</i>, shipping 1,200 prisoners to England.</p>
<p>The French 7th Army failed to block German armoured reinforcements of the <a href="../../../g/e/r/German_9th_Panzer_Division_f498.html" title="German 9th Panzer Division">9th Panzer Division</a>; they reached <a href="../../../r/o/t/Rotterdam.html" title="Rotterdam">Rotterdam</a> on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_13.html" title="May 13">13 May</a>. That same day in the east the Dutch retreated from the Grebbe Line to the New Water Line, when a counter-offensive to contain a German breach had failed.

<p>Because Army Group B had been so weakened compared to the earlier plans, the German feint offensive by 6th Army was in danger of stalling immediately, as the Belgian defences on the <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albert_Canal_277a.html" title="Albert Canal">Albert Canal</a> position were very strong. The main approach route was blocked by Fort Eben-Emael, a large fortress then generally considered the most modern in the world, controlling the junction of the Meuse and the Albert Canal. Any delay might endanger the outcome of the entire campaign, as it was essential that the main body of Allied troops was engaged before Army Group A would establish bridgeheads.</p>
<p>To overcome this difficulty, the Germans resorted to unconventional means. In the early hours of 10 May <a href="../../../d/f/s/DFS_230_74ab.html" title="DFS 230">gliders</a> landed on the roof of Fort Eben-Emael unloading assault teams that disabled the main gun cupolas with <a href="../../../h/o/l/Hollow_charge.html" title="Hollow charge">hollow charges</a>. The bridges over the canal were seized by German paratroopers. Shocked by a breach in its defences just where they had seemed the strongest, the Belgian Supreme Command withdrew its divisions to the <a href="../../../k/w/-/KW-line_1e3f.html" title="KW-line">KW-line</a> five days earlier than planned. At that moment however the BEF and the French 1st Army were not yet entrenched. When <a href="../../../e/r/i/Erich_Hoepner_1ca1.html" title="Erich Hoepner">Erich Hoepner</a>'s XVI Panzer Corps, consisting of <a href="../../../g/e/r/German_3rd_Panzer_Division_49c2.html" title="German 3rd Panzer Division">3rd</a> and <a href="../../../g/e/r/German_4th_Panzer_Division_ace0.html" title="German 4th Panzer Division">4th</a> <a href="../../../p/a/n/Panzer_Division_f92a.html" title="Panzer Division">Panzer Divisions</a> was over the bridges launched in the direction of the Gembloux Gap, this seemed to confirm the expectations of the French Supreme Command that here would be the German <i>Schwerpunkt</i>. The two French Cavalry armoured divisions, the 2nd DLM and 3rd DLMs (<i>Division Légère Mécanique</i>, "Mechanised Light Division") were ordered forward to meet the German armour and cover the entrenchment of 1st Army. The resulting Battle of Hannut on 12 and 13 May was, with about 1500 <a href="../../../a/f/v/AFV_c505.html" title="AFV">AFVs</a> participating, the largest tank battle until that date. The French lost about a hundred tanks, the Germans lost over 160 but managed on the second day to breach the screen of French tanks, which on 14 May however were successfully withdrawn after having gained enough time for the 1st Army to dig in. Hoepner against orders tried on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_15.html" title="May 15">15 May</a> to break the French line, the only time in the campaign when German armour would frontally attack a strongly held fortified position; the attempt was repelled by the 1st Moroccan Infantry Division, costing 4PD another 120 tanks. This defensive success for the French was however already made irrelevant by the events further south.</p>

The German advance until noon 16 May, 1940.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>In the centre, the progress of German Army Group A was to be delayed by Belgian motorised infantry and French Light Divisions of the Cavalry (<i>Divisions Légères de Cavalerie</i>) advancing into the Ardennes. These forces however had an insufficient anti-tank capacity to block the surprisingly large number of German tanks they encountered and quickly gave way, withdrawing behind the Meuse. The German advance was however greatly hampered by the sheer number of troops trying to force their way through the poor road network. The time-tables proved to have been wildly optimistic and soon a traffic congestion formed, in the beginning to the east reaching well over the Rhine, that would last for almost two weeks. This made Army Group A very vulnerable to French air attacks, but these didn't materialise. Although Gamelin was well aware of the situation, the French tactical bomber force was far too weak to challenge German air superiority so close to the German border. However on the 11th Gamelin ordered many reserve divisions to begin reinforcing the Meuse sector. Because of the danger the <i>Luftwaffe</i> posed, movement over the rail network was limited to the night, slowing the reinforcement, but the French felt no sense of urgency as the build-up of German divisions would be accordingly slow.</p>
<p>The German advance forces reached the Meuse line late in the afternoon of 12 May. To allow each of the three armies of Army Group A to cross, three major bridgeheads were to be established: at Sedan in the south, at Monthermé twenty kilometres to the northwest and at <a href="../../../d/i/n/Dinant.html" title="Dinant">Dinant</a>, another fifty kilometres to the north. The first units to arrive had hardly even a local numerical superiority; their already insufficient artillery support was further limited by an average supply of just twelve rounds per piece.<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[17]</a></sup></p>
<p><a name="Sedan" id="Sedan"></a></p>
<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_France_ab9b.html" title="Edit section: Sedan">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Sedan</span></h4>
<p>At Sedan the Meuse Line consisted of a strong defensive belt, constructed six kilometres deep according to the modern principles of zone defence on slopes overlooking the Meuse valley and strengthened by 103 pillboxes, manned by 147th Fortress Infantry Regiment. The deeper positions were held by the <a href="../../../5/5/t/55th_Infantry_Division_20a4.html" title="55th Infantry Division">55th Infantry Division</a> (55e DI), and this was only a grade “B” reserve division, but already reinforcements were arriving; in the morning of 13 May <a href="../../../7/1/s/71st_DI_913c.html" title="71st DI">71st DI</a> was inserted to the east of Sedan, allowing 55th DI to narrow its front by a third and deepen its position to over ten kilometres. Furthermore it had a superiority in artillery to the German units present on 13 May.<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[18]</a></sup> The French command fully expected that the Germans would only attack such formidable defences when a large infantry and artillery force had been build up, a concentration that apparently could not be completed before 20 May, given the traffic congestion — a date very similar to Halder's original projection. It thus came as a complete surprise when crossing attempts were made as early as the fourth day of the invasion.</p>
<p>On 13 May the German XIX Army Corps forced three crossings near Sedan, executed by the motorised infantry regiments of 1st, 2nd and 10th <i>Panzerdivision</i>, reinforced by the elite <i><a href="../../../i/n/f/Infantry_Regiment_Gro%C3%9Fdeutschland_2f3e.html" title="Infantry Regiment Großdeutschland">Großdeutschland</a></i> infantry regiment. Instead of slowly massing artillery as the French expected, the Germans concentrated most of their tactical bomber force to punch a hole in a narrow sector of the French lines by <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carpet_bombing.html" title="Carpet bombing">carpet bombing</a> (punctuated by <a href="../../../d/i/v/Dive_bomber.html" title="Dive bomber">dive bombing</a>). Between 12:00 and 16:00 <i><a href="../../../g/e/r/German_Air_Fleets_in_World_War_II_8655.html" title="German Air Fleets in World War II">Luftflotte</a> 3</i>, supported by <i>Luftflotte 2</i>, executed the heaviest air bombardment the world had yet witnessed and the most intense by the <i>Luftwaffe</i> in the entire war,<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[19]</a></sup> carrying out that day 1,215 bomber sorties, mainly against the narrow strip of the Sedan river bend. The forward platoons and pillboxes of the 147 RIF, little affected by the bombardment, held their positions throughout most of the 13th, initially repulsing the crossing attempts of 2nd and 10th <i>Panzerdivision</i> on their left and right; however in the centre of the river bend there was a gap in the line of bunkers. In the late afternoon <i>Großdeutschland</i> penetrated this position, trying to quickly exploit this opportunity. The deep French zone defence had been devised to defeat just this kind of <a href="../../../i/n/f/Infiltration_tactics.html" title="Infiltration tactics">infiltration tactics</a>; it now transpired however that the morale of the deeper company positions of the 55th DI had been broken by the impact of the German air attacks: they had been routed or were too dazed to any longer offer effective resistance. The French supporting artillery batteries had fled and this created an impression among the remaining main defence line troops of the 55e DI that they were isolated and abandoned. They too went into rout by the late evening of 13 May. At a cost of a few hundred casualties<sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[20]</a></sup> the German infantry had penetrated up to eight kilometres into the French defence zone by midnight; even then most of the infantry hadn't crossed yet, much of the success being due to the actions of just six platoons, mainly assault engineers.<sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[21]</a></sup></p>
<p>The disorder begun at Sedan was spread down the French lines by groups of haggard and retreating soldiers. During the night the second, 295th, regiment of 55th DI, holding the last prepared defence line at the Bulson ridge, ten kilometres from the Meuse, was panicked by the false rumour that German tanks were already behind their positions. It fled, creating a gap in the French defences, before even a single German tank had crossed the river. This "Panic of Bulson" involved the divisional artillery, so that the crossing sites were no longer in reach of the French batteries.</p>
<p>In the morning of 14 May two French <a href="../../../f/c/m/FCM_36_f055.html" title="FCM 36">FCM 36</a> tank battalions (4 and 7 BCC) and the reserve regiment of 55th DI, 213rd RI, executed a counterattack on the German bridgehead. It was repulsed at Bulson by the first German armour and anti-tank units which had been rushed across the river from 7:20 A.M. on the first pontoon bridge. That day every available Allied light bomber was employed in an attempt to destroy the three bridges; but, despite heavy losses for the RAF, mostly caused by a concentration of over 300 AA-guns, they failed to hit them.</p>
<p>The commander of XIX Army Corps, <a href="../../../h/e/i/Heinz_Guderian_a6d3.html" title="Heinz Guderian">Heinz Guderian</a>, on 12 May had indicated that he wanted to enlarge the bridgehead to at least twenty kilometres. His superior <a href="../../../e/w/a/Ewald_von_Kleist_9677.html" title="Ewald von Kleist">Ewald von Kleist</a> however ordered him to limit it to a maximum of eight kilometres before consolidation. On 14 May, 11:45 AM, Von Rundstedt confirmed this order,<sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[22]</a></sup> which basically implied that the tanks should now start to dig in. Nevertheless Guderian immediately disobeyed, expanding the perimeter to the west and to the south.</p>
<p>In the original Von Manstein plan as Guderian had suggested it, secondary attacks would be carried out to the southeast, in the rear of the <a href="../../../m/a/g/Maginot_Line_9eb8.html" title="Maginot Line">Maginot Line</a>, to confuse the French command. This element had been removed by Halder. Guderian now sent <a href="../../../1/0/t/10th_Panzer_Division_2d74.html" title="10th Panzer Division">10th Panzer Division</a> and <i>Großdeutschland</i> south to execute precisely such a feint attack,<sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[23]</a></sup> using the only available route south over the Stonne plateau. However the commander of the French Second Army, General Charles Huntzinger, intended to carry out at the same spot a counterattack by the armoured <i>3e Division Cuirassée de Réserve</i> to eliminate the bridgehead. This resulted in an armoured collision, both parties in vain trying to gain ground in furious attacks from 15 to 18 May, the village of Stonne changing hands many times. Huntzinger considered this at least a defensive success and limited his efforts to protecting his flank. However in the evening of 16 May Guderian removed 10 PD from the effort, having found a better destination for this division.</p>
<p>Guderian had turned his other two armoured divisions,<a href="../../../g/e/r/German_1st_Panzer_Division_b4b1.html" title="German 1st Panzer Division">1st</a> and <a href="../../../g/e/r/German_2nd_Panzer_Division_ef15.html" title="German 2nd Panzer Division">2nd</a> <i>Panzerdivision</i> sharply to the west on 14 May. On 15 May his motorised infantry dispersed in heavy fighting the reinforcements of the newly formed French 6th Army in their assembly area west of Sedan, undercutting the southern flank of the French Ninth Army by 40 km and forcing the 102nd Fortress Division to leave its positions that had blocked the tanks of XVI Army Corps at Monthermé. While the French Second Army had been seriously mauled and had rendered itself impotent, now Ninth Army began to disintegrate completely, for in Belgium also its divisions, not having had the time to fortify, had been pushed back from the river by the unrelenting pressure of German infantry, allowing the impetuous <a href="../../../e/r/w/Erwin_Rommel_b47d.html" title="Erwin Rommel">Erwin Rommel</a> to break free with his <a href="../../../g/e/r/German_7th_Panzer_Division_ac0d.html" title="German 7th Panzer Division">7th Panzer Division</a>. A French armoured division (1st DCR) was sent to block him but, advancing unexpectedly fast, he surprised it while refueling on 15 May and dispersed it, despite some losses caused by the heavy French tanks.</p>

<p>The Battle of France is often hailed as the first historical instance of the <i><a href="../../../b/l/i/Blitzkrieg.html" title="Blitzkrieg">Blitzkrieg</a></i> tactic. <i>Blitzkrieg</i> can be defined as defeating the enemy by means of a strategic envelopment executed by mechanized forces leading to operational collapse. Von Manstein certainly had had a strategic envelopment in mind. However the three dozen infantry divisions that followed the Panzer Corps were not there merely to consolidate their gains. It was to be the other way around. In the eyes of the German High Command the Panzer Corps now had fulfilled a precisely circumscribed task. Their motorized infantry component had secured the river crossings, their tank regiments had conquered a dominant position. Now <i>they</i> had to consolidate, allowing the infantry divisions to position themselves for the <i>real</i> battle: perhaps a classic <i>Kesselschlacht</i> when the enemy should stay in the north, perhaps an encounter fight when he should try to escape to the south. In both cases an enormous mass of German divisions, both armoured and infantry, would cooperate to annihilate the enemy, in accordance with established doctrine. The Panzer Corps were not to bring about the collapse of the enemy by themselves alone. They should halt.</p>
<p>On 16 May, however, both Guderian and Rommel disobeyed their explicit direct orders in an act of open insubordination against their superiors and moved their divisions many kilometers to the west, as fast as they could push them. Guderian reached <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marle%2C_Aisne_0835.html" title="Marle, Aisne">Marle</a>, 80 kilometers from Sedan; Rommel crossed the river <a href="../../../s/a/m/Sambre.html" title="Sambre">Sambre</a> at Le Cateau, a hundred kilometers from <i>his</i> bridgehead, <a href="../../../d/i/n/Dinant.html" title="Dinant">Dinant</a>. While nobody knew the whereabouts of Rommel (he had advanced so quickly that he was out of range for radio contact, earning his <a href="../../../g/e/r/German_7th_Panzer_Division_ac0d.html" title="German 7th Panzer Division">7th Panzer Division</a> the nickname <i>Gespenster-Division</i>, "Ghost Division"), an enraged <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Ludwig_Ewald_von_Kleist_ba08.html" title="Paul Ludwig Ewald von Kleist">von Kleist</a> flew to Guderian on the morning of 17 May and after a heated argument relieved him of all duties. However, von Rundstedt would have none of it and refused to confirm the order.</p>
<p>It has proven difficult to explain the actions of both generals. Rommel was forced to commit suicide by Hitler before the end of the war and thus never could clarify his behavior in full freedom. After the war, Guderian claimed to have acted on his own initiative, essentially inventing <i>Blitzkrieg</i> on the spot. Some historians have since considered this an empty boast, denying any fundamental divide within contemporaneous German operational doctrine, downplaying the conflict as a mere difference of opinion about timing and pointing out that Guderian's claim is inconsistent with his professed role as the prophet of <i>Blitzkrieg</i> even before the war. However his prewar writings in fact explicitly reject strategic envelopment by mechanized forces alone as a generally sufficient means to cause operational collapse. Also, there is no explicit reference to such tactics in the German battle plans.</p>

The German advance until May 21, 1940.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The Panzer Corps now slowed their advance considerably but had put themselves in a very vulnerable position. They were stretched out, exhausted and low on fuel; many tanks had broken down. There now was a dangerous gap between them and the infantry. A determined attack by a fresh large mechanized force could have cut them off and wiped them out.</p>
<p>The French High Command, however, was reeling from the shock of the sudden offensive and was stung by a sense of defeatism. On the morning of <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_15.html" title="May 15">15 May</a> <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prime_Minister_of_France_ab67.html" title="Prime Minister of France">French Prime Minister</a> <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Reynaud_9c43.html" title="Paul Reynaud">Paul Reynaud</a> telephoned the new <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom_dd87.html" title="Prime Minister of the United Kingdom">Prime Minister of the United Kingdom</a> <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winston_Churchill_74d2.html" title="Winston Churchill">Winston Churchill</a> and said "We have been defeated. We are beaten; we have lost the battle." Churchill, attempting to console Reynaud, reminded the Prime Minister of the times the Germans had broken through allied lines in <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_I_9429.html" title="World War I">World War I</a> only to be stopped. However, Reynaud was inconsolable.</p>
<p>Churchill flew to Paris on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_16.html" title="May 16">16 May</a>. He immediately recognized the gravity of the situation when he observed that the French government was already burning its archives and preparing for an evacuation of the capital. In a sombre meeting with the French commanders, Churchill asked General Gamelin, "Ou est la masse de manoeuvre?" ["Where is the strategic reserve?"] which had saved Paris in the <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_World_War_31c9.html" title="First World War">First World War</a>. "Aucune" ["There is none,"] Gamelin replied. Later, Churchill described hearing this as the single most shocking moment in his life. Churchill asked Gamelin when and where the general proposed to launch a counterattack against the flanks of the German bulge. Gamelin simply replied "inferiority of numbers, inferiority of equipment, inferiority of methods".<sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[24]</a></sup></p>
<p>Gamelin was right; most reserve divisions had by now been committed. The only armoured division still in reserve, 2nd DCR, attacked on 16 May. However the French armoured divisions of the Infantry, the <i>Divisions Cuirassées de Réserve</i>, were – despite their name – very specialized breakthrough units, optimized for attacking fortified positions. They could be quite useful for defense, if dug in, but had very limited utility for an encounter fight: they could not execute combined infantry–tank tactics as they simply had no important motorized infantry component; they had poor tactical mobility as the heavy <a href="../../../c/h/a/Char_B1_bis_c243.html" title="Char B1 bis">Char B1 bis</a>, their main tank in which half of the French tank budget had been invested, had to refuel twice a day. So 2nd DCR divided itself in a covering screen, the small subunits of which fought bravely – but without having any strategic effect.</p>
<p>Of course, some of the best units in the north had yet seen little fighting. Had they been kept in reserve they could have been used for a decisive counter strike. But now they had lost much fighting power simply by moving to the north; hurrying south again would cost them even more. The most powerful allied division, the 1st DLM (<i>Division Légère Mécanique</i>, "light" in this case meaning "mobile"), deployed near <a href="../../../d/u/n/Dunkirk%2C_France_b430.html" title="Dunkirk, France">Dunkirk</a> on 10 May, had moved its forward units 220 kilometers to the northeast, beyond the Dutch city of <a href="../../../27/s/-/%27s-Hertogenbosch_1463.html" title="'s-Hertogenbosch">'s-Hertogenbosch</a>, in 32 hours. Finding that the Dutch had already retreated to the north, it had withdrawn and was now moving to the south. When it would reach the Germans again, of its original 80 <a href="../../../s/o/m/SOMUA_S_35_0f59.html" title="SOMUA S 35">SOMUA S 35</a> tanks only three would be operational, mostly as a result of breakdown.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, a radical decision to retreat to the south, avoiding contact, could probably have saved most of the mechanized and motorized divisions, including the BEF. However, that would have meant leaving about thirty infantry divisions to their fate. The loss of Belgium alone would be an enormous political blow. Besides, the Allies were uncertain about German intentions. They threatened in four directions: to the north, to attack the allied main force directly; to the west, to cut it off; to the south, to occupy <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paris.html" title="Paris">Paris</a> and even to the east, to move behind the Maginot Line. The French decided to create a new reserve, among which a reconstituted 7th Army, under General Touchon, using every unit they could safely pull out of the Maginot Line to block the way to Paris.</p>
<p>Colonel <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_de_Gaulle_62f6.html" title="Charles de Gaulle">Charles de Gaulle</a>, in command of France's hastily formed 4th Armored Division, attempted to launch an attack from the south and achieved a measure of success that would later accord him considerable fame and a promotion to Brigadier General. However, de Gaulle's attacks on 17 and 19 May did not significantly alter the overall situation.</p>

<p>While the Allies did little either to threaten them or escape from the danger they posed, the Panzer Corps used 17 and 18 May to refuel, eat, sleep, and get some more tanks in working order. On 18 May Rommel made the French give up <a href="../../../c/a/m/Cambrai.html" title="Cambrai">Cambrai</a> by merely feinting an armoured attack.</p>
<p>The Allies seemed incapable of coping with events. On May 19, General <a href="../../../e/d/m/Edmund_Ironside%2C_1st_Baron_Ironside_c723.html" title="Edmund Ironside, 1st Baron Ironside">Ironside</a>, the British <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chief_of_the_Imperial_General_Staff_0c5c.html" title="Chief of the Imperial General Staff">Chief of the Imperial General Staff</a>, conferred with Gort, commander of the British Expeditionary Force at his headquarters near <a href="../../../l/e/n/Lens%2C_Pas-de-Calais_a807.html" title="Lens, Pas-de-Calais">Lens</a>. Gort reported that the Commander of the French Northern Army Group, General Billotte, had given him no orders for eight days. Ironside confronted Billotte, whose own headquarters was nearby, and found him apparently incapable of taking decisive action. Even when the powerfully built Ironside shook him by his tunic button, this produced no effect.</p>
<p>Ironside had originally urged Gort to save the BEF by attacking south-west towards Amiens. Gort replied that seven of his nine divisions were already engaged on the <a href="../../../s/c/h/Scheldt_River_eac2.html" title="Scheldt River">Scheldt River</a>, and he had only two with which to mount such an attack. Ironside returned to Britain concerned that the BEF was already doomed.</p>
<p>On the same day, the German High Command grew very confident. They determined that there appeared to be no serious threat to them from the south – indeed General <a href="../../../f/r/a/Franz_Halder_b4b0.html" title="Franz Halder">Franz Halder</a>, Chief of <a href="../../../o/b/e/Oberkommando_des_Heeres_e938.html" title="Oberkommando des Heeres">Army General Staff</a>, toyed with the idea of attacking Paris immediately to knock France out of the war in one blow. The Allied troops in the North were retreating to the river <a href="../../../e/s/c/Escaut.html" title="Escaut">Escaut</a>, their right flank giving way to the 3rd and 4th Panzer Divisions. It would be foolish to remain inactive any longer, allowing them to reorganize their defense or escape. Now it was time to bring them into even more serious trouble by cutting them off. The next day the Panzer Corps started moving again, smashed through the weak British 18th and 23rd Territorial Divisions, occupied <a href="../../../a/m/i/Amiens.html" title="Amiens">Amiens</a> and secured the westernmost bridge over the river <a href="../../../s/o/m/Somme.html" title="Somme">Somme</a> at <a href="../../../a/b/b/Abbeville.html" title="Abbeville">Abbeville</a>, isolating the British, French, Dutch, and Belgian forces in the north. In the evening of 20 May a reconnaissance unit from 2nd Panzer Division reached Noyelles, a hundred kilometers to the west. There they could see the estuary of the Somme flowing into <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_Channel_c0e5.html" title="English Channel">The Channel</a>.</p>

Situation on June 4, 1940 and actions since May 21.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>On <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_20.html" title="May 20">20 May</a> also, <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prime_Minister_of_France_ab67.html" title="Prime Minister of France">French Prime Minister</a> <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Reynaud_9c43.html" title="Paul Reynaud">Paul Reynaud</a> dismissed <a href="../../../m/a/u/Maurice_Gamelin_f500.html" title="Maurice Gamelin">Maurice Gamelin</a> for his failure to contain the German offensive, and replaced him with <a href="../../../m/a/x/Maxime_Weygand_2211.html" title="Maxime Weygand">Maxime Weygand</a>, who immediately attempted to devise new tactics to contain the Germans. More pressing however was his strategic task: he formed the Weygand Plan, ordering to pinch off the German armoured spearhead by combined attacks from the north and the south. On the map this seemed a feasible mission: the corridor through which <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Ludwig_Ewald_von_Kleist_ba08.html" title="Paul Ludwig Ewald von Kleist">von Kleist's</a> two Panzer Corps had moved to the coast was a mere 40 kilometers wide. On paper Weygand had sufficient forces to execute it: in the north the three DLM and the BEF, in the south de Gaulle's 4th DCR. These units had an organic strength of about 1,200 tanks and the Panzer divisions were very vulnerable again, the mechanical condition of their tanks rapidly deteriorating. But the condition of the Allied divisions was far worse. Both in the south and the north they could in reality muster but a handful of tanks. Nevertheless Weygand flew to <a href="../../../y/p/r/Ypres.html" title="Ypres">Ypres</a> on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_21.html" title="May 21">21 May</a> trying to convince the Belgians and the BEF of the soundness of his plan.</p>
<p>That same day, a detachment of the British Expeditionary Force under Major-General Harold Edward Franklyn had already attempted to at least delay the German offensive and, perhaps, to cut the leading edge of the German army off. The resulting <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Arras_%281940%29_66be.html" title="Battle of Arras (1940)">Battle of Arras</a> demonstrated the ability of the heavily armoured British <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matilda_tank.html" title="Matilda tank">Matilda tanks</a> (the German 37mm <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-tank.html" title="Anti-tank">anti-tank</a> guns proved ineffective against them) and the limited raid overran two German regiments. The panic that resulted (the German commander at Arras, <a href="../../../e/r/w/Erwin_Rommel_b47d.html" title="Erwin Rommel">Erwin Rommel</a>, reported being attacked by 'hundreds' of tanks, though there were only 58 at the battle) temporarily delayed the German offensive. Rommel had to rely on 88mm anti-aircraft and 105mm field guns firing over open sights to halt these attacks. German reinforcements pressed the British back to <a href="../../../v/i/m/Vimy_Ridge_03b8.html" title="Vimy Ridge">Vimy Ridge</a> the following day.</p>
<p>Although this attack was not part of any coordinated attempt to destroy the Panzer Corps, the German High Command panicked a lot more than Rommel. For a moment they feared to have been ambushed, that a thousand Allied tanks were about to smash their elite forces. But the next day they had regained confidence and ordered Guderian's XIX Panzer Corps to press north and push on to the Channel ports of <a href="../../../b/o/u/Boulogne-sur-Mer_baa6.html" title="Boulogne-sur-Mer">Boulogne</a> and <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calais.html" title="Calais">Calais</a>, in the back of the British and Allied forces to the north.</p>
<p>Also on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_22.html" title="May 22">22 May</a>, the French tried to attack south to the east of Arras, with some infantry and tanks, but by now the German infantry had begun to catch up and the attack was, with some difficulty, stopped by the 32nd Infantry Division.</p>
<p>The first attack from the south could only be launched on 24 May when 7th DIC, supported by a handful of tanks, failed to retake Amiens. This was a rather weak effort; however on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_27.html" title="May 27">27 May</a> the British 1st Armoured Division, which had been hastily brought forward from <a href="../../../e/v/r/Evrecy.html" title="Evrecy">Evrecy</a> in Normandy where it was forming, attacked Abbeville in force but was beaten back with crippling losses. The next day <a href="../../../d/e/_/De_Gaulle_5cb4.html" title="De Gaulle">de Gaulle</a> tried again with the same result. But by now even complete success couldn't have saved the forces in the north.</p>

BEF retreat at Dunkirk, from a propaganda film.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>In the early hours of 23 May Gort ordered a retreat from Arras. He had no faith in the Weygand plan nor in the proposal of the latter to at least try to hold a pocket on the Flemish coast, a <i>Réduit de Flandres</i>. The ports needed to supply such a foothold were already threatened. That day the 2nd Panzer Division assaulted Boulogne. The British garrison in Boulogne surrendered on the 25th, although 4,368 troops were evacuated. The British decision to withdraw would be much criticised in later French publications.</p>
<p>The 10th Panzer Division attacked Calais, beginning on 24 May. Reinforcements (3rd Royal Tank Regiment, equipped with <a href="../../../c/r/u/Cruiser_tank.html" title="Cruiser tank">cruiser tanks</a>, and the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_30th_Infantry_Brigade_245e.html" title="British 30th Infantry Brigade">British 30th Motor Brigade</a>) had been hastily landed 24 hours before the Germans attacked. The <a href="../../../s/i/e/Siege_of_Calais_%281940%29_4f81.html" title="Siege of Calais (1940)">Siege of Calais</a> lasted four days. The British defenders were overwhelmed, the last French troops were evacuated on 27 May.</p>
<p>While the 1st Panzer Division was ready to attack <a href="../../../d/u/n/Dunkirk%2C_France_b430.html" title="Dunkirk, France">Dunkirk</a> on 25 May, Hitler ordered it to halt on 24 May. This remains one of the most controversial decisions of the entire war. <a href="../../../h/e/r/Hermann_G%C3%B6ring_6dc0.html" title="Hermann Göring">Hermann Göring</a> had convinced Hitler the <a href="../../../l/u/f/Luftwaffe.html" title="Luftwaffe">Luftwaffe</a> could prevent an evacuation; von Rundstedt had warned him that any further effort by the armoured divisions would lead to a much prolonged refitting period. Attacking cities wasn't part of the normal task for armoured units under any operational doctrine.</p>
<p>Encircled, the British, Belgian and French launched <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Dynamo_2ab1.html" title="Operation Dynamo">Operation Dynamo</a> and <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Ariel_4b6e.html" title="Operation Ariel">Operation Ariel</a>, evacuating Allied forces from the northern pocket in Belgium and <a href="../../../p/a/s/Pas-de-Calais_0d57.html" title="Pas-de-Calais">Pas-de-Calais</a>, beginning on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_26.html" title="May 26">26 May</a> (see <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Dunkirk_eecc.html" title="Battle of Dunkirk">Battle of Dunkirk</a>). About 218,226 British troops were evacuated with 120,000 French; almost all of the latter returned to France. The Allied position was complicated by King <a href="../../../l/%C3%A9/o/L%C3%A9opold_III_of_Belgium_d61d.html" title="Léopold III of Belgium">Léopold III of Belgium</a>'s surrender the following day, which was postponed until 28 May.</p>
<p>Confusion still reigned however, as after the evacuation at Dunkirk and while Paris was enduring its short-lived siege, part of the <a href="../../../1/s/t/1st_Canadian_Infantry_Division_19fd.html" title="1st Canadian Infantry Division">1st Canadian Infantry Division</a> were sent to Brittany(Brest) and moved 200 miles inland toward Paris before they heard that Paris had fallen and France had capitulated.

The German offensive in June sealed the defeat of the French.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The best and most modern French armies had been sent north and lost in the resulting encirclement; the French had lost much of their heavy weaponry and their best armored formations. Weygand was faced with the prospect of defending a long front (stretching from <a href="../../../s/e/d/Sedan%2C_France_ec49.html" title="Sedan, France">Sedan</a> to the Channel), with a greatly depleted French Army now lacking significant Allied support. 60 divisions were required to man the 600 km long frontline, Weygand had only 64 French and one remaining British division available. Therefore, unlike the Germans, he had no significant reserves to counter a breakthrough or to replace frontline troops, should they become exhausted from a prolonged battle. Should the frontline be pushed further south, it would inevitably get too long for the French to man it. Some elements of the French leadership had openly lost heart, particularly as the British were evacuating the Continent. The Dunkirk evacuation was a blow to French morale as it was seen as an act of abandonment. Adding to this grave situation <a href="../../../i/t/a/Italy.html" title="Italy">Italy</a> declared war on France and Britain on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_10.html" title="June 10">10 June</a>.</p>
<p>The Germans renewed their offensive on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_5.html" title="June 5">5 June</a> on the Somme. An attack broke the scarce reserves that Weygand had put between the Germans and the capital, and on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_10.html" title="June 10">10 June</a> the French government fled to <a href="../../../b/o/r/Bordeaux.html" title="Bordeaux">Bordeaux</a>, declaring Paris an <a href="../../../o/p/e/Open_city.html" title="Open city">open city</a>. Churchill returned to France on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_11.html" title="June 11">11 June</a>, meeting the French War Council in <a href="../../../b/r/i/Briare.html" title="Briare">Briare</a>. The French requested Britain supply all available fighter squadrons to aid in the battle. With only 25 squadrons remaining Churchill refused, believing at this point that the decisive battle would be fought over Britain (see <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Britain_2389.html" title="Battle of Britain">Battle of Britain</a>). Churchill, at the meeting, obtained assurances from French admiral <a href="../../../f/r/a/Fran%C3%A7ois_Darlan_6dc1.html" title="François Darlan">François Darlan</a> that the fleet would not fall into German hands. On <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_14.html" title="June 14">14 June</a> Paris, the capture of which <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_Battle_of_the_Marne_df2d.html" title="First Battle of the Marne">had so eluded</a> the German Army in the <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_World_War_31c9.html" title="First World War">First World War</a>, after having been declared an <a href="../../../o/p/e/Open_city.html" title="Open city">open city</a>, fell to the <a href="../../../w/e/h/Wehrmacht.html" title="Wehrmacht">Wehrmacht</a>, marking the <a href="../../../s/i/e/Siege_of_Paris_66aa.html" title="Siege of Paris">second time</a> in less than 100 years that Paris had been captured by German forces (the former occurring during the 1870-1871 Franco-Prussian War).</p>
<p>The evacuation of the second BEF took place during <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Ariel_4b6e.html" title="Operation Ariel">Operation Ariel</a> during the 15th - 25th of June.</p>

<p>The British began to doubt Admiral Darlan's promise to Churchill not to allow the French fleet at Toulon to fall into German hands by the wording of the armistice conditions; they therefore attacked French naval forces in Africa and Europe (see <a href="../../../d/e/s/Destruction_of_the_French_Fleet_at_Mers-el-Kebir_cc0a.html" title="Destruction of the French Fleet at Mers-el-Kebir">Destruction of the French Fleet at Mers-el-Kebir</a>) which led to feelings of animosity and mistrust between the former French and British allies.</p>

<p>The great controversy of the Battle of the France focuses on causes for the catastrophic defeat suffered by the French army, and to a lesser extent, the Allies in general.</p>
<p>Some of the suggested causes of the Allied defeat were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Military factors:
<ul>
<li>Treason. This theory was very popular at the time of events. A <a href="../../../f/i/f/Fifth_column.html" title="Fifth column">fifth column</a> was supposed to be cooperating with a host of disguised German agents. After the war this was conclusively shown to have been a case of <a href="../../../m/a/s/Mass_hysteria.html" title="Mass hysteria">mass hysteria</a>, but such stories are still repeated in some popular accounts.</li>
<li>Equipment imbalances. In most ways the Allied and German armies were comparably equipped. Both had roughly the same number of tanks and motorized divisions. In armor protection and penetrating power of main armament many of the French and British tanks were actually superior to their German counterparts. While German small arms may have been somewhat superior to Allied equipment, the Allies had a significant advantage in artillery. The German advantages did not lie in having an overall better equipped army, but rather, in superior operational and tactical combat performances.</li>
<li>Defensive attitude. French overreliance on the <a href="../../../m/a/g/Maginot_Line_9eb8.html" title="Maginot Line">Maginot Line</a>, a chain of forts built along most of the Franco-German border. It is undisputed that the French left the strategic initiative to the Germans; however, the purpose of the <a href="../../../m/a/g/Maginot_Line_9eb8.html" title="Maginot Line">Maginot Line</a> was not to serve as a cover-all defense, but to force the Germans to engage French mechanized forces in the Low Countries. In this regard it was successful and served its purpose.</li>
<li>Poor strategy. General Gamelin's decision to send his best-trained and equipped forces north to defend against invasion through the <a href="../../../l/o/w/Low_Countries_e9ff.html" title="Low Countries">Low Countries</a>, combined with Hitler's decision, against the advice of the German General Staff, to adopt the Manstein plan after an aircraft that was carrying a copy of the original invasion plan crashed in Belgium due to a navigational error.</li>
<li>The totally mistaken belief by the French military that the Ardennes forest formed a barrier to a modern, mechanized army which would so slow its progress that an effective defense could be organized before a serious threat could develop (this was the case for example in the Soviet-Finnish <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winter_War_0986.html" title="Winter War">Winter War</a>). As a result the Maginot Line defenses were not extended to that region, and only second-line forces were put there.</li>
<li>Outdated tactics. It is often assumed that there was a neglect of tank warfare by the French, exemplified by the rejection of Colonel <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_de_Gaulle_62f6.html" title="Charles de Gaulle">Charles de Gaulle</a>'s tank warfare tactics by the French high command. The French had built a larger number of modern tanks than the Germans and these were on average better armed and armoured. Also it is untrue that they were divided among the infantry in "penny-packets" or even individually assigned to infantry units as support vehicles; even the independent tank battalions were combined in <i>Groupements</i> and allocated at army level. However, the French suffered from an inflexible division in infantry tanks and cavalry tanks: ironically the former were insufficiently trained to cooperate with the infantry and so couldn't execute modern combined arms tactics. In theory the operational doctrine of both armies was based on partly mechanized maneuver warfare; in practice the French shied away from it, while the best German field commanders were so bold as to let it develop into pure Blitzkrieg if the situation allowed.</li>
<li>Communication difficulties. The French communication system relied almost entirely on the public telephone network rather than two-way mobile radio used by the Germans. The telephone lines were often cut by military action (at the time sabotage was assumed) and often the only way of sending messages to the front was by dispatch rider. Allied commanders complained that they often had no information for days and when it did arrive, it was hopelessly out of date. Gamelin was criticized for making <a href="../../../c/h/%C3%A2/Ch%C3%A2teau_de_Vincennes_8d8f.html" title="Château de Vincennes">Château de Vincennes</a> his HQ, despite the fact it lacked either radio or telephone communications and relied upon motorcycle courier. However the German High Command had poor control of the battle also — although in their case it worked to their benefit.</li>
<li>Command. The German Army relied on <a href="../../../m/i/s/Mission-type_tactics.html" title="Mission-type tactics">mission-type tactics</a>, which allowed small-unit commanders to exercise a great deal of initiative in accordance with the objectives of higher headquarters. In contrast, French officers were trained to await guidance from higher headquarters before acting. This explains why the communications difficulties experienced by both sides worked to the benefit of the German Army. The German command structure passed information in both directions much faster than the French system. Combined with the high degree of initiative expected of German commanders, the result was a much faster decision cycle on the German side. French commanders repeatedly issued out-of-date orders.</li>
<li>Quality and guidance of German troops in combat. The French population was much smaller and more aged: they were forced to draft a lot of elder men to form so-called "B" (reserve) divisions, which they then could not train or staff properly as most professional instructors and officers were needed to man the "A"-divisions. These divisions were placed at positions where enemy attacks appeared unlikely, such as the Ardennes (the 55th Infantry was a "B"-division).To compensate for the lack of capability, French infantry doctrine stressed the importance of methodical procedure, leading to inflexibility. The Germans too had many insufficiently trained reserve divisions; but those infantry units used for the breakthrough all consisted of young and well-trained men. Their officers on the tactical and operational level were considered the best in the world.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_I_9429.html" title="World War I">World War I</a> and demographics
<ul>
<li>Intense French losses during World War I caused an inability for the French to regenerate the resources necessary to defend France in 1940.</li>
<li><a href="../../../d/e/m/Demographics_of_France_f210.html" title="Demographics of France">Demographics</a>. France had experienced highly atypical population growth relative to the rest of the Western world since the early 19th century. During the early 20th century, France experienced almost no population growth, while Germany's population was growing rapidly. In conjunction with France's very high casualties in WWI, this caused crippling problems for the French military. The conscripts of the French army were ideally between 20 and 25, meaning that in 1940 they had to be drawn from the generation born between 1915 and 1920. In these years the birthrate was extremely low, because of millions of French men being away from home fighting WWI. Due to the comparatively rigid (at first non-existing) French home-leave regime France was affected far worse than other European countries. The French military referred to this population-gap and its effect on the number of available conscripts in the late thirties and early forties as <i>the empty years</i>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Social and political factors:
<ul>
<li>More controversially, <a href="../../../d/e/f/Defeatism.html" title="Defeatism">defeatism</a> (or a lack of willingness to fight) among the French and particularly French leaders. This hypothesis was very popular in France itself with such books as <i>Strange Defeat</i> by <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marc_Bloch_4d3b.html" title="Marc Bloch">Marc Bloch</a>. American journalists, being neutrals at the time, observed much of this on both sides: the German populace was not enthusiastic about the war either. Most German generals were opposed to the campaign.</li>
<li>On a related issue, a number of French military and political leaders had been <a href="../../../r/e/a/Reactionary.html" title="Reactionary">reactionaries</a> hostile to the French Republic, and preferring a <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monarchy.html" title="Monarchy">monarchy</a> or an authoritarian regime in the mould of that of <a href="../../../f/r/a/Francisco_Franco_4235.html" title="Francisco Franco">Francisco Franco</a>. Many were sympathetic to the anti-<a href="../../../c/o/m/Communist.html" title="Communist">Communist</a> and <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Semitic_cf3f.html" title="Anti-Semitic">anti-Semitic</a> ideology of Nazi Germany. It would thus be no surprise if some chose not to fight the invasion, or even to collaborate with it. Many of such reactionaries in fact collaborated with the Vichy France regime, which was lauded by <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Maurras_3298.html" title="Charles Maurras">Charles Maurras</a> as a "divine surprise". However it has never been shown this supposed treacherous attitude had any meaningful impact on the outcome of the campaign.</li>
<li>Similarly, the attitude of the French Communists under <a href="../../../m/a/u/Maurice_Thorez_d1fe.html" title="Maurice Thorez">Maurice Thorez</a> had been anti-war since the signing of the <a href="../../../m/o/l/Molotov-Ribbentrop_Pact_d4d5.html" title="Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact">Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact</a> the previous year, but it is difficult to prove that this had any significant effect on the French war effort. After the <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Barbarossa_47da.html" title="Operation Barbarossa">German invasion of the Soviet Union</a> the following year, the Communists became prominent in the resistance to German occupation.</li>
