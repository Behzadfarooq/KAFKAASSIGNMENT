<p>There are opposing views about whether these two warships should be described as "battleships" or "battle-cruisers" - see discussion: <a href="../../../g/n/e/Talk%7EGneisenau_class_battlecruiser_9d6d.html" title="Talk:Gneisenau class battlecruiser">Talk:Gneisenau class battlecruiser</a>.</p>
<p>Simply speaking, the <b>pro-battleship arguments</b> appear to be 1) that's a correct translation of the German "schlachtschiffe", 2) the German builders have the right to define the classification, 3} <i>Scharnhorst</i> &amp; <i>Gneisenau</i> had all the characteristics of battleships except the main armament. The <b>pro-battlecruiser arguments</b> appear to be 1) English-language articles are not bound by German (in this case) terminology and should use terms familiar to their audience, 2) English-language authorities such as "Jane's" and the Royal Navy use the term "battlecruiser", 3) the lesser armament made the difference, 4}both ships acted as battlecruisers and could not have acted as battleships.</p>
<p>My view? We write for our audience. Use whichever description best helps the reader (in his/ her own language) and explain the dispute. <a href="../../../f/o/l/User%7EFolks_at_137_5f34.html" title="User:Folks at 137">Folks at 137</a> 19:57, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If "schlact" translated as war, then they'd "warships" and life would be much easier. We have to define them in terms of the definitions in the English wiki articles and the purpose for which they were designed and used. Their armament is too small for a battleship, their armour too heavy for a cruiser - battlecruisers were neither battleships nor cruisers - it'll do.<a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGraemeLeggett_5a1f.html" title="User:GraemeLeggett">GraemeLeggett</a> 21:12, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>They were "light battleships". The only reason they had 11 inch guns was cos the larger ones weren't ready yet. They were designed to be upgunned if needed and in fact <i>Gneisenau</i> was proceding with this. Her turrets were removed before the end of the war. Remember that battleships in WW1 sometimes had 11-inch guns also, yet they were still battleships. The main difference between battlecruisers and battleships was armor vs speed anyway, not gun size. BCs traded armor for speed - they were an evolution of armored cruisers. S/G didn't do this. Their speed was not that much faster than battleships of their time period, and their armor was not thin enough to be considered a BC. Other battleships had lighter armor and higher speed too (Iowa class for eg). "fast battleships" and "light battleships" I think are much more accurate terms than "battlecruiser". Even Hood was barely a battlecruiser when finished. I'd call the <i>Strasbourg</i> class "light battleships" also. I don't see this as a problem. You can't go by what some book says. Books say a lot of things. Janes gets things very wrong sometimes. I'd go by what Conways says perhaps. Or what the German navy (in this case) said.</dd>

<p>This article asserts that an 8" shell from Prinz Eugen hit the Hood at 06.01, causing the enormous explosion that sank the ship. This cannot be right, as Prinz Eugen had been firing at Prince of Wales for some minutes, as ordered by Lutjens after Bismarck received several hits from the British battleship. It is not disputed that the first hit Hood received was from Prinz Eugen, at about 05.56, which set off a large fire on Hood's deck. However, the majority of opinion accepts that it was a 15" hit from Bismarck that sank the battlecruiser, not a delayed reaction to the first hit she received from Prinz Eugen five minutes earlier.</p>
<p>Of course it's impossible to be certain of this fact, therefore some caution needs to be shown. Still, I don't see that there can be any doubt that it's incorrect to say that a shell from Prinz Eugen hit Hood at 06.01. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigpad_e3fc.html" title="User:Bigpad">bigpad</a> 21:15, 10 April 2006.</p>

<p>See also Captain Leach report on Hood loss: three near miss, "something hitting onboard" from Bismark at 0600. It's impossibile for an experienced seaman mistake about shell splashes: think only about shell weight, 800 kg for Bismark 15" rounds, only 120 kg for 8" Prinz Eugen. And there is absolutely no chance for a 8" shell to pierce even a two decade old 12" Hood main belt, or the thinner 178 mm secondary belt above: even the tiny 76 mm main Hood main deck armour is more than capable to defeat a 8" shell plunging from above. And you have to take into account that the shell was falling with a 50-60 degree horizontal angle, thus increasing the armour thickness. The only chance is a 15" shell, perhaps hitting aprow secondary ordnance magazine and detonating inside it, propagating fire to the adiacent main gun stern magazine and igniting propelling charges rather than shells. Even the survivors onboard Hood tells about a not-so-strong detonation or large shock wave, which is what you expects form launch explosives, prone to "burn" rather than "explode". Only after charge ignition and flash propagation in the rear part of the ship, including boiler and engine rooms you had a real "explosion" that smashed hull, sides and all produced structural collapse. According to my opinion it's much more important to speculate about the French veteran dreadnought "Bretagne", older and more unarmoured than "Hood", that survived a magazine direct hit from British fleet in Norther Africa. Why she did not exploded, while "Hood" did&#160;?</p>

<p>There is patently a dispute over whether or not to link to the <a href="../../../b/i/s/Bismarck_Chase_6fff.html" title="Bismarck Chase">Bismarck Chase</a>.

<li>I think it's very important that this article mentions the final days of the Bismarck somehow, either by linking to that article or somewhere else. Currently the 'Aftermath' section reads very strangely as it does not mention the final fate of the ship. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDave_w74_4583.html" title="User:Dave w74">Dave w74</a> 08:16, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Bismarck Chase is no longer titled that on the page itself. Someone has renamed it "Last battle of the battleship Bismarck." Neither of these titles explains that the ship was sunk. The Sinking of the Bismarck is now a mere subhead in the Bismarck Chase, found halfway down the page without even a table of contents at the top to give the reader a clue that it is buried in the story. Instead, it should be the title of the page, and of the link to it. -- In the Battle of the Denmark Strait article, a new short section called Pursuit and Sinking of the Bismarck should be added before the Aftermath section. It would briefly summarize the chase and sinking, and link to the renamed Sinking of the Bismarck article (at the Bismarck_Chase URL unless a new Sinking_of_the_Bismarck URL is desirable to redirect from that). Then the Aftermath section would wrap up what happened after the sinking. -- If this is acceptable, I would be happy to make these revisions, which should make things flow more sensibly for the reader. <a href="../../../r/s/t/User%7ERstevec_db19.html" title="User:Rstevec">Rstevec</a> 11:24, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>The "someone" to whom <a href="../../../r/s/t/User%7ERstevec_db19.html" title="User:Rstevec">Rstevec</a> refers is me. I am sorry that you are not happy with my solution to the problem of the <i>Bismarck Chase</i> article; I can at least assure you that it was not adopted lightly. Before rescoping and renaming the article, I posted my intentions to the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Military_history_Maritime_warfare_task_force_a55a.html" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Military history/Maritime warfare task force">Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Military history/Maritime warfare task force</a> page, as well as to the <a href="../../../o/p/e/Talk%7EOperation_Rhein%C3%BCbung_c13a.html" title="Talk:Operation Rheinübung">Talk:Operation Rheinübung</a> and the talk page of the article page itself. I was remiss in not posting here as well. This produced quite a lot of discussion, including a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Last_battle_of_the_battleship_Bismarck#Rescope_and_rename.3F" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Last_battle_of_the_battleship_Bismarck#Rescope_and_rename.3F" rel="nofollow">poll of possible titles</a>. As a matter of fact, <i>Sinking of the Bismarck</i> was my own first suggestion for a name; in the end, I opted for a title which - so I thought - was more neutral and more closely described the content of the article (not least because <i>Bismarck</i> was not the only ship sunk as a result of the battle). With regard to Graeme's original question, I suggest that <b>Aftermath</b> should link to <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Rhein%C3%BCbung_c3a4.html" title="Operation Rheinübung">Operation Rheinübung</a>, which already contains a brief summary of the <i>Bismarck's</i> loss. Can I suggest, if people are unhappy with the way things are now, that we carry this discussion across the to <a href="../../../l/a/s/Talk%7ELast_battle_of_the_battleship_Bismarck_e60f.html" title="Talk:Last battle of the battleship Bismarck">Talk:Last battle of the battleship Bismarck</a>?
