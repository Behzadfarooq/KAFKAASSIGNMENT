<p>This is a very nice start, with a good degree of detail. I applaud your ability to remain objective and neutral in writing this; it is a very hard thing to do, considering the subject matter. The infobox needs a little work- the casualties do not seem very well organized, and there is a hanging phrase of "Israel claims..." But I am quite aware this is a work in progress, as it is a current event. For an event so well reported and published, I think a lot more could probably be said, which is why I'm giving it only a "Start" rating. Thank you again, though, for your hard work, and for writing this in such a neutral way. <a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELordAmeth_30dd.html" title="User:LordAmeth">LordAmeth</a> 00:03, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've put the result of the battle as "town held by Hezbollah", which I believe is what the sources say. The word "stalemate" is unacceptably vague and not even appropriate given that Israel has withdrawn. This is not to suggest that Israel has "lost" according to its goals: the casualties are of course listed separately. —<a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshley_Y_1ca2.html" title="User:Ashley Y">Ashley Y</a> 05:51, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Why is the article only mentioning the IDF estimation of casualities, Hezbollah announced that 13 IDF soldiers were killed in the battle. According to israeli sources, most of the israelis tend to believe Nassralla's statements.The Israeli sources are estimating Hezbolla's losses ranges from 15-200&#160;!! I believe this implies uncertainity, or even more, intentional exaggeration for morale boosting purposes, especially after IDF had to withdraw from the town (why would they do that if they killed 200 out of 200 Hezbolla fighters).</p>
<p>--12:52, 31 July 2006 (UTC)Suspicous</p>
<p>According to what israeli sources "most of the israelis tend to believe Nassralla's statements"? This is absolutely ridiculous. Hezbollah never published their real losses, but in ames of propaganda. Israeli losses published with names of soldiers and their photos. <a href="../../../s/h/m/User%7EShmuliko_9728.html" title="User:Shmuliko">Shmuliko</a> 06:16, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>i meant that threats made by Hezbolla are taken seriously on the other side, this can be quoted from Israeli officials responses to Nasralla's statements. As to "Hezbollah never published their real losses" how can you be so sure, Hezbolla is announcing the names of its fallen on Manar TV, what am saying is that both sides are trying to under mine there losses &amp; increase the other's so we shouldn't take israeli figures for granted especially when no independent press is able to enter the fighting area.</p>
<p>Shmuliko don't talk about something you don't know; Hizbollah not only published names of those who died (during the whole conflict on Al Manar TV) but also organised military funerals for most of them. weeks ago, they broadcasted video tapes of those who died during the war talking to their families, children and friends.</p>

<p>hizballa lost most of it's force in the area, and in the end of the battle itself, the town was compleatly under the control of the IDF. the IDF widrew its forces because it's job was done, not because hizballa still controlled the area. this is no "strategic victory", this is a tie.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, STRATEGIC because they still control the town--<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheFEARgod_b418.html" title="User:TheFEARgod">TheFEARgod</a> 15:43, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This is silly. Firstly, is there any reference that says the "the town was completely under the control of the IDF"? Secondly, "strategic victory" etc. is POV. I'm changing it back to the plain fact of Hezbollah hold. —<a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshley_Y_1ca2.html" title="User:Ashley Y">Ashley Y</a> 17:48, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

A strategic victory is one that accomplishes your goals the: Hezbollah goal was aparently to retain control of the town, something they acomplished. Also the perceived victory gives the Hezbollah forces a Large morale boost. Tacticaly it was indesicisive as neither force clearly defeated the other, and no major media outlets have reported that the Hezbollah forces at the town were virtualy destroyed. --72.145.144.254 20:24, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Additionally the latest casualty counts are provided by MSNBC in the latest source and it says 18 so stop reverting.--72.145.144.254 20:26, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I haven't touched the casualty counts. Israel can also claim this as a "strategic victory", it's entirely POV. The plain fact of the result is that Hezbollah held the town, everything else is interpretation. —<a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshley_Y_1ca2.html" title="User:Ashley Y">Ashley Y</a> 21:18, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>“Strategic victory” refers to the accomplishment of one’s goals. at the start of the campaign the Israeli goal was the destruction of the Hezbollah forces in the area and possibly the capture of the town, Nether of these were accomplished by the point of Israelis withdrawal, While Hezbollah as stated above accomplished their goals: the retention of the town and the preservation of their forces. (Although taking more casualties than Israel in the process). Finally the terms Tactical Victory&amp; Strategic Victory are the correct and formal terms used by military annalists.--72.145.154.203 21:58, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Strategic victory</b> is one that turns the war scenario. It is not the case. IDF cleaned the territory and kept the positions on controlling heights. That is exactly what they do in every village they enter. Today there no Hezbollah forces in the town and it is not their victory, however IDF has casualities, which is main Hezbollah aim. I'll remove the <b>strategic vctory</b>. <a href="../../../s/h/m/User%7EShmuliko_9728.html" title="User:Shmuliko">Shmuliko</a> 06:26, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><i>NO single news post says that the teritory was cleaned they only mention a Hezbollah ambush and a IDF retreat, also the town is reported by all major news services to be under the control of Hezbollah, so none of the above you mentioned are true.</i></p>

<p>Btw: strategic does not mean turning-point, it just represents the acomplisment or faliure of goals--72.145.143.215 14:53, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hezbollah is a guerilla and that the town are still held by hezbollah are more than victory</p>
<p><br />
Saying israel won the war is completely idiotic, israel declared a list of objectives before the war and failed to reach any of them, the two soldiers are still captured, hizbollah still have rockets (at least until the last day of the war) and hizbollah is still armed and well popular. therefore, hizbollah won this war.196.203.167.198 16:53, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Unlike the Hezballa, IDF reports are official. When IDF says the were 8 israeli casualties and 22 wounded, it means that.</p>
<p>By the way, there were 2 israeli casualties around Bint Jbeil during the night before the battle of Bint Jbeil - this is official.</p>

<p>C'mon... I don't need MSNBC to know how many israeli soldiers got killed there... Find some more sources (NOT Hezbollah sources) talking abount 18 dead israeli soldiers in Bint Jbeil... 89.0.211.46 21:49, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>These aren't Hezbollah sources! they are <a href="../../../m/s/n/MSNBC_69dc.html" title="MSNBC">MSNBC</a> sources and paragraph 22 shows an official Israel body count. additionally by wikipedia rules and procedures this (MSNBC) Is a reliable source and more recent than the one you provided, so it supercedes it. --72.145.154.203 21:54, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think the problem is in the definitions: 18 Israeli soldiers died in the Bint Jbeil area: 2+5 in Maroun A Ras the day before, 1 in the same day in Maroun A-Ras, 2 in the night before, in the area. For some Israeli sources, probably the ones relied on by news sources, all these casualties are in Bint Jbeil (note that the sources talk about "five days of fighting". The casualty question can be sorted out if you decided whether the Battle is the entire five days or just the one day of fighting in the town itself. <a href="../../../m/2E/_/User%7EM._Butterfly_a782.html" title="User:M.

<p>I don't understand why the focus of a single battle event. This cannot be considered as a battle which is over. The Battle for Bint Jbail is not over. Israel is using a tactic against a guerrila advantage. Israel prefers to conduct search and destroy operations in the villages then withdraw. Why remain inside and be a target against an enemy who knows all the passageways, tunnels and bunkers. All you is inviting yourself to be a target of an anti-tank missile by remaining in one position too long. What Israel is doing is, fighting, killing and wounding some Hezbollah's then withdrawing. If they attempt to reinforce their dwindling numbers inside Bint Jbeil, they get attacked. If they try to withdraw they run the risk of attacks. If they stay put, they are a target for the next search and destroy incursion. So I don't think you cannot categorize this as a victory for Hezbollah, unless of course there is a cease-fire and they still hold the town and are not forced to withdraw or disarm. Until then, I categorize this battle as ongoing. Richardmiami 15:15, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>As we can see from this news dispatch: "IDF forces operating in the south Lebanese town of Bint Jbeil spotted five Hizbullah cells on their way to launch anti-tank missiles; the soldiers opened fire and struck the gunmen." (source: <a href="http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3286360,00.html" class="external free" title="http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3286360,00.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3286360,00.html</a>)</p>
<p>The IDF is still coming in and out of the village. The Battle is still ongoing. I believe that the final decision of victory will be, who is in control after a cease-fire is declared and what consequences it brings (e.g. Hezbolllah withdrawal from village replaced by International monitors, or Hezbollah control despite cease-fire). Richardmiami 17:06, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>then create a new tactical battle article we could use the 2nd battle of Bint Jbeil, as a new article. it can be handeled like the fallujah battles were,--72.145.156.233 20:15, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Richard, the IDF announced from the beggining that their aim is to totally destroy Hezboll's fighting power, by the end of this war, if Hezbolla still have fighting capabilities this will only mean one thing, the israelis lost the battle.. this is what happens when you set a high ceiling without being sure of the ability to acheive it, note that Nasralla was aware of that fact &amp; thats why he stated that ( we don't claim to be able to stop Israeli invasion but we promise to inflict damages on them wherever they go), so far that is exactly what Hezbolla is doing. As for the tactics used by IDF, what you said about killing some hezbolla fighters then withdrawing is incorrect, lets not forget that in every engagement so far both sides are having casualities, &amp; i believe this have more influence upon the israelis..the main reason IDF invaded Bint jbeil was because they suspected that Katyushas are being fired from there &amp; they wanted to stop that, the only way to do it is to keep the town in IDF control. Their failure to acheive that so far is the reason this was considered a defeat to the israeli army, else what is the use of controlling a village, losing a dozen soilders while doing so, then evacuating it so that Hezbolla fighters can go back in and launch some more missiles..--213.42.2.21 12:23, 9 August 2006 (UTC)The man who sold the world</p>
<p>I have to agree with Richard, Isreal has stated that it has no intention to re-occupy southern Lebernam and has just stated that it will expand its opperations, Isreal is capturing areas, dismantaling Hezbollah infestructa and then leaving. It has no intention of controling the village in the long term. --88.108.217.33 16:57, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>You have to keep in mind this is not a traditional war between 2 armies where the victor is the side who gained more land, this is a guerilla war where all rules are changed, . Guerilla's can declare they won the war by acheiving the purpose behind it, Hezbolla had the right to declare a victory in 2000 cause their stated purpose was isareli withdrawal of the south. In the same manner IDF can claim victory if it acheived its goals from the operation, what exactly did it acheive in bint jbeil especially after withdrawing from the town. Engaging with Hezbolla in a close range battle is surely not an acheivment, suffering casualities is also a set back, if we accepted the Israeli backing of their frist accounced goal which was total destruction of Hezbolla to their second declared goal which is holding the land until multinational force arrive, then again they failed to do so since they withdrawed before they can handle it to the multinational force..even in their subsequent wide offensive in which they drove several kms into south lebanon, you can't state that they have controlled the land which they have taken since pockets of resistence is still costing them even greater losses than before. At the end of the war both sides will declare victory, Hezbolla will argue that israelis released lebanese prisoners &amp; withdrawed from lebanese lands, israelis will state that Hezbolla will no longer target north israel with Katyushas. but come to think of it, Hezbolla offered to stop launching katyushas if israel stops its assault, yep..total mess..but in all, Hezbolla gained respect in the arab world for holding against such an assault, while the IDF lost some credibility for not being able to vanquish an enemy outnumbered 15 to 1 and lacking for air, naval &amp; ground power. I don't think these are results Israel was hoping for.</p>

<p>I have added a NPOV tag. Nearly all of the sources are from Israeli media sources. There seems to be disagreement among editors as to certain facts and timelines.

<dd>proper procedure is to discuss any charges of non-NPOV edits on Talk, and tag the article only if there is no consensus on how to arrive at NPOV on Talk. I have thus reverted your drive-by tagging. Now that we are discussing your actual points: (1) The references include arab sources such as Al Jezeera and Al bawab, as well as numerous non-israeli and non-Arab sources, such as The Guardian, CNN and Reuters. So the claim that "Nearly all of the sources are from Israeli media sources" is false. (2) There is (or rather, was) some disagreement with regards to some facts, but that is common to most WP articles, and there have only been 2 edits yesterday, and not many more than that the previous 4 days. If you have any specific issues with edits that you claim to be non-NP0V, let's hear them, but tagging an entire article based on the fact that there is some disagrement over facts is over the top. <a href="../../../i/s/a/User%7EIsarig_bbf7.html" title="User:Isarig">Isarig</a> 01:11, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>With all due respect, I don't think I'm being disruptive. The fist article, from 19 August, does not state that there are no Hezbollah fighters in Bint Jbeil. This news article, which I actually used to source another statement in the Bint Jbeil article, states that there are no Israeli soldiers in Bint Jbeil, and that the United Nations in fact controls the twon. The September 3 article does not mention whether Hezbollah fighters are still in Bint Jbeil.

<dd>No, that is far from clear. They can be deadly elswhere, or deadly from afar. To jump from a statement such as '"Hezbollah's fighters remain as deadly as they are elusive." to the conclusion that Bint Jbeil is still in Hizbolah hands is Original Research, and has no place in WP. No one was claiming the Hezbollah fighters were eradicated to the last man, so clearly those that remain are deadly. But the article clearly states they are nowhere to be seen in BJ. Extraordinary claims require extarordinary proof - this article, described by as you vague" does not even come close.

<dd>Isarig is correct. The source says nothing about them being present - which is in fact not true. They weren't. This should be deleted immediately. <a href="../../../a/m/o/User%7EAmoruso_6245.html" title="User:Amoruso">Amoruso</a> 05:39, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I removed the recent edit which reaqd "New Israeli reports revealed that after the IDF failed to capture Bint Jbeil, army leaders requested several soldiers to take pictures showing the Israeli flag on top of a house in the town; several soldiers were killed by Hezbollah fighters while attempting to carry out the order.". This is sourced to IMEMC - which is not a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, and partisan in nature. The information is dubious for several reasons: (1) the article claimes it is based on "IMEMC &amp; Agencies" - but a google search on relevant items (e.g. the named soldier "Eyal Bloom") yeilds zero hits. (2) The Israeli enquiry commision has not yet issued its report, making the source of this alleged "report" questionable. <a href="../../../i/s/a/User%7EIsarig_bbf7.html" title="User:Isarig">Isarig</a> 04:27, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi Isarig, <a href="../../../i/m/e/IMEMC_dda5.html" title="IMEMC">IMEMC</a> is a reliable independent source, why is it not RS?. &lt;restored BintJbeil's edit&gt; <b><a href="../../../n/i/e/User%7ENielswik_fd59.html" title="User:Nielswik">Nielswik</a></b><sub><a href="../../../n/i/e/User_talk%7ENielswik_2384.html" title="User talk:Nielswik">(talk)</a></sub> 09:58, 28 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It is self published. It is explictly partisn and one sided. And as noted above, the recent claim is dubious and appears nowhere else in a mainstream media source. <a href="../../../i/s/a/User%7EIsarig_bbf7.html" title="User:Isarig">Isarig</a> 15:00, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
