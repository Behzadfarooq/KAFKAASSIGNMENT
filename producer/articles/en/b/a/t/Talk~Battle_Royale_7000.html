<p>"The students are also given a time limit. If twenty-four hours pass without someone killing someone, then all of the collars will be detonated simultaneously and there will be no winner (in the movie, the students have 3 days or the collars will go off). It is later mentioned by Shogo Kawada that only 0.5% of Programs end in this fashion (though this is mathematically impossible, as there have only been 49 battles to gather data from, and 0.5% implies "out of 200")".</p>
<p>In the novel, there are fifty class selected each year, 47 per year prior to 1950, which means that there have been approximately 2441 Program run-throughs since it's institution (making the assumption that Shiroiwa is the first class of 1997 to participate in the Program). A 0.5% chance of a "time out" would suggest that roughly 12 Programs have ended in this way. User: Satyriasis 25/09/06</p>

<p>I believe an issue we'll be running into is that there are enough significant differences between the novel and the film that there'll be a lot of "in the novel, this, but in the film, that" to contend with, to the point that it would make this entry unwieldy. I realize that there are some cons as well as pros to this, but a separate entry for the film should be considered.</p>

<dd>Greetings! As a member of WikiFilm who's currently involved in cleaning up film and book articles, I urge you to go ahead and separate the film and the book into different articles. To heck with the wikic***s. As someone has said, it gets unwieldy and confusing to try to cover both media in one article.

<dd>I agree - they should be split asap - For a precedent see what was done with <a href="../../../s/o/l/Solaris_%28novel%29.html" title="Solaris (novel)">Solaris</a> and the various film adaptations. Hell things like <a href="../../../v/_/f/V_for_Vendetta_%28film%29_84d8.html" title="V for Vendetta (film)">V for Vendetta (film)</a> and <a href="../../../f/r/o/From_Hell_%28film%29_2ae3.html" title="From Hell (film)">From Hell (film)</a> get their own separate entries so I really don't think there will be a problem with this. If the guy proposing it doesn't feel confident about doing it then I'll sort it out - message me. I'll check back in a few weeks and if no one has raised any good objections I'll do it.

<dd>Agree. This should be split, possibly three ways - novel, film, and manga, with sections indicating where they coincide and differ. Right now the article is a mess, particularly the descriptions of the plot and characters, which are all jumbled and incoherant due to the differences between the novel/manga and film. This needs to be fixed sharpish. <a href="../../../a/d/d/User%7EAddyboy_ebcd.html" title="User:Addyboy">addy</a> 15:44, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>A split is nearly needed for this sort of thing. The movie, book, and film are all different enough to warrant a new article, especially the latter portion of the manga, which is different in many aspects to both other versions. The movie also branches off quite a bit from the others. Zelosaurion 00:48, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It just hasn't been released here in the U.S. yet. I find this rather odd, since it enjoys quite a bit of popularity among cult-cinema fans here. The novel was even published in an English translation a year ago. Also, I should point out that it's almost impossible for a film to get banned here (even huge nasties like <i><a href="../../../s/a/l/Sal%C3%B2_o_le_120_giornate_di_Sodoma_5757.html" title="Salò o le 120 giornate di Sodoma">Salo</a></i> aren't illegal in most states). <a href="../../../n/e/c/User%7ENeckro_8bdb.html" title="User:Neckro">neckro</a> 12:13, 27 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>According to the Battle Royale official website the reason it was never released was that the company that made it in Japan wants far too much money for it. The number is in the multi-millions just for the rights to release it. None of the big name American distributors want it for that much and any small company that does doesn't have the money. It has never been officially banned by the US government or anyone else. I personally have a copy that is in Korean with English subtitles that I bought off Ebay. JesusSaves 20:55, 24 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I don't see why people can't just buy a version of Battle Royale out of Japan or E-Bay, and switch it to English subtitles. That's how many people prefer to watch japanese movies and anime. You can't tell me that you'd rather watch <i>Ju-On</i> with the English language translation on. Voice overs are pure horror. Trance 10:30, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Meh, I think a lot of it is that it makes evangelizing difficult. How do you tell people to go and watch the movie if the only way to acquire it is to order it as an import, or find a very obscure video shop who has it? -<a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESeanDuggan_af73.html" title="User:SeanDuggan">Fuzzy</a> 17:34, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Trance, there has never been a dubbed version of the film, aside from the heavily criticised and butchered German version, and probably never will be. What everyone else is saying that it would be better if it were on general release in American video stores. As a Brit I've got easy access to it and it would be good if Americans did too. addy (but cant be bothered logging in, yet again) 14.55 24 March 2006</dd>

<p>I haven't actually seen any versions, but reading the artichle, I feel it should be split into several artichles, or at least have one "main" version used for desciption, with differences shown somewhere else in the artichle. I have no idea if this is how you comment.</p>

<p>I went ahead and modified the film cast list--I thought the previous one looked very IMDB-ish, and the Special Version and minor characters combined with the students themselves can be very confusing. I separated the students from the minor/other characters, and the additional characters from the Special Version.</p>
<p>Oh, and I'm all for doing a new page for the Manga and Novel, as most of its content/premise's completely different from the movie. Same goes for the character page--some character's traits in the movie are completely different from the novel/manga (ex. Keita Iijima, Hiroki Sugimura) --Dreweid 11:43, 27 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'd call an NPOV here. He's got a good point about how the lighthouse scene doesn't translate well, but the way he states it makes it sound like it's a cultural fault that American viewers "don't get it." I'm not making an edit on it right now, because I'm not sure if I'm seeing things that aren't there. Opinions? Maybe we could add a section for it along the lines of "Reasons for non-acceptance in American markets" or "Errors in translation"? -<a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESeanDuggan_af73.html" title="User:SeanDuggan">Fuzzy</a> 16:15, 1 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>That was not the intent. In Japanese society you can hear many people using these polite terms and words that the girls started off using and it's almost a cliche that they do so (and out of place in the movie at that point). Similarly the rough words they use later are typical of tough-guy movies and I don't recall off the top of my head, but I believe they were almost vulgar. It was quite entertaining in a satirical sense but I too had to watch the lighthouse scene twice as first time through I was distracted by the sub-titles which seemed outrageously inept, however you could pick up the general feel in the girls' intonation as well. Although I do not live in the U.S., I rather thought that speculation as to the reasons for its long period of not being released in the U.S. was of encylopaedic value and that if one were to want to get the most out of it whether it got a bad review or a good one, it was important to realize the nature of the satire and its subtlety (or just difference) in Japanese in the lighthouse scene. It is obvious from my choice of words that the comments are coming from outside the U.S., but other than that, was there anything particularly incorrect? Since I do understand some Japanese, I found the lighthouse scene something close to astonishing, but that's POV, isn't it. -Author of change [I find this movie too controversial to want to sign my wiki id at this point] 1 Feb 2005</p>
<p>{nods} Honestly, I agree with you about the lighthouse scene. Again, I don't speak Japanese, but the combination of the tones of voices and then the subtitles, it made sense. I particularly liked how the lighting at the beginning was cheerful and bright, then got more dim as they started into their fight. As for the reasons for the movie not being distributed in the US, I was going to say that the reasons for it were clearly documented in the article, but I now see they aren't.

<p>I'm curious... what exactly is the distinction here? Are they changing the dialogue? The artwork? Or is this something which never existed in Japanese format and is being released in English because mangas are "in" currently? -<a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESeanDuggan_af73.html" title="User:SeanDuggan">Fuzzy</a> 19:39, 11 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Keith Giffin apparently made a number of changes to the plot and dialogue, which is why it is being referred to as an adaptation rather than a straight translation. Manga/anime fan definitely pay attention to the distinction. A translation is a translation - no alterations whatsoever (except for obvious tweaks required for grammar and sentence structure). From what I understand, the difference is not as great as, say, the Japanese vs. American versons of <i>Sailor Moon</i>, but they are there. I have read the original novel, but not any sort of straight translation of the Manga (only the Giffen version), but maybe someone out there who can read Japanese can describe the changes in detail. As far as I can tell the plot is pretty much the same as the book, so Giffen's changes might be more dialogue-related. I do know he spells Shuya's name Shuuya in his adaptation for some reason. Also, there is explicit sexual content in the book, and presumably changes had to be made for legal reasons since in the original storyline the characters are all 15-16-17 years of age, and it's not legal to have nudity and sexual situations involving minors in an American publication (this is of particular concern with the character of Mitsuko). <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 20:28, 11 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Keith's changes are mostly in dialogue. He used his own judgement for which lines of dialogue sounded "too bland" for a comic. For example, in the scene where Mitsuko slits another competitor's throat while she (the competitor) hugs her under the assumption she's not out to kill her, and gushes blood over the entire room,definitely in the original version she said "I had to kill you before you killed me" in the American edition of the manga she says "Red is definitely not your color". <a href="../../../k/i/l/User%7EKillridemedly_d5b5.html" title="User:Killridemedly">killridemedly</a> 16:43, 13 June 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm not an expert, but I believe the US Supreme court overturned the ban on minors being portrayed as having sex a few years back. The law was too vague, and, as one Justice noted, logically it would have prohibited movies like <i>Titanic</i> and other works of fiction exploring teenage sexuality.</dd>
<dd>Shuya was changed to Shuuya to indicate the long "u" sound in Japanese.</dd>

<dd>Giffen's most egregious (at least in the eyes of some fans, myself included) change to the manga consists of presenting the story as if it were a "reality show"--none of the Japanese versions have this element (only the announcement of the winner is televised; in Battle Royale II the rounding up of the students is a major press event, but that's because it was a unique situation), and, more importantly, the original Japanese manga doesn't have it. Characters are talking about being on TV and being part of the show when there are clearly no cameras following them.</dd>

<p>I noticed that a lot of really critical plot points are given away, it seems like a book like this, that relies so much on tension, should probably have a much shorter (if any) plot synopsis.</p>

<dd>Knowing what the story involves as a whole by it self could be considered a bit of a spoiler itself - I was lucky enough to have been introduced to the movie with no prior knowledge of what it was about, and it had a lot more impact because of that, and now that I have the DVD I tend to lend it to people with the cover turned inside out so they can enjoy it in that manner as well. But that's quite a particular case, so perhaps a simple relocation of the spoiler warning would be enough. <a href="../../../l/o/o/User%7ELoona_9ca2.html" title="User:Loona">Loona</a> 16:32, 13 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree with Loona. I also saw this film having never heard of it (I watched it a film night with a friend, and it was his suggestion at first I thought it was a martial arts film based on the title!) which I loved - I didnt realise the importance of certain characters for example for a long time into it. But I don't see any reason why there shouldn't be a synopsis - any is a spoiler of sorts, which is most unlike films generally, but then again, Wikipedia is an encyclopedia and as such must have some sort of plot descriptor present. I don't read them for films I've yet to see, I generally just read the overview at the top of the article to find out what I need. As such I don't mind seeing every little detail of the plot described - I actually like to read that. So as long as the spoiler tag is present right at the top of the plot synopsis I see no reason not to keep it. <a href="../../../a/d/d/User%7EAddyboy_ebcd.html" title="User:Addyboy">addy</a> 16:01, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm admittedly unsure on this issue - Battle Royale, at least in the original book and manga versions, has quite a bit of character development, and as a whole even works as a metaphor for a competitive society, so developing on each of the more proeminent characters and certain scenes would make some sense to an extent. However, such development should cover at least a handful of character in the actual BR article before they'd move on to the actual pages pages of their own. The problem with Kiriyama is that the movie version (in it for kicks, pretty much a sadist - an outsider who's death on legs, no other purpose beyond twisted "fun") is radically different from the other ones (practically a cold, calculating machine with an almost super-human ability for learning and improvising - doing what he's told with little to no question with maximum efficiency, and he was in the same class as all the others all of the time) - this makes a world of a difference in the more symbolic meaning the story can have, since while movie Kiriyama can be seen as a plot device, the original book version can be an extreme example of what distant employers may want from their employees, for example. Suggestions for other character-based articles that could be included associated with the BR article, either in or outside it: <a href="../../../h/i/r/Hiroki_Sugimura_69da.html" title="Hiroki Sugimura">Hiroki Sugimura</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/t/Mitsuko_Souma_5a83.html" title="Mitsuko Souma">Mitsuko Souma</a>, <a href="../../../s/h/o/Shogo_Kawada_ffff.html" title="Shogo Kawada">Shogo Kawada</a>, <a href="../../../y/u/k/Yuko_Sakaki_ee97.html" title="Yuko Sakaki">Yuko Sakaki</a>. <a href="../../../l/o/o/User%7ELoona_9ca2.html" title="User:Loona">Loona</a> 16:32, 13 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>I agree. Instead of merging the articles, the main characters should be expanded into articles of their own. <a href="../../../s/a/b/User%7ESaberwyn_4405.html" title="User:Saberwyn">Saberwyn</a> 00:16, 20 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I'm of two minds on this. Certainly notable characters in TV series have their own articles, as well as recurring characters in, say, the <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Bond_c2aa.html" title="James Bond">James Bond</a> books. But whether characters who appear in only one venue (be it the manga, novel, or movie) justify their own separate articles, I don't know.

<dd>
<ul>
<li>I think that guideline was the one about characters that are referred to in other media - in that case a separate article was reccomended, as the character's supposed to be famous enough to be referred outside its own fictional world. Can anyone think of any such case regarding Kiriyama? <a href="../../../l/o/o/User%7ELoona_9ca2.html" title="User:Loona">Loona</a> 09:45, 21 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Possibly. Certainly he is iconic, although until the film gets a general American release (if that ever happens) he will remain a cult figure only, much like the other characters. However, I would certainly not oppose the creation of articles for the main 7 or so: Shuya, Noriko, Kawada and Kazuo as has been done, Mitsuko, and maybe Hiroki, Chigusa, Utsemi, and one page for the three teacher characters (film: Kitano, novel: Sakamochi, manga: Kamon). The latter could certainly be of relevance. Yuko however does not deserve a seperate page. However, I do think this article needs a page for the rest of the characters - as for many TV shows etc (see <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Simpsons_c2a9.html" title="The Simpsons">The Simpsons</a> for one example), perhaps a page each for the major characters, such as those I listed, and one other page for everyone else, with each character getting a section. <a href="../../../a/d/d/User%7EAddyboy_ebcd.html" title="User:Addyboy">addy</a> 13:32, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Although I too have heard that BR is unavailable in the US (and Canada) due to the rights issues, that doesn't explain why Tower Records in Los Angeles and HMV Records in Edmonton both stocked the Directors Edition this past summer ... and neither chain carries bootlegs (or, grey area Hong Kong imports, either). Maybe there's a loophole somewhere? <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 02:41, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>What version do they have? As a regular on 2 of the main BR forums on the net, I know that there are several versions of this about (I live in the UK so can only speculate - its available freely here). Most likely it is the Korean version - that is what NetFlix commonly has. Is it that? There is nothing to stop shops importing this film by the way - it just won't get a general distribution any time soon. User:addyboy (but cant be bothered signing in) 23.08, 10 January 2006</p>

<dd>I have yet to get my hands on a copy of the Director's Edition, however I did recently obtain a "grey area" Hong Kong import listed a Special Edition that contains both films. Only problem is there are no English subtitles but fortunately I'm quite familiar with the plot of the book so it's not too hard to follow the story, even with adjustments. Actually, not understanding the dialogue it actually seems to follow the books a lot more closely. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 06:56, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This would appear to be one of the many bootlegs of this film circulating. I see no reason why a shop in American could not import one of these, or a legitimate version of the film and sell it - there is nothing to stop them doing that, it is just that there never was a general distribution.

<dd>Sounds good to me - if someone comes along and really objects to it then they can alway swap the novel page to <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_Royale_%28novel%29_679d.html" title="Battle Royale (novel)">Battle Royale (novel)</a> and then move the disambiguation page here. That would be the work of moments - the work is in splitting it all up so there is the flexibility to do this.

<dd>I disagree. While the novel came out first, the movie is more popular and widespread. I'd wager that most people doing a search for it on wikipedia are looking for the movie. I vote that <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_Royale_c884.html" title="Battle Royale">Battle Royale</a> be changed to the disambiguation page, while <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_Royale_%28novel%29_679d.html" title="Battle Royale (novel)">Battle Royale (novel)</a> takes its place.

<p>I've split the film from this page as much as I could, taking out the "Film" and "Remake" sections along with some external links and categories that only dealt with the film. The new link is <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_Royale_%28film%29_b208.html" title="Battle Royale (film)">Battle Royale (film)</a>.

<dd>Good work. I have split off the manga and done some tidying (like removing the split tags and adding in a link to the disambiguation page). When its looking tidier I'll edit the information into the bottom template. (<a href="../../../e/m/p/User%7EEmperor_dcf0.html" title="User:Emperor">Emperor</a> 23:33, 11 September 2006 (UTC))</dd>

In the novel (which this page is about) he is not killed by Kitano detonating his collar, he is shot by the soldiers when he begins to threaten the teacher after Kitano says he raped Ms Anno (Yoshitoki's "mother figure").

<p>I was looking over the character pages and most of them contain images of scenes from the film. While some of these are relevant a large proportion of them are irrelevant and just seam to be either clutter or spoilers or both. For example the image which appears on several pages of <a href="../../../n/o/r/Noriko_Nakagawa_7909.html" title="Noriko Nakagawa">Noriko Nakagawa</a> being locked in a toilet cubicle. Do we need this?, I’m pretty sure that just writing that it happened in the film on Noriko's page is enough. Another example is <a href="../../../t/a/k/Takako_Chigusa_c048.html" title="Takako Chigusa">Takako Chigusa</a> there must be at least 5 images of the same scene, nearly all of which are spoilers, surly only one or two of these are needed. These are just examples of what I have seen over nearly all the character pages. Something needs to be done before the pages just become cluttered with pointless images. All that is really needed are images of the 2 different visual versions of each character. - <a href="../../../u/r/r/User%7EUrrgh5591_fa2b.html" title="User:Urrgh5591">Urrgh5591</a> 10:29, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I suggest removing the pictures from the film and manga, as this article is about the novel. I could see the need for one or two, to illustrate the fact that the story has been adapted into other media, but one picture for every major character isn't needed. Monsieurxander 18:51, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>But the novel itself has no pictures whatsoever. Also, this article is ALSO about the BR franchise in general. <a href="../../../w/h/i/User%7EWhisperToMe_201b.html" title="User:WhisperToMe">WhisperToMe</a> 02:29, 15 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>No, because this has come up before. I think at present there is a single article on most of the students, which incorporates their role in all three media, and these three combined make justifiable articles in their own right.
