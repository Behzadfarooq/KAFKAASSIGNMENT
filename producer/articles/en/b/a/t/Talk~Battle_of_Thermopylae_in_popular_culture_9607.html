<p>As they are part of popular culture, I think there should be a video games section. Personally, this would be an interesting section, since video games are some of the few popular culture references that don't specifically go straight to the Thermopylae battle. Some notable games that have been influenced by Spartan culture that I can think of off the top of my head would be <a href="../../../h/a/l/Halo_%28video_game%29.html" title="Halo (video game)">Halo</a>, the <a href="../../../a/g/e/Age_of_Empires_84ac.html" title="Age of Empires">Age of Empires</a> series plus <a href="../../../a/g/e/Age_of_Mythology_3a0d.html" title="Age of Mythology">Age of Mythology</a>, <a href="../../../t/o/t/Rome%7E_Total_War_7ac1.html" title="Rome: Total War">Rome: Total War</a>, <a href="../../../t/o/t/Spartan%7E_Total_Warrior_7ad5.html" title="Spartan: Total Warrior">Spartan: Total Warrior</a>. <a href="../../../s/h/r/User%7EShrumster_69ea.html" title="User:Shrumster">Shrumster</a> 11:13, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I agree, but the rest of the article could probably use a re-write as well, since many items seem to assume that only the Battle of Thermopylae is ever referenced... indeed the current article could well be called Thermopylae in Popular Culture. 212.57.228.21 11:27, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>And there's the mentioning of Thermopylae in the last battle scene in <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Last_Samurai_44b0.html" title="The Last Samurai">The Last Samurai</a>.</p>
<p>I question putting Halo in there as all that it relates to Sparta is the name Spartan II, I don't think it relates specically to Sparta in an historical contexts say compared with God of War which states that he is a ex-Spartan commander. I'll change this in 2 days if no one objects. Alchemy101 12:02, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I agree, Halo should be removed as it contains only minor references to Sparta. 76.102.63.117 02:47, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'd invite you all to go read the back-story to Halo in order to get a feel of the level of Spartan culture they put into the game. Particularly the training the Master Cheif goes though, lessons on teamwork, tactics, resourcefulness, etc. In retrospect, Halo's fictional SPARTAN-II program does make a futuristic Spartan. I'm not gonna rip line out of the book and quote them here unless it's really necessary, but Halo is the forefront for Video Games making references to the Spartan military. <a href="../../../g/h/o/User%7EGhostalker_d602.html" title="User:Ghostalker">Ghostalker</a> 07:04, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>They actually do reference Sparta quite a bit in the Halo backstory, as has been mentioned. In 'The Fall of Reach', they explicitly mention and explain Thermopylae several times as well as the namesake for the unit's designation. Finally, several aspects of the plot (i.e. trained from approximately 7 to be an elite, well-equiped and cohesive fighting unit unwilling to accept defeat against numerically superior forces) clearly show the Spartan influence. TheNobleDuke 05:47, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Perhaps, but I believe that the "Sparta in Popular Culture" section should be limited to games that actually take place in or directly feature Sparta, not vaguely reference it. 76.102.63.21 01:37, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Why has Halo been added again? First of all, the section incorrectly states that Master Chief is a Spartan (not a SPARTAN), which may lead to confusion in non-Halo aficionados. Second of all, as the issue of whether or not Halo should remain is still under debate here, I don't believe another poorly thought-out paragraph on the subject should be added. 24.6.14.215 00:29, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think it should be mentioned at the very least. If you don't want to add the game, at least add "The Fall of Reach" to the books section. There is very clearly a section devoted to discussing sparta and the spartan way of life.</p>
<p>I don't have any objections to adding 'Fall of Reach' to the books section if it really does thoroughly cite Sparta, however the Video Game section, as is being discussed here, should not have Halo added (see above).24.6.14.215 03:38, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think this article leaves out the two other aspects of Spartn culture that the city state is remembered for. 1) As a "fascist", "militaristic" spoil to "democratic". "humanist" Athens. 2) And as slave holders, most famously of the Messenian helots. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_68.49.242.230_a03c.html" title="Special:Contributions/68.49.242.230">68.49.242.230</a> (talk) 13:18, 18 March 2007 (UTC).</small></p>

<p>And Sparta is of course also famous for pederasty:</p>
<p>According to Erich Bethe,</p>
<p>What the Dorians brought was boy-love as a publicly recognized and honorable institution. The Dorians strictly regulated the love relationship between man and boy and treated it as a very important arrangement very publicly with honorable earnestness under the protection of the family, society, the state, and religion. . . . In Sparta, Crete, and Thebes. . . . the education of the ruling class, resting on pederasty, [was directed towards] arete and manly virtue, which principally manifested itself in war.[12]</p>

<p>How does this relate to "Sparta in Popular Culture"? 24.6.14.215 03:33, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Because these are other aspects of Spartan culture that are prevalent in popular culture. This article focuses on Thermopylae in Popular culture. But generally when one uses the term Spartan, or when Sparta is depicted in literature the allusion has the flavor of militarism, an idea which is not at all captured by this article. This artile ought to be renamed Thermopylae in popular culture.</p>
