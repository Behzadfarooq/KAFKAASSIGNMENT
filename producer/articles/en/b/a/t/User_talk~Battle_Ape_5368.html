<p>I am highly surprised that so far nobody told you Thank you! or Welcome! So here I am telling both: Thank you for creating one of the requested articles. I hope you'll keep up with the great task. As you are doing just great on Wikipedia, I won't spam your talk page with bunch of links, so just simply Welcome! And stick around, we really need your help (maybe being a little too busy to say hello or thanks). Oh, and that monkey pic on your user page - you should working as a graphic designer for Pixar&#160;:) <a href="../../../r/e/n/User%7ERenata3_94d8.html" title="User:Renata3">Renata3</a> 19:20, 14 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks for uploading <b><a href="../../../c/a/r/Image%7ECarcass.jpg_a475.html" title="Image:Carcass.jpg">Image:Carcass.jpg</a></b>. I notice the 'image' page currently doesn't specify who created the content, so the <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copyright.html" title="Copyright">copyright</a> status is therefore unclear. If you have not created this media yourself then you need to argue that we have the right to use the media on Wikipedia (see copyright tagging below). If you have not created the media yourself then you should also specify where you found it, i.e., in most cases link to the website where you got it, and the terms of use for content from that page.</p>
<p>If the media also doesn't have a copyright tag then you must also add one. If you created/took the picture, audio, or video then you can use {{<a href="../../../g/f/d/Template%7EGFDL-self_97c5.html" title="Template:GFDL-self">GFDL-self</a>}} to release it under the <a href="../../../g/f/d/GFDL_75b9.html" title="GFDL">GFDL</a>. If you believe the media qualifies as fair use, please read <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_a984.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">fair use</a>, and then use a tag such as {{<a href="../../../f/a/i/Template%7EFairusein_19b9.html" title="Template:Fairusein">fairusein</a>|article name}} or one of the other tags listed at <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_copyright_tags_f6dd.html#Fair_use" title="Wikipedia:Image copyright tags">Wikipedia:Image copyright tags#Fair_use</a>. See <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_copyright_tags_f6dd.html" title="Wikipedia:Image copyright tags">Wikipedia:Image copyright tags</a> for the full list of copyright tags that you can use.</p>
<p>If you have uploaded other media, please check that you have specified their source and copyright tagged them, too. You can find a list of 'image' pages you have edited by clicking on the "<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Battle_Ape_be42.html" title="Special:Contributions/Battle Ape">my contributions</a>" link (it is located at the very top of any Wikipedia page when you are logged in), and then selecting "Image" from the dropdown box. Note that any unsourced and untagged images will be deleted one week after they have been uploaded, as described on <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriteria_for_speedy_deletion_81ee.html#Images.2FMedia" title="Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion">criteria for speedy deletion</a>.

<p>Thanks for the work you did on the early years in Australia. You said you got bored and confused. I can't help the former and I do sympathise. Perhaps the latter might be helped in part with a template I have put together at <a href="../../../a/u/s/Wikipedia%7EAustralian_Wikipedians%27_notice_board_18xx_in_Australia_b7e5.html" title="Wikipedia:Australian Wikipedians' notice board/18xx in Australia">Wikipedia:Australian Wikipedians' notice board/18xx in Australia</a> though it seems to me that you had a good handle on things.

<dd>That will be helpful. The major reason I was getting confused though, was that it was difficult to find sources on the Internet about the very early years of settlement. <a href="../../../b/a/t/User%7EBattle_Ape_1022.html" title="User:Battle Ape">Battle Ape</a> 17:35, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yeah - it is usually better to put it under the refered abc story article as <i>External link</i> so that another editor doing a quick review of the article can see that an attempt to get info has been done - there is a big push at the moment to get all articles with visible refs and sources - <a href="../../../s/a/t/User_talk%7ESatuSuro_2646.html" title="User talk:SatuSuro">SatuSuro</a> 05:04, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Very good point - usually a quick check of the geosciences australia database is enough to check with that (you would not believe what some vndls do to something as simple asbasic numbers in an article) or other online sources. Most shorter stub like articles are as important as the bigger ones when it comes to overall credibility of wikipedia - I am the last to cast stones in this area - I have heaps of articles to go back to and get a ref.... <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a> is the big push.
