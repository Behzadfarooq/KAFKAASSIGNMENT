<p>Hi, why is in this article claimed that the reason for Hitler`s halt order was to save his tanks for further operations. Thats just speculation and not true. The reason for the halt order is not definetley known even today. Well one version is, that Hitler wanted to halt them, in agreement with von Rundstedt, to save them for further battles, another version is that Goering convinced Hitler that the Luftwaffe could destroy the encircled Allies alonely. Then i would add, that many generals (for example von Brauchitsch) protested heavily against the halt order and that the halt order was cancelled after Hitler heard, that the Allies started the evacuation. I will add this in the afternoon, if someone doesn`t agree plz tell it here.</p>
<p>Delete the What-If? I think we should remove that section because that's just speculation and primary source work and have no place in the Wikipedia. We cannot substantiate most of what is stated in that section. Please advise. <a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7EComatose51_3c23.html" title="User:Comatose51">Comatose51</a> 20:25, 3 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I don't think I've ever heard this referred to at the Battle of Dunkirk. (usually just Dunkirk). Indeed a google search find just 463 references to battle of Dunkirk, with the Wikipedia page thetop hit.

<li>The Military history project recommends a geographic name instead of an operational</li>
</ul>
<p>designation for reasons of neutrality.</p>
<p>Why did the Germans halted the advance of their armored divisions?</p>
<ul>
<li>Well, nobody really can come up with anything that is plausible right now, but according to <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Wright_ba66.html" title="Peter Wright">Peter Wright</a>, author of the famous book <a href="../../../s/p/y/Spycatcher.html" title="Spycatcher">Spycatcher</a>, the Germans didn't advance with their troops because they though that the HEAVILY mined British Channel would've wiped out the retreating ships. Unfortunately for the Germans, Mr Wright and his friends in the Royal Navy found out a way to degauss the ships of the RN to repel <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magnetic_mines.html" title="Magnetic mines">magnetic mines</a> as to protect them from the mines. This is all in his sequel to Spycatcher, <i>The Encyclopedia of Spycatcher</i>. However, I cannot verify whether his anecdotes are true or not, but he was there at the time.</li>
</ul>
<p>PS, if anyone has an answer to this, can they reply? I would like to know too. Thanks. <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECronoDroid_f0f5.html" title="User:CronoDroid">CronoDroid</a> 5 NOV 05.</p>
<ul>
<li>There are actually several reasonable military reasons for this order, including a pause to resupply and refit the Panzer divisions for an attack on the French forces to the south of the German breakthrough. Also, the canals and rivers in the Dunkirk area were not ideal terrain for armored operations. Other historians believe that the personal influence of Hermann Goering promoted the ability of the Luftwaffe beyond its actual capability. Some historians propose a more complicated political scheme which involved allowing the British to escape in hopes of a peace settlement, but this possibility isn't widely accepted. See the treatment of Dunkirk in the references for details.</li>

<p>Has anyone considered the possibility that there could be a <i>political</i> reason for this order? I don't think that the Wehrmacht leaders were dumb enough not to recognize an opportunity to crush their foes. --205.177.246.156 18:10, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The Battle of Dunkirk <a href="../../../1/6/5/1658.html" title="1658">1658</a> <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_4.html" title="June 4">June 4</a>, (also known the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_the_Dunes_%281658%29_bfab.html" title="Battle of the Dunes (1658)">Battle of the Dunes</a>) is the name for a battle between the French and their English Commonwealth allies against the Spanish during the The <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglo-Spanish_War_%281654%29_0f23.html" title="Anglo-Spanish War (1654)">Anglo-Spanish War</a> 1654-60. The English who had had no idea how to fight a battle in 1640, could now field a new model army which could defeat a professional continental army in under 2 hours. There was also a regiment of Royalists, (up from Paris), present for the battle, I don't know if it is recorded what the two English groups thought about fighting along side each other. Perhaps they fought on opposite wings.</p>
<p>As there is already a battle with this name and this article is squatting on it, it is another good reason to merge this article into <i>Operation Dynamo</i>, but there should be redirects from articles called "Evacuation of Dunkirk" and "Dunkirk evacuation" to <i>Operation Dynamo</i> to make searching for it easy. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Baird_Shearer_a81d.html" title="User:Philip Baird Shearer">Philip Baird Shearer</a> 14:33, 28 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Take a look at that site. Nearly every article they have is <b>very</b> similar to the ones here on Wikipedia.</p>
<p>The one's the <a href="../../../b/r/e/Bren.html" title="Bren">Bren</a> and <a href="../../../s/t/e/Sten.html" title="Sten">Sten</a> (which I helped to write) are almost word-for-word copies of ours. They even use the same pictures.</p>

<dd>I agree, their article is a copyvio of ours. For one think their site says (c) 2003, while our article is from 2002. Secondly, and decisively, our page contains a progression of edits like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Battle_of_Dunkirk&amp;diff=737259&amp;oldid=734655" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Battle_of_Dunkirk&amp;diff=737259&amp;oldid=734655" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Battle_of_Dunkirk&amp;diff=1085166&amp;oldid=1068276" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Battle_of_Dunkirk&amp;diff=1085166&amp;oldid=1068276" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, the accumulated effect of which is their page. If our page was a copyvio of their this would not be possible. It is however a compelling argument that their page is a copyvio of ours. <a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThue_a090.html" title="User:Thue">Thue</a> | <a href="../../../t/h/u/User_talk%7EThue_d7b8.html" title="User talk:Thue">talk</a> 10:47, 12 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>I agree. Checking the original version of this article vs. their version shows verbatim matching <i>except that our version is more complete</i>. It appears that they took material from us and edited some out. I have reverted to the pre-copyvio tag version, restoring this to normal article status. <a href="../../../s/w/a/User%7ESWAdair_e7db.html" title="User:SWAdair">SWAdair</a> | <a href="../../../s/w/a/User_talk%7ESWAdair_58bb.html" title="User talk:SWAdair">Talk</a> 10:52, 12 Dec 2004 (UTC)

<li>Ok, it looks like Thue beat me to restoring the article, probably by seconds. Since we were both reverting, there was no edit conflict.

<p>The article contains this paragraph of analysis:</p>
<dl>
<dd>The troops evacuated from this battle later served as backbone forces in the defense of Britain. There is a general consensus that if Hitler had ordered a full strike on Dunkirk, effectively wiping out the entire British army, the Axis powers would have crushed Britain, and Germany would have been able to send many more troops in its invasion of the Soviet Union. The lull in action was enough time to evacuate many troops, and many of them subsequently fought in the Battle of Britain and other battles against Nazi Germany throughout the rest of the war.</dd>
</dl>
<p>I think this kind of analysis needs a source. The conclusions seem wrong to me, because (1) the evacuated troops did not fight in the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Britain_2389.html" title="Battle of Britain">battle of Britain</a>; (2) Germany could only have "crushed" Britain by invading it, and the difficulty of the invasion was gaining air and sea superiority over the Channel; the evacuated troops would probably not have affected the outcome, since they had lost all their heavy equipment; (3) In the event of Britain being crushed, Germany would have been able to send <i>fewer</i> troops to the Soviet Union, because many would have been killed or injured in the invasion of Britain and many more would have been involved in occupation duties.</p>
<p>The article could do with some analysis of the effects of the evacuation at Dunkirk (e.g. effects on morale, notes on relative performance of the air forces, actual role of the evacuated troops), but this is not it.

<dd>I wrote that section back when I was an anonymous user. I can tell you that I didn't make that up; in fact, I wrote it right after watching a show on the <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_Channel_2ce1.html" title="History Channel">History Channel</a> about the invasion of France. Or the beginnings of World War II. I forget. The point is most of the British Army was in France in 1940 to defend against a German invasion, but clearly the Germans were far superior in their attack than both the French and British were at defending. If Hitler had ordered a full attack on that 30 sq km. area instead of pissing away his time touring <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paris.html" title="Paris">Paris</a>, the war may have gone a different way. -- <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_King_Of_Gondor_3ff0.html" title="User:The King Of Gondor">The KoG</a> | <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThe_King_Of_Gondor_4bfc.html" title="User talk:The King Of Gondor">Talk</a> 17:37, Dec 14, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Also, Hitler would have been able to divert more resources to the Eastern Front, because even if substantial losses were incurred at Dunkirk and in the possible invasion, the fact remains that no Western Front would have existed for very long. France was a ruined mess, and Britain would be under Axis control, meaning that the U.S. and Canada could not base itself out of England. With no Western Front, Hitler had until August 1941 to rebuild his forces for the attack on the <a href="../../../s/o/v/Soviet_Union_ad1f.html" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a>, and he probably could have found thousands of indoctrined young men to do his bidding. -- <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_King_Of_Gondor_3ff0.html" title="User:The King Of Gondor">The KoG</a> | <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThe_King_Of_Gondor_4bfc.html" title="User talk:The King Of Gondor">Talk</a> 17:44, Dec 14, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The war may indeed have gone a different way, but you haven't justified why. The evacuated troops did not fight in the battle of Britain. There was no Western Front in 1940 or 1941. A forgotten TV documentary is not a reference. Can you do come up with a better justification or shall I rewrite the paragraph myself? <a href="../../../g/d/r/User%7EGdr_e4cb.html" title="User:Gdr">Gdr</a> 22:58, 2004 Dec 15 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Then change it. If you know better than I, then you don't need my permission. Again, I was just an anonymous user. I wasn't as skilled with my fact checking as I am now. Although I admit I could have phrased the Battle of Britain line better. I didn't mean to imply that they all fought in the battle, I just meant to say that after France was taken over, the British troops fought in subsequent battles includng the BoB. It was just an attempt to expand on a single line paragraph which said "The troops evacuated from this battle later served as backbone forces in the defense of Britain." -- <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_King_Of_Gondor_3ff0.html" title="User:The King Of Gondor">The KoG</a> | <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThe_King_Of_Gondor_4bfc.html" title="User talk:The King Of Gondor">Talk</a> 00:40, Dec 16, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The usual argument which is put forward is that if Dunkirk had fallen then the British Army would have been in a pocket. They might have been able to fight their way south west. But more likely they would have been enveloped and faced with decimation or surrender. If the Germans had then suggested an armistice, "not surrender you understand, just a few minor concessions like the return of the German colonies, and a few other minor details to be sorted out at the peace conference... Oh yes, one other small point hardly worth mentioning but don't send any Jews along to the conference", then there would have been very strong pressure in Britain for a political settlement, probably with yet another Prime Minister (three in one year) who was more in tune with new political realities.&#160;:-( <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Baird_Shearer_a81d.html" title="User:Philip Baird Shearer">Philip Baird Shearer</a> 02:08, 17 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think it's safe to say that, had the BEF not been evacuated, best-case scenario would be a drastically reduced campaign in the Mediterranean and Asian theatres (likely all British forces would have been recalled to guard against the seemingly inevitable German invasion). Worst-case would have been Britain being taken out of the war completely through armistice. After that, it's difficult to predict further events, but the war would have definitely gone much worse for the Western Allies. <a href="../../../o/b/e/User%7EOberiko_30df.html" title="User:Oberiko">Oberiko</a> 03:24, 17 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>If the BEF had been threatened with destruction and if Britain had been knocked out of the war with a generous armistice, then the chances are that there would have been no Free French or governments in exile. The job of pacifying Western Europe would have been much easier with far far fewer occupation troops needed. Most of the colonies in the Far East would have been under the control of whatever governments existed in Europe. As Japan was allied with Germany, it is likely that the colonies would have traded oil and other commodities with Japan. The Japanese would no longer have had to look south and as a favour to the German, and to exploit the wealth of Eastern Russia, they might have been willing to open up a second front against the Soviets in Siberia to aid Germany's attack against the western borders of the Soviet Union... But the tyranny of ifs and maybes have add up.

<dd>OK, done. Dunkirk is one of the popular "what ifs" of World War II (examples include <i>If By Chance</i> by John Strawson; <i>Third Reich Victorious: Alternate Decisions of World War II</i> by Peter Tsouras et al; <i>Virtual History: Alternatives and Counterfactuals</i> by Niall Ferguson), so I suppose this kind of speculation deserves a mention. <a href="../../../g/d/r/User%7EGdr_e4cb.html" title="User:Gdr">Gdr</a> 13:08, 2004 Dec 21 (UTC)</dd>

<p><br />
Despite the propaganda thrown about at the time Britain was unlikely to be invaded all the while the Royal Navy had anything to do with it. At the time of the Dunkirk evacuation, the entire German surface fleet consisted of less than thirty warships. The British navy sank <i>half</i> of the <i>entire</i> German destroyer fleet at the two battles of Narvik - Germany had twenty destroyers before Narvik - the British around 200. Admiral Raeder knew that even with aircover (i.e. if the British had lost the Battle of Britain) invading Britain while their navy was able to fight would have been madness, the German invasion barges would have been anihilated as the British Admiralty were willing to accept %100 losses in ships used to prevent an invasion and they could afford to lose them. If Britain really had been in danger of invasion then they would have withdrawn every ship they could from all around the world back to Britain to defend the home country.</p>
<p>In addition, to many non-seafaring people the English Channel may just look like a wide river and crossing it no-more difficult - well it isn't a wide river, it's a sea and has a sea's weather and a sea's dangers, so apart from the risk of getting his invasion barges sunk by the Royal Navy, Hitler would also have had to take into account the unpredictable weather which can change from a fine day to howling gales in the space of a few hours, e.g., the storms after D-Day 1944 which were in the summer. Bear in mind the Gemans were using hastily converted Rhine barges which are not the same as the purpose-designed landing ships that were used in 1944.</p>
<p>Operation Seelöwe was a bluff and Hitler knew it and so did the British.</p>
<p><br /></p>

<dd>The trapped BEF was the entire British field army. The Brits would not be able to raise an army for the North African campaign. Just imagine the Afrika Korps driving through the Suez Channel and into Crimea.... I think Dunkirk worth a mentioning.</dd>

<p>Likewise, I don't know exactly where, but this article is incomplete without mention of the rearguard action fought by the British 51st Highland division who were left behind to hold off the Germans as long as possible, and to appease the French. They are almost never mentioned in discussions or documentaries about Dunkirk, and yet they played an absolutely vital (and heroic) role. <a href="../../../l/i/a/User%7ELianachan_edab.html" title="User:Lianachan">Lianachan</a> 10:52, 15 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yes the action at St.Valery. Was a damn fine display of what the Scottish soldier can acomplish. Its a shame they have been forgotten. Youre not even allowed to refer to militery actions as brave or heroic on this website. Thats political correctness for you.</p>
<p>Yes I think there should be a greater recognition of the sacrifice of the 51st at St-Valery. Well Done 51st. Scotland Forever.</p>
<dl>
<dd>This wasn't a rearguard action to cover the evacuation at Dunkirk. 51st Highland was deployed behind the Maginot Line and it was simply moved to the west to strengthen the Somme position. That it got trapped at Saint Valéry was not a deliberate sacrifice and it had nothing to do with Operation Dynamo, which was well over at that time.--MWAK 08:36, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>If you`d read our comments you`d no that idiot. Churchill sacrificed the Highland Division so as to keep the French fighting. Come on Wikipedia drop all this political correctnes nonsense.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I see: all the events of <i>Fall Rot</i> were one gigantic rear guard action! I hadn't thought of it that way and my apologies for misunderstanding you. From that point of view it could be said that even more British troops were sacrificed: not only were the Scots left <i>behind</i> but many troops were sent <i>in</i>, among them the most powerful force of Britain: the 1st Armoured Division. Most of them were succesfully evacuated again and I maintain that the fact this didn't work for the 51st was sheer coincidence (I presume you weren't implying they were singled out to be left behind <i>because</i> they were Scottish&#160;:o). Of course an immediate and complete withdrawal from France in late May would only have been logical if Britain intended to make a separate peace with Germany. Luckily and most honourably, the opposite was true.--MWAK 13:17, 23 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The infobox summary indicated the battle was a German tactical victory and Allied strategic victory. I think this conclusion is incorrect. German failure to prevent the evacuation can't be considered a tacical success. Although the successful escape of the troops boosted British morale, it only avoided the complete disaster of their capture, and the results of the battle setup the conquest of France. That outcome isn't a victory at the strategic level. I changed the results accordingly.</p>

<p>Regarding this section after line 36</p>
<p><i>It is curious to note that admist all the confusion, and after the evacuation at Dunkirk - and while Paris was enduring its short-lived siege - the First Canadian Division and a Scottish division were sent to Normandy (Brest) and penetrated 200 miles inland toward Paris before they heard that Paris had fallen and France had capitulated. They eventually retreated and re-embarked for England. At the same time as the Canadian 1st Division landed in Brest, the Canadian 242 Squadron of the RAF flew their <a href="../../../h/a/w/Hawker_Hurricane_7bea.html" title="Hawker Hurricane">Hawker Hurricanes</a> to Nantes (100 miles south-east) and set up there to provide air cover</i></p>
<p>This is interesting information, however, does it really belong as part of this article? It is already included word for word in the Battle of France article. Not wanting to step on any toes, but I believe this passage is not entirely on-topic and can be removed from this specific article. Any objections? JQ 13:58, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
