<p>The king was aided by Scottish allies and was attempting to regain the throne that had been lost when his father <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_I_of_England_350c.html" title="Charles I of England">Charles I</a> was <a href="../../../r/e/g/Regicide.html" title="Regicide">executed</a>. The commander of the Scots, <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Leslie_%28Scottish_general%29_0b51.html" title="David Leslie (Scottish general)">Sir David Leslie</a>, supported the plan of fighting in <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scotland.html" title="Scotland">Scotland</a>, where royal support was strongest. Charles, however, insisted on making war in <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a>. He calculated that Cromwell's campaign north of the <a href="../../../r/i/v/River_Forth_d6cd.html" title="River Forth">River Forth</a> would allow the main Scottish Royalist army which was south of the Forth to steal the march on the Roundhead <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Model_Army_f4c0.html" title="New Model Army">New Model Army</a> in a race to London. He hoped, to rally not merely the old faithful Royalists, but also the overwhelming numerical strength of the English <a href="../../../p/r/e/Presbyterian.html" title="Presbyterian">Presbyterians</a> to his standard. He calculated that his alliance with the Scottish Presbyterian <a href="../../../c/o/v/Covenanter.html" title="Covenanter">Covenanters</a> and his signing of the <a href="../../../s/o/l/Solemn_League_and_Covenant_c9ac.html" title="Solemn League and Covenant">Solemn League and Covenant</a> would encourage English Presbyterians to support him against the English Independent faction which had grown in power over the last few years. The Royalist army was kept well in hand, no excesses were allowed, and in a week the Royalists covered 150 miles in marked contrast to the <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Hamilton%2C_1st_Duke_of_Hamilton_a49f.html" title="James Hamilton, 1st Duke of Hamilton">duke of Hamilton's</a> ill-fated expedition of <a href="../../../1/6/4/1648.html" title="1648">1648</a>. On <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_8.html" title="August 8">8 August</a> the troops were given a well-earned rest between <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penrith%2C_Cumbria_6ba8.html" title="Penrith, Cumbria">Penrith</a> and <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kendal.html" title="Kendal">Kendal</a>.</p>
<p>But the Royalists were mistaken in supposing that the enemy was taken aback by their new move. Everything had been foreseen both by Cromwell and by the <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_Council_of_State_bc54.html" title="English Council of State">Council of State</a> in <a href="../../../w/e/s/Westminster.html" title="Westminster">Westminster</a>. The latter had called out the greater part of the militia on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_7.html" title="August 7">August 7</a>. Lieutenant-General <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Fleetwood_52ed.html" title="Charles Fleetwood">Charles Fleetwood</a> began to draw together the midland contingents at <a href="../../../b/a/n/Banbury.html" title="Banbury">Banbury</a>, the London trained bands turned out for field service no fewer than 14,000 strong. Every suspected Royalist was closely watched, and the magazines of arms in the country-houses of the gentry were for the most part removed into the strong places. On his part Cromwell had quietly made his preparations. <a href="../../../p/e/r/Perth%2C_Scotland_2b8a.html" title="Perth, Scotland">Perth</a> passed into his hands on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_2.html" title="August 2">August 2</a>, and he brought back his army to <a href="../../../l/e/i/Leith.html" title="Leith">Leith</a> by <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_5.html" title="August 5">August 5</a>. Thence he dispatched Lieutenant-General <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Lambert_%28General%29_ac8d.html" title="John Lambert (General)">John Lambert</a> with a cavalry corps to harass the invaders. Major-General <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Harrison_4af8.html" title="Thomas Harrison">Thomas Harrison</a> was already at Newcastle picking the best of the county mounted-troops to add to his own regulars. On <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_9.html" title="August 9">August 9</a>, Charles was at <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kendal.html" title="Kendal">Kendal</a>, Lambert hovering in his rear, and Harrison marching swiftly to bar his way at the <a href="../../../m/e/r/Mersey.html" title="Mersey">Mersey</a>. <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Fairfax_59cc.html" title="Thomas Fairfax">Thomas Fairfax</a> emerged for a moment from his retirement to organize the <a href="../../../y/o/r/Yorkshire.html" title="Yorkshire">Yorkshire</a> levies, and the best of these as well as of the <a href="../../../l/a/n/Lancashire.html" title="Lancashire">Lancashire</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/e/Cheshire.html" title="Cheshire">Cheshire</a> and <a href="../../../s/t/a/Staffordshire.html" title="Staffordshire">Staffordshire</a> militias were directed upon <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warrington.html" title="Warrington">Warrington</a>, which Harrison reached on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_15.html" title="August 15">August 15</a>, a few hours in front of Charles's advanced guard. Lambert too, slipping round the left flank of the enemy, joined Harrison, and the English fell back (<a href="../../../a/u/g/August_16.html" title="August 16">August 16</a>), slowly and without letting themselves be drawn into a fight, along the London road.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Worcester_3874.html" title="Edit section: The Worcester campaign">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Worcester campaign</span></h2>
<p>Cromwell meanwhile, leaving <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Monck_32f7.html" title="George Monck">George Monck</a> with the least efficient regiments to carry on the war in Scotland, had reached the <a href="../../../r/i/v/River_Tyne_99d8.html" title="River Tyne">river Tyne</a> in seven days, and thence, marching 20 miles a day in extreme heat with the country people carrying their arms and equipment the regulars entered <a href="../../../f/e/r/Ferrybridge.html" title="Ferrybridge">Ferrybridge</a> on the <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_19.html" title="August 19">August 19</a>, at which date Lambert, Harrison and the north-western militia were about <a href="../../../c/o/n/Congleton.html" title="Congleton">Congleton</a>. It seemed probable that a great battle would take place between <a href="../../../l/i/c/Lichfield.html" title="Lichfield">Lichfield</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/v/Coventry.html" title="Coventry">Coventry</a> on or just after <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_25.html" title="August 25">August 25</a>, and that Cromwell, Harrison, Lambert and Fleetwood would all take part in it. But the scene and the date of the denouement were changed by the enemy's movements. Shortly after leaving Warrington the young king had resolved to abandon the direct march on London and to make for the <a href="../../../s/e/v/Severn.html" title="Severn">Severn</a> valley, where his father had found the most constant and the most numerous adherents in the first war, and which had been the centre of gravity of the English Royalist movement of 1648. Sir <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_Massey_0274.html" title="Edward Massey">Edward Massey</a>, formerly the Parliamentary governor of <a href="../../../g/l/o/Gloucester.html" title="Gloucester">Gloucester</a>, was now with Charles, and it was hoped that he would induce his fellow Presbyterians to take arms. The military quality of the Welsh border Royalists was well proved, that of the <a href="../../../g/l/o/Gloucestershire.html" title="Gloucestershire">Gloucestershire</a> Presbyterians not less so, and, based on Gloucester and Worcester as his father had been based on Oxford, Charles II. hoped, not unnaturally, to deal with an Independent minority more effectually than Charles I. had done with a Parliamentary majority of the people of England. But even the pure Royalism which now ruled in the invading army could not alter the fact that it was a Scottish army, and it was not an Independent faction but all England that took arms against it.</p>
<p>Charles arrived at Worcester on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_22.html" title="August 22">August 22</a>, and spent five days in resting the troops, preparing for further operations, and gathering and arming the few recruits who came in. It is unnecessary to argue that the delay was fatal; it was a necessity of the case foreseen and accepted when the march to Worcester had been decided upon, and had the other course, that of marching on London via <a href="../../../l/i/c/Lichfield.html" title="Lichfield">Lichfield</a>, been taken the battle would have been fought three days earlier with the same result.</p>
<p>Cromwell, the lord general, had during his march south thrown out successively two flying columns under Colonel <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Lilburne_6dcf.html" title="Robert Lilburne">Robert Lilburne</a> to deal with the Lancashire Royalists under the <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Stanley%2C_7th_Earl_of_Derby_68ef.html" title="James Stanley, 7th Earl of Derby">Earl of Derby</a>. Lilburne entirely routed an Lancashire detachment of enemy on their way to join the main Royalist army at the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Wigan_Lane_23d2.html" title="Battle of Wigan Lane">Battle of Wigan Lane</a> on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_25.html" title="August 25">August 25</a> and as affairs turned out Cromwell merely shifted the area of his concentration two marches to the south-west, to <a href="../../../e/v/e/Evesham%2C_Worcestershire_6367.html" title="Evesham, Worcestershire">Evesham</a>. Early on the <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_28.html" title="August 28">August 28</a>, Lambert surprised the passage of the Severn at <a href="../../../u/p/t/Upton-upon-Severn_f90d.html" title="Upton-upon-Severn">Upton</a>, 6 miles below Worcester, and in the action which followed Massey was severely wounded. Fleetwood followed Lambert. The enemy was now only 16,000 strong and disheartened by the apathy with which they had been received in districts formerly all their own. Cromwell, for the first and last time in his military career, had a two-to-one numerical superiority.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_30.html" title="August 30">August 30</a> Cromwell delayed the start of the battle to give time for two <a href="../../../p/o/n/Pontoon_bridge.html" title="Pontoon bridge">pontoon bridges</a> to be constructed one over the Severn and the other over the Teme close to their confluence. The delay allowed Cromwell to launch his attack on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_3.html" title="September 3">September 3</a> one year to the day since his victory at the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Dunbar_%281650%29_b7e6.html" title="Battle of Dunbar (1650)">Battle of Dunbar</a>.<sup id="_ref-TR600_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-TR600" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Worcester_3874.html" title="Edit section: The battle">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The battle</span></h2>
<p>Cromwell took his measures deliberately. Lilburne from Lancashire and Major <a href="../../../m/e/r/Mercer.html" title="Mercer">Mercer</a> with the Worcestershire horse were to secure <a href="../../../b/e/w/Bewdley.html" title="Bewdley">Bewdley</a> bridge on the enemy's line of retreat. Fleetwood was to force his way across the <a href="../../../r/i/v/River_Teme_a1d8.html" title="River Teme">Teme</a> and attack St John's, the western suburb of Worcester. While Lambert commanded the Eastern Flank of the Army which would advance and encircle the Eastern walls of Worcester. Cromwell would lead the attack on the southern ramparts of the city.</p>
<p>The assault stated on the morning of <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_3.html" title="September 3">September 3</a> and initially the initiative lay with the Parliamentarians. Fleetwood forced the passage of the Teme over the pontoon bridges against Royalists under the command of Major General Montgomery. Colonel Richard Dean initial attempts to crossed the Powick Bridge (where <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prince_Rupert_of_the_Rhine_0e3c.html" title="Prince Rupert of the Rhine">Prince Rupert of the Rhine</a> had won the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Powick_Bridge_0f1b.html" title="Battle of Powick Bridge">Battle of Powick Bridge</a> his first victory in 1642) failed against stubborn resistance by the Royalists (many of whom were battle hardened Scottish Highlanders) commanded by Colonel Keith. By force of arms and numbers the Royalist army was pushed backwards by the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Model_Army_f4c0.html" title="New Model Army">New Model Army</a> with Cromwell on the eastern bank of the Severn and Fleetwood on the western sweeping in a semicircle 4 miles long up towards Worcester.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Royalists contested every hedgerow around Powick meadows and this stubborn resistance on the west bank of the Severn north of the Teme, was becoming a serious problem for the Parliamenterians, so Cromwel led Parliamentary reinforcements from the eastern side of the town over the Severn pontoon bridge to aid Fleetwood. Charles II from his vantage point on top of <a href="../../../w/o/r/Worcester_cathedral.html" title="Worcester cathedral">Worcester cathedral's</a> tower realised that an opportunity to attack the now exposed eastern flank of the Parliamentary army. As the defenders on the Western side of the city retreated in good order into the city (although during this manoeuvre Keith was captured, and Montgomery was badly wounded), Charles ordered two <a href="../../../s/o/r/Sortie.html" title="Sortie">sorties</a> to attack the Parliamentary forces east of the city. The north-eastern sortie through St Martins Gate was commanded by the <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Hamilton%2C_2nd_Duke_of_Hamilton_22b4.html" title="William Hamilton, 2nd Duke of Hamilton">Duke of Hamilton</a> and attacked the Parlimentry lines at Perry Wood, the south-eastern one through Sidbury Gate was led by Charles II and attacked Red Hill. The Royalist cavalry under the command of David Leslie, that was gathered on Pitchcroft meadow on the northern side of the city did not receive orders to aid the sorties and Leslie choose not to do so under his own initiative. Cromwell seeing the difficulty that his east flank was under rushed back over the Severn pontoon bridge with three brigades of troops to reinforce the flank.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[3]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-CharlesIntervines_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CharlesIntervines" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>Although they were pushed back, the Parliamentarians under Lambert were too numerous and experienced to be defeated by such a move and after an hour in which the Parliamentarians initially retreated under the unexpected attack, when reinforced by Cromwell's three brigades, they in turn forced the Royalists to retreat back towards the city.<sup id="_ref-CharlesIntervines_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CharlesIntervines" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Royalist retreat turned into a <a href="../../../r/o/u/Rout.html" title="Rout">rout</a> in which Parliamentarian and Royalist forces intermingled and skirmished up to and into the city. The Royalist position became untenable when the Essex militia stormed and captured <a href="../../../f/o/r/Fort_Royal_Hill_cf84.html" title="Fort Royal Hill">Fort Royal</a>, (a <a href="../../../r/e/d/Redoubt.html" title="Redoubt">redoubt</a> on a small hill to the south-east of Worcester overlooking the Sidbury gate), turning the Royalist guns to fire on Worcester.<sup id="_ref-CromwellIntervenes2_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CromwellIntervenes2" title="">[5]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>The defences of the city were stormed from three different directions as darkness came on, regulars and militia fighting with equal gallantry and the few thousands of the Royalists who escaped during the night were easily captured by Lilburne and Mercer, or by the militia which watched every road in Yorkshire and Lancashire. Even the country people brought in scores of prisoners, for officers and men alike, stunned by the suddenness of the disaster, offered no resistance.<sup id="_ref-CromwellIntervenes2_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CromwellIntervenes2" title="">[5]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>

<p>After the battle, Cromwell returned to <a href="../../../a/y/l/Aylesbury.html" title="Aylesbury">Aylesbury</a>, <a href="../../../b/u/c/Buckinghamshire.html" title="Buckinghamshire">Buckinghamshire</a>; one of the <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parliament_of_England_d506.html" title="Parliament of England">parliamentarian</a> strongholds and close to the seat of his late cousin; the civil war hero <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Hampden_5cf3.html" title="John Hampden">John Hampden</a>. He stayed at the aptly named <a href="../../../k/i/n/King%27s_Head_Inn%2C_Aylesbury_d735.html" title="King's Head Inn, Aylesbury">King's Head Inn, Aylesbury</a> and it was here that he received the thanks of parliament for his final defeat of the royalists.</p>
<p>The Parliamentary militia were sent home within a week. Cromwell, who had ridiculed "such stuff" six months ago, knew them better now. "Your new raised forces," he wrote to the <a href="../../../r/u/m/Rump_Parliament_d8e6.html" title="Rump Parliament">Rump Parliament</a>, "did perform singular good service, for which they deserve a very high estimation and acknowledgement". Worcester was fought by a "nation in arms", by citizen soldiers who had their hearts in the struggle, and could be trusted not only to fight their hardest but to march their best. Only with such troops would a general dare to place a deep river between the two halves of his army or to send away detachments beforehand to reap the fruits of victory, in certain anticipation of winning the victory with the remainder. The sense of duty, which the raw militia possessed in so high a degree, ensured the arrival and the action of every column at the appointed time and place. The result was, in brief, one of those rare victories in which a pursuit is superfluous a "crowning mercy", as Cromwell called it.</p>

<dd><i>The people in the neighborhood appeared so ignorant and careless at Worcester that I was provoked and asked 'And do Englishmen so soon forget the ground where liberty was fought for?
