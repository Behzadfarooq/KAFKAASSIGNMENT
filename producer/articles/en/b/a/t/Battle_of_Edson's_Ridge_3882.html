The Marines were defending the Lunga perimeter, that guarded <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henderson_Field_%28Guadalcanal%29_19a7.html" title="Henderson Field (Guadalcanal)">Henderson Field</a> on Guadalcanal, which was captured from the Japanese by the Allies in landings on Guadalcanal on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_7.html" title="August 7">August 7</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/4/1942.html" title="1942">1942</a>. Kawaguchi's unit was sent to Guadalcanal in response to the Allied landings with the mission of recapturing the <a href="../../../a/i/r/Airport.html" title="Airport">airfield</a> and driving the Allied forces from the island. Underestimating the strength of Allied forces on Guadalcanal, which at that time numbered about 12,000 personnel, Kawaguchi's 6,000 soldiers conducted several nighttime frontal assaults on the U.S. defenses. The main Japanese assault occurred on an unnamed <a href="../../../r/i/d/Ridge.html" title="Ridge">ridge</a> south of Henderson Field that was manned by troops from several U.S. Marine Corps units, although primarily troops from the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marine_Raiders_7c8f.html" title="Marine Raiders">1st Raider</a> and <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paramarines.html" title="Paramarines">1st Parachute</a> <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battalion.html" title="Battalion">Battalions</a> under U.S. Marine Corps <a href="../../../l/i/e/Lieutenant_Colonel_7041.html" title="Lieutenant Colonel">Lieutenant Colonel</a> <a href="../../../m/e/r/Merritt_A._Edson_c339.html" title="Merritt A. Edson">Merritt A. Edson</a>. Although the U.S. Marine Corps defenses were almost overrun, Kawaguchi's attack was defeated with heavy losses for the Japanese attackers.</p>
<p>Due to the key participation by Edson's unit in defending the ridge, the ridge was commonly referred to as "Edson's" ridge in historical accounts of the battle in <a href="../../../w/e/s/Western_world.html" title="Western world">Western</a> sources. After Edson's Ridge, the Japanese continued to send troops to Guadalcanal for further attempts to retake Henderson Field, affecting Japanese offensive operations in other areas of the <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Pacific_db7d.html" title="South Pacific">South Pacific</a>.</p>

Of these units, the 35th Infantry Brigade under Major General Kiyotaki Kawaguchi was at <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palau.html" title="Palau">Palau</a>, the 4th (Aoba) Infantry Regiment was in the <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philippines.html" title="Philippines">Philippines</a> and the 28th (Ichiki) Infantry Regiment, under the command of <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colonel.html" title="Colonel">Colonel</a> Kiyonao Ichiki, was embarked on transport ships near <a href="../../../g/u/a/Guam.html" title="Guam">Guam</a>. The different units began to move towards Guadalcanal immediately, but Ichiki's regiment, being the closest, would ultimately arrive first. The "First Element" of Ichiki's unit, consisting of about 917 soldiers, landed from destroyers at Taivu Point, east of the Lunga perimeter, on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_19.html" title="August 19">August 19</a>.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>Underestimating the strength of Allied forces on Guadalcanal, Ichiki's First Element conducted a nighttime frontal assault on Marine positions at Alligator Creek on the east side of the Lunga perimeter in the early morning hours of <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_21.html" title="August 21">August 21</a>.

In total, all but 128 of the original 917 men of the Ichiki Regiment's First Element were killed in the battle.

<p>By <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_23.html" title="August 23">August 23</a>, Kawaguchi's unit reached Truk and was loaded onto slow transport ships for the rest of the trip to Guadalcanal. Due to the damage caused by Allied air attack to a separate troop convoy during the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_the_Eastern_Solomons_7dbd.html" title="Battle of the Eastern Solomons">Battle of the Eastern Solomons</a>, the Japanese decided not to deliver Kawaguchi's troops to Guadalcanal by slow transport ship. Instead, the ships carrying Kawaguchi's soldiers were sent to Rabaul. From there, the Japanese planned to deliver Kawaguchi's men to Guadalcanal by destroyers, staging through a Japanese naval <a href="../../../m/i/l/Military_base.html" title="Military base">base</a> in the <a href="../../../s/h/o/Shortland_Islands_ca5b.html" title="Shortland Islands">Shortland Islands</a>. The Japanese destroyers were usually able to make the round trip down "<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Slot_134b.html" title="The Slot">The Slot</a>" to Guadalcanal and back in a single night, thereby minimizing their exposure to Allied air attack. However, delivering the troops in this manner prevented most of the soldiers' heavy equipment and supplies, such as heavy artillery, vehicles, and much food and ammunition, from being carried to Guadalcanal with them. These high speed destroyer runs to Guadalcanal, which occurred throughout the campaign, were later called the "<a href="../../../t/o/k/Tokyo_Express_1a1b.html" title="Tokyo Express">Tokyo Express</a>" by Allied forces and "Rat Transportation" by the Japanese.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[11]</a></sup> Due to either the inability or unwillingness of Allied naval commanders to challenge Japanese naval forces at night, the Japanese controlled the seas around the Solomon Islands during the nighttime. However, any Japanese ship remaining within range of the aircraft at Henderson Field during the daylight hours (about 200 miles) was in great danger from damaging air attack. This "curious tactical situation" would exist for the next several months during the campaign.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>
<p>On <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_28.html" title="August 28">August 28</a>, 600 of Kawaguchi's troops were loaded onto the destroyers <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japanese_destroyer_Asagiri_30bf.html" title="Japanese destroyer Asagiri"><i>Asagiri</i></a>, <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japanese_destroyer_Amagiri_8ded.html" title="Japanese destroyer Amagiri"><i>Amagiri</i></a>, <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japanese_destroyer_Yugiri_136f.html" title="Japanese destroyer Yugiri"><i>Yugiri</i></a>, and <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japanese_destroyer_Shirakumo_2587.html" title="Japanese destroyer Shirakumo"><i>Shirakumo</i></a>, designated Destroyer Division 20 (DD20). Because of a shortage of fuel, DD20 couldn't make the entire round trip to Guadalcanal at high speed in one night. Instead, DD20 had to start the trip earlier in the day so that they could complete the trip by the next morning at a slower, fuel-conserving speed. At <a href="../../../2/4/_/24_hour_clock.html" title="24 hour clock">18:05</a> hours that same day, 11 U.S. <a href="../../../d/i/v/Dive_bomber.html" title="Dive bomber">dive bombers</a> from <a href="../../../v/m/s/VMSB-232_8a9c.html" title="VMSB-232">VMSB-232</a> under the command of LtCol Richard Mangrum,<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[13]</a></sup> flew from Henderson Field, located and attacked DD20 about 70 miles north of Guadalcanal, sinking <i>Asagiri</i> and heavily damaging <i>Yugiri</i> and <i>Shirakumo</i>. <i>Amagiri</i> took <i>Shirakumo</i> in tow and the three destroyers returned to the Shortlands without completing their mission.

<p>In spite of the successes of the destroyer runs, Kawaguchi insisted that as many soldiers of his brigade as possible be delivered to Guadalcanal by slow barges.

<p>Edson, along with Colonel Gerald Thomas, Vandegrift's operations officer, believed that the Japanese attack would come at a narrow, grassy, 1,000-yard-long, coral ridge that paralleled the Lunga River and was located just south of Henderson Field. The unnamed ridge offered a natural avenue of approach to the airfield, commanded the surrounding area and, at that time, was almost undefended. Edson and Thomas tried to persuade Vandegrift to move forces to defend the ridge, but Vandegrift refused, believing that the Japanese were more likely to attack along the coast. Finally, Thomas convinced Vandegrift that the ridge was a good location for Edson's Raiders to "rest" from the actions that they had been involved in over the preceding month. On <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_11.html" title="September 11">September 11</a>, the 840 men of Edson's battalion deployed onto and around the ridge and prepared to defend it.<sup id="_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#_note-28" title="">[29]</a></sup></p>
<p>Calling the ridge, "the centipede," because of its shape, Kawaguchi's Center Body of troops <i>was</i> planning on attacking the Lunga Perimeter at that point. On <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_9.html" title="September 9">September 9</a>, Kawaguchi's troops, split into four columns, left the coast at Koli Point and began marching into the jungle towards their predesignated attack points south and southeast of the airfield. A lack of good maps, at least one faulty compass, and thick, almost inpenetrable jungle caused the Japanese columns to proceed slowly and zigzag, costing a lot of time. At the same time, Oka's troops were approaching the Lunga Perimeter from the west. Oka had some intelligence on the layout of U.S. Marine defenses, provided by a <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Army_9bfc.html" title="United States Army">U.S. Army</a> pilot captured on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_30.html" title="August 30">August 30</a>.<sup id="_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#_note-29" title="">[30]</a></sup></p>
<p>During the day of <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_12.html" title="September 12">September 12</a>, Kawaguchi's troops struggled through the jungle to reach their assembly points for that night's attacks. Kawaguchi wanted his three Center Body battalions in place by 14:00 hours that day. The center body battalions, however, didn't reach their assembly areas until after 22:00 hours. Oka was also delayed in his advance towards the Marine lines in the west. Only the Kuma battalion reported that they were in place on time. In spite of the problems in reaching the planned attack positions, Kawaguchi still felt confident in his attack plan because a captured U.S. pilot disclosed that the ridge where the Japanese were planning their main attack was the weakest part of the U.S. Marine defenses.<sup id="_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#_note-30" title="">[31]</a></sup></p>

<p>The U.S. Marines knew of the approach of the Japanese forces, but didn't know exactly where or when they would attack. The ridge around which Edson deployed his men consisted of three distinct hillocks. At the southern tip and surrounded on three sides by thick jungle was Hill 80 (so named because it rose 80 feet above sea level). Six-hundred yards north was Hill 123 (likewise named for its height in feet above sea level), the dominant feature on the ridge. The northernmost hillock was unnamed and about 60 feet high. Edson placed the five companies from the Raider battalion on the west side of the ridge and the three Parachute battalion companies on the east side, holding positions in depth from Hill 80 back to Hill 123. Two of the five Raider companies, "B" and "C", held a line between the ridge, a small, swampy lagoon, and the Lunga River. Edson placed his command post on Hill 123.<sup id="_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#_note-31" title="">[32]</a></sup></p>
<p>At 21:30 hours on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_12.html" title="September 12">September 12</a>, the Japanese cruiser <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japanese_cruiser_Sendai_46df.html" title="Japanese cruiser Sendai"><i>Sendai</i></a> and three destroyers shelled the Lunga perimeter for 20 minutes. Japanese artillery also began shelling the Marine lines, but without doing much damage. At this same time, scattered groups of Kawaguchi's troops began skirmishing with Marines around the ridge. Kawaguchi's 1st Battalion, led by <a href="../../../m/a/j/Major.html" title="Major">Major</a> Yukichi Kukusho, attacked the Raider's "C" company between the lagoon and the Lunga River, overrunning at least one platoon, and forcing the Marine company to fall back to the ridge. Kukusho's unit now became entangled with troops from Kawaguchi's 3rd Battalion under <a href="../../../l/i/e/Lieutenant_Colonel_7041.html" title="Lieutenant Colonel">Lieutenant Colonel</a> Kusunichi Watanabe, who were still struggling to reach their attack positions, and the resulting confusion effectively stopped the Japanese attack on the ridge that night. Kawaguchi, who himself was having trouble locating where he was in relation to the U.S. Marine lines as well as coordinating his troops' attacks, later complained, "Due to the devilish jungle, the brigade was scattered all over and was completely beyond my control. In my whole life I have never felt so disappointed and helpless." Twelve (12) U.S. Marines were killed in the night's action while Japanese casualties are unknown but perhaps somewhat greater.<sup id="_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#_note-32" title="">[33]</a></sup> Although both Oka in the west and the Kuma unit in the east tried to attack the Marine lines that night, they failed to make contact and halted near the Marine lines at dawn.<sup id="_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#_note-33" title="">[34]</a></sup></p>
<p>At first light on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_13.html" title="September 13">September 13</a>, Cactus Air Force aircraft and Marine artillery fired into the area just south of the ridge, forcing any Japanese still out in the open to quickly seek cover in the nearby jungle and causing some casualties to the Japanese units, including two officers killed in Watanabe's battalion. At 05:50 hours, Kawaguchi decided to regroup his forces for another attack that night.<sup id="_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#_note-34" title="">[35]</a></sup></p>

<p>Expecting the Japanese to attack again that night, Edson directed his troops to improve their defenses on and around the ridge. After a failed attempt by two Raider companies to retake the ground on Edson's right flank lost to Kokusho the night before, Edson repositioned his forces. He pulled his front back about 400 yards to a line that stretched 1,800 yards, starting at the Lunga River and crossing the ridge about 150 yards south of Hill 123. Around and behind Hill 123 he placed five companies. Any Japanese attackers surmounting Hill 80 would have to advance over 400 yards of open terrain to close with the Marine positions at Hill 123. With only a few hours to prepare, the Marines were only able to construct rudimentary and shallow fortifications. Also, the Marines were low on ammunition, with one or two <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hand_grenade.html" title="Hand grenade">grenades</a> for each Marine. Vandegrift ordered a reserve force consisting of the <a href="../../../2/n/d/2nd_Battalion_5th_Marines_d35a.html" title="2nd Battalion 5th Marines">2nd Battalion, 5th Marine Regiment</a> (2/5) to move into a position just to the rear of Edson's troops. In addition, a battery (four guns) of <a href="../../../m/1/0/M101_howitzer.html" title="M101 howitzer">105mm howitzers</a> moved to a location from which it could provide direct fire onto the ridge and a forward artillery observer was placed with Edson's front line units.<sup id="_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="#_note-35" title="">[36]</a></sup></p>
<p>Late in the afternoon, Edson stepped onto a grenade box and addressed his exhausted troops, saying,</p>
<dl>
<dd>"You men have done a great job, and I have just one more thing to ask of you. Hold out just one more night. I know we've been without sleep a long time. But we expect another attack from them tonight and they may come through here. I have every reason to believe that we will have reliefs here for all of us in the morning."<sup id="_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="#_note-36" title="">[37]</a></sup></dd>
</dl>
<p>Edson's speech "raised the spirits" of the Raiders and helped them prepare mentally for the night ahead.<sup id="_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#_note-37" title="">[38]</a></sup></p>

</div>
</div>
<p>As the sun set on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_13.html" title="September 13">September 13</a>, Kawaguchi faced Edson's 830 Raiders with 3,000 troops of his brigade, plus an assorment of light artillery. The Japanese attack began just after nightfall, with Kokusho's battalion assaulting Edson's Company B on the Raider's right flank, just to the west of the ridge. The force of the assault caused the Marine company to fall back to Hill 123. Under Marine artillery fire, Kokusho reassembled his men and continued his assault. Without pausing to try to "roll-up" the other nearby Marine units, whose flanks were now unprotected, Kokusho's unit surged forward through the swampy lowlands between the ridge and the Lunga River, heading for the airfield. Kokusho's men came upon a pile of Marine supplies and rations, and, not having eaten adequately for a couple of days, paused to "gorge themselves" on the <a href="../../../c/-/r/C-ration.html" title="C-ration">"C"</a> and <a href="../../../k/-/r/K-ration.html" title="K-ration">"K" rations</a>. After ordering the attack to continue, Kokusho led his men in an assault on Marine units manning the area around the northern portion of the ridge, just short of the airfield, at about 03:00 hours in the morning. In the heavy fighting that followed, Kokusho and around 100 men in his battalion were killed, ending Kokusho's assault.<sup id="_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#_note-38" title="">[39]</a></sup></p>
<p>Meanwhile, the men of Kawaguchi's 2nd Battalion, under Major Masao Tamura, were assembling for their planned assault against Hill 80 from the jungle south of the ridge. Marine observers spotted Tamura's soldier's preparations and called for artillery support, which arrived about 22:00 hours as a barrage from twelve 105 mm artillery cannons. In response, two companies of Tamura's troops, numbering about 320 men, charged up Hill 80 with fixed <a href="../../../b/a/y/Bayonet.html" title="Bayonet">bayonets</a> behind their own barrage of mortar fire and grenades. Tamura's attack hit Company B of the Marine Parachute battalion and Company B of the Raiders, pushing the Parachutists off the east side of the ridge into a draw below the ridgeline. To protect the now exposed Raider Company B, Edson immediately ordered them to pull back onto Hill 123.<sup id="_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#_note-39" title="">[40]</a></sup></p>
<p>At the same time, a Japanese company from Watanabe's battalion infiltrated through a gap between the east side of the ridge and Parachute Company C. Deciding that their positions were now untenable, Parachute Companies B and C then climbed onto the ridge and retreated to a position behind Hill 123. After arriving behind Hill 123, some of the Marines continued on towards the airfield, repeating the word "withdraw" to anyone within earshot. Other Marines began to follow them. Just at the moment that it appeared that the Marines on the hill were about to break and head for the rear in a rout, Marine Major <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kenneth_D._Bailey_d201.html" title="Kenneth D. Bailey">Kenneth D. Bailey</a> from Edson's staff appeared and, with "vivid" language, herded the Marines back into defensive positions around Hill 123.<sup id="_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="#_note-40" title="">[41]</a></sup></p>

</div>
<p>As the Marines formed into a horseshoe shaped line around Hill 123, Tamura's battalion began a series of frontal assaults on the hill, charging up the saddle from Hill 80 and up from below the east side of the ridge. Under the light of parachute flares dropped by at least one Japanese floatplane, the Marines repulsed the first two attacks by Tamura's men. Tamura's troops hoisted a <a href="../../../t/y/p/Type_41_75_mm_Mountain_Gun_dd77.html" title="Type 41 75 mm Mountain Gun">75mm "regimental" gun</a> to the top of Hill 80 in an effort to fire it directly at the Marines. This gun, which "could have turned the tide in favor of the Japanese," however, had a faulty firing pin that made it unable to shoot. At midnight, during a short lull in the fighting, Edson brought forward Parachute Companies B and C from behind Hill 123 to strengthen his left flank. Marines from other units, as well as members of Edson's command staff, including Major Bailey, brought forward ammunition and grenades under fire to the Marines around Hill 123 as they began to run critically low.<sup id="_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="#_note-41" title="">[42]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Japanese hit Edson's left flank just after the Parachutists took position but were again stopped by Marine rifle, machine-gun, mortar, and grenade fire. The Marine 105 mm artillery was also taking a heavy toll on the attacking Japanese. A captured Japanese soldier later said that his unit was "annihilated" by the Marine artillery fire, from which only 10 percent of his company survived.<sup id="_ref-42" class="reference"><a href="#_note-42" title="">[43]</a></sup> By 04:00 hours, after withstanding several more assaults, some of which resulted in hand-to-hand fighting, as well as severe sniper fire from all sides, Edson's men were joined by troops from the 2nd Battalion, 5th Marine Regiment who helped repulse two more Japanese attacks before dawn. Throughout the night, as the Marines were brought by Kawaguchi's men "to the knife edge of defeat," Edson remained standing about 20 yards behind the Marine firing line on Hill 123, exhorting his troops and directing their defensive efforts.<sup id="_ref-43" class="reference"><a href="#_note-43" title="">[44]</a></sup></p>
<p>During the heavy fighting, portions of three Japanese companies, including two from Tamura's and one from Watanabe's battalions, skirted the Marine defenses on the ridge, while taking heavy losses from Marine gunfire, and reached the edge of "Fighter One," a secondary runway of Henderson Field. A counterattack by the Marine <a href="../../../1/s/t/1st_Combat_Engineer_Battalion_211d.html" title="1st Combat Engineer Battalion">engineers</a> stopped one of the Japanese company's advances, forcing it to retreat. The other two Japanese companies waited at the edge of the jungle for reinforcements to arrive before attempting to attack into the open area around the airfield. When no reinforcements joined them, both companies "exfiltrated" back to their original positions south of the ridge after daybreak. Due to losing contact with their commander during the night, most of the rest of Watanabe's battalion did not participate in the battle.</p>
<p>As the sun rose on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_14.html" title="September 14">September 14</a>, pockets of Japanese soldiers remained scattered along both sides of the ridge. But, with Tamura's battalion shattered, having lost three-quarters of its officers and men, and with heavy casualties to his other attacking units as well, Kawaguchi's assault on the ridge had effectively ended. About 100 Japanese soldiers still remained in the open on the south slope of Hill 80, perhaps preparing for one more charge on Hill 123. At first light, three U.S. Army fighter aircraft from Henderson Field strafed the Japanese near Hill 80, and "massacred" them, with the few survivors retreating back into the jungle.<sup id="_ref-44" class="reference"><a href="#_note-44" title="">[45]</a></sup></p>

<p>As the battle on the ridge took place, Kawaguchi's Kuma and Oka units also attacked the Marine defenses on the east and west sides of the Lunga perimeter. The Kuma battalion, led by Major Takeshi Mizuno, attacked the southeastern sector of the Lunga perimeter, defended by Marines of the <a href="../../../3/r/d/3rd_Battalion_1st_Marines_21d9.html" title="3rd Battalion 1st Marines">3rd Battalion, 1st Marine Regiment</a> (3/1). Mizuno's attack started around midnight, with one company attacking through Marine artillery fire and engaging in hand-to-hand combat with the Marine defenders before being thrown back. Mizuno himself was killed in the attack. After daybreak, the Marines, believing that the rest of Mizuno's battalion was still in the area, sent forward six <a href="../../../s/t/u/Stuart_tank.html" title="Stuart tank">light tanks</a> to sweep the area in front of the Marine lines. Four Japanese 37 mm anti-tank guns opened fire on the tanks, destroying or disabling three of them. One other tank tumbled down an embankment into the Tenaru River, drowning the tank's crew.<sup id="_ref-45" class="reference"><a href="#_note-45" title="">[46]</a></sup> At 23:00 hours on the 14th, the remnants of the Kuma battalion conducted another attack on the same portion of the Marine lines, but were repulsed. A final "weak" attack by the Kuma unit on the evening of the 15th was also defeated.<sup id="_ref-46" class="reference"><a href="#_note-46" title="">[47]</a></sup></p>
<p>Oka's unit, numbering about 650 men, attacked the Marines at several locations on the west side of the Lunga perimeter. About 04:00 hours on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_14.html" title="September 14">September 14</a>, two Japanese companies attacked positions held by the <a href="../../../3/r/d/3rd_Battalion_5th_Marines_2271.html" title="3rd Battalion 5th Marines">3rd Battalion, 5th Marine Regiment</a> (3/5) near the coast and were thrown back with heavy losses. Another Japanese company captured a small ridge somewhat inland, but was then pinned-down by Marine artillery fire throughout the day and took heavy losses before withdrawing on the evening of the 14th. The rest of Oka's unit failed to find the Marine lines and didn't participate in the attack.<sup id="_ref-47" class="reference"><a href="#_note-47" title="">[48]</a></sup></p>

<p>At 13:05 hours on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_14.html" title="September 14">September 14</a>, Kawaguchi led the survivors of his shattered brigade away from the ridge and deeper into the jungle, where they rested and tended to their wounded all day on the 15th. Kawaguchi's units were then ordered to withdraw west to the <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matanikau_River_fc04.html" title="Matanikau River">Matanikau River</a> valley to join with Oka's unit, a six-mile march "over some of the worst terrain on the island." Kawaguchi's troops began the march on the morning of <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_16.html" title="September 16">September 16</a>.<sup id="_ref-48" class="reference"><a href="#_note-48" title="">[49]</a></sup> Almost every soldier able to walk had to help carry the wounded. As the march progressed, the exhausted and hungry soldiers, who had eaten their last rations on the 14th, began to discard their heavy equipment and then their rifles. By the time most of them reached Oka's positions at Kokumbona five days later, only half still carried their weapons. The Kuma battalion's survivors, attempting to follow Kawaguchi's Center Body forces, became lost and wandered for three weeks in the jungle and almost starved to death before finally reaching Kawaguchi's camp.<sup id="_ref-49" class="reference"><a href="#_note-49" title="">[50]</a></sup></p>
<p>In total, Kawaguchi's forces lost about 830 killed in the attack, including 350 in Tamura's battalion, 200 in Kokusho's battalion, 120 in Oka's force, 100 in the Kuma battalion, and 60 killed in Watanabe's battalion. A further, but unknown number of wounded died during the withdrawal march to the Matanikau. On and around the ridge, the Marines counted 500 Japanese dead, including 200 on the slopes of Hill 123. The Marines suffered 80 killed between <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_12.html" title="September 12">September 12</a> and 14.<sup id="_ref-50" class="reference"><a href="#_note-50" title="">[51]</a></sup></p>
<p>On <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_17.html" title="September 17">September 17</a>, Vandegrift sent two companies from the <a href="../../../1/s/t/1st_Battalion_1st_Marines_806c.html" title="1st Battalion 1st Marines">1st Battalion, 1st Marine Regiment</a> (1/1) to pursue the retreating Japanese. The Marines were ambushed by two Japanese companies acting as rear-guards for the withdrawal and one Marine platoon was pinned-down as the rest of the Marines retreated. The Marine company commander requested permission to attempt to rescue his platoon, but was denied by Vandegrift. By nightfall, the Japanese overran and nearly annihilated the platoon, killing 24 Marines with only a few wounded members of the platoon surviving. On <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_20.html" title="September 20">September 20</a>, a patrol from Edson's Raiders encountered stragglers from Kawaguchi's retreating column and killed 19 of them with called-in artillery fire.<sup id="_ref-51" class="reference"><a href="#_note-51" title="">[52]</a></sup></p>
<p>As the Japanese regrouped west of the Matanikau, the U.S. forces concentrated on shoring up and strengthening their Lunga defenses. On <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_14.html" title="September 14">September 14</a>, Vandegrift moved another battalion, the <a href="../../../3/r/d/3rd_Battalion_2nd_Marines_3f68.html" title="3rd Battalion 2nd Marines">3rd Battalion, 2nd Marine Regiment</a> (3/2), from Tulagi to Guadalcanal. On <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_18.html" title="September 18">September 18</a>, an Allied naval convoy delivered 4,157 men from the 3rd Provisional Marine Brigade (the <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._7th_Marine_Regiment_c9d2.html" title="U.S. 7th Marine Regiment">U.S. 7th Marine Regiment</a> augmented by additional support units) to Guadalcanal. These reinforcements allowed Vandegrift, beginning on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_19.html" title="September 19">September 19</a>, to establish an unbroken line of defense completely around the Lunga perimeter.

<p>On <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_15.html" title="September 15">September 15</a>, General Hyakutake at Rabaul learned of Kawaguchi's defeat, the Imperial Japanese Army's first defeat involving a unit of this size in the war. The "shocked" general forwarded the news to the Imperial General Headquarters in Japan. In an emergency session, the top Japanese army and navy command staffs concluded that, "Guadalcanal might develop into the decisive battle of the war." The results of the battle now began to have a telling strategic impact on Japanese operations in other areas of the Pacific. Hyakutake realized that in order to send sufficient troops and materiel to defeat the Allied forces on Guadalcanal, he could no longer at the same time support the major Japanese offensive currently ongoing on the <a href="../../../k/o/k/Kokoda_Track_campaign_444f.html" title="Kokoda Track campaign">Kokoda Track</a> in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Guinea_eecc.html" title="New Guinea">New Guinea</a>. Hyakutake, with the concurrence of the General Headquarters, ordered his troops on New Guinea, who were within 30-miles of their objective of <a href="../../../p/o/r/Port_Moresby_df51.html" title="Port Moresby">Port Moresby</a>, to withdraw until the "Guadalcanal matter" was resolved. The Japanese never were able to restart their drive towards Port Moresby. Thus, the defeat at Edson's Ridge not only contributed to Japan's ultimate defeat in the Guadalcanal campaign, but also to Japan's ultimate defeat throughout the South Pacific.<sup id="_ref-53" class="reference"><a href="#_note-53" title="">[54]</a></sup></p>
<p>After delivering more forces during the next month, the next major Japanese ground offensive on Guadalcanal, led by Hyakutake himself, occurred in late October 1942 at the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_for_Henderson_Field_b4e5.html" title="Battle for Henderson Field">Battle for Henderson Field</a>, but resulted in an even more decisive defeat for the Japanese. Vandegrift later stated that Kawaguchi's assault on the ridge in September was the only time during the entire campaign he had doubts about the outcome and, that had it succeeded, "we would have been in a pretty bad condition."<sup id="_ref-54" class="reference"><a href="#_note-54" title="">[55]</a></sup> Historian Richard B. Frank adds:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"The Japanese never came closer to victory on the island itself than in September 1942, on a ridge thrusting up from the jungle just south of the critical airfield, best known ever after as Bloody Ridge."<sup id="_ref-55" class="reference"><a href="#_note-55" title="">[56]</a></sup></dd>
