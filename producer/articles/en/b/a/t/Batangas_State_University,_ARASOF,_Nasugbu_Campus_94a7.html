<p>A thorough analysis of the development trends in the agriculture and fisheries-based industries and education sector was made to provide valuable insights in the probable composition and structure, growth patterns, attendant skills and expertise requirements of the industry. Consequently, the College feels that there has to be a progressive realignment in program thrusts in all higher institution of learning in fisheries and allied disciplines to stall the drift of this sector of the educational system into irrelevance and more importantly, to match output with the current and foreseeable skills and expertise requirements of marine based industries. As its response to the current and foreseeable training and expertise requirement of its service sectors, the College humbly presents the CAREER FORMATION PROGRAM – a package of professional and sub-professional courses in agriculture and fisheries that offers opportunities for productive careers in the agro-fishery sectors of the Philippine economy.</p>
