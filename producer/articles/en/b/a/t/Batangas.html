<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/t/Batangas.html" title="Edit section: Name">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Name</span></h2>
<p>The first recorded name of the Province was <b>Kumintang</b>. Later, the Spaniards went to settle the present day <a href="../../../b/a/l/Balayan.html" title="Balayan">Balayan</a>, then the most progressive town of the Province. The name of the Province was changed into <b>Bonbon</b>.</p>
<p>Some time later, the capital of the province was transferred to <a href="../../../t/a/a/Taal.html" title="Taal">Taal</a>, since being near the lake, it is an easy commercial centre. After the transfer, the leaders of the province decided to change the name of the province after its capital.</p>
<p>Still later, the Spaniards chose to transfer the capital for the third time, now in its present capital the Town of Batangan. later Batangas City, and the Province changed its name once more after the Capital. in 1889, Batangas City became the country's 8th city.</p>
<p>The term <i>batangan</i> means a raft, the people used so that they could fish in the nearby Taal Lake.</p>
<p>The name "Batangas" was derived from the word "batang," which is a term of the natives for the numerous <a href="../../../l/o/g/Log.html" title="Log">logs</a> found in the Calumpang River, the body of water that runs through the northeastern portion of the town and assumes the shape of a tuning fork.</p>
<p>the term <i><b>Batangueño</b></i> or <i><b>Batangueña</b></i> generally is an adjective that describes something or someone from Batangas. However, in the recent revival of provincial identitity among the natives of Batangas, these terms is more commonly being used nowadays to mean at native of the province. On the other hand, the old term <i><b>Batangan</b></i> is being revived to describe something that is of Batangas flavour.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/t/Batangas.html" title="Edit section: People">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">People</span></h2>
<p>Batangas is the 'Heart of the <a href="../../../t/a/g/Tagalog_language.html" title="Tagalog language">Tagalog</a> Language' as the dialect of Tagalog spoken here closely resembles the Tagalog spoken before the arrival of the Spanish. Therefore, a strong presence of the <a href="../../../t/a/g/Tagalog.html" title="Tagalog">Tagalog</a> Culture is clearly visible until now.</p>
<p>Linguistically Batangueños are also known for their unique affectation of often placing the particles <i>eh</i> or <i>ga</i> (equivalent of particle <i>ba</i> <a href="../../../f/i/l/Filipino_language.html" title="Filipino language">Filipino</a>), usually as a marker of stress on the sentence, at the end of their spoken sentences or speech; for example: "Ay, oo, eh!" ("Aye, yes, indeed!"). Some even prolong the particle 'eh' into 'ala eh', though it really has no meaning in itself.</p>
<p>In the recent years, waves of migration from the Visayas had brought significant number of Visayans to the province. There are also a few who can speak Spanish, since Batangas was an important centre during the colonial period.</p>
<p>The province of Batangas also has one of the highest literacy rates in the country at 96.5%, wherein the males have a little higher literacy rate at 97.1% than females with 95.9%.</p>
<p><a name="Culture" id="Culture"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/t/Batangas.html" title="Edit section: Culture">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Culture</span></h2>
<p>Maria Kalaw Katigbak, a <a href="../../../f/i/l/Filipino_people.html" title="Filipino people">Filipino</a> <a href="../../../h/i/s/Historian.html" title="Historian">historian</a>, was quoted to call the Batangueños the <i>Super-<a href="../../../t/a/g/Tagalog.html" title="Tagalog">Tagalogs</a></i>. This is because these group of people belonging to the <a href="../../../t/a/g/Tagalog.html" title="Tagalog">Tagalog</a> stock is the paramount example of what one can expect from this <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethnolinguistic.html" title="Ethnolinguistic">ethnolinguistic</a> group. And indeed, when you ask someone to overact a Tagalog, they would imitate the Batangueños.</p>
<p>One particular custom in the Batangan culture is the so called <i>Matanda sa Dugo</i> (lit. <i>older by blood</i>) practice wherein one gives respect not because of age but of consanguinity. During the early times, the custom of having very large families are very common. Thus, it may be expected that the someone's uncle could be of the same age, or even younger than himself. In this case, the older one would call the younger one in an honorary title (such as <i>tiyo</i> or simply <i>kuya</i> if they can no longer establish the relationship), not the other way around. This often draws confusion to those from other provinces who are not accustomed to such practices.</p>
<p>Batangueños are very regionalistic. When one learns that a person in the room is also from Batangas, expect them to be together until the end of the event. It is also expected that those in office would favour their fellow Batangueños as long as the rules could allow it. Thus the running joke, the <i>Batangas <a href="../../../m/a/f/Mafia.html" title="Mafia">Mafia</a></i> came to existence.</p>
<p>They also tend to live in a large extended family. It is but common that a piece of land remains undivided until the family connection becomes to far-off related. Marriages between relatives of the fifth generation is still restrained in the Batangan culture even if <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philippines.html" title="Philippines">Philippine</a> laws allow it.</p>
<p>Most Batangueños are either farmers or fishers who sell their own products in the market. Although most of them has also finished a degree, a lot of the people not to use what they have studied and put up their own small businesses instead. This is perhaps due to the subconscious idea that he who has no land to cultivate or trade to make is a lazy person.</p>
<p>Since Batangas has long been declared a tourism area by late <a href="../../../p/r/e/President_of_the_Philippines_ad58.html" title="President of the Philippines">President</a> <a href="../../../f/e/r/Ferdinand_Marcos_0f3a.html" title="Ferdinand Marcos">Ferdinand Marcos</a>, people from other places could find a very hospitable culture in the Batangueños. They will feed you more than the usual with the food they eat. Actually, these folks would appreciate it greatly if they see that you are trying to be one of them.</p>
<p>Batangueños are heavy drinkers. Men, and sometimes women, could spend long hours of drinking sessions as if there would be no more work the next day. This is specially true if you are to visit the far-flung <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barangay.html" title="Barangay">barangays</a>.</p>
<p>Aside from drinking too much liquor, Batangueños like sweet food. Perhaps this is because there has never been a shortage of sugar in the province due to the presence of the Central Azucarera Don Pedro, the current largest producer of sugar in the whole archipelago.</p>
<p>And if they like their liquors strong and their foods sweet, Batangueños also like their coffee strong. During the early 1900s, Batangas was the largest producer of <a href="../../../c/o/f/Coffee.html" title="Coffee">coffee</a> in the whole of <a href="../../../a/s/i/Asia.html" title="Asia">Asia</a>. In the barrios, the people would drink brewed coffee, which the locals call <i>kapeng barako</i>, translated as the <i>stud's coffee</i>. At present, steps are being made, especially in the city of <a href="../../../l/i/p/Lipa_City_e3cb.html" title="Lipa City">Lipa</a> to regain the title of having the largest coffee production in <a href="../../../a/s/i/Asia.html" title="Asia">Asia</a>.</p>

<p>Perhaps, there is no better way to describe a Batangueño than the language he speaks. Batangueños, being mainly descendants of the ancient Tagalogs, speak a dialect of the language with a very strong accent. Indeed, one can easily recognize a Batangueño the moment he opens his mouth.</p>
<p>Though generally intelligible to speakers of other dialects, such as the Manila and Tayabas dialects, the vocabulary of the Batangan Dialect is more closely related to the ancient Tagalog. Rarely do Batangueños use Taglish, as the custom in Manila. In fact, when you ask someone from the Komisyon sa Wikang Filipino to describe the Tagalog spoken in Batangas, it will easily be labelled 'makaluma' (old style.)</p>
<p>Although much can be said about the way a Batangueño speaks his Tagalog, the high literacy of the locals means English is also widely spoken in the province. Spanish is also understood up to some extent. In fact, some towns like <a href="../../../n/a/s/Nasugbu%2C_Batangas_fe4d.html" title="Nasugbu, Batangas">Nasugbu</a> and Lemery still have a significant minority of Spanish speakers. <a href="../../../c/e/b/Cebuano_language.html" title="Cebuano language">Visayan</a> is also spoken by a significant minority due to the infulx of migration from the Southern Philippines.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/t/Batangas.html" title="Edit section: Mythology and Literature">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Mythology and Literature</span></h2>
<p>According to scholars, the mythology of Batangas is closely related to the mythology of the <a href="../../../o/a/x/Oaxaca.html" title="Oaxaca">Oaxacan</a> Tribe of Mexico. A clear proof is the presence of story '<b>Why the Firefly is Noisy?'</b> and '<b>The Race of the Carabao and Tortoise'</b>, both having their counterparts in Mexico.</p>
<p>Scholars also identified that the ancient Batangueños, like the rest of the Tagalog Tribe, worship the Supreme Creator, known as <a href="../../../b/a/t/Bathala.html" title="Bathala">Bathala</a>. Lesser gods like <a href="../../../m/a/y/Mayari.html" title="Mayari">Mayari</a>, the goddess of the Moon and her brother Apolake, god of the sun, were also present. And although people would not easily connect it with mythology, the Northeast Monsoon is still called Amihan, while the Southwest Monsoon is called Habagat.</p>
<p>For literature, Padre Vicente Garcia came to be known when he wrote an essay to defend <a href="../../../j/o/s/Jos%C3%A9_Rizal_0282.html" title="José Rizal">José Rizal</a>'s <a href="../../../n/o/l/Noli_Me_Tangere_a762.html" title="Noli Me Tangere">Noli Me Tangere</a>.</p>
<p>In 2004, the Province of Batangas gave its Son Domingo Landicho (familiarly called Inggo be Batangueños) the '<i><b>Dangal ng Batangas Award'</b></i> (Pride of Batangas) for being the '<b>Peoples' Poet'</b>. He, together with Ambassador Lauro Baja, former Executive secretary <a href="../../../r/e/n/Renato_de_Villa_8989.html" title="Renato de Villa">Renato de Villa</a>, Current Executive Secretary Eduardo Ermita, Supreme Court Justice <a href="../../../r/e/n/Renato_Corona_73dc.html" title="Renato Corona">Renato Corona</a>, and Transport Secretary Leandro Mendoza received the award in a ceremony which highlighted the celebration of the 423rd year of the founding of the Province.</p>

<p>When a foreigner visits the Philippines, he always remark on how musical the Filipinos are. The Batangueños are no exception. Batangueños have always been visible in the Philippine music scene, whether it is in the field of traditional music, popular music or even popular music.</p>
<p>Musicologists identified Batangas as the origin of the <b>kumintang</b>, and ancient war song, which later evolved to become the signature of Filipino love songs the <b>kundiman</b>. From the ancient kumintang, another vocal music emerged, identified as the <b>awit</b>. The <b>huluna</b>, a psalm-like lullaby, is also famous in some towns, especially Bauan. And during the Lenten Season, the Christian passion-narrative, called <b>Pasyon</b> by the natives, is but expected in every corners of the province.</p>
<p>Debates may also be done while singing. While those from the Province of Bulacan are known for their <b>Balagatasan</b> (a form of debate done in poetry), Batangueños are famous for the <b>duplo</b> (a sung debate where each lines of the verse must be octosyllabic) and the <b>karagatan</b> (a sung dabate where each lines of the verse must be dodecasyllabic.) The latter, whose literal meaning is the <b>ocean</b>, got its name from the opening lines. Always, the karagatan is opened by saying some verses that alludes the depth of the sea and comparing it to the difficulty of joining the debate. And as mentioned above, the debate must be sung.</p>
<p>Batangas is also the origin of the <b>Balitao</b> (although Cebuanos may argue.) Aside from being a form of vocal music, the Balitao is also a form of dance music. The Balitao, together with the <b>Subli</b> is the most famous form of dance native to Batangas.</p>
<p>In the field of serious music, no one can underestimate the contribution of Batangas. Batangas is the birthplace of the famous Filipino <a href="../../../s/o/p/Soprano.html" title="Soprano">soprano</a> <b>Conching Rosal</b>, dubbed as the First Lady of the Philippine Operatic Stage. <b>Lorenzo Ilustre</b>, a local composer, also became famous for his wide array of religious and liturgical music.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the Maestro of Philippine Music, <a href="../../../r/y/a/Ryan_Cayabyab_c372.html" title="Ryan Cayabyab">Ryan Cayabyab</a> is no less than a Batangueño, whose mother Celerina Pujante was in her own right a well sought operatic <a href="../../../s/o/p/Soprano.html" title="Soprano">soprano</a> in the <a href="../../../1/9/5/1950.html" title="1950">1950</a>'s, about the same time as Rosal. Ogie Alcasid, known to fans as Mr. Composer, also hails from this province.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/t/Batangas.html" title="Edit section: The Batangueña">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Batangueña</span></h2>
<p>The Batangueña is the subject of numerous traditional songs from Batangas. Perhaps the most famous of all is the '<b>Princesa ng Kumintang'</b>, which tells about the pursuit of a very beautiful woman. The singer sings:</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>Kay ganda mo hirang, Princesa ng Kumintang!</b></dd>
<dd>(<i>How lovely art thou, my Dear, Princess of the Kumintang</i>)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><b>Sa ala-ala ko ay di ka mapaparam.</b></dd>
<dd>(<i>In my memory, thou canst be effaced.</i>)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><b>Sa kalungkutan ko'y tanglaw ka ng aking buhay,</b></dd>
<dd>(<i>To my sorrow, thou art the guiding life of life,</i>)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><b>Ang iyong pagsinta'y langit ko, Princesa ng Kumintang!</b></dd>
<dd>(<i>Thine love is my heaven, Princess of the Kumintang!</i>)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Another song, the '<b>Mutyang Batangas'</b>, says that she is a pearl that is as beautiful as the and whose love is pure. However, she hates a lazy man, who always gambles and drinks because this would mean that she will be a battered wife. In the second part of the song, the singer says that you cannot easily fool her. She may appear dainty but she's fearless if she would need to protect her purity. The lyrics go like this:</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>Ang Mutyang Batangas, sing-ganda ng Rosas</b></dd>
<dd>(<i>The Pearl of Batangas, as lovely as the Rose</i>)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><b>Pag-ibig sa puso niya ay wagas</b></dd>
<dd>(<i>The love of her heart is pure.</i>)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Then the lady replies what she hates from a man:</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>Ayaw na ayaw ko sa lalaking tamad, sugarol at lasinggero at nambubugbog</b></dd>
<dd>(<i>Oh! Indeed I detest a man who is lazy, a gambler, a drunkard and a batterer</i>)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><b>Pagdating sa kanila, pabalibaligtad, ang pobreng asawa ang siyang binababag</b></dd>
<dd>(<i>When he comes home, he justs lies on the floor, and the poor wife is being battered</i>)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Then the singer sings of her virtues again saying:</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>Ngunit ang mga Mutyang Taga-Batangas, di maloloko ng ganyan</b></dd>
<dd>(<i>However, the Pearl from Batangas is not easiliy fooled</i>)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><b>Mahinhin ngunit Ay! Matapang sa pagtatanggol sa karangalan.</b></dd>
<dd>(<i>She is dainty by she is also fearles when she's to defend her honour</i>)</dd>
</dl>
<p>On the other hand, the song simply entitled '<b>Batangueña'</b> says that should someone want to find happiness, he would simply has to choose a Batangueña for a wife. This is because she always is dainty and would be with you no matter how hard life would become. The song progresses by saying that her smiles would bring you hope. she's a beautiful pearl, who loves purely. she is likened to a bright star, even though her heart is breaking. However, the common warning is that you must be careful not to make a fool of her or you'll end up with trouble.</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>Batangueña, Mutyang Marilag, sa pagsuyo ang puso'y tapat</b></dd>
<dd>(<i>Batangueña, a Beautiful Pearl, her Heart is true for the one she loves</i>)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><b>Katulad niya'y talang nagniningning, kahit na ang puso ay naninimdim</b></dd>
<dd>(<i>she is like a star shining brightly even though her heart is breaking</i>)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><b>Lagi nang may panghalina sa pagsinta</b></dd>
<dd>(<i>Always has she a charm for lovers</i>)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><b>Kung ang hanap mo ay ligaya umibig na sa Babaeng Batangueña</b></dd>
<dd>(<i>If it is bliss that you are searching for, go on be a lover to the Batangueña</i>)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><b>Ngunit huwag kang magkakasala, magsalawahan at mapapahamak ka</b></dd>
<dd>(<i>However, don't you dare sin against her, be an adulterer and you will soon be in trouble</i>)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><b>May taglay na hinhin sa twina at matiisin kahit na nagdurusa</b></dd>
<dd>(<i>Forever is she sweet-mannered and she'll not complain even if she's having pain in her heart</i>)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><b>May ngiti ng sigla at pag-asa, yan ang Dalagang Batangueña</b></dd>
<dd>(<i>A smile and hope she'll have forever, that is the Batangueña Maiden</i>)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Until now, the role of the Batangueña is never secondary. While the men are the ones in charge of governance and other related matters, the women are the queen of the homes. She will always have the final say on all domestic matter. And no one would dare revoke the woman's words.</p>
<p>During the ancient times, a form of government called gynecocracy was believed to be prevalent in Batangas. Women had equal rights to succession should there be no male to lead the clan. This practice is clearly seen until now, wherein strong family clans tend to be more matriarchal in character.</p>
<p>Today, the wife of the town or city mayor is called the <i>Mayora</i>. And whenever the mayor is not around, the mayora is expected to do his duties.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/t/Batangas.html" title="Edit section: Architecture and Sculpture">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Architecture and Sculpture</span></h2>
<p>As shown in its ancient churches, Batangas is home to some of the best architectures of the country. Along with <a href="../../../v/i/g/Vigan_City_920f.html" title="Vigan City">Vigan City</a>, <a href="../../../i/l/o/Ilocos_Sur_c66f.html" title="Ilocos Sur">Ilocos Sur</a>, Batangas has the best preserved colonial architectures. This is very evident when one visits the Municipality of Lemery.</p>
<p>Though not as popular as the carving industry of Laguna, Batangas is still famous for the sculptures engraved on the countless furniture that came from their Province. Often, altar tables coming from Batangas was called the <b>friars' choice</b> because of its delicate beauty.</p>
<p>According to Milagros Covvarubias-Jamir, another Filipino scholar, the furniture that came from Batangas during the colonial times was comparable to the beautiful furniture from China. The built of the furniture was so exquisite, nails of glues was never used. Still, the Batangueños knew how to maximize the use of hardwoods. As a result, furniture made about a hundred years ago are still found in many old churches and houses even today.</p>

</div>
<p>Aside from tourism, Batangas also has other industries that makes it famous not only in the country but also in the world. More than anything else, Batangas is known for its fan knife, called <b><a href="../../../b/a/l/Balisong_%28knife%29.html" title="Balisong (knife)">balisong</a></b> by the natives. This industry has become so famous that an <a href="../../../u/r/b/Urban_legend.html" title="Urban legend">urban legend</a> exists about every Batangueño carrying a <i>balisong</i> everywhere he goes. This is also the reason why most Filipinos would warn you never to mess with a Batangueño.</p>
<p><a href="../../../a/n/a/Ananas_comosus.html" title="Ananas comosus">Pineapples</a> are also common in the province. Aside from the fruit, the leaves are also useful that it becomes an industry of its own. In the Municipality of Taal, pineapple leaves are being processed to be a kind of cloth known as the <b>gusi</b>. This is further processed to become the <b><a href="../../../b/a/r/Barong_Tagalog_b1eb.html" title="Barong Tagalog">Barong Tagalog</a></b>, the National Costume of the <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philippines.html" title="Philippines">Philippines</a>. In fact, the Barong Tagalog that was used by the heads of states in the last <a href="../../../a/s/i/Asia-Pacific_Economic_Cooperation_0429.html" title="Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation">Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation</a> in 1995 was from Batangas. <a href="../../../p/r/i/Princess.html" title="Princess">Princess</a> <a href="../../../d/i/a/Diana_Spencer_e5bc.html" title="Diana Spencer">Diana Spencer</a> was also known to posses a scarf made of gusi.</p>
<p>Batangas is also known for its livestock industry. Cattle from Batangas is widely sought throughout the country. In fact, the term <b>Bakang Batangas</b> (Batangas Cow) is actually synonymous to the country's best species of cattle. Indeed, the cattle industry in Batangas is so famous, that every <a href="../../../s/a/t/Saturday.html" title="Saturday">Saturday</a> is an auction day in the Municipalities of San Juan and Bauan.</p>
<p>Being near the sea, it is only expected that fishing plays a very important part of the Batangan Economy. Although the <a href="../../../t/u/n/Tuna.html" title="Tuna">tuna</a> industry in the country is mainly centred in <a href="../../../g/e/n/General_Santos_City_6f7f.html" title="General Santos City">General Santos City</a>, Batangas is also known for the smaller species of the said fish. The locals even have their own names for the said fish. Some of them include the term, <a href="../../../b/i/g/Bigeye_tuna.html" title="Bigeye tuna">Tambakol</a>, <a href="../../../p/a/c/Pacific_bluefin_tuna.html" title="Pacific bluefin tuna">Tulingan</a>, Bonito and another spicies also called <b>Bonito</b> but actually the <a href="../../../g/y/m/Gymnosarda_unicolor.html" title="Gymnosarda unicolor">Gymnosarda unicolor</a>. There is also an important industry for the <a href="../../../w/a/h/Wahoo.html" title="Wahoo">Tanigue</a>.</p>
<p>Aside from the <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_China_Sea_9e9c.html" title="South China Sea">South China Sea</a>, <a href="../../../t/a/a/Taal_Lake_da7a.html" title="Taal Lake">Taal Lake</a> also provides a source of fresh water fishes to the country. The lake is home to <i><a href="../../../s/a/r/Sardinella_tawilis.html" title="Sardinella tawilis">Sardinella tawilis</a></i> or simply <b><a href="../../../t/a/w/Tawilis.html" title="Tawilis">tawilis</a></b>, a species of freshwater sardine that is endemic to the lake. <a href="../../../t/a/a/Taal_Lake_da7a.html" title="Taal Lake">Taal Lake</a> also provides farmed <i><a href="../../../c/h/a/Chanos_chanos.html" title="Chanos chanos">Chanos chanos</a></i> or <b>bangus</b>. There is also a good volume of <i><a href="../../../o/r/e/Oreochromis_niloticus_niloticus.html" title="Oreochromis niloticus niloticus">Oreochromis niloticus niloticus</a></i> and <i>Oreochromis aureus</i>, both locally called <b>tilapia</b>. It is ecologically important to note that neither <b>bangus</b> nor <b>tilapia</b> are native to the lake. Thus they are considered <a href="../../../i/n/v/Invasive_species.html" title="Invasive species">invasive species</a> to the lake.</p>
<p>As mentioned in the section of culture, Batangueños are indeed fond of drinking. This is of no surprise as it lies in what is called the <b>coconut belt</b> that is the raw material for the local <a href="../../../l/i/q/Liqueur.html" title="Liqueur">liqueurs</a>, the lambanog (with 90% proof) and the tuba (which is mae of 5.68% <a href="../../../a/l/c/Alcohol.html" title="Alcohol">alcohol</a> and 13% <a href="../../../s/u/g/Sugar.html" title="Sugar">sugar</a>).</p>
<p>Sugar is also a major industry. As a matter of fact, after the Hacienda Luisita, the country's former largest sugar producer, was broken-up for land reform, the Municipality of <a href="../../../n/a/s/Nasugbu%2C_Batangas_fe4d.html" title="Nasugbu, Batangas">Nasugbu</a> has been the home of the current largest sugar producing company, the Central Azucarera Don Pedro. This also means that Batangas is also a home for a wide industry of sweets. Rice cakes are also a strong industry.</p>
<p>Although Batangas has already lost its distinction as <a href="../../../a/s/i/Asia.html" title="Asia">Asia</a>'s largest producer of <a href="../../../c/o/f/Coffee.html" title="Coffee">coffee</a>, this industry is still thriving, especially with the boost of coffee shops all over the country.</p>
<p>Blankets and mosquito nets are also widely available anywhere in the province. If you are lucky enough, you can buy it from peddlers.</p>
<p>One must also remember that the Capital City of Batangas hosts the second most important international seaport in the Island of Luzon. Next only to that of Manila International Port, Batangas International Port is a primary entry point of goods not only coming from the Southern part of the country but from everywhere in the worlds.</p>

<p>Together with the provinces in the Island of <a href="../../../p/a/n/Panay.html" title="Panay">Panay</a>, <a href="../../../i/l/o/Ilocos_Sur_c66f.html" title="Ilocos Sur">Ilocos Sur</a> and <a href="../../../p/a/m/Pampanga.html" title="Pampanga">Pampanga</a>, Batangas was one of the earliest encomiendas made by the Spaniards who settled in the country. It was headed by <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martin_de_Goiti_d04d.html" title="Martin de Goiti">Martin de Goiti</a> and since then it became one of the most important centres of the Philippines, not only the Tagalogs. Batangas first came to be known as Bonbon. It was named after the mystical and fascinating Taal Lake, which was also originally called Bonbon. Some of the earliest settlements in Batangas were established at the vicinity of Taal Lake. In <a href="../../../1/5/3/1534.html" title="1534">1534</a>, Batangas became the first practically organized province in Luzon. Balayan was the capital of the province for 135 years from <a href="../../../1/5/9/1597.html" title="1597">1597</a>-<a href="../../../1/7/3/1732.html" title="1732">1732</a>. In 1732, it was moved to Taal, then the flourishing and most progressive town in the province.</p>
<p>The current governor of Batangas Province is Arman Sanchez. His wife, Edna Sanchez, is the current Mayor of Santo Thomas. Since the Sanchezes were elected, the Provincial Capitol has gone through numerous renovations and reconstruction.</p>
<p>In 1889, the then Town of Batangas became the Philippine's 8th city, thus making it one of the oldest cities on the islands. The Mayor of the Provincial Capital, Batangas City, is Eduardo B. Dimacuha, while Lipa city, the centre of religion is headed by the popular actress <a href="../../../v/i/l/Vilma_Santos_4c0f.html" title="Vilma Santos">Vilma Santos</a>, wife of <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philippine_Senate_5172.html" title="Philippine Senate">Philippine Senator</a> Ralph Recto - himself a former Batangas congressman and younger brother of current Vice Governor Ricky Recto. Batangas is subdivided into 31 <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philippine_municipality.html" title="Philippine municipality">municipalities</a> and 3 <a href="../../../c/i/t/Cities_of_the_Philippines_2fa6.html" title="Cities of the Philippines">cities</a>.</p>
<p>Aside from them, Batangas is also known in the Philippine History as the <b>Cradle of Noble Heroes</b>, giving homage not only to the heroes it produced but the statesmen the came to lead the country. Among the luminaries of Batangas politics are <a href="../../../j/o/s/Jose_Laurel_29da.html" title="Jose Laurel">Jose Laurel</a>, <a href="../../../c/l/a/Claro_M._Recto_6354.html" title="Claro M.

<p>Batangas is a combination of plains and mountains. Not to mention the wide shoreline, being at the Southwest of the Philippines' biggest island. It is very just fitting that the writers of yore called it the '<i><b>Land of the Rolling Hills and Wide Shorelands'</b></i>.</p>
<p>Some the most famous mountain in the province is the world's smallest volcano, <a href="../../../t/a/a/Taal_Volcano_edc5.html" title="Taal Volcano">Mt. Taal</a> with an elevation of 600 meters. It is at the centre of the <a href="../../../t/a/a/Taal_Lake_da7a.html" title="Taal Lake">Taal Lake</a>, famous for its endemic fish, the <i>tawilis</i>.</p>
<p>Other important peaks are Mt. Makulot with an elevation of 609.6m, Mt. Talamitan with 700m, Mt. Pico de Loro with 664m, Mt. Batulao with 811m, Mt. Manabo with 830 m, and Mt. Daguldol with 672m. All of these mountains are considered level 1 mountains, meaning one can easily climb them with little training.</p>
<p>The Municipality of Nasugbu is the home of the plantation of Central Azucarera Don Pedro, the Philippines' largest producer of sugar and other sugarcane products.</p>
<p>Batangas is also known for its many islands, which include the municipality of Tingloy, Fortune Island of the Municipality of Nasugbu, and Sombrero Island in the Province of Mabini. And of course, Mt. Taal itself is an island.</p>
<p>Being at the southwest of <a href="../../../l/u/z/Luzon.html" title="Luzon">Luzon</a>, a lot of <a href="../../../s/e/a/Sea_turtles.html" title="Sea turtles">sea turtles</a> visit the place. but due to the massive hunting that takes place, the Provincial Government had passed a law prohibiting the killing of this marine replite.</p>

<p>Although attached to the big <a href="../../../i/s/l/Island.html" title="Island">Island</a> of <a href="../../../l/u/z/Luzon.html" title="Luzon">Luzon</a>, Batangas boasts of <a href="../../../f/l/o/Flora.html" title="Flora">flora</a> and <a href="../../../f/a/u/Fauna.html" title="Fauna">fauna</a> that is distinctively theirs. The local tree <b>malabayabas</b> is endemic to the province alone while the endangered <a href="../../../f/l/y/Flying_fox.html" title="Flying fox">flying fox</a> thrives there without fear. Batangas is also home to the <b>kabag</b>, one of the world's smallest <a href="../../../f/r/u/Fruit_bat.html" title="Fruit bat">fruit bat</a>. In the Municipality of <a href="../../../n/a/s/Nasugbu%2C_Batangas_fe4d.html" title="Nasugbu, Batangas">Nasugbu</a>, wild deers are still inhabiting the remote areas of Baranggay Looc.</p>
<p>But although Batangas has these land flying <a href="../../../m/a/m/Mammal.html" title="Mammal">mammals</a>, <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_China_Sea_9e9c.html" title="South China Sea">marine</a> <a href="../../../w/i/l/Wildlife.html" title="Wildlife">wildlife</a> remains to be the province's crowning glory.

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/t/Batangas.html" title="Edit section: The Prehistoric Batangan">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Prehistoric Batangan</span></h3>
<p>Long before the arrival of the <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spain.html" title="Spain">Spaniards</a> in the Philippines, large centers of population already thrived in Batangas. Native settlements lined the <a href="../../../p/a/n/Pansipit_River_d856.html" title="Pansipit River">Pansipit River</a>, a major waterway. The province had been trading with the <a href="../../../c/h/i/China.html" title="China">Chinese</a> since <a href="../../../y/u/a/Yuan_Dynasty_44d2.html" title="Yuan Dynasty">Yuan Dynasty</a> until first phase of <a href="../../../m/i/n/Ming_Dynasty_71f3.html" title="Ming Dynasty">Ming Dynasty</a> in the <a href="../../../1/3/t/13th_century.html" title="13th century">13th</a> and <a href="../../../1/5/t/15th_century.html" title="15th century">15th century</a>. Inhabitants of the province were also trading with <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japan.html" title="Japan">Japan</a> and <a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">India</a>.</p>
<p>The present Batangueños are descendants of the <a href="../../../b/o/r/Borneo.html" title="Borneo">Bornean</a> datus, Datu Dumangsil and Datu Balensusa, who sailed from Borneo to <a href="../../../p/a/n/Panay_Island_5648.html" title="Panay Island">Panay Island</a> as far as <a href="../../../t/a/a/Taal_Lake_da7a.html" title="Taal Lake">Taal Lake</a>. They organized the first Malay settlement at the mouth of Taal River. They eventually set up their own settlement in the place and founded the town of Taal in <a href="../../../1/5/7/1572.html" title="1572">1572</a>. The towns of Balayan, Lipa, and Batangas were founded later.</p>
<p>Archeological findings, show that even before the settlement of the Spaniards in the country, the <a href="../../../t/a/g/Tagalog.html" title="Tagalog">Tagalogs</a>, especially the Batangueños, had a very high level of civilization. This was shown by some jewelry, made from a chambered nautilus' shell, where some tiny holes were drilled by some tube. The way it was drilled shows that early Batangueños has an idea of what is beautiful.</p>
<p>Later, the pre-historic Batangueños was influenced by India as shown in some ancient potteries. In fact, a Buddhist image was reproduced in mould on a clay medallion in bas-relief from the Municipality of Calatagan. According to experts, the image in the pot strongly resembles the iconographic portrayal of Buddha in Siam, India and Nepal. The pot shows Buddha Amithaba in the <a href="http://yet.typepad.com/round_dice/2006/02/tribhanga_strik.html|" class="external text" title="http://yet.typepad.com/round_dice/2006/02/tribhanga_strik.html|" rel="nofollow">tribhanga</a> pose inside an oval nimbus. Scholars also noted that there is a strong <a href="../../../m/a/h/Mahayana.html" title="Mahayana">Mahayanic</a> orientation in the image, since the Boddhisattva Avalokitesvara was also depicted.</p>
<p>One of the major archeological findings happened last January 1941, where 2 crude stone figures were found in Palapat in the Municipality of Calatagan. It was later donated to the National Museum. Unfortunately, one of it suffered a bad fate and was destroyed during the holocaust of the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a>.</p>
<p>Eighteen years later, a grave was excavated in the nearby Punta Buaya. Once again, it showed that early Batangueños have an appreciation of art, since pieces of brain coral were carved behind the heads of the 12 remains that were found. The site was named 'Likha' (meaning 'Creature'). The remains were accompanied by furniture that could be traced as early as the 14th century. Potteries, as well as bracelets, stoneware and metal objects were also found in the area, suggesting that the people who lived there had an extensive contact with people from as far as China.</p>
<p>The presence of believed also suggested that prehistoric Batangaueños believed in the idea of life-after-death, since someone might need a plate where he would eat or chalices where he could drink. This also related the Batangueños to its neighbors in Asia, where it was a custom to bury some furniture with the dead.</p>
<p>Like the nearby tribes, the Batangan or the early Batanueños were non-aggressive people. Partly because most of the tribes in the immediate environs are related to them by blood. However, when there is no choice but to defend your life, Batangans would use the <i>bakyang</i> (bows and arrows), the <i>bangkaw</i> (spears) and the <i>suwan</i> (bolo).</p>
<p>Another proof of civilization from the Batangans was the presence of religion. Though it was highly superstitious, such as the use of <i>amuret</i> (witchcraft), it showed that these people believed in the presence of higher beings and other things unseen. Thus, there is a strong connection between the Batangans and nature.</p>
<p>Although it is widely accepted that the term <a href="../../../t/a/g/Tagalog.html" title="Tagalog">Tagalog</a> came from the word 'Taga-Ilog' o river Dwellers, (referring to the Pasig River), Wang The-Ming pointed out in his writings that Batangas was the real centre of the <a href="../../../t/a/g/Tagalog.html" title="Tagalog">Tagalog</a> Tribe, which he then identified as <i>Ma-yi</i>. According to this Chinese Annals, Ma-yi had its centre in the Province and extends to as far as <a href="../../../c/a/v/Cavite.html" title="Cavite">Cavite</a>, <a href="../../../l/a/g/Laguna_%28province%29.html" title="Laguna (province)">Laguna</a>, <a href="../../../r/i/z/Rizal.html" title="Rizal">Rizal</a>, <a href="../../../q/u/e/Quezon.html" title="Quezon">Quezon</a>, <a href="../../../b/a/t/Bataan.html" title="Bataan">Bataan</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/n/Mindoro.html" title="Mindoro">Mindoro</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marinduque.html" title="Marinduque">Marinduque</a>, <a href="../../../n/u/e/Nueva_Ecija_fb11.html" title="Nueva Ecija">Nueva Ecija</a>, Some parts of <a href="../../../z/a/m/Zambales.html" title="Zambales">Zambales</a> and <a href="../../../t/a/r/Tarlac.html" title="Tarlac">Tarlac</a>. However, many historians interchangeably use the term Tagalog and Batangueño.</p>
<p>Henry Otley Beyer, an American archaeologist, also showed in his studies that the early Batangueños have a special affinity with the precious stone known as the jade. In fact, the named the Late Paleolithic Period of the Philippines as the <b>Batangas Period</b> in recognition of the multitude of jade found in the excavarted caves in the province. Beyer identified that the jade-cult reached the Province as early as the year 800 BC and lasted until 200 BC.</p>

<p>In <a href="../../../1/5/7/1570.html" title="1570">1570</a>, Spanish generals <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martin_de_Goiti_d04d.html" title="Martin de Goiti">Martin de Goiti</a> and <a href="../../../j/u/a/Juan_de_Salcedo_7f78.html" title="Juan de Salcedo">Juan de Salcedo</a> explored the coast of Batangas on their way to Manila and came upon a Malay settlement at the mouth of <a href="../../../p/a/n/Pansipit_River_d856.html" title="Pansipit River">Pansipit River</a>. In <a href="../../../1/5/7/1572.html" title="1572">1572</a>, the town of <a href="../../../t/a/a/Taal%2C_Batangas_3f25.html" title="Taal, Batangas">Taal</a> was founded and its convent and stone church were constructed later.</p>
<p>Batangas was founded in <a href="../../../1/5/8/1581.html" title="1581">1581</a>. Originally, it was composed of the present provinces of Batangas, <a href="../../../m/i/n/Mindoro.html" title="Mindoro">Mindoro</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marinduque.html" title="Marinduque">Marinduque</a>, southeast <a href="../../../l/a/g/Laguna_province.html" title="Laguna province">Laguna</a> and <a href="../../../c/a/m/Camarines.html" title="Camarines">Camarines</a>. After several devastating eruptions of Taal Volcano, the old Taal town site was buried. The capital was eventually transferred to Batangas (now a city) in <a href="../../../1/7/5/1754.html" title="1754">1754</a> where it has remained to date.</p>
<p>The history of Batangas as a province can never be separated from the history of the Christianization of the Islands. In the same yeas that de Goiti and Salcedo visited the province, the Franciscan missionaries came to Taal. The place later became the first settlement of the Spaniards in Batangas and one of the earliest in the Philippines. In 1572 the Augustinians founded Taal in the place of Wawa, now San Nicolas, and from there began preaching in Balayan and in all the big settlements around the lake of Bombon (Taal). Indeed, the Augustinians did a very good job. Not only did they make Batangas the second most important religious centre of the Archipelago, they did it in a mere 10 year period. In fact, up to now, Batangas remains to be one of the most '<b>Christianised'</b> and even the most '<b>Catholic'</b> Province in the <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philippines.html" title="Philippines">Philippines</a>.</p>
<p>The first missionaries in the diocese were the Augustinians, and they remained until the revolution against Spain. Among the first missionaries were eminent men like Alfonso de Albuquerque, Diego Espinas, Juan de Montojo and others.</p>
<p>The first centers of faith were established in Taal, then in Balayan, Bauan, Lipa, Sala, Tanauan, all around the lake of Bombon (Taal).</p>
<p>The first missionaries were extraordinary men. And during the first ten years, the whole region around the lake of Bombon was completely Christianized. It was done through the preaching of men who had learned the first rudiments of the language of the people. At the same time they started writing manuals of devotion in Tagalog. What is more, they wrote the first Tagalog grammar that served other missionaries who came.</p>
<p>The year of foundation of important parishes follows: 1572 the Taal parish was founded by the Augustinians; 1581 the Batangas parish under Fray Diego Mexica; 1596 Bauan parish administered by the Augustinian missionaries; 1605 Lipa parish under the Augustinian administration;1774 Balayan parish was founded; 1852 Nasugbu parish; and 1868 Lemery Parish.</p>
<p>Batangas was also among the first of the eight Philippine provinces to revolt against Spain and also one of the provinces placed under Martial Law by Spanish Governor General Ramon Blanco on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_30.html" title="August 30">August 30</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/9/1896.html" title="1896">1896</a>. This event was given distinction when Marcela Agoncillo, also a native of the province, made the Philippine Flag. Indeed, the official Philippine flag has a sun with eight rays to represent these eight provinces.</p>
<p>Another notable hero from this era is <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apolinario_Mabini_ffcf.html" title="Apolinario Mabini">Apolinario Mabini</a>, also known as the sublime paralytic and "Brains of the Revolution.</p>

<p>The struggles of the Batangueños did not end when the Spaniards left the Philippines. Batangas was also in the watch-list of the Americans when they occupied the Islands.</p>
<p>When the Americans forbade the Philippine flag from being flown anywhere in the country, Batangas was one of the places where the revolutionaries chose to propagate their propaganda. Many, especially the revolutionary artists chose Batangas as the place to perform their plays. In an incident recorded by Amelia Bonifacio in her diary, the performance of <b>Tanikalang Ginto</b> in the province led not only to the arrest of the company but all of the audience. Later, the play was banned from being shown anywhere in the country.</p>
<p>General <a href="../../../m/i/g/Miguel_Malvar_587b.html" title="Miguel Malvar">Miguel Malvar</a> is recognized as the last Filipino general to surrender to the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> in the <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philippine-American_War_37c4.html" title="Philippine-American War">Philippine-American War</a>.</p>

<p>After the Philippines was freed from America, the Batangueños once again entered the picture. Statesmen from Batangas became famous in the government. These include the legislators <a href="../../../f/e/l/Felipe_Agoncillo_8ad7.html" title="Felipe Agoncillo">Felipe Agoncillo</a>, Galicano Apacible (who later became the Secretary of Agriculture), Ramon Diokno, Apolinario R.

<p>Most of these legislators became well known not only in the country but also in the world as many of them held executive offices afterwards. some of them were even sent as Philippine Envoys to other countries.</p>
<p>It is also notable that when Quezon left the Philippines during the Japanese Occupation, the Japanese government in the Philippines chose the Batangueño <a href="../../../j/o/s/Jose_Laurel_29da.html" title="Jose Laurel">Jose Laurel</a> to the <a href="../../../d/e/_/De_jure.html" title="De jure">de jure</a> President of the Puppet Republic.</p>
