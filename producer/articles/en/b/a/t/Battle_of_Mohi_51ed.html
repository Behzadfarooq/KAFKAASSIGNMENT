<p>In 1223 the expanding <a href="../../../m/o/n/Mongol_Empire_05c7.html" title="Mongol Empire">Mongol Empire</a> defeated an allied Russian-<a href="../../../c/u/m/Cumans.html" title="Cumans">Cuman</a> army at the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_the_Kalka_River_b11d.html" title="Battle of the Kalka River">Kalka river</a>. The defeated Cumans retreated towards Hungary. Hungary had continuously tried to convert the Cumans to Christianity and expand her influence over the Cuman tribes for the past few decades. The Hungarian King <a href="../../../b/%C3%A9/l/B%C3%A9la_IV_of_Hungary_a6d6.html" title="Béla IV of Hungary">Béla IV</a> even began to use the title "King of Cumania". When the Cuman refugees (ca. 40,000 people) sought asylum in his kingdom, it seemed that at least a portion of the Cumans had accepted Hungarian rule. The Mongols considered the Cumans to be their slaves, saw Hungary as a rival, and the Cuman migration to Hungary as a <a href="../../../c/a/s/Casus_belli.html" title="Casus belli">casus belli</a>. In their ultimatum they also blamed Hungary for missing envoys.</p>
<p>The Tartar threat approached Hungary during a time of political turmoil. Traditionally, the base of royal power consisted of the vast estates owned as royal property. Under <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrew_II_of_Hungary_eab0.html" title="Andrew II of Hungary">Andrew II</a>, the donations of land by the crown reached a new peak. Whole counties were donated. As Andrew II said <i>the best measure of royal generosity is measureless</i>. After <a href="../../../b/%C3%A9/l/B%C3%A9la_IV_of_Hungary_a6d6.html" title="Béla IV of Hungary">Béla IV</a> inherited his father's throne he began to re-confiscate Andrew’s donations and to execute or expel his advisors. He also denied the lord's right of personal hearings and accepted only written petitions to his chancellery. He even had the chairs of the council chamber taken away in order to force everybody to stand in his presence. His action caused great disaffection among the lords. The newly arrived Cumans gave the king better position (and increased prestige among Church circles for converting them) but also caused a lot of problems. The <a href="../../../n/o/m/Nomad.html" title="Nomad">nomadic</a> Cumans seemed unable to live together with the settled Hungarians and the lords were shocked that the king supported the Cumans in quarrels between the two.</p>

<p>The Mongols attacked Hungary with three armies. One of them attacked through Poland in order to withhold possible <a href="../../../p/o/l/Poland.html" title="Poland">Polish</a> auxiliaries and defeated the army of Duke <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_II_the_Pious_bf09.html" title="Henry II the Pious">Henry II the Pious</a> of <a href="../../../s/i/l/Silesia.html" title="Silesia">Silesia</a> at <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Legnica_4d15.html" title="Battle of Legnica">Legnica</a>. A southern army attacked <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transylvania.html" title="Transylvania">Transylvania</a>, defeated the <a href="../../../v/o/i/Voivod.html" title="Voivod">voivod</a> and crushed the Transylvanian Hungarian army. The main army led by <a href="../../../b/a/t/Batu_Khan_c5c3.html" title="Batu Khan">Khan Batu</a>, and <a href="../../../s/u/b/Subutai.html" title="Subutai">Subutai</a> attacked Hungary through the fortified Verecke Pass and annihilated the army led by the <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palatine_%28Kingdom_of_Hungary%29_ef44.html" title="Palatine (Kingdom of Hungary)">count palatine</a> on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_12.html" title="March 12">March 12</a>, <a href="../../../1/2/4/1241.html" title="1241">1241</a>.</p>
<p>King <a href="../../../b/%C3%A9/l/B%C3%A9la_IV_of_Hungary_a6d6.html" title="Béla IV of Hungary">Béla IV</a> began to mobilize his army and ordered all of his troops, including the Cumans, to the city of <a href="../../../p/e/s/Pest_%28city%29.html" title="Pest (city)">Pest</a>. <a href="../../../f/r/e/Frederick_II_of_Austria_ebe3.html" title="Frederick II of Austria">Frederick II Babenberg</a>, Duke of <a href="../../../a/u/s/Austria.html" title="Austria">Austria</a> and <a href="../../../s/t/y/Styria.html" title="Styria">Styria</a>, also arrived there to help him. In this moment, the conflict between Cumans and Hungarians caused riots and the Cuman khan — who had been under the personal protection of the king — was murdered. Some sources mention the role of Duke Frederick in inciting this riot, but his true role is unknown. The Cumans believed that they had been betrayed, and left the country to the south, pillaging all the way. The full mobilization was unsuccessful. Many contingents were unable to reach Pest; some were destroyed by Mongols before they arrived, some by renegade Cumans. Many nobles refused to take part in the campaign because they hated the king and desired his downfall. Hardly anybody believed that the Mongol attack was a serious threat to the kingdom's security, and the Cuman defection was considered minor and usual. This attitude may have contributed to the death of the Cuman <a href="../../../k/h/a/Khan_Kuthen_dcc3.html" title="Khan Kuthen">Khan Kuthen</a>.</p>
<p>The Tartar vanguard reached Pest on March 15th and began to pillage the neighbouring area. <a href="../../../b/%C3%A9/l/B%C3%A9la_IV_of_Hungary_a6d6.html" title="Béla IV of Hungary">King Béla</a> forbade his men to attack them, as the Hungarian army was still unprepared. Even so, Duke Frederick attacked and defeated a minor raiding party, so Béla came to be seen as a coward. After this "heroic" act, Duke Frederick returned home. Ugrin Csák, the <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archbishop.html" title="Archbishop">archbishop</a> of <a href="../../../k/a/l/Kalocsa.html" title="Kalocsa">Kalocsa</a>, also tried to attack a Mongol contingent, but he was lured to a swamp and his armoured cavalry became irretrievably stuck in it. He barely escaped with his own life.</p>
<p>Finally, the king decided to offer battle with the Tartars, but they began to retreat. This affirmed the opinion of the lords that the Tartars were not a threat and the king’s behaviour was not caution, but cowardice. After a week of forced marches and regular Tartar attacks, the Hungarian army reached the flooded river <a href="../../../s/a/j/Saj%C3%B3.html" title="Sajó">Sajó</a>. Here the army stopped to rest and to wait for additional supplies. The king and the Hungarians still did not know that the main Tartar army, which numbered between 20,000 and 30,000, in contrast to the approximately 15,000-strong collection of varied Hungarian forces, was present, because of the wooded terrain on the far bank of the Sajó. The cautious king ordered the building of a heavily fortified camp of wagon trains.</p>
<p>It is highly unlikely that the Mongols originally wanted to cross a wide and dangerous river to attack a fortified camp. It is more likely that their original plan was to attack the Hungarians while crossing the river just as in the case of the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_the_Kalka_River_b11d.html" title="Battle of the Kalka River">Battle of the Kalka River</a>. But we will never know what Mongol generals truly had in mind. We know that a <a href="../../../r/u/t/Ruthenia.html" title="Ruthenia">Ruthenian</a> slave of the Tartars escaped to the Hungarians and warned them of the Mongol night attack over the bridge of <a href="../../../s/a/j/Saj%C3%B3.html" title="Sajó">Sajó</a>.</p>
<p>The Hungarians still did not believe that this would be a full scale attack, but the troops of Prince Kálmán, Duke of <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slavonia.html" title="Slavonia">Slavonia</a> and the younger brother of king Béla, and archbishop Ugrin Csák with the <a href="../../../k/n/i/Knights_Templar_f717.html" title="Knights Templar">Templar</a> master left the camp to surprise the Tartars and defend the unguarded bridge. They reached the bridge at midnight. The sun set at 18:29, so they had to march 7 kilometres in darkness. It is very unlikely that the Mongols wanted to attack at night (horse archers avoid night battles), but they wanted to cross the river to be able to attack the Hungarian camp at dawn. When Kálmán and Ugrin arrived they found the Tartars unprepared and in the middle of crossing the river. They successfully forced them into pitched battle and achieved a great victory at the bridge. The Mongols were totally unprepared for the crossbowmen who inflicted considerable losses on the Mongol forces. (It was a huge bridge. According to its remains it was a minimum of 200 metres long.) The Hungarians left some soldiers to guard the bridge and returned to the camp. This shows that they still did not know that the main Mongol army was there. When they returned to the camp around 2 a.m., they celebrated the victory.</p>
<p>The unexpected Hungarian victory forced the Mongol generals to modify their plans. Sejban was sent north to a ford with a smaller force to cross the river and attack the back of the bridgeguard. At about 4 a.m., as the daylight they required started to break, they began the crossing. Meanwhile, <a href="../../../s/u/b/Subutai.html" title="Subutai">Subotai</a> went south to build a makeshift emergency bridge while the Hungarians were engaged at the main bridge, but left Batu a plan to use giant stonethrowers, which the Hungarians had probably never seen, to clear the crossbowmen opposing them. At dawn, <a href="../../../b/a/t/Batu_Khan_c5c3.html" title="Batu Khan">Batu</a>, with the help of seven <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stone_Thrower_4f8c.html" title="Stone Thrower">Stone Throwers</a>, attacked the Hungarian guards on the bridge and after the subsequent arrival of Sejban and his men, the Hungarians retreated to their camp. The Mongol main forces finished crossing the river around 8 a.m.</p>
<p>When the fleeing Hungarians arrived at the camp they woke up the others. Kálmán, Ugrin and the Templar master left the camp again to deal with the attackers. Others remained there, believing this was also a minor attack and that Prince Kálmán would again claim victory. But as Kálmán and Ugrin witnessed the horde of Tartars swell, they realised that this was not a minor raid, but a very dangerous attack of the main Mongol force. After some heavy fighting they returned to the camp to reinforce themselves and to return with the full army. They were badly disappointed, as the king had not even issued orders to prepare for the battle. Archbishop Ugrin reproached the king for his faults in public, and finally the Hungarian army sallied forth, but this delay gave enough time to Batu to finish the crossing. A hard struggle ensued. The Hungarians outnumbered Batu's troops and the Tartars were unable to move quickly because the Sajó was behind their backs. A Chinese-Mongol source mentions that Batu lost 30 of his bodyguards and one of his lieutenants, Bakatu, and only the personal action and bravery of Batu kept the horde from breaking and fleeing the field<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup>. At this moment, <a href="../../../s/u/b/Subutai.html" title="Subutai">Subotai</a> who had been delayed by bridge-building, attacked the Hungarians’ rear flank, causing the panicked Hungarians to retreat to their camp.</p>
<p>It is possible that the Hungarians might have had the capability to defend the camp, but sallying was ineffective, and they were terrified by the flaming arrows, resulting in the deaths of many soldiers by the trampling crush of their comrades. Finally, the morale-less soldiers routed and tried to escape through a gap left open on purpose by the Mongols according to the knowledge that fleeing soldiers can be killed more easily than those who, with their backs to the wall, are forced to fight till death. However, the Tartar casualties had been so large that, at this point, Batu did not want to pursue the Hungarians; but Subotai exhorted him successfully and the Mongols attacked. Archbishop Ugrin was killed, but Kálmán and Béla managed to escape, though the wounds of Kálmán were so serious that he died soon after. The Hungarians lost nearly 10,000 men and were unable to field another army to contain the remaining Tartar horde. After the victory, the Tartars regrouped and began a systematic assault on the rest of the nation.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Mohi_51ed.html" title="Edit section: Aftermath">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Aftermath</span></h2>
<p>After the battle, there was no other major organized force capable of halting the advance of the Mongols; defeating them completely was unthinkable. An attempt was made to hold off the main Mongol army at the Danube, which was mostly successful from April 1241 until January 1242. In an unusually cold winter, the river froze over, and after a number of close battles, the Mongols managed to cross. The royal family escaped to <a href="../../../a/u/s/Austria.html" title="Austria">Austria</a> to seek help from their ally Duke Frederick, but instead he arrested them and extorted an enormous ransom in gold and forced the king to cede three western counties to Austria. It was at this point that the King and some of his retinue fled southwest, through Hungarian-controlled territory, to the Adriatic coast and the castle of <a href="../../../t/r/o/Trogir.html" title="Trogir">Trau</a>, where they stayed until the Mongols retreated. While the king kept himself apprised of the situation in the rest of the country, he made numerous attempts to contact other rulers of Europe, including the pope, the Holy Roman Emperor, and the King of France, but none seemed interested, and all seemed to have the same profound misunderstanding of the threat posed by the Mongol armies, which stood by this time within a week's ride from the borders of France.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in the main territory of Hungary, surviving members of the royal retinue, being for the large part those that did not get to the battle of Mohi in time to participate, along with a number of unorganized irregulars consisting mostly of armed peasants, employing <a href="../../../g/u/e/Guerilla.html" title="Guerilla">guerilla</a> tactics, continued to harass Mongol troops, even occasionally successfully engaging them in open battle. Much of the civilian population fled to areas of refuge inaccessible to the Mongol cavalry: high mountains in the north and east; swamps, especially on the puszta, around Székesfehérvár, and in the west (the Hanság); and older <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earthwork.html" title="Earthwork">earthwork</a> fortresses, most of which were in a <a href="../../../m/o/t/Motte-and-bailey.html" title="Motte-and-bailey">Motte-and-bailey</a> form or consisted of a mud-banked enclosure on the top of a mountain, steep natural hill, or man-made hill. <a href="../../../r/o/g/Rogerius.html" title="Rogerius">Rogerius</a> recounts his experience in one such refuge called Fátra in his <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carmen_Miserabile_59b5.html" title="Carmen Miserabile">Carmen Miserabile</a>. (Such places are often referred to by the <a href="../../../g/e/r/German_language.html" title="German language">German</a> term <i>Fluchtburg</i>.)</p>
<p>In 1242 the Great Khan <a href="../../../o/g/o/Ogodei.html" title="Ogodei">Ogodei</a> died and ultimately this led the Mongols to retreat so that the princes of the blood could be present for the election of a new Great Khan. Just prior to their departure, the Mongol army was having difficulty with the pacification of the country, though they made plans to attack Austria and eventually Germany and Italy. While the defeat of the Hungarian army at the Sajó river is most often described in a couple of sentences as an effortless rout by the Mongols of the Hungarian army, this is an oversimplification. The Hungarian army as well as irregulars from the countryside proved dangerous foes and Mongol losses were not insignificant. Had Subotai not managed to attack the Hungarian rear in time, the battle could have ended in total Mongol defeat.</p>
<p>By the mid-13th century, the Hungarian army had lost the tactics of the steppe nomads that made them such effective fighters against the German states, France, Italy, Spain, Poland, the Balkans and the Low Countries in the ninth and tenth centuries (Note: there is some doubt in this regard, as some historians have stated that the Hungarian military became more westernised after the Mongol invasion and because of it; and despite its steppe tactics, early Hungary was still defeated by the Germans in the tenth century and was hardly a threat to France or Spain; whether they had retained steppe tactics or not would not have helped). Outfitted in lighter versions of contemporary European armor equipment, they were often slow, easy targets for swift Mongol archers (this statement however, is likely an oversimplification; the Mongols were simply better tacticians, and there is no indication in the sources that the Hungarians had any problems coming to grips with the Mongols). Still, they managed to nearly defeat the main Mongol force. At one point, Batu Khan's personal guards were being slaughtered and his own life lay in serious danger. At another point, the Mongol troops were being routed by the Hungarian archers followed up by the heavy mounted knights and only the personal bravery of Batu Khan prevented the wholesale flight of his army. Ultimately, only by means of what was essentially a trick (and ironically, one which earlier Hungarian troops used often) did the Mongols manage to defeat the main Hungarian army in open battle.</p>
<p>In spite of this, by Candlemas (February) 1242, more than a year after the initial invasion and a few months before the Mongols' withdrawal, a significant number of important castles and towns had resisted the formidable and infamous Mongol siege tactics. Among the nearly eighty sites that remained unconquered, only three were of the most formidable type: the then-new stone castle on an elevation: <a href="../../../f/i/%C4%BE/Fi%C4%BEakovo.html" title="Fiľakovo">Fülek</a>, Léka, near the western border, and <a href="../../../g/%C3%BC/s/G%C3%BCssing.html" title="Güssing">Németújvár</a>. The rest were either fortified towns (e.g. <a href="../../../s/z/%C3%A9/Sz%C3%A9kesfeh%C3%A9rv%C3%A1r.html" title="Székesfehérvár">Székesfehérvár</a>), old comital center castles (e.g. <a href="../../../e/s/z/Esztergom.html" title="Esztergom">Esztergom</a> citadel]]), fortified monasteries (e.g. <a href="../../../t/i/h/Tihany.html" title="Tihany">Tihany</a> and <a href="../../../p/a/n/Pannonhalma.html" title="Pannonhalma">Pannonhalma</a>) or military fortresses (e.g. Vécs guarding a main trade route in the mountains of <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transylvania.html" title="Transylvania">Transylvania</a>). Ultimately, the country was not subdued; and though much of the population was slaughtered, the King and upper nobility avoided capture. As a tardy revenge, the Hungarians and Croats ambushed and destroyed the rearguard division of the retreating Mongol army in the Carpathians.</p>
<p>After the withdrawal of the Mongol troops, who were never again to score a victory in Hungary, the country lay in ruin. Nearly half of the inhabited places had been destroyed by the invading armies. Around a quarter of the population was lost, mostly in lowland areas, especially in the <a href="../../../a/l/f/Alf%C3%B6ld.html" title="Alföld">Alföld</a>, where there were hardly any survivors; in the southern reaches of the Hungarian plain in the area now called the <a href="../../../b/a/n/Banat.html" title="Banat">Banat</a>, and in southern Transylvania.</p>
<p>However, the power of the kingdom was not broken. Within a year of the withdrawal of the Mongols, the three westernmost counties (<a href="../../../m/o/s/Moson.html" title="Moson">Moson</a>, <a href="../../../s/o/p/Sopron.html" title="Sopron">Sopron</a>, and <a href="../../../v/a/s/Vas.html" title="Vas">Vas</a>) that were extorted as ransom by Duke Frederick of Austria were recaptured, and a local uprising in <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slavonia.html" title="Slavonia">Slavonia</a> was quashed. The threat of another Mongol invasion, this time taken seriously, was the source of exceptional national unity and provided the impetus for <a href="../../../b/e/l/Bela_IV_c8bd.html" title="Bela IV">Bela IV</a>'s extensive expansion of Hungarian defences, especially the building of new stone castles (forty-four in the first ten years) and the revitalization of the army. Béla IV is seen now as a second founder of the nation, partly in recognition of all that was done during his reign to reconstruct and fortify the country against foreign invasion from the east. These improvements were to pay off, in 1284, when <a href="../../../n/o/g/Nogai_Khan_e591.html" title="Nogai Khan">Nogai Khan</a> attempted an invasion of the country. In that event, the invasion was defeated handily, as were a number of other minor attacks before and after. In the coming centuries, as the power of the Mongols of the Russian steppe waned and western defences became more capable, the attention of countries of central Europe would increasingly be directed to the southeast, and the growing power of the <a href="../../../o/t/t/Ottoman_Empire_4168.html" title="Ottoman Empire">Ottoman Empire</a>.</p>
