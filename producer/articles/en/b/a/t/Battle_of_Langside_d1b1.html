<p>The <b>Battle of Langside</b>, fought on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_13.html" title="May 13">May 13</a>, <a href="../../../1/5/6/1568.html" title="1568">1568</a>, was one of the more unusual contests in Scottish history, bearing a superficial resemblance to a grand family quarrel, in which a mother fought her brother who was defending the rights of her infant son. In 1567 <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mary_Queen_of_Scots_7b58.html" title="Mary Queen of Scots">Mary Queen of Scots</a>'s short period of personal rule ended in recrimination, intrigue and disaster when she was forced to abdicate in favour of <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_VI_ae13.html" title="James VI">James VI</a>, her infant son. Mary was sent into captivity in <a href="../../../l/o/c/Loch_Leven_Castle_2da3.html" title="Loch Leven Castle">Loch Leven Castle</a>, while her Protestant half-brother, <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Stewart%2C_1st_Earl_of_Moray_0331.html" title="James Stewart, 1st Earl of Moray">James Stewart, Earl of Moray</a> was appointed Regent on behalf of his nephew. In early May 1568 Mary escaped, heading west to the country of the Hamiltons, high among her remaining supporters, with the determination to restore her rights as queen.</p>

<p>Mary's abdication had not been universally popular, even among sections of the Protestant nobility, and news of her escape was widely welcomed. With an escort of fifty horse led by Lord Claud Hamilton she arrived in <a href="../../../l/a/n/Lanarkshire.html" title="Lanarkshire">Lanarkshire</a>, soon to be joined by a wide-cross section of the nobility, including the earls of <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archibald_Campbell%2C_5th_Earl_of_Argyll_41b9.html" title="Archibald Campbell, 5th Earl of Argyll">Argyll</a>, Cassillis, Rothes and Eglintion; and the lords Sommerville, Yester, Livingston, Herries, Fleming, Ross and many others who all assembled at the town of <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hamilton%2C_South_Lanarkshire_fd74.html" title="Hamilton, South Lanarkshire">Hamilton</a> with their followers and vassals. Within a few short days Mary had managed to gather a respectable force of some 6000 men.</p>
<p>It was openly declared that her abdication, and her consent to the coronation of James, had been extorted from her under threat of death. An act of council was then passed, declaring the whole process by which Moray had been appointed as Regent to be treasonable. A bond was drawn up by those present for her restitution, signed by eight earls, nine bishops, eighteen lords, twelve abbots and nearly one hundred barons.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Langside_d1b1.html" title="Edit section: Mary's March">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Mary's March</span></h2>
<p>It was Mary's intention to avoid battle if possible, retiring instead to <a href="../../../d/u/m/Dumbarton_Castle_1f5b.html" title="Dumbarton Castle">Dumbarton Castle</a>, still held for her by Lord Fleming. Here she would be in a virtually impregnable position, well-placed to receive the expected reinforcements from the north, and then recover her hold over the country by degrees. With the intention of by-passing Moray she marched to <a href="../../../r/u/t/Rutherglen.html" title="Rutherglen">Rutherglen</a> and then on a wide circuit past Glasgow, intending to move by way of <a href="../../../l/a/n/Langside.html" title="Langside">Langside</a>, <a href="../../../c/r/o/Crookston%2C_Glasgow_55ff.html" title="Crookston, Glasgow">Crookston</a> and <a href="../../../p/a/i/Paisley.html" title="Paisley">Paisley</a> back towards the <a href="../../../r/i/v/River_Clyde_ffa3.html" title="River Clyde">River Clyde</a>, and then on to Dumbarton on the north side of the Clyde estuary. Moray drew up his army on the moor close to the village of Langside, then several miles south of Glasgow but now well within the city. Kirkcaldy, keeping an eye on the enemy movements, noted that they were keeping to the south of the Clyde, the Regent's army being on the opposite bank. In response he ordered hackbutters (musketeers) to mount behind each of his horsemen, rapidly fording the river, and placing them among the cottages, hedges and gardens of the village, which bordered each side of a narrow lane, through which Mary's army must defile. Meanwhile Moray continued to deploy the rest of the army, the vanguard under the command of the <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Douglas%2C_4th_Earl_of_Morton_1b9f.html" title="James Douglas, 4th Earl of Morton">Earl of Morton</a> leading the march across a nearby bridge. The whole army then deployed, the right around the village, and the left extending to the farm of Pathhead, the highest point of which is now known as <a href="../../../q/u/e/Queen%27s_Park%2C_Glasgow_08ef.html" title="Queen's Park, Glasgow">Queen's Park</a>. No sooner was this complete than the Queen's vanguard, commanded by Lord Hamilton, began its advance through the village. The battle was now under way.</p>
<p><a name="Guns_and_Pikes" id="Guns_and_Pikes"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Langside_d1b1.html" title="Edit section: Guns and Pikes">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Guns and Pikes</span></h2>
<p>Mary's army was commanded by Argyll, who was to show little in the way of real military skill, seemingly hoping simply to push Moray aside by sheer force of numbers: it is even suggested in the sources that he fainted at one point, though this is almost certainly a rumour spread by his enemies. With her army now engaged the Queen stood some distance to the rear, close to Cathcart Castle on a mound since named as the Court Knowe. As Hamilton attempted to force a passage through Langside he was met by close fire from Grange's hackbutters. Many in the front ranks were killed, throwing the remainder back on those following, and adding to the general confusion. Hamilton pushed on, finally reaching the top of a hill, only to find the main enemy army drawn up in good order. Morton with the border pikemen advanced to intercept Mary's vanguard. Both sides now met in 'push of pike'. The forest of inter-locked spears was now so thick it is said that if those behind threw their discharged pistols at the enemy the weapons simply rested on the shafts as on a carpet, rather than falling to the ground.</p>
<p>Grange, whom Moray had allowed considerable leeway, continued to act with courage and distinction; "...the Regent committed unto the laird of Grange, the specil cair, as ane experienced captain, to oversee every danger, to ryd to every wing and encourage and mak help where the greatest heit was." The battle was now at its height and the outcome still doubtful, until Grange saw that the right wing of the Regent's army-consisting of the barons of <a href="../../../r/e/n/Renfrewshire.html" title="Renfrewshire">Renfrewshire</a>-was beginning to lose ground. He immediately galloped to the main battalion and brought reinforcements. This was done so effectively, and the counter-attack pressed with such force, that it broke the enemy ranks. Moray, who hitherto had stood on the defensive, repulsing Mary's cavalry, now charged at the main enemy battalion, the fight now joined all along the line. The Queen's men crumbled, the fugitives being closely pursued by a party of Highlanders. The Battle of Langside, which had lasted for some forty-five minutes, was over.</p>
<p>In all some 300 men had been killed, a figure that almost certainly would have been much higher but for Moray's decision to avoid further bloodshed by ordering a halt to the pursuit. Many prisoners of note were taken. Mary and her escort rode off, eventually arriving at <a href="../../../d/u/n/Dundrennan_Abbey_88ce.html" title="Dundrennan Abbey">Dundrennan Abbey</a> in <a href="../../../d/u/m/Dumfriesshire.html" title="Dumfriesshire">Dumfriesshire</a>, some sixty miles to the south. From here she left for England, never to see Scotland again.</p>
