<p>During the early stages of the U.S. involvement in the Vietnam Conflict, a number of U.S. Special Forces Civilian Irregular Defense Group (CIDG) camps were established along the borders of the the Republic of Vietnam in order to both maintain surveillance of PAVN/NLF infiltration and to provide support and training to isolated villagers, who bore the brunt of the fighting. One of these camps was built near the town and airstrip at Dak To. Since <a href="../../../1/9/6/1965.html" title="1965">1965</a>, it had also been utilized as a Forward Operations Base by the highly-classified Studies and Observations Group (SOG), which launched reconnaissance teams from there to gather intelligence on the Ho Chi Minh Trail across the border in <a href="../../../l/a/o/Laos.html" title="Laos">Laos</a>.</p>
<p>Dak To itself lies on a flat valley floor, surrounded by waves of ridgelines that rose into peaks(some as high as 4000 feet) that stretched westward and southwestward towards the tri-border region where South Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia met. Double and triple-canopy rainforests covered the area, and the only open areas were filled in by bamboo groves whose stalks sometimes reached eight inches in diameter. Landing Zones (LZs) large enough for helicopters were few and far between, which meant that most troop movements could only be carried out on foot. Temperatures in the mountains of Kontum Province could reach 95 degrees Fahrenheit during the day and could drop as low as 55 degrees in the evenings.</p>

<p>Throughout the middle of <a href="../../../1/9/6/1967.html" title="1967">1967</a>, Dak To was a magnet for several PAVN spoiling attacks, and it appeared that PAVN was paying an increasing amount of attention to the area. As a result, on 17 June, two battalions of the <a href="../../../1/7/3/173rd_Airborne_Brigade_dd50.html" title="173rd Airborne Brigade">173rd Airborne Brigade</a> were moved into Dak To and began sweeping the jungle-covered mountains. Five days later, Alpha Company of the 503rd Airborne Infantry was ambushed and isolated by the <i>6th Battalion of the 23rd PAVN Infantry Regiment</i>. Two more companies of the 503rd were fed into the cauldron, but they were unable to reach the cut-off company until the next day, when the bodies of 76 American paratroopers were discovered.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>One week later, the rest of the 173rd moved into the area, along with the 3rd Brigade of the <a href="../../../1/s/t/1st_Air_Cavalry_Division_cd91.html" title="1st Air Cavalry Division">1st Air Cavalry Division</a>. The American units were supported by the 5th and 8th <a href="../../../a/r/m/Army_of_the_Republic_of_Vietnam_d129.html" title="Army of the Republic of Vietnam">Army of the Republic of Vietnam</a> (ARVN) Airborne Battalions and a battalion of the ARVN 42nd Infantry Regiment to conduct Operation <i>Greeley</i>. Throughout the summer there were sporadic, but violent, clashes with PAVN units. On the 16th, <i>Greeley</i> was folded into Operation <i>MacArthur</i>, when the 1st Brigade of the U.S. <a href="../../../4/t/h/4th_Infantry_Division_%28United_States%29_700e.html" title="4th Infantry Division (United States)">4th Infantry Division</a>, supported by the 4th Battalion of the 173rd's 503rd Infantry (4/503), were air-lifted into Dak To. The remainder of the 173rd Airborne returned to their Base Camp at Tuy Hoa and the ARVN airborne brigades (which had also seen heavy contact) were sent back for rest and refitting.</p>

<p>By early October, U.S. intelligence reported that PAVN was withdrawing regiments from the <a href="../../../p/l/e/Pleiku.html" title="Pleiku">Pleiku</a> area to join those in Kontum Province, thereby dramatically increasing the strength of local forces to that of a full division. In response, the 4th Infantry began moving in more of its units. On 29 October, the remainder of the 173d Airborne Brigade was returned as a reinforcement and they were joined by more ARVN units.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_3.html" title="November 3">3 November</a> <a href="../../../1/9/6/1967.html" title="1967">1967</a>, Sergeant Vu Hong, an artillery specialist with the <i>6th PAVN Regiment</i>, defected and was able to provide U.S. forces with detailed information on the disposition of PAVN forces and their objectives, both at Dak To and at the new CIDG base at Ben Het, some 18 kilometers to the west. PAVN had fed approximately 6,000 troops into the area, most of which made up the <i>1st PAVN Division</i>, composed of the <i>66th, 32nd</i> and <i>174th Infantry Regiments</i>, and the independent <i>24th Infantry Regiment</i>. In addition, the division was asupported by the <i>40th PAVN Artillery Regiment</i>. The goal of these units was the taking of Dak To and the destruction of a large American unit.</p>

Gen. William R. Peers, commander of the 4th Infantry Division and overall U.S. commander at Dak To</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>This human intelligence was bolstered by other means. The actions around Dak To were part of an overall strategy devised by the DRV leadership, primarily that of General Vo Nguyen Giap. The goal of PAVN operations in the area, according to a captured document from the <i>B-3 Front Command</i>, was "to annihilate a major U.S. element in order to force the enemy to deploy as many additional troops to the western highlands as possible."<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>As the Americans quickly discovered, the area had been well prepared by the North Vietnamese. The number and elaborateness of defensive preparations found by U.S. and ARVN troops indicated that some had been prepared as much as six months in advance. As Major General William R. Peers, the commander of U.S. forces in the area noted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Nearly every key terrain feature was heavily fortified with elaborate bunker and trench complexes. He had moved quantities of supplies and ammunition into the area. He was prepared to stay."<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>After contact with the PAVN forces on the 4th and 5th of the month, Brigadier General Leo H. Schweiter, commander of the 173rd, moved the rest of his brigade back to Dak To. The immediate goal of the paratroopers was to bolster the threatened defenses at Ben Het. Simultaneously, most of the elements of the 4th Infantry Division moved into the area around Dak To. The division was commanded by General Peers who was given overall command of Operation <i>MacArthur</i>. The town of Dak To had by now become a major logistical base, supporting an entire U.S. division and airborne brigade and six ARVN battalions. The stage was set for a major pitched battle.</p>

<p>Fighting erupted on 3 and 4 November when companies of the 4th Infantry came across PAVN defensive positions. Two days later the same thing occurred to elements of the 173rd. The American and ARVN troops soon applied a methodical approach to the fighting. They combed the hills on foot, ran into fixed PAVN hill-top defensive positions, applied massive firepower, and then launched ground attacks to force the North Vietnamese off. From ridgeline to ridgeline, the infantrymen humped, fought, killed, and died.</p>
<p>In all of these instances, PAVN troops fought stubbornly, inflicted casualties, and then withdrew. To expand the coverage of supporting fires, the 4th Battalion of the 173rd was ordered to build an artillery firebase on hill 823, south of Ben Het. The dense foliage forced the unit to land by helicopter only one company at a time. Unfortunately for the Americans, the hill was not unoccupied. Fifteen minutes after the first contact, the enemy had been pushed back, but seven Americans of Bravo Company, 4th Battalion of the 503rd Infantry lay dead and another 13 were wounded.</p>

The build-up at Dak To</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The following morning Bravo Company was relieved by Charlie Company of the same battalion, supported by two platoons of Delta Company. Task Force Black (as the combined unit was known) left Hill 823 and moved out to patrol the surrounding area. Before 08:00 on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_11.html" title="November 11">11 November</a>, the force was ambushed by the <i>3rd Battalion, 174th PAVN Regiment</i><sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup> and had to fight for its life. Charlie Company of the 4th Battalion of the 503rd drew the job of going to the relief of the task force. They encountered fire from all sides during the relief attempt, but they made it, reaching the trapped men at 15:37. U.S. losses were 20 killed, 154 wounded, and two missing. The commanding officer of Charlie Company reported an enemy body count of 80, but was commanded by higher headquarters to go out and count again. He then reported back that 116 PAVN soldiers had been killed. He later stated that "If you lost so many people killed and wounded, you had to have something to show for it."<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>From the PAVN-occupied hills overlooking the sprawling Dak To base camp, it must have appeared an inviting target. On <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_15.html" title="November 15">15 November</a>, a PAVN mortar barrage landed squarely upon the airfield, destroying two <a href="../../../c/-/1/C-130_Hercules_9275.html" title="C-130 Hercules">C-130 Hercules</a> transport aircraft, and then walked on to the ammunition and fuel storage areas. Both detonated simultaneously, sending a fireball and mushroom cloud high above the valley. Engineer Lieutenant Fred Dyerson thought "it looked like Charlie had gotten hold of some nuclear weapons."<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[6]</a></sup> This was, however, as close as PAVN would get to taking Dak To. The rapid deployment of allied forces had thrown the North Vietnamese onto the defensive. Previous actions had battered the <i>66th and 33rd PAVN Regiments</i> and they began a southwesterly retreat, covered by the <i>174th Regiment</i>. The Americans and the ARVN then began to run into tenacious rearguard actions. To prevent a repetition of the mortar barrage against the base camp, troops of 3rd Battalion 12th Infantry Regiment were ordered to take Hill 1338, which had an excellent overview of Dak To, only six kilometers away. For two days the Americans fought their way up the steep slope of the hill and into the teeth of the most elaborate bunker complex yet discovered, all of the fortifications of which were connected by field telephones.</p>
<p>At the same time, on Hill 1416, the elite, all-volunteer ARVN 3rd and 9th Airborne Battalions were fighting ferociously with the <i>24th PAVN Regiment</i>. The ARVN paratroopers took the hill after a four-day battle in which 247 enemy troops were killed. Meanwhile, the <i>174th PAVN Regiment</i> had slipped west past Ben Het and took up positions on a 875 meter-high hill to cover the withdrawal of the <i>66th Regiment</i>. On <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_19.html" title="November 19">19 November</a>, Colonel Schweiter was informed that a Special Forces Mobile Strike Force company had run into heavy resistance while reconning Hill 875. He then ordered his 2nd Battalion to take the hill.</p>

<p>That morning, the men of the 2nd Battalion, 503rd Infantry Regiment, 173rd Airborne Brigade, moved into jumpoff positions from which to assault Hill 875. Charlie and Delta companies moved up the slope in two columns while Alpha Company remained behind at the bottom to cut out an LZ. About half way up the hill, PAVN machine gunners opened fire on the advancing paratroopers. Then B-40 rockets and 57-mm recoiless rifle fire were unleashed upon the Americans. The paratroopers pushed to within 100 meters of the crest when their unseen opponents opened fire with small arms and grenades. The American advance was halted and the men went to ground, finding whatever cover they could. PAVN troops hidden at the bottom of the hill then launched a massed assault on Alpha Company. Unknown to the Americans, they had walked into a carefully prepared ambush by the <i>174th PAVN Regiment</i>.</p>

U.S. troops in combat on Hill 875</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The men of Alpha Company retreated up the slope, lest they be cut off from their comrades and annihilated. They were closely followed by the North Vietnamese. All that prevented the PAVN onslaught from overrunning the entire battalion was the heroic efforts of American paratroopers who stood their ground and died to buy time for their comrades. Soon, U.S. air strikes and artillery fire were being called in, but they had little effect on the battle due to the dense foliage on the hillside. It was at this time that one of the worst friendly-fire incidents of the Vietnam Conflict occurred. A U.S. fighter-bomber dropped a 500-pound bomb into the middle of the battalion perimeter, where the command group, the wounded, and the medics were located. It killed 42 men outright and wounded 45 more, including the last two company commanders (Alpha company's commander had been killed in the retreat up the slope).</p>
<p>The next morning the 4th Battalion of the 503rd was chosen to set out and relieve the men on Hill 875. Due to intense PAVN sniper and mortar fire (and the terrain) it took until nightfall for the relief force to reach the beleagured battalion. On the morning of the 21st, both battalions moved out to take the crest. During fierce, close-quarters fighting, some of the paratroopers made it into the PAVN trenchline, but they had to pull back as darkness fell. At approximately 23:00 hours the 4th Division's 1st Battalion of the 12th Infantry was ordered to witdraw from an offensive operations in the southern Central Highlands and redeploy to Dak To. In an almosr flawless night-time air redeployment, the entire battalion redeployed and took up positions around the main fire support base at Dak To in less than 12 hours.</p>
<p>The next day, <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_22.html" title="November 22">22 November</a>, was spent in launching airstrikes and a heavy artillery bombardment against the hilltop, totally denuding it of cover. On the 23rd, Thanksgiving Day, the 2nd and 4th Battalions of the 503rd were ordered to renew their assult while the 1st Battalion of the 12th Infantry assaulted 875 from the south.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[7]</a></sup> This time the Americans gained the crest, but the North Vietnamese had already abandoned their positions, leaving only a few charred bodies and weapons.</p>
<p>The battle of Hill 875 had cost the two battalions 158 killed and 402 wounded. Combined with noncombatant losses, this represented one-fifth of the 173rd Airborne Brigade's total strength.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[8]</a></sup> For it's combined actions during operations around Dak To, the 173rd was awarded the <a href="../../../p/r/e/Presidential_Unit_Citation_%28US%29_0406.html" title="Presidential Unit Citation (US)">Presidential Unit Citation</a>.</p>
<p><a name="Bottom_line" id="Bottom_line"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Dak_To_f293.html" title="Edit section: Bottom line">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Bottom line</span></h2>
<p>In the end, the North Vietnamese were forced to withdraw from the area and back into their sanctuaries in Laos and the DRV. U.S. munitions expenditures attested to the ferocity of the fighting: 151,000 artillery rounds, 2,096 tactical air sorties, 257 <a href="../../../b/-/5/B-52.html" title="B-52">B-52</a> strikes, and 40 lost helicopters.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[9]</a></sup> The U.S. Army claimed that 1,644 PAVN troops had been killed, but this figure became a source of contention, even at the time. In his memoirs, General Westmoreland mentioned only 1,400 PAVN casualties, while some members of his staff went only so far claiming 1,200.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[10]</a></sup> U.S. casualties numbered 289 killed and 985 wounded while ARVN units lost another 73 men killed in action. Not all American commanders were happy with the friendly to enemy loss ratio. U.S. Marine Corps General John Chaisson questioned "Is it a victory when you lose 362 friendlies in three weeks and by your own spurious body count you only get 1,200?"<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p>Without doubt three PAVN regiments had been so battered that they would play no part in the next phase of their winter-spring offensive. But were they supposed to? The 173rd Airborne Brigade and two battalions of the 4th Infantry Division were in no better shape. General Westmoreland claimed that: "we had soundly defeated the enemy without unduly sacrificing operations in other areas. The enemy's return was nil."<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[12]</a></sup> But was it? The border battles fought that fall and winter had indeed cost PAVN dearly, but they achieved their objective. By January <a href="../../../1/9/6/1968.html" title="1968">1968</a>, one-half of all U.S. maneuver battalions in the RVN were drawn away from the cities and lowlands and into the border areas.<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[13]</a></sup></p>
<p>Several members of Westmoreland's staff began to see an eerie resemblance to the <a href="../../../v/i/e/Viet_Minh_f975.html" title="Viet Minh">Viet Minh</a> campaign of <a href="../../../1/9/5/1953.html" title="1953">1953</a>, when seemingly peripheral actions had led up to the climactic <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Dien_Bien_Phu_bdfe.html" title="Battle of Dien Bien Phu">Battle of Dien Bien Phu</a>.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[14]</a></sup> General Giap even laid claim to such a strategy in an announcement in September, but, to the Americans, it all seemed a bit too contrived. Yet, no understandable analysis seemed to explain <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hanoi.html" title="Hanoi">Hanoi</a>'s almost suicidal military actions. They could only be explained if a situation akin to Dien Bien Phu came into being. Then, almost overnight, one emerged. In the western corner of Quang Tri Province, an isolated Marine outpost came under siege by PAVN forces that would eventually number three divisions. Giap's strategy was coming to fruition, although in this case the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Khe_Sanh_891b.html" title="Battle of Khe Sanh">Battle of Khe Sanh</a> would not be a successful repeat of Dien Bien Phu, but would instead end almost as a repeat of the actions at Dak To.</p>
