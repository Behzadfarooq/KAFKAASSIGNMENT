	    <p>The attack on Fort Sumter by the Southern rebels was the first was the first shots fired in the American Civil War; however, the actual first battle took place at Bull Run Creek and Manassas Junction, Louisiana. In this report I will answer most of the questions people might have about the First Battle of Bull Run or the Battle of Manassas. Theses are a few of the questions that I will answer in this paper: Why were there two names for the same battle? Were the people fighting the battle and their commanders ready for battle? Who were the commanders of the forces? Who fought in the battle? How many people were injured in the battle? Finally, who won the battle? There are a lot of hidden facts about this battle that most people do not know. This battle also had a lot of people fooled because of the way it went. The first question, why two names for the same battle? The First Battle of Bull Run and the Battle of Manassas was the same battle. The soldiers from the North called it the Battle of Bull Run because it was fought at Bull Run Creek. The soldiers from the South called it the Battle of Manassas because it was fought at Manassas Junction. Therefore, both names are correct. Today it is more commonly referred to as the First Battle of Bull Run, but if you go to the South they still refer to it as the First Battle of Manassas. Now the second question, were the people fighting the battle and their commanders ready for battle? The answer to this question would be no. The North was forced in to battle before the troops were adequately trained. On the way to the battle the troops lost food, ammunition, and men. The reason for this is because they had to walk there and they disposed of most of the food and ammunition on the way there, and the reason why they lost men was because most of the younger soldiers got hungry and tired so the wandered away from the group to eat and rest. This caused it to be near impossible to win the battle. Question number three, who were the commanders of the forces? Pierre Gustave Torrent Beauregard and Irvin McDowell took those places. “Beauregard was a Frenchman who had extensively studied Napoleon. He graduated second from his West Point class in 1853. Beauregard was commissioned as an engineer, distinguished himself in the War with Mexico, and served as the Super attendant of West Point, but resigned in 1861 to serve the Confederate Army. He saw action at Shiloh and Charleston, South Carolina. He ended the war as commander of the Department of North Carolina and southeastern Virginia” (General Bee Bernard 2). “Irvin McDowell was educated in France and graduated twenty-third from his West Point class in 1838. He carried the rank of major and was serving under General Winfield Scott in Washington D.C., when the Civil War began. He was in close contact with Lincoln and Government Officials and impressed them so that they prompted him to Brigadier general in May, 1861. McDowell was also involved at Second Bull Run. Afterwards he was removed from field command and never returned to command troops in combat” (General Bee Bernard 2). The fourth question now, who fought in the battle? The two sides that fought the battle were the Northern Union Troops and the Southern Confederate Troops. McDowell was commander of the Northern Union Troops and Beauregard was commander of the Southern Confederate Troops. The fifth question, what was the Number of injured people? The Southern Confederate Troops lost 387 people due to death, 1,582 people wounded and 13 people captured/missing. But The Northern Union Troops had 460 people that died, 1,124 people wounded, and 1,312 people captured/missing. The sixth and final question, who won the battle? If it is not already obvious the Southern Confederate Troops had a very easy victory over the Northern Union Troops. Since there troops were so inadequately trained and they lost so many supplies it practically gave the South Victory over the North. The people were in so much shock because they expected a short and simple battle. People might think that this is true because of how simple the victory is but this is not all true. People thought that it was going to be so short they packed up and went to watch but they ended up sitting for five hours. That is a short period of time but it was not as short as it could have been because the Union troops would not give up until they were defeated. This also made the Battle complicated to win because of their ignorance to not give up. One of the many hidden facts about this battle is that most of the pictures that you see were not actually taken during the battle. They were taken immediately after the battle because of how bloody the battle actually was and the photographers did not want to take the chance of killing themselves for a picture. The battle had over 4,000 Casualties from about 67,000 soldiers. Which is a lot and not a lot at the same time because there are some battles with over 15,000 casualties but since this was such a small battle it is a lot of casualties. This battle is indeed very important because it was the official opening of the Civil War. This battle also proved a lot of people wrong when they thought it was going to be short, small, and simple. Even though it was a very easy victory for the Southern Confederate troops it was still not short, small, or simple. I would say that yes 5 hours is a short battle but not when one side has no ammunition or food and has a shortage of men. The First Battle of Bull Run will always be a battle that I will think is important and very interesting. Although it may be a battle that not many people know much about or maybe not even have heard of but it is important because it opened the Civil War and it should get remembered for that. “This wasn’t one of the biggest battles of the war, but it was the formal opening for both sides. Of the 32,500 Confederate soldiers, 1,982 of them became casualties from 35,000 troops. Many thought this would quickly settle the dispute; all it did was prepare everyone for a long war and move the federal government into action” (General Bee Bernard 1). For a quick and simple review in this paper I answered some questions that most people did not know the answer to. I also revealed a little bit of the hidden facts that do not get spoke about very often. This paper covered things about the battle like the easy victory over the Northern Union Troops and how inadequately the troops were trained and unready for battle. Also things like exact numbers of how many people were killed, wounded, or captured/missing. Another important questioned answered was who were the troop Commanders, which are Pierre Gustave Torrent Beauregard for the Southern Confederate Troops and Irvin McDowell for the Northern Union Troops. A question that not many people know the answer to, why are there two names for the same battle? was another important question answered in my paper and the answer was Manassas because the battle was at Manassas Junction and Bull Run because it was at Bull Run Creek. Most people did not know that the pictures were not actually taken during the battle but after and that hidden fact was one in this paper. My research paper covers everything anyone could possibly know about the First Battle of Bull Run or Manassas. To end this the battle took 5 hours, there were over 4,000 Casualties, and 67,500 soldiers that fought the battle.</p>
