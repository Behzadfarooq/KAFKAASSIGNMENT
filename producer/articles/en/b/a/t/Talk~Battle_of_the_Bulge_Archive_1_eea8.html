<dd>This is in the wrong place. It's not normally known as <i>The Battle of the Ardennes</i>, but as <i>The Ardennes Offensive</i>. The Battle of the Ardennes is a <a href="../../../w/w/1/WW1_ff67.html" title="WW1">WW1</a> battle.</dd>
</dl>
<p>What's wrong with <i>Battle of the Bulge</i>? Until just now that is the only name I knew it by. And for Americans at least, this is the most known and popular title. Our naming conventions state that we should title articles based on common usage unless that causes an ambiguity. --<a href="../../../m/a/v/User%7EMaveric149_24ee.html" title="User:Maveric149">mav</a></p>

<dd>The only reason you know it as that is because of the movie. Battle of the Bulge was the US Army's slang for it. The normal name is <i>The Ardennes Offensive</i>. <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMintguy_d760.html" title="User:Mintguy">Mintguy</a> 21:41 Dec 11, 2002 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't think it's right to support ignorance by automatically going along with what the man in the street might say. Ask authorities on the subject instead. In my experience most reputable military histories list it under <i>The Ardennes Offensive</i> or possibly <i>The Ardennes Offensive (Battle of the Bulge)</i>. It's perhaps not relevant and not worth arguing over but if you look at the list of Battles virtually all have <i>battle of someplace' or they have a different name like <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Barbarossa_47da.html" title="Operation Barbarossa">Operation Barbarossa</a>. Battle of the Bulge is inconsistent with this. <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMintguy_d760.html" title="User:Mintguy">Mintguy</a> 21:58 Dec 11, 2002 (UTC)</i></dd>

<dd>The choice of a title that most people know and would expect does not support ignorance - it assists them in finding the article in the first place and doesn't preach to them that what they call something is ignorant. Stating just what the military calls something is information that should be in the article. In fact, I don't see anything wrong with using the military title throughout the whole article. But since this title is not nearly as widely known by most people, we must first <i>introduce</i> this term to the readers. Think of the surprise factor; Most people will be looking for Battle of the Bulge. They click on the link and are brought to something they didn't expect the Battle of Ardennes (1944). Many readers will instantly think they made a mistake and back out. There is also Google rankings and other external search engines to think about. If the most commonly searched for title, Battle of the Bulge, is not the H1 title then those external search engines will rank our article on the subject lower. There is also the fact that the mere existence of this article where it is will encourage others to make articles at militarily-correct titles. And I know from experience that many of these will <i>not</i> have redirects to them that will catch spontaneous links to the most widely known title. There is also a POV issue here where a minority usage is subverting a majority one. A similar content analogy would be if a contributor made the <a href="../../../g/o/d/God.html" title="God">God</a> article biased toward critical scientific views. We have well-established naming conventions on these matters. --mav</dd>

<dd>I disagree. Particularly as half the hits on google for "battle of the bulge" will send you to sites offering you diet advice. Whatever way you look at it though <i>Battle of Ardennes (1944)</i> is incorrect, put <i>Battle of Ardennes</i> in google and Wikipedia comes top and most other sites refer to the WWI battle. So I suggest moving this to <i>Battle of the Bulge</i>, redirecting <i>The Ardennes Offensive</i> to <i>Battle of the Bulge</i> and deleting this page. <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMintguy_d760.html" title="User:Mintguy">Mintguy</a> 22:32 Dec 11, 2002 (UTC)

This is the same thing I do for widely-known pseudonyms such as <a href="../../../b/i/l/Billy_the_Kid_ccc3.html" title="Billy the Kid">Billy the Kid</a> - the article is at the title people expect but the text uses the guy's real name in most of the article. --mav</dd>

<p>In both World War I and World War II the Allies fondly believed "no one will ever attack through the Ardennes" because of hills, forests, snows, few roads, etc. Whereupon, the Germans attacked twice achieving only partial success both times because it really is a poor place to attack through. Therefore, for reasons of better understanding of European geography and its impact on military action, I say the name Ardennes is best applied to both battles. The Bulge was the result of an attack on weak troops assigned to do nothing but sit in foxholes and wait for the end of the war. It never went from Bulge to rupture because the weak troops fought back and were supplemented by strong troops. <a href="../../../o/r/t/User%7EOrtolan88_d8ce.html" title="User:Ortolan88">Ortolan88</a></p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Nuts!</span></h2>
<p>The article says that the general's reply 'NUTS!' was not understood by Germans and non-American allies alike. So would somebody please, for the sake of this 'non-American ally', explain in the article what this reply meant? <a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBranko_4c86.html" title="User:Branko">branko</a></p>
<p>"NUTS" is American slang for "crazy" or mentally ill. "You're going to do WHAT?!?!? That's NUTS." An insane asylum was known as the "nuthouse." It is also simultaneously a slang word for the human testicles or "the balls," implying manhood or a lack thereof. ("That guy's got nuts the size of grapefruit.") There are therefore several possible implications:</p>
<p>1) The Germans were insane to ask for the Americans to surrender. 2) The Americans knew they were insane to NOT surrender, but refused anyway. 3) The Americans had the courage ("the balls") to not surrender. 4) If the Germans wanted to attack, they lacked "the balls" to do so.</p>
<p>A multiplicity of meanings communicated with a single word, some of them arguably obscene.</p>
<p><a href="../../../c/l/a/User%7EClarka_5ba3.html" title="User:Clarka">clarka</a></p>
<p>It should be noted that "Nuts" is also used as an exclamatory remark, like "Fuck" or "Shit" except less obscene. This is the sense in which I always interpreted the remark.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Likewise. But I'm now convinced that the good General had quite a specific meaning in mind, and it wasn't insanity. Explanations 3 and 4 are close, but no cigar. Suppose he had been English and had said "Bollocks!" That's what he meant. (My fellow Americans: Say the word but leave out the <i>ock</i>.) I'll bet that a study of contemporary American slang would show that "Nuts" had not only the same literal meaning but the same sense as an exclamation. 209.204.172.194 22:59, 17 Aug 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I agree, and the <a href="../../../b/o/l/Bollocks.html" title="Bollocks">Bollocks</a> article gives a very good synonym for this usage: "Rubbish!" I'm going to add this to the footnote, since I think it's closer in meaning to "Nuts!"; I'll leave the "Go to Hell!" bit too, since "Rubbish!" might not be much clearer to non-native English speakers. -- <a href="../../../j/h/f/User%7EJhf_d44f.html" title="User:Jhf">jhf</a> 18:19, 12 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The 'crazy' theory just doesn't stand up. I've heard 'Nuts' used to mean 'go to hell' in very similar contexts. Also there are reports that what McAuliffe actually said was still one word, but with the same meaning and considerably less polite. Hard to think of a less polite word that meant crazy; very easy to think of ones that meant 'Go to Hell'. I'm chaining the interpretation back. <a href="../../../d/j/_/User%7EDJ_Clayworth_c4dc.html" title="User:DJ Clayworth">DJ Clayworth</a> 13:19, 18 Aug 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I had always assumed it was simply derived from the then-common slang phrase "nuts to you," a nicer way of saying "go to hell". Shadoks 12:16, 1 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It probably meant precisely that. See <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/bulge/sfeature/sf_footage_04.html" class="external text" title="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/bulge/sfeature/sf_footage_04.html" rel="nofollow">HWO Kinnard's reminiscence</a>: <b>Gave the message to Colonel Harper, who ... gave it to the German Armistice party. The Germans were allowed to take off their blindfold and read the message, and they were puzzled by it. And they were trying to translate nuts. And they said, "Nuets, Nuets, Nuts... Vas Is Das?" They didn't get it at all. And Colonel Harper said, "If you don't understand it, it means go to hell!"</b></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>In the book I read "nuts" is clearly along the same lines as "crap, dang, dammit". The man who said it originally, when told Germans were offering surrender questioned whether the Germans were offering too surrender, when told it was the other way around he responded "nuts". And then Colonel Harper added his own definition to the reply.</p>
<p>It would seem to me that Colonel Harper, who had been given the message by McAuliffe, was more than competent to interpret the message. We should make it clear that the interpretation is the one he gave. <a href="../../../d/j/_/User%7EDJ_Clayworth_c4dc.html" title="User:DJ Clayworth">DJ Clayworth</a> 16:18, 19 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>According to <a href="../../../l/a/w/Laws_of_war.html" title="Laws of war">Laws of war</a>, some German soldiers wore American uniforms, therefore not having right to legal protection, so they were killed even after they surrendered. Could somebody explain it here? -- <a href="../../../e/r/r/User%7EError_ca98.html" title="User:Error">Error</a> 01:58 Apr 17, 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>I am attempting to research this, but haven't found any obvious references to a specific incident yet. I was able to determine that a specific S.S. unit was tasked with capturing a pair of key bridges behind Allied lines. They actually did operate behind American lines in jeeps wearing American uniforms, sowing confusion. This unit may have been involved in the Malmedy massacre. Near the end of the battle they were used in a spoiling attack and mostly wiped out.</p>
<p>I think I remember an incident from the movie titled "Battle of the Bulge" which may or may not have been historically accurate. In the movie, an S.S. unit seized a checkpoint behind Allied lines and massacred Americans passing through, dumping their bodies behind the checkpoint. The ruse was discovered and some of the S.S. attempted to surrender but were shot. Could someone who has seen the movie more recently do better? Better yet, can anyone trace down actual historical examples of Allied forces in World War II engaging in reprisal? <a href="../../../c/l/a/User%7EClarka_5ba3.html" title="User:Clarka">clarka</a></p>

<li>The text mentions two competing plans, says "one called for...", but never explicitly completes the contrast. (Presumably the first was the idea of pinching out Hodges and the second was the plan actually implemented? If so, it needs to be made specific.)</li>

<p>Their was intelligence about the build-up of troops and tanks and supplys by the 67th Tactical Reconnaissance Group of IX TAC flew 242 missions labled successful in the month before Dec. 16th Along withe the 10th Photo Reconnaissance Group of XIX TAC, it compiled a picture of impressive and growing buildups just west of the Rhine-and eventually moving toward the Eifel. The Sightings included trainloads of tiger tank, 50 search lights in one location, and concentrations of hospital trains. Colonel Dickson, the G-2 at Hodges' headquarters at Spa who was more immediately concerned with the Ardennes, issued a lengthy-and afterward much debated-intelligence summary on 12-10-44 designated estimate #37. Also General Strong, according to testimomy, corroborated by Bedell Smith, Strong was so impressed and disturbed by the enemy's capacity to strike with his armored reserve in the Ardennes that about the 1st week in Dec. the SHAEF chief of staff suggested he visit the 12th army group and convey a warning directly to Bradley. Strong said he saw Bradley for three quarters of an hour, but that Bradley replied he was aware of the danger and that he earmarked certain divisions to move into the Ardennes should the enemy attack there. In the Book Eisenhower's Lieutenauts by Russell F. Weigley, Published by Indiana University Press copyright 1974, Part four The Disputed Middle Ground Chapter 17 page 320 Attack in the Ardennes I'm taking some lines about intelligence out for the following reasons. 1) "The lack of radio traffic should have alerted Allied intelligence that something was up". No, the usual interpretation of there being no increase in radio traffic is that <i>nothing</i> is up. Otherwise why bother to use motorcycle couriers? 2) "Enigma was decoding German radio traffic". No, Enigma was <i>encoding</i> German radio traffic. <b>Ultra</b> was decoding it. 3) Use of motorcycle couriers. Added by the same person who added the above two, so I'd like to see a reference before it goes back. We need to be sure that what we write here is correct. <a href="../../../d/j/_/User%7EDJ_Clayworth_c4dc.html" title="User:DJ Clayworth">DJ Clayworth</a> 16:03, 19 Dec 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>That was me with Enigma stuff ... Can't remember the title, but I was referring to a autobiography by one of the (senior) guys at Bletchley.</p>
<p>And the thing about radio traffic was NOT "no _increase_ in radio traffic". I said "lack" of radio traffic. This guy said that, in hindsight, they should have suspected something was up because radio traffic dropped to suspiciously low levels.</p>
<p>I thought it was important to mention specifically because Enigma meant that practically every attempted surprise mounted by the Germans failed. This battle was unusual in that it did achieve surprise, and that was the reason why.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I can't hunt up the book for reference because last I remember it was at my mother's.</p>

<p>Could someone please clarify what the numbers in the table on the right mean, specifically the ones under "Strength"? As far as I know, about 600,000 Americans fought in the Battle of the Bulge (not 80,000) and another 55,000 Britons, against a German force of about 500,000 (not 200,000). (Unless the "men" mentioned are only infantry, in which case that should be clarified as well as the total numbers of servicemen involved.)</p>
<p>The casualty numbers also need explanation, because the actual numbers vary among witnesses, historians and statisticians, and because casualties can mean both the number of troops killed during the battle as well as the number of troops eliminated from the battle (captured, killed, wounded, missing in action, etc.). --JeR 22:12, 11 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm a Belgian and never linked the name battle of the Bulge to this battle. Checked out why it is named so.

<p>This is one of the best examples of Wikipedia? The German troops who fought in the battle of the bulge were mostly new recruits, and hardly the well trained troops that were fighting earlier on. With the exception of the SS Panzer divisions, it was mostly a last ditch gamble. The best troops were all fighting in the east. The German troops involved in this battle were about 10% of the total available. No one on wikipedia knows this???</p>

<dd>That's a valid point, but I think you are misinterpriting what the article says.

<dd>I think it was me who used 'cream' to begin with, and I still would if no one objected. Yes, the units involved included a loot of noobs, including some that probably should never have been drafted to begin with. But at the end of six months of strategic setbacks on all fronts, and while needing to shore up a ~750 miles of eastern fron that was temporarily stable only because the Soviets had paused to catch their breath after the summer's grand-scale overrun, the German army managed to 'skim' their defenses and factory outputs to assemble and refit a large offensive force that included their most elite mechanized formations, a number of other mechanized formations, elite Luftwaffe infantry, commandos, parachutists, massive concentrations of artillery and rocket batteries, etc. Yes, there were other elite units still operating elsewhere, but not in this kind of concentration. In context I think it's quite fair to refer to it as the 'cream' of the German army.</dd>

<p>I wish someone had written about the horrific conditions that the American soldiers (and presumably, the Germans also) had to endure. I have heard that support troops - cooks and truck drivers and the like - were sent to the front as replacements/reinforcements without adequate equipment and many lost their feet to frostbite because of inadequate footwear. Men, in the snow, without blankets or sleeping bags, would sleep standing up, leaning against each other, with their arms around each other's shoulders. I knew, in the late 50's, a man who had risen from an enlisted man to be company commander because his company was reduced by 80% due to casualties during the Battle of the Bulge. He was a natural leader who later, in civilian life, was frequently given advancement to supervisory positions. He invariably soon resigned because he could not stand being responsible for other people - he had seen too many of the men under him killed during the war. <a href="../../../t/o/o/User%7EToo_Old_9c4f.html" title="User:Too Old">Too Old</a> 07:24, 2004 Dec 1 (UTC)</p>

<p>The first sentence of the first paragraph should actually introduce and moderately summarize "Operation Stosser". Ideally, it lightly prepares the reader for interpretation of details that follow. Here instead, the reader must plunge into a monstrous sentence, a string of words stating some factual aside about "Operation Stosser", whatever the heck that is. What was the operation's purpose, how did it relate to the entire battle? The reader does not know. The sentence itself is almost incomprehensible, and poorly explains the operation's delay. The grammar is fine, but the style makes the meaning almost unintelligible. <a href="../../../x/m/n/User%7EXmnemonic_d4e1.html" title="User:Xmnemonic">User:Xmnemonic</a></p>

Err, did you miss <i>"Two major special operations were planned for the offensive; by October it was decided that Otto Skorzeny, the German commando who had rescued Benito Mussolini, was to lead a task force of English-speaking German soldiers in Operation Greif. These soldiers were to be dressed in American and British uniforms and wear dog-tags taken from corpses and POWs. Their job was to go behind American lines and change sign-posts, misdirect traffic, generally cause disruption and to seize bridges across the Meuse River between Liège and Namur. By late November another ambitious special operation was added, Colonel Friedrich August von der Heydte was to lead a Fallschirmjäger (paratrooper) Kampfgruppe in Operation Stösser a nighttime paratroop drop behind the Allied lines aimed at capturing a vital road junction near Malmedy."</i> in the "Planning" section? <a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGeneralPatton_882e.html" title="User:GeneralPatton">GeneralPatton</a> 21:07, 1 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>My understanding of "the Ardennes Offensive" is that this is the term the Germans use for it (hence: offensive). How it's rendered in German, I don't know.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">German troops lost to the defence of the Eastern Front</span></h2>
<p>From the extensive reading I've done, the main military significance of the Ardennes Offensive from the German point of view was that it seriously depleted remaining German military strength, especially in equipment such as tanks and fuel. This, at a time when every possible resource was needed to stave off the Soviet offensive that the Germans expected early in 1945, following the first Soviet incursion into East Prussia in October 1944, which was repulsed.</p>
<p>The Soviet offensive began on Jan. 13, and the heavily outnumbered German defenders fell back quickly. Red Army spearheads reached the Baltic coast in East Prussia on Jan. 26, cutting off flight from Königsberg, the provincial capital (now Kaliningrad, Russia). Many German military figures asserted that Hitler had squandered resources on the Ardennes Offensive, helping the Soviets overrun eastern Germany, which was subjected to vengeful pillaging by many Red Army soldiers, resulting in many thousands of civilian deaths.</p>

The resources committed by the Germans to the Battle of the Bulge (600 tanks, 1,900 guns), would have made very little difference in the East. The Soviets outnumbered the Germans on average by 9:1 in troops, 9 or 10:1 in artillery and 10:1 in tanks and self-propelled artillery. At the start of the Battle of Berlin <i>The Three Soviet Fronts had altogether 2.5 million men...; 6,250 tanks; 7,500 aircraft; <b>41,600 artillery pieces</b> and mortars; 3,255 truck-mounted Katyushas rockets, (nicknamed 'Stalin Organs'); and 95,383 motor vehicles, many manufactured in the USA.</i></dd>

<dd>Given that Hitler refused to let the troops west of the Rhine retreat and lost about 290,000 in the Battle of the Rhinelands it is difficult to argue that those he squandered in the Battle of the Bulge made any significat diffrence to the war on the Eastern Front (particularly as he put Himmler(!) in charge of the counter-attack mounted by Army Group Vistula against the Soviet January offensive ). If Hitler had pulled those Rhineland troops west of the Rhine behind the Rhine and used the resources of the Bulge in defence of that obstical, it might have been the Soviets who waited on the Elbe (or in Denmark and on the Rhine) for the Americans and British to arrive rather than the other way around. I doubt that the troops, 600 tanks and 1,600, artillery pieces of the Bulge would have slowed the Soviets down by more than a couple of weeks at most. It would not have stopped the "vengeful pillaging by many Red Army soldiers" and could easily have lead to more civilian deaths not less.<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Baird_Shearer_a81d.html" title="User:Philip Baird Shearer">Philip Baird Shearer</a> 18:58, 2 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Im finding conflicting info on what was written on that paper. Namely, the spelling 'nutz' rather then 'nuts' and and if there is a exclamation point or not. I did add some about the meaning though, as the use of nuts to mean crazy is much more common then to mean balls (which is tends to be used nearly as much nuts as balls to mean testiciles).<a href="../../../m/u/c/User%7EMuchenhaeser_4131.html" title="User:Muchenhaeser">Muchenhaeser</a> 07:18, 23 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Never heard "nutz" as a spelling of this. I would expect, him being a General, that he could actually spell! After all he wasn't naming a hip-hop album or a washing powder. Sure, if you take the word out of context 'crazy' is the most common usage. However, as a single word, in response to a disagreeable suggestion, I don't think it holds water. The two possible interpretation of the word 'nuts' when it takes its 'crazy' meaning is as an adjective (<i>you are nuts</i>) or a plural (<i>you are a lot of nuts</i>). Neither of these seem to fit, as there is no reason not to use the whole phrase. I think what clinches it for me though is the hints you find in several soures that the reply the messenger was initially told to send was also one word, but not fit to be printed here; and that the official reply had to be toned down. It's easy to think of a one-word obscene equivalent of the 'testicles' meaning and not so easy for the 'crazy' meaning. <a href="../../../d/j/_/User%7EDJ_Clayworth_c4dc.html" title="User:DJ Clayworth">DJ Clayworth</a> 21:04, 30 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Usual anti Montgomery bias</span></h2>
<p>Essentially this article suffers from the same POV problems as all the WWII articles in Wikipedia where Montgomery is a major figure. For example, the delay of Montgomery of a counter attack on Jan 3 rather than Jan 1 is simply dismissed as having no reason. Why not equally question, why the Germans were able to launch the attack in the first place. Why was the defense in the Ardennes forest so thinly spread that it allowed the Germans to break through initially with such devastating effect. To quote the PBS documentary about Eisenhower, featuring historians such as Stephen Ambrose: "The Americans were overwhelmed. One after another their positions caved in. In one instance, 7,000 soldiers surrendered at once. Replacements were rushed to the front. Units which had never seen battle were now fighting on the front lines and getting massacred. The Germans seemed unstoppable." This issue is not even addressed although it shows a major failing on someone's part to defend that area correctly. Montgomery had many issues with Eisenhower's broad strategy before the Battle, and perhaps this was an area he had already drawn attention to as being weak and being in need of more logistical support. Perhaps, Montgomery's more ponderous approach would have prevented the attack in the first place. I don't know, but it needs addressing. This usual anti-Montgomery bias has no place in an encyclopedia that purports to be NPOV, and frankly almost all these articles need rewriting.</p>
<p>A far better and balanced account which could be used as a basis of a decent article can be found here:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.army.mil/cmh-pg/brochures/ardennes/aral.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.army.mil/cmh-pg/brochures/ardennes/aral.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.army.mil/cmh-pg/brochures/ardennes/aral.htm</a></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>In reply to this ... and citing as my authority Ultra sources ...</p>
<p>This seems to be an extreme version of the stress between the British and American approaches to things. Americans are gung-ho, Brits tend to be more cautious.</p>
<p>Patton (and Ike) made very extensive use of Ultra intelligence, Montgomery apparently hated it. So, in this instance, where Ultra failed then yes Monty would almost certainly have done a far better job of withstanding the assault. But on the whole, Patton's approach was better I think.</p>
<p>The thing is, from the Germans' POV the combination was devastating. If you try to build up a defensive wall to keep Monty out, Patton nips round the back. If you try and get mobile to deal with Patton, Monty launches an all-out assault straight through the front door. Lose-lose either way.</p>
<p>The only problem is, as here, when Monty delays an urgent manouevre. Loads of Germans escaped because Monty delayed his pincer intended to cut them off. This sounds horribly like a rerun of the Falaise Gap. And if Monty had pulled his finger out then, this would probably have never happened. The 6th Panzer division (which wrecked Market Garden) should have been trapped and destroyed at Falaise.</p>
