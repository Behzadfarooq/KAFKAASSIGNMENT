<p>Like others, I've noticed that in Modern Warfare the introductions are far too brief, and without historical context. When I've tried to rectify this, you have simply deleted what I have written. I know that you have said that this article is on modern warfare, and not WW1 and WW2, but modern history (and therefore modern warfare) does encompass WW1 and WW2. Now, I can understand that you want to provide a stable chronological order (hence separate industrial and modern warfare articles) but you can not separate total war from its historical context, especially since it has only ever happened in WW1 and WW2 - Never after.</p>
<p>Additionally, whilst I somewhat disagreed with the inclusion of 'total war' in the first place, since it is not a type of warfare like say, <a href="../../../b/i/o/Biological_warfare.html" title="Biological warfare">biological warfare</a> or <a href="../../../n/a/v/Naval_warfare.html" title="Naval warfare">Naval warfare</a>, I decided it wasn't too much of a problem. However, what is a problem is that your definition is generalised, slightly inaccurate and has the wrong focus. For one, total war has not been practiced for centuries, it is a relatively new development in warfare (and if it had been practiced for centuries, why did you include it in <a href="../../../m/o/d/Modern_warfare.html" title="Modern warfare">modern warfare</a>?). Secondly, your explanation of it "<i>Total war is a 20th century term to describe a war in which countries or nations use all of their resources to destroy another organized country's or nation's ability to engage in war</i>" is pretty simplistic. One of the most important aims of every war is to destroy your enemy's ability to fight, and so you're not really providing any real extra information there. Finally, your focus on civilian infrastructure, etc. becoming targets does not really provide the whole picture; the real uniqueness of total war comes from the massive mobilisation of the home front, thereby involving nations' societies in a major way, and not just their military forces. <a href="../../../o/p/i/User%7EOpiniastrous_519c.html" title="User:Opiniastrous">Opiniastrous</a> 01:32, 23 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Why the hell do you keep deleting the stuff I write? I mean, I wrote good stuff on the naval warfare intro (I added things like cruisers, AWDs and sub-surface/surface/air fighting) and I added a lot to the nuclear war intro. (including current tactical and strategic usage and modern-day nuclear threats like dirty-bombs). On total war, I've just deleted it though. Frankly, it didn't really belong in the first place.</dd>

<p>Much the same complaint here. For one, the intro. is simplistic. It doesn't go into the various zones of naval warfare (sub-surface, surface and air) and some of the bassic details of those, ignores some types of important naval vessels (like the <a href="../../../c/r/u/Cruiser.html" title="Cruiser">cruiser</a>), and finally, it fails to mention capabilities other than attack capabilities. Even though these are introductions, surely they shouldn't just be paid off and given minimal attention to detail. They should be able to provide the reader with a good introduction to the topic so they know what they are going into before they actually click that link. Sorry to get off on the wrong foot here, but this is what I feel about the aforementioned. <a href="../../../o/p/i/User%7EOpiniastrous_519c.html" title="User:Opiniastrous">Opiniastrous</a> 01:32, 23 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

I'm not question the facts, I'm pointing out your lack references/sources, and therefore the lack of demonstrated verifiability. If we regularly accept such unsourced articles, and don't seek sources, then its *very* easy for somebody other than you, to slip something in that's not accurate. By providing a simple link, you allow somebody to verify something quickly, and move on. According to <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVerifiability_beed.html" title="WP:Verifiability">WP:Verifiability</a> "<i>Articles in Wikipedia should refer to facts, assertions, theories, ideas, claims, opinions, and arguments that have been published by a reputable or credible publisher. The threshold for inclusion in Wikipedia is verifiability, not truth.</i>".

<dd>Please be <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a>. I made the assumption that you were going to write more than one single fact (the school's closed), and would need to cite a source. If the only thing you have to say is the school is closed, then the article will need to be deleted. It is patently absurd to create an article with one sentence. Also, you keep missing the point, that I never contested the fact. You don't seem to understand what verifiability means. If this article isn't expanded and sourced, I will, for the first time ever, nominate a school article for deletion. This has to be one of the worst school articles I've ever seen, and I don't know why you thought to make it. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 15:53, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

He is against the existence of Israel as a state. There are several countries in the world that do not recognize Israel as a country. At least for the case of Ahmadinejad and Iran, it has nothing to do with "Jewish people", as Iran is hosting the biggest Jewish community in the middle east. Even in such a fundamentalist regime in Iran, Jewish community is recognized in Iran and Jewish people are represented in the parliament. Is there a statement by Ahmadinejad which clearly indicates anti-semitism&#160;? (I may be unaware of ...) Thanks.<a href="../../../m/i/t/User%7EMITSO_423d.html" title="User:MITSO">User:MITSO</a></p>

<p>Good work on War of 1812 categorization, but keep in mind capitalization standards. In "Category:War of 1812 Forts", forts should not be capitalized, since it's not a proper noun. Same goes with "Category:Naval Battles of the War of 1812", where battles should not be capitalized. You might want to list these as candidates for "speedy rename". --<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Myers_58fc.html" title="User:Kevin Myers">Kevin Myers</a> | <a href="../../../k/e/v/User_talk%7EKevin_Myers_d288.html" title="User talk:Kevin Myers">(complaint dept.)</a> 02:30, 30 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>My comments on this page, as evidenced above, were about removing deletion tags, not removing talk page messages. Since numerous editors have warned you to avoid personal attacks and remain civil but you have not done so, I'm blocking you for 24 hours for personal attacks and an additional 24 hours for wikistalking Cool Cat. If you choose to continue this behavior when the block expires, we'll increase the blocks until you learn how to cooperate with other contributors and abide by site policy. -- <a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay">Essjay</a> · <a href="../../../e/s/s/User_talk%7EEssjay_a39e.html" title="User talk:Essjay">Talk</a> 20:39, 30 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks for all your contributions in <a href="../../../s/u/b/Subsidized_housing.html" title="Subsidized housing">subsidized housing</a>. I just ran across the page, created in December 2005. As it happens, others began organizing this information under the article <a href="../../../a/f/f/Affordable_housing.html" title="Affordable housing">affordable housing</a>. I provided a link between the articles, but don't really see a clear difference between the content of they articles as the exist now. The two are not the same subject but there's not enough content to justify the current split. Consider truncating the entry in <a href="../../../s/u/b/Subsidized_housing.html" title="Subsidized housing">subsidized housing</a> since the new article is far less developed than <a href="../../../a/f/f/Affordable_housing.html" title="Affordable housing">affordable housing</a>.
