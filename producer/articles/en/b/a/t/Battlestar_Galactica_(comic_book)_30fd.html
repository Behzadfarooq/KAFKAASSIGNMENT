<p>The comic book <i>Battlestar Galactica</i>, based on the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Broadcasting_Company_349c.html" title="American Broadcasting Company">ABC</a> television series of the same name, was published monthly by <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marvel_Comics_b294.html" title="Marvel Comics">Marvel Comics</a> from <a href="../../../1/9/7/1978.html" title="1978">1978</a> through <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980.html" title="1980">1980</a>, and lasted 23 issues.</p>
<p>Although there were other attempts to adapt <i>Battlestar Galactica</i> into a comic book format, the Marvel series is considered by many to have been the most successful in terms of run, sales, and content.</p>
<p>This was accomplished against some notable odds. Although Roger McKenzie was most often the writer, and <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walt_Simonson_969f.html" title="Walt Simonson">Walt Simonson</a> the most regular artist, the book also had a heavy rotation of guest writers and artists.</p>
<p>Marvel Comics’ began its adaptation of <i>Battlestar Galactica</i> with Super Special #8, a magazine format comic released as a tie-in to the start of the series. Based on an early script of the three hour series premiere "Saga of a Star World", this adaptation, which gave a relatively short treatment to the third hour, was also released in a tabloid format and then later as a paperback as well. The tabloid version was also printed by Whitman Comics. It’s success led Marvel to print a regular monthly comic depicting the adventures of the ragtag fleet.</p>
<p>Scripted by McKenzie and drawn by <a href="../../../e/r/n/Ernie_Colon_8724.html" title="Ernie Colon">Ernie Colon</a>, the <i>Battlestar Galactica Super Special</i> is an attractive adaptation with unusual panel design and use of shadow. In particular, the attack on Caprica, the psychic starting point of the series, is treated in a vivid and memorable way.</p>
<p>When the regular run of Marvel’s <i>Battlestar Galactica</i> comic book began some months later, the Super Special adaptation was expanded by several pages, and provided the material for the first three issues of the comic.</p>
<p>The direct adaptation of the series continued in issues #4 and #5 which chronicled the adventures depicted in the two part television episode "Lost Planet of the Gods". Roger McKenzie continued as scripter, with Walter Simonson now providing the art.</p>
<p>With issue #6, the TV adaptations ceased, and Marvel’s team began to create new stories about the characters of the <i>Battlestar Galactica</i> universe, picking up from where issue #5 left off.</p>
<p>It is important to note, that from this point, both in terms of story content and the narrative arc, Marvel’s <i>Battlestar Galactica</i> does deviate somewhat from the televised adventures. Marvel's contract with <a href="../../../u/n/i/Universal_Studios_23de.html" title="Universal Studios">Universal Studios</a> specifically did not allow them to use anything from the television series that followed "Lost Planet Of The Gods". Despite this, Marvel made a conscious decision to continue the story with their own vision of how the series would progress, and so presents an interesting interpretation of <i>Galactica</i> – through a Marvel paradigm.</p>
<p>In should also be noted that although the run of the <i>Battlestar Galactica</i> comic coincided with the broadcast of the short-lived <i>Galactica</i> sequel series, <i><a href="../../../g/a/l/Galactica_1980.html" title="Galactica 1980">Galactica 1980</a></i> on <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Broadcasting_Company_349c.html" title="American Broadcasting Company">ABC</a>, the newer program was never referred to in the pages of the comic, apart from the letters page, and no attempts were made to construct the comic with the events of <i>Galactica 1980</i> as a foreseen plot outcome.</p>
<p>In addition, much of the comic’s run took place in the magnetic void which the rag tag fleet encountered in the TV episode "Lost Planet of the Gods". In the end of the TV episode, the fleet moves back into normal space, leaving the void behind, but in the comics the rag tag fleet remains in the void beginning in issue #4, with the fleet finally returning to regular space in issue #14. This makes placing the episodes within the span of the TV series difficult, since much of the action could be surmised to have taken place between "Lost Planet of the Gods" and "Lost Warrior".</p>
<p>In terms of tone, many of the <i>Galactica</i> comics had classic horror elements, which was a theme visited in only a couple episodes of the TV series, as exemplified by the evil Ovions of "Saga of a Star World". An incomplete list of monsters from the comic series would include a space <a href="../../../v/a/m/Vampire.html" title="Vampire">vampire</a> (issue #9), a carnivorous planet (issue #10), alien vermin (issue #15), a crewmember who transforms into a red ape (issues #17 and #18) and a monstrous <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shapeshifting.html" title="Shapeshifting">shapeshifter</a> (issue #21). Even the menacing and relentless Cylon Mark III in issue #16 owes as much of his origin to horror elements as he does to science fiction. Taken as a whole, Marvel’s <i>Galactica</i> is somewhat darker in tone than the series, but this not-so-subtle paranoia is arguable truer to the initial premise of the series than were some of the latter episodes of the television program.</p>
<p>Notably, the writers of the <i>Galactica</i> comic were quite willing to remove key characters from the dramatic mix for periods of time. From issues #6 to #12, Commander Adama is placed within a machine to help him remember the ancient writings he briefly saw on Kobol and, although we do spend some time in his dreams, he is effectively removed from commanding the <i>Galactica</i> for several issues, which of course sets up its own dramatic tension.</p>
<p>Another character who leaves the series for awhile is Starbuck, as part of perhaps the most effective story arc in the series. In this plotline the fleet stumbles upon Scavenger World, the dominion of the female space pirate Eurayle, who makes a deal to spare the Colonials if she can keep Starbuck at her side. The interactions between Starbuck and Eurayle are memorable, and the conclusion of the storyline, with a tremendous battle in issue #13, is a satisfying conclusion. At the end of the tale, Starbuck remains with Eurayle, and the fleet moves on without him, which of course sets us up for his triumphant return in issues #19 and #20.</p>
<p>Unlike both television series, the <i>Galactica</i> comic actually had a planned ending, with a series of plot devices being wound up in the final two part story of issues #22 and #23. In the course of solving a mystery, Lieutenant Jolly finds adventure and romance and helps in figuring out the long sought coordinates for Earth. A tongue in cheek adventure ably drawn and scripted by Walt Simonson this plotline provided a strong end for a memorable series.</p>

<p>This children’s magazine published a serialized <i>BSG</i> strip from October 20, 1979, to October 11, 1980. The four untitled storylines spanned 52 issues, 13 two-page chapters per storyline, from 1979 #43 to 1980 #42 (the numbering started over again at #1 in January of 1980, though the storyline continued to fold as normal). Surprisingly well-rendered and well-written, this ongoing Galactica comic has been all but forgotten.</p>

<p>For a long time after this, <i>Battlestar Galactica</i> did not appear in comics, then in July 1995, Maximum Press published a well received mini-series that explained what it was that had happened to our heroes in the intervening years. Ignoring the storyline of the much derided <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Broadcasting_Company_349c.html" title="American Broadcasting Company">ABC</a> sequel series <i>Galactica 1980</i>, this tale followed the crew as they finally approached Earth, led by Commander Apollo, who had succeeded his father.</p>
<p>This mini-series was popular enough that it spawned a group of sequels including "Apollo’s Journey", "The Enemy Within", and "Starbuck" all published as four issue series in 1995 through early 1996. "Journey’s End", the final four issue series, broke many <i>Galactica</i> conventions, and contains the memorable sequence of the <i>Galactica</i> travelling through time back to the Cylon attack on Caprica. After the publishing of the <i>Battlestar Galactica Compendium</i> in early 1997 however, the steam ran out of this endeavor and Maximum announced it would no longer be publishing <i>Galactica</i> based comics.</p>

<p>In 1998, Realm Press brought Battlestar Galactica back to comics again beginning with their "Battlestar Galactica Search for Sanctuary" single issue special. Other one shots were subsequently published. Later, Realm introduced a monthly comic titled "Battlestar Galactica Season 3". Unfortunately, this series only ran for three issues before it was cancelled, and shortly thereafter Realm abandoned the project altogether.</p>
