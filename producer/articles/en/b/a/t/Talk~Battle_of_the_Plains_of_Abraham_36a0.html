<p>Hello,</p>
<p>In the aftermath of the battle of The Plains of Abraham on Sept 13, 1759 the dead on both sides were collected. It is known that General Wolfe's body was transported back to England in a cask or caskette of Alcohol. At what location on the field or in the city were the British war dead buried?</p>
<p>Iain MacNeill Waterloo, On Canada</p>
<p>It is my understanding that, as was common practice at the time, enlisted men from both sides were buried in common graves on the battle field. Did religious considerations play a role, as in different pits for the Catholics and the Protestants, I don't know. It is my understanding that French dead from the battle of 1760 laid buried under a monument that currently lies at the corner of Chemin Sainte-Foy and Avenue Des Braves. I understand that the monument was displaced a few meters from its original location during a commemorative and restoration event maybe a century ago, and that bones were found and sent at some new resting place.</p>
<p>As I mentioned in the 'Trivia' section, it is my understanding that the wounded from both sides were sent to the Hopital General by the St. Charles River, and that those who perished at the hospital were buried just outside in a yard that has now been converted into a military cemetery. Montcalm's remains have recently been transferred from the Ursuline convent to a mausoleum on the grounds of this cemetery. I took part in the parade.</p>

<p>Everytime I read something on this battle, I see different numbers. The story is mostly the same, but the numbers just never match. I invite the author(s) of this article to compare their sources with these two:</p>

<p>Maybe this will help us determine the original source of the numbers. I am personally confused by all these different accounts. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMathieugp_c3f3.html" title="User:Mathieugp">Mathieugp</a> 22:09, 13 Feb 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I was confused by it as well...I think most of the specific numbers I used are from the Historical Atlas of Canada. The problem seems to be that there were different periods of fighting using different numbers of troops, and that there were also reserves, reinforcements and unused garrisons on both sides, so total numbers probably don't match the actual numbers of men used. I guess it's the same for every other battle. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Bishop_face.html" title="User:Adam Bishop">Adam Bishop</a> 22:13, 13 Feb 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have to say this article seems to stray from a neutral point of view. The surrender of the French is described as "the ultimate tragic outcome," and the treatment of the decision by France to leave Canada, "a poor, underpopulated colony" and focus on its rich Caribbean possessions borders on historical editorializing, not reporting. Something tells me the author, or one of the authors, was rooting for the French. <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatrick_Grey_Anderson_1c3c.html" title="User:Patrick Grey Anderson">Patrick Grey Anderson</a> 21:35, 5 Mar 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>An anon seems to have added the "tragic outcome" and similar bits...but it was me who wrote about the rich Caribbean and poor Canada. I suppose what I mean is, France thought it was more worthwhile to keep a profitable Caribbean island, rather than a much bigger colony that had a small population and didn't produce much for them. I didn't mean to editorialize or sound pro-French, so you are welcome to reword it in a more neutral way. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Bishop_face.html" title="User:Adam Bishop">Adam Bishop</a> 21:40, 5 Mar 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Okay.</p>
<p>1. The French and Indian War is the same thing as the Seven Years' War, as the War of British Conquest (Canada), as the War of Conquest (Quebec). Same war, different names. It's like the War of the Spanish Succession, also known as Queen Anne's War in former British colonies in the New World.</p>
<p>2. Scholarly sources. Scholarly sources, scholarly sources, scholarly sources. Refereed- peer-edited- journals! Random web sites should not, ever, be cited as sources. Why? Because significant facts and figures are listed. For example, Montcalm did not send out 4000 men to Wolfe's 4800, he sent out 4500 to Wolfe's 4400. (W.J. Eccles, "The Preemptive Conquest, 1749-1763." Readings in Canadian History: Pre-Confederation, 4th edition, R. Douglas Francis and Donald B. Smith eds. (Toronto: Harcourt Brace and Company, 1994): 180.).</p>
<p>3. Montcalm wasn't afraid of a siege, for resons listed in the article (namely that to bring provisions for the army up, the English would have had to haul them up the cliffs).</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Here, I disagree--and this has been quite the debate over the past three and a half centuries. Montcalm DID have reason to fear the Brits might entrench on the Plains, and that they WOULD be re-supplied, thus opening up a second front on the city (the other being the entrenchments at Beauport). The geographic reality of the area is not all hanging cliffs. After the initial assault--gloriously (and questionably) depicted in illustrations of the time--, most of Wolfe's contingent probably went up a stream bed that comes down from the Plains onto the Anse-aux-Foulons cove. The bed is called la Coulée Saint-Denis, and though steep, it is hardly impracticable by soldiers known to carrying heavy military loads over portages in the wilderness. I DO feel Montcaml's best strategy on the morning of the 13 would have been to just roll over and go back to sleep--considering also the onset of fall, a rather uncomfortable season for trench warfare, to say the least. But as the military commander, Montcalm must have felt he had no choice but to come out and meet Wolfe. I understand he feared loosing his land communication with Montreal. He also distrusted the fortifications, and especially, the colonial officers that commanded its artillery. lambda 03:59, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>4. Again, see the figures. Altered to be in line with what we can best ascertain to be true.</p>

<p>Is it proper to say that this battle is part of the French and Indian War? I know that's what Americans call the "North American phase" of the Seven Years' War, but we tend not to say that in Canada, and I'm sure Britain and France don't say that either. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Bishop_face.html" title="User:Adam Bishop">Adam Bishop</a> 06:43, 12 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>It is certainly true that this battle is part of the French and Indian War and that it is part of the Seven Years War. The previous arrangment of the sentence implied that American called the entire Seven Years War the French and Indian War which is not true. We call both the European part and the overarching conflict the Seven Years War. The British are not consistent in this regard as they call the fighting during this same time period between:</dd>

<dd>Well, I've checked in the Canadian history text books I have available (published in 1972, 1998, and 2000) and they all call it the Seven Years' War. (A book about the history of Quebec that I have simply refers to it as "the Conquest.") Do Americans really say this battle took place in "both" wars? Since this battle took place between the British and the French, and happened in the actual seven years of the Seven Years' War, I think SYW should at least be more prominent. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Bishop_face.html" title="User:Adam Bishop">Adam Bishop</a> 19:10, 13 Aug 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes we really say that it took place in both wars. It is no different than saying that the Battle of Midway was a battle in the Pacific War and in World War II. But we wouldn't say that D-day was a battle in the Pacific War, which is equivalent to what the article used to say. All of the battles in the French and Indian War took place between the British and the French and why the British named it the Seven Years War makes about as much sense as the name of the Hundred Years War. (Of course, Americans traditionally count WWII as 1941-1945 but merrily include the invasion of Poland in 1939 as part of the War.) Any suggestion on how to make it more prominent? <a href="../../../r/m/h/User%7ERmhermen_d338.html" title="User:Rmhermen">Rmhermen</a> 20:53, Aug 13, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ah you Americans and your crazy war-naming schemes&#160;:) I'm not sure how to reword the opening; it just doesn't make sense to me to mention the French and Indian War at all...or, I should say, it would make more sense (to me) to say "the Seven Years' War, also known as the F&amp;I War," but if that's not how you actually use it, then I don't know. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Bishop_face.html" title="User:Adam Bishop">Adam Bishop</a> 21:05, 13 Aug 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The war started in 1754 in North America, 1756 in Europe and India, 1758 in Africa, 1759 in the Caribbean, 1762 in the Pacific, so they call it the Seven Years Wars. Our system is crazy? What is that the weighted median length of the war? (I could say it doesn't make sense to me to mention the Seven Years War as you probably would never see that below a college-level text but that might reflect too much on the U.S. education system.) How would "was a battle during the French and Indian War, the U.S. name for the North American phase of the Seven Years' War." sound? <a href="../../../r/m/h/User%7ERmhermen_d338.html" title="User:Rmhermen">Rmhermen</a> 22:58, Aug 13, 2004 (UTC)

<dd>Heh, it's the "Seven Years', More or Less, War". I don't think "...the F&amp;I War, the US name..." would work either. I guess what I am thinking is that the battle is more important to Canadians than to Americans, so Canadian usage should be used (this is my POV of course, since it's probably equally important to both). But I don't want to be difficult/nationalistic, so maybe we should just leave it as it is now. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Bishop_face.html" title="User:Adam Bishop">Adam Bishop</a> 06:10, 14 Aug 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have to second Adams's opinion in regard to the name. The 2 names I have ever heard in Québec were "the seven years war" (relatively neutral and put the battles into their context) and "the conquest" (which make sense from a francophone standpoint but not from outside). "french and indian war" to me similarly only make sense if you were from the US or the UK. To people of french descent, using it would be like refering to a conflict as "That war we were involved in" and for other peoples, it sound as if you were picking on the francophones and the natives.--<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarc_pasquin_7f83.html" title="User:Marc pasquin">Marc pasquin</a> 00:13, 8 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>While normally sympathetic to this type of distinction between a war and its theatres, I have to say that I've been pretty shocked at the mercilessness with which so many Seven Years' War-related articles have been hunted down and edited to fit the American nomenclature. As far as I know, the United States is the only nation to make reference to "French and Indian Wars" in its histories. As previously stated, we Canadians, as well as the Brits and French, all refer to the North American fighting as part of the "Seven Years' War" (especially since the character and outcome of our war was greatly influence by events in Europe). Germans, Austrians, Spaniards, Swedes, and Russians use the same nomenclature.</dd>

Good day, I realize this discussion has been going on for a loooong time but my understanding is that the French and Indian War is a valid subset of the greater conflict known as the Seven Years War. It essentially lasted 5 of the 7 years (7 years being when war was declared in 1756 and the Peace of Versaille was written in 1763). I think it is fair to differentiate the two but that means setting a finite scope to what is included in the French and Indian War, and what beyond that makes up the rest of the Seven Years' War. The fact that most of the "European" world and Canada (which has been under British influence and thus impacted by British history-writers and war-namers) use the term "Seven Years War" is nothing more than in a matter of perspective and people cannot deny that a finite amount of the larger conflict consists of the French and Indian War.</p>

<p>The first paragraph of the second section mentions "100 Canadian militia". Lower Canada didn't exist yet. Is this meant to refer to New French militia? Kimholder 16:13, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>No, "<a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada%2C_New_France_5ed2.html" title="Canada, New France">Canadian</a>" is correct. "New French" could refer to the inhabitants of <i>any</i> French North-American colony, from Acadia to <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Orleans_615c.html" title="New Orleans">New Orleans</a>, and isn't much use here. <a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlbrecht_dcaf.html" title="User:Albrecht">Albrecht</a> 17:23, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I understand New France was divided in four segments: i) Acadia (now the Maritime Provinces of Canada), ii) Canada (the St. Lawrence Valley, Outaouais Valley, Richelieu Valley, Ohio Valley, and Great Lakes or "Pays-d'en-Haut"), iii) a hyphen area where the Ohio River meets the Mississippi River, and iv) Louisiana. Therefore, militia raised in the government of Canada, New France, is appropriately called "Canadian militia". One must understand that current use of the name Canada (from sea to sea to sea), does not express the same national reality as it did in New France. One can also argue that the current confusion is born from a wilful political choice to recuperate the word "Canada" to name a country that currently holds two founding European nations, whereas the original use of "Canadian" strictly meant "French colonial of a given region of New France". Enough said. lambda 04:17, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Actually, I think "The Battle of the Plains" covered the 1,5 km extent of the plateau, now mostly developped land. Does this make numerical sense? 4500 soldiers in two ranks.

<p>Good work so far. I just have a few suggestions and here they are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Is it possible to get an image of Wolfe apart from the one showing him dieing. Maybe a portrait seeing as you have an image for Montcalm.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>Also most editors recommend having eg pp. 39 instead of p. 39 in the inline citations.</li>
</ol>
<p>Those are all my suggestions, good work and good luck in the future with this article. <a href="../../../k/y/r/User%7EKyriakos_b5e6.html" title="User:Kyriakos">Kyriakos</a> 06:20, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I also suggest requesting to get the article a formal peer review at WPMILHIST peer review deparment. <a href="../../../k/y/r/User%7EKyriakos_b5e6.html" title="User:Kyriakos">Kyriakos</a> 20:56, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for the comments! I'll work on making some adjustments as I go along here, and look at a peer review soon. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Fox_d099.html" title="User:Tony Fox">Tony Fox</a> <small><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Fox_1932.html" title="User talk:Tony Fox">(arf!)</a></small> 04:39, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I did a couple of very small edits. Notes were changed to References, References were changed to Sources and a small fix on the External Edits. This is a very good article - covers all the points extremely well, nicely and completely referenced, well written. Congrats. Of course the next step is a formal <a href="../../../p/e/e/WP%7EPeer_review_5283.html" title="WP:Peer review">peer review</a> and then submission for Featured article. I would do that soonest.<a href="../../../p/r/e/User%7EPRehse_b792.html" title="User:PRehse">Peter Rehse</a> 09:32, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>There should be a separate article about the park itself, currently Plains of Abraham forwards to the entry about the battle. How does one go about getting a redirect cancelled?--<a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffmilner_9b90.html" title="User:Jeffmilner">Jeff</a> 14:54, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
