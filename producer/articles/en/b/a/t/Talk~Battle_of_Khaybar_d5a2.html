<dd>Sorry, but I simply can't make myself believe that you don't understand, Timothy.

<dd>This is a completely nonsensical assertion that the article was listed on DYK as a result of an error; furthermore, there is no policy, guideline or whatever saying that the Did you know template should be removed from an article's talk page under certain circumstances. If Netscott or JEREMY thought the article should not appear on the Main Page, they should have stated their arguments on the Did you know talk page. It's silly to raise issues several months after the fact. Pecher <sup><a href="../../../p/e/c/User_talk%7EPecher_4b24.html" title="User talk:Pecher">Talk</a></sup> 19:20, 10 July 2006 (UTC)

<p>I don't have context on what the problem was, and wasn't the admin that added the selection or the template but I'm not sure I see the harm in leaving the template on the talk page. You could add a note if you wanted that it was added by mistake. But it's not a big deal, DYK is supposed to be fun and a way to introduce readers to new articles (that they might be able to improve).

<p>I see this article as anti-Muslim. It is based on western histories which are in fact derived and twisted from Muslim ones. Prophet Muhammad did not actually participate in Khaybar, he sent his cousin Ali as the leader of the army which is a known fact to all Muslims. Why is this stated as a fact-&gt;"Kinana ibn al-Rabi, the treasurer of Banu Nadir, whom Muhammad's followers first tortured, demanding to reveal the location of the hidden treasures of his tribe, and then beheaded" This is not true, torture to prisoners is forbidden to the Muslims, I am a Muslim and I know that Muslims especially at the time of the prophet were the most merciful conqueres in history, otherwise not so many people would be muslims today. Sure, booty was one of the goals, but the main reason of the conquest of Khaybar was that the Jews in Khaybar proved to be mortal enemies to the Muslims by helping the Alliance at the battle of the trench, spying, and ultimately attempted to take the life of the prophet. The prophet couldn't deal with them before because he was threatend by Quraish. Banu Quraizah were judged by a dying companion of the prophet named Sa'ad Ibn Ubadah. He was shot by an arrow during the battle of the trench, he was asked by the prophet to judge a suitable punishment for their betrayal of the alliance between them and the Muslims. Hence, he judged their men to be killed and their sons and women to be enslaved. This severe punishment is suitable for allying themselves with the Muslims and when combat starts they try to stab the Muslims from the back. This has nothing to do with them being Jews, it has to do everything with their betrayal</p>

<dd>Bless sins, you should not add claims such as "Muhammad moved to attack Khaybar in response to the settlement's incitement against the Madinah." without a source. Inserting such POV material isn't made acceptable by including a fact tag. It would appear that you are going to every article about Arabian Jews and inserting material to suggest that they fully deserved their grim fate, and are willing to use baseless claims from partisan/extremist sources or even no sources at all to do this.<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProabivouac_6a4d.html" title="User:Proabivouac">Proabivouac</a> 07:35, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The article in EI is written by L. Veccia Vaglieri so the statements made by the article are POV of Vaglieri. The article says: "If one accepts the idea of commercial activities undertaken especially by the Jews of Medina, one understands better the reasons for which Muhammad attacked them in particular. His hostility towards the Jews would have had economic causes similar to those which have brought about persecutions and pogroms in so many countries during the course of history...According to Caetani, Muhammad was moved to attack khÌ²aybar by motives of political opportunism: on the one hand, the pact concluded with Quraysh at Hudaybiyya gave him the assurance of not being attacked by them during the expedition; on the other hand, if he conquered khaybar he wouldbe able to satisfy with ample booty those of his companions who, having hoped to capture Mecca, were disappointed and discontented...Montgomery Watt has drawn attention to the fact that the Banu 'l-Nadir, driven out of Medina, had taken refuge in khaybar and that their chieftains and the chieftains of other Jewish groups, eager for revenge, were intriguing against Muhammad along with the Arabs tribes of the neighbourhood. So Muhammad had not only a just motive for attacking them, but there was also the positive necessity to destroy these enemies, more formidable even than the Quraysh because of their adherence to their own religion, their intelligence and their superior culture. Muhammad Husayn Haykal (385-6) maintains that the Prophet did not feel sure of the northern fringes of the peninsular: he was afraid lest the Jews established in the oases of Northern Arabia betray him, and lest Heraclius and Kisra seek help from them against him. The sources give support to the view of Montgomery Watt, showing that the Jews, already responsible for the coalition which had laid siege to Medina in 5 A.H. and worried by the growing power of the Prophet, continued to stir up the Arabs against him. Haykal's opinion, however, is to be rejected in that it is inappropriate to consider an event in the light of subsequent developments. In the year 7 A.H. Muhammad was not yet a figure to be reckoned with in the estimation of the rulers of the empires to the north of the peninsular. While giving full credit to the opinion of Montgomery Watt, one should not overlook the fact that the Prophet was in great need of arms and money to accomplish his objectives and he knew that he could find these among the Jews at khaybar (the sources give precise details of the number and type of arms captured by the Muslims from the Jews at Medina and at khaybar.)." --<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminz_b269.html" title="User:Aminz">Aminz</a> 08:43, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>If we have the relevant passage from Watt and Caetani, we can creat a passage which presents Caetani's, Watt's and Vaglieri's views in sequence. It does not seem to me that Vaglieri is dismissing Watt's view out of hand, only observing that Caetani's reasoning is equally valid.<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProabivouac_6a4d.html" title="User:Proabivouac">Proabivouac</a> 09:23, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>It also seems that Vaglieri is more pro Caetani than Watt. He does accept Watt's view but has his own view as well as in "While giving full credit to the opinion of Montgomery Watt, one should not overlook the fact ...". I need to go now but will try to find the other sources. Cheers, --<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminz_b269.html" title="User:Aminz">Aminz</a> 09:33, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>1. "Contemporary scholars believe that Muhammad moved to attack Khaybar in order to raise his prestige among his followers, as well as to capture booty to sustain subsequent conquests." This is quite factually wrong. 2. "Seen in this light, Muhammad's attacks against the Jews, first in Medina and then in Khaybar, have economic roots similar to those which have brought about persecutions and pogroms in other countries in the course of history." Usage of the terms pogroms,etc etc when the source doesn't mention it is meaningful. It is not even faithful to the source. "If one accepts"--&gt; "Seen in this light" 3.

<dd>Bless Sins, re Watt, it is a given that his view is notable and should be represented. However, you're pushing it too far, giving him significantly more space and clearly taking his position.

Instead you've treated it as just another source of valid facts. We should be relying upon Watt and other academics wherever possible.

<dd>Jeez, would you give me a minute? I'd already attributed the most controversial sentence before you showed up with your snarky comment, and I'm right now writing a compromise version for Watt. So hold on. Bear in mind that the siege engine point isn't really controversial, but the stuff about progroms is clearly so, and we must take care that it's presented neutrally.<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProabivouac_6a4d.html" title="User:Proabivouac">Proabivouac</a> 05:34, 11 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Also "Seen in this light" is different from "If one accepts the idea of commercial activities undertaken especially by the Jews of Medina". Further, there is no reason to follow EoI's order. i.e. adding Watt's quote after Veccia Vaglieri. Watt is certainly more renowned than Veccia Vaglieri.

<dl>
<dd>I'm happy to address everything, as we all should be. You can hardly blame me for the edit-warring which has plagued this page. Let's go through this one by one, and methodically. To start with, the scheming material does not belong under "Khaybar in the seventh century." It was placed there, apparently, to argue against Vaglieri's claim. The more logical place for it is in the section below, "Muhammad and the Jews of Medina." Would you agree?<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProabivouac_6a4d.html" title="User:Proabivouac">Proabivouac</a> 05:56, 11 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Yes and no. I think "Muhammad and the Jews of Medina" should not exist, as no one identifies this conflict as Jewish-Muslim. Even Vaglieri suggests the reasons were financial. Thus we should replace "Muhammad and the Jews of Medina" with "Political situation" or something like that. There we can present the poltics of the battle, including both Vaglieri and Watt. Btw, Im not blaming you of editwarring, I'm just upset that you reverted EVERYTHING I posted.<a href="../../../b/l/e/User%7EBless_sins_31e5.html" title="User:Bless sins">Bless sins</a> 06:05, 11 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Okay. I tend to agree with you about the section title. Though it is obviously largely Muslims vs. Jews here, that will be obvious from reading the text and we don't need to prejudge it. First question: why was Watt sourced to Vaglieri? I had just moved that section over from the previous version. Can someone fix that?</dd>
<dd>As for Kinana al-Rabi, I agree that there is oversectioning here, and in reverse. He killed al Rabi, then took his wife. The version you've given is, first, cited only to Sealed Nectar, a source which must be "treated with caution," per <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>. So let's make sure we're doing that. Second - and this is one thing what I'd objected to before - it clearly makes al-Rabi sound like the bad guy here, which isn't quite fair to a fellow who was tortured and beheaded. Let's see if we can find a way to present topical material without arguing either side, and let the facts speak for themselves.</dd>
<dd>I also would like to make sure that we give everyone time to weigh in. Would that be alright? I've also solicited FayssalF's involvement here.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:FayssalF&amp;diff=107263647&amp;oldid=106954568" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:FayssalF&amp;diff=107263647&amp;oldid=106954568" rel="nofollow">[9]</a><a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProabivouac_6a4d.html" title="User:Proabivouac">Proabivouac</a> 06:41, 11 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>1. Good we agree about the title. Then perhaps we should put both Vaglieri and Watt there. We can leave "Khaybar in the seventh century" for geographical facts. The reason Watt is sourced to Vaglieri, is that <i>Vaglieri him/herself presents many different views</i>. One of the views that Vaglieri finds credible is Watt's (he/she dismisses another view).</dd>
<dd>2. Note that you removed my references from <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shibli_Nomani_6600.html" title="Shibli Nomani">Shibli Nomani</a> and other sources. We will eventually have to put them in.</dd>
<dd>3. About al-Rabi let's wirte up something below. Everything is sourced to ibn Hisham except "breaching the agreements with Muslims" which is sourced to Muarakpuri. He states that al-Rabi was bound by agreements to not hide anything from the Muslims.</dd>
<dd>4. About the negotiations, I think my version was perfectly netural.</dd>
<dd>From now on let's contniue our discussion on this numerical basis.<a href="../../../b/l/e/User%7EBless_sins_31e5.html" title="User:Bless sins">Bless sins</a> 16:12, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>According to <a href="../../../i/b/n/Ibn_Hisham_f7c9.html" title="Ibn Hisham">ibn Hisham</a>, Kinana ibn al-Rabi was inquired about the treasure surrendered to Muslims as part of the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Khaybar_e1e4.html#Negotiations" title="Battle of Khaybar">negotiations</a>.

<dl>
<dd>Guillaume's translation of the relevant passage is as follows: "Kinana al-Rabi, who had the custody of the treasure of Banu Nadir, was brought to the apostle who asked him about it. He denied that he knew where it was. A Jew came (Tabari says "was brought"), to the apostle and said that he had seen Kinana going round a certain ruin every morning early. When the apostle said to Kinana, "Do you know that if we find you have it I shall kill you?" He said "Yes". The apostle gave orders that the ruin was to be excavated and some of the treasure was found. When he asked him about the rest he refused to produce it, so the apostle gave orders to al-Zubayr Al-Awwam, "Torture him until you extract what he has." So he kindled a fire with flint and steel on his chest until he was nearly dead. Then the apostle delivered him to Muhammad b. Maslama and he struck off his head, in revenge for his brother Mahmud."</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>To begin with, we can remove the portion cited to Mubarakpuri.<a href="http://www.witness-pioneer.org/vil/Books/SM_tsn/ch6s2.html#The%20Conquest%20of%20Khaibar" class="external text" title="http://www.witness-pioneer.org/vil/Books/SM_tsn/ch6s2.html#The%20Conquest%20of%20Khaibar" rel="nofollow">Here</a> is the section of Sealed Nectar which discusses these events. The description of the death of Kinana doesn't give any source (I can only presume because it would help readers find the original passage) and is so sanitized as to constitute disinformation. Clearly, Mubarakpuri is very uncomfortable with the event, and appears to have invented a justification for it not found in Ibn Hisham.</li>
<li>He was warned he would be killed if the treasure was found <i>after</i> the informant told them about the ruin. There's no indication that at any point he was given the choice of disclosing its location or being excecuted; his only choice was whether to be tortured or not at a point when his excecution had already been decided.</li>
<li>You've omitted the fact that Zubayr didn't act on his own initiative; Muhammad had ordered Zubayr to "Torture him until you extract what he has."</li>
<li>Zubayr didn't just "burn his chest," he kindled a fire upon it until Kinana was nearly dead.</li>
<li>You've omitted the fact that Muhammad handed Kinana over to Muhammad bin Maslama.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Now consider the current version: "According to ibn Ishaq, Muhammad's followers tortured al-Rabi, demanding to reveal the location of the hidden treasures of his tribe, and then beheaded him." This, too, makes it sound like Muhammad's followers did it of their own accord. Not so.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I would propose this:
<dl>
<dd>According to Ibn Ishaq, when Muhammad asked him to locate the tribesâ€™ treasure, al-Rabi denied knowing where it was. A Jew told Muhammad that he had seen Al-Rabi near a certain ruin every morning. When the ruin was excavated, it was found to contain some of the treasure. Muhammad ordered <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Zubayr_74c4.html" title="Al-Zubayr">Al-Zubayr</a> to torture al-Rabi until he revealed the location of the rest, then handed him to <a href="../../../m/u/h/Muhammad_ibn_Maslamah_719b.html" title="Muhammad ibn Maslamah">Muhammad ibn Maslamah</a>, whose brother had died in the battle, to be beheaded.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>For obvious reasons, this has been a difficult passage to write. I have done my best to summarize it neutrally and dispassionately. Al-Rabi lied to Muhammad and was caught, which neutrality requires us to mention, but wasn't mentioned before. At the same time, Muhammad's central role wasn't mentioned. Please note that al-Rabi hadn't done anything to Mahmud ibn Maslamah, who, according to the same source, was the first to fall in battle when a millstone was thrown at him from the fort of Na'im.<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProabivouac_6a4d.html" title="User:Proabivouac">Proabivouac</a> 07:14, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Another suggestion (mostly a paraphrase of the above):</p>
<dl>
<dd>According to Ibn Ishaq, when Muhammad asked Kinana al-Rabi to locate the treasure of the Banu Nadir, al-Rabi denied knowing where it was. A Jew told the leader of Muslims that he had seen al-Rabi near a certain ruin every morning. When the ruin was excavated, it was found to contain some of the treasure. Muhammad ordered <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Zubayr_74c4.html" title="Al-Zubayr">al-Zubayr</a> to torture Kinana until he revealed the location of the rest. Al-Zubayr struck fire into al-Rabi's chest so that the latter was nearly dead. Muhammad then handed Kinana to <a href="../../../m/u/h/Muhammad_ibn_Maslamah_719b.html" title="Muhammad ibn Maslamah">Muhammad ibn Maslamah</a>, who beheaded the treasurer of the Nadir.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The suggested version contains not only Muhammad's orders, but also their result: Muhammad ordered al-Zubayr to torture Kinana and Zubayr did so. <a href="../../../b/e/i/User%7EBeit_Or_17e0.html" title="User:Beit Or">Beit</a> <a href="../../../b/e/i/User_talk%7EBeit_Or_8e68.html" title="User talk:Beit Or">Or</a> 08:42, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Does anybody know the scholarly view on this? Putting aside Muslim sources, the academic sources rarely talk about this. EoI article on Kinana doesn't even mention this incident. --<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminz_b269.html" title="User:Aminz">Aminz</a> 09:01, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Both Beit Or's and Proabivouac's versions have two problems. Firstly, neither of you take into account that Muhammad said to the man&#160;:"<i>"Do you know that if we find you have it I shall kill you?" He said "Yes".</i>" Clearly Muhammad warned the man of the penalty he was about to face. This was done on a suspicion of an informant, but before the evidence (treasure) was found.</dd>
<dd>Secondly, <a href="../../../m/u/h/Muhammad_bin_Maslama_b073.html" title="Muhammad bin Maslama">Muhammad bin Maslama</a> beheaded al-Rabi <i>in revenge for killing his brother Mahmud</i>. Neitehr of you say that.</dd>
<dd>Thirdly, al-Mubarakpuri maintains that the concealment of the truth (in other words lying), was forbidden by the treaty. Mubarakpuri is a valid source.</dd>
</dl>
<p>This is what I propose (a compromise version that includes everything):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>According to <a href="../../../i/b/n/Ibn_Hisham_f7c9.html" title="Ibn Hisham">Ibn Hisham</a>, Muhammad inquired Kinana al-Rabi, about the treasure of Banu Nadir. Mubarakpuri states that al-Rabi was bound by agreements between Khaybar and Muhammad to reveal the location of the treasure.[ref] A Jew told Muhammad that he had seen al-Rabi, who had custody of the treasure, go round a certain ruin the every morning. Muhammad asked al-Rabi if he knew that he would be executed if the treaure was found, to which the latter said "yes". When the site was excavated, some of the treaure was found. <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Zubayr_74c4.html" title="Al-Zubayr">Al-Zubayr</a> then, on Muhammad's orders, kindled a fire with flint and steel on al-Rabi's chest, until the latter was nearly dead. Al-Rabi was given to <a href="../../../m/u/h/Muhammad_bin_Maslama_b073.html" title="Muhammad bin Maslama">Muhammad bin Maslama</a> who beheaded him in revenge for killing his brother Mahmud.</p>
</blockquote>
<dl>
<dd>Once again the advantage of this version is that it includes everything.<a href="../../../b/l/e/User%7EBless_sins_31e5.html" title="User:Bless sins">Bless sins</a> 14:38, 12 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Including everything can't be our goal, or the article will become extremely long. In particular, "Muhammad asked al-Rabi if he knew that he would be executed if the treaure was found, to which the latter said "yes"." per my earlier comments, adds nothing. His chance to spare his life by leading them to the treasure had already passsed; all it does is confirm that, by this time, he knew his execution was imminent if the excavation was successful. I really don't see what is gained by specifying the details of his torture, although as I'm not in the business of suprressing information, I suppose we can if ou both think it important. However, Muhammad isn't said to have ordered Al-Zubayr to start a fire on his chest per se, but to torture him until he reveals the rest of the treasure. It's not presented as a punishment, but as an incentive (as he's already going to be executed anyhow.) As for revenge, please take note of my earlier comments. "Al-Rabi was given" should be active, "[Muhammad] handed him." It is an important detail that Mahmud died in battle (the first to fall, according to the narrative), and that implicitly, Muhammad is throwing ibn Maslama a bone by allowing him the honor of the act. However, the narrative makes it clear that Al-Rabi is executed for anything he'd done to ibn Malama, but as punishment having lied about the treasure. The "revenge" wording obscures both of these points. I believe my version is the shortest and most informative of the three proposals.<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProabivouac_6a4d.html" title="User:Proabivouac">Proabivouac</a> 02:20, 13 February 2007 (UTC)

<dl>
<dd>He didn't say, "If you don't tell us where it is, we'll kill you," but "if we find it [there];" they'd already been told where it was by the Jewish informant. Finding it there would show (as it did) that Kinana had lied to Muhammad. What would be the point of offering to spare his life for telling them what they now already know - a chance that wasn't given later when there was actually more treasure to be located? If there is a sort of second chance being offered here, it is too ambiguous for us to summarize it with any degree of confidence.<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProabivouac_6a4d.html" title="User:Proabivouac">Proabivouac</a> 03:26, 13 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>It is not clear to me that Kinana's chance was already exhausted. We don't know what would have happened if he had confessed that he had lied. If the story is true, it at least proved to Muhammad that he is a liar and doesn't admit it even until the last minute.

<dd>Perhaps he was given another chance, but there's nothing in the text to suggest that.

<dd>Bless sin's comment explains why we should include:"<i>"Do you know that if we find you have it I shall kill you?" He said "Yes".</i>" What this could have been meant? We don't know. It requires a secondary source to explain it. But it does add something to the article. Other points of Bless sin's should be also discussed. I need to go now.

<dd>Well, this section is becoming longer and longer, and thus more prominent. I believe that itself may violates undue weight - we are talking one passage in Ibn Ishaq here. Lingering over either Al-Rabi's perfidy or suffering is undue weight in either direction. If we're to include every possible nuance of the passage in both directions, we may as well blockquote the whole thing, but I think that'd be a real disservice to the reader and the encyclopedia. Let's just state this briefly and factually (i.e., only what is necessary to gain a bare understanding of the situation) and be done with it. This isn't <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kinana_ibn_al-Rabi_57ab.html" title="Kinana ibn al-Rabi">Kinana ibn al-Rabi</a>, where a blockquote would be appropriate.<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProabivouac_6a4d.html" title="User:Proabivouac">Proabivouac</a> 08:57, 13 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I don't see any good argument for the inclusion of these two sentences. They only repeat that Muhammad attempted to extort the treasure threatening Kinana with death. This is, however, already clear from the rest of the passage. <a href="../../../b/e/i/User%7EBeit_Or_17e0.html" title="User:Beit Or">Beit</a> <a href="../../../b/e/i/User_talk%7EBeit_Or_8e68.html" title="User talk:Beit Or">Or</a> 08:59, 13 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>That is actually not clear to me, either. Rather, Muhammad is merely informing him that he will be executed if the treasure is found in the ruin. There isn't any point at which Muhammad states, "tell us where it is, or I'll kill you." Of course I agree with you that this sentence is uninformative. It's as if he asked, "do you know who I am?" and Kinana replied "yes;" just dialogue between events.<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProabivouac_6a4d.html" title="User:Proabivouac">Proabivouac</a> 09:06, 13 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Of course you have to be careful with any assessments in primary sources and provide some background info about the source, but that is the common problem with ALL primary sources. You can provide some commonly agreed points (by modern scholars) about how the primary sources presents events, so the reader understands what is an opinion and what is an event. Come on, have you guys never read the intro of a scholar who works with primary sources?

<p>Bless sins, you asked me on my user talk what was wrong with your version of the Kinana passage, so per your request, I'll reiterate my objections:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"According to <a href="../../../i/b/n/Ibn_Hisham_f7c9.html" title="Ibn Hisham">Ibn Hisham</a>, Muhammad inquired Kinana al-Rabi, about the treasure of Banu Nadir. Mubarakpuri states that al-Rabi was bound by agreements between Khaybar and Muhammad to reveal the location of the treasure.[ref] A Jew told Muhammad that he had seen al-Rabi, who had custody of the treasure, go round a certain ruin the every morning. Muhammad asked al-Rabi if he knew that he would be executed if the treaure was found, to which the latter said "yes". When the site was excavated, some of the treaure was found. <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Zubayr_74c4.html" title="Al-Zubayr">Al-Zubayr</a> then, on Muhammad's orders, kindled a fire with flint and steel on al-Rabi's chest, until the latter was nearly dead. Al-Rabi was given to <a href="../../../m/u/h/Muhammad_bin_Maslama_b073.html" title="Muhammad bin Maslama">Muhammad bin Maslama</a> who beheaded him in revenge for killing his brother Mahmud."</dd>
</dl>
<p>Putting aside the unacceptable awkwardness of some of the text (e.g. "Muhammad inquired Kinana al-Rabi, about the treasure of Banu Nadir."):</p>
<ul>
<li>Mubarakpuri is a religious/partisan source, and does not substantiate his claim here (so far as we can tell, he made it up, as Ibn Ishaq mentions no such agreement.)</li>
<li>You've eliminated the explicitly-stated purpose of torturing Al-Rabi - to compel him to reveal the location of the rest of the treasure - while falsely stating that Muhammad ordered the specific manner of torture, making it sound (especially in conjunction with the irrelevant dialogue) that it was intended as a punishment.</li>
<li>Who handed Al-Rabi to Muhammad bin Maslama? We know this, so why choose a passive voice?</li>
<li>Youâ€™ve eliminated the detail that Mahmud was killed in the battle, in favor of wording that quite falsely states Al-Rabi to have killed Mahmud. Ibn Ishaq only says "in revenge for his brother Mahmud," while elsewhere it's stated that Mahmud died when a stone was thrown upon him during the siege.</li>
</ul>
<p>Per <a href="../../../b/a/n/Talk%7EBanu_Qurayza_3414.html" title="Talk:Banu Qurayza">Talk:Banu Qurayza</a>, let's not turn this discussion into another perpetual runaround. All of these points had already been amply explained above.<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProabivouac_6a4d.html" title="User:Proabivouac">Proabivouac</a> 20:23, 15 February 2007 (UTC) 1. About Mubarakpuri. He is a reasearcher at the Unviersity of Madina, has excellent background in Islam, and is infact a scholar on Islam. He is neither an ayotallah, nor the a Grand <a href="../../../m/u/f/Mufti.html" title="Mufti">mufti</a>.</p>
<p>2. Ok, sure we can put that in.</p>
<p>3. I doubt Muhammad personally handed him to Masalma, but was probably handed on his orders. But if you want we can put excatly what ibn hisham says about that.</p>
<p>4. Then we can put "in revenge for his brother Mahmud", instead of "in revenge for killing his brother Mahmud".</p>

<dd>Why do you want to eliminate the detail that Mahmud was killed in battle, presumably by someone other than Al-Rabi?</dd>
<dd>As for Mubarakpuri, you are no doubt aware that I and others have addressed this at some length elsewhere.

<dd>":I want o put what Ibn Hisham says, "in revenge for his brother Mahmud". - it seems you prefer the exact words of the translation here precisely because they are easily misinterpreted - indeed, they must have been, for you very recently falsely stated that Al-Rabi had killed Mahmud himself. Are we trying to mislead our readers to the same false conclusion? In more standard usage we would say that he felt himself (or Ibn Ishaq after the fact felt him) to be <i>avenging</i> his brother, but this is a minor point unworthy of belaboring; it's already summed up in a perfectly neutral manner by observing in this passage that his Mahmud had died in the battle. Perhaps we can change "died" to "was killed?"<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProabivouac_6a4d.html" title="User:Proabivouac">Proabivouac</a> 21:43, 15 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Might I remind you that we are not stating the events as fact, rather in a "According to ibn Hisham..." manner. Thus, we need to represent ibn Hisham as accurately as possible.

<dd>Like you said the wikipedia is not a paper encyclopedia. Thus there is no reason to exclude some details while include others. Infact that is highly POV.

<dd>Bless sins for the <i>fifth time</i>, Ibn Ishaq does <i>not</i> say that Al-Rabi killed Mahmud. In fact, it is Marhab who is said to have killed him by throwing a millstone upon him during the siege of Na'im, and ibn Ishaq shows Muhammad b. Maslama accepting Marhabâ€™s challenge to single combat in order to avenge his brother! I donâ€™t know what to make of the fact that you keep tying to add this falsehood.<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProabivouac_6a4d.html" title="User:Proabivouac">Proabivouac</a> 21:28, 17 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Calm down, and keep it cool with heavy words (e.g. "falsehood"). I've changed it to what Ibn Hisham really says " Muhammad b. Maslama and he struck off his head, in revenge for his brother Mahmud". Was this the only problem you have with the passage?<a href="../../../b/l/e/User%7EBless_sins_31e5.html" title="User:Bless sins">Bless sins</a> 21:55, 17 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I've already outlined my objections to Mubarakpuri, both generally and regarding to this passage, and to the banter about him saying "yes." If you wish to merely state that Muhammad told him he would be killed if it were found, that would be fine, but strikes me as a little too interpretive and unnecessary - it is already obvious from the shorter version why he is killed. At the same time, we aren't out to confuse people; if the significance of something isn't clear, we should leave it out for the sake of clarity and brevity. Similarly, for the "revenge" language - all Ibn Ishaq is saying, as is clear if you read the whole thing, is that b. Maslama was still upset over the death of his brother in battle at the hands of Marhab. Your version appears to contradict itself - Muhammad threatens to excecute him for lying about the treasure, but when he's finally beheaded, it's not for this, but to avenge Mahmud. The record of this talk page shows that <i>you yourself</i> were misled by the wording of this passage; why would we would want to likewise confuse the reader?<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProabivouac_6a4d.html" title="User:Proabivouac">Proabivouac</a> 22:07, 17 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I don't think you objections towards Mubarakpuri are valid, he is a legitimate scholar.</dd>
<dd>"<i>Muhammad told him he...</i>", Muhammad asked him, as is clear from the question mark. Also, al-Rabi responded to Muhammad's question. I never said "yes" in my final version but replaced it with "responded in positive".</dd>
<dd>Finally we are not trying to deliver a message about what happened, but rather what ibn Hisam says what happened.</dd>
<dd>Since it is unlikely that we might reach a compromise, I suggest we quote ibn Hisham verbatim and put that in quotes. This way no one, except ibn Hisham himself, is to be blamed for any "confus[ion]". None of our POVs will be included in that. <a href="../../../b/l/e/User%7EBless_sins_31e5.html" title="User:Bless sins">Bless sins</a> 22:39, 17 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>We're not obliged to duplicate his phrasing, only to represent its substance. If there is something potentially confusing about the language, we're obliged to restate it in a clearer form (that's true of all paraphrases.) The fact that the "revenge" wording is misleading is evidenced by the fact that <i>you yourself</i> had it wrong until just now. So I ask again, <i>why would you want the reader to be similarly misled?</i> We're citing a source, not just a single paragraph. It is completely appropriate to be informed by the fact that it's already mentioned who killed Mahmud, and in fact b. Maslama had already taken revenge against Marhab. Apparently, he was still pretty upset about the whole thing, so Muhammad let him blow off steam by delivering the death blow to Al-Rabi. As you observe, Muhammad told Al-Rabi he would be excecuted if the treasure were found in the ruins; it was, so he was. Nothing to do with Mahmud at all.<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProabivouac_6a4d.html" title="User:Proabivouac">Proabivouac</a> 02:32, 18 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Again it is not our place to question the truthfullness of ibn Hisham, since wikipedia is based on verifiability, not truth. If something a scholarly source says does not make sense, then it is the fault of that source, not ours. I know you are not obliged to duplicate the langauge. But you have two options,</dd>

<dd>Bless sins, it's not the truthfulness that's at issue here: it's not obviously <i>inaccurate</i> to say that b.

<dd>I did answer. Please read my comments above. It is not misleading to say that ibn Hisham says XYZ. That is perfectly, and 100% accurate.

Its interesting that in your paraphrase you included some statements of ibn Hisham that are not even in the passage concerned, yet you continously neglect other parts, such as Muhammad's dialogue with al-Rabi.<a href="../../../b/l/e/User%7EBless_sins_31e5.html" title="User:Bless sins">Bless sins</a> 20:53, 18 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>There is nothing at all unusual about representing a passage in light of earlier portions of the same narrative from the same source. Most readers will intuit that the only reason we include the fact that b. Maslama's brother had died in the battle in this passage is to throw light on b. Maslama's personal motive, which is exactly what Ibn Ishaq is doing. We aim to summarize the most salient information in the fewest number of words; nothing unusual about that, either.<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProabivouac_6a4d.html" title="User:Proabivouac">Proabivouac</a> 21:06, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As I said, please read Watt before accusing other editors of misrepresentation: "<i>Perhaps it was on the way back from the pilgrimage manquÃ© that the idea occurred to Muhammad of attacking the rich Jewish oasis of Khaybar. The Muslims were disappointed at the apparent fruitlessness of their expedition to al-Hudaybiyah, and it was only natural for an Arab like Muhammad to feel that virtue should not be allowed to go unrewarded. So when he set out for Khaybar some six weeks after his return from Mecca, he allowed only those who had made the Pledge under the Tree to accompany him.</i>" (<i>Prophet and Statesman</i>, pp. 188-189) <a href="../../../b/e/i/User%7EBeit_Or_17e0.html" title="User:Beit Or">Beit</a> <a href="../../../b/e/i/User_talk%7EBeit_Or_8e68.html" title="User talk:Beit Or">Or</a> 11:50, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Separate opinions of contemporary scholars and the narrative a bit. They all have just one primary source, the Qu'ran, or is there anything I'm not aware of? My suggestion is to base the narrative of events on this primary source. Where necessary we can comment the events by 'Foo says that', 'many Foo interpret/see it as', 'from this the Foo group of Islamic belief derieved a law based on Foo's fatwa'. It would however greatly benefit if we split the article in a narrative of events (with small comments), a section or several subsections with the interpretation of events by modern scholars(See <a href="../../../p/e/r/Pericles.html" title="Pericles">Pericles</a>), and a chapter where we discuss the different religious interpretations of this event. <a href="../../../w/a/n/User%7EWandalstouring_ea93.html" title="User:Wandalstouring">Wandalstouring</a> 12:29, 12 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, this is the approach I find most logical.

<dd>Certainly Ibn Ishaq is a primary source, but there are others too. Aside from some of the medieval biographies, there are the <a href="../../../h/a/d/Hadith.html" title="Hadith">hadith</a> collections (but they are discontinuous).

<dd>I wouldn't advise this step if you have many scholars. If you have a few authoritative works or something that must be quoted word for word, than use some kind of blockquote.

<dd>Considerations of appropriate weight and conciseness also apply. Anyway, quotes must never be so long and numerous as to overwhelm the article (unless the article is written in the form of a scholarly debate). For this reason, I usually prefer brief paraphrases.

<dd>EoI says:<i>"Montgomery Watt has drawn attention to the fact that the Banu 'l-Nadir, driven out of Medina, had taken refuge in khaybar and that their chieftains and the chieftains of other Jewish groups, eager for revenge, were intriguing against Muhammad along with the Arabs tribes of the neighbourhood. So Muhammad had not only a just motive for attacking them, but there was also the positive necessity to destroy these enemies, more formidable even than the Quraysh because of their adherence to their own religion, their intelligence and their superior culture."</i></dd>
<dd>So, the contemporary scholars say that Muhammad attacked exactly money. There are two types of misrepresentation of a text: censoring some part of the text, or distorting the part mentioned. It also seems that Beit Or has asked all contemporary scholars about their views. --<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminz_b269.html" title="User:Aminz">Aminz</a> 23:31, 12 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Ideally, we wouldn't be citing him second-hand, anyhow. I think what is needed is to follow up to the cited Watt portion. It does seem probable to me that Muhammad would have found the presence of the Banu Nadir objectionable, as he did in Medina, and it would hardly be surprising, after all that had occurred, that they'd be "intruguing" (a.k.a. diplomacy) against him. Who wouldn't be? But we should take care that our wording isn't prejudicial, and that we're focussing on substantial points. I can't see any part of the sentence "So Muhammad had not only a just motive...superior culture" which would be necessary here.</dd>
<dd>Actions often reflect several motives, and I don't see how wishing to pursue the Banu Nadir contradicts the desire to raise his prestige among his followers. Judging only from the material which has been presented here, Watt doesn't either.<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProabivouac_6a4d.html" title="User:Proabivouac">Proabivouac</a> 02:00, 13 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Exactly. In <i>Prophet and Statesman</i> Watt cites two reasons for the attack, one of them being the necessity to raise his prestige after the Hudaybiyya. As usually, Aminz keeps ignoring this quote from <i>Prophet and Statesman</i>, which doesn't fit his POV. <a href="../../../b/e/i/User%7EBeit_Or_17e0.html" title="User:Beit Or">Beit</a> <a href="../../../b/e/i/User_talk%7EBeit_Or_8e68.html" title="User talk:Beit Or">Or</a> 07:45, 13 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>To include a secondhand characterization of Watt's opinion aside his own would be unnecessary, but to the extent that Veccia Vaglieri "credits" Watt's view, this is worthy of mention in itself.

<dd>Secondly, the argument "<i>Contemporary scholars believe that Muhammad moved to attack Khaybar in order to raise his prestige among his followers</i>", is repeated: "<i>The conquest of Khaybar would enable him to satisfy with ample booty his companions who hoped to capture Mecca and were discontented at the treaty with the Quraysh</i>" and "<i>one reason for Muhammad's decision to attack Khaybar was the need to raise his prestige among his followers, which had been eroded by the <a href="../../../t/r/e/Treaty_of_Hudaybiyya_09f8.html" title="Treaty of Hudaybiyya">Treaty of Hudaybiyya</a></i>". It is interesting that an argument repeated three times, has not been removed, but an argument repeated only twice is constantly being reverted. It looks as if you are applying double standards.</dd>

<p>The sources give support to the view of Montgomery Watt, showing that the Jews, already responsible for the coalition which had laid siege to Medina in 5 A.H. and worried by the growing power of the Prophet, continued to stir up the Arabs against him. Haykal's opinion, however, is to be rejected in that it is inappropriate to consider an event in the light of subsequent developments. In the year 7 A.H. Muá¸¥ammad was not yet a figure to be reckoned with in the estimation of the rulers of the empires to the north of the peninsular. While giving full credit to the opinion of Montgomery Watt, one should not overlook the fact that the Prophet was in great need of arms and money to accomplish his objectives and he</p>

<p>It seems to me - correct me if I'm wrong - that there are two claims here: one that Muhammad sought to raise his prestige among his followers, the other is that he sought booty not just to satisfy the troops, but to support subsequent conquests. Who supports what? If the first is indeed supported by Watt and Lewis as well as Stillman and Vaglieri, then "contemporary scholars" is enough, no need to list all four. This can then be followed by another sentence along the lines, "Others such as Stillman and Vaglieri add..."<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProabivouac_6a4d.html" title="User:Proabivouac">Proabivouac</a> 01:09, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That would be equally true were there a dozen scholars saying this; would you still say we should list them all? It was enough for Aminz, at least, to state that modern scholars believe Muhammad to have been sincere in his belief to be receiving divine revelations. I agree with Beit Or on this point. Where Lewis and Watt are joined by others, and there is no one who's been shown to disagree, it is fair to depict this as a consensus.<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProabivouac_6a4d.html" title="User:Proabivouac">Proabivouac</a> 22:06, 22 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>There is some difference. Watt said: "Modern historians must accept Muhammad's belief in receiving revelation" and Scheimmel said recent studies has shown X. Still, I was okay with word-by-word quoting of the sources directly (i.e. <i>Watt</i> says Modern historians must accept; <i>Scheimmel</i> says recent studies has indicated...) If Watt or Lewis or Stillman or Vaglieri say that "Modern historian must accept that Muhammad attacked for these reasons" or that "recent studies have shown that Muhammad attacked for these reasons" that would be okay with me. --<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminz_b269.html" title="User:Aminz">Aminz</a> 23:18, 22 February 2007 (UTC)

So Muhammad had not only a just motive for attacking them, but there was also the positive necessity to destroy these enemies, more formidable even than the Quraysh because of their adherence to their own religion, their intelligence and their superior culture... While giving full credit to the opinion of Montgomery Watt, one should not overlook the fact that the Prophet was in great need of arms and money to accomplish his objectives and he knew that he could find these among the Jews at khaybar (the sources give precise details of the number and type of arms captured by the Muslims from the Jews at Medina and at khaybar.)."--<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminz_b269.html" title="User:Aminz">Aminz</a> 00:28, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have read those quotes as you must know. It appears that the only view that Vaglieri herself is fully endorsing here is the view that Muhammad did it for arms and money. Regarding the "drawn attention to" thing, it's better to quote Watt than to quote someone's vauge characterization of Watt's view. <a href="../../../a/r/r/User%7EArrow740_2a2c.html" title="User:Arrow740">Arrow740</a> 00:34, 27 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>"While giving full credit to the opinion of Montgomery Watt," so she is not disagreeing with Watt.And I don't have to find from which of Watt's book she has taken this quote.

<dd>Again Vaglieri gives "full credit to the opinion of Montgomery Watt". Itaqallah has also edited the sentence. --<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminz_b269.html" title="User:Aminz">Aminz</a> 00:46, 27 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>"give full credit" means it's worth considering. "Noting the presence" isn't better than "drawn attention to," and the payment idea must be clearly attributed to Watt and not stated as fact. <a href="../../../a/r/r/User%7EArrow740_2a2c.html" title="User:Arrow740">Arrow740</a> 00:48, 27 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>"<i>...what is relevant is his actual opinion...</i>", which is what Vaglieri gives "full credit" to. Watt writes about these subjects in numerous books. it's highly unlikely that Vaglieri, a trained scholar, is mistaken in her characterisation. for our purposes, as it is a reliable source making the characterisation, it is totally acceptable. <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItaqallah_7a9f.html" title="User:Itaqallah"><small><b><font color="#029DDD">ITAQALLAH</font></b></small></a> 00:49, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>The sense I get from the passage is only that she thinks Watt has a point worth considering, as the sources show them to have been responsible for the coalition which attacked in the Battle of the Trench, but thinks this may not have been the primary motive for the attack on Khaybar, or something which literally left him no other choice, only one motive to which she adds another. You are construing the phrase "giving full credit to [his] opinion" more absolutely than is justified.<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProabivouac_6a4d.html" title="User:Proabivouac">Proabivouac</a> 00:51, 27 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>whether or not Vaglieri is fully endorsing Watt's point is irrelevant. what's significant here is her characterisation of Watt's argument, which we should presume to be accurate. <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItaqallah_7a9f.html" title="User:Itaqallah"><small><b><font color="#029DDD">ITAQALLAH</font></b></small></a> 00:54, 27 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Arrow, Watt has written too many books and we don't have to double check Vaglieri. The reviewers of her work have already done that.</dd>
<dd>Proabivouac, The sense I get from the passage is that she agrees that the view of Watt finds support from evidences. And she does not disagree with that. So, saying that she believes Muhammad attacked exclusively for money is incorrect. --<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminz_b269.html" title="User:Aminz">Aminz</a> 00:54, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Yes, she agrees that the presence of the Banu Nadir was a motive, and that they had, in fact, assembled a coalition against him. That is why I supported inclusion of this material. What I don't see is her agreeing that that was the <i>primary</i> reason, or that this left him <i>no choice</i> but to attack.<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProabivouac_6a4d.html" title="User:Proabivouac">Proabivouac</a> 00:59, 27 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Watt believes "but there was also the positive necessity to destroy these enemies", i.e. it was a <i>primary</i> reason. Do you think she agrees with Watt at this point. --<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminz_b269.html" title="User:Aminz">Aminz</a> 01:46, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Vaglieri says "<i>The sources give support to the view of Montgomery Watt</i>". Historians advocate views if and only if the views are based on reasonable sources of history. No scholar would advocate a view strongly and at the same time state that his/her opinion is baseless. Similarly, no scholar would deny a well-sourced opinion based upon history. Thus Vaglieri's statement is equivalent of "Watt's view, as far historians know, is the truth". <a href="../../../b/l/e/User%7EBless_sins_31e5.html" title="User:Bless sins">Bless sins</a> 02:17, 27 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Bless sins, let's look at the whole passage you've just partially quoted:</dd>
<dd>"The sources give support to the view of Montgomery Watt, showing that the Jews, already responsible for the coalition which had laid siege to Medina in 5 A.H. and worried by the growing power of the Prophet, continued to stir up the Arabs against him."</dd>
<dd>As I've stated above, that is exactly what she agrees with.<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProabivouac_6a4d.html" title="User:Proabivouac">Proabivouac</a> 02:22, 27 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Yes correct this <i>is</i> what she agree with. She also, however, agrees with the rest of Watt's opinion. that's why she accords him "full credit".<a href="../../../b/l/e/User%7EBless_sins_31e5.html" title="User:Bless sins">Bless sins</a> 02:35, 27 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>No. For the third time on this page, she is saying that his view is worth considering. <a href="../../../a/r/r/User%7EArrow740_2a2c.html" title="User:Arrow740">Arrow740</a> 02:38, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
