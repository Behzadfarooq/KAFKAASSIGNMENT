<p>The <b>Battle of Sari Bair</b>, also known as the <b>August Offensive</b>, was the final attempt made by the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_of_Great_Britain_and_Ireland_5d03.html" title="United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland">British</a> to seize control of the <a href="../../../g/a/l/Gallipoli.html" title="Gallipoli">Gallipoli</a> peninsula from the <a href="../../../o/t/t/Ottoman_Empire_4168.html" title="Ottoman Empire">Ottoman Empire</a> during <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_I_9429.html" title="World War I">First World War</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Gallipoli_132c.html" title="Battle of Gallipoli">Battle of Gallipoli</a> had raged on two fronts, <a href="../../../a/n/z/Anzac_Cove_149e.html" title="Anzac Cove">Anzac</a> and <a href="../../../l/a/n/Landing_at_Cape_Helles_4155.html" title="Landing at Cape Helles">Helles</a>, for three months since the invasion of <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_25.html" title="April 25">25 April</a> <a href="../../../1/9/1/1915.html" title="1915">1915</a>. With the Anzac landing a tense stalemate, the <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allies_%28World_War_I%29_dc9e.html" title="Allies (World War I)">Allies</a> had attempted to carry the offensive on the Helles battlefield at enormous cost for little gain. In August, the British command proposed a new operation to reinvigorate the campaign by capturing the Sari Bair ridge, the high ground that dominated the middle of the peninsula above the Anzac landing.</p>
<p>The main operation started on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_6.html" title="August 6">6 August</a> with a fresh landing five miles north of Anzac at <a href="../../../s/u/v/Suvla_Bay_e3ed.html" title="Suvla Bay">Suvla Bay</a> in conjunction with the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_and_New_Zealand_Army_Corps_%28army_corps%29_54e3.html" title="Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (army corps)">Australian and New Zealand Army Corps</a> mounting an attack north into the rugged country alongside the Sari Bair range with the aim of capturing the high ground and linking with the Suvla landing. At Helles, the British and <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_Third_Republic_a254.html" title="French Third Republic">French</a> were now to remain largely on the defensive.</p>

<p>To be accurate about the geography, the battle should properly be known as the "Battle of <i>Kocaçimentepe</i>" which was the correct <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkish_language.html" title="Turkish language">Turkish</a> name for the ridge and its highest peak (meaning "Great Grass Mountain"). The peak was known to the British as "Hill 971" and they mistakenly applied the name for a lesser ridge to the main range (<i>Sari Bayir</i>, meaning "Yellow Slope", which ended at the imposing bluff above <a href="../../../a/n/z/Anzac_Cove_149e.html" title="Anzac Cove">Anzac Cove</a> known as "The Sphinx").</p>

<p>The Suvla landing was to be made by the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_IX_Corps_bc8c.html" title="British IX Corps">British IX Corps</a>, under the command of the aged <a href="../../../l/i/e/Lieutenant-General_9c10.html" title="Lieutenant-General">Lieutenant-General</a> <a href="../../../f/r/e/Frederick_Stopford_31c9.html" title="Frederick Stopford">Sir Frederick Stopford</a> who had retired in <a href="../../../1/9/0/1909.html" title="1909">1909</a> and had never commanded men in battle. His appointment was made based solely on seniority but his hesitancy during the preparations for the landing should have warned Hamilton that he was not a fit choice for the command.</p>
<p>The Turks were well aware that a renewal of the offensive was imminent. There had been some doubt about whether the British would abandon the campaign but this was dispelled when <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winston_Churchill_74d2.html" title="Winston Churchill">Winston Churchill</a> made a careless speech in <a href="../../../d/u/n/Dundee.html" title="Dundee">Dundee</a>, stating that the battle would continue, whatever the sacrifices. Consequently the <a href="../../../f/i/f/Fifth_Army_%28Ottoman_Empire%29_003c.html" title="Fifth Army (Ottoman Empire)">Fifth Army</a> underwent a reorganisation resulting in an expansion to 16 <a href="../../../d/i/v/Division_%28military%29.html" title="Division (military)">divisions</a>. Ten of these defended the existing battlefields (six at Helles, which had seen the bulk of the early fighting, and four at Anzac). Three divisions defended the Asian shore of the Dardanelles and three divisions of the Turkish XVI Corps defended the Gulf of Saros north of <a href="../../../b/u/l/Bulair.html" title="Bulair">Bulair</a> at the neck of the peninsula.</p>
<p>The Turks anticipated that the offensive would involve a breakout from Anzac but were unsure whether it would be north (towards Suvla) or south (towards Gaba Tepe). A new British landing was also considered likely but Suvla was not rated highly as a candidate, consequently only a modest force of four battalions defended the area. The Turkish commanders also dismissed the possibility of an assault against the Sari Bair range due to the rugged terrain. Only <a href="../../../m/u/s/Mustafa_Kemal_Atat%C3%BCrk_b631.html" title="Mustafa Kemal Atatürk">Mustafa Kemal</a>, commander of the 19th Division at Anzac, expected the attack against the heights but he was unable to convince his superiors to significantly strengthen the defences — only one <a href="../../../r/e/g/Regiment.html" title="Regiment">regiment</a> was moved to the sector north of ANZAC.</p>

<p>The attack from the Anzac perimeter was directed against two peaks of the Sari Bair range; <a href="../../../c/h/u/Chunuk_Bair_acc9.html" title="Chunuk Bair">Chunuk Bair</a> and Hill 971. Under the overall command of <a href="../../../m/a/j/Major-General_fd05.html" title="Major-General">Major-General</a> <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_Godley_0372.html" title="Alexander Godley">Alexander Godley</a>, the attacking force included the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Zealand_and_Australian_Division_fd10.html" title="New Zealand and Australian Division">New Zealand and Australian Division</a>, the British <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_13th_%28Western%29_Division_711f.html" title="British 13th (Western) Division">13th Division</a> plus a couple of extra infantry <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brigade.html" title="Brigade">brigades</a>.</p>
<p>The plan was for two assaulting columns to march out of Anzac on the night of <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_6.html" title="August 6">6 August</a>. The right-hand column, comprising the New Zealand Infantry Brigade under <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brigadier-General_cd92.html" title="Brigadier-General">Brigadier-General</a> Francis Johnston, would head for Chunuk Bair. The left-hand column, commanded by Major-General Vaughn Cox, heading for Hill 971 and neighbouring Hill Q, contained the Australian 4th Infantry Brigade of Brigadier-General <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Monash_4547.html" title="John Monash">John Monash</a> and Cox's 29th Indian Brigade. Both objectives were expected to be captured by dawn.</p>
<p>To distract the Turks from the impending offensive, on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_6.html" title="August 6">6 August</a>, at 5.30 p.m., an attack was made at <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Lone_Pine_69ac.html" title="Battle of Lone Pine">Lone Pine</a> by the infantry brigades of the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_1st_Division_%28World_War_I%29_0c40.html" title="Australian 1st Division (World War I)">Australian 1st Division</a>. While the attack was ultimately successful in capturing the Turkish trenches, it was counterproductive as a diversion as it attracted reinforcements to the north. Another costly diversion was carried out at Helles which resulted in a pointless struggle over a patch of ground known as <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Krithia_Vineyard_78e1.html" title="Battle of Krithia Vineyard">Krithia Vineyard</a>. As was the case at Lone Pine, the British action at Helles did not restrain the Turks from sending reinforcements north to the Sari Bair range.</p>
<p>The right column heading for Chunuk Bair had a simpler navigation task as their route was to some degree visible from the old Anzac perimeter. In what became known as the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Chunuk_Bair_5af8.html" title="Battle of Chunuk Bair">Battle of Chunuk Bair</a>, the <a href="../../../d/o/m/Dominion_of_New_Zealand_f445.html" title="Dominion of New Zealand">New Zealanders</a> failed to capture the peak by the morning of <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_7.html" title="August 7">7 August</a> but managed the feat on the next morning.</p>
<p>On the morning following the breakout, a number of other attacks were planned within the old Anzac perimeter. The most notorious was the attack of the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_3rd_Light_Horse_Brigade_2a12.html" title="Australian 3rd Light Horse Brigade">Australian 3rd Light Horse Brigade</a> at <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_the_Nek_84db.html" title="Battle of the Nek">The Nek</a> whose slim chance of success had depended on the New Zealanders having captured Chunuk Bair on schedule.</p>
<p>The left column's journey through the tangled ravines was doomed to failure and, having become lost and confused, it never got close to the objective of Hill 971. By the morning of <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_8.html" title="August 8">8 August</a> Cox's forces were sufficiently organised to attempt an attack on their original objectives of Hill 971 and Hill Q. However Monash's brigade was still mistaken about its position relative to Hill 971. In fact, by the end of the day's advance Monash's troops had actually reached the position they had believed they had been starting from. Meanwhile Hill 971 was more unreachable than ever. The three Australian <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battalion.html" title="Battalion">battalions</a> that had made the assault suffered 765 casualties — the 15th Battalion was reduced to about 30% of its normal strength.</p>
<p>Of the force aiming for Hill Q, one battalion of <a href="../../../g/u/r/Gurkha.html" title="Gurkha">Gurkhas</a> commanded by <a href="../../../m/a/j/Major.html" title="Major">Major</a> Cecil Allanson and joined by disparate New Army men, moved to within 200 feet of Hill Q by 6 p.m. on 8 August where they sought shelter from the heavy Turkish fire. After a <a href="../../../n/a/v/Naval_artillery.html" title="Naval artillery">naval artillery</a> bombardment, the battalion attacked the summit shortly after 5 a.m. on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_9.html" title="August 9">9 August</a>. The plan of the attack, as concocted by General Godley, had involved numerous other battalions but all were lost or pinned down so the Gurkhas went on alone. They succeeded in driving the Turks off the hill but were then caught in further naval gunfire from friendly <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monitor_warship_type.html" title="Monitor warship type">monitors</a> or from an <a href="../../../a/r/t/Artillery_battery.html" title="Artillery battery">artillery battery</a> at Anzac. Having suffered heavy casualties and with no reinforcements, Allanson's force was pushed back off the hill shortly afterwards.</p>
<p>By the end of 9 August the Allies retained only a foothold on Chunuk Bair. On <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_10.html" title="August 10">10 August</a> the Turks, led from the front by Colonel Mustafa Kemal, counter-attacked and regained control of the entire Sari Bair ridge.</p>

<p><i>Main article:</i> <a href="../../../l/a/n/Landing_at_Suvla_Bay_7c25.html" title="Landing at Suvla Bay">Landing at Suvla Bay</a> Stopford's IX Corps comprised the British <a href="../../../1/0/t/10th_Division_%28British%29_0c6f.html" title="10th Division (British)">10th(Irish)</a> and <a href="../../../1/1/t/11th_Division_%28British%29_d58c.html" title="11th Division (British)">11th Divisions</a>. At the time of the landing on August 6 the British were confronted by three Turkish battalions under the command of a <a href="../../../b/a/v/Bavaria.html" title="Bavaria">Bavarian</a> <a href="../../../c/a/v/Cavalry.html" title="Cavalry">cavalry</a> officer, <a href="../../../m/a/j/Major.html" title="Major">Major</a> Wilhelm Willmer whose task was to delay the British until reinforcements could arrive from Bulair, 30 miles away.</p>
<p>The 11th Division landed on the night of 6 August and two brigades of the 10th Division landed the following morning. The original objectives were the capture of the ridge lines to the north (Kiretch Tepe) and east (Tekke Tepe) and the line of hills to the south on the Anafarta Spur. However, Stopford's timorous nature and Hamilton's failure to exert his will on his subordinate commanders meant the objectives were diluted to little more than securing the beach.</p>
<p>The landings, made in the dark without the aid of reliable <a href="../../../r/e/c/Reconnaissance.html" title="Reconnaissance">reconnaissance</a>, suffered from the same confusion that reigned at <a href="../../../l/a/n/Landing_at_Anzac_Cove_76ef.html" title="Landing at Anzac Cove">Anzac landing</a> on <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_25.html" title="April 25">25 April</a>. Lighters ran aground on sandbars so that the troops had to wade some distance to get ashore. Many units became intermingled and officers were unable to locate their objectives. Lala Baba was captured by the 6th Battalion of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Green_Howards_ec7f.html" title="The Green Howards">The Yorkshire Regiment</a> in what was the first combat action by any unit of <a href="../../../h/o/r/Horatio_Kitchener%2C_1st_Earl_Kitchener_of_Khartoum_a4bf.html" title="Horatio Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener of Khartoum">Lord Kitchener</a>'s <a href="../../../k/i/t/Kitchener%27s_Army_f5f3.html" title="Kitchener's Army">New Army</a>.</p>
<p>By evening on 7 August progress had been minimal. To the south east Chocolate Hill and Green Hill were taken in the evening with minimal resistance but constant harassment by <a href="../../../s/h/r/Shrapnel.html" title="Shrapnel">shrapnel</a> and <a href="../../../s/n/i/Sniper.html" title="Sniper">sniper</a> fire. The British suffered 1,700 casualties on the first day at Suvla.</p>
<p>Stopford's first serious attempt at the ridges of the Anafarta Hills to the east was made on the night of 8 August, following intervention from Hamilton, but on the morning of 9 August the Turkish reinforcements had begun to arrive and the British were driven back. he fighting concentrated around <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scimitar_Hill_c3b4.html" title="Scimitar Hill">Scimitar Hill</a> which protruded northwards from the Anafarta Spur and dominated the southern approach to the Tekke Tepe ridge. Scimitar Hill had been captured then abandoned on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_8.html" title="August 8">8 August</a>; attempts to retake the hill on 9 and 10 August were thwarted by the Turks. The gunfire was so intense it set the undergrowth ablaze and many of the wounded were incinerated where they lay.</p>
<p>As the fighting developed, the landing was reinforced by the arrival of the British <a href="../../../5/3/r/53rd_Division_%28British%29_bd5d.html" title="53rd Division (British)">53rd Division</a> on 9 August followed by the <a href="../../../5/4/t/54th_Division_%28British%29_3607.html" title="54th Division (British)">54th Division</a> on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_10.html" title="August 10">10 August</a>. Stopford now had four divisions under his corps command but was faced by a similar strength of Turkish defenders. The 53rd Division was mauled in another attack on Scimitar Hill on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_10.html" title="August 10">10 August</a>.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_15.html" title="August 15">15 August</a> Hamilton finally sacked Stopford and a number of division and brigade commanders. The command of IX Corps was given to Major-General Beauvoir de Lisle, commander of the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_29th_Division_7e93.html" title="British 29th Division">29th Division</a> until Lieutenant-General <a href="../../../j/u/l/Julian_H.G._Byng%2C_1st_Viscount_Byng_of_Vimy_a868.html" title="Julian H.G. Byng, 1st Viscount Byng of Vimy">Julian Byng</a> could travel from France to assume command.</p>

<p><i>Main articles:</i> <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Scimitar_Hill_dc9d.html" title="Battle of Scimitar Hill">Battle of Scimitar Hill</a> — <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Hill_60_%28Gallipoli%29_1078.html" title="Battle of Hill 60 (Gallipoli)">Battle of Hill 60</a> As the shape of the new front line firmed, General Hamilton planned one further attack to try to link the Suvla landing to Anzac. This required the capture of a group of hills; Scimitar Hill and the 'W' Hills from Suvla and Hill 60 from the new Anzac sector. The attacks were to commence on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_21.html" title="August 21">21 August</a>. At Suvla, de Lisle had his 29th Division and the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_2nd_Mounted_Division_0d38.html" title="British 2nd Mounted Division">2nd Mounted Division</a> which had been moved to Suvla as additional reinforcements.</p>
<p>The 29th Division was to attack <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Scimitar_Hill_dc9d.html" title="Battle of Scimitar Hill">Scimitar Hill</a> while the 11th Division was to take the W Hills on the south of the Anafarta Spur. The 2nd Mounted Division was in reserve near Lala Baba on the far side of the salt lake. This attack was the largest mounted by the Allies at Gallipoli. Scimitar Hill was captured briefly but the attackers were driven off or killed by the defensive fire from the Turks higher up the spur. Once again the undergrowth ignited, burning many of the wounded. The 2nd Mounted Division were called to join the attack and in a feat of the sort of glorious folly for which the British <a href="../../../g/e/n/Gentleman.html" title="Gentleman">gentleman</a> soldier is renowned, they advanced, marching in extended formation, straight across the salt lake, under fire the whole way. For a second time the hill was captured, briefly, before being lost for the final time. The attack of the 11th Division towards the W Hills was held up by strong Turkish defences.</p>
<p>In the Anzac sector, Hill 60 had been unoccupied on the morning of 7 August when <a href="../../../m/i/l/Military_history_of_Australia_during_World_War_I_42da.html" title="Military history of Australia during World War I">Australian</a> scouts passed across it however the Turks swiftly occupied and fortified it. The <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Hill_60_%28Gallipoli%29_1078.html" title="Battle of Hill 60 (Gallipoli)">Battle of Hill 60</a> lasted for eight days and while the summit of the hill was eventually reached, the Allies were unable to completely dislodge the Turkish defenders.</p>
