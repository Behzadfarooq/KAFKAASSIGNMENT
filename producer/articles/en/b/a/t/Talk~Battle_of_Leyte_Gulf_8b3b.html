<p>So, uh, let's discuss the image instead of instantly reverting? We really need the caption, otherwise the reader just sees a smoke cloud, not exactly informative in the encyclopedic way. The thumb is one way (and has the advantage that it also indicates that the picture can get larger), or we could have a line break and then the caption. But to omit captioning entirely is not the right way to go. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStan_Shebs_9ea8.html" title="User:Stan Shebs">Stan</a> 04:03, 6 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's not ommitted -- it appears when you hoover the mouse over the picture. And the reason I changed it is because this (as the article stands now) is the standard battlebox format (you can find the whole writeup at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Battles_64fd.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Battles">Wikipedia:WikiProject Battles</a>). <a href="../../../r/a/u/User%7ERaul654_54a3.html" title="User:Raul654">→Raul654</a> 04:06, Aug 6, 2004 (UTC)

<dd>Hmm, I see at least one other person who objected to the lack of captions in the template, but no response to that point. Hovering is going to look pretty funny for a multi-line caption!

<dd>There was never any final agreement on rules for images in the battlebox. They obviously look better un-thumbnailed and captionless so probably only self-explanatory images should go in the battlebox. There's certainly no rule saying if an article only has one image, that has to go in the battlebox. <a href="../../../g/s/l/User%7EGsl_d00e.html" title="User:Gsl">Geoff/Gsl</a> 05:21, 6 Aug 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, I changed your captions. (1) A WikiProject doesn't represent policy. (2) Noun phrase captions are just as good, and are often shorter and snappier than full sentence captions. They are used widely in professional publishing. (3) You made the noun phrases into sentences by introducing obvious and redundant verbiage like "This chart shows..." or "...is shown here..." (4) You introduced a past tense into one caption. I did keep the one about <i>Zuikaku</i> no longer being the flagship of the Japanese fleet. <a href="../../../g/d/r/User%7EGdr_e4cb.html" title="User:Gdr">Gdr</a> 22:58, 2004 Nov 17 (UTC)</dd>

<p>After the initial vandalism, I checked again and it seems there are battles with more ships and possibly more "men" in ancient history. However, there doesn't seem to be much doubt in terms of the area covered and the tonnage. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrant65_6b0f.html" title="User:Grant65">Grant65</a> <a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGrant65_a485.html" title="User talk:Grant65">(Talk)</a> 22:10, Oct 13, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Actium defintely had more ships, and I suspect Salamis did too. But number of men is a bit iffy. <a href="../../../r/a/u/User%7ERaul654_54a3.html" title="User:Raul654">→Raul654</a> 22:15, Oct 13, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I deemed that there would be a need for a page for this issue, so please see <a href="../../../l/a/r/Largest_Naval_Battle_in_History_8b78.html" title="Largest Naval Battle in History">Largest Naval Battle in History</a>. Rather than having an endles rambling about men, ships, aircraft, tonnage, time, and surface area in every article you can now refer directly to that page. At least when I created the page it made no comment asto what actually is the largest battle. My aim was to present facts and allow readers to form their own opinions. I don't think there is a definite answer for this question. <a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChino_6b6b.html" title="User:Chino">Chino</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>Chino, is it you that us repeatedly removing the mention of tonnage and area in the opening sentence? I would like whoever it is to explain why they are doing that. I don't see how there can be any question about Leyte being the largest battle in terms of these.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Also, my last edit included the link to <a href="../../../l/a/r/Largest_naval_battle_in_history.html" title="Largest naval battle in history">Largest naval battle in history</a>.

<p>I have changed the only text once, but I have followed "the battle" with amusement&#160;:-) I actually agree with the person who came up with the idea that Leyte is the second largest naval battle in history, altough his/her claims about the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Aegates_Islands_508c.html" title="Battle of Aegates Islands">Battle of Aegates Islands</a> are clearly wrong. But I also know that such a large portion of Wiki users are American that the truth would invariably disappear&#160;:-) My opinion is that both Leyte and Ecnomus pages should state that the battle _may_ be concidered the largest in history and then have a link to the <a href="../../../l/a/r/Largest_naval_battle_in_history.html" title="Largest naval battle in history">Largest naval battle in history</a>. That page should, in my opinion, provide the facts and let people themselves make up their minds. This is, as I think we all agree, a matter of opinion. To compromise my latest edit of Leyte (which might not survive the next ten minutes) mentions both the "tonnage" and "number of ships" issue. This makes the beginning of the page quite cumbersome... I still prefer "Often regarded as largest" and link to page with info for those who really like to know what "often" means in this context. <a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChino_6b6b.html" title="User:Chino">Chino</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>I'm not happy about Ecnomus being mentioned in the Leyte article. I think the link to "largest naval battle" is enough. That way if people search for "largest naval battle" they will go straight to that page, and not to the Leyte or Ecnomus pages. I doubt that people interested in either Leyte or Ecnomus are very interested in the other battle. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrant65_6b0f.html" title="User:Grant65">Grant65</a> <a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGrant65_a485.html" title="User talk:Grant65">(Talk)</a> 16:05, Oct 18, 2004 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Since there do not seem to be any objections from registered users, can I ask that the direct reference to Ecnomus be removed from the page? (How strange would it look if Leyte was mentioned on <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Ecnomus_376f.html" title="Battle of Ecnomus">Battle of Ecnomus</a>?) <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrant65_6b0f.html" title="User:Grant65">Grant65</a> <a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGrant65_a485.html" title="User talk:Grant65">(Talk)</a> 22:34, Oct 19, 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The current version is my attempt for a compromise. As I said, it is cumbersome. In my opinion it all boils down to "generally considered". Most people read it as "most probably is". The meaning we should convey is that Leyte is "one of the two candidates for the largest naval battle in history". Probably not in those words, tough. The whole discussion seems to be more about definitions and wording than facts. <a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChino_6b6b.html" title="User:Chino">Chino</a></p>
<p>I don't think it is "one of two candidates" in terms of tonnage and area. And I don't think that is a "cumbersome" definition. I think you need to show why Ecnomus should be mentioned on the Leyte page.<a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrant65_6b0f.html" title="User:Grant65">Grant65</a> <a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGrant65_a485.html" title="User talk:Grant65">(Talk)</a> 11:40, Oct 21, 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Conceptually, I don't think there is a problem with mentioning Ecnomus - it's very common for article to namedrop topics with some kind of connection, and indeed that is one of the "value-adds" of being hyperlinked. But first I would like to see some citations of professional historians stating anything about relative sizes, rather than random people making claims on their own - very slender - authority. I'm on the road, so my own library is not at hand, but will be home in a couple days and able to consult relevant works. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStan_Shebs_9ea8.html" title="User:Stan Shebs">Stan</a> 16:22, 21 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If I understand Chino correctly, he is satisfied with the present wording of "generally considered", as long as Ecnomus is mentioned. No one else seems enthusiastic to mention Ecnomus --- or even to believe that the Roman sources are credible, but so be it. However, I do think the passage should be at the very top of the first paragraph since -- IMO --- the "epic" size of the battle is the most noteworthy fact about it.<a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrant65_6b0f.html" title="User:Grant65">Grant65</a> <a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGrant65_a485.html" title="User talk:Grant65">(Talk)</a> 09:54, Oct 25, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In general, they are useful because they provide a way for the English/Japanese-bilingual (and I hear there are millions of them in Japan&#160;:-) ) to check the accuracy of transliteration, but each only needs to appear once, in the article that introduces the transliterated term.

<p>An anonymous editor added a fifth battle to the list of engagements:</p>
<dl>
<dd>5. Although these battles were fought to secure Allied control of Leyte Gulf, when they were over, the Japanese controlled only the eastern third of the island of Leyte and they continued to be resupplied through their port of Ormoc on the western end. Continuous disruptive U.S. destroyer action in Ormoc Bay from 2 December 1944 through 11 December (the Battle of Ormoc Bay) caused the Japanese to abandon their Leyte garrison and withdraw from the area. Some historians now regard the Battle as the "fifth battle of the Battle for Leyte Gulf".</dd>

<p>"Some historians" appears to refer to Irwin J. Kappes, whose articles, (e.g. <a href="http://www.militaryhistoryonline.com/wwii/articles/leytegulfrevisited.aspx" class="external text" title="http://www.militaryhistoryonline.com/wwii/articles/leytegulfrevisited.aspx" rel="nofollow">The Battle for Leyte Gulf Revisited</a> and <a href="http://www.dd-692.com/a%20new%20look%20at%20leyte%20gulf.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.dd-692.com/a%20new%20look%20at%20leyte%20gulf.htm" rel="nofollow">A New Look at the Battle for Leyte Gulf</a> argue that historical accounts shouldn't stop on 26 October but should cover the later engagements. This is a fair enough point, and it's a good way for Kappes to advertise and dramatise his area of research.

<p>I added a few lines concerning Halsey's decision to pursue the carrier forces. When reading the article it sounded like this decision was downplayed in the body of the text, and I think the fact that Bogan and Lee (and Mitschner for that matter) all disagreed with it and saw through the ruse is worth mentioning. I hope this does not unbalance the article too much, but this decision of Halsey's definitely needs a bit more exploration.</p>

<p>It seems to me that the glaring error was that 7th fleet was not informed of either 3rd fleets whereabouts <i>or</i> the observation that the center force had turned again toward Leyte Gulf. Halsey may have the greatest share of the responsibility for that, but not at the time of the battle. Someone, from the president down to the officer in charge of relaying intelligence should have noted that since there was no central command, information needed to be passed between the independent commands, not just upward in the chain of command. It looks as though Halsey assumed that someone on his staff was distributing the plans and intelligence. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_R._Ingham_2670.html" title="User:David R.

<p>The other six battleships, which were actually battleships raised out of Pearl Harbor, were left in Leyte Gulf to provide shore bombardment. By sure, dumb, idiot luck, these battleships wound up protecting Leyte Gulf from Southern Force, but they were still too far south to play a large role in the battle against Center Force.

<p>The battleships in question were covering Surigao Strait at the time of the Samar battle. They were there to provide fire support for the landing as a first priority and defend against a surface fleet attack as a secondary priority. Given the need to cover both Surigao and San Bernardino strait against converging forces, it would have been difficult for them to fend off Kurita, Nishimura, and Shima at the same time. These battleships were older, 21 knot battleships with 14 or 16 inch guns carryilng mostly with explosive rounds(all of the BB type shells fired during this battle were armor piercing) rather than armor piercing shells. They had enough firepower to stop the Southern Forces *or* Kurita's force but not both at once, and they were not fast enough to come to Sprague's aid.</p>
<dl>
<dd>It seems to me that the Yamato might have been worth two or three 16" gun battle ships in a shoot-out, and there very probably wasn't enough ammunition in the Seventh Fleet to sink it. They were low on armor piercing before the first battle. Two battleships gave up on sinking the Bismarck because they were nearly out of fuel(they still had about two thirds of their main battery ammo left), and its armor(Bismarcks' 'equivalent' protection was slightly thicker{a combination of belt 'plus' the turtle deck protected the 'vitals'} and British AP shells are 'known' to be inferior) was not so thick. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_R._Ingham_2670.html" title="User:David R.

</dl>
<p>I don't have a book handy, but if I recall correctly, Halsey's flagship was one of the battleships of TF 34, so his decision would effectively have been to dispatch TF 38 (and other components of 3rd Fleet?). Which would have meant Halsey taking himself out of the carrier fight, or shifting himself and his staff to another ship on the spur of the moment.<br />

<p>I don't see any mention of the fact Halsey had in his hands <i>a copy of the plan</i> &amp; therefore knew (or damn well should have known) Ozawa's force was bait. He threw away a chance at the greatest naval victory in history, destroying both forces, &amp; instead damn near left Taffy 3 to their doom.

<p>Much of the recent changes in this article make it read more like a story than an an encyclopedic entry, particularly the <b><a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Leyte_Gulf_14ce.html#Battle_of_Samar" title="Battle of Leyte Gulf">Battle of Samar</a></b> section. <a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7ECOMPFUNK2_6eee.html" title="User:COMPFUNK2">Anthony Rupert</a> 05:09, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Specifically it reads like a script narrative to a History Channel version????</p>
<p><br />
Yeah... My bad. It was my first ever edit. I use the History channel alot but after that first one I've not, and will not, copy the History Channel word-for-word. (What can I say...? I was a Wikinoob.) (Nick31091 06:20, 26 February 2007 (UTC))</p>

<p>Each of the sub-battles of the Battle of Leyte Gulf could easily be separate articles:</p>
<ul>
<li>Battle of the Sibuyan Sea</li>
<li>Battle of Surigao Strait</li>
<li>Battle off Cape Engaño (ironic title, isn't it?)</li>
<li>Battle off Samar</li>

<p>The mission of the Japanese forces is surprisingly vague for a "Featured Article"--I don't question the content (altho I agree the tone is a little informal), but it's a vital and rarely-perused aspect of this battle. "Destroy the landing forces" is highly vague--but if that's the actual wording of the orders, then quote and document. But does that mean destroy the troops on Leyte?--because that was an impossibility even if all the battleship forces converged, which half didn't. Not only were the Army troops already deployed inland but spotting for IJN naval gunfire was next to impossible. (Japanese attempts at Guadalcanal on a mission as app. simple as shelling an airfield out of operation had been failures) Does it mean destroy the amphibious landing force in Leyte Gulf? Because 95% of all Allied vessels, large and small, ocean-going and amphibious, had already unloaded and departed before the battle. Does it mean destroy the supplies on the beachhead? While the most viable mission, it would also be the least likely to accomplish anything significant. Much of the previous reporting on this battle--which this article mirrors--has been to criticize Halsey, at the expense of exploring the true ramifications. Much like the validity of capturing Iwo Jima, few seem willing to question the validity of the IJN's concept--basically the Japanese were on a suicide-mission. Japan was likely to accomplish nothing but either the total or as in what finally occurred a partially-complete destruction of its Navy. Even a public embarrassment of the Allies by sinking some shipping was not likely to occur--the Allies successfully censored the bombing of Bari Harbor by the Germans in Dec. 1943.--Buckboard 08:19, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Well frankly, with the state of the IJN after the Turkey Shoot, even blasting a few empty cargo ships would have been a victory... (Nick31091 06:22, 26 February 2007 (UTC))</p>
