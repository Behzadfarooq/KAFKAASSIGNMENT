<p>In US usage the term "Nth Infantry" or "Nth Armored" refers to a regiment, not a division. So "9th Infantry" would be the 9th Infantry Regiment, not the 9th Infantry Division. This can cause some confusion so I added the term 'Division' where appropriate.</p>

<p>There is no such campaign as the North African Campaign. North Africa was a Sub-Theater of the europe-Africa-Middle East Theater of war in World War II.

<dd>I would disagree. We don't always go by official campaign names here (otherwise we'd be in a heap of problems with conflicting terms, overlap, country-specific names etc.). The NAC is certainly a prevelant enough name for the actions that the article describes. <a href="../../../o/b/e/User%7EOberiko_30df.html" title="User:Oberiko">Oberiko</a> 23:35, 8 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Corneliusseon is mistaken. Here are the US Army's relevant campaigns.</p>
<p>Egypt-Libya 11 June 1942-12 February 1943<br />
Algeria-French Morocco 8-11 November 1942<br />
Tunisia 17 November 1942-13 May 1943<br /></p>
<p>During the fighting the theater was officially termed the North African Theater of Operations (NATO). It was subordinated to the Mediterranean Theater of Operation (MTO), but never repeat never was a subordinate theater of war to the European Theater of Operations (ETO). After the war, the Army found it more convenient to issue a single campaign ribbon to cover the ETO, MTO, NATO, etc.</p>

<p>Here's what the <b>West Point Military History Series: Europe and the Mediterranian.</b> has to say in support of the (currently removed) edit:</p>
<p>1. "American armor was employed piecemeal, not in mass..."</p>
<p>2. "The II Corps commander....had proved to be indecisive in crisis."</p>
<p>3. "Initial dispositions had been too dispersed, thereby sacrificing an entire RCT."</p>
<p>4. "The Army Air Force had been ineffectively coordinated."</p>
<p>5. "Units had been haphazardly mixed."</p>
<p>6. "Patton had assumed command of the II Corps after Kasserine, and had immediately begun to rebuild its confidence and strength."</p>
<p>7. "Patton turned the II Corps over to...Bradley".</p>
<p>And here is Johnathan House in <b>Combined Arms Warfare in the Twentieth Century</b>:</p>
<p>1. "...a variety of factors, including inexperience, led American commanders to scatter their forces in regimental or smaller units, thereby depriving them of the advantages of the U.S. centralized fire-control system."</p>
<p>2. "In the crisis of Kasserine Pass, however, the artillery of the 1st and 9th Infantry Divisions was finally able to operate on an organized basis, with devastating effects on the Germans."</p>
<p>3. "Similar problems arose in the Southwest Pacific, where the ...32nd Division learned at great cost the need to coordinate artillery and air support with the infantry."</p>
<p>4. "Six months before the Normandy invasion, for example, thirty-three U.S. Divisions in England had experienced no joint air-ground training..."</p>
<p>5. "In 1943 the AAF changed the radios in fighter-bombers to a frequency that was incompatible with ground radios."</p>
<p>6. "In short, air and ground units went overseas with little understanding of the tactics and capabilites of their counterparts."</p>
<p>7. "...by early 1944 [in Italy] the British and Americans had improvised a close air support system."</p>
<p>This backs up much of the original edit. The Fredendall quotes were correct also. <a href="../../../d/m/o/User%7EDMorpheus_f8a6.html" title="User:DMorpheus">DMorpheus</a> 01:19, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>On Fredendall, here is <b>Army</b> magazine from March 2003:</p>
<p>1. "He was not a man who worked easily with others, either senior or junior to him."</p>
<p>2. "After several visits, Maj. Gen. Lucian Truscott, Deputy Chief of Staff and Eisenhower's personal representative in Tunisia, painted an unflattering portrait: <i>Small in stature, loud and rough in speech, he was outspoken in his opinions and critical of superiors and subordinates alike. He was inclined to jump to conclusions which were not always well founded. He rarely left his command post for personal visits and reconnaissance, yet he was impatient with the recommendations of subordinates more familiar with the terrain and other conditions than he.</i></p>
<p>3. "His outspoken antipathy for our allies, especially the British, was more than reciprocated. Anderson, his immediate superior, thought him incompetent."</p>
<p>4. "In a coalition command where allied cooperation was viewed as crucial to victory, Fredendall's open antagonism to the British was a serious management problem for Eisenhower. "</p>
<p>5. "Complicating his command relationships was his habit of speaking in a kind of shorthand slang, giving rise to confusion about what he actually meant. This sloppiness of speech and use of obscure, barely decipherable phrases occasionally caused serious problems, especially when he was issuing orders during battle."</p>
<p>6. "He had an openly hostile relationship with Maj. Gen. Orlando Ward, commanding general, 1st Armored Division, described by Truscott as "<i>an antipathy most unusual</i>." Ward was a quiet, intelligent, decorated combat veteran of World War I, respected throughout the Army. "</p>
<p>7. "The other division commanders, Maj. Gen. Terry Alien of the 1st Infantry, Maj. Gen. Charles (Doc) Ryder of the 34th, and Maj. Gen. Troy Middleton of the 9th, as well as many staff members, were also dissatisfied with Fredendall's leadership. Lt. Col. Hamilton Howze, Ward's operations officer (G-3) and later a four-star general, developed "<i>such a detestation for Fredendall that it was hard to control, simply because of the way he treated Gen. Ward</i>.""</p>
<p>8. "...his disposition of forces appeared piecemeal and sloppy. "</p>
<p>9. "Ike was especially shocked by the dug-in, well-fortified and inaccessible command post (CP) so far from the front -more than 70 miles-and Fredendall's unwillingness to leave it for front-line visits. Located deep in a ravine that was accessible by a narrow road constructed by II Corps engineers, Speedy Valley as it was called, took three weeks to build and absorbed the efforts of a full company of men working day and night blasting elaborate shelters for the headquarters. It was, in Omar Bradley's words, "an embarrassment to every American soldier" and was contemptuouslytuously referred to as "Lloyd's very last resort" and "Shangri-la, a million miles from nowhere."" (Note: my edit had wrongly said an engineer battalion was committed to this effort. My bad.)</p>
<p>10. "The troop dispositions were disappointing, with infantry, tank and artillery units intermixed and based on widely separated hills unable to support each other. It was exactly the "penny packet" formations that had led to British defeats in the early phase of the Desert War. Eisenhower's original idea was to maintain the 1st Armored as a fully massed and mobile reaction force able to intervene decisively wherever needed. Now it was scattered all over the field. Even more troubling, Ike learned that Fredendall had never visited the front and that the deployments were based on maps hanging in his underground headquarters."</p>
<p>11. "Eisenhower: "<i>What do you think of the command here?"</i> Bradley: <i>"It's pretty bad. I've talked to all the division commanders. To a man they've lost confidence in Fredendall as the corps commander.""</i> March 5 1943 at II Corps HQ.</p>

<p>It looks like you have done your homework, but I question why you left out the most significant observation made about the subject on page 175 of <u>The West Point Military History Series: Europe and the Mediterranian.</u> I have no objection to the material in question being restored, although I reserve the possiblity that it might require some minor editing.</p>
<p>Now that we have this out of the way, it would be very nice if you would go to the Sherman page and restore, not revert, the material you reverted previously. (Remember, I provided the sources you requested.)</p>

<dd>Thank you, Philippsbourg. If I had known it was citations you were looking for, I could have done the same. <a href="../../../j/w/y/User%7EJwy_3c30.html" title="User:Jwy">John (Jwy)</a> 05:45, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well call me puzzled. Phillipsbourg already had this reference and now has no problem with the edit he reverted. Why then was it ever reverted if he knew it was a valid edit? Why was the edit labeled "questionable"?</dd>

<p>P.S. The after-action reports from 1st Armored Div, as well as Harmon's report on "Lessons Learned" lend further support and additional detail to the original edit. <a href="../../../d/m/o/User%7EDMorpheus_f8a6.html" title="User:DMorpheus">DMorpheus</a> 13:50, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't know the details, but would suggest that it might be more of a disagreement over appropriate content than a "mistake." In any event, the information you entered is available by selecting the appropriate entry on the history tab of the page in question.

<p>The battle box's "DECISIVE German victory" certainly makes no sense. Also, please see the casualty question below.<a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikist_e9e5.html" title="User:Wikist">Wikist</a> 13:43, 16 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The casualty figures look questionable; perhaps people mixed different geographic or time scales. Compare the battle box to this forum post (the poster identifies himself as from the Dupuy Institute which specializes in statistical analysis of casualties):</p>
<dl>
<dd>"Actual US tank losses from 14 to 20 February were 98 medium and 2 light tanks. Of those, 46 medium and 2 light tanks were lost 14 February at Sidi Bou Zid and 48 medium tanks were lost in the US counterattack at Sidi Bou Zid on 15 February. The remaining 4 medium tanks were lost 16-20 February, most likely in the operations near Kasserine Pass itself.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>"The battle casualties are somewhat more confused, but hardly approached the levels suggested, especially in killed. Total battle casualties to US Army forces engaged in the battle (1st AD and elements of the 1st and 34th ID), for the entire campaign (8 November 1942-13 May 1943) included just 1,625 KIA, 5,757 WIA and 3,990 MIA and CAP. And for February, total theater casualties to the US Army, including Air Corps, were 431 KIA, 1,014 WIA and 3,355 MIA and CAP.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>"As far as the fragmentary battle casualty reports for the engagements go, it may be estimated that from 14-20 February losses were 45-46 KIA, 130-176 WIA and 2,138-2,378 MIA."</dd>

<dd>If you go look at the external resource list on the task force page, you will find a link to the <i><b>official list of casualties</b></i> that are posted over on the CMH website.

<p>A month has passed with no corroboration so I removed the losses numbers from the battle box. The box dated 2/19-25 combined with the text on Faid 2/14-19 claimed that the US lost 418 tanks and 986 vehicles in 12 days. Sources seem to agree that most losses occurred before 2/21 and the Army lists II Corp's entire losses for the entire month 1/21-2/21 at 183 tanks and 828 other vehicles (Mayo 1991 p. 138). <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikist_e9e5.html" title="User:Wikist">Wikist</a> 20:32, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Someone posted new anonymous figures in the battle box that claim that Fredendall's troops lost 10,000 dead and wounded in 12 days, while another source claims that the primary US units lost only 7,400 dead and wounded in all the entire 6 months of North African combat.<a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikist_e9e5.html" title="User:Wikist">Wikist</a> 18:03, 20 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>AFAIK, we don't accept forum postings as official sources, as the poster is almost always anonymous and not properly verified. Published materials, on the other hand, are quite acceptable.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If you have casualty figures with sources to back them up, there's no problem with changing them. Just be sure to make note of your source (and page if possible) in a reference beside the figures. Should someone else have other published materials which list different figures, then both will be expressed as a range. <a href="../../../o/b/e/User%7EOberiko_30df.html" title="User:Oberiko">Oberiko</a> 18:38, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I will post the info of the book, try to buy it so you can check it personaly, if i post the spanish information some people will not believe it and the other source have a sourced aproximation. so it will tak e some time.Thanks.<br />
