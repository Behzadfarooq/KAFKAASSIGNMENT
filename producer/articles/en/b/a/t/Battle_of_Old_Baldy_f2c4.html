<p>The <b>Battle of Old Baldy</b> usually refers to a series of five engagements over a period of 10 months for Hill 266 in west-central Korea, though there was also vicous fighting both before and after these engagements..</p>
<p>As May turned to June, <a href="../../../m/a/j/Major_General_811b.html" title="Major General">Major General</a> David L. Ruffner of the <a href="../../../4/5/t/45th_Infantry_Division_%28United_States%29_9360.html" title="45th Infantry Division (United States)">45th Division</a> (holding the right flank of the <a href="../../../i/_/c/I_Corps_%28United_States%29_9c63.html" title="I Corps (United States)">I Corps'</a> line, was frustrated by the splendid view that enemy observers had of his division’s positions.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> Opposing the 45th Division from east to west were elements of the 338th and 339th Regiments, 113th Division, <a href="../../../3/8/t/38th_Army_%28People%27s_Republic_of_China%29_5388.html" title="38th Army (People's Republic of China)">38th Army</a>; 350th and 349th Regiments, 117th Division, 39th Army; and the 344th Regiment, <a href="../../../1/1/5/115th_Division_%28People%27s_Republic_of_China%29_b79e.html" title="115th Division (People's Republic of China)">115th Division</a>, 39th Army. The other infantry components of the 113th, 115th, and 117th Divisions were in reserve, as was the <a href="../../../1/1/6/116th_Division_%28People%27s_Republic_of_China%29_9750.html" title="116th Division (People's Republic of China)">116th Division</a>, 39th Army. The Chinese had over ten battalions of artillery positioned along the front in direct or general support roles. Maj. Gen. Ruffner laid plans for Operation Counter, a two-phase operation to capture and hold 12 outposts a few thousand yards in front of the main line.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup> One of the most prominent hills came to be called "Old Baldy", which earned its nickname after artillery and mortar fire destroyed the trees on its crest. But as the highest point on a prominent east-west ridge, Old Baldy held strategic importance because it dominated terrain in three directions.</p>
<p>The battle for Old Baldy was costly to both sides. Through July 21, 1952, the United Nations had lost 357 men in the battle for the hill, and Chinese casualties were estimated to be more than 1,000.</p>

<p>Several <a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_strike.html" title="Air strike">air strikes</a> on known enemy strongpoints close to the outpost objectives took place during the daylight hours of June 6, 1952. Then, after dark, various units ranging from a squad to almost a company, advanced to take possession of the outposts. Evidently the Chinese had not anticipated the operation, for the attack units encountered little opposition except at Outpost 10 on Hill 255 and Outpost 11 on Hill 266. The former, which was to become better known as <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Pork_Chop_Hill_925a.html" title="Battle of Pork Chop Hill">Porkchop Hill</a>, was taken by two <a href="../../../p/l/a/Platoon.html" title="Platoon">platoons</a> from I Company, 180th, after a 55-minute fire fight with two Chinese platoons. On Old Baldy, two squads from A Company, 180th Infantry, exchanged small arms and automatic weapons fire with two Chinese squads, then withdrew and directed <a href="../../../a/r/t/Artillery.html" title="Artillery">artillery</a> fire upon the Chinese.</p>
<p>Pfc. James Ortega, a <a href="../../../f/o/r/Forward_observer.html" title="Forward observer">forward observer</a> for the 171st Field Artillery Battalion, jumped into a trench and directed the artillery concentration which pounded the top of the hill with 500 rounds. When the artillery ceased, the men from A Company again probed the enemy's positions. Meeting intense fire, M/Sgt. John O. White took a squad, reinforced by a BAR and machine gun, and made a sweep to the rear of the enemy where they advanced to within 25 feet of the Chinese before attacking. As the Chinese resistance crumbled, the infantrymen from A Company pushed their way toward the crest of Old Baldy, where Chinese artillery immediately began to come in. Despite the enemy fire, the A Company squads hung on and took possession of Old Baldy shortly after midnight.</p>
<p>Once the outposts were seized, the task of organizing them defensively got under way. Aided by Korean Service Corps personnel the men of the 279th and 180th Infantry Regiments brought in construction and fortification materials and worked through the night. They built <a href="../../../b/u/n/Bunker.html" title="Bunker">bunkers</a> with overhead protection so that their own artillery could use <a href="../../../p/r/o/Proximity_fuze.html" title="Proximity fuze">proximity fuze</a> shells when an enemy attack drew close to the outpost. They ringed the outposts with barbed wire and placed <a href="../../../l/a/n/Land_mine.html#Anti-personnel_.28AP.29_mines" title="Land mine">mines</a> along the avenues of approach which were also covered by automatic weapons. Whenever possible, they sited their <a href="../../../m/a/c/Machine_gun.html" title="Machine gun">machine guns</a> and <a href="../../../r/e/c/Recoilless_rifle.html" title="Recoilless rifle">recoilless rifles</a> in positions where they could provide support to adjacent outposts. Signal personnel set up communications to the rear and laterally to other outposts by radio and wire and porters brought in stockpiles of ammunition. Back on the main line of resistance, infantry, tank, and artillery support weapons had drawn up fire plans to furnish the outposts with protective fires and a prebriefed reinforcing element was prepared to go to the immediate assistance of each outpost in the event of enemy attack. By morning the new 24-hour outposts were ready to withstand counterattacks, and garrison forces of from 18 to 44 men were left behind as the bulk of the forces from the 279th and 180th Infantry Regiments withdrew to the main line of resistance. <sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>Recollection from March 1952 of the Battle for Old Baldy, “The Ethiopians took Old Baldy from the ‘Chinks’ but when they turned it over to us, we lost it again. The Ethiopians are going to try to get it back.” --Edward L. Pierce<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Old_Baldy_f2c4.html" title="Edit section: First battle of Old Baldy - June 26 - July 17 1952">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">First battle of Old Baldy - June 26 - July 17 1952</span></h2>
<p>The contest for Old Baldy became very heated on June 26, 1952. Almost 1,000 feet west of the crest the Chinese had established positions that posed a constant threat to the 45th Division outpost and the 179th Infantry Regiment's troops in the area. Colonel Sandlin decided to destroy the enemy strongpoints. Early in the morning the 179th Infantry Regiment vacated its outpost on Old Baldy to permit air strikes and artillery and mortar barrages to be placed on the enemy positions. Eight fighter-bombers from the Fifth Air Force dropped bombs and loosed rockets and machine gun fire; then 45th Division artillery and mortar units began to lay concentrations on the enemy strongpoints.</p>
<p>C Company (Reinforced), 179th Infantry, under 1st Lt. John B. Blount, and F Company, 180th Infantry, commanded by Captain Tiller, which was attached to the 179th, attacked after the artillery and mortar fire. With C Company moving in from the left and F Company, supported by a tank, coming in from the right finger of Old Baldy, the assault forces soon ran into heavy small arms and automatic weapons fire from the two Chinese companies who comprised the defense force. After an hour of fighting the Chinese suddenly pulled back and directed artillery and mortar fire upon the attacking units. When the fire ceased, the Chinese quickly came back and closed with the men of C and F Companies in the trenches. A Company, 179th Infantry, under 1st Lt. George L. Vaughn, came up to reinforce the attack during the afternoon, for the enemy machine guns were making it difficult for men of C and F Companies to move over the crest of the hill. The attack force regrouped, with F Company taking over the holding of the left and right fingers of Old Baldy, C Company holding the old Outpost 11 position, and A Company working its way around the right flank of the enemy defenders. For two hours the battle continued as the Chinese used hand grenades and machine guns to repel each attempt to drive them from their positions. Late in the day two tanks lumbered up the hill to help reduce the Chinese strongpoints; one turned over and the second threw a track, but they managed to inflict some damage before they were put out of action. Gradually the Chinese evacuated their positions and the 179th was able to send engineers and several more tanks up to the crest.</p>
<p>During the night of 26 June and the following day the three companies dug in to consolidate their defense positions on Old Baldy. On the afternoon of 27 June L Company, 179th Infantry, under 1st Lt. William T. Moroney, took over defense of the crest and F Company, 180th Infantry, moved back to a supporting position. C Company and elements of A Company held the ground northwest of the crest.</p>
<p>When night fell, enemy activity around Old Baldy increased. Mortar and artillery fire began to come in on the 179th Infantry Regiment's positions and Chinese flares warned that the Chinese were on the move. At 2200 hours the Chinese struck the defenders of L Company from the northeast and southwest. An estimated reinforced battalion pressed on toward the crest until it met a circle of defensive fire. From the main line of resistance, artillery, mortar, tank, and infantry weapons covered Chinese avenues of approach. L Company added its small arms, automatic weapons, and hand grenades to the circle which kept the Chinese at bay. Unable to penetrate the ring, the Chinese withdrew and regrouped at midnight.</p>
<p>The second and third attacks followed the same pattern. Each lasted over an hour during the early morning of June 28th and each time the Chinese failed to break through the wall of defensive fires. After suffering casualties estimated at between 250 and 325 men, the Chinese broke off the fight. The 179th Infantry reported six men killed and sixty-one wounded during the three engagements.</p>
<p>Late in the evening of June 28th, the Chinese artillery and mortar fire on Old Baldy signaled the approach of another attack. Four Chinese squads reconnoitered the 179th positions at 2200 hours, exchanging automatic weapons and small arms fire. About an hour later the main assault began with a force estimated at two reinforced battalions moving in from the northeast and northwest behind a very heavy artillery and mortar barrage. This time the Chinese penetrated the perimeter and hand-to hand fighting broke out. Shortly after midnight a UNC flare plane began to illuminate the battle area and the defensive fires from the main line of resistance, coupled with the steady stream of small arms and automatic weapons fire from the three companies of the 179th on the hill, became more effective. By 0100 on June 29th, the Chinese disengaged to the north, having suffered losses estimated at close to 700 men. In return the Chinese had fired over 4,000 rounds of artillery and mortar fire and the 179th Infantry had suffered 43 casualties, including 8 killed in action.</p>
<p>As June ended, the 45th Division, despite the lack of combat experience of many of its troops, had acquitted itself well on the battlefield. In the fight for the outposts the division had withstood more than twenty Chinese counterattacks and inflicted an estimated 3,500 casualties on the enemy. It had also won a commendation from General <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Van_Fleet_9637.html" title="James Van Fleet">Van Fleet</a>. The Chinese made one more attempt to wrest control of Old Baldy from the 45th Division's possession on the night of July 3-4. Three separate attacks, the last in battalion strength, met the same fate as their predecessors as the concentration of defensive firepower first blunted and then forced the Chinese to desist in their assaults.</p>

<p>The Chinese had not attempted to take the hill again until the <a href="../../../2/n/d/2nd_Infantry_Division_%28United_States%29_8e0d.html" title="2nd Infantry Division (United States)">U.S. 2nd Division</a> relieved the 45th Division during mid July.

The Chinese took advantage of the relief as they mounted two attacks on the night of July 17-18 in strengths exceeding a reinforced battalion. Through quick reinforcement of the Old Baldy outpost and heavy close defensive fires, E and F Companies, <a href="../../../2/3/r/23rd_Infantry_Regiment_%28United_States%29_7184.html" title="23rd Infantry Regiment (United States)">23rd Infantry Regiment</a>, who were defending the hill managed to repel the first Chinese assault. But the second won a foothold on the slopes which the Chinese reinforced and then exploited. Chinese artillery and mortar fire became very intense; then the Chinese infantry followed up swiftly and seized the crest. Counterattacks by the 23d Regiment supported by air strikes and artillery and mortar fire, did not succeed in driving the Chinese from the newly won positions. By July 20 the 2nd Division elements had regained only a portion of the east finger of Old Baldy. The onset of the rainy season made operations exceedingly difficult to carry out during the rest of the month.</p>
<p>As the torrential downpours converted the Korean battleground into a morass in the last week of July, the U.N. Command counted its losses on Old Baldy during the month. Through July 21 the tally showed 39 killed, 234 wounded, and 84 missing for the UNC and an estimated 1,093 killed and wounded for the Chinese.</p>

<p>When the rain eased off at the end of July, the 23rd Infantry Regiment again sought to secure complete control of Old Baldy. Since the Chinese had an estimated two platoons on the crest, the 23d sent two reinforced companies up the slopes after artillery and mortar preparatory fires on the Chinese positions. Edging toward the Chinese defenses, the 2nd Division forces used small arms fire and hand grenades as they reached the trenches. After bitter hand-to-hand combat, the two companies finally gained the crest early on August 1 and dug in to prepare for the customary counterattack, Two hundred flares were distributed around the UNC positions and forty-two air sorties were flown during the day in support. That night the Chinese sent first mortar, then artillery fire at the crest, dropping an estimated 2,500 rounds on the 23d Regiment elements. But counterattacks were driven off.</p>
<p>Mines, bunkers, and additional wire helped to strengthen the UNC hold on Old Baldy on August 2, and extremely heavy and effective artillery fire broke up another enemy assault on August 4.</p>
