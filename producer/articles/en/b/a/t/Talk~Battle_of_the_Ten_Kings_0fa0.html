<p>The idea that Sudas *fought* the Bharatas strikes me as more than a little odd. As far as I understand the Vedic hymns, Sudas was the king of the Bharatas, not their opponent, and it was the Bharatas who were attacked by, and defeated, the alliance of ten chiefs (vedic "raja" really ought not to be rendered "king", though it often is). A quick Google search shows this to be confirmed by several articles in the EJVS (see <a href="http://www1.shore.net/~india/ejvs/ejvs1005/1005.txt" class="external autonumber" title="http://www1.shore.net/~india/ejvs/ejvs1005/1005.txt" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, <a href="http://www1.shore.net/~india/ejvs/ejvs0703/ejvs0703d.txt" class="external autonumber" title="http://www1.shore.net/~india/ejvs/ejvs0703/ejvs0703d.txt" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, and these <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=+site:www1.shore.net+bharata+sudas" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=+site:www1.shore.net+bharata+sudas" rel="nofollow">search results</a>) and the <a href="http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-46842?hook=485138#485138.hook" class="external text" title="http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-46842?hook=485138#485138.hook" rel="nofollow">Britannica</a>. Are you sure the cited sources really say the opposite? Vedic grammar makes my head spin, but I find it hard to believe the reference to the Bharatas in 7:33:6 and 3:53:24 could be that ambiguous - it seems quite clear to me.</p>
<p>As far as the reference to Vishwamitra egging the kings on goes, the tradition is that Sudas dismissed Vishwamitra as his priest and replaced him with Vasishta, in retaliation for which Vishwamitra assembled the alliance. I believe this tradition is based on an interpretation of the relationship between RV 3:33, 3:53 and the dasarajña verses in RV Book 7. The Britannica article I linked to above seems to endorse some bits of this, but my books are at the other end of the world and I do not remember exactly what view critical scholarship takes of it. -- <a href="../../../v/a/d/User%7EVadakkan_8a7e.html" title="User:Vadakkan">Arvind</a> 21:58, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
let's see... I think it is less a matter of grammar than of interpretation of the context. in 7.33.6, we learn that</p>
<ul>
<li>following the battle (33.5), the Bharatas were defenceless (leaderless?)</li>
<li>Vasishtha became their leader</li>
<li>thus were the ranks of the Trstus increased</li>
</ul>
<p>It appears to me that the Bharatas <i>lost</i> their king in the battle, and so passed under the rule of Sudas/Vasishtha. This would mean that Sudas was indeed king of the Bharatas, but only <i>as a result</i> of the battle. Your EJVS link (S.S.N. Murthy) seems to claim that Sudas was not king of the Trtsu, but of the Bharatas, <i>allied</i> with the Trtsus. <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monier-Williams_d05a.html" title="Monier-Williams">Monier-Williams</a>, however, simply lists him as a king of the Trtsu <a href="http://flaez.ch/cgi-bin/mw.pl?query=sudAs" class="external autonumber" title="http://flaez.ch/cgi-bin/mw.pl?query=sudAs" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> (<i>and</i> mentions that both Vishvamitra and Vasistha were at his court). The EB unfortunately gives no source for its version, and I imagine it is well possible that the Bharatas "changed sides" in later (post-RV) versions, especially since "Bharata" came to be a prestigious name. We should of course take note of this if we can pin it down to a source. Unfortunately, the Bharatas are not mentioned at all in our "best" account, that of 7.18. I would be interested in a source of the Vishvamitra story; it does not appear to be in the RV itself, but I am of course willing to believe that it appears in commentaries on the story (unfortunately, I don't have Sayana available just now, maybe he has more info). <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 22:17, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li>If you look at the second link above<a href="http://www1.shore.net/~india/ejvs/ejvs0703/ejvs0703d.txt" class="external autonumber" title="http://www1.shore.net/~india/ejvs/ejvs0703/ejvs0703d.txt" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>, you'll see that Michael Witzel, too, takes the view that Sudas was a king of the Bharatas which makes it unlikely to be just a post-Vedic tradition, since he comes down quite harshly on those who use later traditions to interpret Vedic verses. This [<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=+site:www1.shore.net+bharata+sudas" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=+site:www1.shore.net+bharata+sudas" rel="nofollow">search</a> is restricted to the EVJS, and nearly all the articles it throws up call him a Bharata (the ones that don't don't seem to address the question at all). That seems a pretty significant weight of scholarly opinion.</li>
<li>But let's get to the more fun bit (in dangerous violation of the Original Research ban, but good fun nonetheless). I'm looking at the Vedic now, and the word used in 7:33:6 is "arbhakAsaH" which means "small" or "weak". "Defenceless" is a contextual rather than literal rendering, and I don't see any context of leaderlessness at all in the word. Further, Vasishtha is described as becoming the Bharatas' "puretA". "puraetR" - literally one who goes before - signifies "leader" in the sense of "guide" and also in a stronger sense, but it doesn't have the sense of "overlord" which is what would be required.</li>
<li>In addition, and this to me seems quite conclusive, I simply see no way to read 3:53 in its entirety that doesn't make Sudas a Bharata.</li>
<li>On the Vishwamitra story, I called it a "tradition" for very good reason - i.e., I don't know its ultimate source although I suspect it may well be quite late! I'll do some digging when I next visit my parents (where most of my books still remain), but that, alas, is not likely to be for a good many months. If you have access to Sayana, it would be interesting to see if he has anything to say about it. -- <a href="../../../v/a/d/User%7EVadakkan_8a7e.html" title="User:Vadakkan">Arvind</a> 23:04, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>to avoid misunderstandings: I do not mean to <i>posit</i> that Sudas was not king of the Bharatas. I just found nothing to that effect impressing itself on me in the texts. If authorities agree that he was, I am happy to accept that, but I would still be interested on what grounds they believe so. I admit that Sudas seems to be associated with the Bharatas in 3.53. But what is the relation between Bharatas, Kushikas, and Trtsus? Are the Bharatas some sort of super-tribe that includes sub-tribes? As I said, my personal understanding was that Sudas <i>became</i> king of the Bharatas as a result of the battle, which might explain 3.53, which after all refers to the time of Sudas and Vishvamitra as lying in the past (9cd, <i>vishvaámitro yád ávahat sudaásam / ápriyaayata kushikébhir índraH</i> "at the time when Vishvamitra guided Sudas, Indra by means of the Kushikas[?] grew friendly"). Your excellently informed "OR" is most welcome btw. At present, it would seem wise to accept from your sources that Sudas was a Bharata and his enemies were Purus. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 14:21, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I recovered my reference for the Bharatas being on the side of the ten kings: the 1911 Britannica has</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Not unfrequently, too, the light-colored Aryas wage internecine war with one another — as when the Bharatas, with allied tribes of the Panjab, goaded on by the royal sage Vishvamitra, invade the country of the Trtsu king Sudas, to be defeated in the ten kings battle, through the inspired power of the priestly singer Vasishtha.</i> (see <a href="../../../v/e/d/Vedic_civilization_EB_1911_f351.html" title="Vedic civilization/EB 1911">Vedic civilization/EB 1911</a>)</dd>

<p>This may of course be an outdated opinion, but nevertheless shows that the case is unclear and we should try to trace the debate. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 14:36, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm almost positive that Michael Witzel devotes some space to discussing this war in a chapter in the <b>Indo-Aryans of Ancient South Asia</b> collection.

<p>an anon contributor tried to paint this battle as some sort of founding myth of both India <i>and</i> Persia. That is just too far-fetched. <i>All</i> we really know about this battle is in the couple of verses that are fully addressed here. It will not do to set this up as the big Deva/Indian vs. Asura/Persian showdown. At best, we can say that this was a battle that set the scene for the emergence of the Mahajanapadas. If the battle has fed speculation in literature, we'll have to discuss this separately, attributing each bit of speculation to a specific author. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(𒁳)</a></small> 09:05, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree on the list - in fact, I think a "For information on the tribes involved, see ..." would cover it without having to include a big list. If consensus is that the list stays, I personally would prefer a bare list of links with no commentary, except perhaps a "Minor role only" parenthesis if that is the case. <a href="../../../o/r/p/User%7EOrpheus_fee3.html" title="User:Orpheus">Orpheus</a> 23:23, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
