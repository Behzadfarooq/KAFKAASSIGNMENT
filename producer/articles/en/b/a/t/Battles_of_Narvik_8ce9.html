<p>On <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_1.html" title="March 1">1 March</a> <a href="../../../1/9/4/1940.html" title="1940">1940</a>, <a href="../../../a/d/o/Adolf_Hitler_fdc0.html" title="Adolf Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> ordered the invasion of Norway, codenamed <i><a href="../../../w/e/s/Weser%C3%BCbung.html" title="Weserübung">Weserübung</a></i>. This operation would involve most of the German navy (<i><a href="../../../k/r/i/Kriegsmarine.html" title="Kriegsmarine">Kriegsmarine</a></i>). Participating units were divided into six groups, which were to occupy the main Norwegian ports.</p>
<p>Group I departed <a href="../../../b/r/e/Bremerhaven.html" title="Bremerhaven">Bremerhaven</a> on <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_6.html" title="April 6">6 April</a>. It consisted of ten <a href="../../../g/e/r/German_World_War_II_destroyers_02a6.html" title="German World War II destroyers">German destroyers</a> (<i>Georg Thiele</i>, <i>Wolfgang Zenker</i>, <i>Bernd von Arnim</i>, <i>Erich Giese</i>, <i>Erich Koellner</i>, <i>Diether von Roeder</i>, <i>Hans Lüdemann</i>, <i>Hermann Künne</i>, <i>Wilhelm Heidkamp</i> (<a href="../../../f/l/a/Flagship.html" title="Flagship">flagship</a>) and <i>Anton Schmitt</i>, commanded by Commodore <a href="../../../f/r/i/Friedrich_Bonte_e646.html" title="Friedrich Bonte">Friedrich Bonte</a>. Each of the warships carried 200 soldiers (a total 2,000 Austrian mountain troopers <i>(<a href="../../../g/e/b/Gebirgsj%C3%A4ger.html" title="Gebirgsjäger">Gebirgsjäger</a>)</i> from the 139. Gebirgsjägerregiment commanded by General <a href="../../../e/d/u/Eduard_Dietl_41d3.html" title="Eduard Dietl">Eduard Dietl</a>).</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_9.html" title="April 9">9 April</a> in the early morning, the destroyers of Group I passed <a href="../../../v/e/s/Vestfjord.html" title="Vestfjord">Vestfjord</a> and arrived at <a href="../../../o/f/o/Ofotfjord.html" title="Ofotfjord">Ofotfjord</a> leading to Narvik, in fog and heavy snow. In Ofotfjord they captured three Norwegian patrol boats (<i><a href="../../../s/e/n/Senja.html" title="Senja">Senja</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Sars_f461.html" title="Michael Sars">Michael Sars</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../k/e/l/Kelt.html" title="Kelt">Kelt</a></i>). The German ships <i>Wolfgang Zenker</i>, <i>Erich Koellner</i> and <i>Hermann Kunne</i> landed their soldiers in Herjangsfjord (part of Ofotfjord) in order to capture a supply base in Elvegaardsmoen. <i>Hans Ludemann</i> and <i>Hermann Künne</i> also landed their troops in order to engage the nearby Norwegian forts (which turned out to be non-existent). <i>Diether von Roeder</i> remained in Ofotfjord in order to ensure German control of the sea. <i>Erich Giese</i> was delayed by engine trouble and did not join the main force for some time.</p>
<p>The destroyers, moving closer to Narvik, were spotted by Norwegian vessels, which promptly reported the sighting and alerted the old armored <a href="../../../c/o/a/Coastal_defence_ship.html" title="Coastal defence ship">coastal defence ships</a> <a href="../../../h/n/o/HNoMS_Eidsvold_f195.html" title="HNoMS Eidsvold">HNoMS <i>Eidsvold</i></a> and <a href="../../../h/n/o/HNoMS_Norge_898e.html" title="HNoMS Norge">HNoMS <i>Norge</i></a>. Both Norwegian ships prepared for combat: the guns were loaded and life preservers issued to the crew. Around 04:15am, the Germans spotted <i>Eidsvold</i>, and <i>Eidsvold</i> immediately signalled the leading German destroyer with an <a href="../../../a/l/d/Aldis_lamp.html" title="Aldis lamp">aldis lamp</a>. When the Germans failed to respond to the signal, a warning shot was fired across their bow while the <i>Eidsvold</i> flew a <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_maritime_signal_flags.html" title="International maritime signal flags">two flag signal</a>, ordering the destroyer to halt.</p>
<p>The Germans had orders to occupy Norway peacefully if at all possible, so the German flagship <i>Wilhelm Heidkamp</i> stopped and signalled that it would send an officer to negotiate. From a distance of about 200 meters, a small launch ferried Korvettenkapitän (lieutenant commander) Gerlach over to <i>Eidsvold</i>. Gerlach and a signalman were taken to the bridge to speak to Captain Willoch. At the same time, the gun crews of both the 21 cm guns and the 15 cm guns aboard <i>Eidsvold</i> kept the German destroyer in their sights, at point-blank range.</p>
<p>Gerlach tried to convince Willoch that the Germans had arrived as friends and that Willoch should surrender peacefully. Willoch pointed out that he was bound by duty to resist, but asked for a ten-minute break to consider the matter. He used this time to contact his superiors, including the captain of <i>Norge</i>, further inside the fjord, informing them of his intent to engage the German forces. In the meantime, a second German destroyer crossed behind <i>Eidsvold</i> and took up a position 700 meters from the vessel, ready to fire her torpedoes.</p>
<p>Gerlach tried once again to convince Willoch to surrender, but Willoch refused. As Gerlach left <i>Eidsvold</i>, he fired a red flare, indicating that the Norwegians intended to fight. At this point, Captain Willoch shouted: <i>"På plass ved kanonene. Nå skal vi slåss, gutter!"</i> ("Man the guns. We're going to fight, boys!"). <i>Eidsvold</i> turned towards the closest destroyer and accelerated, while the battery commander ordered the port battery (three 15 cm guns) to open fire.</p>
<p>The Germans, afraid that <i>Eidsvold</i> might ram the destroyer, fired two or four torpedoes from <i>Wilhelm Heidkamp</i> at the old ship. Two or three of the torpedoes hit before the port guns could fire, according to Norwegian sources: one under the rear turret, one midship and one in the bow. It is likely that the torpedoes ignited one of the magazines aboard, because <i>Eidsvold</i> was blown in two and sank in seconds around 04:37am, propellers still turning. Only six of the crew were rescued by the Germans, 175 died in the freezing water.</p>
<p>Deeper inside the fjord, the explosions were heard aboard <i>Norge</i>, but nothing could be seen until two German destroyers suddenly appeared out of the darkness and Captain Per Askim of <i>Norge</i> gave orders to open fire at 04:45am. Four rounds were fired from the 21 cm guns (one from the fore gun and three from the aft) as well as seven or eight rounds from the starboard 15 cm guns, against the German destroyer <i>Bernd von Arnim</i>, at a range of about 800 meters. Due to the difficult weather conditions, the guns' <a href="../../../o/p/t/Optical_sight.html" title="Optical sight">optical sights</a> were ineffective: the first salvo fell short of the target and the next ones overshot it.</p>
<p>The German destroyers waited until they were alongside the pier before returning fire. <i>Bernd von Armin</i> opened fire with her 12.7 cm (5 inch) guns as well as with machine guns, but the weather gave the Germans problems as well. The destroyer also fired three salvos of two torpedoes each. The first two salvos missed, but the last struck <i>Norge</i> midships and she sank in less than one minute. 90 of the crew were rescued, but 101 perished in the battle which had lasted less than 20 minutes. The destruction of "Norge" signaled the stop of Norwegian resistance in the port.</p>
<p>The German destroyers were now short of fuel and had only one fuel tanker in support (<i>Johann Wellem</i>); a second tanker, <i>Kattegat</i> had been sunk in the <a href="../../../g/l/o/Glomfjord.html" title="Glomfjord">Glomfjord</a> in the evening of <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_9.html" title="April 9">9 April</a>. Kattegat had been stopped by the Norwegian fishery protection ship <i>Nordkapp</i>, the Norwegian ship first trying to take the tanker as a <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prize_%28law%29.html" title="Prize (law)">prize</a>, but due to the large German crew could not control it all the way to <a href="../../../b/o/d/Bod%C3%B8.html" title="Bodø">Bodø</a>, in the end sinking <b>Kattegat</b> by firing four 47 mm rounds into the tanker's water line. Refueling was difficult, only two destroyers could be refuelled simultaneously, taking seven or eight hours.</p>
<p>In the meantime, British forces had tried to engage the German navy, but for the most part, unsuccessfully. On <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_8.html" title="April 8">8 April</a>, the British <a href="../../../g/_/a/G_and_H_class_destroyer_1472.html" title="G and H class destroyer">destroyer</a> HMS "<a href="../../../h/m/s/HMS_Glowworm_%28H92%29_9fef.html" title="HMS Glowworm (H92)">Glowworm</a>" engaged the <a href="../../../h/e/a/Heavy_cruiser.html" title="Heavy cruiser">heavy cruiser</a> <a href="../../../g/e/r/German_cruiser_Admiral_Hipper_4774.html" title="German cruiser Admiral Hipper"><i>Admiral Hipper</i></a> and two destroyers, and was lost, ramming and damaging <i>Hipper</i> in the battle. On <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_9.html" title="April 9">9 April</a>, the British <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battlecruiser.html" title="Battlecruiser">battlecruiser</a> HMS <a href="../../../h/m/s/HMS_Renown_%281916%29_f645.html" title="HMS Renown (1916)"><i>Renown</i></a> exchanged artillery salvos with the German battleships <a href="../../../g/e/r/German_battlecruiser_Scharnhorst_aec3.html" title="German battlecruiser Scharnhorst"><i>Scharnhorst</i></a> and <a href="../../../g/e/r/German_battlecruiser_Gneisenau_3c14.html" title="German battlecruiser Gneisenau"><i>Gneisenau</i></a>, which were screening the destroyers, causing light damage to <i>Gneisenau</i>. The destroyers' main mission had been completed, however, as they had succeeded in landing the invasion force.</p>

<p>The day after the German invasion, the Royal Navy took an opportunity to defeat the Kriegsmarine. The 2nd Destroyer Flotilla under Commodore <a href="../../../b/e/r/Bernard_Warburton-Lee_83e5.html" title="Bernard Warburton-Lee">Bernard Warburton-Lee</a> comprising six <a href="../../../g/_/a/G_and_H_class_destroyer_1472.html" title="G and H class destroyer">H class destroyers</a> (<a href="../../../h/m/s/HMS_Hardy_%281936%29_71e7.html" title="HMS Hardy (1936)">HMS <i>Hardy</i></a> (flagship), <a href="../../../h/m/s/HMS_Hotspur_%28H01%29_b772.html" title="HMS Hotspur (H01)"><i>Hotspur</i></a>, <a href="../../../h/m/s/HMS_Havock_%28H43%29_a271.html" title="HMS Havock (H43)"><i>Havock</i></a>, <a href="../../../h/m/s/HMS_Hunter_%28H35%29_af6e.html" title="HMS Hunter (H35)"><i>Hunter</i></a> and <a href="../../../h/m/s/HMS_Hostile_%28H55%29_1ef3.html" title="HMS Hostile (H55)"><i>Hostile</i></a> (British <i>H</i> class destroyers were smaller than the German destroyers) moved up the fjord in the early morning. The German picket ship (<i><a href="../../../g/e/r/German_World_War_II_destroyers_02a6.html" title="German World War II destroyers">Diether von Roeder</a></i>) had left its post due to a misunderstanding and, as the British flotilla approached Narvik, they surprised and engaged a German force at the entrance to the harbour and sank two destroyers <i><a href="../../../g/e/r/German_World_War_II_destroyers_02a6.html" title="German World War II destroyers">Wilhelm Heidkamp</a></i> (killing Commodore Bonte) and <i><a href="../../../g/e/r/German_World_War_II_destroyers_02a6.html" title="German World War II destroyers">Anton Schmidt</a></i>, heavily damaged the <i><a href="../../../g/e/r/German_World_War_II_destroyers_02a6.html" title="German World War II destroyers">Diether von Roeder</a></i> and inflicted lesser damage on two others. They also exchanged fire with German invasion troops ashore, but did not have a landing force aboard and therefore turned to leave.</p>
<p>They were then engaged by three more German destroyers (<i>Wolfgang Zenker</i>, <i>Erich Koellner</i> and <i>Erich Giese</i>) emerging from the Herjangsfjord, led by Commander <a href="../../../e/r/i/Erich_Bey_914e.html" title="Erich Bey">Erich Bey</a>, and then two more (<i>Georg Thiele</i> and <i>Bernd von Arnim</i>) coming from Ballangen Bay, under Commander Fritz Berger. In the ensuing battle, two British destroyers were lost: the flotilla leader HMS <i>Hardy</i>, which was beached in flames, and HMS <i>Hunter</i>, which was torpedoed and sank. A third, HMS <i>Hotspur</i>, was also damaged badly by a torpedo. <i>Hotspur</i> and the other remaining British destroyers left the battlefield, damaging <i>Georg Thiele</i> as they did so. The German destroyers, now short of fuel and ammunition, did not pursue and the British ships were able to sink seven German or German-seized transport ships outside Narvik port, including the supply ship <i>Rauenfels</i>. Soon the German naval forces were blocked in by British reinforcements, including the cruiser <a href="../../../h/m/s/HMS_Penelope_%2897%29_d670.html" title="HMS Penelope (97)">HMS <i>Penelope</i></a>. On <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_11.html" title="April 11">11 April</a>, <i>Erich Koellner</i> sustained further damage when it ran onto uncharted rocks.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>As the British destroyers left the <a href="../../../v/e/s/Vestfjord.html" title="Vestfjord">Vestfjord</a> outside Narvik, two German submarines, <i>U-25</i> and <i>U-51</i>, fired torpedoes at them, but German torpedoes at the time had severe problems with their magnetic detonator systems - possibly due to the high northern latitude: all of them failed and either did not detonate at all or detonated well before their targets.</p>
<p>Both the German naval commander, Commodore <a href="../../../f/r/i/Friedrich_Bonte_e646.html" title="Friedrich Bonte">Friedrich Bonte</a> (on <i>Wilhelm Heidkamp</i>), and the British commander, Captain <a href="../../../b/e/r/Bernard_Warburton-Lee_83e5.html" title="Bernard Warburton-Lee">Bernard Warburton-Lee</a> (on <i>Hardy</i>), had been killed in the battle. Warburton-Lee was posthumously awarded the <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victoria_Cross_384d.html" title="Victoria Cross">Victoria Cross</a>, Bonte the <a href="../../../r/i/t/Ritterkreuz.html" title="Ritterkreuz">Knight's Cross</a>.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[3]</a></sup> <sup id="_ref-magweb_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-magweb" title="">[4]</a></sup> <sup id="_ref-bbc_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-bbc" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>

<p>During the opening stages of the battle, a <a href="../../../f/a/i/Fairey_Swordfish_cd82.html" title="Fairey Swordfish">Fairey Swordfish</a> launched from <i>Warspite</i> bombed and sank the German submarine <i>U-64</i>,<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[5]</a></sup> at anchor in a side-fjord near Bjerkvik. Most of the crew survived and were rescued by German mountain troops. This was the first <a href="../../../u/-/b/U-boat.html" title="U-boat">U-boat</a> to be sunk by an aircraft during the Second World War.</p>
<p>In the ensuing battle, three of the German destroyers were sunk by <i>Warspite</i> and her escorts, and the other five were scuttled by their own crews when they ran out of fuel and ammunition. First to go was <i>Erich Koellner</i> which was trying to ambush the Allied forces, but was spotted by <i>Warspite'</i>s Swordfish and subsequently torpedoed and shelled by the destroyers and battleship. Then <i>Wolfgang Zenker</i>, <i>Bernd von Arnim</i>, <i>Hans Ludemann</i> and <i>Hermann Künne</i> engaged the British forces, but only managed to lightly damage <a href="../../../h/m/s/HMS_Bedouin_%28F67%29_3499.html" title="HMS Bedouin (F67)">HMS <i>Bedouin</i></a>. British aircraft from <i>Furious</i> tried to engage the German destroyers but were unsuccessful; two were lost. <i>Wolfgang Zenker</i> unsuccessfully attempted to torpedo <i>Warspite</i>.</p>
<p>Finally, when the German destroyers were low on ammunition, they retreated, except for <i>Hermann Künne</i>, which had not received the order. <i>Hermann Künne</i> was torpedoed and sunk by HMS <i>Eskimo</i>. <i>Eskimo</i> was in turn ambushed by <i>Georg Thiele</i> and <i>Hans Ludemann</i>, losing her bow but surviving. <i>Diether von Roeder</i> and <i>Erich Giese</i>, both suffering engine problems, fired upon the British forces while still docked, damaging <i>Punjabi</i> and <i>Cossack</i>, but they were both sunk before they could cause further damage. That was the last German counter-attack and the remaining German destroyers were scuttled soon after. The only German ship which survived within the port area was the submarine <i>U-51</i>.</p>
<p>Shore batteries and installations were also very badly damaged by <i>Warspite'</i>s guns. On the Allied side, the damage to <a href="../../../h/m/s/HMS_Eskimo_%28F75%29_6b01.html" title="HMS Eskimo (F75)">HMS <i>Eskimo</i></a> kept her in Norway until <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_31.html" title="May 31">31 May</a> 1940.

<p>The Germans lost over 1,000 men and the destroyers <i>Hermann Künne</i>, <i>Wolfgang Zenker</i>, <i>Erich Koellner</i>, <i>Georg Thiele</i>, <i>Bernd von Arnim</i>, <i>Erich Giese</i>, <i>Hans Lüdemann</i> and <i>Diether von Roeder</i>, in addition to <i>U-64</i>. <sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>

After the German destroyers had been sunk, however, about 2600 German sailors joined in the land battle. Another 290 German specialists travelled via Sweden posing as health care workers. During the last 3-4 weeks the Germans were also reinforced by about 1000 men air dropped over Bjørnefjell, thus bringing the total number of Germans to around 5000. Their position and outlook changed from good to dire several times. <a href="../../../h/i/t/Hitler.html" title="Hitler">Hitler</a>'s mood was reportedly swinging heavily and he repeatedly contemplated withdrawal. On occasions, the entire operation was controlled directly from the <a href="../../../o/b/e/Oberkommando_der_Wehrmacht_8bf6.html" title="Oberkommando der Wehrmacht">German High Command</a> in <a href="../../../b/e/r/Berlin.html" title="Berlin">Berlin</a>.</p>
<p>The Norwegian force under General Fleischer eventually reached 8-10,000 men after a few weeks. The total number of Allied troops in the campaign, in and around Narvik, reached 24,500 men.</p>
<p>The early phase of the invasion was marked by the German advantage of surprise. Norwegian troops in northern Norway had been called out on a three month neutrality watch during the winter of 1939/1940 and so they had trained together. During <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_9.html" title="April 9">April 9</a> - 25, the Norwegian forces suffered three catastrophes. First, the forces protecting Narvik were unable to resist the Germans due to the commanding officer, the later <a href="../../../n/a/s/Nasjonal_Samling_8984.html" title="Nasjonal Samling">NS</a> <i>Hird</i> commander Colonel Konrad Sundlo, refusing to fight the invaders; second, around 200 soldiers from the Narvik garrison who had escaped capture and was blocking the railway to Sweden was caught by surprise while resting at Bjørnefjell, most of the men being captured; third, the so-called "Trønder battalion" sent to hold Gratangsbotten was attacked by surprise while in camp, suffering casualties that ruined its spirit and effectively knocked it out of the remainder of the campaign.</p>
<p>Due to mounting Norwegian pressure and difficulties with bringing up supplies to the forward lying troops the Germans abandoned Gratangsbotn and withdrew from Lapphaugen and the Gratang valley, following the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Gratangen_4c04.html" title="Battle of Gratangen">Battle of Gratangen</a>. In the beginning of May, the Norwegians started an advance southwards towards Narvik. Once it became clear that the Allies would mount the main invasion of Narvik itself, in mid May, the Norwegian direction altered towards Bjørnefjell.</p>
<p>The British arrived first and set up headquarters in <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harstad.html" title="Harstad">Harstad</a> on <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_14.html" title="April 14">14 April</a>. In the following days three battalions were deployed mainly at <a href="../../../s/j/%C3%B8/Sj%C3%B8vegan.html" title="Sjøvegan">Sjøvegan</a>, <a href="../../../s/k/%C3%A5/Sk%C3%A5nland.html" title="Skånland">Skånland</a> (where a naval base was established) and at <a href="../../../b/o/g/Bogen%2C_Evenes_f65e.html" title="Bogen, Evenes">Bogen</a>. Later they were deployed south of <a href="../../../o/f/o/Ofotfjord.html" title="Ofotfjord">Ofotfjord</a>, at <a href="../../../b/a/l/Ballangen.html" title="Ballangen">Ballangen</a> and <a href="../../../h/%C3%A5/k/H%C3%A5kvik.html" title="Håkvik">Håkvik</a>. In May most British troops were withdrawn from the Narvik area and redeployed southwards to <a href="../../../n/o/r/Nordland.html" title="Nordland">Nordland</a>, in order to delay the German advance there.</p>
<p>The initial British detachment was reinforced on <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_28.html" title="April 28">28 April</a> by a French expeditionary force, led by General <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antoine_B%C3%A9thouart_6324.html" title="Antoine Béthouart">Antoine Béthouart</a>. Three battalions of Alpine troops and two battalions of <a href="../../../1/3/t/13th_Foreign_Legion_Demi-Brigade_a2d6.html" title="13th Foreign Legion Demi-Brigade">13th Foreign Legion Demi-Brigade</a> were deployed both north and south of the Ofotfjord, but later, the north would be the main French area of operation. Four Polish battalions arrived on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_9.html" title="May 9">9 May</a>. They were first deployed north of the Ofotfjord, but later redeployed to the area south of the fjord. In early June they were formed into the <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polish_Independent_Highland_Brigade_20a2.html" title="Polish Independent Highland Brigade">Polish Independent Highland Brigade</a> under Zygmunt Bohusz-Szyszko.</p>
<p>In addition, the Allies had difficulties in deciding how best to retake Narvik and the iron ore railway. There was no unified Allied command for the troops at Narvik: the Norwegians and the Allies retained separate commanders and cooperation between them was not always smooth. Even within the British forces, the Army and Navy commanders (Major General Pierse J. Mackesy and <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Boyle%2C_12th_Earl_of_Cork_2deb.html" title="William Boyle, 12th Earl of Cork">Admiral William Boyle</a>) had difficulties cooperating: Boyle advocated a swift and direct attack from the sea while Mackesy advocated a cautious approach from both sides of the Ofotfjord. In the end, the British Naval commander, Boyle, was given command of all Allied troops.</p>
<p>In the second week of May, the Norwegian advances against the Germans east of Gratangseidet were the most significant movements on the Narvik front. In addition, on the Norwegian's right flank French alpine troops advanced up the Laberg valley supported a company of Norwegian ski troops. In the south the Allies did not have much success and in the north of the Ofotfjord they were not making any movements. The Norwegians continued their successful mountain campaign and in mid May the Allies took the initiative and achieved the significant victories. Both <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paris.html" title="Paris">Paris</a> and <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a> had been growing impatient with the slow progress in Narvik and the French commander, Béthouart, had pressed for more action.</p>
<p>The cautious approach on land was abandoned and an amphibious attack was launched at around midnight on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_12.html" title="May 12">12 May</a>. This attack was directed at Bjerkvik and was preceded by a naval bombardment from British warships in Herjangsfjord. Then the French Foreign Legioneers were put ashore supported by five light French tanks. The French took Bjerkvik, Elvegårdsmoen and advanced north east to where the Germans were retreating and south along the east side of Herjangsfjord. The plan also required Polish troops to advance towards Bjerkvik from land on the west side of the fjord, but heavy terrain delayed then and they did not arrive before Bjerkvik was taken. It had also been part of the plan for French and Norwegian troops to advance from the north in order to box the Germans in, but cooperation problems between the Norwegian and French commanders left a gap through which the Germans escaped. Despite this, the Allies had a clear path north of Narvik and planned to attack over Rombaksfjord.</p>
<p>Again the attack was stalled while the Allies waited for air support to be fully established from <a href="../../../b/a/r/Bardufoss.html" title="Bardufoss">Bardufoss</a>. At 23:40 on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_28.html" title="May 28">28 May</a> a naval bombardment commenced from the north. Two French and one Norwegian battalion would be transported across the Rombaksfjord and advance on Narvik from the north. In the south the Polish battalllions would advance towards <a href="../../../a/n/k/Ankenes.html" title="Ankenes">Ankenes</a> and inner <a href="../../../b/e/i/Beisfjord.html" title="Beisfjord">Beisfjord</a>. The maximum capacity of the landing barges was 290 men and these troops could not be reinforced for 45 minutes. These first troops were able to get a foothold on Ornes by the time the rest of the French and the Norwegians were landed. The French moved westwards towards the city and eastwards along the railway. The Norwegians moved towards Taraldsvik mountain, circled around and moved down towards the city. The German commander decided to evacuate already before 07:00am and retired along Beisfjord.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>

<p>It seemed now that it was only a matter of time before the Germans would have to surrender. They were pushed from the north by the Norwegians, from the west by the French and from the southwest by the Poles. It looked like Bjørnefjell would be the Germans last stand, but events elsewhere in Europe came to their rescue. London had secretly decided to evacuate already on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_24.html" title="May 24">24 May</a> and that became apparent in the following days. The night of 24/<a href="../../../m/a/y/May_25.html" title="May 25">25 May</a>, Lord Cork received orders to retreat, but under cover so the Germans would be prevented from interfering. The Allied commanders agreed that an attack on Narvik would disguise the retreat and allow the destruction of the iron ore harbour.</p>
<p>The Norwegian government and commanders were first told in early June and the news were met with disbelief and bitterness. The Norwegians still hoped to defeat the Germans alone and, as late as <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_5.html" title="June 5">5 June</a>, one of the two Norwegian brigades was ordered to attack. The Norwegian government also explored the possibility of creating a neutral, but free Northern Norway. This plan was futile and on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_7.html" title="June 7">7 June</a> the King and government were evacuated to Britain. All Allied troops were evacuated from Narvik between <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_4.html" title="June 4">4 June</a> and <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_8.html" title="June 8">8 June</a> 1940.<sup id="_ref-magweb_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-magweb" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>

On <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_8.html" title="June 8">8 June</a>, General Dietl retook Narvik and on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_10.html" title="June 10">10 June</a> the last Norwegian forces in Norway surrendered.</p>

<p>On <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_7.html" title="June 7">June 7</a>, the British aircraft carrier <i><a href="../../../h/m/s/HMS_Glorious_64dc.html" title="HMS Glorious">HMS Glorious</a></i>, had taken on board 10 <a href="../../../g/l/o/Gloster_Gladiators_4340.html" title="Gloster Gladiators">Gloster Gladiators</a> and 8 <a href="../../../h/a/w/Hawker_Hurricane_7bea.html" title="Hawker Hurricane">Hawker Hurricanes</a> from No 46 Squadron RAF and No 263 Squadron Royal Air Force,. These were flown off from land bases to keep them from being destroyed in the evacuation. <i>Glorious</i> left a larger <a href="../../../c/o/n/Convoy.html" title="Convoy">convoy</a> to proceed independently. The next day, while transiting through the <a href="../../../n/o/r/Norwegian_Sea_329c.html" title="Norwegian Sea">Norwegian Sea</a> to return to <a href="../../../s/c/a/Scapa_Flow_fccf.html" title="Scapa Flow">Scapa Flow</a>, the carrier and her two escorts, the destroyers <a href="../../../h/m/s/HMS_Acasta_%28H09%29_5664.html" title="HMS Acasta (H09)"><i>HMS Acasta</i></a> and <a href="../../../h/m/s/HMS_Ardent_%28H41%29_4e29.html" title="HMS Ardent (H41)"><i>HMS Ardent</i></a>, were intercepted by the German battlecruisers <a href="../../../g/e/r/German_battlecruiser_Scharnhorst_aec3.html" title="German battlecruiser Scharnhorst"><i>Scharnhorst</i></a> and <i><a href="../../../g/e/r/German_battlecruiser_Gneisenau_3c14.html" title="German battlecruiser Gneisenau">Gneisenau</a></i>. Both the carrier and her escorts were sunk with the loss of more than 1,500 men.</p>
<p>The <i>Scharnhorst</i> was badly damaged by a torpedo from <i>Acasta</i>, and both German vessels took a number of medium shell hits. The damage to the German ships was sufficient to cause the Germans to retire to <a href="../../../t/r/o/Trondheim.html" title="Trondheim">Trondheim</a>, which allowed the safe passage of the evacuation convoy through the area later that day.<sup id="_ref-magweb_3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-magweb" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/t/Battles_of_Narvik_8ce9.html" title="Edit section: Aftermath">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Aftermath</span></h2>
<p>The Allied offensive started slowly. Unlike the Germans, they did not have a clear operational objective in Norway and therefore did not steer their operation with as much decisiveness. The British had drafted plans to land in Narvik before the German invasion and troops and supplies had even been loaded onto ships when they executed their mining operation on <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_8.html" title="April 8">8 April</a>. These had been hastily unloaded when German ships were spotted northbound. The British thought that the German ships were trying to break into the Atlantic to avoid being trapped in German ports. Following this rationale, they wanted all their own ships available to intercept the German fleet. The consequent confusion would dog the troops for weeks: troops and <a href="../../../m/a/t/Materiel.html" title="Materiel">materiel</a> were shipped to Norway separately without clear landing sites and orders were changed while en route. It was as if the Allies were confused by the many small and large fjords and bays and could not decide where it would be best to start. In addition, British, French and Polish units would rapidly relieve each other.</p>
<p>The cold and snow was a common enemy for all troops at Narvik, but most of the Allies were poorly prepared for it. The Norwegians were the only ones fully equipped with skis and able to use them. The British attempted to use skis, but their troops were largely untrained and supply was scarce. German sailors faced the same problems. Even within the <a href="../../../g/e/b/Gebirgsj%C3%A4ger.html" title="Gebirgsjäger">German</a> and French mountain specialists, only a few units were equipped with skis.</p>
<p>Most troops were untested in battle. The <a href="../../../g/e/b/Gebirgsj%C3%A4ger.html" title="Gebirgsjäger">German mountain specialists</a> had participated in the invasion of Poland and some of the troops that had been air dropped over Bjørnefjell had fought in the <a href="../../../n/e/t/Netherlands.html" title="Netherlands">Netherlands</a>. Some of the French Foreign Legioneers came directly from fighting in <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_Africa_6a9e.html" title="North Africa">North Africa</a> and some Polish officers had participated in the defence of Poland.</p>
<p>The allies had sea and air superiority until the very last stage of the operation, but did not take full advantage of that.</p>
<p>The Germans lost the naval battle, but achieved the main goal of their operation - the successful invasion and occupation of Norway.</p>
<p>Around Narvik, German naval losses were high: they lost 10 destroyers (half of their entire destroyer force), one submarine and several support ships. In exchange, they sunk two British destroyers and damaged several others. The reason for this defeat lay in the German plans which made it impossible for the destroyers to retire quickly, even if they had had adequate supplies. This was compounded by the design of German destroyers, despite their relatively large size and armament they had inadequate fuel and ammunition storage.</p>
<p>On the other hand, British forces, while achieving an indisputable local naval victory, were unprepared to follow it up with any land operation. This allowed the Germans to consolidate their occcupation of Norway and made the subsequent Allied counter invasion more difficult.</p>
