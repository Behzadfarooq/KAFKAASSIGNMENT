<p>Not really. Trauma got quite a lot of money when Dice bought them, and all employees have been offered jobs in Stockholm. After all, Dice had no obligation to buy Trauma in the first place.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Game reviews</span></h2>
<p>Seems to me like a lot of the best parts of what made Battlefield 1942 (and also Vietnam) fun were excised for this sequel. You can't have a small number of players on a huge map anymore. Extras that added to the sandbox feel, like jet packs and other arcade style power-ups are gone, replaced with an Enemy Territory sort of system. The function key menu is gone, replaced with a console style radial menu. You can't honk the horns of the cars, or use the radios to play music as in BF:V.</p>
<p>The backstory is also far less immersive, and even creepy. It was already somewhat disturbing to reenact actual battles of history. The near-future scenario that Battlefield 2 posits is many times more unsettling.</p>
<p>There is not enough fun to weigh against the competitive elements, and it seems to have been designed for the hard core pro gamer and a league play environment. You could never say that about Battlefield 1942, which was both easy to learn for newcomers and fun for experts.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<ul>
<li>You can, in fact, honk the horn of light vehicles. And personally, I never played BF1942 or BFV, and I think BF2 was quite easy to learn. /Wik-E</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>That and...You can too have a small amount of player (you set the player limit in the server options), and the sandbox feel wasn't what they were going for [more realisitc]. I like the radial menu more, you can honk the horns of cars, and why would you <i>want</i> to annoy your teammates with music?</li>

<p>Is anyone going to write a section on gameplay? And the bad taste the current TK system leaves in players minds?</p>

<li>The textbook response to that statement is to "be bold", go ahead and do it! I've started it off, perhaps some people will add to it later.--<a href="../../../i/n/k/User%7EInkypaws_784e.html" title="User:Inkypaws">inks</a> 05:35, 29 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Does anyone find it annoying that you get punished for TKs that other players caused (aside from blatant bugs)? Such as,
<ul>
<li>running in front of a moving tank or vehicle,</li>
<li>running under a landing helocopter,</li>
<li>walking into claymores or driving over AT mines,</li>
<li>two vehicles colliding (team-team or enemy-team, e.g. if you crash you can get a TK for a passenger),</li>
<li>sprinting Rambo-style into an enemy group while teammates are firing at the enemy group? -- <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBeastRHIT_ade6.html" title="User:BeastRHIT">BeastRHIT</a> 16:26, 29 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">So many external links</span></h2>
<p>Do we need so many links to so many mods? Couldnt we trim that huge list down to several popular mods? Seems like blatant advertising to me. <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnouymous_e41c.html" title="User:Anouymous">Anouymous</a> 05:19, 29 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Im gonna begin trimming links one week for now if noone objects; primarily, Im gonna remove most of the fansites and most of the mods, probably taking out all mods except for Shattered Faith. If anyone has objections post here. <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnouymous_e41c.html" title="User:Anouymous">Anouymous</a> 03:36, 30 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Hmmm. Not so much advertising, as it's nothing more than a link, plus it illustrates the point that the game is very moddable, plus indicative of the games large following. I would not have found out about many of those mods if they were not listed here. I'd be strongly in favour of keeping them all for now, and perhaps removing only those that have clearly stagnated, say in a few months time. What think you, <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnouymous_e41c.html" title="User:Anouymous">Anouymous</a>?--<a href="../../../i/n/k/User%7EInkypaws_784e.html" title="User:Inkypaws">inks</a> 03:44, 30 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I'd rather have an additional page with the mod listing than removing then. For one thing it is a good source for information at the moment and second it is not possible to say which mod will become popular because nothing has yet been released (setting aside mini mods like the night thingy). <a href="../../../j/e/a/User%7EJeanJoswig_fb52.html" title="User:JeanJoswig">User:JeanJoswig</a></li>

<li>Sure, its just that its looking a bit cluttered. How do you feel about the external links? No need to have links to some of those such as that fan discussion one regardeing expansions and such. But soon, at least by expansion time we should clear out some of these mod links. But how do you feel about those external links? Ill put the ones I disagree with 04:29, 30 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>actually looking at some of the links, they justify removing. Some dont even exist anymore, and some latest works date 6 months ago</li>
<li>So I deleted most of the links. Here was my reasoning. Some sites did not even exist anymore. Others had news dating from back in May and such. My criteria for deleting was that if a update was not dated to at least september, and the forum was not active, I would remove it from the list. Of course, it created a formatting nightmare, so someone needs to do that. Also, I removed some links to dead websites and such. <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnouymous_e41c.html" title="User:Anouymous">Anouymous</a> 02:58, 5 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Picture is not a screenshot</span></h2>
<p>The picture is a promotional image, created artificially and probably touched up. Why not get a couple gameplay screenshots?

<p>I think there is some touch but the most on picture is real gameplay screenshot. By the way, why did you think that that was created artificially?

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Black Hawk</span></h2>
<p>Uh, my edit that there are Black Hawk(UH-60) in Battlefield 2 was deleted. But I think there were Black Hawk in Gulf of Oman Map. When I kill someone by that transport helicopter, it surely shows that I killed by Black Hawk like Izumi5[Black Hawk]XXX. Is there a mistake, isn't it? Official Site in US shows there are Sea Hawk, but in JPN, there are Black Hawk, not Sea Hawk. You can see it by clicking the same position that ARMIES is located in US official site. Next, click Stars and Stripes, Jet-shaped silhouette, and click Right Arrow for a few times. Then you'll see the picture of Transport Helicopter, and you also see that the top of descripition shows Helicopter is UH-60(Black Hawk). <a href="../../../i/z/u/User%7EIzumi5_da0e.html" title="User:Izumi5">Izumi5</a> 17:53, 30 September 2005 (JST)</p>
<ul>
<li>I put the Black Hawk in the artical a while back and it was removed. While playing the game says that the US transport helo is a Black Hawk. The EA website says Sea Hawk as the title, but in the artical it uses Black Hawk. The Sea Hawk is a special Black Hawk packaged for the Marines. From the pictures that I have seen, the helo in the game more closely resembles a Black Hawk. --<a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBeastRHIT_ade6.html" title="User:BeastRHIT">BeastRHIT</a> 21:02, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>I've reverted the page after a deletion by <a href="../../../a/b/e/User%7EAbelson_89f2.html" title="User:Abelson">User:Abelson</a>. Specifically, an external link to a large and heavily-debated PlanetBattlefield forum post entitled "Why I support the idea of an expansion boycott" which discusses the community's reaction to Electronic Art's announcement of an expansion pack despite many outstanding technical and gameplay balance issues currently plaguing the game. I don't believe this link violates NPOV -- since many, many articles on Wikipedia feature sections listing criticism or opposing positions of the topic at hand -- and given the amount of participation in said discussion it isn't just "junk" as the previous article editor claimed.</p>
<p>If we're going to list a multitude of external commercial sites as well as softball interviews with the development team, we should include links to something that better reflects the attitude of the player community as well.

<dd>Odd. I based my edit on the fact that the rank had disappeared with from the BF2S ranks page (<a href="http://ubar.bf2s.com/ranks.php" class="external free" title="http://ubar.bf2s.com/ranks.php" rel="nofollow">http://ubar.bf2s.com/ranks.php</a>) but it seems to have returned, although doesn't seem to have any solid requirements. All the above linked profiles are 2nd Lieutenant, this can be found by viewing their profile in-game (so I reckon the reason they displayed on Paradroid as SMOTC was because Paradroid had not updated correctly), so I am not sure if there are any players who currently hold this rank. If any of the above players did have this rank it would have been for an extremely short time before advancing to 2nd Lieutenant which kind of defeats the purpose of it. - <a href="../../../j/u/i/User%7EJuice%5E_734e.html" title="User:Juice^">Juice</a> 05:25, 30 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

I think the demo section is warranted, as it is quite short, and is a commonly used part of the game by people who want to try it out before they purchase it. As for the bugs, I recently cut it down because most of them were just pet peeves of people (eg. teamkilling).

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Bugs</span></h2>
<p>The '<a href="../../../b/a/t/Battlefield_2.html#Bugs" title="Battlefield 2">Bugs</a>' Section in the article states "Battlefield 2 suffered from several serious bugs at release", with the partial exception of the last bug, no mention is made of whether these bugs still exist in the game at its current version (1.03 I believe). Does the past tense signify that these bugs have been resolved?</p>
<p>Also, no mention of the approximate frequency of these bugs is mentioned.</p>
<ul>
<li>The list is also frightfully short. There are numerous bugs still present (as of patch 1.03) in-game, using the server browser, and even during installation of the patch. The most prevalent and annoying of the bugs I've encountered thus far is the "unmodified content" error received when joining servers (requires a complete reinstall of the game! even if you don't in fact have modified content!). It should definitely be included in the list. --Criftus 21:10, 19 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The list of bugs is very subjective and informal, and needs to be rewritten. Also, punishing is not a bug in itself, even if people disagree with it. <a href="../../../r/e/m/User%7ERem120_9953.html" title="User:Rem120">Remy B</a> 12:49, 24 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>I agree. Another bug that is a major problem is the 'Debug assertion failed', generally because a file cannot be found, even though the game has not been modified in any way (other than patching). Also there could be a similar section for network bugs, such as crashes with the stats server. --<a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESpark.1.4_a51b.html" title="User:Spark.1.4">Spark.1.4</a> 05:50, 7 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Is it appropriate for the bug talking about the server bumping people off to say "The server will sometimes break your connection for seemingly no reason whatsoever. Whether this is actually a bug or just bad netcode is unknown to the editor." Because to me, it doesnt seem like this is verifiable and i want to delete it.

<p>You can probably delete that addition, as it is still unknown to be a bug, and without proof, it can't be added. It is probably just bad netcode. On the other hand, I have noticed that Rem120 has put a comment in the Bugs section to those who will be editing in the future. He says that we must have proof and verifiable sources. From what I have seen, 4 of the bugs do not have a link to proof or any list of verifiable sources, so if what he is saying is true, all of them should be removed except the one that has a link. I am just slightly annoyed at this since he removed 2 of my additions to the bugs section supposedly because they had no proof. One of them did not at all yet, so he did have justification to remove it, although the 2nd one I added has been witnessed as many times (if not more) than most of the other bugs, and should not need proof, especially considering 4 of them do not have any at all (in case any of you noticed it, it is the bug about players being pushed off rooftops). Any thoughts on this? <a href="../../../d/u/d/User%7EDudewheresmypizz4_9ccc.html" title="User:Dudewheresmypizz4">Dudewheresmypizz4</a> 15:05, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I agree that it wasnt very consistent of me to leave in the bugs that have been listed for a long time, since they also do not have sources. I am seriously considering removing the section if I am not reasonably easily able to find verifiable sources for the bugs that are on there. The whole section reeks of original research (<a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>) and takes up way more proportion of the article than seems justifiable. If every little BF2 bug should have a place on Wikipedia, I would probably suggest making a separate article for it, in a similar way to what has already been done with ranks and vehicles. <a href="../../../r/e/m/User%7ERem120_9953.html" title="User:Rem120">Remy B</a> 08:24, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><a name="Player_Complaints" id="Player_Complaints"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">Player Complaints</span></h2>
<p>Do to the overwhelming fact that many gamers have been turned away from the game, it is appropriate to list general complaints users have. The major initial complaints have been addressed by Electronic Arts in patches, but many other still remain.</p>
<p>The worst of which is the now infamous "Punish" system. All players can excersize a form of "control" where they can choose to punish or not to punish another player after being tked (team killed) by them. Note: players do not have to have administrative priveledges to do this. This system, which is a great thought, has become an abusive way for players to seek revenge, or be inconsiderate to other players. (e.g. Player1 and Player2 run to an airplane to pilot it. Player1 gets there first. Player2 then stands underneath the airplane so he/she is team killed by Player1 and can therefore punish them. This results in -4 points for P1 and if P1 is punished a few more times they will be kick/banned from the server.) This irrational way of hurting others is not at all rare, and is most likely the greatest complaint players still have with this game.</p>
<p>Other complaints include server specific rules. Remeber that Battlefield 2 and the Special Forces expansion are rated T for teen by the ESRB. The most common complaint from users is that their first amendment right to self-expression is denied on most servers. Some players have yet to find a server that follows the principal of constitutional rights (this is based off of the US constitution). While servers are under no obligation to allow these rights because they do not fall under any legal jurisdiction with them, it is still a common complaint in that little to no servers allow them.</p>
<p>Common server rules include: Respect the Admins. No stats padding, team killing, fowl/abusive language, threats/harrassment, or racism.</p>
<p>Many other complaints are of the objectivity of these rules. Correction, <i>lack</i> of objectivity in these rules. It is impossible to know when one violates a rule because there are no standards, and many players have complaints about this. (e.g. The server message says, "mature players only", but then you are kicked or banned for the use of fowl language) This example would be referred to as <i>deception</i>, but most server administrators and hosts do not seem to care.</p>
<p>Other complaints include those universal to gaming, such as admin abuse, "smack-tards", and lag. The afformentioned complaints appear to be greater for Battlefield 2 and the Special Forces expansion then other games in the First Person Shooter genre.</p>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>If you teamkill on a punish system server or not, you are punished with a -4 score penalty. If the player punishes you, all it does is gets you closer to a kick/ban. The server sets how many punishes you need in order to be kicked. Being punished by another play does not mean you recieve a score penalty, or else if it did, stat padders would TK friends and revieve them and get away scott free from the score penalty if the friend didn't punish.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Some servers auto-kick players who punish too much, and forgive too little. Everytime you punish, it is broadcasted in the top-left hand corner in green text. If the server isn't on auto-kick, then an Admin can kick you for punishing too much. It's a good way to get rid of smacktards to punish for accidents or force other players to TK them ie. run your jeep into a friendly tank and die, lay in front of a jet taking off, walking into friendly fire, grenades, etc.--<a href="../../../h/e/l/User%7EHellogoodsir_0047.html" title="User:Hellogoodsir">Hellogoodsir</a> 05:23, 8 April 2006 (UTC) (forgot to sign sorry)</dd>

<dd>I agree, they are mostly redundant too. Its very hard to find a balance between everyone just putting any old link on they want to promote and listing sites that are genuinely unique and contain a lot of additional material.

<p>Hey, I think a good link to add would be www.bf2s.com Not only is it a significant Battlefield 2 community, but it is designed so that you can look up your stats while outside of the game itself. It also provides many stats that are not available in-game at the "BFHQ", such as how many times you have been kicked/banned, teamkills, damages, and one of it's most unique features is that it calculates an estimated time until your next rank, award, etc. Additionally, www.bf2s.com boasts an impressive "wiki" (Which actually isn't a wiki because it's not open-source) where you can see the exact accuracy, damage, etc. of any weapon straight from the BF2 editor. It also shows similar statistics for vehicles. It has very little advertising. Check it out yourself, I think it's a very valuable site. Be sure to check out your stats and the wiki.</p>

It all depends on what the publisher deems it to be. In this case, EA decided to call it an expansion pack.69.137.201.70 15:15, 22 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Form what EA has said the booster pack is alot smaller and less expensive than the expansion adding just a few new weapons and vehicles, I am not sure if it adds any new maps.</p>
<p><br />
It does add maps.</p>
<p>Expansion packs with EA (in BF2 case) seems to add a lot more functionality and change.</p>
<p>Booster packs are like add-on maps that a lot of suppliers would send for free</p>

<p>I think the bugs section needs to be deleted, there are no sources to anything that can verify any of these claims and they all seem to be just something that annoyed the person who added it that day. This isn't the place to complain about glitches in games that may not even be glitches and hope the patch team of EA just happens to take a break form thier work to look at the wikipedia article to see if someone has a complaint.

<p>You may have a point, however, that was a stub article made, not to complain about various problems associated with the game, but simply to make those problems or bugs known and to inform others. My geuss is that you both are simply more annoyed users who believe that the game should be left entirely unexposed, but that's just me. When I originally made the article, its purpose was to expose the bugs and glitches in the game, not to complain about them. If someone DID make a change that attempted to complain about a problem, or if you believed my original input had the purpose of complaint, next time please attempt to fix it so that it can be read as a neutral view-point, instead of deleting it. I may or may not attempt to remake a stub article related to the one that was deleted, and if I do, I will try even harder to keep it as neutral as possible for informative purposes, as well as to include more supportive proof and evidence. As for much of the Battlefield 2 article, many things in it do not have links to evidence or supporting information, especially the Easter Eggs section, so perhaps we should delete that too? I do not condone the deletion of that section, as I'm sure all of it is true, however the same can be said for the Bugs and Exploits article that was deleted. Much of it is not proven, but many know that the bugs mentioned in it existed, therefore it is not "Original Research", and that should have worked, considering it was accepted for the Easter Eggs section. If you are worried about the sources of the input, then when I get around to remaking this article, I will be sure to include screenshots, links to other valid sites that may have screenshots or other valid proof that these bugs and "secrets" existed, or I will try to make other evidence more readily available. Yes, many of these problems have been fixed in the recent patch of the game, but if I find any more bugs, I will be sure to take a screenshot, or a movie, and include it in the article, if and when I get around to making it. I originally made the article simply to be interesting and informative, not to complain about the items I mentioned. Sorry if this comment was over the top, but I have the right to defend my work don't I?

<p>Second, I want to point out that automatically deleting any external link is wrong. It's a violation of the policy WP:AGF, and that section needs to be removed. Assume good faith with the links. If there is a problem, revert the edit. If there are further problems, take it up through normal channels. But, automatically deleting every link that is added is against Wikipedia policy, and I'm considering removing that comment on the article page. <a href="../../../s/w/a/User%7ESwatjester_64b9.html" title="User:Swatjester">Swatjester</a> 09:04, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The reason I do it is because the external links section is heavily abused by people simply wanting publicity.

I re-read the entries more carefully and its purely original research, which is something we have to constantly fight in this article (if anyone remembers the now-defunct bugs section).

<dd>Yes, it's my fault, I probably should have deleted it when I saw it there.

EA/DICE built a Python engine into the game specifically so the game community could use it to develop mods and new game play modes, but then they never released any documentation on how it worked or the relevent APIs. The community at the Tech Info Wiki has worked all the details out, and as far as I know, this is the only place information on programming the BF2 Python engine is available anywhere on the internet, and gets heavy use from mod developers. I think it's relevent to the Wikipedia article--indeed, I'd like to add some comments to the main article regarding how BF2 is one of the very few games that is controllable using a very high level language like Python--but I don't then want the supporting external link to get deleted again.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Easter eggs</span></h2>
<p>This section of the article has gone out of control with claims that have no sources or citations. I also think that the definition of an 'easter egg' is being stretched very wide - some of them are clearly just novelty parts of the game (like Stalin's face) or just normal parts (like the bunkers that happen to be the same model as in BF1942), rather than hidden parts (like the fish and bear boxes). Personally these are the ones I would like to keep (if I can find sources): fish boxes, bear boxes, crop circles and Dice cream. What are other peoples thoughts on this section? <a href="../../../r/e/m/User%7ERem120_9953.html" title="User:Rem120">Remy B</a> 05:11, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Agreed: many of the items listed as easter eggs are just details, assuming they exist in the first place. The Dice references (dice cream, T-shirts, headsets) aren't hidden, and therefore in my opinion they don't qualify as easter eggs either. I suggest deleting them all except the fish boxes, bear boxes, crop circles, and maybe the coins. <a href="../../../b/c/a/User%7EBcasterline_8fb5.html" title="User:Bcasterline">bcasterline</a> <a href="../../../b/c/a/User_talk%7EBcasterline_273f.html" title="User talk:Bcasterline">t</a> 05:24, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I added that explosives such as C4 will kill fish and bring them to the surface in any of the murky waters in Songhua Stalemate. It might not be considered an easter egg, even if so, it is meaningless as it doesn't seem to work no more. Maybe I'm not doing it right.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">This article needs a serious overhaul.</span></h2>
<p>A "gameplay" section should be put in place of the features section to actually describe the gameplay, instead of advertising most of its features. Also, most the easter eggs in this game are not so significant. Also, the "maps" section should clearly divide themselves between Special Forces maps, EF maps, and vanilla maps. Also, system requirements needs to be moved back towards the beginning of the article, as placing towards the end seems rather odd. Among other things. I don't have this game yet, and I won't be getting this game till at least June, so, thus. - <a href="../../../x/x/5/User%7EXX55XX_7f22.html" title="User:XX55XX">XX55XX</a> 21:46, 26 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As a qualification, I dont agree that the article is entirely structurally broken and needs a concerted cleanup. The article has had many many edits, and it has taken a lot of revising to get it where it is now. For that reason I dont agree that we need the cleanup tag on the full article - I realise it is far from perfect, but that is the nature of a wiki, where there is always room for improvement. I would ask that the cleanup tag not be placed back into the article until there is an obvious consensus of editors that it really does need a proper overhaul. <a href="../../../r/e/m/User%7ERem120_9953.html" title="User:Rem120">Remy B</a> 10:48, 27 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The 'New features' list certainly needs an overhaul. The name itself is fairly misleading, as it doesnt say what the features are new compared to (although I assume it is BF1942), and the fact that the game might not even be considered new anymore. The features list should really just be a paragraph or two of text, without sounding so marketing-like. The separate articles are a problem, but then again so is having an enormous main article. I would prefer it all in the one article, but the content would have to be cut down a lot. For example, the list of awards and ranks could be put in the main article if it was a concise table of smaller images with just the name of the award (the award requirements are quite unnecessary). I would rather not see an exhaustive list of weapons and vehicles in the main article because the information is barely notable, and takes up a hell of a lot of space. I think the ordering of the sections needs reconsidering, as there are heaps of specific details on the expansion packs before there is barely any information on the main game itself. The article also lacks sources for pretty much any of its claims, which means there is no way for people to trust the information that is presented. I would like to see [citation needed] tags placed on the unsourced claims (made with {{fact}} template tags), even if that means they are all throughout the article. <a href="../../../r/e/m/User%7ERem120_9953.html" title="User:Rem120">Remy B</a> 16:22, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
