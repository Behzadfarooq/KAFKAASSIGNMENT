<dd><i>"The most astonishing part of the story is not the numbers who died or were forced to surrender but the 25,000 soldiers and several thousand civilians who succeeded it getting through three lines of Soviet troops</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>In the above quote Beevor mentions "three lines of soviet troops". But his text is a bit hazy as to what they were, I would guess that the ran along the three of the four main north south roads which he shows on as a map in his book on page xxv the first two of which he mentions in passing with the fighting in the text:</p>
<ol>
<li>Berlin-Dresden autobahn</li>
<li>Strasse 96, between Zossen and Mark</li>
<li>Strasse 101, North of Lucenwalde</li>
<li>Strasse 2, between Elsholz and Beelitz</li>
</ol>
<p>Can anyone else confirm from another source where these soviet lines were. I would guess he meant the first three roads but I do not want to put a guess into the article&#160;:-) Secondly his text does not mention what happened around Strasse 101 which would be a nice to have in this article. --<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Baird_Shearer_a81d.html" title="User:Philip Baird Shearer">Philip Baird Shearer</a> 13:09, 12 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Regarding Strasse 101, according to le Tissier there was a Soviet blocking position there, where troops attempting to break out had to run a gauntlet of fire (is that the correct expression). But it does not appear that a pitched battle occurred there. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndreas1968_bd6b.html" title="User:Andreas1968">Andreas</a> 15:01, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Rather than argue this further today I intend to edit the rest of the article and once we have that stabalized then we can discuss this further. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Baird_Shearer_a81d.html" title="User:Philip Baird Shearer">Philip Baird Shearer</a></p>
<p>The article now seems to be stable so I intend to re-insert the Roman numerals for German Armies because:</p>
<ul>
<li>I think it makes it easier to identify the which side the army belongs, in the text.</li>
<li>The convention of using Roman Numerals for the German Army is quite common in English books.</li>
<li>The actual <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28military_units%29_25ce.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (military units)">proposed guideline</a> recommends using words as in <a href="../../../g/e/r/German_Ninth_Army_49dc.html" title="German Ninth Army">German Ninth Army</a> so there is no particular reason to use 12th over XII, other than familiarity for some editors.</li>
<li>If we were dealing with German Armies which had Roman numerals which were not easy to translate or looked clumsy eg XXXXVIII, then rejecting them on practical grounds or esthetics would make more sense but IX and XII are numbers on a clock face and familiar to most.</li>
<li>In this article we are using Arabic numerals for Soviet corps while the guidelines recommend using Roman numerals for corps. I approve of this as it helps to distinguish them from German Corps, in the same way as XII and IX help to distinguish German and Soviet armies.</li>
</ul>

<dl>
<dd>Could we not better use the device that Ziemke is using in 'Moscow to Stalingrad', namely to Italicise the Soviet (or German) Army numbers, or to write them out? Having Roman numerals for German armies is really grating on my eyes, and it makes it much more difficult to distinguish between Armies and Corps. Finally I know of nobody who is using this device in the serious military history literature - if you do, please provide the information. So I am quite against it. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndreas1968_bd6b.html" title="User:Andreas1968">Andreas</a> 13:18, 6 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>You preference is to use "12. Armee" so how can "XII Army" be any more grating than "12th Army" for you? Also are you suggesting that we should designate all Soviet corps with Roman numerals? If not why not? --<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Baird_Shearer_a81d.html" title="User:Philip Baird Shearer">Philip Baird Shearer</a> 13:50, 6 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>12. Armee is the correct German term, and since I am a German native speaker it is not looking wrong to me, even if it is part of an English text. I do understand and accept it is different for English speakers, and will change the way I number German armies to reflect that. XII Army looks wrong (grates) because Roman numerals are for Corps, not Armies. I have no strong feelings about the use of Roman numerals for Soviet Corps. I usually prefer to use the correct historical designation, and to use formatting to ensure that the difference can be seen. But as I said, I would be happy either way for the Soviet corps. If a Russian military expert came along giving reasons why that was totally wrong I may change my mind. I also would like to find an acceptable solution here that can be applied across a range of articles, not just this one. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndreas1968_bd6b.html" title="User:Andreas1968">Andreas</a> 14:07, 6 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>last days -- depends what you think the battle of Halbe was but I take it to be the breakout. It's begining is clear but the end of the battle is not described in detail in Beevor, if you have another source which states when the breakout ended, then we can use that.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>I am using le Tissier, according to him it ended on the 1 May. This is confirmed both by German eyewitness accounts, and by the 1st UF report to Moscow. After 1 May the question for the escapees was on how to get to the Elbe.

<dd>Ah! Maybe a Russian native speaker should weigh in on this one - it is my understanding that the convention is to refer to the Russian names with both first names shortened.

<li>Three Soviet fronts did not attack on the 16th only 2 did, I don't think all the detail is necessary, also 1UF attacked over the Neisse.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>2nd BF attacked on either the 19th (Glantz) or 20th (le Tissier), and was part of the Berlin Operation, so I would leave them in the entry para. You are right about the attack across the Neisse, my mistake.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>I think it is best to translate Generaloberst as General. Colonel-General if you must but it sounds like something out of a B movie about the Cold War.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Colonel-General then - the problem is that 'General' was a separate rank (as in 'General der Infanterie') below Generaloberst.
<dl>
<dd>But the rank does not exist in the English speaking world so IMHO translating it as General is better than translating it into a rank that does not exist. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Baird_Shearer_a81d.html" title="User:Philip Baird Shearer">Philip Baird Shearer</a>
<dl>
<dd>That leaves us with a wrong rank. I am not very happy about that. Ziemke (IIRC) and Glantz, as well as many others, use Colonel-General, although Glantz is a bit more variable about it. So I think it is fair to argue that while not existing in the English-speaking world, the rank is being translated quite regularly in works on WW2. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndreas1968_bd6b.html" title="User:Andreas1968">Andreas</a> 15:34, 1 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Ok then put it in with the first one linked to <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colonel_General_2426.html" title="Colonel General">Colonel General</a> so native speakers will be able to follow the link to see what the rank is. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Baird_Shearer_a81d.html" title="User:Philip Baird Shearer">Philip Baird Shearer</a>

<dd>You have to add V Corps guns, but I think that it is unlikely to reach 1,000 guns. You have to remember though that the 1,000 includes mortars above 76mm if counted by the Soviet method (which I think it was), but the 744 by Ziemke probably won't include that.

<dd>I don't think it has anything to do with historian quality, but simply with the sources. Ziemke does not give his, but it is likely he uses German army records.

<p>V Corps, which was a part of 9th Army by the time of the Battle of Halbe, suffered its losses during the Neisse battles, so it maybe best to say something like 'losses suffered during the opening stages of the Battle of Berlin', or sumfink. What do you think? <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndreas1968_bd6b.html" title="User:Andreas1968">Andreas</a> 20:19, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The IX was chewed up on the Seelow Heights, V Corps was not so badly damaged. V Corps was north of the main 1UF attack. That it still existed as a Corps is evidence of that! This complication is mentioned in the text but there is to date no mention of what the IX was doing before the start of the Battle of Halbe. For this reason I think the text should include the Seelow Heights where most of the IX had been concentrated and destroyed by Zukov, rather than a bolt on Corps who's arrival is already explained in this text.<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Baird_Shearer_a81d.html" title="User:Philip Baird Shearer">Philip Baird Shearer</a> 20:47, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I would prefer to leave the original sentence in, since according to le Tissier the air supply was attempted (i.e. supplies were loaded onto planes and the planes took off). It failed because they could not locate the drop point and no supply from the planes to the ground could be established. It was therefore not complete fantasy at this stage of the war. There are also reports of air attacks by German planes on Soviet formations during the battle. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndreas1968_bd6b.html" title="User:Andreas1968">Andreas</a> 14:56, 5 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If the Germans did not have the air-transport to support the 6th Army during the Battle of Stalingrad. They sure did not have anything like the air-transport capability needed to support an Army Group in the last few days of the war. --<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Baird_Shearer_a81d.html" title="User:Philip Baird Shearer">Philip Baird Shearer</a> 16:01, 5 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>The two battles and the aim of the air supply are not comparable. In 9th army's case it was to bring them some minor supplied to help them to break out, in 6th Army it was to allow them to stay put and survive the winter. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndreas1968_bd6b.html" title="User:Andreas1968">Andreas</a> 16:06, 5 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>As I said when I removed it, it is misleading. What possible supplies could the transports have delivered which would have made any difference to the outcome of the breakout? It implies that the Germans still had enough air transport and specialised materiel to make a difference. They did not. --<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Baird_Shearer_a81d.html" title="User:Philip Baird Shearer">Philip Baird Shearer</a> 16:45, 5 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think the interesting point that warrants inclusion is that they actually attempted it, less than three weeks before the war ended, and that it did not fail because of enemy interference.

<p>I don't think that the commands issued by Hitler are particularly relevent. Like the idea that there was going to be an airdrop to support the army group, it mixes up wishful thinking by the German high command with the reality of the situation. I think both tend to muddy this article rather than clarify it by giving the illusion that the Germans were more in control of events than they were. However if you think it important I won't remove it.</p>

<dd>OKH was no longer functional, following the move north by Rybalko's tank army that overran Zossen. All reports were made directly to the Fuehrerbunker (not OKW). 12th Army was under Army Group Vistula, so while it had contact it reported to Heinrici, who then reported to the Fuehrerbunker. C&amp;C had become de-institutionalised in those final days. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndreas1968_bd6b.html" title="User:Andreas1968">Andreas</a> 19:13, 6 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Either one of the other numbers is wrong or the 25,000 is wrong or there are 10,000 missing in action. If there were 80,000 in the pocket, it is sourced that 20,000 killed and 25,000 escaped, so that would leave 35,000 unaccounted for, presumably POWs, so were does the 25,000 POWs come from which has been inserted into the war box? --<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Baird_Shearer_a81d.html" title="User:Philip Baird Shearer">Philip Baird Shearer</a> 12:22, 3 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><i>Away from the map room in the Berlin Führerbunker with its fantasy attacks of phantom divisions, the Soviets were getting on with winning the war.</i></p>
<p>This not only seems POV, but it appears to have little to do with what the article is discussing at that point. --<a href="../../../d/m/a/User%7EDMAJohnson_ed61.html" title="User:DMAJohnson">DMAJohnson</a> 03:41, 6 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It is relevant for the day, the Armies High Commands and the Army Group and Front involved in the Battle of Halbe. On the 21st Hitler ordered the 9th Army group to be prepared to attack north and south as parts of two pincer movements! The next day he is ordering the 9th to attack in a completely different direction (north west) to relieve Berlin. If it is an unbisased point of view what else would you call Hitler's orders to Steiner on the 21st and what else were the Soviets doing? Please can you tell me what the alterntive point of view is? --<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Baird_Shearer_a81d.html" title="User:Philip Baird Shearer">Philip Baird Shearer</a> 21:30, 6 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The article never goes though the trouble of pointing this out, however. Instead, whether intended or not, it simply paints a picture of senile Nazis playing war while the genius Russians march on forward. It also does this in an ackward place, between two paragraphs that are discussing the German's strategy. The same point can be made, I think, by moving it slightly further down in the article, and with rewording, along with proper context. --<a href="../../../d/m/a/User%7EDMAJohnson_ed61.html" title="User:DMAJohnson">DMAJohnson</a> 20:10, 7 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The context is there. All that I have written above is in the preceding paragraph of the article (<i>The command of the V Corps trapped ...</i>). I think what you are doing is looking at the heading which was retrofitted onto the paragraphs after they were written.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The Germans had lost the war, only Hitler and his acolytes in their troglodyte world seem not to have understood this. They were playing war games while the Soviets followed their own war winning strategy. The point of the sentence is that despite the German High Command's attempt to gain control they were mealy reacting to Soviet initiatives, and there was no strategy open to the German High Command to turn the battle around, despite this up until the 22nd and then again afterwards Hitler was issuing orders as if the Germans could regain the strategic initiative. By this stage of the offensive, the Germans could possibly win small tactical victories to fend of the inevitable, but all that did was to cost even more lives and probably not extend the war by one day. --<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Baird_Shearer_a81d.html" title="User:Philip Baird Shearer">Philip Baird Shearer</a> 00:12, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>No, I am taking the entire article into account, not just the headings. Yes, Hitler and friends locked away in their bunker are unable to grasp what is going on around them, but besides that single sentance the article never gets around to pointing out to the reader <i>why</i> there was a problem with the strategy--It just explains what the general strategy was. In fact, from the way the article describes it, the plan would seem perfectly logical until the ackward mention of "phantom divisions" and the novel-esque "getting on with winning the war" line.</p>
<p>There are, I believe, better ways to get the point across in the article. --<a href="../../../d/m/a/User%7EDMAJohnson_ed61.html" title="User:DMAJohnson">DMAJohnson</a> 17:24, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>The lead is nowhere near being an adequate summation of the article.</li>
<li>The article is very detailed in <i>what</i> happened, but doesn't really say <i>why</i>. Why was it worth such fighting to be able to surrender to the Western allies and not the Soviets? (I can imagine the answer, but it would be nice if the article told me, probably in the Prelude section. --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 20:17, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
