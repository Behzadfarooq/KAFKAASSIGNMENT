The Four Courts, seen from its eastern side.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>In April 1922, about 200 anti-<a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglo-Irish_Treaty_db3e.html" title="Anglo-Irish Treaty">treaty</a> IRA militants led by <a href="../../../r/o/r/Rory_O%27Connor_%28Irish_republican%29_5f3b.html" title="Rory O'Connor (Irish republican)">Rory O'Connor</a>, occupied the <a href="../../../f/o/u/Four_Courts_9e27.html" title="Four Courts">Four Courts</a> in <a href="../../../d/u/b/Dublin.html" title="Dublin">Dublin</a>, resulting in a tense stand-off. They wanted to spark a new armed confrontation with the British, which they hoped would bring down the <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglo-Irish_Treaty_db3e.html" title="Anglo-Irish Treaty">Anglo-Irish Treaty</a>, unite the two factions of the IRA against their common enemy and around the common goal of the <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_Republic_c12d.html" title="Irish Republic">Irish Republic</a>. However, for those who were determined to make the Free State into a viable, self-governing Irish state, this was an act of rebellion that would have to be put down <i>by them</i> rather than the British. The Free State Provisional Government was eventually forced to move against these men due to a combination of British pressure and the provocations of the Four Courts garrison -including the kidnapping of a Free State General - J.J. O'Connell.</p>
<p><a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Collins_%28Irish_leader%29_b503.html" title="Michael Collins (Irish leader)">Michael Collins</a> accepted a British offer of <a href="../../../a/r/t/Artillery.html" title="Artillery">artillery</a> given by <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winston_Churchill_74d2.html" title="Winston Churchill">Winston Churchill</a> for use by the new Free State Army. Two 18 pounder field guns were placed on Parliament street and Winetavern street, across the <a href="../../../l/i/f/Liffey.html" title="Liffey">Liffey</a> from the Four Courts complex and after a final ultimatum, they began their bombardment on the 28th of June.</p>
<p>The building contained twelve members of the Irish Republican Army Executive, including Chief-of-Staff <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joe_McKelvey_cb06.html" title="Joe McKelvey">Joe McKelvey</a>, Director of Engineers Rory O'Connor, and Quarter Master General <a href="../../../l/i/a/Liam_Mellows_1f53.html" title="Liam Mellows">Liam Mellows</a>. The garrison consisted of roughly 180 men drawn from the 1st and 2nd Battalions of the IRA's 1st Dublin Brigade, commanded by Commandant Paddy O'Brien, armed for the most part only with small arms, (rifles, five Thompsons submachineguns and two Lewis light machine guns) apart from one captured <a href="../../../r/o/l/Rolls-Royce_Armoured_Car_a77c.html" title="Rolls-Royce Armoured Car">armoured car</a>, which they named "The Mutineer". The members of the IRA Army Executive were the political leaders of the garrison, but served as common soldiers under the command of <a href="../../../e/r/n/Ernie_O%27Malley_9001.html" title="Ernie O'Malley">Ernie O'Malley</a>, commander of the IRA's 2nd Southern Division. The Anti-Treaty side fortified the Four Courts to some extent, planting mines around the complex and barricading the doors and windows, but their leadership ordered them not fire first, to retain the moral high ground and so the Free State troops were allowed to surround the Four Courts.</p>
<p>After the first day's bombardment proved ineffective, the British gave the Free State two more 18 pounder cannon, and offered 60 pounder <a href="../../../h/o/w/Howitzer.html" title="Howitzer">howitzers</a> and even to bomb the Four Courts from the air. Collins turned down the latter two offers because of the risk of causing heavy civilian casualties. On the 29th, Free State troops stormed the eastern wing of the Four Courts, losing 3 killed and 14 wounded and taking 33 prisoners. Early the next day, Paddy O'Brien was injured by <a href="../../../s/h/r/Shrapnel.html" title="Shrapnel">shrapnel</a> and Ernie O'Malley took over military command in the Four Courts. By this time, the shelling had caused the Four Courts to catch fire. In addition, orders arrived from <a href="../../../o/s/c/Oscar_Traynor_f63b.html" title="Oscar Traynor">Oscar Traynor</a>, the anti-treaty IRA commander in Dublin, for the Four Courts garrison to surrender, as he could not reach their position to help them. In the chaos of the moment, the <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_Public_Records_Office_cc36.html" title="Irish Public Records Office">Irish Public Records Office</a> located in the western block of the Four Courts, which had been used as an ammunition store by the Four Courts garrison, was the centre of a huge explosion, blowing to pieces one thousand years of Irish state and religious archives. It has been alleged in some quarters that the Anti-treaty forces deliberately booby-trapped the Public Record office in order to kill advancing Free State troops, though the Anti-Treaty side have alway denied this. O'Malley surrendered the Four Courts to <a href="../../../p/a/d/Paddy_Daly_cc43.html" title="Paddy Daly">Paddy Daly</a>, of the Free State's <a href="../../../d/u/b/Dublin_Guard_6568.html" title="Dublin Guard">Dublin Guard</a> unit, not long afterwards.</p>
<p>At this stage in the war, the loyalties of troops on both sides were confused, as most of them had fought the British together in the <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_Republican_Army_c60e.html" title="Irish Republican Army">Irish Republican Army</a> during the <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_War_of_Independence_d28c.html" title="Irish War of Independence">Irish War of Independence</a>. By appealing to friends on the Free State side, several anti-Treaty leaders among the Four Courts garrison, notably <a href="../../../e/r/n/Ernie_O%27Malley_9001.html" title="Ernie O'Malley">Ernie O'Malley</a> and <a href="../../../s/e/a/Sean_Lemass_b4a2.html" title="Sean Lemass">Sean Lemass</a>, escaped from captivity to continue fighting elsewhere.</p>

<p>Despite the Free State force's success in taking the Four Courts, fighting continued in Dublin until <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_5.html" title="July 5">July 5</a>. On the 29th anti-Treaty IRA units from the Dublin Brigade led by <a href="../../../o/s/c/Oscar_Traynor_f63b.html" title="Oscar Traynor">Oscar Traynor</a> occupied <a href="../../../o/27/c/O%27Connell_Street_ed60.html" title="O'Connell Street">O'Connell Street</a> to try to distract Free State attention from their attack on the Four Courts. Not all of the IRA units in the capital were prepared to fight against the new Irish government however and their numbers were probably about 500 throughout the city. The republicans held out in a "block" of buildings at the north eastern end of O'Connell street. Their only position on the western side of the street, in the <a href="../../../y/m/c/YMCA_8c40.html" title="YMCA">YMCA</a> building was eliminated when Free State troops tunnelled underneath it and detonated a bomb. Traynor's men in the "the block" held out until artillery was brought up, under the cover of <a href="../../../r/o/l/Rolls-Royce_Armoured_Car_a77c.html" title="Rolls-Royce Armoured Car">armoured cars</a>, to bombard them at point blank range. Oscar Traynor and most of his men made their escape when the buildings they were holding caught fire. Among the Republican casualties was Republican leader <a href="../../../c/a/t/Cathal_Brugha_8c3c.html" title="Cathal Brugha">Cathal Brugha</a>, who stayed behind in the Hamman hotel after Traynor and most other IRA men had left. He was shot in the thigh when he left the burning building alone to confront the Free State troops and died later from blood loss.</p>
<p>There were some further sporadic incidents of fighting around the city as Free State troops dispersed anti-treaty IRA groups.</p>
<p>Cathal Brugha was the last casualty in the battle for Dublin which had cost both sides sixty-five killed and twenty-eight wounded. In addition, the Free State took over 400 Republican prisoners. The civilian casualties are thought to have numbered well over 250. The high civilian casualties were doubtless the result of the use of heavy weapons, especially artillery, in a densely populated urban area.</p>

<p>When the fighting in Dublin died down, the Free State Government was left firmly in control of the Irish capital and the anti-treaty forces dispersed around the country. "Round-ups" after the fighting captured more Republican prisoners and resulted in the death of prominent anti-Treaty activist <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_Boland_be37.html" title="Harry Boland">Harry Boland</a> who was shot dead in <a href="../../../s/k/e/Skerries%2C_Dublin_de3d.html" title="Skerries, Dublin">Skerries</a> on July 31.</p>
<p>Oscar Traynor, Ernie O'Malley and the other anti-Treaty fighters who had escaped the fighting in Dublin, regrouped in <a href="../../../b/l/e/Blessington.html" title="Blessington">Blessington</a>, around 30 km south west of the city. An anti-Treaty IRA force from <a href="../../../c/o/u/County_Tipperary_285e.html" title="County Tipperary">county Tipperary</a> had arrived there but was too late to participate in the Dublin fighting. Instead this force headed south and took a string of towns, including <a href="../../../e/n/n/Enniscorthy.html" title="Enniscorthy">Enniscorthy</a> and <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carlow.html" title="Carlow">Carlow</a>, but quickly abandoned them when faced with superior Free State forces. Most of the Republicans then retreated further south again to the so called <a href="../../../m/u/n/Munster_Republic_e6bb.html" title="Munster Republic">Munster Republic</a> -territory south west of a line running from <a href="../../../l/i/m/Limerick.html" title="Limerick">Limerick</a> to <a href="../../../w/a/t/Waterford.html" title="Waterford">Waterford</a>. This in turn was taken by the Free State in an offensive from July to August 1922. (<i>See also <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_Free_State_offensive_24c8.html" title="Irish Free State offensive">Irish Free State offensive</a></i>).</p>
<p>Four of the Republican leaders captured in the Four Courts, Rory O'Connor, Liam Mellows, Joe McKelvey and Richard Barret were later executed by the Free State in revenge for the Anti-Treaty side's killing of TD (member of Parliament) <a href="../../../s/e/a/Sean_Hales_0e23.html" title="Sean Hales">Sean Hales</a>. (<i>see <a href="../../../e/x/e/Executions_during_the_Irish_Civil_War_3d29.html" title="Executions during the Irish Civil War">Executions during the Irish Civil War</a></i>). The street where Cathal Brugha was killed was later renamed Cathal Brugha street in his honour.</p>
