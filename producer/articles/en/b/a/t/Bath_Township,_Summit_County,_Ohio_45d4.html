<p><b>Bath</b> is one of the 16 original townships in <a href="../../../s/u/m/Summit_County%2C_Ohio_7fde.html" title="Summit County, Ohio">Summit County, Ohio</a>. It is on the western edge of Summit County, bordering <a href="../../../a/k/r/Akron%2C_Ohio_8a85.html" title="Akron, Ohio">Akron</a> and roughly 20 miles (30 km) south of <a href="../../../c/l/e/Cleveland%2C_Ohio_cd1a.html" title="Cleveland, Ohio">Cleveland</a>. No incorporated areas were formed within the township but <a href="../../../a/k/r/Akron%2C_Ohio_8a85.html" title="Akron, Ohio">Akron</a> and <a href="../../../f/a/i/Fairlawn%2C_Ohio_c295.html" title="Fairlawn, Ohio">Fairlawn</a> expanded into Bath via annexation. As of the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Census_2000_1990.html" title="United States Census 2000">2000 census</a>, the township population was 9,635, up from a population of 8,804 in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990.html" title="1990">1990</a> (Ohio State University, 2003). It occupies most of survey Town 3, Range 12 in the <a href="../../../w/e/s/Western_Reserve_e1ff.html" title="Western Reserve">Western Reserve</a> and is about 23 square miles (60 km²) in area. It was given the name Bath when during a town council where no one could decide on a name <a href="../../../j/o/n/Jonathan_Hale_c834.html" title="Jonathan Hale">Jonathan Hale</a> exclaimed "O, call it Jerusalem, Jericho, Bath, or anything but Hammondsburgh!", with Hammondsburgh being the name at that time. The council quickly selected Bath.

Bath serves as a <a href="../../../r/u/r/Rural.html" title="Rural">rural</a>-like <a href="../../../s/u/b/Suburb.html" title="Suburb">suburb</a> of both Akron as well as Cleveland. Most of the older homes in the township are typical, affordable suburban homes, but many homes in newer subdivisions break the 1 million dollar mark. According to ESPN, <a href="../../../l/e/b/LeBron_James_9f63.html" title="LeBron James">LeBron James</a> is building a 35,440 square foot home in the Bath Township. <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=2814984" class="external free" title="http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=2814984" rel="nofollow">http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=2814984</a></p>
