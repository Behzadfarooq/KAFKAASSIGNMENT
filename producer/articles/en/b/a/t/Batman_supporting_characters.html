Dent's style of justice has been more brutal that Batman's precision style vigilantism.

When confronted by Batman, Dent blew up his apartment. The inner turmoil created by the situation forced <a href="../../../t/w/o/Two-Face_e8c6.html" title="Two-Face">Two-Face</a> out of his psyche once again, and he's seen re-scarring his face with a scalpel and acid.</li>

Gordon, like other characters, has changed considerably over the years. Of particular note, is that in the early days of the characters, Gordon was not allied with Batman, and was more antagonistic towards him. However, he was a friend of Bruce Wayne. In "<a href="../../../y/e/a/Batman%7E_Year_One_55ba.html" title="Batman: Year One">Batman: Year One</a>", Gordon is portrayed as one of the few honest, non-corrupt Gotham cops. During "No Man's Land", Bruce offered him the knowledge of his secret identity, but Jim (still angry for Batman's early abandonment of Gotham in the days near the beginning of NML) refused to look and find out, hinting he may already know. Jim retired several months after NML, but returned to duty following the OYL jump.</li>

<p>Batman comics have introduced many classic villains. His <a href="../../../r/o/g/Rogues_gallery.html" title="Rogues gallery">rogues gallery</a> is arguably one of the most identifiable in modern fiction. <a href="../../../j/o/k/Joker_%28comics%29.html" title="Joker (comics)">The Joker</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Penguin_571c.html" title="The Penguin">The Penguin</a>, and <a href="../../../t/w/o/Two-Face_e8c6.html" title="Two-Face">Two-Face</a> are some of the most recognizable foes. Batman's rogues gallery is notable for characters such as <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catwoman.html" title="Catwoman">Catwoman</a>, <a href="../../../t/a/l/Talia_al_Ghul_9a99.html" title="Talia al Ghul">Talia</a>, <a href="../../../p/o/i/Poison_Ivy_5e77.html" title="Poison Ivy">Poison Ivy</a>, and <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Riddler_e2d1.html" title="The Riddler">The Riddler</a>, who function both as allies and as villains.</p>

<p>Batman regularly interacts with other DC superheroes in titles such as the <i><a href="../../../j/u/s/Justice_League_047b.html" title="Justice League">Justice League of America</a></i>. A few, however, have a marked presence in the core Batman titles:</p>

As two of the earliest superheroes, Batman and Superman are frequent collaborators in each other's titles, and are frequently used to highlight differences between vigilante and lawful crime-fighting. In the early crossovers, the Man of Steel and the Caped Crusader were usually depicted as good friends who cheerfully assisted one another against foes who were too big to be dealt with alone. In more recent times, their friendship has been depicted as more uneasy, but still with a deep amount of respect. In the current chronology, Batman and Superman first encounter one another early in their careers when Superman arrives in Gotham City to arrest the notorious "outlaw" known as Batman, just as Batman is investigating a murderous criminal named Magpie. Superman left this encounter with Batman, believing he had the best of intentions, though disagreeing with Batman's methods. As Superman flew back to <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metropolis_%28comics%29.html" title="Metropolis (comics)">Metropolis</a>, Batman lamented to himself that Superman was a remarkable individual and that "perhaps, in another lifetime, he might call the Man of Steel his friend." They have collaborated many times in the years since then, learning each other's secret identities, recognizing that their goals are essentially the same, and despite their frequent tense relationship, close allies and friends. Superman has entrusted <a href="../../../l/e/x/Lex_Luthor_a258.html" title="Lex Luthor">Lex Luthor</a>'s <a href="../../../k/r/y/Kryptonite.html" title="Kryptonite">Kryptonite</a> ring to Batman, as a weapon to be used against Superman in case the Man of Steel should ever be turned against the people of Earth. In keeping with that attitude, Batman and Superman are often depicted as being the opposite sides of the same coin, both products of their environments, as indicated in their vastly different styles of crime fighting. Superman became a hero because he prescribed to wholesome idealism, while Batman was motivated by personal tragedy and a troubled past.</li>

<li><b><a href="../../../g/r/e/Green_Arrow_bfe4.html" title="Green Arrow">Green Arrow</a></b>: <b>Oliver Queen</b> began as a character very much inspired by Batman. He had a youthful ward, <a href="../../../s/p/e/Speedy.html" title="Speedy">Speedy</a>, much like Robin, as well as an Arrowcave, an Arrowcar and an Arrowplane, similar to Batman's equipment. Most of these gimmicks were stripped by the 1970s, when both Batman and Green Arrow were revamped into more serious characters. Batman and Green Arrow have often been frequent partners, especially during the 1970s, when Batman's team up title, <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Brave_and_the_Bold_752b.html" title="The Brave and the Bold">The Brave and the Bold</a></i>, was one of the few places outside of the pages of JLA where the Emerald Archer could be found. Like with Superman, early team-ups between Batman and Green Arrow were very friendly, but their relations became strained in more recent incarnations. Batman and Green Arrow's interactions in the 1980s were often employed as counterpoints to differing techniques and political philosophies. Queen and Batman's relationship was further strained by the involvement of Green Arrow in the mindwiping events that happened in the pages of <i><a href="../../../i/d/e/Identity_Crisis_%28comics%29_305a.html" title="Identity Crisis (comics)">Identity Crisis</a></i>, even though Queen voted against the mindwiping of <a href="../../../d/o/c/Doctor_Light_%28Arthur_Light%29_8876.html" title="Doctor Light (Arthur Light)">Dr. Light</a> and Batman, but this seems to have been forgiven for reasons unknown.

Batman ended the relationship because he was unsure if Catwoman had been a willing participant in Hush's plot.
