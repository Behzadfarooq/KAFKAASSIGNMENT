<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Khanwa_022a.html" title="Edit section: Background">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Background</span></h2>
<p>In the early years of the <a href="../../../1/6/t/16th_century.html" title="16th century">16th century</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_India_acc8.html" title="North India">North India</a> was ruled by <a href="../../../i/b/r/Ibrahim_Lodi_8328.html" title="Ibrahim Lodi">Ibrahim Lodi</a>, a sultan belonging to the Lodi clan of <a href="../../../d/e/m/Demographics_of_Afghanistan_cc04.html" title="Demographics of Afghanistan">Afghans</a>. Under the Lodi rulers, the <a href="../../../s/u/l/Sultanate_of_Delhi_07cd.html" title="Sultanate of Delhi">sultanate of Delhi</a> encompassed both the Ganga River basin and the Punjab. Yet, this empire was also crumbling at its very core and was ready to implode.</p>
<p>Zaheer-ud-din <a href="../../../b/a/b/Babur.html" title="Babur">Babur</a> was a <a href="../../../m/u/g/Mughal.html" title="Mughal">Mughal</a> warlord belonging to the lineage of <a href="../../../t/i/m/Timur.html" title="Timur">Timur</a> and <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genghis_Khan_804b.html" title="Genghis Khan">Genghis Khan</a>. His father had ruled the <a href="../../../f/e/r/Fergana.html" title="Fergana">Fergana</a> valley in <a href="../../../c/e/n/Central_Asia_5707.html" title="Central Asia">central Asia</a>, but <a href="../../../b/a/b/Babur.html" title="Babur">Babur</a> had early been driven out from there by his relatives, and was in <a href="../../../1/5/2/1526.html" title="1526">1526</a> ruling over <a href="../../../k/a/b/Kabul.html" title="Kabul">Kabul</a> in <a href="../../../a/f/g/Afghanistan.html" title="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a>. He was forever longing to regain his beloved <a href="../../../f/e/r/Fergana.html" title="Fergana">Fergana valley</a> in central Asia. However, that was not to be; he was destined to found an imperial dynasty in <a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">India</a>.</p>
<p>Ibrahim Lodi’s governor in Punjab, Daulat Khan Lodi, in cohorts with certain other Lodi chiefs of Punjab, opened communication with <a href="../../../b/a/b/Babur.html" title="Babur">Babur</a>, inviting him to attack <a href="../../../d/e/l/Delhi.html" title="Delhi">Delhi</a> and offering all help. Babur probably realized that it was hopeless to aim for <a href="../../../f/e/r/Fergana.html" title="Fergana">Fergana</a>, as the Uzbeks who now ruled it were simply too powerful for him. He concentrated his energy towards making his fortune in <a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">India</a>. He started raiding the outlying Indian districts periodically, and finally, in April <a href="../../../1/5/2/1526.html" title="1526">1526</a>, advanced towards <a href="../../../d/e/l/Delhi.html" title="Delhi">Delhi</a>. <a href="../../../i/b/r/Ibrahim_Lodi_8328.html" title="Ibrahim Lodi">Ibrahim Lodi</a> confronted <a href="../../../b/a/b/Babur.html" title="Babur">Babur</a> near the town of Panipat, not far from Delhi. The ensuing <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_battle_of_Panipat_fd27.html" title="First battle of Panipat">first battle of Panipat</a> resulted in the collapse of the <a href="../../../s/u/l/Sultanate_of_Delhi_07cd.html" title="Sultanate of Delhi">sultanate of Delhi</a>; <a href="../../../i/b/r/Ibrahim_Lodi_8328.html" title="Ibrahim Lodi">Ibrahim Lodi</a> himself was killed on the field.</p>
<p>Whereas the <a href="../../../s/u/l/Sultanate_of_Delhi_07cd.html" title="Sultanate of Delhi">sultanate of Delhi</a> had been humbled, it was not at all clear what the future held for <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_India_acc8.html" title="North India">north India</a>. It has long been the established tradition for invaders from the north-west (<a href="../../../a/f/g/Afghanistan.html" title="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a> and <a href="../../../c/e/n/Central_asia.html" title="Central asia">central asia</a>) to destroy all in their wake, conquer <a href="../../../d/e/l/Delhi.html" title="Delhi">Delhi</a>, loot the surrounding countryside, and then retire to their native lands with the booty thus obtained, leaving <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_India_acc8.html" title="North India">north India</a> in a chaotic political vacuum. Not unnaturally, many in India surmised this to be <a href="../../../b/a/b/Babur.html" title="Babur">Babur</a>'s intent as well, and prepared to exploit the situation.</p>
<p><a href="../../../r/a/n/Rana_Sanga_2927.html" title="Rana Sanga">Rana Sanga</a>, more formally known as Maharana Sangram Singh I, ruler of <a href="../../../m/e/w/Mewar.html" title="Mewar">Mewar</a> in western central-India, was among the better placed to do so. Sanga was an intrepid warrior; legend has it that he had received as many as eighty wounds during his career of warfare. Unbelievably, Rana Sanga had at this point united nearly all the major <a href="../../../r/a/j/Rajput.html" title="Rajput">Rajput</a> clans of India under his leadership, an event with neither precedent nor recurrence, and had thus formed a powerful confederacy. This situation whetted his appetite for conquest.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Khanwa_022a.html" title="Edit section: Immediate cause of the battle">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Immediate cause of the battle</span></h2>
<p>The immediate cause of the battle seems to have been the defiance of Hasan Khan Mewati, a Muslim chieftain belonging to the <a href="../../../m/e/o/Meo.html" title="Meo">Meo</a> community, who ruled over the <a href="../../../m/e/w/Mewat.html" title="Mewat">Mewat</a> region as a vassal of the Lodhi emperors. <a href="../../../m/e/w/Mewat.html" title="Mewat">Mewat</a> is a region lying south of Delhi, spread across south <a href="../../../h/a/r/Haryana.html" title="Haryana">Haryana</a> and North-East <a href="../../../r/a/j/Rajasthan.html" title="Rajasthan">Rajasthan</a>. The <a href="../../../m/e/o/Meo.html" title="Meo">Meos</a> themselves are Muslims of definitely Indian provenance, ethnic cousin of the <a href="../../../j/a/t/Jat.html" title="Jat">Jat</a> and <a href="../../../g/u/j/Gujar.html" title="Gujar">Gujar</a> castes. After the overthrow of the Lodhi dynasty, Hasan Khan aligned himself with <a href="../../../r/a/n/Rana_Sanga_2927.html" title="Rana Sanga">Rana Sanga</a> and refused to acknowledge the suzerainty of <a href="../../../b/a/b/Babur.html" title="Babur">Babur</a>. Babur tried to win him over with promises of high position in Mughal service, but Hasan Khan was apparently not impressed. It is possible that he also surmised that <a href="../../../b/a/b/Babur.html" title="Babur">Babur</a> would soon return to Kabul, and being firmly rooted in the land of Mewat, had no wish of follow him; Hasan Khan placed his bets firmly on <a href="../../../r/a/n/Rana_Sanga_2927.html" title="Rana Sanga">Rana Sanga</a>.</p>

<p><a href="../../../b/a/b/Babur.html" title="Babur">Babur</a> moved into Mewat to chastise Hasan Khan, and soon <a href="../../../r/a/n/Rana_Sanga_2927.html" title="Rana Sanga">Rana Sanga</a> joined the war. The two armies closed in near <a href="../../../k/h/a/Khanwa.html" title="Khanwa">Khanwa</a> in March <a href="../../../1/5/2/1527.html" title="1527">1527</a>.</p>

<p>According to Mewari sources, the <a href="../../../r/a/j/Rajput.html" title="Rajput">Rajput</a> army which took to the field comprised of 80,000 horsemen and 500 war elephants and included 7 Rajas, 9 Raos and 104 Rawals and Rawats (lesser chieftains). It had no artillery or Muskets. Hasan Khan Mewati and Mahmood Lodhi (the claimant to the Lodhi throne) joined this army with their contingent. Estimates of Mughal army strength are not clear. Babur had come to India with twelve thousand soldiers. There is reason to believe that this number must have swelled, as Mughal army must have been joined by the <a href="../../../a/f/g/Afghanistan.html" title="Afghanistan">Afghan</a> nobles who had invited Babur to India. Yet it is generally believed that Babur was vastly outnumbered by the Rajput confederacy. However, the Mughal army possessed artillery and firearms, which were a novelty in <a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">India</a> at that time. This gave them a decisive edge in the battle.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Khanwa_022a.html" title="Edit section: Babar motivates his men">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Babar motivates his men</span></h3>
<p>The challenges facing <a href="../../../b/a/b/Babur.html" title="Babur">Babur</a> appeared insurmountable. The entire broad basin of the Ganga was dominated by <a href="../../../a/f/g/Afghanistan.html" title="Afghanistan">Afghan</a> chiefs who had strong associations with the Lodhi dynasty. Although in disarray at that moment, they had formidable military potential. Thus, with most of the neighboring strongholds held by his foes, he was virtually surrounded. His own men, suffering from the heat and disheartened by the hostile environment of this new land, had no notions of supplanting the Lodhi Afghans as the settled gentry of the country; they only wished to return home to <a href="../../../c/e/n/Central_asia.html" title="Central asia">central asia</a> with the booty of war. As if all this was not enough, Babur's astrologer warned him against this conflict. All this might have disheartened a lesser man, but not <a href="../../../b/a/b/Babur.html" title="Babur">Babur</a>. By using threats, reproaches, promises, and appeals, vividly described in his memoirs, Babur preserved his army’s unity.</p>
<p>The theatrics that <a href="../../../b/a/b/Babur.html" title="Babur">Babur</a> employed to motivate his men remains to this day one of the most excellent displays of military leadership. Publicly addressing his men, he declared the forthcoming battle a <i><b>Jihad</b></i> or Islamic crusade. His soldiers were facing a non-Muslim army for the first time ever. This, he said, was their chance to become either a <i>Ghazi</i> (soldier of Islam) or a <i>Shaheed</i> (Martyr of Islam). Then he thought up something truly brilliant. Babur was a hard drinker in the tradition of Turko-Mongol warriors, and so were most of his men. He now publicly renounced alcohol and urged his men to do the same. To dramatize the event further, he ordered all the wine in his army collected and poured down a well. All wine cups, vessels etc were broken down. Gold and silver or the precious cups were taken out to be distributed among the poor. No wonder the spirits of his men lifted.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Khanwa_022a.html" title="Edit section: Precursor to battle">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Precursor to battle</span></h3>
<p>Babur sent about fifteen hundred choice cavalry troops in a probing attack on the <a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">Indian</a> army. These were entirely destroyed by the Indians; this prompted Babur to ask for a negotiated settlement of the conflict. Unfortunately, <a href="../../../r/a/n/Rana_Sanga_2927.html" title="Rana Sanga">Rana Sanga</a> failed to follow up his advantage, being hampered by discord among his allies (one reason why Rajput confederacies were few and far between and seldom worked). He sent his one of the most trusted generals, <a href="../../../s/i/l/Silhadi.html" title="Silhadi">Silhadi</a> (Shiladitya), a Tomar or Purabia Rajput chieftain, to Babur for discussions. Babur won over this general by promising him an independent kingdom in northeast Malwa. Silhadi came back and reported to Sanga that Babur does not want peace, and wants to fight. The die was cast.</p>
<p>In preparation for the battle, <a href="../../../b/a/b/Babur.html" title="Babur">Babur</a> used the same tactics that he had used a year earlier at the <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_battle_of_Panipat_fd27.html" title="First battle of Panipat">first battle of Panipat</a>. He lined up the wagons and connected them with ox-hide ropes and chains to form a barricade. In front of this barricade, he dug trenches to prevent his fortification being overrun by cavalry charge. Behind this barricade and in between the wagons, he positioned his artillery and musketeers. Every few yards between this line of carts, he left gaps from where his horsemen can sally forth and attack the enemy. Babur calls this fortification an <a href="../../../o/t/t/Ottoman_Empire_4168.html" title="Ottoman Empire">Ottoman</a> tactic. He had effectively created a movable fortress right in the middle of the flat plains.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Khanwa_022a.html" title="Edit section: The armies meet">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The armies meet</span></h3>
<p>On <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_17.html" title="March 17">March 17</a>, Rana Sanga launched a furious attack on the centre and right wing of the Mughal force; the conflict lasted several hours. Mughal artillery wreaked havoc in the Rajputs’ closed ranks. Their cannon fire caused the <a href="../../../e/l/e/Elephant.html" title="Elephant">elephants</a> in the <a href="../../../r/a/j/Rajput.html" title="Rajput">Rajput</a> army to stampede. Mughal cavalry archers made repeated flanking charges from the left and right of their fortified position. These mounted archers seem to have inflicted maximum losses on Indian ranks, as the latter were not accustomed to these tactics. Despite sustaining heavy losses because of superior Mughal tactics, the Indians initially appeared to have an advantage due to their sheer numbers and their frenzied charges at the Mughal position. Yet after many hours, the Rajputs failed to overrun the strongly defended central "fortress" of the Mughal army. This signaled to Silhadi which way the penny would drop.</p>
<p><a href="../../../r/a/n/Rana_Sanga_2927.html" title="Rana Sanga">Rana Sanga</a> sustained more wounds, at one time being felled by an arrow; nevertheless, he fought on. For a while, the battle's outcome hung in balance. Then, sensing that Rana Sanga’s ship was sinking, Silhadi decamped to <a href="../../../b/a/b/Babur.html" title="Babur">Babur</a> with his entire force. After ten hours, the confederacy broke. It was all over for Mewar. The defection of a significant portion of the army fatally weakened the Indians. Mughal flanks finally rolled back the Indian flanks. The Rajput army disintegrated rapidly now. <a href="../../../r/a/n/Rana_Sanga_2927.html" title="Rana Sanga">Rana Sanga</a> chose to retreat from the battle, to live and fight another day.</p>

<p>After the customary erection of a tower of the heads of dead and prisoner enemy soldiers, a ritual that comes right from the Mongolian steppes, Babur added the title of <i>Ghazi</i> to his name, signifying his role as a warrior for Islam. The battle of Khanwa was almost certainly the first in which <a href="../../../b/a/b/Babur.html" title="Babur">Babur</a> confronted a Non-Muslim army. He remained firm on his vow of abstinence from alcohol till his death in <a href="../../../1/5/3/1530.html" title="1530">1530</a>. At one time, he is said to have wistfully commented “Others have taken to the cup and later regretted it, I renounced the cup and later regretted it.”</p>
<p>To briefly summarize the subsequent careers of the main players in this battle:</p>
<ul>
<li>Babur retired to his capital, <a href="../../../a/g/r/Agra.html" title="Agra">Agra</a>. He would still have to face one more bid by the remnants of the Lodi dynasty, led by Mahmood Khan Lodi, in the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Ghaghra_8033.html" title="Battle of Ghaghra">battle of Ghaghra</a>, but the foundation of the <a href="../../../m/u/g/Mughal_empire.html" title="Mughal empire">Mughal empire</a> was well and truly set on the soil of <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_India_acc8.html" title="North India">north India</a>.</li>
<li>Mahmood Khan Lodi fled eastwards and would again pose a challenge to <a href="../../../b/a/b/Babur.html" title="Babur">Babur</a> two years later at the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Ghaghra_8033.html" title="Battle of Ghaghra">Battle of Ghaghra</a>.</li>
<li>Hasan Khan Mewati escaped from the battlefield, but was later killed by his own servants. His son Nahar Khan swore allegiance to <a href="../../../b/a/b/Babur.html" title="Babur">Babur</a> and received some area in his native Mewat region to administer as a vassal of the Mughal emperor.</li>
<li>Rana Sanga died shortly after this battle (in <a href="../../../1/5/2/1527.html" title="1527">1527</a> itself) at Baswa on <a href="../../../m/e/w/Mewar.html" title="Mewar">Mewar</a>'s northern border. His death was put down to war wounds, but there was also suspicion of poison.</li>
<li>Silhadi retired to his fort at Raisen; he died in <a href="../../../1/5/3/1532.html" title="1532">1532</a> at battle with the sultan of Gujarat, Bahadur Shah.</li>
