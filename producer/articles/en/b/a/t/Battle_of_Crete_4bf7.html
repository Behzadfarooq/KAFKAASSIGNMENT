<p>The <b>Battle of Crete</b> (<a href="../../../g/e/r/German_language.html" title="German language">German</a> <b>Luftlandeschlacht um Kreta</b>; <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greek_language.html" title="Greek language">Greek</a> <b>Μάχη της Κρήτης</b>) was a battle during <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a> on the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greece.html" title="Greece">Greek</a> island of <a href="../../../c/r/e/Crete.html" title="Crete">Crete</a>. The battle began on the morning of <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_20.html" title="May 20">20 May</a> <a href="../../../1/9/4/1941.html" title="1941">1941</a>, when <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazi_Germany_add9.html" title="Nazi Germany">Nazi Germany</a> launched an <a href="../../../a/i/r/Airborne_forces.html" title="Airborne forces">airborne invasion</a> of Crete under the code-name <b>Unternehmen Merkur</b> (Operation <small>MERCURY</small>). <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allies_of_World_War_II_afb4.html" title="Allies of World War II">Allied forces</a> defended the island.</p>
<p>After one day of fighting, none of the objectives had been reached and the Germans had suffered appalling casualties. The German plans were in disarray and commanding General <a href="../../../k/u/r/Kurt_Student_ed81.html" title="Kurt Student">Kurt Student</a> was contemplating suicide.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> During the next day, through miscommunication and the failure of Allied commanders to grasp the situation, the <a href="../../../m/a/l/Maleme.html" title="Maleme">Maleme</a> airfield in western Crete fell to the Germans. The loss of Maleme enabled the Germans to fly in heavy reinforcements and overwhelm the Allied forces.</p>
<p>The battle of Crete was unique in three respects: it was the first mainly airborne invasion in history; it was the first time the Allies made significant use of the decipherment of the German <a href="../../../e/n/i/Enigma.html" title="Enigma">Enigma</a> code; and it was the first time invading German troops encountered mass resistance from a civilian population. The battle introduced a revolutionary form of warfare and may have had a significant impact on the course of events of the Second World War. In light of the heavy casualties suffered by the parachutists, <a href="../../../a/d/o/Adolf_Hitler_fdc0.html" title="Adolf Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> forbade further airborne operations. Crete was dubbed "the graveyard of the German parachutists." However, the Allies were impressed by the potential of paratroopers and started to build their own airborne divisions.</p>

<p>By May, the defence consisted of approximately 9,000 Greeks: three <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battalion.html" title="Battalion">battalions</a> of the 5th (Crete) Division of the <a href="../../../h/e/l/Hellenic_Army_ce8a.html" title="Hellenic Army">Hellenic Army</a>, which had been left behind when the rest of the unit had been transferred to the mainland to oppose the German invasion; the <a href="../../../c/r/e/Cretan_Gendarmerie_1822.html" title="Cretan Gendarmerie">Cretan Gendarmerie</a> (a battalion-sized force); the <a href="../../../h/e/r/Heraklion.html" title="Heraklion">Heraklion</a> Garrison Battalion, a defence battalion — made up mostly of transport and logistics personnel; and remnants of the 12th and 20th Hellenic Army divisions, which had escaped to Crete and were organized under British command. There were also cadets from the Gendarmerie academy and recruits from the Greek recruit training centers in the <a href="../../../p/e/l/Peloponnese.html" title="Peloponnese">Peloponnese</a>, who had been transferred to Crete to replace the trained soldiers being sent to fight on the mainland. These troops were already organised into numbered recruit training <a href="../../../r/e/g/Regiment.html" title="Regiment">regiments</a>, and it was decided to use this existing configuration to organize the Greek troops, supplementing them with experienced men arriving from the mainland.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commonwealth_of_Nations_38fc.html" title="Commonwealth of Nations">British Commonwealth</a> contingent consisted of the original British garrison and another 25,000 Commonwealth troops evacuated from the mainland. The evacuees were the typical mix found in any contested evacuation — substantially intact units under their own command, composite units hurriedly brought together by leaders on the spot, stragglers without leaders from every type of unit possessed by an army, and <a href="../../../d/e/s/Deserter.html" title="Deserter">deserters</a>.

<p>On <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_25.html" title="April 25">April 25</a>, Hitler signed Directive Number 28, ordering the invasion of Crete. The <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Navy_80f7.html" title="Royal Navy">Royal Navy</a>'s forces from Alexandria retained control of the waters around Crete, so any <a href="../../../a/m/p/Amphibious_assault.html" title="Amphibious assault">amphibious assault</a> would be quickly decided by the nature of an air-<i>versus</i>-ship battle, making it a risky proposition at best. With German air superiority a given, an airborne invasion was decided on.</p>
<p>This was to be the first truly large-scale airborne invasion, although the Germans had used <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paratrooper.html" title="Paratrooper">parachute</a> and <a href="../../../g/l/i/Glider.html" title="Glider">glider-borne</a> assaults on a much smaller scale in the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_France_ab9b.html" title="Battle of France">invasion of France</a> and the <a href="../../../l/o/w/Low_Countries_e9ff.html" title="Low Countries">Low Countries</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/r/Norway.html" title="Norway">Norway</a> and even mainland Greece.

German engineers were landed near the bridge in gliders, while parachute infantry attacked the <a href="../../../p/e/r/Perimeter.html" title="Perimeter">perimeter</a> defence forces. The bridge was damaged in the fighting, which slowed the German advance and gave the Allies time to evacuate 18,000 troops to Crete and an additional 23,000 to Egypt, albeit with the loss of most of their heavy equipment.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>The intention was to use <i><a href="../../../f/a/l/Fallschirmj%C3%A4ger.html" title="Fallschirmjäger">Fallschirmjäger</a></i> to capture key points of the island, including <a href="../../../a/i/r/Airfield.html" title="Airfield">airfields</a> that could then be used to fly in supplies and reinforcements.

Major-General Freyberg, Allied Commander at the Battle of Crete</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>By this time, Allied commanders had become aware of the invasion through <a href="../../../u/l/t/Ultra.html" title="Ultra">Ultra</a> intercepts. General Freyberg was informed of their battle plan, and started to prepare a defence based near the airfields and along the north coast. However, he was seriously hampered by a lack of modern equipment, and was faced with the reality that even lightly armed paratroopers would be able to manage about the same firepower as his own, if not more. In addition, it should be noted although the intelligence Freyberg received through Ultra was very detailed, it had been deciphered by linguists and not tacticians. The result was misleading information taken out of context. As an example, the German messages mentioned seaborne operations, which seriously affected Freyberg's troop deployment as he expected an amphibious landing, consequently detracting from the main German objective of the Maleme Airfield. Furthermore, he was seriously hampered by his own superiors. Freyberg requested the demolition of the Cretean airfields, so that even if the German captured them, they would not be able to fly in significant reinforcements, but this request was turned down by his superiors, who apparently considered the battle already won and were already planning to use Greek airbases against the Germans.</p>

<p>German Twelfth Army Intelligence painted a less optimistic picture, but still believed the British Commonwealth forces to be much fewer than they actually were, and also underestimated the number of Greek troops who had been evacuated from the mainland. General <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_L%C3%B6hr_95f2.html" title="Alexander Löhr">Alexander Löhr</a>, the theatre commander, was convinced the island could be taken with two divisions, but decided to keep 6th Mountain Division in <a href="../../../a/t/h/Athens.html" title="Athens">Athens</a> as a reserve.

<p>The Germans were deploying a new weapon on Crete: the 7.5 cm Leicht-Geschütz 40 "light gun" (actually a <a href="../../../r/e/c/Recoilless_rifle.html" title="Recoilless rifle">recoilless rifle</a>). At 320 pounds (145 kg), it weighed only a tenth as much as a standard German 75 mm <a href="../../../f/i/e/Field_gun.html" title="Field gun">field gun</a>, yet had two-thirds of its range. It fired a 13 lb (6 kg) shell over three miles (5 km). Adding to the airborne units' firepower was the fact one-quarter of them jumped with a <a href="../../../m/p/4/MP40_eb31.html" title="MP40">MP40</a> <a href="../../../s/u/b/Submachine_gun.html" title="Submachine gun">submachine gun</a>, often carried in addition to a <a href="../../../b/o/l/Bolt-action.html" title="Bolt-action">bolt-action</a> <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karabiner_98k.html" title="Karabiner 98k">Karabiner 98k</a> <a href="../../../r/i/f/Rifle.html" title="Rifle">rifle</a>.

<p>The Germans used color-coded parachutes to distinguish the canisters carrying rifles, <a href="../../../a/m/m/Ammunition.html" title="Ammunition">ammunition</a>, crew-served weapons and other supplies. Heavy equipment like the <i>Leicht-Geschütz 40</i> was dropped with a special triple-parachute harness designed to bear the extra weight.</p>
<p>The troopers also carried special strips of cloth which could be unfurled in pre-arranged patterns to signal low-flying fighters to coordinate air support and supply drops.</p>
<p>In contrast with the practice of most other nations' airborne forces, who jumped with personal weapons strapped to the body, German airborne procedure was for individual weapons to be dropped in canisters; this was a major flaw. While it facilitated exit from the aircraft and prevented loss and damage to the rifles, it left the paratroopers armed only with their sidearms and fighting knives in the critical few minutes after landing. The poor design of German parachutes compounded the problem: the standard German parachute harness had only a single riser connecting the paratrooper to the parachute canopy, and thus could not be steered toward weapons canisters and away from ground hazards during descent. Even the twenty-five percent of paratroops armed with submachine guns were at a distinct disadvantage, given the weapon's limited range. Many <i>Fallschirmjäger</i> were shot attempting to make it to their unit's weapons canisters.</p>

<p>There was much debate in the German high command concerning the operational plan for Crete. Though all agreed on the necessity of taking Maleme, there was some debate over the concentration of forces there and the number to be deployed against other targets, such as the smaller airfields at Heraklion and <a href="../../../r/e/t/Rethymnon.html" title="Rethymnon">Rethymnon</a>. The <i>Luftwaffe</i> commander, General <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_L%C3%B6hr_95f2.html" title="Alexander Löhr">Alexander Löhr</a>, and the naval commander, <a href="../../../c/o/u/Counter_Admiral_d083.html" title="Counter Admiral">Counter Admiral</a> Karl-Georg Schuster, favored a heavier concentration against Maleme, to achieve overwhelming superiority of force. By contrast, <a href="../../../k/u/r/Kurt_Student_ed81.html" title="Kurt Student">Major-General Kurt von Student</a> wanted to disperse his paratroops more widely, in order to maximize the effect of surprise. As a primary objective, Maleme offered several advantages: it was the largest airfield, capable of supporting heavy transports bearing reinforcements; it was near enough to the mainland to allow air cover from land-based <a href="../../../b/f/_/Bf_109.html" title="Bf 109">Bf 109</a> fighters; and it was near the northern coast, so seaborne reinforcements could be brought up quickly. A compromise plan was forced by <a href="../../../h/e/r/Herman_Goering_d93f.html" title="Herman Goering">Herman Goering</a> and the final plan heavily emphasized securing Maleme first, while not ignoring the other Allied assets.</p>
<p>The final plan was code named <i>Merkur</i>, after the swift <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_empire.html" title="Roman empire">Roman</a> god <a href="../../../m/e/r/Mercury_%28mythology%29.html" title="Mercury (mythology)">Mercury</a>. German forces were divided into three battle groups, Center, West and East, each with a special code name following the classical theme established by <small><i>MERCURY</i></small>. A total of 750 glider troops, 10,000 paratroops, 5,000 airlifted mountain troops, and 7,000 seaborne troops were allotted for the invasion. The largest proportion of the forces were in Group West.</p>

<p>German airborne doctrine was based on parachuting in a small number of forces directly on top of enemy airfields. This force would capture the perimeter and any local <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-aircraft.html" title="Anti-aircraft">anti-aircraft</a> guns, allowing a much larger force to land by glider. Freyberg was aware of this after studying German actions of the past year, and decided to render the airfields unusable for landing. However, he was countermanded by the <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middle_East_Command_e8a9.html" title="Middle East Command">Middle East Command</a> in <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexandria.html" title="Alexandria">Alexandria</a>. They felt the invasion was doomed to fail now that they knew about it, and possibly wanted to keep the airfields intact for the RAF's return once the island was secure, in what is held by some to have been a fatal error. It is not clear whether this is the case, for the Germans proved they were able to land reinforcements without resort to fully-functioning airfields. One German pilot crash-landed his transport on a deserted beach; others landed in empty fields, discharged their cargo and took off again. With the Germans willing to sacrifice some of their numerous transport aircraft to win the battle, it is not clear whether a decision to destroy the airfields would have made any difference to the final outcome. The gliders, were, of course, designed to be expendable and consequently their pilots were even more daring in their landing choices.</p>

<p>At 8:00 am on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_20.html" title="May 20">20 May</a> German paratroopers landed near <a href="../../../m/a/l/Maleme.html" title="Maleme">Maleme airfield</a> and the town of <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chania.html" title="Chania">Chania</a>. The 21st, 22nd, and 23rd New Zealand Battalions defended Maleme airfield and its direct surrounding area. The Germans suffered heavy casualties within the first hours of the invasion. One company of the III Battalion, 1st Assault Regiment, lost 112 killed out of 126; 400 of the battalion's 600 men were killed before the end of the first day.</p>
<p>Of the initial forces, the majority were mauled by Allied forces placed near the airfield of Maleme and town of Chania. Many of the gliders following the paratroops were hit by <a href="../../../m/o/r/Mortar_%28weapon%29.html" title="Mortar (weapon)">mortar</a> fire within seconds of landing. Those who did land were wiped out almost to a man by the Greek and Commonwealth defenders.</p>
<p>A number of German forces had landed off-site near both airfields, as is common in airdrops, and set up defensive positions to the west of Maleme airfield, and "Prison Valley" in the Chania area. Although both forces were bottled up and failed to take the airfields, they were in place and the defenders had to deploy to face them.</p>
<p>Greek police forces and cadets were also in action, with the First Greek Regiment (Provisional) defeating an incursion by the 95th Gebirgs Pioneer Battalion at <a href="../../../k/a/s/Kastelli.html" title="Kastelli">Kastelli</a>. Meanwhile, the 8th Greek Regiment and elements of the Cretan forces severely hampered movement by the 95th Reconnaissance Battalion on <a href="../../../k/o/l/Kolimbari.html" title="Kolimbari">Kolimbari</a> and <a href="../../../p/a/l/Paleochora.html" title="Paleochora">Paleochora</a>, where Allied reinforcements from North Africa could potentially be landed.</p>
<p>Everywhere on the island, Cretan civilians, armed and otherwise, joined the battle. Many German soldiers were killed by these civilian forces, but once they had overcome their shock at such unprecedented resistance from a civilian population, the German paratroopers reacted with equal ferocity.</p>

<p>A second German wave arrived in the afternoon, one group attacking <a href="../../../r/e/t/Rethimnon.html" title="Rethimnon">Rethimnon</a> at 4:15 pm and another at <a href="../../../h/e/r/Heraklion.html" title="Heraklion">Heraklion</a> at 5:30. As with the earlier actions, the defenders were waiting for them and inflicted heavy casualties.</p>
<p>Heraklion was defended by the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_14th_Infantry_Brigade_f878.html" title="British 14th Infantry Brigade">British 14th Infantry Brigade</a>, augmented by the <a href="../../../2/2F/4/2_4th_Australian_Infantry_Battalion_8087.html" title="2/4th Australian Infantry Battalion">Australian 2/4th Battalion</a> and the Greek 3rd, 7th and "Garrison" (ex-5th "Crete" Division") battalions. The Greek units were sorely lacking in equipment and supplies, the Garrison Battalion especially, as the bulk of its <a href="../../../m/a/t/Mat%C3%A9riel.html" title="Matériel">matériel</a> had shipped to the mainland with the division, but they would fight with distinction nonetheless.</p>
<p>The Germans pierced the defensive cordon around Heraklion on the first day, seizing the Greek barracks on the west edge of the town and capturing the docks; the Greeks counterattacked both points and recaptured them. Some German units began using captured townspeople as <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human_shields.html" title="Human shields">human shields</a>, and the Germans dropped leaflets urging surrender and threatening dire consequences if an Allied surrender was not effected immediately. The next day, Heraklion was heavily bombed. The battered Greek units were rotated out and assumed a defensive position on the road to <a href="../../../k/n/o/Knossos.html" title="Knossos">Knossos</a>.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup>.</p>
<p>As night fell, none of the German objectives had been secured. The risky plan — attacking at four separate points to fully use surprise rather than concentrating on one — seemed to have failed, although the reasons were unknown to the Germans.</p>
<p>Towards the evening of 20 May the Germans at Maleme were slowly pushing back the New Zealanders from Hill 107, which overlooked the airfield. The Axis commanders on Crete decided to throw everything into the Maleme sector the next day.</p>
<p>Among the paratroopers who landed on the first day of the battle was former world heavyweight champion <a href="../../../b/o/x/Boxing.html" title="Boxing">boxer</a> <a href="../../../m/a/x/Max_Schmeling_8137.html" title="Max Schmeling">Max Schmeling</a>, who held the rank of <i><a href="../../../g/e/f/Gefreiter.html" title="Gefreiter">Gefreiter</a></i> (<a href="../../../l/a/n/Lance_corporal.html" title="Lance corporal">lance corporal</a>/<a href="../../../p/r/i/Private_first_class.html" title="Private first class">private first class</a>) at the time.

<p>The majority of Cretans, as mentioned above, were Venizelist Republicans — as were a significant number of mainland Greeks. In 1924, <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_II_of_Greece_0bb5.html" title="George II of Greece">George II, King of the Hellenes</a> had been deposed and exiled to Romania, only to return in 1935 after the collapse of republican government. The Germans regarded George as a hopeless Anglophile and an obstacle to their conquest of Greece, which they believed to be mostly anti-monarchist. After the king escaped to Crete on <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_22.html" title="April 22">22 April</a> and issued a defiant memorandum to the Germans, Hitler responded by attacking the king in a speech given on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_4.html" title="May 4">4 May</a>. The British feared the propaganda coup that the capture by airborne troops of a sovereign monarch under their protection would represent.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>The king was staying in a villa near the village of Perivolia, outside <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chania.html" title="Chania">Chania</a>. He and his entourage narrowly escaped capture at that house and at the abode of <a href="../../../e/m/m/Emmanouil_Tsouderos_f7d1.html" title="Emmanouil Tsouderos">Emmanouil Tsouderos</a>, the prime minister. From the garden of Tsouderos's home, German paratroopers were seen landing in the area of the king's villa, although it later turned out they were members of 3rd Battalion, 3rd Parachute Rifle Regiment, which was assigned to the Galatas sector and whose members had been dropped near the villa by mistake. An evacuation by the Royal Navy had already been arranged, with Colonel J.S. Blunt, the British <a href="../../../m/i/l/Military_attach%C3%A9.html" title="Military attaché">military attaché</a> to Greece acting as liaison. A platoon of New Zealand infantry under Lieutenant W.H. Ryan was assigned as a bodyguard, along with a complement of Cretan gendarmes. The king was accompanied by his cousin, Prince Peter; Colonel M. Levidis, Master of Ceremonies; Prime Minister Tsouderos and Kyriakos Varvaressos, Governor-in-Exile of the <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bank_of_Greece_5d75.html" title="Bank of Greece">Bank of Greece</a>.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p>The party had several close calls with both the Germans and the native Cretans. A detachment was sent back for some papers left behind by Mr. Tsouderos; they returned to report the house was already occupied, meaning the Germans were by now aware of the king's presence nearby. Lieutenant Ryan had the king remove his Greek general's uniform, which was adorned with <a href="../../../g/o/l/Gold_braid.html" title="Gold braid">gold braid</a> and other ornaments that were bound to attract attention. At one point the group were pinned down by the rifle fire of Cretan mountaineers. Prince Peter shouted to them in Greek, and they replied "Germans also speak Greek and wear Greek uniforms." Eventually convinced that the royal retinue were not German spies, they let them pass. That night, the evacuees rested in the village of <a href="../../../t/h/e/Therisso.html" title="Therisso">Therisso</a>. There, they were startled by a clamour at the doors, which turned out to be the prison escapees released earlier in the day. Patriotism apparently overwhelmed any sympathy for their German emancipators and antipathy to the monarchist constitution, and the prisoners moved on to forage for weapons instead of betraying their fellow fugitives.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p>Though forced to abandon their pack mules and lacking proper clothing and equipment for <a href="../../../m/o/u/Mountain_climbing.html" title="Mountain climbing">mountain climbing</a>, the entourage arrived safely at their rendezvous point. There, joined by evacuating members of the British diplomatic corps, they signalled <a href="../../../h/m/s/HMS_Decoy_a843.html" title="HMS Decoy">HMS <i>Decoy</i></a> and were plucked from the shore, arriving in <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexandria.html" title="Alexandria">Alexandria</a> on the night of 22 May.</p>

<p>The next morning it was found that the New Zealand infantry battalion defending the airfield on Hill 107 had mistakenly withdrawn at night, although they continued to pour <a href="../../../a/r/t/Artillery.html" title="Artillery">artillery</a> fire into the area. This gave the German forces control of the airfield, just as a sea landing took place nearby.

<p>Realising that Maleme was now the key to holding the entire island, the defending force organised for a counter-attack by two New Zealand battalions on the night of 21–22 May. Fears of a sea landing meant that a number of units that could have taken part in the attack were left in place, although this possibility was removed by a strong <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Navy_80f7.html" title="Royal Navy">Royal Navy</a> presence which arrived too late for the plans to change.</p>
<p>The force attacked at night, but by this time the original paratroops had set up defensive lines, and the newly arrived mountain troops proved difficult to dislodge. The attack slowly petered out, failing to retake the airfield. From this point on the defenders were involved in a series of withdrawals to the eastern end of the island, in an attempt to avoid being out-flanked by the oncoming German forces.</p>

<p>The defense of the 8th Greek Regiment in and around the village of <a href="../../../a/l/i/Alikianos.html" title="Alikianos">Alikianos</a> is credited with protecting the allied line of retreat. Alikianos, located in the "Prison Valley," was strategically important and it was one of the first targets the Germans attacked on the opening day of the battle. The 8th Greek was composed of young Cretan recruits, gendarmes, and cadets. They were poorly equipped and only 850 strong — roughly battalion, not regiment-sized. Attached to the 10<sup>th</sup> New Zealand Infantry Brigade under Lieutenant-Colonel <a href="../../../h/o/w/Howard_Kippenberger_db32.html" title="Howard Kippenberger">Howard Kippenberger</a>, little was expected of them by Allied officers. The Greeks, however, proved such pessimism wrong. On the first day of battle they decisively repulsed the Engineer Battalion. During the next several days they held out against repeated attacks by the 85th and 100th Mountain Regiments. For seven days they held Alikianos and protected the Allied line of retreat. The 8th Greek Regiment is credited with making the evacuation of Western Crete a possibility by many historians such as <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antony_Beevor_095d.html" title="Antony Beevor">Antony Beevor</a> and <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alan_Clark_cb76.html" title="Alan Clark">Alan Clark</a>.</p>

<p>The Germans pushed the British, Commonwealth and Hellenic forces steadily southward, using aerial and artillery bombardment followed by waves of <a href="../../../m/o/t/Motorcycle.html" title="Motorcycle">motorcycle</a> and mountain troops (the mountainous terrain made it difficult to employ tanks). The Souda Bay garrisons at <a href="../../../s/o/u/Souda.html" title="Souda">Souda</a> and Beritania gradually fell back along the lone road to Vitsilokoumos, just to the north of Sphakia. About halfway there, near the village of Askifou lay a large crater nicknamed "The Saucer." It was the only spot in the rugged terrain sufficiently wide and flat enough to support a large-scale air drop. Troops were stationed about its perimeter to prevent a German airborne force from landing to block the retreat. At the village of <a href="../../../s/t/i/Stilos.html" title="Stilos">Stilos</a>, the 5th New Zealand Brigade and the 2/7th Australian battalion held off a German mountain battalion which had begun a flanking manœuvre, but were forced to withdraw for lack of air and artillery support, despite their superior numbers. Fortunately for the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_and_New_Zealand_Army_Corps_3954.html" title="Australian and New Zealand Army Corps">Anzacs</a>, German air assets were being concentrated on Rethymnion and Heraklion, and they were able to retreat down the road safely in broad daylight.</p>

<p>The general retreat of the brigade was covered by two companies of the <a href="../../../m/%C4%81/o/M%C4%81ori_Battalion_c3db.html" title="Māori Battalion">28th (Māori) Battalion</a> under Captain Rangi Royal. Royal's men had already distinguished themselves in a ferocious <a href="../../../b/a/y/Bayonet.html" title="Bayonet">bayonet charge</a> on the morning of 27 May with the Australian 2/7th and <a href="../../../2/2F/8/2_8th_Australian_Infantry_Battalion_f965.html" title="2/8th Australian Infantry Battalion">2/8th Battalions</a> to keep "42nd Street" - a section of road between Souda and Chania - open when it was under threat from troops of the German 141st Mountain Regiment. They overran the 1st Battalion, 141st Gebirgsjäger Regiment and halted the German advance. When the main unit was safely to the rear, the Māoris in turn made their own fighting retreat of twenty-four miles, losing only two killed and eight wounded, all of whom they were able to carry to safety. Thus, the <a href="../../../l/a/y/Layforce.html" title="Layforce">Layforce</a> commando detachment was the only major unit in this area to be cut-off and unable to retreat.</p>

<p>Layforce had been sent into Crete via Sphakia when it was still hoped that large-scale reinforcements could be brought into Crete from Egypt to turn the tide of the battle. The battalion-sized force was split up, with a 200 man detachment under the unit's commander, <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Laycock_3f1c.html" title="Robert Laycock">Robert Laycock</a>, stationed at Souda to cover the retreat of the heavier units. Laycock's men, augmented by three of the remaining British tanks, were joined by the men of the 20th Heavy <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Aircraft_339f.html" title="Anti-Aircraft">Anti-Aircraft</a> Battery, who had been assigned to guard the Souda docks and refused to believe that a general evacuation had been ordered. After a day's fierce fighting, Laycock decided to retreat under cover of night to nearby Beritiana. He was joined there by Captain Royal and the Māoris, who took up separate defensive positions and eventually made their fighting retreat. Laycock and his force, however, were cut-off by superior German forces near the village of Babali Khani. Pummeled from the air by dive-bombers, Layforce Detachment was unable to get away. Laycock and his <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brigade_major.html" title="Brigade major">brigade major</a>, novelist <a href="../../../e/v/e/Evelyn_Waugh_d3c0.html" title="Evelyn Waugh">Evelyn Waugh</a> were able to escape by crashing through German lines in a tank. Most of the other men of the detachment and their comrades from the 20th were fated to be either killed or captured.</p>

<p>Major Alistair Hamilton, a company commander in the <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_Watch_993d.html" title="Black Watch">Black Watch</a>, had declared, "The Black Watch leaves Crete when the <a href="../../../s/n/o/Snow.html" title="Snow">snow</a> leaves <a href="../../../m/o/u/Mount_Ida_a5aa.html" title="Mount Ida">Mount Ida</a>." The major himself never left the island: he was killed by a <a href="../../../m/o/r/Mortar_%28weapon%29.html" title="Mortar (weapon)">mortar</a> bomb, but his men were ordered off, and reluctantly complied. The consensus among the men was they were letting their Greek allies down, and while most British heavy equipment was destroyed in order to keep it from falling into enemy hands, the men turned over their ammunition to the Cretans who were staying behind to resist the Germans.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Colonel Campbell, the commander at Heraklion, was also forced to surrender his contingent. Rethimno fell as well, and on the night of the 30th, German motorcycle troops linked up with Italian troops who had landed that day on the <a href="../../../g/u/l/Gulf_of_Mirabella_6af9.html" title="Gulf of Mirabella">Gulf of Mirabella</a>.

<p>Allied commanders were worried about the Germans using Crete as a "springboard" to further operations in the area, possibly a seaborne invasion of Egypt in support of the German/Italian forces operating from Libya. However, these fears were soon put to rest when <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Barbarossa_47da.html" title="Operation Barbarossa">Operation Barbarossa</a> opened, and it was clear that the German operation was defensive in nature.</p>
<p>Losses among the German paratroops were very high in <a href="../../../h/i/t/Hitler.html" title="Hitler">Hitler</a>'s opinion, and the Germans were forced to reconsider their airborne doctrine, which eliminated this weapon from large scale use in the <a href="../../../s/o/v/Soviet_Union_ad1f.html" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a>. Given the poor communications and airbase defences in the Soviet Union at the time, this can be considered a very serious setback, as it is likely that paratrooper operations would have been highly effective.</p>
<p>Ironically, the use of paratroopers in force impressed the Allies. The German casualty rate was hidden from Allied planners, who scrambled to create their own large airborne divisions after this battle.</p>
<p>A vigorous <a href="../../../r/e/s/Resistance_movement.html" title="Resistance movement">resistance campaign</a> was instituted almost immediately after the fall of the island and remained active until 1945. This campaign necessitated an Axis garrison of some 50,000 personnel at its peak — troops who could have been used to great effect in other theatres.</p>
<p>Winston Churchill gave a speech in which he made this famous statement: "Hence we shall not say that Greeks fight like heroes, but that heroes fight like Greeks."</p>

<p>The Germans admitted losses of 6,453 killed, missing, wounded and captured, but some believe the casualties to be higher. There are 4,465 marked German graves at Maleme — about three times the official number; an additional monument lists the names of three hundred German soldiers whose bodies could not be found. Allied soldiers claimed to have buried 900 German corpses in Rethimnon and 1,250 bodies at Heraklion by the fifth day of the battle — this is nearly the German amount <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winston_Churchill_74d2.html" title="Winston Churchill">Winston Churchill</a> claimed the Germans must have suffered well over 15,000 casualties, and <a href="../../../a/d/m/Admiral_Cunningham_c7c5.html" title="Admiral Cunningham">Admiral Cunningham</a> felt that the figure was more like 22,000. Buckley, based on British intelligence assumptions of two enemies wounded for every one killed, gave a cautious estimate of 16,800 total casualties, though these figures have not been confirmed.</p>
<p>Among the German dead were a trio of brothers, relatives of the <a href="../../../p/r/u/Prussia.html" title="Prussia">Prussian</a> general <a href="../../../g/e/b/Gebhard_Leberecht_von_Bl%C3%BCcher_361d.html" title="Gebhard Leberecht von Blücher">Gebhard Leberecht von Blücher</a> of <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Waterloo_202f.html" title="Battle of Waterloo">Waterloo</a> fame. The first to fall was <a href="../../../g/r/a/Graf.html" title="Graf">Count</a> Leberecht von Blücher, who was attempting to resupply his brother, <a href="../../../l/i/e/Lieutenant.html" title="Lieutenant">Lieutenant</a> Wolfgang von Blücher, with ammunition when the latter and his <a href="../../../p/l/a/Platoon.html" title="Platoon">platoon</a> were surrounded by members of the Black Watch. Leberecht had commandeered a horse which he attempted to gallop through British lines; he almost reached his brother's position, and in fact was shot before the count's very eyes. The next day, the second brother was killed, followed by the youngest brother, Hans-Joachim, who was reported killed in action a few days later but whose body was never recovered. For years afterward, Cretan villagers report seeing a ghostly rider galloping at night down a road near the spot where Leberecht was shot; yet until they were told the story of the von Blücher brothers, they had assumed that he was British.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Allies lost 3,500 soldiers: 1,751 dead, with an equal number wounded, and an enormous number captured (12,254 Commonwealth and 5,255 Greek). There were also 1,828 dead and 183 wounded among the Royal Navy.</p>
<p>A large number of civilians were killed in the crossfire or died fighting as <a href="../../../p/a/r/Partisan_%28military%29.html" title="Partisan (military)">partisans</a>. Many Cretans were shot by the Germans in reprisals, both during the battle and in the occupation that followed. One Cretan source puts the number of Cretans killed by German action during the war at 6,593 men, 1,113 women and 869 children.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Attacks by German planes, mainly Ju-87 and Ju-88, destroyed a number of British ships: three <a href="../../../c/r/u/Cruiser.html" title="Cruiser">cruisers</a> (<i><a href="../../../h/m/s/HMS_Gloucester_%28C62%29_84a5.html" title="HMS Gloucester (C62)">Gloucester</a>, <a href="../../../h/m/s/HMS_Fiji_%28C58%29_ec16.html" title="HMS Fiji (C58)">Fiji</a> and Calcutta</i>) and six <a href="../../../d/e/s/Destroyer.html" title="Destroyer">destroyers</a> (<i>Kelly, Greyhound, Kashmir, Hereward, Imperial and Juno</i>). Seven other ships were damaged, including the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battleship.html" title="Battleship">battleships</a> <i>Warspite</i> and <i>Valiant,</i> and the cruiser <i>Orion</i>.</p>
<p>The loss of Crete, particularly as a result of the failure of the British land forces to recognise the strategic importance of the airfields, served as a wake-up call for the British Government. As a direct consequence, the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Air_Force_e156.html" title="Royal Air Force">Royal Air Force</a> (RAF) was given responsibility for defending its own bases from ground and air attack. The <a href="../../../r/a/f/RAF_Regiment_bd69.html" title="RAF Regiment">RAF Regiment</a> was formed on February 1, 1942 to meet this requirement.</p>
