<p>I removed these, and I must warn you; I think this guy just made these up. For example, when he says "Roslin and Billy are taken prisoner", we have actually heard who is going to be hostage in that episode and Roslin ain't one of them. In addition, for "Scar", he says that the Cylon ace pilot kills 20 Colonial pilots; that's HALF of the pilots they have! Galactica itself only has like 30 pilots left, and even if these were doubled by the addition of Pegasus, this would mean that in a single episode, a single Cylon would kill more pilots than have ever died since the show BEGAN! Preposterous. Further, he made up this ENTIRE storyline about "Pegasus returning to the Colonies to liberate survivors"; excuse me, but we've heard descriptions of *ALL* episodes until the season 2 finale, and there is NOTHING about this in there!! And this whole thing about Anders resistance, Starbuck being pregnant, Ander's sacrificing himself; NO information anywhere even remotely supports this, and most of our current info CONTRADICTS this! And HOW would the ressurection ship being destroyed affect the pregnant Sharon?! She wasn't PLANNING on dying, as this would kill her child in her current body! ON TOP OF THIS, for the Cylon "peace offering" at the end of Season 2, he says that Leoben will be sent; this isn't even current; NEW news said that instead of Leoben, it will now be a Number Six and a Sharon. Yikes. Don't be afraid, base NONE of your expectations for season 2 on the garbage this guy made. --Ricimer 19:10, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Presence of "Spoilers</span></h2>
<p>Hi. Really don't want to get involved in anything contentious, but I'd appreciate if something could be cleared up for me (Or perhaps I could get a consensus of opinion). I recall a little earlier in the history of this article, there were "spoilers" (Read: descriptions of plot events yet to come) ... this was during the first half of season 2. Also, a warning of potential spoilers / plot details is placed DIRECTLY in this article at the top of the section (which I think is a good idea).</p>
<p>So, what I'm getting at is: given that this isn't a sci-fi blog / fan site [which I'm not putting down, since I love sites like that&#160;:)], but rather, an informational encyclopedic article, shouldn't we be including all verifiable information that is available?</p>
<p>I'm strongly thinking that we should, and that includes the fact that two additional plot lines are the President's struggle with cancer and the peace offer by the Cylons. But, this is really a more general issue.</p>
<p>I'm interested in responses / thoughts. --141.161.69.157 00:27, January 19, 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Nobody is censoring this information. I just personally don't think it belongs in THIS particular article, whose purpose is general encyclopedic information about a television show, not about "what happens next". If you so desperately want the information to be available, create a seperate article: Battlestar Galactica (spoilers) or something along those lines. By all means, go ahead. Include as much relevant information as you wish on the topic of future storylines. For the rest of us, we're trying to put together an article on the CURRENT television show, not the as-yet-unseen version of it, and this article most certainly does not exist to "spoil" the show for everybody, despite the fact that there's a spoiler warning on the page. That warning applies only for things that are already well-known by viewers but not by those who haven't seen the show yet. --<a href="../../../i/l/y/User%7EIlyag_60d0.html" title="User:Ilyag">Ilyag</a> 05:49, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks for the input. Don't get defensive, i.e. "For the rest of us, we're trying to put together an article on the CURRENT television show, not the as-yet-unseen version of it, and this article most certainly does not exist to "spoil" the show for everybody" I'm just a wayward Galactica fan wondering why we can't put info about story arcs that are known as true within the Galactica article, no matter whether they've aired or not. But I'll definitely defer to the community. Keep up the good work on the article that ALL OF US can enjoy -- leave those "rest of us" at home&#160;;)</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>wondering why we can't put info about story arcs that are known as true</i> -- Nothing is "known as true" until an episode actually airs. Shows can be changed/pulled/reordered at any time, so things only become canon once they've actually aired.

<ul>
<li>Note It is in fact Metamorphosis One as done by Bear McCreary. The beginning is not as bold as the one done by Glass and thus resembles Metamorphosis Five. The greatest distinction is in the end of One versus that of Five. One has an ending that sounds like it "steps down" the scale before fading out, whereas Five continues it's pattern and fades out bit by bit. This "step down" can be identified in the last two instances of the song in the episode "Valley of Darkness".</li>

<p>I've just reverted a change regarding the military rank of Major. First of all, we know that Doctor Cottle has the rank of major. Secondly, Ron Moore <a href="http://blog.scifi.com/battlestar/archives/2005/02/index.html#a000020" class="external text" title="http://blog.scifi.com/battlestar/archives/2005/02/index.html#a000020" rel="nofollow">states in his blog</a> that the rank exists, so we may yet meet more majors in the future. -- <a href="../../../s/c/j/User%7EScjessey_ab91.html" title="User:Scjessey">Scjessey</a> 14:32, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Absolutely not. First, the edit already says "besides Dr. Cottle, there are no majors" so Dr. Cottle is already covered there. Nextly, the RANK exists, but there were no majors on GALACTICA. All of the majors were on other ships. Case in point, command succession went from Colonel Tigh to Captain Kelly, who served as first officer at the beginning of season 3 when Tigh was in command. RDM's blog post proves nothing about whether there were Majors <i>physically on the ship</i>, just that such a rank exists. I'm reverting this edit back. Be more careful in the future.--Ricimer 20:44, 26 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Forgive me for saying so, but that doesn't make any sense. How can you <i>know</i> there are no other majors? We know the rank exists because of (a) the Doctor, and (b) RDM's blog. There is no way to categorically say there are no other majors, because you have no evidence one way or another. Captain Kelly may have been <i>preferred</i> by Colonel Tigh over another choice - there is nothing to say that the Captain became the first officer automatically. Also, there hasn't even <i>been</i> a season 3 - we are just over halfway through the <b>second</b> season.

<p><b>Merger</b>: I didn't put the merger tag on the article but think it's valid. We wouldn't hive off Friends series 1, 2, 3 etc. and give each seperate articles.

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Makes no sense</span></h3>
<p>We are not talking about separating seasons - all seasons of the television series appear in this article already. We are talking about merging the article on the 2004 television series with the article that discusses the reimagined <i>Battlestar Galactica</i> universe. That would be like merging <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Wars_fcb0.html" title="Star Wars">Star Wars</a> (a general article about the saga) with <a href="../../../r/e/t/Star_Wars_Episode_VI%7E_Return_of_the_Jedi_e410.html" title="Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi">Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi</a> (an article about a specific part of the Star Wars saga). The merger makes no sense in either case. Consider what we actually have:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../b/a/t/Battlestar_Galactica_%282003%29_9620.html" title="Battlestar Galactica (2003)"><i>Battlestar Galactica</i> (2003)</a>

<p>Not really, because <i>Star Wars</i> is such a vast universe that the universe itself can be discussed in terms of all the various incarnations under one article, and each of the larger examples of those can merit their own articles. There is certainly enough distinct info for each of the six feature films to merit individual articles for those. But with <i>BG</i>, the <i>only two</i> incarnations of the BG universe are the miniseries and the ongoing series. You don't need both individual articles for the mini and the ongoing <i><b>and</b></i> one for the universe itself. Any article on the universe could simply be a merger of the info on the mini and the ongoing. And if each of those two is so distinct and expansive that they merit their own, then, IMO, you don't need a separate one for the universe itself, which would be superfluous. <a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENightscream_713e.html" title="User:Nightscream">Nightscream</a> 03:14, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Perhaps you are right, but surely you can see that we are talking about merging the <i>wrong</i> articles at least? I think the mythology and information surrounding <i>Battlestar Galactica</i> will begin to rival <i>Star Wars</i> and <i>Star Trek</i> in the future. That would lead to a re-splitting of any merged articles. Anyway, since the article was split in the first place, I think it should remain the way it is until/unless a significant number of Wikipedians call for a merger. So far, we only have 2 votes <b>for</b> a merger, and 2 votes <b>against</b> (if you include the AOL user). -- <a href="../../../s/c/j/User%7EScjessey_ab91.html" title="User:Scjessey">Scjessey</a> 12:40, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The second paragraph offers no references for "fan criticism", or for comments by Ronald D. Moore regarding the quality of the work.

<p>Moore's comments on the quality of the show, having expanded from 13 to 20 episodes per season order, can be found among his many blog entries on SciFi.com. That statement within the article can, and should, remain; however, most if not all references to public reaction - bulletin boards immediately come to mind here - probably ought to be deleted. Without sources they're simply arguments to assertion, despite the fact that some episodes did receive a less-than-glowing response. Yet it's mostly unsourceable - do you cite individual bulletin boards to prove the claim? Opinions there most definately aren't unified, even on episodes like "Black Market". Do you select individual posts, and if so, why, and which ones? If you select three BBS' to cite, and yet you miss a fourth one heavily frequented by BSG fans - Television Without Pity, for example - how can you justify it? You'll always miss one board. And at the baseline, each and every one of the "polls" taken at these sites are unscientific. Gpotter511@yahoo.com 05:13, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Why does this article seem to have separated season 2 into two halfs, season 2 and season 2.5? It's all season 2. Yes there was a break between the halves when shown on US television but that's always the case isn't it? Also just because the DVDs are being released as two box sets doesn't make the season two real halves, it's just following the DVD release model that has become commonplace in other countries. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBen_W_Bell_a229.html" title="User:Ben W Bell">Ben W Bell</a> 07:45, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It is a little ambiguous. The show was produced in two ten-episode blocks, which were written and shot in entirely seperate production blocks, but it is still technically referred to as Season 2. It is a different production model from the usual, and the television community (both viewers and network) are often confused by anything different. Still, I think it is probably accurate to treat them as two halfs, since that is how they were produced and how they were aired. It might become more common-- the same thing is happening next season with Lost. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarkingdoc_2a20.html" title="User:Barkingdoc">BarkingDoc</a> 21:09, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Does anyone think its a good idea that all the Cylon characters (sans Six and Sharon) were merged into the main Cylon article, when they all previously had their own articles?

<p>Each of those characters have made only a handful of appearances in the show, and their bios contained no information that wasn't already in the episode summaries we also had. If we want the BSG articles to be high-quality it's easier to contain them to a smaller number of merged articles rather than letting them sprawl across multiple stubs with poor writing and sourcing. I'd also like to take this opportunity to mention that if anyone wants to develop an in-depth, comprehensive guide to "Battlestar Galactica", <a href="http://battlestarwiki.org" class="external text" title="http://battlestarwiki.org" rel="nofollow">Battlestar Wiki</a> is a wonderful source I have contributed to. When I get to the point where I add cites and references to these articles I'll probably reference it heavily as it makes a great secondary source (the primary source being the episodes themselves). Wikipedia itself, by the way, is supposed to be a *tertiary* source, compiling information that's already been compiled by the secondary sources. — <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilwelch_fd5e.html" title="User:Philwelch">Philwelch</a> <a href="../../../p/h/i/User_talk%7EPhilwelch_8d58.html" title="User talk:Philwelch">t</a> 19:29, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Okay, what information do we have about these characters that isn't present (or wouldn't be better placed) either in the main Cylon article or in the episode articles? The biographical articles I redirected were basically plot summaries of episodes the characters appeared in describing what they did. Issues like Cavil's atheism, Leoben's mysticism, etc. are simple enough that they can be (and are) adequately represented in this article. Biographical articles should focus not on plot but on *character*, and so far, none of these minor characters have been developed enough to warrant that sort of sprawl. (Characters like Adama, Starbuck, and Six are complex enough that they *should* be explored better in separate articles, on the other hand.) I wouldn't be opposed to giving D'anna/Three her own article once we have information to populate it with (which should be during Season Three), but we don't have enough information as of yet to expand that way. We're all fans of the show here; what would we rather have, a hundred poorly written and cited stubs, or maybe 15-20 articles that are up to GA/FA status? Merging smaller articles on minor characters is how we get from one place to another. — <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilwelch_fd5e.html" title="User:Philwelch">Philwelch</a> <a href="../../../p/h/i/User_talk%7EPhilwelch_8d58.html" title="User talk:Philwelch">t</a> 20:34, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There isn't a consensus opposing the redirect. There hasn't even been a *discussion* yet. (Keep in mind that my reading of the consensus is not only trying to reflect the opinions expressed here, but also the opinions I've heard expressed elsewhere in the community regarding general community standards.) While copyediting is rather nice of you, the fact is that article quality tends to degrade unless articles are aggressively maintained, and it's easier to aggressively maintain a smaller number of articles. There's also the fact that, as it stands now, pretty much all of the Battlestar Galactica articles are filled with <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>. If we can find sources like Battlestarwiki to cite we can get these articles up to WP standards, but it'll take awhile.

<p>Part of Wikipedia being a tertiary source (i.e. an encyclopedia) is that in-depth analysis is generally left to secondary sources (i.e. BattlestarWiki). A lot of information presented in, for instance, the articles on minor Cylon characters wouldn't be merged *here* so much as to the episode summary articles (if need be). Another important factor is that Wikipedia articles on fictional entities should describe their relevance to the real world. BSG has a lot of room for this (as multiple published sources have drawn parallels with contemporary issues). A good expression of this posted by Mark Gallager on the mailing list:</p>
<dl>
<dd>There's three approaches I've seen taken towards fictional worlds:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>The GUNDAM approach. This is: "Here, have some stastistics about our ships. which are really cool. They do 120 points of damage each throw!"</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>The STAR WARS approach. This is: "Okay, we all know that /Star Wars/ isn't real, and our guidelines on context and dealing with fiction oblige us to tell you that. Nevertheless, we'll pretend that it is, so you will not be able to understand this article unless you're prepared for that. Now, here's what the books tell you about /Star Wars/ --- what, you didn't know the books were more important than the films? You silly sausage! What follows is a biography of Wedge Antilles, who you've probably never even heard of, you prat."</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>The DOCTOR WHO approach. This is: "/Doctor Who/ is a television programme. One of its fictional creatures is a Dalek. The Dalek design was inspired by a pepper pot, or something, I dunno, and it's significant in the real world for &lt;X reasons/&gt;. In the /Doctor Who/ universe, the Dalek is &lt;explain Dalek on-show/&gt;."</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Now, the GUNDAM approach is impossible to understand if you aren't already a die-hard freak. The STAR WARS approach meets our guidelines (therefore, your "what policy?" approach is well satisfied) but is bloody difficult for someone who hasn't read the novels, watched the cartoons, and studied the website as if prospecting for gold, to understand --- imagine a /Star Trek/ article that gave Captain Kirk's birth and time-of-thriving only as stardates and based his early life "biography" on obscure comments from Gene Roddenberry. The DOCTOR WHO approach is *exactly* what we want to see: non-fans are able to find out what the hell is going on, and not required to live in the fictional universe the article describes</dd>
</dl>
<p>The BSG-space on Wikipedia seems somewhere between the Star Wars and Doctor Who approach, depending on which article we're looking at. I'd like to move it more towards Doctor Who. — <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilwelch_fd5e.html" title="User:Philwelch">Philwelch</a> <a href="../../../p/h/i/User_talk%7EPhilwelch_8d58.html" title="User talk:Philwelch">t</a> 21:34, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I can't speak for the other Cylon characters, but we know for a fact that the Number Three character is going to be big in season three. I don't see why we have to hold on her article until season three actually happens, since she's already appeared in the series (its not like she's a character who people have talked about, but hasn't appeared yet). Also, her character is notable in that she's been garnering a lot of press. <a href="http://www.lucylawless.info/battlestar-galactica/index.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.lucylawless.info/battlestar-galactica/index.php" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>
<p>There was some talk on eventually redirecting Helena Cain's page as well; while she only appeared in three episodes, in those three episodes she was a major character with a big impact on everyone else; its not like a minor character like Gaeta or Billy. I don't think she should be redirected either (though her article does need to be cleaned up, as it's really a one-sided view on her). --<a href="../../../d/r/b/User%7EDrBat_c7e7.html" title="User:DrBat">DrBat</a> 23:24, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The reason we should wait until the third season to expand D'anna's bio is that we don't have enough information about the character because she's only appeared in two episodes. You can't expand an article if you don't have content to expand it with.

<dd>This is not an appropriate time or place for further discussion of Phil; please stick to the article, ANI, or user talk pages.</dd>
<dd>That said, it's not unusual for experienced editors to boldy redirect or merge; however, I think what we see here is clearly a lack of consensus supporting such a move. When boldness collides with a lack of consensus, lack of consensus wins, and some discussion is called for. Phil has a valid point; so do the rest of you. Wait until he gets back and then talk amongst yourselves for a while until something makes sense.</dd>

<li>Definitely. They contain useful information about notable characters from a very popular series. Editors worked hard to create these articles, their work shouldn't be thrown away. <a href="../../../d/i/o/User%7EDionyseus_52e5.html" title="User:Dionyseus">Dionyseus</a> 05:29, 20 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Additionally, these characters are notable, they pass the "Notable actors and television personalities who have appeared in well-known films or television productions" criteria of <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. <a href="../../../d/i/o/User%7EDionyseus_52e5.html" title="User:Dionyseus">Dionyseus</a> 18:58, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>They absolutely should have their own articles. I can't believe this is even an issue. As it is the Cylon and BSG articles are getting too long, and this would make THAT situation worse while eliminating other articles that have the ability to be much more thorough. <a href="../../../v/i/g/User%7EVigilancePrime_1989.html" title="User:VigilancePrime">VigilancePrime</a> 16:34, 20 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Further, if the Cylon characters are congealed into the BSG article, what is to prevent the same with regular characters? Where is the line drawn? Starbuck and Apollo also included with the main article? Tyrol perhaps? No, each character that has been significant (and I would even consider Cavil one of those) ought to have their own article. It'd be better to have a primary article with a bunch of shorter supporting articles than one single, conglomerate, oversized, uber-lengthy monster article. <a href="../../../v/i/g/User%7EVigilancePrime_1989.html" title="User:VigilancePrime">VigilancePrime</a> 04:02, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Yes, at least with Number Three. Also, possibly with Leoben (who had a big impact on Kara's character, and is going to appear in season three as well). --<a href="../../../d/r/b/User%7EDrBat_c7e7.html" title="User:DrBat">DrBat</a> 17:12, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Yes. Unencyclopedic detail would include a discussion of their wardrobe. Fleshing out the characters from a notable TV series is not unencyclopedic detail. They are named characters that show up several times, as with <a href="../../../d/r/2E/Dr._Selar_75dd.html" title="Dr. Selar">Dr. Selar</a> from <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Trek_7a4f.html" title="Star Trek">Star Trek</a>.

<li>Definitely. They contain trivial information out of proportion to their importance to the show. The <a href="../../../b/r/o/Brother_Cavil_f068.html" title="Brother Cavil">Brother_Cavil</a> is particularly bad, being not much more than an extended plot summary gussied up with an infobox and a zillion categories. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 07:11, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I saw this matter pop up at A/NI and thought I'd pop over for a look. I don't see any reason for those to have more than a paragraph on the main page.

<li>This is a tough one, but I think the articles for individual Cylons are <b>not needed</b> (besides <a href="../../../n/u/m/Number_Six_%28Battlestar_Galactica%29_6767.html" title="Number Six (Battlestar Galactica)">#6</a> and <a href="../../../s/h/a/Sharon_Valerii_1f57.html" title="Sharon Valerii">Sharon Valerii</a>).

I think that giving <a href="../../../n/u/m/Number_Three_65ff.html" title="Number Three">Number Three</a> her own article is a bit much as well, although I can understand that the eleventy-billion <a href="../../../l/u/c/Lucy_Lawless_32e1.html" title="Lucy Lawless">Lucy Lawless</a> fans will be upset about that. Although Number Three is to appear in a 10-episode arc, she is still only going to be a supporting character. I don't think we need articles for <a href="../../../c/y/_/Cy_%28Cylon%29_36d3.html" title="Cy (Cylon)">Cy</a> or <a href="../../../s/c/a/Scar_%28Cylon%29_895e.html" title="Scar (Cylon)">Scar</a> either.

<dd>You are missing the point. My reasons for wishing to see at least <i>some</i> merging of all these individual Cylon articles is based on how I interpret the <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28fiction%29_a12e.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (fiction)">Wikipedia guidelines on the matter</a>. I agree that a few of the Cylon characters are notable enough to warrant their own articles, but certainly not <i>all</i> of them, and definitely not those particular "models" under discussion (<a href="../../../a/a/r/Aaron_Doral_ec7e.html" title="Aaron Doral">Aaron_Doral</a>, <a href="../../../b/r/o/Brother_Cavil_f068.html" title="Brother Cavil">Brother_Cavil</a>, and <a href="../../../l/e/o/Leoben_Conoy_d753.html" title="Leoben Conoy">Leoben_Conoy</a>). Remember that perfectly acceptable articles already exist (see <a href="http://www.battlestarwiki.org/wiki/Leoben_Conoy" class="external text" title="http://www.battlestarwiki.org/wiki/Leoben_Conoy" rel="nofollow">example</a>) on the <a href="http://www.battlestarwiki.org/wiki/Main_Page" class="external text" title="http://www.battlestarwiki.org/wiki/Main_Page" rel="nofollow">Battlestar Wiki</a>, and there is no need for needless repetition. -- <a href="../../../s/c/j/User%7EScjessey_ab91.html" title="User:Scjessey">Scjessey</a> 13:03, 20 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I can <i>sort of</i> accept that <a href="../../../n/u/m/Number_Three_65ff.html" title="Number Three">Number Three</a> will probably be worthy of a separate article, but only on the basis of <b>future production</b>.

<dd>Actually at the moment there is, the fact the writers have said so warrants notability.

<dl>
<dd>The fact that she actually hasn't made actual appearances in the new arc puts her character's notability squarely in the middle of "crystal-ball" territory, so until she actually appears in the actual episodes, any expanded content is going to be breathlessly reported rumors from fansites and bits of speculation gleaned from Ronald Moore interviews, handwaving about "Wikipedia is not paper!

<dd><i>4) It is often informative to include <b>plot summaries</b> (and other <a href="../../../s/p/o/Wikipedia%7ESpoiler_warning_6b56.html" title="Wikipedia:Spoiler warning">spoilers</a>) in articles on works of fiction. However, please keep them reasonably short, as the point of Wikipedia is to describe the works, not simply summarize them. It is generally appropriate for a plot summary to remain part of the main article, not a lengthy page of its own. In some cases, sub-articles and lists are created when the potential for an</i> encyclopedic coverage <i>is hindered by the</i> recommended length guidelines <i>of one article. Please see the <a href="../../../f/i/c/Wikipedia%7EFiction_37b0.html#Making_good_use_of_Wikibooks_and_Wikisource" title="Wikipedia:Fiction">Making good use of Wikibooks and Wikisource</a> section below for guidance and examples.</i></dd>

<dd>That last one applies to the gussied-up plot summary that make up most of the articles in question. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 00:53, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks Charles. Apparently from the 4 criteria Calton listed, these articles pass at least the first one and the second. Note the "The list(s) should contain all characters, races, places, etc. from the work of fiction, with links to those that have their own articles." from the second criteria. In other words, that list would be <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Battlestar_Galactica_characters_0f8f.html" title="List of Battlestar Galactica characters">List_of_Battlestar_Galactica_characters</a>, and as you can see it contains links to characters that contain their own articles. <a href="../../../d/i/o/User%7EDionyseus_52e5.html" title="User:Dionyseus">Dionyseus</a> 01:27, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
