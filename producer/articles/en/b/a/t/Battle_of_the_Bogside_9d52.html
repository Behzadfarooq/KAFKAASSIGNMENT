<p>Tensions had been building in Derry for over a year before the battle of the Bogside. In part, this was due to long standing grievances held by much of the city's population. Derry had a majority Catholic and <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_nationalist.html" title="Irish nationalist">Irish nationalist</a> population but, after the <a href="../../../p/a/r/Partition_of_Ireland_6ee0.html" title="Partition of Ireland">partition of Ireland</a> in 1921, had been ruled by the <a href="../../../u/n/i/Unionist_%28Ireland%29_9310.html" title="Unionist (Ireland)">unionist</a> government of <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northern_Ireland_a52b.html" title="Northern Ireland">Northern Ireland</a>. Unionists maintained political control of Derry by two means. Firstly, they allocated public housing in such a way as to keep the Catholic population in a limited number of electoral wards, with the result that, despite casting more votes, nationalists returned only one candidate from Derry to the <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northern_Ireland_Parliament_80e4.html" title="Northern Ireland Parliament">Northern Ireland Parliament</a>, while unionists returned two. This housing policy had the additional effect of creating a housing shortage for Catholics. Secondly, only rate payers were entitled to vote in local elections. As Protestants tended to be richer than Catholics, this meant that unionists also controlled Derry's local government. Catholics also alleged discrimination in employment.</p>
<p>In March 1968, a small number of radicals in the city founded the <a href="../../../d/e/r/Derry_Housing_Action_Committee_bdad.html" title="Derry Housing Action Committee">Derry Housing Action Committee</a>, with the intention of forcing the government of Northern Ireland to change their housing policies. This group was founded principally by local members of the <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northern_Ireland_Labour_Party_c431.html" title="Northern Ireland Labour Party">Northern Ireland Labour Party</a>, such as <a href="../../../e/a/m/Eamonn_McCann_e802.html" title="Eamonn McCann">Eamonn McCann</a> and members of the <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Connolly_651c.html" title="James Connolly">James Connolly</a> Republican Club (the Northern manifestation of <a href="../../../s/i/n/Sinn_Fein_8f5c.html" title="Sinn Fein">Sinn Fein</a>, which was banned in Northern Ireland). The Housing Action Committee took <a href="../../../d/i/r/Direct_action.html" title="Direct action">direct action</a> such as blocking roads and invading local council meetings in order to force them to house Catholic families who were on council's housing waiting list for a long time. By the summer of 1968, this group had linked up with the <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northern_Ireland_Civil_Rights_Association_fd88.html" title="Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association">Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association</a> and were agitating for a broader programme of reform within Northern Ireland. On October 18, 1968, these activists organised a march through the centre of Derry. However, the demonstration was banned and when the marchers, including members of Parliament <a href="../../../e/d/d/Eddie_McAteer_7937.html" title="Eddie McAteer">Eddie McAteer</a> and <a href="../../../i/v/a/Ivan_Cooper_ce27.html" title="Ivan Cooper">Ivan Cooper</a>, defied this ban they were batoned by the RUC. The RUC's actions were televised and caused widespread anger in nationalist circles. The following day, 4000 people demonstrated in solidarity with the marchers in Guildhall Square in the centre of Derry. This march passed off peacefully, as did another demonstration attended by up to 15,000 people on November 16. However, these incidents proved to be the start of an escalating pattern of civil unrest, that culminated in the events of August 1969.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>In January 1969, a march by the radical group <a href="../../../p/e/o/People%27s_Democracy_d65c.html" title="People's Democracy">People's Democracy</a> from <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belfast.html" title="Belfast">Belfast</a> to Derry was attacked by <a href="../../../l/o/y/Loyalists.html" title="Loyalists">loyalists</a> at Burntollet, five miles outside Derry. When the marchers (many of whom were injured) arrived in Derry on January 5, rioting broke out between their supporters and the RUC, who were seen to have failed to protect the march. That night, RUC members broke into homes in the Catholic Bogside area and assaulted several residents. An inquiry led by Lord Cameron concluded that, "a number of policemen were guilty of misconduct, which involved assault and battery, malicious damage to property...and the use of provocative <a href="../../../s/e/c/Sectarian.html" title="Sectarian">sectarian</a> and political slogans".<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> After this point, <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barricade.html" title="Barricade">barricades</a> were set up in the Bogside and <a href="../../../v/i/g/Vigilante.html" title="Vigilante">vigilante</a> patrols organised to keep the RUC out. It was at this point that famous slogan "You are now entering <a href="../../../f/r/e/Free_Derry_16c2.html" title="Free Derry">Free Derry</a>" was painted on the corner of Columbs street by a local activist named John Casey.</p>
<p>On April 19, 1969, the first death arising out of the violence between nationalists in Derry and the RUC took place. After a riot between Bogside youths and the RUC, a local man, Samuel Devenny, died from injuries received in a beating he took from the RUC members who broke into his home. His teenage daughters were also beaten in the attack. After further rioting on <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Twelfth_0d62.html" title="The Twelfth">July 12</a>, arising out of the <a href="../../../o/r/a/Orange_Order_4694.html" title="Orange Order">Orange Order</a> parades on that day, <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_Republican_1080.html" title="Irish Republican">Irish Republicans</a> in Derry set up the Derry Citizen's Defence Association, with the intention of preparing for future disturbances. The members of the DCDA were initially Republican Club (and possibly <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_Republican_Army_%281922-1969%29_80f4.html" title="Irish Republican Army (1922-1969)">IRA</a>) activists, but they were joined by many other left wing activists and local people. This group stated their aim as firstly to keep the peace, but if this failed, to organise the defence of the Bogside. To this end, they stockpiled materials for barricades and missiles, ahead of the <a href="../../../a/p/p/Apprentice_Boys_of_Derry_e587.html" title="Apprentice Boys of Derry">Apprentice Boys of Derry</a> march on August 12.</p>

<p>The Apprentice Boys parade on August 12 commemorated the Protestant victory in the <a href="../../../s/i/e/Siege_of_Derry_f725.html" title="Siege of Derry">Siege of Derry</a> in 1689 and was considered highly provocative by many Catholics. Although the march did not pass through the Bogside, it passed close to it at the junction of Waterloo Place and Williams street. It was here that trouble was expected to and did break out.</p>
<p>On the 12th of August, clashes occurred as the Apprentice Boys parade approached the Bogside at Williams street. Initially taunts were exchanged between the loyalists and Bogsiders. Stones were then thrown from both sides for a period, before the police forced the nationalists into Rossville street and the Bogside itself, they were followed by local loyalists, at which point the rioting escalated. Large crowds turned out and pelted the police and the mob with stones and <a href="../../../p/e/t/Petrol_bomb.html" title="Petrol bomb">petrol bombs</a>, and set up barricades to block their progress.</p>

<p>The defence of the Bogside was coordinated to some extent. The Derry Citizens Defence Association set up a headquarters in the house of Paddy Doherty in Westland street and tried to supervise the making of petrol bombs and the positioning of barricades. They also set up "Radio Free Derry". However, many local people joined in the rioting on their own initiative and impromptu leaders also emerged, such as <a href="../../../b/e/r/Bernadette_Devlin_6af9.html" title="Bernadette Devlin">Bernadette Devlin</a>, Eamonn McCann and others.</p>
<p>Locals youths climbed onto the roof of the High Flats on Rossville street, from where they bombarded the RUC below with missiles. When the advantage that this position possessed was realised, the youths were kept supplied with stones and petrol bombs. The RUC were in many respects badly prepared for the "battle". Their <a href="../../../r/i/o/Riot_shield.html" title="Riot shield">riot shields</a> were too small and did not protect their whole bodies. In addition, their uniforms were not flame resistant and a number were badly burned by petrol bombs. They possessed <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armoured_cars.html" title="Armoured cars">armoured cars</a> and guns, but were not permitted to use them. Moreover, there was no system in place to relieve officers, with the result that the same policemen had to serve in the rioting for three days without rest. The police responded to this situation by flooding the area with <a href="../../../c/s/_/CS_gas_c912.html" title="CS gas">CS gas</a>, which caused a range of respiratory injuries among the local people. A total of 1,091 canisters containing 12.5g of CS; and 14 canisters containing 50g of CS, were released in the densely populated residential area.<sup id="_ref-Bsunday_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Bsunday" title="">[2]</a></sup> After two days of almost continuous rioting, during which police were drafted in from all over Northern Ireland, the RUC were exhausted, and were snatching sleep in doorways whenever the opportunity allowed.</p>
<p>On August 13, <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_Lynch_b953.html" title="Jack Lynch">Jack Lynch</a>, <a href="../../../t/a/o/Taoiseach.html" title="Taoiseach">Taoiseach</a> of the <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republic_of_Ireland_10e7.html" title="Republic of Ireland">Republic of Ireland</a> made a televised speech about the events in Derry, in which he said that he, "could not stand by and watch innocent people injured and perhaps worse." He promised to send the <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_Army_0071.html" title="Irish Army">Irish Army</a> to the border and to set up field hospitals for those injured in the fighting. Lynch's words were widely interpreted in the Bogside as promising that Irish troops were about to be sent to their aid. Unionists were appalled at this prospect, which they saw as a threatened invasion of Northern Ireland. In fact, although the Irish army was indeed sent to the border, they restricted their activities to providing medical care for the injured.</p>
<p>By August 14, the rioting in the Bogside had reached a critical point. Almost the entire community there had been mobilised by this point, many galvanised by false rumours that St Eugene's Cathedral had been attacked by the police. The RUC were also beginning to use deadly force. Two rioters were shot and injured in Great James' Street. The <a href="../../../b/-/s/B-Specials_b818.html" title="B-Specials">B-Specials</a>, an auxiliary, mostly Protestant police force, much feared by Catholics for their role in sectarian killings in the 1920s, were called up and sent to Derry, provoking fears of a massacre on the part of the Bogsiders.</p>
<p>On the afternoon of the 14th, the <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prime_Minister_of_Northern_Ireland_867f.html" title="Prime Minister of Northern Ireland">Prime Minister of Northern Ireland</a>, <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Chichester-Clarke_37f9.html" title="James Chichester-Clarke">James Chichester-Clarke</a>, took the unprecedented step of requesting the British <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom_dd87.html" title="Prime Minister of the United Kingdom">Prime Minister</a> <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harold_Wilson_2456.html" title="Harold Wilson">Harold Wilson</a> for <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_army.html" title="British army">troops</a> to be sent to Derry. Soon afterwards a company of the <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prince_of_Wales%27s_Own_Regiment_of_Yorkshire_a5ec.html" title="Prince of Wales's Own Regiment of Yorkshire">Prince of Wales Own Regiment</a> relieved the police, with orders to separate the RUC and the Bogsiders, but not to attempt to breach the barricades and enter the Bogside itself. This marked the first direct intervention of the <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a> government in Ireland since <a href="../../../p/a/r/Partition_of_Ireland_6ee0.html" title="Partition of Ireland">partition</a>. The British troops were at first welcomed by the Bogside residents as a neutral force compared to the RUC and especially the B-Specials. Only a handful of radicals in Bogside, notably Bernadette Devlin, opposed the deployment of British troops. This good relationship did not last long however, as the <a href="../../../t/r/o/Troubles.html" title="Troubles">Troubles</a> escalated. Over 1000 people had been injured in the rioting in Derry, but no one was killed. A total of 691 RUC men were deployed in Derry during the riot, of whom only 255 were still in action at 12.30 on the 15th. Manpower then fluctuated for the rest of the afternoon: the numbers recorded are 318, 304, 374, 333, 285 and finally 327 at 5.30 p.m. While some of the fluctuation in numbers can be put down to exhaustion rather than injury, these figures indicate that the RUC suffered at least 350 serious injuries. How many Bogsiders were injured is unclear, as many injuries were never reported.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>

<p>A call by the <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northern_Ireland_Civil_Rights_Association_fd88.html" title="Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association">Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association</a> for people to stretch police resources to aid the Bogsiders led to rioting in <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belfast.html" title="Belfast">Belfast</a> and elsewhere, which left five <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catholic.html" title="Catholic">Catholics</a> and a <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protestant.html" title="Protestant">Protestant</a> dead. That same night (the 14th) a <a href="../../../l/o/y/Loyalist.html" title="Loyalist">loyalist</a> mob burned all of the Catholic homes on Bombay Street. Over 1,500 Catholics were expelled from their homes in Belfast. Taken together with events in Derry, this period of rioting is widely seen as the point in which <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Troubles_79c5.html" title="The Troubles">The Troubles</a> escalated from a situation of civil unrest to one of a three-way armed conflict between nationalists, state forces and unionists.</p>
