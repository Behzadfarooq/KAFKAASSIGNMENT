<p>I will settle for good&#160;:) I actually wrote "good" to start with &amp; then decided to go the superlative.</p>
<p>Just to be a geek, I downloaded the stats and found that 45 out of 151 qualifiers for the BA championship in the majors hit .300 (53/258 with 300 PA, 69/430 with 100 PA). So I agree, "good", at least among regulars. Of course, if you're a bench player hitting .300 you probably won't be a bench player much longer.</p>
<p>Then again, in the American league in 1968, a batting average of .300 was unquestionably excellent. But that was then, and this is definitely an era of offense. <a href="../../../d/z/e/User%7EDze27_8d23.html" title="User:Dze27">User:Dze27</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>Quite. Yaz won the batting title three times without ever hitting better than 326.</dd>
<dd>As compared to, say, <a href="../../../1/9/3/1930.html" title="1930">1930</a>, when (I think) there was only one regular in the NL who didn't hit .300. The 1890s were another odd period like this. <a href="../../../r/j/l/User%7ERjLesch_f374.html" title="User:RjLesch">User:RjLesch</a></dd>

<p>Hmm.. I'm not big follower of <a href="../../../c/r/i/Cricket_%28sport%29.html" title="Cricket (sport)">cricket</a> but there is a potential conflict here between cricket and baseball.

<dd>I didn't see this comment before, but I recently added content on cricket batting averages to cover just this.

<dd>I think probably in the fullness of time it should be, although there are a heck of a lot of articles, both baseball- and cricket-related, linking to "Batting average" so it would be a fairly major task and might be better left until there's more content in the cricket section. <a href="../../../l/o/g/User%7ELoganberry_d015.html" title="User:Loganberry">Loganberry</a> 12:05, 20 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, if we are going to do it, the sooner the better really: the list of "what links here" will only get longer.

<dd>Actually, I was going to add a section explaining how the two are related. It seems that baseball averages were deliberately invented by Chadwick (who was a cricket fan also) to provide statistics like cricket averages. That would provide more reason to keep the two together, as they are clearly related by lineage. <strike>Although I have no objection to splitting them up.</strike> -<a href="../../../d/m/m/User%7EDmmaus_1358.html" title="User:Dmmaus">dmmaus</a> 01:20, 23 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I've gone ahead and made my change.

<p>I now believe there are strong advantages to keeping the discussion of cricket and baseball batting averages on one page, as they are related historically and discussing each in the context of the other is valuable and provides insights that fans of either sport alone may never discover otherwise. -<a href="../../../d/m/m/User%7EDmmaus_1358.html" title="User:Dmmaus">dmmaus</a> 22:43, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Just a little (possibly silly) thought that I set down here for consideration... if we accept the Steven Jay Gould argument that the decline of the .400 hitter in baseball is because of the tendency for (simplistically speaking) top stats to get lower as well as bottom stats to get higher, why has the benchmark for the very top Test cricketers been an average in the high fifties for decades now? The extraordinary one-off of <a href="../../../d/o/n/Don_Bradman_1491.html" title="Don Bradman">Bradman</a> aside, no-one has <i>ever</i> averaged over 61 in Tests - <a href="../../../h/e/r/Herbert_Sutcliffe_2811.html" title="Herbert Sutcliffe">Herbert Sutcliffe</a> averaged 60.73 before the war, while <a href="../../../r/a/h/Rahul_Dravid_1ba6.html" title="Rahul Dravid">Rahul Dravid</a> is currently averaging 57.86 and seven other current players are over the 55 mark. <a href="../../../l/o/g/User%7ELoganberry_d015.html" title="User:Loganberry">Loganberry</a> (<a href="../../../l/o/g/User_talk%7ELoganberry_54ba.html" title="User talk:Loganberry">Talk</a>) 04:10, 19 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Hmmm... good point. I'm tempted to say that, as admirable as Gould's knowledge of baseball statistics is, his one failing was a lack of an appreciation for cricket.&#160;:-) More seriously, there are almost certainly other factors at work that make baseball averages a better analogy of "naturally evolving" systems than cricket averages. I think the fact that baseball averages display this sort of behaviour is more coincidence than rule, despite Gould getting a whole book out of it. -<a href="../../../d/m/m/User%7EDmmaus_1358.html" title="User:Dmmaus">dmmaus</a> 23:40, 19 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>I think this point may be less valid than you think. Gould's explanation entails two statistical measurements that he did: 1. That the variance of batting averages decreased, and 2. That the across-league average of batting averages stayed unchanged. Only because of the combination of these two conditions, did the top batting average go down (and below 0.400). Condition #2 - the fact that the league average didn't change - is far from obvious. Gould measured this fact using the heaps of statistics he collects, and he attributes this fact to changes in the rules of the game (when players became better, the rules were changed to be harder). My guess (not backed by any cricket statistics) that this fact is simply not true of cricket: probably the variance of cricket skill went down, and at the same time, the leage average went up - because rules weren't changed, or even changed in the wrong direction. Unless you (or someone else) can refute this guess (with real cricket statistics), you can't use cricket to invalidate Gould's explanation.</b> <a href="../../../n/y/h/User%7ENyh_7d57.html" title="User:Nyh">Nyh</a> 21:35, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><i>Yes, for example, in the 1960's the pitchers mound was raised that made batters have a disadvantage. Also, talent searching for players to play in the pro leagues is more efficient by the number of personnel who have jobs to search for players versus 80 years ago and the pool to choose from is wider to account for a greater amount of players to decrease the lower batting averaged players. The invention/application of the split fingered pitch also added pitchers, along with "Tommy John" surgery for extended good pitching arms and also the pitchers of old were pitching full games as now you have three pitchers of specialty that could show up in any game: starting, set-up, and closing pitchers. Some could argue these points by saying that the ball is more lively today than yesterday which makes homeruns of what would otherwise be outs to increase batting average but these are all ways of understanding baseball stats apart from Gould's reference.</i></dd>

<dd>The "Gould effect", if I can call it that, has been offset in cricket by the move to covered pitches and the pressure on groundsmen to produce "TV freindly" pitches. Whereas years ago a test match finishing in 3 days was fine, these days too much TV revenue would be lost if the match doesn't go to at least 4 days, preferably the full 5. --<a href="../../../l/i/a/User%7ELiamE_f310.html" title="User:LiamE">LiamE</a> 01:53, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You're kidding, right? When was hitting .400 common? There were only 13 cases of an average above .400 between 1900 and 1941. That's considered common? Take in the fact that those 13 times were accomplished by only 8 men. So only 8 talented men were capable of hitting .400 after 1899, and this is called a "not uncommon" occurance? I think this needs to be edited. Here's the list of men:</p>

<li>Nap Lajoie</li>
<li>Rogers Hornsby</li>

<p>What real use is the histogram as illustrated? It is just a list of numbers in picture form which says no more than reading the list of numbers does. It would be more useful if it had a column listing runs scored innings-by-innings linked to an indication of career batting average innings-by-innings and possibly current "form" as a moving average, last five innings for example. This would be useful too for baseball stats. Baseball statisticians are fond of winning/losing streaks. The drawback is that 3 at-bats per game over a 160-game season is too many columns for one chart, which rules out Albert Pujohls, but the principle is sound enough. It could be particularly useful for post-season analysis.</p>

<dd>I guess you're just not a visual person. I find diagrams much more interesting to look at and easier to absorb than a list of numbers, and it makes a nice visual break-up of the article text. It distils the voluminous data down into a histogram that shows in a glance the distribution of averages. If you want to make additional or replacement graphs showing more pertinent information, please do so, but this page isn't the place for a large statistical list. We could create them separately at List of moving cricket batting averages and List of moving baseball batting averages, for example - but it would be difficult to keep them up to date. -<a href="../../../d/m/m/User%7EDmmaus_1358.html" title="User:Dmmaus">dmmaus</a> 23:08, 30 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>G'day. I am a former statistician, and also quite skilled at presenting the data pictorially. You are right, there is little point in doing it here for somebody whose career is still under way, as it will need constant revision. Cricinfo and the MLB sites do this very well. My point is that the graph should show something not easy to spot from looking at the raw numbers. There is no need for a picture giving score-by-score game-by-game. However, if the career moving average game-by-game is also arrayed, and also recent "form" (moving average of a few most recent games), then the picture is, as you say, much more interesting and worth having. There is a picture on the <a href="../../../z/a/h/Zaheer_Abbas_99f3.html" title="Zaheer Abbas">Zaheer Abbas</a> page which is more like it. &#160;;-)</dd>

<p>Bradman's final average was 99.94. What is amazing about this is that in his final innings he needed just one run to take his average to 100, and was out for a duck (no runs). Incredible then that he didn't play again so that he could have made the career average of 100, clearly a different era meant a different attitude! <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 84.9.63.199 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_84.9.63.199_3dd9.html" title="Special:Contributions/84.9.63.199">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<p>The time has come for the tables of leading batting averages to be revised. Firstly by date. Both games are very different nowadays from what they were decades ago. Hence there should be tables for currently active players separate from those retired. Baseball should have a separate tables for regular season and post-season, possibly a further split between championship series and world series, and possibly split again for semi-finals since the start of wild cards. For cricket, one-day stats are equally as useful and relevant as full-term games nowadays, and there should be tables for first-class averages as well as test match. A lot of table-making for somebody. <a href="../../../s/w/e/User%7ESweetalkinguy_4970.html" title="User:Sweetalkinguy">Guy</a> 04:33, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>It seems clear that the international game has changed in the era of the ODI (the last thirty-five years). A simple batting average is not adequate to compare test-match batsmen over a 120-year period. The <a href="../../../i/c/c/ICC_b6b8.html" title="ICC">ICC</a> stats, published here <a href="http://www.lgiccrankings.com/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.lgiccrankings.com/" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> do not seem to be totally satisfactory either. One feature is the recent introduction of <a href="../../../z/i/m/Zimbabwean_cricket_team.html" title="Zimbabwean cricket team">Zimbabwe</a> and <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bangladeshi_cricket_team.html" title="Bangladeshi cricket team">Bangladesh</a> to the list of ten test-playing countries. Some averages have been inflated by batsmen filling their boots against weak opposition - <a href="../../../s/r/i/Sri_Lankan_cricket_team_e5c9.html" title="Sri Lankan cricket team">Sri Lanka</a> too was a softer opponent when they were first admitted. <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indian_cricket_team.html" title="Indian cricket team">India</a> and <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Zealand_cricket_team_b7ed.html" title="New Zealand cricket team">New Zealand</a> also won very few test matches for many years, but that was at least forty years ago (until <a href="../../../g/e/o/Geoffrey_Boycott_aad2.html" title="Geoffrey Boycott">Geoffrey Boycott</a> became the first losing <a href="../../../e/n/g/England_cricket_team.html" title="England cricket team">England</a> captain in New Zealand in 1978). At the risk of falling foul of the Wikipedia strictures about original research, it should be possible for a proper statistician to analyse the numbers over the years to compare averages (for example, a correlation between average and tests/innings played for batsmen averaging over 50, or fitting the histograms to <a href="../../../n/o/r/Normal_distribution.html" title="Normal distribution">bell-shaped curves</a>). The ODI histogram is significantly narrower in the base than the test histogram. I am inclined to think that the test averages of players active since the introduction of ODIs will converge in a similar manner to those of ODI batsmen. I think one factor is that the modern batsmen who have sustained a high average are all exceptional players who have responded to the higher pressure of the game compared to, for example, timeless tests against South Africa in the old days, but then W.R. Hammond will have felt the pressure walking out on the Melbourne Cricket Ground. There is plenty here for cricket-lovers to discuss - for my part all contributions made to the discussion in the spirit of the game are welcome, and will be taken seriously - call me an idiot if you like, as long as you supply supporting evidence.</p>

<p>As ardent a cricket fan as I am, I must say that I oppose the addition of these extensive tables of batting averages to this article. Firstly, I don't think Wikipedia is an appropriate place for lists of frequently updated sports stats - other sites that we link to do a better job of that. Secondly, this makes the article look cricket-heavy, at the expense of baseball. I strongly believe that <i>fans of both sports gain an advantage by discussion of batting average being combined on one page</i>, rather than split into two, as the statistics are historically related, and discussing them in the context of one another provides valuable insights and comparisons. Overloading the page with current cricket stats interferes with that insightful comparison and may make people start to agitate to split this article up into a separate article for each sport, which would be a tragedy. Therefore, I suggest we remove the additional tables, perhaps placing them on a separate page such as <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_cricket_batting_averages.html" title="List of cricket batting averages">List of cricket batting averages</a>. I'm listing this here for discussion rather than just removing the tables, because I suspect some people might feel differently, and I want everyone to know why I think they should be removed from this article. -<a href="../../../d/m/m/User%7EDmmaus_1358.html" title="User:Dmmaus">dmmaus</a> 22:37, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Baseball is far more popular (especially regarding this term) AND baseball is first alphabetically. Really no excuse not to have baseball be the first thing you see. 63.145.155.66 17:25, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Two points: Cricket is more popular than baseball on a global scale (although in fact that point is completely irrelevant to the ordering in this article - I am merely correcting your factual error). The main point is that baseball batting average is <i>directly descended</i> from cricket batting average. Therefore, to give proper historical context, it is necessary to discuss cricket batting average first, so that people researching baseball batting averages can learn about the history of the statistic. This point has been discussed several times previously on this talk page, and consensus reached that the current ordering makes the most sense. -<a href="../../../d/m/m/User%7EDmmaus_1358.html" title="User:Dmmaus">dmmaus</a> 00:11, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
