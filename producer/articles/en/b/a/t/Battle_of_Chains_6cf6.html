<p>On receiving the orders of the <a href="../../../c/a/l/Caliph.html" title="Caliph">Caliph</a> to attack the <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persian_Empire_bdcb.html" title="Persian Empire">Persian Empire</a>, Khalid at once undertook preparations to raise a new army. His riders galloped far and wide in the region of <a href="../../../y/a/m/Yamamah.html" title="Yamamah">Yamamah</a> and in Central and Northern <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arabia.html" title="Arabia">Arabia</a>, calling brave men to arms for the invasion of <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iraq.html" title="Iraq">Iraq</a> ( <a href="../../../p/r/o/Province.html" title="Province">Province</a> of <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persian_Empire_bdcb.html" title="Persian Empire">Persian Empire</a> ).Within a few weeks an army of 10,000 men was ready to march with Khalid.four important <a href="../../../m/u/s/Muslim.html" title="Muslim">Muslim</a> chiefs with large followings in <a href="../../../n/o/r/North.html" title="North">North</a>-<a href="../../../e/a/s/East.html" title="East">Eastern</a> <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arabia.html" title="Arabia">Arabia</a>, Muthanna bin Harithah, Mazhur bin Adi, Harmala and Sulma.The <a href="../../../c/a/l/Caliph.html" title="Caliph">Caliph</a> had written to them to muster warriors and operate under the command of Khalid. Now Khalid wrote to all four of them, informing them of his appointment as commander of the Muslim army and of the mission which he had received from the Caliph.He ordered them to report to him, along with their men, in the region of Uballa.Each of these four chiefs brought 2,000 men. Thus Khalid entered Iraq with 18,000 warriors.In about the third week of March 633 (beginning of Muharram, 12 Hijri), Khalid set out from <a href="../../../y/a/m/Yamamah.html" title="Yamamah">Yamamah</a>. But before doing so he wrote to Hormuz, the <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persian_Empire_bdcb.html" title="Persian Empire">Persian</a> governor of the frontier district of Dast Meisan:</p>

<p>Hormuz read the letter and informed the <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persian_Empire_bdcb.html" title="Persian Empire">Persian</a> Emperor Ardsheer of Khalid's threat.Khalid began his advance from <a href="../../../y/a/m/Yamamah.html" title="Yamamah">Yamamah</a> with his army divided into three groups. He did this in order not to tire his men or waste time by having too many troops in the same marching column. Each group set off a day apart. Thus each group was a day's march from the next, far enough for ease of movement, and yet close enough to be swiftly concentrated for battle if required.</p>
<p>Khalid himself moved with the third group on the third day.The whole army would concentrate again near Hufair.The direct route from <a href="../../../y/a/m/Yamamah.html" title="Yamamah">Yamamah</a> to Uballa lay through <a href="../../../k/a/z/Kazima.html" title="Kazima">Kazima</a> (in modern <a href="../../../k/u/w/Kuwait.html" title="Kuwait">Kuwait</a>) and thither went Hormuz, expecting Khalid to take this route.</p>
<p><a href="../../../m/o/h/Image%7EMohammad_adil_rais-phase1.JPG_0b04.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/5/57/Mohammad_adil_rais-phase1.JPG/250px-Mohammad_adil_rais-phase1.JPG" alt="" width="250" height="308" longdesc="../../../m/o/h/Image%7EMohammad_adil_rais-phase1.JPG_0b04.html" /></a> On arrival at Kazima, he deployed his army facing south-west, with a centre and two wings, and ordered that men should be linked together with chains. So deployed, he awaited the arrival of Khalid. But of Khalid there was no sign. And the following morning his scouts brought word that Khalid was not moving towards Kazima; he was making for Hufair.</p>
<p><a href="../../../m/o/h/Image%7EMohammad_adil_rais-phase2.JPG_649b.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/7/7b/Mohammad_adil_rais-phase2.JPG/250px-Mohammad_adil_rais-phase2.JPG" alt="" width="250" height="287" longdesc="../../../m/o/h/Image%7EMohammad_adil_rais-phase2.JPG_649b.html" /></a></p>
<p>Khalid had, already before he left <a href="../../../y/a/m/Yamamah.html" title="Yamamah">Yamamah</a>, arrived at a broad conception of how he would deal with the army of Hormuz. He had been given the mission of fighting the <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persian_Empire_bdcb.html" title="Persian Empire">Persians</a>, and a defeat of the <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persian_Empire_bdcb.html" title="Persian Empire">Persian</a> army was essential if the invasion of <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iraq.html" title="Iraq">Iraq</a> was to proceed as intended by the <a href="../../../c/a/l/Caliph.html" title="Caliph">Caliph</a>. With the <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persian_Empire_bdcb.html" title="Persian Empire">Persian</a> army intact at Uballa, Khalid could not get far. The direction given to him by the Caliph, i.e. Uballa, was by itself certain to bring the <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persian_Empire_bdcb.html" title="Persian Empire">Persians</a> to battle, for no <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persian_Empire_bdcb.html" title="Persian Empire">Persian</a> general could let Uballa fall.Khalid knew the fine quality and the numerical strength of the <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persian_Empire_bdcb.html" title="Persian Empire">Persian</a> <a href="../../../a/r/m/Army.html" title="Army">Army</a> and the courage, skill and armament of the Persian soldier. Heavily armed and equipped, he was the ideal man for the set-piece frontal clash. The only weakness of the Persian soldier and army lay in their lack of mobility; the <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persian_Empire_bdcb.html" title="Persian Empire">Persian</a> was not able to move fast, and any prolonged movement would tire him. On the other hand, Khalid's troops were mobile, mounted on camels with horses at the ready for cavalry attacks; and they were not only brave and skilful fighters, but also adept at fast movement across any terrain, especially the desert. Moreover, thousands of them were veterans of the <a href="../../../c/a/m/Campaign.html" title="Campaign">Campaign</a> of the <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apostasy.html" title="Apostasy">Apostasy</a>.</p>
<p>Khalid decided to use his own mobility to exploit its lack in the Persian army. He would force the Persians to carry out march and counter-march till he had worn them out. Then he would strike when the <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persian_Empire_bdcb.html" title="Persian Empire">Persians</a> were exhausted. <a href="../../../g/e/o/Geography.html" title="Geography">Geography</a> would help him. There were two routes to Uballa, via Kazima and Hufair.</p>
<p>Khalid knew that the <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persian_Empire_bdcb.html" title="Persian Empire">Persian</a> would expect him to advance on the direct route from Yamamah to Uballa, via Kazima, and would make his defensive plans accordingly. Khalid decided not to move on that route, but to approach Uballa from the south-west so that he would be free to manoeuvre on two axes-the Kazima axis and the Hufair axis-thus creating a difficult problem for the less mobile <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persian_Empire_bdcb.html" title="Persian Empire">Persians</a>. Khalid waited in front of Hufair, while light detachments of his cavalry kept Hormuz under observation. He knew, that his presence near Hufair would cause near-panic in the mind of Hormuz.</p>
<p>This is just what happened. The moment Hormuz got word of Khalid's movement towards Hufair, he realised the grave danger in which his army was placed. The Arab was not so simple after all! As an experienced strategist, he knew that his base was threatened. He immediately ordered a move to Hufair, 50 miles away, and his army, weighed down with its heavy equipment, trudged along the track. The two days' march was tiring, but the tough and disciplined <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persian_Empire_bdcb.html" title="Persian Empire">Persian</a> <a href="../../../s/o/l/Soldier.html" title="Soldier">Soldiers</a> accepted his trials without complaint. On arrival at Hufair, however, Hormuz found no trace of Khalid. Expecting the <a href="../../../m/u/s/Muslim.html" title="Muslim">Muslims</a> to arrive soon, he deployed for battle as he had done at Kazima, chains and all; but hardly had his men taken up their positions when his scouts came rushing to inform him that Khalid was moving towards Kazima.</p>
<p>And Khalid was indeed moving towards Kazima. He had waited near, Hufair until he heard of the hurried approach of Hormuz.</p>
<p><a href="../../../m/o/h/Image%7EMohammad_adil_rais-phase3.JPG_d3c7.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/e/e8/Mohammad_adil_rais-phase3.JPG/250px-Mohammad_adil_rais-phase3.JPG" alt="" width="250" height="310" longdesc="../../../m/o/h/Image%7EMohammad_adil_rais-phase3.JPG_d3c7.html" /></a> Then he had withdrawn a short distance and begun a counter-march through the desert towards Kazima, not going too far into the desert so as not to become invisible to Persian scouts. Khalid was in no hurry. His men were well mounted, and he took his time. He had no desire to get to Kazima first and occupy it, for then he would have to position himself for battle and his opponent would be free to battle tactics.Khalid preferred to let the Persians position themselves while he himself remained free to approach and attack as he liked, with the desert behind him.</p>
<p>The Persians again packed their bags and set off for Kazima, for Hormuz could not leave the Kazima route to the <a href="../../../m/u/s/Muslim.html" title="Muslim">Muslims</a>. Hormuz could have fought a defensive battle closer to Uballa; but having experienced the terrible havoc wrought by Muthanna in his district, he was in no mood to let Khalid approach close enough to let his raiders loose in the fertile region of Uballa. He was determined to fight and destroy Khalid at a safe distance from the district which it was his duty to protect, and he rejoiced at the prospect of a set-piece battle against the desert <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arab.html" title="Arab">Arabs</a>. Moreover, armies act as magnets: they attract each other. Sometimes an area which is not otherwise strategically important becomes so through the presence of a hostile army. Now Hormuz was drawn to Kazima not only by the strategical importance of the place but also by the army of Khalid.</p>
<p><a href="../../../m/o/h/Image%7EMohammad_adil_rais-phase4.JPG_0444.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/c/c9/Mohammad_adil_rais-phase4.JPG/250px-Mohammad_adil_rais-phase4.JPG" alt="" width="250" height="285" longdesc="../../../m/o/h/Image%7EMohammad_adil_rais-phase4.JPG_0444.html" /></a></p>
<p>The Persians arrived at Kazima in a state of exhaustion. Hormuz, the professional regular soldier, wasted no time and at once deployed the army for battle in the normal formation of a centre and wings. The generals commanding his wings were Qubaz and Anushjan. The men again linked themselves with chains.Chains were often used by the Persian army to link their men in battle.</p>
<p>They were normally of four lengths, to link three, five, seven or ten men. They were supposed to act as a source of strength to the army.The chains were used as a manifestation of suicidal courage, confirming the soldiers' willingness to die on the battlefield rather than seek safety in flight. They also lessened the danger of a breakthrough by enemy cavalry, as with the men linked together in chains it was not easy for cavalry groups to knock down a few men and create a gap for penetration. And since the <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persian_Empire_bdcb.html" title="Persian Empire">Persian</a> <a href="../../../a/r/m/Army.html" title="Army">Army</a> was organised and trained for the set-piece battle, this tactic enabled it to stand like a rock in the face of enemy assault. But the chains had one major drawback: in case of defeat the men were incapable of withdrawal, for then the chains acted as fetters. Men chained to fallen comrades, lost all power of movement and became helpless victims of their assailants.It was the use of chains in this battle that gave it the name of the Battle of Chains.Now Khalid came out of the desert and approached the <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persian_Empire_bdcb.html" title="Persian Empire">Persians</a>. He had made up his mind to fight a battle here and now before the <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persian_Empire_bdcb.html" title="Persian Empire">Persian</a> <a href="../../../a/r/m/Army.html" title="Army">Army</a> recovered from its fatigue.</p>

<p>Khalid now moved his army into the sandy plain; and keeping his back to the hills and the desert, formed up for battle with the usual centre and wings. As commanders of the wings, he appointed Asim bin Amr (brother of Qaqa bin Amr) and <a href="../../../a/d/d/Addi_bin_hatim.html" title="Addi bin hatim">Addi bin hatim</a>( son of hatim tai ) and the battle begans.</p>
<p>The battle started in grand style with a duel between the two army commanders. Hormuz was a mighty fighter, renowned in the Empire as a champion whom few would dare to meet in single combat. (In those chivalrous days no one could be a commanding general without at the same time being a brave and skilful fighter.) He urged his horse forward and halted in the open space between the two armies, though closer to his own front rank. Then he called, "Man to man! Where is Khalid?" From the Muslim ranks Khalid rode out and stopped a few paces from Hormuz. The two armies watched in silence as these redoubtable champions prepared to fight it out.</p>
<p>Hormuz dismounted, motioning to Khalid to do the same. Khalid dismounted. This was brave of Hormuz, for a dismounted duel left little chance of escape; but on this occasion Hormuz was not being as chivalrous as one might imagine. Before coming out of the Persian ranks Hormuz had picked a few of his warriors and placed them in the front rank near the site which he had chosen for the duel. He instructed them as follows: he would engage Khalid in single combat; at the appropriate time he would call to the men; they would then dash out, surround the combatants and kill Khalid while Hormuz held him. The chosen warriors watched intently as the two generals dismounted. They felt certain that Khalid would not get away.</p>
<p>The generals began to fight with sword and shield. Each struck several times at his adversary, but none of the blows made any impression. Each was surprised at the skill of the other. Hormuz now suggested that they drop their swords and wrestle. Khalid, unaware of the plot, dropped his sword as Hormuz dropped his. They began to wrestle. Then, as they were locked in a powerful embrace, Hormuz shouted to his men, who rushed forward. Before Khalid realised what was happening he found himself and Hormuz surrounded by several fierce looking Persians.</p>
<p>Now Khalid knew. He was without his sword and shield, and Hormuz would not relax his iron grip. There seemed to be no way out of the predicament; but then, being a stronger man than Hormuz, Khalid began to whirl his adversary round and round, thus making it practically impossible for the <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persian_Empire_bdcb.html" title="Persian Empire">Persians</a> to strike at him.A storm of sound arose over the battlefield as the two armies shouted-one with delight, the other with dismay. In this noise, their attention riveted on the wrestlers, the <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persian_Empire_bdcb.html" title="Persian Empire">Persian</a> killers did not hear the galloping hooves that approached them. They did not know what hit them. Two or three of them sprawled on the ground as headless trunks, before the others realised that the number of combatants in this melee had increased by just one more. The extra man was Qaqa bin Amr. aqa had seen the <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persian_Empire_bdcb.html" title="Persian Empire">Persian</a> killers rush towards the two generals, and in a flash understood the perfidy of the enemy general There was no time to tell this to anyone; no time to explain or gather comrades to support him.He had spurred his horse into a mad gallop, and arriving in the nick of time, had set upon the Persians with his sword. Qaqa killed all of them!.</p>
<p>Khalid, freed of the menace of the <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persian_Empire_bdcb.html" title="Persian Empire">Persian</a> killers, turned his entire attention to Hormuz. After a minute or two Hormuz lay motionless on the ground, and Khalid rose from his chest with a dripping dagger in his hand.</p>
<p>Khalid now ordered a general attack, and the Muslims, incensed by the treacherous plot of the enemy commander, went into battle with a vengeance. The centre and the wings swept across the plain to assault the Persian army. The Persians had suffered a moral setback with the death of their commanding general; but they were more numerous than the Muslims and, their iron discipline held them together. They fought hard. For some time the battle hung in the balance with the fast-moving Muslims assailing the front and the steady, chain-linked <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persian_Empire_bdcb.html" title="Persian Empire">Persian</a> <a href="../../../i/n/f/Infantry.html" title="Infantry">Infantry</a> repulsing all assaults. But soon the superior skill and courage of the <a href="../../../m/u/s/Muslim.html" title="Muslim">Muslims</a> and the fatigue of the <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persian_Empire_bdcb.html" title="Persian Empire">Persians</a> began to tell, and after several attempts the <a href="../../../m/u/s/Muslim.html" title="Muslim">Muslims</a> succeeded in breaking the <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persian_Empire_bdcb.html" title="Persian Empire">Persian</a> front in a number of places.</p>
<p>Sensing defeat, the <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persian_Empire_bdcb.html" title="Persian Empire">Persian</a> generals commanding the wings-Qubaz and Anushjan-ordered a withdrawal and began to pull their men back. This led to a general retreat, and as the <a href="../../../m/u/s/Muslim.html" title="Muslim">Muslims</a> struck still more fiercely, the retreat turned into a rout. Most of the <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persian_Empire_bdcb.html" title="Persian Empire">Persians</a> who were not chained managed to escape, but those who were chain-linked found their chains a death trap. Unable to move fast, they fell an easy prey to the victorious <a href="../../../m/u/s/Muslim.html" title="Muslim">Muslims</a> and were slain in thousands before darkness set in to put an end to the slaughter. Qubaz and Anushjan managed to escape and succeeded in extricating a large portion of the army from the battlefield.</p>
