<dd>Hey, that's much better. Thank you for listening to reason ... there's plenty of people who would have thrown a hissy fit over someone daring to question content on "their" page. And to respond to one point you made - yes, Wikipedia is uncensored. But it's an uncensored <i>encyclopedia</i>. Not MySpace, not a forum, not a Big Pulpit O' Hate. Removing unencyclopedic junk isn't censorship.

<p><b>Please note: Everything written below, aside from my well thought out comment, is utter bullsh*t. Apparently, when you're reverting vandalism from pages, regardless of what the 3RR clearly says about it, you get blocked. Not only was the stuff I was deleting from the pages bullsh*t, but so was the block. Thus, i'm waging my personal battle now to let everyone know that it's apparently ok to add bullsh*t to wikipedia articles, because when well meaning editors remove it, they'll just get blocked.</b></p>
<p><br />
The <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">three revert</a> policy requires that all parties in a mutual 3RR violation be treated equally. Accordingly I have blocked you for 12 hours in reference to your part in the <a href="../../../l/u/k/Lukas_Podolski_491d.html" title="Lukas Podolski">Lukas Podolski</a> edit war. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 10:04, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Welp, then I think that's bullshit and from now on when I see clear vandalism on pages i'll just leave it.

<p>{{unblock}} - CBDunkerson, at the time, to the best of my knowledge, I was following the vandalism policy for reverting what I saw as simple vandalism under the "inserting misinformation" into articles. Several others before me edited the <a href="../../../l/u/k/Lukas_Podolski_491d.html" title="Lukas Podolski">Lukas Podolski</a> page to remove the information, and provided proof that it was false (i.e. he never sings the national anthem before games), that I kept removing that ultimately got me blocked. After several requests for sources the other two users kept inserting the dubious information without sources, blatantly disregarding the requests. That in my opinion is blatant vandalism and after looking at the simple vandalism page, I deemed that it was misinformation. If you actually feel that blocking me for 12 hours is the correct course of action that's fine, obviously theres nothing I can do but strongly disagree with it. I do think, however, that William M. Connoelly was correct in only issuing a warning with my promise that I don't intend to get sucked into this type of nonsense again. I'll await your response and ask that you assume I was acting in good faith an reverting only what I saw as vandalism under <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVAND_6593.html" title="WP:VAND">WP:VAND</a>. <a href="../../../b/a/t/User%7EBatman2005_c25f.html" title="User:Batman2005">Batman2005</a> 14:50, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think this article needs the "conclusion" or maybe we don't even need the entire article - I think it could be deleted because nothing of this information is relevant for the future or worth remembering, because nothing happend which is special. I think it is very sad that there is no article about the culture events of the World Cup but about sinister things "over-emphasised by the media" that could have happend - but never happened. I as a German feel even a little bit offended or at least sad that you will find in the English Wikipedia always such unimportant (things never happened are unimportend) "facts" about Germany in the context of rasism. The only reason why this is in the media all the time is the remembrance of World War II, am I right? In the current years for example you will find even more problems wiht rasism in Italy but you can be sure that there is no article about it in the article about the Olympic Winter Games in Turin 2006. If you make article which tells extensivly about speculations which crimes could have happend than you have at least also to tell (and not only in one sentense) how it was in reality - all in all (for sure there are always special bad cases) the total opposite. If the article stays like it is today I will put in the BBC- quote again. --<a href="../../../k/n/a/User%7EKnarf-bz_b89f.html" title="User:Knarf-bz">Knarf-bz</a> 06:52, 13 July 2006 (UTC) - By the way - all English and American people I meet in Germany in the time of the World Cup have been filled wiht enthusiasm about the open, multicultural and peaceful World Cup, but if the informations the English Wikipedia have about it will stay like they are future readers will definitly have a wrong idea albout how the World Cup was. If you have articles like this you should at least also make a article ablout the culture events of the World Cup (there is plenty of stuff in the German Wikipedia) to paint a more objektiv picture of the World Cup.

<p>Maybe you are right, but nevertheless the article like it is now is also only based on some media news articles and has no practical relevance (at least not for the World Cup). It is all about speculations. And in the end about speculations which never came true. Why do you think that this <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/12888810/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/12888810/" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> article (which is quoted- Maybe it is interesting but in the end it has nothing to do with the reality of the World Cup 2006) is more verifiable than claimes of the German interior minister. () There are much sorces in the internet, you will find hundreds, if you want statistics about crimes compared to other events, informations about how tourists experienced the World Cup. I myself are not able to chance it because I have problems with my English skills, but my English is good enough to recognize that this is more a selction of negativ sources and no one in the English Wikipedia cares for the positiv about the World Cup (I have recognized this in many articles related to Germany or German people). In my opinion this is a very useless article and sould be deleted. If such articles stay in the Englsih Wikipedia I not wonder why it has so much articles. 4 or 5 sentences in the main article is more than enough in an Enzyclopedia - Wikipedia is still a Enzyclopedia? A selction of one kind of sources (even if these ar verifiable) is not a neutral POV. --<a href="../../../k/n/a/User%7EKnarf-bz_b89f.html" title="User:Knarf-bz">Knarf-bz</a> 15:23, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Nonetheless, at one point, there were multiple fan sites listing there. Notability of the site should be remarked upon at its side so people don't think its just another random fan site from the Internet; it should be noted that that is the primary one. In my experience, I've been told that its best looked upon if fan sites are only included if they are directly endorsed by the person the article is about (<a href="../../../k/a/t/Katharine_McPhee_acac.html" title="Katharine McPhee">Katharine McPhee</a> has one such listing for example), else they are just viewed as excessive vanity. Just saying "(fan site)" next to the link isn't enough. I could go out and find fifty right now if I wanted to; just be sure to note that site's particular relevance. Unless it's noted, the site just looks like another random fan site. Do you understand? <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike_7_0c48.html" title="User:Mike 7">Michael</a> 19:29, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I contacted Levid37 about the troll a month ago, but I just thought you might want to know (since you have been doing battle with him most recently) that the John Wayne troll was vandalizing the <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tom_Atkins_%28actor%29_285d.html" title="Tom Atkins (actor)">Tom Atkins (actor)</a> page in much the same way that he is now vandalizing the Wayne page.</p>
<p>About two months ago, he was completely obsessed with stating that Tom Atkins is gay and had a male lover who died fairly recently, despite the fact that there is no evidence supporting either assertion. He uses the same MO every time. He never cites anything credible and hysterically accuses anyone who reverts his edits of racism/fascism/homophobia/whatever. He has just shifted his focus to Wayne.</p>

<p>Seriously. Even by troll standards, he stands out as an enormous asshole. I had it out with him on the Atkins article talk page, and afterwards more people joined in to revert him. Eventually, he gave up when Will BeBack and another admin locked it down to prevent him from vandalizing. Thus far it seems to have worked for the Atkins page. Unfortunately, he just goes somewhere else.</p>
<p>Also, his choice of targets suggests he has unresolved daddy issues.</p>

<p>Dude, the comment about Sigma Phi necessitating a change is speculative and conjecture and should not be included. This may or may not have been the case. There are two Kappa Alphas currently in existence, and obviously one was founded before the other. Just because another one already existed doesn't mean a change would have had to occur. The reason for the change was the stealing of the ritual, and that's all that should be listed.</p>
<p><br />
Exactly! One has become known as Kappa Alpha Order and the other Kappa Alpha Fraternity. But they both use the letters KA. Sigma Phi is officially known as Sigma Phi Society. Sigma Phi founded by the seven who eventully changed the name to Sigma Chi could have continued on as the Sigma Phi Order or Sigma Phi Fraternity. The assumption that the name would have changed if the theft of the ritual had not occurred is erroneous and unfounded. It could be up for philosophical debate, but has no place in an encyclopedia.</p>

<p>Sorry I didnt mean to sound so harsh on my edit comment for the <a href="../../../c/r/i/Crips.html" title="Crips">Crips</a>, I just thought that was your opinion on the matter, when I read what wrote I thought it might have come off unfriendly. Anyways Stanley Williams is considered co-founder to the Crips. I added a citation: <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2005/LAW/12/13/williams.execution/" class="external free" title="http://www.cnn.com/2005/LAW/12/13/williams.execution/" rel="nofollow">http://www.cnn.com/2005/LAW/12/13/williams.execution/</a>. Person can still be considered a co-founder even if he was not there at the very beginning. For example if a person joins early on and contributes a great deal to the structure and foundation of an organization, as is the case with Stanley Williams.

<li>Stanley Tookie Williams was viewed as a co-founder because of his leadership skills. He was the primary force that spread the Crips across the state which in turn spread across the nation. Also my article does back the fact that he is a co-founder. Right under the title it says "Crips gang co-founder put to death for 4 murders". <a href="../../../v/a/l/User%7EValoem_e826.html" title="User:Valoem"><font color="DarkSlateGray"><b>Valoem</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../v/a/l/User_talk%7EValoem_0a70.html" title="User talk:Valoem"><b><font color="black">talk</font></b></a></sup> 01:22, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Like your user page found you by reading the discussion page of John Wayne. Glad you dished it out to that troll. After reading your page and hearing from others off site. Ive come to find this eutopia of wiki has a very dark side I didn't know was there. Doing what they ask can get you in trouble (that 3rr thing). As they say no good deed goes unpunished. Apparently that really holds true here. I'd like to ask you some wiki questions Ive used it for a couple years but just recently got a username and participated.
