<p>From what I read here on this article, the Soviets achieved their mission objectives and the Germans (well, Spaniards really) failed to prevent the Soviets from achieving their mission. Casualties should not have to do with victory, unless it is a really pyrrhic one. -- <font color="#FF0000"><b>Миборовский</b></font> <sup><a href="../../../m/i/b/User%7EMiborovsky_4682.html" title="User:Miborovsky">U</a>|<a href="../../../m/i/b/User_talk%7EMiborovsky_4d3c.html" title="User talk:Miborovsky">T</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Miborovsky_ed69.html" title="Special:Contributions/Miborovsky">C</a>|<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Miborovsky_bb8e.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Miborovsky">M</a>|<a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="green">E</font></a>|<a href="../../../m/i/b/User%7EMiborovsky_4682.html#Wiki-not-so-fun" title="User:Miborovsky">Chugoku Banzai</a>!</sup> 01:37, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You have my full concurrence in the sense that <i>objectives</i> and not casualties determine a victory. What I'm not sure about is what the Soviet objectives were and how much of them they actually achieved (I didn't write the article, mind you)–the introduction seems to imply that the Soviets captured a piece of strategically useful ground, but I have trouble reconciling this with the geography I've seen elsewhere. It looks to me from <a href="http://usuarios.lycos.es/jnroldan/images/croquis12.jpg" class="external text" title="http://usuarios.lycos.es/jnroldan/images/croquis12.jpg" rel="nofollow">this</a> map that the 250. Division was positioned <i>astride</i> the Moscow–Leningrad highway, not parallel to it. The Russians by <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_13.html" title="February 13">February 13</a> seemed to want to throw the 250th across the Izhora; notice the Spanish managed to cling to the east bank. At any rate, since the Wehrmacht in the end recaptures the town and seems to still be blocking both rail and highway, I'm having trouble figuring out how that leaves "the main road to Moscow" in Russian hands. But anyway much of what I've seen on the Web, while vague, seemed to imply some manner of German victory. <a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlbrecht_dcaf.html" title="User:Albrecht">Albrecht</a> 03:37, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>At the moment this article seems pretty much an unmitigated praise for the Spanish division. Can we please see some sources on the following:</p>
<p>a) how many Soviet infantry actually attacked in the Spanish sector. I am almost certain the real number is far lower than the 44,000 claimed in the page.</p>
<p>b) how the 5,900 Spanish are arrived at? Is that the strength of the division that day? If so, which strength? Iststärke, Grabenstärke? Unfortunately the article linked on Feldgrau is not giving this information.</p>
<p>c) What were the other elements of the Spanish division doing during the battle?</p>
<p>Someone who can add info from the Soviet side needs to have a look at this article. The websites provided as links do not do this. I am going to check Glantz<i>Leningrad' tonight, but would welcome infos from the Soviet side. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndreas1968_bd6b.html" title="User:Andreas1968">Andreas</a> 09:01, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</i></p>
<dl>
<dd>"Unmitigated praise" I imagine would involve an excess of value statements such as "fought splendidly," "made a brave stand," etc. Strangely, I couldn't find these in the article. Why don't you <i>cite the passages</i> you're having problems with?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>a) Besides your raging bias, why do you have reason to think that the Soviets had substantially less men than the Order of Battle indicates?</dd>
<dd>b) Why exactly is this important?</dd>
<dd>c) Again, why does this matter? They were probably deployed in a nearby sector that wasn't attacked.</dd>

<dd>Suit yourself, I would however respect your opinion more if you did not accuse me of 'raging bias'. But hey, we can't all be brought up to be polite.

<dd>At the moment my problem is quite simply that it looks as if 5,900 Spanish soldiers held off 44,000 Red Army soldiers. I have trouble believing that, and I would like to point out to you that your linked site is not very firm on the 44,000, instead hedging with 'probably'. So clearly it would be preferable to have the correct number, or to indicate that the 44,000 is an estimate, as I did.</dd>

<dd>The article at the moment is a very one-sided description of the battle. You can call me pointing that out bias, but that just leads me to assume you have an agenda. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndreas1968_bd6b.html" title="User:Andreas1968">Andreas</a> 16:39, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Maybe I reacted too strongly there. The "unmitigated praise" comment is what did it for me; after working so hard to make sure that the article was factually-based, it's kind of a drag to hear something like that. I actually agree about the need for accuracy, but I don't think it's necessary to go fudging things up in the battlebox unless definite information is found to the contrary. About the disparity of numbers: attacking forces generally needed at least 3:1 superiority to overcome prepared defences, and the Soviets don't exactly have a shining record of using numerical superiority to good effect.</dd>

<dd>I agree I should have used different terms. I have not read any of the articles you link, and would not be able to judge them, since they are outside my area of expertise. I also agree it what you wrote is factual (except for the minor corrections I made), but most of the facts seem to come from the German side, which creates a problem. Hence the call for someone with access to Russian sources to come forward. I have some myself, and would perfer if we could co-operate on this article. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndreas1968_bd6b.html" title="User:Andreas1968">Andreas</a> 17:15, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have added to the article based on Infantes and Glantz - some explanations below.</p>
<ul>
<li>I have provided the context for the battle to counter the charge that it was unimportant. based on Glantz.</li>
<li>Spanish planning based on Infantes.</li>
<li>Regarding who held what at the end, it is clear from these two books that Krasny Bor was lost on the 10th, and was not recaptured.</li>
<li>The 33,000 Soviets are an estimation, assuming the three Soviet infantry divisions were at 11,000 men each. That is extremely unlikely. I could find no support for the old number of 44,000 anywhere in these books.</li>
<li>The casualty number has to be assumed to be questionable, since it is based on POW interrogations, and the Spanish did not control the battlefield afterwards.</li>
<li>The extension of the German OOB is to reflect that the 55th Army was not just facing the Spanish, and to show why this was not a 'minor engagement'</li>
<li>I noted that some of the original text is a straight copy from text on the Division Azul website. I suggest that this is not a good idea under any circumstances, but if one does it, it is recommended to at least give the link.</li>
</ul>

<dl>
<dd>Things are shaping up well. Thoughts:</dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li>I think we need to be careful about how we juggle Warbox Strengths and the Order of Battle. The figure of 33,000, for instance, is arrived at on Glantz's assumption that one of the four Soviet divisions actually swept eastwards against the 4th SS Police Division and so did not take part in the Krasny Bor fighting. Yet both these units are listed in the Order of Battle. Maybe the distinction between the Battle of <i>Krasny Bor</i> and other nearby fighting in the overall concurrent Soviet offensive needs to be clearer. ~</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>The 33,000 is from Infantes, not Glantz. Infantes has a map in his book confirming that the 45th Guards attacked Krasny Bor in his centre, the 72nd Rifle the Ishora sector on his left, and the 63rd Guards his right flank. I would assume based on Infantes and Glantz that the mobile group support (122nd Tank and 35th Ski Brigade) attacked along the highway into Krasny Bor as well. I agree that the OOB needs to be touched up a bit to reflect this. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndreas1968_bd6b.html" title="User:Andreas1968">Andreas</a> 08:57, 16 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think this was a (costly) German defensive victory, since the resistance by L. Korps destroyed the operational design by the STAVKA, namely to break through to Tosno and encircle the Mga group of German forces. It is apparent from documents quoted in Glantz that Stavka saw it the same way. The main goal of the Red Army was to break the encirclement ring - they failed. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndreas1968_bd6b.html" title="User:Andreas1968">Andreas</a> 09:20, 16 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>In other words, the situation is analogous to <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Borodino_7068.html" title="Battle of Borodino">Battle of Borodino</a>. Napoleon's goal was to destroy the Russian army and incapacitate it for further resistance, and he failed. Yet the article describes the outcome as "the French victory". We discussed the issue ad nauseum, with the majority claiming that the result was undecisive. But I don't recall anyone claiming it as a Russian victory, as it should have been called, if we apply the same standards of "victory" as you apply to the the Battle of Krasny Bor. --<a href="../../../g/h/i/User%7EGhirlandajo_b904.html" title="User:Ghirlandajo">Ghirla</a> <sup><a href="../../../g/h/i/User_talk%7EGhirlandajo_34f7.html" title="User talk:Ghirlandajo">-трёп-</a></sup> 09:32, 16 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I am not an expert on Napoleonics, but I would say that Borodino could probably count as a tactical victory by the French, an operational draw, and a strategic failure. In this case however I have serious trouble seeing the result even as indecisive. The Red Army had a clear set of goals - tactically to break the siege ring, operationally to encircle the Mga grouping, and strategically to rip apart Army Group North. They did not achieve any of these, it was total failure on all counts, even though they came close to the tactical goal. All they ended up with was the village of Krasny Bor at a cost of maybe 11,000 casualties, and a casualty exchange rate of worse than 1:2. I find that is quite clearly a defensive success. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndreas1968_bd6b.html" title="User:Andreas1968">Andreas</a> 09:39, 16 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I was asked to comment here, so I'll make a few (somewhat vague) points. This is rather outside my area of knowledge, so I don't have any good sources to examine; but, going exclusively by the contents of the article at the moment, one might draw certain similarities to the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_the_Somme_%281916%29_72c7.html" title="Battle of the Somme (1916)">Battle of the Somme</a> (small, extremely costly advance; failure of actual objectives), which is listed as "Stalemate" with a more detailed explanation in the article. Another idea would be to abandon the concept of "victory" entirely; the field is labeled "Result", and there's no reason why something like "Successful Axis defense" couldn't be used in it. —<a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirill_Lokshin_7618.html" title="User:Kirill Lokshin">Kirill Lok</a><font color="green">s</font><a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirill_Lokshin_7618.html" title="User:Kirill Lokshin">hin</a> 16:09, 16 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Allowing more detailed descriptions might seem like a good idea prima facie, but believe me, if we let a new lapse in standards loose upon the Project, nothing but confusion, ambiguity, and frustration will result (I've generally discouraged even things like "Pyrrhic victory" because of the tendency toward overapplication).

<p>Let us compare two battles:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Sevastopol_2cfd.html" title="Battle of Sevastopol">Battle of Sevastopol</a> October 30, 1941-July 4, 1942 - duration 240+ days</li>

</ul>
<p>If you split BoS into separate assaults comparable in scale with BoKB, you will have, like, at least 20 Soviet victories here that consisted in simply holding off. The same holds for each siege. Essentially it consists of a chain of victories of besieged and possibly (only possibly) one victory of the assaulting side. But this black-and-white won/lost classification for a battle simply does not reflect the reality. To make the classification in unclear cases basing on some objectives set is just as POV as anything else. One may very convincingly argue that the <a href="../../../s/i/e/Siege_of_Sevastopol_962b.html" title="Siege of Sevastopol">Siege of Sevastopol</a> was not one but a chain of Soviet glorious victories, because Sevastopol achieved its objective: to hold off the overwhelming forces.</p>
<p>It is pretty much conuter-intuitive to use the word "victory" in a situation when the winning side's success amounted to sitting tight. IMO the meanigful record for the "outcome" should be <b>"Spanish/Germans held"</b> (notice another problem with the currnt verison, it was not "German" victory, if any, it was <b>Spanish</b>). <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 19:45, 16 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Actually I take the last words back. "sitting tight" is actually called <b>tactical victory</b> in military, and that's what must be written into the battlebox. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 19:52, 16 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Three points:</dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li>At no point was Spain ever at war with the Soviet Union. The Spaniards at Krasny Bor had volunteered for service in a unit of the <a href="../../../w/e/h/Wehrmacht.html" title="Wehrmacht">Wehrmacht</a>, the <i>German</i> army. "Spanish victory" is meaningless; there was no "victory" for Spain.
<dl>
<dd>OK. Still "german victory" sounds a quite misdireced here. I changed for more exact wording "Victory of German side", i.e., of "Germany and its Allies". <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 20:35, 16 March 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>No. None of Germany's "<a href="../../../a/x/i/Axis_Powers_169f.html" title="Axis Powers">allies</a>" were present at the battle. Troops of foreign nationalities all fought in Wehrmacht units as part of the <i>German</i> military apparatus. How is this even a point of contention? I have already compromised on another, more important point, and now you want to dictate the exact wording too?

<li>About Sevastopol, I'm pretty sure the Germans achieved plenty of local tactical victories during that campaign (it would probably look a lot more like <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Gallipoli_132c.html" title="Battle of Gallipoli">Gallipoli</a>, which is sprinkled with a few Allied/Australian victories).

<dd>This of course is not the point. Go look at the battles yourself. Go ahead, it won't take long. You'll find that the campaign is filled <b>overwhelmingly</b> with German victories.

<li>Strictly speaking, a successful defence <i>can</i> have strategic as well as tactical implications. Krasny Bor, as stated above, was a strategic failure for the Soviets.

<dd>Yes it can, if it is on strategic timeframe. In this case, did it tilt the overall scale? By the way, the article is missing an important piece: the place of the battle in the overall flow of events. There is a "Background" section, but it is only half of the history: a prehistory.

<dd>And we might have made more progress at expanding the scope of the article if not for this unbroken chain of counterproductive objections on issues of minor importance.

<dd>Mikka, you are being silly. I am the last person who is going to short-change the Soviet side, if you doubt it, feel free to look at my contributions. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndreas1968_bd6b.html" title="User:Andreas1968">Andreas</a> 07:31, 17 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>With that said, I am really at a loss here. I have given good reasons why <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Glantz_1cea.html" title="David Glantz">David Glantz</a> describes the battle as a Soviet failure - Infantes does too, but he is clearly biased, even though he is giving a good bit of credit to the Soviet side. Glantz is not a person who can be accused to be of the <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Carell_ff4f.html" title="Paul Carell">Paul Carell</a> school of history. All I am getting back is generalised hand-waving, with <b>absolutely no</b> analysis why this view is wrong. You have to do a bit better if you want to convince me that my line of argument is wrong. It is easy. Look at my argument, counter it with facts, source the facts. Then we can talk. At the moment there is none of this. Sevastopol, Borodino, they all have nothing to do with this article, and 'I can not see how this can be described as a German victory' is weasling at its worst. Keep some focus please, and contribute to the discussion. Thanks. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndreas1968_bd6b.html" title="User:Andreas1968">Andreas</a> 06:52, 17 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My focus is very simple and reflected in the title: balck-and-white description almost never reflects real life. The discussion must be <i>not</i> about who have won and who have lost, but what would be most precise (while concise) description of the outcome. This is not, like, a boolean variable that must be assigned a 0/1 value in some database system. This is encyclopedia, which must provide accurate information. My suggestion was to describe it as "tactical victory", presented above, and I don't understand why you are at a loss. As for your "<b>absolultely no</b> analysis" part, excuse me, this is my time to say "I am at a loss". Soviets did move forward against a heavily fortified region, and it is quite reasonable to recognize it as "partial succcess". So I suggest you your own suggestion: keep focus, try to understand what other people say, and avoid personal attacks. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 18:45, 17 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Okay, great. But the humble Battle of Krasny Bor ("Battle?" Who are we kidding? A minor engagement, if even that) is a poor place to start. If you want to make a sweeping reform to the way victories are presented in battleboxes, here's where you'll get your statement across: <a href="../../../s/i/e/Siege_of_Leningrad_5a77.html" title="Siege of Leningrad">Siege of Leningrad</a>. Now <i>that's</i> a battle. And look, the outcome is described as "Soviet victory," what a gross misrepresentation of the facts! Pitiful and laughable, right? Why, the very thought must be gnawing at you right now. After all, like you say, an encyclopaedia must provide accurate information, not black-and-white descriptions or 0/1 booleans. Go on, you can recycle the very arguments you've plastered above. Cut and paste, it's easy. I propose you ask for: "Many partial German successes; destruction of city; eventual lifting of German siege after repeated, costly failures and a huge loss of Soviet life." Now <i>that's</i> accurate. Doesn't it sound much better?</dd>
<dd>I will recognize success in this task as proof of your sincerity. Or does your "very simple focus" fizzle out when the Soviets win? <a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlbrecht_dcaf.html" title="User:Albrecht">Albrecht</a> 02:40, 18 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Come to think of it, that "Decisive Allied victory" over at <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Waterloo_202f.html" title="Battle of Waterloo">Battle of Waterloo</a> is really bugging me. It's a huge distortion; everyone knows that French political crises, not Wellington's victory, is what led to Napoleon's fall. Maybe you can get it changed to: "French do not pierce Allied line." I think that would be much more accurate. Good luck, <a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlbrecht_dcaf.html" title="User:Albrecht">Albrecht</a> 02:44, 18 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Following your advice, I did look thru your contributions and indeed, you demonstrate expertise in the domain. Unfortunately your behavior here is that of an insulted expert. And to the extent of loss of logic. (1) Siege of Leningrad: You obviously don't see a grain of sense in your suggestion, if peeled off some grotesque phrasing. (2) "Proof of sinserity": thank you for not suggesting me to go and reform the whole word to prove that my intentions are not evil. Wikipedia is a cooperative effort. If I will be disagreed by the majority, I will not lose my sleep. (3) "Vaterloo" it is just childish. (4) If you don't want to look for something useful in my suggestion and prefer to wage a battle, please allow me retire from the current thead of discussion. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 03:43, 18 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

When you call a content dispute "vandalism", it is an offense which may lead to admin action. So take care. As for the article, I believe it should be listed for deletion. I googled for Battle of Krasny Bor in Cyrillic and found zero results. Even the websites specifically devoted to the Battle of Leningrad ignore this action. The 1000-page Great Patriotic War Encyclopedia, which enumeratees and details hundreds of military engagements on the Eastern Front, doesn't mention Krasny Bor. Not even once.

<dd>It is actually very simple for you to prove that the article is fantasy. Just show us what 55th Army was doing on 10th - 13th February 1943. Where was it stationed, what were its actions? Provide the sources for your claims (e.g. army war diary), and you can make a case that this was a battle that is a figment of the imagination of the Germans. Soviet sources given by Glantz are Burov <i>Blokada den' za dnem</i> for fighting in the sector and <i>Boevoi sostav chast'</i> for the OOB of 55th Army. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndreas1968_bd6b.html" title="User:Andreas1968">Andreas</a> 10:20, 17 March 2006 (UTC)

I wish some really important event - such as <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Prokhorovka_d7e1.html" title="Battle of Prokhorovka">Battle of Prokhorovka</a> - benefitted from your attention rather than some obscure skirmishes which you claim as German victories. --<a href="../../../g/h/i/User%7EGhirlandajo_b904.html" title="User:Ghirlandajo">Ghirla</a> <sup><a href="../../../g/h/i/User_talk%7EGhirlandajo_34f7.html" title="User talk:Ghirlandajo">-трёп-</a></sup> 12:44, 17 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>As I stated in the discussion of the battle box I think it is not appropriate for small engagements and it should be split to reflect this. The present battle should be a sub-article to <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Polar_Star_b363.html" title="Operation Polar Star">Operation Polar Star</a> which should be a sub-article to the <a href="../../../s/i/e/Siege_of_Leningrad_5a77.html" title="Siege of Leningrad">Siege of Leningrad</a>. All of that does not excuse your bullying behaviour and your start of an edit war in this article, and I have no intention to further discuss more fundamental matters here. Put up or shut up - what did 55th Army do on February 10-13 1943? Where was it? Your veiled accusation that I am hyping up engagements that are German victories is noted. You are talking without any idea of what you are talking about.

<dd>No wonder Ghirlandajo did not find Krasny Bor in Soviet mil books. Indeed, it was one of tens of thousands of engagements, nonnotable from the Soviet point of view. 3 days, 11,000, big deal. On the other hand, it is no wondewr that it is remembered by Spaniards. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 19:17, 17 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I think that is correctly identifying the crux of the issue. It is not an important battle to Germans or Russians, but the Spanish volunteer formation in the east lost almost 50% of <b>all</b> its casualties in the almost three years it was fighting in this one battle. That is why it warrants inclusion, as far as I am concerned. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndreas1968_bd6b.html" title="User:Andreas1968">Andreas</a> 13:50, 19 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Beyond that, there can be <i>no cause</i>, in my view, for belittling an article because it's "not important enough." (barring outright fabrication, etc.) You'll notice that <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Gettysburg_849f.html" title="Battle of Gettysburg">Battle of Gettysburg</a> shares a Campaignbox with e.g. <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Aldie_33e5.html" title="Battle of Aldie">Battle of Aldie</a> and another half-dozen inconclusive skirmishes. The <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_San_Juan_Hill_b32f.html" title="Battle of San Juan Hill">Battle of San Juan Hill</a> is lumped together with a minor action at <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Rio_Manimani_8790.html" title="Battle of Rio Manimani">Manimani</a>. The <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_and_Indian_War_3b82.html" title="French and Indian War">French and Indian War</a> Campaignbox, like the Eastern Front box, includes <i>all</i> actions in that theatre, be they large, decisive engagements like the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_the_Plains_of_Abraham_d8e9.html" title="Battle of the Plains of Abraham">Battle of the Plains of Abraham</a>, the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Sainte-Foy_c254.html" title="Battle of Sainte-Foy">Battle of Sainte-Foy</a>, <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Carillon_2ee8.html" title="Battle of Carillon">Battle of Carillon</a>; or the capture of small frontier posts like <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Fort_Beaus%C3%A9jour_93f9.html" title="Battle of Fort Beauséjour">Fort Beauséjour</a>, <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Fort_Niagara_a385.html" title="Battle of Fort Niagara">Fort Niagara</a>, and <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Fort_Ligonier_afdc.html" title="Battle of Fort Ligonier">Fort Ligonier</a>. Moreover, while the battle proper might be a drop in the bucket of the Eastern Front, it's not like the Soviet 55th Army was a nonentity; a figment of someone's imagination. Had its Krasny Bor offensive been successful, I imagine the Germans at Leningrad would have been left in pretty bad shape, with a ripple effect surging out to all other areas of the front. <a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlbrecht_dcaf.html" title="User:Albrecht">Albrecht</a> 17:22, 19 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
