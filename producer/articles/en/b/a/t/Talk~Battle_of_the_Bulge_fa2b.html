<p>I know of the 1st Canadian Parachute Battalion and the Canadian Forestry Corps at the battle of the Ardennes, why is Canada not listed with Britain and the USA? Wouldn't seem fair... if you can recognize the British at Vimy Ridge with 1 brigade out of 11, you can recognize Canada at the battle of the Ardennes. We don't want to have a double standard at wikipedia do we?</p>

<p>I am "messing" with the US Army casualty figures. The figures I am providing are from an official US Army source, and are consistent with those reported in other official US Army sources including the Army's Official Report on Casualties in WWII.</p>
<p>Don't trust internet sources. They are often wrong.</p>
<p>Best Regards, Philippsbour</p>
<p>Do you think any historian would agree on that number?</p>
<p>1310 Hours 28 March, 2006</p>
<p>Professional military historians work from primary sources as much as possible. In the case of casualty figures, the primary sources are official sources. After all, who counted the dead, wounded, missing, and captured? The U.S. Army. Yes, there are no absolute, hard casualty figures for any battle, but the best we have are those recorded by the U.S. Army, and even they vary somewhat. But they vary only by a relatively small amount, not by tens of thousands, as you would suggest. So the answer to your question is that any professional military historian who has half a brain will have to accept these figures. How else can they arrive at a number? Magic?</p>
<p>Best Regards, Philippsbourg</p>
<p>How long has these numbers been around, since what, a week after the battle? And also you must not think so high about military historians because many would dismiss that number.</p>

<p>One of the common problems, other than my own in adding the numbers incorrectly, is the tendency for the total casualties for both the Ardennes-Alsace campaigns to be added together. Sometimes this is compounded by using figures for the entire theater, rather than the individual campaigns themselves. Yet another is the confusion of double counting casualty figures for units that passed from one command to another. And yet another is the double counting of MIAs who were also POWs, who were also WIA or KIA. All of these things serve to complicate the task of getting to the "more correct" numbers.</p>
<p>I prefer to stick with the official figures for a variety of reasons, including the fact that this reflects the US Army's ability to tally its casualties very quickly using Morning Reports.</p>
<p>Doubling the number of the official numbers without some serious research on which to base them seems to be a poor way to write history.</p>
<p>I forgot to add that the "Medical Service in the ETO" history that I cited was published in 1992.</p>

<p>The numbers in the battlebox are pulled from Parker's book listed in the bibliography. I can find the page if anyone is that curious, but basically pull any legitimate history of the battle and you get figures of oh 70-120 K on either side. Revisionst history certainly has a place, but not in a mainstream article. To contend that the casualty figures are roughly half of accepted figures would deserve its own article and also to be at all consistent would need to encompass standard casualty counting methods throughout the war.

<dl>
<dd>Look, this is BS. Official American U.S. Army sources points out about 81,000, and so has almost every legitimant historical source. Keep your historical revisionism out of articles. We present facts, not reviosinism at Wikipedia.</dd>
</dl>
<p>I have checked several books now and nothing comes close to your number that there were 30,000 US casulties, absolutley nothing. The lowest number i found was about 75,000. I find it very very hard to belive that it would be just 30,000 US casulties when everything ellse says that its not so. To present this at Wikipedia would lower their credablility.</p>

<dd>In numerical terms, it is the largest land battle the U.S. Army has fought to date.... really??? larger than the Battle of Gettysburg? i dont think this is correct.</dd>

<p>I'm not claiming to be an expert on this, but I was reading the Battle of the Bulge article on Encarta 2006 and this was written: <i>“Managing to avoid being cut off by an Allied pincer movement, the Germans withdrew to their own lines in January, but heavy losses, including some 220,000 casualties, contributed to their final collapse in the following spring.”</i> I'm just curious why their casualty number is so much higher than the one here.</p>
<p>That the Germans would have lost nearly 50% of their force seems far fetched...</p>

<p>The official name assigned to the Battle of the Bulge by the U.S. Army is the Battle of the Ardennes.

<p>I've made some fairly substantial edits to the article tonight. Not trying to step on anyone's toes, but some SS hero worship has creeped in, as well as repetitive sentences and a fairly conversational tone. I've injected some economy in the wording - some concepts were spelled out in long run on sentences when really, a wikilink to an article will suffice to inform the reader. I also wonder if the Patton-Montgomery bunfight really needs three paragraphs here - it seems to me to be almost completely irrelevant to the battle, as interesting as it is to an examination of high command in the Second World War. Kudos to the original editors for giving this article a good start. What is needed now are significant numbers of citations for this article, to give it credibility.<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Dorosh_6aa0.html" title="User:Michael Dorosh">Michael Dorosh</a> 04:47, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><i>The Allies' <b>slow</b> response to the penetration set their own offensive timetable back by months.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Is it really true that their response time was slow? Danny S. Parker frequently said it was a "timely Allied reaction". The Wiki itself says, "before the first day was finished, Eisenhower...had ordered vast reinforcements to the area", this was quite contrary to Hitler's belief that it would take 2 or 3 days for an Allied response to commence (and somewhat contradictory to the top quote). Just because it was quicker than Hitler expected I'd want to call it a timely response.</p>
<p>I'll leave it to someone else to change it as I don't know much about this kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Schnozzinkobenstein 19:40, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Two claims in this statement seem almost ludicrously false . . .</p>
<p>First, by what possible standard could the Allied response be considered "slow?" While I don't have the exact figures to hand, consider that the allied forces on the western front were terribly understrength for the front they were covering, they were operating in horrible winter weather, and were overcommitted to winter offensives due to unrealistic estimates of their attacking power relative to their opposition. In spite of this, the 7th and 10th Armored divisions and the 82nd and 101st infantry divisions were in action or committed to the battlefield within forty-eight hours of the opening of the offensive. By the fourth day of the battle, the British 30th Corps was in a blocking position west of the Meuse, effectively negating any potential German strategy victory. Meanwhile, the two most powerful allied armies on the western front, the American 1st and 3rd, had been pulled out of frontline positions and were already containing and counterattacking the flanks of the German offensive. Could any other army in the history of warfare, even the elite German Panzer Armies of 1941-1943, have managed such a manuever under those conditions?</p>
<p>Second, was it not physically impossible for the offensive to have set the the allied offensive timetable back by "months?" The final allied assault into Germany began on February 8, 1945, well before the end of winter and only seven weeks after the beginning of the German counteroffensive. From that day to the German surrender on May 8, 1945, only three months passed. How much faster could the allies have possibly advanced against an army of the quality they faced and under such difficult conditions of weather and terrain?</p>
<p>The consensus among the authors of the many books and articles I've read on this topic over the last thirty years is that Watch on the Rhine shortened the war in Europe by many weeks, rather than lengthening it.</p>

<p>Which spelling convention should be used in this article? At the moment it is a mixture of both, which looks odd to me. --<a href="../../../g/u/i/User%7EGuinnog_5d26.html" title="User:Guinnog">Guinnog</a> 00:08, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As nobody has replied for a few days to this, does anybody mind if I standardise on Commonwealth English? <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia%7EManual_of_Style_350a.html#National_varieties_of_English" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style">Wikipedia:Manual of Style#National varieties of English</a> doesn't clarify which convention we use in an article like this, and it really isn't important to me either. British English is easier for me, although I suppose I could standardise(-ize) it the other way if that were the feeling here. I do think though that having both varieties in the same article looks funny. --<a href="../../../g/u/i/User%7EGuinnog_5d26.html" title="User:Guinnog">Guinnog</a> 15:23, 26 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Done. Went for Brit Eng as that was easier. Made a few other copyedits as well. See what you think. --<a href="../../../g/u/i/User%7EGuinnog_5d26.html" title="User:Guinnog">Guinnog</a> 21:20, 3 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Shouldn't it be American English, since there were more Americans fighting and many more American casualties? According to the article, the Americans had 80,987 casualties while the British had 1,400. --<a href="../../../a/w/i/User%7EAwiseman_3fe1.html" title="User:Awiseman">Awiseman</a> 13:37, 5 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Arguably, yes. Although the Germans had the most casualties of all. I think this is one of these cases where the spelling can simply be decided by a consensus of editors. I waited more than a week before doing my edits to see if there were any opinions about which standard of spelling the article should adopt. If there are strong feelings (ie a consensus) that US English should be used, I can copyedit it again I suppose. But what looked awful (to me at least) was having bits of both in the same article. The relevant policy is at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style#National_varieties_of_English" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style#National_varieties_of_English" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. --<a href="../../../g/u/i/User%7EGuinnog_5d26.html" title="User:Guinnog">Guinnog</a> 13:44, 5 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>True, it should definitely be standardized, whatever it is. I'm not dead-set on American English, it just seems logical to me. --<a href="../../../a/w/i/User%7EAwiseman_3fe1.html" title="User:Awiseman">Awiseman</a> 17:39, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Is it intentional that the only two German divisions mentionned in the article are SS (1st and 12th)?

<p>I replaced the two small scale maps of the Bulge area with one of much larger scale that pinpoints the local terraign.

<dd>I'd prefer the two original ones, if you find them too small you could resize them to 400 or 600 pixel. And if you wish to retain the map you chose at least reduce it to a resolution that's equal or smaller to the actual map file, this looks really awfull.--<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECaranorn_eafd.html" title="User:Caranorn">Caranorn</a> 15:03, 17 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The primary problem with the original maps is the fact that they are both too small to read properly. They make cute pictures as is, but they are not good for following the story line of the article, and they don't have the level of detail found on the official map. -- <a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECORNELIUSSEON_8604.html" title="User:CORNELIUSSEON">SSG Cornelius Seon (Retired)</a> 00:45, 25 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I agree that the one you linked into the article is easier to read (all three are in my opinion bad scans). Concerning the data, the two old maps seem to have about the same ammount of detail (more in some areas like elevations and forest cover). But this is largely an issue of resolution. Either set would be good if they were easily readable. Unfortunatelly none provide their exact source (which book, if in ETO as I assume, what volume...). But I guess now that the one you added is displayed at the correct scale it will do the job. Though I find the divisional/corps sector boundaries in <a href="../../../p/0/8/Image%7EP08-09%28map%29.jpg_d0ab.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/2/2a/P08-09%28map%29.jpg/100px-P08-09%28map%29.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="91" longdesc="../../../p/0/8/Image%7EP08-09%28map%29.jpg_d0ab.html" /></a> useful and if only to show how stretched the US front line was before the offensive (the battleworn 28th and the green 106th with frontages similar to those of german armies).--<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECaranorn_eafd.html" title="User:Caranorn">Caranorn</a> 12:37, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think that there should be some consideration made to the French and Belgians who fought and died in the Battle of the Bulge. As long as the British are being honored for their contibutions then why shouldn't the French and Belgians be too?</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'm not aware of any French troops involved (their major formations fought in Alsace-Lorraine). For the Belgians, by all means, if you have verifiable numbers include them. As a note; several British divisions fought in the campaign, a large part of it was also under British command. So obviously they have to be listed.--<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECaranorn_eafd.html" title="User:Caranorn">Caranorn</a> 12:38, 28 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>To the best of my knowledge, no French troops were involved in this battle. Moreover, I have never heard about casualties within the Belgian troops that could have played a (minor) role in this battle. There were however Belgian civilian casualties mainly due to German <a href="../../../w/a/r/War_crimes.html" title="War crimes">war crimes</a> among others in <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bande.html" title="Bande">Bande</a> and the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stavelot.html" title="Stavelot">Stavelot</a> area or because they were taken under the fire of one or other camp. One can also quote the 200 civilians that were killed during three air bombings made by the US Air Force on <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malmedy.html" title="Malmedy">Malmedy</a> the 23, 24 and 25 December 1944 while the city was in hand of the US troops. Finally, as it still happens today in many war zones after the conflict is over, many civilians were killed in the Ardennes after the end of the battle due to accidents with unexploded shells or grenades or mines that weren't removed.--<a href="../../../l/e/b/User%7ELebob-BE_9c69.html" title="User:Lebob-BE">Lebob-BE</a> 18:01, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

He was apparently inclined to ignore it as he had other things to worry about. A staff member suggested that a reply was necessary, and another staff member suggested that his original comment "Nuts!" was hard to beat.

<p>To have this summarised simply as "Allied victory" in the battlebox, I think is a gross oversimplification. In fact, most of the information in the "Aftermath" section point to it being one of the last major German victories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Allied casualties 70,000-105,000; German 60,000-100,000.</li>
<li>"By the beginning of February 1945, the lines were roughly where they had been in December 1944." Meaning that the Allies effectively lost a month?</li>
<li>A deterioration in relations between Montgomery and his US counterparts</li>
<li>The US became so short of reinforcements in NW Europe, that African Americans were asked to volunteer for mainstream infantry companies for the first time. The only factor which offset this shortage was that the Germans had even fewer reserves</li>
<li>Churchill requesting an offensive from the Soviets to take pressure off the western front</li>
</ul>

<dd>I disagree for the following reasons.
<ul>
<li>The Germans did not even remotely achieve their goals.</li>
<li>The Germans were greatly weakened by the casualties taken during the offensive.</li>
<li>The manpower problems of the US Army were not new, they only became apparent through the offensive. As a fact these manpower problems were one of the reasons for the early German success.</li>
<li>Actually it can be said that there was no to little time lost as the German forces were proportionally weakened much more then the Allies and therefore the 1945 offensive had a better chance then it would have had with even part of the German force involved in the Ardennes left intact.</li>

<dd>I cannot agree with this either. German losses at the battle were roughly on par with American losses, but the Germans were *far* less equipped to replace their losses. Furthermore, the campaign used up most of their remaining fuel, and airpower, and (as Stephen Ambrase posits) the in-detail destruction of the german army outside the seigfriend line probably made the final conquest of Germany far easier. Moreover, at the end of all those losses, they had lost all momentum, were demoralized, and completely on the retreat for good. <a href="../../../r/a/u/User%7ERaul654_54a3.html" title="User:Raul654">Raul654</a> 20:51, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Once again, the overall strategic situation is irrelevant to the outcome of the battle itself, as is 20/20 hindsight; let's stick to the battle itself. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrant65_6b0f.html" title="User:Grant65">Grant</a> | <a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGrant65_a485.html" title="User talk:Grant65">Talk</a> 01:09, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>History - the study of events that have happened - is hindsight by its very definition. So yes, obviously we use hindsight when evaluating who the winners and losers were. In this case, we judge the result of the battle by who benefited more or less from it. The battle finished the Wermacht as a cohesive fighting force. I don't see how that can be called a victory in any circumstances. <a href="../../../r/a/u/User%7ERaul654_54a3.html" title="User:Raul654">Raul654</a> 01:25, 1 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Anyway, the article is not called Overall strategic situation in Europe during January 1945, nor is it about that. The relevant question is: "was the battle seen as a victory by the Allies at the time?" I suggest it was not. They had no real idea of the effect on the Germans; their yardstick was 20,000 dead Americans. That is relevant to the summary in the battlebox. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrant65_6b0f.html" title="User:Grant65">Grant</a> | <a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGrant65_a485.html" title="User talk:Grant65">Talk</a> 04:15, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have added a cite. Here is an abridged version of the 2 cited pages:
<dl>
<dd><i>"So what was the overall impact of the Battle of the Bulge? Since the Allied Offensive was stalling even before the German attack, the over-all length of hostilities was not extended... about 80,000 Germans and 70,000 Americans killed, wounded, and missing... each side lost about 700 tanks. This balance, however, obscures the fact that the Germans had used up their last reverse while the Allied forces, if no longer growing, could rpelace their losses... The dashing of [German] hopes attached to what was understood to be the last throw of the dice necessarily had a redoubled impact [on morale] both at home and at the front.</i></dd>

<p>I don't know about anyone else but that does not say "clear Allied victory" to me, whatever the consequences three or four months later. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrant65_6b0f.html" title="User:Grant65">Grant</a> | <a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGrant65_a485.html" title="User talk:Grant65">Talk</a> 10:06, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Weinberg explicitly notes that as a result of the battle, the Germans (1) didn't prolong the war, (2) didn't achieve a single strategic objective, (3) used up the last of their reserves, (4) took a huge morale blow, and (5) were so weakened on the Eastern front, that it allowed the Soviets to launch a massive offensive even before the battle was over (the <a href="../../../v/i/s/Vistula-Oder_Offensive_5473.html" title="Vistula-Oder Offensive">Vistula-Oder Offensive</a>). I don't see how that can be interpreted as anything but a defeat (and a pretty big one at that). <a href="../../../r/a/u/User%7ERaul654_54a3.html" title="User:Raul654">Raul654</a> 05:35, 2 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Well, then I think the article need to be re-written somewhat to reflect this stuff, because it reads at the moment as though the battle <i>did</i> prolong the war. As I've alluded above, while the Vistula-Oder Offensive is highly significant historically, it is only related indirectly to the Ardennes campaign. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrant65_6b0f.html" title="User:Grant65">Grant</a> | <a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGrant65_a485.html" title="User talk:Grant65">Talk</a> 08:48, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>... I'd like to add to this discussion: I don't think this can be called an 'Allied Victory' either. As far as I know, a victory takes a winner and a loser, like in a football-match. When it's Chelsea 1 - Arsenal 0 this is a victory for Chelsea. The Battle of the Bulge: Chelsea trying to score a goal against Arsenal, failing to do so, result 0 - 0. You can say 'its a victory for Arsenal because they were able to keep Chelsea from scoring', but this is false. It will take the next match (Invasion of Germany) to score the 1 - 0 that makes Arsenal the winner. I hope that with this example I have proved it cannot be called an Allied victory, because nothing was decided yet (even though Chelsea was demoralized etc. etc.). I think Stalemate is the appropriate judgement, with as someone said before Tactical victory to the Germans, but because they spent their last resources for a realistic counterattack in the West a Strategic defeat (for the Germans, meaning Allied Strategic Victory). It would be unfair to judge this as a German defeat looking at what they accomplished fighting vast Allied air formations. So I'll change to Stalemate for now, try to beat my example&#160;;-).</p>

<p>:Your example is just plain wrong. A war (usually) consists of many battles. By your logic, "because nothing was decided yet", all of them but the last one is a stalemate. This is simply not the case. The Germans lost the battle for all of the reasons I have mentioned above, none of which you have responded to. <a href="../../../r/a/u/User%7ERaul654_54a3.html" title="User:Raul654">Raul654</a> 20:23, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>This is a sticky mess. Here and elsewhere, there are debates over the words "victory", "defeat", "stalemate", "decisive", strategic", ad nauseaum. Do we mean the same thing with the same words? Is the outcome in terms of the battle, the theatre, the war? As a community, we need to get a consensus on these descriptions, IMO. FWIW, I'd regard this as a "German failure", as they failed to achieve their objectives, not as a defeat or victory, given the circumstances. Nothing is clearcut. <a href="../../../f/o/l/User%7EFolks_at_137_5f34.html" title="User:Folks at 137">Folks at 137</a> 09:05, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>@ <a href="../../../r/a/u/User%7ERaul654_54a3.html" title="User:Raul654">User:Raul654</a> First of all, my logic does not imply what you think at all, you simply dont want to admit my example is exactly what is going on here. When I claimed nothing was decided yet I was right, because this battle a) did not decide the Western Allies won the war in the West any more than they already had the advantage after landing in Normandy b) did not decide for the Germans they were defeated as the 'real' fight was in the East, their plan to roll the Western Allies back simply failed. I already responded to your arguments about spilt reserves etc., but that the Germans were demoralized and everything does not matter for the dry outcome of this battle (and as such, my example is right). German reserves were inevitably running out before the Battle of the Bulge. Fact is that the Germans scored many tactical victories, only their strategic objectives (which you must not forget were most likely best-case accomplishments, hardly attainable for the German army in their late 1944 state) were failed to attain. What they were able to achieve on the tactical level was still a hard job, just looking at numbers (only 2½ to 1 advantage in ground forces for the initial moments, with inferior air support) showing for some of the last times the German skill in fighting. But the Allies did not win anything from this failure, they actually lost territory and, for a while, the initiative. The outcome was simply a bled-out counteroffensive with a forceful retreat to more stable German defensive lines. Neither an Allied Victory or German defeat as in for example the Soviet Victory at Stalingrad.</p>
<p>And I agree, it does depend on your definition of 'victory', especially in complicated modern warfare with all its levels of operation.</p>
<p>And by the way, this situation can be compared with the German Schlieffen plan of WW1. Here German strategical objectives were failed to accomplish as well, but this is never counted as an Entente victory. The failure of this plan resulted in a stalemate for the next three years on the Western Front. And since this is classified as a stalemate, the Battle of the Bulge should be as well.</p>

<dd>One major difference though, the <a href="../../../s/c/h/Schlieffen_plan.html" title="Schlieffen plan">Schlieffen plan</a> (not a battle by the way) led to fixed fronts (though iirc only after the Race to the Sea). The Ardennes Offensive on the other hand did not lead to any gains (Schlieffen 3 years occupation of most of Belgium, and large parts of France, Ardennes back to the starting positions after roughly two months). The Allies were also able to launch their own offensive in the spring of 1945 so there definitely was no stalemate at this point.--<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECaranorn_eafd.html" title="User:Caranorn">Caranorn</a> 11:15, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>The Schlieffen plan had a similar outcome, it does not matter for the designation if the stalemate lasted for 3 years or 3 days. After the Schlieffen plan failed numerous offensives were launched but the stalemate remained, so just having an offensive doesnt mean theres no stalemate. You cant say 60 years later that because the Battle of the Bulge was followed by a succesful Allied offensive that the whole Battle of the Bulge was an Allied victory, for that no longer was the Battle of the Bulge. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWiki1609_1a74.html" title="User:Wiki1609">Wiki1609</a> 12:32, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Added <a href="../../../f/a/l/Fall_Martin_f5cd.html" title="Fall Martin">Fall Martin</a> and <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Herbstnebel_%28Antwerp%29_aae3.html" title="Operation Herbstnebel (Antwerp)">Operation Herbstenebel</a>. For some reason these operational plans dont appear in the sections dealing with German planning. Did they get removed since being a featured article? This statement: "Several plans for major Western offensives were put forward, but the German High Command quickly concentrated on two" appears to allude to the planning conducted by Jodl.</p>
<ol>
<li>Operation Holland: a single-thrust attack to be launched from the Venlo area, with Antwerp as the objective.</li>
<li>Operation Liège-Aachen: a two-pronged attack with the main effort driving from northern Luxembourg in a northwesterly direction, subsequently turning due north to meet the secondary attack which would be launched from the sector northwest of Aachen.</li>
<li>Operation Luxembourg: a two-pronged attack launched simultaneously from central Luxembourg and Metz to seize Longwy</li>
<li>Operation Lorraine: also a double envelopment, to be launched from Metz and Baccarat and to converge on Nancy.</li>
<li>Operation Alsace: an envelopment to be executed in two thrusts, one originating east of Epinal and the other east of Montbéliard, the juncture to be made in the Vesoul area.</li>
</ol>
<p>Hitler asked for a combination of Operation Holland and Operation Liège-Aachen on 9 October. This was delivered as a full plan by Jodl on 19 October. On 22 October Model and Rundstedt got involved. Article doesnt mention this but continues with mention of "the plan". Can someone include mention of operational plans Herbstnebel &amp; Martin outside of the footnote where I put them (I didnt want to begin an edit war)? Ideally they belong in a main article titled "Wacht am Rhein" which details German planning and operations. <a href="../../../f/l/u/User%7EFluffy999_df6b.html" title="User:Fluffy999">Fluffy999</a> 22:45, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
