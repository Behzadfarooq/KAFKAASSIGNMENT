<p>On 12th February, men of the 1st Battalion Malay Regiment and the 44th Indian Brigade stopped advancing troops of the Japanese 18th Division in their attempts to capture the huge British supply depot at Alexandra Barracks. The Japanese suffered heavy casualties as they come up against Malay Regiment machine-gunners. Heavy fighting continued and the Japanese were reinforced with tanks.</p>
<p>On 13th February, the Japanese 18th Division started to attack the south-western coast along the Pasir Panjang ridge and astride of Ayer Raja Road. The Japanese 56th Infantry Regiment, supported by a considerable force of artillery, attacked the ridge during the morning.</p>
<p>One of the units defending the line was the B Company of the Malay Regiment. Under the heavy fire of the Japanese troops supported by artillery and tanks, B Company was forced to retreat to the rear. But before all of them could retreat, the Japanese army succeeded in breaking through B Company's position. In the battle, B Company troops fought <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hand-to-hand_combat.html" title="Hand-to-hand combat">hand-to-hand combat</a> using bayonets against the Japanese. A few from B Company managed to save themselves while others were caught as prisoners-of-war. This penetration led to the withdrawal after dark of both 44th Indian and 1st Malay Brigade to the general line Mount Echo (junction of Raja and Depot Road) Buona Vista.</p>

<p>On 14th February, the Japanese again launched a heavy attack at 0830 hours, supported by intense mortar and artillery fire, on the front held by the 1st Malay Brigade. The defenders beat off this and a number of other attacks. The fighting included bitter hand-to-hand combat, and losses from both sides were heavy. At 1600 hours an attack supported by tanks eventually succeeded in penetrating the left, and the defenders on this flank were forced back to a line from the junction of the Ayer Rajah and Depot Road through the Brick Works and along the canal to Bukit Chermin. Owing to the failure of units on both its flanks to hold their ground, the 1st Malay Bde withdrew at 1430 hours. It was at this point that C Company of the Malay Regiment received instructions to move to a new defence position, Pt. 226, Opium Hill.</p>
<p>Opium Hill or Bukit Chandu in Malay was named after an opium-processing factory located at the foot of the hill. This was also where C Company of the Malay Regiment made their final stand against the Japanese attack. Opium Hill was a key defence position for two important reasons. It was situated on high ground overlooking the island to the north; and secondly, if the Japanese gained control of the ridge, it gave them direct passage to the Alexandra area. The British army had its main ammunition and supply depots, military hospital and other key installations located in the Alexandra area.</p>
<p>C Company's position was separated from D Company by a big canal. Oil was burning in the canal, which flowed from Normanton Depot. The burning oil prevented C Company soldiers from retreating further south. The company was under the command of Capt H.R. Rix, a brave and daring British officer. He encouraged the men to defend Opium Hill down to the last soldier. His bravery was exemplified in the battle and he was killed together with many of his Malay Regiment soldiers in the last defence battle at Pasir Panjang.</p>

<p>The Japanese troops pressed their attack on Opium Hill in the afternoon but under the guise of a deception. They sent a group of soldiers, dressed in <a href="../../../p/u/n/Punjabi.html" title="Punjabi">Punjabi</a> uniforms, passing themselves off as Punjabi soldiers from the British army. C Company saw through this trick as they knew that soldiers of the British army usually marched in a line of three whereas the Japanese disguised Punjabi soldiers were in a line of four. When the disguised soldiers reached the Malay Regiment's defence line, C Company's squad opened fire on them with their <a href="../../../l/e/w/Lewis_machine_gun.html" title="Lewis machine gun">Lewis machine guns</a>. Some of the Japanese troops were killed and the rest badly wounded. Those who survived rolled and crawled downhill to save themselves.</p>

<p>Two hours later, the dongf launched an all-out assault in great numbers. The attack overwhelmed the strength of the Malay Regiment. Greatly outnumbered and short of ammunition and supplies, the Malay Regiment continued to resist the Japanese troops. All kinds of arms such as grenades, small arms and bayonets were used by troops of the Malay Regiment. It was reported that 2nd Lt Adnan handled a <a href="../../../l/e/w/Lewis_machine_gun.html" title="Lewis machine gun">Lewis machine gun</a> against the Japanese troops. Some soldiers engaged in fierce hand-to-hand combat using bayonets. Yet, they stood their ground frustrating their enemy. In the ensuing battle, men and officers fell. Adnan was seriously wounded but he refused to retreat and instead encouraged his men to fight to the last. It was this disregard of danger that inspired the company to stand up gallantly.</p>
<p>Mubin Sheppard, an ex-officer and former POW, had this to say about his friend, the late <a href="../../../a/d/n/Adnan_Bin_Saidi_be84.html" title="Adnan Bin Saidi">Adnan Bin Saidi</a>, "He was heavily outnumbered by the Japanese they bombed him but he fought on fiercely and inflicted heavy losses on them. Adnan would have never surrendered under any circumstances. He was absolutely dedicated. In fact, just before fighting, he adopted a motto for his platoon, "biar putih tulang, jangan putih mata" (death before dishonour).</p>
<p>Corporal Yaakob -- one of the few survivors at Opium Hill and Medal of Gallant recipient after the war -- was a witness to Adnan Saidi's execution. During the chaos of the battle, Yaakob fell and landed on top of the bodies of the dead soldiers, allowing him to feign death. He said that the resistance of the Malay Regiment angered the Japanese, and when they captured Adnan, they dragged and pushed him into a gunnysack. The Japanese soldiers then hung him by his legs on a <a href="../../../c/h/e/Cherry_tree.html" title="Cherry tree">cherry tree</a> and then bayoneted him again and again. His throat was slit repeatedly. Even after the battle, no one was allowed to bring his body for burial.</p>
<p>Another eyewitness, Burhan Muslim, who had lived along Bukit Chandu, recalled going up the hill with his cousin a few days after the battle. In one of the white <a href="../../../b/u/n/Bungalow.html" title="Bungalow">bungalows</a> that stood on the hill at Pepys Lane, he saw the dismembered bodies of Malay soldiers everywhere. In one of the rooms laid the body of a Malay soldier. His throat had been slit several times. His uniform was soaked with blood. Judging from the badges he had on his uniform, Burhan believed that he was an officer. He felt that the body could have been that of 2nd Lt Adnan Saidi.</p>

<p>For the entire Malayan Campaign, but largely on 12, 13 and 14 February 1942 in Singapore, the Malay Regiment suffered a total of 159 killed (six British officers, seven Malay officers, and 146 other ranks) and a large but unspecified number wounded. It remains unclear as to how many the Japanese lost, but it is certain that their casualty numbers are far greater than their counterparts.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Pasir_Panjang_5fac.html" title="Edit section: Conclusion">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Conclusion</span></h2>
<p>The Battle of Pasir Panjang had little strategic significance. The battle could not change the outcome of the fate of Singapore and it was a matter of time before the British would surrender to the Japanese 25th Army. Those who look at only the tactical significance, however, will miss a very important lesson. The Battle of Pasir Panjang, and the Battle of Opium Hill in particular, manifested the acme of the fighting spirit in battle. In the words of Noel Barber, the author of Sinister Twilight, the Malay Regiment was described thus: "A regular, locally raised unit, commanded by Malay-speaking British officers, it was a living and dying illustration of the folly of not having raised more such local forces before the war in which men could defend what was their homeland."</p>
<p>And as <a href="../../../a/r/t/Arthur_Ernest_Percival_0380.html" title="Arthur Ernest Percival">Percival</a> noted, the Malay Regiment: "showed what esprit de corps and discipline can achieve. Garrisons of posts held their ground and many of them were wiped out almost to a man."</p>
<p>The 48-hour Battle of Pasir Panjang put up by men and officers of the Malay Regiment exemplified the highest form of "duty, honour and country" that soldiers can show in war. The courage, bravery, and sacrifice to defend Singapore island despite the foregone defeat of British forces will always remain one of the highlights in the story of the Battle of Singapore."</p>
