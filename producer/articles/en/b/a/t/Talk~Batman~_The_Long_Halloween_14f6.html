<p>I'd like to see references to the idea that "Batman: The Long Halloween" had anything to do with <i>Batman Begins</i> (except that Christopher Nolan was reading way too many Batman trade paperbacks). There's nothing from the story arc in the movie. -<a href="../../../a/c/j/User%7EAcjelen_acd8.html" title="User:Acjelen">Acjelen</a> 04:56, 20 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>It was from the IMDb trivia section for Batman Begins. Although I agree, I didn't see much of the comic in the movie. <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanadianCaesar_5124.html" title="User:CanadianCaesar">CanadianCaesar</a> 21:41, 24 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>There's a lot of doubtful stuff on that IMDb trivia page. If the quote is legit, I'm not sure what Mr. Goyer means by it. -<a href="../../../a/c/j/User%7EAcjelen_acd8.html" title="User:Acjelen">Acjelen</a> 22:41, 24 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think it just means the style and tone of the comic is what inspired and was incorporated into Batman Begins, not necessarily a plot element. 64.53.130.241 16:15, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Okay, read through Long Halloween twice, still a bit confused. Who killed who? Who really is Holiday? Alberto confessed to the police, Gilda has a personal confession to the first three and says Harvey did the rest, Sofia did April Fools. What did Alberto do? Someone please help.</p>
<dl>
<dd>It is mostly accepted that Alberto commited about 95% of the killings. He was always distanced from his father, <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carmine_Falcone_1434.html" title="Carmine Falcone">Carmine Falcone</a>, and despite his top marks at <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harvard.html" title="Harvard">Harvard</a> and <a href="../../../o/x/f/Oxford_University_9d97.html" title="Oxford University">Oxford University</a>, he could not fit into the family. Determined to win his father's acceptance, he obviously killed his cousin Johnny Vitti in the bathtub. I mean, even if she was Holiday, how could Gilda Dent have gotten past security to kill Johnny, gotten a gun and bullets, and knew pretty much everything about him??? Isn't Harvey supposed to keep criminal records away from her and the public, as it's confidental?</dd>
</dl>
<p>Then, the Irish gang is killed while sitting down to dinner. It is not possible for Gilda to have done this, since she was bedridden in the hospital after the gang attempted to blow up Harvey in the explosion in issue one. Some may think that it was an act of revenge, as they blew up her house and nearly killed her and Harvey. Next, Falcone's enforcer and (although faked) and Alberto are killed. Something tells me that Alberto did all the killings, save for those of Falcone and Maroni, as both ruined Harvey Dent's face and life. Gilda could be a victim of post-traumatic shock or schizophrenia, in which she is creating a confession in her mind. However, all the evidence that she could kill is not enough to verify her role, so Alberto and Two-Face are the real killers, although Two-Face might have been trying to blame somebody else when he said there were two Holiday Killers. -<a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonathan.Bruce_9151.html" title="User:Jonathan.Bruce">Jonathan.Bruce</a> 05:36 25 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I always thought Long Halloween started in Year Three, and ended in Year Four and up until recently this page seemed to follow that (also Dark Victory would then start in Year Four and end in Year Five). I know that Long Halloween is a sequel in content to Year One, but that doesn't mean it starts right after. Also, it starts in October and Year One ends in December, so it's AT LEAST Year Two/Year Three, not Year One/Year Two. It seems to me the timeline needs room between them for Man Who Laughs and Legends of the Dark Knight and Fear the Reaper - etc. So, what's the deal?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Since you requested help, here is what has been accepted as official continuity....</dd>
</dl>
<p>According to Wikipedia's official <a href="../../../d/c/_/DC_Comics_Timeline_5223.html" title="DC Comics Timeline">DC Comics Timeline</a>, Bruce Wayne was born 35 to 36 years ago (in their time) and returned to Gotham at 23 and became Batman (it is said under the <i>13 Years Ago</i> heading). The events of <i>Year One</i> take place in that year, around mid winter to spring, since it is snowning during the final part of the story. Batman: The Man Who Laughs takes place between Year One and Long Halloween, since it is only a few weeks in the storyline. The Long Halloween, chronlogically beginning with Falcone's nephew's wedding, takes place in June of that same year, and the Holiday murders begin that October of that year, starting with Johnny Vitti's murder. All through the next year, including the birth of Two-Face and Falcone's death, this is all part of Year Two. The end of that year and most of the next year is the events of Dark Victory: the Hangman murders and Robin's origin. This is an unofficial "Year Three" of sorts. If the Wikipedia timeline is said to be accurate, then Bruce Wayne has been Batman since 23 for 13 years, although it should officially be 12, as he retired for most of the Lost Year following the events of the Infinite Crisis.</p>
<p>That's what everybody says is accurate; hope it helps! --<a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonathan.Bruce_9151.html" title="User:Jonathan.Bruce">Jonathan.Bruce</a> 3:50 8 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
