<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Washita_River_a6cf.html" title="Edit section: The cause: Black Kettle's war against Kansas">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The cause: Black Kettle's war against Kansas</span></h2>
<p>The historical accounts which depict the events leading to the Battle of Washita make mention of two noteworthy items. Firstly, there was a breakdown in communication between the Indians and their agent. <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philip_Sheridan_7662.html" title="Philip Sheridan">Philip Sheridan</a> describes this in his 1868 annual report writing, "Troops were sent twice or three times to Cobb, on requisition of the agent, who appeared to be constantly in trouble, either through his own fault or that of the Indians—most probably the latter, as they told me they did not like him..."</p>
<p>The second item involves the raiding of <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kansas.html" title="Kansas">Kansas</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colorado.html" title="Colorado">Colorado</a> which resulted in the loss of American lives and property. On August 10 1868, 200 Cheyenne warriors massacred more than 117 civilians, men, women and children in Kansas. Black Kettle's guiltiness was known after Little Rock's testimony, on August 19 1868. Talking to Edward Wynkoop, US agent, Little Rock, second-in-command of Black Kettle's village, admitted Black Kettle's crimes and said that most of the warriors came back to Black Kettle's camp after the massacres. Aaron Bell and her family, from Kansas, Mister Shaw and his family, Mister Bassett and his family, Mister Bogardus were listed among the victims of the Cheyennes. Many children were taken hostage and/or raped by the Cheyennes, who eventually killed them or sold them to the Mexicans. To deal with the delinquent Indians, Sheridan, with Custer in his command, devised a plan to destroy the Indian’s winter provisions subsequently forcing them onto the reservations.</p>
<p>After the raiding of Kansas began (or the Solomon and Saline River Massacres, in which more than 200 civilians were killed by the Cheyennes and several raped and caught prisoners), a <a href="../../../f/r/e/Free-fire_zone.html" title="Free-fire zone">free-fire zone</a> was established and all non-hostile Indians were ordered to move south to the Washita River. Washita was a desirable wintering location for several reasons. Among these was that along the north bank of the river there were tall bluffs which served as a natural wind block while abundant grasslands covered the southern portion of the river offering good feed for Indian horses. Richard White describes Black Kettle’s arrival to the Washita River valley thus: "Black Kettle, the survivor of Sand Creek, journeyed to the Washita, seeking to include his band among the friendlies. But since many of his young men were raiding, the Americans rebuffed him. He made camp at the Washita anyway..."</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Washita_River_a6cf.html" title="Edit section: The battle">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The battle</span></h2>
<p>On <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_27.html" title="November 27">November 27</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/6/1868.html" title="1868">1868</a> Custer’s <a href="../../../o/s/a/Osage_Nation_f0f7.html" title="Osage Nation">Osage Nation</a> scouts located the trail of an Indian war party. Custer followed this trail all day without break until nightfall. Upon nightfall there was a short period of rest until there was sufficient moonlight to continue. Eventually they reached Black Kettle’s village. Custer divided his force into four parts, each moving into position so that at first daylight they could all simultaneously converge on the village. At daybreak the four columns attacked. The Indian warriors quickly left their lodges to take cover behind trees and in deep ravines. Custer was able to take control of the village quickly, but it took longer to quell all remaining resistance.</p>
<p>Washita prisoners (53 women and children) testified that as many as 11 warchiefs and headmen were killed that day. Custer wrote that Indian losses were probably 130 warriors killed (some sources stated that 150 warriors were killed). Between 19 and 25 civilians had been killed according to Washita prisoners and Kiowa witnesses.</p>
<p>Osage scouts left Washita with Black Kettle's scalp. Following the capture of Black Kettle's village Custer was soon to find himself in a precarious position.</p>
<p>As the fighting was beginning to subside Custer began to notice large groups of mounted Indians gathering on nearby hilltops. He quickly learned that Black Kettle's village was only one of the many Indian villages encamped along the river. Fearing an attack he ordered some of his men to take defensive positions while the others were to gather the Indian belongings and horses. What the Americans did not want or could not carry, they destroyed. Custer feared the outlying Indians would find and attack his supply train so near nightfall he began marching toward the other Indian encampments. Seeing that Custer was approaching their villages the surrounding Indians retreated to protect their families from a fate similar to that of Black Kettle's village. At this point Custer turned around and began heading back towards his supply train, which he eventually reached. Thus the Battle of Washita was concluded.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Washita_River_a6cf.html" title="Edit section: The accounts of the battle">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The accounts of the battle</span></h2>
<p>Historical accounts make no mention of Black Kettle’s request to camp as a friendly tribe or of the free fire zone enacted in Kansas. In this sense the historical documents seem biased toward the Americans. While the historical documents tend to lean towards the American perspective, modern accounts, in describing the events prior to the battle, seem to remain largely objective and neutral.</p>
<p>The modern accounts of the Battle of Washita, and Richard White's work, <i>It's Your Misfortune and None of My Own</i>, tend to lose their neutrality while describing the battle. Richard White illustrates this trend by describing the battle as "Once more American soldiers attacked a Cheyenne village that consisted largely of women and children." This is further demonstrated when Custer was described as being lucky to survive the battle. Since Custer’s own account of the battle contained the most information regarding the battle itself, the battle is described from his viewpoint. But there are contrasts between the historical and modern accounts.</p>
<p>The greatest difference between the modern and historical accounts is whether Washita is described as a battle or a massacre. Modern historians tend to lean towards the massacre side as White illustrates by writing "...American soldiers attacked, and...slaughtered a camp...of women and children." White, however, provides no evidence to support this claim. Custer certainly did not consider Washita a massacre. He does mention that some women took weapons and were subsequently killed. This seems logical since it was four years earlier when <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Chivington_44bd.html" title="John Chivington">Chivington</a> stormed through <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sand_Creek_Massacre_25cf.html" title="Sand Creek Massacre">Sand Creek</a> slaughtering many men and women. With this thought in their minds, women would certainly have felt uneasy with American soldiers in their midst. Custer did leave Washita with women and children prisoners; he did not simply kill every Indian in the village, though he admittedly couldn't avoid killing women in the middle of the hard fight.</p>
<p>Historian Jerome Greene wrote a book about the encounter in 2004, for the National Park Service. He concluded: "Soldiers evidently took measures to protect the women and children." (<i>Washita 1868</i>, Norman, <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Oklahoma_Press_50e1.html" title="University of Oklahoma Press">University of Oklahoma Press</a>, p. 189.)</p>
<p>Another area of comparison between modern and historic accounts is the story of Major Elliot. Elliot, who died in the battle, commanded one of the four columns that attacked the village. Neither the modern nor historic account of the battle can precisely describe the circumstances of his death. One version is that he ventured too far east and was killed while encountering other tribes of Indians. Historic accounts of Elliot's story are similar, as Custer briefly describes in his autobiography. Apparently one of Custer's scouts saw Elliot chase some of the Cheyenne Indians west that were escaping from Black Kettle's village. A difference between the two accounts of the battle is whether Custer searched for Elliot after his disappearance. Custer says he did. "Parties were sent in the direction indicated by the scout, he accompanying them; but after a search extending nearly two miles all the parties returned, reporting their efforts to discover some trace of Elliot and his men fruitless."</p>
<p>The last common point of interest was the loss of the cavalry's great coats. Custer had his men set their coats aside prior to the battle, which allowed the Indians to capture them. Custer admits to this in his account. He had ordered the men to take off their coats so they would have greater maneuverability. Not mentioned in the modern accounts was that Custer's men also had left their rations behind. Custer left a small guard with the coats and rations but the Indian attackers were too numerous and the guard fled.</p>
<p>From both the historic and modern accounts we can determine that the cause of the Battle of Washita was a breakdown in Indian to agent communications which resulted in Indian massacres of settlers.</p>
