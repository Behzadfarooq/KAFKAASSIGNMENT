<p><b>Batu Lintang camp</b> (also known as <b>Lintang Barracks</b> and <b>Kuching POW camp</b>) at <a href="../../../k/u/c/Kuching.html" title="Kuching">Kuching</a>, <a href="../../../s/a/r/Sarawak.html" title="Sarawak">Sarawak</a> on the island of <a href="../../../b/o/r/Borneo.html" title="Borneo">Borneo</a> was a <a href="../../../e/m/p/Empire_of_Japan_4a4a.html" title="Empire of Japan">Japanese</a> internment camp during the <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_World_War_e58d.html" title="Second World War">Second World War</a>. It was unusual in that it housed both <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allies_of_World_War_II_afb4.html" title="Allies of World War II">Allied</a> <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prisoner_of_war.html" title="Prisoner of war">prisoners of war</a> (POWs) and <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internment.html" title="Internment">civilian internees</a>. The camp, which operated from March 1942 until the liberation of the camp in September 1945, was housed in buildings that were originally <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Indian_Army_4a5e.html" title="British Indian Army">British Indian Army</a> barracks. The camp population fluctuated, due to movement of prisoners between camps in Borneo, and as a result of the deaths of the prisoners. It had a maximum population of some 3,000 prisoners.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Life in the camp was harsh, with POWs and internees alike forced to endure food shortages, disease and sickness for which scant medicine was made available, <a href="../../../u/n/f/Unfree_labour.html" title="Unfree labour">forced labour</a>, brutal treatment, and lack of adequate clothing and living quarters. The construction and operation of a secret <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radio.html" title="Radio">radio</a> for over 2Â½ years, from February 1943 until the liberation of the camp, was a morale booster and allowed the prisoners to follow the progress of the war. Discovery would have resulted in certain death for those involved.</p>
<p>Following the unconditional <a href="../../../s/u/r/Surrender_of_Japan_510b.html" title="Surrender of Japan">surrender of Japan</a> on 15 August 1945, the camp was liberated on 11 September 1945 by the <a href="../../../9/t/h/9th_Division_%28Australia%29_5f5f.html" title="9th Division (Australia)">Australian 9th Division</a>. On liberation, the camp population was 2,024, of whom 1,392 were POWs, 395 were male civilian internees and 237 were civilian women and children. Of the 2,000-odd <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">British</a> POWs held there, over two thirds died during or as a result of their captivity.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup> Amongst official Japanese papers found at the camp following its liberation were two "death orders". Both described the proposed method of <a href="../../../e/x/e/Execution.html" title="Execution">execution</a> of every POW and internee in the camp. The first order, scheduled for enactment on for 17 or 18 August, was not carried out; the second was scheduled to take place on 15 September. The timely liberation of the camp prevented the murder of over 2,000 men, women and children.</p>

<p>The camp commandant was Lieutenant-Colonel (Lt.-Col.) Tatsuji Suga. Suga was the commandant of all <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prisoner-of-war_camp.html" title="Prisoner-of-war camp">POW</a> and interneesâ camps in North Borneo; there were <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Japanese_POW_camps_during_World_War_II_44ae.html" title="List of Japanese POW camps during World War II">others</a> at <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesselton.html" title="Jesselton">Jesselton</a> (later Kota Kinabalu), <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sandakan.html" title="Sandakan">Sandakan</a> and briefly on <a href="../../../l/a/b/Labuan.html" title="Labuan">Labuan</a> island,<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[10]</a></sup> and he was often absent from Batu Lintang as a result. His second-in-command was Lieutenant (later Captain) Nagata (some sources say Negata or Nekata). Most of the camp guards were <a href="../../../k/o/r/Koreans.html" title="Koreans">Koreans</a>, with a few <a href="../../../t/a/i/Taiwanese_people.html" title="Taiwanese people">Formosans</a> (Taiwanese).<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[11]</a></sup> There was a range of administrative buildings, quartermasterâs stores, guard houses, guardsâ quarters and a camp hospital. Throughout its operation all the camps at Batu Lintang, including the internee ones, were conducted under prisoner-of-war rules. <sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>
<p>The entire camp was surrounded by a five mile (eight kilometre) perimeter barbed wire fence. The internees were segregated into categories and assigned separate compounds, each of which was also surrounded by barbed wire fencing. There were between eight and ten compounds,<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[13]</a></sup> although their make-up varied through the period of operation of the camp.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[14]</a></sup> The make-up was determined by the arrival and departure of different groups of prisoners as Batu Lintang camp was also used as a transit camp: at one point some of the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australian</a> and British soldiers who were later to die on the <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sandakan_Death_Marches_fd1f.html" title="Sandakan Death Marches">Sandakan Death Marches</a> were held at the camp.<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[15]</a></sup></p>
<p>The main groups of internees were British <a href="../../../o/f/f/Officer_%28military%29.html" title="Officer (military)">officers</a>, Australian officers and <a href="../../../n/o/n/Non-commissioned_officer.html" title="Non-commissioned officer">non-commissioned officers</a> (NCOs), <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Netherlands_East_Indies_Army_98f7.html" title="Royal Netherlands East Indies Army">Royal Netherlands East Indies Army</a> (KNIL) officers, British other ranks, British Indian Army (2nd/15th Punjab Regiment) personnel, <a href="../../../n/e/t/Netherlands_East_Indies_cfb0.html" title="Netherlands East Indies">Netherlands East Indies</a> (Indonesian) soldiers, Dutch <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holy_Orders_63e3.html" title="Holy Orders">Roman Catholic priests</a>, male civilian internees, and female civilian internees (including Catholic <a href="../../../n/u/n/Nun.html" title="Nun">nuns</a>), as well as children.</p>
<p>Each compound had its own "camp master" (or "camp mistress", in the case of the women's camp). The camp master was responsible for liaising between the internees and the Japanese authorities. Each compound contained a number of long barrack buildings, usually between 80 and 100 feet long (24-30 metres), each of which housed between 30 and 100 people. A barrack master was appointed for each building. The camp and barrack masters were appointed by Colonel Suga.</p>
<p>In addition, the Dutch other ranks and about 50 British soldiers were stationed in a separate compound at the Kampong Batu Tujoh airfield (also known as Bukit Stabah), near Kuching.<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[16]</a></sup></p>

Their quarters were described by an internee as "new and fair" and "they had a reason[able] area for cultivation."

<p>The male civilian internees' regulations (prepared by the internees themselves) stated that "Any persons who are not performing some useful work in war-time are failing in their moral obligation.

Some refused to carry out this work, even though it was for the common good.<sup id="_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#_note-38" title="">[39]</a></sup> Work included wood-gathering parties, latrine duties, working as cookhouse staff and medical orderlies.<sup id="_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#_note-39" title="">[40]</a></sup> Sundays were a rest day, but these were later cut to one in every three weeks.<sup id="_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="#_note-40" title="">[41]</a></sup></p>

<p>Rations were always meagre but decreased in both quantity and quality as the war progressed. The women and children drew the same rations as the men. The Japanese controlled all food supplies, releasing only what was needed for the day.<sup id="_ref-50" class="reference"><a href="#_note-50" title="">[51]</a></sup> At the beginning, the rations comprised rice and native vegetables, with every ten days or so some pork (such as offal, or a head, or some poor-meat bearing part of the animal). The daily rice ration in late 1943 was 11 ounces (312 grams) a day;<sup id="_ref-51" class="reference"><a href="#_note-51" title="">[52]</a></sup> by the end of the war the rice ration was about 4 ounces (113 grams) per man daily.<sup id="_ref-52" class="reference"><a href="#_note-52" title="">[53]</a></sup> In September 1944 children were recorded as receiving 1Â½ ounces (42.5 mls) of milk a day.<sup id="_ref-53" class="reference"><a href="#_note-53" title="">[54]</a></sup></p>
<p>At the times of greatest hardship the internees were so hungry that they were reduced to eating snakes, rubber nuts (which were believed to be poisonous), snails and frogs, and rats, cats and dogs if they could be caught.<sup id="_ref-54" class="reference"><a href="#_note-54" title="">[55]</a></sup> On special occasions an extra ration would be introduced. In the British POW camps, 58 chickens were provided for 1,000 men for Christmas 1942;<sup id="_ref-55" class="reference"><a href="#_note-55" title="">[56]</a></sup> the next Christmas the women received a single turkey to share between 271 women and children.<sup id="_ref-56" class="reference"><a href="#_note-56" title="">[57]</a></sup> At Christmas 1944, their last in captivity, the internees received a single egg each.<sup id="_ref-57" class="reference"><a href="#_note-57" title="">[58]</a></sup></p>
<p>Only one <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_Cross_7021.html" title="Red Cross">Red Cross</a> supply of parcels was received by the prisoners between March 1942 and September 1945.

<p>A camp hospital was set up and run by a Japanese medical officer, Dr. Yamamoto, but it was believed by the prisoners that his policy was "live and let die,"<sup id="_ref-60" class="reference"><a href="#_note-60" title="">[61]</a></sup> and the hospital became "a filthy germ-ridden death hole."<sup id="_ref-61" class="reference"><a href="#_note-61" title="">[62]</a></sup> Lionel E.

However, as the prisoners pooled their food, the sick were provided for even though it meant all others went short.<sup id="_ref-63" class="reference"><a href="#_note-63" title="">[64]</a></sup> Care of all prisoners was left to the camp doctors, such as Colonel King and Captain Bailey in the main camp and Dr. Gibson in the womenâs camp.<sup id="_ref-64" class="reference"><a href="#_note-64" title="">[65]</a></sup></p>
<p>In January 1943 the hospital comprised three huts, and housed both POWs and civilians. The standard of accommodation was very low and crowded, and facilities were virtually non-existent. Later a hut was built for tuberculosis patients.<sup id="_ref-65" class="reference"><a href="#_note-65" title="">[66]</a></sup> In early September 1945 the camp hospital comprised about 30 beds, under the care of Lt.-Col. E. M. Sheppard.<sup id="_ref-66" class="reference"><a href="#_note-66" title="">[67]</a></sup></p>
<p>Little medicine was available to the internees from the Japanese: they provided small amounts of quinine and aspirins. Morris recounts how Yamamoto would quite often beat sick men until they fell down, especially if they approached him for drugs.<sup id="_ref-67" class="reference"><a href="#_note-67" title="">[68]</a></sup> Few Red Cross supplies were available and most medication was bought or bartered from the outside world or from the guards themselves. No anaesthesia was available for operations.<sup id="_ref-68" class="reference"><a href="#_note-68" title="">[69]</a></sup> In early 1943 the main source of medical supplies was a pro-Allied <a href="../../../o/v/e/Overseas_Chinese_da26.html" title="Overseas Chinese">ethnic Chinese</a> family who lived nearby and were assisting in the provision of materials for the construction of a radio.<sup id="_ref-69" class="reference"><a href="#_note-69" title="">[70]</a></sup></p>

<p>The mortality rate amongst the British soldiers was extremely high: two-thirds of the population of POWs died in the camp.<sup id="_ref-70" class="reference"><a href="#_note-70" title="">[71]</a></sup> It was suggested that this high rate was because most had come direct from Europe and were not acclimatised and had no idea about the importance of tropical hygiene.

<p>Malnutrition caused most of the invalidity and was a major factor in the high mortality rate in the camp, ascribed as the chief cause of death in 600 deaths in the camp. The basic diet only contained 1.5 ounces (44 grams) of protein and had a calorific value of 1600.<sup id="_ref-73" class="reference"><a href="#_note-73" title="">[74]</a></sup> J. L. Noakes, a male civilian internee wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In common with many others I experienced the pain of food deficiency disease and by May 1944 it was difficult to work and nights were a torture. My eyes failed rapidly and it became impossible to read or to distinguish objects clearly. The death rate for the whole camp jumped at an alarming rate and we began to realise that we must now begin a real fight for existence."<sup id="_ref-74" class="reference"><a href="#_note-74" title="">[75]</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>By November 1944 the suffering caused by malnutrition was profound, as recorded by Hilda E. Bates, a female civilian internee who was a nurse based in Jesselton prior to the war:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We are having a particularly hungry period and [I] can quite truthfully say that our mouths water, and that we 'slaver' as dogs do before meals. Some of us find it advisable to rise slowly after lying down, as due to malnutrition, any rapid movement is apt to cause dizziness or even a black-out ... one morning recently I awoke and discovered to my horror that my sight had become very dim. Later I realised this was due to vitamin deficiency in our poor diet."<sup id="_ref-75" class="reference"><a href="#_note-75" title="">[76]</a></sup></p>

<p>By the end of their third year of internment, most women suffered from <a href="../../../a/m/e/Amenorrhoea.html" title="Amenorrhoea">amenorrhoea</a> due to malnutrition.<sup id="_ref-76" class="reference"><a href="#_note-76" title="">[77]</a></sup></p>
<p>In May 1945 Hilda Bates met some of the male civilian internees at the funeral of a friend:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I was horrified to see their condition. Some had formerly been strong men of twelve to fourteen stone [168-196 lbs/76.5-89 kgs] in weight, but were now reduced to mere shadows of themselves, and weighed less than eight stone [112 lbs/51 kgs]. .. [In] the soldiers camp ... many of the men were just skeletons, â crawling about, as few were able to stand upright. Even our toddlers received the same rations as these poor [souls], and the children are still hungry, so what must have been the suffering of those men, many of whom are hardly more than boys?"<sup id="_ref-77" class="reference"><a href="#_note-77" title="">[78]</a></sup></p>

<blockquote>
<p>"I was horrified to see the condition of some of the men. I was pretty well hardened to sickness, dirt and disease, but never had I seen anything like this in all my years of nursing. Pictures of hospitals during the <a href="../../../c/r/i/Crimean_War_40b1.html" title="Crimean War">Crimean War</a> showed terrible conditions, but even those could not compare with the dreadful sights I met on this visit. Shells of men lay on the floor sunken-eyed and helpless; some were swollen with hunger, <a href="../../../o/e/d/Oedema.html" title="Oedema">oedema</a> and ber-beri, others in the last stages of dysentery, lay unconscious and dying. They had no pillows or clothes, few cups, fewer bowls, or even medical supplies. [...] There were three hundred desperately sick men, many unable to help themselves, or to carry food to their mouths.

<p>Brutality by the guards was another factor that adversely affected the health of many of the prisoners. Hilda Bates described the guards' treatment of the male prisoners: "Their favourite methods of punishment are either kicking below the waist with their heavy army boots, face slapping or striking the head with a rifle butt".<sup id="_ref-80" class="reference"><a href="#_note-80" title="">[81]</a></sup> Failure to bow properly to a guard was a common cause of a beating. Hilda Bates wrote of "One male internee [who] was paralysed for a week following Japanese brutality, simply because he had not made his bow in what the Japs considered a proper manner".<sup id="_ref-81" class="reference"><a href="#_note-81" title="">[82]</a></sup> E. R. Pepler recorded that "a favourite punishment was to make the offender stand in the blazing sun with his arms above his head holding a log of wood. If the prisoner or his arms sagged, he was punched or kicked. This treatment usually lasted until the prisoner completely collapsed".<sup id="_ref-82" class="reference"><a href="#_note-82" title="">[83]</a></sup></p>
<p>After the Japanese defeat, an Australian war crimes investigation team worked in Kuching from the liberation until January 1946. Of around 120 guards, more than 70 had a crime or crimes ascribed to them.<sup id="_ref-83" class="reference"><a href="#_note-83" title="">[84]</a></sup></p>
<p>Prisoners suspected of more serious misdemeanours were taken by the Japanese secret military police, the <a href="../../../k/e/m/Kempeitai.html" title="Kempeitai">Kempeitai</a>, for interrogation at the former Sarawak Police headquarters in Kuching. <a href="../../../t/o/r/Torture.html" title="Torture">Torture</a> was a common method of extracting information.<sup id="_ref-84" class="reference"><a href="#_note-84" title="">[85]</a></sup></p>

<p>Prisoners were able to buy a small range of provisions from their captors at Japanese prices, which escalated as the war went on.<sup id="_ref-85" class="reference"><a href="#_note-85" title="">[86]</a></sup> <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_market.html" title="Black market">Black marketeering</a> was sometimes tolerated by the guards, as they themselves were involved in the buying or exchanging of goods, and at other times punished severely. Although contact with the outside world was forbidden, there were plenty of opportunities to communicate with the locals.

<p>Smuggling became an integral part of camp life, and despite frequent searches, foodstuffs in particular were smuggled into the camp (for example, dried fish was nailed to the underside of wooden bins, and the inside of a hat was a favourite hiding place).<sup id="_ref-89" class="reference"><a href="#_note-89" title="">[90]</a></sup> Occasional dangerous night-time forays to outside the camp netted foodstuffs such as a chicken or eggs or fruit.<sup id="_ref-90" class="reference"><a href="#_note-90" title="">[91]</a></sup></p>
<p>Realising the limitations of the barter situation, the Japanese introduced a camp currency. Internees working on work parties received pay, in the form of "camp dollars".

<p>Clothing wore out quickly: the tropical climate meant that clothes had to be washed every day, and the rigours of labouring in them meant that they soon became torn, worn and threadbare. The Japanese did not provide replacement clothing for the prisoners when their clothes wore out.<sup id="_ref-92" class="reference"><a href="#_note-92" title="">[93]</a></sup> After a period male internees and POWs were issued with a loincloth and perishable rubber shoes, which soon degraded and meant in effect that most prisoners went barefoot.<sup id="_ref-93" class="reference"><a href="#_note-93" title="">[94]</a></sup> The women fared a little better, often bartering possessions for material: clothes were fashioned out of whatever material was to hand, such as sheets and breakfast cloths.<sup id="_ref-94" class="reference"><a href="#_note-94" title="">[95]</a></sup> Many of the women kept their best clothes unworn in readiness for their expected eventual liberation, while their other clothes became more and more shabby.</p>
<p>Prior to their liberation, supplies were dropped by the Australians. Hilda Bates recorded: "The soldiers received shorts, shoes, and blankets with instructions not to appear naked in future!".<sup id="_ref-95" class="reference"><a href="#_note-95" title="">[96]</a></sup></p>

A section of the cemetery at Batu Lintang camp.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Initially the dead were buried in the cemetery at Kuching. However, the high death rate meant that this was soon filled, and so in November 1942 a new cemetery area was created next to the camp, at an area to the south-east known as "Boot Hill". The cemetery was within sight of the camp.<sup id="_ref-101" class="reference"><a href="#_note-101" title="">[102]</a></sup> At first the dead were buried in coffins, but soon the number of fatalities and the shortage of timber meant that shrouds made from rice sacks or blankets were used instead. The bodies were carried to the grave in a wooden coffin with a hinged bottom, which allowed reuse.<sup id="_ref-102" class="reference"><a href="#_note-102" title="">[103]</a></sup></p>
<p>Hilda Bates wrote in June 1945: "I am horrified at the increased number of graves in the burial ground. Deaths are now so frequent, that a party of grave diggers is now permanently employed, and given extra rations in order that they will have the strength to dig".<sup id="_ref-103" class="reference"><a href="#_note-103" title="">[104]</a></sup></p>
<p>After liberation, the bodies were exhumed from the cemetery and sent to Labuan for reburial in a central military cemetery there. A large number of the graves of prisoners from Batu Lintang now at Labuan are unidentified: after the Japanese surrender Suga destroyed many camp records. The cemetery in Labuan is cared for by the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commonwealth_War_Graves_Commission_b12f.html" title="Commonwealth War Graves Commission">Commonwealth War Graves Commission</a>.</p>

Leonard Beckett with the radio, (the "Old Lady") and the generator ("Ginnie")</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>It was known that <a href="../../../o/v/e/Overseas_Chinese_da26.html" title="Overseas Chinese">ethnic Chinese</a> people in Sarawak were pro-Allied, and so contact was made with the Ongs, the leading Chinese family in Kuching, who lived about a mile from the camp, to see if they could assist in providing parts.<sup id="_ref-108" class="reference"><a href="#_note-108" title="">[109]</a></sup> The first night-time attempt, by G. W. Pringle, was a failure as he could not find his way through the dense jungle to the house. A reconnoitre mission was required. To achieve this, Russell suggested to Dr Yamamoto that as the area was a breeding ground for mosquitoes (with the resultant risk of malaria, which would affect Japanese and prisoner alike), the jungle should be cleared and sprayed. Pringle took part on this working party and was able to plot his route. He subsequently made contact and Ong Tiang Swee, Kapitan China of Sarawak and the patriarch of the Ong family, agreed to help. Ong instructed his grandson, Kee Hui to help Pringle obtain the needed parts.<sup id="_ref-109" class="reference"><a href="#_note-109" title="">[110]</a></sup> This was at massive risk to their own safety as they too would have been executed if discovered. Their only condition was that they should be provided with the news gathered from the radio, in order to boost the morale of the Chinese community under occupation in Kuching. They provided some radio parts, the acquisition of which must have been a considerable task as all radio equipment had been confiscated by the Japanese.<sup id="_ref-110" class="reference"><a href="#_note-110" title="">[111]</a></sup></p>
<p>The radio was built and operated in the British other ranks' camp. The maker of the radio was Warrant Officer Leonard A. T. Beckett, an experienced radio engineer, who was assisted in its construction, operation and concealment by a core group of three other soldiers. Before Beckett could begin on the radio he first had to make some of the tools needed, such as a lathe and a soldering iron. In addition to the genuine radio parts provided by the Chinese family and a few parts brought along with the men from Tanjung Priok, the radio was constructed from items as diverse as a deaf aid, the steering damper of a <a href="../../../n/o/r/Norton_%28motorcycle%29.html" title="Norton (motorcycle)">Norton</a> motorcycle, a bakelite shaving soap container, an army mess tin, the backing of an old map case, pieces of glass, wire, mica and barbed wire, and parts stolen from Japanese-owned motor cars and motorcycles. The receiver was completed within three to four weeks of starting.<sup id="_ref-111" class="reference"><a href="#_note-111" title="">[112]</a></sup></p>
<p>During its construction the radio was concealed in a large stewing-pot; once completed its hiding place was in a biscuit tin buried under the bakehouse fire in the British other ranks' compound.<sup id="_ref-112" class="reference"><a href="#_note-112" title="">[113]</a></sup> It was operated in the stores, where it had a temporary hiding place in a false-bottomed table.<sup id="_ref-113" class="reference"><a href="#_note-113" title="">[114]</a></sup> Elaborate security proceedings to protect the radio were put in place, including a network of look-outs.<sup id="_ref-114" class="reference"><a href="#_note-114" title="">[115]</a></sup></p>
<p>At first the radio ran off torch batteries: these soon ran out and so Beckett constructed a power unit to run off the camp electricity supply.<sup id="_ref-115" class="reference"><a href="#_note-115" title="">[116]</a></sup> Access to the camp powerhouse was gained by one of the POWs who had been a professional <a href="../../../c/a/t/Cat_burglar.html" title="Cat burglar">cat burglar</a> before the war.<sup id="_ref-116" class="reference"><a href="#_note-116" title="">[117]</a></sup></p>
<p>The radio was first used on the night of <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_24.html" title="February 24">24 February</a> <a href="../../../1/9/4/1943.html" title="1943">1943</a>, as radio reception was better in the evening. Some of the news was bewildering to the prisoners: "Who is this <a href="../../../b/e/r/Bernard_Montgomery_2915.html" title="Bernard Montgomery">General Montgomery</a>? He seems to be the man we ought to have had in charge from the very beginning. A real live wire", wrote Pringle.<sup id="_ref-117" class="reference"><a href="#_note-117" title="">[118]</a></sup></p>
<p>The existence of the radio, referred to by many code-names but chiefly as the "Old Lady" and "Mrs Harris",<sup id="_ref-118" class="reference"><a href="#_note-118" title="">[119]</a></sup> was to be a closely-guarded secret, for fear of alerting the Japanese to its existence through loose talk. The commanding officers of the camp and those who had constructed and operated it were known as the "Board of Directors", and were the only ones who knew the precise contents of the radio news received.<sup id="_ref-119" class="reference"><a href="#_note-119" title="">[120]</a></sup> However, a way of disseminating information was organised: it was arranged for rumours to be spread which contained a considerable amount of truth.<sup id="_ref-120" class="reference"><a href="#_note-120" title="">[121]</a></sup> Le Gros Clark, the head of the male internees, directed the dissemination of news amongst the male internees;<sup id="_ref-121" class="reference"><a href="#_note-121" title="">[122]</a></sup> it was decided not to provide information to the women's camp. News was also passed to the Chinese once a week, carried through the jungle by Pringle. On the first exchange, without being asked the Chinese thoughtfully provided medical supplies; thereafter they provided much-needed medicines, money and vegetable seeds on a regular basis.<sup id="_ref-122" class="reference"><a href="#_note-122" title="">[123]</a></sup> The leaked news rumours had the desired effect and a more cheerful atmosphere was noted in the camp.<sup id="_ref-123" class="reference"><a href="#_note-123" title="">[124]</a></sup> The women's camp somehow learned of the existence of the radio and the camp mistress, Dorie Adams, asked that they should be provided with news; to counter worries about security she suggested that the Roman Catholic priest who celebrated mass with the R.C. nuns should deliver the news as part of his service, which was always given in Latin.<sup id="_ref-124" class="reference"><a href="#_note-124" title="">[125]</a></sup></p>
<p>In early March 1943, the provision of electric power for the lighting in the internees' camps was halted.<sup id="_ref-125" class="reference"><a href="#_note-125" title="">[126]</a></sup> This was a serious blow as the radio was run off the power supply. Batteries were unavailable, and so the only solution, again the idea of Russell, was to construct a generator. Again, his idea met with some initial scepticism: "Now I know he has gone mad", wrote Pringle.<sup id="_ref-126" class="reference"><a href="#_note-126" title="">[127]</a></sup> However, Pringleâs colleagues were more enthusiastic. Beckett was sure he could build the generator, and British <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Army_Ordnance_Corps_9245.html" title="Royal Army Ordnance Corps">RAOC</a> personnel were certain they could supply the necessary components, though they thought it would take three months to make the tools needed.<sup id="_ref-127" class="reference"><a href="#_note-127" title="">[128]</a></sup> To disguise the noise of the work, the enterprise was described as a "watch repairing factory" to the Japanese, who offered the use of various tools and other equipment.<sup id="_ref-128" class="reference"><a href="#_note-128" title="">[129]</a></sup> In March 1943, after the execution of some prisoners at the Sandakan POW camp for operating a radio, the Japanese stepped up their searches at Batu Lintang.<sup id="_ref-129" class="reference"><a href="#_note-129" title="">[130]</a></sup> Many essential items for the construction of the generator, such as magnets, wire and scrap iron, were not easily available, but the involvement of "Freddie", one of the prisoners who was a self-confessed thief (and most likely the same man who sorted the power supply: records are unclear) meant that material and equipment was soon obtained.<sup id="_ref-130" class="reference"><a href="#_note-130" title="">[131]</a></sup></p>

<p>The generator needed to turn at 3,000 revolutions a minute, and so the fittest of the men involved in its construction was chosen to turn the wheel. He was given extra food rations to prepare him for the task.<sup id="_ref-131" class="reference"><a href="#_note-131" title="">[132]</a></sup> The first trial of the generator was a success, and again, Pringle recorded how news reports told of unknown figures: "Events appeared to have been moving with unseemly haste during our enforced breaks from the news broadcasts. [We] listened to names we had never heard of. <a href="../../../d/w/i/Dwight_D._Eisenhower_449c.html" title="Dwight D. Eisenhower">General Eisenhower</a>? <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joseph_Stilwell_ca58.html" title="Joseph Stilwell">General Stilwell</a>?" The assembling and disassembling drill took less than thirty seconds, with both the "Old Lady" and "Ginnie" stowed in their hiding places in the hut which was occupied by cookhouse staff during the day.</p>
<p>In June 1944, Le Gros Clark was taken from the camp by the <i>kempeitai</i> for questioning. On his return the same day he was considerably shaken and recommended that the radio should be destroyed. This message was relayed to the camp master of the British other ranks' camp by Whimster, who was the senior British officer. Beckett and his colleagues were informed of this order, but were left to decide themselves what course of action to take. Realising its importance in keeping up camp morale, they decided to keep the radio, saying that "we might as well be hung for a sheep as a lamb", according to Pepler.<sup id="_ref-132" class="reference"><a href="#_note-132" title="">[133]</a></sup> Steps to safeguard the civilian internees were undertaken by cutting off news to their camps.<sup id="_ref-133" class="reference"><a href="#_note-133" title="">[134]</a></sup></p>
<p>That same month the prisoners received news of the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Normandy_a39c.html" title="Battle of Normandy">invasion of Normandy</a>. Pringle recorded how, once again, the news brought unfamiliar names to the prisoners' attention: "'Blood and Guts <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_S._Patton_9651.html" title="George S. Patton">Patton</a>.' Now there is a name for a General! ... Somehow though, we feel that with a General bearing the name of 'Blood and Guts' there is little danger of the Germans dislodging his army".<sup id="_ref-134" class="reference"><a href="#_note-134" title="">[135]</a></sup> It was clear that such important news would have a great effect in the camp; at the same time, the rejoicing it would bring would undoubtedly alert the Japanese. It was therefore decided to provide a hint to the other prisoners, rather than the full information. This was again delivered by a priest, this time by the <a href="../../../p/a/d/Padre.html" title="Padre">padre</a> officiating at one of the numerous funeral services. He quoted <a href="../../../e/x/o/Exodus.html" title="Exodus">Exodus</a> chapter 15, verses 9 and 10, which refer to pursuing, overtaking and destroying the enemy, and the sea. News of the bombing of London by <a href="../../../v/-/2/V-2.html" title="V-2">V-2</a> rockets was understandably withheld.<sup id="_ref-135" class="reference"><a href="#_note-135" title="">[136]</a></sup></p>
<p>The news of the <a href="../../../v/-/e/V-E_Day_07b6.html" title="V-E Day">German capitulation</a> on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_7.html" title="May 7">7 May</a> <a href="../../../1/9/4/1945.html" title="1945">1945</a> was similarly cryptically relayed at a funeral by the padre. This time the verse was <a href="../../../b/o/o/Book_of_Exodus_bed1.html" title="Book of Exodus">Exodus</a> chapter 3, verse 8, concerning the deliverance of the Israelites from the Egyptians to the land of milk and honey; extra piquancy was added by the fact that Suga was present at this service.<sup id="_ref-136" class="reference"><a href="#_note-136" title="">[137]</a></sup></p>

Since it was known that in many areas prisoners and internees were suffering from starvation and neglect, it was of the first importance that they were contacted and recovered as soon as possible.<sup id="_ref-147" class="reference"><a href="#_note-147" title="">[148]</a></sup></p>
<p>Despite the surrender, the Japanese would remain in control of the camp until <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_11.html" title="September 11">11 September</a>.

<p>After communicating with the Japanese staff at Kuching, Colonel A. G.

<p>Immediately prior to the surrender of Japan, rumours abounded in the camp that the Japanese intended to execute all the prisoners rather than allow them to be freed by the approaching Allied forces;<sup id="_ref-163" class="reference"><a href="#_note-163" title="">[164]</a></sup> when Dr Yamamoto informed some prisoners that they were to be moved to a new camp they naturally feared the worst, especially when he promised the unlikely idyll of a camp "equipped with the best medical equipment obtainable ... there would be no working parties and food would be plentiful ... the sick men would be especially well cared for".<sup id="_ref-164" class="reference"><a href="#_note-164" title="">[165]</a></sup></p>

The prisoners and internees had been forewarned that there would be no delay in taking the surrender, and quickly gathered at 5pm in the main square of the camp to witness Eastick accept the sword of Suga.<sup id="_ref-171" class="reference"><a href="#_note-171" title="">[172]</a></sup> The Japanese finally learned of the existence of the radio in a dramatic fashion:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The Australian Commander, Major General [sic] Eastick ... mounted the rostrum and after accepting the sword of surrender from Suga was about to dismiss him when a shout, rising simultaneously from the throats of the Board of Directors of the 'Old Lady' and 'Ginnie' stopped the proceedings. 'Hold on, we have something to show you.' Carrying the radio and generator Len [Beckett] proudly showed them to the General and turning to Suga, asked, 'Well, what do you think about it Suga?' Now I know the full meaning of the saying 'If looks could kill.' Len would have died a horrible death".<sup id="_ref-172" class="reference"><a href="#_note-172" title="">[173]</a></sup></p>

<p>The following day Suga, together with Captain Negata and Dr Yamamoto, were flown to the Australian base on Labuan, to await their trials as <a href="../../../w/a/r/War_criminals.html" title="War criminals">war criminals</a>. Suga committed suicide there on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_16.html" title="September 16">16 September</a>.

<p>Photographers and cameramen accompanied the liberating force, and the events, and those of the following days, were well-documented.<sup id="_ref-174" class="reference"><a href="#_note-174" title="">[175]</a></sup> On liberation, the camp contained 2,024 inmates: 1,392 prisoners (including 882 British, 178 Australian and 45 Indian); and 632 internees.<sup id="_ref-175" class="reference"><a href="#_note-175" title="">[176]</a></sup> The most ill prisoners were taken to Kuching Civil Hospital, which had been entirely refitted by the Australians since serving as the Japanese military hospital.<sup id="_ref-176" class="reference"><a href="#_note-176" title="">[177]</a></sup></p>
