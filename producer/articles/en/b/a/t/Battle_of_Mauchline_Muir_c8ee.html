<p>In the course of 1647 Hamilton and much of the Scottish nobility grew concerned for the fate of the king, a prisoner since the end of the <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_English_Civil_War_84bf.html" title="First English Civil War">First Civil War</a> and increasingly under the control of the radicals in the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Model_Army_f4c0.html" title="New Model Army">New Model Army</a>. A new government was formed, taking the place of the more radical Presbyterian party, headed by the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marquess_of_Argyll_87a7.html" title="Marquess of Argyll">Marquess of Argyll</a>, committed to the letter of the <a href="../../../c/o/v/Covenanter.html" title="Covenanter">Covenants</a> of 1638 and 1643.</p>
<p>Hamilton had one major task before him, with two distinct elements, which proved impossible to reconcile: to reach an agreement with the king that would safisfy Argyll and the Kirk radicals. In December 1647 the Scottish government concluded a secret agreement with Charles-now a prisoner in <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carisbrooke_Castle_8575.html" title="Carisbrooke Castle">Carisbrooke Castle</a> on the <a href="../../../i/s/l/Isle_of_Wight_ca39.html" title="Isle of Wight">Isle of Wight</a>-known as the <a href="../../../e/n/g/Engagement.html" title="Engagement">Engagement</a>. By this Charles promised to establish Presbyterianism in England on a three year trail basis-though he would not subscribe to the Covenant in person-in return for the aid of a Scots army. It was far less than the Scottish commissioners had hoped for, but it was as much as the king was prepared to give. Trouble was expected; and it was not long in coming.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Mauchline_Muir_c8ee.html" title="Edit section: The Curse of God">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Curse of God</span></h2>
<p>For Hamilton and his party the Engagement was a major gamble. Unlike the <a href="../../../s/o/l/Solemn_League_and_Covenant_c9ac.html" title="Solemn League and Covenant">Solemn League and Covenant</a> it had neither been approved by the Scottish Parliament nor the General Assembly of the Church. In a sense it was an attempt by the aristocracy as a whole to regain control of Scottish politics, which they had been steadily losing since 1643. Much depended on the success in getting the other estates, especially the clergy, to accept a treaty which fell well short of the Covenanting ideal.</p>
<p>Even before parliament met in March 1648 opposition to the Engagement was growing in intensity. The Commission of the Kirk, the permanent ececutive of the General Assembly, openly declared that the king's concessions on religion were destructive to the Covenant. It was openly denounced from the pulpit throughout the parishes of Scotland, one minister going so far as to predict that Hamilton would bring the curse of God down upon himself and all of his posterity. Soon opposition at the local level was having a serious effect on Hamilton's recruitment drive. This was especially true in the south-west of Scotland, in <a href="../../../a/y/r/Ayrshire.html" title="Ayrshire">Ayrshire</a>, <a href="../../../l/a/n/Lanarkshire.html" title="Lanarkshire">Lanarkshire</a> and <a href="../../../g/a/l/Galloway.html" title="Galloway">Galloway</a>, fast emerging as the heartlands of the Covenant. The delay in raising an army meant that English royalist forces, already rising in the <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_English_Civil_War_178b.html" title="Second English Civil War">Second Civil War</a> were isolated and unsupported.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Mauchline_Muir_c8ee.html" title="Edit section: Troopers and Preachers">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Troopers and Preachers</span></h2>
<p>The government was forced to take severe measures to end resistance to the draft. James Turner, a professional soldier, was sent to <a href="../../../g/l/a/Glasgow.html" title="Glasgow">Glasgow</a> with an infantry regiment to force the magistrates to co-operate. His technique was simple but effective;</p>
<p><i>...I found my worke not very difficill; for I shortlie learnd to know that the quartering tuo or three troopers and halfe a dozen musketeers was ane argument strong enough, in tuo or three nights time, to make the hardest headed Covenanter in the toune to forsake the Kirk and side with Parliament.</i></p>
<p>Many gave in when faced with the expense and inconvenience of keeping soldiers. News of this novel technique spread to the nearby communities; so when Turner moved on to <a href="../../../p/a/i/Paisley.html" title="Paisley">Paisley</a> the magistrates were quick to submit. Hamilton, in the meantime, was forcibly raising men in Lanarkshire, while the Earl of Callendar moved west to support him. Hundreds of men, many of them mounted and armed, fled over the county boundary into Ayrshire, where opposition to the Engagement was particularly acute.</p>
<p>By early June some 2000 or 3000 militant Covenanters had gathered at Loudoun Hill. But what they possessed in will they lacked in leadership. Appeals were sent both to the <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earl_of_Eglinton_cd00.html" title="Earl of Eglinton">Earl of Eglinton</a> and General <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Leslie_%28Scottish_general%29_0b51.html" title="David Leslie (Scottish general)">David Leslie</a>, known supporters of Argyll, to come and join them. Both men prudently ignored the invitation. Disappointed by this failure the gathering began to break up. Enough of them remained together, including the refugees from Lanarkshire, to attend the Lord's Supper at Mauchline on Sunday 11 June. With many people arriving from nearby parishes, the preaching and praying continued in to the following day.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Mauchline_Muir_c8ee.html" title="Edit section: Mauchline Muir">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Mauchline Muir</span></h2>
<p>While at Paisley Turner learned that there was a dangerous gathering in Ayrshire, although he had no information on its exact location. A report was immediately sent to Hamilton, who ordered Callendar and General John Middleton to join him. On 12 June both men met at <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stewarton.html" title="Stewarton">Stewarton</a>, mustering a total force of 1600 cavalry and 2000 foot. By now Callendar knew that the Covenanters were at Mauchline. One regiment was sent on to <a href="../../../i/r/v/Irvine%2C_Ayrshire_d06d.html" title="Irvine, Ayrshire">Irvine</a>, while Turner and Middleton advanced with six troops of horse to confront the rebels. Callendar followed on with the remainder of the force, intending to rest at Kilmarnock. However, he now received further reports that the militants-originally estimated at 600 men-were some 2000 strong, including 1200 horsemen. At once he sent on reinforcements to join his forward units.</p>
<p>Middleton now faced the Covenanters, drawn up on Mauchline Muir, with 600 troopers, including Callendar's reinforcements. After failing to get the rebels to disperse he ordered part of his force forward. These men were immediately repelled, after which the rest of army was ordered to attack. Callendar, who clearly misjudged the seriousness of the situation, arrived just in time to prevent Middleton being overwhelmed by force of numbers. Faced with these additional troops the rebels broke and fled. Few men were killed on either side, but a large number were wounded, including Middleton and <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Hurry_d9e1.html" title="John Hurry">John Hurry</a>. There was no pursuit, and many of the insurgents escaped into Galloway, another Covenanter stronghold.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Mauchline_Muir_c8ee.html" title="Edit section: The Whiggamore Raid">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Whiggamore Raid</span></h2>
<p>This small encounter hardly justifies the grand title of the Battle of Mauchline Muir; but it had important repercussions. Hamilton and the rest of the Engager government were worried that the country was on the brink of civil war. An attempt to subdue the west would have meant further delays in the proposed invasion of England. Believing that success in England would be a more effective answer to discontent in the west than direct confrontation, the government decided not to force the issue. Far fewer forces were therefore raised in the south-west than was estimated. For the Covenanters, dispersed but not destroyed, Mauchline Muir was unfinished business. Secure in their strongholds, they watched and waited. The Reverend Robert Baillie, a leading minister and a political moderate, saw the danger;</p>
<p><i>There is indeed in our people a great animositie put in them, both by our preaching and discourse; also by the extream great oppression of the sojours; so it fears me...so soon as our army shall be intangled with the English many of our people will rise on their backs.</i></p>
<p>Later that summer Baillie's prediction came true. No sooner had news that Hamilton and his army had crashed to disaster at <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Preston_%281648%29_93cb.html" title="Battle of Preston (1648)">Preston</a>, than the western shires began to stir. This time there was no lack of leadership. The earls of Eglinton, <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earl_of_Loudoun_63d4.html" title="Earl of Loudoun">Loudon</a>, <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earl_of_Leven_ed9d.html" title="Earl of Leven">Leven</a> and David Leslie, placed themselves at the head of several thousand men on a march on <a href="../../../e/d/i/Edinburgh.html" title="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a> to overthrow what was left of the Engager government. The country people on the march used the word 'whiggam' to urge on their horses, a term which was picked up and later used to describe this march as the Whiggamore Raid. The <a href="../../../k/i/r/Kirk_Party_07b6.html" title="Kirk Party">Whigs</a>, with all their uncompromising purity, were set to enter the stage of Scottish and British history.</p>
