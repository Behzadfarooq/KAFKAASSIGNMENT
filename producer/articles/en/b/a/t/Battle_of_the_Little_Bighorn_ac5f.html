<p>Thousands of Indians had slipped away from their <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indian_reservation.html" title="Indian reservation">reservations</a> through early 1876. Military officials planned a three-pronged expedition to corral them and force them back to the reservations, using both <a href="../../../i/n/f/Infantry.html" title="Infantry">infantry</a> and cavalry, as well as small detachments of <a href="../../../a/r/t/Artillery.html" title="Artillery">artillery</a>, including <a href="../../../g/a/t/Gatling_gun.html" title="Gatling gun">Gatling guns</a>. <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brigadier_General_8b0d.html" title="Brigadier General">Brig.

The third column under Brig. Gen. <a href="../../../a/l/f/Alfred_Terry_8f0e.html" title="Alfred Terry">Alfred Terry</a> (including George Custer's 7th Cavalry; Companies B, D and I, <a href="../../../6/t/h/6th_U.S._Infantry_15f1.html" title="6th U.S. Infantry">6th U.S. Infantry</a>; Companies C &amp; G, 17th U.S. Infantry; and the Gatling gun detachment of the 20th Infantry) departed westward from <a href="../../../f/o/r/Fort_Abraham_Lincoln_8f47.html" title="Fort Abraham Lincoln">Fort Abraham Lincoln</a> in the <a href="../../../d/a/k/Dakota_Territory_efcc.html" title="Dakota Territory">Dakota Territory</a>. They were accompanied by teamsters and packers with 150 wagons and a large contingent of pack mules.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>The coordination and planning went awry on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_17.html" title="June 17">June 17</a> when Crook's column was delayed after the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_the_Rosebud_2814.html" title="Battle of the Rosebud">Battle of the Rosebud</a> and was forced to stop and regroup. Gibbon and Terry proceeded, joining forces in late June near the mouth of the Rosebud River. They formulated a plan that called for Custer's regiment to proceed up the Rosebud River, while Terry and Gibbon's united columns would proceed up the <a href="../../../b/i/g/Bighorn_River_caea.html" title="Bighorn River">Bighorn</a> and Little Bighorn rivers. The officers hoped to trap the Indian village between these two forces. After discovering a large Indian trail on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_15.html" title="June 15">June 15</a>, the 7th Cavalry split from the remainder of the Terry column on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_22.html" title="June 22">June 22</a> and began a pursuit along the trail. Custer was offered the use of the Gatling guns but declined, saying they would slow his command.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup>. He also declined the offer of two further companies of cavalry on the basis that his regiment could handle anything they found without other assistance. Custer's scouts arrived at an overlook 14 miles (23 km) east of the Little Bighorn River on the night of <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_24.html" title="June 24">June 24</a>, as the Terry/Gibbon column was marching toward the mouth of the Little Bighorn. Custer disregarded consistent warnings from his scouts that one of the largest encampments of Indians in Plains history awaited him somewhere along the river.</p>

<p>The 7th Cavalry was a veteran organization created just after the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Civil_War_90af.html" title="American Civil War">American Civil War</a>. Several men were veterans of the war, including many of the leading officers. A significant portion of the regiment had previously served four-and-a-half years at <a href="../../../f/t/2E/Ft._Riley_7b37.html" title="Ft. Riley">Ft. Riley</a>, <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kansas.html" title="Kansas">Kansas</a>, during which time it fought one major engagement and numerous skirmishes, experiencing casualties of thirty-six killed and twenty-seven wounded. Six other troopers had died of drowning and fifty-one from <a href="../../../c/h/o/Cholera.html" title="Cholera">cholera</a> epidemics.</p>
<p>Half of the 7th Cavalry had just returned from eighteen months of constabulary duty in the <a href="../../../d/e/e/Deep_South_fdf7.html" title="Deep South">deep South</a>, having been recalled to Fort Abraham Lincoln to reassemble the regiment for the campaign. Approximately 20% of the troopers had been enlisted in the prior seven months (139 of an enlisted roll of 718), were only marginally trained, and had no combat or frontier experience. A sizable number of these recruits were immigrants from <a href="../../../i/r/e/Ireland.html" title="Ireland">Ireland</a>, <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a>, and <a href="../../../p/r/u/Prussia.html" title="Prussia">Prussia</a>, just as many of the veteran troopers had been prior to their enlistments.</p>
<p>Of the 44 officers and 718 troopers then assigned to the 7th Cavalry (including a second lieutenant detached from the 20th Infantry and serving in L Troop), 13 officers (including the regimental commander, Col. <a href="../../../s/a/m/Samuel_D._Sturgis_b136.html" title="Samuel D. Sturgis">Samuel D. Sturgis</a>, who was on detached duty) and 152 troopers did not accompany the 7th during the campaign. Among those left behind at Fort Abraham Lincoln was the regimental band.</p>
<p>Following a night forced march on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_24.html" title="June 24">June 24</a>–<a href="../../../j/u/n/June_25.html" title="June 25">June 25</a>, in which <a href="../../../c/r/o/Crow_Tribe_233b.html" title="Crow Tribe">Crow Indian</a> scouts reported to Custer the presence of what was judged a very large encampment of Indians, Custer divided the 7th Cavalry into four detachments.</p>
<p>The largest detachment consisted of Troops C, E, F, I, and L, personally led by Custer. It numbered 13 officers, 198 men (7 of whom would eventually be detached before the "last stand") and 3 civilians—a <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mark_Kellogg_%28reporter%29_38f4.html" title="Mark Kellogg (reporter)">newspaper reporter</a>, and 2 scouts. Two of Custer's relatives later joined the column. Troop C was commanded by Custer's brother, <a href="../../../c/a/p/Captain.html" title="Captain">Capt.</a> <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Custer_3b18.html" title="Thomas Custer">Thomas Custer</a>, and L Company by his brother-in-law, <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_Lieutenant_57be.html" title="First Lieutenant">1st Lt.</a> <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Calhoun_7079.html" title="James Calhoun">James Calhoun</a>. This detachment marched along a ridge line on the east bank of the Little Bighorn in an attempt to enter the encampment from the north.</p>
<p>A second detachment, led by <a href="../../../m/a/j/Major.html" title="Major">Maj.</a> <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marcus_Reno_4a86.html" title="Marcus Reno">Marcus Reno</a>, was sent into the Little Bighorn valley to provoke an engagement. This detachment consisted of Troops A, G, and M, and numbered 11 officers, 131 troopers, and most of the approximately 35 Sioux, <a href="../../../r/e/e/Ree.html" title="Ree">Ree</a>/<a href="../../../a/r/i/Arikara.html" title="Arikara">Arikara</a> and Crow scouts.</p>
<p>A third detachment was led by a company commander, Capt. <a href="../../../f/r/e/Frederick_Benteen_ee29.html" title="Frederick Benteen">Frederick Benteen</a>, and was made up of Troops D, H, and K, with 5 officers and 110 men. Its mission is controversial, with some analysts arguing it was simply to scout nearby valleys whilst others believe he was intended to find and enter the Little Big Horn Valley and sweep up towards the village. He was ordered to attack any body of Indians he encountered despite being out of supporting distance from the rest of the command. <sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>The last group was the regimental pack train, consisting of 7 or 8 troopers from each company and escorted by Troop B. Commanded by Capt. Thomas McDougall, this sizable force had 2 officers, 127 troopers, and 7 civilian packers.</p>
<p>Each of the first three detachments was to seek out the Indian encampments, attack them, and hold them in place until the other two detachments arrived to support. Custer had employed similar tactics in 1868 during the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_the_Washita_39ed.html" title="Battle of the Washita">Battle of the Washita</a>.</p>

Cooke">William W. Cooke</a>. The orders, made without accurate knowledge of the village's size, location, or propensity to stand and fight, were to pursue the Indians and "bring them to battle". However, Custer did promise to "support...[Reno] with the whole outfit". Reno's force crossed the Little Bighorn at the mouth of what is today called Reno Creek and immediately realized that the Lakota and Northern Cheyenne were present "in force and ...not running away".</p>
<p>Sending a message to Custer, but hearing nothing in return, Reno advanced rapidly northward, stating that he drove the enemy "with ease". However, he suspected "a trap" and stopped a few hundred yards short of the encampment, dismounting and deploying in a <a href="../../../s/k/i/Skirmish_line.html" title="Skirmish line">skirmish line</a>, as standard army doctrine called for. In deploying in a skirmish line, every fifth trooper handled the horses for four troopers taking firing positions, thus immediately reducing the fighting force by 20%. The troopers on the skirmish line were positioned five to ten yards apart, with officers just to their rear and the troopers with horses behind the officers. After about 20 minutes of long distance firing he had taken only one casualty but the odds against him had become more obvious (Reno estimated five to one) and Custer had not reinforced him. Reno ordered a withdrawal into nearby woods in a loop of the river, then made a disorderly retreat across the river to reach the high ground of the bluffs on the other side. The retreat was confused and immediately disrupted by Cheyenne attacks at close quarters. Reno later reported that 3 officers and 29 troopers were killed during the retreat and the subsequent <a href="../../../f/o/r/Ford_%28river%29.html" title="Ford (river)">fording</a> of the river and another officer and 13-18 men missing, left behind in the woods, although most of these men eventually rejoined the detachment.</p>

The battlefield today.</div>

</div>
<p>Atop the bluffs, Reno's shaken troops soon linked up with the detachment of Captain Benteen, arriving from the south. This force had been on its lateral scouting mission when it had been summoned by a messenger from Custer to "Come on...big village, be quick...bring pacs...". (This messenger was <a href="http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GRid=2945" class="external text" title="http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GRid=2945" rel="nofollow">John Martin</a>, a trumpeter, who was the last white person to see Custer alive and survive the battle.) Benteen's coincidental arrival on the bluffs was just in time to save Reno's men from possible annihilation. Their detachments were then reinforced by McDougall and the pack train. The 14 officers and 340 troopers on the bluffs organized an all-around defense and dug <a href="../../../d/e/f/Defensive_fighting_position.html" title="Defensive fighting position">rifle pits</a>.</p>
<p>Despite hearing heavy gunfire from the north, Benteen concentrated on reinforcing Reno's badly wounded battalion, rather than continuing on toward Custer. Benteen and Reno also had a documented conversation noting the similarity between Custer's current strategy and the one he had used years earlier at the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_the_Washita_39ed.html" title="Battle of the Washita">Battle of the Washita</a>. There, when his position looked threatened, Custer had retreated instead of supporting one of his sub-commanders, Maj. Joel Elliot, and act which resulted in the complete annihilation of Elliot's unit. Benteen wondered if history had just repeated itself and Custer had abandoned them to possible annihilation. Benteen was heard to say "I wonder if this is to be another Maj. Elliot affair?"<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>After an hour, nearing five o'clock and the end of the Custer fight, Capt. Thomas Weir and Company D moved out against orders to make contact with Custer. They advanced a mile and could see Lakota shooting in the distance, but were under considerable pressure themselves. The other companies eventually followed by assigned battalions, first Benteen, then Reno, and finally the pack train, but growing Lakota attacks forced all seven companies to return to the bluff before the pack train, with the ammunition, had moved even a quarter mile. Benteen's apparent reluctance prompted later criticism that he had failed to follow orders.</p>

<p>The gunfire heard on the bluffs was from Custer's fight. His force of 208 was engaged by the Lakota and Northern Cheyenne approximately 3.5 miles (6 km) to the north. Having driven Reno's force away from the encampment and isolated it, many warriors were free to pursue Custer. The route taken by Custer to his "Last Stand" remains a subject of debate. It does seem clear that after ordering Reno to charge, Custer continued down Reno Creek to within about a half mile (800 m) of the Little Bighorn, but then turned north, and climbed up the bluffs, reaching the same spot to which Reno would soon retreat. From this point, he could see Reno, on the other side of the river, charging the village.</p>

<p>Custer then rode north along the bluffs, and descended into a drainage called Medicine Tail Coulee, which led to the river. Some historians believe that part of Custer's force descended the <a href="../../../c/o/u/Coulee.html" title="Coulee">coulee</a>, going west to the river and attempting unsuccessfully to cross into the village. Other authorities believe that Custer never approached the river, but rather continued north across the coulee and up the other side, where he gradually came under attack. According to this theory, by the time Custer realized he was badly outnumbered by the Indians who came from the Reno fight, it was too late to break back through to the south, where Reno and Benteen could have provided reinforcement.</p>
<p>Within roughly three hours, Custer's force was completely annihilated. Only two men from the 7th Cavalry later claimed to have seen Custer engage the Indians—a young Crow whose name translated as <a href="../../../c/u/r/Curley.html" title="Curley">Curley</a>, and a trooper named <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Thompson_%28soldier%29_c29d.html" title="Peter Thompson (soldier)">Peter Thompson</a>, who had fallen behind Custer's column, and most accounts of the last moments of Custer's forces are conjecture.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup> Lakota accounts assert that Crazy Horse personally led one of the large groups of Lakota who overwhelmed the cavalrymen.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[6]</a></sup> While exact numbers are difficult to determine, it is commonly estimated that the Northern Cheyenne and Lakota outnumbered the 7th Cavalry by approximately 3:1, a ratio which was extended to 5:1 during the fragmented parts of the battle. In addition, some of the Indians were armed with repeating <a href="../../../s/p/e/Spencer_repeating_rifle.html" title="Spencer repeating rifle">Spencer</a> and <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winchester_rifles.html" title="Winchester rifles">Winchester</a> rifles, while the 7th Cavalry carried single-shot <a href="../../../s/p/r/Springfield_Model_1873_521a.html" title="Springfield Model 1873">Springfield</a> carbines, which had a slow rate of fire, tended to jam when overheated, and were impossible to reload on horseback. The opposing warriors carried a large variety of weapons, from bows and arrows to <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_rifle.html" title="Henry rifle">Henry rifles</a>.</p>
<p>The terrain of the battlefield gave Lakota and Cheyenne bows an advantage, since Custer's troops were pinned in a depression on higher ground from which they could not use <a href="../../../d/i/r/Direct_fire.html" title="Direct fire">direct fire</a> at the Indians in <a href="../../../d/e/f/Defilade.html" title="Defilade">defilade</a>. On the other hand, the Lakota and Cheyenne were able to shoot their arrows into the depression by launching them on a high arching <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indirect_fire.html" title="Indirect fire">indirect fire</a>, with the volume of arrows ensuring severe casualties. U.S. <a href="../../../s/m/a/Small_arms.html" title="Small arms">small arms</a> might have been more accurate over open distances, but the fighting on this occasion was <a href="../../../c/l/o/Close_combat.html" title="Close combat">close combat</a> where rate of fire and reliability of a weapon were more important attributes.</p>
<p>Recent archaeological work at the battlefield site indicates that Custer initially deployed his troops in skirmish lines per Army doctrine. This deployment would have resulted in only approximately 150 troopers providing defensive fire over several long skirmish lines. As individual troopers were killed, wounded or their carbines jammed, the skirmish lines became untenable.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[7]</a></sup> <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_History_Channel_d430.html" title="The History Channel">The History Channel</a> series <i>Battlefield Detectives</i> suggested in 2003 that there may not have been a 'last stand' as it has come down to us through history. Instead, archaeologists suggested that Custer's troops weren't surrounded and picked off but rather simply swamped by a single charge.</p>
<p>While many of Custer's troops were recruits who did not possess an adequate level of military training and skill, archaeological evidence also suggests that they were undernourished, in poor physical condition, and had been on forced march nearly 24 hours without sleep at the commencement of the engagement.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>

<p>After the Custer force was annihilated, the Lakota and Northern Cheyenne regrouped to attack Reno and Benteen. The fight continued until dark (approximately 9:00 p.m. by local timekeeping) and for much of the next day, with the outcome in doubt. Reno credited Benteen's leadership with repulsing a severe attack on the portion of the perimeter held by Companies H and M.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[9]</a></sup> On <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_26.html" title="June 26">June 26</a> the column under Terry approached from the north, and the Indians drew off in the opposite direction. The wounded were given what treatment was available at that time; five later died of their wounds.

</div>
<p>An examination was made of the Custer battle site. The Indian dead had mostly been removed from the field. The 7th's dead were identified as best as possible and hastily buried where they fell. Custer was found to have been shot in the left temple and in the left chest; either wound would have been fatal. He also suffered a wound to the arm. Some Lakota oral histories assert that Custer committed suicide to avoid capture and subsequent torture or death—as Custer believed—but he was right-handed. His body was found near the top of "Last Stand Hill" where a large obelisk inscribed with the names of the 7th's dead now stands. Most of the dead had been stripped of their clothing, mutilated, and were in an advanced state of deterioration, such that identification of many of the bodies was impossible.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p>From the evidence, it was impossible to determine what exactly had transpired, but there was evidence of prolonged organized resistance (according to Indian and federal testimonies <sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[11]</a></sup> ). Several days after the battle, the young Crow scout <a href="../../../c/u/r/Curley.html" title="Curley">Curley</a> gave an account of the battle which indicated that Custer had attacked the village after crossing the river at the mouth of Medicine Tail Coulee and had been driven back across the river, retreating up the slope to the hill where his body was later found.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[12]</a></sup> This scenario seemed compatible with Custer's aggressive style of warfare, and with some of the evidence found on the ground, and formed the basis for many of the popular accounts of the battle.</p>

<p>Custer then released the Crow Scouts, including Curley and White Man Runs Him, from their duty. (White Man Runs Him was the first to tell General Terry's officers that Custer's force had "been wiped out".) Estimates of Lakota and Cheyenne casualties widely vary, from as few as 36 dead (from Indian listings of the dead by name) to as many as 300. The 7th Cavalry suffered 52% casualties: 16 officers and 242 troopers killed or died of wounds, 1 officer and 51 troopers wounded. Every soldier in Custer's detachment was killed, although for years rumors persisted of survivors.<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[13]</a></sup> The sole survivor that was found by General Terry's troops was Captain Keogh's horse <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comanche_%28horse%29.html" title="Comanche (horse)">Comanche</a>.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>
<p>By July, the 7th cavalry had been restocked with officers and new recruiting efforts were underway. It would again take the field in pursuit of its adversaries, but its legacy remains the Little Bighorn.</p>

<p>In 1878, the army awarded 24 <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medal_of_Honor_1efa.html" title="Medal of Honor">Medals of Honor</a> to participants in the fight on the bluffs for bravery, most for risking their lives to carry water from the river up the hill to the wounded.<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[15]</a></sup> Few questioned the conduct of the enlisted men, but many questioned the tactics, strategy, and conduct of the officers, particularly Custer having divided his command and his failure to support Major Reno as promised.</p>
<p>The battle was the subject of an army Court of Inquiry, made at Reno's request, in 1879 in <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago.html" title="Chicago">Chicago</a>, in which Reno's conduct was scrutinized. Some testimony was presented suggesting that he was drunk and a coward, but since none of this came from army officers, Reno's conduct was found to be without fault . Other factors have been identified which may have contributed to the outcome of the fight: it is apparent that a number of the cavalry troopers were inexperienced and poorly trained. Benteen has been criticized for "dawdling" on the first day of the fight, and disobeying Custer's order. Both Reno and Weir were heavy drinkers whose subsequent careers were truncated.<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[16]</a></sup> Custer has been criticized for General Terry's tardy arrival on the scene as he had failed to follow orders to send the scout Herendeen to advise Terry that the easier Tullock's Creek route was clear of hostiles.</p>
<p>Lieutenant General Nelson A. Miles, the US highest military commander in 1895 and one of the most succesful Indian fighters of all times, wrote in 1877 while studying the battlefield: <b>"The more I study the moves here [on the Little Big Horn], the more I have admiration for Custer."</b> <sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[17]</a></sup></p>
<p>For years a debate raged as to whether Custer himself had disobeyed Terry's order not to attack the village until reinforcements arrived. Finally, almost a hundred years after the fight, a document surfaced which indicated that Terry actually had given Custer considerable freedom to do as he saw fit - this document may be related to the infamous Mary Adams affidavit found to be a frame up produced by admirers of Custer as reported by well known researcher WA Graham in The Custer Myth<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup>. Custer's widow <a href="../../../l/i/b/Libby_Custer_0951.html" title="Libby Custer">Libby</a> actively affected the historiography of the battle by suppressing criticism of her husband. A number of participants decided to wait for her death before disclosing what they knew; however, she outlived almost all of them. As a result, the event was recreated along tragic <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victorian_era.html" title="Victorian era">Victorian</a> lines in numerous books, films and other media. The story of Custer's purported heroic attack across the river, however, was undermined by the account of participant <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chief_Gall_44aa.html" title="Chief Gall">Gall</a>, who told Lt. Edward Godfrey that Custer never came near the river.<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[18]</a></sup> In spite of this, however, Custer's legend was embedded in the American imagination as a heroic officer fighting valiantly against savage forces, an image popularized in "Wild West" extravaganzas hosted by showman <a href="../../../b/u/f/Buffalo_Bill_92d5.html" title="Buffalo Bill">"Buffalo Bill" Cody</a>.</p>
<p>By the end of the 20th century, the general recognition of the mistreatment of the various Indian tribes in the conquest of the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_West_ca70.html" title="American West">American West</a>, and the perception of Custer's role in it, have changed the image of the battle and of Custer. The Little Bighorn is now viewed by some as a confrontation between relentless U.S. westward expansion and warriors defending their land and way of life.</p>

Indian Memorial</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The site was first preserved as a <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._National_Cemetery_7e84.html" title="U.S. National Cemetery">national cemetery</a> in 1879, to protect graves of the 7th Cavalry troopers buried there. It was redesignated <i>Custer Battlefield <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._National_Monument_efd8.html" title="U.S. National Monument">National Monument</a></i> in 1946, and later renamed <i>Little Bighorn Battlefield National Monument</i> in 1991.</p>
<p>Memorialization on the battlefield began in 1879 with a temporary monument to U.S. dead. This was replaced with the current marble obelisk in 1881. In 1890 the marble blocks that dot the field were added to mark the place where the U.S. cavalry soldiers fell. The bill that changed the name of the national monument also called for an Indian Memorial to be built near Last Stand Hill. On Memorial Day 1999, two red granite markers were added to the battlefield where Native American warriors fell. As of December 2006, there are now a total of ten warrior markers (three at the Reno-Benteen Defense Site, seven on the Custer Battlefield).<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[19]</a></sup></p>
