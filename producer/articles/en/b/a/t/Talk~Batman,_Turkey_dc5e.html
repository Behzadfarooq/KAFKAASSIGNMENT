<p>It is obviously relevant to mention the peoples inhabiting a city, while presenting this city.

<p>First of all, I will staunchly refrain from attributing any ideology to my co-editors, since I would concider that as a personal attack. There is obviously a discord about the content, so let's discuss the content rather than the persons involved in the debate. My end with the above comments is in first hand to understand the reasons your edits. Without knowing these its difficult to have a debate about the content. I am aware that some people don't think there is such an ethnicity, and some would claim they are simply <i>Mountain Turks</i>. With this approach it is obvious to find the references to Kurdishness POV. I dont know if you adhere to that view. But if we recognize that Turkey has a Kurdish minority, I believe it is beyond doubt that the province of Batman, and the broader vaguely defined Southeast is predominantly Kurdish - well at least I have not heard anyone recognizing Kurdishness deny that. But please advance your arguments, now I am in the situation where I try to guess what your reasons for the controversial edits could be. <a href="../../../b/e/r/User%7EBertilvidet_529b.html" title="User:Bertilvidet">Bertilvidet</a> 09:03, 24 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Some claim Kurds as <i>mountain turks</i>. Thats a valid pov, a pov I dont necesarily share. Turkey has a kurdish minority no doubt but without official data, you cannot present statements such as "kurdish dominated". This isn't a denial, but more about NPOV. Just because people you met feel the place is predominantly kurdish, there is no data supporting this.</dd>
<dd>My edits are not contraversial. I am merely stating the obvious based on data. You do agree there was never a census determining ethnicity in Turkey or Batman. You also agree BBC says the place is predominantly kurdish. I simply stated that. Weather or not the place is predominantly kurdish or not is <i>unknown</i> no mather how likely it appears to be.</dd>

<dd>There is nothing called "Kurdish side" in Turkey. <b>Every single centimeter in this country is belongs to the Turkish nation</b>. Kurdish people are minority in Turkey and that is all about them, just like Georgians or Syrians. Once I mentioned that the term "minority" doesn't refer to a numerical data just like the term "majority", it is all about power and <b>Turkish nation</b> is in charge as the "majority"<b>(both numerical and political)</b> in Turkey. Please stop using the term "kurdish dominant" because even what the numbers say, all the lands in Turkey is ruled by the <b>Turkish Parliment</b> and they are all defended by the <b>Turkish</b> Army.

<dd>Cool Cat, I have to agree with Bertilvidet. A lot of sources have been cited in the last month that state that Batman is generally considered a town with a predominantly Kurdish population. No sources have been cited that present the opposite claim. If you know sources of the stature of the BBC and the Guardian that do, please cite them.

<p>The interesting thing, that makes it more difficult for me to see the arguments behind the removal of Kurdishness, is that even the Turkish government is about to fundamentally change its rhetoric on the Kurdish question. In August PM Erdogan went to <a href="../../../d/i/y/Diyarbak%C4%B1r.html" title="Diyarbakır">Diyarbakır</a> where he delivered a speech recognizing that he was in a Kurdish dominated area and claimed that the Kurdish question should be dealt with more democracy. On that occasion Erdogan stated on Turkish TV: "<i>The Kurdish citizens are my citizens. [Kurdishness] is a sub-identity. We must not confuse sub-identity with supra-identity. They must all be viewed as a whole, as citizens of the Republic of Turkey."</i> <a href="../../../b/e/r/User%7EBertilvidet_529b.html" title="User:Bertilvidet">Bertilvidet</a> 11:37, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>We need to be scientific. Just because Bush claims there are WMD in Iraq doesn't mean they exist. It was always a claim by Bush and the US government which they later said they were wrong <i>IIRC</i>. I am not here to discuss politics but you should see my point.</dd>
<dd>I do not give a damn about what the Turkish government thinks. Unless there is an official census it will have to stay as a <i>claim</i>. Frankly I don't see the problem.</dd>

<dd>The problem is that the Turkish government is not exactly a neutral source on the issue of Kurds (and they would be the <i>official</i> aspect of any "official census"). To insist that the ethnicity of the region is only <i>alleged</i> to be Kurdish since the government doesn't recognize the people there as being Kurdish is unwarranted since there are many sources that confirm that the region is predominantly Kurdish. --<a href="../../../m/o/b/User%7EMoby_Dick_b445.html" title="User:Moby Dick">Moby</a> 09:45, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hippalus, thanx for the effort in seeking a compromise. I do, however, agree with Cool Cat that the footnote solution not is optimal; but let's stick to it until we find a solution to the dispute. It is misleading to treat it as a claim of BBC. It is a widely accepted fact, to which I so far only know about political based contestations from the Turkish far right denying existance of Kurds. I don't mind spending a few hours finding and listing numerous academic and scholar articles, with exact references, describing Southeastern Turkey as predominantly Kurdish - but it will only be worth the effort if Cool Cat is open for scientific arguments and accepts that the Turkish Republic does not have the monopoly of truth, simply because it has the <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monopoly_on_the_use_of_force.html" title="Monopoly on the use of force">Monopoly on the use of force</a>. <a href="../../../b/e/r/User%7EBertilvidet_529b.html" title="User:Bertilvidet">Bertilvidet</a> 08:42, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This is getting rather frustrating. One single user wants to treat the Kurdishness of the city as "claim" by one news service, but refuses to come up with any source contradicting the claim. Despite this I propose to come up with academic sources, if Cool Cat is open to scientific arguments, and even unilateraly reverts the compromise. It is tempting to act the same way, and revert to the version I prefer - however I am interested in finding a settlement and reverts thus just back to compromise version. <a href="../../../b/e/r/User%7EBertilvidet_529b.html" title="User:Bertilvidet">Bertilvidet</a> 13:54, 29 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Cool Cat and Bertilvidet, thanks for your comments and legitimate criticisms on my 'proposal'. I agree with the two of you that this isn't a perfect solution, so we are united there at least&#160;;-). The good thing however about the proposal as Bertilvidet implemented it, is that it states Cool Cat's doubts, while refering to 'Kurds in Turkey' as the legitimate arena for further discussion of this issue. Cool Cat, Bertilvidet, Moby, can you agree on leaving this edition of the statement in peace till we agree on a better compromise? I think that would help our further debate a lot.</dd>
<dd>Maybe our next step should be to list the elements we all agree should be covered by the statement. I might give it a go tomorrow, but I invite you all to take the initiative.</dd>

<p>The Category <i>Kurdistan</i> has repeatedly been removed and I feel that tagging articles about the region that Kurds live in is a reasonable thing and will be adding the category back to the Batman articles and others. The primary argument (beyond personal opinion) used for the repeated removal has been that it somehow implies that Kurdistan is a country; as far as I know, no one has advanced the idea that it <i>is</i> a country — it demonstrably is not. However, the category has twice survived CFD and the use of the category does not really have this implication, it simply indicates that an area is a part of the historic lands of the Kurds, the land they have, and do, live in. <i>Kurdistan</i> may, at some point, become an independent nation — with northern Iraq as a likely start — but beyond documenting populations and the fact that there is a movement for the establishment of a Kurdish state, wikipedia articles should not, obviously, misrepresent the current state of the <i>Land of the Kurds</i>. Areas that can reasonably be cited as having predominate and historical Kurdish populations should be so categorized. --<a href="../../../m/o/b/User%7EMoby_Dick_b445.html" title="User:Moby Dick">Moby</a> 11:52, 31 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I agree, Moby, we have two issues at stake here. 1) Whether 'Kurdistan' is a legitimate category, 2) What articles fit into this category.</p>
<p>The first question has been answered positively in the CfD vote. However, I believe that before we start adding this category haphazardly to a lot of articles, we might better find a consensus on issue number two.

<p>I have been asked by <a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECool_Cat_eb3e.html" title="User:Cool Cat">User:Cool Cat</a> to come over and take a look at this dispute as a neutral third party. The first thing I will say is that just because Cool Cat has asked me over here, doesn't mean I'm going to take their side.</p>
<p>I understand from the article that the city is predominantly populated by Kurds, but that this information is hard to verify because the Turkish census doesn't list ethnicity, and that's fine. How you reference that is unimportant, as long as it is referenced, and any claims made in the article make it clear that this information is currently unverifiable by standard sources. I don't think it is enough to simply put "Batman is a city predominantly populated by Kurds" in the article, with the information about the lack of verifiability down below in the references: it has to be made clearer than that in the article itself. For example <i>Batman ... is a city in the south east of Turkey. It is the capital of Batman Province, and has a population of 246,700. The city is predominantly Kurdish</i> (if it is, that claim isn't actually made by the article itself) <i>although there are no official statistics to say what percentage of the population this respresents</i>. Feel free to rearrange but it does need to be pointed out as clearly as that.</p>
<p>As far as <a href="../../../k/u/r/Category%7EKurdistan_cd6f.html" title="Category:Kurdistan">Category:Kurdistan</a> goes I'll have a wander over to that category's talk page (when I have time) and discuss it there. -- <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrancs2000_6420.html" title="User:Francs2000">Fr</a><font color="green">a</font><a href="../../../f/r/a/User_talk%7EFrancs2000_b4ed.html" title="User talk:Francs2000">ncs2000</a> <a href="../../../g/a/y/Image%7EGay_flag.svg_c968.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/6/68/Gay_flag.svg/25px-Gay_flag.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="15" longdesc="../../../g/a/y/Image%7EGay_flag.svg_c968.html" /></a> 14:36, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thank you for the input. However, the problem with your suggestion is that it could be seemed at questioning whether the city actually is predominantly Kurdish. Even though the Turkish Republic does not register ethnicity, there is to my knowledge no sources disputing that the city and the region is predominantly Kurdish. <a href="../../../b/e/r/User%7EBertilvidet_529b.html" title="User:Bertilvidet">Bertilvidet</a> 14:49, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>...which is absolutely fine.

<dd>OK. So from a research point of view there is plenty of secondary evidence that Batman is predominantly Kurdish: it is mentioned as such in several verifiable news sources. As Cool Cat has pointed out above, there is a lack of primary evidence however in this case it appears to be that the lack of primary evidence is not that the "facts" as stated are false, but that, as pointed out, the Turkish census doesn't record ethnicity. Cool Cat, you asked me here for my opinion, and my opinion is that given the lack of primary sources stating what the ethnic breakdown of the city is, you have to rely on the secondary sources, which at the moment all state that the city is predominantly Kurdish.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>On to how the article is phrased. If you want to talk about the ethnicity of the population of Batman you have to point out in the body of the article itself that there is a lack of primary sources giving an exact ethnic breakdown of the city. However unless some secondary sources can be provided that state that this is not in fact the case (that it is predominantly Kurdish) then it is acceptable to rely on the secondary sources provided as references, but make sure one or two of the most verifiable ones are actually listed as references. It is not good to leave it stating that it is <i>in the predominantly Kurdish region of...</i>, because this is an article about the city, and that's what the reader has come to find out about. If good secondary references can be found that state that the city is not predominantly Kurdish then obviously that needs to be included in order for the article to remain neutral.</dd>

<dd>We're not claiming it as a hard fact, because hard facts are based on primary sources and we don't have any of those. This is why we need to point out the lack of primary evidence in the body of the article, if we are going to include something about the ethnicity of the city. Given the lack of primary sources, we have to rely on secondary sources, such as journalists from reputable news agencies and academics from reputable institutions referring to Batman as being predominantly Kurdish. I have yet to be provided with a good primary or secondary source that states that Batman is not a predominantly Kurdish city.</dd>

<p>So to summarise what the discussion has produced so far.</p>
<ul>
<li>Firstly this issue is not going to go away, and unilateral action of including or deleting categories from articles is not going to work. The only way to resolve this is through this discussion.</li>
<li>On the one hand we have no primary sources to say what the ethnic breakdown of the city is, and we have a link provided by the US embassy in Stockholm confirming that a lot of secondary sources coming from within Kurdish populations may be biased in favour of bumping up the figures. It is also not just Cool Cat who is disputing this (see <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia_talk%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_5257.html#changes_at_Category:kurdish_cities" title="Wikipedia talk:Administrators' noticeboard">Wikipedia talk:Administrators' noticeboard#changes at Category:kurdish cities</a>.</li>
<li>On the other hand we do still have a small handful of reputable news agencies referring to the city as "predominantly Kurdish" however for the moment that is all we have, and given the link provided from the US embassy that secondary evidence is no longer as reliable as it was. However in order to discount all eleven of the links provided above by User:Kolkezerine I would need evidence to suggest that the authors of each and every source was writing from a biased perspective.</li>
</ul>
<p>What this is going to need from both sides is more evidence to state the case one way or the other. The fundamental question at the end of the day is, what evidence do we have that these cities are predominantly Kurdish, and what evidence do we have that they are not? When we have gathered this evidence then it is time to discuss how it is presented in the article and others like it.

<dd>www.globalsecurity.org does not explain kurdish dominance in Batman. It does however talk about areas that PKK operated, any kurdistan map they have may simply be for areas the PKK was active.

<p><i>Although Kurds are to be found in Syria, the Caucasian republics of Armenia and Azerbaijan, Khorasan (in eastern Iran), and in Lebanon, the main concentration lives today where the Kurdish people have always lived - in the mountains where Iran, Iraq and Turkey meet. The heart of this area consists of the extremely rugged mountains of the Zagros range, running in ridges north-west to south-east. In the west these mountain folds give way to rolling hills, and to the Mesopotamian plain. To the north the mountains slowly turn to steppe-like plateau and the highlands of Anatolia. To the east the mountains fall away to lowlands onto which the Kurds have also spread.</i></p>
<p><i>Although the population is not exclusively Kurdish in much of this area, the dominant culture is Kurdish. From the early thirteenth century onwards much of this area has been called Kurdistan, although it was not until the sixteenth century, after the Kurds had moved north and west onto the Anatolian plateau, that the term Kurdistan came into common usage to denote a system of Kurdish fiefs. Since then, although the term Kurdistan appears on few maps, it is clearly more than a geographical term since it also refers to a human culture which exists in that land.</i></p>
<p><i>Nevertheless no map of Kurdistan can be drawn without contention, and for this reason the demographic map is not a political statement, but a statement of where large numbers of Kurds are found. Turkey for all practical purposes denies Kurdistan's existence, while Iran and Iraq are reluctant to acknowledge that it is as extensive as many Kurds would have them accept.</i></p>

<dd>Which areas fall inside Kurdistan and which parts do not. Who determines this? www.globalsecurity.org? www.minorityrights.org? CIA?</dd>
<dd>Although the term Kurdistan appears on few maps, I am supposed to accept it as just a brand new geographic region? Oh wait it just became a demographic region now...</dd>
<dd>So no one on earth campaigns for an independent Kurdistan? Kurdistan cant ever have any kind of political status. Is that so? human culture also exists in the United States but we do not have anything such as "Latinoistan" or "Negroistan" (pardon the slur, just trying to express a point).</dd>
<dd>If Turkey for all practical purposes denies Kurdistan's existence, how can we possibly mass tag articles with <a href="../../../k/u/r/Category%7EKurdistan_cd6f.html" title="Category:Kurdistan">Category:Kurdistan</a> in a neutral manner? If kurds live in a place it can be mentioned in the article. There is absolutely no reason for a category.

<p>This is an encyclopedia, it documents facts and provides information. There are Kurds in this world, and they come from a specific part of it. It is only reasonable that the mechanisms of this site, including categorization, be employed to cover issues relating to Kurds. The fact that the Turkish Government has denied the very concept of 'Kurd' should be covered; this fact is not, however, grounds for not covering the subject of Kurds — indeed it is an excellent reason to be sure to cover it fully and accurately with as many reputable sources as can be mustered. --<a href="../../../m/o/b/User%7EMoby_Dick_b445.html" title="User:Moby Dick">Moby</a> 02:24, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes this is an encyclopedia and this kind of categorisation makes it a soap box. The very concept of kurd is restcited to an article talking about kurds. Kurds do live in this city and no one objects to that including the turkish gov. What people object is the suggestion of some sort of "kurdish dominance".</dd>
<dd>If turkish gov is deniying a kurdish dominance then you cant suggest something contradicting that as a fact. You can present it as a claim however. What part of this is so hard to understand?</dd>

<p>Fine by me. About the article though... I think having a city with a majority of kurdish population is no problem, but the article seems to contain some propaganda wording. What do you say? I mean stating facts from a single POV is also propagando no? The article puts a lot of stress on "kurdish". I mean it's already stated at the beginning.

<dd>I've just re-read the article and nothing jumps out at me as <i><a href="../../../p/r/o/Propaganda.html" title="Propaganda">propaganda</a></i>. You do have a point that the Kurdish population is repeated in the <i>Until the 1950s...</i> paragraph; I believe that bit has been there for some time. It seems reasonable to me that since the region is and historically has been <i>Kurdish</i> that the article will tend to be heavy on that theme.</dd>

<dd>Retau, could you please try to moderate your comments while others are working to achieve consensus here? I believe that what you have said is designed to make others react in an inflammatory nature, and that helps no-one. I know this issue has caused a lot of conflict in the past, however others are making an effort and if you can't follow the example of others and change your tone, at least while taking part in discussions here, please don't say anything at all. -- <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrancs2000_6420.html" title="User:Francs2000">Fr</a><font color="green">a</font><a href="../../../f/r/a/User_talk%7EFrancs2000_b4ed.html" title="User talk:Francs2000">ncs2000</a> <a href="../../../g/a/y/Image%7EGay_flag.svg_c968.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/6/68/Gay_flag.svg/25px-Gay_flag.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="15" longdesc="../../../g/a/y/Image%7EGay_flag.svg_c968.html" /></a> 22:33, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As unfortunute as the kids death, wikipedia os not a memorial. 'harassment and detention' of Ayhan Karabulut may be a nice article in wikinews or a nice addition to Ayhan Karabulut but has no place in a city article as it has no significant impact to the city. --<small><a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECool_Cat_eb3e.html" title="User:Cool Cat">Cat</a> <a href="../../../c/o/o/User_talk%7ECool_Cat_0d3e.html" title="User talk:Cool Cat">out</a></small> 11:18, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>01/07 120 Aalstenaars herdenken door agent neergeschoten Turk Terwijl het gezin van de Turkse man Ceylan Ardiçlar, die midden juni is neergeschoten door een Aalsters politieagent, in Turkije is voor de begrafenis, hebben zo'n 120 mensen een herdenkingsplechtigheid gehouden in Aalst. Een twintigtal legde bloemen neer op de plek waar hij werd neergekogeld, vlakbij de Sint-Annabrug. Het was een stille herdenking, met een aantal speeches, maar geen echte betoging. De actievoerders, onder leiding van Hand in Hand, vragen wel met klem de opheldering van de zaak. Het waren vooral autochtone Aalstenaars die kwamen opdagen. Veel Turken zijn al op vakantie vertrokken en er waren voor deze herdenking weinig of geen afspraken gemaakt met de Turkse gemeenschap, beweert een neef van de overleden man, die in de buurt was. <a href="http://www.hbvl.be/nieuws/Binnenland/default.asp?art={1078CD97-E138-4AAD-820E-E420F5003D94}" class="external text" title="http://www.hbvl.be/nieuws/Binnenland/default.asp?art={1078CD97-E138-4AAD-820E-E420F5003D94}" rel="nofollow">Het Belang van Limburg</a></p>
<p>I won't translate it textually but this is an article in Het Belang van Limburg, prominent newspaper for Limburg region of Belgium, about a Turkish man -or to be more precise, on his commemoration by fellow townsfolk-, Ceylan Ardıçlar, who was shot down by a Belgian police agent mid-June in <a href="../../../a/a/l/Aalst%2C_Belgium_5138.html" title="Aalst, Belgium">Aalst, Belgium</a> (on the back, after a routine identity check, while Ardıçlar was quietly walking towards his home, no clash situation, no provocation or suspicious behavior whatsoever, absolutely nothing, clean-cut hard-working citizen, I can seek out additional details on the incident). But, if this incident deserves to be in the page for <a href="../../../a/a/l/Aalst%2C_Belgium_5138.html" title="Aalst, Belgium">Aalst, Belgium</a>, then I will view it as natural that the -extremely regrettable- incident of Fatih Tekin should be on the page for <a href="../../../b/a/t/Batman%2C_Turkey_e2ec.html" title="Batman, Turkey">Batman, Turkey</a>. I will highly appreciate if someone could inscribe the memory of Ceylan Ardıçlar on <a href="../../../a/a/l/Aalst%2C_Belgium_5138.html" title="Aalst, Belgium">Aalst, Belgium</a> page. In the meantime, I am removing the part on Fatih Tekin from here. <a href="../../../c/r/e/User%7ECretanforever_4f45.html" title="User:Cretanforever">Cretanforever</a></p>

<dd>I have restored the section re Fatih Tekin. I've also added <a href="../../../a/a/l/Aalst%2C_Belgium_5138.html" title="Aalst, Belgium">Aalst, Belgium</a> to my watchlist -- however I have no opinion on the matter you're referring to.

<p>what is the point to argue if batman population are dominantly kurds or not? the region is the central of kurdistan inhabited by kurdish tribes,especially after kurdish villages s been emptied and people forced to live in the urban areas its widely been moved by etnic kurds.today %90 of batman is kurds as i am from there.but with sizeable arabic and turk clerks families. croyance</p>
