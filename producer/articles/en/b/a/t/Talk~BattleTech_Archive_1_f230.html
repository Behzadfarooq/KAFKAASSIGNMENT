<dd>Wasn't BattleTech also a set of game centers (in California, at least) with "pods" that you could sit in while controlling BattleMechs and shooting one another and whatnot?

<p>Yes, although I had only heard of them in Chicago and possibly in Michigan. This is the game that is based on.</p>

<dd>From what I know, there was orginally one place in Chicago with the 'pods'. Then a company in <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japan.html" title="Japan">Japan</a> built a few places over there (memories of a Beyond2000 episode in the early '90s). Then <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virtual_World_96f9.html" title="Virtual World">Virtual World</a> started a chain that definately included the Walnut Creek location and one in <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Diego%2C_California_4c0a.html" title="San Diego, California">San Diego, California</a>.

<dd>Yes, these pods were leased to dave and busters by Virtual World Entertainment, www.virtualworld.com. The lease recently expired, and VWE sold them to private owners. A few examples are www.mechcorps.com (houston, tx) and www.mechjock.com (Kalmizoo, MI). The pods are now all privately owned and operated. Some in people's basements, some still in publicly playable locations. If you want more information, let me know. I Think that the pods should definately be mentioned in the article, as they have been around more then 10 years (they were first released in 1993ish).70.244.36.79 13:32, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There was a Virtual World at Triangle Square in Orange County and it claimed to be the second location outside of Chicago. It enjoyed moderate success, but was in a bad location and suffered for it until the mall evicted them. Later two Dave &amp; Busters picked up Battlepods and went on to sell them.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<hr />
<p><br />
According to a few of the authors (you can find quotes at www.classicbattletech.com), the classic era isn't definitely over.</p>
<p>Yes, I've heard about the pods in Chicago. We should probably say a little something about them at least, but I'm still pretty sure the books were first.</p>
<p>Also, why isn't there an "outside links?" section? We should definitely have a link here: <a href="http://www.classicbattletech.com/PDF/CompleteBattleTechNovel%20List.pdf" class="external free" title="http://www.classicbattletech.com/PDF/CompleteBattleTechNovel%20List.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.classicbattletech.com/PDF/CompleteBattleTechNovel%20List.pdf</a>. It'd be even better if we all got together and updated that list, but still, it is pretty accuracte and it does go to 2002, so it's something to work off at least. It's only classic battletech though, methinks.</p>
<p>Finally, it's nice to finally have a decent entry on battletech all in once place. Good job, everybody! Double kudos to whoever detailed each clan specifically.</p>

<p>Shouldn't the first line read a little differently? Battletech is not a board game - it was....2o years ago. NOW, it is this scifi universe, with computer games, board games, novels, etc. Yes, keep all the info listed including that it started with a board game, but what it IS, is a scifi universe, just like how you would not exatcly call Star Trek "a TV show," or Star Wars as "scifi movies." It's just not entirely correct, and for any skimmers/browsers who may only read the first lines of wikipedia entries - however they may do it (ie, popups entries in Trillian IM program) - the beginning should be clearly and say that battletech is a scifi universe.</p>
<dl>
<dd>That sounds reasonable. So follow the Wikipedia motto of "be bold!" about editing and edit the post. If someone doesn't like what you say or has a better idea, they'll change it.</dd>
</dl>
<p>I made an attempt at redefineing Battle tech. <a href="../../../a/i/d/User%7EAidanPryde_ad47.html" title="User:AidanPryde">AidanPryde</a> 17:46, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
If we would like to distinct the BattleTech board game from the BattleTech universe, wouldn't it make sense to make a separate subject for both of this?</p>
<p>It is interesting to note that video games using the BattleTech universe does not show the "BattleTech" sticker but the "BattleTech universe" one (even if "universe" is written in small characters). As I see it, the <a href="../../../b/a/t/BattleTech_universe_0be5.html" title="BattleTech universe">BattleTech universe</a> deserves its own subject, the <a href="../../../b/a/t/BattleTech_28c2.html" title="BattleTech">BattleTech</a> subject being a kind of portal to the whole BattleTech products, universe and derivates.</p>
<p>By the way I think it would be great to detail a bit more the BattleTech board game, in its own subject. I personaly would find very useful a complete listing of the BattleTech books on WikiPedia.</p>
<p>-- JP_Raven</p>
<p><br />
Do you mean the novels or the sourcebooks? The novels already have a page. Its linked under the "see also" section. If you mean the source books, I agree. <a href="../../../a/i/d/User%7EAidanPryde_ad47.html" title="User:AidanPryde">AidanPryde</a> 02:08, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I mean the source books. I was speaking about the BattleTech board game, so I mean the source books but also the rule books and the scenarii and the hexagonal maps and even the boxed sets. In short, the whole <a href="../../../f/a/s/FASA_d928.html" title="FASA">FASA</a> listing of books related to the <a href="../../../b/a/t/BattleTech_universe_0be5.html" title="BattleTech universe">BattleTech universe</a>. Later some kind of review could be added for each of them: what it is about, what can be found in it and in no other book, what differs in this book compared to older revisions (in case of rules), and so on. Would it be possible (from the licence point of view) to add some pictures of the front pages? Finally, the listing could be extended with the newest books, now published by <a href="../../../f/a/n/FanPro_2065.html" title="FanPro">FanPro</a> under licence of <a href="../../../w/i/z/WizKids_3e3b.html" title="WizKids">WizKids</a> and under the new brand name Classic Battletech Universe. -- JP_Raven</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Ka Ragin and "Whence the King"</span></h2>
<p>There seems to be a false entry in the "In Jokes" section,</p>
<p>"The character of Ka Ragin in "Whence the King" is a sniveling but argumentative hand-servant of the ComStar Precentor Martial, Victor Steiner-Davion. As is common in the newer products put out by FanPro, references to outspoken or supportive fans are often made and this character is an homage (of sorts) to fan "Karagin" from the Classic BattleTech forums."</p>
<p>There is no BT novel, "Whence the King," and it does not seem to be a short story on Battlecorps.com.</p>
<p>BT writers have said (of course) that they only "canonize" players in a good light. To date, it doesn't seem possible to find a fan included in canonical Battletech products in a negative light.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Oddly, there is indeed a person on CBT.com's fora called Karagin. Quite why that entry was made is questionable. If it was an attempt to drag a dispute from Classic Battletech's fora to here, I'd advise the person responsible that such behavior is just as unacceptable here as there.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Trivia and In-Jokes</span></h2>
<p>I'm starting to get a little concerned about this section. I'm thinking maybe it should be trimmed, restricted or even eliminated altogether. There are <i>so many</i> such in-jokes and humorous bits embedded within the 20-year-old BattleTech canon that to list them all would be a gargantuan task and far outside the scope of Wikipedia's mission.</p>
<p>I think all of the items listed there should be removed, except <i>maybe</i> the Team Banzai note, but only if mention is made that explicit references to Dr. Banzai have been excised from current sourcebooks due to copyright concerns. Even that, though, I think is an iffy case.</p>
<p>But really, <a href="../../../a/r/e/Area_51.html" title="Area 51">Area 51</a>? It's not exactly a major surprise that a science fictional setting contains such a reference. Duh.</p>

<dd>Perhaps the trivia and in-jokes should get their own Wiki page rather than cluttering up a serious overview of the setting. Don't discard all the accumulated in-jokes, just move them.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I've been keeping an eye on it(and adding to it,) myself and have been trying to pare down the superflous trivia.</dd>
<dd>While I feel some of the major references are important - as is the canonised personalities, if only to highlight the charity work. Do we really need the smaller ones like the E.Presley? Should've though that was self explanatory...</dd>
<dd>But of course, that's the problem with trivia; it's trivial. -JayFrancis</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Could we keep the list of Canonised personalities just to the ones listed at present. As big of a pain as is it to pull Will Mouat and Cody Bergens ref's, If we listed every BT player who'd been mentioned in an Field Manual(including myself), we'd have to start a whole new article!&#160;:-D</p>
<p>I think we should keep the Trivia and injokes section as is. Unless major references show up that warrant mentioning. <a href="../../../a/i/d/User%7EAidanPryde_ad47.html" title="User:AidanPryde">AidanPryde</a> 08:40, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Because new, non-anime based designs (for other 'Mechs) were already in print when the anime-based designs were dropped, so the legal problems weren't the reason for making new designs. Also the phrasing was a little confusing since BattleTech uses the word "design" to refer to the stats of a 'Mech rather than its appearance. Skiltao 01:01, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Adding Mech info?</span></h2>
<p>I was thinking one major element missing from this is detailed info on individual mechs. So I thought a list of mechs with specs, brief discription/history and possibly pictures would be very imformative. That way, when reading a novel, you could look a mech up understand more of whats going on in the novel. The only reason I have not started it is this seems like it might infringe upon the copyright.

<dd>I think it is a good idea. I don't think it would infringe upon copyright, as long as we don't simply copy description from (source)books.

<dd>I say thee nay! That's way too much info for the main page and I don't think they should be put on separate pages either. There are already several sites in the Links section that have complete info from all the published Technical Readouts; why duplicate? And as for WP being better than the fansites, I don't see it happening. WP is good for many things, but it isn't a dedicated resource on any one topic like those sites can be and are. For instance, I just don't see WP ever being as good a resource on Mechs as <a href="http://forums.mechground.com" class="external text" title="http://forums.mechground.com" rel="nofollow">Mechground</a> or <a href="http://www.chaosmarch.com" class="external text" title="http://www.chaosmarch.com" rel="nofollow">Chaos March</a>. Does anyone honestly see an article on the <i>Marauder</i> or <i>Warhammer</i> having as much info as the <a href="../../../v/f/-/VF-1_Valkyrie_aa08.html" title="VF-1 Valkyrie">VF-1 Valkyrie</a> entry that <a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPiotrus_27db.html" title="User:Piotrus">Piotr</a> mentioned? I sure don't. And there'd be even less info on the newer designs. All of which means wasted effort when those articles become fodder for a VfD. The BattleTech article is already way too cluttered as it as, anyway. I totally agree with <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobomaster_55b2.html" title="User:Robomaster">Robotech_Master</a> that it would be fancruft and is therefore a bad idea. --<a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatrick_T._Wynne_f886.html" title="User:Patrick T.

<dd>This is why I suggest starting with a list first. It's kind of strange that we have a <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_BattleTech_characters_186f.html" title="List of BattleTech characters">List of BattleTech characters</a> but no List of BattleTech mecha. And while those sites may contain better material now, I'd be happy to place a bet that they won't in few years. If it's encyclopedic - fiction or not - it will end up on Wiki. You don't want to move it? Fine. Somebody else will. It will start poorer then those website? Probably. Will it get expanded faster and benefit from hyperlinks to our other content? Betch'ya.

<dd>Not strange at all. For one thing, there's a <i>much</i> smaller list of BattleTech characters than there are of 'Mechs (please stop calling them mecha; that term isn't used in BattleTech and is therefore inaccurate). And I would take that bet in a second. Wikipedia is a vast resource and contains a lot of info and I am very much a supporter, but it is just no match for a dedicated resource that only focuses on one topic. Will a WP article on, say, <a href="../../../f/o/r/Forensic_psychology.html" title="Forensic psychology">forensic psychology</a> <i>ever</i> be a match for a textbook on the same subject? Of course not. Will a WP biography article on, say, <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Clinton_75aa.html" title="Bill Clinton">Bill Clinton</a> ever be a match for a published biography of the man? Of course not. Wikipedia has more breadth, but not as much depth as a dedicated resource on any particular topic. It's the same with BattleTech. There's just no need for hundreds of tiny articles on all the 'Mechs in the BattleTech universe.</dd>
<dd>A list isn't much better, because what can you say in a list that gives enough info to be useful without being too much info for a single page? Are you gonna put the stats for each 'Mech in the list? Just the tonnage? Weapons loadout? At that point you have too much info for a list but not enough for a full page. Does someone who doesn't know anything about BattleTech <i>need</i> all that info? Nope. Do they need to know that there are X number of variants of the <i>Battlemaster</i> and Y number of variants of the <i>Griffin</i>? Of course not. But you could make a very good argument that the list of characters is exactly the kind of info such an audience needs. BattleTech is nowhere near a commonly-known thing like <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robotech.html" title="Robotech">Robotech</a> or the <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middle-Earth_4e64.html" title="Middle-Earth">Middle-Earth</a> books and really doesn't need the same level of coverage as those. To do so would be hijacking WP for the purposes of a small, overly-obsessive fanbase (in which, of course, I count myself).</dd>
<dd>There's also the question of scope. There are over 100 different models of Clan BattleMechs (not counting the numerous variations) and three times as many Inner Sphere 'Mechs. Are you going to put them all on one list? What's next? A list of every character to ever get a line in a BattleTech novel? Every planet in the universe? Those would be ridiculous... as would a list of 'Mechs. Never mind that the information is the very definition of <a href="../../../f/a/n/Wikipedia%7EFancruft_fe73.html" title="Wikipedia:Fancruft">fancruft</a>; there's just so much of it, Wikipedia can never hope to have useful articles or even lists that cover it all, despite your assertions about the greatness of WP. (Assertions with which, for the most part, I agree.) They would be prime targets for VfDs and for <a href="../../../c/o/n/Template%7EContext_4c09.html" title="Template:Context">Template:context</a>. Showing a few pictures of common 'Mechs here in the main article (which I feel is accomplished by the three novel covers) and labelling them as such is sufficient to get across the point about what a BattleMech is and what one looks like. Anyone who is interested in more can check out one of the links at the bottom of the page that contains detailed info on and pictures of <i>all</i> 'Mechs. That's why there are "external links" sections at all; because Wikipedia shouldn't include every little teeny-tiny bit of information on every obscure or of limited interest topic. --<a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatrick_T._Wynne_f886.html" title="User:Patrick T.

After all, MechWarrior 2 was dedicated to them, as are many paperback books, as well as a significant portion of Dark Age products put out by WizKids. Not to mention the invasion of the Inner Sphere (Wolcott, Luthien, etc.) <a href="../../../w/i/z/User%7EWizardry_Dragon_6d1a.html" title="User:Wizardry Dragon">Wizardry Dragon</a> 20:54, 17 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Looking at it again, The "Major Political Powers" section only refers to the Inner Sphere.

<dd>However, the "Invading Clans" are, as a group, a significant Inner Sphere power... is there a reason that the Rasalhague Dominion gets singled out, or can it (and the FRR) be moved to Minor Powers?

<dl>
<dd>Yes but when the term "Inner Sphere" is used, it refers to the Great Houses, not any Clans. Those invading Clans are still considered Clans by both Warden Clans not in the Inner Sphere and the Inner Sphere itself. If the Steel Wolves don't belong with the Clans, where do they belong? They are certainly a power worth mentioning. They're more Clan than anything else and their questionable status as a Clan could be (or may already be) explained in the article on the Steel Wolves. I do agree the RD and FRR are minor powers. I dont mean to split hairs, but is Comstar really a minor political power? IIRC, They do have the power to rival one of the four houses of the Inner Sphere, which to makes them more of a Major power to me.<a href="../../../a/i/d/User%7EAidanPryde_ad47.html" title="User:AidanPryde">AidanPryde</a> 04:16, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Mercenary companies are not clans (Wolf Dragoons being somewhat of an exception, but... spoilers&#160;:&gt;).--<a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPiotrus_27db.html" title="User:Piotrus">Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus</a> <sup><a href="../../../p/i/o/User_talk%7EPiotrus_217f.html" title="User talk:Piotrus"><font color="green">Talk</font></a></sup> 22:45, 7 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I was under the assumption that Kell Hounds was a clan. I think I remember it being called Clan Kell Hounds in Mech 4: Mercs. I might be wrong though. <a href="../../../t/y/p/User%7ETyper_525_ec4a.html" title="User:Typer 525">Typer525</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/y/p/User_talk%7ETyper_525_10ed.html" title="User talk:Typer 525">Talk</a></sup> <b><a href="../../../u/s/e/Special%7EUserlogout_406b.html" title="Special:Userlogout">Click here at your own risk</a></b> 23:59, 8 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>They are, however, closely allied to Clan Wolf-in-exile, through Khan Phelan Ward Kell, who was captured by the Wolf Clan and adopted into their ranks. When he led the Warden Wolves into exile, he took refuge in the Kell Hounds' Arc-Royal Defense Cordon. --<a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGroggy_Dice_1730.html" title="User:Groggy Dice">Groggy Dice</a> 19:04, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
