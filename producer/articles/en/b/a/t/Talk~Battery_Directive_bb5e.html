Without prejudice to Directive 2002/96/EC, annual collection and sales figures shall include batteries and accumulators incorporated into appliances.</p>
<p>2. Member States shall achieve the following minimum collection rates:</p>
<p>(a) 25 % by 26 September 2012;</p>
<p>(b) 45 % by 26 September 2016.</p>
<p>3. Member States shall monitor collection rates on a yearly basis according to the scheme set out in Annex I. Without prejudice to Regulation (EC) No 2150/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 November 2002 on waste statistics (2), Member States shall transmit reports to the Commission within six months of the end of the calendar year concerned. Reports shall indicate how they obtained the data necessary to calculate the collection rate.</p>
<p>4. In accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 24(2):</p>
<p>(a) transitional arrangements may be laid down to address difficulties faced by a Member State in satisfying the requirements of paragraph 2 as a result of specific national circumstances;</p>

<p>1. May need to augment the list of European states already using battery regulation.</p>
<p>2. Think the auto battery makers wanted to get away with specifying a battery's number of "cold cranking amps" as a capacity rating, arguing "CCA" was a true measure of "performance." I think what the EU intended was for makers to mark battery life expectancy so consumers could shop more mindfully of environmental impact. Vendors and auto stores are correct in that drivers want to know how well they can start their trucks on cold mornings, SOMEWHAT measurable in amps. Ergo the CCA ratings. Generally batteries with higher CCAs are better quality and last longer but this isn't necessarily an indicator of life expectancy.</p>
<p>Even "Reserve Capacity" (please see the <i>Terms and Ratings</i> section of <a href="../../../c/a/r/Car_battery.html" title="Car battery">Car_battery</a> for a more comprehensive detailing of auto battery specifications) ratings on some auto batteries, which give the amount of time a battery will furnish enough current for power to run the car when the generator stops working, at a minimum of 87.5% of the nominal battery voltage, only indicate battery "charge" (Current X Time) at a specific temperature.</p>
<p>So both of these parameters, "CCA" and "charge" (really discharge) are relatively short-term capacity specifications that don't absolutely indicate longevity. Upon depletion, lead-acid car batteries are recharged, so are not at end-of-life. Factors in longevity are use, i.e., workloads (short-term cranking or normal workload), rest periods, the buildup of unavailable charge during discharge.</p>
<p>Car battery warranty durations are usually touted by salespeople as a quasi-life expectancy. Though longer warranty batteries last "longer," it has always seemed to this author that they are a considerable exaggeration of true life of battery.</p>
<p>So even if a battery is rated at 1000 CCA, then 1000 (Amps) = 1000 (Coulombs/second) X [6.3 x 10^18 (electrons/Coulomb)] = 6.3 x 10^21 (electrons/second), an O.G. like I can short the jumper cables and tell if how much charge an auto battery has.</p>

<p>The Wall Street Journal (subscription <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB116435311247031964.html?mod=home_whats_news_us" class="external autonumber" title="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB116435311247031964.html?mod=home_whats_news_us" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>), in an article by Arran Scott &amp; Yoshio Takahashi, on defects found by Sony Corporation on the Liquid Crystal Displays of eight of its digital cameras, reported 24 Nov. 2006 that Sony Corporation's battery recall (please see below) had triggered costs contributing to its net profit dropping 94% for the quarter ending September 2006. Article states up to 9.6 million Sony-made batteries recalled.</p>
<p>The following articles were covered in the Nov. 2006 "Current Newsbreaks section of Conformity Magazine:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>1 Dell Computer, Apple Recall Millions of Notebook Computer Batteries</li>
<li>2 Shipping Lithium Ion Batteries May Soon Be Subject to Tougher Restrictions</li>
<li>3 Other Battery-Related Recalls</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>1. The recall of laptop lithium-ion batteries in laptops made by Dell and Apple alone (IBM and others not mentioned) made by Sony Energy Devices Corporation of Japan (who have apologized for the recall <a href="http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/wsj/access/1150715601.html?dids=1150715601:1150715601&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;date=Oct+25%2C+2006&amp;author=Yukari+Iwatani+Kane&amp;pub=Wall+Street+Journal&amp;edition=Eastern+edition&amp;startpage=B.2&amp;type=8_90&amp;desc=Sony+Apologizes+for+Battery+Recall" class="external text" title="http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/wsj/access/1150715601.html?dids=1150715601:1150715601&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;date=Oct+25%2C+2006&amp;author=Yukari+Iwatani+Kane&amp;pub=Wall+Street+Journal&amp;edition=Eastern+edition&amp;startpage=B.2&amp;type=8_90&amp;desc=Sony+Apologizes+for+Battery+Recall" rel="nofollow">Abstract; Wall Street Journal</a>) numbered than six million.</p>
<p>According to this article, exploding Li-Ion batteries have resulted in property damage and minor human skin burns. These companies' websites related to the recall are:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dellbatteryprogram.com" class="external text" title="http://www.dellbatteryprogram.com" rel="nofollow">Dell</a></p>
<p><a href="http://support.apple.com/batteryprogram" class="external text" title="http://support.apple.com/batteryprogram" rel="nofollow">Apple</a></p>
<p>2. The Wall Street Journal is quoted reporting that the FAA has started an assessment on the financial impact on commercial cargo carriers that regulation of the shipment of the LiIon batteries on cargo planes would have; that no outright ban of laptops with Li Ion batteries on cargo planes is expected since fire suppression has been manageable. The FAA started testing after receiving five reports of battery-related fires on aircraft. The FAA showed its findings at a NTSB hearing in the summer of 2006.</p>
<p>3. Other battery recalls:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lands’ End (Wisconsin), after an internal review, announced the recall of ~40 Cool Blue brand children’s backpacks</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Spin Master Toys (Toronto, Canada) voluntarily recalled ~7500 units Air Hogs RC Skywinder Radio-Controlled Airplanes</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Children’s Science Kits: School Specialty Publishing (Ohio) recalled ~43,000 Ideal and Brighter Child brand science kits.</li>
</ul>
<p>In all three above cases, possible overheating and burn hazard are cited. The first two products were made in China, the third, in S. Africa.</p>

<p>From the European Information &amp; Communications Technology Industry Association <a href="http://www.eicta.org/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.eicta.org/" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>; EICTIA "Position Papers" Section:</p>
<p>Joint Postion Paper<a href="http://www.eicta.org/fileadmin/user_upload/document/document1169736276.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.eicta.org/fileadmin/user_upload/document/document1169736276.pdf" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>; 7 December 2006; on the Battery Directive's "battery removability" requirement (Article 11)</p>
<p>This paper calls for clarification by the European Commission on battery removability and replaceablity and states it may be difficult and costly to redesign a wide gamut of small electronics products so that the end user can easily replace the battery. Endemic in the minitiarization of electronic consumer products like PDAs, key fobs, Bluetooth products, solar-powered calculators, watches, MP3 players, cameras, instant cell phone chargers, game devices, appliances, etc. is the placement of small, flexible batteries, deep inside the product (which affords fire and mechanical safety), but which do NOT provide easy consumer access. The paper says compliance would necessitate larger enclosures and packaging that run counter to what consumers want -- minitiarization. It urges that the replaceability not be exclusively interpreted as end-user replaceability, since some of these products should have their batteries replaced at professional dealers, and argues for leniency in the Article 11 language. Alongside this, it states that in some cases it may be better for the consumer to go to a professional center or dealer for battery replacement -- this would insure better personnel safety, proper battery-handling and recyling, and less risk of damage to the product itself. In these cases it says it would be better for the vendor to give guidelines or instructions on battery replacement which may direct the consumer to the center. It also argues the economic need for the European Union to stay competitive with the rest of the world in new battery technology, i.e., flexible, rechargeable Organic Radical Batteries used in products like RFIDs, smartcards, and electronic paper, that are sometimes 0.3 mm thick. The paper also argues that if it's easily removable, it's unsafe, especially for kids, and may violate safety and toy directives.</p>
