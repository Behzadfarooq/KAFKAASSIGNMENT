<p><i>New Shipwrecked Castaway:</i> Jenni Danns</p>
<p><i>Nominations:</i> None</p>
<p><b>Episode nineteen</b> Days 127 - 133</p>
<p>Its the final week and the final new arrival has landed, with the tribes equal it is time for them to both go all out for Jenni, in order to ensure that she picks their island, and potentially make that island the winners of Shipwrecked 2006 and £70,000 richer. There is a twist this week however, at the final beach party, there will be open nominations, meaning any amount of people can nominate themselves to move to the opposing island, and any amount of people can be accepted, but will anyone nominate themselves? New arrival Jenni spends her first 3 days with the Sharks and wants to know everything about the Sharks in order to help her make her decision, she finds it hilarious that they have decided to build a shoe rack, a gym and a bar, rather than concentrate on making their hut as warm and comfortable as possible. Meanwhile Tigers sit down to decide which 3 people from Sharks they should bring over for the special island swap. After a long chat they decide to bring over Laura (her first night away from Sharks in 5 months), James Maudie and Jo. The Tigers think they have a good chance of persuading Jo, so on her time there Katie and Rory take her aside to explain they’re still guilt ridden about rejecting her brother Geoff 14 weeks ago and this would be their way of making amends, is this genuine or tactical? When asked why Sharks should win James Maudie gives a great speech about his tribe being the underdogs. Jenni spends her last 3 days with the Tigers, and they play at her heart strings, and decide to put together a time capsule so when they leave, it would be like they left something of themselves on the island. Over on Shark HQ, the Sharks are contemplating on which 3 Tigers to bring over for the night. They decide on Charlie Freeman (her first night away from the Tigers in 5 months), John (an original Shark who they want to bring home for the night), but their final choice is more tactical as they decide on Richie, as he is a major game player and they want to keep him away from the new arrival, but they can't fool Richie who has his suspicions straight away. As the last Saturday before the beach party draws to an end, all the castaways settle in to sleep for the night, all except one, who tomorrow will be making probably the biggest decision of her life, but which tribe will she choose, and will anyone nominate themselves at the last minute to move islands?</p>
<p><b>Episode twenty</b></p>
<p>5 months ago 10 castaways were shipwrecked in the middle of the south Pacific. During the course of 20 weeks 19 new arrivals, have arrived, and going into the final week they were equal at 14 castaways each. Now the final new arrival has come, and she has the power to choose who wins. Its the day of the final beach party and the mood on Shark Island is sombre, they are getting ready for the final beach party which will be held on their island, but Jenni's choice is praying hard on their minds. "i deserve to win so im probably not going to" Lou says, where's the fighting spirit? Over on Tiger Island, the mood is the same, but they have Jenni there, and they let her know how hard they have worked for the 5 months to build a foundation, and to get on with everyone, and that they really want to win this. Jenni is in absolute turmoil, and doesn't know what she is going to do. The Tigers head off to Shark Island, and when they arrive in a final ditch attempt to influence Jenni's vote the Tigers don't leave her side, and this hasn't got unnoticed by the Sharks or Jenni. Not content with letting just Jenni make the decision Tiger Katie takes Jo aside to ask her again about nominating herself to Tiger Island, again not going unnoticed by the Jenni or the Sharks, 'their just bad people' James Maudie says. Jenni's thinking time is over and it is time for her to make her decision. Both tribes wait anxiously for Jenni’s decision. But the wait is over when she announces that the impractical Sharks made the biggest impact on her. Shark Jo doesn’t nominate herself to move islands. The Sharks win Shipwrecked 2006 and share the £70,000 prize money. While the Sharks and John clebrate the Tigers world falls apart, They have spent the past 19 weeks working extremely hard to build an impressive hut and establish a tight knit community, because of their efforts they desperately wanted to win, so as the Sharks rejoice the Tigers are left completely devastated. The day is rounded off with some dancers and entertainment. The morning after the beach party it is time for both tribes to leave their islands for good. They both clap their flags down tearfully, for some it’s a time for celebration, others a time to shed a tear, but for many it’s just been a very long five months!</p>

<p><b>*</b> = Geoff was the first member of Shipwrecked who nominated to move tribes to Tigers because of his exile from Sharks, the Tigers denied his request and subsequently asked to leave the show.</p>
<p><b>**</b> = John (Sharks) and Kevin (Tigers) were forced to switch tribes during Episode 16 after Tigers 'kidnapped' Anna and Sharks illegally raided Tiger Island to bring her and Kevin back.</p>

<p>During the sixteenth week in the competition, both tribes were asked to select a member of the opposing side to stay for one night, in a game where numbers are vital this was an ideal opportunity to claim back former members who have switched. The Shark Tribe ask for Katie who is a founding member of the Tigers and is heavily inclined towards them. When the Tigers ask for Anna the Sharks are wary of their strategy and eagerly await the return of their tribe member.</p>
<p>After a night of enjoyment on Tigers, the group decide to kidnap Anna in exchange for food items. (though when they originally voice the idea you can hear Anna agree to it.) Enraged by the demands, the Sharks endure the 1/2 mile swim and demand the return of their tribe mate who is hidden in the jungle, Shipwrecked rules dictate that an opposing tribe cannot stand on the opposing island unless invited or if it is a Sunday (generally known as a Beach Party where the new castaway decide their tribe). The Sharks violate this rule by raiding the camp and in doing so taking Kevin with them, thus breaking another rule by unofficially joining an island without nomination. At the Beach Party in which Ryan chose his tribe (eventually, Tigers) they were informed that they would be punished for their actions, and that each tribe must sacrifice one of their own to move <i>permanently</i>. Tiger Island accepted Kevins wish to move, meanwhile Shark Islanders James George and John Melvin stated they would move, although James suffered heavily whilst he was on Tigers and John was known as the leader of Shark Island.</p>
<p>When Kevin and John swapped necklaces - they were reminded that this was non-negotiable. And they would never bear their old tribes necklace, much to the dismay of Sharks.</p>
