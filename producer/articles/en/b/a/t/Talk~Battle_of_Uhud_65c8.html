<p>The first version of this article was fatally flawed due to copyvio and PoV, so I've started fresh with facts taken from other WP article's and Will Durant's Age of Faith (which in turn references Sir W. Muir's The Caliphate (1891) and Life of Mohammed (1912).--<a href="../../../f/r/s/User%7EFRS_3198.html" title="User:FRS">FRS</a> 20:17, 6 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm afraid those references are extremely dated. I think I could write a tolerable article, using contemporary sources, from books I have plus whatever I can find at my Questia account. I may not have access to the best array of sources.

<li>What is your source for saying that Sunni view of the caliohs action differ? Find a source, or remove your original research!´--<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 23:13, 15 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<p>The template is clumsy, ugly, and takes up way too much screen space. The lists are controversial material; you had edited them to fit your Shi'a slant (Abu Bakr, Umar, and Uthman as cowards). Rather than spend many hours trying to track down all lists of the dead and all accounts of individual actions in the battle, it seems wiser to let the issue be.</p>
<p>The Sunni view differs as proved by Ibn Ishaq. He praises Abu Dujana and Hamza by name, among others. Ali is mentioned only as giving water to Muhammad.</p>
<p>Original research? Striver, I based all of what I wrote on Ibn Ishaq and Watt, who in turn says that he used primarily Ibn Ishaq, Waqidi, Ibn Sa'd, and Tabari. You think that Watt isn't a good source? <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 23:41, 15 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've added a line of text about the archers that were supposed to guard the Muslim flank and their failure to comply with orders. Does any of you have definitive sources that can prove or contradict this supposition, other than a few passages in the Qur'an itself that I think I'm not quite capable of translating?</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'm not sure that should be there. I wrote the article following Watt, who distrusts the whole "archers abandoned their post" theory. He says that this was a Muslim explanation AFTER THE FACT to explain why the Muslims had lost the battle, even though they had Allah on their side. It could only have been human error.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, those verses are there in the Qur'an. I, as a non-Muslim, do not believe that the Qur'an tells the whole truth about the battle. I trust Watt, who worked from the other narratives about the battle preserved in Ibn Ishaq, Tabari, Ibn Sa'd, and Waqidi. I dunno whether you are going to insist on the truth of the Qur'an, in which case we need a new section in the article, contrasting Muslim versus secular beliefs re the battle. Perhaps that should be there in any case. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 12:36, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I agree completely with the idea to add a section comparing the various interpretations of the battle. An encyclopedia article putting forth only Watt's interpretation would be just as faulty as one that puts total reliance on the "official" Muslim accounts. Anyway, we don't know which version is true, but we <i>do</i> know that there are several different versions, and we know quite a bit about what each of them says. Since you seem to have more resources than I do at this point, would you mind taking up the task?&#160;;) <a href="../../../l/_/c/User%7EL_clausewitz_b0a6.html" title="User:L clausewitz">Lay</a> 14:24, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Both the pictures are going to go away in a week unless the uploaders give info on copyright.

<p>This article did not mention Umm Ammara (also known as Nusaybah bint Ka'b), who among the few who stayed behind with the men to fight in the defence of the prophet prophet.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I relied primarily on Watt. There is an immense literature on Uhud, but much of it is late and possibly fabricated. You'll have to give some cites. Is she in Ibn Ishaq? Tabari? <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 04:52, 20 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't know but I can link you to this these two articles. They mention the sources they were based on at the bottom: <a href="http://www.geocities.com/mutmainaa1/people/umara.html" class="external free" title="http://www.geocities.com/mutmainaa1/people/umara.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.geocities.com/mutmainaa1/people/umara.html</a> <a href="http://www.routledge-ny.com/middleages/islamic/women.html" class="external free" title="http://www.routledge-ny.com/middleages/islamic/women.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.routledge-ny.com/middleages/islamic/women.html</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>The earliest source given is Ibn Sa'd. Bukhari is somewhat later.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>So much of early Islamic history consists of reminiscences of the great things that one's father or grandfather did in such and such battle, especially Badr or Uhud. I suspect that much of this is inflated. We can't put it all in the article. It would be better just to write an article on Umm Ammara, instead of trying to squeeze her into the account of the battle. Instead of linking her article to Uhud, it would probably be better to have an article on Islamic military history, with a section on women warriors and link her article there. Talk to the guy who did so much work on the Badr article -- Palm Dogg, I think it is. He is very interested in Islamic military history. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 06:00, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I deleted two links, one of which was a copyvio, one of which was a personal essay by someone not notable. I left two links, one to an audio download (not a good link, really) and one to a site called Shia.org. I don't particularly like these links either.</p>
<p>Could someone do some googling and come up with GOOD Shi'a and Sunni links, from sites that represent mainstream opinion and large organizations? Any academic links would be good too. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 06:03, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
