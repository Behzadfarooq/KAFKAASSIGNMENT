<dd>I thought you were exaggerating, but having just reread them I have to admit that, dammit, you're right. By the time I was halfway down the page I wanted to marry myself (alas, still not possible in UK law, apparently, despite the breakthrough in same-sex partnerships).</dd>

<p><i>From <a href="../../../b/a/s/User_talk%7EBastin8_2f61.html" title="User talk:Bastin8">User talk:Bastin8</a></i></p>
<p>Just a tiny point, but you said on this AfD (in which I supported your call to delete) "Moreover, use of the term 'paedophile' is understood by the public to imply that the paedophile actually practises it, just as is homosexual." I am not sure you actually meant that. Do you really think that when someone says they are a homosexual, or gay, or like men, or whatever, that they are necessarily a <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anal_sex.html" title="Anal sex"><i>practising</i> homosexual</a>? Of course not. "<a href="../../../h/o/m/Homosexuality.html" title="Homosexuality">Homosexual</a>" is a statement of sexual orientation, not of sexual practice. <a href="../../../b/a/t/User%7EBatmanand_01d3.html" title="User:Batmanand">Batmanand</a> 23:23, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Indeed, it does not <i>mean</i> that one practises, but its meaning is beside the point. Legally, besides whether or not a statement is true, the only factor that matters under US law is that of interpretation by the audience. As the audience of Wikipedia is the general population, the general understanding (or misunderstanding, as it is on most subjects) is more important than either a dictionary or academic definition. Since all forms of protection from libel are based upon defamatory effects, for purposes of establishing suitability, popular definitions should always be adopted over academic ones in topics that are so poorly defined. <a href="../../../b/a/s/User%7EBastin8_2990.html" title="User:Bastin8">Bastin8</a> 23:38, 13 January 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I take your point, but I also believe that under United States law (I could find the Supreme Court case if you want, but frankly I can't be bothered at the moment), the truth can <i>never</i> be libellous or defamatory. Therefore, the truth (that "homosexual" is necessarily an orientation as opposed to necessarily a practice) cannot be libel. <a href="../../../b/a/t/User%7EBatmanand_01d3.html" title="User:Batmanand">Batmanand</a> 11:04, 14 January 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I know that the truth cannot be libellous (in the US), hence my reference to the importance of the truth above. However, as I pointed out in the AfD discussion, attempting to ascertain the 'truth' of a certain individual's sexual orientation, when that orientation is necessarily a thought, not an action, is an Orwellian minefield that I don't believe that Wikipedia should enter.</dd>

<p>Hi, one or both of the following situations applies to you, and you may therefore be interested in related discussions.</p>

<p>Hi - thanks for the message re closing out the AfD - that's good in a way; I had a horrible feeling that it was my responsibility to do it as the person who'd started the process in the first place. This whole admin thing is a bit pernicious in my view - they tend to carry themselves like school prefects: part goody two-shoes, part Nazi. I take great pride in having failed to be a school prefect, and will enjoy sitting at the back of the virtual classroom my grate frend peason cutting up my indiaruber under the desk and flicking bits at fotherington tomas chiz chiz.</p>
<p>anyway, thanks for letting me know. <a href="../../../e/l/e/User%7EElectricRay_93ad.html" title="User:ElectricRay">ElectricRay</a> 09:49, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks - I've not been directly troubled by one, but i've seen them behave pretty autocratically towards others. Not something (at this stage) I'm sufficiently moved to do something about.</p>
<p>The other thing that irks me somewhat about this site is the messianic reverence with which people hold <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimbo_Wales_1525.html" title="Jimbo Wales">Jimbo Wales</a>. If I had a penny for every time someone said "as Jimbo says..." I'd be a rich man. The point of Wikipedia is that it's open source and collaborative. Wales is - or ought to be - seen as no more than a prime mover in a process which has taken over its own life, no more significant than the first chemical reactions in the primordial soup which kicked off the evolutionary process. It's interesting that users who are <i>themselves</i> (perhaps unwittingly) by small incremental steps creating a virtual universe here still feel the need to have some ultimate arbiter/creator - descibed elsewhere as a "GodKing", a label I think will catch on) who's ultimately responsible, much as people do in real life with religion. It's a crutch, and eventually it will dissipate. I think someone could write a thesis on it. <a href="../../../e/l/e/User%7EElectricRay_93ad.html" title="User:ElectricRay">ElectricRay</a> 10:35, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

You read comfortably and fluidly--excellent work setting off the sample quotations! (And I also appreciated how you valiantly read through the external links at the end.)</p>
<p>On the technical side of production, it sounds like you might be a little close to your mic in this particular recording. Some of your <a href="../../../p/l/o/Plosive_consonant.html" title="Plosive consonant">plosives</a> (like "p"s and "b"s) are generating that "windy" noise sound. I can also hear a buzzy distortion that's common when the mic is picking up too much sound. If you're not terribly close to your mic, you could try turning down its volume so it's not so sensitive. Otherwise, try speaking slightly further away from it. If you're still having trouble with the p/b thing, you can try placing a simple screen between your mouth and the mic (you can make a simple but effective one by stretching pantyhose over a coathanger).</p>
<p>I hope this is helpful to you with future spoken articles. If you find it irritating or offensive, accept my apologies and delete it away. Otherwise, good job. I know that other Wikipedians appreciate your work on Spoken Wikipedia, too. All the best! <a href="../../../c/k/a/User%7ECkamaeleon_b2c2.html" title="User:Ckamaeleon">Ckamaeleon</a> 10:51, 22 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><br />
Well, i can repeat them:</p>
<p>According to <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>The neutral point of view is a means of dealing with conflicting views. The policy requires that, where there are or have been conflicting views, these are fairly presented, but <b>not asserted</b>. All significant points of view are presented, <b>not just the most popular one</b>. It is <b>not</b> asserted that the <b>most popular</b> view or some sort of intermediate view among the different views is the correct one. <b>Readers are left to form their own opinions</b>.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>So, basicly, it says that a POV that is "significantly" contested should not be presented as factual, no mater how popular it is.</p>
<p>Alright, now lets se what "significant" is:</p>
<ul>
<li>If a viewpoint is in the majority, then it should be easy to substantiate it with reference to commonly accepted reference texts;</li>
<li>If a viewpoint is held by a significant minority, then it should be easy to name prominent adherents;</li>
<li>If a viewpoint is held by an extremely small (or vastly limited) minority, it doesn't belong in Wikipedia (except perhaps in some ancillary article) regardless of whether it's true or not; and regardless of whether you can prove it or not.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, now we can se how to define three things:</p>
<ul>
<li>majority</li>
<li>significant minority</li>
<li>extremely small (or vastly limited) minority</li>
</ul>
<p>NPOV stats that if a view is contested by the third view, it can be disregarded:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Articles that compare views need not give minority views as much or as detailed a description as more popular views, and may not include tiny-minority views at all (by example, the article on the Earth only very briefly refers to the Flat Earth theory, a view of a distinct minority)</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>So, lets see what class the Bin Laden theory rejectors have:</p>
<p>As for point one:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>If a viewpoint is in the <b>majority</b>, then it should be easy to substantiate it with reference to <b>commonly accepted reference texts</b></i></dd>
</dl>
<p>So, lets see if we can do that:</p>
<p><i>"Believe news reports that <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arabs.html" title="Arabs">Arabs</a> carried out Sept. 11 attacks:</i></p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Total: True: 18%, Not true: 61%</i></dd>
<dd><i>Pakistan: True: 4%, <b>Not true: 86%</b></i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Source: <a href="../../../u/s/a/USAToday_f82e.html" title="USAToday">USAToday</a> <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/sept11/2002/02/27/usat-pollresults.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.usatoday.com/news/sept11/2002/02/27/usat-pollresults.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>
<p><a href="../../../u/s/a/USAToday_f82e.html" title="USAToday">USAToday</a> is a "commonly accepted reference texts", and suports that the Majority of the summ of the people in Lebanon, Turkey, Kuwait, Indonesia, Iran and Pakistan reject the Bin Laden theory.</p>
<p>However, in USA and Europe, in contrast to Asia, most people endorse the Bin Laden thoery.</p>
<p>But even in the USA, the are a "significant minority" that rejectst the Bin Laden theory. The criteria of being a "significant minority":</p>
<ul>
<li><i>If a viewpoint is held by a significant minority, then it should be easy to name prominent adherents;</i></li>
</ul>
<p>So, lets see if we can "<i>easly name prominent adhereants</i>":</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../s/9/2F/S9_11T_8864.html" title="S9/11T">S9/11T</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>No problem, that was easy</b>. Hence, in the USA <b>alone</b> there is a significant rejection of the Bin Laden theory.</p>
<p>Even if we dissregard all outher contries, the "significant minority" in the USA makes it ""significant conteseted", and hence, acording to <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, the Bin Laden theory is not to be presented as factual.</p>
<p>Add to it that the majority of the countries mentioned reject it, and you will come to the conclusion that it is a <b>major</b> breach of NPOV policy for a article to claim the Bin Laden theory is factual.</p>
<p>That is my arguement. Peace&#160;:) --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 15:42, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The moon landing and earth is flat theories are not comparable, they do not qualify as "significant minority", only as "extremely small (or vastly limited) minority". You can not find a people like the <a href="../../../s/9/2F/S9_11T_8864.html" title="S9/11T">S9/11T</a> asserting those two theories. You wont find a country with a majority aserting those theories, not even a a country with a "significant minority" asserting any of those two.</p>
<p>As for truth, that is where the whole issue is. Those people <b>do not</b> belive it to be true and are not convinced to the evidence supporting the Bin Laden theory.</p>
<p>It like Atheism and Theism. One belives in God, the other dosent. Wikipedia dosnt care for evidence, only for the issue being significantly disputed or not. If it is significantly disputed:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>It is <b>not</b> asserted that the <b>most popular</b> view or some sort of intermediate view among the different views is the correct one. <b>Readers are left to form their own opinions</b>.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>And by the way, i am familiar with the "evidence" for the Bin Laden theory, and i am not convinced of one single of them, in my view, there is not a single shread of evidence for the Bin Laden theory.</p>
<p>Dont take me wrong, im not saying that to start a argument regarding evidence, i am totaly unintrested in that. I only said that to show that the rejecters are equally convinced in their view. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 16:11, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
