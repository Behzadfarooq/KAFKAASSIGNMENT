<dd>It's not Wikipedia's place to "take seriously" anything. WP' place is to report objectively (NPOV) on all topics of concern to a general audience. The fact that people talk about her (for good or bad) means she's worth an article in WP. Now - this article (*any* article) shouldn't pass judgement on what's being discussed - it should merely report on what is being said by all sides of the issue in a fair and even handed manner. Present her arguments, and then note that there are thousands of people who think she's a crackpot for reasons a, b and c, without passing judgement yourself. 19:08, 22 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p><a href="../../../c/l/t/User%7ECltFn_aba7.html" title="User:CltFn">User:CltFn</a> keeps reverting my edits and labelling them "vandalism", but refuses to explain himself. I hope he will come to his senses and respond to the following. I happen to believe, as do most people who have heard of her, that Bat Ye'or (BY) is a full-blown racist and bigot, and I deeply dislike her writings. I find this page to be strongly biased towards her extreme prejudices against Muslims, both in that it presents her rantings more or less as accepted scientific theory, and in certain dubious phrases. This violates Wikipedia's NPOV policy - and that is why I feel I have the right to perform these edits; not because I dislike her. I have attempted to correct a few of the more blatant biases by these changes, and this is my argument:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Counter-terrorism.</b> The claim that BY is held in great esteem by the counter terrorism community (whatever that is), is not sourced, and I believe, most certainly not true. If this is to be included it should both be rephrased ("by some members of the CT community") and sourced.</li>
<li><b>Pioneering.</b> "Dhimmitude and Jihadist Tactics" are <i>not</i> accepted scientific terms. They are used exclusively by BY herself, and, in later years, by some of her followers. I accept her claim that she is an expert in this, since she invented the terms - but we should phrase ourselves to make this qualification clear. I have added the "what she terms as" (Dh-tude and Jtactics) to these sentences, which I believe is better in line with WP policy.</li>
<li><b>Jizya tax.</b> I rephrased the strongly POV paragraph on jizya/dhimmi, which referred to these religious taxes as extortion money. Granted, all taxes are extortion in one way or another, but this is not how WP generally refers to them, and it is not how the scientific community or popular history refers to the jizya. Also, not all "vanquished populations" were Christians and Jews; and the jizya was not paid on condition of halting Islam's further expansion, which the paragraph suggests ("cessation of the Jihad war").</li>
<li><b>"Eurabia" moved.</b> I moved the paragraph on "Eurabia" to the section on that term. This was not intended to correct bias, but rather to make the article more readable.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, I have made my case. I don't expect everyone to agree with me, although I think most people who compare the edits will see that these are clear improvements of the articles POV/NPOV status. But I do expect a response instead of just being reverted and insulted. <a href="../../../a/r/r/User%7EArre_fee4.html" title="User:Arre">Arre</a> 15:44, 17 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Your case in utter nonsense , you evidently have not even read any of her books and should not be editing this page out of a total lack of research. Your obvious agenda and POV pushing is clear.

<dl>
<dd><b>I'm sorry?</b> That was kind of unprovoked.
<ul>
<li>No, I have not read her books, but I'm not trying to edit the parts on the content of the books either. I've been concerned with the parts on her influence on the scientific and counter terrorism community.</li>
<li>If you refer to the part on the Jizya, then whatever her groundbreaking research is, it does not matter. It is <i>not common usage</i> to talk about taxes, including the Jizya, as "extortion". To do it here only, and in this context, is very obvious POV.</li>
<li>Also, please stop publicly labeling innocent people vandals. I don't know if you two have a previous history, but as it stands, I'm trying to discuss this, and so is Palmiro. Please respond to arguments, mine and his, instead of just reverting.</li>
<li>This is the fourth time I ask. Soon you've left me no choice but to call on the opinion of an administrator. As it stands, I don't think that would go in your favor.</li>

<dd>CltFn, you have added unsourced material and material attributed to a source which said something different. A hidden comment made it clear that this was the case and that was why it was commented out. Nevertheless you removed the comment and added the material and untrue claim regarding its source back in. I hope that you simply didn't look at what you were doing.</dd>
<dd>Please refer to three relevant Wikipedia policies, <a href="../../../c/i/v/Wikipedia%7ECivility_f107.html" title="Wikipedia:Civility">Wikipedia:Civility</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_personal_attacks_15ec.html" title="Wikipedia:No personal attacks">Wikipedia:No personal attacks</a> and <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECite_your_sources_2f5e.html" title="Wikipedia:Cite your sources">Wikipedia:Cite your sources</a>. Please do not add falsehoods to Wikipedia. If a comment says something is not true, and explains why fully, you should at least check before removing it and re-adding information that another editor has gone to the trouble of finding out is misleading.</dd>
<dd>Also, writing misleading edit summaries or using edit summaries for personal attacks is generally considered extremely poor form. <a href="../../../p/a/l/User%7EPalmiro_d72a.html" title="User:Palmiro">Palmiro</a> | <a href="../../../p/a/l/User_talk%7EPalmiro_7aea.html" title="User talk:Palmiro">Talk</a> 13:26, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I've read articles by Bat Ye'or, and I've read <i>about</i> Bat Ye'or. I would think the same goes for Palmiro. What we are disputing is - I repeat - not the content of her books, which should of course be presented accurately, factually and undistorted (but should not be allowed to become the general POV of the article). We <i>are</i> disputing erroneous and unfounded/unsourced claims of her influence on the scientific community and public discourse, plus some very biased sentences on Islam in general - I can judge those points as well as you.

<p>I don't exactly know what's going on here but, two things. Firstly, it does appear that this is totally disputed. Palmiro has given reasons... so, you can have content disputes but don't remove that without general agreement. Secondly... there is a revert war of sorts. I haven't read either version yet and I don't plan to as of yet. When I come back if you two are still reverting I will protect the page. Then I will give my opinion but I'd much prefer there wasn't still a revert war when I come back. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGrenavitar_5bda.html" title="User:Grenavitar">gren</a> <a href="../../../g/r/e/User_talk%7EGrenavitar_133f.html" title="User talk:Grenavitar">グレン</a> 16:02, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

Sadly, I believe this page should be protected right away and an administrator join the debate to mediate, otherwise there will only be more damage and confusion. In addition to his previous disputed edits and reverts, CltFn just went on a deletion-spree, and I have a feeling he is not going to stop acting like this unless forced to.

<dd>I see Dhimmi is back doing nothing but revert. I've removed that she's Jewish and has British nationality from the intro because they're arguably irrelevant, and anyway mentioned at the top of the next section. That she is Jewish explains why she was expelled from Egypt, but being a British national isn't at all relevant, and she's probably a Swiss national too, but we don't mention that. Also, there's no reason for having a single footnote there, when we can link to the article.

<dd>The NYT article is referred to twice, so it makes sense to have it as a footnote. Nationality is always relevant, any article about an author will mention the nationality in the first paragraph. I don't think she has Swiss nationality, she is typically described as a British citizen living in Switzerland. <a href="../../../d/h/i/User%7EDhimmi_b6a2.html" title="User:Dhimmi">Dhimmi</a> 23:02, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

This is a legitimate sock puppet, I'm not rigging votes or anything, I just wish to separate my edits on this article from my other edits. Your behaviour proves I was right in doing so. This is the kind of topic where one gets attacked by certain people. All I'm reverting is vandalism or other edits that degrade the article, like your removal of useful footnotes. Your version now repeats the same external link in three places, that's ridiculous.

<dd>You're being disruptive and you're not in fact allowed to use another account, or your primary one, with the sole intention of being a revert warrior. A footnote should be repeated too wherever the source is used to support an edit, so whether it's a footnote or a link makes no difference. Whoever you are, please read our editing policies. You know nothing about them yet you revert ANY change you do not approve of, which is completely out of order, and you label your edits rvv when you are not reverting vandalism.

<dd>I'm not disruptive at all. CtlFn was clearly vandalizing (removing whole paragraphs without explanation), as Arre and Palmiro will agree with. Instead of being thankful for my reverts of vandalism, you make up bizarre accusations. It's rather you who's disruptive. I know the editing policies better than you. Of course it makes a difference if it's just a footnote "ref nyt" that is repeated, or the whole URL! E.g., if one wants to change the URL to a better one, one would have to do it in three places separately with your version. You have quite some nerve to revert me and at the same time say "stop reverting". You have done this before, and it's not very convincing. <a href="../../../d/h/i/User%7EDhimmi_b6a2.html" title="User:Dhimmi">Dhimmi</a> 23:43, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Yes</b>, it seemed to me CltFn was vandalizing the article, or at least not editing it honestly. That was why I asked SlimVirgin to have a look at it. I have no idea if Dhimmi is disruptive or not, as I'm not able to keep up with the reverting, or figure out what it is about. I would say the best thing is for either side to stop reverting, no matter who started it, and then discuss this calmly. Right now, you both seem to be talking more about each other and the revertion policies, than about what content should be in the page.</li>
<li><b>The edits</b> I was originally concerned with (pioneering &amp; counterterror) are now both back, although with "citation needed" markers. I think it is obvious that they are not factual, and CltFn refuses to argue for them, even though I've asked him so many times now. I say both statements should be removed. <a href="../../../a/r/r/User%7EArre_fee4.html" title="User:Arre">Arre</a> 00:29, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Well "those fears" refers to what the author has listed in the earlier paragraphs. He then associates those fears with "the most extreme voices on the new Jewish right". The author however fails to then make explicit connection of Giselle Littman with "the most extreme voices on the new Jewish right". The reader can chose to or not to assume that this is what the author had intended to imply. If that was what the author had intended to get accross then he failed to do so explicitly and a conjecture that he had intended to do so cannot be the basis of a citation.--<a href="../../../c/l/t/User%7ECltFn_aba7.html" title="User:CltFn">CltFn</a> 07:39, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

The NYT <a href="http://64.233.183.104/search?q=cache:1z926m0S7lcJ:www.hacusa.org/NoticedInThePress/2005/EU_NYT_022005_Far_right.doc+%22Those+fears+shape+some+of+the+most+extreme+voices+on+the+new+Jewish+right.+Giselle+Littman&amp;hl=en" class="external text" title="http://64.233.183.104/search?q=cache:1z926m0S7lcJ:www.hacusa.org/NoticedInThePress/2005/EU_NYT_022005_Far_right.doc+%22Those+fears+shape+some+of+the+most+extreme+voices+on+the+new+Jewish+right.+Giselle+Littman&amp;hl=en" rel="nofollow">article</a> is unequivocal, the preceding paragraph refers explicitly to "<i>European Jews who fled their North African homes</i>". The ensuing paragraph's introduction "<i>Those fears shape some of the most extreme voices on the new Jewish right.</i>" is followed by just one example - Giselle Littman. The only way to make that even more obvious would be to replace the period by a colon. SlimVirgin calls that "<i>good writing. A form of show, don't tell</i>" - that's quite right.</p>
<p>CltFn, I agree with Yeor's inference, Europe doesn't handle the problems caused by muslim immigration adequately (*), but resorting to conspiracy theories as Y. does, won't help a bit.</p>
<p>* don't forget Europe's failure to integrate them. In Germany the weren't even offered language courses, much less were they made mandatory. French policy was to confine them to isolated and architecturally brutalising "banlieus" - no good idea. --<a href="../../../t/i/c/User%7ETickle_me_f9ac.html" title="User:Tickle me">tickle</a> <a href="../../../t/i/c/User_talk%7ETickle_me_c608.html" title="User talk:Tickle me">me</a> 14:35, 26 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Let me propose a compromise here. The intro says that the work of Bat Ye'or attracted both criticism and praise. However, while the NYT quote is an example of the former, we have no examples of the latter there, making the intro unbalanced. So, I have moved the NYT quote to a separate section titled "Criticism of Bat Ye'or", which could be expanded with other examples of criticism, if necessary.--Pecher 16:40, 26 December 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>First of all, I think creating "pro" and "con" sections in articles, while a common tactic on Wikipedia, is not necessarily a good idea. Secondly, it is quite germane that bat Ye'or is generally regarded as an extremist. I doubt that anyone could read one of her articles without thinking otherwise. A bland statement that "she has attracted both criticism and praise" doesn't really represent the matter faithfully. <a href="../../../p/a/l/User%7EPalmiro_d72a.html" title="User:Palmiro">Palmiro</a> | <a href="../../../p/a/l/User_talk%7EPalmiro_7aea.html" title="User talk:Palmiro">Talk</a> 17:21, 26 December 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>If you believe that creatng a criticism section is not a good idea in this case, I would appreciate if you elaborate on your position. There are many people who read her works, including books, without coming to a conclusion that she is an extremist, and the article must conform to NPOV. Although the statement is indeed bland, it may be reworded to reflect the fact that she has a large following and her works have sparked a substantial controversy, and we need not tilt the intro on one side.--Pecher 17:49, 26 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As far as I can work out, what Bat Ye'or means by the EAD is in fact the Barcelona process. So, yes, there is this dialogue, but no, of course there is no evidence to support her insane theses about it.

<dd>This is an article by one Sidney Griffiths of the <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catholic_University_of_America_4593.html" title="Catholic University of America">Catholic University of America</a>. Fr. Sidney Griffiths is a professor of Semitic and Egyptian Languages and Literatures, with special interest in "Syriac monasticism; medieval Christian-Muslim encounters; ecumenical and interfaith dialogue" so it is interesting that in relation to this, he does indeed use the term "dhimmitude". And he also has the following to say about Bat Ye'or, where he cites her in his references:
<dl>
<dd>Also easily available is Bat Ye̓or, The Decline of Eastern Christianity under Islam; from Jihad to Dhimmitude; Seventh-Twentieth Century (Madison &amp; Teaneck, NJ: Fairleigh Dickinson University Press, 1996). One must use this book with great care due to the author̓s extreme anti-Islamic prejudice and consequent distortion of the facts of history, both Christian and Islamic. Nevertheless, the quoted sources do provide some sense, albeit highly distorted by reason of selective quotation, of the difficulties experienced by Christians over the centuries living under Islamic rule. The book gave rise to some surprisingly bigoted remarks by Richard John Neuhaus, “The Public Square; the Approaching Century of Religion,” First Things no. 76 (October, 1997), pp. 75-79. There are similar problems with Bat Ye̓or, The Dhimmi: Jews and Christians under Islam (Rutherford, Madison, &amp; Teaneck, NJ: Fairleigh Dickinson University Press, 1985) and with Bat Ye̓or, Islam and Dhimmitude; Where Civilizations Collide (Madison &amp; Teaneck, NJ: Fairleigh Dickinson University Press, 2002). It remains to Bat Ye̓or̓s credit to have raised an important issue that still has not received adequate study.</dd>

People like Ibn Warraq are published by Prometheus which is suspect just because it only has more anti-Islamic leaning texts. I don't know if Fairleigh Dickinson is the most notable or well respected text... but I'd assume it deserves some respect. The undergraduate course that uses it also uses a book by Annemarie Schimmel who is definitely not along the same lines as Bat Yeor. So, we can't really know if it's used with a grain of salt or not.

No one is trying to make these fields into academic subjects, we are simply describing the focus of her writings and public presentations on those topics.

<dd>That's precisely the problem. "Dhimmitude" is NOT an "area of thought, research, or development", it's a made-up word for Muslim-bashing. I don't know if you're familiar with the history of anti-Semitism, but this is like saying in the 1880s that Wilhelm Marr was a "pioneer of the study of anti-Semitism and Jewish usury". <b>Yes</b>, he was, in the sense that he invented the term to cover for traditional anti-Judaism. And <b>no</b>, he wasn't, in the sense that it was not a respected or established "study" at all. It's perfectly fine to mention that he invented the word, and what he meant by it, and to present that in neutral, descriptive terms - just as it would be to explain that B/Y "uses the term Dhimmitude as a scientific concept", bla bla. This is not done now. Instead you're insisting on a weasel sentence to lend academic credentials and respectability to something which is basically just another Internet buzz, and a particularly silly one at that. <a href="../../../a/r/r/User%7EArre_fee4.html" title="User:Arre">Arre</a> 02:02, 15 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Let's cool down a little bit here and start with defining what Bat Ye'or calls "dhimmitude", as the article does not have a clear definition now. She writes "<i>Dhimmitude ... represents a domain, which embraces the social, political, and religious relations of different human groups</i> [i.e., between dhimmis and Muslims, as well as between groups of dhimmis - Pecher] (<i>Islam and Dhimmitude...</i>, p.21). I do not think Bat Ye'or really pioneered the study of both these types of relations; there had already been literature on Jews and Christians under Muslim rule, see for instance, <i>The Jews of Islam</i> by Bernard Lewis, as well as non-specialized books devoted to the history of Islam. Anyway, a claim of pioneering must be sourced; otherwise, it will violate <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>. However, she did make an impressive study of Arab-Christian anti-Judaism, and that may be mentioned.--Pecher 19:58, 15 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>A few points here: 1) Bat Ye'or is hardly the first historian to study the history of religious minorities in Islamic lands. 2) Bat Ye'or didn't coin the neologism "dhimmitude." 3) The only thing different (not innovative) she did was frame the history from a clearly biased and ideologically-driven lens. 4) Most academic reviews of her books confirm #3 and seriously question her scholarship. These reviews are accessible through university and public library databases.</dd>
<dd>In light of all this, Bat Ye'or hasn't really "pioneered" anything related to this field of history.--<a href="../../../k/i/t/User%7EKitrus_ba8b.html" title="User:Kitrus">Kitrus</a> 07:11, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
