<p>Since the earliest known written reference to the tapestry in a 1476 inventory of <a href="../../../../fr/c/a/t/Cath%C3%A9drale_Notre-Dame_de_Bayeux_bf59.html" class="extiw" title="fr:Cathédrale_Notre-Dame_de_Bayeux">Bayeux Cathedral</a>, its origins have been the subject of much speculation and controversy.</p>
<p>In France, traditional legend said that the tapestry was commissioned and created by <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matilda_of_Flanders_7a65.html" title="Matilda of Flanders">Queen Matilda</a>, <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_I_of_England_322d.html" title="William I of England">William the Conqueror's</a> wife, and her ladies. Indeed, in France it is occasionally known as "La Tapisserie de la Reine Mathilde" (Tapestry of Queen Matilda). However, recent scholarly analysis in the 20th century shows it probably was commissioned by William the Conqueror's half brother, <a href="../../../o/d/o/Odo_of_Bayeux_90f9.html" title="Odo of Bayeux">Bishop Odo</a>. The reasons for the Odo commission theory include: three of the bishop's followers mentioned in <a href="../../../d/o/m/Domesday_Book_b82d.html" title="Domesday Book">Domesday Book</a> appear on the tapestry; it was found in Bayeux Cathedral, built by Odo; it may have been commissioned at the same time as the cathedral's construction in the 1070s, possibly completed by 1077 in time for display on the cathedral's dedication.</p>
<p>Assuming Bishop Odo commissioned the tapestry, it was probably designed and constructed in <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a> by <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglo-Saxon_art_ddf7.html" title="Anglo-Saxon art">Anglo-Saxon artists</a> given that: Odo's main power base was in <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kent.html" title="Kent">Kent</a>, the Latin text contains hints of Anglo Saxon, other embroideries originate from England at this time, and the vegetable dyes can be found in cloth traditionally woven there.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> Assuming this was the case, the actual physical work of stitching was most likely undertaken by skilled seamsters or seamstresses. <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglo-Saxon_art_ddf7.html" title="Anglo-Saxon art">Anglo-Saxon</a> needlework, or <a href="../../../o/p/u/Opus_Anglicanum_91d0.html" title="Opus Anglicanum">Opus Anglicanum</a> was famous across Europe.</p>
<p>One other candidate, recently put forward by the art historian Carola Hicks, is <a href="../../../e/d/i/Edith_of_Wessex_8084.html" title="Edith of Wessex">Edith of Wessex</a>.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>

<p>The tapestry was rediscovered in the late <a href="../../../1/7/t/17th_century.html" title="17th century">17th century</a> in Bayeux (where it had been traditionally displayed once a year at the Feast of the Relics), and engravings of it were published in the <a href="../../../1/7/3/1730s.html" title="1730s">1730s</a> by Bernard de Montfaucon. Later, some from Bayeux who were fighting for the Republic wanted to use it as a cloth to cover an ammunition wagon, but luckily a lawyer who understood its importance saved it and replaced it with another cloth. In 1803, <a href="../../../n/a/p/Napoleon.html" title="Napoleon">Napoleon</a> seized it and transported it to <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paris.html" title="Paris">Paris</a>. Napoleon wanted to use the tapestry as inspiration for his planned attack on England. When this plan was cancelled, the tapestry was returned to Bayeux. The townspeople wound the tapestry up and stored it like a scroll. (Crack 1) After being seized by the <a href="../../../a/h/n/Ahnenerbe.html" title="Ahnenerbe">Ahnenerbe</a>, the tapestry spent much of <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a> in the basement of the <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louvre.html" title="Louvre">Louvre</a>. (Setton, 209) It is now protected on display in a museum in a dark room with special lighting behind sealed glass in order to minimize damage from light and air.</p>

<p>The main character of the tapestry is William the Conqueror. William was the <a href="../../../i/l/l/Illegitimate.html" title="Illegitimate">illegitimate</a> son of <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_the_Magnificent_55b6.html" title="Robert the Magnificent">Robert the Magnificent</a>, Duke of Normandy, and <a href="../../../h/e/r/Herleva.html" title="Herleva">Herleva</a>, a <a href="../../../t/a/n/Tanner_%28occupation%29.html" title="Tanner (occupation)">tanner</a>'s daughter. She was married off to another man and bore two sons, one of which was the Bishop Odo. When Duke Robert was returning from a <a href="../../../p/i/l/Pilgrimage.html" title="Pilgrimage">pilgrimage</a> to <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jerusalem.html" title="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>, he was killed. William gained his father's title at a very young age and was a proven warrior at 19. He prevailed in the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Hastings_16cc.html" title="Battle of Hastings">Battle of Hastings</a> in 1066 and captured the crown at 38. William knew little peace in his life. He was always doing battle putting down rebel vassals or going to war with France. The king was married to Matilda of Flanders; they were distant cousins. (Barclay 31) William was 1.78 m (5 ft 10 in). Matilda was 1.27 m (4 ft 2 in), so they made an interesting couple.</p>
<p>The tapestry begins with a panel of King <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_the_Confessor_499b.html" title="Edward the Confessor">Edward the Confessor</a>, who has no heir. Edward decides to send <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harold_Godwinson_e9f3.html" title="Harold Godwinson">Harold Godwinson</a>, the most powerful <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earl.html" title="Earl">earl</a> in England to his cousin William of Normandy to tell William he has been selected as the next King of England. As Harold is in transit across the <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_Channel_c0e5.html" title="English Channel">channel</a>, he is caught in a storm and sent off course. Harold is taken prisoner by Guy, Count of Ponthieu. William sends two messengers to demand his release, and Count Guy of Ponthieu quickly releases him to William. William, perhaps to impress Harold, invites him to come on a campaign against <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conan_II%2C_Duke_of_Brittany_a611.html" title="Conan II, Duke of Brittany">Conan II, Duke of Brittany</a>. On the way, just outside the famous monastery of <a href="../../../m/o/n/Mont_St._Michel_09e7.html" title="Mont St. Michel">Mont St. Michel</a>, two soldiers become mired in quicksand, and Harold saves the two Norman soldiers. William's army chases Conan from <a href="../../../d/o/l/Dol_de_Bretagne_8926.html" title="Dol de Bretagne">Dol de Bretagne</a> to <a href="../../../r/e/n/Rennes.html" title="Rennes">Rennes</a>, and he finally surrenders at <a href="../../../d/i/n/Dinan.html" title="Dinan">Dinan</a>. William gives Harold arms and armour (possibly <a href="../../../k/n/i/Knight.html" title="Knight">knighting</a> him) and Harold pledges on <a href="../../../s/a/i/Saint.html" title="Saint">saintly</a> <a href="../../../r/e/l/Relic.html" title="Relic">relics</a> to support William in securing the English throne. Harold leaves for home and meets again with the old king Edward. Edward dies, and Harold is proclaimed King.</p>
<p>Some months later a star with hair appears: <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comet_Halley_dc36.html" title="Comet Halley">Halley's Comet</a>. The first appearance of the comet would have been 24 April, nearly four months after Harold's coronation. Comets, in the beliefs of the <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middle_Ages_99b9.html" title="Middle Ages">Middle Ages</a>, warned of impending doom. A fleet of empty ships appears. On the other side of the channel in France, William hears that he has been betrayed and vows to take England. William builds a fleet of ships, but cannot cross because of strong opposing winds. They are able to move down the coast a bit, and then eventually, in a D-day invasion in reverse, head across the channel. The Norman invasion force consisted of approximately 7,000 men. The invaders reach England, and land unopposed. William orders his men to pillage. Harold at this point was involved in a battle with another contender for the throne of England, the <a href="../../../n/o/r/Norway.html" title="Norway">Norwegian</a> <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harald_III_of_Norway_5db6.html" title="Harald III of Norway">Harald Hardraada</a>, whom he defeated. Harald Hardraada led the last <a href="../../../v/i/k/Viking.html" title="Viking">Viking</a> invasion of England and was known as great warrior. However, Hardraada's involvement is not mentioned at all on the Tapestry. The Normans build a <a href="../../../m/o/t/Motte_and_bailey.html" title="Motte and bailey">motte and bailey</a> to defend their position. Some homesteads are torched. William prepares for battle when he hears that Harold is coming.</p>
<p>Finally, the famous day dawns: <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_14.html" title="October 14">October 14</a>, <a href="../../../1/0/6/1066.html" title="1066">1066</a>. The <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Hastings_16cc.html" title="Battle of Hastings">Battle of Hastings</a> took place 105 km (65 mi) from London. Harold forced his troops to march the distance in just three days, (from <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stamford_Bridge%2C_East_Riding_of_Yorkshire_d9a5.html" title="Stamford Bridge, East Riding of Yorkshire">Stamford Bridge, (Yorkshire)</a> where the battle against Harald Hardrade had taken place), which further exhausted his troops. Both armies were evenly matched. When they clash in battle, the bowmen advance to about 100 yards and loose, but to little effect as the English soldiers have established an effective shield-wall. So the knights charge into battle. Soon the Normans fall back in retreat, and some of Harold's men defy orders and follow them. Harold wanted them to stand fast for defense. William's horse is killed in the battle and a rumour goes through the ranks he is dead. He removes his helmet and says, "Look at me well! I am still alive and by the grace of God shall still prove the victor!" As the day goes on, the English begin to lose strength. Harold is killed, according to legend, with a Norman arrow to the eye. After their leader dies, the English flee and the Normans are victorious.</p>

<p>Although events after the battle are not portrayed, we may complete the story here. William was crowned king of England on Christmas day by Archbishop Ealdred of York. Matilda was crowned 17 months later. After capturing London, William returned to Normandy, and then came back to continue subduing the people of England. He got no rest as king, always battling. William even imprisoned Odo in 1082. William bled to death while campaigning when his horse stumbled and threw him against his saddle. As he was greatly overweight, it caused a fatal rupture.</p>

Harold's death?</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The tapestry contains several mysteries:</p>
<ul>
<li>There is a panel with what appears to be a <a href="../../../c/l/e/Clergy.html" title="Clergy">clergyman</a> striking a woman. No one knows the meaning of the inscription above this scene. Historians speculate that it may represent a well known scandal of the day that needed no explanation. (Setton 125)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>At least two panels of the tapestry are missing, perhaps even another 6.4 m (7 yards) worth. This missing area would probably include William’s coronation. Jan Messent, a modern artist, has attempted a reconstruction. <a href="http://www.madeira.co.uk/bayeux.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.madeira.co.uk/bayeux.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The identity of <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harold_Godwinson_e9f3.html" title="Harold Godwinson">Harold II of England</a> in the vignette depicting his death is disputed. Some recent historians disagree with the traditional view that Harold II is the figure struck in the eye with an arrow. The view that it is Harold is supported by the fact that the words <i>Harold Rex</i> (King Harold) appear right above the figure's head. However, the arrow may have been a later addition following a period of repair. Evidence of this can be found in a comparison with engravings of the tapestry in <a href="../../../1/7/2/1729.html" title="1729">1729</a> by <a href="../../../b/e/r/Bernard_de_Montfaucon_7ddd.html" title="Bernard de Montfaucon">Bernard de Montfaucon</a>, in which the arrow is absent. A figure is slain with a sword in the subsequent plate and the phrase above the figure refers to Harold's death (<i>Interfectus est</i>, "he is killed"). This would appear to be more consistent with the labeling used elsewhere in the work. However, needle holes in the linen suggest that, at one time, this second figure was also shown to have had an arrow in his eye. It was common medieval <a href="../../../i/c/o/Iconography.html" title="Iconography">iconography</a> (symbolism) that a perjurer was to die with a weapon through the eye. So, the tapestry might be said to emphasis William's rightful claim to the throne by depicting Harold as an oath breaker. Whether he actually died in this way remains a mystery and much debated.</li>

<p>While political propaganda or personal emphasis may have somewhat distorted the historical accuracy of the story, the Bayeux tapestry presents a unique visual document of medieval arms, apparel, and other objects unlike any other artifact surviving from this period. However, it has been noted that the warriors are depicted fighting with bare hands, while other sources indicate the general use of <a href="../../../g/l/o/Glove.html" title="Glove">gloves</a> in battle and hunt.</p>
<p>Also, the tapestry shows Harold enthroned with <a href="../../../s/t/i/Stigand.html" title="Stigand">Stigand</a>, the Archbishop of Canterbury, beside him, as though he has been crowned by him. Harold was actually crowned by Aldred of York, more than likely because Stigand, who received his place by self-promotion, was considered corrupt. The tapestry is trying to show a connection between Harold and the bishop, making his claim to the throne even weaker.</p>
