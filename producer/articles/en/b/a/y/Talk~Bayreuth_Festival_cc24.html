<p>In fact, the Bayreuth Theatre during WWII illustrates the <a href="../../../s/o/c/Socialist.html" title="Socialist">Socialist</a> aspect of Nazism. For the first time since it's founding common slobs, working class, poor folks, the less privieldges, or whatever name you wanna give to it, could afford tickets, because the theatre operated with a direct government subsidy on Hitler's orders. <a href="../../../n/o/b/User%7ENobs01_a89e.html" title="User:Nobs01">nobs</a> 19:10, 14 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>That's true, but most of those people did not want to attend it and found opera to be a bore. They were forced to attend as Hitler's guests (see my additions to article). <a href="../../../d/t/a/User%7EDtaw2001_234d.html" title="User:Dtaw2001">Dtaw2001</a> 15:08, 7 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Those additions are very good &amp; well written; let me express one reservation. The "Nazi era" is now somewhat disproportionate to the size of the article. I suspect this can only be balanced by improving the earlier and later sections, which I'm looking to forward to. Thanks. <a href="../../../n/o/b/User%7ENobs01_a89e.html" title="User:Nobs01">nobs</a> 15:35, 7 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Agreed. I will try to add more to other sections when I can, although much of it is covered in other articles pertaining to the characters involved in Bayreuth.<a href="../../../d/t/a/User%7EDtaw2001_234d.html" title="User:Dtaw2001">Dtaw2001</a> 16:33, 7 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Here's an idea: structure the article along the lines of Directorship, beginning with
<ul>
<li>Richard Wagner era</li>
<li>Cosima Wagner era</li>
<li>Siegried Wagner era</li>
<li>Winifred Wagner era</li>
<li>Wieland Wanger era</li>
<li>Wolfgand Wanger era</li>
<li>The future</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>Hence, all the Nazi crap will fall under Winifred, and be less obrtrusive. <a href="../../../n/o/b/User%7ENobs01_a89e.html" title="User:Nobs01">nobs</a> 16:59, 7 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello, interesting discussion. I authored the article on Wolfgang Wagner and moved some material that had been here to the separate entry on the <a href="../../../f/e/s/Festspielhaus.html" title="Festspielhaus">Festspielhaus</a>. I mention this because I think it's important to ensure that the content on this page remains centred on the actual festival, and not get bogged down into subsidiary details. Notable conductors and productions, for example, could be mentioned with some justfication. Also, a note on the above suggestion: Wolfgang and his brother Wieland ran the festival together, so they would not have separate eras. I think a postwar/reconstruction era could be more apt. <a href="../../../d/o/t/User%7EDottoreso_44ff.html" title="User:Dottoreso">Dottore So</a> 18:09, 7 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I added some detail to balance out the article with the Nazi section. I also moved some material from the Wagner article, which is already too long, and which is more appropriate in this article. Finally, I think we need more detail on the Siegfried Wagner era and the Post-War period. Also, some modern photos would be nice, perhaps a screenshot from a Bayreuth Festival DVD under the "fair use" category.<a href="../../../d/t/a/User%7EDtaw2001_234d.html" title="User:Dtaw2001">Dtaw2001</a> 20:15, 7 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have made a large number of changes and additions over the past few days. I think the article is almost complete. Any suggestions?

<dd>The decision to replace Wolfgang Wagner with his daughter, Eva-Pasquier Wagner, as Theatre Director appears to be taking place this fall (now). Nike Wagner, her cousin and only other candidate, will continue productions elsewhere. <a href="../../../n/o/b/User%7ENobs01_a89e.html" title="User:Nobs01">nobs</a> 18:47, 11 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Is that official? If so it should be noted here and at <a href="../../../w/o/l/Wolfgang_Wagner_685b.html" title="Wolfgang Wagner">Wolfgang Wagner</a>. Btw, as it now stands, I think this article could be up put for Featured Article status.

<dd>Article looks very good in my opinion. Important procedural note: I have removed the FA tag for the moment since the article needs to go through peer review prior to being submitted. I have asked for comments from the peer review page as well. Please feel free to reinstate the fac if you wish, but I think procedure usually dictates review prior to submission to the featured article level. The FAC entry should be temporarily withdrawn.</dd>

<dd>Dettore, since you wrote the Wolfgang Wagner article, I assume you are well versed in the subject matter. So why don't you peer review the article? <a href="../../../d/t/a/User%7EDtaw2001_234d.html" title="User:Dtaw2001">Dtaw2001</a> 17:51, 13 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><s>I will be happy to provide some commentary, although as you can tell from my above remarks I am impressed as it is. However, the peer review is essentially a procedural formality. Would you consider striking the FAC until we have accumulated feedback from peer review? I have added the p.r. request to the FAC entry, but removing it for the time being from list might be easiest pending comment.</s> Oops - per comment left at peer review, request, my understanding of procedureis faulty. So I have reinstated the fac and scratched my comment there.

<p>Not everyone agreed that the festival was artistically an "outstanding success." In contrast to Tchaikovsky, George Bernard Shaw, who attended some of Bayreuth’s earliest performances had this to say:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Those who go to Bayreuth never repent it, although the performances there are often far from delectable. The singing is sometimes tolerable, and some times abominable. Some of the singers are mere animated beer casks, too lazy and conceited to practise the self-control and physical training that is expected as a matter of course from an acrobat, a jockey or a pugilist. The women's dresses are prudish and absurd…Further, whilst Wagner's stage directions are sometimes disregarded as unintelligently as at Covent Garden, an intolerably old-fashioned tradition of half rhetorical, half historical-pictorial attitude and gesture prevails. The most striking moments of the drama are conceived as tableaux vivants with posed models, instead of as passages of action, motion and life.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I need hardly add that the supernatural powers of control attributed by credulous pilgrims to Madame Wagner do not exist. Prima donnas and tenors are as unmanageable at Bayreuth as anywhere else. Casts are capriciously changed; stage business is insufficiently rehearsed; the public are compelled to listen to a Brynhild or Siegfried of fifty when they have carefully arranged to see one of twenty-five, much as in any ordinary opera house. Even the conductors upset the arrangements occasionally.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, this refers to what was often called the "Bayreuth style", of rigid poses, actors pacing methodically and stand absolutely still, a very "stiff" production. And it is associated with the theatre under <a href="../../../c/o/s/Cosima_Wagner_6f81.html" title="Cosima Wagner">Cosima Wagner</a>'s direction, after Richard death. It is regarded as her attempt to preserve in as close a manner possible Wagner's direction and staging, and not allowing actors to improvise, modify, or take over the staging. This existed for many years, and was only somewhat modified during Siegfried Wagner's short stint as director, and Winifred's (really Tietjen's productions) are often refered to as some of the best. It is the "New Bayreuth" were the style really associated with Cosima disappeared completely. <a href="../../../n/o/b/User%7ENobs01_a89e.html" title="User:Nobs01">nobs</a> 03:50, 12 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm sorry I forgot to sign in before editing the article, but here's what I've done. The article says: <i>Although the festival was plagued by financial problems in its early years, it survived through state intervention and the continued support of influential Wagnerians, including King Ludwig II of Bavaria and Adolf Hitler.</i></p>
<p>I deleted <i>Hitler</i> because we are talking of THE EARLY YEARS of the Festival, Hitler came almost 60 years after 1876, when Bayreuth was already well established. Adding his name <i>at this point</i> seems to me a bit gratuitous (if not malicious). --<a href="../../../m/o/l/User%7EMoloch981_9a27.html" title="User:Moloch981">Moloch981</a> 22:48, 21 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Point well taken. There was certainly no malicious intent, only that this sentence was written when the article was very short and not broken into several sections. Therefore, it was not originally under the Early History section, but as part of the general history. When later sections were added and expanded, this sentence was simply overlooked. (see version 02:05, 7 November 2005). <a href="../../../d/t/a/User%7EDtaw2001_234d.html" title="User:Dtaw2001">Dtaw2001</a> 15:58, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The article states that Levi was "personally chosen by Wagner". I'd like to see a citation for this. was it not the case that, as the chief conductor of the munich opera he was chosen by King Ludwig, who owned the rights to Parsifal and who bankrolled the first festivals? My understanding was that, far from being chosen by Wagner, Wagner objected to Levi and tried to have him removed - because he was jewish - and that only once Ludwig dug his heels in did Wagner agree to Levi as the conductor for Parsifal.
