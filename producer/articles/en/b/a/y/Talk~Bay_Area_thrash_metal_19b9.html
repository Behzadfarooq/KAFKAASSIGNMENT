<p>If you look at the heavy metal genre template, there is a section below titled "Regional Genres", all 3 of which are a large progenity and early carnation of Heavy Metal music. Bay Area thrash metal is indeed one of them, and every websource will confirm that. If you check the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Leyasu_aa77.html" title="Special:Contributions/Leyasu">history</a> of the person who made the suggestion, you will notice this user has added pointless AFD/Merge tags to other heavy metal articles. (Not surprisingly, votes from everyone are overwhelmingly not in favor of their proposal.) In addition, the user is including <b>unsourced</b> and <b>unverified claims</b> in various Wikipedia articles (<a href="../../../s/y/m/Symphonic_Metal_dd70.html" title="Symphonic Metal">1</a> 2), a <b>most blatant</b> defiance of the site policy <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECite_sources_8023.html" title="Wikipedia:Cite sources">Wikipedia:Cite sources</a> . --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanteferno_ab29.html" title="User:Danteferno">Danteferno</a> 23:01 7 December (UTC)</p>
<p>I reference people to the fact Dante has 'Meglomanic Point of View' and suffers from 'Possesion of Articles' syndrome. The reason for merging, if Dante would of cared to ask (which he never does), is that this article is three paragraphs long, that would be much better menitoned in the Thrash Metal article, and would add greatly to BOTH articles. Which is the reason for most merges. <a href="../../../l/e/y/User%7ELeyasu_40c4.html" title="User:Leyasu">Leyasu</a> 00:06, 8 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> There has been discussion about this before in the pass, but it seems that the attitudes towards regional genres of thrash metal has changed since it was last proposed. See the <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_review_Log_2006_July_21_904e.html#Teutonic_thrash" title="Wikipedia:Deletion review/Log/2006 July 21">deletion removal comments</a> for the other popular regional genre for <a href="../../../t/h/r/Thrash_metal.html" title="Thrash metal">thrash metal</a>. I propose that this ought to be merge rather then deleted since it is an important genre for the thrash metal scene. --<a href="../../../p/i/n/User%7EPinkkeith_2966.html" title="User:Pinkkeith">Pinkkeith</a> 12:08, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I vote against the merge. The article does need cleanup and expansion, but there are more than enough bands to constitute a "scene" worth of an article, plus the term "Bay Area Thrash" is a well known worldwide, and was commonly used to describe the scene in magazine articles, ect. <a href="../../../s/k/e/User%7ESkeletor2112_e088.html" title="User:Skeletor2112">Skeletor2112</a> 07:47, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I would agree with you, but it seems that others don't see it that way with teutonic thrash which was just as popular and know world wide as the Bay Area Thrash scene. I am just looking for some consistency between the two very popular thrash metal scenes. --<a href="../../../p/i/n/User%7EPinkkeith_2966.html" title="User:Pinkkeith">Pinkkeith</a> 17:23, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The problem as I see it is that there these kind of articles tend to be very short, with a one-paragraph description and a bandlist that keeps getting added to and removed from. So imo, a better approach is to add these paragraphs to a parent article (<a href="../../../t/h/r/Thrash_metal.html" title="Thrash metal">thrash metal</a> in this case) and if the particular section bulges out of its parent turn it into a separate article, keeping a summary in the parent along with a link. Another point is that most of the main metal-genre (such as death metal, black metal, etc - thrash metal is actaully one of the better ones) articles are terribly written, biased and overlooking a lot of important bands and albums. Now Bay Area thrash is a notable scene which has more or less become synonymous with thrash. Articles like new york thrash metal, teutonic thrash metal are less important and too restrictive. (NYTM, for example includes a major band being from New Jersey) Teutonic is even worse. Half the bands Pinkkeit mentioned aren't German (in several places), whereas the scene was labelled german (More properly I guess Teutonic refers to the middle-ages Germanic tribes and not to Germany and hence to most of northern/western Europe). Moreover in Europe there were many more important thrash metal bands, like Sabbat, Onslaught (UK), Coronor (Switzerland), Massacra, Agressor (France), Artillery (denmark), LWS, Thanatos, Pestilence (netherlands).

<dd>You are right, teutonic does not just include the present day nation of Germany. That's why I thought it would be misleading to call it German thrash metal. Bands that come from Switzerland, Denmark and the Netherlands are considered to be part of the teutonic thrash movement. I think you have some bias in thinking that "Bay Area thrash is synonymous with thrash." There are many music critics and historians who think that there are two areas that are important in the thrash metal: Bay Area and Teutonic. --<a href="../../../p/i/n/User%7EPinkkeith_2966.html" title="User:Pinkkeith">Pinkkeith</a> 15:39, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm not biased towards bay area thrash. But I suspect that if you ask a couple of random metalheads to name a few important thrash bands they come up with bands like exodus, testament, metallica, slayer. Also note that Teuton is not a region. A better term would probably be west-european thrash or something along these lines. Spearhead 16:10, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If you are not <a href="../../../b/i/a/Bias.html" title="Bias">biased</a>, which I believe you are, you are <a href="../../../i/g/n/Ignorance.html" title="Ignorance">ignorant</a>. Just because you ask a few people you know to name some thrash metal bands and they mention the ones you like done'st mean that they are important or unimportant. You have to look at what the general population and the musical critics and musical historians believe are important bands and trends rather then just a group of "random metalheads." Since thrash metal was most popular during the mid to late 80s, there isn't much out there on the world wide web about it. These are the few I could find: <a href="http://www.hardradio.com/history/part4.html" class="external text" title="http://www.hardradio.com/history/part4.html" rel="nofollow">Hard History</a> <a href="http://www.metal-reviews.com/tgos/042303.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.metal-reviews.com/tgos/042303.htm" rel="nofollow">Returning To The Roots: Thrash Metal</a>. I don't know if you remember or followed the thrash metal scene then, but during the mid to late 80s teutonic thrash scene was mentioned and talked about. To call this anything other then teutonic trash would be ignorant of the history, because that's what the critics called it, and the fans and bands adopted. --<a href="../../../p/i/n/User%7EPinkkeith_2966.html" title="User:Pinkkeith">Pinkkeith</a> 13:24, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I'd just like to butt in and add that I've been a die hard thrash fan since 1989, and until coming here in 2006, I had never heard of the term "Teutonic Thrash". It must be more of a European term, becasue growing up in the US, bands like Sodom and Kreator were considered just plain old "thrash metal". We used "Bay Area Thrash" to define a <i>scene</i>, not a genre. <a href="../../../s/k/e/User%7ESkeletor2112_e088.html" title="User:Skeletor2112">Skeletor2112</a> 04:43, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I started to be come interested in thrash metal in 1984 when I discovered Anthrax. I discovered Kreator in about 1985. Thrash metal use to be big back then and there were many magazines about thrash metal. I can remember picking up some at the local grocery store, now they are hard to find. I have to admit that I did start to become less of a fan of metal around 1993 or so. I still loved the music, I just wasn't just listening to thrash metal. I also agree with Skeletor that teutonic thrash would be more of a scene then a genre. I know I do use the words interchangably, which is incorrect of me. Also, I have no idea about the origins of the term "teutonic thrash." I don't know who coined it or even where I first read it. --<a href="../../../p/i/n/User%7EPinkkeith_2966.html" title="User:Pinkkeith">Pinkkeith</a> 14:11, 27 July 2006 (UTC) Ed.

<p>This must be one of the worst-written article on WP. It only has a summary and a conclusion. And is more about other genres (such death metal, groove metal) than thrash. The first section seems to be totally biased towards metallica. Spearhead 16:14, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Bullocks, this is perhaps the most telling article on a seminal music scene that Wikipedia has to offer. As others have stated, the Bay Area Thrash scene (which was partly pioneered by <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metallica.html" title="Metallica">Metallica</a>) has been strongly reputable in shaping the overall thrash metal genre and the article also explains how it lead to the creation of other subgenres (groove, death metal, etc). There is no "biasness" towards Metallica in any direction. Unless there is a more explanatory grievance, I'm removing the tags. They're only stagnating the article, not improving it.--<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanteferno_ab29.html" title="User:Danteferno">Danteferno</a> 00:58, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Due to no significant discussion I removed the tags. There has been no talk on this for nearly two months, and also no follow-up to my message dated 07/26/06, 00:58. If there's anything the article needs, its probably some cited references, which can be provided, but there's absolutely no problem with neutrality. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanteferno_ab29.html" title="User:Danteferno">Danteferno</a> 14:04, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
