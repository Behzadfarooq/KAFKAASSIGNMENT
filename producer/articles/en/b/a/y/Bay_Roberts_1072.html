<p>Bay Roberts offers year round shipping services through its large port, which is similar in size to the harbour in <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._John%27s%2C_Newfoundland_and_Labrador_2caf.html" title="St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador">St. John's</a> and can accommodate the largest of ships. It is protected from ocean storms by Fergus Island at its entrance. The bay and harbour have clear shorelines, without rocks or headland protrusions. As a result of its size and outstanding features, it has been approved for anchorage by marine insurance companies.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/y/Bay_Roberts_1072.html" title="Edit section: History">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
<p>European fishermen were visiting Bay Roberts as early as the 1500s. Fishermen from <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brittany.html" title="Brittany">Brittany</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/r/Normandy.html" title="Normandy">Normandy</a> in what is today <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">France</a> fished the waters off the coast of Bay Roberts in the early 1500s and named the harbour <i>Baie de Robert.</i> They established onshore fishing rooms where they dried and salted codfish. The French fishermen came to the area because of its large harbour, and flat rock beaches which they used for curing fish.</p>
<p>Most likely they started building fishing rooms near the end of Bay Roberts harbour in Bay Roberts East in such areas as Juggler's Cove. Then they moved to French's Cove and later to Mercer's Cove. Evidence of these European people can be found in community place names such as Priaulx Hill and in nearby names such as Spaniard's Bay and <a href="../../../p/o/r/Port_de_Grave%2C_Newfoundland_and_Labrador_0c4c.html" title="Port de Grave, Newfoundland and Labrador">Port de Grave</a>.</p>

<p>By the late 16th century, Bay Roberts had become part of the English Shore. Some French, Spanish and Portuguese fishermen still visited the area but they were out numbered by fishermen from the English West Country. Over time, some of these West Country fishermen began to settle in the area. Seary’s book <a href="http://www.mqup.mcgill.ca/book.php?bookid=507" class="external text" title="http://www.mqup.mcgill.ca/book.php?bookid=507" rel="nofollow"><i>Family Names of the Island of Newfoundland</i></a> states that the families with the sirname <i>French</i> arrived as long ago as 1634 and the <i>Earles</i> and the <i>Badcocks</i> arrived in the 1660s. In the 1675 census, Bay Roberts is called "Bay of Roberts."</p>
<p>The Berry census of Newfoundland records only two planters in Bay Roberts. One was Anthony Varder who lived there with his wife and four children. The other one was a widow named Jane Clay. The 1677 census says between them they employed 19 servants, owned six boats and kept 34 cattle, 22 sheep and 13 hogs. Families such as the <i>Parsons</i>, <i>Mercers</i> and <i>Bishops</i> arrived later. Settlers from the <a href="../../../c/h/a/Channel_Islands_7556.html" title="Channel Islands">Channel Islands</a> arrived in the 1700s.</p>

17th Century Artifact from Shipwreck in Bay Roberts Harbour</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>These early settlers left behind archaeological evidence of their way of life. Clay pipes and other artifacts have been found in places such as Mercer's Cove. At least one ship was lost in Bay Roberts Harbour during the 17th century. A large numbers of ceramic vessels which came from a 17th century shipwreck have been recovered from the harbour. Many of these are complete or almost complete. They include storage jars from the West Country of England and olive jars from Spain and Portugal.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/y/Bay_Roberts_1072.html" title="Edit section: French Attacks">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">French Attacks</span></h3>
<p>Like many settlements in <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conception_Bay_1738.html" title="Conception Bay">Conception Bay</a>, Bay Roberts was destroyed by the French during <a href="../../../k/i/n/King_William%27s_War_38f5.html" title="King William's War">King William's War</a> (1689-1697). When the French arrived in 1697, Abbé Baudoin, a priest who accompanied <a href="../../../p/i/e/Pierre_Le_Moyne_d%27Iberville_637f.html" title="Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville">Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville</a> on his raids, maintained a journal. He called the town <i>Baye Robert.</i> He says that d’Iberville captured 10 servants, 3 planters and 3 boats there and took 1500 codfish. These numbers may not have represented the entire population. By the time Abbé Baudoin and Pierre d'Iberville arrived, many of the people who lived in Bay Roberts had probably escaped into the woods or to Carbonear Island because they had been warned that the French were coming.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the effects of the French attacks did not last long, and Bay Roberts was built again. It became an important base for the Labrador fishery and the seal hunt.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/y/Bay_Roberts_1072.html" title="Edit section: Early Town Development">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Early Town Development</span></h3>
<p>Business development began with Robert Pack, founder of the firm of <i>Pack, Gosse, and Fryer</i>. The appointment of Robert Badcock as constable on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_25.html" title="September 25">September 25</a>, <a href="../../../1/7/3/1730.html" title="1730">1730</a> began the rule of law for the Bay Roberts area. Stocks and a jailhouse were constructed for the punishment of criminal offenders. The construction of a one-room school also took place with one male teacher in charge.</p>
<p>In 1791, there were 30 members of the <a href="../../../w/e/s/Wesleyan_Church_3704.html" title="Wesleyan Church">Wesleyan Church</a> in Bay Roberts under the charge of George Vey. The <a href="../../../c/h/u/Church_of_England_2cc6.html" title="Church of England">Church of England</a> was also active, since first St. Matthew's Church started in 1824 and was consecrated in 1827 to replace an earlier Church in Mercer's Cove. The first Society for the Propagation of the Gospel missionary in charge of the Bay Roberts mission was Rev. Oswald Howell in 1837.</p>
<p>The Newfoundland School Society (later known as the Newfoundland and British North American School Society and the Colonial and Continental Society) established a school in Bay Roberts in 1829 under Mr. and Mrs. Lind. The first president of the Newfoundland Teachers' Association, formed in 1890, was James Bancroft, who was teaching in Bay Roberts. He was instrumental in forming the Association. St. Mark's Anglican School in Shearstown dates back to 1867. (The original building has been incorporated into the present school, making it the oldest school in the district. Sadly, the old building was destroyed by fire in 2002.)</p>

<p>By the 1900's Bay Roberts was regarded as a wholesale and distribution centre for Conception Bay and <a href="../../../t/r/i/Trinity_Bay_a343.html" title="Trinity Bay">Trinity Bay</a> , and major businesses included cooperage (barrel making) and shipbuilding. William Dawe was the best-known cooper, having produced 7800 butter tubs in one year. Mr. J. Bowering was a renowned shipbuilder, who produced 50 ships a year for merchants and the <a href="../../../h/u/d/Hudson%27s_Bay_Company_f47f.html" title="Hudson's Bay Company">Hudson's Bay Company</a> for use in the fishing and sealing industries. However, the economy depended to a large extent on the fishing industry, as merchants owned between 60 and 70 ships which were used by the local fishermen.</p>

<p>At the turn of the 20th century, French's Cove in Bay Roberts East was a bustling fishing community. Today a photo would hardly leave any evidence that anyone ever lived there. However, the remains of root cellars and rock walls are in fairly good shape and have been reconstructed as part of the development of the Bay Roberts Heritage Trail.</p>

<p>The Klondyke, a causeway that connects Coley's Point and Bay Roberts, was once considered to be a "gold mine" to local families that were paid to complete it in 1897. Before the construction of the Klondyke, passengers and freight were ferried from Water Street in Bay Roberts to Coley's Point. During a public meeting in 1897, residents decided to build the causeway. Construction began in the winter months. Rock and gravel were carried to the site in hand-barrels, by horse and sled, and by hand. Men cut a channel through the ice and dumped the rock into the open water. When the Labrador fishery failed in 1897 and many families faced severe hardship, the government agreed to pay the men, women and children who worked on the construction of the causeway $1 a week to finish the work. Their wage was enough to buy one barrel of flour or one keg of molasses - a welcome relief for people facing a winter of hunger. One store owner in the area (reportedly Mrs. Bursell) compared the project to the <a href="../../../k/l/o/Klondike_Gold_Rush_7dcd.html" title="Klondike Gold Rush">Klondike Gold Rush</a> and, as a result, the causeway got its name - The Klondyke. (with a different spelling)</p>
<p>Since 1996, Bay Roberts has celebrated the construction of the Klondyke and the unique bond between the two communities in the annual Klondyke Days festivities.</p>

<p>The founder of the <i>Guardian</i> was the late Charles Edward Russell, who was born at Bay Roberts in 1877. In 1909 he bought a small printing plant from Harris and Wesley Mosdellwho for a number of years published a weekly newspaper called <i>The Bay Roberts Outlook</i>. On 09 July 1909, the first issue of the Guardian rolled off the man-power-driven press. (Incidentally, part of this printing equipment was acquired from the late (Magistrate) Jabez P. Thompson, who printed a newspaper called <i>The Vindicator</i> at <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brigus.html" title="Brigus">Brigus</a>, around the turn of the century.) Just after the founding of <i>The Guardian</i> in Bay Roberts, the <a href="../../../w/e/s/Western_Union_7e9b.html" title="Western Union">Western Union</a> Cable Company of New York became interested in acquiring a site in Conception Bay for their Atlantic Cable Relay Station. The <i>Guardian</i> was instrumental in persuading the promoters into selecting Bay Roberts as their site.</p>
<p>The <i>Guardian</i> also played a very conspicuous part in reporting events of the two world wars, chiefly the events pertaining to the many local volunteers in the various services. Many headlines read: "Killed in Action", "Died of Wounds", "Missing in Action at Sea", and so on. Also on the lighter side were the reports of receptions on the occasion of homecomings and letters to loved ones at home, and the happy news of the Armistices.</p>
<p>Other events that made interesting headlines were: "The Loss of the Swallow" which was the story of the Coley's Point fishing vessel, The Swallow, owned and mastered by John Bowering and his crew, all from Coley's Point, who were driven to sea in the Atlantic during a hurricane in September, 1915. After many days adrift, they were rescued from their sinking vessel by a passing ocean liner and brought to England, and after being given up for lost, they arrived home on Christmas Eve that same year.</p>

<p>The Western Union Cable Company brought the outside world to Bay Roberts in 1910. Eventually, ten trans-Atlantic cables were landed there -- among them the fastest in the world at that time. Hundreds of employees, both local and world-wide, passed through the doors of the Bay Roberts station. The brick building was erected as a relay station on the connection from England to North and South America. During two world wars, it necessitated a company of army personnel to guard the property from possible enemy action. <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winston_Churchill_74d2.html" title="Winston Churchill">Winston Churchill</a> and <a href="../../../f/r/a/Franklin_D._Roosevelt_eea3.html" title="Franklin D.

<p>The Town of Bay Roberts was incorporated in 1951 after Premier <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joseph_Smallwood_a1f0.html" title="Joseph Smallwood">Joseph Smallwood</a> suggested that if the Town had its own council, it could take care of paving its own roads. In the time since its incorporation, Bay Roberts has seen many changes. The number of services has greatly increased from two main businesses to a town whose economy depends upon its service industry. Bay Roberts has become a main business centre for a large part of Trinity and Conception Bays. Vast improvements have also been made in the area of recreation with the modernization of the swimming pool and the development of the ball fields and tennis courts.</p>
