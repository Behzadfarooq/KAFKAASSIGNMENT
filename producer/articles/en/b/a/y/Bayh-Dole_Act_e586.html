<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/y/Bayh-Dole_Act_e586.html" title="Edit section: Subject inventions">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Subject inventions</span></h3>
<p>A <b>subject invention</b> "means any invention" that is "conceived or first actually <a href="../../../r/e/d/Reduction_to_practice.html" title="Reduction to practice">reduced to practice</a> in the performance of work under a funding agreement." This definition covers a wide range of research activities that are either partially or completely federally funded. The CFR notes two questionable scenarios that do not give rise to subject inventions.</p>
<p>The first happens where an invention is created in closely related research outside the scope of the federally funded research. In this case, it must be shown that the non-government research did not "diminish or distract from" the federal research.</p>
<p>The second scenario occurs when research is wholly outside the scope of federally funded research, but may utilize some government funds (like equipment purchased for another research project). In this case, it must be shown that the research was done "without interference with or cost to the government-funded project."</p>
<p>Nevertheless, this definition is so broad, and it is very difficult to prove that research did not diminish, distract from, interfere with, or cost the government funded program. As such, many institutions assume that where federal funds have been used anywhere in a lab, a subject invention exists.</p>

<p>Prior to the enactment of Bayh-Dole, the U.S. government had accumulated 30,000 patents. Only approximately 5% of those patents were commercially licensed.</p>
<p>After <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a>, the government began spending a great deal of money to support public research in <a href="../../../m/i/l/Military.html" title="Military">military</a>, <a href="../../../d/e/f/Defense_%28military%29.html" title="Defense (military)">defense</a> and <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medical.html" title="Medical">medical</a> technologies (through the newly funded <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Science_Foundation_f301.html" title="National Science Foundation">National Science Foundation</a>). However, the government did not have a unified patent policy. At one point, those interested in government intellectual property were faced with dealing with 26 different agency policies.</p>
<p>The government's steps towards unification began in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1963.html" title="1963">1963</a> with Jerome Weisner, <a href="../../../p/r/e/President_Kennedy_acd6.html" title="President Kennedy">President Kennedy</a>'s science advisor, and culminated in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1971.html" title="1971">1971</a> under <a href="../../../p/r/e/President_Nixon_c7ae.html" title="President Nixon">President Nixon</a>. Nevertheless, all these policies directed title to the agencies and not to the public.</p>
<p>Not content, many non-profit organizations, led by the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Wisconsin_76d5.html" title="University of Wisconsin">University of Wisconsin</a>, sought even more favorable policies. In 1968 and 1973, the University successfully lobbied for agencies to enter into Institutional Patent Agreements, which, among other things, allowed universities and non-profits with approved of patent policies to retain title to their inventions. Although agreed to by only two agencies, the <a href="../../../h/e/a/Health_and_Human_Services_2686.html" title="Health and Human Services">Health and Human Services</a> (HHS) and National Science Foundation, the IPA laid the groundwork for enacting Bayh-Dole less than 10 years later.</p>

<p>Only one case has discussed the implications of disclosing subject inventions. In <i>Campbell Plastics Engineering &amp; Mfg., Inc. v. Les Brownlee</i>, 389 F.3d 1243 (Fed. Cir. 2004), the court held that since the <a href="../../../a/p/p/Appellant.html" title="Appellant">appellant</a> failed to comply with the invention disclosure provisions of a <a href="../../../c/o/n/Contract.html" title="Contract">contract</a>, the court upheld the transfer of <a href="../../../t/i/t/Title.html" title="Title">title</a> to an invention to the U.S. <a href="../../../a/r/m/Army.html" title="Army">Army</a>. Specifically, the contract required, per Bayh-Dole, that an invention be disclosed to the U.S. Army through a specific form, DD Form 882s. Campbell Plastics never disclosed its subject invention through this form. Campbell Plastics argued instead that it disclosed all parts of its invention over the course of the contract, but simply never used the form. The court did not specifically address the legitimacy of the particular form, but assumed that it was sufficient. Nevertheless, the court found that the "piecemeal submissions [did] not adequately disclose the subject invention under the contract." The result was a forfeiture of the subject invention.</p>

<p>In a footnote in the famous experimental use case, <i>Madey v. Duke University</i>, 307 F.3d 1351 (Fed. Cir. 2002), the court mentions Bayh-Dole. There is ultimately very little treatment of the topic. Instead the court quoted the district court as holding that where a subject invention exists and the defendant is a recipient of government funding, "in light of the Bayh-Dole Act... use of the patents that has been authorized by the government does not constitute <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patent_infringement.html" title="Patent infringement">patent infringement</a>."</p>

<p>In <i><a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Rochester_68d2.html" title="University of Rochester">University of Rochester</a> v. G.D. Searle &amp; Co.</i>, 358 F.3d 916 (Fed. Cir. 2004), the court rejected a claim that Bayh-Dole altered the grounds for <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patentability.html" title="Patentability">patentability</a>. The court, quoting an <a href="../../../a/m/i/Amicus_brief.html" title="Amicus brief">Amicus curiæ</a> stating</p>
<blockquote>
<p>no connection exists between the Bayh-Dole Act and the legal standards that courts employ to assess patentability. Furthermore, none of the eight policy objectives of the Bayh-Dole Act encourages or condones less stringent application of the patent laws to universities than to other entities.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/y/Bayh-Dole_Act_e586.html" title="Edit section: Petitions for march-in rights">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Petitions for march-in rights</span></h3>
<p>The government's march-in right is one of the most contentious provisions in Bayh-Dole. It allows the funding agency, on its own initiative or at the request of a third party, to effectively ignore the exclusivity of a patent awarded under the act and grant additional licenses to other "reasonable applicants." This right is strictly limited and can only be exercised if the agency determines, following an investigation, that one of four criteria is met <span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_march_in_rules"><sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../b/a/y/Bayh-Dole_Act_e586.html#endnote_march_in_rules" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../b/a/y/Bayh-Dole_Act_e586.html#endnote_march_in_rules" rel="nofollow">[3]</a></sup></span>. The most important of these are a failure by the contractor to take "effective steps to achieve practical application of the subject invention" or a failure to satisfy "health and safety needs" of consumers.</p>
<p>Though this right is, in theory, quite powerful, it has not proven so in terms of its practical application - to date, no federal agency has exercised its march-in rights. Three march-in petitions have been made to the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Institutes_of_Health_5b2b.html" title="National Institutes of Health">National Institutes of Health</a>, however, and pharmaceutical companies occasionally instruct their legal departments to evaluate the risk of march-in prior to negotiating contracts for drugs licensed under Bayh-Dole.</p>
<p>In <i>In Re Petition of CellPro, Inc.</i> <span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_CellPro"><sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../b/a/y/Bayh-Dole_Act_e586.html#endnote_CellPro" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../b/a/y/Bayh-Dole_Act_e586.html#endnote_CellPro" rel="nofollow">[4]</a></sup></span>, CellPro first argued that <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Johns_Hopkins_University_2df8.html" title="The Johns Hopkins University">The Johns Hopkins University</a> and <a href="../../../b/a/x/Baxter_Healthcare_2392.html" title="Baxter Healthcare">Baxter Healthcare</a> failed to take reasonable steps to commercialize certain patented <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stem_cell.html" title="Stem cell">stem cell</a> technologies and that Johns Hopkins should be forced to license Cellpro the patent necessary to keep its machine on the market <span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_CellPro_petition"><sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../b/a/y/Bayh-Dole_Act_e586.html#endnote_CellPro_petition" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../b/a/y/Bayh-Dole_Act_e586.html#endnote_CellPro_petition" rel="nofollow">[5]</a></sup></span>.

The NIH also mentioned the adverse effects that a march-in decision would have on federal efforts to encourage firms to commercialize federally funded research.</p>

<ul>
<li>The availability of NORVIR to <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patient.html" title="Patient">patients</a> with AIDS</li>
