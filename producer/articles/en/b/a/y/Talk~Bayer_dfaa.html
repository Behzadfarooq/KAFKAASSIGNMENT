<p>This need work to become NPOV</p>

Which specific points are not Npov&#160;? <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnthere_36ed.html" title="User:Anthere">SweetLittleFluffyThing</a></p>
<p>Specifically?&#160;? I just think the problem is its focus on the Gaucho case. In the ideal Wikipedia, that will have its own page and the Bayer page will be more general. Seems to me. <a href="../../../g/z/u/User%7EGzuckier_c12c.html" title="User:Gzuckier">gzuckier</a> 7/6/2004</p>
<p>Oh, then it is best to use the right semantic. This page does not suffer from pov. This page just suffers severely from uncompleteness. The solution is not to npov it, it is just to complete it&#160;:-) And here, I also agree&#160;;-) <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnthere_36ed.html" title="User:Anthere">SweetLittleFluffyThing</a> 18:54, 6 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Uh, no. I'm sorry, but claiming that a page on a major corporation that hardly discusses its present corporate structure, gives only the briefest overview of its current lines of business, doesn't discuss its management, but <b>does</b> "helpfully" devote almost 90% of its length to a formulaic list of corporate "sins" just isn't NPOV. The existence of heavy POV in the article is supported by most of the content of this Talk page itself, which focuses on other evils of Bayer that -- unfortunately, one is evidently supposed to think -- aren't adequately discussed in the article itself. This is a page on a major pharmaceutical corporation that doesn't even make an effort to provide a comprehensive list of its products -- instead, it mentions only the ones that have been controversial. Such omissions are prima facie evidence of a POV issue.</p>
<p>If you want articles on various controversies associated with Bayer, create them -- as ant notes, most of those mentioned here already have them. Then cross-reference them from a <b>brief</b> section on "Controversies" in the article body of this article. That, accompanied with a revision of the article structure and content to be a neutral and comprehensive overview of facts about the corporation, would fix the POV issue. The fact that you happen to agree with the POV embedded in the current article contents (in some respects, I do, too) is no excuse for pretending it's not there. Tls 23:09, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>It is my general understanding from books that I have read that Bayer (Germany or controlling corp.) bought the US "Bayer" trademark back from whoever purchased it sometime during the interwar period. It was again seized by the US Government during WW 2 and sold to Sterling at that time.

<dd>Sterling acquired holdings of Bayer after World War I (all holdings, trademarks and patents of Bayer had been impounded) and divided its pharma business into the Bayer Company (US), selling only Aspirine, and Winthrop, selling all other pharmaceuticals. But Bayer regained the US rights for its name in 1994... (according to the Bayer homepage)</dd>

<p>Not so much that Bayer couldn't protect the Aspirin trademark, rather that the Allies considered it "war booty," and a way to recover war losses from defeated Germany, I understand. In most of Europe it's still a registered trademark.Guille 20:32, 21 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I wonder why the facts that Bayer designed heroin and marketed tons of it aren't pointed out. Many years heroin was sold over the counter, while they were calling it an antitussive, suppressing evidence about addiction, using it for morphine addiction "treatment", etc. Bayer must be proud to be the "father" of Aspirin, the most successful drug, and heroin, the most successful and addictive illegal drug.</p>
