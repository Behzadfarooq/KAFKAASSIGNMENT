<h2><span class="mw-headline">Names of BART lines</span></h2>
<p>In the "current lines" section, it's useful to mention the colors, as that's how the lines are identified on BART maps. However, perhaps there should be some mention that BART lines are not referred to by their color, but by their final destination (eg, a rider would say, "I'm on a Richmond train," not "I'm on a red train." <a href="../../../j/c/b/User%7EJcb9_1d92.html" title="User:Jcb9">Jcb9</a> 1 July 2005 20:03 (UTC)</p>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I'm going to take a moment to note how, as a rider, I've been forever frustrated by the lines which change names when extensions are finished. More on-topic, the destination is of course ambiguous in regards to the route. There are two different routes which end in Richmond, for example. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaRodman_7cd8.html" title="User:JoshuaRodman">JoshuaRodman</a> 04:20, 21 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<a name="Details_of_BART_service" id="Details_of_BART_service"></a>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">Details of BART service</span></h2>
<p>An anon has added some info to the page that seems unencyclopedic:</p>
<p>BART OPERATING HOURS: WEEKDAYS 3:45AM TO 2:00AM WEEKENDS AND HOLIDAYS: 4:15AM TO 2:30AM FOR SERVICE AFTER 2:00AM(WEEKDAYS) AND 2:30AM ON WEEKENDS, USE THE SPECIAL BART OWL BUSES. THESE BUSES RUN EVERY 7 MINUTES BETWEEN 2:00AM-4:30AM.</p>
<p>Who cares about the specific operating hours? Train frequency it at least a measure of the size/scope of the system, but I'm inclined to remove this. Also, the same anon made a number of changes that are completely incorrect; yes, in the blessed Embarcadero to Daly City corridor, trains run every 4 minutes, but on any given line (i.e., for everyone else in the entire Bay Area) they run every 15 minutes or 20 minutes. I'm reverting that change out.</p>
<p>I'm also planning to revert the change that says MUNI is comparable to other transit systems. It's not. Look at a map for any other large city with transit, and there are far more lines that cover a greater area. There may be a number of buses, but rail-wise it seems inferior to NYC, DC, Boston, Chicago, etc., everywhere except LA! Full disclaimer: I grew up outside Washington D.C., where the suburbs actually have trains that run every 15 minutes, even on the weekends.</p>
<p>Finally, does anyone have any evidence that MUNI is coordinated schedule-wise with BART? All I know is that when I take the MUNI train back from Pac Bell park, the wait for the next train to Dublin/Pleasanton is always freakin 19 minutes!! A google for bart muni schedule coordination turned up a few discussions of a "Transit Coordination Implementation Plan" but it doesn't specifically reference BART and MUNI schedules.

<dd>I think the idea is to show that BART does not provide local service and that in most other places the people who provide heavy rail service also provide bus service. AFAIK, BART is the only (non commuter) rail-only transit system in the US.

<p>Is there a reason that Balboa Park is left out? The above sentence lists four stations but says it lists five. I'm assuming that the omission is Balboa Park, but I didn't want to edit it in case there is a reason it was left out. Either way, there is a mistake in the sentence. Could someone more familiar with the article fix it? Thanks!</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Ghost Trains</span></h2>
<p>Can someone elaborate on how dew causes ghost trains in the computer system and any changes that have been made over the years to help avoid this problem? Is it a problem shared by other similar rapid transit systems?</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'm not sure that the dew causes ghost trains, but according to this very POV but informative website, <a href="http://www.pushback.com/Wattenburg/bio/BART.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.pushback.com/Wattenburg/bio/BART.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> found by Niteowlneils, it causes (or originally caused) trains to disappear from the computer systems. Dew rusted the tracks at night, and since such a low voltage signal was used to detect the trains, the rust insulated the wheels from the track, causing the train to disappear from the system. I don't know if BART has redressed the problem other than the solution proposed on the webpage, but other rapid transit systems (including the very similar <a href="../../../w/a/s/Washington_Metro_39fe.html" title="Washington Metro">Washington Metro</a> use higher voltages to detect trains, voltages which are not insulated by rust. <a href="../../../b/a/y/User%7EBayberrylane_f685.html" title="User:Bayberrylane">Bayberrylane</a> 20:38, 10 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Byron? What the heck is Byron?</span></h2>
<p>Quote from article:</p>
<p><i>"While the district includes all of the cities and communities in its jurisdiction, the BART system only has stations in many but not all of these cities. This has caused tensions in places like Byron..."</i></p>
<p>This might sound a little bitchy, but I've never even heard of Byron. And what kind of "tensions" could there be for BART not stopping in a town of less than a thousand people, that's twenty miles away from the nearest BART line, and that isn't even on a major highway? Was there some sort of political action to get BART into Byron that I never heard of? Livermore I understand - most people have heard about the expansion plans - but I think inclusion of this little town in the opening part of the article is either ridiculous or should be cited with an article about past political action there.</p>

<p>As of Dec 2005, MTC is starting a new Owl bus service system in the Bay Area funded by Regional Measure 2 money. This funds both previous Owl service provided by Muni, AC Transit, and VTA as well as some new service. Some of the service covers BART stations previously without any transit service when rail service was not available. Someone should include something about this in the main article.</p>
<p>Also, BART General Managers should be added from Stokes to Margro, and a few paragraphs on the substantial impact on Bay Area land use patterns, especially in central and eastern Contra Costa county, would be appropriate. Keep in mind: the people who wanted BART to exist had a very definite vision of San Francisco and Oakland as urban headquarters cities and everything else as suburbs. Their point was to get the Dilberts of the day into the cubicles of the day reliably and sell houses etc., not provide a rail transit network with appropriate bus connections to facilitate public transit use per se.</p>

<dd>Regarding Owl service - the new Owl buses will replace most of the lines, and provide transport around the Bay except one gaping hole. To go between Fremont and San Jose, one must go via San Francisco. It's going to be much shorter (and possibly cheaper, too) to take a cab, unless VTA provides Owl service on 180. They could even have a semi-local line, like Samtrans 397 replacing KX at night. <a href="../../../b/a/y/User%7EBayberrylane_f685.html" title="User:Bayberrylane">Bayberrylane</a> 20:24, 10 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Here is a link to a page on the BART site that give accurate years for the creation of the commission and district. The district was created in 1957 which I added to the article. The commission came first in 1951 and took eight years to come up with a general plan for BART. In 1961, the specifics for BART where hashed out by the district members and in 1962 plan was approved by the voters. I added a mention of the voters approval for BART and the fact that it was the CA legislator that created the district. --<a href="../../../c/a/b/User%7ECab88_fc4f.html" title="User:Cab88">Cab88</a> 08:19, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Track Guage</span></h2>

<dd>There's an uncited explanation on the <a href="../../../b/r/o/Broad_gauge.html" title="Broad gauge">broad gauge</a> page saying that it's to prevent the lightweight trains from being blown over by the wind - as well as being mentioned on the main page. Of course, they could have just used windscreens where winds may have been a problem? --<a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMillbrooky_17bd.html" title="User:Millbrooky">Millbrooky</a> 06:58, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The BART track gauge issue attracts a great deal of negative comment which cannot be justified in light of experience elsewhere. "Standard gauge" serves no particular purpose in situations where through working is ruled out by design factors. "Standardization" per se would appear to provide fewer advantages than many Americans take for granted. Each of Tokyo's subway lines has its own unique fleet, and (in most cases) these cannot operate on other lines because track gauge, current collection and rolling stock dimensions are not identical.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>BART would have been "absolutely unusable" for "mainline" trains even given a common track gauge because U.S. "mainline" rolling stock is larger, and heavier, than "rapid transit" rolling stock. (This is not true in some other countries, e.g. Japan.) Operation of BART trains over "mainline" track is not possible because BART trains do not conform to Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) crashworthiness standards - they would be much heavier if they did.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>My POV, but I'd have to say that "blown over" was probably not the issue. The theoretical calculation went something like so many degrees of superelevation (at curves) plus wind of so much velocity = train (of planned mass) blown off track.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Strong gusts of wind do occur in the Bay Area - and such gusts have been known to blow trains off tracks in Japan (which uses "standard gauge size" trains on "narrow-gauge" tracks). The most recent (and serious) incident of this type occurred on a high viaduct in western Honshu.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Knowing this, and absent some form of "design countermeasure," BART would reasonably have needed to have some means of stopping trains if wind velocity reached a certain "threshold." But figuring out how to do this would be difficult because Bay Area "gusts" are typically not sustained gale force winds but just that - gusts. It would be difficult to predict these with good accuracy. The alternative - waiting (as with an earthquake) until the "event" actually occurs to stop trains could impose significant service disruption. I can think of a number of BART design features that suggest poor planning, but track gauge is not really one of them. Ldemery 00:10, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I seem to remember hearing that the non-standard gauge was also a political move to disallow counties which opted out of the system due to its high construction cost (because of the Transbay Tube) from benefitting from the system later by connecting it to standard gauge tracks. That sounds a little dubious. BART also has since expanded into San Mateo County, laying parallel track to the standard-gauge Caltrain in some places. (Though it's not unlikely this would also be justified by ridership numbers and other operational concerns.) Anyway, does anyone have any documentation on this theory? -- <a href="../../../b/e/l/User%7EBeland_b814.html" title="User:Beland">Beland</a> 00:22, 30 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>One of the reasons for the wide gauge is that it supposedly provides a greater stability for passengers based on research. BART took a clean-slate approach when it comes to engineering, so existing standards didn't matter much, but the downfall is that no other system in the world has built based on BART standards. A benefit of BART being a standard gauge system instead, is that BART would be able to adopt new rolling stock technology quickly, and making a joint order to other agencies. Third generation metro systems in the US: Baltimore, Miami, and Los Angeles all have standard gauge, third rail, and use an identical rail car design. New subway systems in China are also being standardized on standard gauge, 1.5kv overhead line, and are ordering the same type of equipment. Acnetj 00:52, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Unless I'm mistaken, the <a href="../../../w/a/s/Washington_Metro_39fe.html" title="Washington Metro">Washington Metro</a> was built to the same standards as BART; they certainly look the same from the outside, and use the same technology. I have difficulty with the idea that Bechtel would design the system and subsequent contractors would design build cars with identical nomenclatures to two different standards. Stranger things have been known to happen, but... <a href="../../../e/w/k/User%7EEwk_216d.html" title="User:Ewk">Eric</a> 06:18, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>That "daily ridership" figure should read "weekday ridership," preferably "average weekday ridership." "Daily" and "weekday" ridership are not the same thing - the former is annual ridership divided by 365 and is reported by some systems overseas (e.g. Japan). Ldemery 00:12, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>There is no evidence to suggest that daily ridership is that high currently, for weekdays yes, but average daily, no. If one works out the numbers BART provides, avarage weekday rideship for 2004 was 308486.5, meaning roughly 155,000 people use BART every weekday. The number should be changed to reflect the official numbers from BART. For Fiscal '05 average weekday exits were 310,717. <a href="../../../j/v/i/User%7EJVittes_e279.html" title="User:JVittes">JVittes</a> 06:58, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>After thinking about it I think it would be best to adopt the wording similar to the <a href="../../../c/a/l/Caltrain.html" title="Caltrain">Caltrain</a> article in the infobox, and include "(avg. weekday)". Since the information to calculate the formula suggested above is either hard or impossible to find, I can't find weekend numbers, monthly numbers, anything that would help; that way it seems more accurate, afterall if you compare it to the <a href="../../../w/a/s/Washington_Metro_39fe.html" title="Washington Metro">Washington Metro</a> information it would seem to inflate BART's numbers. <a href="../../../j/v/i/User%7EJVittes_e279.html" title="User:JVittes">JVittes</a> 17:37, 03 May 2006 (EDT)</p>

<dd>It's better. Thanks! (Another nitpick, sorry!, but possibly a different background color for the legend, as the current dark gray doesn't contrast too well with the red text.) Nice work with the SVG, by the way!</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Mobile Phone Underground Coverage</span></h2>
<p>By November 2005, BART had become "the first transit system in the nation to offer wireless communication to all passengers on its trains underground".</p>

<p>"When BART first broached the idea in mid-2001 of wiring its nether regions for wireless reception, many passengers squawked about having to listen to nonstop chatter from cellular phones... The Sept. 11 terrorist attacks occurred while the surveys were being taken, and BART officials believe the widely publicized use of cell phones during the attacks persuaded many passengers to support wiring the tunnels."</p>
<p>I can confirm underground reception in all the stations and tubes under Market Street in San Francisco, but I'm not sure if they're still working on the other underground parts of the network.</p>
<dl>
<dd>On the east bay, there is def <b>not</b> reception everywhere. it's rather spotty, too, some stations have it, but the tunnels definitely do not have full coverage. <a href="../../../l/e/n/User%7ELensovet_4866.html" title="User:Lensovet">lensovet</a> 06:16, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That wording is misleading, it is ok for something like a newspaper, but an encyclopedia should be better than that. What does that statement mean? <a href="../../../w/a/s/Washington_Metro_39fe.html" title="Washington Metro">DC Metro</a> had all its underground (except for a few short tunnels) connected to <a href="../../../v/e/r/Verizon.html" title="Verizon">Verizon</a> wireless service by 2001. Is there anything about the new statement in the article that as written may lead to confusion?. It needs to be rewritten. I'll take a stab at it after I read the links here. --<a href="../../../j/v/i/User%7EJVittes_e279.html" title="User:JVittes">JVittes</a> 13:16, 14 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Maybe what they mean is that all wireless providers have service, rather than just one. The article talks about that. What we really need to do is call BART and ask them the status of this. <a href="../../../l/e/n/User%7ELensovet_4866.html" title="User:Lensovet">lensovet</a> 20:59, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That makes more sense. I can confirm that coverage in the East Bay underground stations and tubes is not yet active. The articles probably meant what Lensovet said - that they provide to customers of all wireless providers in the region. Gordeonbleu 04:29, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I heard somewhere that <a href="../../../w/a/s/Washington_Metro_39fe.html" title="Washington Metro">DC Metro</a> only has CDMA service, so it may have to do with that, Cingular I think doesn't support CDMA, so that's why it claims all passengers, eventhough one still has to have a service provider, and a cell phone, so it is confusing. I guess I'm being pedantic, both systems allow all passengers to use the wireless system, just that on BART one can say that if you have service near a station you will have service inside BART. Though I think last time I was in the Bay Area Cingular blacked out in some of the underground sections around Berkeley, so I don't know. --<a href="../../../j/v/i/User%7EJVittes_e279.html" title="User:JVittes">JVittes</a> 04:48, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Some really old AT&amp;T Wireless/Cingular customers might still be on the CDMA network, but yeah, most Cingular, as well as all T-Mobile, users are on GSM. Take a look at <a href="http://www.govtech.net/digitalcommunities/story.php?id=98319" class="external free" title="http://www.govtech.net/digitalcommunities/story.php?id=98319" rel="nofollow">http://www.govtech.net/digitalcommunities/story.php?id=98319</a> , which actually says what they mean by "all passengers", and also at the <a href="http://www.govtech.net/digitalcommunities/story.php?id=98319" class="external text" title="http://www.govtech.net/digitalcommunities/story.php?id=98319" rel="nofollow">BART Times</a> of Feb '06 mentioning that the project is complete in downtown SF and is progressing elsewhere on the system. I'll try to call BART next week to see if I can get more info. <a href="../../../l/e/n/User%7ELensovet_4866.html" title="User:Lensovet">lensovet</a> 07:01, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
