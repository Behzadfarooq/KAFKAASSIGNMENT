<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/y/Bay_Ronald_bd2e.html" title="Edit section: Racing career">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Racing career</span></h2>
<p>Bay Ronald had a moderate racing career. In his 26 starts he won only five, and placed three times. He finally retired to stud having won £6,443.</p>
<p>As a two-year-old, Bay Ronald started 5 times, finishing third in one race. As a three-year-old, he ran 8 races, winning two: the Limekiln Stakes (1 mile) and the Lowther Stakes (1.5 miles) held at <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newmarket_Racecourse_a9ef.html" title="Newmarket Racecourse">Newmarket Racecourse</a>.</p>
<p>At four, he had one win out of six starts, at the 1.5 mile <a href="../../../h/a/r/Hardwicke_Stakes_751a.html" title="Hardwicke Stakes">Hardwicke Stakes</a>. He also placed second at the <a href="../../../c/h/a/Champion_Stakes_5490.html" title="Champion Stakes">Champion Stakes</a>, and third in the <a href="../../../e/c/l/Eclipse_Stakes_e3eb.html" title="Eclipse Stakes">Eclipse Stakes</a>. As a five-year-old he improved slightly, winning two out of seven starts: the City and Suburban Handicap (1.25 miles) and the Epsom Cup, carrying 132 pounds. Urged by thus success, his owner decided to enter him in the 2.5 mile <a href="../../../a/s/c/Ascot_Gold_Cup_8904.html" title="Ascot Gold Cup">Ascot Gold Cup</a>. However, the distance was too great, and he did not finish well. Despite this, Bay Ronald came out the next day to place second in the Hardwicke Stakes. The 1889 season was to be his last on the track.</p>

<p>Bay Ronald first stood at Preston Farm in 1899. Due to his rather unimpressive record, his stud fee for the first season was 25 guineas, and free to mares who had already produced winners. During his time at stud in England, he bred few mares--less than 20 each year--and they were generally of poor quality. Later, his stud fee would reach 100 guineas.</p>
<p>Five of his first crop of foals went on to win as two-year-olds. His second crop included the Rous Memorial Stakes winner, Wild Oats, and six other winners. One of these winners was MacDonald II, a colt out of a French mare, who went on to be quite successful.</p>
<p>Bay Ronald's third crop, who began racing in 1905, were less impressive. However, it was at this time that his son, MacDonald II, began to show his talent, and French breeders purchased Bay Ronald for £5000. He left behind his fourth crop, including then-yearling <a href="../../../d/a/r/Dark_Ronald_57ed.html" title="Dark Ronald">Dark Ronald</a>, and fifth crop, which produced his son <a href="../../../b/a/y/Bayardo_%28horse%29.html" title="Bayardo (horse)">Bayardo</a>, when he left for Cheri Halbronn's stud.</p>
<p>In France, Bay Ronald produced some good horses, including Combourg, Greffulhe, and Fidia.</p>
<p>Bay Ronald tended to pass on his stoutness. He was the most influential of the Hampton sons, and his offspring continued the Hampton line.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/y/Bay_Ronald_bd2e.html" title="Edit section: Sport horse breeding">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Sport horse breeding</span></h3>
<p>Bay Ronald had the greatest influence on the <a href="../../../s/p/o/Sport_horse.html" title="Sport horse">sport horse</a> breeding industry through his son Dark Ronald and grandson Teddy. Overall, the number of top sport horses who feature him in their lineage is spectacular. He is especially prominent in sport horses of <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thoroughbred.html" title="Thoroughbred">Thoroughbred</a> breeding, such as many of the top <a href="../../../e/v/e/Eventing.html" title="Eventing">eventers</a>.</p>
<p>Teddy is seen in the pedigrees of Matcho AA, and eventers <a href="../../../d/r/2E/Dr._Peaches_f6ae.html" title="Dr. Peaches">Dr. Peaches</a>, and <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Gray_Goose_51ea.html" title="The Gray Goose">The Gray Goose</a>.</p>
<p>Dark Ronald is seen in the pedigrees of World Cup I, and his brothers, the Hanoverian Werther (in which Dark Ronald appears twice), the great <a href="../../../p/i/k/Pik_As_1a3f.html" title="Pik As">Pik As</a>, Valentino xx, Waidmannsdank xx, Lord, <a href="../../../s/o/n/Son-in-Law_af6d.html" title="Son-in-Law">Son-in-Law</a> (great grand-sire to Cottage Son), and Ladykiller xx (who has had a fantastic influence on the Holstein breed). <a href="../../../c/o/r/Cor_de_la_Bryere_6c2e.html" title="Cor de la Bryere">Cor de la Bryere</a> and Landgraf I were also linebred to him. Dark Ronald is also featured in the pedigrees of <a href="../../../f/u/r/Furioso.html" title="Furioso">Furioso</a>, Beau Pere (progeny include international jumpers White Lightning and Encore (winner of the Grand Prix at Fontainebleau and a USET team member), eventer Landlady, two-time American invitational winner Sundancer, Canadian equestrian team member Easy Doc, and British equestrian team member Turn on the Sun), Der Loewe (in the pedigree of such horses as <a href="../../../g/e/s/Gestion_Salinero_5a61.html" title="Gestion Salinero">Salinero</a>, <a href="../../../a/r/k/Arko.html" title="Arko">Arko</a>, and <a href="../../../b/r/e/Brentina.html" title="Brentina">Brentina</a>), and dressage stallion <a href="../../../b/o/l/Bolero_%28horse%29.html" title="Bolero (horse)">Bolero</a> (sire of <a href="../../../b/r/e/Brentano_II_2936.html" title="Brentano II">Brentano II</a>, grand-sire of <a href="../../../p/o/e/Poetin.html" title="Poetin">Poetin</a> and <a href="../../../b/r/e/Brentina.html" title="Brentina">Brentina</a>). Top eventers with Dark Ronald include Shear Leau and Bally Cor (both through <a href="../../../s/o/n/Son-in-Law_af6d.html" title="Son-in-Law">Son-in-Law</a>).</p>
<p>Through his son <a href="../../../b/a/y/Bayardo_%28horse%29.html" title="Bayardo (horse)">Bayardo</a>, Bay Ronald also had an influence on sport horse breeding. Bayardo produced English Triple Crown winner <a href="../../../g/a/i/Gainsborough.html" title="Gainsborough">Gainsborough</a>, who sired the small colt <a href="../../../h/y/p/Hyperion_%28horse%29.html" title="Hyperion (horse)">Hyperion</a>. Hyperion is found in the pedigrees of many sport horses, including the show jumpers <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carling_King_f568.html" title="Carling King">Carling King</a>, Jet Run, Pan American silver medalist A Little Bit, Encore (who also went back to Bay Ronald through Dark Ronald), Canadian equestrian team horse Stoic, <a href="../../../a/n/n/Anne_Kursinski_a9d1.html" title="Anne Kursinski">Anne Kursinski</a>'s jumper Eros, and USET jumper Aberali. Hyperion's dressage offspring include Pion, and the influential sire Lauries Crusador (who produced 2000 World Young Dressage Horse Champion Laurentianer, and Londonderry, winner of the jumping class for 4-year-olds at the 1999 at the Bundeschampionate). He is also in the pedigree of eventers <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charisma_%28horse%29.html" title="Charisma (horse)">Charisma</a>, <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winsome_Adante_145b.html" title="Winsome Adante">Winsome Adante</a>, <a href="../../../e/a/g/Eagle_Lion_cbf9.html" title="Eagle Lion">Eagle Lion</a>, <a href="../../../b/i/k/Biko_%28horse%29.html" title="Biko (horse)">Biko</a>, and Sandrift, and the great sire of eventers <a href="../../../b/e/n/Ben_Faerie_4993.html" title="Ben Faerie">Ben Faerie</a> (sire of <a href="../../../p/r/i/Priceless_%28horse%29.html" title="Priceless (horse)">Priceless</a> and Walk on Star, dam-sire of Primmore's Pride).</p>
<p>Both Bayardo and Teddy are seen in the pedigrees of many horses, many times through the stallion <a href="../../../d/j/e/Djebel.html" title="Djebel">Djebel</a>. These horses include <a href="../../../b/o/l/Bolero_%28horse%29.html" title="Bolero (horse)">Bolero</a> (sire of <a href="../../../b/r/e/Brentano_II_2936.html" title="Brentano II">Brentano II</a>, <a href="../../../b/r/e/Brentina.html" title="Brentina">Brentina</a>, and many others) and <a href="../../../m/y/_/My_Babu_39fe.html" title="My Babu">My Babu</a> (grandsire of eventer <a href="../../../j/j/_/JJ_Babu_26b9.html" title="JJ Babu">JJ Babu</a> and many others). Bayardo and Teddy are also seen in the pedigree of <a href="../../../m/i/g/Might_Tango_2a92.html" title="Might Tango">Might Tango</a>. Both Dark Ronald and Teddy are seen in the pedigree of Donnerwetter (the sire of the enormously influential Donnerhall) as well as the influential stallion <a href="../../../r/a/n/Rantzau_%28horse%29.html" title="Rantzau (horse)">Rantzau</a>.</p>
<p>All three are seen in the pedigree of the great eventer Prince Panache (through <a href="../../../s/o/n/Son-in-Law_af6d.html" title="Son-in-Law">Son-in-Law</a> and <a href="../../../m/y/_/My_Babu_39fe.html" title="My Babu">My Babu</a>), and the pedigree of <a href="../../../t/a/m/Tamarillo_%28horse%29.html" title="Tamarillo (horse)">Tamarillo</a> has Bay Ronald featured almost 30 times, mostly through Bayardo and Teddy, but also through Dark Ronald and Mcdonald.</p>
