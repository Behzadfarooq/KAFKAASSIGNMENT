<dd>Nah. That was the big buzz then. Everybody was calling it the turn of the millennium, not the turn of the century. Don't get the chance very often, so best to indulge yourself.

<p>I kindly request you to leave historical issue more to me. <i>Dombi moved on to Feijenoord</i> is more correct than <i>fled to Feijenoord</i>. He did not fo either. For keeping the history short <i>moved on</i> will' do. His next job was actually with <i>FC Basel</i> - and he did not flee. When I have time I shall write the Bio of Dombi, alias Kohn, a quite remarkable figure in the history of the game. I just have at this moment not the time for it. Before that I will finish eg., <a href="../../../h/e/n/Hennes_Weisweiler_5849.html" title="Hennes Weisweiler">Hennes Weisweiler</a>. But not just now. I have also got other things to do. Having read a couple of articles re Nazis and football does not quite maketh the expert.</p>
<p>I believe, I have a very deep understanding of the club and its history and published in my lifetime quite a bit with regards to it.</p>
<p>If you want to wank yourself dry about Nazi football do something useful, make contributions to the <a href="../../../s/c/h/Schalke_04.html" title="Schalke 04">Schalke</a> Schalke and "<a href="../../../t/s/v/TSV_1860_Munich_8de9.html" title="TSV 1860 Munich">TSV 1860 Munich</a>" (nice web site to it on the web pre-existing) pages, or document international matches of that era.</p>
<p>This is all meant with friendship and in a cordial spirit.</p>
<p>I myself, in between, will hopefully be able to get the <a href="../../../b/a/y/Bayern_Munich_a6fb.html" title="Bayern Munich">Bayern Munich</a> page to a foremost standard, collate facts, and wahack them into an eventually presentable form with a suitable narrative accompanyment.</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>

<p>This is a collaboration. Leaving the historical issue to you is not collaborating. If there needs to be debate to settle a point, then fine, but again be civil. This is supposed to be a shared experience where we end up with the best possible result.</p>
<p>"Wank my self dry" is uncivil. I put some relevant information in context. I'm aware of Schalke and 1860 Munich and have made related comments in the Bundesliga and BM articles, not having edited the club pages. Nazism had an impact on German football and the lives of some of the games important persons. That should be acknowledged, plain and simple.</p>
<p>I'm prepared to debate points, and like the issue over Dombi "fleeing", its the type of thing one sorts out in a "friendly and cordial" manner. Dombi "left for" Switzerland because the climate in the country was becoming uncomfortable. He ended up in the Netherlands. Changing a couple of words fixed the thing. Civilly.</p>
<p>Look hard at something before you nuke it and if just needs a tweak, tweak it. Show some consideration for the work of others. You may well be a historical expert, but I write quite well. Surely there's some sawoff in there.</p>

<dd>Which is what I was hoping for when I invited input. And no, Oa, your approach has not been co-operative. It's been abrasive and inconsiderate. Appointing yourself as THE expert on the club is high-handed. And while the attempt is good, the language of the article is weak. It doesn't carry the tone of an encyclopedia and is full of mistakes related to tense, sentence structure and common usage. Encyclopedia articles as a rule don't use a lot of exclamation marks and florid language. I repeat - its an encyclopedia, not a fan page and should read that way. Your history may be good, but at a minimum the writing style needs help. <a href="../../../w/i/g/User%7EWiggy%21_ca25.html" title="User:Wiggy!">Wiggy!</a> 19:59, 7 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't have a basic issue with the facts laid down. The content has been generally consistent, but that doesn't bar others from adding to the body of fact in the work. However, the writing isn't even close to Featured Article standards. If going FA is an objective, the writing needs to be fixed. It's important to allow broader participation and take advantage of the various strengths of all the contributors. I don't see that in spirit or in fact. So, without putting words in your mouth, I guess I'm I agreeing with you. <a href="../../../w/i/g/User%7EWiggy%21_ca25.html" title="User:Wiggy!">Wiggy!</a> 21:25, 7 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Bayern under the Nazis</span></h2>
<p>Bayern, beyond the elimination of Jews from its ranks, did not suffer any particular obvious pressures. Party appointed presidents were not running it before 1938. The successors of Landauer where non-jewish, but else <i>bona fide</i> up to then.</p>
<dl>
<dd>German football under the Nazis was different from what German football had previously been. All clubs came under some measure of political pressure. Some were disbanded or restructured to be politically tame entities. The league structure was significantly altered. The regime had a deliberate policy of bending social institutions, including sports and football clubs, to their objectives. The Allies deliberate deconstruction of German organizations "contaminated" by the Nazi's immediately after the war during the occupation had a direct effect on German football clubs. To say the club suffered no ill effects "beyond the elimination of Jews from its ranks" utterly flies in the face of the lessons of that period of history. Football teams were not the engine of the regimes policies, but like the rest of the country they certainly were caught up in it. Some teams, like Bayern and Alemania, were able to stand up in some way to the tide and should receive some recognition for it. They entry acknowledges the impact on Bayern and German society in general of the country's darkest period.</dd>

<dd>The material is relevant to the history of German football in a broad sense and not just to the history of the club. I can't see skipping it.</dd>

If you need to fix a fact that's fine, fix it. But be civil. I don't want to get into an edit war with you, but you've gone and hacked out a bunch of stuff that's relevant and interesting to the club history. It wouldn't hurt to leave it in place.</p>
<p>And yeah, I have done some research. Just like you. There's room for everyone to make contributions, which I gather is the nature of a collaboration. Show some generosity and consideration for the spirit of the project.</p>
<p>Again, it should read like an encyclopedia article – not a fan page. <a href="../../../w/i/g/User%7EWiggy%21_ca25.html" title="User:Wiggy!">Wiggy!</a> 17:22, 7 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Improvement Drive - State of Affairs</span></h2>
<p>The content has by now successfully transormed from a quasi fan-page to NPOV content. Most of the things worth consigning to the knowledge of posterity have been added by now. There is still a major issue to deal with:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Content length:</i> This will be handled by summarising the content of "History" and whacking the long verison on a seperate page <a href="../../../f/c/_/FC_Bayern_Munich_-_History_039f.html" title="FC Bayern Munich - History">FC Bayern Munich - History</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Once this is done the content will be restructured and put into a order as found in recommended pertinent articles (eg. <a href="../../../i/f/k/IFK_G%C3%B6teborg_fb51.html" title="IFK Göteborg">IFK Göteborg</a>, <a href="../../../a/r/s/Arsenal_FC_7f38.html" title="Arsenal FC">Arsenal FC</a>)</p>
<p>This means, we will end up with somethin like</p>
<ul>
<li>History</li>
<li>Club Honours</li>
<li>Players</li>
<li>Coaches</li>
<li>Stadium</li>
</ul>
<p>etc., in a yet to determined sequence.</p>
<p><br />
Further emphasis will be put on filling the blanks. This means if an item (eg., a name) is worth linking from the page it is worth writing an article to it. No more shining red links!!!</p>
<p>I myself, beyond dealing with some issues on the <a href="../../../b/a/y/Bayern_Munich_a6fb.html" title="Bayern Munich">Bayern Munich</a> page, have since added articles to <a href="../../../j/u/p/Jupp_Heynckes_e314.html" title="Jupp Heynckes">Jupp Heynckes</a>, <a href="../../../z/l/a/Zlatan_Cajkovski_ad9b.html" title="Zlatan Cajkovski">"Czik" Cajkovski</a>, <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Townley_ca0f.html" title="William Townley">William Townley</a> and others.</p>
<p>There are still many other and rewarding topic to be found: <a href="../../../f/r/a/Franz_Roth_9b2e.html" title="Franz Roth">Franz Roth</a> (here research might be focussing if there is another player out there who has decided with a single goal two European finals - by all means ans interesting player), Wilhelm Neudecker, the father of the modern FC Bayern, Richard Dombi (Hungarian, played for Austria, created <a href="../../../f/e/y/Feyenoord_Rotterdam_eeba.html" title="Feyenoord Rotterdam">Feyenoord Rotterdam</a> as we know it, Bayerns first championship coach), <a href="../../../b/r/a/Branko_Zebec_8bda.html" title="Branko Zebec">Branko Zebec</a> who won with some other club the <a href="../../../u/e/f/UEFA_Cup_38a7.html" title="UEFA Cup">UEFA Cup</a>, before succeeding big-time as coach in Germany, <a href="../../../d/e/t/Dettmar_Cramer_9dc1.html" title="Dettmar Cramer">Dettmar Cramer</a>, Germany's globe-trotting coach, <a href="../../../m/a/x/Max_Merkel_6950.html" title="Max Merkel">Max Merkel</a>, <a href="../../../p/a/l/Pal_Csernai_7ca6.html" title="Pal Csernai">Pal Csernai</a>, <a href="../../../u/l/i/Uli_Hoeness_2c39.html" title="Uli Hoeness">Uli Hoeness</a>, etc.</p>
<p>It s all about acquiring specialist knowledge: adopt a guy, decide to love him or hate him - and most impoerantly, find out everything about him you can, and write it up for a global audience. For me, not being a natural scientist, Wikipedia is all about an opportunity of document the past so that ensuing generations can reconstruct it perfectly, and at ease.</p>
<p>I am not sure if anybody has any idea, how long it took me to research the first of the great coaches in Germany, Wiliam Townley. It is a project still not yet finished, and it cost me tons of hours, and I am still working on it. Just yesterday I found out about his engagement with <i>Eintracht Hannover</i>.</p>
<p>Beyond fixing up typos, there is a lot left to do.</p>
<p>Cheers to all.</p>

<p>If the article is to be divided up, it might be better to slough off all the trivia to separate pages. If you cut out the history of the club all you're left with is the minuate that only a serious fan would enjoy — as I understand it, that's not the point of the exercise. Take the list of coaches and attendance and presidents and captains and move that material to a separate page, along the lines of what I suggested somewhere above on this discussion page. Remember, it's not a fan page, its an encyclopedia entry and it has to read as one in its content and its tone. You've done a ton of work, but now we're running the risk of getting off track with this article.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Recent Changes (February 3, 2006)</span></h2>
<p>The entry for Bayern has now experienced a significant consolidation. The content length is more in line with Wikipedia guidelines, and even more importantly, the content has been transformed from a more fan-site-typical make up to a more bread and butter facts based type of situation.</p>
<p>It is still far from being anywhere near perfect. Thus, the next days will see a further streamlining of the content and a more user friendly structuring. I am aware that there are also still a few typos around: whoever finds one may keep it, or even better fix it.</p>
<p>Further attempts will be made to further increase the number of hard facts for the target audience.</p>
<p>Let's see, if in the end the price for the most improved page can be garnered!</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Club Nickname</span></h2>
<p>Bayern has NO nick. "FC Hollywood" was temporary jargon of the press some ten years ago, "Bazis" did not really catch on, and "Bayern", well that's the name of the team, but no <i>nickname</i>. What else should they call it? "Borussia"". No nick is no nick.</p>

<p>About the nickname thing, I agree that FC Hollywood would not be an appropriate nickname. I'd say Bayern because you can consider it a shortname that everybody uses. Also on the official website, they usually call the team: "The Reds", i don't know if it would make it for a nickname because its very general and it works for other teams (i.e. Kaiserslautern). Bottom line, I think a nickname should be mentioned because it renders the team more personal hence gives an "apercu" on the fan attachment...</p>

<p>I can see mention of <i>FC Hollywood</i> and <i>Bazis</i> being made in the context of derisive names for the club used by the press or other club's supporters. It would help get across the idea of the hate-on some folks have for <i>Bayern</i>. <i>The Reds</i> works to distinguish them in town from <i>1860</i> who are <i>The Blues</i>. Both these references work, but only in context. <a href="../../../w/i/g/User%7EWiggy%21_ca25.html" title="User:Wiggy!">Wiggy!</a> 02:10, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

"A nickname should be mentioned because it renders the team more personal ..." - and it would render my cat more personal if it could speak. Fact is: my cat cannot speak, and Bayern simply has no nickname! If I tell s/body "the reds have won over the weekend", would they know whom I am talking about? No. Does this settle it?</p>

I browsed my way through <i>Bayerns</i> home page and the fan and history sections of both the English and German versions (I can't read Chinese!) make reference to the team as <i>the Reds</i>, so that might indeed be a legit reference. Graze through the site and see what you think. <a href="../../../w/i/g/User%7EWiggy%21_ca25.html" title="User:Wiggy!">Wiggy!</a> 15:20, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The term "the Reds/die Roten" has never ever come across to me in the regular press, radio, tv, etc. Even in fan forums the expression has only ever cropped up once to me, but that was one of the "Gymnasts / Turner", ie., TSV 1860, when it was used in the context if it was a good idea to go with "the Reds" into the stadium joint venture. Else the used mostly "Bauern" ("farmers', but I guess they would rather translate "peasants").</p>
<p>Many, many years ago "Rothosen" ("red shorts") was in use to some extent. But I have heard this term for the last time, I guess, yes, it was in the seventies!</p>
<p>Maybe you want to try the following test google&#160;»site:transfermarkt.de die roten«&#160;. Hannover would be a common result (Transfermarkt is a pretty comprehensive German football forum site). Note that the expression would have to be in an in an unequivocal positive sense and pretty common to boot to qualify as a "nickname". Nickname stuff like die "Roten" or "Bayern" is only ever used in contexts where there are forms to be filled out and people feel compelled to fill something in. Some automatism. Like if I amske what my fav milk flavour is. Probably I would check something like "chocolate" even if I am known for not having touched milk since the days when the term "Rothosen" was last heard.

<p>There's been no arguments for either of the sides, so let's get some information before going into a vote. At the Bayern hompage Magath is named <a href="http://www.fcbayern.t-com.de/en/teams/trainer/index.php?fcb_sid=27ec64c390d3e996339a9cb888edaf66" class="external text" title="http://www.fcbayern.t-com.de/en/teams/trainer/index.php?fcb_sid=27ec64c390d3e996339a9cb888edaf66" rel="nofollow">"Head Coach"</a> while Hoeness is <a href="http://www.fcbayern.t-com.de/en/company/company/index.php?fcb_sid=27ec64c390d3e996339a9cb888edaf66" class="external text" title="http://www.fcbayern.t-com.de/en/company/company/index.php?fcb_sid=27ec64c390d3e996339a9cb888edaf66" rel="nofollow">"Deputy Chairman Executive Board"</a> - subordinate to Rummenigge who is "Chairman Executive Board" so as I see it Hoeness is the "assistant" of Rummenigge and not manager in his own right. Also, all other Bundesliga clubs have the head coach as "manager" apart from <a href="../../../s/c/h/Schalke_04.html" title="Schalke 04">Schalke 04</a> where Rudi Assauer is clearly stated as "manager" on the clubs website. So, I don't think you should bother with a vote and just change it back to Magath. If the editor wants to change it some arguments will have to surface from his side. <a href="../../../p/o/u/User%7EPoulsen_e5d4.html" title="User:Poulsen">Poulsen</a> 11:33, 21 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>In England (I know <a href="../../../b/a/y/Bayern_Munich_a6fb.html" title="Bayern Munich">Bayern Munich</a> is in Germany), Head Coaches are refered to as Managers. Wikipedia has <a href="../../../s/i/r/Sir_Alex_Ferguson_4917.html" title="Sir Alex Ferguson">Sir Alex Ferguson</a> is a Scottish football manager which is the same position as Felix Magath. <a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingjeff_8e3f.html" title="User:Kingjeff">Kingjeff</a> 15:53, 21 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think the confusion stems from poor command of the English language. In the English language, the term "manager" is used, among others, for the coach and differs from the meaning of the term "manager" as it is used in the German language. Since this is an English language website, the term manager is correctly used for Klaus Magath! (JMK, New York, January 22, 2006).</p>

<p>Somewhere on my hard rive I have a half way decent enough pic or two. Just, at this stage this is not really the major priority from my view point. The first priority was to remove the biggest nonsense an transfer it sort of from fan-page to NPOV. Next is consolidation of the content, and then, in the end we will tart it up with a few meaningful contextual illustrations. In the end the thing has to have the look and feel of the champions league of the wiki football club pages. What it will look for the next few transitional days matters not a lot. A few changes here and there for the time being, so that people see things are moving. Cheers,</p>

<p>I'll give a little bit of credit for the flags. The flags are a whole different topic. But I still maintain that they're still Bayern fans. <a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingjeff_8e3f.html" title="User:Kingjeff">Kingjeff</a> 19:11, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
