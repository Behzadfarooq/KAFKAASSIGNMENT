<p>Bayesian theory and Bayesian probability are named after <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Bayes_3ee9.html" title="Thomas Bayes">Thomas Bayes</a> (1702 — 1761), who proved a special case of what is now called <a href="../../../b/a/y/Bayes%27_theorem.html" title="Bayes' theorem">Bayes' theorem</a>. The term <i>Bayesian</i>, however, came into use only around <a href="../../../1/9/5/1950.html" title="1950">1950</a>, and it is not clear that Bayes would have endorsed the very broad interpretation of probability that is associated with his name. <a href="../../../p/i/e/Pierre-Simon_Laplace_cc1f.html" title="Pierre-Simon Laplace">Laplace</a> proved a more general version of Bayes' theorem and used it to solve problems in celestial mechanics, medical statistics and, by some accounts, even <a href="../../../j/u/r/Jurisprudence.html" title="Jurisprudence">jurisprudence</a>. Laplace, however, didn't consider this general theorem to be important for probability theory. He instead adhered to the <a href="../../../c/l/a/Classical_definition_of_probability.html" title="Classical definition of probability">classical definition of probability</a>.</p>
<p><a href="../../../f/r/a/Frank_P._Ramsey_0858.html" title="Frank P. Ramsey">Frank P. Ramsey</a> in <i>The Foundations of Mathematics</i> (1931) first proposed using subjective belief as a way of interpreting probability. Ramsey saw this interpretation as a complement to the <a href="../../../f/r/e/Frequency_probability.html" title="Frequency probability">frequency interpretation</a> of probability, which was more established and accepted at the time. The statistician <a href="../../../b/r/u/Bruno_de_Finetti_e0f6.html" title="Bruno de Finetti">Bruno de Finetti</a> in 1937 adopted Ramsey's view as an alternative to the frequency interpretation of probability. <a href="../../../l/e/o/Leonard_Jimmie_Savage_292d.html" title="Leonard Jimmie Savage">L. J. Savage</a> expanded the idea in <i>The Foundations of Statistics</i> (1954).</p>
<p>Formal attempts have been made to define and apply the intuitive notion of a "degree of belief". The most common interpretation is based on <a href="../../../g/a/m/Gambling.html" title="Gambling">betting</a>: a degree of belief is reflected in the odds and stakes that the subject is willing to bet on the proposition at hand.</p>
<p>On the Bayesian interpretation, the theorems of probability relate to the rationality of partial belief in the way that the theorems of logic are traditionally seen to relate to the rationality of full belief. Degrees of belief should not be regarded as extensions of the truth-values (true and false) but rather as extensions of the attitudes of belief and disbelief. Truth and falsity are <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metaphysical.html" title="Metaphysical">metaphysical</a> notions, while belief and disbelief are <a href="../../../e/p/i/Epistemic.html" title="Epistemic">epistemic</a> (or doxastic) ones.</p>
<p>The Bayesian approach has been explored by <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harold_Jeffreys_de94.html" title="Harold Jeffreys">Harold Jeffreys</a>, <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Threlkeld_Cox_69c2.html" title="Richard Threlkeld Cox">Richard T.

<p>The terms <i>subjective probability</i>, <i>personal probability</i>, <i>epistemic probability</i> and <i>logical probability</i> describe some of the schools of thought which are customarily called "Bayesian". These overlap but there are differences of emphasis. Some of the people mentioned here would not call themselves Bayesians.</p>
<p>Bayesian probability is supposed to measure the degree of belief an individual has in an uncertain proposition, and is in that respect subjective. Some people who call themselves Bayesians do not accept this subjectivity. The chief exponents of this <i>objectivist</i> school were <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edwin_Thompson_Jaynes_4988.html" title="Edwin Thompson Jaynes">Edwin Thompson Jaynes</a> and <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harold_Jeffreys_de94.html" title="Harold Jeffreys">Harold Jeffreys</a>. Perhaps the main objectivist Bayesian now living is James Berger of Duke University. Jose Bernardo and others accept some degree of subjectivity but believe a need exists for "reference priors" in many practical situations.</p>
<p>Advocates of <b>logical (or objective epistemic) probability</b>, such as <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harold_Jeffreys_de94.html" title="Harold Jeffreys">Harold Jeffreys</a>, <a href="../../../r/u/d/Rudolf_Carnap_028b.html" title="Rudolf Carnap">Rudolf Carnap</a>, <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Threlkeld_Cox_69c2.html" title="Richard Threlkeld Cox">Richard Threlkeld Cox</a> and <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edwin_Thompson_Jaynes_4988.html" title="Edwin Thompson Jaynes">Edwin Jaynes</a>, hope to codify techniques whereby any two persons having the same information relevant to the truth of an uncertain proposition would calculate the same probability. Such probabilities are not relative to the person but to the epistemic situation, and thus lie somewhere between subjective and objective. However, the methods proposed are controversial. Critics challenge the claim that there are grounds for preferring one degree of belief over another in the absence of information about the facts to which those beliefs refer. Another problem is that the techniques developed so far are inadequate for dealing with realistic cases.</p>

<p>Bayesian probability contrasts with <a href="../../../f/r/e/Frequency_probability.html" title="Frequency probability">frequency probability</a>, in which probability is derived from observed frequencies in defined distributions or proportions in populations.</p>
<p>The theory of statistics and probability using <a href="../../../f/r/e/Frequency_probability.html" title="Frequency probability">frequency probability</a> was developed by <a href="../../../r/o/n/Ronald_A._Fisher_8f00.html" title="Ronald A. Fisher">R.A. Fisher</a>, <a href="../../../e/g/o/Egon_Pearson_d05b.html" title="Egon Pearson">Egon Pearson</a> and <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jerzy_Neyman_53ef.html" title="Jerzy Neyman">Jerzy Neyman</a> during the first half of the 20th century. <a href="../../../a/2E/_/A._N._Kolmogorov_769e.html" title="A. N. Kolmogorov">A. N. Kolmogorov</a> also used frequency probability to lay the mathematical foundation of probability in measure theory via the <a href="../../../l/e/b/Lebesgue_integration.html" title="Lebesgue integration">Lebesgue integral</a> in <i>Foundations of the Theory of Probability</i> (1933). Savage, Koopman, <a href="../../../a/b/r/Abraham_Wald_4158.html" title="Abraham Wald">Abraham Wald</a> and others have developed Bayesian probability since 1950.</p>
<p>The difference between Bayesian and Frequentist interpretations of probability has important consequences in statistical practice. For example, when comparing two hypotheses using the same data, the theory of <a href="../../../h/y/p/Hypothesis_test.html" title="Hypothesis test">hypothesis tests</a>, which is based on the frequency interpretation of probability, allows the rejection or non-rejection of one model/hypothesis (the <a href="../../../n/u/l/Null_hypothesis.html" title="Null hypothesis">'null' hypothesis</a>) based on the probability of mistakenly inferring that the data support the other model/hypothesis more. The probability of making such a mistake, called a <a href="../../../t/y/p/Type_I_Error_4764.html" title="Type I Error">Type I error</a>, requires the consideration of hypothetical data sets derived from the same data source that are more extreme than the data actually observed. This approach allows the inference that 'either the two hypotheses are different or the observed data are a misleading set'. In contrast, Bayesian methods condition on the data actually observed, and are therefore able to assign posterior probabilities to any number of hypotheses directly. The requirement to assign probabilities to the parameters of models representing each hypothesis is the cost of this more direct approach.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/y/Bayesian_probability.html" title="Edit section: Applications">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Applications</span></h2>
<p>Since the 1950s, Bayesian theory and Bayesian probability have been widely applied through <a href="../../../c/o/x/Cox%27s_theorem.html" title="Cox's theorem">Cox's theorem</a>, Jaynes' <a href="../../../p/r/i/Principle_of_maximum_entropy.html" title="Principle of maximum entropy">principle of maximum entropy</a> and the <a href="../../../d/u/t/Dutch_book.html" title="Dutch book">Dutch book argument</a>. In many applications, Bayesian methods are more general and appear to give better results than <a href="../../../f/r/e/Frequency_probability.html" title="Frequency probability">frequency probability</a>. <a href="../../../b/a/y/Bayes_factor.html" title="Bayes factor">Bayes factors</a> have also been applied with <a href="../../../o/c/c/Occam%27s_Razor_046a.html" title="Occam's Razor">Occam's Razor</a>. See <a href="../../../b/a/y/Bayesian_inference.html" title="Bayesian inference">Bayesian inference</a> and <a href="../../../b/a/y/Bayes%27_theorem.html" title="Bayes' theorem">Bayes' theorem</a> for mathematical applications.</p>
<p>Some regard Bayesian inference as an application of the <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientific_method.html" title="Scientific method">scientific method</a> because updating probabilities through Bayesian inference requires one to start with initial beliefs about different <a href="../../../h/y/p/Hypothesis.html" title="Hypothesis">hypotheses</a>, to collect new information (for example, by conducting an <a href="../../../e/x/p/Experiment.html" title="Experiment">experiment</a>), and then to adjust the original beliefs in the light of the new information. Adjusting original beliefs could mean (coming closer to) accepting or rejecting the original hypotheses.</p>
<p>Bayesian techniques have recently been applied to filter <a href="../../../e/-/m/E-mail_spam.html" title="E-mail spam">spam</a> e-mail. A Bayesian spam filter uses a reference set of e-mails to define what is originally believed to be spam. After the reference has been defined, the filter then uses the characteristics in the reference to define new messages as either spam or legitimate e-mail. New e-mail messages act as new information, and if mistakes in the definitions of spam and legitimate e-mail are identified by the user, this new information updates the information in the original reference set of e-mails with the hope that future definitions are more accurate. See <a href="../../../b/a/y/Bayesian_inference.html" title="Bayesian inference">Bayesian inference</a> and <a href="../../../b/a/y/Bayesian_filtering.html" title="Bayesian filtering">Bayesian filtering</a>.</p>

<p>One criticism levelled at the Bayesian probability interpretation has been that a single probability assignment cannot convey how well grounded the belief is—i.e., how much <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientific_evidence.html" title="Scientific evidence">evidence</a> one has. Consider the following situations:</p>
<ol>
<li>You have a box with white and black balls, but no knowledge as to the quantities</li>
<li>You have a box from which you have drawn <i>n</i> balls, half black and the rest white</li>
<li>You have a box and you know that there are the same number of white and black balls</li>
</ol>
<p>The Bayesian probability of <i>the next ball drawn being black</i> is 0.5 in all three cases. <a href="../../../k/e/y/Keynes.html" title="Keynes">Keynes</a> called this the problem of the "weight of evidence". One approach is to reflect difference in evidential support by assigning probabilities to these probabilities (so-called <i>metaprobabilities</i>) in the following manner:</p>
<dl>
<dd>1. You have a box with white and black balls, but no knowledge as to the quantities</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Letting <span class="texhtml">θ = <i>p</i></span> represent the statement that the probability of the next ball being black is <span class="texhtml"><i>p</i></span>, a Bayesian might assign a uniform Beta prior distribution:</dd>

</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Assuming that the ball drawing is modelled as a binomial sampling distribution, the posterior distribution, <span class="texhtml"><i>P</i>(θ | <i>m</i>,<i>n</i>)</span>, after drawing <i>m</i> additional black balls and <i>n</i> white balls is still a Beta distribution, with parameters <span class="texhtml">α<sub><i>B</i></sub> = 1 + <i>m</i></span>, <span class="texhtml">α<sub><i>W</i></sub> = 1 + <i>n</i></span>.

<p>Other Bayesians have argued that probabilities need not be precise numbers.</p>
<p>Because there is no room for metaprobabilities on the frequency interpretation, frequentists have had to find different ways of representing difference of evidential support. <a href="../../../c/e/d/Cedric_Smith_7809.html" title="Cedric Smith">Cedric Smith</a> and Arthur Dempster each developed a theory of <a href="../../../u/p/p/Upper_and_lower_probabilities.html" title="Upper and lower probabilities">upper and lower probabilities</a>. <a href="../../../g/l/e/Glenn_Shafer_8324.html" title="Glenn Shafer">Glenn Shafer</a> developed Dempster's theory further, and it is now known as <a href="../../../d/e/m/Dempster-Shafer_theory_4f8f.html" title="Dempster-Shafer theory">Dempster-Shafer theory</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/y/Bayesian_probability.html" title="Edit section: Controversy">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Controversy</span></h2>
<p>A quite different interpretation of the term <i>probable</i> has been developed by <a href="../../../f/r/e/Frequency_probability.html" title="Frequency probability">frequentists</a>. In this interpretation, what are <i>probable</i> are not propositions entertained by believers, but events considered as members of collectives to which the tools of statistical analysis can be applied.</p>
<p>The Bayesian interpretation of probability allows probabilities to be assigned to all propositions (or, in some formulations, to the events signified by those propositions) in any reference class of events, independent of whether the events can be interpreted as having a <a href="../../../r/e/l/Relative_frequency.html" title="Relative frequency">relative frequency</a> in repeated trials. Controversially, Bayesian probability assignments are relative to a (possibly hypothetical) rational subject: it is therefore not inconsistent to be able to assign different probabilities to the same proposition by Bayesian methods based on the same observed data. Differences arise either because different models of the data generating process are used or because of different prior probability assignments to model parameters. Differences due to model differences are possible in both Frequentist and Bayesian analyses, but differences due to prior probabilities assignments are distinctive to Bayesian analyses. Such probabilities are sometimes called 'personal probabilities', although there may be no particular individual to whom they belong. Frequentists argue that this makes Bayesian analyses subjective, in the negative sense of 'not determined from the data'. Bayesians typically reply that differences due to alternative models of the data generating process are equally subjective, and that such model choices are also (ideally) chosen prior to analysis of the data, by the analyst. Since the analyst is also a natural person to assign prior probabilities, the two subjective inputs can be seen as deriving from the same source.</p>
<p>Although there is no reason why different interpretations (senses) of a word cannot be used in different contexts, there is a history of antagonism between Bayesians and frequentists, with the latter often rejecting the Bayesian interpretation as ill-grounded. The groups have also disagreed about which of the two senses reflects what is commonly meant by the term 'probable'. More importantly, the groups have agreed that Bayesian and Frequentist analyses answer genuinely different questions, but disagreed about which class of question it is more important to answer in scientific and engineering contexts.</p>
