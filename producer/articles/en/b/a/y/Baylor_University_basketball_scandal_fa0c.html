<p><a href="../../../p/a/t/Patrick_Dennehy_fcfb.html" title="Patrick Dennehy">Patrick Dennehy</a> was a junior forward who transferred to Baylor University from the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_New_Mexico_8b83.html" title="University of New Mexico">University of New Mexico</a> following his sophomore season in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2001.html" title="2001">2001</a>-<a href="../../../2/0/0/2002.html" title="2002">2002</a>. After <a href="../../../r/e/d/Redshirt_%28college_sports%29.html" title="Redshirt (college sports)">redshirting</a> the 2002-2003 season (to comply with the NCAA's Division I transfer policy), he was preparing to play for the Baylor Bears in the upcoming 2003-<a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a> season. Dennehy's friend and teammate, <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carlton_Dotson_4799.html" title="Carlton Dotson">Carlton Dotson</a>, was a junior <a href="../../../p/o/w/Power_forward.html" title="Power forward">power forward</a> on the Baylor basketball team who played two seasons at <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paris_Junior_College_0d2f.html" title="Paris Junior College">Paris Junior College</a> in <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paris%2C_Texas_5935.html" title="Paris, Texas">Paris, Texas</a>, before transferring to Baylor University in the summer of 2002.</p>
<p>In the summer of 2003, Dennehy and Dotson indicated that they were concerned about their safety. They had purchased two <a href="../../../p/i/s/Pistol.html" title="Pistol">pistols</a> and a <a href="../../../r/i/f/Rifle.html" title="Rifle">rifle</a> and practiced firing them at a farm north of <a href="../../../w/a/c/Waco%2C_Texas_3edc.html" title="Waco, Texas">Waco, Texas</a>. On <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_14.html" title="June 14">June 14</a>, Dennehy told friend Daniel Okopnyi that he was worried about threats made to Dotson by two fellow teammates. Dennehy also indicated that he and Dotson would be at a party the following day at which neither appeared.</p>
<p>Over the next few days, there were indications that something had gone wrong: Dennehy's mother and stepfather, Valorie and Brian Brabazon, were concerned that they had received no calls on <a href="../../../f/a/t/Father%27s_Day_7017.html" title="Father's Day">Father's Day</a>. Dennehy's roommate, Chris Turk, returned from an out-of-town trip to find that Dennehy's dogs had not been fed in days. On <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_19.html" title="June 19">June 19</a>, the Brabazons filed a report with the Waco Police Department that Dennehy was missing.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_25.html" title="June 25">June 25</a>, Dennehy's <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chevrolet_Tahoe_04cf.html" title="Chevrolet Tahoe">Chevrolet Tahoe</a> <a href="../../../s/u/v/SUV_9cd0.html" title="SUV">SUV</a> was found in the parking lot of a <a href="../../../s/h/o/Shopping_mall.html" title="Shopping mall">shopping mall</a> in <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virginia_Beach%2C_Virginia_caa0.html" title="Virginia Beach, Virginia">Virginia Beach, Virginia</a>, with its <a href="../../../l/i/c/License_plate.html" title="License plate">license plates</a> removed.</p>
<p>An affidavit filed on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_23.html" title="June 23">June 23</a>, which was unsealed on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_30.html" title="June 30">June 30</a>, seeking a search warrant for Dennehy's computer says that an informant in <a href="../../../d/e/l/Delaware.html" title="Delaware">Delaware</a> told police that Dotson, who was by now at home in <a href="../../../h/u/r/Hurlock%2C_Maryland_4ee0.html" title="Hurlock, Maryland">Hurlock, Maryland</a>, told a cousin that he had shot and killed Dennehy during an argument while firing guns in the Waco area. On <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_21.html" title="July 21">July 21</a>, Dotson was charged with the <a href="../../../m/u/r/Murder.html" title="Murder">murder</a> of Patrick Dennehy and taken into custody in <a href="../../../m/a/r/Maryland.html" title="Maryland">Maryland</a>.</p>
<p>The search for Dennehy continued for several weeks until <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_25.html" title="July 25">July 25</a>, when a badly-decomposed body was found in a gravel pit near Waco. The body was taken to <a href="../../../d/a/l/Dallas%2C_Texas_2045.html" title="Dallas, Texas">Dallas, Texas</a>, for an autopsy and the following day medical examiners identified the body as being Patrick Dennehy. On <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_30.html" title="July 30">July 30</a>, his death was ruled a homicide after a preliminary autopsy report showed that Dennehy died of gunshot wounds to the head. Dennehy was buried in <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Jose%2C_California_e18c.html" title="San Jose, California">San Jose, California</a>, on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_7.html" title="August 7">August 7</a>.</p>

Three <a href="../../../p/s/y/Psychiatrist.html" title="Psychiatrist">psychiatrists</a>, including one appointed by the court, said that Dotson appeared to be suffering from <a href="../../../h/a/l/Hallucination.html" title="Hallucination">hallucinations</a> and <a href="../../../p/s/y/Psychosis.html" title="Psychosis">psychosis</a>, but that should he regain competency in the future, he would be made to stand trial.</p>
<p>However, in February of <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>, Dotson was returned to jail after <a href="../../../p/s/y/Psychologist.html" title="Psychologist">psychologists</a> deemed him competent to stand trial but that he must continue taking his <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antipsychotic_medication.html" title="Antipsychotic medication">antipsychotic medication</a>.

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/y/Baylor_University_basketball_scandal_fa0c.html" title="Edit section: Potential NCAA Violations">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Potential NCAA Violations</span></h2>
<p>In early August 2003, allegations arose concerning Dennehy's ability to remain with the Baylor basketball team during the 2002-2003 academic year without an <a href="../../../a/t/h/Athletic_scholarship.html" title="Athletic scholarship">athletic scholarship</a>. Allegations of impropriety within the athletic department surfaced and Baylor University President Robert Sloan appointed an investigative panel to determine if there were any potential NCAA violations at the school.</p>
<p>The <i><a href="../../../f/o/r/Fort_Worth_Star-Telegram_c51a.html" title="Fort Worth Star-Telegram">Fort Worth Star-Telegram</a></i> later discovered that during this time, Head Coach <a href="../../../d/a/v/Dave_Bliss_2e46.html" title="Dave Bliss">Dave Bliss</a> told players to lie to investigators by indicating that Patrick Dennehy had paid for his US$7,000 tuition by <a href="../../../i/l/l/Illegal_drug_trade.html" title="Illegal drug trade">dealing drugs</a>. These conversations were taped on <a href="../../../m/i/c/Microcassette.html" title="Microcassette">microcassette</a> by assistant coach Abar Rouse from <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_30.html" title="July 30">July 30</a> to <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_1.html" title="August 1">August 1</a>. On the tapes, Coach Bliss is heard instructing players to fabricate the story of Dennehy being a drug dealer to the University's investigative committee and also said that talking to the <a href="../../../m/c/l/McLennan_County%2C_Texas_dd2d.html" title="McLennan County, Texas">McLennan County, Texas</a>, Sheriff's Department would give him the opportunity to "practice" his story. However, despite the potential allegations of <a href="../../../o/b/s/Obstruction_of_justice.html" title="Obstruction of justice">obstruction of justice</a> and <a href="../../../w/i/t/Witness_tampering.html" title="Witness tampering">witness tampering</a>, no charges were filed against Coach Bliss.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/y/Baylor_University_basketball_scandal_fa0c.html" title="Edit section: Drug Use">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Drug Use</span></h3>
<p>On <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_1.html" title="August 1">August 1</a>, further allegations arose from Carlton Dotson's estranged wife, Melissa Kethley, and by Sonya Hart, the mother of another athlete, Paul Hart. They reported that abuse of <a href="../../../c/a/n/Cannabis_%28drug%29.html" title="Cannabis (drug)">marijuana</a> and <a href="../../../a/l/c/Alcoholic_beverage.html" title="Alcoholic beverage">alcohol</a> was rampant in the Baylor basketball program and was subsequently ignored by the athletic department and coaching staff.</p>
<p>Kethley revealed that five or six basketball players would meet at their apartment and smoke marijuana, sometimes before practice. She also witnessed Dotson fake a drug test using urine provided by a drug-free teammate.</p>
<p>Sonya Hart revealed that she had raised concerns about the drug use with associate athletic director Paul Bradshaw, but that no one ever got back in contact with her. President Sloan's investigation also agreed that the staff not only knew about the substance abuse but also failed to follow procedures for reporting drug test failures, with the purpose of allowing players to remain on the team.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/y/Baylor_University_basketball_scandal_fa0c.html" title="Edit section: Recruiting Violations">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Recruiting Violations</span></h3>
<p>On <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_5.html" title="August 5">August 5</a>, two members of the 2002-2003 Baylor basketball team told <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Dallas_Morning_News_9b67.html" title="The Dallas Morning News">The Dallas Morning News</a></i> that members of the coaching staff were present during a pickup game involving star recruit Harvey Thomas during his official visit to Baylor, a clear violation of NCAA recruiting regulations. One of the two players said that head coach Dave Bliss and assistant coach Rodney Belcher were both present during the game.</p>
<p>The NCAA rules state that staff observation of a recruit's athletic activities, directly or indirectly, during their official visit to their university is illegal.</p>
<p><a name="Coach_Dave_Bliss" id="Coach_Dave_Bliss"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/y/Baylor_University_basketball_scandal_fa0c.html" title="Edit section: Coach Dave Bliss">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Coach Dave Bliss</span></h3>
<p>It was also revealed that Baylor basketball coach, Dave Bliss, had apparently broken several NCAA regulations during his tenure at Baylor and in a previous basketball coaching position at <a href="../../../s/o/u/Southern_Methodist_University_7ccb.html" title="Southern Methodist University">Southern Methodist University</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1988.html" title="1988">1988</a>.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_2.html" title="August 2">August 2</a>, an NCAA memo obtained by the <i>Fort Worth Star-Telegram</i> detailed major rules violations, including booster payments of US$2,000 to $5,000 to center <a href="../../../j/o/n/Jon_Koncak_dcc7.html" title="Jon Koncak">Jon Koncak</a> during his junior and senior years. Both Bliss and SMU received no NCAA penalties for the infractions because the university had already received <a href="../../../t/h/e/The__Death_Penalty__7d14.html" title="The &quot;Death Penalty&quot;">the "Death Penalty"</a> for violations in their football program in February <a href="../../../1/9/8/1987.html" title="1987">1987</a> and the decision was made not to further punish the SMU athletic department. Shortly after the investigation, Bliss left SMU to take a position at the University of New Mexico in 1988, before joining the Baylor program in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1999.html" title="1999">1999</a>.</p>
<p>For his part, Bliss denied all allegations saying, "We have followed the rules, however difficult they may be, for 30 years."</p>
<p>However, under heavy pressure from all sides, Coach Bliss, along with University athletic directory Tom Stanton, who accepted responsibility despite having no direct knowledge of the infractions, resigned on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_8.html" title="August 8">August 8</a>, 2003.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/y/Baylor_University_basketball_scandal_fa0c.html" title="Edit section: Preliminary Penalties">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Preliminary Penalties</span></h2>
<p>On the same day Coach Bliss resigned, the Baylor University investigative committee announced their preliminary results and determined potential sanctions on the school. Initial sanctions imposed by the school included probation of the school's basketball program for two years, no postseason play for the 2003-2004 season, including the <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_12_Men%27s_Basketball_Tournament_8428.html" title="Big 12 Men's Basketball Tournament">Big 12 Conference tournament</a> (see the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004_Big_12_Men%27s_Basketball_Tournament_f290.html" title="2004 Big 12 Men's Basketball Tournament">2004 Tournament page</a>) and an immediate release was tendered to every athlete in the men's basketball program. Four players took the school up on this offer: <a href="../../../l/a/w/Lawrence_Roberts_%28basketball_player%29_d8c4.html" title="Lawrence Roberts (basketball player)">Lawrence Roberts</a>, <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Harding_Lucas_III_945a.html" title="John Harding Lucas III">John Lucas III</a>, Kenny Taylor and Tyrone Nelson transferred to other schools. Two of the four became immediate stars at programs that would win regular-season conference titles in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>. Roberts became the main inside force at <a href="../../../m/i/s/Mississippi_State_University_d169.html" title="Mississippi State University">Mississippi State</a>, leading the Bulldogs in scoring and rebounding and being selected as a first-team All-American. Lucas stayed in the conference at <a href="../../../o/k/l/Oklahoma_State_University_3ecc.html" title="Oklahoma State University">Oklahoma State</a>, becoming the Cowboys' second-leading scorer and assists leader while helping the Cowboys to reach the <a href="../../../f/i/n/Final_Four_ffdd.html" title="Final Four">Final Four</a>.</p>
<p>Kenny Taylor transferred to the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Texas_e78d.html" title="University of Texas">University of Texas</a>, Tyrone Nelson enrolled at Prairie Vie A&amp;M University, and <a href="../../../c/o/r/Corey_Herring_bd2e.html" title="Corey Herring">Corey Herring</a> transfered a year later to <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canisius_College_57b4.html" title="Canisius College">Canisius College</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/y/Baylor_University_basketball_scandal_fa0c.html" title="Edit section: Further Investigation">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Further Investigation</span></h2>
<p>The University continued to investigate the basketball program over the next seven months and released their final report on <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_26.html" title="February 26">February 26</a>, 2004. The full list of major program violations included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Former Coach Dave Bliss paying for tuition for two players, Dennehy and <a href="../../../c/o/r/Corey_Herring_bd2e.html" title="Corey Herring">Corey Herring</a><sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> and attempting to conceal it.</li>
<li>Coaching staff providing meals, transportation, lodging and clothing to athletes.</li>
<li>Coaching staff paying for tuition and fees for a recruit at another school.</li>
<li>Bliss's encouragement of school boosters to donate to a foundation tied to a basketball team that included prospective Baylor recruits.</li>
<li>Failure to report positive drug test results by athletes.</li>
<li>Failure by the entire coaching staff to "exercise institutional control over the basketball program."</li>
</ul>
<p>Other improprieties of a lesser nature were also discovered.</p>
<p>As a result, the school imposed further penalties on their basketball program. The program's probation was extended for an additional year, scholarships were reduced for the 2004-<a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">05</a> and 2005-<a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">06</a> seasons, expense-paid recruiting visits were also reduced for the next two seasons and other recruiting abilities were also inhibited, one exhibition game was eliminated for the 2004-05 season and Baylor announced they would recertify that all athletics policies would conform to NCAA rules.</p>
<p>Baylor forwarded their findings to the NCAA, who imposed further penalties on the school on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_23.html" title="June 23">June 23</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The university's probation was extended from three years to five. Baylor will remain on probation until <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_22.html" title="June 22">June 22</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/1/2010.html" title="2010">2010</a>.</li>
<li>Baylor will be barred from playing any nonconference games for the 2005-06 season.</li>
<li>The NCAA further reduced Baylor's paid recruiting visits from twelve to nine for the 2006-07 season. (Baylor had already imposed restrictions on recruiting visits for the 2004-05 and 2005-06 seasons.)</li>
<li>In addition, other smaller penalties were also imposed on Baylor.</li>
