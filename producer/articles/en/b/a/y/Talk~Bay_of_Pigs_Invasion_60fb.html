<dd>You're right that some of your edits are perfectly fine, but some are questionable or unimportant, some pov and some even plain wrong. Also, it's not a good idea to just throw out text without an explanation. It's true that it isn't fair that <i>all</i> your changes are reverted (not just Davenbelle in this case, also Ruy Lopez). I suppose the reason is previous experience with your edits. But, like I said elsewhere, if you're 'changing your ways' then you deserve a second chance (call me a weak lefty (which I'm not), but I truly believe in second chances). It would be nice if the others were more specific in their reverts, so you can see which edits are considered acceptable (by them, at least). I've given that a try. Some issues:</dd>

<dl>
<dd>It seems to make more sense to spell the U.S. as US or USA. I'd say that's standard; you also write 'USSR' and 'laser'. By the way, why is the article on the country not titled 'United States of America'?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>How the invasion led to the <a href="../../../c/u/b/Cuban_Missile_Crisis_79ac.html" title="Cuban Missile Crisis">Cuban Missile Crisis</a> was presented a bit strange. That was indirect; the US attitude pushed Cuba in the hands of the USSR.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I don't think Castro's rhetoric against the US had much to do with the popular support he received (prior to the invasion anyway). That, and the previous and later 'escapes' to the US all had to do with economics (especially in the early 1990's); but at this moment people (those who had stayed) were better off, so why would they support an invasion led by a country that had supported their previous oppressor?</dd>

<dd>My problems: U.S.-backed. This is essentially true (like i said it was true for any non-leftist government back then) but the fact is we had cut off military aid to Batista in 1958, and were hoping for a new government that would neither be communist or embarass us in the way Batista had. Then, you say that the U.S. "pushed Cuba into the USSR's arms." That's a legitimate viewpoint, but it's also a POV one. Maybe he wasn't socialist, but Castro was anti-American from the getgo -- we tried to negotiate with him and he'd just go off and make a fiery speech about U.S. imperialism in Havana. And the revolution started to take an undemocratic bent rather quickly -- see <a href="../../../h/u/b/Huber_Matos_0f20.html" title="Huber Matos">Huber Matos</a> for example, and let's remember that Raul and especially Che were always especially into Marxism. My point is, the article should remain neutral on this point. It should not say the U.S. pushed Castro into the USSR's arms any more than it should say Castro was looking to establish a Soviet-style state since his first revolt in 1953. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrey_Stone_e7d3.html" title="User:Trey Stone">J.

<dd>You say <i>we</i>. Take care not to choose sides. (funny, you also make a point about neutrality&#160;:) ). But to the issues. The relevance of the (previous) US backing is that that (and other US involvements in Latin America) made Castro anti-US. Maybe that point should be made clearer. And the relevance of Castro being pushed into the hands of the USSR is that that led to the Cuban missile crisis, the next confrontation between Cuba and the US (well, really between the US and the USSR). And when Castro first started to lean towards the USSR can not be established, but if it happened years before his 'invasion', then would he not have asked the USSR for help then? <a href="../../../d/i/r/User%7EDirkvdM_f079.html" title="User:DirkvdM">DirkvdM</a> 09:46, 18 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

No if Castro has said he was a communist, this would have raised much trouble since the overt Cuban Communist Party (Partido Socialista Popular), not only supported Batista up to within six months of his defeat, but had low membership and an extremely bad reputation for devious activities such as killing members of its own party e.g. <a href="../../../j/u/l/Julio_Antonio_Mella_62a3.html" title="Julio Antonio Mella">Julio Antonio Mella</a> (see also <a href="../../../v/i/t/Vittorio_Vidali_e92a.html" title="Vittorio Vidali">Vittorio Vidali</a>) and Sandalio Junco, and endless unsavory zig-zags in policy. El Jigüe 12-27-05</p>
<p><br />
And also the concurrent Hungarian rising. As to the Cuban people being better off under Castro, it is quite clear now that they were not and nor would they be in the future, however, then for many propaganda and greed overrode common sense. El Jigüe 12-28-05</p>

<p>In the book that I am reading now (Derek Leebaert's The Fifty Year Wound), he talks about two US planes being shot down, but I didn't see this mentioned in the article.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As would be officially denied for seventeen years, CIA pilots also had perished during the invasion. Two unprotected, unmarked B-26s were shot down because no one on the CIA operations staff remembered that Nicaragua, whence they departed, is in the central time zone, whereas Cuba is in the eastern zon.</p>

<p>The idea that the Castro forces only had few armed sports planes at the Bay of Pigs Invasion (once in the International Law section) is absurd. This kind of misinformation denies any credibility to the author. The matter was corrected. There is a comment on one revision questioning the 1,500 estimate of militia killed in this action.

<p>Reading this over, it seems as if there is a slight controversy between whos fault the Bay of Pigs invasion actually was. But there is no section which states this, and the blame seems to go all to the Kennedy administration, and there are a handful of times where the invasion is called a shameful debacle of the Kennedy administration and so forth...</p>

<p>The text blames Kennedy for the failure of this operation: "under Kennedy's orders critical details were changed that removed any chance of success of the mission without US help." It goes on to say that Kennedy changed the area chosen for the beach assault. I've never heard this before from anyone. Is there support in any reputable Kennedy biography? As far as I know, CIA pushed the plan, perhaps as a way to force overt US support against Castro, and Kennedy was not prepared to deny them. If there is no serious support for Kennedy's role, it should go. Telliott 23:47, 16 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This page should be locked, the historical documents reviewed, and some attempt made to clean up the garbage. The well known facts of the Bay of Pigs invasion begin with it was concocted during the Eisenhower administration and CIA brass lied to the incoming Kennedy administration and obfuscated their reports so that Kennedy's administration were fooled into extending provisional support for a clearly doomed project. Not that Kennedy wasn't easily prey to anti-Castro schemes, but no one acquainted with the facts of the scheme expected success. Read the CIA report. Of course all the auto-biographies of Kennedy administration members touch on the topic as well.</p>
<p>There's an awful lot of "Kennedy aministration subverted it this way, Kennedy administration subverted it that way", none of which can be supported by historical reference because it's simply untrue. Most of the cited changes originated within the CIA. Lord knows there's plenty to criticise about the Kennedy administration, but we do ourselves no favors by blindly incorporating Ann Coulter's speeches into the project.</p>
<p>"Under Kennedy's orders critical details were changed that removed any chance of success of the mission without US help." So, author is alleging there was some other never-published plan in which the invasion could succeed without US help? etc.</p>
<p>imho: the failure of the CIA was primarily one of wishful thinking and groupthink, somewhat akin to cherry-picking intelligence failures w/ Chalabi (an Iranian agent) leading up to the Iraq war. The failure of the Kennedy Administration seems to me more like the Columbia disaster or 9/11: there were people on the inside who suspected the truth in time, but out of a fear of violating protocols, tromping on toes, offending other agencies they (or their bureaucratic superiors) ended up letting it all play out.</p>
<p>I also think these exile-driven schemes should get some demographic analysis. In part the Bay of Pigs was about former plantation owners lobbying Congressmen and officials to help them reclaim their family property, but to what extent was it motivated by a desire to return to the plantation lifestyle?</p>

<p>Aviation is commonly considered the deciding factor during the Bay of Pigs Invasion. The first airplane of the Cuban Armed forces was obtained in 1913; Cuban pilots, such as Francisco Terry Sánchez and Santiago Campuzano fought combat missions as early as WW I <a href="http://www.nocastro.com/documents/aviacion/aviacion1.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nocastro.com/documents/aviacion/aviacion1.htm" rel="nofollow">[15]</a>. The 1931 Gibara landing against Machado was defeated in great part by Cuban Aviation <a href="http://www.nocastro.com/documents/aviacion/aviacion2.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nocastro.com/documents/aviacion/aviacion2.htm" rel="nofollow">[16]</a>. However, by the end of January 1959 most Cuban pilots and support technicians from the Batista era were in jail <a href="http://www.cidh.oas.org/annualrep/80.81sp/Cuba4677.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cidh.oas.org/annualrep/80.81sp/Cuba4677.htm" rel="nofollow">[17]</a> or in exile.</p>
<p><br />
During the Bay of Pigs invasion, the first Cuban exile attack with B-26 left Castro forces with "two B-26C, two Sea Furies, and two T-33A at San Antonio de los Baños Airbase, and only one Sea Fury at the Antonio Maceo Airport" and two of the attacking bombers were damaged <a href="http://www.aeroflight.co.uk/waf/americas/cuba/Cuba-af-history.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.aeroflight.co.uk/waf/americas/cuba/Cuba-af-history.htm" rel="nofollow">[18]</a></p>
<p><br />
Some Castro pilots Alvaro Galo (fired his rockets into the water Lagas p. 93) and Willy Figueroa were jailed for cowardice (see also ibid p. 04), for not flying B-26 (Lagas p. 60); Captain Evans was accused of poisoning crews and also jailed (Lagas, p. 89).</p>
<p><br />
Castro force pilots included Carlos Ulloa Rauz who was Nicaraguan; Jaques Lagas who flew a B-26 and survived is from Chile' Alfredo Noa died in battle in a plane piloted by Luis A. Silva Tablada (ibid p. 61) also killed (ibid p. 63). Of course Rafael del Pino (ibid p. 64). de Varens died in a B-26 accident in Camaguey (ibid p. 90). Laga (ibid p. 78) lists dead Castro fliers as: Noa, Silva, Ulloa (also p. 104), Martin Torres (ibid p. 97), Reinaldo Gonzalez Calainada (ibid p. 97), and Orestes Acosta (in Santiago flying a T-33). On page 81 Lagas mentions Enrique Carrera Rola (T-33) and Gustavo Borzac (a Seafury pilot, who did not fire his rockets, ibid p. 98).</p>
<p><br />
On page 82 Lagas mentions 16 exile planes in first attack, presumable B-26 bombers. Kraus mentions eight B-26 piloted by Cuban exiles <a href="http://www.aeroflight.co.uk/waf/americas/cuba/Cuba-af-history.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.aeroflight.co.uk/waf/americas/cuba/Cuba-af-history.htm" rel="nofollow">[19]</a>. Lagas (p. 88) mentions Castro pilot Alberto Fernandez (T-33). Juan Suarez Plaza (B-26 ibid p. 109) Ernesto Carrera is mentioned as flying a Seafury (ibid p. 108), and another Nicaraguan (ibid p.137); Seafuries were also flown by Castro pilots including Douglas Rood and Sanchez de Mola (Lagas p. 59). Lagas (p. 121) states he was the only B-26 pilot left on the 19th of April. By April 21 ten of twelve exile B-26B had been destroyed <a href="http://www.aeroflight.co.uk/waf/americas/cuba/Cuba-af-history.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.aeroflight.co.uk/waf/americas/cuba/Cuba-af-history.htm" rel="nofollow">[20]</a>, this seems to have been when the four US pilots (Alabama National Guard pilots?). replacing exhausted Cuban exile pilots were killed. Eight Castro pilots survived, only one from the B-26 (Lagas p. 141). El Jigue 2-15-07208.65.188.149 18:06, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

This frontal attack of men against machines (the enemy tanks) had nothing to do with guerrilla war; in fact it was a Russian tactic, probably the idea of the two Soviet generals, both of Spanish origin (they fought for the Republic in the Spanish Civil War and fled to the Soviet Union to later fight in World War II. One of them was a veteran, a fox named Ciutah* (*p. 182 a.k.a. Ángel Martínez). He was sent by the Red Army and the Party as an advisor and was the father of the new Cuban army. He was the only person who could have taken charge of the Girón campaign. The other Hispano-Russian general was an expert in antiguerrilla war who ran the Escambray cleanup. But the real factor in our favor at Girón was the militias: Almejeira’s column embarked on a suicide mission, they were massacred but they reached the beach.”</li>
