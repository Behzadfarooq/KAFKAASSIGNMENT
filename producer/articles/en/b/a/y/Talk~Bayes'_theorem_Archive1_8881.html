<p>I thought that the definition of conditional probability, in a strict mathematical sense, is "Bayes' Theorem". That is, this is really a definition, and the proof is a justification of why this definition applies to real-world situations.</p>
<p>That is, the definitition of P(A | B) = P(A intersect B) / P(B). The conclusions are just algebraic maniupulation of this definition.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, you <i>can</i> easily get Bayes' Theorem by manipulating the definition of conditional probability in a simple way: but the deep question, when you've done the derivation, is <i>what does this mean?</i> This leads to the two schools of <a href="../../../b/a/y/Bayesianism.html" title="Bayesianism">Bayesianism</a> and <a href="../../../f/r/e/Frequentism.html" title="Frequentism">Frequentism</a>, and leads most people to a complete re-examination of the idea of probability. The axiomatic approach to probability is one get-out. Declaring the problem to be a non-problem is another. Becoming a Bayesian is the most common option.</dd>
</dl>
<hr />
<p>Bayes' theorem is equally valid from the frequentist and Bayesian perspectives. What is not valid according to frequentism is the assignment to hypotheses, of probabilities that admit no frequency interpretation, such as the proposition that there was life on Mars a billion years ago, or that the mass of the planet Neptune is between two specified quantities. But before anyone says Bayes' theorem is at most trivially different from the definition of conditional probability, it must be remembered that there is a <i>continuous</i> version of Bayes' theorem, which say how to get the posterior probability density when given the prior density and the likelihood function. -- Mike Hardy</p>
<hr />
<p>Removed the text:</p>
<p>The correct punctuation is Bayes's theorem although loose use of the apostrophe appears to be common in the field, including many textbooks and the net. There was only one Reverend Bayes, and singular nouns always take apostrope-s to denote posession. See apostrophe. The formal rule is unambiguous.</p>
<p>1) It is not relevant to the article itself and spoils the flow.</p>
<p>2) It is incorrect. The use of the apostrophe in <i>Bayes' Theorem</i> is covered in <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apostrophe_%28punctuation%29.html" title="Apostrophe (punctuation)">Apostrophe_(punctuation)</a> under the fourth point of <b>Things to Note</b>.</p>

<p><br />
I guess it does spoil the flow of the text...still, check this out (from The Phrase Finder, <a href="http://phrases.shu.ac.uk/" class="external free" title="http://phrases.shu.ac.uk/" rel="nofollow">http://phrases.shu.ac.uk/</a> (and, mea culpa, I didn't read the wiki entry on <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apostrophe.html" title="Apostrophe">apostrophe</a> properly... I just assumed it'd agree with standard usage (cringe&#160;;-)</p>
<p><br />
From "A Manual of Style" (12th ed., University of Chicago Press, 1969): The possessive case of singular nouns is formed by the addition of an apostrophe and an "s," and the possessive of plural nouns (except for a few irregular plurals) by the addition of an apostrophe only. This general rule is well understood and for common nouns needs no examples to illustrate its application. There is only one notable exception to the rule for common nouns, a case wherein tradition and euphony dictate the use of the apostrophe only: for appearance' (conscience', righteousness', etc.) sake</p>
<p>PROPER NOUNS. The general rule covers proper nouns as well as common, including most names of any length ending in sibilants: Burns's poems, Marx's theories, Czar Nicholas's assassination, . . . , Dickens's novels, PLURAL: the Rosses' and the Williamses' lands</p>
<p>Exceptions are the names "Jesus" and "Moses" and Greek (or hellenized) names of more than one syllable ending in "es": Jesus' nativity, Moses' leadership, Euripides' plays, Demosthenes' orations, Rameses' tomb, Xerxes' army</p>
<p><br />
YMMV</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Hi there, 152.78.0.29 - at least I presume it's you!&#160;;-)</p>
<p>My Fowler's <i>Modern English Usage</i> gives the clue as to why it's <i>Bayes' Theorem</i> and not <i>Bayes's Theorem</i>:</p>
<p>"It was formerly customary, when a word ended in -s, to write its possessive with an apostrophe but no additional s."</p>
<p>That's why those forms like <i>Jesus' nativity</i> hang around. Because <i>Bayes' Theorem</i> has been around a long time, it's still got its original possessive, which is now set in stone. I have a maths degree and it was always <i>Bayes' Theorem</i> and never <i>Bayes's Theorem</i> though I do agree that the latter form would be the correct one if the theorem were named today.</p>
<p>However, it's rather difficult to work that info into the article without going into a long digression about the history of the apostrophe, so I took the easy option and reverted it.</p>
<p>BTW, you can easily sign your contributions in talk by using four ~ (I can't write that in full here else it'll just replace it with my signature!) See <a href="../../../t/a/l/Wikipedia%7ETalk_page_a6d3.html" title="Wikipedia:Talk page">Wikipedia:Talk_page</a> for info on it.</p>

<dd>When did it cease to be customary? Fowler wrote in the 1920s. I am not aware that that practice is no longer standard. I suspect that is because I am an American: We still write "Mr. Smith" rather than "Mr Smith" and we still call that particular punctuation mark a "period" rather than by the more recent name "full stop". <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Hardy_e932.html" title="User:Michael Hardy">Michael Hardy</a> 23:08, 27 Dec 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Spellbinder. Thanks for the "~" tip (and indeed the Talk_page tip). I'm very new to wiki and am feeling my way around here; I figure the best way to learn is to try things out!</p>
<p>[the other thing I haven't yet worked out is how to get email notification of when a page is changed. I presume it's possible (unless people hit the "reload" button every five minutes). How does this work?]</p>

<p>I've added some historical discussion, including a statement of Bayes's main result. Only problem is -- why does the formula (Prop 9) appear as LaTeX source instead of being rendered? I put it inside "langle math rangle" brackets but it didn't work. Can anyone fix it or tell me how? <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWile_E._Heresiarch_9879.html" title="User:Wile E.

<hr />
<p>This article is a bit disorganized.</p>
<ul>
<li>"Justification for Bayes' theorem" treads the same ground as "Bayes' theorem in probability theory".</li>
<li>There's an example, some additional technical discussion, and then another example.</li>
<li>"A worked example" has something about cookies and then a discussion of likelihood functions.</li>
<li>"Bayesianism" is all the way at the end of the article.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's how I would suggest editing it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Strike "Justification for Bayes' theorem" section.</li>
<li>Put both examples in one section, and put that section just before the end of the article.</li>
<li>Move discussion of likelihood functions (now under "A worked example") into the technical discussion.</li>
<li>Move "Bayesianism" to just after the technical discussion and before the examples, since Bayesianism is an interpretation of the just-described rule of algebra which justifies the examples.</li>
</ul>

<p>I've made some minor changes.</p>
<ol>
<li>Struck "Its discrete version may appear to go little beyond an identity...". This doesn't mean anything; every algebraic identity is a tautology, and so it "doesn't go beyond" the axioms and assumptions it's derived from. I think the original author meant to say it's a simple theorem, and I that's how I stated it elsewhere in the article.</li>
<li>Rephrased "A frequent error is to think..." -- whether the identification of Bayesianism with Bayes' rule is an error, is beside the point; the point is to very briefly state what Bayesianism is about. I've done so.</li>
<li>Rephrased "... while it says nothing 'new' ...". Same issue as first point above.</li>
<li>Explicitly stated a derivation of the theorem. Yes, it's short, but important enough to try to make sure everybody gets it.</li>
<li>Reworked the stuff around "often embellished using the [[law of total probability]]:". As noted in <a href="../../../l/a/w/Law_of_total_probability.html" title="Law of total probability">law of total probability</a>, the term is ambiguous; it seems unwarranted to appeal to a "law of total probability" in a derivation.</li>
</ol>

<p>I erased some comments that referred to old versions of the article. The page history still has them of course.

<p>(i) I see that the equation near the top (under "Proposition 9 in the essay") has had the binomial coefficients struck out. I put them in originally because I was following Covarrubias's gloss (link at bottom of article) and he shows those coefficients. I would like to make the equation in the article accurately represent what Bayes wrote. However, on looking at the essay again, I can't tell for sure whether they're needed or not -- Bayes phrased everything in terms of geometric figures, and it's hard for me to map it into algebra. I'll study the essay some more and see if I can't figure it out. (ii) FWIW I don't think the use of the forward slash is an improvement over writing it numerator above denominator. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWile_E._Heresiarch_9879.html" title="User:Wile E. Heresiarch">Wile E. Heresiarch</a> 03:31, 7 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I've reverted the equation under "Proposition 9" to the form which contains the binomial coefficients. This is consistent with Stigler's exposition. (See Stigler 1982 in the refs.) I also looked at the original essay, and, although it is quite difficult to read, I see that Rule 1 (for computation) contains a term E, and "E being the coefficient of a^p b^q when (a + b)^n is expanded". I speculate that Bayes didn't see the binomial coefficients could be canceled, since he didn't actually write out the formula in the manner shown in the article. The whole topic of "what did Bayes prove", it turns out, is quite subtle; in fact, it's not clear that Bayes was a Bayesian. But that's a debate for another article. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWile_E._Heresiarch_9879.html" title="User:Wile E. Heresiarch">Wile E. Heresiarch</a> 19:57, 7 Jan 2004 (UTC)</li>

<p>Hello. I've reverted the change, dated 23:04, 16 Feb 2004, made to the paragraph "What is Bayesian about Proposition 9..." to the previous revision. The changed text stated, "That is, one assigns probabilities not to events that are random, to propositions that are uncertain, and the same algebra is used as in <a href="../../../f/r/e/Frequentism.html" title="Frequentism">frequentist</a> statistical inference." (1) Bayes did in fact assign probabilities to events, so the distinction made here doesn't apply to Bayes. (2) Bringing frequentism into the picture is a digression; the important point is that for Bayes, there was a single reasoning method which covered both the event and the parameter that governs it.

<hr />
<p>BTW I like the stuff that <a href="../../../m/i/g/User%7EMiguel_74e3.html" title="User:Miguel">User:Miguel</a> put in about how Bayes' side-stepped some difficulties about the interpretation of the result. I am considering adding a heading to the <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Bayes_3ee9.html" title="Thomas Bayes">Thomas Bayes</a> article -- "Was Bayes a Bayesian?" Maybe someone else would like to do that! In this context the remarks by Stigler (JRSS Series A, 145:250-258, 1982) are especially relevant.

<dd>I did not read the original article by Bayes, but rather the corresponding entry in
<dl>
<dd>I. Todhunter, <i>A History of the Mathematical Theory of Probability from the time of Pascal to that of Laplace</i> (1865).</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Looking back at my notes (translated into Spanish by myself from Todhunter) it seems that Bayes stated his question in Bayesian terms but then set out to solve it by <i>assuming</i> it is equivalent to the statement involving billiard balls. A frequentist could then argue that Bayes' original question is meaningless, and therefore not equivalent to the question about billiard balls. I'd like to get a copy of Todhunter from the library and track down the actual statement. Even better would be to get Bayes' article, which was reprinted as

<dd>I've gone ahead and put a "Was Bayes a Bayesian?" section in the <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Bayes_3ee9.html" title="Thomas Bayes">Thomas Bayes</a> article.

<p>Hello. I wonder if the examples section can be tightened up by removing the cookies example. The medical test example is no more difficult, and a lot more interesting. I welcome your comments. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWile_E._Heresiarch_9879.html" title="User:Wile E. Heresiarch">Wile E. Heresiarch</a> 02:29, 8 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I don't think that removing the cookie example is necessary. It is a `toy' example, yes, but it is easy to understand. The medical test example is more realistic and interesting, but contains concepts (false positives) with which the lay reader may not be instantly familiar. I don't think simple-but-dull examples detract from articles such as this one; the more the merrier. <a href="../../../b/j/c/User%7EBjcairns_871c.html" title="User:Bjcairns">Ben Cairns</a> 13:37, 12 Apr 2004 (UTC)</dd>
