<p>The text on the discussion page above is POV. I vote for <b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../s/a/c/User%7ESachindole_3163.html" title="User:Sachindole">doles</a> 18:00, 2005 Mar 7 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I am not sure about what is the policy of deletion on talk pages and whether POV text can be deleted on the talk pages. But if you can cite me relevant guidelines i will be more than happy to support your delete request as i think the above text is just patent nonsense. <a href="../../../k/a/a/User%7EKaal_8f50.html" title="User:Kaal">kaal</a> 19:15, 7 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I guess policy is as similar on other things - put out a request, wait for a good amount of time (5 days?) and then do what you have to do. By the way, i just have a hunch that some anonymous person is relentlessly trying to bring in POV stuff onto the article and talk page. anyways.
<ul>
<li>well you can nominate it for <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_b940.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion">VFD</a>. Let me know if you have a problem with the process. This article is constantly vandalized by anon users one way or the other. It simple cannot be helped. So keep an eye on it. <a href="../../../k/a/a/User%7EKaal_8f50.html" title="User:Kaal">kaal</a> 21:31, 8 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Please don't clutter VfD more than it already is. I think it's reasonable to leave the text here for a week, and if noone has objected, delete it. If someone has objected, we'll just determine the group consensus. <code><a href="../../../f/o/o/User%7EFoobaz_6eee.html" title="User:Foobaz">Foobaz</a>·<a href="../../../f/o/o/User_talk%7EFoobaz_50d5.html" title="User talk:Foobaz">o&lt;</a></code> 23:03, 8 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>&#160;: Religious/ethnic/ethnoreligious-based websites are allowed. So are most partisan websites. Only Extremist ones are not. Indian Muslims in in <i>no way</i> an extremist organization. They only provide news on the lifestyle and Muslim-related incidents. However, hinuunity and hvk both have an anti-Muslim agenda- <i>"Muslims out of india will result in peace"</i> and the like. Provide one extremist or hateful quote from IndianMuslims, and then you disqualify the site. <a href="../../../b/a/s/User%7EBasawala_1ef6.html" title="User:Basawala"><font color="forestgreen"><b>Mar de Sin</b></font></a> <a href="../../../b/a/s/User_talk%7EBasawala_bd91.html" title="User talk:Basawala"><font color="navy"><sup><b>Talk to me!</b></sup></font></a> 00:52, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>HvK merely cites news sources. Its called compromise and treating partisan sites with caution.

<dd>US govt has declared al-Jazeera to be a terrorist front. Plus, hvk is not extremist (maybe HinduUnity, but not hvk). I'm afraid it's still a double standard. Plus, al-Jazeera articles also attest that Jewish people are cannibals etc. and other such anti-Semitism and anti-Semitic cartoons are also there on al-Jazeera so it is also hate.<a href="../../../h/k/e/User%7EHkelkar_b268.html" title="User:Hkelkar">Hkelkar</a> 00:55, 10 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Al-Jazeerah is of course biased. Still, you haven't proved why Sabrang or Indianmuslims are extremist.

<dd>No it is not. I looked at the diff of several articles and any refs to hvk were removed. Plus, indianmuslims is partisan and does not have the required criteria for reliability (no fact checking teams, no qualified journalists etc.). It is, at best, an advocacy organisation and, at worst, an extremist front.

<dd>As I remembered, IndM provided newspaper sources (which were established ones) they paraphrased from, and you still haven't found out why IndianMuslim is unreliable. All the info on it was correct. And worse, you also stated that the words <i>Indian Muslim</i> <i>itself</i> proved an Islamic POV, forgetting that the recognized news source <i>the Hindu</i> did not prove a Hindu POV. You said that on account of your own prejudice, unless you also think that the words <i>the Hindu</i> prove a Hindu POV.

<dd>Ah, but the Hindu is often and regularly cited on wikipedia and is recognized as a legit source. The Hindu does not make any Bias towards Hinduism because in "the Hindu" Hindu means Indian (from "Hind" ie the Indus) not those people who believe in Hinduism. In fact, many Hindus accuse "the Hindu" of being anti-Hindu (heh!). Since there is no ambiguity in the term "Muslim" it is clear that they have an Islamic POV (else they wouldn;t say "Muslim" in their title). I'm afraid I'll have to stand by my claim of unreliability and double standards on your part. This is similar to the debate over the "Christian Science Monitor", which is often accused of Christian POV. However, it is established that they have professional journalists etc. It is also established for Israeli Newspapers with Judaistic names like Haaretz in Israel etc. It is NOT explicitly established for indianmuslims so, until it is, it's POV. However, it can be stated with qualification (Indian muslims allege that...).

<p>I did not claim OR, since I never explicitly stated that the maps were directly related to BD, just that they were found, "at the house of one of the deceased".

<p>I'll take apart the sentence for you.</p>
<ul>
<li>In "maps of a few Mosques situated in nearby districts", they are talking about the mosque not the house. Otherwise they would use "from houses in nearby districts" or something like that.</li>
<li>It is clear however, that "nearby districts" refers to the mosque. They were seized "from the houses of the accused", not anywhere else. There is no way that "nearby districts from" would refer to near the houses. "Nearby from" is not generally used in English that often.</li>
<li>And anyways, "situated" directly means that the mosques were "situated in nearby districts".</li>
<li>My last point is of logic: Why would the police care to check houses near to the accused? And why would pucl note that the accused's neighbor(s) had maps of mosques? Logic tells us the maps were "from the houses of the accused"</li>
</ul>
<p>I really thing the quote is pretty clear, and that your argument is not well supported. And please don't try to get this debate off track into the depths of English sentence structure, and just throw away human logic. <a href="../../../b/a/s/User%7EBasawala_1ef6.html" title="User:Basawala"><font color="forestgreen"><b>Mar de Sin</b></font></a> <a href="../../../b/a/s/User_talk%7EBasawala_bd91.html" title="User talk:Basawala"><font color="navy"><sup><b>Talk to me!</b></sup></font></a> 20:05, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Why should "nearby districts" to the mosque?This is not clear to me at all.Bear in mind that Indian English is often subject to it's own grammatical rules.</li>
<li>So?</li>
<li>The problem is that Indian media, as well as Indian Authorities, are not exactly known for their great leaps of logic. Often, statements that, in on themselves, make absolutely no sense whatsoever are touted by Indian media solely on the basis of their authority.Thus, if certain statements contain ambiguities, then they should be handled with care on wikipedia.<a href="../../../h/k/e/User%7EHkelkar_b268.html" title="User:Hkelkar">Hkelkar</a> 23:08, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>My views were a <i>logical interpretation</i> of the sentence, and <b>not</b> any type of "original research". Let othe Wikipedians decided if the statement is clear or not.

<dd>And grammar isn't the only thing to interpret the sentence, from the context of the article, you would know that the maps were found <b>at</b> the houses of the accused, not in a nearby district.

<dd>As I have stated on a talkpage elsewhere, the first of the above linked articles discusses an earlier event, in 2000, and the second clearly implies that there has been a police coverup (without mentioning the LeT in that connection), which possibility has already been indicated in the article. They are irrelevant. The above editors should note that exchanging personal attacks can easily be done off Wikipedia. <a href="../../../h/o/r/User%7EHornplease_3cdc.html" title="User:Hornplease">Hornplease</a> 07:01, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>Don't play the fool. The articles clearly mention LeT to allude to the possibility that it is they who were involved in Nanded. Furthermore, the statement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In April 2006, two Bajrang Dal activists were killed in nearby Nandhed in the process of bomb making</p>
</blockquote>
<dl>
<dd>Is POV as the articles say that BD is a SUSPECT, not FORMALLY ESTABLISHED or indicted as the perpetrators.The article cites constantly says "IF BD was involved then... IF BD made the bombs then...",always the conditional. As such, the statement in the wikipedia article is wrong as it uses the affirmative. The affirmative was used only once in the article cited. The fact that they keep switching from affirmative to conditional shows A) that the article is typical shoddy journalism from the liberal left, and 2)They are not sure that BD actually did it. <a href="../../../h/k/e/User%7EHkelkar_b268.html" title="User:Hkelkar">Hkelkar</a> 07:32, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Very simply, your interpretation is simply wrong. There's nothing more to it, and nothing more I can say. You admit that the article says the BD was involved.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Here's what the article says about Nanded:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In April, Bajrang Dal activists Naresh Raj Kondwar and Himanshu Phanse were killed while attempting to fabricate an improvised explosive device along with their fellow extremists Maruti Wagh, Rahul Pande, and Ramraj Guptewar. Investigators later recovered a second bomb from the Nanded home where the bomb-making exercise was under way, and evidence that the extremist had struck before. Maharashtra Police found that Kondwar and Phanse were the key figures in the April 2006 bombing of a mosque at Parbhani, in which 25 persons were injured. Bajrang Dal operatives linked to the Nanded terror cell, investigators believe, also carried out the bombing of mosques at Purna and Jalna in April 2003. Eighteen persons sustained injuries in these twin attacks. What disturbed the Maharashtra Police most about the Nanded explosion, though, was that it demonstrated the Bajrang Dal's growing bomb-making capabilities. In an interview to the magazine Communalism Combat earlier this year, K.P. Raghuvanshi, Joint Commissioner of Police, Maharashtra Anti-Terrorism Squad, admitted that the Nanded incident could have "frightening repercussions."</p>

<dd>There are no two ways of interpreting those passages.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>And as for your statement that the articles you quoted imply that the LeT was responsible for the 2006 Nanded blast, that is <b>simply not borne out by the articles</b>. I cant imagine what might make you think that it is other than wishful thinking. <a href="../../../h/o/r/User%7EHornplease_3cdc.html" title="User:Hornplease">Hornplease</a> 10:42, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>HKelkar, your sources only briefly mention Nanded and only say that the LeT have operations in Nanded, and not the Bajrang Dal bomb blasts. Until you can pinpoint where you think they mention that, then your statement is false. <a href="../../../b/a/s/User%7EBasawala_1ef6.html" title="User:Basawala"><font color="forestgreen"><b>Mar de Sin</b></font></a> <a href="../../../b/a/s/User_talk%7EBasawala_bd91.html" title="User talk:Basawala"><font color="navy"><sup><b>Talk to me!</b></sup></font></a> 13:18, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Have you an answer, then? The 2006 Nanded blast had nothing to do with the LeT according to your sourced articles. Do you agree to that much? <a href="../../../h/o/r/User%7EHornplease_3cdc.html" title="User:Hornplease">Hornplease</a> 23:15, 14 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, you have been proved wrong about that. Do you understand? There is nothing in those articles that supports your statements. The article is about two different occasions, and the history of Nanded. About the particular explosion, there is <i>no mention</i> of the LeT. you have not been able to cite any articles that do mention the LeT in that context.
