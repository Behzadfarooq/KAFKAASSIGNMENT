<p>Any one comparing the whole Bajoran - Cardassian thing to the Israeli Arab conflict and stating that this is fact is misimformed &amp; is being offensive to the Star Trek story. The Cardassians do not resemvle the Natzis &amp; certainly not the Israelis' either. If you knew any history and politics youd know this, but obviously, u don't. As for comparing to any one current terorist movement, please feel free to read Rick Bermans comment bellow. Stop mixing reality with Fantasy- you ruin it for every one. besides which , u promote your own ignorance on these matters. If you want to Know The history &amp; current situation of the Israely Arab conflict as well as WW2 history, do your homework &amp; study it impartially, don't bring your personal midiea based information which has no relation to the truth. Leave Star Trek out of your Politics &amp; your politics out of Star tTrek. This decussion is immensly offensive on so many levels, so just keep it to your self!!!!</p>
<p>A really angree Star Trek lover.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<hr />
<p>KAZvorpal -- please stop being aspergian and keep your politics to an appropriate forum.</p>
<p>The entry you keep corrupting is a statement of fact. If you don't like it, that's your own political problem.<a href="../../../k/a/z/User%7EKazvorpal_d66f.html" title="User:Kazvorpal">Kaz</a> 18:08, 7 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>It is far from a statement of fact. The forced labor aspect in the paragraph topic sentence makes it a palpably false anology. Even if the ST writers were thinking along these lines (which I doubt), what they came up with is a hybred. Unless you can come up with a quote; you are projecting a political opinion (which you are certainly entitled to have); however, you are doing so in an inappropriate topic. Keep the entry relevant and true. BTW, are you still wearing the mullet? Jinxian</p>
<ul>
<li>The internment camp reference actually fits in quite well, since that's where the Israeli government keeps hundreds of thousands of the Palestinians. When you see references to Israeli troops raiding or shelling camps with missiles, tanks, and bulldozers, that's what they're talking about.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>If you do a Google search for the words "bajoran" and "Palestinian", the 130+ links you come up with almost all refer to the relationship between them...and other keyword combinations produce other, similar pages. A little effort will reveal references to the intent of the show's makers to make this analogy.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>That you have some bizarre obsession with denying this is your own problem. I guess it's inevitable that some Kaz stalkers show up here... <a href="../../../k/a/z/User%7EKazvorpal_d66f.html" title="User:Kazvorpal">Kaz</a> 21:56, 7 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p><br />
Come on, KAZ. Give me one authoritative source, i.e, from the shows writers or producers. Otherwise, you know as well as I do, it's just idle speculation on the part of fans. You of all people should know that relying on the number of hits is resorting to the "Big Lie" concept. I would expect you (as a "published" writter) to have more respect for the use of language, i.e., your claim of "as written". BTW, I'll admit to being defensive about Isreal, but I restrict my discussion on that point to where I find it. Your compulsion to insert propaganda in inappropriate topics strikes me as odd. But I'd be happy to keep this discourse on civil terms.</p>
<p>And, you didn't answer my question about the mullet&#160;:-)</p>
<ul>
<li>As I said, you can find references to the producers'/writers' intent if you dig through all the trekkies' pages. Personally, I'm not enough of a fanboy to do it for you.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Personally, I'm not inserting propoganda, but observing a fact. I will do so even if it's "my side" which looks bad; it's foolish and bigoted to defend something out of personal reasons in a setting like this. You won't find <i>me</i> deleting valid points which are embarassing to something with which I associate. It's a sign of a sort of bigotry.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The strangest thing about the Kaz stalkers, even more than their strange obsession with adding factoids about me as if they were relevent to a debate..."You're wrong about the application of Say's Law here: You used to work in a pet store!" is their bizarre tendency to get those irrelevent-yet-apparently-precious facts wrong. I never had a mullet; I've always had long hair all the way around my head, but often french braid the hair on top and the sides of my head, to keep it out of my eyes, while leaving the back free. For stalkers obsessed purely with knowing me by my photos online, this can be mistaken for a mullet. Especially if they have enough of a provincial mindset, themselves. <a href="../../../k/a/z/User%7EKazvorpal_d66f.html" title="User:Kazvorpal">Kaz</a></dd>

That answer about the mullet told me everything about you I need to know. Go in peace.</p>

<p>Actually, I have the Executive producer from DS9 on my side, and half the Star Trek viewers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Executive Producer Michael Piller explains her origins as well as the beginnings of DS9: "We had created the Ensign Ro character last season and created a set of aliens in the Bajorans and the Cardassians and a situation that was sort of a Palestinian- or Israeli- or American Indian-tale situation of a disenfranchised people dominated for years." <a href="http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1430/is_n5_v15/ai_13346687" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1430/is_n5_v15/ai_13346687" rel="nofollow">[3]</a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>"This is TNG's take on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict" <a href="http://www.starfleetlibrary.com/tng/tng5/ensign_ro.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.starfleetlibrary.com/tng/tng5/ensign_ro.htm" rel="nofollow">[4]</a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The Bajoran/Cardassian conflict always seemed like a veiled allegory for the Palestinian/Israeli conflict. The Bajoran people resort to terrorist/guerrilla tactics to combat an oppressive occupying group<a href="http://www.atpobtvs.com/existentialscoobies/archives/apr04_p07.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.atpobtvs.com/existentialscoobies/archives/apr04_p07.html" rel="nofollow">[5]</a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The Bajorans were created to be synonymous with some modern-day terrorists. This is evident in Ro's speech while in conference with the other senior officers on board the Enterprise, which paints a picture of Bajorans that is reminiscent of the situation as it has been in the Middle East for years. Much of the Bajoran settlement that Picard, Worf, Data, and Ro visit is reminiscent of the Palestinian resettlement camps.<a href="http://www.epinions.com/content_101903142532" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.epinions.com/content_101903142532" rel="nofollow">[6]</a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>There is also a hugely-missed subplot here, folks. The Bajorans were originally introduced as ST's version of the Palestinians, fighting for their freedom from the wicked and much bigger and more supplied Cardassian foes. <a href="http://www.doctorweevil.org/archives/000084.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.doctorweevil.org/archives/000084.html" rel="nofollow">[7]</a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I always saw the Cardassian Occupation and the Bajoran Resistance as Israel and Palestine. The Cardassians were the Israeli's, in being an occupying force striving to hold onto what they have, and the Bajoran's being the Palestinians; desperate enough to do whatever it takes to hold onto whatever they could and if they could hold onto to anything they'd do the next best thing...kill Cardassians... <a href="http://kier.3dfrontier.com/forums/archive/index.php/t-33331" class="external autonumber" title="http://kier.3dfrontier.com/forums/archive/index.php/t-33331" rel="nofollow">[8]</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I could go on...I can list literally hundreds of references as much or more authoritative as the ONE you list.</p>
<p>The NPoV Bajoran=Palestinian observation stays, and I'm fixing the Cardassian page to be as accurate, too. <a href="../../../k/a/z/User%7EKazvorpal_d66f.html" title="User:Kazvorpal">Kaz</a> 00:47, 9 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The link has been made by some, but your POV on the conflict is not relevant to the article. Quote the people in question. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> | <a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><small>(Talk)</small></a> 01:01, 9 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The link is fact...your own PoV motivation is demonstrated by that vague "some" admission...as if it were still debatable when I'm citing a Star Trek producer. It's also revealed any time someone finds one wording acceptable, but when the opposite is proved then suddenly claims the SAME wording, simply with the roles reversed, is somehow PoV. I took the existing wording and simply placed the Palestinian/Israeli reference in it, and <i>now</i> it's PoV, when it wasn't before?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The simple fact is that we often put something in our own words...this is not an encyclopedia purely of quotations. There's nothing PoV about the way I put it...which I worked out with a self-professed Israel defender...and it goes back. <a href="../../../k/a/z/User%7EKazvorpal_d66f.html" title="User:Kazvorpal">Kaz</a> 01:48, 9 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The "some" means <b>one</b> Star Trek producer, and actually, it's your POV, and the exact quote says something else than what you claim. It refers to U.S. and Indians as well, for one thing. It's a brief quote, and says exactly what it means, as opposed to your re-write, which says something quite different. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> | <a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><small>(Talk)</small></a> 01:52, 9 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually, I was the one who supplied the quote, as a reference. The wording was here <i>before</i> the quote, and is completely valid.

<p>I just reverted this article to an earlier version because of the addition of the sentence about the Israelis and Palestinians, which is not supported by the citation. This is what the cited article says: "We had created the Ensign Ro character last season and created a set of aliens in the Bajorans and the Cardassians and a situation that was sort of a Palestinian- or Israeli- or American Indian-tale situation of a disenfranchised people dominated for years." The Wikipedia article can't expand on that as though paraphrasing the referenced article. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">Slim</a> 03:14, Jan 9, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Again there's some kind of PoV problem revealed by the deletion of the entire section...I have now clarified the paragraph so that the indirect relationship of the quote and the prior description is clear. As with the entire nonsense you guys have been pulling up 'til now, no need to throw out the baby with the bathwater. It starts seeming like you guys just don't like the comparison, no matter how true it is, and are twisting and spinning in order to find an excuse to delete it. <a href="../../../k/a/z/User%7EKazvorpal_d66f.html" title="User:Kazvorpal">Kaz</a> 03:35, 9 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Kaz, you've reverted more than three times in 24 hours. This will get you a 24-hour block if you keep doing it (I'm not an admin, by the way, so that's not a warning, I'm just informing you). Why won't you just let the producer speak for himself? <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">Slim</a> 03:44, Jan 9, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>And what, precisely, am I supposed to do when someone keeps mass-deleting valid text with a completely false excuse given? The text you keep deleting pre-existed the quotation, which <i>I</i> added anyway, and stands as a separate part of the same paragraph, not as an interpretation of what the producer says. It's ridiculous to claim that if a quote is made, then no other text may be added on anything relating to the topic.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Your PoV problem here...that you simply don't like the comparison and want to censor it regardless of its accuracy...is painfully true in your repeated deletion of it en masse, instead of simply putting a paragraph space between it or otherwise clarifying the relationship to your own astoundingly high standards without actually getting rid of the bit which doesn't conform to your PoV <a href="../../../k/a/z/User%7EKazvorpal_d66f.html" title="User:Kazvorpal">Kaz</a> 03:52, 9 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I have no idea what you're talking about. There is a quote from a producer, saying the show is about X. You keep adding a sentence, claiming that really the show is about Y. You're distorting what he said, and so I deleted your interpretive sentence, and left his quote. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">Slim</a> 03:57, Jan 9, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>If that is true, then you have no business being here because you don't know the situation. But even then, one must wonder how you're unable to understand my repeated explanations that the sentence is NOT interpreting the producer, and was here BEFORE the producer's quote, which <i>I added, myself</i>. The text was there BEFORE the quote. The quote was added as a separate reference to the same subject. If you think the two are easily confused, then SEPARATE them better, instead of censoring the part you simply don't like because of your obvious PoV problem <a href="../../../k/a/z/User%7EKazvorpal_d66f.html" title="User:Kazvorpal">Kaz</a> 04:03, 9 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

KAZ, I can see your mouth foaming04:10, 2005 Jan 9 (UTC)</p>
<p>"The Cardassians are written to resemble the Israeli government or Nazis, the Bajorans to resemble Palestinians or Jews: The latter being people occupied or oppressed for decades and struggling to end that condition, sometimes using terrorism and guerrilla tactics, exactly as the Bajorans."

<p>Michael Pillar's comments are in reference to "Ensign Ro", a fifth season episode of TNG. They do not in any way describe the "situation", however they do describe that particular episode. These comments have been removed since they are inaccurate in the context of this article, as those comments refer to a particular episode and not to the Cardassian/Bajoran conflict in general. The user is welcome to add those comments to an article about that episode. --<a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EViriditas_d60b.html" title="User:Viriditas">Viriditas</a> | <a href="../../../v/i/r/User_talk%7EViriditas_82a1.html" title="User talk:Viriditas">Talk</a> 10:36, 9 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>More to the point: The producer, Rick Berman, explained that the Bajorans were not modeled on any particular group: ‘The Kurds, the Palestinians, the Jews in the 1940s, the boat people from Haiti—unfortunately, the homeless and terrorism are problems in every age’ (TNG Companion, p. 178).18:59, 11 Jan 2005 (UTC)~</p>

<dd>Great quote. If you can provide more context that would help. --<a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EViriditas_d60b.html" title="User:Viriditas">Viriditas</a> | <a href="../../../v/i/r/User_talk%7EViriditas_82a1.html" title="User talk:Viriditas">Talk</a> 01:25, 12 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The whole article needs citations.

<p>I think it's worth noting that millions of Trekkies agree that the Bajorans are idealised Palestinians and the Bajor/Cardassian conflict is a mirror in many, many ways as to that of the Palestine/Israeli conflict. The P/I conflict is the only instance in human history that is anywhere near similar to the B/C conflict and is quite visibly a comparative whether intentionally or not. This is backed up by thousands of websites that discuss the topic in depth. <a href="../../../2/1/1/User%7E211.30.71.59.html" title="User:211.30.71.59">211.30.71.59</a> 15:33, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
