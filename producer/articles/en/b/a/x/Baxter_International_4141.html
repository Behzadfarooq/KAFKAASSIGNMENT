<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/x/Baxter_International_4141.html" title="Edit section: History">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
<p>1931 - The company is founded as the first manufacturer of commercially prepared intravenous solutions.</p>
<p>1933 - During its first two years, the company distributed products manufactured by another company in Los Angeles owned by Dr. Donald E. Baxter, a former medical missionary to <a href="../../../c/h/i/China.html" title="China">China</a>. In 1933, the company opened its first manufacturing facility in a renovated automobile showroom in <a href="../../../g/l/e/Glenview%2C_Illinois_ac73.html" title="Glenview, Illinois">Glenview, Illinois</a>. There, six employees turned out the complete line of five solutions in glass containers.</p>
<p>1939 - In 1939, the company, now named Baxter Laboratories, introduced the Transfuso-Vac container, the first sterile, vacuum-type blood collection and storage unit. Before this breakthrough product, blood could be stored for only a few hours; the new container allowed storage for up to 21 days, making blood banking practical for the first time.</p>
<p><br />
<b>The 1940s</b></p>
<p>1941 - When World War II broke out, many of Baxter's blood-collection devices and 25 solutions were the only ones that met the specifications of the U.S. Armed Forces.</p>
<p>The Plasma-Vac container provides the first means of separating plasma from whole blood and storing it for future use.</p>
<p>1945 - A young patent lawyer named William B. Graham joined the company in 1945 as vice president and manager, and in 1953, succeeded founder Ralph Falk as chief executive officer (CEO). In 1945, sales exceed $1.5 million.</p>
<p>1947 - In 1947, the company moved from its Glenview plant to a larger, central base of operations in <a href="../../../m/o/r/Morton_Grove%2C_Illinois_fd1b.html" title="Morton Grove, Illinois">Morton Grove, Illinois</a>.</p>
<p>1948 - In 1948, Dr. Carl Walter, a noted Boston surgeon and co-founder of Fenwal Laboratories, invented the non-breakable Blood-Pack plastic container.</p>
<p><br />
<b>The 1950s</b></p>
<p>1950 - In 1950, the company opened its second U.S. plant, in Cleveland, Mississippi.</p>
<p>1952 - Baxter acquired Hyland Laboratories, the first US company to make human plasma commercially available.</p>
<p>1953 - William B. Graham becomes president and chief executive officer, and Baxter begins 25 consecutive years of more than 20-percent annual earnings growth.</p>
<p>1954 - The company expanded internationally with the opening of an office in Belgium.</p>
<p>By 1956, Baxter medical engineers had improved the original construction and had meticulously built 184 working artificial kidneys. Baxter introduced the first commercially built artificial kidney, making life-saving dialysis possible for people with end-stage renal disease. However, the artificial kidney did not immediately receive widespread acceptance in the medical community. The company persevered and today provides products for <a href="../../../h/e/m/Hemodialysis.html" title="Hemodialysis">hemodialysis</a>, <a href="../../../p/e/r/Peritoneal_dialysis.html" title="Peritoneal dialysis">peritoneal dialysis</a> (PD) and continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD), as well as transplantation.</p>
<p>1959 - Fenwal Laboratories was purchased in 1959. The unit's BLOOD-PACK plastic system for collection and processing of whole blood later led to Baxter's development of the VIAFLEX plastic IV bag, another major innovation in IV therapy. More recently, the technology was applied in the development of a flexible plastic delivery system for dialysis solutions for continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD), another Baxter first.</p>
<p>In the late ´50s, Baxter formally established an international division to sell Baxter products around the world. Today, more than half of Baxter sales come from non-U.S. markets. Today, the company has more than 250 facilities in 50 countries around the world and its products are used by patients and health-care professionals in more than 100 countries.</p>
<p><b>The 1960s</b></p>
<p>1960 - Edwards Laboratories, later to become a division of Baxter, introduces the first implantable heart valve in the United States. Over the next few years, Edwards also introduced the industry's first "balloon" catheters for therapeutic use: the SWAN-GANZ cardiac-monitoring catheter and the FOGARTY catheter for removing clots from peripheral blood vessels.</p>
<p>1961 - Baxter's performance had made it increasingly attractive to investors, and on May 15, 1961 Baxter stock began trading on the New York Stock Exchange. During the ´60s , Travenol (from inTRAVENous sOLutions) was added to the company name and the Travenol "flag" was introduced.</p>
<p>1962 - Baxter introduces the first disposable total-bypass blood-oxygenator.</p>
<p>1966 - The company's Hyland division introduces the first commercially produced Factor VIII concentrate to treat <a href="../../../h/e/m/Hemophilia.html" title="Hemophilia">hemophilia</a>.</p>
<p>1969 - Baxter opened its <a href="../../../r/o/u/Round_Lake%2C_Illinois_8fb1.html" title="Round Lake, Illinois">Round Lake, Illinois</a> research facility.</p>
<p><b>The 1970s</b></p>
<p>1970 - Throughout the ´60s, Baxter had worked to adapt plastic container technology for use in IV therapy. The result was the VIAFLEX plastic IV container, a major advance in IV therapy because it allowed the infusion of a solution without opening the system to contamination. US Food and Drug Administration approval for the Viaflex bag started Baxter on a high note for the next decade.</p>
<p>Baxter introduced the first disposable "bubble" oxygenator for heart-lung bypass with the help of renowned heart surgeons Michael DeBakey and Denton Cooley. In blood therapy, Hyland introduced HEMOFIL antohemophilic factor, a revolutionary product for the treatment of hemophilia.</p>
<p>1971 - Baxter joins Fortune magazine's listing of the 500 largest American corporations. Sales for the year reach $242 million.</p>
<p>1975 - The company moves into its current corporate headquarters in <a href="../../../d/e/e/Deerfield%2C_Illinois_07d2.html" title="Deerfield, Illinois">Deerfield, Illinois</a>.</p>
<p>1978 - Baxter introduces continuous ambulatory <a href="../../../p/e/r/Peritoneal_dialysis.html" title="Peritoneal dialysis">peritoneal dialysis</a> (CAPD) as a practical alternative to hemodialysis. The company's sales for the year exceed $1 billion.</p>
<p>1979 - The company introduces the first automated blood-cell separator, the CS-3000 system.</p>
<p><b>The 1980s</b></p>
<p>1980 - Vernon R. Loucks Jr. becomes president and chief executive officer, succeeding William B. Graham.</p>
<p>1984 - The Novacor left-ventricular assist system (LVAS), a technology later acquired by Baxter, becomes the first LVAS to keep alive a patient with a dying heart until a donor heart becomes available for transplant.</p>
<p>1985 - Baxter acquires American Hospital Supply Corporation, becoming a broad-based health-care products distributor in addition to a developer of medical technologies.</p>
<p><b>The 1990s</b></p>
<p>1991 - The company introduced the INTERLINK IV Access System, the first "needleless" system for IV therapy, protecting health-care workers from needle-stick accidents.</p>
<p>1992 - Hyland introduced RECOMBINATE Antihemophilic Factor (recombinant), the first genetically manufactured Factor VIII product.</p>
<p>1994 - Baxter introduced the HOMECHOICE <a href="../../../d/i/a/Dialysis.html" title="Dialysis">dialysis</a> machine, a compact, user-friendly device that cleanses the patient's blood overnight.</p>
<p>The Novacor LVAS is approved for sale in Europe as either a "bridge" to transplant or a long-term alternative to transplant.</p>
<p>1995 - Baxter gained approval in Japan for its new AMICUS blood-cell separator; approval in Europe for its ISOLEX cell-separator system; and U.S. approval for its new SPIRALGOLD oxygenator.</p>
<p>Nextran becomes a wholly owned affiliate of Baxter, focusing on research in <a href="../../../x/e/n/Xenotransplantation.html" title="Xenotransplantation">xenotransplantation</a>, or animal-to-human transplants.</p>
<p>1996 - Baxter spins off Allegiance Corporation, America's leading provider of health-care products and cost-management services.</p>
<p>Baxter's HemAssist (DCLHb) hemoglobin therapeutic, or "blood substitute," is the first to receive clearance by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to enter Phase III clinical testing for patients in elective surgery and those suffering from severe trauma.</p>
