<p>I just wanted to welcome you to wikipedia and let you know that there is a WikiProject you may be interested in. <i>If you don't know what a WikiProject is, it is a group of wikipedians who propose and implement suggested guidelines and formats for articles dealing with a specific subject.</i> The WikiProject in question is U.S. Regions, I have seen your proposed edits for the city list and I think your knowledge of Census Bureau Information would be useful to the project. If you are interested please notify me on my <a href="../../../j/c/a/User_talk%7EJCarriker_0c37.html" title="User talk:JCarriker">talk</a> page or add your name to the list of participants on the project's page.</p>

<p>The Wikiproject has several functions:</p>
<dl>
<dd>1. To prevent article wars in regional articles based on cultural affilation.</dd>
<dd>2. To included all areas that can be considered within the region are included in an article.</dd>
<dd>3. To ensure that articles do not place emphasis on one particluar area of the region over other areas, without deleting useful information.</dd>
<dd>4. To eliminate stereotypes from article text and mainatin article <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a>.</dd>
<dd>5. To make sure all references to a region article are accurate.</dd>
</dl>
<p>While many articles do exist not all regions have articles, many of these articles have been enhanced by the application of our suggested standards.</p>
<p>I hope this answers your questions, please explore the other project pages, especially, the prototype and "Official" Regiosn Template and Infobox.</p>

<p>Bamos: I'm wondering why you're putting cities in different lists than towns and villages in some lists of municipalities. I don't know about nationwide, but I know that where I am (North Carolina) that doesn't necessarily say anthing meaningful about the cities in terms of size, government, etc. Without clarification about what the differences are between "cities" and "towns," I don't know that it's useful to have them on separate lists. -- <a href="../../../s/e/t/User%7ESeth_Ilys_3523.html" title="User:Seth Ilys">Seth Ilys</a> 04:52, 19 Mar 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>I noticed that you were a member of the U.S. Cities Wikiproject, and I was wondering if you could give some advice on that topic. In Wisconsin (and perhaps other states, I'm not sure), every part of the state is a part of a town; however, parts of towns can incorporate, and occasionally they'll choose their city or village name as the same as the town. On Wikipedia, these have been disambiguated with "Name (city), Wisconsin" and "Name (town), Wisconsin." The problem is, most county and other pages do not link to these titles with (city) or (town) in them, even the ones made by Rambot, which I believe created the convention of (city) and (town) in the first place. My question is, should I create disambiguation pages for these shared names, like I have with <a href="../../../s/t/u/Sturgeon_Bay%2C_Wisconsin_c204.html" title="Sturgeon Bay, Wisconsin">Sturgeon Bay, Wisconsin</a> (I created that one with all the city info before finding <a href="../../../s/t/u/Sturgeon_Bay_%28city%29%2C_Wisconsin_8587.html" title="Sturgeon Bay (city), Wisconsin">Sturgeon Bay (city), Wisconsin</a>). This would at least cut back on the red on pages like <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_cities_in_Wisconsin_05e8.html" title="List of cities in Wisconsin">List of cities in Wisconsin</a> and each county page (ex. <a href="../../../k/e/w/Kewaunee_County%2C_Wisconsin_d08b.html" title="Kewaunee County, Wisconsin">Kewaunee County, Wisconsin</a>'s list of cities; a couple are red for this reason) and also cut back on the orphaned pages without redirect, which most of these pages are. Thanks for your time. <a href="../../../b/a/m/User%7EBamos_96e0.html" title="User:Bamos">Bamos</a> 00:51, 21 Mar 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Wisconsin has 1,266 towns. You have your work cut out for you. Dooes the list of cities only include incorporated cities? or does it include towns, too? <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavodd_2d13.html" title="User:Davodd">Davodd</a> 01:11, Mar 21, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm only talking about places where there the towns and cities have the same name...looking at the list of WI cities, it's probably around 100 cases, not more than 200. Is it worth the page creations? <a href="../../../b/a/m/User%7EBamos_96e0.html" title="User:Bamos">Bamos</a> 04:16, 21 Mar 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi, I'm also from WI and I did a little research on what a town is. It's not the same as a township, which is just a surveying unit. Towns are the unit of government that cover land that isn't occupied by a city or village.<a href="http://www.wisctowns.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.wisctowns.com" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> So, where I'm familiar with the territory, I've been moving the cities and villages which share a name with a town to the name (for example, I moved <a href="../../../a/r/p/Arpin_%28village%29%2C_Wisconsin_6db4.html" title="Arpin (village), Wisconsin">Arpin (village), Wisconsin</a> to <a href="../../../a/r/p/Arpin%2C_Wisconsin_dd61.html" title="Arpin, Wisconsin">Arpin, Wisconsin</a>). I figured the cities and villages are more important than the towns (perhaps this is a little presumptuous). I've been leaving the town where it is, adding a link to the county page (see for example <a href="../../../w/o/o/Wood_County%2C_Wisconsin_8221.html" title="Wood County, Wisconsin">Wood County, Wisconsin</a>) under "Town of Arpin," because that's what the locals called it where I grew up. IMHO a dismbiguation page would be kind of awkward for a big important city like <a href="../../../w/a/u/Wausau%2C_Wisconsin_2376.html" title="Wausau, Wisconsin">Wausau, Wisconsin</a> (and maybe Sturgeon Bay). What do you think? Whatever we agree to, I'm willing to help with the moving/disambiguation page creating. Perhaps we could coordinate our efforts. Cheers, <a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETantalate_27d7.html" title="User:Tantalate">Tantalate</a> 02:38, 23 Mar 2004 (UTC)~</dd>

<dd>You're probably right about the relative importance. Rather than copying the entire page, though, perhaps we could just redirect from, say <a href="../../../w/a/u/Wausau%2C_Wisconsin_2376.html" title="Wausau, Wisconsin">Wausau, Wisconsin</a> to <a href="../../../w/a/u/Wausau_%28city%29%2C_Wisconsin_e8fd.html" title="Wausau (city), Wisconsin">Wausau (city), Wisconsin</a> to save space?

<dd>Oh, I just checked your Arpin village page, and you did the reverse of what I had suggested&#160;:). That works too. Maybe at the top we could also have a disambiguation message, like at the top of <a href="../../../b/a/l/Baltimore%2C_Maryland_9c87.html" title="Baltimore, Maryland">Baltimore, Maryland</a> (except instead of linking to a disambig page, we have a direct link to the town). <a href="../../../b/a/m/User%7EBamos_96e0.html" title="User:Bamos">Bamos</a> 02:52, 23 Mar 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yeah, a link to the town at the top of the page sounds good to me. I'll go back and do that to the cities and villages I've done (mostly in central WI) which share a name with towns. Regarding the moving, when you move a page it creates a redirect at the old name, so I'm not sure it takes up that much more space. Does anyone from WikiProject Cities have an opinion on this? <a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETantalate_27d7.html" title="User:Tantalate">Tantalate</a> 03:08, 23 Mar 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I thought you were literally copy-pasting the article from one to the other, in essence making two copies. That's my fault for misreading what you wrote&#160;:). I'm not sure how to go about fixing the pages I've made disambiguation pages for (<a href="../../../a/r/c/Arcadia%2C_Wisconsin_1496.html" title="Arcadia, Wisconsin">Arcadia, Wisconsin</a>, <a href="../../../b/a/y/Bayfield%2C_Wisconsin_376a.html" title="Bayfield, Wisconsin">Bayfield, Wisconsin</a>, <a href="../../../b/e/r/Berlin%2C_Wisconsin_f168.html" title="Berlin, Wisconsin">Berlin, Wisconsin</a>, <a href="../../../b/l/o/Bloomer%2C_Wisconsin_b9b0.html" title="Bloomer, Wisconsin">Bloomer, Wisconsin</a>, and <a href="../../../s/t/u/Sturgeon_Bay%2C_Wisconsin_c204.html" title="Sturgeon Bay, Wisconsin">Sturgeon Bay, Wisconsin</a>). In any case, I can start moving the ones I haven't yet made a mess of&#160;:). <a href="../../../b/a/m/User%7EBamos_96e0.html" title="User:Bamos">Bamos</a> 03:13, 23 Mar 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Brian, I came at this question of (Towns) from New York and Ohio. But, I created a list of towns in Wisconsin, and I put a comment about article names of its talk page, <a href="../../../l/i/s/Talk%7EList_of_Wisconsin_towns_89f5.html" title="Talk:List of Wisconsin towns">Talk:List of Wisconsin towns</a>. Net is that I'd drop the (Town) name and simply go with [[Xyz Town, Wisconsin]] for a name, unless there was also an incoporated Village of City. Duplicates would list as [[Xyz Town, Abc County, Wisconsin]].. I'd appreciate comments on the talk page. Thanks, <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELouI_01b3.html" title="User:LouI">Lou I</a> 15:36, 25 Mar 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I've created a sample, described on the talk page for the town list. You might also check out or comment on a somewhat different layout for disambiguation that I've tried at <a href="../../../a/s/h/Ashland.html" title="Ashland">Ashland</a>, but comment on that at <a href="../../../d/i/s/Wikipedia_talk%7EDisambiguation_d461.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Disambiguation">Wikipedia talk:Disambiguation</a>.
