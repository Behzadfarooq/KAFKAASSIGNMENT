<dl>
<dd>First of all, I'm sorry you're upset. It is certainly not my intention to ruin your work, or the article. Quite the contrary: I'm trying to preserve as much of it as I can and still conform to Wikipedia guidelines. The fact is that many articles have had trivia sections added and then deleted several times, per <a href="../../../a/v/t/WP%7EAVTRIV_0d64.html" title="WP:AVTRIV">WP:AVTRIV</a>. Many Wikipdians, generally those with a "deletionist" orientation, don't want any trivia in articles at all. When they see a trivia section, they will often just delete the whole thing, or just save one or two items and merge them in elsewhere. See, for example, <a href="../../../a/_/c/Talk%7EA_Christmas_Story_0cff.html#Trivia_to_popular_culture.3F" title="Talk:A Christmas Story">Talk:A_Christmas_Story#Trivia_to_popular_culture.3F</a>, in which I responded the last time someone deleted the trivia section. See also <a href="../../../b/a/c/Talk%7EBack_to_the_Future_8cae.html" title="Talk:Back to the Future">Talk:Back to the Future</a> for more discussion of the same problem. Trust me, there are lots of editors out there who are much tougher on trivia sections than I am. I was trying to forestall their deletion of your material by putting it in appropriate sections, per Wikipedia guidelines.</dd>
<dd>Second, I put an edit summary on everything I did, explaining each move. I specifically said, "Trivia stuff needs to be merged into appropriate sections - e.g. settings.)" This is not something I'm doing to be mean to you; it's the generally accepted guideline, although I did not cite that at the time. Still, the problem had just been mentioned on the talk page, so I didn't exactly operate in an informational vacuum.</dd>
<dd>Third, some of your trivia repeated information already stated elsewhere. Please read through an article before adding the same info again. This was also mentioned in my edit summaries.</dd>
<dd>Fourth, many Wikipedians make a big deal of <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">citing reliable sources</a> for pretty much every fact in an article, particularly everything that can't be derived just from looking at a television screen. This, too, is a well-established and generally accepted Wikipedia guideline. Although there are lots of articles that do not do a good job of this, there are also lots and lots of Wikipedians who want anything and everything to have citations. None of your material has citations, and it's not straight from watching the movie, either. The bar is also set fairly high for what a reliable source is: no blogs, no fan forums. I don't always agree with that standard, but that's what it is.</dd>
<dd>Fifth: my moves of images were to have them illustrate appropriate blocks of text. Perhaps the exact placement can be improved, but there's a reason for this beyond just keeping things organized. A screen shot is a "fair use" image, and requires something called a "fair use rationale" for using it. Basically, as I understand it, you can't have lots of these in any one article, and each one needs to have a good reason for being there, and illustrate something specific.</dd>
<dd>I hope you will find this helpful, and not shoot the messenger. Like you, I'm just trying to make the article as good as it can be - but I'm trying to follow Wikipedia guidelines in doing so. Have a great day, and happy editing! Oh, and please sign your comments on talk pages with four tildes.

<p>Thanks for uploading <b>Image:Jalin-Wood.gif</b>. I notice the file's description page currently doesn't specify who created the content, so the <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copyright.html" title="Copyright">copyright</a> status is unclear. If you have not created this file yourself, then there needs to be a justification explaining why we have the right to use it on Wikipedia (see copyright tagging below). If you did not create the file yourself, then you need to specify where it was found, i.e., in most cases link to the website where it was taken from, and the terms of use for content from that page.</p>
<p>If the file also doesn't have a copyright tag, then one should be added. If you created/took the picture, audio, or video then the {{<a href="../../../g/f/d/Template%7EGFDL-self_97c5.html" title="Template:GFDL-self">GFDL-self</a>}} tag can be used to release it under the <a href="../../../g/f/d/GFDL_75b9.html" title="GFDL">GFDL</a>. If you believe the media meets the criteria at <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_a984.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">Wikipedia:Fair use</a>, use a tag such as {{<a href="../../../f/a/i/Template%7EFairusein_19b9.html" title="Template:Fairusein">fairusein</a>|article name}} or one of the other tags listed at <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_copyright_tags_f6dd.html#Fair_use" title="Wikipedia:Image copyright tags">Wikipedia:Image copyright tags#Fair_use</a>.
