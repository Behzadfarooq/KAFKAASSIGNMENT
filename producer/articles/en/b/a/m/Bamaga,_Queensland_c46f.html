<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/m/Bamaga%2C_Queensland_c46f.html" title="Edit section: History">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
<p>The original site for the township of Bamaga was at a site known as "<a href="../../../m/u/t/Muttee_Heads_4ef9.html" title="Muttee Heads">Muttee Heads</a>" some 20 kilometres south of the present Bamaga township. This site was established in the early 1900s by people from <a href="../../../s/a/i/Saibai_Island_122b.html" title="Saibai Island">Saibai Island</a> in <a href="../../../t/o/r/Torres_Strait_7c26.html" title="Torres Strait">Torres Strait</a> where local islanders formed a community.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/4/1947.html" title="1947">1947</a>, the Bamaga township was moved to its present site as a result of a need by the founding people for a larger supply of fresh water. The people of Bamaga were assisted to settle at Ichirru after initially moving from Saibai Island. After Saibai Island was devastated by a tidal wave, Saibai Islanders, led by a man named Bamaga, moved to <a href="../../../m/u/t/Muttee_Heads_4ef9.html" title="Muttee Heads">Muttee Heads</a> on Cape York.</p>
<p>They lived at Muttee Head until the present location at Bamaga by the Department of Native Affairs was properly established. With local industries and an airport (on <a href="../../../i/n/j/Injinoo.html" title="Injinoo">Injinoo</a> traditional land) Bamaga became the administrative centre for the Northern Peninsula Area which was made up of the three Aboriginal communities of Injinoo, Umagico and <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Mapoon_6605.html" title="New Mapoon">New Mapoon</a>, and the Islander communities of Seisia and Bamaga. All five are DOGIT - communities with their own community councils</p>
<p>As a result of this relocation, some 20 years later, another community "<a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Mapoon_6605.html" title="New Mapoon">New Mapoon</a>" was also established. This community being one of the existing five communities. This community was populated by persons from "Old Mapoon" Community located some two hours north by road from the township of <a href="../../../w/e/i/Weipa%2C_Queensland_a501.html" title="Weipa, Queensland">Weipa</a>. There has been regular movement between these "Mapoon" communities due to ancestral ties.</p>
<p>The entire area surrounding the Bamaga township however has vast history from frontier exploration by <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kennedy.html" title="Kennedy">Kennedy</a> and his tracker <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jackey_Jackey_3ae3.html" title="Jackey Jackey">Jackey Jackey</a> to more recent times of <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a>. The countryside has numerous aircraft wrecks and other wartime memorabilia in-situ.</p>
<p>All communities except Bamaga and New Mapoon are located on the coastline and the current residents still hold a close affiliation with the sea. There has been an incessant influence of islanders into each community with current proportions being approximately 75% Islander and 20% Aboriginal.</p>
<p>The Bamaga township and surrounding communities are located north of the Jardine River which supplies the town water. The Jardine River, during the wet season, creates the effect of forming an island of all land north of the river.</p>
<p><br />
Bamaga has an Islander population of approximately 700 people with a further 300 temporary non-islander residents. The Community boasts reticulated town water, which is pumped from the Jardine River. A new water treatment plant has been constructed recently and Bamaga is fully sewered.</p>
<p>All of Bamaga's internal and main roads are sealed. The major industry is tourism mainly during the drier months of the year. This runs from May - October (The Developmental Road is impassable during the wet season and the ferry across the Jardine River does not operate).</p>
<p>The Community owns Resort Bamaga, an accommodation house for the corporate visitor. There is some cattle production, small business retailing and a concrete batching plant. Bamaga Island Council is the biggest employer with 200 staff. Modern supermarkets can be found at Seisia and Umagico. There is a general merchandise/clothing store, a video store, Post Office, Service Station/workshop, snack bar, pub and bakery in Bamaga as well as an Anglican Church store and thrift shop.</p>

<p>Bamaga is the location of the Northern Peninusula Area State College. It is made up out of the Bamaga P-6 Campus and Bamaga 7-12 Campus within the Bamaga township and the P-5 Campus which is located in the Injinoo Community.</p>
<p>The standard of schooling is reflective to any found amongst most Aboriginal/Islander communities however in recent years standards have improved. There are now 50+ teachers and teacher aides through all schools.</p>
<p>The Bamaga and New Mapoon Communities have established Child Care Centres for early childhood schooling.</p>
<p>In recent times, the Cape York Campus of T.A.F.E was established at Bamaga. The campus provides a wide range of tutorial courses from seamanship to practically any other course. The campus is a branch of the Far North College of T.A.F.E. situated at Cairns.</p>

<p>There is a local Ergon Energy generator powerhouse at Bamaga which continually supplies 240 volt power to all communities. There are two local Ergon linesman stationed at Bamaga. Most lines are antiquated and subject to breakdowns causing blackouts on occasions.</p>
<p>Powercards are an innovative idea for electricity supply to all residences in the Bamaga area. These are similar to phonecards and are inserted into the powerboards at each residence. The cards are available only in <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_dollar.html" title="Australian dollar">AU$</a>20.00 amounts. There are therefore no issue of power bills as responsibility remains with each household to maintain power by the use of the cards.</p>

<p>The quality of the town drinking water has improved of late with the introduction of new community reservoirs and the newly completed water treatment plant by Sunwater. The town water is sourced from the Jardine River supply.</p>

<p>Sewerage for all communities except Seisia is by underground sewer. Seisia is proposing to remove all septics in favour of sewer in the coming budgets. Garbage collection is twice weekly (Mon-Thur) and should this not suffice, the local waste depot is only 2 kilometres away from the police establishment.</p>
