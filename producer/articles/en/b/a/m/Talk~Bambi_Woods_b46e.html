<p>5 ft 11 in is NOT 1.56 m, so which is right? -5 ft 11 in is correct, I don't know how many meters that would be. ------&gt;(5'11"=71"=1.8034 meters)</p>

<p>I think there are some potential clues to reveal Bambi's identity. First I think she might not have been a blonde. She has dark thick eybrows and dark and thick pubic hair.</p>
<p>I also think she might have been made to perform by someone else for some reason because I think she tries to mask some pain and emotional discomfort, although this could be because she was filmed with men who had very large penises. But I also notice some discomfort in the lesbian scene too. Bambi does appear to be excellently skilled and experianced at fellatio. Perhaps Bambi had engaged in real life prostitution? Perhaps she was connected by a pimp? And perhaps that is an 'easter egg' for the film, in that the film showed a potrayal of something similar to real life event?</p>
<p>Bambi has something of an accent, I think more along the lines of a Utah sort of accent. She's definately not East Coast, South, Upper Midwest, Canada, or California.</p>
<p>Bambi Woods is tall, has natural breasts which could be called large, and an athletic build. While attractive, she's not a model. She might have worn glasses or needed to. Bambi does not appear to be someone who exercises often, so she would probable not lose weight she gained if she had gotten pregnant, or otherwise gained weight.</p>
<p>Final idea. Bambi seems to have gotten taller, and it seems that she has grown more pubic hair between Debbie Does Dallas and Debbie Does Dallas II. Since most growth spurts occur in women betweem the ages of 10 and 17, I think it might be safe to consider that Bambi was underage in te movie Debbie Does Dallas and that she may have been as young as 15. if this is true then it might be a factor in her disappearing from the scene. When Traci Lords was identified as being underage, this caused much finanical loss and legal problems in the adult film buisness, Bambi Woods doing the same thing would have caused hundreds of times more problems because nothing Traci did could ever come close to the wide spread fame and distribution of Debbie Does Dallas.</p>
<p>One group of people that would know Bambi's true identity, would be the publisher of the movies she was in. Certainly they would not have been able to write a check payable to Bambi Woods. <a href="../../../r/b/l/User%7ERBLakes_7ba5.html" title="User:RBLakes">RBLakes</a> 00:07, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The original studio and most records from the original filming in 1978 no longer exist. The rights, film and everything of any value has been passed down the line to us here at VCX. Aside from the film itself, some posters and other miscellaneous material, there is very little info that would shed any more light on Debbie's true identity. Also you have to keep in mind that Debbie was filmed way before America was hysterical about USC 2257 record keeping laws, so we don't know the "true" identities of many stars from pre-1995 content. Despite lack of 2257 issues, America was hysterical about adult content (obscenity) in general though, and a lot of people got busted and went to jail for filming, producing or distributing it. With that in mind, it's highly unlikely any "checks" were written to anyone, named "Bambi Woods" or not. I speculate that the majority actors and actresses (producers, distributors, etc) were paid under the table in cash. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by VCXHomeOfTheClassics (<a href="../../../v/c/x/User_talk%7EVCXHomeOfTheClassics_a4fe.html" title="User talk:VCXHomeOfTheClassics">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_VCXHomeOfTheClassics_88ef.html" title="Special:Contributions/VCXHomeOfTheClassics">contribs</a>) 13:28, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</small></p>

<li>"Bambi's" birthname has been established as "Esther Morrison," as seen on the article page. I think you are confusing this "starlet" with Colleen Applegate, a.k.a. "Shauna Grant," who committed suicide in Palm Springs, CA. T. E. Goodwin 02:55, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Replaced the Debbie Does Dallas box cover with an image we (VCX Ltd., Inc) scanned of Bambi Woods. This image is copyrighted by VCX, however, it is specifically authorized for use on Wikipedia as printed on the image. Any comments or questions please see my talk page. I would like the original box cover to be shown also, but I'm not sure how to get two images to show in the bio box? I left the code in tact, although it's listed under "Photo2=" instead of "Photo=".
