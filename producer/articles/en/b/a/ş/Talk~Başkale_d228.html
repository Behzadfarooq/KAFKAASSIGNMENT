Perhaps these are 100% accurate -- I don't know for sure and I don't understand the finer points of differences between ethnic identities in Turkey either. However, it appears most of the original information in this article was sourced from the <a href="../../../1/9/1/1911_Encyclopaedia_7f27.html" title="1911 Encyclopaedia">1911 Encyclopaedia</a> (consistently considered a reputable resource, although it exhibits quite a different worldview than that of today since it's almost 100 years old). So, why were references to Armenians and Nestorian Christians changed to Assyrians? I just need to know this is not some Assyrian-Armenian edit war.

<dd>I won't contest <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChaldean_d16d.html" title="User:Chaldean">Chaldean</a>'s changing <i>Nestorian</i> to <i>Assyrian</i>, but I assume he was mistaken when he changed <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armenian_genocide.html" title="Armenian genocide">Armenian genocide</a> to <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assyrian_genocide.html" title="Assyrian genocide">Assyrian genocide</a>, so I reverted that last change. --<a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenne_3d1e.html" title="User:Benne">Benne</a> ['bɛnə] <sub>(<a href="../../../b/e/n/User_talk%7EBenne_fa1a.html" title="User talk:Benne">talk</a>)</sub> 01:00, 27 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, first off, both genocides occurred <b>after</b> 1911, so the information must have been added by a user. It's pretty simple - <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armenians.html" title="Armenians">Armenians</a> were killed in the <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armenian_Genocide_187a.html" title="Armenian Genocide">Armenian Genocide</a>, <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assyrians.html" title="Assyrians">Assyrians</a> were killed in the <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assyrian_genocide.html" title="Assyrian genocide">Assyrian genocide</a>.

<dd>No I did not mistaken. The "history" paragraph was not taken from Brittanica..it was sourced (did anybody see the source? Did anybody even read the sentence before it? <i>approximately 50 Gawarnai Assyrians by Muslims on 30 October 1914 at Başkale</i> - Assyrians, not Armenians...so Assyrians died, so were going to call it Armenian genocide? No, Assyrian deaths belong under the subject of <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assyrian_genocide.html" title="Assyrian genocide">Assyrian genocide</a> and Armenian dead belongs to <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armenian_genocide.html" title="Armenian genocide">Armenian genocide</a>.

<dd>Benne, your the one that needs to read. The sentence was COPIED and PASTED from the source I provided. Nowhere in the Armenian cited site is Baskale mentioned (at least I didn't see.) So; where going to get information from an Assyrian website about Gewargi Assyrians getting massacred and file it under the <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armenian_genocide.html" title="Armenian genocide">Armenian genocide</a>. So, what is the <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assyrian_genocide.html" title="Assyrian genocide">Assyrian genocide</a> page use for? When is it appropriate to mention <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assyrian_genocide.html" title="Assyrian genocide">Assyrian genocide</a>?

<dd>Well, I'm sorry, but I really think you should get yourself a pair of glasses. The first source provided talks about Armenians, and also about Syrians (a.k.a. <i>Suryāye</i>). Look for <i>Bashkala</i>, not <i>Başkala</i>.</dd>
<dd>And the following sentence you wrote just does not make sense:
<dl>
<dd>Brittanica 1911 was the one that wrote <i>One of many events in the string of tensions which led to World War I was a massacre of approximately 50 Gawarnai Assyrians by Muslims on 30 October 1914 at Başkale</i> as it looks like, according to its first version of this page.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>How can a 1911 encyclopaedia write about an event that happened in 1914? --<a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenne_3d1e.html" title="User:Benne">Benne</a> ['bɛnə] <sub>(<a href="../../../b/e/n/User_talk%7EBenne_fa1a.html" title="User talk:Benne">talk</a>)</sub> 07:43, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>I thought it could have been maybe a late addition since it was a current event. I did not write that sentence about the Assyrians getting killed. I went back to the other link and by the way, when they say Syrians they mean Sureth speaking people, but dont think for a second they are Syriac Orthodox members...because there is no such thing in Hakkari and plus it explains in the beginning what they meant by Syrian <i>Semitic Christian population, variously known as "Nestorians" (from their religion), "Syrians" (from their language) or "Chaldoeans" (from their race).</i></p>
<p>And so this is what is says about Baskale: <i>The many hundreds (and perhaps some thousands) of Armenians and Syrians in the region of Bashkala have been massacred.</i> So, in essince, both Armenians and Assyrians died in Baskale. So the sentence of <i>One of many events in the string of tensions which led to World War I was a massacre of approximately 50 Gawarnai Assyrians by Muslims on 30 October 1914 at Başkale</i> should not be dismissed. So then, what are we going to do now. I think we should have something like;</p>
<p>One of many events in the string of tensions which led to <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_I_9429.html" title="World War I">World War I</a> was a massacre of approximately 50 Gawarnai <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assyrians.html" title="Assyrians">Assyrians</a> by Muslims on 30 October 1914 at Başkale, as part of the <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assyrian_genocide.html" title="Assyrian genocide">Assyrian genocide</a>. Hundreds more of Armenians of Başkale were later deported and massacred by <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turks.html" title="Turks">Turks</a> and <a href="../../../k/u/r/Kurds.html" title="Kurds">Kurds</a> during the <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armenian_genocide.html" title="Armenian genocide">Armenian genocide</a>. <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChaldean_d16d.html" title="User:Chaldean">Chaldean</a> 14:04, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for the email, User:Khoikhoi. Unfortunately I was a bit of a novice wikipedia editor when I started writing this article. I started it purely in response to a list of 1911 encyclopaedia articles that were not yet started in Wikipedia at the time. So I did get most of the information from the 1911 article, because this is a topic I knew nothing about -- and still know VERY little. I wasn't properly aware of the Wikipedia rules about verifiability and citing sources when I did this too and so I can only imagine I tried to add more up to date information to the article by googling on <i>baskale</i> and <i>bashkala</i>. Considering there's no verifiable source for what I wrote - or if there was I don't remember it - I suggest what I originally wrote be discounted and deleted. And hopefully User:Chaldean and User:Benne can collaborate to rewrite a history section from scratch since they know about this topic. Lisa 01:50, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
