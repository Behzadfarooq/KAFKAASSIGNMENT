<dd>A scientist who doesn't know math is not a scientist. And it is science since it's not just a bunch of numbers. Only someone who understands an ecosystem can understand the effect something will have on an ecosystem. I don't think any scientist claims to understand any ecosystem completely but I would venture a guess that most environmental scientists understand better then a mathematician and no offense intended but understand better then a layperson like you or me. Actually I'm partially a biologist but I've never studied and so don't understand the issues, but I trust other scientists better then I trust mathematicians on this. Not that there are many mathematicians who dispute the scientists analyse anyway. Most mathmeticians are smart enough that they role is only subdiary in this. I still don't get what the heck this has to do with the Chinese River Dolphin but if someone is going to claims something is all maths when it's not, that has to be disputed. However I've decided to best to end it here.

<dd>Species go extinct every once a while. Its part of nature. There's a number of volcanoes and other natural disasters killing over 97% of Earth's species at a specific time, and who is to blame for that? Everything has a time and a season. When the dinosaurs became extinct, the mammals started to grew, which eventually became us - so is the extinction of the dinosaurs a good thing or a bad thing?</dd>

<dd>Evolution (the ability to adapt) takes time to occur. Such a sudden change in the environment wouldn't have given the dolphins enough time to reproduce offsprings that are better adapted for the new environment, yet that does not mean that dolphins aren't intelligent. We humans also connot adapt to sudden climate changes, or radiation in the air, yet that does not mean that we're not intelligent.

who ever said it isnt my personel blog the whole world is one big blog that is both public and private and the cold hearted intectulat stuff about all things go extinct well many cry about becomming extinct on their death beds so we shoudl accept this kind of waste?/ , and 99 percent of all spieces have gone extinct?/ gee I guess that makes it all ok and who ever said i didnt do any thing am I gona die to no silly it was once said by a scientits that " viruses seem to bea way the earth defends its self from us , natural selection and made made distruction two different things , And the chinese person who said about cheap stuff yes seems the american corporation doesnt care about anything but the bottom line I still feel this is a very sad and very bad thing to happen to any decent life form on this planet. Actually this whole senerio shows just how primevile we still are . As I said earlyer I GUES THIS IS ONE OF THOSE SO CALLED GREAT LEAP FORWARDS THAT WAS JUST ANOTHER FALL BACK. sad and sad , death may bea normal part of life , but it doesnt make it ok.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">This is a Travesty</span></h2>
<p>I remember as a young'en, there was a book called "Draw 50 Endangered Creatures" There were Gorillas, Orangutans, Cheethas and the Yangtze River Dolphin. This was 25 years ago! In 1981! We have sat back all this time and let this poor mammal become extinct??? I'm gobsmacked and saddened! This is depressing! I'm Sickened that this has happened! --w2ch00</p>
