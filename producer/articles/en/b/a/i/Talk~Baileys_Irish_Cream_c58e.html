	    <p>How quickly does Baileys go off?

<dd>I usually have a bottle of Baileys in the freezer. It will make the drink a lot thicker (but if your freezer temp. is set too low, it will freeze it).

<p>Dutch Article on the 'urban legend'. I have moved the line mentioning this article up to the 'urban legend' section, but perhaps it should be in the 'References' section instead, and a reference link be given in the 'urban legend' section instead?

<p>The Jagoes link seems to be a cynical attempt to link a recent imitation of Baileys to the original brand through a dubvious claim that the creater of the new drink was linked to the original creation of Baileys. The rest of my recent edit is based on the information freely available on the www.baileys.com website - if this information is factually incorrect then surely someone would sue Baileys - they're hardly going to get away with putting lies in writing on their official website. Instead of discarding my changes wholesale and reverting to the Jagoes promotion copy, why not cross check my information with the offical facts on Baileys.com story section and remove any language that you feel is too subjective. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_66.9.147.146_92b0.html" title="Special:Contributions/66.9.147.146">66.9.147.146</a> (<a href="../../../6/6/2E/User_talk%7E66.9.147.146.html" title="User talk:66.9.147.146">talk</a>) 19:34, December 2, 2006</small></p>

<dd>I found it really necessary to revert wholesale because the overall tone of the new additions did not match Wikipedia's <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral point of view</a> policy; the writing style was good, but resembled a Baileys publicity piece. But don't take my word for it, here is the link <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Baileys_Irish_Cream&amp;diff=91693780&amp;oldid=91256900" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Baileys_Irish_Cream&amp;diff=91693780&amp;oldid=91256900" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. It is peppered with words like "revolutionary", "growing at an incredible rate and was rapidly followed by several imitations" ("similar competitors" is more neutral).</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The addition I most noticed was this new section "The Baileys Farms": <i>Baileys sources it's cream from 1,500 specially chosen, family owned, Irish farms where a total of around 40,000 cows produce milk exclusively for Baileys. Irish cows, unlike most cows, are kept outdoors in the fresh air for nine months of the year to feed on fresh, green Irish grass.'</i> This is a wonderful piece of advertising copy, but if we trim out the ad-speak (would we really expect grass to be other than green, or Irish farms to have other than Irish grass, or any other kind of cow in the world to eat Irish grass?), we end up with <i>Baileys state that they source their cream from 40,000 cows on family owned Irish farms</i>, which doesn't seem to me to be a fact worth noting, still less worthy of a whole section.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The reference to a shared creator is interesting. I realise that it is not contradictory. I took "R&amp;A Bailey discovered a revolutionary way to naturally mix cream with whiskey" to be a reference to people (R&amp;A Bailey). In fact, they are the company, so they would have had employees involved, they are fully owned by their parent company and may have employed development companies. This should be sourced of course, but if this claim is "dubious" it seems to be that the owners of Baileys would have take immediate legal action against any new product making a claim of co-creator that can't be backed up.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>We also see oddities like moving a section <i>after</i> references, and adding a raft of new "nice sounding" cocktails like "Baileys Martini (Shaken with Ice)", while removing the "nasty" ones like Irish Lobotomy or Orgasm. No idea if these are real, but neither the old or new list had sources. (There is a reference to a publication, but this unfortunately is not backed up with inline citations which I believe are necessary so we know which parts of the article are sourced.), and finally a link to "recent advertising" which some would say was a little overcommercial (let the official site offer that).</dd>

<dd>I hope these comments are helpful in understanding why I went for a complete revert, rather than trying to massage the new addition to fit Wikipedia's polcies and guidelines. <a href="../../../n/o/t/User%7ENotinasnaid_e8da.html" title="User:Notinasnaid">Notinasnaid</a> 11:30, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This is probably one of the most poorly organized articles I have come across in quite awhile. There is no rhyme or reason to the formatting; the article reads like a bunch of random facts thrown together. If anyone has any suggestions on how this article should be better organized, I'd be happy to work on it. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_129.2.233.44_8f76.html" title="Special:Contributions/129.2.233.44">129.2.233.44</a> (talk) 23:22, 7 December 2006 (UTC).</small></p>

<p>Basically made it less of an advertisment, removing the more flowery language. I also added sections on manufacture and storage. The information on manufacture is all on the Baileys website, though it isn't all in one place - you have to dig a bit, there is quite a lot in the FAQ. While I can see why the reversion was done, it didn't really make it a good article. Hopefully this is a step in the right direction.</p>
<p>I am not completely convinced however that this article even needs to exist, and that the various brands of Irish Cream do not belong as a sub-heading in the article about Irish Cream generally. <a href="../../../a/b/b/User%7EAbbeyvet_45fa.html" title="User:Abbeyvet">Abbeyvet</a> 11:30, 20th January 2007 (UTC)</p>
