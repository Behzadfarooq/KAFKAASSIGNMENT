<dd>I have read the commentary below. IMHO, it's flaky to say in the article, "functionally extinct" and then place in the infobox "critically endangered." It's not "inventing a new category" to display "extinct" in the graphic, and "functionally extinct" in the explanatory text. It tells the whole story in a nutshell, which is why it was offered as a compromise. --<a href="../../../k/g/h/User%7EKghusker_6a0d.html" title="User:Kghusker">Kghusker</a> 14:58, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Chen and Hua (1987) predicted that the controversial Three Gorges Dam, completed in the early 2000s, would eliminate counter-current habitat for approximately 200 km downstream and degrade the existing counter-current systems for another 160 km downstream. Further, stratification in the reservoir will cause the water released below the dam to be cooler than previously, potentially affecting Baiji and their prey. The downstream effects of Gezhouba Dam were not as extreme as those predicted for Three Gorges Dam because the former is a low-head, run-of-the-river structure (Zhong and Power 1996), meaning that sediment is allowed to pass through (which allows the formation of the counter-currents where baiji are generally found – see above) and no reservoir forms. Another effect of Three Gorges Dam will be to facilitate large ship traffic in the upper reaches of the Yangtze and thereby increase the amount of underwater noise and the incidence of vessel collisions with Baiji (Chen and Hua 1989).</p>

<p>I think it should be called <b>extinct</b> not <b>critical</b>, because that was the scientific estimate.

<p>Pengo is exactly correct.</p>
<p>I think <b>PE</b> is exactly the appropriate category here. This is the first mammal species for which this (hitherto birds-only) category would apply. It cannot be said to be functionally extinct (which is not a conservation status category in any case), <i>strictly speaking</i>, because this requires knowledge we simply haven't got, though I completely agree with the assessment that it is beyond hope for recovery (due to inbreeding depression, which might have pushed it over the brink as early as the 1980s: species with such life-history and demecological characteristics usually start to suffer severly from inbreeding depression at effective population sizes of a few 100 mature individuals, because their gene pool gets "mixed" very slowly in historical times, but very rapidly more recently. Same problem as with tigers really.)<br />
<b>DD</b> according to the precautionary principle should not be applied to species which would certainly fall into higher threat categories than (methinks) VU. It denotes uncertainty about whether a <i>long- or medium-term</i> threat of extinction exists or not, but obviously more threatened taxa get classified in the highest reasonably appropriate category (save EX which would bring conservation action to a halt. It is really an issue of both science and politics, as shown by the question of declaring the <a href="../../../t/h/y/Thylacine.html" title="Thylacine">thylacine</a> extinct... the last major area of essentially natural woodland/grassland habitat on Tasmania had been set aside as a thylacine reserve early in the 20th century, and ppl were queuing up already to apply for construction, mining, logging etc permits as soon as the political debate of the status change became known - because no matter that loads of rare endemics were to be found only there in numbers, the reserve's existence was tied to the thylacine not being classified as extinct.)<br />
See <a href="http://www.birdlife.org/news/news/2006/06/possibly_extinct_paper.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.birdlife.org/news/news/2006/06/possibly_extinct_paper.pdf" rel="nofollow">this</a> paper which introduces and discusses the PE category. The salient point is basically,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A precautionary approach by IUCN to classifying extinctions is appropriate in order to encourage continuing conservation efforts until there is no reasonable doubt that the last individual of a species has died. It also minimises the danger of ‘crying wolf’ and reducing confidence in the accuracy of the label Extinct. However, this approach biases analyses of recent extinctions based only on those species officially classified Extinct or Extinct in the Wild. For example, the number of recent extinctions documented on the IUCN Red List is likely to be a significant underestimate, even for well-known taxa such as birds. In recognition of this, we develop a framework to examine relevant evidence and judge as objectively as possible which Critically Endangered species are likely to be already extinct.</p>

<p>Not relevant. While there may (or may not) be a small number of the dolphins still alive, the species is *functionally* extinct. There are not sufficient numbers--in the wild or in captivity--to maintain the gene diversity to ensure the survivability of the species. That's right, you can't make an entire *diverse* population from one Adam and one Eve. BTW: SHAME on China. 193.255.108.20 12:54, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's theoretically possible to revive a species even if it's down to a mating pair. The problem here is that not only will the dolphins' habitats not improve, they'll crash to further depths unknown when the Three Gorges comes online. As for the shame on China, part of the blame has to rest with the consumers of their products and the corporations that oversee their production. Also, imagine that this were the 1880's and you've got a dolphin on the Mississippi. I think China should be ashamed, just that there are a few more pieces of blame to hand around. <a href="../../../x/i/n/User%7EXiner_4ce3.html" title="User:Xiner">Xiner</a> 14:07, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As is the case with some species that have been declared extinct with in the last hundred years, there is much contention. If you check the extinct mammals catagory, many of them have "reported sightings". See <a href="../../../c/a/r/Caribbean_Monk_Seal_23f2.html" title="Caribbean Monk Seal">Caribbean Monk Seal</a> for an example. According to some wildlife biologists, the definition of extinction is an organism that is no longer part of an ecosystem. Some would argue that one or two sole surviviors of a species could no longer be considered "part of an ecosystem". Either way you look at it, it's just as depressing. –<span style="background:black; color:yellow; font-weight: bold;">Alex LaPointe</span><a href="../../../a/l/e/User_talk%7EAlex_LaPointe_fc36.html" title="User talk:Alex LaPointe"><span style="color:#CC0000;"><b>talk</b></span></a> 02:52, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'd like to ask the CR camp this question: Do you think there's any chance the mammal can survive? The baiji is a special case, a new phenomenon that will become more common as we destroy ecosystems around the world. It is my opinion that the box should read Functionally extinct. CR imparts too much optimism, while EX is jumping the gun a little. <a href="../../../x/i/n/User%7EXiner_4ce3.html" title="User:Xiner">Xiner</a> 02:56, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In response, in my opinion, there is no chance they will survive. It is likely there are none alive alive today. However the status is still CR (or PE). This poor dolphin is not unique in this respect. There are many other CR species that are also <a href="http://www.google.com.au/search?q=site%3Aiucnredlist.org+%22possibly+extinct%22" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com.au/search?q=site%3Aiucnredlist.org+%22possibly+extinct%22" rel="nofollow">likely extinct</a>. Critically Endangered is not a hopeful category, it's a very grim one. The requirement of being "part of an ecosystem" is, I believe, only to exclude species which are extinct in the wild, and have only captive specimens left. If there is a single lone Baiji left, then it is still part of the river's ecosystem and it is "critically endangered", even if the poor individual does not constitute a viable population by itself.</dd>

<dd>I'd also like to be the first to say that there are problems with the conservation status graphic device. And I think this is really where the problem being discussed stems from. I created this graphic and added it to the taxobox so people could have a high <a href="../../../a/f/f/Affordance.html" title="Affordance">affordance</a> indicator. The main problem, I see manifest in how people have tried to compromise between CR and EX by choosing "EW". EW stands for "extinct in the wild", a step the Chinese River Dolphin will skip, as there are none in captivity. For the rest of the categories, a taxon slides smoothly between them (apart from the old <a href="../../../l/r/2F/LR_cd_ddf5.html" title="LR/cd">LR/cd</a> category). EW also places a wedge between "EX" and "CR" making the perceptual gap between critical endangerment and extinction greater than it is. Perhaps "EW" needs to be <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grayed_out.html" title="Grayed out">grayed out</a> or have some other visual indication that it may be skipped. Or perhaps some other visual indication to show how CR can blend into EX/EW. It can also be confusing that an animal as common as a <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golden_Hamster_e069.html" title="Golden Hamster">hamster</a> can be at risk of becoming extinct in the wild. I should probably be writing this somewhere else. —<a href="../../../p/e/n/User%7EPengo_70fc.html" title="User:Pengo">Pengo</a> <sup><a href="../../../p/e/n/User_talk%7EPengo_b6eb.html" title="User talk:Pengo"><i>talk</i></a> · <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Pengo_3e19.html" title="Special:Contributions/Pengo"><i>contribs</i></a></sup> 05:11, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>EW is definitely wrong for this. There are no living specimens in captivity, so if there are also none in the wild, then there are none anywhere, which means the species is extinct. EX and CR both make more sense than EW. EX and CR are both ok to me given an explanatory note saying there is some uncertainty. I set it to EX yesterday (from EW) not realizing there was an edit war (or maybe I started it, sigh). The current setting of CR with the note "possibly extinct" is ok except I would make the note a little stronger, e.g. add "2006 survey found no surviving specimens" to the note. <a href="../../../6/7/2E/User%7E67.117.130.181.html" title="User:67.117.130.181">67.117.130.181</a> 01:08, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>DD is inappropriate. There is more than enough data to assess the risk of extinction. The only thing that's slightly uncertain is whether the extinction is merely inevitable (functional extinction), or has in fact already occurred. What's up with this edit warring and when can the article be unprotected? I propose putting either "CR" annotated "declared probably extinct", or "EX" annotated "probably extinct per 2006 survey".

<dd>You probably aren't aware that dolphins have been eaten in China since the dawn of mankind and history. It's also a popular food in Korea and to a lesser extent, in Japan (for some reason, popular only in Shizuoka region). Chinese characters for dolphin are "sea-pig" and this indicates that it can be eaten and taste well just as a pig would. Having wrote this, however, I don't thing hunting was the biggest cause for its extinction as if that was the case, it should have been extinct far earlier. --<a href="../../../r/e/v/User%7ERevth_904e.html" title="User:Revth">Revth</a> 00:58, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>豚 is used as part of coupound words in Chinese for non-whale Cetaceans. At least that's been my experience with it. It's tricky to draw a conclusion that it means it's as tasty as suckling pigs; it's like Victor as a name instead of the common word. I could be wrong, but all sorts of dolphins and porpoises carry the character. It's hard to imagine people having tasted every species of them. <a href="../../../x/i/n/User%7EXiner_4ce3.html" title="User:Xiner">Xiner</a> 16:16, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I've removed the <b>Whiteflag Dolphin</b> translation from the article. A common complaint among Chinese linguists is the numerous incorrect substitutions of one Chinese character for another, often due to phonetic similarities, a lack of grasp of the correct word, etc. I don't doubt that the name may be used even in newspapers, but they are frowned upon in higher circles and a direct translations of these non-official variants might give the wrong picture to the uninitated.

<dd>The second character is 鱀 but I can't type the simplified version (it is 既 on top + 鱼 on bottom), 暨 is an incorrect typo. 旗 is a misnomer from Hoy. 鳍 is a possible substitute, both 鱀 and 鳍 are used scientifically but 鱀(既 on top + 鱼 on bottom) is the official one. It is correct that 豚 means pig meat, and 白鱀豚 is sometimes called "pig of the river". But they are held in high esteem as "goddess of the Changjiang" so they are not eaten as food by the local people!

<dd>I'm sorry if you think I was insinuating your claims were unsupported. I was simply asking for references. It is wikipedia policy that any claims in articles must be supported by references and you seem to have been here for long enough that I assume you would know that. If you wish to include your claim in the article, it is your responsibility to come up with a reference, not my responsibility to decide whether your claim has merit. Take a look at <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources">Wikipedia:Citing sources</a>. So far, all you have done is come up with a bunch of other claims which IMHO are OT for this article and are still not supported by references. Perhaps they are supported by references in the other article. I personally couldn't give a damn. We don't cite other articles. If you want to claim China's enviromental policies have failed completely in this article, you need to provide a <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_source_593b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable source">Wikipedia:Reliable source</a> which makes this claim. Coming up with a bunch of facts which may or may not be supported by references is not enough to allow you to make the subsequent claim. That's <a href="../../../o/r/i/Wikipedia%7EOriginal_research_757d.html" title="Wikipedia:Original research">Wikipedia:Original research</a>. Remember it's not truth but <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a> that we strive for. I personally couldn't give a rats arse whether you think I'm a fool. I just want to build a better article. That's what this talk page is for, not for discussing our opinions. I have gone OT before, I admit, but it doesn't mean I don't agree with the philosphy. Frankly speaking, adding a claim made by Haizum which is so far not supported by any references, is not making a better article so I asked for a reference which has still not been provided. If you wish to debate the failings or whatever of China's environmental policies, feel free to do so, but elsewhere. N.B. Not that this matters but I personally think that Chinese environmental policies have in fact failed in many ways. But this is irrelevant since my personal beliefs don't belong in this article. <a href="../../../n/i/l/User%7ENil_Einne_a722.html" title="User:Nil Einne">Nil Einne</a> 11:00, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Completely OT, feel free to remove this. But since Haizum claims to be a romantacist (per his/her user page), someone who thinks things were always better in the past, he/she might want to take a look at what the environmental policies and environment of US and Western European cities were like 50-100 years ago when they were modernising countries (as China is now)... <a href="../../../n/i/l/User%7ENil_Einne_a722.html" title="User:Nil Einne">Nil Einne</a> 11:26, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree. But there is one issue which IMHO needs to be clarified here since Haizum appears to have misunderstood the issue. Haizum suggested we make a change to the article to mention Chin'a failed environmental policies. I asked for a reference since we need a reference if we want to make a claim in an article. If Haizum didn't have a reference, he was welcome to mention this. However instead, he got all defensive and made a bunch of subsequent claims without coming up with a reference. I don't really get why he got so angry. There was no need. I was simply asking for a reference. While I was probably a little less civil then I should have been, given the way Haizum made his suggestion, I felt this acceptable. I myself have occasionally suggested something on a talkpage without a reference. When I do so, I usually make it clear I believe it's true but don't have a reference. Also, I emphasise again that I agree with the facts, I simply think we need a reference if we want to mention themn on the article <a href="../../../n/i/l/User%7ENil_Einne_a722.html" title="User:Nil Einne">Nil Einne</a> 09:51, 18 December 2006 (UTC)

The easiest response was, <a href="../../../e/n/v/Environment_of_China_40ea.html" title="Environment of China">Environment_of_China</a> which contains information wich has been referenced. I thefore provided you with references via an article that focuses on the environmental failures of China.

<p>It's tempting, isn't it?&#160;:( I'd say that if you do it, you'll have to insert more disclaimers that a few may still be living.

<dd>Much of the article is in past tense now. I feel that since it can't really be classified (technically) until 50 years from now, the article (in general) should be in present tense, but of course the 'functionally extinct'ness of it should be mentioned. Having everything in past tense will make it seem that it has been extinct for ages. In the taxobox it is CR: possibly extinct (which is probably the best option) so talking about it as if it is certainly not around anymore is a bit premature. 23:49, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

In 1961 Finlayson wrote that this species was still extant in some areas and that one had been killed between the Tarlton and Jervois ranges, Northern Territory, Australia, as late as 1956. One report in Ride's 'A Guide to the Native Mammals of Australia' of a 1964 specimen from near the Warburton Range, WA, cannot now be substantiated <a href="http://www.australianstamp.com/Coin-web/feature/nature/nailtail.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.australianstamp.com/Coin-web/feature/nature/nailtail.htm" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>. And indeed some bat species became extinct even later, like the <a href="../../../g/u/a/Guam_flying_fox.html" title="Guam flying fox">Guam flying fox</a> (<i>Pteropus tokudae</i>). The last specimen was a female found roosting at Tarague cliff in March 1967. A young bat escaped capture. A bat may have been seen in June 1974, although there is no certainty about that. Sure is that is was gone during a research in 1987. More recent mammal extinctions are indeed subspecies, like the <a href="../../../c/a/s/Caspian_Tiger_48a1.html" title="Caspian Tiger">Caspian Tiger</a>, the <a href="../../../p/y/r/Pyrenean_Ibex_1442.html" title="Pyrenean Ibex">Pyrenean Ibex</a> and the <a href="../../../w/e/s/Western_Black_Rhinoceros_1b81.html" title="Western Black Rhinoceros">Western Black Rhinoceros</a>, or possible hybrids like the <a href="../../../k/o/u/Kouprey.html" title="Kouprey">Kouprey</a>. <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmaas_8441.html" title="User:Pmaas">Peter Maas</a>\<sup><a href="../../../p/m/a/User_talk%7EPmaas_ae24.html" title="User talk:Pmaas">talk</a></sup> 13:16, 17 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>In practically every publication about the dolphin (scientific papers in journals, official documents from governments, conservation issues, etc.) it is Baiji. On Google "Yangtze River dolphin" only gets 87000 or something while baiji gets 307000. The baiji is the dolphin so it is not called the baiji dolphin it is called the baiji, like the boto, or orca. All the organizations dealing with it use Baiji, use Yangtze river dolphin as the secondary term. It seems quite clear cut really, obviously it should mention the other names in the article but the page name should definitely be Baiji. Again see the <a href="http://www.iucnredlist.org/search/details.php/12119/all" class="external text" title="http://www.iucnredlist.org/search/details.php/12119/all" rel="nofollow">IUCN</a> page.

<p>I don't see what the problem is, it seems pretty clear cut that it should be Baiji. The only reason that anything but Baiji is used (ie Chinese River Dolphin or Yangtze River Dolphin) is so that the public would know that it is a dolphin when they read the name. In a news headline the majority of people wouldn't know was a baiji is but a Chinese River Dolphin is obviously a dolphin that lives in a river in China. Since wikipedia is not a news agency and people who want to find out about the Baiji go to Baiji. The Scientific name is <i>Lipotes vexillifer</i> while the english name is Baiji. It is the most common among scientific and everything else, just look at the search results on Google. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChris_huh_ba50.html" title="User:Chris huh"><font face="Old English Text MT" color="darkblue" size="4">C</font></a><a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChris_huh_ba50.html" title="User:Chris huh"><font color="darkblue" size="2">hris_huh</font></a><sup><a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChris_huh_1477.html" title="User talk:Chris huh"><font color="orange" size="1">talk</font></a></sup> 11:45, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well baiji+dolphin still comes up with more than "Chinese River Dolphin". Anyway i don't think how many articles google comes up with, particularly when it is so close, is a very good way to measure it. There are billions of sites out there, many of them with wrong information. We should really be looking at what most of the articles about species and animals from wikipedia look at - IUCN and other taxonomic/conservation organisations. Everything i have seen about the baiji has referred to it as the baiji apart from a few news sites and a couple of private sites owned by someone who thinks to animal is cute and wants to talk about it. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChris_huh_ba50.html" title="User:Chris huh"><font face="Old English Text MT" color="darkblue" size="4">C</font></a><a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChris_huh_ba50.html" title="User:Chris huh"><font color="darkblue" size="2">hris_huh</font></a><sup><a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChris_huh_1477.html" title="User talk:Chris huh"><font color="orange" size="1">talk</font></a></sup> 12:34, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Let us discuss the pronoun usage for the captive specimens, specifically Qui Qui. Qui Qui was male; not female, not hermaphroditic, and not a member of a species that reproduced by asexual means. Thus, I believe he should be described with a male pronoun. The neuter pronoun 'it' is useful for specimens of unknown (or both or neither) sexes, but where any animal's sex is known, I don't think it's inappropriate to use the appropriate gendered pronoun. --<a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESparky_the_Seventh_Chaos_dc6c.html" title="User:Sparky the Seventh Chaos">Sparky Lurkdragon</a> 07:28, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

This use of 'it' also got bad press when various regimes used it as a rhetorical device to dehumanise their enemies, implying that they were little better than animals. Conversely, few people object to the use of the impersonal pronouns for animals other than pets.</i></dd>

<dd>I will say I'm one of those "few people"; non-pets are just as conscious as pets, and I would no sooner call a male robin an 'it' than I would my cat. I admit my bias may be showing - as far as I'm concerned, the possession of or desire to posses male reproductive organs is plenty to be addressed with a male pronoun, and since we couldn't ask Qui Qui if Chinese River Dolphins had any concept of <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transsexuality.html" title="Transsexuality">transsexuality</a>, I would call Qui Qui a 'he'.</dd>

A factory producing handbags and gloves from Baiji skin opened but the operation was short-lived because the animals quickly became scarce (Zhou and Zhang 1991)."

I don't know if Chinese sources are allowed here so I'm just putting this on the talk page right now. <a href="../../../x/i/n/User%7EXiner_4ce3.html" title="User:Xiner">Xiner</a> (<a href="../../../x/i/n/User_talk%7EXiner_ca85.html" title="User talk:Xiner">talk</a>, <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Xiner_41d9.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Xiner">email</a>) 03:38, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The Wuhan Conservation Foundation also offers <a href="http://www.ibaiji.org/cjtl_qqd23n.asp" class="external text" title="http://www.ibaiji.org/cjtl_qqd23n.asp" rel="nofollow">a history</a> of Qi-Qi, in which they also mention that female (Zhen-zhen), which lived for 2.5 years with Qi-Qi, but when she was about to become sexually mature, she died of pneumonia in 1998-09. They found another female in late <b>1995</b>, but she died when she "touched the net" (got caught in the fence?) half a year later.

It says only three baijis were ever captured -- the two in 1986 and one in 1995, while died in the net (again, fence?) when the reserve was flooded. This is wrong according to the chart, but again, no mention of anything in 1998. I'll thus be bold and remove the sentence "A female, found in Chongming Island near Shanghai in 1998, did not eat any of the provided food and starved to death within a month" until there's a citation for it.

<dd>Do you have the source for that? It'd clear up the mystery once and for all. Anyway, I'd say it's not as notable b/c the article already mentions a stranded dead in 2004. <a href="../../../x/i/n/User%7EXiner_4ce3.html" title="User:Xiner">Xiner</a> (<a href="../../../x/i/n/User_talk%7EXiner_ca85.html" title="User talk:Xiner">talk</a>, <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Xiner_41d9.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Xiner">email</a>) 15:57, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm new, but I speak near-native Chinese and I'm able to say Baiji correctly. I noticed the to-do List lists an audio file of the proper pronunciation of Baiji as something well, 'To-Do.' I'd like to do this, but I'm unsure as to how I would do so. Does anyone know how to do this?

<dd>Nothing. I had <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBeastie_Bot_f121.html" title="User:Beastie Bot">Beastie Bot</a> include the population trend (up, down, unknown..) this when it went through fixing conservation statuses, with the plan to include this information on the taxobox, but currently it's not used.
