Bailey Quarters (Jan Smithers) and Andy Travis (Gary Sandy)</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><b>Bailey Quarters</b> is a character on the television sitcom, <i><a href="../../../w/k/r/WKRP_in_Cincinnati_4956.html" title="WKRP in Cincinnati">WKRP in Cincinnati</a></i>. She was played by actress <a href="../../../j/a/n/Jan_Smithers_9ca5.html" title="Jan Smithers">Jan Smithers</a>. She is widely considered to be the most wholesome member of the WKRP team, and in one episode, she mentions that she was a member of her college's choir.</p>
<p><a name="WKRP_roles" id="WKRP_roles"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/i/Bailey_Quarters_8810.html" title="Edit section: WKRP roles">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">WKRP roles</span></h2>
<p>Bailey originally came from Chicago and studied journalism at <a href="../../../o/h/i/Ohio_State_University_2761.html" title="Ohio State University">Ohio State University</a>, where she graduated <a href="../../../s/u/m/Summa_Cum_Laude_0099.html" title="Summa Cum Laude">Summa Cum Laude</a>. Her ambition is eventually to be a broadcasting executive, but though intelligent and talented, she was held back early on by her extreme shyness and fear of speaking up. Station manager <a href="../../../a/r/t/Arthur_Carlson_788a.html" title="Arthur Carlson">Arthur Carlson</a> can't even remember who she is or whether "Bailey" is a man or a woman.</p>
<p>She is originally in charge of just the billing and station traffic, but that changes when <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andy_Travis_2af9.html" title="Andy Travis">Andy Travis</a> takes over as the program director of WKRP. One of his first acts is to give Bailey more duties, including being an on-air news reporter, over the strenuous objections of sexist sales manager <a href="../../../h/e/r/Herb_Tarlek_03bc.html" title="Herb Tarlek">Herb Tarlek</a> and news director <a href="../../../l/e/s/Les_Nessman_6662.html" title="Les Nessman">Les Nessman</a>, who feels threatened. In the episode "Dear Liar," a take-off on the <a href="../../../j/a/n/Janet_Cooke_ffde.html" title="Janet Cooke">Janet Cooke</a> scandal, Bailey writes a news story that is partly fictional, which could have cost the station its <a href="../../../b/r/o/Broadcast_license.html" title="Broadcast license">broadcast license</a>, though she decides against using it. It only becomes an issue when Les jealously plagiarizes it on the air.</p>
<p>As the series goes on, Bailey becomes more assertive and more able to speak up for herself. She also becomes better at standing up to her nemesis Herb; in one episode, she throws lighted matches at Herb's polyester suit, threatening to set it on fire.</p>
<p>She also becomes increasingly associated with <a href="../../../e/n/v/Environmentalism.html" title="Environmentalism">environmentalism</a> and other activist causes. One episode begins with her circulating a petition against <a href="../../../n/u/c/Nuclear_power.html" title="Nuclear power">nuclear power</a>; in another episode, she mentions that she spent the weekend campaigning for the <a href="../../../e/q/u/Equal_Rights_Amendment_5e53.html" title="Equal Rights Amendment">Equal Rights Amendment</a>. In the episode "Circumstantial Evidence," while testifying in court, she starts complaining to the judge about the plight of baby <a href="../../../p/i/n/Pinniped.html" title="Pinniped">seals</a> and <a href="../../../d/o/l/Dolphins.html" title="Dolphins">dolphins</a>. Some of these character traits came from the actress who played Bailey, <a href="../../../j/a/n/Jan_Smithers_9ca5.html" title="Jan Smithers">Jan Smithers</a>, who was herself involved with animal-rights and clean-energy causes; as with many of the <i>WKRP</i> characters, elements of the actor were incorporated into the character, giving the character more depth as the show went on.</p>
<p>Bailey's character was overshadowed by that of <a href="../../../j/e/n/Jennifer_Marlowe_47eb.html" title="Jennifer Marlowe">Jennifer Marlowe</a> (played by <a href="../../../l/o/n/Loni_Anderson_3caa.html" title="Loni Anderson">Loni Anderson</a>), the blonde bombshell of the station. The relationship between Jennifer and Bailey have often been likened to that between <a href="../../../g/i/n/Ginger_Grant_e1a7.html" title="Ginger Grant">Ginger</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mary_Ann_Summers_5f18.html" title="Mary Ann Summers">Mary Ann</a> from <i><a href="../../../g/i/l/Gilligan%27s_Island_f6c0.html" title="Gilligan's Island">Gilligan's Island</a></i>.</p>
<p><a name="Personal_life" id="Personal_life"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/i/Bailey_Quarters_8810.html" title="Edit section: Personal life">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Personal life</span></h2>
<p>Bailey has an on-again, off-again romance with <a href="../../../d/r/2E/Dr._Johnny_Fever_5146.html" title="Dr. Johnny Fever">Dr. Johnny Fever</a>. In the early episodes, it is suggested that Bailey looks up to Johnny as her mentor in the world of broadcasting, but that she also has a crush on him, which leads her to ask him out on a date in the second-season opener, "For Love Or Money." However, their relationship never seems to go farther than the occasional date. (It is implied at the end of "For Love or Money" and "Mike Fright" that they have had at least casual sexual relations, though in both cases, it could be discounted as hyperbole.) In season 4's "Rumors," when Johnny stays at Bailey's place for a few days, Bailey is infuriated by the gossip that they are sleeping together -- disappointing Johnny, who was hoping that the rumors would come true.</p>
<p>Unlike her friend Jennifer, who mostly dates wealthy older men, Bailey seems to have a different taste in men, dating not only Johnny, but (in the episode "In Concert") a manic-depressive divinity student with a serious drinking problem. In "Dear Liar", there is a hint of mutual attraction between Bailey and Andy Travis; while delivering a reprimand to Bailey regarding the fake news story, Andy concludes by saying should she ever pull a stunt like that again, she would be "the best-looking woman on the unemployment line". Bailey's response is purely non-verbal, but her appreciation of the compliment is quite plain.</p>
<p>Her occasional references to her family suggest that she does not get along well with her parents, which may explain why she left Chicago. In one episode, she mentions that a visit home consists of relatives asking her if she's "Involved? Engaged? Pregnant?" In another episode, she attempts to describe her relationship with her father, but is left speechless with anger. In a third episode, Mr. Carlson mentions that "I talked to Bailey's father and he said I could shoot her."</p>

<p>Jan Smithers was one of the few <i>WKRP</i> cast members who was the first choice for the role she played. Creator <a href="../../../h/u/g/Hugh_Wilson_3fd5.html" title="Hugh Wilson">Hugh Wilson</a> said that despite Smithers' lack of experience (she had never done a situation comedy before), she was perfect for the character of Bailey as he had conceived her: "Other actresses read better for the part," Wilson recalled, "but they were <i>playing</i> shy. Jan <i>was</i> shy."</p>
