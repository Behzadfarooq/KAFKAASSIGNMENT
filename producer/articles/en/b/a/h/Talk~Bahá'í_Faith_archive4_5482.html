<dd>" In order to have some Official "Accreditation", books published by Bahai´s on the Baha´i Faith are required to go through a literary revision process that verifies the correctness of the references and if the views expressed are in accordance to baha´i doctrine. This process was created by <a href="../../../s/h/o/Shoghi_Effendi_4011.html" title="Shoghi Effendi">Shoghi Effendi</a> as a form of protection from misinformation, this has however lend some Baha´i scholars to leave the Baha´i Faith, acussing the Baha´i Administration of <a href="../../../c/e/n/Censorship.html" title="Censorship">Censorship</a>.

<dd>Sometimes you'll never win though I guess, but it is a bit of a textbook Bahá'í response&#160;:). Although I don't have as much problem with it as most, I think generally a lot of people (ie - the neutral point of view) would find this as censorship so this should be reasonably prominent. By the way I might be wrong in thats its not a "Literary review" - its just "the review process" or the "Bahá'í studies review" process. Mixing it up with my dissertation where a literary review is when you review other related literature on the topic - Sorry!</dd>

<p>Title: Bahá'í Studies Review process and censorship</p>
<p>The Bahá'í administration impose prepublication censorship called the "Bahá'í Studies Review Process" on all material written by members about the Faith on the topic. All such material must first be scanned by a review committee of the Bahá'í National Spiritual Assembly of the country in which the text is to be published for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Conformity with the Bahá'í writings</li>
<li>Accuracy</li>
<li>Dignity in presentation</li>
</ul>
<p>This was a temporary policy introduced many decades ago by Shoghi Effendi, but is still in force. Although Bahá'ís defend this as a way of protecting the young religion from misinformation, some this has led to some Bahá'ís being disillusioned and leaving the Faith citing it restricts their freedom of speech.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>

<dd>Tom, I don't like the word "censorship" in an encyclopedia article. It sounds too negative. Yes, it's a horrible policy. Yes, its insensitive application has caused prominent academic former-Bahá'ís to leave the faith. But it's not like what used to go on in Soviet Russia, where people who published things the authorities didn't like were sent to prison/psychiatric wards. -- <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaulHammond_ae3e.html" title="User:PaulHammond">PaulHammond</a> 17:37, Feb 6, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Just noticed that the word "censorship" appeared in the neutral source you were quoting, and you have basically quoted that along with working in what the Bahá'í guidelines on review say. I think the result is quite balanced, so the paragraph as you suggest is fine, but the section heading should be something like "Bahá'í prepublication review", or, if there are any details about how this policy affected academics like Denis MacEoin and Juan Cole, the title could be "Bahá'í prepublication review controversy". Also, there should be a link to your source after you quote it. - <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaulHammond_ae3e.html" title="User:PaulHammond">PaulHammond</a> 19:08, Feb 7, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The section "Restrictions on freedom in the Bahá'í community" refers to <i>"certain limitations on personal freedom in the Bahá'í community"</i> without being specific. It refers only to prepublication review and inappropriate debate on listservs. These relate to publishing only. Bahá'ís who do not publish--and that is the vastest majority--are not restricted. What we non-publishers have to do is merely practice healthy self-discipline. For example, I try not to make unsubstantiated claims on Wikipedia, but that is not a restriction of my freedom. The "Restrictions on freedom in the Bahá'í community" heading and the first sentance are therefore grossly misleading. I therefore consider that (1) the title should be "Prepublication Restrictions in the Bahá'í Community", (2) that the first sentence should refer only to publishing, and (3) "For example" should be deleted. I altered and tidied up the paragraph earlier but 163.17.101.125 (from Taiwan?) changed it without explanation apart from saying it was 100% correct and that I'm a bigot...well that's a first! The Jargon File defines Bigot as <i>A person who is religiously attached to a particular computer, language, operating system, editor, or other tool...</i>, which I find reassuring to some extent. --<a href="../../../o/c/c/User%7EOccamy_964a.html" title="User:Occamy">Occamy</a> 19:42, 7 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>There have not been any dissenting opinions to what I wrote above, i.e. that the restriction is on publishing and not otherwise. The title is therefore misleading by referring to <i>"Restrictions on freedom in the Bahá'í community"</i>. It should read <i>" Publishing Restrictions in the Bahá'í Community"</i>. <a href="../../../o/c/c/User%7EOccamy_964a.html" title="User:Occamy">Occamy</a> 11:09, 21 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I do not want to engage in Wiki ping pong with Martin2000 over "Restrictions on Publishing in the Bahá'í Community" section. He wants the title to be "Restrictions on Freedom in the Bahá'í Community" but refers to no personal restrictions except for speaking with Covenant-breakers, and that subject is covered amply in the Laws section lower in the article...<i>In addition to observing religious laws (see below)...</i> Being declared a Covenant-breaker is similar to <a href="../../../c/h/e/Cherem.html" title="Cherem">Cherem</a> in Judaism, <a href="../../../e/x/c/Excommunication.html" title="Excommunication">Excommunication</a> in Christianity and <a href="../../../t/a/k/Takfir.html" title="Takfir">Takfir</a> in Islamic law, so this is not unique to the Bahá'í Faith such that it needs to be amplified in this section. Therefore, by removing the superfluous Covenant-breaking issue, the only issue being dealt with is pre-publication review and publishing on the internet. These are not <i>restrictions on personal freedom</i>. Also the statement "Such restrictions can be seen as..." is literally POV. The situation is clarified by reference to "Opponents of the Bahá'í administration...." It is for this reason that I am insisting on the unambiguous NPOV "Restrictions on Publishing..." references. <a href="../../../o/c/c/User%7EOccamy_964a.html" title="User:Occamy">Occamy</a> 20:29, 7 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I have reverted Martin2000's reversion but have added a paragraph about the restriction of not being permitted to associate with Covenant-breakers, as a compromise; it looks odd but.... The point is that all laws are restrictions on personal freedom, and this article is not the place to discuss whether laws are needed or not; that anarchist philosophy is likely discussed elsewhere in Wiki. Therefore restrictions on publishing freedom should either be presented in a separate section--as it is now--or be discussed under the Other Laws and Ordinances section.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Putting things in perspective, the Restriction on Publishing Section should be presented after Other Laws and Ordinances, which itself needs tidying up as a major section on its own. <a href="../../../o/c/c/User%7EOccamy_964a.html" title="User:Occamy">Occamy</a> 09:36, 8 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Covenant of Baha'u'llah and division</span></h2>
<p>Hi - I took out "according to Bahá'í sources" from Abdu'l Baha, and put the ref back behind "Baha'u'llah appointed...". Mirza Muhammad Ali (AB's half brother) did criticize AB's leadership, and tried to usurp his position, but if we are going to talk about this, I think it needs a paragraph in "Covenant and division" after the mention of Subh-i-Azal, not something this oblique. Haven't put this in yet, since the article is long and will need some work on other sections too once we have settled where all the critical comments are going to live in the end. How much about Mirza Muhammad Ali is there at <a href="../../../%60/a/b/%60Abdu%27l-Bah%C3%A1_f3c9.html" title="`Abdu'l-Bahá">`Abdu'l-Bahá</a> already? <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaulHammond_ae3e.html" title="User:PaulHammond">PaulHammond</a> 16:55, Feb 8, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sorry to be obstructive here, but I think this should not be taken out. The half brother "tried to usurp" is alrady POV, implying he had no right to that position. He probably thought otherwise - otherwise he would not have tried - unless of course you can give evidence that he knew he was not supposed to but decided to give it a go anyway. I do not suggest that we go into a major discussion who waa sright here or not, but either teh Acc Bahai sources go in - or and probably better - we report simply the fact of his succession - without commenting on legitimacy or otherwise and leave this debate to teh article on the man himself. <a href="../../../r/e/f/User%7ERefdoc_5ef2.html" title="User:Refdoc">Refdoc</a> 17:08, 8 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><i>The Will of the divine Testator is this: It is incumbent upon the Aghsan, the Afnan and My Kindred to turn, one and all, their faces towards the Most Mighty Branch. Consider that which We have revealed in Our Most Holy Book: 'When the ocean of My presence hath ebbed and the Book of My Revelation is ended, turn your faces toward Him Whom God hath purposed, Who hath branched from this Ancient Root.' The object of this sacred verse is none other except the Most Mighty Branch [Abdu'l-Baha]. Thus have We graciously revealed unto you Our potent Will, and I am verily the Gracious, the All-Powerful. Verily God hath ordained the station of the Greater Branch [Muhammad Ali] to be beneath that of the Most Great Branch [Abdu'l-Baha]. He is in truth the Ordainer, the All-Wise. We have chosen 'the Greater' after 'the Most Great', as decreed by Him Who is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.</i> (Baha'u'llah, Tablets of Baha'u'llah, p. 221) --<a href="../../../o/c/c/User%7EOccamy_964a.html" title="User:Occamy">Occamy</a> 22:44, 8 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Does it make sense to add the specific texts to the article that pass authority to Abdu’l-Baha, Shoghi Effendi and the Universal House of Justice, i.e. the Covenant? --<a href="../../../o/c/c/User%7EOccamy_964a.html" title="User:Occamy">Occamy</a> 06:44, 9 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>No it does not. This page is not about the jsutification of succession, but about the Bahai faith. If I as an outsider read it I do not want to know how various middle eastern princelings justified their succession or competing claims, but I want to know waht Bahai faith is about(World peace and the lot) . We do link to the Orthodox Bahais, We do explain in a short sentence each time that this succession did not go completely unchallenged, but that the majority followed the main man. An dthat should be enough. More on the biographgical pages.</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Then we have a section on the convenant itself and <i>there</i> we explain why it is an important thing and how it works and how it is justified. We explain the gist and leave plenty of references for the interested reader. My 2p <a href="../../../r/e/f/User%7ERefdoc_5ef2.html" title="User:Refdoc">Refdoc</a> 08:05, 9 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Indeed - are you British, Refdoc? (2p?) As I understand it, Baha'u'llah's Will and Testament appointed Abdu'l Baha as his successor, and Mirza Muhammad Ali as the leader of the faith <b>after</b> Abdu'l Baha. About half of Abdu'l Baha's Will and Testament was all about justifying to the Bahá'ís why it was necessary that he change the order of succession to Shoghi Effendi, and make a new post, the Guardian. (It's fairly obvious - instead of supporting Abdu'l Baha, Ali had acted to undermine him at every turn, making trouble for him with the Ottoman authorities, and IIRC attempt to poison him. To me, the question then becomes why didn't Baha'u'llah realize this was likely to happen?). But, the order of succession was clear in Baha'u'llah's Will. - <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaulHammond_ae3e.html" title="User:PaulHammond">PaulHammond</a> 12:51, Feb 10, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am somewhat fed up with the dublication of effort both on this page and on the biographical pages. Every addition will only lead to further additions here <i>and</i> on the biographical pages. At the same time we get all the time the warning that the page is too long.</p>
<p>I have therefore conducted a wholesale cull, removed absolutely everything which is worth debating within the biographical sections and hope this will make the article more lightweight, allowing concentration on the doctrinal etc matters.

<dd>In the latest two edits, Amir has deleted substantial biographical parts referring to Baha'u’llah and Abdu'l-Baha, yet added back the paragraph on Baha'u'llah's wives. A rigorous and NPOV Bahá'í Faith article requires biographical information, but only information that explains why the Bahá'í Faith is what it is now. Using this clear--and belatedly obvious--criterion, (1) the wives entry becomes irrelevant and (2) too much about Abdu’l-Baha has been deleted because it no longer explains how the Baha’i Faith grew so fast in America and Europe. Comments please.--<a href="../../../o/c/c/User%7EOccamy_964a.html" title="User:Occamy">Occamy</a> 06:42, 9 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It was not Amir who deleted stuff this time. It was me - as I explained - and i put it up for discussion. I thought carefully and still think the doubling up of information here and on the biographical pages invites to go overe every debate twice - how many wives did Baha'ullah have and was he justified to have them, why did Abdul Baha become successor and not his brother - are the scriptures given justifying this actually trustworthy etc etc etc. You see wo could go on and on and on. While I think this is good and worthy, it does not need to be done twice - here and on the individuals pages. It needs to be done once and thoroughly, while all other pages simply contain the barebones of these biographies and refer otherwise. I do see you point wrt growth in Europe etc, but again this is a point much larger than just Abdul'Baha's biography and needs to be dealt with explicitly. One needs to take into account the post war situation where a lot of people were disillusioned with traditional values etc, etc etc</dd>

<dd>Yes I agree - some overlap is necessary. But I would suggest that any overlap resulting in major debate and major parallel growth is not necessary and not good, beyond a minimum note - e.g. "He published 1000 books pamplets and letters (for more information see...)" This makes it clear that the literary activity is crucial and important, but more is there to know - and then go into the full length and detail of the debate on the individual's page. Similarly I pressed for saying simply "Abdul Baha succeeded Baha'ullah" rather then debating the ins and outs of teh succession and the relevant Ketab-e Aqdas quotes as this would bulk up the page <i>without any clear benefit</i>, but then have a thorough discussion of claims and counter claims at the relevant biographical page. <a href="../../../r/e/f/User%7ERefdoc_5ef2.html" title="User:Refdoc">Refdoc</a> 11:49, 9 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Removal of "excommunication"</span></h2>
<p>PaulHammond removed a sentence just now wrt Abdul'Baha removing as covenant breakers large parts of his father's family. This is a matter which - if substantiated is of major inmportance and should not be removed - particularly not without a suitable comment on the talk pages.</p>
<p>I am slowly despairing with this page - it appears that where one hole is not yet stitched up someone comes and tears the next one right next to it. And while my impression has been that while Amir has been largely responsible for a lot of the recent POV edits, unsubstantiated edits and pointless deletes marring this page, a number of other users do not seem to hesitate to take similar measures. Not good! <a href="../../../r/e/f/User%7ERefdoc_5ef2.html" title="User:Refdoc">Refdoc</a> 12:55, 10 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The whole question of Covenant, division, expulsion et al is both highly sensitive and highly complex. While the vastest majority accept the Bahá'í Faith as it is, there have been a relatively few who have not accepted a change in authority to the new head of the faith. There were followers of Baha'u'llah who did not accept Abdu'l-Baha; those who did not accept Shoghi Effendi, and last, those who did not accept the Universal House of Justice. And there are many Muslims who interpret Muhammad's title of "Seal of the Prophets" to mean--in effect--that nobody could claim to be a fresh Manifestation of God, and that Baha'u'llah was an impostor. They can raise various issues that at first sight look negative: three wives, expulsions from the family and so on. It takes only a few words in the article to raise a dissenting claim or an attack, which usually requires a voluminous answer by way of background, context and scholarly comment.</dd>
<dd>This puts those wanting to maintain a NPOV in a dilemma: try to squeeze a long explanation into a relatively short article, or to delete or move the accusing passage elsewhere or into the Discussion page for further consideration. I too am disappointed that those wanting to present alternative POVs choose to rush them into the article without pror discussion, which can be frustrating.</dd>
<dd>Part of the solution will be a create an article that expands the Covenant of Baha'u'llah section, listing the specific texts that gave authority to the next head of the Bahá'í Faith. --<a href="../../../o/c/c/User%7EOccamy_964a.html" title="User:Occamy">Occamy</a> 14:00, 10 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Refdoc, the point is that Abdu'l Baha certainly made Muhammad Ali a Covenant Breaker - but as to "all the other wives and all the rest of Baha'u'llah's children, and this fact is well known by all Bahá'ís" - that is just wrong. First, I thought we had got to the point that we were putting the detail into the biographies. Second, this needs substantiation. Third, I was sure this had been removed before. Fourth "and all the Bahá'ís know that their faith is a lie" is something only Amir believes.

<dd>The Bahá'í faith keeps extremely accurate records on membership. Virtually all Bahá'ís sign a "declaration card" when they accept the faith. In some nations, such as Vietnam, signing a declaration card can draw problems with the government and in these nations no accurate records exist to my knowledge. Anyone formally withdrawing from the Bahá'í faith is similarly supposed to advise the administration of this, but some people simply become "inactive" as is the case with any religion.

<p>Martin2000 suggests that the Bahá'í administration's six million estimate of the number Bahá'ís is too high. It is likely to be broadly correct, and maybe a little conservative. Bear in mind that the number would include Bahá'ís who are no longer active in their local Bahá'í community, which would be the same for statistics on all religious adherents. The following numbers come from [<a href="http://www.religioustolerance.org/bahai4.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.religioustolerance.org/bahai4.htm" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>] and provide an idea of the geographic spread of the worldwide Bahá'í community. I don't know where Britannica sources its data, but it is a start.... <i>According to the 1992 Encyclopaedia Britannica Book of the Year, the Bahá'í Faith had established "significant communities" in more countries and territories than any other religion except for Christianity. They were organized in 205 areas worldwide vs. 254 for Christianity. According to The Bahá'í World, this has since increased to 235 countries and territories, including over 2,100 racial, ethnic and tribal groups. Encyclopædia Britannica Online estimates that they had about 7.4 million members worldwide in mid-2002:</i></p>
<ul>
<li><i>1.8 million in Africa</i></li>
<li>'3.6 million in Asia</li>
<li><i>0.13 million in Europe</i></li>
<li><i>0.91 in Latin America</i></li>
<li><i>0.81 in Northern America</i></li>
<li><i>0.12 in Oceania.</i></li>
</ul>
<p><i>The Bahá'í Faith states that it currently has about 6 million members worldwide, including about 2.5 million adherents in India and 140,000 in the US.</i> <a href="../../../o/c/c/User%7EOccamy_964a.html" title="User:Occamy">Occamy</a> 22:38, 11 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Actually I blocked Martin2000 and his sock puppets for very disruptive activity, including extremely insulting behavior, sock puppetting, block evasion and (as it happened) wildly excessive reverting. His activities are also on the cusp of vandalism, but there is no consensus for that. He is currently unblocked. I will soon remove protection from the three protected Bahai-related articles and this will be his last chance to behave himself before I consider asking for arbitration, which I expect to get, with a revert parole, personal insult parole, and ban from altering the placement of pictures in Bahair-related articles seeming like the most likely remedy. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 11:42, 5 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It would be TOTALLY inappropriate to remove the section about his three CONCURRENT wives. The whole idea is to let the reader know about this discrepancy in the Bahai religion, that the prophet of this religion himself had three CONCURRENT wives. This is quite important for the non-Bahai (and I would say even for the Bahai) readers to know. Removing it would be tantamount to censorship and POV.

<dd>The fact that Bahaullah had three concurrent wives is quite relevant to an article about Bahai Faith. If it needs to be explained, then so be it, but it is very relevant because this religion at first declares "only two wives" and later, a clear "two" is "interpreted" as "one"!! Therefore, it is quite important and relevant if the article does contain the fact that the founder of this religion himself had three concurrent wives, even for some time after he declated his new religion to the world (and according to his claim, he already knew about this religion some 11 years prior to its "international debut" but had kept it all to himself in "concealment") --<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmir1_4d3d.html" title="User:Amir1">Amir</a> 19:02, 17 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Also, I would cut the "brief timeline" down to 4 to 6 elements... refering to the "non brief" one on a different page. Or, put it in paragrpah form and dump the brief timeline all together. <a href="../../../r/b/o/User%7ERboatright_c3e8.html" title="User:Rboatright">Rick Boatright</a> 02:48, 9 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Syncretic</span></h2>
<p>Squideshi inserted that the Bahá'í Faith is "syncretic". Its own article states that Syncretism is the attempt to reconcile disparate, even opposing, beliefs and to meld practices of various schools of thought. While the Bahá'í Faith does build on the spiritual values of other faiths, it brings so much new material that it would be misleading to describe it as syncretic. But I am not an expert in these matters and would value the opinions of others. <a href="../../../o/c/c/User%7EOccamy_964a.html" title="User:Occamy">Occamy</a> 19:59, 8 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If its unsourced I reckon get rid of it. If it is sourced then change it to "some feel it is syncretic". The Bahá'ís faith is recognised as independent by all but the most fanatical.

<dd>Doesn't that impose a POV though? Saying something is syncretic also implies its motives were exactly that (to resolve any difficulties within a religion by adopting other "better" practices) - whereas Bahá'ís believe that Baha'u'llah was the fulfilment of a prophecy and brought his own dispensation. In its present form it implies that is widely acknowledged - I've never heard anyone describe it that way before. Bahá'ís certainly wouldn't agree with it. I reckon that we shouldn't include it unless a paper comes up in which case it should be changed to "which some view as syncretic". Obviously just one person's opinion. -- <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomhab_fa0f.html" title="User:Tomhab">Tomhab</a> 02:14, 9 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have rewritten the sentence and added a source. The source is incidentally Bahai in origin, and disputes the assumption, but it also says that the majority of religious studies text books describe Bahai faith as syncretic - so i think this really covers both angles.

<dd>Refdoc inserted in the article that the "Bahá'í Faith is <i>commonly perceived</i> as syncretic." I believe that this statement goes too far as it is not a <i>common perception</i>, even according t Refdoc's source. I scanned the first forty Google results for "Bahá'í Syncretic". Among them, only the Ankerberg Theological Research Institute [<a href="http://www.ankerberg.com/Articles/apologetics/AP0702W3.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ankerberg.com/Articles/apologetics/AP0702W3.htm" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>] seems to argue that the Bahá'í Faith is syncretic.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>My personal experience is that some people consider the Bahá'í Faith to be syncretic when first hearing how it includes the spiritual principles of the major faiths. But this opinion changes when they learn how innovative its social laws and objectives are, and this includes the Bahá'í administration. After all, the world's major faiths differ in their social teachings and not in their spiritual teachings: love thy neighbour, the golden rule and so on. If <i>one of the most common assumptions about the Bahá'í Faith stated in Religious Studies textbooks is that it is a syncretism</i>, that is a source that is disputed by scholarly analysis such as Refdoc's source. That is the reason I amended Refdoc's latest edit. <a href="../../../o/c/c/User%7EOccamy_964a.html" title="User:Occamy">Occamy</a> 14:06, 10 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Writing that the Bahá'í Faith is syncretic is misleading.

<p>I think it can be safely assumed that many think it is syncretic and others (mostly Bahais) will not agree. To write anything (much) different would be giving in to one POV or another.</p>
<p>Leaving this aside I have edited the sentence before as it appeared as if Krishna Mohammad etc are factually messengers of God rather than in teh eys of Bahais etc. Now it should be clearer that this is actually Bahá'í teaching ratrher than common ground.

<p>Look, the INTRO PARAGRAPH says that many scholars think the Bahá'í Faith is syncretic. I accept that. But see <a href="http://bahai-library.com/articles/rg.syncretism.html" class="external free" title="http://bahai-library.com/articles/rg.syncretism.html" rel="nofollow">http://bahai-library.com/articles/rg.syncretism.html</a> if you think there is no basis for a DISPUTE on this. In the mean time, Martin has managed YET ANOTHER revert (nitram0020...) and I'm up against 3rr on it. So, I'm logging off, and hopefully by morning, more sane heads will have chimed in here. I _thought_ we had a concensus regarding syncretic. I thought. It's in THE OPENING PARAGRAPH. but to put it in the opening SENTENCE, as a barefaced fact, instead of a DESCRIPTION in the opening sentence is just Martin's anti-Bahá'í bigotry. I've swallowed a lot on these articles to get NPOV. this, tho, is a LITTLE TOO MUCH.

<dd>Oh, Squideshi did that did he? He was also the person who inserted the Bahá'í Faith as an example of a Syncretic faith into the article on Syncretism (I went and checked it out yesterday, since Martin seemed so exercised about the fact that reading that article would change everyone's minds such that we would all capitulate to his revert-warring without discussion). I can see why there's a case to be made that the Bahá'í Faith is a syncretism - and why several old paper encyclopedias refer to the Bahá'í Faith as a syncretism. My understanding of why this is wrong is that the word generally tends to apply to philosophical systems that rely on taking parts from other systems and religions. I think the Bahá'ís tend to resist this as a descriptor of their faith because of the undertone to it of "this is a man-made system", whereas the Bahá'ís themselves understand their faith as a new revelation from God. It kind of ties in with Iranian opponents who justify their persecution of Bahá'ís by the argument that the faith is not *really* a religion, but rather a political system (or else something invented by British or Russian spies in order to infiltrate their country. These days, Israeli spies invented it is sometimes heard).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Seems to me it might be that the syncretism article is the one that needs editing. Still, "the Bahá'í Faith is Syncretic" should not be entered as if it were a clear, uncontested fact that the Bahá'ís themselves are perfectly happy with - because that just ain't the truth. <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaulHammond_ae3e.html" title="User:PaulHammond">PaulHammond</a> 10:43, Apr 3, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I would search for non-pejorative applications of the word "syncretic" to the Bahá'í Faith, by scholars and others. If none are found, I would leave it out. If any are found, I would write in the main article "In view of . . . some people call the Bahá'í Faith 'syncretic.'" If there are few considerations that go into calling it syncretic, they could be listed within the sentence. If there are many, the sentence could read "In view of the considerations discussed at (link), some people call the Bahá'í Faith 'syncretic.'" JimHabegger 03:15, 23 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>While we wait for the disputes over the Bahá'í Faith page to settle themselves, can we please change the top photo of the Dehli Temple? It is a poor photo of the building and it seems to have a numbing effect on the brain (mine at least). This temple is probably the most recognisable Bahá'í thing after the shrine of the Bab, and I therefore recommend [<a href="http://www.bahai-biblio.org/centre-photo/lieux/temple/new-delhi/aube-newdelhi/tnewda~23m~new-delhi-aube.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bahai-biblio.org/centre-photo/lieux/temple/new-delhi/aube-newdelhi/tnewda~23m~new-delhi-aube.htm" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>] as a replacement image. The site owner has given his permission (see his message under Temple Photograph section above) and I could not find a more interesting image of the temple on the site. Alternatively we can follow the pattern of most of the religion articles by using the nine-pointed star; but I can't find a suitable image. FYI, here is the list of images on the pages of the major religions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Juadaism: Star of David, Menorah</li>
<li>Hinduism: OM symbol, old temple, new temple, symbol on woman's forehead, young boy brahmachari , huge gathering of Hindus, temple, Hindu ascetic, yoga practioners, dancer, Hindu god Shri Ganesh, cow, symbol, ivory statue of Lord Rama</li>
<li>Zoroastrianism: temple</li>
<li>Buddhism: statue of Buddha; statue of Buddha, engraving of the Buddha's first sermon, Buddhists praying at temple, Buddhist monk, statue of Buddha; statue of Buddha, painting of a monk, young Buddhist monks, Buddhist flag, hallway in Calfornian temple</li>
<li>Christianity: Cross, Ichthys symbol, chart of main branches</li>
<li>Islam: Masjid al-Nabawi mosque in Medina, Kaaba</li>

<p>While we have this time out, it's worth listing the main points of dispute to resolve through ths Discussion page. Contributors should be careful to avoid POV, which really is not difficult, whether one is pro- or anti-Bahá'í. Facts that are undisputed--such as "monotheistic"--should be at the top of the article; points that are disputed by scholarly sources and not our POV--such as syncretic--should be at the bottom of the relative sections with a comment highlighting the dispute. Please add to the list of suggested disputes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Syncretic?</li>
<li>Restrictions on Freedom versus Restrictions on Publication; should covenant-breaking be in this section?</li>
<li>Covenant-breaking: is the Bahá'í administration preventing free discussion by preventing Bahá'í associating with Covenant-breakers?</li>
<li>Images: what would be most appropriate, in all senses of the word?</li>
</ul>
<p>Looking through the article's History, it's amazing how much time has been wasted by contributors trying to force major changes without prior consultation via the Discussion page; enough interested people are watching to quickly make changes...but such a waste of time.

Sure, publishing restrictions, that goes in without a doubt, but I'm at a loss to see what he means by personal restrictions. Can't talk to the excommunicated - tautology and besides its "discouraged" from talking to them (told to shun them, but theres no punishment for communicating).

<p>Concerning the top image of the article, on second thoughts, the nine-pointed star seems most appropriate. Other pictures could include the grave of Shoghi Effendi by the Covenant of Bahá'u'lláh and Division section; Seat of the Universal House of Justice next to Administrative Order section; Indian temple by the Mashriqu'l-Adhkár section (why not rename it the Temples section, as this is the English wikipedia?); the Shrine of Baha'u'llah under Rituals, by text referring to the qiblih; maybe an early LSA in the Administrative Order section; how about one of the Bahá'í co-chair of the Millenium Forum organizing committee for the Involvement in the life of society section, to show the respected role of Bahá'ís among international NGOs?

<p>Re. Syncretic, Cole's following quote supports the view that all the major religions are syncretic to some extent, but it is the social (and political) aspects of each that are innovative. If this is a common feature, then it would be inappropriate to single out the Bahá'í Faith as being syncretic without putting the statement in context, i.e. that other religions are too. <i>"...[Baha'u'llah's] writings throughout advocated a syncretic approach to religion and a liberal progressive one to political and social questions."</i> Juan Cole, History Today, Mar90, Vol. 40 Issue 3, [<a href="http://www.uga.edu/bahai/News/030090.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.uga.edu/bahai/News/030090.html" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>]</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">`Alláh-u-Abhá is not a Ritual Greeting</span></h2>
<p>I have deleted the reference to `Alláh-u-Abhá because it is misleading for the article to state that <i>"Formal and proper method of greeting among Bahá'ís is "`Alláh-u-Abhá", meaning God is Glorious."</i> Persian Bahá'ís often use it as a greeting to other Bahá'ís but many westerners do not. Shoghi Effendi wrote <i>"The Bahá'ís <b>are free to</b> greet each other with Allah-u-Abha when they meet, if they want to, but <b>they should avoid</b> anything which to outsiders, in a western country, might seem like some strange Oriental password."</i> (Directives from the Guardian, p. 3); I have added the emphases in these quotes. In a December 8, 1941 letter written on his behalf: <i>"The term of 'Allah-u-Abha, on the other hand, <b>is a form of</b> Bahá'í greeting...'"</i> (Compilations, Lights of Guidance, p. 266). <i>"The use of "Allah-u-Abha" <b>in the East</b> is, generally speaking, confined to a greeting. It is not said at the end of prayers and the Guardian feels that the less it is used freely in public by the Bahá'ís in the West (before strangers) the better, as it gives a very peculiar impression of us, and makes us seem like some strange Oriental sect."</i> (Shoghi Effendi through his Secretary; Compilations, Principles of Bahai Administration, p. 16). --<a href="../../../o/c/c/User%7EOccamy_964a.html" title="User:Occamy">Occamy</a> 16:56, 7 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Concerning the number of Babis, not only Bahá'í sources state that Babis were few in number; Juan Cole writes: "Later on, in the early twentieth century <i>the few remaining Babis</i> were among the most vociferous proponents of the Constitutional Revolution...." Source: "Millennialism in Modern Iranian History," in Abbas Amanat and Magnus Bernhardsson, eds. Imagining the End: Visions of Apocalypse from the Ancient Middle East to Modern America (London: I.B. Tauris, 2002), pp. 282-311. <a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~jrcole/bahai/2003/millen2.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~jrcole/bahai/2003/millen2.htm" rel="nofollow">[10]</a>. The decendents of Subh-i-Azal living in Famagusta are most unlikely to be secret followers of their ancestor who are hiding through taqqiya; the reason for this unlikelyhood is that the Turkish part of Cyprus is generally secular and poses no threat to them. Therefore any new "Bayanis" are unlikely to be directly connected with descendents of the Famagusta exiles. --<a href="../../../o/c/c/User%7EOccamy_964a.html" title="User:Occamy">Occamy</a> 20:41, 21 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Bahá'í Elections</span></h2>
<p>It is <b>VERY</b> misleading to suggest that any Bahá'í is eligible to elect the NSA and UHJ, since Bahá'í voters are prohibited from informing delegates or NSA members of their choice of candidate and do not have any ballots available from which to choose candidates for the NSA or the UHJ. In addition, only a small fraction (less than 1%) of Bahá'ís are eligible to participate in the elections of the NSA or the UHJ, which are either delegates, in the case of NSA elections, or NSA members, in UHJ elections. Delegates and NSA members are also prohibited from informing Bahá'ís who they voted for in the NSA or UHJ elections, so there is no input from the voter and no accountability from the person doing the electing.</p>
<p>Most astute observers and political science scholars would call this a <b>"sham election"</b>, as it would not even qualify to be called "representative democracy" since there is a no accountability between the elected representative and the voter and no communication of the desire of the voter to the representative. In other words, if the representative is not capable of representing the will of the voters because of communication restrictions that are part of the election structure, how can you call this democracy?</p>
<p>Bahá'í elections are therefore like electing electors to the Electoral College in the U.S., but without a vote by the people for President. The elector thus has no idea who the voters in her district would prefer as President, and the voter has no idea who the elector voted for!</p>
<p>Avoiding disclosure of sufficient detail of Bahá'í elections as you have done in your section on the Administrative Order of the Bahá'í Faith, gives the reader the impression that "any" Bahá'í is eligible to elect the NSA or the UHJ and that the elections are a "democratic" process.

<p><b>Reply to Above</b></p>
<p>You missed the point entirely! The point is not whether individual voters remain anonymous, it is the fact that they have NO VOTE at all! There is NO ballot, and NO NSA or UHJ candidates on any ballot that are used in Bahá'í elections at the "all" Bahá'í stage, and this is NOT made clear in your description of Bahá'í elections. "Wishful thinking" concerning your hope that a delegate or NSA may vote for the best person, let alone the person that would best serve the interests of Bahá'ís, is not the same as VOTING for that person! Your own website defines [2] <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representative_democracy" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representative_democracy" rel="nofollow">[11]</a> "representative democracy" as "a form of democracy and theory of civics wherein voters choose (in free, secret, multi-party elections) representatives to act in <b>their</b> interests. This is not possible under the Bahá'í scheme of elections since the interests of Bahá'ís can not be ascertained by the representative because Bahá'ís are unable to communicate <b>their</b> interests based on the structure of the election! -- 67.188.7.127 00:45, 22 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm sorry, but I must be missing your point as what you've said hasn't cleared it up for me. Obviously since you feel strongly about it we can request the opinion of a neutral party (well we can try to get several opinions). How does the following wording sound:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Bahá'ís use what they call a representative democratic voting system which is split into 3 stages:
<ul>
<li>The Bahá'í masses vote for a regional delegate.</li>
<li>Regional delegates votes for a few National delegates.</li>
<li>The National delegates in turn vote for a worldwide body.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>However, nominations, campaigning and affecting a delegates vote are all strictly prohibited. Although discussion is allowed, delegates are not allowed to disclose their preference to others. As such, a Bahá'í on the lowest tier cannot vote for a delegate on the condition he votes a certain way (which is present in most representive democrasies) as this is against the spirit of the election. No canvasing is allowed as this may disadvantage people. Delegate weighting is not performed (so a country such as China has the same voting power as Spain dispite being 200 times bigger - I'm not certain about smaller countries such as Luxembourg or Monaco).</dd>
<dd>One editor has questioned whether the term <a href="../../../r/e/p/Representative_democracy.html" title="Representative democracy">Representative democracy</a> is misleading since, in effect, the lowest tier can put no direct vote to who gets voted in (assuming they don't get voted to a delegate level). If it is misleading, is the term <a href="../../../d/e/m/Democratic.html" title="Democratic">Democratic</a> also misleading?</dd>

<p><b>Reply to Above</b></p>
<p>The term "democracy" is also misleading because your website defines this as "a form of government under which the <b>power to alter the laws</b> and structures of government <b>lies, ultimately, with the citizenry</b>"<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic" rel="nofollow">[12]</a> According to the authoritative interpretations of Bahá'í law, the ultimate power rest with the UHJ, not the Bahá'í citizenry<a href="http://64.233.161.104/custom?q=cache:Td7bV3AkjtYJ:www.bahai-library.com/published.uhj/century.light/century8.html+%22ultimate+authority%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8" class="external autonumber" title="http://64.233.161.104/custom?q=cache:Td7bV3AkjtYJ:www.bahai-library.com/published.uhj/century.light/century8.html+%22ultimate+authority%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8" rel="nofollow">[13]</a> If the Bahá'í citizenry wanted to alter a law passed by the UHJ, they would be <b>powerless</b> under the Bahá'í election scheme since there would be know way of communicating their dissatisfaction collectively through the election process in order to alter the objectionable law.</p>
<p>I think the most neutral languge which informs the reader of the democratic shortcomings of Bahá'í elections is the term "semi-democratic". The languege below I think best describes this semi-democratic process:</p>
<p><i>Bahá'í elections are semi-democratic. What this means, is at the lowest level of administration, the Local Spiritual Assembly (LSA), "all" Bahá'ís in that particular locality get to vote once a year for their nine-member LSA.</i></p>
<p><i>At the National Spiritual Assembly (NSA) level (the country level), the direct democratic input of Bahá'ís is diminished, in that Bahá'ís are required to vote once a year for "delegates" that in turn vote for the nine-member NSA. The structure of this election is such that no ballot exists for NSA members, only for delegates, so the delegate does not know whom Bahá'ís in her area would prefer as National Spiritual Assembly members. In addition, the Bahá'í voter has know idea whom their delegate voted for because of the secret ballot at the NSA level. It is "hoped" that the delegate voted for the best spiritual person to represent the Bahá'í Faith on the NSA, but the Bahá'í voter has no way of communicating to their delegate who they think is the best spiritual person to represent their interests on the NSA.</i></p>
<p><i>The nine-member Universal House of Justice (UHJ) elections are held every five years, and are based on votes of the NSAs around the world. Like the NSA elections, there is no way Bahá'ís can communicate collectively who they believe are the best spiritual people to serve their interests on the UHJ or ascertain who their NSA voted for, as this is also a secret ballot.''</i> -- 67.188.7.127 01:48, 22 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>That's just not NPOV</b>. It's just not. It implies that there is an intrinsic value to mass elections and campaigning which is certainly NOT established. Let's try a different take on the same facts.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>The selection of the members of Bahá'í administrative bodies involve elections. These elections are organized in a unique manner in four levels of administration.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>At the local (town, city, county) level of administration, the Local Spiritual Assembly (LSA) is directly elected annually by a vote of the adult Bahá'ís in that particular locality. This vote occurs without nominations, and the ballot lists all adult members of the community. Election is by plurality.</li>
<li>In the United States and India, regional councils are elected by members of these Local Spiritual Assemblies in an election conducted by mail. Again, no nominations occur, each LSA member is direted to submit the names of the indivuals in the region they feel are best suited to serve.</li>
<li>The selection of the National Spiritual Assembly (NSA) is also indirect using a different methedology. The nation is divided into voting districts. In each district the members are charged to elect a delegate who will represent them at the annual national convention, and who will vote for the members of the NSA. The charge to the members at the local level then, is to select the individual whom they belive will do the best job of representing them at the national convention, and who will do the best job of voting for the NSA memebers. No input is provided to the delegate on whom to vote for in the NSA election. The NSA election at the national convention does not involve nomination or candidates. Some critics of Bahá'í elections have charged that this results in an effective nomination of the incumbants who are inherently the most well known individuals, and therefore likely to be re-elected. Others have charged that his indirect election reduces the direct democratic input of Bahá'ís is diminished, in that the delegate does not know whom Bahá'ís in her area would prefer as National Spiritual Assembly members. In addition, the Bahá'í voter has know idea whom their delegate voted for because of the secret ballot at the NSA level.</li>
<li>The nine-member Universal House of Justice (UHJ) elections are held every five years, and are based on votes of the members of the NSAs around the world. Like the NSA elections, there is no nomination or campaign process. NSA members are free to vote for any individual they would like. The members of the NSAs are charged to vote for the best individuals to serve on the House of Justice. Critics of Bahá'í elections again charge that this results in the effective nomination of the incumbants, and the appointed staff of the various international agencies operated by the House of Justice. <a href="../../../r/b/o/User%7ERboatright_c3e8.html" title="User:Rboatright">Rick Boatright</a> 15:11, 22 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Hi, thanks for asking me to have a look at this. I must agree, ¨representative democracy¨ it does not seem to be. But ¨sham election¨ or ¨semi-democratic¨ does not apply either. A similar system would be called in German Räterepublik - probably best translated as Councilar-republican system or indeed Soviet system (if there wasn´t the stalinism/leninism association...) It is/has been a valid form of republican government, but due to its obvious ease of abuse nowadays not a very popular one on state level. Many reformed churches are goverened in a similar way though - a local congregation elects its own elders who form the session, one is elected to go to the regional presbyterium, where again some will get selected to attend at national synods/assemblies. Works pretty well if you want a stable system with slow speed of changes and when the majority of the participants are sane and sensible people.... In summary my suggestion is to describe the system but leave all and any (potentially emotive) terms wrt democracy etc out. Hope that helps. Sorry I am not much here in these days. <a href="../../../r/e/f/User%7ERefdoc_5ef2.html" title="User:Refdoc">Refdoc</a> 23:13, 22 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Are there actually any examples of the use of "BC/AD" in this, or any other Bahá'í article though? Since Bahá'í history starts in CE 1844 (or possibly slightly earlier if you take the Shaykhi movement as being a precursor to the Babis) I rather doubt it - I skimmed the article here and couldn't find any references to "BC/AD". Bahá'í books tend to use the Common Era abbreviation too, though.</dd>

<dd>Wikipedia being what it is, however, I don't think much of anyone's chances of getting this to be uniform policy - someone is always going to change things to make a point.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Syncretism revisited</span></h2>
<p><i>Because of its inclusiveness in recognizing all the above as messengers of God, the Bahá'í Faith is commonly assumed in religious studies textbooks to be syncretic, although this is disputed by other scholars and by the Bahá'ís themselves who feel that the issue is one of perspective and therefore neither significant nor relevant.</i></p>
<p>I'm troubled by this sentence at the end of the intro. I don't think it's true to say that the Bahá'ís believe that the issue of syncretism is "neither significant nor relevant", as shown by the passion evidenced by Bahá'ís in the discussions here. I think that Bahá'ís don't like the implication in the word "syncretic" that their faith is a man-made philosophy - but I can't think of a three-word phrase that explains that, and I think a digression on what Bahá'ís think about their religion being called "syncretic" is out of place here. I'm going to cut the untrue "therefore", because I think that the Bahá'ís feel it's a matter of perspective is fair enough - but if anyone can come up with a pithy summary of why Bahá'ís don't like being called "syncretic" I'd be pleased to see it! <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaulHammond_ae3e.html" title="User:PaulHammond">PaulHammond</a> 11:46, May 17, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've been doing a kind of copy edit on the article today - and I came across the point where the article talks about Abdu'l Baha's death, then jumps straight into talking about schisms, covenant-breakers and Guardians before mentioning Shoghi Effendi. I think it read better this way - it goes from Abdu'l baha's death to ABs Will, the appointment of Shoghi Effendi, then him dying without leaving a will, and then all the sections about Bahá'í controversies come in.

<p>It is appropriate to reintroduce <b>vast</b> to the following passage in the Covenant section: <i>"A few Bahá'ís accepted his claim and became known as Remeyites, whilst the <b>vast</b> majority looked towards the creation of the Universal House of Justice..."</i> The emphatic rejection of Mason Remey's claim is described in two letters from the Hands of the Cause in the Holy Land to all the Hands of the Cause (sourced from "Ministry of the Custodians" <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0-85398-350-X</a> [<a href="http://bahai-library.com/?file=uhj_ministry_custodians.html&amp;chapter=4" class="external autonumber" title="http://bahai-library.com/?file=uhj_ministry_custodians.html&amp;chapter=4" rel="nofollow">[14]</a>]), extracts from which are:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>"In spite of this world-wide demonstration of solidarity and steadfastness in the Covenant, a group of five members of the French National Assembly accepted Mr. Remey as the Guardian of the Faith, and the National Assembly informed the believers of France of the advent of a new Guardian."</i> 28 May 1960 (p. 204)</li>

I've just read on the article on <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joel_Bray_Marangella_1e75.html" title="Joel Bray Marangella">Joel Bray Marangella</a> (one of Remey's stronger followers and chair of the French NSA) that it was only three. -- <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomhab_fa0f.html" title="User:Tomhab">Tomhab</a> 00:02, 3 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Do we have documentation that isn't from the Hands or the House on the numbers that initially accepted Remey? If so, it would be nice to annotate "vast" to such documentation, since it's reporting and not opinion. In justification of "vast", it would be probably reasonable to note that while a quorum of the french NSA accepted Mr. Remey, no other NSA did so. Even by count of NSAs, which are probably the best numbers to mention from the POV of the Orthodox Bahá'ís it's vast. Other than that, I think that some inclusion of these quotes, here or on another page would be appropriate. --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristianEdwardGruber_f5cf.html" title="User:ChristianEdwardGruber">Christian Edward Gruber</a>

<dd>I don't know of other sources. I believe that the publication "Ministry of the Custodians" can be safely regarded as authoritative, though this is my POV: the correspondence between the Hands concerning Remey's action does not read like sanitised history.
