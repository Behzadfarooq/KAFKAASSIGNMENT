<h2><span class="mw-headline">Punishments for Arson and other crimes.</span></h2>
<p>Well, the listed punishment for arson was certainly partially correct... the below from "Lights of Guidance"</p>
<dl>
<dd>1198. Penalty for Arson -- Laws for a More Evolved Society</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>"As regards the question you raised about the penalty for arson in the Aqdas, the penalty for arson is burning or life imprisonment; in other word the same penalty as for first degree murder.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>"We must not question this, but studying the Bahá'í Faith and its Teachings in their entirety, realize that the Law of God for this Day is a healing for the nations, and that, at a future period when a purely Bahá'í society exists and these laws can be enforced, humanity may have reached a much higher point to evolution than at present, and the mere threat of them may be sufficient in most cases to protect the Community and protect the law from being broken."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>(From a letter written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer, February 15, 1957)

<p>as to branding homosexuals, that is simply false, period... There is NO MENTION of branding as a punishment in Baha'i literature except to DISCLAIM it, not to impose it. The following from "Messages of the Universal House of Justice 1963 - 1986" explains:</p>
<dl>
<dd>251.4d 3. The punishments prescribed for theft, murder and arson are given only in barest outline. It is explained in Note 42 on page 64 of the Synopsis and Codification that these punishments are intended for a future condition of 450 society and will have to be supplemented and applied by the Universal House of Justice. The punishment for theft, for example, says that for the third offence a mark must be placed on the thief's forehead (nothing is said about branding), so that people will be warned of his proclivities. All details of how the mark is to be applied, how long it must be worn, on what conditions it may be removed, as well as the seriousness of various degrees of theft have been left by Bahá'u'lláh for the Universal House of Justice to decide when the law has to be applied. Similarly, merely the fundamental principles of the punishments for murder and arson are given in the Kitáb-i- Aqdas. Wilful murder is to be punished either by capital punishment or life imprisonment. Such matters as degrees of offence and whether any extenuating circumstances are to be taken into account, and which of the two prescribed punishments is to be the norm are left to the Universal House of Justice to decide in light of prevailing conditions when the law is in operation. Arson, as you yourself can see from the newspapers, is becoming an increasingly frequent offence -- scarcely a day passes without some building being burned or blown up, often causing agonizing death to innocent people. Bahá'u'lláh prescribes that a person who burns a house intentionally is to be burned or imprisoned for life, but again, the application of these punishments, the method of carrying them out and the fixing of degrees of offence are left to the Universal House of Justice. Obviously there is a tremendous difference in the degree of the offence of a person who burns down an empty warehouse from that of one who sets fire to a school full of children.
<dl>
<dd>(The Universal House of Justice, Messages 1963 to 1986, p. 449)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>As to your other edit, Cyrpus, Baha'is ARE obliged to support the faith with Material Offerings....</p>
<dl>
<dd>"And as the progress and extension of spiritual activities is dependent and conditioned upon material means, it is of absolute necessity that immediately after the establishment of Local as well as National Spiritual Assemblies, a Bahá'í Fund be established, to be placed under the exclusive control of the Spiritual Assembly. All donations and contributions should be offered to the Treasurer of the Assembly, for the express purpose of promoting the interests of the Cause, throughout the locality or country. It is the sacred obligation of every conscientious and faithful servant of Bahá'u'lláh who desires to see His Cause advance, to contribute freely and generously for the increase of that Fund..."
<dl>
<dd>(Shoghi Effendi, Directives from the Guardian, p. 32)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>But, that means giving money to the fund not burning sacrifices on the alter. Also, let us not forget the Huquq.....</p>
<dl>
<dd>18. The minimum amount subject to Huququ'lláh is reached when ones possessions are worth the number of Vahid (19); that is, whenever one owneth 19 mithqals of gold, or acquireth possessions attaining this value, after having deducted therefrom the yearly expenses, the Huquq becometh applicable and its payment is obligatory.

<dd>im interested in knowing where 148.188.128.36 "learned" such things, as they are partial correct, but twisted , maybe he made it up, or who told him did.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>1. as for the penalty for arson, is true but doesnt tell the "whole story"(as we can check in Shoghi Effendi letter above) probably on purpose to make a negative impression.</dd>
<dd>2. as for branding of homosexuals, this is clearly false, i think that this was twisted from the punishments prescribed for theft..</dd>
<dd>3. as for the Material Offerings thing, i think this was taken (twisted) from the Babi faith since "to offer priceless gifts to its founder" was a Babi Law (i think), but its not a Bahai law (the Aqdas abolishes it). anyway, it says "to contribute FREELY and generously for the increase of that Fund...", this contribution is a duty, but not a real obligation, Rboatright, if you are a bahai, you know that NO ONE will ever come to you saying "if you dont offer something you are not a bahai anymore", in fact this kind of thing (pressure) is forbiden, pratices of plates going around asking (pressuring) for funds as we can see in some churches are also forbiden.</dd>
<dd>Huququ'llah came to appliance by the Universal House of Justice some time ago, but for now, its still up to each Bahai to pay it or not, no one imposses anything...</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>anyway, 1. and 2.(on theft) are Bahai "State" Law, and not "Spiritual" Laws and ordinances, so they shouldnt be there anyway. if someone wants to create a article about Bahai "State" Law, good luck (it will require a lot of work)&#160;:) - --<a href="../../../c/y/p/User%7ECyprus2k1_5698.html" title="User:Cyprus2k1">Cyprus2k1</a> 19:28, 15 Jul 2004 (UTC)</dd>
