<p><i><a href="../../../k/a/r/Karna.html" title="Karna">Karna</a> and <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shalya.html" title="Shalya">Shalya</a> were two generals in the <a href="../../../k/a/u/Kaurava.html" title="Kaurava">Kaurava</a> army during the <a href="../../../k/u/r/Kurukshetra_War_9568.html" title="Kurukshetra War">Kurukshetra War</a>. They engaged in a verbal dispute, owing to their deslike of each other. Both of them hailed from a different culture.

<p>Karna said, Listen with devoted attention to this, O ruler of the Madras (Shalya), that was heard by me while it was recited in the presence of <a href="../../../d/h/r/Dhritarashtra.html" title="Dhritarashtra">Dhritarashtra</a>. In Dhritarashtra’s court, the <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brahmana.html" title="Brahmana">Brahmanas</a> used to narrate the accounts of diverse delightful regions and many kings of ancient times. An old Brahmana while reciting old histories, said these words, blaming the <a href="../../../b/a/h/Bahlika_Kingdom_c264.html" title="Bahlika Kingdom">Vahikas</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/d/Madra_Kingdom_a924.html" title="Madra Kingdom">Madrakas</a>, ‘One should always avoid the Vahikas, those impure people that are out of the pale of virtue, and that live away from the <a href="../../../h/i/m/Himalayas.html" title="Himalayas">Himavat</a> and the <a href="../../../g/a/n/Ganges_River_7af6.html" title="Ganges River">Ganga</a> and <a href="../../../s/a/r/Sarasvati_River_f1a7.html" title="Sarasvati River">Saraswati</a> and <a href="../../../y/a/m/Yamuna.html" title="Yamuna">Yamuna</a> and <a href="../../../k/u/r/Kurukshetra.html" title="Kurukshetra">Kurukshetra</a> and the <a href="../../../s/i/n/Sindhu.html" title="Sindhu">Sindhu</a> and its five tributary rivers.

<p>I remember from the days of my youth that a slaughter-ground for kine and a space for storing intoxicating spirits always distinguish the entrances of the abodes of the Vahika kings. On some very secret mission I had to live among the Vahikas. In consequence of such residence the conduct of these people is well known to me. There is a town of the name of <b><a href="../../../s/a/k/Sakala.html" title="Sakala">Sakala</a></b> (modern day <a href="../../../s/i/a/Sialkote.html" title="Sialkote">Sialkote</a>), a river of the name of <a href="../../../a/p/a/Apaga.html" title="Apaga">Apaga</a>, and a clan of the Vahikas known by the name of the <b>Jarttikas</b>. The practices of these people are very censurable. They drink the <b>liquor called Gauda</b>, and eat <b>fried barley</b> with it. They also eat <b>beef with garlic</b>. They also eat <b>cakes of flour mixed with meat</b>, and <b>boiled rice</b> that is bought from others. Of righteous practices they have none. (8,44)</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/h/Bahlika_Culture_9830.html" title="Edit section: The society of Sakala">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The society of Sakala</span></h3>
<p>Their women, intoxicated with drink and divested of robes, laugh and dance outside the walls of the houses in cities, without garlands and unguents, singing while drunk obscene songs of diverse kinds that are as musical as the bray of the ass or the bleat of the camel. In intercourse they are absolutely without any restraint, and in all other matters they act as they like. Maddened with drink, they call upon one another, using many endearing epithets. Addressing many drunken exclamations to their husbands and lords, the fallen women among the Vahikas, without observing restrictions even on sacred days, give themselves up to dancing. One of those wicked Vahikas,--one that is, that lived amongst those arrogant women,--who happened to live for some days in <a href="../../../k/u/r/Kuru_Kingdom_67eb.html" title="Kuru Kingdom">Kurujangala</a>, burst out with cheerless heart, saying, Alas, that (Vahika) maiden of large proportions, dressed in thin blankets, is thinking of me,--her Vahika lover—that is now passing his days in Kurujangala, at the hour of her going to bed. Crossing the <a href="../../../s/u/t/Sutlej.html" title="Sutlej">Sutlej</a> and the delightful <b>Iravati</b>, and arriving at my own country, when shall I cast my eyes upon those beautiful women with thick frontal bones, with blazing circlets of red arsenic on their foreheads, with streaks of jet black collyrium on their eyes, and their beautiful forms attired in blankets and skins and themselves uttering shrill cries! When shall I be happy, in the company of those intoxicated ladies amid the music of drums and kettle-drums and conchs sweet as the cries of asses and camels and mules! When shall I be amongst those ladies <b>eating cakes of flour and meat and balls of pounded barley mixed with skimmed milk</b>, in the forests, having many pleasant paths of Sami and Pilu and Karira! When shall I, amid my own countrymen, mustering in strength on the high-roads, fall upon passengers, and snatching their robes and attires beat them repeatedly! What man is there that would willingly dwell, even for a moment amongst the Vahikas that are so fallen and wicked, and so depraved in their practises?’ Even thus did that brahmana describe the Vahikas of base behaviour, a sixth of whose merits and demerits is thine, O Shalya. (8,44)</p>
<p>Having said this, that pious Brahmana began once more to say what I am about to repeat respecting the Vahikas. Listen to what I say, In the <b>large and populous town of Sakala</b>, a Rakshasa woman used to sing on every fourteenth day of the dark fortnight, in accompaniment with a drum, When shall I next sing the songs of the Vahikas in this Sakala town, having gorged myself with beef and drunk the Gauda liquor? When shall I again, decked in ornaments, and with those maidens and ladies of large proportions, gorge upon a large number of sheep and large quantities of <b>pork</b> and <b>beef</b> and the <b>meat of fowls and asses and camels</b>? They who do not <b>eat sheep</b> live in vain! Even thus, O Shalya, the young and old, among the inhabitants of Sakala, intoxicated with spirits, sing and cry. How can virtue be met with among such a people? Thou shouldst know this. (8,44)</p>

<p>I must, however, speak again to thee about what another Brahmana had said unto us in the Kuru court, ‘There where forests of Pilus stand, and those five rivers flow, viz., the <a href="../../../s/a/t/Satadru.html" title="Satadru">Satadru</a>, the <a href="../../../v/i/p/Vipasa.html" title="Vipasa">Vipasa</a>, the <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iravati_River_15f8.html" title="Iravati River">Iravati</a>, the <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chandrabhaga.html" title="Chandrabhaga">Chandrabhaga</a>, and the <a href="../../../v/i/t/Vitasta.html" title="Vitasta">Vitasta</a> and which have the <a href="../../../s/i/n/Sindhu.html" title="Sindhu">Sindhu</a> for their sixth, there in those regions removed from the <a href="../../../h/i/m/Himavat.html" title="Himavat">Himavat</a>, are the countries called by the name of the <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arattas.html" title="Arattas">Arattas</a>. Those regions are without virtue and religion. No one should go thither. The gods, the pitris, and the brahmanas, never accept gifts from those that are fallen, or those that are begotten by Shudras on the girls of other castes, or the Vahikas who never perform sacrifices and are exceedingly irreligious.’ That learned Brahmana had also said in the Kuru court, ‘The Vahikas, without any feelings of revulsion, eat of wooden vessels having deep stomachs and earthen plates and vessels that have been licked by dogs and that are stained with pounded barley and other corn. The Vahikas drink the milk of sheep and camels and asses and eat curds and other preparations from those different kinds of milk. Those degraded people number many bastards among them. There is no food and no milk that they do not take. The <b>Aratta-Vahikas</b> that are steeped in ignorance, should be avoided.’ Thou shouldst know this, O Shalya. I must, however, again speak to thee about what another Brahmana had said unto me in the Kuru court, ‘How can one go to heaven, having drunk milk in the town called <b>Yugandhara</b>, and resided in the place called <b>Acyutasthala</b>, and bathed in the spot called <b>Bhutilaya</b>? There where the five rivers flow just after issuing from the mountains, there among the <a href="../../../a/r/a/Aratta.html" title="Aratta">Aratta</a>-Vahikas, no respectable person should dwell even for two days. There are two Pishacas named Vahi and Hika in the river <b>Vipasa</b>. The Vahikas are the offspring of those two <a href="../../../p/i/s/Pisacha_Kingdom_fe67.html" title="Pisacha Kingdom">Pisachas</a>. They are not creatures created by the Creator. Being of such low origin, how can they be conversant with the duties ordained in the scriptures? (8,44)</p>

<p>The Karashakas, the <a href="../../../m/a/h/Mahisha_Kingdom_28ac.html" title="Mahisha Kingdom">Mahishakas</a>, the <a href="../../../k/a/l/Kalinga_Kingdom_fc73.html" title="Kalinga Kingdom">Kalingas</a>, the <a href="../../../k/e/r/Kerala_Kingdom_30bf.html" title="Kerala Kingdom">Keralas</a>, the Karkotakas, the Virakas, and other peoples of no religion, one should always avoid.’ Even thus did a Rakshasa woman of gigantic hips speak unto a brahmana who on a certain occasion went to that country for bathing in a sacred water and passed a single night there. The regions are called by the name of <a href="../../../a/r/a/Aratta.html" title="Aratta">Arattas</a>. The people residing there are called the Vahikas. The lowest of brahmanas also are residing there from very remote times. They are without the Veda and without knowledge, without sacrifice and without the power to assist at other’s sacrifices. They are all fallen and many amongst them have been begotten by Shudras upon other peoples’ girls. The gods never accept any gifts from them. The Prasthalas, the <a href="../../../m/a/d/Madra_Kingdom_a924.html" title="Madra Kingdom">Madras</a>, the <a href="../../../g/a/n/Gandhara_Kingdom_f14f.html" title="Gandhara Kingdom">Gandharas</a>, the <a href="../../../a/r/a/Aratta.html" title="Aratta">Arattas</a>, those called <a href="../../../k/h/a/Khasa_Kingdom_5039.html" title="Khasa Kingdom">Khasas</a>, the Vasatis, the <a href="../../../s/i/n/Sindhu_Kingdom_c035.html" title="Sindhu Kingdom">Sindhus</a> and the <a href="../../../s/a/u/Sauvira_Kingdom_fe6c.html" title="Sauvira Kingdom">Sauviras</a> are almost as blamable in their practices.’” (8,44)</p>

<p>Karna continued, I shall again speak unto thee. Once on a time a brahmana came to our house as a guest. Observing our practices he became highly gratified and said unto us, ‘I dwelt for a long time on a peak of the Himavat quite alone. Since then I have seen diverse countries following diverse religions. Never, however, have I seen all the people of a country act unrighteously. All the races I have met will admit that to be true religion which has been declared by persons conversant with the Vedas. Travelling through various countries following various religions, I at last, O king, came among the Vahikas. There I heard that one at first becomes a <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brahmana.html" title="Brahmana">Brahmana</a> and then he becomes a <a href="../../../k/s/h/Kshatriya.html" title="Kshatriya">Kshatriya</a>. Indeed, a Vahika would, after that, become a <a href="../../../v/a/i/Vaishya.html" title="Vaishya">Vaishya</a>, and then a <a href="../../../s/h/u/Shudra.html" title="Shudra">Shudra</a>, and then a barber. Having become a barber, he would then again become a brahmana. Returning to the status of a brahmana, he would again become a slave. One person in a family becomes a brahmana: all the others, falling off from virtue, act as they like. (8,45)</p>

Having travelled through the whole world I heard of these practices, destructive of virtue, of these sinful irregularities amongst the Vahikas.’ Thou shouldst know all this, O Shalya. In former days a chaste woman was abducted by robbers (hailing) from <a href="../../../a/r/a/Aratta.html" title="Aratta">Aratta</a>. She cursed them. It is for this, O Shalya, that the sister's sons of the <a href="../../../a/r/a/Aratta.html" title="Aratta">Arattas</a>, and not their own sons, become their heirs. (8,45)</p>

This cannot be said of the Madrakas and the crooked-hearted race that resides in the country of the five rivers. In days of yore, when the eternal religion was reverenced in all countries, the Grandsire, observing the practices of the country of the five rivers, cried fie on them.

When all people were observant of the duties of their respective orders, the Grandsire had to find fault with these men. Thou shouldst know all this, O Shalya. (8,45)</p>

<p>The <a href="../../../p/a/n/Panchala_Kingdom_b164.html" title="Panchala Kingdom">Pancalas</a> observe the duties enjoined in the <a href="../../../v/e/d/Vedas.html" title="Vedas">Vedas</a>; the <a href="../../../k/u/r/Kuru_Kingdom_67eb.html" title="Kuru Kingdom">Kauravas</a> observe truth; the <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matsya_Kingdom_384c.html" title="Matsya Kingdom">Matsyas</a> and the <a href="../../../s/u/r/Surasena_Kingdom_e577.html" title="Surasena Kingdom">Surasenas</a> perform sacrifices, the Easterners follow the practices of the Shudras; the Southerners are fallen; the Vahikas are thieves; the <a href="../../../s/a/u/Saurashtra_Kingdom_14d2.html" title="Saurashtra Kingdom">Saurashtras</a> are bastards. Fie on the <a href="../../../a/r/a/Aratta.html" title="Aratta">Arattas</a> and the people of the country of the five rivers! Commencing with the Pancalas, the Kauravas, the Naimishas, the Matsyas,--all these,--know what religion is. The old men among the Northerners, the Angas, the Magadhas, (without themselves knowing what virtue is) follow the practices of the pious. Many gods, headed by <a href="../../../a/g/n/Agni.html" title="Agni">Agni</a>, dwell in the East. The pitris dwell in the South that is presided over by <a href="../../../y/a/m/Yama.html" title="Yama">Yama</a> of righteous deeds. The West is protected by the mighty <a href="../../../v/a/r/Varuna.html" title="Varuna">Varuna</a> who overlooks the other gods there. The north is protected by the divine Soma along with the Brahmanas. So <a href="../../../r/a/k/Rakshasa_Kingdom_2535.html" title="Rakshasa Kingdom">Rakshasas</a> and <a href="../../../p/i/s/Pisacha_Kingdom_fe67.html" title="Pisacha Kingdom">Pishacas</a> protect the <a href="../../../h/i/m/Himalaya.html" title="Himalaya">Himavat</a>, the best of mountains. The Guhyakas (<a href="../../../y/a/k/Yaksha_Kingdom_346d.html" title="Yaksha Kingdom">Yakshas</a>, O great king, protect the mountains of Gandhamadana. (Vahikas have no especial protectors).

<p>The <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magadha_Kingdom_97e1.html" title="Magadha Kingdom">Magadhas</a> are comprehenders of <b>signs</b>; the <a href="../../../k/o/s/Kosala_Kingdom_332e.html" title="Kosala Kingdom">Koshalas</a> comprehend from what they see; the <a href="../../../k/u/r/Kuru_Kingdom_67eb.html" title="Kuru Kingdom">Kurus</a> and the <a href="../../../p/a/n/Panchala_Kingdom_b164.html" title="Panchala Kingdom">Pancalas</a> comprehend from a half-uttered speech; the <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salwa_Kingdom_ffe1.html" title="Salwa Kingdom">Salwas</a> cannot comprehend till the whole speech is uttered. The <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parvata_Kingdom_0e14.html" title="Parvata Kingdom">Mountaineers</a>, like the <a href="../../../s/i/v/Sivi_Kingdom_fd2c.html" title="Sivi Kingdom">Sivis</a>, are very stupid. The <a href="../../../y/a/v/Yavana_Kingdom_d21b.html" title="Yavana Kingdom">Yavanas</a>, O king, are <b>omniscient</b>; the Suras are particularly so. The <a href="../../../m/l/e/Mlecchas.html" title="Mlecchas">Mlecchas</a> are wedded to the creations of their own <b>fancy</b>, that other peoples cannot understand. The <a href="../../../b/a/h/Bahlika_Kingdom_c264.html" title="Bahlika Kingdom">Vahikas</a> resent beneficial counsels; as regards the <a href="../../../m/a/d/Madra_Kingdom_a924.html" title="Madra Kingdom">Madrakas</a> there are none amongst those (mentioned above.) (8,45)</p>
<p><i>The following lines seems to be pure propaganda of <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karna.html" title="Karna">Karna</a> against <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shalya.html" title="Shalya">Shalya</a></i></p>
<p>Thou, O Shalya, art so. Thou shouldst not reply to me. The <a href="../../../m/a/d/Madra_Kingdom_a924.html" title="Madra Kingdom">Madrakas</a> are regarded on Earth as the dirt of every nation. So the Madra woman is called the dirt of the whole female sex. They that have for their practices the drinking of spirits, the destruction of the embryo by procuring miscarriage, and the robbing of other people’s wealth, there is no sin that they have not. Fie on the Arattas and the people of the country of the five rivers. (8,45)</p>
<p>I shall, however, again speak to thee. A Rakshasa of the name of Kalmashapada, while plunging in a tank, said, Eleemosynation is a kshatriya’s dirt, while the non-observance of vows is a brahmana’s dirt. The Vahikas are the dirt of the Earth, and the Madra women are the dirt of the whole female sex. The mlecchas are the dirt of mankind: the oilmen are the dirt of the Mlecchas; eunuchs are the dirt of oilmen; they who avail of the priestly ministrations of Kshatriyas, in their sacrifices, are the dirt of eunuchs. The sin of those again that have the last-named persons for their priests, of also of the Madrakas, shall be thine. (8,45)</p>
