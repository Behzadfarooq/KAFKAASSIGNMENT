<p>The <b>Bahá'í administration</b> refers to the administrative system of the <a href="../../../b/a/h/Bah%C3%A1%27%C3%AD_Faith_7cf9.html" title="Bahá'í Faith">Bahá'í Faith</a>.</p>
<p>It is split into two parts, the <a href="../../../b/a/h/Bah%C3%A1%27%C3%AD_administration.html#Elected" title="Bahá'í administration">elected</a> and the <a href="../../../b/a/h/Bah%C3%A1%27%C3%AD_administration.html#Appointed" title="Bahá'í administration">appointed</a>. The supreme governing institution of the Bahá'í Faith is the <a href="../../../u/n/i/Universal_House_of_Justice_dedd.html" title="Universal House of Justice">Universal House of Justice</a>, situated in <a href="../../../h/a/i/Haifa.html" title="Haifa">Haifa</a>, <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israel.html" title="Israel">Israel</a>.</p>
<p>Some features that set apart the Bahá'í administration from similar systems of human government are the the principle according to which elected representatives should follow the dictates of their conscience, rather than being responsible to the views of electors; the absence of any form of campaigning, nominations or parties in democratic Bahá'í elections; and the authority passed down from its founder to the <a href="../../../u/n/i/Universal_House_of_Justice_dedd.html" title="Universal House of Justice">Universal House of Justice</a>.</p>
<p>The Bahá'í administration has four <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charter.html" title="Charter">charter</a> documents <a href="http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/se/GPB/gpb-13.html#pg213" class="external autonumber" title="http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/se/GPB/gpb-13.html#pg213" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> <a href="http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/se/MBW/mbw-45.html#pg84" class="external autonumber" title="http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/se/MBW/mbw-45.html#pg84" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>:</p>

<p><a href="../../../s/h/o/Shoghi_Effendi_4011.html" title="Shoghi Effendi">Shoghi Effendi</a> wrote that the Bahá'í Administrative Order incorporates within its structure certain elements which are to be found in each of the three recognized forms of secular government: <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autocracy.html" title="Autocracy">autocracy</a>, <a href="../../../a/r/i/Aristocracy.html" title="Aristocracy">aristocracy</a> and <a href="../../../d/e/m/Democracy.html" title="Democracy">democracy</a>. His objective in effectively designing the Bahá'í Administrative Order was to embody, reconcile and assimilate within it "such wholesome elements as are to be found in each one of them..." while excluding the "admitted evils inherent in each of these systems..." such that it "cannot ever degenerate into any form of despotism, of oligarchy, or of demagogy which must sooner or later corrupt the machinery of all man-made and essentially defective political institutions." <a href="http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/se/WOB/wob-40.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/se/WOB/wob-40.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a></p>
<p><a href="../../../b/a/h/Bah%C3%A1%27u%27ll%C3%A1h.html" title="Bahá'u'lláh">Bahá'u'lláh</a> commended the British system of government that enhanced kingship though consultation with the people:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"The system of government which the British people have adopted in <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a> appeareth to be good, for it is adorned with the light of both kingship and of the consultation of the people."
<dl>
<dd>(Bahá'u'lláh, <i>Tablets of Bahá'u'lláh</i>, p. 93.) <a href="http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/TB/tb-8.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/TB/tb-8.html" rel="nofollow">[4]</a></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>But Bahá'u'lláh was not specifically endorsing parliamentary democracy, viz:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"Although a republican form of government profiteth all the peoples of the world, yet the majesty of kingship is one of the signs of God. We do not wish that the countries of the world should remain deprived thereof. If the sagacious combine the two forms into one, great will be their reward in the presence of God."
<dl>
<dd>(Bahá'u'lláh, <i>Tablets of Bahá'u'lláh</i>, p. 28.) <a href="http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/TB/tb-4.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/TB/tb-4.html" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>These statements praise the principles of kingship and consultation with the people as principles for civil government. The Bahá'í Administrative Order concerns the system of administration within the Bahá'í Faith rather than civil government. This difference is highlighted in a letter written on behalf of <a href="../../../s/h/o/Shoghi_Effendi_4011.html" title="Shoghi Effendi">Shoghi Effendi</a> concerning the future world government foretold by Bahá'u'lláh and outlined by Shoghi Effendi:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"As regards the International Executive referred to by the Guardian in his "Goal of a New World Order", it should be noted that this statement refers by no means to the Bahá'í Commonwealth of the future, but simply to that world government which will herald the advent and lead to the final establishment of the World Order of Bahá'u'lláh. The formation of this International Executive, which corresponds to the executive head or board in present-day national governments, is but a step leading to the Bahá'í world government of the future, and hence should not be identified with either the institution of the Guardianship or that of the International House of Justice."
<dl>
<dd>(Letter written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi, 1934) <a href="http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/c/CP/cp-59.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/c/CP/cp-59.html" rel="nofollow">[6]</a></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>In keeping with the Bahá'í principle of obedience to government, Bahá'í Administration is seen as subordinate to civil government.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Let them proclaim that in whatever country they reside, and however advanced their institutions, or profound their desire to enforce the laws, and apply the principles, enunciated by Bahá’u’lláh, they will, unhesitatingly, subordinate the operation of such laws and the application of such principles to the requirements and legal enactments of their respective governments. Theirs is not the purpose, while endeavoring to conduct and perfect the administrative affairs of their Faith, to violate, under any circumstances, the provisions of their country’s constitution, much less to allow the machinery of their administration to supersede the government of their respective countries.

<p>Having no ordained, professional priesthood, Bahá'ís operate through a type of non-partisan democratic self-government. The traditional functions of community leadership and moral leadership are not vested in individuals, but in an institutional framework with two main branches.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/h/Bah%C3%A1%27%C3%AD_administration.html" title="Edit section: Elected Institutions">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Elected Institutions</span></h2>
<p>Sometimes referred to by Bahá'u'lláh as "<b>the Rulers</b>", Bahá'ís elect members to councils which are vested with the authority of the community. The members of these councils, themselves, have no individual authority. When duly constituted, however, and specifically when deciding matters as a body, they act as the head of the community. Bahá'u'lláh envisioned a Supreme House of Justice, with local Houses of Justice in every community where nine or more adult Bahá'ís reside. `Abdu'l-Bahá unveiled the "Secondary", or National House of Justice in his will. Seen as embryonic institutions, national and local Houses of Justice are currently given the temporary appelation of "Spiritual Assemblies" and are expected, over time, to mature into fully mature Houses of Justice.</p>
<p>The Universal House of Justice is seen as morally <a href="../../../i/n/f/Infallibility.html" title="Infallibility">infallible</a>, though this belief has subtleties, in that the Universal House of Justice can both make new Bahá'í law and repeal its own laws (it may never alter the laws <a href="../../../b/a/h/Bah%C3%A1%27u%27ll%C3%A1h.html" title="Bahá'u'lláh">Bahá'u'lláh</a> and <a href="../../../%60/a/b/%60Abdu%27l-Bah%C3%A1_f3c9.html" title="`Abdu'l-Bahá">`Abdu'l-Bahá</a> gave in the <a href="../../../b/a/h/Bah%C3%A1%27%C3%AD_literature.html" title="Bahá'í literature">Bahá'í scriptures</a>). This self-correcting, or self-adjusting feature is seen by some as indicating that the process is infallible, not the specific institution or any specific decision. National and Local Spiritual Assemblies are seen as requiring deference and obedience, but can be overruled by a superior elected institution. All decisions by these bodies must be made, and are considered valid if, and only if the body is duly constituted, and meeting as a body with a <a href="../../../q/u/o/Quorum.html" title="Quorum">quorum</a> of members present. And these decisions are made through a specific process of consultation. Because these institutions are considered sacred, both the electoral and consultative decision-making process are given great respect and reverence.</p>

<p>Regional Bahá'í Councils (RBC) have also been established in several larger national Bahá'í communities.

<p>Bahá'u'lláh makes reference to "<b>the learned</b>" among his people. These are seen to take the moral leadership role often occupied by a <a href="../../../c/l/e/Clergy.html" title="Clergy">professional priesthood</a>, though without any temporal authority. The functions of this branch were originally carried out by the <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hands_of_the_Cause_of_God_950d.html" title="Hands of the Cause of God">Hands of the Cause of God</a> appointed by Bahá'u'lláh, `Abdu'l-Bahá, and Shoghi Effendi. When it was determined that no more "Hands" could be appointed, the Universal House of Justice formed the <a href="../../../i/n/s/Institution_of_the_Counsellors_bbf7.html" title="Institution of the Counsellors">Institution of the Counsellors</a> to fulfill their duties. The appointed members act as individuals. While they have no authority to command or rule on matters, they are "the learned" and individuals and institutions are morally obliged to consider their opinions. These individuals inspire, encourage, enjoin, and make the community aware of relevant scripture and guidance from the central institutions. Their function is loosely defined, though their duties are divided into the two general categories of protection and propagation of the Bahá'í Faith. The learned have a similar geographic hierarchy:</p>

<p>Individual Counsellors are assigned to continental boards, where they interact directly with several National Spiritual Assemblies.

<p>Auxiliary Boards are appointed by the Continental Counsellors to assist them on a smaller geographic scale. They work with any Local Spiritual Assemblies, Regional Councils, and individuals within their jurisdiction. There are typically two boards in a single geographical region, one responsible for protection, and one for propagation of the community, though these functions often overlap.

<p>Each Auxiliary Board member appoints "assistants" that operate on their behalf at the grassroots level. These assistants often meet with Local Spiritual Assemblies, speak at events, and are sought for advice by individual community members. They will sometimes have a very localized mandate, such as to focus on youth in a particular city, or they can be appointed broadly. Their role is as flexible as their Auxiliary Board Member feels is appropriate.</p>

<p>Bahá'ís consider their electoral process to be a sacred act, essential to the health of the community. Great effort is spent on organizing elections to meet with the exacting standards set by Shoghi Effendi. As a result of such attention to the details, the process, and the spirit of the event, such carefully held elections result in what Shoghi Effendi indicates is a divinely directed election process.</p>

<p>Bahá'í elections use what is described as a three-stage councilor-republican system, which differs in who are the electors and who are the eligible members depending on the scope of the election. At all levels, only residents within the jurisdiction of the body being elected are eligible for membership, and all elections are won by plurality. In general, adult Bahá'ís in good standing resident in the jurisdiction are both the electorate (either directly or through delegation) as well as the pool of potential members of the body being elected.</p>
<p>Members are selected based on Shoghi Effendi's criteria. Bahá'í electors are called upon to look for certain qualities in those whom they elect:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"Let us recall His explicit and often-repeated assurance that every Assembly elected in that <b>rarified atmosphere of selflessness and detachment</b> is in truth, appointed of God, that its verdict is truly inspired, that one and all should submit to its decision unreservedly and with cheerfulness ... the elector ... is called upon to vote for none but those whom <b>prayer and reflection have inspired him</b> to uphold... Hence it is incumbent upon the chosen delegates to consider <b>without the least trace of passion and prejudice, and irrespective of any material consideration</b>, the names of only those who can best combine the <b>necessary qualities of unquestioned loyalty, of selfless devotion, of a well-trained mind, of recognized ability and mature experience</b>... Nothing short of the all-encompassing, all-pervading power of His Guidance and Love can enable this newly enfolded order to gather strength and flourish amid the storm and stress of a turbulent age, and in the fullness of time vindicate its high claim to be universally recognized as the one Haven of abiding felicity and peace."<sup id="_ref-election_directives_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-election_directives" title="">[1]</a></sup></dd>

<p>Shoghi Effendi sternly deprecated partisan politics and certain other practices current in western democracies, such as campaigning and nomination. As a result:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nominations and campaigning are prohibited. Bahá'ís, according to Shoghi Effendi, should not seek to advance themselves above their neighbour.</li>
<li>Voters are urged not to consult with each other about the suitability of individuals.</li>
<li>Voters are strongly encouraged to study and discuss, in abstract, the five qualities named by Shoghi Effendi as being necessary in those elected to serve, without reference to individuals.</li>
<li>Individuals should be selected <b>only</b> on the basis of the five mentioned qualities, without reference to material means or other characteristics, except insofar as they provide insight into the five qualities.</li>
<li>Those elected are expected to serve, though in cases of extreme personal difficulty, such a member may request that the body to which they are elected excuse and replace him or her.</li>
<li>In the event of a tying vote for last place, if one of these individuals is a member of a minority, this individual is automatically awarded the position. (In the US, this refers to racial minority.) If this is unclear, or if there is disagreement as to whether the minority rule applies, a run-off election is held in which votes are cast only for one of those tying.</li>
</ul>
<p>Shoghi Effendi saw these (and other) aspects as essential to preserving the full rights and prerogatives of the electors, guarding them against manipulation.</p>

<p>The earliest depiction of the administration currently at work within the world-wide Bahá'í community can be found in the writings of Bahá'u'lláh. Founded upon the belief that God guides humanity through messengers, many of whom have prophesied a "Kingdom of Heaven on earth", and the belief that Bahá'u'lláh's revelation is the fulfillment of such prophesies, Bahá'ís see in his writings a system both of God and of the people.</p>
<p>Though Bahá'u'lláh inimated, earlier, many of the policies that would form the basis of the Bahá'í administrative system earlier, his <a href="../../../k/i/t/Kit%C3%A1b-i-Aqdas_384d.html" title="Kitáb-i-Aqdas">Kitáb-i-Aqdas</a> provides the most solid initial glimpse of this system:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"The Lord hath ordained that in every city a House of Justice be established wherein shall gather counsellors to the number of Bahá, and should it exceed this number it doth not matter. They should consider themselves as entering the Court of the presence of God, the Exalted, the Most High, and as beholding Him Who is the Unseen. It behoveth them to be the trusted ones of the Merciful among men and to regard themselves as the guardians appointed of God for all that dwell on earth. It is incumbent upon them to take counsel together and to have regard for the interests of the servants of God, for His sake, even as they regard their own interests, and to choose that which is meet and seemly. Thus hath the Lord your God commanded you. Beware lest ye put away that which is clearly revealed in His Tablet. Fear God, O ye that perceive."
<dl>
<dd>(Kitáb-i-Aqdas, paragraph 30) <a href="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Kit%C3%A1b-i-Aqdas#Paragraph_30" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Kit%C3%A1b-i-Aqdas#Paragraph_30" rel="nofollow">[9]</a></dd>

<p>This House of Justice is described as being in concert with Baha'u'llah and the <a href="../../../a/g/h/Aghs%C3%A1n.html" title="Aghsán">Aghsán</a>, his descendants, but with the responsibility for creating and abrogating laws not explicitly revealed in the sacred scripture.</p>
<p>Over time, these concepts were clarified initially in Bahá'u'lláh's writings, and then in those of his eldest son and successor, <a href="../../../%60/a/b/%60Abdu%27l-Bah%C3%A1_f3c9.html" title="`Abdu'l-Bahá">`Abdu'l-Bahá</a>.</p>

<p>It was `Abdu'l-Bahá who clarified the differing roles of Supreme/Universal (global) vs. the local Houses of Justice. During `Abdu'l-Bahá's life, he oversaw and encouraged the establishment of many elected local councils, calling them "Spiritual Assemblies". He wrote many clarifying letters, giving instructions to various Spiritual Assemblies, inspiring the Bahá'í world. The <a href="../../../t/a/b/Tablets_of_the_Divine_Plan_8248.html" title="Tablets of the Divine Plan">Tablets of the Divine Plan</a> stand out, however, and formed a great part of the early goal setting and planning processes of the nascent spiritual community. This plan opened up whole new geographic regions to the Bahá'ís, `Abdu'l-Bahá encouraging Bahá'ís to connect with the peoples of all races and cultures.</p>
<p>One of his greatest legacies to the development of the Bahá'í administrative system, however, was his <a href="../../../w/i/l/Will_and_Testament_of_%60Abdu%27l-Bah%C3%A1_5a35.html" title="Will and Testament of `Abdu'l-Bahá">will and testament</a>, wherein he describes several new institutions. Clarifying Bahá'u'lláh's comments about his descendants and authority, he described <a href="../../../s/h/o/Shoghi_Effendi_4011.html#Guardianship" title="Shoghi Effendi">the Institution of the Guardianship</a>, which he saw as functioning in concert with the <a href="../../../u/n/i/Universal_House_of_Justice_dedd.html" title="Universal House of Justice">Universal House of Justice</a> - one bearing responsibility for interpretation of scripture, the other as legislator of new law not covered by existing scripture. To these he commanded the obedience of the Bahá'ís.</p>

<dd>"The sacred and youthful branch, the Guardian of the Cause of God, as well as the Universal House of Justice to be universally elected and established, are both under the care and protection of the Abhá Beauty, under the shelter and unerring guidance of the Exalted One (may my life be offered up for them both). Whatsoever they decide is of God. Whoso obeyeth him not, neither obeyeth them, hath not obeyed God; whoso rebelleth against him and against them hath rebelled against God; whoso opposeth him hath opposed God; whoso contendeth with them hath contended with God; whoso disputeth with him hath disputed with God"

<p>Under Shoghi Effendi, the Bahá'í Faith underwent its most dramatic shift in shape and process. While evolving from the skeletal structure established by Bahá'u'lláh and `Abdu'l-Bahá, Shoghi Effendi instituted large-scale campaigns of administrative consolidation, established practices and procedures for Bahá'í administrative bodies, appointed more Hands of the Cause, secured the legal position of the Bahá'í Community both in Haifa, but also, working with newly formed National Spiritual Assemblies, with many national governments. Over this period, Bahá'í institutions and inter-institutional collaboration became clearer, many finer points of Bahá'í law were explained, and the faith was spread to most of the globe. Bahá'í marriages became recognized in their own right in several regions and the Bahá'í Faith was recognized as an independent religion by many nations and religious courts, including Islamic religious courts in Egypt. Shoghi Effendi described the passing of `Abdu'l-Bahá and the start of his own administration as the end of the "Heroic age" and the start of the "Formative" age of the Bahá'í Faith.</p>

<p>Shoghi Effendi died in <a href="../../../1/9/5/1957.html" title="1957">1957</a> with no children, and no will could be found. The 27 living <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hands_of_the_Cause_401b.html" title="Hands of the Cause">Hands of the Cause</a>, appointed for life by Shoghi Effendi and referred to by him as "the Chief Stewards of Bahá'u'lláh's embryonic World Commonwealth"<a href="http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/se/MBW/mbw-59.html#gr6" class="external autonumber" title="http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/se/MBW/mbw-59.html#gr6" rel="nofollow">[11]</a> signed a unanimous proclamation on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_25.html" title="November 25">November 25</a>, 1957, shortly after the passing of Shoghi Effendi, stating that he had died "without having appointed his successor", and leaving further decisions about the Guardianship to the <a href="../../../u/n/i/Universal_House_of_Justice_dedd.html" title="Universal House of Justice">Universal House of Justice</a> which had yet to be elected. When, shortly after its ultimate election in 1963, this body examined the question of the succession of the Guardian it determined that there was no way to satisfy the provisions of the will and testament of `Abdu'l-Bahá, and that, therefore, no successor to the Shoghi Effendi could be named. Creating a constitution for itself that incorporated obedience to the body of Shoghi Effendi's writings, and to those of `Abdu'l-Bahá and Bahá'u'lláh, the Universal House of Justice assumed full authority over the affairs of the Bahá'í community.</p>
<p>In 1968 the Universal House of Justice in collaboration with the Hands of the Cause created the <a href="../../../i/n/s/Institution_of_the_Counsellors_bbf7.html" title="Institution of the Counsellors">Continental Boards of Counsellors</a>, since only a Guardian of the Cause could appoint such. In 1973 the <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Teaching_Centre_be52.html" title="International Teaching Centre">International Teaching Centre</a> was established to work with the remaining Hands of the Cause acting as liaisons between the Counsellors and the House of Justice. That same year the Auxiliary Board members were authorized to name "assistants" to act on local levels.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/h/Bah%C3%A1%27%C3%AD_administration.html" title="Edit section: Modern evolution">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Modern evolution</span></h3>
<p>100 Years after Bahá'u'lláh's death, the Bahá'ís celebrated a "holy year", during which the fully authorized translation of the <a href="../../../k/i/t/Kit%C3%A1b-i-Aqdas_384d.html" title="Kitáb-i-Aqdas">Kitáb-i-Aqdas</a> (Most Holy Book) was published. Coinciding with this was a process of re-examination of intra-Bahá'í administrative and community action, the implementation of <a href="../../../b/a/h/Bah%C3%A1%27%C3%AD_laws.html" title="Bahá'í laws">Bahá'í law</a> in greater degrees among non-Iranian Bahá'ís, and the maturation of the Spiritual Assemblies.</p>
<p>Through a series of plans, the Universal House of Justice refocused the Bahá'í community on community development, and systematization of best-practices, hoping to reduce the "boom and bust" cycles of community growth encountered in the previous century. The Bahá'í community began to incorporate more active service, socio-economic development efforts ballooned in number, and local and national communities became more focused on examining the needs of their wider non-Bahá'í communities, to see how the faith could aid them. The earliest days of the <a href="../../../2/1/s/21st_Century_ad84.html" title="21st Century">21st Century</a> saw the Bahá'ís begin to pare down their administrative structures, appoint fewer committees, and focus on very specific goals outlined by the Universal House of Justice - namely the creation of small <a href="../../../b/a/h/Bah%C3%A1%27%C3%AD_study_circle.html" title="Bahá'í study circle">grass-roots study groups</a>, the creation of more neighbourhood-centric children's classes, and the increase in the spiritual character of the community through small devotional gatherings. The Bahá'ís were encouraged not to see these "core activities" as simply Bahá'í activities. Rather, these were to be seen as activities which were open to the wider community, but would be characteristic of a Bahá'í's community life.</p>
<p>This period also saw the establishment of regional councils, who form a level of administrative action more specific than a National Spiritual Assembly, but broader than the civic locality, a boundary which almost always defines the jurisdictions of Local Spiritual Assembly. These seem to be evolving and assuming many growth and consolidation and educational functions of Local Spiritual Assemblies, allowing these local bodies to meet the more personal needs of their community members.</p>
<p>The present-day Bahá'í local, national and international communities experiment with community development methods, and seem to be attempting to harness the administrative structure to canalize grass-roots initiatives, rather than have higher institutions dictate highly specific plans and practices.</p>
