<p>It already says the Haifa group is the largest. If you want to qualify that with "overwhelmingly" I wouldn't object. However, we don't really know the populations of any of these groups, so specific numbers would be out of place, I think. And the number of LSA's has nothing to do with anything, except possibly establishing a minimum figure. <a href="../../../d/a/w/User%7EDawud_5c1e.html" title="User:Dawud">Dawud</a> 06:25, 10 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've expanded the entries under the disambiguation page, however I don't think this category actually requires a disambiguation page. It's not as if there is another competing definition for Bahá'í (like there is for <a href="../../../m/e/r/Mercury_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Mercury (disambiguation)">mercury</a>), rather different sectarian groupings have different beliefs and opinions. Thus, the page should attempt to represent an NPOV between the various sectarian interpretations (as a general page) with links to specific pages for separate groups.

<p>I think you're correct in that the various groups should be covered in the Bahá'í Divisions page.</p>
<p>However, please correct me if I am wrong, but disambiguation pages are for when there are competing definitions of a word. To use Wikipedia's example, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mercury" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mercury" rel="nofollow">Mercury</a>rm li can mean:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mercury the planet</li>
<li>Mercury the element</li>
<li>Mercury the plant</li>
<li>Mercury the magazine etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is no competing definition for Baha'i. The fact that different sectarian groups with the Baha'i religion have differing beliefs and opinions, does not mean that there should be a disambiguation page with links pointing to each (but if you are going to have it, what is the logic in not expanding it?)</p>
<p>It is like the disambiguation page for <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Islam (disambiguation)">Islam (disambiguation)</a>. It only points to</p>
<ul>
<li>Islam the religion</li>
<li>The president of Uzbekistan</li>
<li>Cat Stevens</li>
</ul>
<p>Not Sunni, Shi'i, Ibadi, Zaydi, Druze etc. Instead, the body of the Islam article does have information and links to various sects and groups including the Babi and Baha'i faiths.</p>
<p>What I suggest is that the disambiguation page be removed, and the main body reflect dissent on certain points from sectarian groups, including their links and a link to Bahá'í Divisions.</p>

<dd>Thanks for the constructive dialogue Sufisticaed. I think the difference between the Islam page is that the divisions within Islam are each of a sizeable percentage of the total number of Muslims (especially referring to the Snni and Shi'i sects). The globally recognized Baha'i Faith (i.e. United Nations, Foreign Affairs Departments of many countries) is the one that has its world centre in Haifa, Israel. The other divisions are quite small, and given that the disambiguation link (which links to all the other divisions) is right at the top of the page, where everyone can see it, I think is appropriate. -- <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeff3000_72a5.html" title="User:Jeff3000">Jeff3000</a> 14:47, 14 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi Jeff, the problem as I see it is that it is out of keeping with Wikipedia rules as it were. Even though numerically the various sects might be small, their influence on Baha'i theology and practice is quite large. Furthermore, if you include unaffilliated Baha'is (Baha'is who are not officially enrolled members of the BIC, unenrolled Baha'is etc.) then the numbers shoot right up in terms of sectarian divisions. Sufisticated</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The divisions that are considered sects probably represent less than two thousand combined, and they actually have no influence on theology. Most Baha'is don't even know that they exist and have never heard of their theology. I would assume that the only reason you're suggesting this is that you are a supporter of that theology, or you are trying to damage the credibility of the Faith by advertising those groups which are pretty much defunct.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The concept of covenant-breaking is an important one within Baha'i theology, and the impact of various sectarian divisions has been disproportionate to their numerical strength. Each of the major leadership changes, have been accompanied by minor revolutions in the way the succession was perceived. Remember the *entire* French National Spiritual Assembly was considered dissolved by the Hands when they supported Mason Remey's claim to guardianship. (See MacEoin, Denis, "Baha'ism", <i>A New Handbook of Living Religions</i>, ed. John R. Hinnells, (London: Penguin Books, 1997) 620-622). There is also a rising phenomenon of unaffiliated Baha'is, particularly in the academic community, and perhaps reflected in the high 'inactive status' rate on community roles, which will probably make for some interesting reading if someone/I get the time to write it up.</dd>

<dd>However, this conversation is not about the history and influence of sectarian division within the Baha'i religion. Not that it should matter, but I am not a Baha'i, so I have no interest in propogating the apologetics of either the Baha'is as represented by the Universal House of Justice in Haifa, nor the Orthodox Baha'is, etc. etc. I'm aiming for a NPOV, difficult as that is to attain at times.

<dd>The main article should be concise and to the point. I personally almost cut it in half while cropping out entire sections that were unnecessary, and shortening others.

<dd>That's my point Cuñado, disambiguation pages *aren't* for links to further information. See <a href="../../../d/i/s/Disambiguation.html#What_NOT_to_put_on_disambiguation_pages" title="Disambiguation">Disambiguation#What_NOT_to_put_on_disambiguation_pages</a>. Actually there *is* a legitimate need for a Baha'i disambiguation page, not to point to sub-sects within the Baha'i religion, but to let readers choose between:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<pre>
   :::: Baha'i (the religion)
   :::: Baha'i (the eleventh century theologian)
</pre>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>To that end, I'm proposing to change the disambiguation page to reflect the legitimate choices (I'm keen to write up a page on Shaykh Baha'i anyway) and then the main Baha'i page will need some minor editing to reflect the incorporation of various sectarian histories.

<dl>
<dd>Indeed you are not wrong, however, disambiguation pages often include articles which have the same word derivitive, but different meanings. eg:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The word <b>Baha'i</b> can mean one of several things:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <b>Bahá'í</b> who is a follower of the religious leader <a href="../../../b/a/h/Bah%C3%A1%27u%27ll%C3%A1h.html" title="Bahá'u'lláh">Bahá'u'lláh</a> with several devisions:
<ul>
<li>The largest sect <a href="../../../b/a/h/Bah%C3%A1%27%C3%AD_Faith_7cf9.html" title="Bahá'í Faith">Bahá'í Faith</a></li>
<li>A much smaller sect <a href="../../../o/r/t/Orthodox_Bah%C3%A1%27%C3%AD_Faith_bdfe.html" title="Orthodox Bahá'í Faith">Orthodox Bahá'í Faith</a></li>
<li>with other <a href="../../../b/a/h/Bah%C3%A1%27%C3%AD_divisions.html" title="Bahá'í divisions">Bahá'í divisions</a> making up less than half a percent</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Shaykh <b>Baha'i</b>, an eleventh Century theologian.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>So in fact, the present page is alright (possibly need a little more formatting and trimming) but needs a bit about Shaykh Baha'i. If you're still worried, think of disambiguation pages as an aid to navigation.

I actually work in the academic field of Islamic studies for a major university and the Baha'i religion is a sub-interest of mine, but don't let the appeal to authority get in the way:) But I tell you what, to show you I'm actually interested in contributing substantially, and not just tinkering at the edges, I'm happy to fill out <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shaykh_Bahai_2b42.html" title="Shaykh Bahai">Shaykh Bahai</a> and then we can talk about making this a disambiguation page worth its name.
