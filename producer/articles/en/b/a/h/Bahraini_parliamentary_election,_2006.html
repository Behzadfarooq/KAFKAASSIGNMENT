<p>Bahrain held parliamentary elections on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_25.html" title="November 25">25 November</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> for the 40-seat lower house of parliament, the Chamber of Deputies, as well as municipal elections. There was a 72% turnout in the first round of polling. As expected by most observers Shia and Sunni Islamists dominated the poll, winning a clean sweep in the first round of voting, while <a href="../../../e/c/o/Economists_Bloc_663c.html" title="Economists Bloc">liberal</a> and <a href="../../../d/e/m/Democratic_Progressive_Tribune_-_Bahrain_92ab.html" title="Democratic Progressive Tribune - Bahrain">ex-communist</a> MPs lost all their seats. Four candidates of the left-wing <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Democratic_Action_3eea.html" title="National Democratic Action">National Democratic Action</a> (also known as Wa'ad) made it through to second round run-off which was held on December 2, 2006.</p>
<p>The election was preceded by a major political realignment that saw the four opposition parties that boycotted 2002's election agree to take part in the political process. The former alliance consists of Bahrain's main <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shia.html" title="Shia">Shia</a> Islamist party, <a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Wefaq_7889.html" title="Al Wefaq">Al Wefaq</a>, the radical Shia Islamist, <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamic_Action_Society_d6e8.html" title="Islamic Action Society">Al Amal</a>, Leftist <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Democratic_Action_3eea.html" title="National Democratic Action">Waad</a> and the <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nationalist_Democratic_Rally_Society_77f1.html" title="Nationalist Democratic Rally Society">former Baathists</a>. To meet the challenge posed by Al Wefaq, the two main Sunni Islamist parties, the <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salafist.html" title="Salafist">salafist</a> <a href="../../../a/s/a/Asalah.html" title="Asalah">Asalah</a> and the <a href="../../../m/u/s/Muslim_Brotherhood_ed9f.html" title="Muslim Brotherhood">Muslim Brotherhood</a>-affiliated <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Menbar_Islamic_Society_d9df.html" title="Al-Menbar Islamic Society">Al-Menbar Islamic Society</a>, agreed to form a coalition to maximise their votes.</p>

<p>Predictably, the main issues of <a href="../../../p/o/l/Politics_of_Bahrain_f621.html" title="Politics of Bahrain">Bahraini politics</a> dominated the campaign, but with Al Wefaq entering the fray, competing candidates turned their attention to its agenda, particularly the party's relationship with the highest Shia religious body in Bahrain, the Islamic Scholars Council. Several candidates claimed that they were being forced out of the race, including Jassim Abdulaal of the <a href="../../../e/c/o/Economists_Bloc_663c.html" title="Economists Bloc">Economists Bloc</a>, by influential clerics who told their congregations who to vote for<a href="http://mahmood.tv/?p=2914" class="external autonumber" title="http://mahmood.tv/?p=2914" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. The criticism became more pointed after the Council described Al Wefaq as the 'Bloc of Believers'.</p>

<p>The Shia Islamist <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamic_Action_Society_d6e8.html" title="Islamic Action Society">Al Amal</a>, which has close links with the 'Shirazi faction', was most specific in its criticism. Its head, Sheikh Mohammad Ali Al Mahfood, complained: "The Islamic Scholars Council should not dictate how people vote and should allow them to make their own personal choices about the most competent candidates. It looks as if the Council has turned into a partisan umbrella for a specific society and this diminishes its authority and confines its influence. We have often blamed the government for appointing 40 members to the bi-cameral parliament, yet we are doing the same thing and hijacking the people's right to make their own choices" <a href="http://www.gulfnews.com/region/Bahrain/10082339.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.gulfnews.com/region/Bahrain/10082339.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></p>
<p>Al Wefaq in turn denied that it intimidated opponents; its leader, <a href="../../../a/l/i/Ali_Salman_26cb.html" title="Ali Salman">Sheikh Ali Salman</a>, told a press conference "Let's make it clear to those campaigning against us, that we respect our competitors, whoever they are, and would do nothing to harm them."<a href="http://www.gulf-daily-news.com/Story.asp?Article=161636&amp;Sn=BNEW&amp;IssueID=29238" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.gulf-daily-news.com/Story.asp?Article=161636&amp;Sn=BNEW&amp;IssueID=29238" rel="nofollow">[3]</a></p>
<p>Al Wefaq campaigned for greater government subsidies for low income families, with the party's candidate, Dr Jasim Husain, who is the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Bahrain_1a81.html" title="University of Bahrain">University of Bahrain</a> Research Deanship Economic Research Unit Head, saying "People today have to pay rent, electricity, telephone, Internet and water bills, in addition to other fees. They have to buy food, clothing, pay for car instalments and even recreation. But this is impossible, because many fall short as their salaries are not enough." Dr Husain said that government complacency was a problem, especially after the latest United Nations Human Development Report 2006 ranks Bahrain 39th out of 177 countries and second only to Kuwait in the Arab world<a href="http://www.undp.org/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.undp.org/" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>. Dr Husain said that the country could do better by looking to the future: "The government should be giving more money to education and training, rather than defence and police. We are not saying that defence and police are not important, but they should be given less attention."<a href="http://www.gulf-daily-news.com/Story.asp?Article=161719&amp;Sn=BNEW&amp;IssueID=29239" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.gulf-daily-news.com/Story.asp?Article=161719&amp;Sn=BNEW&amp;IssueID=29239" rel="nofollow">[5]</a></p>

<p>The government responded to criticism on social welfare by announcing that it will put forward legislation so that Bahrain becomes the first Arab country to introduce unemployment benefit. According to economist, Alaa al-Yousuf, Bahrain has an unemployment rate of 15%, with women very over-represented<a href="http://www.boston.com/news/world/europe/articles/2006/10/23/bahrain_plans_unemployment_benefits/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.boston.com/news/world/europe/articles/2006/10/23/bahrain_plans_unemployment_benefits/" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>. The government's announcement is interpreted as pre-emptive of an expected move by the new parliament to draft legislation to bring in unemployment benefit, which would allow MPs to claim the credit. The introduction of unemployment benefit was not supported by all candidates, <a href="../../../d/e/m/Democratic_Progressive_Tribune_-_Bahrain_92ab.html" title="Democratic Progressive Tribune - Bahrain">National Unity Bloc</a> candidate in Hamad Town, Abbas Ayed, portrayed the move as symptomatic of a government approach that recognises problems after they happen, but has failed to take preventative measures to stop them in the first place. Instead, Mr Ayed called for greater investment in training and education for Bahraini workers: "Train them and remove expatriate workers and see if they can do their jobs or not."<a href="http://www.gulf-daily-news.com/Story.asp?Article=161873&amp;Sn=BNEW&amp;IssueID=29241" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.gulf-daily-news.com/Story.asp?Article=161873&amp;Sn=BNEW&amp;IssueID=29241" rel="nofollow">[7]</a></p>

<p>Al Wefaq and the other three parties that boycotted the 2002 poll have stated that they will use their presence in the 2006 parliament to campaign for a single elected legislature, and Al Wefaq has gone further and committed itself to reform of the judiciary. The party wants to see the Supreme Judiciary Council elected by all the judges in the country instead of being appointed by its Supreme Chairman <a href="../../../k/i/n/King_Hamad_a038.html" title="King Hamad">King Hamad</a>. Al Wefaq candidate Sayed Haidar Al Sitri has proposed that the elected president of the Council should be independent ensure and neither influenced by the National Assembly nor the government, saying: "Bahrain is developing and also its judiciary system, which we hope will be completely independent."<a href="http://www.gulf-daily-news.com/Story.asp?Article=161119&amp;Sn=BNEW&amp;IssueID=29233" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.gulf-daily-news.com/Story.asp?Article=161119&amp;Sn=BNEW&amp;IssueID=29233" rel="nofollow">[8]</a></p>
<p>The outgoing parliamentary speaker, <a href="../../../k/h/a/Khalifa_Al_Dhahrani_97d9.html" title="Khalifa Al Dhahrani">Khalifa Al Dhahrani</a>, beat a strong challenge in his constituency in <a href="../../../r/i/f/Riffa.html" title="Riffa">Riffa</a> from Sheikh Salman Bin Saqr Al Khalifa, who is a member of the <a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Khalifa_17eb.html" title="Al Khalifa">Al Khalifa</a> family and journalist with the Al Wasat newspaper. Sheikh Salman said that as a member of the royal ramily he hopes his decision to contest the elections will stimulate other members of the ruling families in the Gulf countries to contest national elections and "end a tradition of not running in public polls"<a href="http://www.gulfnews.com/region/Bahrain/10084849.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.gulfnews.com/region/Bahrain/10084849.html" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>.</p>

<p>Al Dhahrani, who is backed by Sunni Islamists, has a further challenge in retaining the speakership after his previous performance was criticised for failing to control <a href="../../../m/o/h/Mohammed_Khalid_1f24.html" title="Mohammed Khalid">radical Islamist MPs</a> in the debating chamber. <a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Wefaq_7889.html" title="Al Wefaq">Al Wefaq</a> leader <a href="../../../a/l/i/Ali_Salman_26cb.html" title="Ali Salman">Ali Salman</a> may run for speaker post elections.</p>
<p>Al Wefaq was skillful in how it criticised the government, taking it to task over its track record in providing goods and services to Bahrainis rather than questioning its political legitimacy per se - for instance, in a televised debate on <a href="../../../b/a/h/Bahrain_Radio_and_Television_Corporation_5865.html" title="Bahrain Radio and Television Corporation">Bahrain TV</a>, Ali Salman accused the administration of being 'lazy'<a href="http://uk.news.yahoo.com/22112006/323/bahrain-women-shiite-opposition-eye-bigger-role-polls.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://uk.news.yahoo.com/22112006/323/bahrain-women-shiite-opposition-eye-bigger-role-polls.html" rel="nofollow">[10]</a> and failing to meet its obligations in education and employment. This is a theme that Al Wefaq is likely to continue in parliament with Ali Salman promising, "If we find the necessary cooperation [from government], we will be highly positive. But if we find that the government or one of its ministers is stalling people's interests, then we will hold them responsible."<a href="http://www.gulfnews.com/region/Bahrain/10084211.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.gulfnews.com/region/Bahrain/10084211.html" rel="nofollow">[11]</a></p>

This makes her the first woman to serve in an elected parliament in the Gulf. Critics have accused the government of engineering her victory because it wanted to see a woman win and they are aware that it is highly unlikely any woman will be elected in the voting.</p>
<p>Several female candidates faced an orchestrated campaign of political abuse against them through text messages telling them to withdraw from the contest and one woman had her election marquee burnt to the ground. Women's organisations have been strongly criticised for not doing enough to support female candidates; liberal columnist <a href="../../../s/a/w/Sawsan_Al_Sha%27er_258c.html" title="Sawsan Al Sha'er">Sawsan Al Sha'er</a> commented, "We have seen business leaders, liberal thinkers and even foreign religious scholars move from one tent to the other to interact with constituents or deliver lectures. But we have not seen any women's organisation do or say anything throughout this month. We had high expectations because the elections are a golden opportunity for women to highlight their programmes and ambitions. But instead, we see that the women's societies have withdrawn into their shells." <a href="http://www.gulfnews.com/region/Bahrain/10084210.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.gulfnews.com/region/Bahrain/10084210.html" rel="nofollow">[12]</a></p>

The NDA along with the National Unity Bloc were the only two parties fielding female candidates; both parties have their origins in Bahrain's Marxist movement. However, all parties with the exception of salafist <a href="../../../a/s/a/Asalah.html" title="Asalah">Asalah</a> have publicly stated that they do not object to women MPs. Asalah for its part has said that its position reflects its "honesty" and has inferred that opponents are being hypocritical.</p>

<p>The domination of politics by religious parties has seen concerns raised by the business community that their voice will be marginalised. The agenda of both Al Wefaq and the Sunni Islamists has been portrayed by opponents as "statist", while there are concerns that the government may be tempted to buy off opponents in parliament through traditional clientelism by providing their supporters with jobs in the civil service, thus further bloating the public sector. Ironically, business representatives, being both liberal and anti-sectarian, tend to have most in common with parties on the Left of Bahrain's political spectrum, such as the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Democratic_Action_3eea.html" title="National Democratic Action">National Democratic Action</a>. Perhaps symbolically, the NDA's leader, Ibrahim Sharif, is a former banker. However, with Left-wing and liberal parties faring badly in the polls, business groups have been urged not to back specific parties and risk alienating opponents, but to lobby MPs after the election to ensure they understand businesses' concerns<a href="http://www.gulf-daily-news.com/Story.asp?Article=160863&amp;Sn=BNEW&amp;IssueID=29230" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.gulf-daily-news.com/Story.asp?Article=160863&amp;Sn=BNEW&amp;IssueID=29230" rel="nofollow">[13]</a>.</p>

<p>Leading Shia authority, <a href="../../../s/i/s/Sistani.html" title="Sistani">Grand Ayatollah Al Sistani</a> advised Bahraini Shi'a to participate in the poll, in a move similar to the edict received in 2002 by Salafist leader, <a href="../../../a/d/e/Adel_Mouwda_b616.html" title="Adel Mouwda">Adel Al Mouawda</a>, from Sunni religious authorities in Saudi Arabia that allowed him and other Sunnis to vote and run in the elections.</p>
<p>Turnout is expected to be "fairly high" according to a survey by Al-Wasat, which predicts that it should be significantly up on 2002's 53% participation rate. Shia religious scholar Sheikh Isa Qassim has been urging voters to go to turn out in the polls. "Boycotting the elections would be a grave mistake," said the fatwa that the Shiite establishment. According to a poll in Al Wasat newspaper, 1.9% of voters will heed calls for a boycott being made by a splinter group of Salafists and the <a href="../../../h/a/q/Haq_Movement_272e.html" title="Haq Movement">Haq Movement</a><a href="http://www.gulfnews.com/region/Bahrain/10082914.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.gulfnews.com/region/Bahrain/10082914.html" rel="nofollow">[14]</a>.</p>
<p>Bahrain's opposition candidates will not win more than 25 of the 40 seats up for grabs in the parliamentary elections, Al Wefaq Society leader Shaikh Ali Salman has said. The leader who is himself a candidate in the Northern Governorate did not explain how he arrived at the figure, but said that the opposition would be working with the government for more reforms. "If we find the necessary cooperation, we will be highly positive. But if we find that the government or one of its ministers is stalling people's interests, then we will hold them responsible."</p>

<p>Several individuals contesting the election had faced accused of links with international terrorism. In a bitter battle in <a href="../../../r/i/f/Riffa.html" title="Riffa">Riffa</a>, extremist Salafist, <a href="../../../j/a/s/Jassim_Al_Saeedi_26c7.html" title="Jassim Al Saeedi">Jassim Al Saeedi</a>, was being challenged from the Right by Muhejeudeen Mohmood Mohyeden, who claimed that the government branded him an <a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Qaeda_48e2.html" title="Al Qaeda">Al Qaeda</a> operative. Mr Mohyeden says that the allegations arose from his role as a volunteer fighting against the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan <a href="http://www.middle-east-online.com/english/?id=18440" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.middle-east-online.com/english/?id=18440" rel="nofollow">[15]</a>, but that instead of undermining his campaign the claims helped to raise his profile in the conservative constituency.</p>
<p>Municipal candidate, Muhieddin Khan, (who is backed by the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Justice_Movement_762a.html" title="National Justice Movement">National Justice Movement</a>) spent most of the election campaign before a Bahraini court charged with planning terror attacks. Mr Khan, along with three other alleged members of the cell, was only found not guilty on 20 November 2006, less than five days before the poll. After the verdict Mr Khan announced that he is suing the Bahraini government for BD700,000 for harassment.</p>
<p>On the Shia Right, Al Amal is seen as the direct descendent of the group that plotted a coup d'etat in Bahrain in 1981; the party's leaders only returned to public life in Bahrain after they returned from exile or were released from prison in 2001.</p>

<p>The political campaign began in controversial circumstances in September 2006, with the <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bandargate_scandal.html" title="Bandargate scandal">Bandargate scandal</a>, in which it was alleged that a secret organization of government officials were planning to rig the elections to marginalize the <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shia.html" title="Shia">Shia</a> community. Under the plan, an alleged secret organization set up a <a href="../../../s/l/u/Slush_fund.html" title="Slush fund">slush fund</a> to finance candidates sympathetic to the government, with sums of hundreds of dinars given to several candidates in order to lessen the number of seats won by <a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Wefaq_7889.html" title="Al Wefaq">Al Wefaq</a> <a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2006/11/17/africa/ME_GEN_Bahrain_Elections.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2006/11/17/africa/ME_GEN_Bahrain_Elections.php" rel="nofollow">[16]</a>. The plot led to crisis talks between <a href="../../../k/i/n/King_Hamad_a038.html" title="King Hamad">King Hamad</a> and the leaders of Bahrain's political parties, as well as senior clerics, such as Sheikh Isa Qassim. After being given assurances from the King, opposition groups announced that they would continue to participate in the poll<a href="http://www.khaleejtimes.com/DisplayArticleNew.asp?xfile=data/middleeast/2006/October/middleeast_October184.xml&amp;section=middleeast" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.khaleejtimes.com/DisplayArticleNew.asp?xfile=data/middleeast/2006/October/middleeast_October184.xml&amp;section=middleeast" rel="nofollow">[17]</a>.</p>
<p>Subsequently, poll monitors, the Bahrain Transparency Society, registered 79 violations ranging from oversized banners and posters, out-of-place billboards, attacks on the character of contenders, dissemination of lies and rumours, anti-women calls and the use of mosques to promote candidates.<a href="http://www.gulfnews.com/region/Bahrain/10083794.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.gulfnews.com/region/Bahrain/10083794.html" rel="nofollow">[18]</a>. Opponents of prominent Leftist candidate, Dr Munira Fakhro, have sought to use text messaging to try to portray her as anti-religious, receiving backing from by both the government and Al Wefaq, and drawn attention to her personal wealth. Dr Fakhro dismissed the attacks: "To say that only a poor person can feel with the poor is ludicrous and illogical."<a href="http://www.gulf-daily-news.com/Story.asp?Article=162224&amp;Sn=BNEW&amp;IssueID=29244" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.gulf-daily-news.com/Story.asp?Article=162224&amp;Sn=BNEW&amp;IssueID=29244" rel="nofollow">[19]</a></p>

<p>According to the Dubai-based <a href="../../../g/u/l/Gulf_News_ee8f.html" title="Gulf News">Gulf News</a>:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Tomorrow’s Parliamentary elections are widely expected to change the face of Bahrain's politics as the opposition is set to win the majority of seats of the Council of Representatives, controlled for the past four years by a strong pro-government block.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>However, a victory by the opposition, many in this open-minded and multicultural state fear, may deal a significant blow to the country's withering liberal tradition.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>The Islamists, led by Bahrain's biggest Islamic society, Al Wefaq, are coming, warns a leading liberal activist.</i></dd>
<dd><i>The liberal elite are worried the upcoming Parliament "will restrict whatever personal freedoms may have been left" in a country where the people are used to a Western-like lifestyle, said Abdullah Al Madani.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>More than 30 Islamist candidates are expected to win seats, including 17 from Al Wefaq, a Shiite group, and six from the Sunni Salafi group Al Assalah.</i><a href="http://www.gulf-news.com/region/Bahrain/10084848.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.gulf-news.com/region/Bahrain/10084848.html" rel="nofollow">[24]</a></dd>
</dl>
<p>There are also concerns that domination of parliament by Islamists from two different sects arguing contentious issues in the chamber may further encourage sectarianism. Bahrain's leading salafist politician, <a href="../../../a/d/e/Adel_Mouwda_b616.html" title="Adel Mouwda">Sheikh Adel Al Mouwdah</a>, has sought to play down the fears and welcomed the prospect of working with Al Wefaq and other Shia Islamists, seeing opportunities for cooperation, saying "I would rather have Islamists from both Sunni and Shiite sects than liberal deputies who do not uphold Islamic values."<a href="http://www.gulfnews.com/region/Bahrain/10084607.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.gulfnews.com/region/Bahrain/10084607.html" rel="nofollow">[25]</a></p>
<p>Government officials have sought to downplay concerns that the Islamist victory will have negative implications for personal freedoms in the Kingdom. Government spokeswoman, Ahdeya Ahmed, said that the several Islamists represented in the previous parliament had not managed to pass legislation to segregate <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Bahrain_1a81.html" title="University of Bahrain">Bahrain University</a> or introduce <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religious_police.html" title="Religious police">'Vice and Virtue'</a> police, and neither had Shia and Sunni Islamists working together on municipal councils sought to target people's rights.<a href="http://www.gulfnews.com/region/Bahrain/10085797.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.gulfnews.com/region/Bahrain/10085797.html" rel="nofollow">[26]</a></p>
<p>Almost immediately after Ms Ahmed made her comments, new Al Wefaq MP, Sayed Abdulla Al A'ali, announced that he wanted to see legislation introduced to restrict employment opportunities for women to prevent them entering 'male orientated jobs'<a href="http://www.gulf-daily-news.com/Story.asp?Article=163056&amp;Sn=BNEW&amp;IssueID=29254" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.gulf-daily-news.com/Story.asp?Article=163056&amp;Sn=BNEW&amp;IssueID=29254" rel="nofollow">[27]</a>. While the government has reacted to the sweeping Islamist victory by announcing a clamp on alcohol sales in residential areas<a href="http://www.gulf-daily-news.com/Story.asp?Article=163147&amp;Sn=BNEW&amp;IssueID=29255" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.gulf-daily-news.com/Story.asp?Article=163147&amp;Sn=BNEW&amp;IssueID=29255" rel="nofollow">[28]</a>.</p>
