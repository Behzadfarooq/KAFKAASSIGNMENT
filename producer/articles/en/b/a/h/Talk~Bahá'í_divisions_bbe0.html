<p>I added a long quote about the roles of the Guardian and the Universal House of Justice. The issue of which quotes to add and where was becoming an issue on the <a href="../../../b/a/h/Bah%C3%A1%27%C3%ADs_Under_the_Provisions_of_the_Covenant_b9ca.html" title="Bahá'ís Under the Provisions of the Covenant">BUPC</a> page and I thought having this here would be relevant, and avoid the argument being repeated on several pages.</p>
<p>The quote is long, but I couldn't think of any way to shrink its size without removing something critical. <a href="../../../c/u/n/User%7ECunado19_ff71.html" title="User:Cunado19"><font color="#D14C04"><b>Cuñado</b></font></a> <a href="http://www.bahai.us/" class="external text" title="http://www.bahai.us/" rel="nofollow"></a><a href="../../../b/a/h/Image%7EBahaitemplatestar.png_81d9.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/1/1d/Bahaitemplatestar.png/20px-Bahaitemplatestar.png" alt="" width="20" height="19" longdesc="../../../b/a/h/Image%7EBahaitemplatestar.png_81d9.html" /></a> - <a href="../../../c/u/n/User_talk%7ECunado19_98ea.html" title="User talk:Cunado19"><font size="-3">Talk</font></a> 06:37, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>It <i>does</i> open up the question of whether the Institution exists separately from the individual serving in that capacity. Does the institution exist without a serving member? Clearly Remey/Marangella et. al. insist that it does not. Clearly the Baha'is assert that it does.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>We <b>should not</b> debate this here. If either posistion can present clear documentation for either position, <b>that</b> should be presented and discussed.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>On the oft-quoted sentence from Shoghi Effendi: "Divorced from the <b>institution</b> of the Guardianship ..." (emphasis added), this <i>does not</i> logically support the position that the individual is inseparable from the institution as it does not discuss the individual serving, but the institution and the hereditary principle behind it. If the Remeyite position is characterized as relying on this, then that's perfectly legitimate. But it <i>can not</i> be characterized as proving the point. This page deserves the opportunity for each side to succinctly present its case.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>On the Baha'i side, quotations will be needed that demonstrate that the various institutions exist outside the individuals serving on any of them; e.g. the station "Manifestation of God" exists whether or not Baha'u'llah is here or not.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Totally aside, could we remove the Baha'i template? Seems POV on this particular page. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMARussellPESE_d65e.html" title="User:MARussellPESE">MARussellPESE</a> 16:09, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I believe the following quote is relevant for the section "Roles of the Guardian and the Universal House of Justice" because it addresses both issues of the guardianship and the elected body of the UHJ:</p>
<dl>
<dd>By this House is meant the Universal House of Justice, that is, in all countries a secondary House of Justice must be instituted, and these secondary Houses of Justice must elect the members of the Universal one. Unto this body all things must be referred. It enacteth all ordinances and regulations that are not to be found in the explicit Holy Text. By this body all the difficult problems are to be resolved and the Guardian of the Cause of God is its sacred head and the distinguished member for life of that body. Should he not attend in person its deliberations, he must appoint one to represent him. Should any of the members commit a sin, injurious to the common weal, the Guardian of the Cause of God hath at his own discretion the right to expel him, whereupon the people must elect another one in his stead. This House of Justice enacteth the laws and the government enforceth them. The legislative body must reinforce the executive, the executive must aid and assist the legislative body so that through the close union and harmony of these two forces, the foundation of fairness and justice may become firm and strong, that all the regions of the world may become even as Paradise itself. (Will and Testament, pp. 14,15)</dd>
</dl>
<p>If Wikipedia is a place for different views to be expressed in a neutral way so that the reader can come to their own conclusions, then I don't see how the above quote can be excluded from this section. What are the reasons to exclude this quote? <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavecornell_8e4d.html" title="User:Davecornell">Davecornell</a> 16:28, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Beynd being excessively wordy — which editing could take care of — this doesn't identify the Guardianship with the individual. Note that `Abdul-Bahá is referring to the Guardian as the institution, not to Shoghi Effendi himself.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>We're not going to convince each other here, but we can keep each other from editorializing into the article things that the documents don't actually say. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMARussellPESE_d65e.html" title="User:MARussellPESE">MARussellPESE</a> 17:27, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>In relation to the flow of the article, its relevant points are that the Guardian and the House of Justice are distinctly different (already covered in WOB), that the Guardian can expel members of the House of Justice (not entirely relevant, point can be added in-text), and you think `Abdu'l-Baha is suggesting that literally every single country must have an NSA before the House can be elected.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>To the last point, besides its obvious logical fallacy, the quote simply says that in the future every country should have an NSA (National House of Justice), and that the Universal House of Justice is elected by all the NSA's of the world, two separate points. Not to mention its contradicted by Shoghi Effendi's plans that the ten year crusade would be followed by a series of plans under the House of Justice, and for someone that wrote in incredible detail about the most minute details of the administration, Shoghi Effendi never mentioned this requirement. And if you read on in the Will, `Abdu'l-Baha makes another statement which clarifies that the election is from all countries in which Baha'is are found.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"By this House is meant that Universal House of Justice which is to be elected from all countries, that is from <b>those parts in the East and West where the loved ones are to be found</b>, after the manner of the customary elections in Western countries such as those of England." (`Abdu'l-Baha, The Will and Testament, p. 19)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>More importantly, Shoghi Effendi said:
<dl>
<dd>"...the establishment of the Supreme House of Justice is in no way dependent upon the adoption of the Bahá'í Faith by the mass of the peoples of the world, nor does it presuppose its acceptance by the majority of the inhabitants of any one country. <b>In fact, 'Abdu'l-Bahá, Himself, in one of His earliest Tablets, contemplated the possibility of the formation of the Universal House of Justice in His own lifetime</b>, and but for the unfavorable circumstances prevailing under the Turkish regime, would have, in all probability, taken the preliminary steps for its establishment. It will be evident, therefore, that given favorable circumstances, under which the Bahá'ís of Persia and of the adjoining countries under Soviet rule, may be enabled to elect their national representatives, in accordance with the guiding principles laid down in 'Abdu'l-Bahá's writings, the only remaining obstacle in the way of the definite formation of the International House of Justice will have been removed." (Shoghi Effendi, The World Order of Baha'u'llah, p. 7)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>See also:
<dl>
<dd>"With these Assemblies, local as well as national, harmoniously, vigorously, and efficiently functioning throughout the Bahá'í world, <b>the only means for the establishment of the Supreme House of Justice will have been secured</b>. And when this Supreme Body will have been properly established, it will have to consider afresh the whole situation, and lay down the principle which shall direct, so long as it deems advisable, the affairs of the Cause.(Shoghi Effendi, Baha'i Administration, p. 40)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>And of course:
<dl>
<dd>" '<b>At whatever time</b> all the beloved of God in each country appoint their delegates, and these in turn elect their representatives, and these representatives elect a body, that body shall be regarded as the Supreme Baytu'l-'Adl (Universal House of Justice).' " (`Abdu'l-Baha quoted in Shoghi Effendi, Baha'i Administration, p. 84)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>One more, dated 1941:
<dl>
<dd>"At this time when the National Assemblies in the Cause are not yet functioning sufficiently or fully representative of all the various important elements within it, and when some of the Bahá'ís are not even free to practise their faith, despite their numbers, it is quite impracticable to seek to establish the Universal House of Justice. <b>Whenever conditions permit</b>, it will be established.

<p>The reason I thought the above quote should be included is that it talks about the relationship between the guardian and the Universal House of Justice which is the subject of this section. I would be fine with just the following from the Will and Testament:</p>
<dl>
<dd>By this House is meant the Universal House of Justice....Unto this body all things must be referred. It enacteth all ordinances and regulations that are not to be found in the explicit Holy Text. By this body all the difficult problems are to be resolved and the Guardian of the Cause of God is its sacred head and the distinguished member for life of that body. Should he not attend in person its deliberations, he must appoint one to represent him. Should any of the members commit a sin, injurious to the common weal, the Guardian of the Cause of God hath at his own discretion the right to expel him, whereupon the people must elect another one in his stead.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Personally this discussion seems more fitting for the <a href="../../../u/n/i/Universal_House_of_Justice_dedd.html" title="Universal House of Justice">Universal House of Justice</a> page rather than Baha'i Divisions. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavecornell_8e4d.html" title="User:Davecornell">Davecornell</a> 21:45, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Actually, I don't think this really adds new material. The WOB selection is really thorough in defining the relationship between these institutions. And it doesn't address the key question of institution vs. individual. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMARussellPESE_d65e.html" title="User:MARussellPESE">MARussellPESE</a> 19:15, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>"...the Guardian of the Cause of God is its [the UHJ's] sacred head and the distinguished <b>member</b> for life of that body."</dd>
</dl>
<p>If we're talking about members who sit on the UHJ and the Guardian is one of those members, to me this says it's an individual, not an institution, that's to be at its head. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavecornell_8e4d.html" title="User:Davecornell">Davecornell</a> 20:04, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This is not meant to sidetrack here, but the BUPC (and the rest of Remey's followers, FTM) have a basic belief about all this Guardian/true UHJ stuff, and if I may, I'd like to cut to the chase of it. We believe the IBC with Mason should have by all accounts assumed control of the Faith, and was the legitimate UHJ in it's infant (1st stage) state. That body's authority was usurped (we believe) by the Hands who took control of the situation. Mason said why he went along with them, and yet that's not reflected, only that he signed the declarations, blah blah blah. Now there's a UHJ that didnt go through the specifically stated stages, didn't evolve from the IBC, etc. There's no Guardian as it's president; a clear stipulation in the Will (I know, debateable, I get it). We'd like to have all this reflected as a notable contradiction (that we see) into this page. All attempts to write this in have been sabotaged. There is now ample say from the Haifans as to why we are all so full of it, and confused. But, as we can show that this is what we believe, I contend that it should be in the page. The issue of our beliefs about the first IBC being usurped is not in the page, and to make specific allegations in the BUPC section have been squashed time and again. There are two sides to each of these issues, and yet this page is completely dominated by only one of them. Of all places, this should be the one where this issues surrounding these matters are presented equally. Where can we find peace with this? <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffmichaud_1ead.html" title="User:Jeffmichaud">Jeff</a> 09:11, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think we all need to leave this article alone for a bit while the discussion's going on. I think it was bad form to yank the template without any more discussion than my raising the question.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Jeff, your edit on Jensen's "sign" in the BUPC section is unverifiable as it stands. Please correct the link and provide a page number. (I really want to see one. That's a huge article.) I'm <i>sorely</i> tempted to remove it as unverifiable. (Probably why Cunado did.) If this supports all the Remeyite groups' opinions shouldn't it go in the CMR section? If it's the BUPC's, isn't that already covered there making it redundant here?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I think the CMR section is quite clear on his attitudes viz. the Hands and rest of the community. He's clear that he thinks the Hands were wrong, and that he commanded obedience. It quotes him directly and specifically to the point, so how could it be under-selling his position?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Also, this view of CMR at the head of a 1st stage embryonic house isn't universally shared by all of the Remeyite groups, so I don't think you'd get it past King's followers or the Remey Society if you start quoting Jensen as a spokesman for all y'all on that point. That'd give Marangella's followers heartburn too. That's not "Haifan" censorship, it's your own painful disintegration frankly.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As you all follow CMR, you'll need to quote him and you've already got a place in the article to do it in. (The paragraph beginning "Remey went on to establish ..." would be the place.) But I can't see that saying Remey thought they usurped him adds anything new. It's already crystal clear that neither he nor any of y'all accept the Custodians or House of Justice.</dd>

<dd>We are <i>way</i> beyond <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html#Undue_weight" title="WP:NPOV">undue weight</a> already. Again there are whole suites of articles that address the various Remeyite groups' history, beliefs, sources, etc., where there's no "due weight" given to the Baha'is that outnumber y'all by orders of magnitude. Nor <i>should</i> there be. Those articles don't concern the "Haifans". But here "equal weight" is just not appropriate. That's not "Haifan censorship" either, that's Wikipedia policy. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMARussellPESE_d65e.html" title="User:MARussellPESE">MARussellPESE</a> 20:24, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Sorry about the template, didnt mean to twist anyone's panties over it. As there's 3 or 4 contributors to this page, where one pointed it out, and I agreed, it looked like a no brainer. Don't worry though, MARussell, that'll be the last time I ever agree with you on anything. I won't make that mistake again.</p>
<ol>
<li>If you'd bother to check, the diddy about the Guardian being a sign is in the introduction page to the book that is linked to; it's not a "huge article", it's a 37 chapter book that our Page 10 Publishing Trust has provided for free on that site. The URL links right to the intro. Maybe I should have quoted it to be more specific:"The Covenant-breakers did away with the executive head, replacing it with a headless monster on Mt. Carmel, and oppress their deluded followers from coming under the true House of Justice that has both the executive branch, or head, and legislative body." I was only paraphrasing in the article. Which would you prefer?</li>
<li>The reason I brought this all up, is simple. I've quoted Ministry where the Hands themselves claimed they "seized the helm of the Faith", and it's been continually removed. That's their own words. I can't (nor do I care to) speak for the other groups on this, but nowhere does this article address the BUPC's fundamental concern of why the affairs of the Faith weren't passed onto the only group with the legitimate authority to do so: the IBC. I'm sure you have a head-full of propaganda to explain it away, but so far noone has in the article. I appreciate your graciousness in allowing this verifiable belief of ours to remain in our section, and I challenge y'all to answer to it. Explaining that the Hands (who like on a body cease to exist once the head dies) took this and that action only goes half way to the core of this particular concern. It's a glaringly obvious violation of the Covenant to usurp powers like this, and just because the magnitude of sheep went along with it doesn't make it right.</li>
<li>Your refutation of our groups is lacking in specific ways, and I intend to point them out in the article, so be prepared. One: you're lying to say that the UHJ was set up according to Effendi's instructions, as he specifically instructed that the IBC would "efflourence" into the UHJ, which it wasn't allowed to do; yet you claim this "election" was following the plan of the 10 year crusade-LIE. The 10 year Crusade involved the IBC becoming the UHJ. Two: your administration has no executive branch and yet makes no attempt to answer to this violation. Three: no writings about the adminstration ever make room for a lack of an excutive branch-in every case they are to work in close union with one another. Omissions of facts are the same a lying. <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffmichaud_1ead.html" title="User:Jeffmichaud">Jeff</a> 08:14, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I could care less what your indoctrinators filled your head with to engage in debates with, I'm challenging you to attempt to address these obvious ommissions in the article. I already know what your responses to these things will be, smarty pants. Does this look like my first rodeo? I'm "challenging" you to address them in the article, not here. They are the crux issues. None of the groups object what the Will says, but y'all have filled this article with your interpretations of the Will and the Writings, and act as if it's NPOV. These crux issues are not in the article. This article doesn't give an honest view of why these groups broke away by omitting and censoring these concerns which are legitimate questions to ask of a Faith that waves the Independant Investigation flag, and yet attacks anyone who questions the authority of these phony institutions. And you clowns are contributing to it. If there's nothing to hide, then what's your problem? <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffmichaud_1ead.html" title="User:Jeffmichaud">Jeff</a> 09:25, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Jeff, it's precisely <i>becuase</i> there are several editors here at the same time that there are no no-brainer edits.</p>
<p>I'm asking for page numbers from <i>everybody</i>. You don't want to slog through <i>Ministry</i> looking for a specific passage any more than I want to slog through <i>Over the Wall</i>. Please observe the <i>exhaustive</i> citations on the Bahá'í material. It's not just Chicago Manual of Style, it's courteous to each other and the readers.</p>
<p>Please refer to <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>. This isn't a place for debate. If we wanted to paste everything ever written and note every last objection, then we might as well post all of Taherzadeh, <i>Ministry</i>, <i>Revelation of Baha'u'llah</i>, you'd reproduce <i>Over the Wall</i>; and we'd all go on <i>ad nauseum</i>. I confined my specifics to two items: the Hands ratification and the possibility of a "Headless" House. These address specific, key, points in Remey's arguments; and are intended to be illustrative, not exhaustive. They do, in fact, address the "four stage plan" argument frankly. If you feel these are <i>not</i> amply clarified, see what you can do; but expanding the debate much beyond that gets into <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>.</p>
<p>Again, you have plenty of real estate to make BUPC-specific arguments. This page isn't the place for that level of detail for the reasons I've already noted: <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html#Undue_weight" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV#Undue weight</a> and that the BUPC is not the only successor group with an opinion, and they differ from yours.</p>
<p>As an aside, <b>at no time</b> did the Hands collectively or the Custodians claim that they'd "seized the helm of their faith". The only place anything like that expression is to be found is in the preface to <i>Ministry</i> and reads: "[the Custodians] found themselves called upon to seize the helm of their Faith, protect it from dissolution and schism, ..." (p. xix). This isn't authoritative as it's Ruhiyyih Khanum's personal opinion and is explicitly in the context of preserving the plan (which was their job) and responding to Remey's actions (also their job). If you want to add this, it'll need to be in that context. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMARussellPESE_d65e.html" title="User:MARussellPESE">MARussellPESE</a> 15:59, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Jeffmichaud says that the crux of the argument is 1) why didn't power go to the IBC? 2) why was a the House elected without becoming a court first? 3) why is there no executive branch with the House of Justice in Haifa? The true crux of the argument is that Shoghi Effendi died without having appointed a successor Guardian, as he couldn't have without going outside of the guidelines set for him in `Abdu'l-Baha's Will. What to do next?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>1) Why would the power go to the IBC? According to Mason Remey, he was the Guardian after Shoghi Effendi, so authority should have gone to him, not the IBC. Otherwise the Faith under Shoghi Effendi would have been incorrectly set up. According to the logic of your question, the authority of the Faith under Shoghi Effendi was vested in the IBC with Mason Remey as president. In addition, <b>if</b> the IBC has the Guardian as its president, then Shoghi Effendi should have been the president of the IBC set up in 1951. And as a follow up, where in any writings does it say that the headship of the Faith should be given to an appointed IBC? The nature of the question is suggesting a reference to the real question: who should have authority in the absence of the Guardian? Your suggestion that it should be the IBC is contradictory with your idea that Mason Remey was the Guardian.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>2) Becoming recognized as a court is a reference to the Israeli system in which each religious community in Israel is organized in their own governmental system, even though they live in overlapping geographical areas. Even today in Jerusalem Jews and Arabs have a completely segregated police and fire systems. Two neighbours, one Jewish and one Arab, will call different police organizations when they need help, and they will go to different court sytems. Muslims, Christians, Jews, Druze, and others all have their own system. Shoghi Effendi wanted to establish a Baha'i system in Israel. This part of the plan was completely external to the Baha'i administration, in other words it was dependent upon non-Baha'i entities. In practice this step became impossible and impracticle, and instead of letting the entire administration collapse as a result of non-Baha'i requirements, they decided to go straight to the next stage: an elected body. Nowhere does Shoghi Effendi say that the House <b>cannot</b> be elected without the IBC becoming a court.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>3) This answer is simple. There is an appointed/executive branch of the administration. The Hands of the Cause and the House of Justice all collaborated to create the Institution of the Counselors, which has at its head nine appointed individuals (like the custodians), with each of 80+ counselors appointing auxiliaries, which appoint assistants to work at local levels. More importantly, just as Shoghi Effendi never made legislation and worked within his sphere of jurisdiction by not appointing a Guardian outside of the requirements of the W&amp;T, the House of Justice has continued to not perform interpretive functions and has worked within its defined sphere of jurisdcition by enacting legislation on matters not explicitly defined in the text, including the situation in which all male descendants of Baha'u'llah have been excommunicated.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>And yet there are uncountable issues that are not addressed by Mason Remey's followers. Then comes the enormous deceptions that Jensen introduced. But like I said, this is not a place for debate amongst ourselves. Bottom line: the article page is for verifiable facts, and your edits to date have been extremely poor referenced and largely irrelevant from the real crux of the issues. <a href="../../../c/u/n/User%7ECunado19_ff71.html" title="User:Cunado19"><font color="#D14C04"><b>Cuñado</b></font></a> <a href="http://www.bahai.us/" class="external text" title="http://www.bahai.us/" rel="nofollow"></a><a href="../../../b/a/h/Image%7EBahaitemplatestar.png_81d9.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/1/1d/Bahaitemplatestar.png/20px-Bahaitemplatestar.png" alt="" width="20" height="19" longdesc="../../../b/a/h/Image%7EBahaitemplatestar.png_81d9.html" /></a> - <a href="../../../c/u/n/User_talk%7ECunado19_98ea.html" title="User talk:Cunado19"><font size="-3">Talk</font></a> 17:58, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Cunado, you are so good at talking in circles without actually saying anything. I've only seen this level of skill once or twice. I thought I mentioned not to bother trying to convince me here. Just because you can convinces yourself so you can sleep at night was not what I am looking for. I'd like to add these matters to the article:</p>
<ol>
<li>Specifically I think the 1951 cablegram that announces the formation of the IBC is worth mentioning as he points out that it was this body that was to "efflourence" into the UHJ, and that it was this body that Effendi aticipated becoming the UHJ.</li>
<li>The institution of the Councellors is not a body recognized anywhere in the Covenant; we have Hands creating a Head which is specifically why we feel it's operating outside the Covenant.</li>
<li>Quote from the Will that the guardian is the "sacred head and member for life" of the Body.</li>
</ol>
<p>None of these answers are simple, except if you're a simpleton. Just because y'all find it easy to dismiss these matters, they are the very reasons for the schism, which is not simple or trite. This page, which should be explaining the divisions is filled with non-essentials about the specific groups, without getting specific about these things. <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffmichaud_1ead.html" title="User:Jeffmichaud">Jeff</a> 18:42, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Ok, apparently it needs saying here too: Jeff, <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECivil_1ef2.html" title="WP:Civil">please be civil</a>. "Twisting panties", "smarty pants", "simpleton", etc., drag the whole tone down.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Each of your three points are well-known BUPC positions. (I presume your second point you meant "Custodians", not "Councellors".) All you'll have to do is demonstrate that these are universal positions for all the Remeyite groups. Unfortunately, I think that'll be hard (Because I think Jensen is the author of all these interpretations.); but please see what you can do.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>This article can't possibly deal with each and every groups' unique posistions. There just isn't room. It appears you want to dominate it with your BUPC perspective, which, for the third time, Jeff, <i>you have ample space</i> to do so on your group's various articles.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>On your three points: all three are asked-and-answered in <i>Ministry</i>, and clarified in various letters from the House of Justice; but I don't want to drag all of those out for the same space considerations that I think apply to all the Remeyite groups. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMARussellPESE_d65e.html" title="User:MARussellPESE">MARussellPESE</a> 19:18, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As I said, I would answer those points if it contributes to the article. I was planning on adding things to the article, but I can't do everything at once.</p>
<p>The House's job is to create legislation as circumstances require, to bring flexibility for just such circumstances. The quote about the "member for life" is irrelevant to the discussion. It does not address the situation in which there is no Guardian. <a href="../../../c/u/n/User%7ECunado19_ff71.html" title="User:Cunado19"><font color="#D14C04"><b>Cuñado</b></font></a> <a href="http://www.bahai.us/" class="external text" title="http://www.bahai.us/" rel="nofollow"></a><a href="../../../b/a/h/Image%7EBahaitemplatestar.png_81d9.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/1/1d/Bahaitemplatestar.png/20px-Bahaitemplatestar.png" alt="" width="20" height="19" longdesc="../../../b/a/h/Image%7EBahaitemplatestar.png_81d9.html" /></a> - <a href="../../../c/u/n/User_talk%7ECunado19_98ea.html" title="User talk:Cunado19"><font size="-3">Talk</font></a> 19:22, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>What about citing the "sacred head and member for life" quote and then say the Haifa viewpoint that "they believe this to be irrelevant because it does not address the situation in which there is no Guardian" or something to that effect?</dd>
</dl>

<dd>Also regarding Cunado's statement:</dd>

<dl>

<dl>
<dd>"There is an appointed/executive branch of the administration.

</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Is that verifiable, that the Institution of the Counselors with its nine appointed individuals is considered the executive of the Faith, or is that an opinion?

<p>Dear friends,</p>
<p>Most of those arguing here accept the authority of the Master and the Guardianship of Shoghi Effendi, and do not dispute their authority to command. Also, the various participants here represent differing views of succession, and therefore are, to each other, Covenant-Breakers. If we all believe in the above two, why are we actually engaging in debate over the details of the Covenant, which Shoghi Effendi asked us not to do.</p>
<p>The Master asked us not to associate with Covenant-Breakers, with Shoghi Effendi allowing for doing business with Covenant-Breakers, as long as we keep to the "business at hand" and do not get into discussions attempting to convince each other. While I am not perfect in this regard, please let us not enter into such debates, in deference and obedience to the Master whom we all love, and to Shoghi Effendi who holds our deepest respect and admiration. The tones of such debates, even beyond their basic impermissibility, cannot but fall into angry condemnation - especially when they are quickly replied-to and given from a place of frustration.</p>
<p>There are plenty of articles that present the views of the participants. These cross-over articles where we all intersect need to be in summary form to encapsulate the argument, allowing for the reader to link through the main articles for details. Please don't respond to this comment with "but he's wrong" or "all I meant to say was...". I don't care. I'm not paying attention, not even to the arguments that I agree with. I'm putting this out there as one who loves Abd'ul-Baha and Baha'u'llah, and would dearly love to see us not make fools of Them, nor act out of a hostile spirit. I am not immune from my own criticism. I have posted more than one comment out of frustration or irritation. I'm personally vowing to stop it - right here, right now, and throwing down the gauntlet to all who claim to love Baha'u'llah.</p>
<p>I propose a small timeout. Take three days and make no edits, re-think the article in the context of summarization of the divergence, with detailed pages on specific beliefs linked to in main templates. This is standard wiki style, good form, and should allow us to stop actually interacting EXCEPT around the specific business of making good wiki articles. We should not, either by Wikipedia policy, nor by Abd'ul-Baha's policies, be interacting with each other in an apologetic fashion. That statement is true whether we are obedient to the Universal House of Justice in Haifa, Neal Chase, sIBC, Joel Marangella, or any other claimant to Baha'u'llah's Faith's leadership. We may not think each other are Baha'is, but we believe we are, ourselves, Baha'is. In that case, we should act like Baha'is.</p>

<p>I couldn't fit it all in an edit summary, so I'll explain here.

The section was about a break in the line of Guardians, and he expanded on the comment that "Mason Remey and his successors asserted that a living Guardian is essential for the Bahá'í community, and that the Bahá'í Writings required it." by adding the quote about the Guardian being the head and member for life of the House of Justice.</p>
<p>The roles of the Guardianship and the House are already clearly defined by Shoghi Effendi himself on the page. The quote about the Guardian being a member of the House of Justice is not really relevant to any of the arguments on the page.

<dd>Dave, I don't think the "head for life" concept is part of all the Remeyite groups' doctrine. Could you please identify either a direct statement of Remey's, or other sources. I'd have to agree with Cunado's removal unless there is something that says this is universal. Remey's declaration, which is his clearest statement, does not address this. If the "head for life" doctrine is Jensen's innovation, then it belongs in the BUPC articles.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>If, and I'd really like to see some documentation on that, this is, in fact shared by all the Remeyite groups, then that is a good place for it. It raises the question, in the context of "belief" that the House then answers. This would enhance the article, again, if the belief is more than the BUPC's.</dd>

<dd>Dave, the quote is not "the basis for the modern-day Baha'i Division". Awhile ago the "crux of the issue", according to Jeff, was 1) why didn't power go to the IBC? 2) why was the House elected without becoming a court first? 3) why is there no executive branch with the House of Justice in Haifa?</dd>

<dd>All these are sidenotes to the real issue, which is Remey's claim to being the Guardian. I'm not even sure how to respond to your proposal that it all hangs on this quote from the W&amp;T. This seems to be your personal opinion. The role/necessity of the Guardian, the Baha'i court issue, the current structure of Baha'i administration... these are all of secondary importance. You don't have free reign to define what is important and what isn't (nor do I), and this has nothing to do with a desire to suppress negativity towards the House of Justice and my own beliefs. I honestly think the quote is irrelevant and doesn't address the issues on the page. The long quote from <i>World Order</i> is relevant in that it defines the roles of the two institutions, and the "divorced from the institution of the Guardianship" was a quote that Jeff wanted to put on every page. Saying that the Guardian is a member of the House of Justice is not the same as saying that the House of Justice <b>must</b> have a Guardian as a member, which is what you are proposing to interpret it as. <a href="../../../c/u/n/User%7ECunado19_ff71.html" title="User:Cunado19"><font color="#D14C04"><b>Cuñado</b></font></a> <a href="http://www.bahai.us/" class="external text" title="http://www.bahai.us/" rel="nofollow"></a><a href="../../../b/a/h/Image%7EBahaitemplatestar.png_81d9.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/1/1d/Bahaitemplatestar.png/20px-Bahaitemplatestar.png" alt="" width="20" height="19" longdesc="../../../b/a/h/Image%7EBahaitemplatestar.png_81d9.html" /></a> - <a href="../../../c/u/n/User_talk%7ECunado19_98ea.html" title="User talk:Cunado19"><font size="-3">Talk</font></a> 22:30, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>That section appears to be a catch-all for anybody who's ever had a <i>personal</i> gripe with mainstream Baha'i administration. The numbers of people involved in say the Talisman episode (about a dozen if memory serves) is an order of magnitude or more less than the total number of followers in the various Remey successor groups. Talk about undue weight. There're even notes of individuals (Sen McGlinn, Allison Marshall, etc.) whose ideas/activities never raised a ripple in the mainstream community.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>However, no mainstream Baha'i could consign this to electronic oblivion without being blasted for bias no matter how clearly they stood on Wikipedia policies. And, having a place here does keep the other various Baha'i articles from being cluttered up with individual items.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>This whole section could be carved out into a separate article if it's not to be deleted, but it shouldn't be called "Baha'i controversies" or such. In reality, outside of those involved with Talisman and one national convention, these individuals never were part of the communities collective consciousness. Calling it "Baha'is who <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jim_Croce_a6d9.html" title="Jim Croce">messed</a> with <a href="../../../l/e/r/Leroy_Brown_0db7.html" title="Leroy Brown">Leroy Brown</a>" might actually be closer to reality, but unprofessional to say the least. Before it gets carved out, if that's consensus, could we agree to a name first? Perhaps "Conflicts with Baha'i Administration"? <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMARussellPESE_d65e.html" title="User:MARussellPESE">MARussellPESE</a> 15:19, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree with MARussellPESE that any mainstream Baha'i who deletes such a section would be blasted for bias, but really as a handful of people, they are really a very very small minority view, and non-notable for the creation of a new page.

<p>All good points MARussell. It's just always seemed akward to me that there's a conclusion, and then more about a bunch of nothing. I was just tossing the idea out there in case anyone else felt the same way and hadn't mentioned it. Juan Cole has his page with no less than fifty other pages linking to it. His Talismam site is all but dead. And, as has been noted, these are personal gripes which never amounted to anything. But, if there needs to be a drainage ditch, this is as good a place as any. <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffmichaud_1ead.html" title="User:Jeffmichaud">Jeff</a> 05:38, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I do not know if a "drainage ditch" is a derogatory term, but for me the point is not whether Baha'is should have a place in Wikipedia to keep a list of splits within their ranks, but whether the page is informative to common users about historical or existing divisions among those who call themselves Baha'is. I do not think that individual issues need to be described and considered, only as long as those issues generate a wider response or a real split in the movement. Apart from historical divisions in the founder's family, real schism seems to have occurred mainly around Shoghi Effendi's succession. Talisman, even though it is not a schism <i>per se</i>, is indeed a noteworthy issue because the mailing list has so many members and is a reference point for many people, including scholars. Other individual situations may not reach the sufficient amount of impact in the wider Baha'i or Religious Studies world to be really worthy of quoting them here. --<a href="../../../j/d/e/User%7EJdemarcos_a961.html" title="User:Jdemarcos">Jdemarcos</a> 23:09, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I wonder about Talisman's notability. Anybody know what its total membership size was? If memory serves the total number of people dis-affected was less than a dozen. That's <i>really</i> small, even for a small religious community like the Baha'is.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The only effect I observed it having on the wider Baha'i community was at one U.S. National Convention, and that really only rose to the level of scuttlebut shared among the delegates/attendees. <i>I</i> only know of it because I knew a Talisman participant. I didn't even hear of the ripple effect at Convention till the following year.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>What's irritating, personally, about that episode, and other people patterning their conflicts with it, is the systematic attempt to portray Baha'i administration as a bunch of storm-troopers who pervasively goose-step all over academics, intellectuals and free-thinkers. I can't begin to count the number of academics and intellectuals I know personally, much less by reputation, who've never — ever — run into the kind of treatment the Talisman participants assert was/is pervasive. The individuals involved were/are very vocal, to say the least, but were really a tiny minority of a sub-set of Baha'i academics who happened to subscribe to a particualar mailing list. And that people have a diferent opinion on subjects of Cole's research than Cole himself should come as a shock to nobody. So, maybe, leaving it here is in fact a positive thing. But I'm still interested in considering its notability. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMARussellPESE_d65e.html" title="User:MARussellPESE">MARussellPESE</a> 21:25, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

If there is a disagreement as to how this is interpreted, well, that's the name of this article - "Baha'i Divisions". I think if each group wants to cite sources for their interpretation of what this means in the appropriate part of the page, that's their right.

<p>I believe part of the reason this article has been so difficult to work on over the past 8+ months is there is no agreement by the editors on its purpose. In the first paragraph it reads</p>
<dl>
<dd>"Bahá'í divisions deals with the various succession challenges in the history of the religion, and the major arguments on each side."</dd>
</dl>
<p>In my opinion, the keys are a "history" of the "various succession challenges" and their "arguments". This means that it should be focused on historical evidence and not who is right or wrong. This has been the purpose behind my last several edits including the overhaul in the Mason Remey section. If the editors agree to focus on historical evidence for the different claims of succession, this article could get wrapped up sooner rather than later.</p>
<p>If the contributors can agree on the purpose, it would be easier to tell what is acceptable material and what is unacceptable. If we can't agree, then I guess it continues as is.</p>
<p>I realize part of the criticism of this article is its length. If the focus is on succession of the various groups listed, it would shorten the article significantly. Edited material could go to the group's main page or eliminated altogether if it's a duplicate. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavecornell_8e4d.html" title="User:Davecornell">Davecornell</a> 02:35, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Dave, you began a major rewrite of a controversial article that had been stable for four months without adding any prior discussion. You removed material that was clearly sourced; removed bona-fide, but inconvenient, sources and points; and added material without citing sources.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>To wit:
<ul>
<li>You <i>twice</i> removed sourced quotes that CMR had assumed for himself "status for life as commander in chief of Bahá’í affairs of the world" and that he'd "assumed command" <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bah%C3%A1%27%C3%AD_divisions&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=78688818" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bah%C3%A1%27%C3%AD_divisions&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=78688818" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> &amp; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bah%C3%A1%27%C3%AD_divisions&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=78791175" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bah%C3%A1%27%C3%AD_divisions&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=78791175" rel="nofollow">[3]</a></li>
<li>You conveniently ellipsed out this: "I expect them to accept me without question as their Commander-in-Chief in all Bahá'í matters and to follow me so long as I live for I am the Guardian of the Faith—the Infallible Guardian of the Bahá'í Faith." from your selection off page 7 of the proclamation.</li>
<li>You removed the reference to the W&amp;T as the source document for the Guardian as the sacred head of the House <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bah%C3%A1%27%C3%AD_divisions&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=78688818" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bah%C3%A1%27%C3%AD_divisions&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=78688818" rel="nofollow">[4]</a></li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>You're asserting that your edits constitute focusing on the historical evidence?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Please note CMR used the term "command" or "commander" <i>twelve</i> times with respect to himself in this one letter — something neither `Abdul-Baha nor Shoghi Effendi did in over 65 years of their collective terms of service. Who ever heard either <i>ever</i> say: "I expect them to accept me without question as their Commander-in-Chief"? And his reference to his due "perquisites and emoluments" is apalling considering the deprivations the Central Figures and Shoghi Effendi endured. I'd be more than happy to block-quote each and every reference, but if you can leave these key ones alone, I won't need to pile on.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If one one would argue that that his references to "command" are not relevant to his thinking about his successorship, well: that dog won't hunt. His whole argument revolves around it. He uses the term repeatedly, even putting it in Shoghi Effendi's mouth. He used it six times in the last two pages alone.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Sorry Dave I don't trust your intentions here. You added "citation needed" <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bah%C3%A1%27%C3%AD_divisions&amp;diff=78490454&amp;oldid=78461732" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bah%C3%A1%27%C3%AD_divisions&amp;diff=78490454&amp;oldid=78461732" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> and then ripped it out as "POV" within <i>hours</i> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bah%C3%A1%27%C3%AD_divisions&amp;diff=78688818&amp;oldid=78602911" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bah%C3%A1%27%C3%AD_divisions&amp;diff=78688818&amp;oldid=78602911" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> when someone added it. Very bad form. It's astounding for you to remove citations after you, yourself, asked for them.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>One reason this article is as long as it is, is that the Baha'is have be reticent about removing opposing opinions or inconvenient points. Something you seem to have no problem with.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The Baha'i editors have presumed that each side would present the rigorously sourced facts as we see them for the reader's benefit. You've carved up, excised, and spun extant quotes, and then are asking why we can't get consensus? Remarkable. Seems very unlikely that you're really interested in a fair presentation of the facts. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMARussellPESE_d65e.html" title="User:MARussellPESE">MARussellPESE</a> 04:40, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Do you agree that the purpose is to document “the major arguments” regarding succession? To me, major arguments means the evidence provided by the one(s) making their claim to be the successor or head of the faith. What does it mean to you?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Based on this reasoning, that is why I deleted the “command” quotes. Even though sourced, they have nothing to do with Mason Remey’s claim. In other words, he didn’t use these “command” quotes as evidence for succession. He based his claim to the Guardianship on his appointment as President of the IBC. That’s why I cited the quote I did from his proclamation:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>”The Beloved Guardian chose me to be the President of the Bahá'í International Council that is according to his explanation the President of the Embrionic Universal House of Justice. Therefore I am the President of the Embrionic Universal House of Justice. When this August body becomes the Universal House of Justice, if such being during my lifetime, I will then be the President of the First Universal House of Justice of the Bahá'í Dispensation.” (<a href="http://www.charlesmasonremey.net/1960_proclamation.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.charlesmasonremey.net/1960_proclamation.htm" rel="nofollow">Remey’s proclamation</a>, p. 6)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>As far as adding the elipsis, the deleted text was not part of Remey’s argument for succession, in my opinion, so I removed it for brevity.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>While on the subject of evidence, I believe the following quote should be considered for the article since Remey also made reference to it in his diaries:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>”This is the only position suggestive of authority that Shoghi Effendi ever bestowed upon anyone, the only special and specific appointment of authority to any man ever made by him.” (<a href="http://www.charlesmasonremey.net/1960_proclamation.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.charlesmasonremey.net/1960_proclamation.htm" rel="nofollow">Remey’s proclamation</a>, p. 2)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Regarding your comments about me removing the Remey quotes because I consider it convenient and suiting my purposes, as you can see from my above reasoning that’s a false assumption on your part. But based on your aversion to Remey’s use of the word “command”, I can see how you reached the conclusion you did. But if we can agree the question is “Was Remey using these quotes as an argument for his claim?” then they don't belong, in my opinion.</dd>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>“Remey's reasoning was that since, according to Bahá'í scripture, the Guardian is the ‘sacred head and distinguished member for life’ (W&amp;T)”</dd>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>This is attributed to Remey, but as far as I know there is no evidence he used the “sacred head” quote as part of his claim. I know that Leland Jensen used it when referring to Remey and that’s probably why I was so attached to using it earlier in the article. The reference probably belongs in the BUPC section unless someone can find a source attributed to Remey.</dd>

<dd>It has been stated in the past that this article has gotten too long and after re-reading it, I agree plus it doesn't flow well. If we can reach agreement as to the purpose of this article, it would make it a lot easier for all editors involved. If I have a major edit to suggest in the future, I’ll bring it up here first. If I don’t get a response after a reasonable wait, I’ll assume it’s acceptable and I’ll insert it in the main article. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavecornell_8e4d.html" title="User:Davecornell">Davecornell</a> 01:42, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As far as formatting, using the &lt;blockquote&gt; tags made it look strange to me, while {{cquote}} made it look nicer. I changed the tags back, since the rest of the article uses them also.</p>
<p>I reduced some of the redundant quotes about "commander" as mentioned above.

<dd>It's better. I still don't see the purpose of mentioning Mason's desire to have his proclamation read in Wilmette, especially when it never took place, much less citing a quote from him saying that. It makes more sense to leave it as: "On 8 April, 1960, Remey publicly announced that he was the second Guardian of the Bahá'í Faith in a (written) proclamation." I think the only reason there's a desire to keep it the way it is is because Mason refers to himself as the "commander in chief" again. But I still think it has nothing to do with his argument to be Guardian. Plus there are three other times he's quoted later in that section using "command(er)". Even though I disagree with the purpose for using the "commander" quotes, I'd settle for leaving the last three in the section in exchange for deleting the whole reference about Wilmette. It seems pointless and irrelevant.</dd>

<dd>To understand the transition following the death of Shoghi Effendi in 1957, a background on the roles of the Guardian, the Hands of the Cause, and the Universal House of Justice is useful.

<dd>The "Criteria" and "Relationship" sub-sections should stay. CMR's claims are grounded in his readings of both of these points, which his "Proclamation" goes into at length. To neglect these in a neutral context, while going on at length with CMR's statements is POV.</dd>

<dd>These sub-sections are <i>copiously sourced</i> to documents both sides consider authoritative, and directly address CMR's various claims. I penned a good chunk of these and went out of my way to keep the points made there entirely those of the Master and the Guardian — no commentary or sources from from <i>Custodians</i>, Balyuzi, or Taherzadeh. You're about as willing to see those presented as sources on those points as I am to see Jensen.</dd>

<dd>We've not set up a straw-man here, but have tried to present a thorough picture. This article has gotten long because the Remeyite editors (Sorry if that's taken as a perjorative. Not intended. Denis MacEoin coined the expression, and I haven't seen one that's as inclusive.) haven't seemed willing to let Remey's claims be merely summarized and referenced — which <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html#Undue_weight" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV#Undue weight</a> would require. And also because the Baha'is aren't (at least I'm not) willing to let these detailed claims go unanswered. We'll have to live with the length. This is one place where both sides can present their arguments without going up-side each groups' articles — and that is, in my opinion, the purpose of this article.</dd>

<dd>"When Shoghi Effendi died in <a href="../../../1/9/5/1957.html" title="1957">1957</a>, he died without explicitly appointing a successor Guardian."</dd>
</dl>
<p>It does not need to specify that the Hands determined... It is just stating a fact that is acknowledged by everyone. Even Remey never claimed that he was appointed implicitly. In fact, he had to write a lengthy letter explaining to people his reasoning behind why he thought he was the Guardian, and that was after three years of everybody believing that nobody was appointed.</p>
<p>Also, I removed the part indicating that he died without a will. That's not entirely accurate. The requirement of Baha'u'llah in writing a will is to 1)designate inheritance of property and wealth 2)write a testament of faith. Shoghi Effendi wrote extensively, and effectively did not own anything. He was required to appoint a successor during his lifetime, so a will for that purpose was not necessary. The point is, I chose to remove the mention of the absence of a will, rather than add another paragraph about it.

<p>The conclusion contains a number of non-issues, in my opinion. The Bahá'í Faith has long envisioned the possibility for temporary challenges to its leadership. The point its sacred literature makes is that the break-offs will never be permanent (or significant). So, the other supposed arguments (which are not present in Bahá'í literature and are easily knocked down as valid arguments) are just red herrings. To take one example from Shoghi Effendi's writings, "A schism, a permanent cleavage in the vast body of its adherents, they could never create." <a href="http://bahai-library.com/writings/shoghieffendi/wob/53.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://bahai-library.com/writings/shoghieffendi/wob/53.html" rel="nofollow">[8]</a> I thus propose removing several paragraphs that go on with pseudo-rebuttals from so-called Bahá'í sources and point out that this is really a non-issue. If there are mechanisms for expelling "Covenant-breakers", then doesn't that admit that there can be some at least temporary challenges to its leadership? <a href="../../../b/r/e/User%7EBrettz9_d368.html" title="User:Brettz9">Brettz9</a> 14:17, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I would like to remind that this article is not about how the Baha'i Faith evaluates schism in its ranks, but a list of existing or previous and now extinct divisions among people who define themselves as Baha'is. Any comment on the viability of those schisms according to the teachings of the religion belongs to the realm of the religion itself and not to the Wikipedia, which should remain <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral</a> in its approach to this (and any other) subject. --<a href="../../../j/d/e/User%7EJdemarcos_a961.html" title="User:Jdemarcos">Jdemarcos</a> 10:18, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Well, firstly, I should say that my point is that there are already criticisms on the viability of those schisms on the page (in the Conclusion), with it being implied that the Bahá'í dogma could not accept the possibility of there ever being any diversion of its membership into separate sects; this is simply not true as the quotation above should make clear (I am open to counter arguments, but I don't think anyone can provide any because in this case, it really is a non-issue as the quotation makes clear). Wikipedia is about knowledge; there are gazillions of articles on religions here at Wikipedia dealing with religious topics and describing their various points of view; the point according to Wikipedia policy (see <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_FAQ_00b9.html#Religion" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view/FAQ">Wikipedia:Neutral point of view/FAQ#Religion</a>) is that descriptions of these beliefs must remain from a neutral point of view and not side, as an article, in favor or against them. Wikipedia has no problems in making known the beliefs, positions, or rationales of various religious Faiths or denominations, as long as the article is not siding with them (read the policies again, not to mention the precedent in countless other religious articles). And, it is only reasonable that someone wishing to get a knowledge of the situation among Bahá'ís with the issue of schism would also wish to know something about its own attitudes toward the topic, especially if arguments are being described against the Bahá'í Faith's (uncited) supposed position on the issue (which I have proven with a citation not to be its actual position). Opposing views can also be described--but my point in this case is that the arguments within the Conclusion (have you read it?) are red herrings implying a criticism that has no basis; if someone actually wants to cite a source stating unequivocally that Bahá'ís believe there can be no even temporary challenges to its leadership, and thus claim that the official Bahá'í position is different from that described in the quotation I cited above (and thus challenging the Bahá'í Faith's credibility by pointing out that there have in fact been some at least temporary diversions of individuals into following their own spin-off version), then they are welcome to do so. Although the evident falsity of the present argument could warrant the first few paragraphs of the Conclusion being deleted entirely, as it seems that some have come to the conclusion that the Bahá'í Faith has this internal contradiction, then I think it is only reasonable that this belief in there being a contradiction and the official Bahá'í point of view be described as well. <a href="../../../b/r/e/User%7EBrettz9_d368.html" title="User:Brettz9">Brettz9</a> 11:16, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This seems very poorly written. Anytime a page says "Some people... " it is misleading and it's a weasel phrase that avoids providing references. I think if this movement of Baha'is resigning is important enough to mention, there should be something more here. If there's nothing to mention besides two people being expelled, then that is just irrelevant.

<p>Before we get into a revert war, a couple things. Adherents.com states two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>at least 98% of Baha'is are followers of the House in Haifa. Note the wording "at least."</li>
<li>gives numbers of the BUPC (before the split) at 1400.</li>
</ol>
<p>Another relevant statistic is the number of Baha'is who are followers of the House in Haifa, which based on published reports normally range in the 5-6 million range (let's use the 5 million number). The other divisions don't have published sources in reliable sources, so based on published reports the percentage is 99.972%. But let's go a little further and use some of the other estimates which don't have reliable sources (I'll make what I think are upper estimates, but could be way off):</p>
<ol>
<li>Orthodox Baha'is: 1000 (this number is what is regularly stated)</li>
<li>Tarbiyat Bahá'í Community: 1 community, let's say 100 (just a guess)</li>
<li>Bahá'í Loyal to the Fourth Guardian: 1000 (no published numbers or estimates, but make it equal to Orthodox Baha'is)</li>
<li>Baha'is who have left, but consider themselves Baha'is: 1000</li>
</ol>
<p>Using these numbers, the percentage would be 99.91%, which is still equivalent to what is in the article. You could add another 500 to my estimates so the number would become exactly 99.9%. Of course this latter calculation doesn't pass muster in Wikipedia, so we still back up to what the published reports are, which are 99.972%, which is stated as 99.9%.-- <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeff3000_72a5.html" title="User:Jeff3000">Jeff3000</a> 04:46, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If you really want to get into it, the insanely inflated numbers of the sans-guardian Baha'is can be called to the mat, for as Adherents.com clearly shows the numbers are from statistics going back 35+ years. The truth is that there isn't a viable number for the the sans-guardians that's current either, but noones arguing your laughable 5-6 million number cuz that's what the source says.

<dd>Jeff, there is absolutely nothing stating that any Baha'i division has more than a handful of people in 2006. Your own BUPC appears to be a tiny fractured community on the brink of extinction. The source says "at least 98%" in the Haifa group, and it does not say where the 2% come from. I should also point out that adherents.com is not a great source (and you can quote me on that), since they give numbers of Baha'is in various countries that is well over twice what the NSA's publish for those countries. Their estimate of 1400 for the BUPC comes from what appears to be a side thought of the author, saying that their real membership is probably 1% of the 144,000 that they claim. <a href="../../../c/u/n/User%7ECunado19_ff71.html" title="User:Cunado19"><font color="#AF7817"><b>Cuñado</b></font></a> <a href="../../../b/a/h/Image%7EBahaitemplatestar.png_81d9.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/1/1d/Bahaitemplatestar.png/20px-Bahaitemplatestar.png" alt="" width="20" height="19" longdesc="../../../b/a/h/Image%7EBahaitemplatestar.png_81d9.html" /></a> - <a href="../../../c/u/n/User_talk%7ECunado19_98ea.html" title="User talk:Cunado19"><font size="-3">Talk</font></a> 08:04, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Oh I'm sorry. I was under the impression that we were to use the information found in the sources we choose to include as the foundation for a statement. Is that only when it's convenient for your purposes? Unbelievable. I can't believe it's even nesseccary to waste a second on this. Great source, or not, I wasn't the one who provided it. It was already there. I checked it to see what it actually says, and what it says is nowhere close to what you all keep reverting back to. You've got nothing to stand on here. Get over it. It says what it says. If it said anything like .1%, then it would be a non-issue.</p>
<p>It doesn't say where the other 2% comes from? You're grasping at air Cunado. It's the only objective source that was provided, and you all are being hypocrites by changing what it actually says and trying to justify it. All this reasoning of yours doesn't mean diddly on this one. Both versions give enormously small statistics and satisfy the point that the divisions groups are teeny weeny compared to the vastly enormously powerful empire of the sans-guardians, so why the big nothing over this? I'm only suggesting that the statement reflect what the source actually says.

<dd>Wikipedia allows for statistics to be combined in mathematical calculations from sources and stated in articles, and that is what is being done. There are no estimates of any Baha'i division except for the Haifan Baha'is and the BUPC (before the split). As for the statistics of the Haifan Baha'is, there are tons of references that even point to more than 5 million, and these come highly reputable sources including Encyclopaedia Brittanica, but I was conservative and used a lower estimate. -- <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeff3000_72a5.html" title="User:Jeff3000">Jeff3000</a> 14:29, 24 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Also note, that that the "at least 98%" from adherents.com also contains the Babi/Azali/Bayani populations (which based on Encyclopedia Brittanica "number no more than a few thousand").

<p>I didn't really expect a surge of resistence over such a small thing, but whatever; here we are. I would love to see the policy you seem so sure about that says you can make up numbers when none are available. That is exactly what you're doing, and it's just not the way things work. Of course you can combine numbers from sources, but you admittedly have no sources to draw from for these groups, so you are by all accounts just making them up, aren't you? Adherts.com is mentioned in the previous sentence, with the actual statistic conveniently left out, and the following sentence which links to the same source has a fabricated number. You can't just make things up, especially when it comes to a half a dozen separate groups for which you know nothing about.

<p>This is absolutely negligable on your part Jeff30000000. I've already said all there is to say. YOU HAVE NO PUBLISHED SOURCES! So, your logical deductions aren't logical at all. These numbers that you're tossing around are fabrications of your imagination. You have no idea what the populations of any Babi group or division group is by your own admission. Your making these numbers up based on assumptions. All of your bable about these wiki-guidelines is inane, inane, inane! They have nothing to do with this. Nowhere can you justify this .1% statement with anything verifiable. That source in no way verifies the statement it's linked to. You're assumption is that Adherents.com attributed 1.9% of the 2 to being Babi's. Where is that coming from? The same place your other numbers came from: thin air.</p>
<p>I've tried to reword this four different ways, and you have the nerve to warn me about the 3RR rule on my talk page. I'm trying to be flexible and praticle about this (which I assumed would be a no-brainer), and you're the one who won't even consider the possibility that there could be an error that I'm trying to correct. This is ridiculous. First, you incorrectly attributed a number about the BUPC to all division groups, which was an error on your part. Then when shown your were wrong, you are now just making stuff up. Why all this about nothing? The point can be made a number of ways as I've already attempted several. You are now the one on the verge of violating the 3RR rule, because unlike me you keep reverting to back to the identical error which I've thrice try to reword and make right. I don't care how you word it, but it can't state something as fact and link to a source that doesnt' support it. The statement you keep reverting back to says "Based on published numbers", and yet you yourself admit that there are no published numbers, and ever more the link to it doesn't support the number you're providing.

<dl>
<dd>Jeff, you want to read <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a>. Your edits are effectively reverts.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>These "half a dozen separate groups for which you know nothing about" are precisely obscure and next-to-impossible to research exactly because they are so small. Do you know anything of the others?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If your "estimated" 2% value were even in the ball park then there ought to be 100,000 heterodox Baha'is floating around — about 17,000 for each group. (Adherents doesn't credit the BUPC with even 10% of this, nor does it even identify any other group.) That these groups appear to have entirely escaped the notice of anyone interested, strongly suggests that even this order of magnitude is overstated.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If you get out a calculator and do some arithmetic:
<ul>
<li>Assume the BUPC at 2,000 members. (per Adherents.com but nobody else)</li>
<li>Assume the four or five other Remeyite groups are similar. (An assumption I think you would find generous and have even less substantiation.)</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>Total = 10,000
<ul>
<li>Take the least number of Baha'is from reasonable sources: 5,000,000.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>10,000 / 5,000,000 = 0.002 = 0.2%</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>To get to 2% the total number of Remeyite groups would have to be ten times larger — an entire order of magnitude larger than this guesswork can provide. And there's precious little direct evidence to even support that base 10,000 number. Therefore your edits of "estimated 2%" are incorrect on inspection.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>All that said, I've never liked presenting a value of three significant digits when there's disagreement on the first significant digit of total Baha'is (5M, 6M, 7M,&#160;???) and nobody can even get a grip on what order of magnitude of heterodox Baha'is are even in the game. (Scores? Hundreds? Thousands?) We have estimates of "perhaps a few thousand", so, if we're going to stick some number in, I don't think we can get any better than "99%+ are Baha'is" or "about one in one thousand are not."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It'd probably be better to read "the vast majority are Baha'is". While that sounds hyperbolic, the best data strongly supports it. And sweeping statements do have a home in here if so supported. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMARussellPESE_d65e.html" title="User:MARussellPESE">MARussellPESE</a> 05:45, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Praise the lord. A voice of reason. Let me first agree that "a vast majority" is the only sound statement that can be made based upon what's verifiable. I'm the first to admit that I haven't a notion to what proper numbers can be placed in these statements. You all keep coming up with figures that are fabrications based on assumptions. As I pointed out, your extrapolations provide for a number of Babis that's in the order of some 100k. You feel that's likely?</p>
<p>If you look at my edits, I've only been trying to make the statement match what the source provided says. Since when is that out of order? Jeff30000000 and Cunado are being negligable in this case. NOBODY knows what the numbers are, so all these calculations are hopelessly meaningless. I've never argued numbers on this topic. I looked at the link provided, and it simply doesn't support the statement. I'm not married to it stating 2%, or any particular %. I wrote that because that's what the source says. I've believed all along that I've just been conducting responsible editing. I'm in favor of removing the whole sentence if it's not going to reflect what the source provided actually provides for. The sentence should be removed if we can't agree that it state the numbers given by the source. I, like Cunado, agree its a lame source in the first place. Any and all "estimates" for the division group adherents are bogus, because they are baseless assumptions rooted in nothing. The whole notion of statistics with religions is flawed at it core, and an unsolveable mess. Any claim by any group across the board is an inflated smokescreen, IMHO. I move that in this case the sentence be removed and the paragraph end with "the vast majority...". <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffmichaud_1ead.html" title="User:Jeffmichaud">Jeff</a> 06:56, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This argument of yours is quite ridiculous. There are probably more websites than devoted families in the BUPC, and if you want to prove me wrong then it should be fairly easy. The absence of evidence is not evidence of absence, but you have been more than happy to leave an estimate giving the BUPC at 1000 people by someone shooting from the hip on a blog, and now you're trying to remove any mention that gives the scope of the followers of Jensen, to your advantage. Without providing anything readers are left to assume that the divisions are large enough to merit inclusion on these pages. I suggest that the absence of evidence needs to be noted.</dd>

<p>Then note the absense of evidence in the article. Where do you get off on making up statistics? I'm just dumbfounded that you or anyone feel justified in continuing this nonsense. You were the one who included the statistics for the BUPC in this and the main article. Why are you now harrassing me about it. I've never had anything to do with any of these statistics. I have been advocating following the wiki-guidlines in this matter, and that is all. Where are you coming from all of a sudden. There was an apparent truce on this matter over a week ago when Jeff300 finally did the right thing and worded the intro in an appropriate manner, after MARussell weighed in. If you wanted to participate in the discussion, where have you been. And what's this memory trouble you've been suffering from? I've had nothing to do with the origination of any of these statistics - you did. Since when does Wikipedia allow for making up statistics when none are available? You can't include hearsay in articles in case you weren't aware. Your "1000" number for each group is hearsay/rumor, unverifiable, and therefor unfit for inclusion.

<dd>I never said you added the info. By saying that the size of the divisions is unknown, it leaves it open for speculation, when in fact their size is unknown because they are so small that they virtually don't exist. Let me put it another way, if there is no evidence that a group is over 100 people, then I should be able to note in the article "there is no evidence that there are over 100" of so-and-so. I don't need a reference, because it's saying that there's an absence of evidence, which is impossible to provide a reference to. Do you get it? By insisting that we leave such a reference out, you are twisting it around.

<p>Apparently "this argument of [mine]" wasn't that ridiculous to the others who participated in the discussion which settled this a week ago, because mine was the "arguement" that won out, wasn't it? My argument is based on reality, not the fiction of your made up statistics. I've been arguing that any statement which links to that statistic should reflect what that statistic actually says, or not be used at all. Where do you get off on attacking me for standing up against an obvious violation of academic standards. You're a hypocrite and a fraud for taking this stance which cannot be justified in any way.</p>
<p>This is not a matter of logic, and even if it was, you're way off. I'll try and make this simple, for it truly is. You've stated a number (.1%), and attatched a footnote to it right? Why don't you find a reference that actually supports this statement, instead of using one that doesn't? That particular one doesn't support what you're saying, and adding your own speculation to the note doesn't solve this obvious quandry. You are stating hearsay and speculation as fact, and not even in the article. You're burying it in the notes. Riddle me this. Which wiki-guideline allows an editor to adjust the calculations of a source for which said editor disagrees with? I've got another once you solve that one.

<dd>I wish Cuñado had not added a specific number to this article, but I do understand why. The total number of <i>all</i> the Baha'i splinter groups seems to be anywhere from 2,000 to 10,000. (The best sources available are already here in Wikipedia; and the dearth even of claims by Marangella's, Soghomonian's, King's, and the Tarbiyat groups should be taken seriously.) The smallest estimate for Baha'is is 5,000,000. 10,000 / 5,000,000 = 0.002, 0.2%, or 99.8% <i>maximum</i>. If, and there's no evidence of this, the estimate of either the splinter groups, or the Baha'is is off by an <a href="../../../o/r/d/Order_of_magnitude.html" title="Order of magnitude">order of magnitude</a>, that number explodes to all of 2%.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The differences in the populations between the Baha'is and all other claimed splinter groups is an astounding three orders of magnitude. We're talking about tenths of percentage points. Jeffmichaud, you are not really helping the discussion quibbling over this, and Cuñado's 99% figure is certainly supported by the statistics.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>My problem with any figure is that it <a href="../../../f/a/l/False_precision.html" title="False precision">implies a level of precision</a> that is just not possible from the available data. Dividing a number in the thousands having at one <a href="../../../s/i/g/Significant_digit.html" title="Significant digit">significant digit</a> by another number in the millions with one significant digit results in an answer that <i>is</i> <a href="../../../s/i/g/Significance_arithmetic.html" title="Significance arithmetic">significant</a> to one digit. 1x10^4 / 5x10^6 = 2x10^-3, or 0.002.

<dd>Even if the page says less than 1%, that would give an important scope to the size of the divisions, but at the same time that means that there are at most 50,000 of them, which anyone familiar with the subject would scoff at as outrageously too high. Whoever is writing at Adherents.com probably ran into the same dilemna, and gave an incredibly gracious and arbitrary figure to avoid implying accuracy, but still at least mention the scope. Given the incredibly fractured nature of religions in general, by not mentioning anything besides "almost entirely contained within one" denomination, a reader could easily interpret that the divisions represent 10-15% (500,000-750,000), a conclusion that obviously favors the people trying to propagate those beliefs (like Jeffmichaud). If I can't footnote an explanation, then I'll just add a new section to the top explaining that the divisions are so small that nobody knows how many members there are.

<dd>Part of that language would be argumentative. Certainly *somebody* knows how big each division is. That somebody, however, not releasing numbers, can't be used obviously.

<p>Who do you propose those *somebodies* are? They don't even post enrollment claims about themselves that we can even begin to evaluate the veracity of.</p>
<p>We can't really use the Adherents number because that itself lacks credible backup. Cuñado appears to be getting at the point that the total number of all these groups, Sohrab's, Kierullah, and Remeyite, taken <i>collectively</i> is vanishingly small.</p>
<p>Cuñado, I don't think that the expression "vast majority" following the Universal House of Justice could leave anybody with the impression that 10% - 15% of those claiming to be Baha'is are not following the House of Justice; especially if one reads all the introduction <i>in toto</i> as of this writing. Good Lord, we have Denis MacEoin cited here supporting this position. Reading of these groups in turn in this article, one is noted cited as having a thousand or so, one at perhaps a hundred, one with a singe community, and the rest either defunct, or without any idea of their membership.</p>
<p>You also haven't really addressed any of my points on false precision, which is disappointing, but does bear on the presentation.

<dd>Who they are isn't relevant. My sole point being that language like "nobody knows" is argumentative because it presupposes some kind of all-encompassing knowledge by the editor. Language such as "these groups do not publish their membership counts" would be a more accurate way to state the situation imho. Adherents is a reliable and reputable site, the issue of whether their number itself is factual isn't our perview. "We report what others say". Saying that adherents says it, is a verifiable statement, and adherents is a neutral point-of-view website. I don't see much need to state any percentages, but we have to be neutral where the situation is unclear. <a href="../../../w/j/h/User%7EWjhonson_d987.html" title="User:Wjhonson">Wjhonson</a> 06:30, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>So you're claiming without any evidence tha adherents number isn't credible simply because... you don't want it to be? Parroting is not the same as "calling something crebible". Also credible is not part of wikipedia. You could start a new page on "credible". However what is a part of policy is <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a>, which is why unsourced claims on disputed issues, can't be used. <a href="../../../w/j/h/User%7EWjhonson_d987.html" title="User:Wjhonson">Wjhonson</a> 07:12, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The absence of evidence isn't mine — its Adherent's. Adherents isn't credible on this point precisly because it doesn't cite its sources for its "98%" figure <a href="http://www.adherents.com/Religions_By_Adherents.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.adherents.com/Religions_By_Adherents.html" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>.</dd>
<dd>"credible is not part of wikipedia"???? What are we providing here? Incredible data? <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> both states a clear preference for reputably published sources.

<dd>You're trying to be on the cafeteria plan. You want to pick-and-choose what you use off adherents and enforce your opinion of what's credible on others. If you open the door to using adherents as a reliable, reputable site then you've opened the door haven't you? To then say, well part of their site is credible even without sources (since they have almost NONE), and part isn't, without those same sources, is intellectually disingenious. You want to essentially choose what's credible based on your own, personal, preconceived ideas of what you want it to say. That's not a neutral point-of-view. Again I'm not advocating that we MUST use the "98%" figure, only that your slippery slope of "credible" is not a wikipedian idea. Wikipedia asks for verifiability to the *source cited*. We do not have to plumb any deeper, once the source has been vetted as reliable, which you acknowledge. <a href="../../../w/j/h/User%7EWjhonson_d987.html" title="User:Wjhonson">Wjhonson</a> 17:33, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yeah thanks, I helped write <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> so I think I'm pretty boned-up on what it says and doesn't say. I never said anything printed is reliable. But if the adherents site is going to be sourced, it needs to be done so accurately and thus quoting what it says. Instead of glossing what it says to fit your own particular agenda. Whenever someone disagrees with your method, you turn and launch a personal attack on their intelligence. It's really beneath you isn't it? <a href="../../../w/j/h/User%7EWjhonson_d987.html" title="User:Wjhonson">Wjhonson</a> 00:46, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

If I've got an agenda it's to check and state the facts. In this case that the Remeyite groups are virtually extinct, and I've got the integrity to use a noted <i>critic</i> of the Baha'is (MacEoin) to make the point.</dd>

<p>This letter is not the UHJ's "position" on the subject. It recounts the well-documented disintegration of Remey's followers. MacEoin and Warburg also comment on these and are cited. The evidence of the BUPC's disintegration is amply described on it's various articles and talk pages here. Marangella and Harvey had choice words about each other, and both thought little of Jensen — to say the least.

<p>Dearest Michael, you're really taking some generous liberties with the value of that paper. The only thing I think I could agree with you on about it is that it's convenient. "Well documented disintegration"? I didn't know there was <b>any</b> formal documentation from third parties. That is a position paper by every definition. I'm not suggesting anything regarding censoring it in any way. But a least be honest about what it truly is. There's no bibliography and no sources, unless you consider the Hands and Rhuyiah unbiased witnesses. There's basically nothing indicating that third party information was contributed to the conclusions in any way. It's a compiliation of rumors. And the fact that MacEoin and Warburg would refer to it is proof enough of what intellectually bankrupt hacks they truly are, and how valueless anything they have to write truly is. Noone went out into the field to track down this information, and cross-check it's validity. It begs the question then, where's the source of the information. We know what it's based on, and why it was written. It's all hearsay and rumor. Let's call a spade a spade here. <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffmichaud_1ead.html" title="User:Jeffmichaud">Jeff</a> 06:27, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Before you throw invective around Jeff, please note that MacEoin and Warburg don't cite the UHJ. Their research is entirely independent and often critical — so that <i>is</i> third-party confirmation. Most of the rest of the data of what these groups think of each other can be found in their respective literature. The only thing this letter does is collect it into one place. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMARussellPESE_d65e.html" title="User:MARussellPESE">MARussellPESE</a> 13:52, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I guess I misreead. My mistake. But your starting with semantics again. This paper isn't treated as a "what these groups think of each other" retrospective piece. It states this happened then this then this. What each group thinks of each other isn't really the point, and niether does it strenghten your weak position on this to say so. How is what Joel has to say about the BUPC an unbiased source for information about the BUPC. What you're selling here is laughable.</p>
<p>But thank you for confirming what I said originally about this position paper&#160;: "The only thing this letter does is collect it into one place". That's what I said. It's a compilation of rumors, the most liable that could be tracked down. It was really sweet of the UHJ to compile all the hearsay into one place so that it's sheep wouldn't have to look any deeper into the matter. <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffmichaud_1ead.html" title="User:Jeffmichaud">Jeff</a> 18:03, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The document is not supposed to be an academic research paper, for God's sake, it was written to National Assemblies following attempts by Marangella to advertise to Baha'is around the world. It was written to Baha'is. The Continental Counselors around the world have been monitoring Covenant-breakers for many decades, and citing them would be a silly thing for the reseach department to do. As far as I can tell there are only two - maybe three - points that are not confirmed elsewhere. To bring up <a href="http://www.adherents.com/adh_branches.html#Baha'ism" class="external text" title="http://www.adherents.com/adh_branches.html#Baha'ism" rel="nofollow">adherents.com</a> again, they say "A useful and fairly comprehensive treatment of the subject (although published by the majority Baha'i body, so it is clearly not without bias) can be found here [link to the document we're talking about]." I think that's how it should be presented here on wikipedia, not as a source of unbiased information, but "a treatment of the subject" by the Universal House of Justice, with a link. <a href="../../../c/u/n/User%7ECunado19_ff71.html" title="User:Cunado19"><font color="#AF7817"><b>Cuñado</b></font></a> <a href="../../../b/a/h/Image%7EBahaitemplatestar.png_81d9.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/1/1d/Bahaitemplatestar.png/20px-Bahaitemplatestar.png" alt="" width="20" height="19" longdesc="../../../b/a/h/Image%7EBahaitemplatestar.png_81d9.html" /></a> - <a href="../../../c/u/n/User_talk%7ECunado19_98ea.html" title="User talk:Cunado19"><font size="-3">Talk</font></a> 20:56, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<hr />
<p>Wjhonson and Jeffmichaud, since I have your attention, I'd like you to observe closely exactly how, why, and where I use this paper as a source here. This illustrates what I expect of contributions here, at least mine. I expect to push through sources to get as close as possible to primary sources and then check to see that they corroborate each other.</p>
<p>This letter is used to source <i>exactly</i> five points:</p>
<ol>
<li>"Shoghi Effendi's appointed Hands of the Cause unanimously voted it was impossible to legitimately recognize and assent to a successor."</li>
<li>"The 27 living Hands of the Cause (Hands), … signed a unanimous proclamation … shortly after the passing of Shoghi Effendi, stating … [etc., etc.]"</li>
<li>"Charles Mason Remey was among the Hands who signed the unanimous proclamations in 1957, acknowledging that Shoghi Effendi had died without having appointed his successor. He was among the nine Custodians elected to serve in the Holy Land as interim head of the Faith."</li>
<li>"All those that profess belief in Mason Remey as the second Guardian do not accept the Universal House of Justice established in 1963, but amongst themselves have a variety of opinions on legitimacy and the proper succession of authority."</li>
<li>"He was largely abandoned by the time of his death, at the age of 100, and was buried without religious rites."</li>
</ol>
<p>Items 1., 2., and the first half of 3. are essentially the same point: Remey initially was in agreement with all the other Hands. This point is corroborated in <i>Ministry of the Custodians</i> on pages 28-30, as noted in Note 19. The source for these statements are a "statement" and "proclamation" that were widely disseminated around the Baha'i community. These aren't in somebody's shoebox somewhere. The veracity of the existence and content of these documents are above suspision. An online link is provided in those letters for anybody to see these for themselves.</p>
<p>The second half of point 3., that Remey was one of the first nine elected to serve in Haifa, likewise relies on <i>Custodians</i>, p. 30, and is in the same proclamation.</p>
<p>Point 4. is sufficiently obvious from even casual perusal of these groups' discussions of each other, that this paper's usefulness as a single source is plain.</p>
<p>Point 5. is addressed directly by Ruhiyyih Rabbani in her introduction to <i>Custodians</i>, p. 16, and is corroborated entirely by a Remeyite website <a href="http://www.charlesmasonremey.net/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.charlesmasonremey.net/" rel="nofollow">[10]</a>which says:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"At the time of his death, Remey had few faithful supporters. Among those steadfast, the author has had acquaintance with Joseph Pepe, Charles Gaines, Mary Magdalene Wilkins, Donald Harvey, Jacques Soghomonian, Jean Miller, and several others that need anonymity.</dd>
<dd>Remey lived his remaining years in relative inactivity, and his loyal supporters became mostly quiescent. He died February 4, 1974, at the age of ninety-nine in Florence, Italy. After a simple burial, Pepe, with the assistance of some of Remey’s supporters, arranged for a monument at Remey’s grave.:</dd>
</dl>
<p>Now, this letter makes quite a few provocative statements:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Marangella's excuse for ignoring Remey's formal appointment of Harvey as his successor was that Remey was exhibiting irrational behaviour."</li>
<li>"As the dispute over the leadership of Remey's following broke into the open, however, Carré suddenly emerged as a spokesman for the bizarre and entirely unrelated claims of one Jamshid Ma'ani."</li>
<li>"Meanwhile, in the United States, two more Covenant-breaking factions [King's and Marangella's] had emerged and were bitterly denouncing one another."</li>
<li>"Perhaps the strangest development in this long and confused history was one centering on a person [Giusepe Pepe] who was neither a member of the Faith nor had taken any role in the activities of the various Covenant-breakers."</li>
</ul>
<p>Probably the strongest is:</p>
<ul>
<li>"The emergence of Jensen marks a further deterioration in the moral character of the group following Remey."</li>
</ul>
<p>I expect you both to note that I have not used this letter to make <i>any</i> of these, or any other, points. There are two reasons for this:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, the letter's notes do not address these. Wjhonson, you asked what the letter's notes covered. Please observe that where I've noted <i>Custodians</i> around pages 29-30 here, the letter's notes cited the same range, and linked to <i>Custodians</i>.</li>
<li>Second, many of these points are made more forcefully independently — either from observing these groups in particular, or reading through the notes already here.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, bottom line: this letter is useful here where it has cited its sources, but in my opinion is not where it hasn't — which is why I haven't used it to assert <i>any</i> of its other points.</p>
<p>Wjhonson, that is what I mean by not parroting what we trip across online, but pushing through to evaluate its sources. You will notice that that's a standard I put my own religion's works through <i>before</i> it goes in. Ask Cuñado or Jeff3000 if I don't do it to them too. And they've done it to me. I did it right here on the 98.7654321% question. Jeffmichaud, you've found it come to your relief as well in your articles.</p>
<p>Given the care with which I have treated this work evaluating sources, and the even-handed treatment your edits have received, these continual broadsides accusing bias from the both of you don't have legs to stand on.</p>
<p>And Jeff, I'm tired of the cheap shots on this subject. There's nearly 1,000 pages of work, between Taherzadeh's <i>Covenant of Baha'u'llah</i> and Ruhiyyih Khanum's <i>Custodians</i>, for Baha'is to study on this subject. I've read them both. Most of the deepened believers I know have as well. Not one of the Baha'is here have ever made mention of the BUPC's documented practice of revising its eschatological prophecies <i>post facto</i>, much less made sarcastic remarks about them. Neither have we referred to prophecies about the Great Pyramid, which are to be found in exactly none of the writings except for Shoghi Effendi to state that there aren't any to be found in the writings. So tone it down if you please. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMARussellPESE_d65e.html" title="User:MARussellPESE">MARussellPESE</a> 06:25, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Tone what down? My pointing out what should be obvious. And this is funny: "Not one of the Baha'is here have ever... made sarcastic remarks about them"? I guess you don't keep abreast of all the discussions surrounding the BUPC pages. You're saying, with a straight face, you're not aware of a barrage of cheap shots and sarcasm directed at the BUPC's beliefs? You yourself have never made even one sarcastic comment? And noone else either. It's all me right? And you all are victims of "continual broadsides" and "cheap shots"? ROFLOL!!! Hold on, I'm having an asthma attack from laughing so hard. Okay...First of all, I do believe that I've be honest in my discussions with you; stating clearly when I disagree, and likewise acknowledging your often fair and unbiased approach where applicible. Please tell me if I'm wrong, because I'm as quick to apologise for my misunderstandings as I am to defend my convictions. Is that a fair statement about myself? I can't actually recall accusing you of bias or being disingenuine in the past. Cunado, and Jeff3000000, well, that's different. They often are in my opinion. We're diametrically opposed intellectually, so naturally I'm often at odds with you, but I believe I've always called a spade a spade pointing out both the positive and negative. You sound as if you believe that the times you've been acting in good faith as an editor should be regarded as favors. I never asked you for any favors. I assumed this was a characteristic of your nature as an editor.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Let's rewind what's happended in this line of discussion. I made an edit that I believed was a minor oversight in the article which stated that the position paper was "what happened to these groups"; I changed it to what I believed was a neutral position. After your rebuttal to justify your revert of my edit (which hasn't stood I should note), I stated at the outset that "I'm not suggesting anything regarding censoring it in any way." So what's your problem? I've agreed that we can disagree. Gotta-be-right-all-the-time syndrome? You go through this whole diatribe about how where it's used as a source, and noone challenged those points in the first place. I was just pointing out that not everyone sees this paper as a paper on "what happened". So it's not a neutral thing to say then, is it?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I honestly think it's pompous and self-righteous for any so-called Baha'is around here to stand in judgement of any other. Noone here has remained exempt from ridicule and or sarcasm. The record shows that it's been served up in equal portions. If anyone believes I'm casting the first and only stones around here, they're a hypocrite in my opinion. <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffmichaud_1ead.html" title="User:Jeffmichaud">Jeff</a> 08:52, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Oh I've dished out more than my share, but nobody's refered to the BUPC, individually or collectively, as: "sheep", made dismissive comments about editors "playing nicely with the other kids", being "cute" and "tattling", or accused you of "making up statistics".</p>
<p>I do get sarcastic when I question assertions and the answer is nothing more than a repeated assertion, but you haven't done that in a long while. It's made it easier to deal fairly with the subject and I appreciate that.</p>
<p>I would point out that one of the most difficult areas to deal with regarding the BUPC is the bewildering array of prophetic statements of Jensen's and Chase's. It's not sarcastic to ask to provide documentation about these have been independently published prior to the events. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMARussellPESE_d65e.html" title="User:MARussellPESE">MARussellPESE</a> 04:04, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Huh? What does any of what you just said have to do with your revert and that position paper? I don't even know what we're talking about anymore. And I'm sure that you don't. What do prophecies now have to do with anything? If you'd like to start a new topic about that stuff, then let's. I have a better idea. Why don't you participate in the already on-going discussions about our prophecies that you're obviously aware of, instead of taking a cheap shot at me about them here where they are not the subject at hand?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Back to the actual kind-of-sort-of-topic (that's now being beaten to death); let's finish our downward spiral into discussing how we feel about the way we discuss things in general. Sorry, but all of your examples of me being rude didn't involve interactions that you participated in, did they? You're bringing up stuff that I said to other editors in the middle of heated discussions that you weren't even involved in; which dissappoints me to know that you were observing them and intentionally remaining uninvolved. I've always felt you have a knack for getting at the root of edit wars and resolving them. To know that you've been watching the ones I've been in and sitting it out makes me think a little less of you.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>So I'll assume that you do agree that in dealing with YOU, MARussell, that I'm as quick to criticise as I am to praise your work. Is that a fair statement? Now if you want to isolate my words and try and paint me out to be some sort of tyrant, I'll have to call shananigans on that. It's simply not fair, and you know it. I'm defensive when being attacked by bratty little know-it-alls, just like anyone else. If the kids around here can dish it out, they should be able to take it too. If some people want to try and push me around, then they're growed up enough to get shoved back. That's the way the sandbox works. I've watched these same bully tactics scare away others. Well guess what? I cannot be deterred. I don't have to defend my beliefs, just there right to be a part of Wikipedia. That's all I'm doing here. Noone should take any of it personally. I'm as passionate as you obviously are, so I would expect you of all people to understand. <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffmichaud_1ead.html" title="User:Jeffmichaud">Jeff</a> 06:27, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><br />
within chapter "other disputes" I read the following about Mr. Ficicchia:<br />
In Switzerland, Francesco Ficicchia wrote a comprehensive pseudo-academic attack, Der Baha'ismus – Weltreligion der Zukunft? (Evangelische Zentralstelle für Weltanschauungsfragen, Quell Verlag, Stuttgart, 1981). His work was financed and distributed by the Protestant Church in Germany. A book by Bahá'í scholar Udo Schaefer, et. al., originally titled Desinformation als Methode (English title: Making the Crooked Straight, 2000), was written to refute Ficicchia's accusations.[49] Scholarly reviews styled Schaefer’s book as “an important contribution to the critical study of the Bahá’í religion”[50] “clarifying many misconceptions” and presenting “a picture of the Baha’i Faith that no future researcher in the field can afford to overlook”[51]. Since its publication the German Protestant Church has disassociated itself from Ficicchia's book[52] and revised its own relationship to the German Bahá’í Community[53], and since then has accepted it as an important partner in interreligious dialogue.<br />
<br />
I contacted the EZW and received following reply:<br /></p>
<p>Sehr geehrter Herr XXXX,</p>
<p>eine Aufkündigung der Zusammenarbeit mit Francesco Ficicchia hat es von Seiten der EZW nicht gegeben. Die Forschungen zum Bahai'ismus sind weitergegangen und werden weitergehen.</p>

The cooperation with F. Ficicchia has never been quit on the side of the EZW. The research about Bahaism is going on and will go on.[..]<br />
<br />
Therefore this part of the article is false and has to be removed immediately. Seems to be a product of Bahai-defamation!--193.171.99.108 08:15, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sorry friend, but the statement appears to be sourced and verifiable. Didn't you notice the footnote? A possible solution to this dicotomy might be to source your information as well and contrast it against the current statement to show the varying opinions about the matter. <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffmichaud_1ead.html" title="User:Jeffmichaud">Jeff</a> 02:51, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>What is of importance here is that the EZW has disassociated itself from Ficicchia's original book. The question of any further cooperation between Ficicchia and the <i>Evangelische Zentralstelle für Weltanschauungsfragen</i> is not really of interest in this context.

<p>Hey com'on<br />
How can you go on cooperating with someone who disqualifies your main work as pseudo-academic?<br />
PS: Wikipedia should find a way to lock mods who are obviously not neutral.<br />
--193.171.98.134 07:37, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>In my opinion, the relevant thing here is that the book exists. Whether the Evangelical Church publishing house supports it or not is as irrelevant as if Udo Schaefer is supported by the UHJ or not. Supports do not give more or less credibility to arguments. Therefore I think that the sentence on the publishing house should be removed, as well as the POV reference to the "pseudo-academic" nature of the book. --<a href="../../../j/d/e/User%7EJdemarcos_a961.html" title="User:Jdemarcos">jofframes</a> 14:20, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Good news anonymous contributor, there are no mods here preventing anyone from doing anything. The reason that an obviously biased POV statement like that can be included is because it's from a <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources">reliable source</a>, and <a href="../../../a/t/t/Wikipedia%7EAttribution_916a.html" title="Wikipedia:Attribution">verifiable</a>. You're welcome to make a contribution to the article, just like the rest of the 6 billion people on the planet. I'd suggest registering with a username first, as there is a quasi-consensus to revert contributions from anonymous authors. Just sign up, and start improving away.</p>
<p>I think jofframes has a great point, but I can guess that the Baha'is here would argue that because of these seemingly careless remarks from the reveiwer Ulrich Ben, that the statement is verifiable, whether true or fair or accurate. I think that relevency here supercedes verifiable though. You have a good point that it's a non issue. And you're right, the "psuedo-academic" statement is POV. Who even said a criticism has to be academic in the first place? It's POV. Remove it.<a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffmichaud_1ead.html" title="User:Jeffmichaud">Jeff</a> 17:04, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Jofframes, agree with removing the slap: "pseudo-academic". I read all three English-language reviews and couldn't find a specific citation. If it's in the Dhen citations, that's only of limited value as a <a href="../../../a/_/_/WP%7EA_5364.html" title="WP:A">WP:A</a> source. However, Mipago added these German-language sources in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bah%C3%A1%27%C3%AD_divisions&amp;diff=94290998&amp;oldid=94285585" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bah%C3%A1%27%C3%AD_divisions&amp;diff=94290998&amp;oldid=94285585" rel="nofollow">this</a> edit, and the "pseudo-academic" tag was already there. This seems clearly un-supported POV.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Disagree, however, with removing the sentence noting the connection to the German Protestant Church's support. According to all three reviews this book was the standard German-language text, and that they've revised their position speaks well of them. There may be a way to phrase this that flows better.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>New point: I'm not sure what this entire paragraph is doing here. This deals with external criticism and apologia. It seems entirely out of place here. Does this belong in <a href="../../../b/a/h/Baha%27i_apologetics.html" title="Baha'i apologetics">Baha'i apologetics</a>? <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMARussellPESE_d65e.html" title="User:MARussellPESE">MARussellPESE</a> 21:35, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Agreed about moving it to <a href="../../../b/a/h/Baha%27i_apologetics.html" title="Baha'i apologetics">Baha'i apologetics</a>. I still think that allusions to the Evangelische Kirche are irrelevant. That their current position speaks well of them or not is also irrelevant for the issue. --<a href="../../../j/d/e/User%7EJdemarcos_a961.html" title="User:Jdemarcos">jofframes</a> 10:47, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Why is the reference to the documented support Ficicchia received irrelevant? He did not perform his research in a vacuum. If the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Congregation_for_the_Doctrine_of_the_Faith_a25a.html" title="Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith">Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith</a> had sponsored the reasearch producing such a roundly criticized polemic, that would certainly be notable; as would its eventual distancing itself from it. In its German context, the <i><a href="../../../e/v/a/Evangelische_Kirche_in_Deutschland_20c7.html" title="Evangelische Kirche in Deutschland">Evangelische Kirche in Deutschland</a></i>, of which the EZW appears to be its research office for world religions, is by no means a fringe group.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>And once it's on the table that they supported Ficicchia initially, it can't, in any fairness to them, be left there without noting that their position has evolved.</dd>

<dd>Aside: I have no German, but the the EZW can be translated with some dictionary help. I found <a href="http://www.canoo.net/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.canoo.net/" rel="nofollow">[14]</a> particularly useful breaking down the compound word, and <a href="http://dict.leo.org/" class="external autonumber" title="http://dict.leo.org/" rel="nofollow">[15]</a> helpful with the definitions:

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Sorry, that's an assertion; and it's not convincing. The EKD's involvement, support and ultimate dissociation is clearly pertinent background on Ficicchia's work as it was well known in the German-speaking world. It's omission here would be unencyclopaedic.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>But, we are agreed that this paragraph should be moved to <a href="../../../b/a/h/Bah%C3%A1%27%C3%AD_apologetics.html" title="Bahá'í apologetics">Bahá'í apologetics</a> as an example of same? <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMARussellPESE_d65e.html" title="User:MARussellPESE">MARussellPESE</a> 13:23, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<u>Hey most of you misunderstand the intention of this defamation</u><br />
It's totally nuts by whom Mr. Ficicchia was supported. This makes his arguments by no means falser. The intention of this paragraph is to disqualify all the works of a severe Baha'i critic. The intention is to reduce all his arguments onto a level of personal fuddy duddy without any objectivity.<br />
It's totally laughing reasding all this excuses like: "OK his work was disqualified by his big spender as pseudoacademic botch, but they enjoy it going on working with him". That makes no sense, it's an oxymoron. --193.171.99.108 08:18, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
