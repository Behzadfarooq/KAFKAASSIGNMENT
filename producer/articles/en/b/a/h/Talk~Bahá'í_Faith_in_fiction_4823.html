<dd>OK. BTW I beleive he does mention it if briefly. I beleive there is a mention of a Hidden Word in his recent remake of The Saint but it did not get into the movie adaption. I don't follow his work, it not being my cup of tea as they say, so I'm not sure how much he really mentions the Faith or not but my impression is that it's not a important theme, crucial to the plot or is used as the background in which everything happens as the other entries do. However he is an active author both in Baha'i oriented works and in publishing mystery/crime/spy novels - surpassing even Maya in prominance though she certainly has a serious body of work.--<a href="../../../s/m/k/User%7ESmkolins_cf93.html" title="User:Smkolins">Smkolins</a> 11:14, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Just wondering - there are precious few places that specifically mention the Baha'is Faith in relation to some of the publications - and yet the content is not to my mind disputed even by the authors, yet as such angles on the them are rare how are we to avoid "our own reviews"? I understand the main point of this to be an avoidance of the original work issue and also to avoid simply self-agrandizing but then there is stating something that is simply true. --<a href="../../../s/m/k/User%7ESmkolins_cf93.html" title="User:Smkolins">Smkolins</a> 12:43, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Tom Clancey has a character in one of his books that is the victim of torture and toxic experiments. So I guess that would beg the question of how Baha'is are generally perceived in literature and news. == Chiwikidude 14:06, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You'd have to read it. Evidence is found that the planet has been enhabited before, many times, and because the planet is periodically sterilized (but not in time with when the traces of the prior enhabitants end) it has to be by spacefaring civilizations and the characters wrestle with what it all means and come to the conclusion that some kind of discovery, common near the time when a civilization reaches this semi-inhabitable planet it makes some kind of leap which isn't defined but is presented as having mystical qualities as I recall. It's presented as not mearly a technological leap.--<a href="../../../s/m/k/User%7ESmkolins_cf93.html" title="User:Smkolins">Smkolins</a> 17:17, 13 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Tom Ligon checking in. I'm glad you found my website and my story comments, as previous critiques I saw here were not as appreciative. In "The Gardener" Hab and others had found the signs of a series of deliberately destroyed civilizations on the planet, and many have drawn dire conclusions about the fate of mankind. Without wanting to spoil the ending, he comes up with an alternate, and much more hopeful, interpretation at the end, and also manages to replant a little seed of faith.</dd>

<dd>The terrorists trying to ram Earth was never published ("For A Little Price"). I considered bringing it back out after 9-11, but it just didn't seem right. It had three re-writes, all too dark to interest Stan Schmidt of Analog. The final version tells the story from the point of view of one of the terrorists, a unique approach, but I can see how some folks might not grow too fond of the main character that way. To prepare for it, I studied the Quran in considerable depth. I never did find any justification in it for terrorism, not that I really expected any. It did make me wonder, though, just what tumble of cobbles the "Islamic" extremists of late are following. If anyone is interested in seeing that story, let me know.</dd>

<dd>HI! Welcome! You may have another story about terrorists ramming earth but didn't the Shia extremist in "The Devil and the Deep Black Void" threaten/consider ramming the Earth? I'm sure that's what I read - that's why the other Shi'a clerics drove him away from the Earth and how he wound up at the planet with the Baha'is. Did "For A Little Price" come before or after "The Devil and the Deep Black Void"? BTW, I noticed a "Tom Ligon" in the cast of <a href="../../../l/o/v/Loving_%28TV_series%29_f6fe.html" title="Loving (TV series)">Loving (TV series)</a> on ABC - was that you? and <a href="../../../y/o/u/Your_Own_Thing_824a.html#Off-Broadway" title="Your Own Thing">Your_Own_Thing#Off-Broadway</a>?</dd>

<dd>The extremists who attempted to destroy Earth with the starship are, in fact, the ones exiled to Mazra'ih, the planet on which Hab was born. Their exile is a result of them having evacuated their very small cult (a couple of thousand individuals) to space prior to the attempt to destroy Earth, and after the plot was stopped, they were never invited back. In fact, it was the Baha'is who invited them there, when nobody else would take them. The terror cult is a small minority on Mazra'ih, and would have been easily managable had they not smuggled a dozen nukes and other weapons in with them. The planet-smashing attempt took place prior to either of the Mazra'ih stories, but I never did write "Price" until after "Devil", and I think after "The Gardener" as well. "Price" shows this cult to actually be abominable heretics: their leader, the fellow who dies in "Devil", has written his own version of the Quran, and would thus not be considered a follower of Islam by any true practitioner of the faith. Only a very small core of his band are actually dangerous, the rest would be redeemable if freed of the influence of that few, and in fact, they do so at the end of "The Gardener."

<dd>As for future stories it might be interesting if the reconciliation you suggest also had an effect that hinted that that seed of faith about what happens to technologically advanced civilizations. On the practical side I'd suggest the dynamic that results from when opposing forces join forces - on a personal level some pain need not be discovered and compromise one's willingness to do things (like not having a period of justifiable depression and worse - I was just hearing about suicide rates in Aphghanistan among women) and on a social level there would be no wastes in systemtic oppression of a segment of society and the costs of war. Periods like the Dark Ages, and the excesses of the Roman Empire, would have been avoided and civilization could have lept forward far faster.

<p>a couple single works have come to my attention but I'm still learning about them - The Golden Age: Thy Kingdom Come. Published by: PublishAmerica (2005) by tk ralya, and The Island of the Same Name. Bend, Ore.: Manifest Books (1997) by Joseph Sheppherd. Both are leaps into the future with a strong Baha'i subtext but other than that I have no info yet. Anyone know more about them?--<a href="../../../s/m/k/User%7ESmkolins_cf93.html" title="User:Smkolins">Smkolins</a> 17:21, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
I've now read the first of these and indeed it deserves to be mentioned - the reference also clearly implies it deserves reference. I tried to use the ref structure but failed - the rest of the page suddenly disappeared. Perhaps more capable hands can make sense of this ref structure. It would be nice if the editing buttons facilitated the process. I've got the other book on order too--<a href="../../../s/m/k/User%7ESmkolins_cf93.html" title="User:Smkolins">Smkolins</a> 23:19, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

Just started a small section on Joseph Sheppherd's book. I also saw that there are a substantial number of works appearing so I tried to break up the flow into an early phase and the present. As far as I can tell things really begin with major references or encorporation of the Faith in Tom Ligon's works first in 1986. Almost at the same time Maya's works begin and span upto the present but her significant works in relation to the Faith so far were largely in the 90's. Then we have Joseph's work in 1997. Since the turn of the century I begin to see a mushrooming of works and didn't want that to overwhlem the early phase. I also found another Baha'i with an online review of scifi including some here I'm hoping to help out here....--<a href="../../../s/m/k/User%7ESmkolins_cf93.html" title="User:Smkolins">Smkolins</a> 13:29, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well then you should congratulate him. I just finished reading the book. I was very gripped by the second half. I'm not sure how to phrase this in the article but of everything I've read so far his is the only one which deals with the fact that Baha'is beleive in a Major and Minor plan of God and that the Baha'i Faith is the Minor plan (if we do our duty well enough.) The majority of the book deals with what I would short-hand in Baha'i circles as a way the Major plan of God brings society towards its destiny. Nicely done. I'm thinking of writing up an article for World Order and one factor (and thus original research not for here) might deal with some of this.... The one published article on the Baha'i Faith and fiction compares the religion to Star Trek (and then proceeds mostly to immediately do something else in my view) has perhaps one good point - that in the view of the history of Star Trek there is a sense that Earth had to get it's act together before joining the spacefaring peoples. This is comparable to the view that we should get our house in order and not wait for something else to either distract us or do it for us, roughly a Baha'i pov. The mechanics of arriving at a kind of utopia as it were. And as part of that history there are references to various forces and wars and etc about how earth got there in Star Trek. But things like the Matrix movies, which call for and have some kind of mass change in society, completely side step *how* such a change is wrought. After the first movie I really hoped they'd work that angle but instead the amost completely avoided the topic - in a sense giving up that large scale change is really possible. The other works covered in this article don't much deal with that or even at all. Mr. Sheppherd's does. If Mrs. Ralya's books continue perhaps she will deal with this theme too but so far it's unique!</dd>

<p>He also predicted a few things for 2006 that haven't come to pass and some that have for different reasons.

<p>Ran across that entirely by accident. I was trying to track down a reference to the Jeapoardy TV show, though not fictional, that has mentioned the Baha'i Faith a few times. I ran across the fact that james (Bud) Humpreys, editor of the American Baha'i form 1997-? was a 3 day champion on Jeopardy (most of the way down this page<a href="http://comm.boisestate.edu/Alumni.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://comm.boisestate.edu/Alumni.htm" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> and was trying to track down more info - still trying to figure out is there enough material for an entry and where - perhaps the popular media section needs to be expanded into it's own section but keep smaller fictional references here...) when a link in the google list said something about Sherlock Holmes and Baha'i....</p>
<p>The reviews of the book and it's sequel aren't very complimentary but at least there was a sequel....

BTW, I found four references to Baha'i in Jeopardy -</p>
<p>The first may have been Game #2861 - Monday, January 27, 1997, Double Jeopardy! Round, 19TH CENTURY AMERICA for $1000 "This religion that promotes a universal faith was introduced to the U.S. from Persia around 1893".<a href="http://www.j-archive.com/showgame.php?game_id=650&amp;highlight=bahai" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.j-archive.com/showgame.php?game_id=650&amp;highlight=bahai" rel="nofollow">[8]</a></p>
<p>Game #4340 - Friday, June 13, 2003, single Jeopardy round, KEEP THE FAITH for $1000: 'The prophet of this religion, Mirza Husayn Ali, is known as Baha'u'llah or "Glory of God" to the faithful."<a href="http://www.j-archive.com/showgame.php?game_id=1185&amp;highlight=bahai" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.j-archive.com/showgame.php?game_id=1185&amp;highlight=bahai" rel="nofollow">[9]</a></p>
<p>This may have been just a mistake - the problem may have been with the question proposed rather than the answer given by the show but we're mentioned here... Game #4601 - Monday, September 13, 2004, Double Jeopardy! Round, RELIGIOUS TITLES for $1600 - "Bhai, Sardar" was the answer and "What is Bahá'í?" was the wrong question - turns on it should have been "What is Sikhism"?<a href="http://www.j-archive.com/showgame.php?game_id=6&amp;highlight=baha\'i" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.j-archive.com/showgame.php?game_id=6&amp;highlight=baha\'i" rel="nofollow">[10]</a></p>

<dd>All true probably - Mr. Collins is an exceptional researcher. However rather than note every single reference made to the Faith the article is framed as a review of places were there is a crucial or major theme related to the religion. There is a section at the begining noting "over 30 mentions" and even references Mr. Collins' research as it was donated to Adherents.com. However I am interested in the <a href="../../../i/s/a/Isabel_Allende_daf2.html" title="Isabel Allende">Isabel Allende</a> reference. If it can be confirmed and extended it may well deserve adding.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As for the PKDick addition...again if book uses the religion as a key aspect of the whole story, ok. Hinting that something related to the faith governs a whole planet, but otherwise being a small part of a novel seems to me to be hardly worth the mention unless one is again trying to be exhaustive which again is not really the aim of this article as it stands. Does anyone know how substantial or important the mention is? I don't have the book. --<a href="../../../s/m/k/User%7ESmkolins_cf93.html" title="User:Smkolins">Smkolins</a> 02:44, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well i'm getting mixed references. No mention of the religion in the formal review here - <a href="http://www.isabelallende.com/infinite_plan.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.isabelallende.com/infinite_plan.htm" rel="nofollow">[13]</a> or here <a href="http://www.isabelallende.com/infinite_plan_reviews.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.isabelallende.com/infinite_plan_reviews.htm" rel="nofollow">[14]</a> , though it is mentioned here in the second review - <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Infinite-Plan-Novel-Isabel-Allende/dp/0060924985" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.amazon.com/Infinite-Plan-Novel-Isabel-Allende/dp/0060924985" rel="nofollow">[15]</a> as mentioned above. So it seems possible that the religion is a major component of the book and that angle is not much played up in the other reviews.... But we still need to establish not only whether the religion is an important aspect of the book but also what to say about it - so far the article has summary of the story with an angle on the context of the religion and a quick summary statement about what the context or distinguishing quality of the covereage was....--<a href="../../../s/m/k/User%7ESmkolins_cf93.html" title="User:Smkolins">Smkolins</a> 03:21, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
