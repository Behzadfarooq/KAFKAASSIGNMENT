<p>I recently took some pictures of the Wilmette House which I'm willing to put up, but I'm not sure how best to present them, and I don't have any text that I could really put with it besides "wow, take a look at that fancy concrete work." So if anyone wants to expound on the architecture of that particular structure and wants some pictures to go with it, let me know. (I'll release them under some nice license or public domain. They're ok, but nothing award winning. I know how to use a camera, and I was using a decent one, but I didn't really take the time to try and take really nice shots. It was awfully cold.) --<a href="../../../j/k/o/User%7EJkominek_b791.html" title="User:Jkominek">jkominek</a> 21:29, 31 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think stating definitively that Remey's design for the Ma<u>sh</u>riqu'l-A<u>dh</u>kár on Mount Carmel will, in fact, be used, is going out on a limb. Given his Covenant-Breaker status, I think it's reasonable to question its ultimate selection. I searched and cannot find any confirmation that his design will be used. I think it would be more appropriate to simply state that his design was approved by Shoghi Effendi, and leave it at that. Would anyone object to a change of phrasing here? <a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKeldan_44b0.html" title="User:Keldan">Keldan</a> 03:06, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The reading: "A design by Charles Mason Remey was approved by Shoghi Effendi." is accurate. I don't know that his design won't be used though considering the House would be overturning the approval. It'd hinge on whether the Guardian "selected" it, making it his choice, or whether he "approved" it, meaning that he considered it acceptable. But, when I was on pilgrimage it seemed pretty clear that that was the design that'll be used.</dd>

<dd>I've seen the model at Bahji, and don't like it at all. His work was derivative (Just line up the Syndey and Kampala temples with Wilmette's.) and uninspired. (Most architects of that generation were trained to be that way.) The Mount Carmel design is a double of the Ashkabad temple. Personally, W.S. Maxwell and L. Bourgeois were both far superior. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMARussellPESE_d65e.html" title="User:MARussellPESE">MARussellPESE</a> 20:37, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Actually, I'm more partial to having the Houses of Worship listed in order of construction, as opposed to alphabetically (and even alphabetically, shouldn't they be by country rather than by city?).

<p>Is this actually true? Because as I'm sure everyone here knows the Bahai religion is not legally recognized in Iran and they are a persecuted group (extremely doubtful that this will ever change under the current system), so this doesn't quite add up. <a href="../../../s/o/u/User%7ESouthernComfort_743b.html" title="User:SouthernComfort">SouthernComfort</a> 21:05, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><i>"A site has been selected, and plans drawn for the Bahá'í Temple of Tehran, Iran, but Iranian government action has thus far blocked the start of construction."</i> IMHO, this is far too simplistic and ambiguous an explanation, all things considered. Based on this sentence, one might assume there was an attempt at construction, or at least some sort of communication with the authorities about it, which would seemingly be impossible considering the fact that one can end up in prison and possibly worse due to being Bahai. If the plans have been drawn to construct the temple for when the government changes or the restrictions lifted, whichever comes first, then that would make more sense. Sort of like when a "government in exile" is established. I'm just thinking there's a lot more to be said than one sentence. <a href="../../../s/o/u/User%7ESouthernComfort_743b.html" title="User:SouthernComfort">SouthernComfort</a> 22:11, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>According to www.bahaitemple.org, the website of the temple in Wilmette, the Panama City temple is the "Mother Temple of Latin America", not Central America, and Sydney's is the "Mother Temple of the Antipodes", not Australasia. In addition, several are not listed at all: Western Samoa's is the "Mother Temple of the Pacific Islands", India's is the "Mother Temple of the Indian Subcontinent", and Wilmette's is the "Mother Temple of the West". I didn't want to change the ones that are "wrong" in case they're based on something more reliable (than an official website?), and by extension I didn't add the others because I think they should probably all conform to one source. Anybody care to help on that? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../t/j/r/User%7ETjrudebeck_d01e.html" title="User:Tjrudebeck">Tjrudebeck</a> (<a href="../../../t/j/r/User_talk%7ETjrudebeck_213e.html" title="User talk:Tjrudebeck">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Tjrudebeck_cdb4.html" title="Special:Contributions/Tjrudebeck">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

<dd>It is definitely weird; I don't think it should have an infobox, or a separate page; there is not enough information for each house of worship to have it's own page. -- <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeff3000_72a5.html" title="User:Jeff3000">Jeff3000</a> 23:37, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The article claims that the Baha'i House of Worship in Delhi is the most visited building in the world, but with no reference, this seems really unlikely, does anyone know if this is true? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 140.247.144.223 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_140.247.144.223_33d7.html" title="Special:Contributions/140.247.144.223">contribs</a>) .</small></p>
<p>That DOES seem very unlikely.

<dd>Zaz, we need a new map. The old one doesn't show where they are; and I couldn't figure out what the colors were for. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMARussellPESE_d65e.html" title="User:MARussellPESE">MARussellPESE</a> 05:06, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Zaz, you had three hours to get a meaningful legend on it. Without it it didn't make sense, especially as the list of planned sites is at the opposite end of the article. It still could use the national borders showing through the highlight.

<dd>Then, consider planning your time so that your edits are focused and complete. Once you hit the "Save Page" button it's up here for all to see. Nobody else knows if its a work in progress; and it's a lot to ask that others wait for you to get around to fixing it on your time.</dd>

<dd>Your pardon, but this is a related issue to the one raised on your talk page about using the edit summaries. You are, by no means, the only one with limited time on your hands.
