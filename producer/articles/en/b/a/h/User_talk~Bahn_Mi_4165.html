<p>I read what you said on Dunc's talk page. If you will refer to his backlog of discussion archives, you will see that he has crossed the line of civility on more than one occassion recently; do you have any suggestion as to how this should be addressed?

<p>I noticed on Shauri's RFA and at least one other you voted in opposition due to a lack of experience. I've noticed that several users seem to feel this way but dont always vote. If we could come to some sort of baseline agreement for what users meet, and voted as a group, we could act more effectively in stopping inexperienced users from attaining adminship. I will try and compile a list of other users who vote in similar patterns. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreestylefrappe_d689.html" title="User:Freestylefrappe">freestylefrappe</a> 21:17, 26 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Bahn Mi</p>
<p>I see that you have been casting some votes on deletion debates, and as you saw some time ago this is something you were blocked for. The reason is an arbitration case against a user named GRider who was banned from editing deletion related pages due to massive and disruptive deletion nominations. The arbitration case is archived at <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_GRider_e674.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/GRider">Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/GRider</a>.</p>
<p>The username you chose, shortly after GRider was blocked permanently was eyeopening since it sounds like "Ban me", while some of the expressions you used (e.g. "allow for organic growth") are rather similar to the terms used by GRider. Therefore your account was blocked as a possible reincarnation, but since GRider was not banned from editing <i>outside</i> deletion related pages, your account was unblocked again.</p>
<p>I am not at all sure that you are the same person that operated the GRider account, but I would recommend that you either convince people that you are not GRider, or that you refrain from editing deletion related pages.</p>
<p>Yours, <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 12:58, 6 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thank you for contacting me and for your comments as well. For well over four months now, I hope that I have been a positive contributor to Wikipedia, as evidenced by my edit history. Although I have little interest in discussing topics which have already been hashed out a hundred times before, I do enjoy volunteering my time towards this project in a number of other ways; be it vetting out inaccuracies within articles, providing CC-licensed and public domain photographic images, tracking changes in voter climate, answering the questions of other editors, or other tasks. Positive organic growth of any article is something we should all be able to rally behind and support, but if you have found any of my edits here to be in any way offensive, please let me know so that I may address the situation as necessary. <a href="../../../b/a/h/User%7EBahn_Mi_d240.html" title="User:Bahn Mi">Bahn Mi</a> 23:21, 6 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I definitely think that your edits to articles, especially the school related articles, in the past months have been positive, valid, good, and definitely not disruptive. I was just expressing my concern with your votes on deletion debates, because if you are the same person as GRider, you are not allowed to vote in them. Personally, I feel that the 1-year ban prohibiting GRider from editing deletion-related pages was about nine months longer than what I think was needed, but the Arbcom's rulings are final. Also, I have noted that schools <i>always</i> get kept anyway, even though my opinion <i>there</i> is that most school articles should be merged with either the location or school district article to provide context. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 09:59, 7 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Bahn. I have actually been considering taking photos of local schools for some time. I think this ia worthy idea and perhaps a sub-project page should be added to the main schoolwatch project page to help facilitate participation in a photo project like this. I know there are a couple of pro-school editors in my city and I'd rather not have duplication of labour (driving to some of these schools will be a waste of time for several people). Let me know what you think.--<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicodemus75_090d.html" title="User:Nicodemus75">Nicodemus75</a> 07:11, 22 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hi, I just noticed your message today. Yes, I do own a digital camera, and have uploaded a couple personal photos (not of schools though). I would like to take some school photos in the future, but probably won't be able to any time soon, but I'll see how that goes. Most likely, when I happen to be near a school, I'll take a photo. I won't be able to drive around and snap pics, nor would I be able to take requests. Of course since I've made most of my city's school articles (and edited the rest), most requests would probably come from myself&#160;:) --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">rob</a> 01:32, 25 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>There isn't a school cabal (really), but if there were, it'd be some users trying to work to replace the shrillness in school AFDs with dialogue, and assert that civility is more important than partisanship. If it existed (and it doesn't, really), it'd be dedicated to getting people to stop sniping and start talking.</p>

<p>Hi, as a regular school editor, I wanted ask if you happen to come across some good sources of notable alumni for different schools, and you can't immediately use it in a school article, you may wish to add info to <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Schools_alumni_f469.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Schools/alumni">Wikipedia:WikiProject Schools/alumni</a> and/or <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Schools_9658.html#Notable_alumni_sources" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Schools">Wikipedia:WikiProject Schools#Notable alumni sources</a>. Often, when looking for famous alums of one school, I find alums of another school, and this is a way to preserve the info; allowing me and others to use it later. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 10:23, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thank you. I really appreciate that compliment and best wishes, coming from a tireless editor in a field that I believe had been neglected and despised until this year.

<p>Hi, in this AFD you said to "keep" if verified. May I ask your opinion, if you feel it is now sufficiently verifiable or not. I would like to wait a little while for verification, and renominate it if none is found. I only wish to do this if there's likely to be consensus that it's not verifiable. So, this is why I would like your opinion. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 02:42, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<td>Thanks for your support in my not-so-recent <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_adminship_Alphachimp_56df.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Alphachimp">RfA</a>, which was successful with a an overwhelmingly flattering and deeply humbling total of 138/2/2 (putting me #10 on the RfA <a href="../../../1/0/0/WP%7E100_d2fb.html" title="WP:100">WP:100</a>). I guess <a href="../../../i/n/f/Infinite_monkey_theorem.html" title="Infinite monkey theorem">infinite monkey theorem</a> has been officially proven. Chimps really can get somewhere on Wikipedia.
<p>With new buttons come great responsibility, and I'll try my best to live up to your expectations. If you need assistance with something, don't hesitate to swing by my <a href="../../../a/l/p/User_talk%7EAlphachimp_9b9e.html" title="User talk:Alphachimp">talk page</a> or <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Alphachimp_c555.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Alphachimp">email me</a> (trust me, I do respond&#160;:)). The same goes for any complaints or comments in regard to my administrative actions. Remember, I'm here for <i>you</i>.</p>
