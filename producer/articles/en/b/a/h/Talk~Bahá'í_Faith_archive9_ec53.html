<h2><span class="mw-headline">Portal Link Placement</span></h2>
<p>I was thinking what the best place for the portal link is. In other pages the portal link is near the top, but if just placed in this article it looks weird, since the template is there as well. At the same time, I don't think the bottom of the page is where it should go. I've tried out different things to put the portal link beside the template, but none of them is perfect. The examples that tired are the following:</p>
<p>Idea #1: Seems to be the best, but has a little extra space at the bottom</p>
<pre>
  &lt;table style="float: right; clear: right; margin: 0 0 1em 1em; text-align:center;"&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td valign="top"&gt;{{portal}}&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;{{Template:Bahá'í}}&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/table&gt;
</pre>
<p>Idea #2: Screws up in small widths, and doesn't work in IE, but works nicely for Firefox</p>
<pre>
  {{Template:Bahá'í}}
  &lt;div style="position: absolute; right:160px; top:490px;"&gt;
    {{portal}}
  &lt;/div&gt;
</pre>
<p>Idea #3: Screws up in small widths, and doesn't work in IE, but works nicely for Firefox</p>
<pre>
  {{Template:Bahá'í}}
  &lt;div style="position: relative; right:12em; top: -62.2em;"&gt;
    {{portal}}
  &lt;/div&gt;

<dd>Why don't we post a "criticisms" section on the Chr!stianity article, hmm? Oh and why don't we mention the historical corruption of the Papacy therein? I am extremely contre-Baha'i, as I believe that priciples from the Abrahamic branch of religions have been claified within it, yet certain dogmas added which are not to my taste. In this mood, I am removing the non-NPOVic criticisms &amp; praises section, and replacing it with a nice in-house link in external references.

<dd>As it stands, the Christianity article does bring up the Crusades, Thirty Years' War, and conflicts with science and feminism. The "persecution" section includes both persecution by, and against, Christians. One problem with many criticisms is that they would be better levelled at particular denominations or families within Xty (priestly child molesting, televangelist scandals). Others are rather obvious (like objections to theism).</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Orthography</span></h2>
<p>Is there a reason why a virtual encyclopedia for all peoples is using specifically Bāhāī orthography in articles pertaining to the Bahāī Faith? Ought not the Bahāī tendency to use the accute accent be replaced with a macron over applicable vowels (thus: "Bahāī" rather than "Bahá'í", "Bahāullāh" rather than "Bahá'u'lláh") to render pronunciation in a more scholarly manner? Otherwise, the page looks like it was written by Bahāīs rather than being neutral. In recognition of their system of orthography, we can state how they write their words: "The Bahāī (rendered as "Bahá'í" by its adherants) Faith is an emerging global religion founded by Bahāullāh (written as "Bahá'u'lláh" by Bahāīs), a nineteenth-century Persian exile. "Bahāī" is either an adjective referring to this religion, or the term for a follower of Bahāullāh." It would make this more NPOV, IMHO.</p>
<dl>
<dd>There used to be a note on the page that stated something like Shoghi Effendi who translated much of the Baha'i writings used a specific transliteration of Arabic and persian which was common at that time. And thus all of the Baha'i writings and references to the Baha'i Faith use that specific orthography, Bahá'í. Following Wikipedia's 'most common' rule, the Baha'i pages use that orthography. Searching for "Bahāī" on google and going through the first 10 pages of Google search I couldn't find a single page that used the Bahāī orthography. -- <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeff3000_72a5.html" title="User:Jeff3000">Jeff3000</a> 00:55, 21 December 2005 (UTC)

<p>Thank you very much for the explanation! Very good reason, then, to keep their system of orthography. I hadn't thought of the Google issue, but it's quite relevant.

<dd>I don't believe so. While the Bahá'í Faith teaches that the only acceptable form of sexual expression is within a marriage between one man and one woman, the Bahá'í writings teach people to treat everyone, including homosexuals, with love, respect, and dignity. So Bahá'ís are taught not to treat homosexuals as condemned outcasts, and are told not to apply the Bahá'í teachings to people who have not accepted Bahá'u'lláh.</dd>
<dd>These teachings have been expounded from multiple compilations that have been released from the Bahá'í World Centre. Now I'm not saying that some Bahá'ís don't do that, and actually have a prejudice against homosexuals, but that is their fault and not in the Bahá'í teachings.</dd>
<dd>The way I see it, is that it's somewhat like the prohibition of alcohol in the teachings, which is unacceptable in the Bahá'í teachings, but that does not make it right for Bahá'ís to be against people who do drink alcohol. The Bahá'ís who have a prejudice against people who are homosexual, I would say, need to follow the Bahá'í teachings more closely. -- <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeff3000_72a5.html" title="User:Jeff3000">Jeff3000</a> 04:17, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Commentary section</span></h2>
<p>This section is no good. Praise and criticism exist but each of them need actors. Also ones praise is another criticism. View the homosexuality issue in the U.S. So, before we start making value judgment we must discuss the Bahai position on issues in a coherent and neutral manner. That means that a bunch of the criticism section should be broken down and explained as law. Not to be cited from primary Bahai sources which are interpretable I believe but they need to be cited from notable doctrinal sources. The law section shouldn't be a list but an explanatory exposition of law with no value judgment. Bahais could kill children and it should be explained in law before it goes into the spinoff critiques of that practice. If you display Bahai doctrine in a way that represents the faith (does <i>every</i> Bahai agree to the majority laws? If so who dissents?) then the reader will make an informed opinion about the faith. The criticism of certain individuals and groups is less important in defining the faith. What they criticize may be bahai practice but their criticism is not a means to reveal what the practice is. The criticism is a layer added onto the practice since the practice is independent of the criticism. An exposé of notable critics is fine... but not the passive voice unsourced section we have now. The same goes for praise... praise should be incorporated into social outreach of the Bahais or be melded into law if applicable. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGrenavitar_5bda.html" title="User:Grenavitar">gren</a> <a href="../../../g/r/e/User_talk%7EGrenavitar_133f.html" title="User talk:Grenavitar">グレン</a> 18:21, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGrenavitar_5bda.html" title="User:Grenavitar">gren</a> for your suggestions. I, taking your advice, have incorporated the statements from the criticism and praise section into the main article. These include
<ul>
<li>prohibition on homosexuality</li>
<li>the shunning of covenant-breakers</li>
<li>Women are barred on the Universal House of Justice</li>
<li>acceptance as a UN NGO</li>
</ul>

<dd>One note, regarding the list of laws. Baha'u'llah appointed his son, `Abdu'l-Baha as the official interpreter of his writings, and `Abdu'l-Baha appointed Shoghi Effendi to be the official interpreter after his death. The laws, which are listed in that section, have been codified by Shoghi Effendi. The small divisions which occured in the Baha'i Faith after Shoghi Effendi's death all believe in those laws. -- <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeff3000_72a5.html" title="User:Jeff3000">Jeff3000</a> 19:29, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ah, I am not sure exactly how it works. If it's an official rule of law (like Catholic catechisms) then it belongs... if it's like the Bible or Qur'an which are interpreted in many and often opposite ways then you can't cite it as law. I just wanted to avoid quoting of the text outside of established context. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGrenavitar_5bda.html" title="User:Grenavitar">gren</a> <a href="../../../g/r/e/User_talk%7EGrenavitar_133f.html" title="User talk:Grenavitar">グレン</a> 19:43, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi Grenavitar, the list of Baha'i laws in the article are the official rule of law in the Baha'i Faith much like the catechisms. They were coded by the official interpreter of Baha'u'llah's writings in the book <i>Synopsys and Codification of the Kitab-i-Aqdas</i> -- <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeff3000_72a5.html" title="User:Jeff3000">Jeff3000</a> 19:57, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I see that Baha'is have been standing by and doing nothing while the "criticisms"--section--which we have discussed ad nauseum--is removed again and again. Is this what Baha'i "consultation" is worth? Yes, I realize that Wikipedia encourages revision, but without this, the site is fundamentally unbalanced. As for the criticism that these are "unsourced" or undiscussed, each (except the last, which I will work on) is linked to a place where it is discussed. What makes them "criticisms" instead of "praises"? The fact that they are commonly given as criticisms (and defended by Baha'is). The fact that outsiders would not be able to guess them is, to my mind, an important reason for including them here.</p>
<p>Another thing: in the previous section, somebody wrote that Baha'is are recognized and respected by almost every country in the world, or somesuch. Hogwash.</p>
<p>And <i>another</i> other thing: Would whoever has been adding prominent links to "Baha'i Faith" to other religious sites, please stop? For instance, somebody keeps adding "...and most recently, the Baha'i Faith" to the list of Abrahamic religions in the first paragraph of <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christianity.html" title="Christianity">Christianity</a>. First of all, nobody except Baha'is do that. Neither Christians, Jews, nor Muslims as a group have much interest in your relationship with them. Second, it's only half true. Think about it--according to your theology, Muhammad is the "seal" of the Semitic line of prophets, which Abraham started. The Bab and Baha'u'llah are outside this.<a href="../../../d/a/w/User%7EDawud_5c1e.html" title="User:Dawud">Dawud</a> 12:22, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Apparently you don't understand the Baha'i understanding of seal of the prophets, which means that the "prophetic cycle" of alluding to the time when symbolic heaven will be on earth is over, and that Baha'u'llah is still a prophet, but has started the "cycle of fulfillment".</dd>
<dd>Secondly Gravitar, an admin, has said that both praise and criticisms are POV, please read his section above. -- <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeff3000_72a5.html" title="User:Jeff3000">Jeff3000</a> 15:51, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It is not so much that Baha'u'llah is or is not a Prophet, is or is not the Fulfillment of prophecy, but rather that both The Bab and Baha'u'llah are descendants of Abraham and claim that lineage (In the same way that Moses, Jesus, and Mohammad claim the lineage). <a href="../../../n/m/e/User%7ENmentha_2159.html" title="User:Nmentha">Nmentha</a> 07:05, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Apparently, Dawud feels that "consultation" means that we are to accommodate <i>him</i> and his POV. A perusal of the archives indicates that people haven't liked the "Criticism" section going back at least to July, 2005. He's the only one who's shoe-horning these in "Baha'i torpedoes be damned". (Wikipdedia sourcing and documentation policies be damned as well apparently.) Dawud's been asked since at least June (Tomhab 12:01, 10 Jun 2005 (UTC)) to provide decent sources. User pages, blogs, etc. are still a problem. <a href="../../../b/a/h/Talk%7EBah%C3%A1%27%C3%AD_Faith_archive5_59eb.html#Recent_Edits_by_210.60.55.8.2FDawud" title="Talk:Bahá'í Faith/archive5">This interchange</a> from June, 2005 is especially enlightening as this has gone on for over six months with at least six other editors trying to get him into line. Is there anyplace to take this for arbitration?</dd>

<dd>Dawud, It's easy to see who's been putting Baha'i links in unusual places. Click the "History" tab and scroll backwards till you see it appear. If there is one person putting these up, take it to an admin. If it's an anonymous user, and it's really out of place (We really aren't "People of the Book", but we are Abrahamic.) then take it out.</dd>

<p>I yield to you on points of Baha'i theology. I forget that in Baha'i-speak, "consultation" means silencing internal critics, not compromise with external ones. You are right--we are not part of any community which obliges us to respect one another's views. God willing, I will never be "in line with" you people.</p>
<p>In order to be balanced, an article must include significant criticisms. You Baha'is, however, have done everything possible to make criticisms less visible. So yes, I do see you as "torpedoes." You're not interested in accuracy, you're interested in whitewashing your religion. Unfortunately there are more of you right now. It's the nature of the topic, I suppose.</p>
<p>Many of the sources you've been calling "blogs" (having discovered that this is apparently grounds for disqualification of otherwise embarrassing material) are actually articles or letters stored on various personal websites. I can't imagine what you think the problem could be, or what you think a "legitimate" source would look like. Surely the problem couldn't be content...?</p>
<p>Who is this "Gren" and what makes you think his views (which I find nearly unintelligible) deserves special deference? If you think the "criticisms" section is too short, then by all means, let's expand it. The original point of the abbreviated section was to alert people to the existence of more such criticism (with sources etc.) on "Baha'i apologetics". As things stand, a reader of this entry might remain oblivious to the dark side of your religion, or fail to make the connection with "apologetics." I'm sure the prospect fills you with horror.<a href="../../../2/1/8/User%7E218.168.241.124.html" title="User:218.168.241.124">218.168.241.124</a> 12:34, 30 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Gren is as admin who works on the Muslim sites, and has worked on how to deal with criticisms on the muslim related pages. The point that he makes is quite important. An encyclopedia is a not a place to have a POV, which having a criticism section is, but instead facts have to be provided, and the reader himself has to make the decision. That is how a page becomes balanced. Before I removed the criticism and praise section, I placed most of the criticisms in the rest of the article. Secondly there is a link to Baha'i apolgetics page, with the word criticisms beside it. -- <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeff3000_72a5.html" title="User:Jeff3000">Jeff3000</a> 15:52, 30 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Now Grenavitar is saying that the criticisms and praises are not good because they are passive-voiced, failing to provide actual criticisers and praisers; and because they are presenting the beliefs and actions in terms of their criticisms and praises instead of presenting them as facts (ie. Bahá'ís believe this, they've done that, etc.) and then presenting the facts that this person or this group of people criticises or praises that belief or action.</dd>

<p>None of the criticisms that were there before remain on the main page. A couple are linked. Thus, of all the controversies which have historically turned inquirers away from your religion, all that is left is a bare mention of the existence of CB groups (without describing shunning), plus links. While few "seekers" would be attracted to CB sects, many would balk at joining a religion that practiced the policies which were formerly described under "criticisms".</p>
<p>Expulsions, by the way, are different from "divisions" since most expellees do not go on to start their own rival Baha'i group.</p>
<p>Why would criticisms be considered POV on the main page, but allowed on the "apologetics" page? (Other than because you've made it into a dumping ground for such things.) But I find this whole line of reasoning ridiculous. Imagine <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientology.html" title="Scientology">Scientology</a> with no mention of criticisms--how neutral would that be?--Dawud</p>
<dl>
<dd>I just took a quick glance at the Scientology page, and I would favour that page being reframed in such a way that the bullets and issues in the Controversy and criticism section be stated within the rest of the article as Grenavitar suggests. I'll try to bring it up in their talk pages in the next couple days. Also please look above with the criticims that I have included on this page. And you're right that "criticisms" is not the right word for Apologetics either, because that is POV. The way that Apologetics is framed is non-POV and I would better describe it as "Issues." -- <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeff3000_72a5.html" title="User:Jeff3000">Jeff3000</a> 16:09, 1 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>It's been awhile now, and I see a disturbing pattern at work. It goes like this: Some Baha'i erases something critical of their religion. We spend weeks discussing whether, and how, criticisms should be incorporated. The article left behind lacks the criticisms in question. I begin to suspect that this is an intentional strategy.</p>
<p>I propose that in the future, criticisms should STAY UP while we discuss whether and how to change them. Otherwise the Baha'is among us have no incentive to compromse. 218.167.174.135 12:36, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Everybody but you Dawud believes that the criticisms are POV. Grenavitar a muslim didn't think they should be here, Chrevedesante, a homosexual, felt that they should not be here. Given that wikipedia should be NPOV, I will again remove the criticism section. The fact that Homosexuality is not allowed is in the article, the fact that covenant-breakers are shunned are in the article, the fact that women are not allowed in the Universal House of Justice is in the article. What's not in the article is Baha'i review and the expulsions which don't fit anywhere in particle and which even Grenavitar said are not that important. -- <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeff3000_72a5.html" title="User:Jeff3000">Jeff3000</a> 13:58, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>We should seek the best NPOV article rather than a compromise that averages the more extreme positions expressed here. It is appropriate for controversial issues to be raised in this main article, but only briefly, with links to articles that discuss the issues more fully elsewhere. As many of the Pro and Con issues raised under criticisms are POV, perhaps it would be best to refer to the whole subject as "Controversies" rather than Criticisms. Likewise high profile support for the Baha'i Faith from respected sources should be mentioned briefly too, if only to provide balance. --<a href="../../../o/c/c/User%7EOccamy_964a.html" title="User:Occamy">Occamy</a> 22:28, 6 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I agree with you on a good bit of this, but "Controversies" would not be accurate unless all topics under the heading actually were controversies. Most of these really are criticisms. Bahá'ís have beliefs about, for instance, homosexuality that some groups disagree with and sometimes criticise the Bahá'ís about.

<dd>I agree with Occamy, there is no room for compromise, especially not in the Baha'i teachings, rather, it is always preferable to have the best NPOV article rather than a compromise between extremes. A compromise could lead downgrading the quality and neutrality of the work. Remember that NPOV does not mean "middle way". I would also like to make a note that NPOV does not mean that something true and verifiable has to be countered by the opposite. If something is true and verifiable, then it does not matter whether it sounds bias or not. Ultimately, NPOV is necessary for the purpose of determining whether something actually happened and whether it is true or not. <a href="../../../n/m/e/User%7ENmentha_2159.html" title="User:Nmentha">Nmentha</a> 07:19, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I agree with LambaJan, these are not controversies, but indeed criticisms by certain groups of people that have different views on certain aspects of the Baha'i Faith compared to most Baha'is. For example, Baha'is believe that homosexuality is against the laws of God for those that are Baha'is, and many others would consider that not progressive for a relatively new religion. These are different points of views on the subject of homosexuality and the Baha'i Faith. The important thing is to include the fact in the article, which is that homosexuality is not seen as correct in the Baha'i Faith, and let the reader decide for himself if that is ok, or if it is not ok, and thus be critical. This is what NPOV means, as Grenavitar explained above. The same goes for the so called unenrollements/resignations; the Covenant and the form of Baha'i administration come from Baha'i writings which many Baha'is see as authoritative, which gives them certain powers such as instilling Baha'i review. Other people believe that the Baha'i administration is going over their powers, and thus criticize it. Again both of these aspects have a POV, and thus a NPOV statement could be included about what happened, but not assign it a connotation of "right" or "wrong" and let the reader decide.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>BTW, a praise section is also POV. For example some people might praise the Baha'i Faith for its SED projects across the world, and others would state that they are not doing enough. So, the way to make it NPOV, would be to say that Baha'is have the following SED projects, and not connect it with praise. -- <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeff3000_72a5.html" title="User:Jeff3000">Jeff3000</a> 04:54, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It would be nice if this article included information about why Baha'i houses of worship cannot accept donations from non-Baha'i's. I don't know, so I can't include it. But here's the reason for my question: a nice Baha'i house of worship near where I grew up was doing some major renovations. I had fond memories of it and the people there from my childhood so I wanted to give them a donation toward the work. (I don't think there is a Catholic church in the world that would refuse a donation like that for the "new roof" fund.) But I was told that it was a tenet of the Baha'i faith that donations from outsiders cannot be accepted. <a href="../../../c/r/y/User%7ECrypticfirefly_6711.html" title="User:Crypticfirefly">Crypticfirefly</a> 06:20, 14 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well actually its all Baha'i funds. Giving to the fund is one of the "privileges" of being a Baha'i. In fact, I think it largely has a practical aspect - making sure any donations do not have any political sway (politics is a mini Baha'i swear word). Also I think it promotes the idea that Baha'is are impeccably honest - closer to the idea of the Guardian that Baha'is would be moral "shining lamps" in the future.

<dd>Tomhab is right, funds are not solicited or accepted from people who are not Baha'is for any Baha'i fund. There's a couple reasons for this:
<ul>
<li>Giving to the fund is a spiritual act for Baha'is and enhances unity in the community</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd><i>"Giving to the Fund, therefore, is a spiritual privilege, not open to those who have not accepted Bahá'u'lláh, of which no believer should deny himself. It is both a responsibility and a source of bounty. This is an aspect of the Cause which, we feel, is an essential part of the basic teaching and deepening of new believers. The importance of contributing resides in the degree of sacrifice of the giver, the spirit of devotion with which the contribution is made and the unity of the friends in this service; these attract the confirmations of God and enhance the dignity and self-respect of the individuals and the community."</i>

<ul>
<li>Donations from people who are not Baha'is could at times be used to request something back in return. (i.e. it could be political, and Baha'is as Tomhab individated. Baha'is see the current political sphere as very divisive, and not conducive to the unity within the community, and thus accept or advocated any political position.):</li>

<dd><i>"He wishes me to stress again that under no circumstances the believers should accept any financial help from non-Bahá'ís for use in connection with specific administrative activities of the Faith such as the Temple construction fund, and other local or national Bahá'í administrative funds. The reasons for this is twofold: First because the institutions which the Bahá'ís are gradually building are in the nature of gifts from Bahá'u'lláh to the world; and secondly the acceptance of funds from non-believers for specific Bahá'í use would, sooner or later, involve the Bahá'ís into unforseen and difficulties with other, and thus cause incalculable harm to the body of the Cause."</i>

<dd>Funds are accepted however for humanitarian projects that the Baha'is are involved in:
<dl>
<dd><i>"The crucial point in deciding whether or not funds may be accepted from non-Bahá'ís for funds, it sometimes happens that a person who has a great know, it is absolutely forbidden in the Faith to accept from non-Bahá'ís contributions towards the work of the Cause itself. However, in addition to the work of spreading the Faith and establishing its institutions, Spiritual Assemblies also engage in humanitarian activities, and contributions from non-Bahá'í sources may be accepted towards such activities. Indeed, although we never ask individual non-Bahá'ís for funds, it sometimes happens that a person who has a great admiration for the Faith insists on contributing. In such a case the contribution may be accepted, with the express provision that it will be used only for charitable and humanitarian purposes."</i>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Italicizing quotes — a personal gripe</span></h2>
<p>Generally speaking quotes are not italicized. This is a long-standing and bad habit of some Bahá'í publishers and has crept into the style of these articles. My old copy of <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turabian.html" title="Turabian">Turabian</a> says that italics are used wherever one would underline with a typewriter. (Yup, I'm <i>that</i> old.) My old <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strunk_%26_White_ea2b.html" title="Strunk &amp; White">Strunk &amp; White</a> and the <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia%7EManual_of_Style_350a.html#Quotations" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style">Wikipedia MOS</a> both follow suit. (Yup, that old: I know how to play Bridge.)</p>
<p>I've just finished up the reprint of the old US-NSA's <a href="http://www.bahairesources.com/products.php?id=1967" class="external text" title="http://www.bahairesources.com/products.php?id=1967" rel="nofollow"><i>Comprehensive Deepening Program</i></a> and they <i>italicized every-last quoted word</i>. It's a fabulous book, and dirt cheap. (I wish I'd read it years ago, but I'm not <i>that</i> old.) I'm intending to use it as a foundation for junior-youth classes. But the italics made my teeth itch at every turn.</p>
<p>So, in addition to giving you insights into me you'd rather <i>not</i> have, accept my apologies in advance if you see my edits eliminating these. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMARussellPESE_d65e.html" title="User:MARussellPESE">MARussellPESE</a> 14:50, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The NSA is following Shoghi Effendi's style (Dispensation of Baha'u'llah). While it might not be correct on paper, I find it enhances readbility on the screen by differentiating what is a quote and what is not. There are many differences between what is appropriate on paper, and what is appropriate on screen. My personal preference is to keep the quotes italicized. -- <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeff3000_72a5.html" title="User:Jeff3000">Jeff3000</a> 14:59, 25 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I admit that I have put quotes on wiki in perhaps 5 different formats. I usually do whatever looks best, and I haven't found any standards in wikipedia guidelines. Recently I've used the format of indenting a quote, adding the double apostrophes (") on both ends, and italicizing the whole quote, followed by a source double indented in brackets, like this:
<dl>
<dd>"<i>There was an old woman who swallowed a fly. I don't know why she swallowed a fly. I guess she'll die.</i>"

<p>Jeff3000, could you provide reference for the Guardian's preferred usage. (Was this a decision of his?) Near as I can tell this is a US NSA convention. And, at least on <i>Ocean</i> they're in quotes in <i>Dispensation</i>. (I've gotta look at a hard-copy.)</p>
<p>Ergonomically, I find them very hard to read — especially in the san-serif font wikpedia defaults to.</p>

<dd>I don't know if it was his personal preference, but printed versions of Dispensation of Baha'u'llah, World Order of Baha'u'llah, Advent of Divine Justice, and Promised Day has Come all use italics for quotations from the Holy Writings, and don't use italics for quotations from other sources.

I reviewed <i>The World Order of Baha'u'llah</i>, the Q&amp;A section of the <i>Kitáb-i-Aqdas</i> and others, and all use the italics for quoting the Texts as Jeff3000's pointed out.

<dd>In the archives this issue was hashed out for a long time. The discussion was ended by demonstrating several places where the term "Baha'i Faith" is legally determined to be the House of Justice in Haifa. The entire point was to avoid confusion, and in 1966 Mason Remey's group was forced in a court to adopt a name other than "Baha'i Faith". I think having the disambiguation link and linking to the divisions page once or twice is relevant in passing, but Andrew is correct to say that their value was outweighted on the page relative to their size and importance. <a href="../../../c/u/n/User%7ECunado19_ff71.html" title="User:Cunado19"><font color="#D14C04"><b>Cuñado</b></font></a> <a href="../../../b/a/h/Image%7EBahaitemplatestar.png_81d9.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/1/1d/Bahaitemplatestar.png/20px-Bahaitemplatestar.png" alt="" width="20" height="19" longdesc="../../../b/a/h/Image%7EBahaitemplatestar.png_81d9.html" /></a> - <a href="../../../c/u/n/User_talk%7ECunado19_98ea.html" title="User talk:Cunado19"><font size="-3">Talk</font></a> 17:25, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Can I clarify the point I was trying to make. I agree that this article should be concerned with the mainstream Baha'i Faith and not any breakaway group. However, the concept of "covenant-breaking" is an important issue when looking at the Baha'i Faith. It is referred to extensively in Baha'i scriptures and other texts. I have heard it many times being raised in Baha'i Conferences and letters from the House. I can't see how you can read the Will and Testament of Abdul-Baha and say that the issue is "not important". This section should be a summary of what is stated in the main article and at the moment does not include reference to an important element. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewRT_eb6f.html" title="User:AndrewRT">AndrewRT</a> 21:32, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I just wanted to state a reminder that 500 prophets in the next 500,000 years does not imply that there will be one every 1,000 years. There could be periods without them and some with more than one. Even the prophecy regarding the next Manifestation of God states 'no less than a thousand years' for all we know, it could be more than just equal to a thousand years. It is safer to simply state no more or no less than what is in the writings. <a href="../../../n/m/e/User%7ENmentha_2159.html" title="User:Nmentha">Nmentha</a> 06:07, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Relation to other religions</li>
<li>Demographics</li>
<li>Teachings</li>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I think "demographics" should remain first, because it gives the scope and spread of the religion. The "calendar" move is fine, and I think the "other religions" section could go after "teachings", but not at the bottom. <a href="../../../c/u/n/User%7ECunado19_ff71.html" title="User:Cunado19"><font color="#D14C04"><b>Cuñado</b></font></a> <a href="../../../b/a/h/Image%7EBahaitemplatestar.png_81d9.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/1/1d/Bahaitemplatestar.png/20px-Bahaitemplatestar.png" alt="" width="20" height="19" longdesc="../../../b/a/h/Image%7EBahaitemplatestar.png_81d9.html" /></a> - <a href="../../../c/u/n/User_talk%7ECunado19_98ea.html" title="User talk:Cunado19"><font size="-3">Talk</font></a> 22:37, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>The new sectioning I suggested was inspired nmostly by the article <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hinduism.html" title="Hinduism">Hinduism</a> (also an FA). An article about a religion or an ideology should feature its core concepts first. I think readers will be interested in finding out <b>What</b> is Bahá'í Faith before examining its spread. Plus all religions article have "Beliefs", "concept" or "ideology" as their first section (see <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christianity.html" title="Christianity">Christianity</a>, <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam.html" title="Islam">Islam</a>, <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hinduism.html" title="Hinduism">Hinduism</a>, <a href="../../../b/u/d/Buddhism.html" title="Buddhism">Buddhism</a>...). I don't really care about the other sections, just why is "Relation to other religions" the first section? doesn't it come with "Involvement in society" as consequence? So shouldn't it be at the end of the article? Finally, why is the image of the Universal House of Justice put at the top of the article? Is it a holy place or a core concept or a symbol of the faith?

<dd>The reason why "Relation to other religions" is at the top, as I mentioned before, is because it is one of the core teachings of the Baha'i Faith, see <a href="../../../p/r/o/Progressive_revelation.html" title="Progressive revelation">Progressive revelation</a>. The Covenent which is also in that section is of utmost importance. The reason why the Universal House of Justice is at the top is to differentiate the "Baha'i Faith", which is a trademark, which represents the Baha'is that have their administration in Haifa, from the other smaller groups that follow Baha'u'llah; this article is about the largest group. Regarding the demographics section I still think it needs to be at the top due to the obscurity of the Baha'i Faith to the general public; most people don't know about it and the demographics section makes it clear that it is not a sect/cult but a global religion, which is what all the teachings of the Baha'i Faith talk about. -- <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeff3000_72a5.html" title="User:Jeff3000">Jeff3000</a> 16:23, 8 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Regarding the demographics section, if you want to make it clear that this faith is not a small sect, you should instead put a little information (maybe the number of followers) in the introduction. As for the photo, my reason of moving it down is because it's misleading. When I first read the article (I didn't know anything about Baha'i) seeing first the picture, I thought it was like a sanctuary or a holy place, a because of its location, I thought it had to do with Israel or Judaism (Much like the Qabaa of Islam is located in their holy city Mecca). I prefer it to be moved down to avoid such misconceptions, and it would be more relevant next to the paragraph that describes it. As for the "Relation to other religions", I understand that the "Distinction" and "The convenant" subsection are very important, by what does this faith ideology has to do with its persecution? I even think it's POV to feature at the top of a religion-article this kind of section. I insist that the "Persecution" part should go at the end of the article. I also suggest that the sections "Distinction", "The Covenant", "Teachings" and maybe "Laws" and "Current plans and focus" should go together and not be separated since they all go under the big title of "Baha'i faith ideology or beliefs or concept" (name it as you like). <a href="../../../c/e/d/User%7ECedar-Guardian_25dc.html" title="User:Cedar-Guardian">CG</a> 17:37, 8 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I can now argue only about style issues. The image looks bad in the intro, it is large compared to the very thin box template below it. It's not a very strong argument, but since you made clear in the intro which community this article deals with, the image would really be better in the section talking about it. <a href="../../../c/e/d/User%7ECedar-Guardian_25dc.html" title="User:Cedar-Guardian">CG</a> 16:27, 9 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I disagree, any photo in the intro will have a wider aspect ratio that the template, and thus will look the same (and anyways I don't think it looks bad).

I would really like to see a nice picture here right at the top, but the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canada</a> article provides a very nice example with the template at the top and then a metric-ton of pictures. I'm not so sure that the Seat is the best picture at the top. How about the entrance to the Shrine of <a href="../../../b/a/h/Bah%C3%A1%27u%27ll%C3%A1h.html" title="Bahá'u'lláh">Bahá'u'lláh</a> or the Shrine of the Báb down the page? I don't think that we need to differentiate the 5M followers from the 1k others by putting the Seat at the top of the article.

<dd>I like Jeff's third photo, or perhaps a clearer nicer version of that shot if we can find one. I also like the picture of the Universal House of Justice (there might also be a nicer-clearer picture but anyways). However, I would like to raise issue with something that was stated above. This is concerning distinguishing the Baha'i Faith with other "followers of Baha'u'llah". Any objective observer who, with an eye of neutrality, reads the Baha'i scriptures, will know that being a follower of Baha'u'llah is contingent upon keeping His Covenant. Keeping His Covenant is contingent upon remaining united and following the lineage of succession from Baha'u'llah, which was very clearly followed through Abdu'l-Baha, and then since Abdu'l-Baha's brother had broken the Covenant, it went very clearly to the Gaurdianship of Shoghi Effendi. Based on the laws of Baha'u'llah and the Will and Testament of Abdu'l-Baha, it was very clear that the Universal House of Justice had to be formed. It was also very clear...to all but one individual...that there would not be a second Guardian. Even that individual had agreed than none had been appointed by Shoghi Effendi. According to the laws of Baha'u'llah, when a decision is reached by majority (in this case by all the appointed Hands of the Cause, and 9 elected Custodians, except for one individual) that decision is supposed to be followed through with full support and effort by all members. This is a principle of consultation and a requirement of the Covenant. This amoung several other things led to the expulsion of Covenant-breakers. Any objective scholar also knows that among the many definitions of a Baha'i is to follow the laws of the Manifestation of God. Included in this is the House of Justice which is to guide the Baha'is of the World. Devoid of any one of these laws or parameters, it is impossible to be considered a follower of Baha'u'llah. Whether one considers Himself a follower or not is up to them. However, the definition of a follower of Baha'u'llah is defined within the legislative scope of the House of Justice. Therefore, these other alleged groups are not followers of Baha'u'llah, they are something else. This may sound pro-Baha'i, but it is not meant to be...it is solely based on the parameters set forth by the Founder of the Faith. If the Founder says, that one is not His follower if they do or follow certain things contrary to His teachings, then who are we to say that someone is. <a href="../../../n/m/e/User%7ENmentha_2159.html" title="User:Nmentha">Nmentha</a> 06:36, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>True enough, and your argument is backed up, at least in part, by certain law cases (such as the use of the name "National Spiritual Assembly" in the US - I'll find a reference if you really need it), but since there are non-"Haifan" Baha'i groups still around, there are still several thousand people who disagree with you. The easiest way to sum up "NPOV" is something everybody agrees with.</dd>

<p>For the same reason that you got confused about what the religion represents, is why the first part of the article needs a "demographics" and "relation to other religions". Those first two sections are an extension of the introduction, and necessary since more than half of the people in the world have never heard of the Baha'i Faith. However, I agree that some of the contents of the "other religions" section could be moved, since they don't all address that subject, but "persecution" does, since it deals directly with the relation to the Islamic world.</p>
<p>The demographics section can't be replaced with a mention in the intro, because there is more than a sentence, and the issue of how many Baha'is there are in the world has been a huge debate, and needs a careful explanation. See <a href="../../../b/a/h/Baha%27i_statistics.html" title="Baha'i statistics">Baha'i statistics</a>.</p>

<dd>The page as it stands right now seems a little funny. I'm thinking of expanding the section after the intro into a section about what is now called the Three Onenesses, and the distinction and relation to other religions can fit into that.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Baha'i Teachings and NPOV</span></h2>
<p>When we describe Baha'i teachings it can be difficult to achieve a neutral point of view, and we need to make a particular effort. This doesn't mean that Baha'i teachings should not be fully and accurately described. What it means is that, when teachings are described, we must take account of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Positive and negative impact of teachings</li>
<li>The effect of teachings in practice</li>
<li>Any internal contradictions / tensions within the body of teachings</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, the Baha'i Faith teaches tolerance, but this doesn't extend to accepting practicing homsexuality. We shouldn't make bland statements about tolerance without having a more detailed, and critical, evaluation of what that means in practice.</p>
<p>Another example, Baha'i Faith teaches about the unity of religion - all religion comes from the same source. Yet it also says that the teachings within the New Testament have been superceded and that the Old Testament was factually wrong about certain details - e.g. Isaac being the sacrificial lamb.</p>
<p>This is what I understand by NPOV in this context. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewRT_eb6f.html" title="User:AndrewRT">AndrewRT</a> 12:15, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The positive and negative impact of teachings is definitely POV. Just state the teaching, and people can come up with what they believe is a positive or negative. For example, state that Homosexuality is not allowed in the Baha'i Faith (as it is in the article), and people can regard that to be positive or negative (they come up with their own POV). Putting the impact is a POV because I'm sure there are many people who would consider the impact as good, and others bad. Regarding Homosexuality, the Baha'i teachings don't go against tolerance; much of the statements released by the House and the NSA of the US (compilations of writings) clearly indicate that Baha'is should not discriminate against Baha'is or non-Baha'is that are homosexual. For example:
<dl>
<dd>"They (homosexuals) should be treated just like any other people seeking admittance to the Faith, and be accepted on the same basis. Our teachings, as outlined in “The Advent of Divine Justice” on the subject of living a chaste life, should be emphasized to them just as to every other applicant, but certainly no ruling whatsoever should be laid down in this matter. The Bahá'ís have certainly not yet reached that stage of moral perfection where they are in a position to too harshly scrutinize the private lives of other souls, and each individual should be accepted on the basis of his faith, and sincere willingness to try to live up to the Divine standards"
<dl>
<dd>(On behalf of Shoghi Effendi to a National Spiritual Assembly, 11 April 1948)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>"This law is no reason for Bahá’ís to consider homosexuals as outcasts. If they are not Bahá’ís there is also no reason to expect them to obey the Bahá’í law in this respect any more than we would expect a non-Bahá’í to abstain from drinking alcohol. (16 March 1992)
<dl>
<dd>(Letters of The Universal House of Justice, 5 June 1993, Homosexuality, p. 11)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Thus the Baha'i teaching of tolerance exists towards homosexuals. It's another thing if some Baha'is don't follow it, but some Baha'is also drink. We as other Baha'is cannot criticise the individual lives of other Baha'is (either in performing homosexual acts, or in not being tolerant of homosexuals), so we just state the teachings; tolerance is one of them (towards everyone), and chastity is another (which includes heterosexuality). There is no contradiction in them.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Regarding the statement "Baha'i Faith teaches about the unity of religion - all religion comes from the same source. Yet it also says that the teachings within the New Testament have been superceded and that the Old Testament was factually wrong about certain details" again I do not see anything that is contracticted in the Baha'i writings. Baha'u'llah clearly writes that was is appropriate in one time and place may not be appropriate in another, and thus that is one of the main teachings of Baha'u'llah as expounded by Shoghi Effendi in <i>Dispensation of Baha'u'llah</i> that religion is progressive and changes. That does not mean that what was appropriate before was wrong at that time and place, and may even be factually incorrect because it was better understood that way at the time. Baha'u'llah clearly states that each manifestation Doeth Whatever He Willeth, and it is not for us to criticize their motives and reasons for giving those teachings and statements at those times.

<dd>My point is that an article about an object writes about that object, and not what some people think about that object. This is NPOV, because facts are written about and not opinions. (In this article facts related to what are the Baha'i teachings because it's an article about the Baha'i Faith). Where multiple views about facts are at issue that is when both views should be presented and that is the case in this article. For example some Baha'is don't follow the UHJ, and that is indicated in the article. People thinking that Baha'is are not tolerant of homosexuals because homosexuality is forbidden in the Baha'i teachings is not a fact about the Baha'i Faith, it is a view of it, and is thus POV. People thinking that the idea of Progressive Relevation is stupid and there are problems with it (which there may well be) is an opinion, but what is a fact is that the Baha'i teachings (which this page is about) teaches that there is progressive revelation. The reader does not have to agree with it, but the article should be on what the Baha'i Faith states. -- <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeff3000_72a5.html" title="User:Jeff3000">Jeff3000</a> 19:59, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">diacritics</span></h2>
<p>A conversation was going on at <a href="../../../b/a/h/Talk%7EBah%C3%A1%27%C3%AD_orthography_27fa.html" title="Talk:Bahá'í orthography">Talk:Bahá'í orthography</a>, which I would like to propose here. It involves the issue of the proper transliteration of Arabic names on the Baha'i pages. Basically, there are four levels of transliterating Arabic, and most Baha'i books use the highest level of transliteration, which is common among academics, and standardized by Shoghi Effendi. At this level, a reader could take the English word and render perfectly the original Arabic. At the lowest level, most of the useful information is lost, but it's much easier to type and use for electronic purposes. I'll use <a href="../../../%60/a/b/%60Abdu%27l-Bah%C3%A1_f3c9.html" title="`Abdu'l-Bahá">`Abdu'l-Bahá</a> as an example, to show the levels.</p>
<p>1. Best - <big><big><big>‘</big>Abdu<big>’</big>l-Bahá</big></big> - notice that those are not apostrophes (<big><big><big>'</big></big></big>) or grave accents (<big><big><big>`</big></big></big>) which are located on the keyboard, but they are located on the clickable characters beneath the edit window. This level would also include underscores and dots ( Ḥají Á<u>kh</u>únd )<br />
2. Just as good - <big><big><big>`</big>Abdu<big>'</big>l-Bahá</big></big> - using the apostrophe and grave accent, which are on the keyboard. Without underscores and dots.<br />
3. lazy - <big>`Abdu'l-Baha</big> - ignoring the accents above long vowels. All characters are found on the keyboard.<br />
4. electronic - <big>Abdul-Baha</big> - ignoring accents and apostrophes.<br />
5. Other - a combination of these.</p>
<p>The only available <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28Arabic%29_c7cd.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (Arabic)">wiki standard</a> is only a proposal, and itself is unclear.</p>
<p>As far as I can tell, there are three places where these can be applied separately, that is the page title, the introductory paragraph, and the rest of the page. For example, a page title could use one form, another form could be used once alongside the original Arabic, and another form could be used in the article. Currently the first three forms are used throughout all of the Baha'i articles. Jeff3000 and I both agree that a change is in order. I suggest we vote for consensus. <a href="../../../c/u/n/User%7ECunado19_ff71.html" title="User:Cunado19"><font color="#D14C04"><b>Cuñado</b></font></a> <a href="../../../b/a/h/Image%7EBahaitemplatestar.png_81d9.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/1/1d/Bahaitemplatestar.png/20px-Bahaitemplatestar.png" alt="" width="20" height="19" longdesc="../../../b/a/h/Image%7EBahaitemplatestar.png_81d9.html" /></a> - <a href="../../../c/u/n/User_talk%7ECunado19_98ea.html" title="User talk:Cunado19"><font size="-3">Talk</font></a> 07:17, 17 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'd like to note that the academic standards on transliteration have evolved. The one that Bahá'ís use was at one time the standard but it isn't anymore. I do prefer ours, but I'm used to it.

<dd>You're right. See <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arabic_transliteration.html" title="Arabic transliteration">Arabic transliteration</a> for more on standards.

<dd>Having critical views in an article is not necessarily NPOV. The article is about the Baha'i Faith and has what people can consider both positive and negative apsects of it (i.e. Homosexuality, shunning of covenant-breakers, women not being on the House of justice). Things are justed stated, and people make up their own opinion on what they believe is good or bad. This is not like an article on Heaven or Hell where Heaven and Hell cannot be seen and thus there are different ideas of what Heaven and Hell is, it is an article on the Baha'i Faith, and thus it must indicate what the Baha'i Faith is, and not views on it. Please go see the <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam.html" title="Islam">Islam</a> article to see that no views (critical or non-critical) are in it. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGrenavitar_5bda.html" title="User:Grenavitar">Gren</a> who has dealth with what is NPOV on the Islam page has commented that "So, before we start making value judgment we must discuss the Bahai position on issues in a coherent and neutral manner. That means that a bunch of the criticism section should be broken down and explained as law." and that is what has happened. The criticisms include that Homosexuality is not allowed (included in the article), that Covenant-breakers are shunned (included in the article) that women are not allowed to be elected in the article (included) that there are divisions which go against the Covenant (included), that there are different numbers for the number of members (included), that the Baha'i Faith was a schism from the Babi Faith (included). So in a couple hours I will remove the NPOV tag as the criticisms are already in the article. -- <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeff3000_72a5.html" title="User:Jeff3000">Jeff3000</a> 13:40, 24 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Jdemarcos, the point is that through consensus the editors of the Islam page (both muslim and non-muslim, protagonists and antogonists) have determined what NPOV is regarding an article on religion; the page states what the religion teaches, and not what other people think about the religion, and the criticisms are included as facts, and not POVs. If you can show me anything that is factually wrong about the article go ahead and change the article, but everything in the article is true, has been referenced, and furthermore the criticisms are included as facts and not POVs. The style and tone of this page follows the Islam article, which has been agreed upon by consensus. If you don't agree, you should bring it up on the Islam talk page. The burden on not on me to change the consensus, because I agree with the consensus. You don't agree with it, and thus you shouldbring it up on the Islam talk page. The criticisms are included in this page, and there is nothing factually wrong with the content of this page, and thus I'm taking down the NPOV tag -- <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeff3000_72a5.html" title="User:Jeff3000">Jeff3000</a> 14:34, 24 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The article is a accurate representation of the Baha'i Faith and what it stands for and, as such, is NPOV. It has been subject to vigorous editorial debate, which is good. However, to be truly NPOV, this and similar articles should display a clear link to sub-articles that discuss what some may perceive as "problem" issues. Surely I am not alone in seeking contrary viewpoints (and the mainstream responses) when reading up on sensitive or controversial subjects? As the article stands, the only visible link to contrary viewpoints is the *<a href="../../../b/a/h/Bah%C3%A1%27%C3%AD_apologetics.html" title="Bahá'í apologetics">Bahá'í apologetics</a> under the See Also heading.

<dd>Occamy, I am currently reviewing the article to increase its neutrality, please feel free to include your own editing as well. Sometimes it is more of a matter of removing the brochure-like style of some paragraphs and add contextual information or a more distanced evaluation of facts and doctrines. --<a href="../../../j/d/e/User%7EJdemarcos_a961.html" title="User:Jdemarcos">Jdemarcos</a> 16:10, 24 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Jdemarcos, it might help to know that we had a bad experience with an editor who constantly put his personal opinion in as facts. He kept changing the worldwide figures to 2 million and then quoted his personal experience as a reference. He created a page called "Criticism of the Baha'i Faith", which was rightfully voted for deletion as very POV. He then waged a campaign of adding a list of why the Baha'i Faith is wrong and corrupt, and used web blogs as sources. Then he requested that Baha'is stop editing his section and claimed that it's a big Baha'i conspiracy.</p>
<p>I think your edits were very reasonable and only improved the article. <a href="../../../c/u/n/User%7ECunado19_ff71.html" title="User:Cunado19"><font color="#D14C04"><b>Cuñado</b></font></a> <a href="../../../b/a/h/Image%7EBahaitemplatestar.png_81d9.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/1/1d/Bahaitemplatestar.png/20px-Bahaitemplatestar.png" alt="" width="20" height="19" longdesc="../../../b/a/h/Image%7EBahaitemplatestar.png_81d9.html" /></a> - <a href="../../../c/u/n/User_talk%7ECunado19_98ea.html" title="User talk:Cunado19"><font size="-3">Talk</font></a> 17:45, 24 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Subh-i-Azal in this page</span></h2>
<p>Subh-i-Azal does not belong in this page. He is not a figure in the Baha'i Faith, but of the Babi Faith. The Bab, however, has a central role for Baha'is, as Baha'is believe he foretold of the Baha'u'llah and in that spirit he is included as a central figure (and that is why he is in the page, as one who Baha'i claim foretold of the coming of Baha'u'llah). You might believe that it should not be the case, and Baha'is should see Subh-i-Azal as a central figure, but I don't believe you'll find a verifiable source that states that Baha'is (not Babis) see him as a central figure. As for the Bab, I would say almost all sources state that he is a central figure for Baha'is.

<dd>I disagree. As of now the treatment of Mirza Yahya here is brief and highlights the time period of the greatest tension between the two. This episode was a significant crisis in the religion's history as the community was in transition. Its mention does not give <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html#Undue_weight" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">undue weight</a> in my opinion. However, that mention should not be any more than in passing as Jeff3000 is right, he made no contribution to the Bahá'í Faith. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMARussellPESE_d65e.html" title="User:MARussellPESE">MARussellPESE</a> 15:06, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>He is mentioned in the article in the Baha'u'llah section. What I meant that having him as a subsection like Wjhonson's edit is not appropriate, because he is not a central figure in the Baha'i Faith as the Bab, Baha'u'llah and Abdu'l-Baha are. I don't disagree that more mention of him can be made in either the Bab or Baha'u'llah section, I disagree with making a complete new section for him, as he did not help develop the Baha'i Faith as the four others (I'm including Baha'i administration here) did. -- <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeff3000_72a5.html" title="User:Jeff3000">Jeff3000</a> 15:09, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My bad Jeff. I'd not looked at the article history to see that Wjhonson had added an <b>entire section</b> on him. That's well wide of the mark. Azal was <i>never</i> considered a "leader" in the Bahá'í Faith. He was rarely even considered an effective one in the Babi faith either, but that's a discussion for his page. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMARussellPESE_d65e.html" title="User:MARussellPESE">MARussellPESE</a> 15:42, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sorry these sections are on the History of the movement. He was indeed the leader for 16 years, undisputed, as standard Baha'i texts (if you'll just read them) make clear. The fact that you don't want to read them, is not my concern. He was the leader of the Baha'is as much as the Bab was and so belongs in this section about the leaders of the movement. If you only want to list the leaders of the Baha'is proper, then you should remove the Bab as he was not a leader of the Baha'is either. If this section is about the leadership of the Movement, then he belongs here as much as the Bab does. <a href="../../../w/j/h/User%7EWjhonson_d987.html" title="User:Wjhonson">Wjhonson</a> 02:19, 31 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Wjhonson said "<b>as standard Baha'i texts make clear</b>". Baha'i sources indicate that Baha'u'llah was in fact the leader of the community all along. The appointment of Azal was to distract the authorities, and when Baha'u'llah left for two years the community fell apart. Subh-i-Azal was supported in every way by Mirza Musa and Baha'u'llah, both spiritually and financially. An expansion of his role should be dealt with in Baha'i/Babi split, or the Subhi-i-Azal page, but no Baha'i text considers him a major figure in the Faith, except for his role in being a Covenant-breaker. You can call it what you want, but an expansion of his role in this page is giving undue weight to anti-Baha'i polemic.</p>
<p>Currently the article states that he was the appointed leader of the Babis and that there were tensions between him and Baha'u'llah. This is in a section that gives hardly any detail about Baha'u'llah's own life. <a href="../../../c/u/n/User%7ECunado19_ff71.html" title="User:Cunado19"><font color="#D14C04"><b>Cuñado</b></font></a> <a href="../../../b/a/h/Image%7EBahaitemplatestar.png_81d9.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/1/1d/Bahaitemplatestar.png/20px-Bahaitemplatestar.png" alt="" width="20" height="19" longdesc="../../../b/a/h/Image%7EBahaitemplatestar.png_81d9.html" /></a> - <a href="../../../c/u/n/User_talk%7ECunado19_98ea.html" title="User talk:Cunado19"><font size="-3">Talk</font></a> 06:24, 31 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have removed Subh-i-Azal section again. Subh-i-Azal was never a leader of the Baha'i Faith. This is not a page about the <a href="../../../b/a/b/Babism.html" title="Babism">Babi Faith</a> or <a href="../../../h/e/_/He_whom_God_shall_make_manifest_06ee.html" title="He whom God shall make manifest">He whom God shall make manifest</a> (HWGSMM); but a page about the Baha'i Faith. The Baha'i Faith starts at the claiming of Baha'u'llah to be HWGSMM. The reason why the Bab is in the history section of the page is to give context to the Baha'u'llah section which talks about Babis, imprisonment, and HWGSMM. (There is always a backward trend to include more context, perhaps in this case the Shayki teachings, and there might be an argument to add those, but given that Islam in general is known by the public, I don't think this summary article needs them, but the general public does not know about Babism) Subh-i-Azal claiming to be HWGSMM does not add to context of the Baha'u'llah section where the history of the Baha'i Faith starts. Subh-i-Azal's claim has been expounded greatly in other pages (one whole page is directed to his claim to HWGSMM, <a href="../../../b/a/h/Bah%C3%A1%27%C3%AD_B%C3%A1b%C3%AD_split_18de.html" title="Bahá'í/Bábí split">Bahá'í/Bábí split</a>, and not accepting Baha'u'llah's claim, and that page is linked through the <i>main</i> section). You don't see a mention of <a href="../../../m/a/n/Mandaeism.html" title="Mandaeism">Mandaeism</a> (followers of John the Baptist who did not accept Jesus) in the <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christianity.html" title="Christianity">Christianity</a> and <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus.html" title="Jesus">Jesus</a> articles because they were not Christians who followed Jesus. Now I know that Subh-i-Azal is not exactly the same, as there was no leader after John the Baptist who became the leader before Jesus, but the point stands that Subh-i-Azal was never a leader of the Baha'i Faith, and that the Bab section is there to provide context. The Subh-i-Azal section does not provide any more context, and he is also mentioned in the Baha'u'llah section, where it states "<a href="../../../s/u/b/Subh-i-Azal_e110.html" title="Subh-i-Azal">Subh-i-Azal</a>, the appointed leader of the Bábís." -- <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeff3000_72a5.html" title="User:Jeff3000">Jeff3000</a> 13:51, 31 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This article is about the Baha'i Faith. Not the Babi Faith. Not the Azali creed. Mirza Yahya was never a Baha'i leader. The Browne citation clearly identifies him as a Babi figure. This is so obvious I can't understand why this section was added in good faith. His conflict with Baha'u'llah is duly noted and a link to his biographical article provided. Links to the Bab, Babism, and Babi/Baha'i split are <i>all</i> provided. It's not as if anything's being hidden here. Just proper weight in the proper article.</p>
<p>Wjhonson, you're not reading the article. Nothing in this section says that these figures were "leaders" except referring to Yayha as leader of the Babis. How much more clear can it get? The Bab is not identified as such. Frankly, neither are the others. These are principle historical figures of the Baha'i Faith. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMARussellPESE_d65e.html" title="User:MARussellPESE">MARussellPESE</a> 15:32, 31 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This section is obviously about the HISTORY of the movement. If the Bab was the *leader* before Baha, then Subh was, in exactly the same way, the *leader* between the Bab and Baha. Otherwise you leave a 16 year gap that is not accounted for. That makes no sense. In no other page with a section called "History" would a gap like this be allowed to go unexplained. <a href="../../../w/j/h/User%7EWjhonson_d987.html" title="User:Wjhonson">Wjhonson</a> 17:33, 31 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't know how to make this more clear. The history of the Baha'i Faith is traced to Baha'u'llah's declaration in 1863, not the Bab's in 1844. The Bab is universally viewed as the forerunner who innaugurated his own, distinct, stand-alone, independent, separate, religion. The Bab, Himself, is important. So were the Babi figures who struggled to launch that religion. Many Baha'i trace their roots to those people. But in the end, these are as venerable as the founders and early heroes of every faith. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMARussellPESE_d65e.html" title="User:MARussellPESE">MARussellPESE</a> 18:21, 31 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>And in the same way Subh-i-Azal provides content as well. When someone reads the "History" section they are given the false impression that for 16 years the movement simply vanished. Instead any observant Baha'i should be interested in what happened during that time period. I imagine that none of you three can tell me one single thing that happened to anyone except Baha himself. <a href="../../../w/j/h/User%7EWjhonson_d987.html" title="User:Wjhonson">Wjhonson</a> 21:05, 31 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think the Baha'i editors here, especially MARussellPESE, are pretty well versed in what happened to Mirza Yahya during the time from the Bab's death to Baha'u'llah's declaration and beyond. That's not the point, the Baha'i Faith's history starts from Baha'u'llah claiming he knew he was the HWGSMM prophecized by the Bab. Context needed for this is what/who is HWGSMM; the answer to that is a figure predicted by the Bab. The next question is who is the Bab, since that is not common knowledge, and so that has to be explained. There were many claimants to be HWGSMM, including Mirza Yahya; these people started their own faiths/movements/religions, but they were not Baha'is. These people were either Babis (or previously Babis, depending on what they claimed), and are mentioned appropriately in the Babi related pages. The other thing is that Mirza Yahya is already mentioned in the article as the leader of the Babis, so the content is there. -- <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeff3000_72a5.html" title="User:Jeff3000">Jeff3000</a> 05:04, 1 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
