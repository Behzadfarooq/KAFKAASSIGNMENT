<h2><span class="mw-headline">Baha'u'llah's picture</span></h2>
<p>As mentioned in the article, for Baha'is, Baha'u'llahs picture is not shown for signs of respect. Most Baha'is do know that a photo exists outside the Baha'i archives building, but don't even want to go and search for it. It is not a minor part of their (my) faith.</p>
<p>I think that the message could be changed to something that says that Baha'u'llahs picture exists and can be found on the web, but as a sign of respect for Baha'is that the precise link not exist. If people really do want to see the picture they can go ahead and find it. -- <a href="../../../n/a/v/User%7ENavidazizi_7afd.html" title="User:Navidazizi">NavidAzizi</a> 19:27, Jan 14, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Some more info. The <a href="../../../s/h/o/Shoghi_Effendi_4011.html" title="Shoghi Effendi">Guardian</a> of the Baha'i Faith, who was appointed the successor, to Abdu'l Baha (who was appointed the successor to Baha'u'llah) has written the following. "There is no objection that the believers look at the picture of Bahá'u'lláh, but they should do so with the utmost reverence, and should also not allow that it be exposed openly to the public, even in their private homes." So just for the sake of respect I ask that the precise link not be posted. -- <a href="../../../n/a/v/User%7ENavidazizi_7afd.html" title="User:Navidazizi">NavidAzizi</a> 19:32, Jan 14, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The question is - should Wikipedia articles be restricted out of respect to its subjects, and if so, who should define respect - neutral Wikipedia users or the subject. What if a spokesman for the US Army asks to remove the images of prison torture "out of respect"? Or children of a Nazi war criminal ask to remove his photo "out of respect"? (not equating Bahaullah with any of those, of course). My opinion is that Wikipedia is not a Bahai encyclopedia, so in no way should writing of articles on Bahai faith (including related articles, such as this one) be governed by the principles of Bahai faith. If we can't put a link to the photo, because Bahais do not want so, can we put criticism of the church or would that be disrespectful too?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>So my view is that Wikipedia can make no such concessions to what material is included. This is an article about a person. There is a photo of that person. That photo is in public domain. Ergo, the photo should be included (or the link to it, it doesn't make much difference). <a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParanoid_098f.html" title="User:Paranoid">Paranoid</a> 19:50, 14 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree. Furthermore, this is a biography article, and the only picture of him is integral to writing it.

<dd>I think this photo is the best one, because the ones that the Bahai Center in Israel shows the pilgrims are retouched photos (in fact one of them is a bogus one based on this photo) and they are worked out to make Bahaullah look "more presentable", which, if you think about it, is actually an insult to Bahaullah. If you believe in this guy, then just accept him the way he really looked. If he is not "good looking enough" for your taste, then shop around for a better looking prophet or "manifestation of God". The authenticity of this passport photo has been officially acknowledged by the Bahai authorities. --<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmir1_4d3d.html" title="User:Amir1">Amir</a> 15:57, 23 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Should definitely be a link - and it makes a HELL of a lot of difference. The Baha'i attitude to Baha'u'llah's photo basically derives from the Islamic prohibition on representative art (certainly, if there were photos of Muhammad around, you'd get vociferous complaints from Muslims if you had it there on the Muhammad article). Imagine if you'd illustrated the article on Jesus with a photo of one of the more controversial artworks depciting him (say, "Piss Jesus", or something like that). This picture was taken from a passport photo of Baha'u'llah, as Amir says, but it is only public domain because it appeared in a book full of knocking copy by a Christian missionary out to discredit the Baha'is. People who don't like Baha'is publicise this picture because they know that to do so is offensive to Baha'is. That is the only context I have ever seen this picture appear on the web. <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaulHammond_ae3e.html" title="User:PaulHammond">PaulHammond</a> 20:55, Jan 30, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Paranoid is right. In fact, Edward Brownse, in another book talks about some gory details of how the Bahais and Azalis brutalized one another, in particular, how the Bahais were intolerant of the Azalis. The Bahais today know these facts very well, but do their best to keep such mess under the carpet. As for "extremely offenisve to the Bahais", well, tough. First of all, let's be honest, the reason you don't want this photo publicized is because he looks like Rasputin, or he looks like the crook that he was who hijacked the Babi movement. If "out of respect" you don't want his photo displayed, then how come the photos of his son Abdulbaha is all over the palce? Because he was more photogenic and his appearance is more "marketable". If you think about it deeper, it is you who is being offensive to him by saying that his appearance is not good enough! But as it was pointed out to you, Wikipedia is not a Bahai encyclopedia. It is stupid to put a photo of some house in this article, when a photo of Bahaullah is available. And this photo is authentic and is his passport photo. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartin2000_67b8.html" title="User:Martin2000">Martin2000</a> 22:57, 14 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Baha'is see Baha'u'llah as a messenger of God, and as so displaying his image is unrespecful. It has nothing with anything with the way he looks. I'm going to go back to Paranoid's suggestion of jsut linking to it. -- <a href="../../../n/a/v/User%7ENavidazizi_7afd.html" title="User:Navidazizi">NavidAzizi</a> 04:52, Jan 15, 2005.</dd>

<dd>On another note, I have no problem with a link to his photo, but honestly, for the life of me I can't understand why it is "offensive" to have his photo in the article. In all honesty, to me it seems that the Bahais are actually insulting the guy by indirectly rejecting his appearance. Wouldn't every Christian or Muslim have loved to know exactly what Jesus or Muhammed looked like?!! The claim that "out of respect we don't want his photo here" is indeed strange and even lame -- but I will not insist, because in my heart I feel that the real reason for this objection is because the Bahais consider his photo to be ... hmmm ... "unmarketable". That is like saying "we love the guy, we just wish he looked a little better so we could comfortably include his photo in the article"!! <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartin2000_67b8.html" title="User:Martin2000">Martin2000</a> 07:11, 15 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>For the picture, a couple reasons. One is so that the picture does not become an icon, where people idolize the icon and not the teachings. Secondly like I wrote about, Shoghi Effendi wrote not to view the image. There is a strong link of authority in the Baha'i Faith, and when Shoghi Effendi has written not to place the image in public places, most Baha'is do listen. You might call this listening to authority a restriction of freedom, but Baha'is see it as a way of conserving unity and protecting it (not eliminating it) from divisions. The point about people seeing this authority as a restriction to personal freedom is in the main Wikipedia article on the Baha'i Faith.</dd>

<dd>As for the escape/exile to Baghdad, you are partly right, he wasn't exiled to Baghdad, but was told he had to leave the country (and thus an exile). He was given the choice to choose the destination of the exile, he chose Baghdad. I don't know why Baha'u'llah chose Baghdad. And I don't know if he chose it because Babais were already there or if the other Babis followed Baha'u'llah to Baghdad. Actually the persian authorities wanted to execute Baha'u'llah just like they did to the Bab, that would have been the easiest thing to do. But since people in shah's court knew Baha'u'llah and his father they asked for proof that he was part of the failed assassination. So the next best thing was to get him out of the country. <a href="../../../n/a/v/User%7ENavidazizi_7afd.html" title="User:Navidazizi">NavidAzizi</a> 15:10, Jan 15, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hello Navid. I have to disagree with your assertion here. A copy of Bahaullah's Iranian passport page(s) is on the official Bahai web site (as well as on other web sites). According to his passport, he had requested to visit the Shiite holy sites in then Ottoman Empire (modern day Iraq). So it seems that he had told the authorities that he is going for shiite holy site pilgrimage, and he was taking his wives with him. According to his passport, he took 4 women with him, and 2 sons. Any reasonable person will think that he escaped out of Persia in this way, and he was not asked to leave. His passport clearly indicates that the passport will expire in one year, which was the standard expiration date for passports issues at that time. At this time his half-brother Sobh-i Azal was already the leader of the Babi community in Baghdad, and when Bahaullah joined him, Sobh-i Azal put him in charge of much of the affairs of the movement. From that point on, Bahaullah went on to accept Subh-i Azal's leadership of the Babis for almost 10 years without any incidents until he came up with some ideas of his own. It certainly seems that Bahaullah planned to leave Persia and join the Babi community in Baghdad; and all the melodramatic stuff such as "he was forced to leave Persia with very little food and supplies etc...." is bogus and should be taken out of the article. --<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmir1_4d3d.html" title="User:Amir1">Amir</a> 16:23, 23 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Amir, your comment certainly suggested to me that you thought Baha'u'llah's photo appeared on the official Baha'i web site. If you didn't mean to say or suggest that, then you have certainly been unusually careful in choosing your words here. I doubt it appears on Jonah Winter's site - presumably the reference to his <i>passport</i> there is one of the pages that does <b>not</b> contain his photo. The Baha'i taboo against casually displaying Baha'u'llah's image is very strong, so loyal Baha'is like Jonah are not going to put his picture up. Baha'u'llah's picture in all cases only appears on the sites of people who wish to criticise and offend Baha'is. <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaulHammond_ae3e.html" title="User:PaulHammond">PaulHammond</a> 03:26, Jan 31, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, I meant there is a picture of the main page of his Iranian passport, dated 1853, which does not contain his photograph. Also, it seems that one Bahai is blaming me for having used that site and another Bahai is calling it the site of a "loyal Bahai" -- can you please make up your minds? My reference to his "passport photo" which may have been the cause of this confusion for you and Navid is probably form another section of this page, when I mentioned something regarding his photo, I think, to Cyprus2k1. --<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmir1_4d3d.html" title="User:Amir1">Amir</a> 10:06, 31 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It sounded to me like you were saying "This official Baha'i site contains Baha'u'llah's picture, so it must be okay for me to use it here". This is not the case, and Baha'is really do have a strong taboo against the casual use of their Manifestation's picture. Amir, people are not "blaming you", they are trying to explain the situation. Jonah Winters explains on his site that his work has no official status - Navid has reproduced that site's disclaimer above. But that Jonah Winters is a loyal Baha'i (and therefore <i>would not</i> reproduce Baha'u'llah's image anywhere on his site) is also the case. The official Baha'i site is at <a href="http://www.bahai.org" class="external free" title="http://www.bahai.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.bahai.org</a> Incidentally, you have also made an incorrect assumption about me. I am a non-Baha'i.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">photo or link</span></h2>
<p>From teh Orthodox Baha'i Perspective, the picutre also should be removed, not because it is a Baha'i site, but for the same reason on the section of Islam no one puts up the print of Muhammad that might be available (there is a sketch) but no one would think of putting it up sicne this would be offinsive to those of that Faith, unless we want to say Wikipedia will allow offending peopel of various religions by putting in thinks that are deliberately offensive, Like how about putting a picture of the swastika on the Jewish page, or maybe soem other such I am sure we can all come up with reason to justify why we do what we do.f Also the reason for no picture goes back to Islam. Both Bha'is and Islamic followers bvelieve a picture representation of any Prophet is not a thing to be done, but specidifcally of their own prophet they definately should not do or have done to them. It is not just a Baha'i thing. I will not remove what has been placed up there but strongly object to it being put there without a disclaimer under it that Baha'is like their Muslim brethern do not believe picturers representing the prophets should be allowed, and that this picture therefore is offensive to them. If you were to put that under the picture I would still object to it, but would have to recourse but to accept it.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Actually, Orthodox Muslims believe that having pictures of *anything* that exists in reality is blasphemy because only God is allowed allowed to create - this does not stop us from posting pictures of things that exist.

<dd>Welcome to the age of the Internet. So what are you Bahais going to do? Stop every single web site in the world from putting up the photo of Bahaullah?

Wikipedia policy on offensive imagery: "11. Think carefully if offensive pictures are really necessary. Consider providing a link to the picture, and a warning of the picture's contents, rather than place it directly in the article. If you have concerns regarding the appropriateness of an image, discuss it on the relevant article talk page."</p>
<p>People have quoted this policy here, so you must be aware of it. If you were not aware of the offence that you cause to Baha'is by insisting on publishing his picture on this article, enough Baha'is have explained that to you now that ignorance can no longer be a defence. Personally, if you are so wedded to the idea that people *have* to be able to access this image of Baha'u'llah that you have uploaded here, I'd prefer you to do it in an external link to your own website, where you will also be able to bad-mouth Baha'u'llah to your heart's content. Of course, I've outlined my strong suspicions about your bona fides as a wikipedia contributor below, already. --<a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaulHammond_ae3e.html" title="User:PaulHammond">PaulHammond</a> 03:17, Jan 31, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I am interested in contributing to a subject in which I have accurate, detailed, and correct information. If you like to paint a rosy and romantic picutre of Bahaism, and certain facts ruin this picture for you, don't blame those who state those facts. In other words, don't shoot the messenger. I am simply stating some facts. Going to multiple people's personal pages and knocking on every door trying to portray me as some sort of evil character just because I have contributed FACTS AND CORRECT INFORMATION to Bahai-related articles, is not a good idea, there are good chances that it will backfire on you. Is there any misinformation that I included in any of the articles? Is the picture that I uploaded not authentic?

<p>I agree with Martin2000. The picture is a piece of factual information, its authenticity is not under dispute and it is not a copyright violation. So in summary: It is factual information, abeit with a twist - it upsets some people. AFAIK we have no policy in wikipedia to remove factual, undisputed, unencumbered information. If there is upset about the "prettiness"of the picture - I would not disagree to exchange the picture with one less "Rasputinesque", as long as it is equally authentic, simply to keep the peace, but removal would be very wrong. And whether or not Martin2000 has created his identity to upload something which s/he anticipated to be controversial is not really the point under discussion. <a href="../../../r/e/f/User%7ERefdoc_5ef2.html" title="User:Refdoc">Refdoc</a> 17:53, 31 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Rick, as you know photography was not invented at the time Muhammad, so there is no authentic picture of him around. If there was one around, it most certainly belonged to an article about Muhammad and also to an article about Islam. The same is true about Jesus. The main reason the bahai authorities are so concerned about this photo is because bahaullah does not look ... hmm ... very "marketable" and frankly, he looks bad. You might notice that they plaster the pictures of Abdul-Baha, his son, all over the place. They are simply not honest enough to admit the real reason behind this stupid demand. At any rate, it is too late for them now, as we are already well into the information age and the era of the Internet. --<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmir1_4d3d.html" title="User:Amir1">Amir</a> 00:12, 4 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h4><span class="mw-headline">Reasons for it being included</span></h4>
<p>Generally seems to be done by just about everyone else. Their reasons seem to be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wikipedia policy (link?) is that factual information should <i>not</i> be removed from articles.</li>
<li>Wikipedia is not a Baha'i project. Many of the Baha'i articles are copied straight from leaflets and not written in the NPOV spirit of wikipedia that should include accurate details and facts.</li>
<li>The image does seem to be under the correct and legal copyright.</li>
<li>Other biographical articles have images of the person and it does contribute to the article.</li>
<li>Quite a few biographical articles don't include images (even though they could), but that doesn't mean we have to hold this particular one back from being better.</li>
</ul>
<p><a name="Reasons_for_converting_to_a_link" id="Reasons_for_converting_to_a_link"></a></p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline">Reasons for converting to a link</span></h4>
<p>Offered as a compromise approach after edit wars. Reasons for it:</p>
<ul>
<li>When an image might be offensive <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Image_use_policy#Rules_of_thumb" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Image_use_policy#Rules_of_thumb" rel="nofollow">Wikipedia Image use policy</a> rule of thumb point 11 states:</li>
</ul>

<dd><i>Think carefully if offensive pictures are really necessary. Consider providing a link to the picture, and a warning of the picture's contents, rather than place it directly in the article. If you have concerns regarding the appropriateness of an image, discuss it on the relevant article talk page.</i></dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>It is a compromise. Baha'is who don't want to see it don't have to. People who are interested can see the image freely.</li>
<li>Although Baha'is wouldn't like the image of Baha'u'llah on the internet at all, <b>it is already there</b> so asking it to be removed from wikipedia doesn't solve their problems.</li>
</ul>
<p>Just to state my biases in writing this summary. I'm a Baha'i but I'm endorsing the third option. I have tried to keep this neutral, but if you feel I've failed there please write it below.</p>

<dd>I agree with Tomhab's third option: inserting a link to the photograph is a reasonable compromise. I am a Baha'i and was shocked by seeing the photo...not by the image, but by the fact that it was there. Anyone--including Baha'is--who wants to follow the link to the image would be free to do so without giving offence to many people visiting the article.

<li>It seems to me that it isn't the photograph that Baha'is object to, but specifically the act of looking at it irreverently, and in general the display of the picture in a location or context where people will look at it irreverently. There is nothing Wikipedia can or should do about the state of mind in which people look at Wikipedia. Baha'is wishing to avoid engaging in irreverent behavior towards their prophet can easily make their own personal arrangements. The compromise will not help because the vast majority of people who look at it will not be Bahai's and will still not look at it reverently even if they do have to click on a link. Those who are Baha'is will gain spiritually by learning to be constantly vigilant, for an encounter with the sacred can be found around every corner. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 19:16, 3 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Yeah I think you're right. The image won't ever get removed from the net and thats why I'm not endorsing the idea of removing it here (because what difference does it make?). People will happily enough look at the image everyday and I don't think it really makes much difference. As a personal preference though, I really don't want to look at the image of him without really being in the right mood and state of reverence. Think of it as a personal choice. I don't drink but am well aware that a great many people do, but it doesn't impose on me so fine. At the moment you cannot view this page without seeing the picture so it is imposed on me. I can see your point that you can't accomodate everybody's concern which is why we're having a debate now. -- <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomhab_fa0f.html" title="User:Tomhab">Tomhab</a> 21:22, 3 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I understand that aspect of it. There is a page on Wikipedia with pictures that I really don't like to look at because the pictures are very upsetting to me. I have a phobia of caterpillars which is triggered by photographs of them. But this doesn't stop me reading about them on Wikipedia. My web browser (and all web browsers I've ever encountered) has controls that permit me to stop it downloading and displaying pictures. So if I wanted to edit <a href="../../../c/a/t/Caterpillar.html" title="Caterpillar">caterpillar</a> (and because my phobia doesn't overcome my scientific curiosity, I may want to) I would be able to turn off image downloads on my browser, visit the page without having to see caterpillar pictures, and then edit it. Afterwards I could turn on image downloads on my browser. It's only a couple of mouseclicks to do this. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 23:53, 3 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Tony, the point is obviously increasingly less a matter of concern for guys like Tomhab, Cyprus or the other Bahais actively contributing here because they <i>know</i> that the picture is here, and they can either <i>prepare</i> themselves or simply <i>press the buttons</i>, just as you suggested. Fine. But this is a growing project and it is used by many more people than just those who debate on this page - or are even aware of an ongoing debate. So I do continue to support to linkify the picture - simply out of respect - not for Bahaullah, for whom I feel little, but for the readers and the not-yet-editors. And with regard to the spiritual benefit for Baha'is by being constantly vigilant, I really was not aware that Wikipedia had such high aims....I do think we should probably settle on the rather lower ground to allow everyone in whatever spiritual state to contribute and enjoy this encycplopedia <a href="../../../r/e/f/User%7ERefdoc_5ef2.html" title="User:Refdoc">Refdoc</a> 00:44, 4 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I couldn't agree more. For some reason it seems bahai mentality and culture is that the rest of the world should conform to what their authorities say (and this is when they are nearly a non-entity in terms of quantity, can you imagine what they would be like if they ruled the world?! -- they actually do dream of such day and they call it "the golden age" of their movement). Folks, wake up and smell the fresh coffee, this is year 2005 and we are well into the iformation age. The Internet was not invented by the Bahais, nor is it being sponsored by your Universal House of Justice (or lack thereof). Please do not abuse the open nature of the Internet, and in this particular case, the Wikipedia project. If a place like Wikipedia can be so "offensive" to you then simply limit yourselves to bahai sites. Using a metaphor, if a part of town is "bad" and "rough", and you are such a goody-goody, simply stay away from that neighbourhood.

<dd>I am new to Wikipedia, but I understand its purpose is to make NPOV information easily accessible to users. Editors of this article on Baha'u'llah should therefore not hide important information about him, but neither should they use it to introduce or support their own POV. SGBaily is strongly against linked images: "either they are appropriate or they aren't". But the situation here is somewhat unique, involving Baha'is' reverence of Baha'u'llah while the image is not otherwise offensive to non-Baha'i users. Use of a link for the image is therefore the best compromise.

<p>Similarly to Raul above I did not consider myself exactly party to the conflict(though it seems I have become one), as I am not Bahai, am not offended by the picture, and would personally prefer it to be at the top. But I <i>do</i> think the objections made in the above comments by contributing Bahais are perfectly understandable and should be respected. The aesthetic loss by using a link or an unusual design of the page would be minimal. The benefit though would be clear and has been discussed ad extenso. So I remain of the opinion the picture should be moved in one way or another.

<p>Because we are not required to follow the editing rules (which don't state that a picture is required anyway), if the presence of this picture offends those of the Baha'i Faith, what possible reason is there not to just put it at the bottom of the article, where those who wish to view it may, and those who don't do not need to.

<dd>MPerel, that is a picture of Abdu'l Baha. There is no Baha'i taboo against displaying his picture, because he isn't thought of as the equivalent of Jesus. Indeed, Baha'is commonly display a prominent photo of Abdu'l Baha in their homes. - <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaulHammond_ae3e.html" title="User:PaulHammond">PaulHammond</a> 16:26, Feb 6, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ah...is the offense to Bahai with photographs in general, or just with photographs of the Bahaullah? If the latter is the case, then I do see merit in making accomodation to not offend. Perhaps I misunderstood thinking Bahai were prohibited from seeing any photographs. --<a href="../../../m/p/e/User%7EMPerel_ce51.html" title="User:MPerel">MPerel</a><sup><small>( <a href="../../../m/p/e/User_talk%7EMPerel_2b5d.html" title="User talk:MPerel">talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_MPerel_0ace.html" title="Special:Contributions/MPerel">contrib</a>)</small></sup> 08:45, Feb 6, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

It does seem an easy accommodation then to do as you suggest and put the picture at the bottom. Another option I've seen done on Wikipedia regarding potentially offensive pictures is a special template that filters the picture from displaying unless the reader clicks a link to see the picture. I don't recall the name of the special template, though, I'd have to investigate. --<a href="../../../m/p/e/User%7EMPerel_ce51.html" title="User:MPerel">MPerel</a><sup><small>( <a href="../../../m/p/e/User_talk%7EMPerel_2b5d.html" title="User talk:MPerel">talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_MPerel_0ace.html" title="Special:Contributions/MPerel">contrib</a>)</small></sup> 09:11, Feb 6, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Anyway, if the picture is going to move to the bottom, I will also request that all unveiled female pictures of various articles also be moved to the bottoms of those articles.

As mentioned in the comments by someone else, many people, including a number of admins have already expressed their opinion that this article is not going to be an exception in the whole of wikipedia. The picture is going to stay where it belongs, and your behaviour will only motivate people to take their sweet time to go around the Internet and plaster this picture in as many sites (in multple languages) as they can. Just accept the fact, as the bahai Universal House of Justice has realized per their official communique, that there isn't anything the Bahais can do to stop the natural, open and uncensored expansion of the Internet. --<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmir1_4d3d.html" title="User:Amir1">Amir</a> 09:47, 6 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Wikipedia should not have to conform to the demands and requirements of any religious or ideological organizations. You are clearly trying to "help" this article conform to bahai demands.

<dd>Hello MPerel. What you seem to be unaware of, is that this issue has already been discussed a nubmer of times, but the bahais keep trying and trying and they basically want to force their preferred "version" of bahai articles here. The issue is actually quite simple: this is an article about a man, there is a public domain photo of this man, and there is nothing wrong with that photo (other than the fact that the owner of the photo looks like Rasputin) and it is an authentic photo from the man's own passport. The bahais around here are saying that we don't want this photo in this article because our religious organization has told us that we must only view it with "reverence"&#160;!!! this is such a stupid argument it is actually entertaining. What if next, some religious muslim says my religion tells me unveiled female picutures are illicit and should be removed or at lease, for our sake, moved to the bottom of their respective articles? --<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmir1_4d3d.html" title="User:Amir1">Amir</a> 10:21, 6 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I understand your perspective, and as you see I too initially protested what I thought was censorship and imposing religion on Wikipedia. However, putting the picture at the bottom seems an easy and reasonable accommodation. And in the case of unveiled female pictures, it would also be reasonable to not post them in articles on Islam, out of respect for Muslim readers, do you agree? --<a href="../../../m/p/e/User%7EMPerel_ce51.html" title="User:MPerel">MPerel</a><sup><small>( <a href="../../../m/p/e/User_talk%7EMPerel_2b5d.html" title="User talk:MPerel">talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_MPerel_0ace.html" title="Special:Contributions/MPerel">contrib</a>)</small></sup> 10:36, Feb 6, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Voting doesn't work in this case. First of all, as we all know there are a number of bahai sockpuppets here. Secondly, wikipedia articles must follow a set of standards and they should be in conformity and consistency. Besides, taking votes in a religious article where naturally the majority of the "regulars" are the follower of that religion and they all have this page and its related pages in their watchlist, is anything but democratic. --<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmir1_4d3d.html" title="User:Amir1">Amir</a> 10:28, 6 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Okay, Amir. If you are going to use this kind of language to support your campaign, then I strongly suspect that Martin2000 is your sock puppet. Some of the higher-level admins can find out for sure, so if you're going to open this as a topic for debate here, you'd better be damn sure you won't end up with egg on your face for making such accusations. btw, I presume we can count your comment here as two votes for "leave it at the top where it causes maximum offence to my enemies"? - <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaulHammond_ae3e.html" title="User:PaulHammond">PaulHammond</a> 16:20, Feb 6, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

I insist that you to go to your high-level admin friends and ask them to determine if I have any fake ID's ... I DO NOT. But it is obvious that you guys (the few weaky sneaky cheaty bahais here) have sockpuppets. Every time I have introduced a fact in these articles, a new Bahai ID was created (the last one was <a href="../../../o/c/c/User%7EOccamy_964a.html" title="User:Occamy">User:Occamy</a> which was created almost immediately after I introduced some new facts in the articles) to "refute" it or to fight me out. Ask your high level admins if I have a fake ID or if <a href="../../../o/c/c/User%7EOccamy_964a.html" title="User:Occamy">Occamy</a> is a fake ID of someone who is a regular here -- and there is more than just one bahai sockpuppet here.

<p>'straw poll' - this is exactly what I was looking for. A number of people came onto the page and changed their opinion half way through (myself included) on the matter of the picture. So this is what I want to clarify. <a href="../../../r/e/f/User%7ERefdoc_5ef2.html" title="User:Refdoc">Refdoc</a> 10:54, 6 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>This was not a binding vote, neither publically announced, nor running for any major lengthg of time. but it seemed to encompass everyone who was active on this page over the last few days and a few beyond. As major changes really need consensus particularly if they need to be enforced against the odd troll, my suggestion would be for those who want the picture off the upper corner of page to accept that such consensus is - at the moment - impossible to achieve - even when one discounts the trolling of one particular contributor, who might well end up being banned for good if his career continues in his usual disruptive ways. So my suggestion to those offended by the picture is to leave the picture where it is, in the upper corner, continue to build the article itself and not to sink into the abysses of a real edit war. The alternative is to call for comments via the RfC page and possibly even ask for an arbitration i.e. go down a more formal route - but be aware that such a route can usually be gone only once and a result would be binding - with little hope to convince people gradually and achieving a better result slowly and with time. This is easy for me to aks from you as I obviously am not offended by teh presence of the picture, but I still think it is sound advice <a href="../../../r/e/f/User%7ERefdoc_5ef2.html" title="User:Refdoc">Refdoc</a> 22:41, 6 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I agree with your suggestion about avoiding edit wars and taking more time to achieve consensus. However, I think it unfair of you to characterize an editor with a dissenting opinion as being a troll. I certainly don't view the dissenter as a troll. I see valid argument for perspectives on either side, both representing Wikipedia ideals. Religious accommodation is not a Wikipedia obligation, but then there is also no absolute standard about where and how pictures are placed in articles, and so there seems reasonable flexibility to attempt to format the article in a way that would satisfy readers from various perspectives. Negative labeling of or veiled threats to editors won't help build consensus, however, and I've seen it coming from both sides on this article. --<a href="../../../m/p/e/User%7EMPerel_ce51.html" title="User:MPerel">MPerel</a><sup><small>( <a href="../../../m/p/e/User_talk%7EMPerel_2b5d.html" title="User talk:MPerel">talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_MPerel_0ace.html" title="Special:Contributions/MPerel">contrib</a>)</small></sup> 23:36, Feb 6, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As it is I have no problems labelling <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmir1_4d3d.html" title="User:Amir1">user:Amir1</a> a troll - not for his opposition in this particular matter, which is fine by all standards and defended with using a miture of valid argument and other not so valid ones, but for his behaviour across a whole section of the site. Indeed I have so far not seen much constructive at all coming from him. And I did not make any veiled threats but simply made a prediction. Prophetic speech, so to say... He got himself banned yesterday due to his abusive behaviour, but appeared to continue to edit via open proxies - so I assume he has little or no respect for the commuunity and will continue to walk on a path which leads into wilderness. Unelss of course he changes tack dramatically. Unfortuantely he will see this particular episode as a victory for him and not as a normal and common process on Wikipedia, hence my pessimism wrt him. The proof really from my point of view is the edit summaries <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bah%E1%27%ED_Faith&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bah%E1%27%ED_Faith&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[8]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bah%E1%27u%27ll%E1h&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bah%E1%27u%27ll%E1h&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[9]</a> he left on several recent page changes and the small caption<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bah%E1%27%ED_Faith&amp;oldid=9962125" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bah%E1%27%ED_Faith&amp;oldid=9962125" rel="nofollow">[10]</a> he had tried to put into the top of the Bahai article about the pictures used.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">To Understand One Another</span></h2>
<p>Dear readers,</p>
<p>In the Baha'i faith, it mentions that the picture must not be portrayed in an environment that does not respect the portrait of Baha'u'llah. In other words, this is a belief that all Baha'is agree upon.</p>
<p>To friends,</p>
<p>I understand your need of "Freedom of Expression", for the progress of the world "depends" on such value. However, if we do not respect each other and freely express our views among one another, nothing can be solved. We have to learn to respect each others views, and not to impose our views among others because we are either oppressed by our Government that censors everything, or forcing the view that I need that information because it is vital to knowledge. I agree with the second thought, it is important for our knowledge, but must everything be available for the sake of Human Knowledge? Should we post the guidelines in Making Bombs and Dynamites "for the sake of improving the world" by giving in Information? Let us forget about bombs now. How would you like if the portrait of your dear one be portrayed badly? Although it is hard to understand why Baha'is really do not accept the portait to be posted within Wikipedia, but the sensation of how Baha'is feel is similar to the feeling of having a portrait of your loved one be portrayed in a very poor manner. The only way we can solve this is to understand one another.</p>
<p><i>"Blessed is he who preferreth his brother before himself."</i> <b>Baha'u'llah</b></p>
<p><i>"...a state that is not pleasing or delightful to me, how could I inflict that upon another?"</i> <b>Samyutta NIkaya v. 353</b></p>
<p><i>"None of you [truly] believes until he wishes for his brother what he wishes for himself."</i> <b>Number 13 of Imam "Al-Nawawi's Forty Hadiths."</b></p>
<p><i>"That nature alone is good which refrains from doing unto another whatsoever is not good for itself".</i> <b>Dadistan-i-dinik 94:5</b></p>
<p><b>Socrates:</b> "Do not do to others that which would anger you if others did it to you." (Greece; 5th century BCE)</p>
