<p>How the Truth behind the Baha'i Faith influences the various human disciplines will be played out over time. There are several issues that I have not seen addressed. I’m posting a comment here first while I figure out how to start the necessary discussion.</p>
<p>Here is a brief list (throughout, related quotes from the Writings are paraphrased, for now):</p>
<dl>
<dd>Humans have hierarchies expressed in all sorts of ways that need to be understood better (cups to pints to gallons in capability, issues of true independence, …). One way these hierarchies show themselves is in us-them dynamics. But, no matter the case, everyone is independent (not in need of fellows, …) and faces the music of one’s life individually (goes before the Creator, …). So, one thing that Baha’i will bring – IMHO – is a better way to know (see with one’s own eyes, with one’s own mind, …). I really believe that arguments pertaining to the <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quasi-empirical.html" title="Quasi-empirical">Quasi-empirical</a> (blackest night, deepest pit – 4th Valley) are apropos and need to be addressed in a way to where we can better balance objectivity – and its failings – and the necessary head/heart basis for knowledge.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>With our hierarchies, we have partitionings. Among these are current modes, such as the University – academic – realm owning science. I would argue that this is only a temporary blimp. I think that we can use the ‘wiki’ (some quote from the Guardian here about a pervasive communication means) as the glimmer of a non-elite framework for a scientific paradigm that will truly turn things on their heads. I’m going to use metaphors from differential topology (and other maths) as I help expand what’s needed in the discussion. But, we could use things like – the earth is round, but the world is flat. Every viewpoint has associated with it a myriad of extensions which are usually linear. Compounding these do not make for non-linearity, but they can cause complications.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>What we have really in the realm of our collective knowledges is a highly divisive reality (knowledge is a point that has been multiplied by the non-believers) view that cannot be integrated without some fundamental change. One aspect of the current situation is that everyone throws over the wall to an expert any query that they don’t know. Naturally, humankind will have to build a way that we can ‘axiomatically’ – quoted as it’s being used in a large than normal sense – use collective knowledge (trust, truth, …) and depend upon not having to be omniscient – except for the few events that are known to be ‘infallible’ if done right – leading to a notion that in the hierarchy of truth, the UHJ may have to provide the provisional basis – types of axioms or interpretations taken as true -- for a world of knowledge built upon proven tidbits collected via computational events, by humans, or by a wedding – borgs, essentially.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>This is not a closure, but I think that the 7 and 4 Valleys are together a wonderful starting point for a productive worldview in the sense of demonstrating the Harmony of Science and Religion. <a href="../../../j/m/s/User%7EJMSwtlk_8dfb.html" title="User:JMSwtlk">jmswtlk</a> 14:41, 30 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi JMS,</p>
<p>I must confess that I read through this a couple of times and I'm not completely following what you're getting at.</p>
<p>My understanding is that you are interesting in writing a couple paragraphs about rethinking some fundamental concepts of scientific thought using the Writings as a guide.</p>
<p>Is this right? because if it is I think that it's a great idea that hopefully many great minds will work on, but I have to ask if this is the correct place for it.</p>
<p>As an encyclopedia the most that can be done here is to state that this person or these people have done research about this and this is their research and this is how it was recieved.</p>
<p>What you're talking about seems utterly fascinating and I would like to hear more. Have you or anyone published anything about this that you can direct me to? <a href="../../../l/a/m/User%7ELambaJan_e449.html" title="User:LambaJan">LambaJan</a> 01:49, 1 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Hi LambaJan, I’m new to ‘wiki’ editing and am actively working on learning the protocol (especially, the appropriate restraint of original thought&#160;: - ). Thanks for the comment as it was rightly timed and phrased. Before I go further, let me say that I’ve really enjoyed the Baha’i pages on ‘wiki’ and have made great use of them for reference. Even in the more troublesome areas (in several senses), I think that these pages provide a good view to the subject.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Now, I can do some clarification of my original statement. Let me propose some changes and see what ensues from that. In brief, I think that the page has to many words on 3 areas of controversy (Ether, Life on other planets, and Evolution) related to Statements in the Writings of a cosmological nature. Some of this detail ought to go to a page on differences of opinion.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The main ‘science’ page ought to lay out the notions in a more positive sense. Too, it ought to bring out the fact that the term ‘science’ has more applicability than just those so-called ‘hard’ disciplines dealing with matter. See the page on the <a href="http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/c/SCH/sch-47.html" class="external text" title="http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/c/SCH/sch-47.html" rel="nofollow">2 types</a> (material and spiritual). In regard to the former, there would be even social sciences on the list. Now, the latter (spiritual) is really heavily alluded to in my diatribe above. There are other examples like this.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>So, the main page could have a list from several sources, some of which are now linked to (A Compilation on Scholarship, the Warwick Leaflet, …). Of course, each item on the list would require some text plus a link to the source. Whether the text would do justice to the original is one of the challenges.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Now, that man is ‘spiritual’ and may use this attribute to be a better scientist (scholar, …) is probably the way most think about how Faith works with science. Or, one might say that spiritually motivated activities might help improve the mind or cause insight. Actually, the common view now is that Faith can interfere with the scientific mindset; has anyone shown the positive side on secular (forgive the use, but it comes to mind) pursuits of knowing the Writings?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>My comment suggests another view which is that an ‘axiomatic’ framework could very well be founded on the Writings (I’m not sure that this is something original to me – as I can find plenty of quotes (actually had them organized at one point) that indicate that something like this can work). Now, would such a thing possibly work in the ‘hard’ sense? It’s one of those ‘quasi empirical’ questions.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>My pointer to the ‘quasi empirical’ discussions in mathematics is because the joke is the following: the biologist talks to the chemist, the chemist talks to the physicist, the physicist talks to the mathematician, … This is the throwing-over-the-wall syndrome. Now, to who do those upon whose shoulders have been placed the mathematical cape talk? You see, none of the Writings are mathematical in this sense. But, there are concepts one sees that are very much like the underlying motivations, in many cases.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>As an aside, if there were some ‘truth’ calculating entity (and, we’re going to be building such a beast through time, I think), at some point the absence of hard fact will cause the referencing mechanism to need shoring by some means. I’m talking about a type of situation where even fuzzy and Bayesian and other loose methods would not be appropriate. In a sense, some of the seemingly ‘circular reasoning’ that is latent in certain efforts causes a ‘house of cards’ that can have serious consequences of failure. It’s at some of those foundational points that an ‘infallible’ view could be activated (various methods, but essentially via the UHJ).</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>So, this isn’t a small task here. Do I try my hand at a restructure? I know that there are sandboxes. I don’t know if they can be shared. However, a temporary page that is eventually deleted would work. If we started such a thread, the 'wiki' phenomenon would cause the necessary convergence (or the wiki consensus), IMHO. <a href="../../../j/m/s/User%7EJMSwtlk_8dfb.html" title="User:JMSwtlk">jmswtlk</a> 03:36, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello JMSwtlk,</p>
<p>I'm still a little confused, but I think I get to where you're going, and I think it's a good idea. The best is probably to start a sub-user page, that is underneath your user page with an outline, and we can work on it there, until it is in good enough shape, that we can move it here. To make a sub-suer page, just go to your own user page, and then in the location bar add a "/Science" It will then ask you if you start a new page, and of course that what you want to do. Thanks again, for contributing on these pages. -- <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeff3000_72a5.html" title="User:Jeff3000">Jeff3000</a> 04:02, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Bonjour Jeff3000, I appreciate the opportunity to participate in the pulling together of the 'encyclopedic' view of Faith and Science. See the related <a href="../../../j/m/s/User%7EJMSwtlk_FaithAndScience_3c13.html" title="User:JMSwtlk/FaithAndScience">Faith and Science</a> sandbox.
<dl>
<dd>Thanks for setting this up, JMSwtlk. I've put the page on my watchlist, and will comment whenever you add some stuff to it. -- <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeff3000_72a5.html" title="User:Jeff3000">Jeff3000</a> 16:54, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>After some work, it becomes clear that what I'm talking about is <b>Independent Investigation of the Truth</b> (let's call it IIOT) which might have influence on science (Foundations of Science, perhaps) but has a much broader scope (nature of truth, etc.). Once the IIOT page is developed, then how it will impact the Baha'i Faith and Science page or other pages can be determined. There might be interesting twists come about from this work.

<dd>Given new verifiable information, as it seems above, then the statement should be fixed. Also the section on Life on other planets seems like a lot of original work. For example the statement "Taken on its face — reading creatures as living things and planets as terrestrial and/or jovian planets — this statement is contradicted by current understanding of astrobiology and planetary science." While no doubt, some or maybe most people would agree with that statement, we have to find a verifiable and reliable source for that statement. -- <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeff3000_72a5.html" title="User:Jeff3000">Jeff3000</a> 18:01, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Unfortunately, the Ice Worm articles don't undercut the other verifiable sources on the impossibility of life on liquid-waterless worlds: either rock-balls or ice-balls. Earth has these creatures, but they evolved on a world <i>with</i> liquid water, acclimatized to ice-bound conditions, and as the Nichols.edu article says, "Ice worms feed in pools and streams", these specimens do, in fact, require liquid water to live.</p>
<p>The notation that a strictly literal reading, using narrow definitions of creature and planet, conflicts with science isn't original work. Both Baha'u'llah and `Abdul-Baha use the term sometimes very loosely (TB, pp. 187-188; FWU, p. 102; KA, p. 40-42), even interchangably when talking about people, animals, or the creation in general:</p>
<ul>
<li>Throughout the animal kingdom we do not find the creatures separated because of color. ('Abdu'l-Baha, <i>Foundations of World Unity</i>, p. 34)</li>
<li>Every creature hath been endowed with all the potentialities it can carry. (Baha'u'llah, <i>The Summons of the Lord of Hosts</i>, p. 25)</li>
<li>I am He Who hath raised up all creatures through a word of My mouth, and My power is, in truth, equal to My purpose. (Baha'u'llah, <i>The Summons of the Lord of Hosts</i>, p. 38)</li>
</ul>
<p>It seems very clear to me that this word is used generally very broadly and connotes, not only our impotence in the face of the Creator; but also that, as created beings, we collectively share much with the rest of creation. Neither of these ideas are innovative, but these themes recur often in these teachings. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMARussellPESE_d65e.html" title="User:MARussellPESE">MARussellPESE</a> 19:51, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've read this article, and while most of it is fairly neutral, the bits on aether and evolution particularly need a lot of help. They do not represent an adequate understanding of the science involved, and are awfully misleading and one sided: in fact the solution offered simply seems to be to quote vast tracts of Baha'i scripture. I've started fixing, but this will take time. <a href="../../../b/y/r/User%7EByrgenwulf_3ce3.html" title="User:Byrgenwulf">Byrgenwulf</a> 13:09, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You have to be more specific. This page is on the <i>Baha'i Faith and science</i>, and therefore how the Baha'i Faith understands and interprets things like evolution and ether is what it is about. It's not like these views have been stated as fact, but as Baha'i belief and understanding (and have been sourced). Also it's not like these views have been introduced in the <a href="../../../e/v/o/Evolution.html" title="Evolution">evolution</a> or <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ether.html" title="Ether">ether</a> pages where of course they would not be appropriates. -- <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeff3000_72a5.html" title="User:Jeff3000">Jeff3000</a> 13:23, 21 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I understand and respect that, and understand that matters have to work accordingly; my problem is not with the article itself, more that certain parts of it are tremendously unclear and don't really say much; moreover they are not always strictly accurate (I deleted a couple of the more troublesome sentences from the aether stuff, so that's better now). In evolution, perhaps a few provisos about how science emphatically does construe the human as "just another animal" (apart from the obvious), and that this therefore represents a <i>difference</i> between the two (to which could be appended a statement, if there is one in the scripture, describing how Baha'i might divide these things into matters of scriptural truth and matters of scientific truth).</dd>
<dd>Also, what's the copyright on the Baha'i scriptures and the various other sources which are quoted a chunk at a time?</dd>
<dd>Perhaps including a conclusion (I don't know enough about Baha'i to do that) which sums up all the points made in the various sections could help improve matters? <a href="../../../b/y/r/User%7EByrgenwulf_3ce3.html" title="User:Byrgenwulf">Byrgenwulf</a> 13:39, 21 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The problem with a conclusion, is that it's dangerously close to providing a POV on the beliefs presented. Summary is fine, but I'm not certain that it such is synonymous with conclusion, which draws the reader towards... er... conclusions. I think Summary at the top, description (again, in summary) of points of departure with either mainstream science or with other religions' views of the same scientific topic for compare/contrast, and then sections going into detail.</dd>
<dd>For the record, Byrgenwulf, many of the Baha'i editors are trying to migrate the Baha'i articles into a state that is more wiki-style, neutrally presented, and balanced, but we have lives and jobs and it's a lot of work, which I'm sure you can appreciate. Your help is appreciated, and many articles are lists of quotes, which amount to stubs from which a better article can be written. Keep it up, and the Baha'i editors will certainly lend a hand. Right now we're more focused on other articles.</dd>
<dd>Last point, correcting "scientific errors" isn't always appropriate, if such an "error" is in fact a part of the belief, or was the understanding of the scientific or general community at the time of the statement given. We might understand things differently now (like light not being a wave in the ether, though that's being revisited via quantum fields and other wierdness), but if we are going to correct such things then we should note the differences, but maintain historicity.

<dd><a href="../../../b/y/r/User%7EByrgenwulf_3ce3.html" title="User:Byrgenwulf">Byrgenwulf</a> I appreciate your help in making sure this page is NPOV. Could you recommend specific places in the text where you think another statement is required. I'm still a little unclear. In regards to a conclusion, I think Christian is right, and that conclusions are not usually recommended for POV reasons.</dd>
<dd>In regards to the copyright, the law allows small percentage of a work to be reproduced if it is cited. I can't find the link right now in Wikipedia that states that, but you can see it in <a href="../../../c/o/p/Wikipedia_talk%7ECopyrights_Can_I_use..._af1e.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Copyrights/Can I use...">Wikipedia talk:Copyrights/Can I use...</a>. Thus regardless of the actual copyright, which may be over since Abdu'l-Baha died in 1921, which plus 50 = 1971 (or + 70 = 1991), the quotations may be used. -- <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeff3000_72a5.html" title="User:Jeff3000">Jeff3000</a> 15:24, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Mmmm, I see your point about the conclusion...perhaps, then, rephrasing it in the summary at the start is better; what I was meaning was not so much "putting it in a specific place" as "putting it in at all": so a summary at the top is great. I'm glad to hear copyright isn't an issue. I removed the NPOV tag and put a "confusion" one, as I feel that's a bit appropriate. I'm thinking about how best to approach the whole matter...maybe just paraphrasing the quotes? I don't know.</dd>
<dd>I also see now the problem isn't so much factual errancy as the fact that the article is <i>misleading</i> (I doubt deliberately), in that on a first reading it seems to be pointing in a direction that on closer scrutiny it actually isn't...but juggling the quotes and generally aiming for a "smoother" style should remedy it. I'll be looking at it next week when I have more time to focus on it. <a href="../../../b/y/r/User%7EByrgenwulf_3ce3.html" title="User:Byrgenwulf">Byrgenwulf</a> 15:37, 21 July 2006 (UTC)

<p>Just a question... by misleading, do you mean that the article is leading the reader to a conclusion? Or that it's not accurate?

<dd>One of the bigger problems is that it's easy for nonscientists to overstate the amount of uncertainty in science, and this article does that in several places. There's no chance that scientists will conclude that there may be life on literally every planet. Nor will scientists ever discover that "the present scientific point of view (of evolution) is not always correct".

<p>I’m interested in this discussion for several reasons: I believe in Wiki, science, and Baha’i. Now, how does someone like me balance all that? To be NPOV, this page will have to use a type of indirection which might be fun to develop. However, even that won’t bridge the ontological (and other philosophical) differences between the main-stream views of science and that being purported by Baha’is trying to integrate their belief and what they know to be true via science. The latter discipline is like looking through a key hole. Or, perhaps better, science brings things into focus. But, can any viewpoint bring everything into focus? That is, what is the ratio of things in focus versus not. Which begs the question that there are things that are outside of focus (mainly, the notion that everything cannot be subsumed within one state view – we have all sorts of things to reference here, such as <a href="../../../h/e/i/Heisenberg.html" title="Heisenberg">Heisenberg</a>) which may come with a focal change (with others then moving out). Some times, the modern views cast doubt that anything not in the current focus isn’t there. Well, this is really, in my mind, where the approaches suggested in the Writings may come into play. There is a lot of ‘uncertainty’ in science that does not affect the day-to-day mindsets since ‘trends toward the mean’ are a stronger phenomenon. The 'uncertainties' play more to those things that are out-of-focus (a necessary step is resolving issues here in order to open up effective discussion and analysis) and to what they might mean. Discussions about this can start many places, but <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quasi-empirical.html" title="Quasi-empirical">Quasi-empiricism in Mathematics</a> is one that I like (notice that there is controversy on those contents, too). There’s a lot more to say, but I’ll desist. So, how to get something Wiki-pliant will be interesting to watch and help evolve. The Writings may not be axiomatic (in some contexts), however there is a facility embedded with the Writings that is somewhat analogous. Of course, Wiki is not the proper framework for this type of discovery. Now, about the need to meet NPOV ... <a href="../../../y/a/h/User%7EYahyay19_3d76.html" title="User:Yahyay19">Yahyay19</a> 20:48, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>It's been addressed before, above, however to no apparent effect. One glaring oversight is lack of talk about motivations; methinks that such an addition might help temper the BASIS. My meager attempt at introducing a discussion on ‘Origins’ (besides it being a possible entry into the Origins page where the Faith is not mentioned) was a suggestion about how to, perhaps, start to fill the hole (recognition of which would be a good first start). When one looks at the ontological framing as it might be necessitated by the Existence of the Perfect Manifestation (this, from the Master) (aside: this was the main theme of the pages I’ve attempted before – not original research, rather, just trying to fill in the pieces – I ask you, where has such been done before?), then one might be more able to acknowledge that much which might be considered ‘quackery’ from the limiting worldview comes more to the fore in a very reasonable sense. The Gleanings suggests prior civilizations (we don’t have to assume that they were Earth-bound), for instance. There are many, many references to what are scientific subjects in the Writings. Why limit the exposition on the Faith and Science to only 3 (is it the public appeal?)? I’m not trying to use ‘wiki’ as a sand box any more than it already is due to its being the main representative, that I know of, for a new way to know and to keep knowledge current. So, I’m not asking for Origins to be reinstated. My question is what is sacrosanct for the 3 main topics when in actuality it could be larger. After all, the Faith covers the gamut. <a href="../../../y/a/h/User%7EYahyay19_3d76.html" title="User:Yahyay19">Yahyay19</a> 12:58, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>obscure</b> as in out of focus - in the sense of the above - coming into focus takes work - progression toward focus comes from the fringes - the mainstream mainly provides the impetus for working out issues of stability and reliability. So, those 3 topics are just a smattering of what could be in the discourse. <b>encyclopedic</b> has a connotation dealing with 'comprehensive' views covering an 'entire range' (of course, we know that we're dealing with a <b>Sea</b> - essentially unbounded). <a href="../../../y/a/h/User%7EYahyay19_3d76.html" title="User:Yahyay19">Yahyay19</a> 11:22, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello... I wanted to suggest we change the beginning of the section on scientific statements of the founders. 'Abdu'l-Baha does in fact seem to be stated as having propositional inerrancy (see response point number 2 in <a href="http://bahai-library.com/?file=uhj_infallibility_abdulbaha" class="external free" title="http://bahai-library.com/?file=uhj_infallibility_abdulbaha" rel="nofollow">http://bahai-library.com/?file=uhj_infallibility_abdulbaha</a> and <a href="http://bahai-library.com/?file=uhj_letters_behalf_guardian#s4" class="external free" title="http://bahai-library.com/?file=uhj_letters_behalf_guardian#s4" rel="nofollow">http://bahai-library.com/?file=uhj_letters_behalf_guardian#s4</a> ). I'd also highly suggest we incorporate some of the points from this General Comments section at <a href="http://bahai-library.com/?file=uhj_reconciliation_apparent_contradictions#s0" class="external free" title="http://bahai-library.com/?file=uhj_reconciliation_apparent_contradictions#s0" rel="nofollow">http://bahai-library.com/?file=uhj_reconciliation_apparent_contradictions#s0</a> as well as this paragraph from <a href="http://bahai-library.com/?file=uhj_letters_behalf_guardian" class="external free" title="http://bahai-library.com/?file=uhj_letters_behalf_guardian" rel="nofollow">http://bahai-library.com/?file=uhj_letters_behalf_guardian</a> , as they are very descriptive of some of the potential Baha'i responses to perceived contradictions&#160;:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"Finally, you ask whether Bahá'ís should accept all statements in the Writings as based in fact, unless there is an explicit reference to a particular statement being conditioned on other information. It should be clear from the examples provided in the memorandum of the Research Department that there are some cases where passages from the Writings affirm specific facts and other cases where passages conform to the beliefs of particular peoples. It is, therefore, necessary for the reader to determine the meaning of statements that are not explicit by applying sound hermeneutical principles found in the Teachings. While there is often room for a range of personal interpretation on such matters, and a degree of ambiguity will invariably exist in some cases, usually a common understanding is formed, which will change over time should additional evidence come to light. Differences of personal opinion about the meaning of the Text should not be allowed to create discord or wrangling among the friends."

<dd>Yes, one of our tasks is to understand how to apply this 'propositional inerrancy' (an operational issue). The Master knew what He was saying (though, we only have a paraphrase) and to whom He was speaking (western view) when He said: "If we wish to deny everything that is not sensible, then we must deny the realities which unquestionably exist. For example, ethereal matter is not sensible, though it has an undoubted existence. The power of attraction is not sensible, though it certainly exists. From what do we affirm these existences? From their signs. Thus this light is the vibration of that ethereal matter, and from this vibration we infer the existence of ether." <a href="http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/ab/SAQ/saq-48.html" class="external text" title="http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/ab/SAQ/saq-48.html" rel="nofollow">SAQ</a></dd>
<dd>Another task: study and describe that aspect of Creation to which He referred (as 'ether') such that our understanding can be applied and tested, perhaps even thereby establishing a much needed new thrust for science. No apologies are needed for daring to challenge the limits that have been imposed by man's mind and methods (albeit, however brilliant these may have been). <a href="../../../y/a/h/User%7EYahyay19_3d76.html" title="User:Yahyay19">Yahyay19</a> 13:52, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
