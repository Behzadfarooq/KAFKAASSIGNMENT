<dd>I don't exactly like this page. It comes down to opinion in most cases, and there's no concrete text describing what is and isn't a prophecy. For example, Baha'u'llah said that Germany will "lament twice", and with hindsight people will say that's a prophecy. The atomic energy thing is also much in hindsight. So this page should either be short and clear, or not here. <a href="../../../c/u/n/User%7ECunado19_ff71.html" title="User:Cunado19"><font color="#D14C04"><b>Cuñado</b></font></a> <a href="../../../b/a/h/Image%7EBahaitemplatestar.png_81d9.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/1/1d/Bahaitemplatestar.png/20px-Bahaitemplatestar.png" alt="" width="20" height="19" longdesc="../../../b/a/h/Image%7EBahaitemplatestar.png_81d9.html" /></a> - <a href="../../../c/u/n/User_talk%7ECunado19_98ea.html" title="User talk:Cunado19"><font size="-3">Talk</font></a> 18:39, 14 March 2006 (UTC)

<p>To be encyclopedic this page, instead of being just a page of links, needs to describe, quote the prophecy and for historical aspects show what has happened.

<p>According to me the following section should not be included in this article:</p>
<dl>
<dd>After Napoleon's capture by the Prussians, General Louis Jules Trochu and the politician Léon Gambetta overthrew the Second Empire and established the "Government of National Defence" which later became the conservative Third Republic. Its creation was overshadowed by the subsequent revolution in Paris known as the Paris Commune, which maintained a radical regime for two months until its bloody suppression in May 1871.</dd>

<dd>Why not. I definitly think it should be. It gives the historical result, which I copied from other Wikipedia pages.

<p>In Vignettes, there is a story of `Abdu'l Baha saying something like "there will soon be a great war in Europe. This is not based on any prophecy, just common-sense."</p>
<p>I don't have the book, if anybody else, could they quote that? I think it's valuable. Also, in <i>The Servant, the General, and Armageddon</i> it quotes `Abdu'l Baha as saying in October 1912 that</p>

<dd>I removed it because you made it sound like it was a prophecy about an individual, who you think is Jensen, when it's obviously not about an individual. The prophecy is about the date 1963, not about a person coming in 1963. If you had worded it correctly I wouldn't have deleted it. There are several other references by Shoghi Effendi about the significance of that year, and of course that was the first election of the Universal House of Justice.</dd>
<dd>Several prophecies have been deleted on this page because they are someone's personal interpretation. There's no cut and dry list of what is and isn't a prophecy, so if anything is disputed it gets deleted. <a href="../../../c/u/n/User%7ECunado19_ff71.html" title="User:Cunado19"><font color="#D14C04"><b>Cuñado</b></font></a> <a href="http://www.bahai.us/" class="external text" title="http://www.bahai.us/" rel="nofollow"></a><a href="../../../b/a/h/Image%7EBahaitemplatestar.png_81d9.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/1/1d/Bahaitemplatestar.png/20px-Bahaitemplatestar.png" alt="" width="20" height="19" longdesc="../../../b/a/h/Image%7EBahaitemplatestar.png_81d9.html" /></a> - <a href="../../../c/u/n/User_talk%7ECunado19_98ea.html" title="User talk:Cunado19"><font size="-3">Talk</font></a> 16:29, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Cunado, if you look at the source of the quote again you would see that the entire entry I made was all a quote taken directly from Baha'u'llah and the New Era.

<p>The quote appears in the prophecy section of Baha'u'llah and the New Era which is a properly referenced book. It is unfair to revert this on the basis it doesn't meet some individual's criteria of what should be on the page. None of my personal opinion is included. It's a direct quote. It's considered to be a Baha'i prophecy by Esslemont and has remained through several revisions of the book. 'Abdu'l-Baha explained prior to 1921 what was to happen in 1963. It's a prophecy. It belongs. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavecornell_8e4d.html" title="User:Davecornell">Davecornell</a> 23:31, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Please read the intro of the page: "Throughout the Bahá'í Writings, future events have been prophecied." The page is about events that Baha'u'llah and Abdu'l-Baha prophecized about, not about their descriptions of prophecies from previous dispensations. For example, the descriptions that Baha'u'llah gave about the prophecies of the Quran and the Bible in the Kitab-i-Iqan would not fit here, because he's explaining those prophecies, not making his own. So while the info is verifiable, it doesn't fit on this page. It's like putting info about trains in an article on cars because they are both modes of transportation. -- <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeff3000_72a5.html" title="User:Jeff3000">Jeff3000</a> 23:37, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Baha'u'llah explained those prophecies as they pertained to Himself or to previous historical events. The difference here is that 'Abdu'l-Baha is explaining something to come in the future, ie a foretelling, prophesying of 1963. It's in the prophecy section of Baha'u'llah and the New Era for crying out loud.... <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavecornell_8e4d.html" title="User:Davecornell">Davecornell</a> 00:05, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Again, it's not a prophecy made by Abdu'l-Baha, but one explained by him; one that is fulfilled by the Baha'i Faith, not one that the Baha'i Faith prophecizes about; there is a fundamental difference here. I really really don't think it should be here, but if you really want to put it in, don't just quote Baha'u'llah and the New Era. Quote Abdu'l-Baha from Some Answered Questions, Shoghi Effendi from God Passes By (p. 151), Shoghi Effendi from Lights of Guidance:
<dl>
<dd>"<i>"There is one thing of importance for the Bahá'ís to understand; and that is, that this prophecy refers to happening within the Faith, not occurrences outside the Faith. It refers specifically to the spread of the Faith over the face of the earth. This will be accomplished when the Bahá'í Faith is firmly established in all the virgin areas outlined in the Ten-Year Crusade, and the other goals of the Crusade are completed. Thus it behooves us to work day and night in order to accomplish this glorious goal."</i>
<dl>
<dd>(From a letter written on behalf of the Guardian to an individual believer, May 4, 1946: Some Extracts from Letter written on behalf of the Guardian on the Subject of the Prophecy of Daniel: A Compilation from the World Center to the compiler)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Shoghi Effendi from Directives from the Guardian:
<dl>
<dd>"<i>...Sometimes people strive all their lives to render outstanding service. Here is the time and opportunity to render 55 historic services; in fact the most unique in history, aiding in the fulfillment of Daniel's Prophecies of the Last Day, and the 1335 days, when men are to be blessed by the Glory of the Lord, covering the entire globe -- which is the real goal of the Ten Year Crusade.</i></dd>
<dd>"<i>In other words, when we fulfill the Ten Year Crusade we will have brought into fulfillment Daniel's great prophecy of 'Blessed is he who waits and comes to the 1335 days.' What could be more wonderful than taking part in the fulfillment of religious prophecy of over 3,000 years!</i>
<dl>
<dd>(Shoghi Effendi, Directives from the Guardian, p. 54)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>There are many more writings from Shoghi Effendi regarding Daniel's prophecy. This quote summarizes much of them:
<dl>
<dd>"<i>DANIEL'S PROPHECY -- The prophecy contained in Daniel 12:12: "Blessed is he that waiteth, and cometh to the thousand three hundred and five and thirty days." 'Abdu'l- Baha comments in a Tablet to a Kurdish Bahá'í, "Now concerning the verse in Daniel, the interpretation whereof thou didst ask. ... These days must be reckoned as solar and not lunar years. For according to this calculation a century will have elapsed from the dawn of the Sun of Truth, then will the teachings of God be firmly established upon the earth, and the Divine Light shall flood the world from the East even unto the West. Then, on this day, will the faithful rejoice!" 'Abdu'l-Bahá further explains in the same Tablet that the 1,335 years must be reckoned from AD 622, the year of Muhammad's flight from Mecca to Medina. Shoghi Effendi associates Daniel's reference to the 1,335 days and 'Abdu'l-Bahá's statements about the prophecy with the centenary of Bahá'u'lláh's declaration of His mission in 1863 and with the world-wide triumph of the Faith. He stressed that the prophecy refers to occurrences within the Bahá'í community, rather than to events in the outside world. While Shoghi Effendi clearly allied the Faith's triumph with the successful completion of the third teaching plan to be undertaken by the Bahá'ís, in his letters and in those written on his behalf, four specific dates are mentioned as marking the fulfilment of Daniel's prophecy: 1953, 1957, 1960, and 1963. Regarding the year 1960 (derived by a lunar reckoning), Shoghi Effendi anticipated, in God Passes By, p. 151, and in a number of his letters, the successful completion of a third Seven Year Plan that was to be inaugurated. Had there been a third Seven Year Plan, it would have concluded in 1960, one hundred lunar years after Bahá'u'lláh's declaration. When the Ten Year Crusade (1953-63) was announced in 1952, Shoghi Effendi linked its completion with the fulfilment of Daniel's prophecy. There are also several references in letters written on Shoghi Effendi's behalf that give 1957 as the date of the prophecy's fulfilment. In still other letters Shoghi Effendi allies the "hundred lunar years" after Bahá'u'lláh's declaration with the year 1953, although the significance of this hundred years is unclear. Thus it seems the prophecy is not fulfilled by a single date but, rather, by a process that extended over a period of time. A letter dated 7 March 1955 written on Shoghi Effendi's behalf says, "In the Ten Year Crusade, we are actually fulfilling the prophecy of Daniel, because with the completion of the Ten Year Crusade in 1963 we will have established the Faith in every part of the globe." Thus the fulfilment of the prophecy coincided with the period of the Ten Year Crusade, a span of time that included 1953, 1957, 1960, and 1963.</i>

<dd>My original objection was that your additions were POV in the way that you worded the section, with the insinuation that "blessed is he" is referring to an individual person by that title. I also fully agree with Jeff3000 that this falls into an entirely different category: of prophecies fulfilled by the Baha'i Faith, which if expanded could fill out hundreds of pages. It's also not clear how this prophecy was fulfilled and when, so there is not a verifiable source to give a conclusion. If you search the history you'll find other deleted prophecies of this sort. <a href="../../../c/u/n/User%7ECunado19_ff71.html" title="User:Cunado19"><font color="#D14C04"><b>Cuñado</b></font></a> <a href="http://www.bahai.us/" class="external text" title="http://www.bahai.us/" rel="nofollow"></a><a href="../../../b/a/h/Image%7EBahaitemplatestar.png_81d9.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/1/1d/Bahaitemplatestar.png/20px-Bahaitemplatestar.png" alt="" width="20" height="19" longdesc="../../../b/a/h/Image%7EBahaitemplatestar.png_81d9.html" /></a> - <a href="../../../c/u/n/User_talk%7ECunado19_98ea.html" title="User talk:Cunado19"><font size="-3">Talk</font></a> 01:13, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This prophecy is different from others because a specific date is involved. I know of no other prophecy (besides the thousand year prophecy already cited) that is so specific. I would think this would be a prophecy you would want to highlight.</p>
<p>I'm not sure why an absolute conclusion is necessary since information is supposed to be presented on Wikipedia in such a way that people can come to their own conclusions. And saying that a conclusion from a verifiable source is required is not the same standard that's been used for other prophecies on this page.</p>
<p>I'd be willing to change the title to something more agreeable and use the quotes from Shoghi Effendi related to the 1335 days where he explains it's the fulfillment of the Ten Year Plan. I'd use the quote from the UHJ mentioned above but I'm not sure it's verifiable. I'm not asking to include hundreds of prophecies, just this one. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavecornell_8e4d.html" title="User:Davecornell">Davecornell</a> 02:10, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There is one fundamental difference that you fail to acknoweldge; all the prophecies on this page, and the summary at the title refer to prophecies <b>made</b> by Baha'u'llah, Abdu'l-Baha and Shoghi Effendi. The prophecy you are referring to is one that is made by another dispension and is <b>fulfilled</b> (claimed) by the Baha'i Faith. The Blessed is he is not a Baha'i prophecy, but a Biblical prophecy. -- <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeff3000_72a5.html" title="User:Jeff3000">Jeff3000</a> 02:15, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If other prophecies mentioned are not verifiable then bring it up. I wouldn't mind deleting the page for the same reason that we're arguing right now. <a href="../../../c/u/n/User%7ECunado19_ff71.html" title="User:Cunado19"><font color="#D14C04"><b>Cuñado</b></font></a> <a href="http://www.bahai.us/" class="external text" title="http://www.bahai.us/" rel="nofollow"></a><a href="../../../b/a/h/Image%7EBahaitemplatestar.png_81d9.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/1/1d/Bahaitemplatestar.png/20px-Bahaitemplatestar.png" alt="" width="20" height="19" longdesc="../../../b/a/h/Image%7EBahaitemplatestar.png_81d9.html" /></a> - <a href="../../../c/u/n/User_talk%7ECunado19_98ea.html" title="User talk:Cunado19"><font size="-3">Talk</font></a> 06:55, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
