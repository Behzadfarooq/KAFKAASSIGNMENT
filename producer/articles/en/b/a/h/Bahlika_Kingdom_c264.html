<p>I remember from the days of my youth that a slaughter-ground for kine and a space for storing intoxicating spirits always distinguish the entrances of the abodes of the (Vahika) kings. On some very secret mission I had to live among the Vahikas. In consequence of such residence the conduct of these people is well known to me.

The practices of these people are very censurable. They drink the <b>liquor called Gauda</b>, and eat <b>fried barley</b> with it. They also eat <b>beef with garlic</b>.

<p>Bahlika the son of Pratipa is mentioned in the following passages in Mahabharata:-</p>
<p>Kuru king Dritarashtra's words to his son <a href="../../../d/u/r/Duryodhana.html" title="Duryodhana">Duryodhana</a>:- Even the eldest son may be passed over and deprived of the kingdom, and younger sons may, in consequence of their respectful behaviour to the aged, obtain the kingdom. So also, conversant with every virtue there was my father’s grandfather, king <b>Pratipa'<i>, who was celebrated over the three worlds. Unto him, were born three sons, Of them,</i></b> <i>Devapi <b>was the eldest,</b> Vahlika</i> the next and <b>Santanu</b> of great intelligence, who was my grandfather, was the youngest. Devapi, endued with great energy, was virtuous, truthful in speech, and ever engaged in waiting upon his father. But that best of kings had a skin-disease. Popular with both the citizens and the subjects of the provinces, respected by the good, and dearly loved by the young and the old, Devapi was liberal firmly adhering to truth, engaged in the good of all creatures, and obedient to the instructions of his father as also of the Brahmanas. He was dearly loved by his brother Vahlika as also the high-souled Santanu. Great, indeed, was the brotherly love that prevailed between him and his high-souled brothers. In course of time, the old and best of kings, Pratipa, caused all preparations to be made according to the scriptures for the installation of Devapi (on the throne). Indeed, the lord Pratipa caused every auspicious preparation. The installation of Devapi, however, was forbidden by the Brahmanas and all aged persons amongst the citizens and the inhabitants of the provinces. Hearing that the installation of his son was forbidden, the voice of the old king became choked with tears and he began to grieve for his son. Thus, though Devapi was liberal, virtuous, devoted to truth, and loved by the subjects, yet in consequence of his skin-disease, he was excluded from his inheritance. The gods do not approve of a king that is defective of a limb. Thinking of this, those bulls among Brahmanas forbade king Pratipa to install his eldest son. Devapi then, who was defective of one limb, beholding the king (his father) prevented (from installing him on the throne) and filled with sorrow on his account, retired into the woods. As regards Vahlika, abandoning his (paternal) kingdom he dwelt with his maternal uncle. Abandoning his father and brother, he obtained the highly <b>wealthy kingdom of his maternal grandfather</b>. With Vahlika’s permission, Santanu of world-wide fame, on the death of his father (Pratipa), became king of <a href="../../../k/u/r/Kuru_Kingdom_67eb.html" title="Kuru Kingdom">Kuru Kingdom</a>.

<p>A Bahlika king took part in the <a href="../../../k/u/r/Kurukshetra_War_9568.html" title="Kurukshetra War">Kurukshetra War</a>. He was related to the <a href="../../../k/a/u/Kauravas.html" title="Kauravas">Kauravas</a> and the <a href="../../../p/a/n/Pandavas.html" title="Pandavas">Pandavas</a>, and was a king in the Kuru dynasty. This make Bahlika older than <a href="../../../b/h/i/Bhishma.html" title="Bhishma">Bhishma</a>, making him the oldest among, the warriors who fought the <a href="../../../k/u/r/Kurukshetra_War_9568.html" title="Kurukshetra War">Kurukshetra War</a>. But there is references in <a href="../../../m/a/h/Mahabharata.html" title="Mahabharata">Mahabharata</a> that <a href="../../../b/h/i/Bhishma.html" title="Bhishma">Bhishma</a> was the oldest warrior in the <a href="../../../k/u/r/Kurukshetra_War_9568.html" title="Kurukshetra War">Kurukshetra War</a>. So there could be some missing king in this lineage of Bahlikas. It could be that Somadatta's father who took part in the war was the son of the Bahlika mentioned at (Mbh 1,95) as Pratipa's son.</p>
<ul>
<li>Pratipa -&gt; Devapi (became a sage)</li>
<li>Pratipa -&gt; Bahlika -&gt; Bahlika -&gt; Somadatta -&gt; Bhurisravas, Sala</li>

</ul>
<p>This makes the warrior Bahlika, contemporary to Bhishma and his son Somadatta, contemporary to Dhritarashtra. Somadatta's sons Bhurisravas and Sala also took part in the Kurukshetra War. Thus four Bahlika war-heroes, spanning three generations, fought the Kurukshetra war. King Bahlika was present in the self choice event of <a href="../../../d/r/a/Draupadi.html" title="Draupadi">Draupadi</a> the princess of <a href="../../../p/a/n/Panchala_Kingdom_b164.html" title="Panchala Kingdom">Panchala Kingdom</a>.

King Bahlika was present with the Kurus of <a href="../../../h/a/s/Hastinapura.html" title="Hastinapura">Hastinapura</a>, on almost all the important events that happened in Hastinapura:- on the arrival of <a href="../../../k/u/n/Kunti.html" title="Kunti">Kunti</a> with the young <a href="../../../p/a/n/Pandavas.html" title="Pandavas">Pandavas</a> (1,126), on the occasion of a tournament of war-craft by the Kuru princes (1,136), When the Pandavas left <a href="../../../h/a/s/Hastinapura.html" title="Hastinapura">Hastinapura</a> to the town of Varanavata (1,145), during the play of dice (2-62,72,76,79)(3,13), during the planning of <a href="../../../k/u/r/Kurukshetra_War_9568.html" title="Kurukshetra War">Kurukshetra War</a> (5-62,63) etc</p>
