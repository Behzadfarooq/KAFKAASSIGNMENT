<p>Mirlen, Mr. Tan et al: I'm correcting false information. I don't work for Mr. Bae. I'm sorry if you want Wikipedia to be an online gossip rag instead of an online encyclopaedia.</p>
<p>Perhaps you should go edit Uncyclopedia from now on.</p>
<p><br />
(back to rant) As can be seen from the following statement:</p>
<p>"A suggestion: Before posting any personal information about Bae Yong Joon publicly, please contact his management company, BOF, to make sure of the veracity of the information you are posting. BOF: <a href="http://bofkorea.com" class="external free" title="http://bofkorea.com" rel="nofollow">http://bofkorea.com</a> - Thanks!"</p>
<p>The page appears to have been sanitized by persons working on Bae's behalf, or by fans of his.</p>
<p>Korean news souces reported 8 March 2006 that the Wikipedia article on Bae Yong Jun included information that should be a matter of privacy, such as the name of an old girlfriend. An example can be seen here:</p>
<p><a href="http://sports.hankooki.com/lpage/entv/200603/sp2006030807261158390.htm" class="external free" title="http://sports.hankooki.com/lpage/entv/200603/sp2006030807261158390.htm" rel="nofollow">http://sports.hankooki.com/lpage/entv/200603/sp2006030807261158390.htm</a></p>
<p>You will see in "Page History" that on 9 March 2006 there was a flurry of editing activity, and now the page begins with the statement above about contacting his management company "before posting personal information about Bae Yong Joon publicly." <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Oranckay (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Oranckay_d523.html" title="Special:Contributions/Oranckay">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

<dd>Eh, doesn't state in Wikipedia somewhere that we are NOT censored? I do not like the idea of Wikipedia turning into a censored encyclopedia. In a way, if Wikipedia did get censored it destroys the purpose of allowing everyone to edit the "free encyclopedia." —<a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMirlen_c835.html" title="User:Mirlen">Mirlen</a> 01:57, 26 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There are way too many links on this article. Wikipedia's article should not be a link farm or serve as a directory of links. I overhauled with the blogs—we should really keep fansites to a minimum, unless the information of those sites were used in the article.</p>
<p>Also, the 'About Bae-Yong Joon' section could be merged into either the overview or his career. And is the commercial section really needed? An actor should be noted for his/her films/dramas/etc., not commercials. —<a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMirlen_c835.html" title="User:Mirlen">Mirlen</a> 01:51, 26 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>There has been a recent scam of removal of personal data on Bae Yong Jun. Please post violent objections here and explain why.

<p>First, welcome to wikipedia. I can forgive you, since I believe that you are new to wikipedia. I am happy that you are at least keen enough to discuss this matter with me.</p>
<p>I would suggest that you look at famous personalities such as <a href="../../../j/o/d/Jodie_Foster_9072.html" title="Jodie Foster">Jodie Foster</a>, <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Gere_57db.html" title="Richard Gere">Richard Gere</a>. There is no harm mentioning personal information in <b>general</b>, because every piece of information influences the outlook of an article, and thus attracts the reader as a good article (See <a href="../../../p/u/s/Wikipedia%7EPushing_to_1.0_e34b.html" title="Wikipedia:Pushing to 1.0">Wikipedia:Pushing to 1.0</a>. I did cite sources, as by <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Fact_and_Reference_Check_47bc.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Fact and Reference Check">Wikipedia:WikiProject Fact and Reference Check</a>, and the very <b>External Links</b> section provides the essential citations. Look at the fan craze section and the x fact--an internet link serves as a citation. Furthermore, he had seperated. I believe that Bae wouldn't mind about it so much--in fact, he officially publicised this fact. All information on Bae on the internet are officially acknowledged by Bae. Provate informmation, such as his home address---you will never find it on the net. Did I violate his provacy, in this case?</p>
<p>In contrast, your proposed edition of his Acting Career tells only the roles he acted as in his filmography. And also, I do not wish to see <a href="../../../p/p/i/Ppilku.html" title="Ppilku">Ppilku</a> removed---he did act in a role in this movie, only that it is a minor role---our objective on wikipedia is to make it the most authorative source of information in the world. Perhaps you can look at <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia%7EManual_of_style_f2a6.html" title="Wikipedia:Manual of style">Wikipedia:Manual of style</a> before reconsidering your edits.</p>
<p>Also, from the comment stated on <strong class="selflink">Talk:Bae Yong Joon</strong> that the Bae's company staff and that many of his fans (including me, of course, but I'm neutral) are opposed to the content of wikipedia--cited in an Hankooki article cited on the talk page of Bae. This is a serious matter that his staff should not poke into---look at <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marty_Meehan_3b62.html" title="Marty Meehan">Marty Meehan</a>. A section has even stated his wikipedia involvements on "correcting" his personal data has been edited and a page on <a href="http://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Story_preparation/_Research-United_States_Department_of_Justice_workers_among_government_Wikipedia_vandals" class="extiw" title="wikinews:Story_preparation/_Research-United_States_Department_of_Justice_workers_among_government_Wikipedia_vandals">Wikinews:Story preparation/ Research-United States Department of Justice workers among government Wikipedia vandals</a> his staff has been put up. The American media has even reported of Wikipedia involvement of his staff---there are no other personalities who does such things besides him for now. This is ultimately bringing a smear to Bae's reputation---parallel to Meehan case, sad to say.</p>
<p>Bae has done nothing much controversial, as far as I know, and he is a good man. However, sooner or later, I'm afraid that if the wikipedia controversy continues to be visible on the news media on Bae's article on Bae, he might end up the same fate as Marty Meehan. I won't edit it, but there are lots of other zealous wikipedians who would not hesitate. As I say, wikipedia is a fierece and wild place, at least to some extent. I have suffered before. Also, please don't use vulagrities on me. <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_personal_attacks_15ec.html" title="Wikipedia:No personal attacks">Wikipedia:No personal attacks</a> deals such behaviour seriously. Please be gracious.</p>
<p>Edit as you wish, but please do not remove information explicitely just because you believe that my edits contains false information/old, dead rumors of Bae. Comb his official site and official fanpage in all avaliable languages---Korean, English, Japanese and Chinese are the most readily avaliable sources, especially the links <b>cited</b> in the external links. Ask me only if you really can't find the points you still doubted, but please don't take matters into your own hands, and let's settle it as swiftly as possible.

<p>Forgive me? You should be begging Mr. Bae's forgiveness. I'm sorry if the National Enquirer isn't hiring right now, but posting continued lies about someone doesn't make you morally superior.</p>
<p>I tried to email you, but apparently you're too cowardly to put up your real contact information.</p>
<p>Fact: The supposed "girlfriend" link leads to a page of speculation and gossip, not fact. Please take your vacation time from Wikipedia to try to learn the difference.</p>
<p>Fact: you did get his family's names wrong. Repeatedly. If you check with official sources instead of fan pages, maybe you can get something right.</p>
<p>Fact: Fan pages are not always correct. Not even for Jodie Foster. Honest.</p>
<p>Fact: Ppilku isn't listed on his filmography because he was an extra in the film. Please check official sources instead of fansites and gossip columns. Thank you.</p>
<p>As for Marty Meehan, if threatening BYJ with smear tactics because people want Wikipedia to contain correct information instead of gossip, speculation, and just plain wrong entries, your vacation is badly needed.</p>
<p>I have combed his fansites and official sites, and I know the difference between gossip, wishful thinking (like on the part of the men who recently released Ppilku to video claiming BYJ in a starring role), and facts. If you would stick to facts instead of trying to be defamer.com for the Hallyu set, it would make things a hell of a lot simpler.</p>
<p>Thanks for the advice on formatting. I admit I'm kind of lost when it comes to that. But yellow journalism, I know - I used to write for The Star. Yeah, the one in the supermarket. So I know from tabloid garbage, and when it masquerades as a serious encyclopaedia entry, it makes me sick, Ignatius.</p>
<p>I live in Honolulu sometime, and would love to sit down and debate why you think posting lies is better than posting the truth sometime over a lavender bubble at Coffee or Tea?, I'm willing to listen. But if you're going to get all pretentious over "he deserves to be maligned and lied about, he's a celebrity", you're not going to get very far with me.</p>

<p>Relax, please. You are too agitated.</p>

<p>I did not post lies or false information. Also, it is my right to decide whether to release/publicise my e-mail address. To stop adding fuel to fire, please be gracious, for <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_personal_attacks_15ec.html" title="Wikipedia:No personal attacks">Wikipedia:No personal attacks</a> severely deals with people who lack courtesy like you, such as using the word "cowardly". I can approach you on harsh lines if you go on at this rate.</p>
<p>I"ll prove to you right now. Apparently you never comb the Chinese and Japanese websites on him. If you can't comprehend Chinese/Japanese/Korean, ask a translator. I am very bad in translating.</p>

He acted as a side-role, but that doesn't amount to him being discredited. And also, I never use gossip columns as sources.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Fan pages obtain information from the actor himself. Thus they are considered authorative. One should not narrow his sources. Also, articles from newspapers are reliable. Please see <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">Wikipedia:Reliable sources</a> first. I also get sources from <a href="../../../l/i/a/Lianhe_Zaobao_a7bb.html" title="Lianhe Zaobao">Lianhe Zaobao</a> and <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Straits_Times_2926.html" title="The Straits Times">The Straits Times</a> on news about Bae. All national newspapers are <b>also</b> reliable sources.</li>
</ul>
<p>I only mention that Bae's status was similar to Marty Meehan---his officers, and fans, like Bae, are trying to distort information to suit their own needs. I never mentioned that Bae is the conspirator. Instead of me defaming him, you are doing exactly to me. Sadly. Regardless of my job or social status, all legislative laws applies to all people. Thus there is no need to ask for apology for this uproar is caused by people around him, just like Marty Meehan, sadly. <b>Bae and Meehan are both innocent</b>. They (People around them) never edit wikipedia in accordance to <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">Wikipedia:Neutral point of view</a>.

Browse this page itself if you still oppose to my standards of gauging reliable sources. With proper sources, how can you denounce that my information is <b>false</b>?</p>

Please go also through <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not</a> before going ahead with your actions. By the way, the article above states an editor's opinion of Bae's information in wikipedia. According to <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia%7EManual_of_style_f2a6.html" title="Wikipedia:Manual of style">Wikipedia:Manual of style</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28people%29_893d.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (people)">Wikipedia:Notability (people)</a>, both the arrangement of the article and content cites that my version gives much more general and appropriate coverage of a person's publicised data. Private data can be found nowhere in the world except the person and the people closest around himself. Thus, if I can't provide appropriate sources by wikipedia's standards, fair enough to doubt my authenticity of my contributions. But that's not the case. If you insist, check again <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bae_Yong_Joon&amp;oldid=59415660" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bae_Yong_Joon&amp;oldid=59415660" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> and prove me wrong.</p>
<p>And lastly, please sign of your name with four tides like this: ~~~~. Also, any further unreasonable arguement or charges against me would be refered directly to a wikipedia's adminstrator, for I am too busy to entertain such things.

<p>As for me, while Fabshelly has accused me of posting false information on <strong class="selflink">Talk:Bae Yong Joon</strong>, I have already patched up by adding essential citations to my contributions in accordance to the standardised guideline of <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">Wikipedia:Reliable sources</a>.

<p>The link on Koh's Gyudhae's? A section is at least needed to be elaborated. But I believe that mention must not be ommitted, similar to those of <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marty_Meehan_3b62.html" title="Marty Meehan">Marty Meehan</a>--he is not involved in the wikipedia's scandal but yet a page/section is mentioned about this difficult scandal.

<p>Whatever it is, I must conclude that Fabshelly is very wrong to accuse me of saying that I am adding untrue facts<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bae_Yong_Joon&amp;diff=60559787&amp;oldid=60448204" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bae_Yong_Joon&amp;diff=60559787&amp;oldid=60448204" rel="nofollow">[10]</a>--apparently I did cite my sources properly, in accordance to standards set by <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">Wikipedia:Reliable sources</a>. <a href="../../../m/r/_/User%7EMr_Tan_d5d8.html" title="User:Mr Tan">Mr Tan</a> 06:37, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>What happened? Who vandalized the article?</p>
<p>If someone vandalized the Bae article by removing a lot of content, then copy/paste the removed information back into the current article right now.</p>
<p>Also, who is the user that is vandalizing? Please leave your name. Shame on yourself, since you feel yourself as inferior and can't even write your name down. Don't violate Wikipedia's policies.</p>
<p>Wikipedia is not a war, it is an encyclopedia. A reason why you probably don't leave your name is probably because you know your claims are too weak.

<p>Removal of inconvinent facts is not acceptable, especially when <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECite_your_sources_2f5e.html" title="Wikipedia:Cite your sources">Wikipedia:Cite your sources</a> citations are provided. How can Fabshelly claim that he had not revealed the name of his girlfriend, when the name of the girlfriend is <a href="http://groups.msn.com/endlesslovewebportal" class="external text" title="http://groups.msn.com/endlesslovewebportal" rel="nofollow">here</a>? Such information ultimately originated from Bae. Also, the information is reconfirmed in official celebrity magazines supported by the government. These information is from the I-weekly, a Mediacorp publication funded by the Singapore government. How could you just say that it is a fan site or blog? Yes, these are not accepted as main citations in accordance to <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">Wikipedia:Reliable sources</a>, but I have not violated them in reference to Bae's private life.</p>
<p>Also, the purpose of being an wikipedian is to be as neutral as possible and as objective as possible, not prescriptive. See <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conflict_12e4.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conflict">Wikipedia:Naming conflict</a> for this quote. As said, unless you can prove that my edits are wrong, do not edit according to your feelings. Especially the wikipedia controversy section. Facts and facts. You cannot take Koh's article to gauge the standard of the article. Koh is only one man's opinion, and I have already highlighted it on the controversy section. Rewriting the paragraph to suit his interests violates <a href="../../../n/p/o/Wikipedia%7ENPOV_7fb1.html" title="Wikipedia:NPOV">Wikipedia:NPOV</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EContent_disclaimer_8d69.html" title="Wikipedia:Content disclaimer">Wikipedia:Content disclaimer</a>. And you have violated these rules repeatedly, despite repeated warnings. I have also noticed that Bae acted in Ppilku as an extra. Yes, as a minor role. The filmography in <a href="../../../p/p/i/Ppilku.html" title="Ppilku">Ppilku</a> states so, and taht's enough. I don't see the point of you doing that. And your "As an extra" edit reflects <a href="../../../w/e/a/Wikipedia%7EWeasel_terms_84f8.html" title="Wikipedia:Weasel terms">Wikipedia:Weasel terms</a>. Such biased edits are not welcomed on wikipedia.</p>

<p>Nobody needs to take anybody to RfC, but can I ask everybody to just leave the article alone for now. The way I see it, the dispute revolves around three main issues:</p>
<ol>
<li>The inclusion of disputed facts about Joon's family and his marital status;</li>
<li>Whether he should be described as having been an extra in the film PpilKu; and</li>
<li>The wording of the "Wikipedia controversy" section.</li>
</ol>
<p>I have suggestions for all of these points:</p>
<ol>
<li>These will be included if and only if proper sources for them can be found that satisfy <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, so not blogs.</li>
<li>I can't see any reason not to mention it, since it doesn't really harm readability, and provides the reader with more information.</li>
<li>I'm working on a more NPOV wording, which I'll post anon.</li>
</ol>

<li>Yes, check the references section. I certainly do not use blogs as references. I cited in accordance to <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">Wikipedia:Reliable sources</a></li>
<li>Fabshelly's edit "as an extra" is clearly a reflection of Wikipedia:No peacock terms. What does he mean, as an extra? Yes, Bae played a small role in the film Ppilku. Extra means nothing to this article. It is an ambiguious term. Many other actors who played minor roles in films do not have their filmography "as an extra" like this? Isn't it? Take <a href="../../../a/r/n/Arnold_Schwarzenegger_088f.html" title="Arnold Schwarzenegger">Arnold Schwarzenegger</a>'s <a href="../../../a/r/o/Around_the_World_in_80_Days_%282004_film%29_6c4f.html" title="Around the World in 80 Days (2004 film)">Around the World in 80 Days (2004 film)</a>. He acted as a side-role, but that doesn't amount to him being mentioned "as an extra" in the article. Rather, I feel that the name of the person which Bae played as should be mentioned. Just take a look at the filmographies of any actors of any country. Or look at how imdb uses certain style of words of the actor's roles in specific movies.</li>
<li>I would suggest that you take a look at <a href="../../../c/o/n/Congressional_staffer_edits_to_Wikipedia_af58.html" title="Congressional staffer edits to Wikipedia">Congressional staffer edits to Wikipedia</a>. The controversy section is modelled on those of the wikipedia controversy section of <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marty_Meehan_3b62.html" title="Marty Meehan">Marty Meehan</a>, which is removed by some users tentatively. Furthermore, Koh's article is only a one man's opinion of wikipedia. He is just voicing his displeasure, without thinking that his views on editing wikipedia certainly does violate several wikipedia's policies and guidelines, which I have hyperlinked on this talk page on past discussions. Of course, you are welcome to neutralise the content, but you must not forget to be as objective as possible. Check the history of this article from March, and see Fabshelly's deletion of certain inconvinent facts, inspired by Koh, I guess.</li>
<li>I hope you would take your time to think through the problem. The reason why I proposed for RfC is because Fabshelly has violated several internal policies and guidelines which I have highlighted. This is certainly not acceptable. Unless Fabshelly reasons out his edits properly in an objective manner (which he isn't), or realises that what he is doing violates wikipedia's policies, otherwise we have to take the appropriate steps. Thus we have to monitor Fabshelly's edits in order to stop him if he makes any edits violating policies and guidelines set by wikipedia.

<li>What about groups.msn.com? baeyongjoon.blogsome.com? Reference number five links to a page without content.</li>
<li>Ok, change that to "if someone can find a source saying that he was an extra".</li>
<li>The congressional staffer section is far less strongly worded than the section in this article. I'd ask you to reserve judgement until you see my text.</li>
<li>While it may ultimately be necessary for you to bring an RfC against Fabshelly if he is unreasonable, this should not be considered until all avenues of negotiation have been exhausted.</li>

<p>Here is some text for an NPOV version of the "Wikipedia controversy" section:</p>
<p>In 2006, Koh Gyudhae of Hankooki, along with a segment of Bae's fans criticsed wikipedia's article on Bae, citing privacy reasons. Koh went further by voicing his view that "unnecessary" information should be removed. Following the publication of the newspaper, edits including the removal of some alleged inconvenient facts were made.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> <sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup>Some editors felt that this was contrary to Wikipedia's internal guidelines and policies.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>

<p>David, I must say that you have been half-sleeping all this while. The text Fabshelly written is very NPOV in style.</p>
<p>I have also proven the guidelines Fabshelly violated and you are trying to compromise with him that "some editors", which is wrong of you to do that as you are trying to favour his expression of his opinion on Koh's article. His edits certainly lacked objectiveness, as compared to mine, which I have shown proper ctations. My controversy section is modelled on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Marty_Meehan&amp;oldid=59781383" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Marty_Meehan&amp;oldid=59781383" rel="nofollow">[11]</a>, which has been analysed by many editors. In fact, what you are doing is partially supporting Fabshelly's actions, which is violating some of wikipedia's policies and guidelines. Policies and guidelines are something that all should follow and not violate it. They are rules that are laid down to earth by all wikipedians, and all wikipedians who are familiar with these laws would agree to it and abide with.</p>
<p>Compromise can only be established if both sides do not violate any laws of wikipedia, or are near NPOV in some aspects. Protection of wikipedia's policies and guidelines comes first, along with factual accuracy in terms of objectiveness and not prescriptiveness in terms of one man's opinion. Wikipedia is against biased content, if you chek out at <a href="../../../n/p/o/Wikipedia%7ENPOV_7fb1.html" title="Wikipedia:NPOV">Wikipedia:NPOV</a>, if you are not sure about what exactly how neutrality is being <b>judged</b>. If compromising an NPOV version against one which is very biased, it is wrong to do that as you are also trying to compromise these internal policies and guidelines which are <b>laid down to earth</b>. If someone opposes those guidelines, a vote should be held to see whether the policy should be maintained, or be made into a guideline if the opposition minority is quite large. See <a href="../../../p/o/l/Wikipedia%7EPolicies_and_guidelines_cdad.html" title="Wikipedia:Policies and guidelines">Wikipedia:Policies and guidelines</a> for more information.</p>
<p>It is a good idea that you have proposed to compromise. However, before doing so, I would suggest that you check both sides for neutrality by analysing Koh's article and all of the affected wikipedia's policies and guidelines. Compromise can only work if both sides do not violate policies and guidelines, and are near-NPOV in nature. I hope that this would be helpful to your judgement in compromising various versions of a same topic. <a href="../../../m/r/_/User%7EMr_Tan_d5d8.html" title="User:Mr Tan">Mr Tan</a> 02:21, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>So you're happy with Fabshelly's text? Fine. Assuming you actually meant "POV" when you said "NPOV". Have you got a reliable secondary source saying that it ran afoul of Wikipedia policies and guidelines? It is your POV that the edits were a violation of WP policies and guidelines, it is Fabshelly's POV that they were not. It is NPOV to say that some felt that they were, and, by implication, that some felt they weren't. I would prefer it if you were a little less rude and patronising, seeing as I'm basically doing this (agreeing to mediate) at your request. --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid.Mestel_2c0e.html" title="User:David.Mestel">David Mestel</a><sup>(<a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavid.Mestel_63c9.html" title="User talk:David.Mestel">Talk</a>)</sup> 07:07, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Cool it, man. What I am saying is my compilation of his edits from June onwards, when he first made a overhauling change to the article. Apparently you did not look into the article's history as instructed. As a meditator, you have to listen and follow necessary instructions from both sides.</p>
<p>If I am unneutral, I would have just blindly condemned Fabshelly is very unneutral in his edits. How can you say that "actually meant "POV" when you said "NPOV". "? Prove it to me otherwise if you really mean it. A person making unsourced claims would be rejected. Like wise, if a politician accuses another of committing something wrong without ground-to-earth and proven facts, he could be accused of libel and slander. The same real-life rule applies here too.</p>
<p>My contribution of the controversy section was actually meant to neutralise the link added by Fabshelly on Koh's point, of which he was greatly inspired by Koh's suggestions. As I have said, my contribution is modelled on Marty Meehan's wikipedia controversy section. A large portion of wikipedians have accepted that, although not others.</p>
<p>Such a trival matter little news reporting would have done. Policies and guidelines are established through voting, and they can be used as sources when necessary like this case. This is totally an internal matter, and like as I say, if the best source isn't avaliable, then look for the second most reliable source. I have already given the best hard proof copy of fabshelly's violations. In RfC, matters are similarly solved like that. It is better than second-hand sources provided by news companies. That Marty Meehan article apparently stated "ran afoul internal guidelines" without providing any citations to which laws the congress people violated. I did provide primary sources, which is even more direct in nature.</p>
<p>Secondary sources, I believe, are supportive sources and are optional. Take the parliment of a country for example. If a person has committed a stealing crime, where does the lawyers and judges obtain sources to prosecute the accused? Surely they can't look for secondary sources such as news reports of past events very similar to the person they are prosecuting to. They would have to refer to the laws set by that country. Laws are for all people to adhere by strictly, just like wikipedia's policies and to a great extent the guidelines. Distorting the law for one case belittles the authority of the given law, and this means that nobody would ever want to follow it. In that case, the whole infrastructure of the country/organisation would collaspe as all people are taking the laws into their own hands.</p>
<p>If I did not provide proper backings with my statements, then you can say that I am not objective and very biased. The backings I sustained from policies and guidelines are very appropriate, for tehse are established by the wikipedian community, and then written down on hard paper. If you oppose or doubt the wikipedian laws, you are free to hold a vote to see if the laws should be changed. You cannot compromise the authority of wikipedia's policies and guidelines just like this. Your compromise would have been very neutral if Fabshelly's edit had not violated wikipedia's laws.</p>
<p>Anyway, do you want me to highlight the statements of which Fabshelly's edits violated if you can't find it or doubt so? If you have any doubts that my stance proves Fabshelly's edits violates wikipedia's laws, please clarify. If you think the section is too strong, by all means soften the stance to a one which you think is more or less moderate, but do not modify the original meaning of the content at the expense of compromising with Fabshelly's .</p>
<p>I would therefore suggest that you look at the earlier discussions on this talk page to see the quotes from the policies and guidelines pages I have highlighted. I would suggest that you look at them carefully and think about all I have said carefully, and particularly <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EContent_disclaimer_8d69.html" title="Wikipedia:Content disclaimer">Wikipedia:Content disclaimer</a>. <a href="../../../m/r/_/User%7EMr_Tan_d5d8.html" title="User:Mr Tan">Mr Tan</a> 09:08, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm sorry. Thank you for pointing out my confusion between the POV and NPOV mistakes.</p>
<p>(Since two policies clash) All right. Let's get down to the basics. No more talking anymore about this time-dragging conflict.</p>
<p>You, as a neutral person, would you accept to negotiate with someone who uses such uncouth language against his opposition just because he hated or disliked? Please take a look at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Fabshelly#Oh.2C_please." class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Fabshelly#Oh.2C_please." rel="nofollow">[12]</a> and check the history for verification.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Fabshelly&amp;diff=63752718&amp;oldid=63459113" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Fabshelly&amp;diff=63752718&amp;oldid=63459113" rel="nofollow">[13]</a> I think that some one who uses such uncouth langauge such as "pissing contest and have a small dick" does not have the mood and proper attitude to negotiate at all. I do not wish to negotiate with anyone without the basic proper manners, which his parents should have thought him as a child. People with such uncouth behaviour do not have the sufficient mentality to handle proper negotiations. As for you, as a meditator between me and Fabshelly, I think for now we can put the matter to a rest. There is nothing more to discuss with a person with such uncouth and childish behaviour. A person who is mature enough would control his feelings, and negotiate on with style, just like the diplomats in the Pyongyang six-way talks.</p>
<p>I believe that as civilised human beings, we, just like Americans who rejected negotiation with terrorists (see <a href="../../../o/s/a/Osama_bin_Laden_a745.html" title="Osama bin Laden">Osama bin Laden</a> who offered a truce with them earlier on) or people with inferior behaviour who uses the wrong avenue to express their displeasure. See <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_personal_attacks_15ec.html" title="Wikipedia:No personal attacks">Wikipedia:No personal attacks</a>. Last but not least I must thank you for the effort you put in to meditate. As for the two of us, there is nothing to negotiate with a person who lacks proper manners and mentality. <a href="../../../m/r/_/User%7EMr_Tan_d5d8.html" title="User:Mr Tan">Mr Tan</a> 15:34, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Of course I would continue to negotiate, for as long as is possible. I would just make sure not to be cowed by the attacks. I will leave a message on Fabshelly's talk page, inviting him to participate in this mediation. --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid.Mestel_2c0e.html" title="User:David.Mestel">David Mestel</a><sup>(<a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavid.Mestel_63c9.html" title="User talk:David.Mestel">Talk</a>)</sup> 14:50, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Actually, the "pissing contest" remark wasn't from me, and yes, I would like to continue mediation, especially since Mr. Tan has so many other complaints against him. Also, if there was any "attacking", it was entirely on Mr. Tan's part, as the other complaints against him show a pattern of abusive behavior on his part. <a href="../../../f/a/b/User%7EFabshelly_9e3b.html" title="User:Fabshelly">Fabshelly</a> 08:28, 26 March 2007 (UTC)fabshelly</p>

<p>It is my understanding that Asian names are generally given with the surname first; in this case, the name would be Yong-jun Bae.
