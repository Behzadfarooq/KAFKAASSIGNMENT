<p>actually, per korean naming convention, it seems the article should be named <strike>"Paektusan" (in north korean mr romanization)</strike>. unless it's considered a <b>korean</b> place, not just a north korean place name. <strike>or if "baekdu mountain" is a firmly established english name.</strike> Appleby 00:42, 20 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>unless anyone wants to chime in, i think we can go ahead and rename this to Baekdusan, since it is an iconic place for all of korea, not just the modern north korean state. it's in the south korean national anthem and relevant to ancient korean history. so, being a <b>korean</b> topic, per <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28Korean%29_dd57.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (Korean)">Wikipedia: Naming conventions (Korean)</a> and <a href="../../../r/e/v/Revised_romanization_of_Korean_52a8.html" title="Revised romanization of Korean">Revised romanization of Korean</a>, this topic should be romanized Baekdusan. Appleby 18:12, 20 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>As for romanization, google says mr romanization is more common than revised romanization. Another thing to consider: Mount Paektu (or Mount Baekdu) is the most common form. Paektu Mountain (or Baekdu Mountain) comes next. Paektusan (or Baekdusan) is least common. And Britanica never used the last form. It only has Mount Paektu and Paektu Mountain. --<a href="../../../k/u/s/User%7EKusunose_9678.html" title="User:Kusunose">Kusunose</a> 23:06, 20 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>googling most korean place names will get you more mr, just because rr is more recent, &amp; some publication simply have a policy of using mr, as opposed to wikipedia's choice of rr. e.g. pusan &amp; koryo are more common, but we still use busan &amp; goryeo, following rr. there are very few exceptions, such as taekwondo and kimchi, where korean words have become so firmly established in english as to be loanwords. i don't think baekdusan, in any spelling, qualifies. so it's just a matter of being consistent within wikipedia.</p>
<p>under either rr or mr, and to be consistent with other korean mountain articles in wikipedia, "san" is a part of the word, without space or hyphenation. i'm ok with either baekdusan or paektusan, but would prefer the former, as i said, because i think it's a korean iconic location, rather than just a north korean place. Appleby 23:18, 20 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Ok, I now understand commonness of romanazation is irrelevant and the article name should be detarmined based on whether this article is genral Korean topic or North Korea specific topic, per naming conventtion. I have no preference and don't mind whichever is used. As to the other issue, I think we should bring this to <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28Korean%29_dd57.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (Korean)">Wikipedia:Naming conventions (Korean)</a>. For river names, ommiting -gang and adding river is common. For islands, -do is commonly included. For mountains, -san is commonly included in Wikipedia but seems not in many other publications. We should establish naming convension that follows common English usage before moving this article. FYI, -san is also part of the word in Japanese (e.g. Fujisan) but Japanese naming convenstion says more common English usage, Mount Fuji, to be used. --<a href="../../../k/u/s/User%7EKusunose_9678.html" title="User:Kusunose">Kusunose</a> 02:49, 21 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>i see your point too. i'd just like to see consistency, but don't have strong feelings either way. it's really a vague judgment call, but i'd say fuji (unlike fujisan) is established in english; han river (of seoul) is truly a toss-up, though i'd lean slightly against it, &amp; baekdu/paektu (or, for that matter, baekdusan/paektusan) really hasn't entered english to the same level. i don't think baekdu mountain is "wrong," but if i were creating an article now, i'd have chosen baekdusan as the name. Appleby 06:49, 21 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>From what I see, there's no real consensus for the move, is there?

<p>While I agree that Paektusan is an iconic Korean location, RR should only be applied to places over which the ROK has actual jurisdiction. Paektusan is completely out of its geographic sphere, ergo Paektusan over Baekdusan. Also, the conventions are, on both sides of the DMZ I believe, to include geographic suffixes (e.g., -san) when they are routinely used as part of the name in spoken Korean. Ergo, Paektusan (or Baekdusan) over Paektu Mountain or Baekdu Mountain. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Deng Beatles (<a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDeng_Beatles_0798.html" title="User talk:Deng Beatles">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Deng_Beatles_c2dc.html" title="Special:Contributions/Deng Beatles">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<p>The link for the lake (Cheonji) at the summit of Baekdu Mountain is completely incorrect. The lake which is linked to the page is not the lake at the summit of the mountain. Take a look at the picture on the Tianchi Lake page (the lake currently and incorrectly linked to the Baekdu Mountain page). If you notice, there are boats in the picture. How exactly would boats be carried to a lake at the top of a mountain which is 2,750 meters tall? Also Baekdu Mountain is the tallest mountain in all of Korea (North and South); the mountains the background of the picture of Lake Tianchi are taller. Furthermore, the latitude/longitude coordinates of Lake Tianchi and Baekdu Mountain are similar, but not the same. Either the picture is wrong on the Lake Tianchi page (which I tend to doubt), or the link is incorrect and should be removed.</p>

<dd>Thanks for catching that! The link is correct, the picture was wrong. As its caption said, it is a picture of "Tianchi in Xinjiang," a different lake by the same name.

<p>I'm against this. First, Baekdusan is usually written "Paekdusan" so your searches should have no results. Also, most of your searches should result in the Mountain Ranges, not the mountain itself. i have done similiar searches, and there's hardly any hits of the "Changbaishan" for the mountain itself, without any connection to the mountain range.</p>
<p>Also, since when did the Han Chinese have Baekdusan under their control? It was only after PRC got the whole of Manchuria. Han Nationalists will argue that they had Manchuria during the Han and Tang age, but the poblem is that both dynasties never went that far east.</p>
<p>Yuje, I have to say that I'm pretty tired of you Han nationalist views. Please leave Korean things alone. --<a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGeneral_Tiger_b180.html" title="User:General Tiger">General Tiger</a> 03:55, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>If we look at the above searches, it seems that the two versions are similar. therefore, we have a bit of a deadlock.</p>
<p>However, I advocate the Baekdusan variates since</p>
<p>1) Even the Chinese sometimes uses the Korean style of White-headed Mountain (which, according to <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28common_names%29_764d.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (common names)">Wikipedia:Naming conventions (common names)</a>, should give Baekdusan variates a hand)</p>
<p>2) We already have the <a href="../../../c/h/a/Changbai_Mountains_ba2d.html" title="Changbai Mountains">Changbai Mountains</a> Ranges</p>
<p>3) The highest peak of the mountain is in North Korea, which is on the southern side of Cheonji.</p>
<p>Therefore, we should include the name Changbaishan in the article itself, but put the title as Baekdusan or the such.</p>

<dd>To reuse Good_friend100's argument, since the mountain range is already at Changbai Mountains, it would be confusing for the most prominent mountain to feature the name using a different romanization system. So for consistency's sake, shouldn't the name of the highest peak be in the same romanization system as well? Or does the argument work only in one direction? Furthermore, this is the English encyclopedia, so our primary consideration should be English usage, not Chinese or Korean usage. As I said above, Changbai is a consistently used name not only in search engine hits, but among multiple encyclopedias as well. Also, Baekdu is used to refer to a mountain rage as well, so that applies both ways. And I don't believe that Baitou is a name used commonly in China. Baitou usually refers to a city in <a href="../../../i/n/n/Inner_Mongolia_530b.html" title="Inner Mongolia">Inner Mongolia</a>, and a google search that removes Wiki terms has only one mention of such a name for the mountain. <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hs=46l&amp;hl=en&amp;q=Baitou+-wikipedia&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hs=46l&amp;hl=en&amp;q=Baitou+-wikipedia&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[32]</a>--<a href="../../../y/u/j/User%7EYuje_76b7.html" title="User:Yuje">Yuje</a> 08:04, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Will all involved please filter Wikipedia from their search terms by using the command "-wikipedia"? Wikipedia hits greatly inflate search terms. For example, searching for <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=baekdusan" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=baekdusan" rel="nofollow">Baekdusan</a> gives over 10,000 hits, but removing wikipedia produces only <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=baekdusan+-wikipedia&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=baekdusan+-wikipedia&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">901 hits</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Also, Visviva, i don't neccessarily agree that the term "hotel" need to be filtered from the search, since the hotel actually does appear to be located in Changbai, and thus is a legitimate hit for Changbai mountain. It doesn't appear to be a case where the hotel refers to a different location or term. Furthermore, "Baekdu" refers to a mountain range as well, (wiki article at <a href="../../../b/a/e/Baekdudaegan.html" title="Baekdudaegan">Baekdudaegan</a>), so Baekdu isn't any more unambiguous than Changbai is. Given that both names contain a degree of ambiguity, I prefer that we keept the name at the more common version. --<a href="../../../y/u/j/User%7EYuje_76b7.html" title="User:Yuje">Yuje</a> 08:00, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm not sure if that first request was directed at me, but my search links above <i>are</i> filtered against Wikipedia. I do learn, slowly. &#160;:-) As for the hotel, I'm not sure either; but regardless, the difference between the Korean and Chinese frequencies just doesn't seem very striking; it's not the kind of difference that would suggest that one name has become established in common usage, while the other has not. The <a href="../../../b/a/e/Baekdudaegan.html" title="Baekdudaegan">Baekdudaegan</a> is a bit of a red herring, methinks, since that "range" is hardly ever referred to as the "Baekdu Mountains," while the range around Baekdu/Baitou is almost always referred to as the "Changbai (or Changbaek or Jangbaek) Mountains." This is getting a bit off-topic, but compare <a href="http://www.google.com/search?client=opera&amp;rls=en&amp;q=%22Baekdu+mountains%22&amp;sourceid=opera&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?client=opera&amp;rls=en&amp;q=%22Baekdu+mountains%22&amp;sourceid=opera&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8" rel="nofollow">"Baekdu Mountains" (~70)</a> (most of which are accidental) with <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;client=opera&amp;rls=en&amp;q=%22Baekdudaegan%22+-wikipedia&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;client=opera&amp;rls=en&amp;q=%22Baekdudaegan%22+-wikipedia&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">Baekdudaegan (~570)</a> -- and that's just <i>one</i> romanization.

<p>"our primary consideration should be English usage, not Chinese or Korean usage." The we should use "white headed mountain" if that is what you truly mean. "Changbaishan" is definitely Chinese, it doesn't make sense that you want to move this page.</p>
<p>Like I commented at the <a href="../../../c/h/o/Chonji.html" title="Chonji">Chonji</a> talk page, why do you make it so hard here? Why the hassle? We don't need to move the page. Its perfectly fine the way it is, there are no controversies (save the one you began), and this article does not a have a problem. <a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGood_friend100_562e.html" title="User:Good friend100">Good friend100</a> 01:45, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>No, Good friend100, the Chinese usage would be 长白山. Only one English title for the article is possible, so combining different romanizations and different spellings makes little sense. And pointing out facts is "making it hard"? As I showed, all other encyclopedias (you know, all the <i>professional ones</i>) use Changbai as the name, and Changbai enjoys a clear majority in usage on the web. I suspect that the English-language usage of "Changbai" will only increase, once the <a href="http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/200607/13/eng20060713_282748.html" class="external text" title="http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/200607/13/eng20060713_282748.html" rel="nofollow">upcoming Changbai airport</a> is completed in 2008. So if I advocate this name as well based on consistency, common usage on the net, common usage on other enclopedic sources, then I'm being difficult? Most other encyclopedias use Changbai for the name, and not Baekdu. A short search on Google scholar will reveal that professional research papers favor "Changbai" as well. Are you saying all those other encyclopedias, web pages, and research papers are wrong and you're right?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>From where I'm standing, I see you making emotional appeals but not valid points. Might I ask you why you think we should ignore these facts? As I see it, those encyclopedias aren't controversial, but you're trying to make it so. On the other hand, I do see that some people who do oppose the move based on blatently POV reasons (such as Oyo321's extremely enlightened comments that a page rename will lead the destruction of Korea). If you don't think this discussion will lead to anywhere, I'm perfectly happy with us dealing with this issue through mediation as well. I'm confident that the points I brought up will stand on their own, and that I can make a strong case for it.

<dd>So I'm emotional, eh? And you are offering mediation while blatently rejecting all others? And China's plan to make a Changbai airport and to hold olympic games at Changbai mountain is just to advertise the mountain itself, its not really important in this article. Chonji obviously will not move because "Chonji" is the clearest title for that article. This article does not need to move because there is no point having a Korean lake on top of a Chinese mountain.

<p>Also, you cannot ignore the search results General Tiger has produced. It is also important to point out that "Baekdusan" can be spelled out or named in several different names, considering how a book or internet site spells it. <a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGood_friend100_562e.html" title="User:Good friend100">Good friend100</a> 14:47, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Proof of the last one? Filtering out the term "hotel" from both terms still raise large degree of difference. All the others you raised might be true, but regardless, the conclusion you admitted yourself is exactly that Changbai Mountain is the more common English name, and Baekdu isn't. Changbai is encountered most often by English speakers, English readers, English-speaking tourists, articles, encyclopedias, and so on. There's even other sites named after it, such as the hotel located in the mountains, and the airport located in the mountains, which will make exposure all the more common. All those various websites, encyclopedias, and English-speaking tourists encounter the name "Changbai", but you're recommending that instead, we base the name on something that "can be spelled out in several different names, considering how a book or internet site spells it", which 1)will be rarely encountered, because access isn't possible, 2)tourists will never see, because tourism is very very limited, and 3)we'll never hear a lot about, apart from the nuke problem? And you're the one complaining about confusion and ambiguity? Again, if you think I'm simply being stubborn and my points completely baseless, we can try to resolve this through mediation. Or do you think such a proposal would be unfair to you?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I proposed the move not to "make things hard" for you, but obviously because I think I'm right and you're wrong, and I think I'm able to show it. Don't confuse disagreement with hostility, or all of Wikipedia might be a massive flamefest. Good_friend100, if a simple page rename proposal is drawing such an emotional reaction from you, perhaps you need to take a step back and reconsider whether or not you're really approaching this issue in a NPOV manner. --<a href="../../../y/u/j/User%7EYuje_76b7.html" title="User:Yuje">Yuje</a> 01:03, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

What would he naturally search on Wikipedia? Changbai, of course. Or suppose he sees "Baekdu Mountain" on Wikipedia, and wants to confirm it on another encyclopedia. He goes to Encarta encyclopedia, types in "Baekdu", and gets <a href="http://encarta.msn.com/encnet/refpages/search.aspx?q=Baekdu&amp;Submit2=Go" class="external text" title="http://encarta.msn.com/encnet/refpages/search.aspx?q=Baekdu&amp;Submit2=Go" rel="nofollow">no related hits</a>.

<p>First you should know that Paektusan, Paekdusan, Baekdusan, etc mean all the same thing. The tallest mountain in Korea.</p>
<p>Of course you would get 144,000 hits since "Changbai" can mean almost anything since you left out "shan" (which means mountain, right?). This "tactic" that I use does not apply to Changbaishan because "Changbai" technically does not mean the mountain anymore. Baekdu Mountain simply has several ways to spell it in English. <a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGood_friend100_562e.html" title="User:Good friend100">Good friend100</a> 21:02, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>This page name should be CHANGBAI. right now the Korea nationlism have pose a grave threat to all neighboring countries. This should to sounding alarm to everyone. and has to be watched closed. korean nationlism is troublesome, and potentially very dangerous, more dangerous than Kim the second's nuke.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I doubt it. No matter how much anyone rants and raves, a country needs to physically send an eighteen-year old with a gun to plant his country's flag on a piece of land before it actually owns it. Obviously, they don't actually have the ability to do this to China (biggest army in the world) or Japan (second biggest navy in the world), nor do Japan or China have the ability to invade the other two, either. Politicians may pander to nationalism to gain votes, but once in office they tend to realize very quickly the importance of good relations with neighboring countries.--<a href="../../../y/u/j/User%7EYuje_76b7.html" title="User:Yuje">Yuje</a> 05:45, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Then you can explain why China is so aggresively claiming Goguryeo and Baekdu mountain as their own. I always wonder if the Chinese historians and proffessors who study the ethnicity of Goguryeo ever feel guilty, but there's also another probability that the government forces them to study and claim Goguryeo as their own. You get pretty disgusted when you see a country claiming another country's culture and history.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The reason why I think China is claiming Goguryeo is because the fact the Goguryeo smeared the Chinese into the ground in the endless wars China waged on Goguryeo. It would be great for China to see Goguryeo as their own ethnicity since that would mean Korea never defeated China and the wars were simply between Chinese kingdoms. <a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGood_friend100_562e.html" title="User:Good friend100">Good friend100</a> 21:08, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>So are you saying China doesn't actually physically own its part of the mountain currently? Anyway, I think current relations between the East Asian countries are already pretty good. I can't imagine any of them fighting a war in the future, not even Taiwan and the PRC.</dd>

<dd>I don't ever recall myself saying that the people of Koguryo were Han Chinese. I recall reading a Jared Diamond article saying that the inhabitants of Paekche and Koguryo were the ancestors of the Japanese. Their languages showed closer similarity to ancient Japanese than to ancient Korean, and after their defeat by Shilla, refugees fleeing to Japan developed into the modern Japanese people.</dd>

<dd>And I have have the greatest respect for the general who defeated the Chinese armies. He was a fine general, and I regard him as the East Asian equivalent of Hannibal. Even in ancient China, Chinese generals respected the skills and courage of their enemies. The Tang Dynasty certainly did, and incorporated foreign soldiers from places like Xianbei (<a href="../../../z/h/a/Zhangsun_Wuji_184e.html" title="Zhangsun Wuji">Zhangsun Wuji</a>), Gokturk (<a href="../../../a/n/_/An_Lushan_bce2.html" title="An Lushan">An Lushan</a>), Persia (<a href="../../../p/i/r/Pirooz.html" title="Pirooz">Pirooz</a>), and Koguryo (<a href="../../../g/a/o/Gao_Xianzhi_41b1.html" title="Gao Xianzhi">Gao Xianzhi</a>) into their armies.

<dd>I also don't see why're you're trying to attribute ulterior motives to me based on some actions a nigh-thousand years ago. Various Chinese dynasties have fought countless offensive and defensive wars against states from all four corners of the map, including Vietnamese, Nanchao, Dali, Burma, the Shan states, the Tibetan kingdoms/empires, the Tanguts, Turks, Khitans, Xianbei, Uyghurs, Xiongnu, Miao, Mongols, Manchus, Tartars, etc. Really, you'd be hard pressed to find anyone holding a thousand year old grudge against any of the peoples that they fought in the past, and the Mongols directly and indirectly killed some 1/5 of China's population. --<a href="../../../y/u/j/User%7EYuje_76b7.html" title="User:Yuje">Yuje</a> 00:35, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Its not possible for a war between Taiwan and the PRC? Do you know what Communist countries want? They want a communist spread around the world. The PRC has repeatedly threatened to attack Taiwan by force even though the U.S has passed the <a href="../../../t/a/i/Taiwan_Relations_Act_b21c.html" title="Taiwan Relations Act">Taiwan Relations Act</a> to defend Taiwan's democracy from communism. Communism doesn't work, and in the end, it will bring any country to rubble.</p>
<p>China plays so cheep in the international market and politics. They threaten to cut any ties with a country if that country recognizes Taiwan. Thats what happened to Korea. We had to cut our relations with Taiwan to trade with China and left the Taiwanese ambassadors crying out of the Korean embassy. How sad. I feel sorry for the Taiwanese.</p>
<p>Betcha didn't know Chinese soldiers raped and pillaged Koreans when the came to help the Korean army. <a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGood_friend100_562e.html" title="User:Good friend100">Good friend100</a> 16:41, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Have you seen China attempt to spread any communism any time in the last 30+ years? Care to give an example? Not that I don't believe you, I just want to hear an example. Do you mean when it joined the WTO? Or opened up Special Economic Zones?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Anyway, no one is coercing SK to keep it's relationships with the PRC. SK didn't even start diplomatic relations with them till the 1980's. I'm certainly no communist stooge, so if you would rather trade with Taiwan instead, feel perfectly free to switch relations. The PRC would obviously rather not trade or have ties with any country that does, of course, but that's within their rights as well. Don't think I'm holding you back. Go ahead and give your president a call (today, if possible!), and tell him to end all relations with the mainland and recognize Taiwan instead.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I did in fact know about Chinese soldiers in Korea, and I never attempted to exonerate them. I suppose you'd probably not rather have had their help in Korea. China would have been better off for it, as well. They were fighting three simultaneous uprisings at the time, which was why the emperor delayed in sending help at all. The one in Korea had to come back fresh from fighting a Mongolian invasion, and had to leave right afterwards, to continue dealing with the wars China was already embroiled in. That they chose to send help at all while mired in debt and fighting three simultaneous wars is certainly in dire contrast to the amount of gratitude that they recieved (none). I can say the same about the modern US forces as well. The US forces loss over 30,000 lives defending SK from communist invasion, and have spent money and lives on the front line protecting them for the next several decades ever since, and up to now, the USA has been hated and reviled, and told "Yankee go home!".</dd>

<dd>If you really want to play the oppression olympics, I can up the ante. I suppose you probably didn't know about Korea's WW2 war criminals? Koreans in the Japanese armies served in many POW camps, which had mortality rates as high as <b>37%</b>. Places like the <a href="../../../d/e/a/Death_Railway_4720.html" title="Death Railway">Death Railway</a> were manned by Korean guards. Of the 148 Koreans convicted of war crimes in the Tokyo Trials, the Korean government has cleared 83 of them from crimes.

<p>I don't know if there's polling involved with this RM but, if so, I <b>oppose</b>. This is an example <i>par excellance</i> of the weaknesses of trying to use Google to determine encyclopedic usage. Setting aside for a moment that Baekdu has multiple transliterations (e.g. "Baekdu," "Baekdusan," "Paekdu," "Paekdusan," "Paektu," "Paektusan") that are not given in the above results, Google does not weigh the relative importance of the topic under each name. To an English encyclopedic audience, Baekdu's status as Korea's highest mountain and its role in Korean history and culture give the Korean transliteration greater weight. Redirects and a <b>bold</b> mention of Changbai in the first line can solve any other issues.</p>

<p>Could we move this article to "Baekdusan"? The Wikipedia naming conventions for Korean states that all mountains should have a "san" after the mountain's name. Most other Korean articles on Korean mountains are named using this, and I agree that the article must be moved. <a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGood_friend100_562e.html" title="User:Good friend100">Good friend100</a> 19:51, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Baitoushan is the Chinese pronounciation of the Korean Baekdusan(백두산/白頭山). Why would anyone use the Chinese pronounciation for a Korean mountain?!

<p>Actually, Yuje's links are about the <a href="../../../c/h/a/Changbai_Mountains_ba2d.html" title="Changbai Mountains">Changbai Mountains</a>, the mountain range.

<p>The article on <a href="../../../b/a/l/Balhae.html" title="Balhae">Balhae</a> claims that an eruption of Baekdu Mountain may have precipitated the fall of that empire. The text reads, in part:</p>
<p>"Recent study suggests that the downfall of Balhae is largely due to the catastrophic eruption in the 10th century of Baekdu Mountain located at the center of Balhae territory. Baekdu mountain still has one of the biggest volcanic caldera in the world <a href="../../../c/h/o/Chonji.html" title="Chonji">Chonji</a>."</p>
<p>This article doesn't mention that eruption, or it's supposed consequences, and it attributes the creation of Chonji to a later eruption. It states:</p>
<p>"The crater lake was probably created in 1597, when a recorded eruption took place. Volcanic ash from this eruption has been found as far away as the southern part of Hokkaidō of Japan."</p>

<p>It appears that this page and the <a href="../../../c/h/a/Changbai_Mountains_ba2d.html" title="Changbai Mountains">Changbai Mountains</a> article each link to their own discussion pages for talking about the merge, so this discussion may take place simultaneously in two places. Anyway, I'm copying my opposition comment here:</p>
<p><b>Oppose Merge</b> Mt. Paektu, or Baekdu, or Baekdusan, or whatever you prefer to call it, deserves its own article. The very fact that its naming is controversial, that Chinese and Koreans have interest in claims to the mountain, it's outstanding status as the highest mountain in the chain, its large crater lake, and the fact that its eruption may have precipitated the downfall of the kingdom of Balhae all argue strongly that it must stand as a unique article. <a href="../../../z/a/d/User%7EZadignose_7917.html" title="User:Zadignose">zadignose</a> 13:55, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This is just a strategic move made by apparently CPOV editors, all organized &amp; planned. Look, the Korean for Changbai Mountain is "Jangbaek sanmaek". This isn't even a naming dispute &amp; don't call it one. Gosh, the same old CPOV editors from the Goguryeo dispute.
