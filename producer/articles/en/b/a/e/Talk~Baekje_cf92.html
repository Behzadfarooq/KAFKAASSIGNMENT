<p>There was a small kingdom that was run by people with the surname "Buyeo," which was also the surname of the Baekje Royal family. These Buyeo rulers of Shandong were related to those of Baekje, and when the Shandong Buyeo kingdom was about to fall, they asked Baekje for help. Baekje sent troops to help and occupied the kingdom for a while until they too were pushed out. This was only for a brief period of time. BUT, the fact that Baekje controlled the Shandong peninsula is true from a certain point of view. The Shandong Buyeo rulers gave their land to the Baekje rulers, but, as i mentioned earlier, Baekje lost control soon after. This was probably during the reign of Emperor Kun Chogo. not very sure which Baekje Emperor ruled during this time.--68.211.193.96 00:29, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This demonstrates how Koreans treat history. They have an a priori conclusion. And they pick materials that are favorable for them. If they fail to find sufficient "evidences", they do not hesitate in interpretative distortion. They ignore things that conflict with their argument and they do not care about overall consistency.</p>
<p>This is the case! If you examine historical sources by yourself, you will certainly be surprised at the unsubstantiality of the Korean argument.--<a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENanshu_9373.html" title="User:Nanshu">User:Nanshu</a></p>

<p>These are virtually all about what "Chinese chronicles" say. Curiously <i>Liang Zhigongtu</i>, which is considered the source of the above-mentioned passage of <i>Liangshu</i>, says, "Lelang [NB: not Baekje] was at Jinbing prefecture of Liaoxi too." Maybe they are sufficient ground for those who have something decided from the beginning, but certainly not for sensible people. We need corroborative evidences but there is no such thing.</p>
<p>On the contrary, there are some grounds against this theory. The above-mentioned sources are of Southern Dynasties, which did not control Northern China, and so were unable to contact Liaoxi. If Baekje had controlled Liaoxi, it should have been recorded in Northern Dynasty records. But the Xianbei Murong clan, who actually ruled the land west of the Liao river, left no such description. So the majority of historians do not support this theory.</p>
<p>It may be worth nothing that some scholars search through possible explanations about the historical error. One claims that Baekje deceived Southern Dynasties, who were ignorant about the north, to seek support from them. Based on <i>Liang Zhiqongtu</i>, one argues that Baekje was confused with Lelang. Actually the Murong clan nominally maintained Lelang commandery in its domain after it disappeared from the Korean Peninsula around 313. One thinks that Baekje was confused with the Fuyu because Baekje's royal family was surnamed Fuyu and had some other Fuyu connections. Anyway, none of them has good grounds.</p>
<p>I do not agree that Baekje had any overseas territory, but I disagree with the second to last sentence. The Baekje royal family was connected with Buyeo, even renaming itself "Nambuyeo" meaning South-Buyeo.</p>

<p>I don't know why <a href="../../../v/i/s/User%7EVisviva_a3c2.html" title="User:Visviva">Visvia</a> wrote, "At this time Baekje controlled <b>almost the entire coastline</b> of the <a href="../../../y/e/l/Yellow_Sea_bf5b.html" title="Yellow Sea">West Sea (or Yellow Sea)</a>." Probably he added adverb "almost" and adjective "entire" just because they sounded nice. The Korean theory that Baekje controlled the coastal area of Northern China is based on the following passage from 南齊書 列傳 東南夷:</p>
<dl>
<dd>牟大又表曰：「臣所遣行建威將軍、廣陽太守、兼長史臣高達，行建威將軍、朝鮮太守、兼司馬臣楊茂，行宣威將軍、兼參軍臣會邁等三人，志行清亮，忠款夙著．往泰始中，比使宋朝，今任臣使，冒涉波險，尋其至險，宜在進爵，謹依先例，各假行職．且玄澤靈休，萬里所企，況親趾天庭，乃不蒙賴．伏願天監特愍除正．達邊?夙著，勤勞公務，今假行龍驤將軍、帶方太守．茂志行清壹，公務不廢，今假行建威將軍、廣陵太守．邁執志周密，屢致勤?，今假行廣武將軍、清河太守．」</dd>
</dl>
<p>This is the request of 490 from the king of Baekje to Emperor Wu of the Southern Qi. The king asked the emperor to bestow titles on his vassals. The request and the result are summarized as follows:</p>
<table>
<tr>
<th>officials with requested titles</th>
<th>given titles</th>

<tr>
<td>行建威將軍・廣陽太守 長史 高達</td>
<td>行龍驤將軍・帶方太守</td>

<p>Let's examine the above-mentioned place names first. Guangyang had been a commandery located at modern-day Daxing Country, Hebei. Taifang had been a commandery located in midwestern Korea. There were and had been no such thing as governor of Choaxian as Chaoxian had been a prefecture of Lelang commandery. Guangling was Jiangdu, Jiangsu, or Wenan, Hebei. Qinghe was a commandery located around Wanbing, Hebei.</p>
<p>So we get into the main question. Weren't these titles nominal? Certainly yes. They were given by a Southern Dynasty (again!). It couldn't rule or influence the area in question.</p>
<p>You are hopeless idiots if you believe Chinese were all substantial. For example, the Kingdom of Bohai was named after Bohai commandery because Bohai kings were given the title of the ruler of Bohai commandery by Tang Emperors. But where had Bohai commandery been? It had been located in Hebei, which the kingdom never dominated. Another example is King Bu of Wa. In 478 he was given by the Liang the following title 都督 倭 新羅 任那 加羅 秦韓 慕韓六國諸軍事 安東大將軍. Do supporters of the coastal area theory accept Japan's control over these regions on the same basis?</p>
<dl>
<dd>I agree wholeheartedly with the above statement. Chinese dyansties were quite accustomed to granting Korean monarchs ceremonial titles to reward them for their loyalty/convince them to continue to be loyal. These titles, though "real" and also held by Chinese, were completely symbolic and ceremonial as far as the Korean monarchs. The examples from Goguryeo and Silla as well are too numerous to cite but they included naming them "Commander-in-chief" of elite guard units charged with protecting the imperial capital, "Supreme Pillar of State" etc. Tellingly, the Korean monarchs were at the same time usually "granted" the title of King of Goguryeo, King of Silla, etc. by the Chinese emperor at the beginning of their reign. Would this indicate that China controlled Korea and that the Korean king was a mere puppet? Not at all. It was a symbiotic relationship that I don't think we should attempt to judge merely from modern Western standards of colonizer/colonized. More substantial evidence is required than the possession of titles. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStraitgate_f6d8.html" title="User:Straitgate">Straitgate</a></dd>

<p>The Korean theory that Baekje ruled Shandong is based on the title (yet again!) 都督東青州諸軍事・東青州刺史 , which was given to the king of Baekje by the Northern Qi in 571. In this case, the title giver was not a Southern Dynasty but actually controlled Shandong. But where was 東青州 in the first place? In 468 the Song Dynasty separated Dongqingzhou from Qingzhou (modern-day Shandong), but we cannot confirm that the Northern Qi had a political entity named Dongqingzhou. So it is also plausible that it was Baekje itself that was referred to as Dongqingzhou because Baekje was located to the east of Shandong! So the supporter of that theory have to prove not only the substantiality of this title but also the existence of the political entity, but they don't. --<a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENanshu_9373.html" title="User:Nanshu">Nanshu</a> 14:55, 23 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>You treat Koreans as though they all believed that Baekje ruled the western coast of China. Most Korean historian <b>do not agree</b> with the theory that Baekje at any time had control of any western part of China, and see it only as a "legend" or "heresay."</p>
<p>Thank you, Nanshu, for your (yet again) insulting and obsolete analysis of Korean history. Unless you have eyes that work properly, you should notice the fact that modern Korean historical documents merely cite the Shandong Peninsula as an area under Baekje influence, not under Baekje control. There's a subtle difference, unless you haven't noticed by now.</p>
<p>On added note, I would take this oppurtunity to ask you a simple question. When will you stop insulting the intelligence of Koreans and look back on your own country's deceit? I (along with most of East Asia) see Japan as nothing more than a rude, uncouth, insolent, arrogent, pompous snotrag of a country that holds a prominent face in front of the international community while fabricating so-called evidence to support their proposterously outrageous claims to foreign territory and history. Not only that, your country has attempted to glorify its past by inventing cock-and-bull tales of Amaterasu, ignoring Korean aid in the development of Japanese culture, and exalting its imperialist ambitions of 1910, which date back to 1592. And that, Nanshu, is much, much more than the pittance of distortion Korean historians have committed. --<a href="../../../l/e/o/User%7ELeonhart_1a99.html" title="User:Leonhart">Leonhart</a></p>

</dl>
<p>Actually, we cannot substantiate "the close bonds between the two nations" with Takano no Niigasa. Koreans' incredible ignorance caused a fuss about His Majesty's statement.</p>
<p>I burst out laughing when I read George Wehrfritz and Hideko Takayama's article at Newsweek that started with:</p>
<dl>
<dd>She was a daughter of Korea's Paekche kingdom, a foreign princess betrothed in a political marriage to a Japanese prince. ...</dd>
</dl>
<p>Terribly enough, it looks like this is their average perception. They didn't even know that Baekje was overthrown about 70 years before she became a concubine of Prince Shirakabe.</p>
<p>To make things straight, I have to talk about Takano no Niigasa. In short, she was a Cinderella, who achieved success by good fortune, not with "noble origin". She became a concubine of Prince Shirakabe around 730s and gave birth to Prince Yamabe (Emperor Kammu) in 737. At that time his husband Prince Shirakabe had almost no chance to assume the throne because he was a grandson of Emperor Tenji and was deprived of hegemony by Emperor Temmu's descendants. As of 737 he only had the rank of 従四位下. What was worse for her was that he got married with Princess Inoe, the daughter of Emperor Shomu, around 747. When Empress Shotoku died in 769, Prince Shirakabe was installed as Emperor Konin by the northern branch of the Fujiwara clan. But it was, of course, Prince Inoe who became Empress, and her son Prince Osabe became Crown Prince. At that time Takano no Niigata's son was almost impossible to succeed the throne. But it brought her luck again. Empress Inoe and Crown Prince Osabe was entrapped into deposition by another Fujiwara branch in 772. Then Prince Yamabe became Crown Prince in the next year, but his mother wasn't given the title of empress because of her humble origin. It was after Prince Yamabe's succession (as Emperor Kammu) that she was given imperial titles.</p>
<p>Now we learn that she was far from a "princess" at marriage. Next, let's examine her clan. She was from the Yamato clan (the surname Takano was given during Emperor Konin's reign). According to <i>Shoku Nihongi</i>, her clan originated in Prince Junda, the son of King Muryeong. The Meiji-era genealogist Suzuki Matoshi 鈴木真年 offered the following genealogy of the Yamato clan.</p>

<p>Its accuracy is questionable, but that doesn't really matter here. You need only be aware of the wide gap in time between King Muryeong and Takano no Niigasa. According to <i>Nihonshoki</i>, Prince Junda died (in Japan) in 513. It was more than 200 years before Takano no Niigasa was born, and she was the ninth generation resident of Japan. How can you demonstrate "the close bonds between the two nations" with her?</p>
<p>Lastly, we discuss the Emperor's statement. The Emperor did not "acknowledge" but just referred to <i>Shoku Nihongi</i>. Koreans treat it as if it had been hidden. The fact is that Koreans are hopelessly ignorant. Everyone can access to <i>Shoku Nihongi</i> and almost everyone who has basic knowledge on Japanese history knows that.</p>
<p>Curiously, the Emperor has made similar "kinship" references. When referring to Okinawa, the Emperor mentioned that the Emperor's grandmother was from the Shimazu clan, who had controlled Okinawa. <a href="http://www.kunaicho.go.jp/kisyakaiken/kisyakaiken-h15-01.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.kunaicho.go.jp/kisyakaiken/kisyakaiken-h15-01.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> The imperial family has a history long enough for its members to feel kinship with the people whenever necessary. --<a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENanshu_9373.html" title="User:Nanshu">Nanshu</a> 14:12, 24 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>So what? Your reference to Japanese records only bolsters the Korean claim that Akihito is descended from King Muryeong. It doesn't matter how distantly Emperor Kammu's wife was related to Muryeong; if she was of his bloodline, that's it. Period. You don't need to make a big fuss about this whole affair and label Koreans as "IGNORANT" for the sake of your extremely derogatory hatred of all of Koreans. Furthermore, making statements such as "Koreans' incredible ignorance caused a fuss about His Majesty's statement."/"In short, she was a Cinderella, who achieved success by good fortune, not with 'noble origin'."/"How can you demonstrate "the close bonds between the two nations" with her?"/"Koreans treat it as if it had been hidden. The fact is that Koreans are hopelessly ignorant"/"The imperial family has a history long enough for its members to feel kinship with the people whenever necessary." only attempt to keep all Korean blood out of the Japanese imperial line, when in fact nothing can be done about it.--<a href="../../../l/e/o/User%7ELeonhart_1a99.html" title="User:Leonhart">Leonhart</a></p>
<p>I believe that Nanshu is an extreme Japanese-Nationalist trying to make himself look like a ethnic Han Chinese with the username "Nanshu" and using Chinese characters to prove his point. As for his Wiki contributions, which can be obtained through <a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENanshu_9373.html" title="User:Nanshu">Nanshu</a> page, they are anti-Korean and anti-Chinese; that is, nothing pro-Chinese, like he supposedly is. This is also evident in his knowledge of Japanese and misinterpretation of Classical Chinese. --Bezant</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br />
Dear Nanshu. Well, then why on earth Japanese press(except Asahi) did not care to deal with the empreror's remark? If the "close kinship" is nothing so special and that it is of no danger to the "divinity" of Japanese Imperial Family then why hide the remark? and not make it a "nation-wide" fact? You say "everyone" is accessible to "nihonki" or whatsoever, but that you're terribly mistaken. Only those who are maniacs of history ever care about the "holy book" and the majority of both Japanese and Korean population does not know what Nihonki says. They simply get their historical information from press, text books and some stupid TV sagas, and I believe that it had been the very first time for both Japanese and Korean folks to ever learn about the "Kanmu's Korean lineage". And THIS DOES ANNOY SOME JAPANESE. (Apparently, for you, it doesn't&#160;:)</p>
<p>Please don't ever measure the public from you viewpoint. They are not historians. They simply believe what SANNKEI OR ASAHI says. And if the Emperor's statement was not broadcasted or printed, then there is no way Japanese public could find out about Kanmu Emperor's Korean blood.</p>
<p>Why, you seem so confident about Emperor's remark. And does it mean that you're not Japanese? lol I know you are. -anonymous</p>
<p>As Nanshu points out, Takano no Niigasa was Japanese minor nobility with the Baekje royal origin. She was not really qualified as “Baekje nobility and royalty”. If the “degree of intermarriage” is limited to the Niigasa”s case, “Many members of the Baekje nobility and royalty married into the Japanese imperial line” is a gross overstatement.<a href="../../../d/w/y/User%7EDwy_46ea.html" title="User:Dwy">Dwy</a> 17:19, 27 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Paekche: Means " Kingdom of 100 followers". The Japanese word Kudara means same as Korean meaning.</p>
<p>I always thought that the term was very friendly. Baek means 100 and Che means Economics, so I thought that it was all about a person who got a 100 in economics, or in other words, someone who didn't dominate the conversation. Getting a 100 in economics is like being Jimbo Wales or Bill Gates or Conan O'Brien and finding oneself in the center of a very big burgeoning development, as its manager or guiding light, as it just keeps getting better and better.</p>
<p>Baekche has always been my favorite of the 3 big dynasties. Silla always seemed so arbitrary and good, like The Late Show on CBS or Spy Magazine, and Choson is a very nice name, like good produce or good restaurant food, but getting a 100 in economics is what appeals to me most of the three. These values are the strength and content of these big geo entities. Cymaerg, Deutscheland and Xhosa are big names that capture the best of a huge group of people. As I really know the Hanja values involved here I believe the article should be written for those who don't.

<p>wikipeditor, where did you get the info about languages? i could find very little through google, but what i saw (including the fuyu language article) seemed to indicate very very little is known about the languages of this time. the best i could figure was possible connection of gojoseon-&gt;fuyu-&gt;goguryeo-&gt;baekje-&gt;early japanese. others indicate a goguryeo-&gt;silla connection. `www.wam.umd.edu/~kozawa/J_roots.doc says "The Proto-Han-Silla language is considered a dialect of Proto-Puyeo-Kogruyeo-Paekche." do you have a source for the 2 language statement? Appleby 05:28, 12 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I wasn't able to find anything through Google, either. All my changes are based on what my professor said, or rather what I remember from it. I hope this backing gives them a bit higher authoritative value than the average Google results. FWIW, he has a linguistical background and long experience in Korean Studies; his main areas of interest and research seem to be Volkskunde (Cultural anthropology?), history and Middle Korean and Hanmun literature and lingustics.</p>
<dl>
<dd>P.S. I gather he was also president of <a href="http://www.akse.uni-kiel.de/" class="external text" title="http://www.akse.uni-kiel.de/" rel="nofollow">AKSE</a> for four years.</dd>
</dl>
<p>About Baekje's 2 languages: An old Chinese report about Baekje (I'll ask him which one was next time) plainly states that Baekje has two languages. This fits in with the traditional history of the two Baekjes' foundation by nobles from Goguryeo, with Baekje's capital "부여", and with ethnologic and linguistic (and archaeologic?) hints at early migrations from both across the southern seas and from Manchuria into Korea.</p>
<p>About Southern migration(s?) to Korea by boat: All I have heard is that pig breeding traditions of the Namhae area (I think it was Jeju) are similar to Oceania pig breeding; I hope there is other evidence than just this. I have also read parts of an academic paper investigating the linguistic position of a 東夷 ethnic group (Jiangsu or Shandong area?). If I recall correctly, the paper claimed that the group likely spoke an Austronesian language. With this, it might not be too far-fetched to say that similar groups migrated to the Korean peninsular south, too. What I'd like to know more about is whether these assumed immigrants are believed to have formed the Samhan, or whether speakers of a hypothetical Han (韓) dialect who were already in Korea merely received cultural input from those Southern migrants.</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Update: it's said to be the latter. The Han language(s) come from the north just like Fuyu (with Han representing an earlier migration wave, perhaps?) and were but culturally affected by peoples from the south.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>About Northern migrations from Manchuria to Korea: Speakers of languages belonging to a [hypothetical?] <a href="../../../f/u/y/Fuyu_languages.html" title="Fuyu languages">Fuyu languages</a> subgroup of the disputed (extended) Altaic group moved onto the peninsula in several waves, each of which can be identified by its own ceramics style. The peoples of Northern and Southern migrations met and mixed.</p>
<p>My professor seems to regard</p>
<ol>
<li>Goguryeo as a state representative of the northern group of speakers of a language of the Fuyu group – if you accept the 2 (Fuyu and Han) main groups hypothesis, this makes sense especially before Goguryeo's ambitions in the South,</li>
<li>Silla as a purely Han state with the Fuyu group playing no role in its formation, and</li>
<li>Baekje as the mixed state of Fuyu people ruling over Han peons described above.</li>
</ol>
<p>At the stage of Old Korean, Korea was probably still linguistically divided, with a Han/Southern language being comparatively well documented in Silla's 鄕歌, and the northern (Fuyu-based) group basically not documented anywhere, with research restricted to analysing placenames and such – e.g. Southern 室 sil vs. Northern 谷 [g]ul, [g]ol[u], I'm not sure what <a href="http://www.yongin21.co.kr/news/read.php?idxno=10585" class="external text" title="http://www.yongin21.co.kr/news/read.php?idxno=10585" rel="nofollow">this</a> makes of it.</p>
<p>As I understand it, the term "Old Korean" is only about Silla language because not enough is known about the Northern language(s), and I gather we can only speculate about whether the Japanese language is a relative of the Goguryeo/Kudara language (see J.&#160;Diamond of UCLA).</p>
<p>Even though I have not found convincing what "evidence" I've personally seen placing Korean into the Altaic group, or even together with Japanese ("섬 = shima"), I am willing to believe those with sounder background than me, the undergraduate student.</p>
<p>Let me repeat that the above is basically just what stuck with me from my professor's lectures, and what sense I tried to make out of it. I hope I have not given an overly distorted account of what he taught, and I am fully aware that it may not sound much different from all the wild hypotheses presented as facts out there on the 'net; but while I doubt that my professor would directly contribute to the article with his findings, I trust that he has the experience and clues that would be needed to back his statements up if necessary.</p>
<p>It would be nice if anybody came forward with more clues either confuting or supporting the hypothesis. I am not particularly leaning to either side.<br />
On another note, even if Proto-Fuyu and Proto-Han were not separate language groups but dialects of one group, they still must have been different enough from each other to be considered two languages by the Chinese visitor to Baekje. –&#160;<a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipeditor_a998.html" title="User:Wikipeditor">Wikipeditor</a> 21:38, 12 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>guick googling seems to show that your professor's views are held by at least one published scholar, but because of the scarcity of actual evidence of the languages of the time, it seems like a hypothesis that many other western scholars disagree with, or at least consider too speculative to conclude.</p>
<p>&amp; as to chinese considering baekje &amp; other languages as diff't, which record are you referring to? it seems there are a few contradictory chinese records. 梁書 says Baekche language is almost identical to that of Goguryeo.</p>
<p>btw, i hope i don't sound combative, thanks to your pointers, i've learned a lot more about this topic. but i still think the 2 language hypothesis is not part of the consensus, &amp; if included, should be labeled as a controversial/minority hypothesis.Appleby 04:34, 13 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>I don't think I said that Baekje's language is different from Goguryeo's. I merely meant to say that Baekje itself had two languages. I asked again and was told that this statement can be found in the Tangshu/唐書/당서; unfortunately I don't know any details, so it might take a long time to find it there. I also made a note that says "정신문화연구원", but I don't remember what it meant – perhaps it was the 정신문화연구원 who published a 3-volume edition of the Tangshu?</dd>

<p><b>The following statement can be possible based to the historical records.</b></p>
<dl>
<dd>There appears in the Samguk-sagi, a record of the King Mi-cheon of Koguryeo (309-331), in alliance with two Xianbei tribes, attacking another Xianbei tribe led by Murong Hui (?-333) in 319. The records of Jin-shu on Murong Huang, the son of Hui who called himself the king of Yan in 337 and founded the Former Yan in 349, include a statement that the allied forces of Koguryeo, “Paekche” and a Xianbei tribe took a military action.(1)</dd>
<dd>According to the Song-shu, “Koguryeo came to conquer and occupy Liao-dong, and Paekche came to occupy Liao-xi; the place that came to be governed by Paekche was called the Jin-ping district, Jin-ping province.”(2) According to the Liang-shu, “during the time of Jin Dynasty (317-420), Koguryeo conquered Liao-dong, and Paekche also occupied Liao-xi and Jin-ping, and established the Paekche provinces.”(3)</dd>
<dd>The Zi-zhi Tong-jian, compiled by Si-ma Guang (1019-1086) of the Song Dynasty (960-1279), states that in 346 Paekche invaded Puyeo that was located at Lushan, and as a result the people of the country were scattered westward in defeat toward Yan. Then, however, the King Murong Huang of Yan dispatched the Crown Prince with three generals (all with Murong names) and 17,000 cavalrymen to attack the defenseless Puyeo.(4) AD 346 was the first year of the King Keun Chogo’s reign (346-375) in Paekche.</dd>

<dd>I think you need to back off your comments Endroit. Isolating Hairwizard with the picture is unacceptable. The map itself was created by a Korean professor.

<dd>I am sorry but I could not understand exactly what you are going to say. Do you mean the books I have mentioned do not deal with history seriously?? I dont think so. Wangjo silok is just title of the book. The last two books that I have menetioned are for common people, and the first one is for expertise. But, they all explain the Baekje in Liaoing and Liaodong. The first book that I mention is written more scientifically, I think...

<dd>I'm afraid I am guilty of "judging a book by its cover" in this case, since I don't have the actual books at hand (I will try to find copies of them shortly). I would assume that a book titled Baekje Wangjo Sillok would resemble the better-known work titled <i>Goryeo Wangjo Sillok</i> -- that is, a speculative reconstruction of history rather than a serious work of scholarship. Also, I find that in both Korea and the West, sober works of scholarship are almost never titled with strong declarative sentences. I would never cite <i><a href="../../../e/r/i/Eric_Lerner_6ec2.html" title="Eric Lerner">The Big Bang Never Happened</a></i> as a source on astrophysics, I would never cite <i><a href="../../../%ED%83%9C/%EB%B0%B1/%EC%82%B0/%ED%83%9C%EB%B0%B1%EC%82%B0%EB%A7%A5.html" title="태백산맥">태백산맥</a><a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%EC%9D%80" class="extiw" title="wikt:은">은</a> <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%EC%97%86%EB%8B%A4" class="extiw" title="wikt:없다">없다</a></i> as a source on Korean geography, and I very much doubt whether a book titled <i>고구려 신라 백제가 중국 대륙을 지배했다</i> should be cited here. -- <a href="../../../v/i/s/User%7EVisviva_a3c2.html" title="User:Visviva">Visviva</a> 14:26, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

<p>'Baekje's presence on the continent' needs to be contextualized just a little bit more so that the general public are not confused. As <a href="../../../v/i/s/User%7EVisviva_a3c2.html" title="User:Visviva">Visviva</a> deftly shows in the above exchange, the idea that Baekje had a presence in the places mentioned above is a fringe argument that is far removed from mainstream academia in Korea, Japan, China, and elsewhere. There are few adherents to this argument. I propose that this argument is being advanced as a personal crusade based on a twisted sense of primieval nationalism or tribalism. The editor who constructed the subsection is well-meaning, but the section needs a little more work. The very first sentence of the section on Overseas Baekje sets a good tone (e.g. word such as 'controversial'), and I encourage other editors to continue and try and massage our <a href="../../../h/a/i/User%7EHairwizard91_1839.html" title="User:Hairwizard91">Hairwizard91</a>'s contribution along those lines in a collegial manner.

<p>The founding and origin of Baekje is not consistent.<br /></p>
<ul>
<li>In the introduction, it is explained that " It began as a chiefdom in the Mahan confederacy during the Samhan period."<br /></li>
<li>However, in the section of founding it is explained that "Baekje was founded in 18 BC by King Onjo, who led a group of people from Goguryeo to the Han River region of Korea, near present-day Seoul."</li>
</ul>
<p>As everybody knows, Mahan is conquered by King Jun from the Gija Joseon when he fled again Wiman at 195BCE. But, the founding years of Baekje is 18BCE. The central area of Mahan is <a href="../../../j/e/o/Jeolla.html" title="Jeolla">Jeolla</a>, and the first capital city of Baekje is current <a href="../../../s/e/o/Seoul.html" title="Seoul">Seoul</a> by the son of <a href="../../../j/u/m/Jumong.html" title="Jumong">Jumong</a> even someone insists that the first capital city of Baekje started from Liaodong.</p>

<p>According to Jonathan W. Best ("Tales of Three Paekche Monks who Traveled Afar in Search of the Law," Harvard J. of Asiatic Studies 51(1): 13-9197; 1991), Chinese records indicate that "the royal stae of Paeckshe" likely "did not come into existence until the fourth centry" (p. 139).
