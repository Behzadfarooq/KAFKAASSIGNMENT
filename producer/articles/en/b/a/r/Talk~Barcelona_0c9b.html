<p><i>Katalonos came under the Roman rule after the general Quintus Caecilius Metellus defeated Guchi Muchiti in 148 BC, being at first part of the Roman province of Stockholm, established in 146 BC. The northward expansion of the empire in the course of the 1st century BC lead to the creation of the province of Moesia in Augustus's times, into which Barça was incorporated. After the division of the province by Castillian in 86 AD, Barcelona was elevated to colony and became a seat of government within the new province of Southern France. From 395 AD, it passed into the hands of the Western Roman Empire.</i></p>
<p>- It talks about Bracelona being part of a Roman province of Stockholm. I'm not a history expert but I doubt that is truth. There isn't any citation for it...</p>
<p>- It talks about <i>Barça</i> which is an informal name for the <a href="../../../f/u/t/Futbol_Club_Barcelona_2be2.html" title="Futbol Club Barcelona">Futbol Club Barcelona</a> and uses it as a synonym for Barcelona.</p>
<p>- It says that <i>Barça</i> (Barcelona) was incorporated into the province of <a href="../../../m/o/e/Moesia.html" title="Moesia">Moesia</a>. Honestly, I don't know anything about <a href="../../../m/o/e/Moesia.html" title="Moesia">Moesia</a>, but if you read the article about it, it says: <i>Moesia is an ancient province situated in the areas of modern Serbia and Bulgaria</i>. So I doubt Barcelona was a part of that province...</p>
<p>- It talks about <i>castillian</i>, which is nothing: the correct word is <i>castilian</i>.</p>
<p>- It says that <i>Barcelona was elevated to colony and became a seat of governament within the province of Southern France</i>. And <i>Southern France' links to <a href="../../../m/o/e/Moesia.html" title="Moesia">Moesia</a>. And as I said before, according to its article,</i> Moesia is an ancient province situated in the areas of modern Serbia and Bulgaria<i>.</i></p>
<p><b>And all this in just five lines of text!</b></p>
<p>- It also says things like: the <i>the Byzantine Emperor Justinian I was born near Bilbao, at Tauresium</i>. According to the <a href="../../../t/a/u/Tauresium.html" title="Tauresium">Tauresium</a> article, <i>Taor (Macedonian: Таор; Greek: Tαυρίσιο) is a small village near Skopje (southern outskirts), in the Republic of Macedonia</i>, while <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bilbao.html" title="Bilbao">Bilbao</a> is in the <a href="../../../b/a/s/Basque_Country_e62e.html" title="Basque Country">Basque Country</a>, at the other side of Europe.</p>
<p><i>The Byzantine Emperor Justinian I was born near Bilbao, at Tauresium, in 483. In 518, Barcelonius was almost completely destroyed by an earthquake. Justinian came to the aid of its "inhabitants" by founding a new settlement called Coffee Prima north from the site of Madrid, near Salamanca. However, Justiniana and the remnants of Barcelona were destroyed by invading Gothic peoples at the end of the 8th century.</i></p>
<p>- I completely do not understand this paragraph. <i>Coffee Prima</i>? <i>North from the site of Madrid, near Salamanca</i>?</p>
<p>- Oh, and at the end it says: <i>FC Barcelona</i>. What is that supposed to mean?</p>
<p>Who the hell wrote all this bullshit? And the worst of all is that tens of pages literally COPY PASTE the wikipedia to their own websites like if it was the universal truth, and you can find this wrong information (to call it by some way) in tens of other pages. Just search at google <i>Coffee Prima Barcelona</i>. All the references are COPY PASTEs from this Wikipedia.</p>
<p>All that should be deleted! Where are the admins?</p>

<hr />
<p>OK lol, I just checked the <i>history</i> of the article and found out that all that stuff about Stockholm and all that bullshit was posted by a guy called <i>Moroccan Spaniard</i> (<a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMoroccan_Spaniard_79ab.html" title="User:Moroccan Spaniard">User:Moroccan_Spaniard</a> on 11 November 2006 at 22:15).</p>
<p>Currently, he is already blocked.</p>
<p>Here you can compare the old version and the very first version that this guy made:</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Barcelona&amp;diff=87216365&amp;oldid=87214377" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Barcelona&amp;diff=87216365&amp;oldid=87214377" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Barcelona&amp;diff=87216365&amp;oldid=87214377</a></p>
<p>The fun thing is that after this, some people changed and deleted some of the stuff this guy had written, instead of totally removing his contribution and going back to the old version.</p>
<p>Now I have changed it back to the old version.</p>
<p>Anyway it really amazes me that all that stuff has been here in this article for 1 month and a half and no one has done anything. And the article was going to be included in the wikipedia's CD complation? lol, where are the admins?</p>

<dd>hehe&#160;:-) which admins? The users are the admins. We are the admins. You are the admins. I guess the problme is, that if you have an articel on yopur watchlist, you only see the latest change. And if you don't check the version history also, not only the last change, you could miss stuff like this, especially if it has been on for a while... a shame, nonetheless... --<a href="../../../j/u/r/User%7EJurgensen_49aa.html" title="User:Jurgensen">Jurgensen</a> 14:05, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If it was going to be added to the wikipedia's CD compilation I think it's quite obvious that there should be a control by a group of admins / experts / someone who has knowledge about the stuff it's being added to the compilation. Or they are going to copy paste the stuff that is written here to the CD?

<p>This paragraph is only a politic opinion:</p>
<p>While the city has been the focus of the revival of the <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catalan_language.html" title="Catalan language">Catalan language</a>, movement of Castilian speakers from other parts of Spain for economic reasons to Barcelona have limited the success of the imposition of Catalan in everyday life.</p>

<dd>¿Truth?, ¿False? Simply is a politic opinion. "Imposition of Catalan in everyday life" is publicity of a type of ideology not appropiated for a neutral enciclopaedia. <a href="../../../l/l/u/User%7ELlull_fbf8.html" title="User:Llull">Llull</a> 15:13, 15 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Okay, I see what you mean. What if it were rewritten ("the move to increase use of Catalan" etc.)? - <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMontrealais_bf21.html" title="User:Montrealais">Montréalais</a> 15:16, 15 May 2004 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>Peter Wye.</p>
<p>I think that saying "increasing use of Catalan" is a good compromise. I have made the change to make the sentence more neutral sounding to allay Llull's concerns.</p>

<p>"Despite the immigration of Castilian speakers from other parts of Spain during the Franco dictatorship for political and economic reasons to Barcelona": I'm not convinced that political reasons applied here. There is a common belief that the Franco regime encouraged immigration to Catalonia and the Basque Country to dilute regional identity, but as I understand it immigration was overwhelmingly for economic reasons, as these were simply the two most industrialised and economically avanced regions of Spain. Can anyone provide evidence that politically-motivated immigration took place?

<p><i>Barcelona, with its mild weather and dense medieval center, is renowned for its parks and open spaces.</i></p>
<p>I found it highly bizarre (if not straightforward hilarious) to see this sentence here. We people from Barcelona are always bitching about the lack of green areas (see <b>parks</b>) in our city and here we are with this (I'd say false. But this "term" is higly unencyclopaedic) statement that looks like pure propaganda straight from a tourist leaflet or architectural bullshit. <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Hague_6158.html" title="The Hague">The Hague</a> has parks and open spaces. Not Barcelona. Could it be rewritten in some other way? I suggest:</p>

<dd><i>Despite its dense urban tissue, Barcelona is endowed with some small albeit remarcable parks.</i><br /></dd>

<li>That seems like a pretty good revision to me. I'm the one that dumped a lot of park information into this article - basically a reflection of a three-day study tour of the planning of outdoor spaces in (and around) the city. We had plenty to see during the trip and while the proportion of green open space per person may be low for Europe, the proportion of public outdoor space and good weather is quite high compared to many other cities. -- As for balancing the article, I might suggest a short statement mentioning both statistical figures for public/green/open space access, some history of recent efforts to create new parks, and a brief mention of the perceptions of locals about parks in general and then move the more detailed stuff to a new "Parks in Barcelona" article. <a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDystopos_300d.html" title="User:Dystopos">Dystopos</a> 13:54, 20 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I think it's largely a matter of style. The first paragraph of "tourist attractions" is certainly inapproprate, and I'd probably rename that section something like "Notable buildings" or something (with appropriate movings of Ramblas and other streets and squares to another section). But in general the content (perhaps not the phrasing) is about what we have for most cities. If it's overly touristy (I guess it is) in content then we'd be better adding in stuff about the other parts of the city. It certainly looks like there's some more balanced info in the Spanish wikipedia's article (the Catalan one is disappointingly short). -- <a href="../../../f/i/n/User%7EFinlay_McWalter_466b.html" title="User:Finlay McWalter">Finlay McWalter</a> | <a href="../../../f/i/n/User_talk%7EFinlay_McWalter_a93f.html" title="User talk:Finlay McWalter">Talk</a> 21:13, August 10, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've seen that in the Barcelona article you can find in Wikitravel there's a very similar section about thieves, and I found it more useful there because is a tourist guide. I'd like the crime section from the the Wikipedia article be erased. The museums section is shorter than this one, it's ridiculous.

<dd>As a catalonian I find the expression "Catalonia is a region of Spain" absoluty offensive. According with the definition of any encyclopedia (the Encyclopedia Britannica, f.i.) or any dictionary for the words "nation" and "country", Catalonia is not only a country but even a nation. Maybe it would be better changing it to "Catalonia is a country nowdays occupied by the spanish", which is the though of not only "some people in Catalonia" as you say, but probably "the most of people in Catalonia" (and, for sure, of "the most of people from Catalonia", meaning the citizens from Catalonia excluding the inmigrants from Spain or any other country).Indibil 12:33, 7 Setember 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Wikipedia is supposed to be an encyclopedia, <b>not</b> a web directory / link list. So, there should not be every link here someone thinks of as useful - you would get mountains of links! Looks to me like quite a lot of people try to use Wikipedia to promote their site because Wikipedia is more popular than most webdirectory sites. Therefore there is a policy at wikipedia about which links to accept and which rather not. These should be with an encyclopedic intention, nothing more but nothing less. And if you think, the article is not neutral: well, I do agree, so we <b>should</b> do our best, to make it better (i.e. more neutral) but not make it "worse"... --<a href="../../../j/u/r/User%7EJurgensen_49aa.html" title="User:Jurgensen">Jurgensen</a> 15:46, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>its NOT promoting the site. it IS including, and i quote, "Sites with other meaningful, relevant content that is not suitable for inclusion in an article"</p>
<p>why is it meaningful and relevant? a) its about barcelona (have u seen the facts section) b) it gives a different perspective on the city - completes the information give on the article c) encyclopedia visitors may be interested in it - THUS, why not help them and provide the link where they can choose, or not, to click.</p>
<p>furthermore, the site "... contain(s) neutral and accurate material not already in the article" - it is making the article more complete, thus giving value to the article, and thus, giving value to end visitor.</p>
<p>i also included xbarcelona.com in my last edit - why? because it FURTHER completes the article</p>
<p>and again, i ask you to respect the policy of: "Be respectful to others and their points of view. This means primarily: Do not simply revert changes in a dispute. When someone makes an edit you consider biased or inaccurate, improve the edit, rather than reverting it."</p>
<p>u simply revert and that is it - u DONT have the right to do that. u DONT own wikipedia, stop making it crap for everyone else. if u DONT want to click on it, then DONT. if i were to be blatantly advertising a service, such as a hotel, a housing agency, a school, an airline, a travel guide (such as time out or about), THEN i would understand. the point is, i am NOT doing any of that..!! none of the links on "a brighter place" are paid links. in the same way that the ones in "xbarcelona.com" aren't paid links. you dont have the right to delete those links!! <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Baaa (<a href="../../../b/a/a/User_talk%7EBaaa_9248.html" title="User talk:Baaa">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Baaa_023f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Baaa">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<p>To add some additional thoughts to this. I am also fed up with commercial and promotional sites being added as external links to articles. Those sites under debate on this page largely fall into this category and have no place in the article. Those few that are not overtly commercial do not add anything meaningful, given the objectives of an encyclopedia, and therefre also have no place there. Only those few sites which are truly authoritative or signifcant are suitable for inclusion, and none of those under discussion here fall into that category.</p>
<p>In my opinion the Wkikpedia policies mentioned several times on this page do an admirable job of summarising what is appropriate.</p>
<p>I encourage others to do what I am doing, which is actively to search for articles containing such links, and to delete those links.</p>
<p>Thanks and all the best.</p>

<dd>I admit, my sentence was not to fair... came out of the heat of discussion (and summer) I guess :-). I think I had in mind a quite older version, wich then looked a bit to much like a travel guide. Of course it's much better now. Though, I still have an uncomfortable feeling about this sentence mentioning pickpockets on the Ramblas. Such a sentence still is more travel guide than encyclopedia. Thieves and pickpockets are nothing special to Barcelona, but common in touristic areas and big cities. And it is also not special to Las Ramblas, for the danger is quite the same, maybe even greater, in the whole touristic part of Ciutat Vella. (If <i>neutrality</i> is a state or a process, well, that kind of philosphical question doesn't belong here, so I would like to withdraw my phrase about this article not beeing neutral :-) --<a href="../../../j/u/r/User%7EJurgensen_49aa.html" title="User:Jurgensen">Jurgensen</a> 11:20, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I agree. In my opinion, the whole of the two sections on Ciutat Vella and Montjuic Tibidabo are not suitable for inclusion and should be removed. The first sentence is enough. They are pure tourist information and would be much better placed in Wikitravel.</p>

<p>I'm trying to move the useful information to Culture and then delete the part than reads like a travel guide. I did it so far with the museums and modernist architecture parts, but these two are more difficult. Part of the Montjuic section may be used in a section about the changes the city suffered for the Olympic Games - perhaps as part of a remodeled history section or in a new part about urbanism?. Part of the Ciutat Vella section may go into a Monuments and landmarks section under culture. A bit more information about tourism (numbers perhaps) would be good too. --<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndromeda_6fce.html" title="User:Andromeda">Andromeda</a> 08:15, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I would not go as far as to say there should be no tourist section at all. Tourism is a vital part of Barcelona, many people think tourism when they hear Barcelona.

<p>The Byzantine Emperor Justinian I was born near Bilbao, at Tauresium, in 483. In 518, Barcelonius was almost completely destroyed by an earthquake.

<p>As far as i know the roman empire never reached or governed provinces near or in modern day Scandinavia. Stockholm, as the modern day capital of Sweden, wasn't even a settlement nor was there any other in that region at that time. Someone having fun? I fail to se the humour.</p>

<p>Take it from me, the Modern Barcelona section does not need to a rewrite, it needs a wipe-out because it is all a load of nonsense. The creten who originally placed it back on 11th November 2006 did nothing but add rubbish to pages, including some nonsense that Portugal is today Spanish territory. The section mentions stupid things like Starbucks and Coffee Prima and "Guchi Muchiti", a cleverly devised name that nobody has heard of, and it links to Anton Gaudi, an architect who lived in "more modern" times. Don't be fooled by the clever writing because it is clear that the idiot pasted it from somewhere else and changed bits and pieces. I cannot work out where because it is rather well consealed, but the Portugal nonsense was taken from a section of the Iraq page and word for word it copied the campaign with the Kurds. How do I know? He left a vital clue when he "missed" a keyword - Anfal - which I know to refer to the Halabja chemical airstrikes in 1988. Another thing, the Greek toponym for Catelonia is <i>i Katelonía</i> not Katelonos, that sounds more like Greek-meets-Latin in Iberia, and as for Stockholm, that is right, the Roman Empire at its strongest conquered Southerna and Central Europe (besides outside of Europe). And I don't think Stockholm was founded yet, if it were, it would have bore a different name and even so, the early Germanic tribes emerged from their prehistory <i>after</i> contact with Rome from whom they derive their writing systems (including Runic). I'd delete it. <a href="../../../e/v/l/User%7EEvlekis_1e94.html" title="User:Evlekis">Evlekis</a> 19:10, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Good point. I simply called the text "Yes Stockholm" in response to the previous one called "Stockholm?", I thought it would make people read it. I didn't wish to delete it myself because it might have looked like vandalism given that many must have accepted the stupid version as true. As for Iraq, the same vandal played with the Portuguese page and in it, Anfal was named. Anfal (like Moesia here) was to do with Iraq and the war with the Kurds, in other words, complete nonsense. Well done for deleting the rubbish.

<p>The current map is utterly unhelpful for learning exactly where Barcelona is. Most articles about cities (for example, <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paris.html" title="Paris">Paris</a>) show a map of the city's country with a dot showing the city's exact location within the country. The current map shows the immediate area around Barcelona with no indication of where that is. Furthermore, the map is in Spanish, meaning the only part of the map that might indicate a possible location, the Mediterranean Sea, may not be recognized by someone with no knowledge of Spanish. Going by this map, Barcelona could be literally anywhere in Spain.</p>

<p>The talk of of <a href="../../../m/o/d/Modernist_architecture.html" title="Modernist architecture">Modernist_architecture</a> is a bit misleading.

<blockquote>
<p>Catalan Modernisme (not to be confused with modernism) was the Catalan Art Nouveau / Jugendstil movement, from roughly 1888 to 1911.</p>

Thus, going by this map, and with no knowledge of Spanish — and I believe, on the English Wikipedia, we must assume the reader <i>only</i> knows English — Barcelona could be next to a body of water quite literally <i>anywhere</i> in Spain. — <a href="../../../a/t/h/User_talk%7EAthelwulf_6c27.html" title="User talk:Athelwulf">Äþelwulf</a> <small><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Athelwulf_6e4a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Athelwulf">See my contributions.</a></small> 08:50, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Since it seems that it would escalate into an edit war if I were to re-instate the panorama (for reference, here is the version of the article with the panorama<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Barcelona&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=104061529" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Barcelona&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=104061529" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>), I've brought the issue to the talk page. I personally feel that the panorama adds plenty of value to the citscape section and I dispute the reason for reversion by Andromeda which is that it disrupts the flow of text. As mentioned in the edit comments, I don't feel that this is a significant problem as it is at the top of the section and does not interfere with any text. There are many precedents for such panoramas in city articles such as <a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlanta.html" title="Atlanta">Atlanta</a>, <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frankfurt.html" title="Frankfurt">Frankfurt</a>, <a href="../../../b/a/t/Bath%2C_Somerset_c16f.html" title="Bath, Somerset">Bath</a>, etc. These are just the ones I can think of, but I am certain there are many others.

<dd>I don't personally find the panorama particularly disruptive to text flow, and it's a good quality image, unlike some others on the Barcelona article - for example: Port of Barcelona, MACBA, Cabs, and many of the "some of the sites".

<p>I tried another thing. Reducing the picture to 1000 pixels avoids the need to scroll right to see all of it, while we still can see the full size one by clicking on it. What do you think? <a href="../../../m/a/u/User%7EMaurice27_b87e.html" title="User:Maurice27">Maurice27</a> 16:07, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Its a good idea but it only displays as you describe for people with 1280x1024 resolution. If a user has 800x600 or 1024x768 resolution, it will display approximately 3/4 of the picture and scroll the last 1/4 which is somewhat awkward. If a user has higher resolution than this, it won't cover the width of the screen on many PCs and would be almost more of a waste of screen real-estate than if it were scrollable but large, in my opinion. Since we can't control the width of everyone's screen, trying to set it at a particular length to avoid scrolling is difficult. Regardless, I think it still deserves a place in the article in some form. <a href="../../../d/i/l/User%7EDiliff_29f1.html" title="User:Diliff">Diliff</a> <small>| <a href="../../../d/i/l/User_talk%7EDiliff_39f9.html" title="User talk:Diliff">(Talk)</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Diliff_8e9b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Diliff">(Contribs)</a></small> 16:31, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

Nonetheless, here's my take on it: The picture's good, but I hear what people are saying about it causing problems for people with narrower screens - although I'm normally on 1440 x 900 pixels of MacBook goodness, I'm keenly aware of how awful 800 x 600 can be sometimes. To solve both of these problems, how about putting it in its own scrollifyer such as at <a href="../../../e/m/p/Empire_State_Building_5b2a.html#Observation_decks" title="Empire State Building">Empire State Building#Observation decks</a>?

<dd>Thanks for the kind words. Why Andromeda or the other anon editor think the image is irrelevant is beyond me. What better way to show the cityscape than with a wide panorama stretching from the hills, across the city and to the port? I do think it would be a waste to allow them bully others into submission by continually reverting the inclusion of the image, just because they do not personally like the image or its placemen and have recently been the most prolific contributor. I also agree with you about the width of the image. If it is going to be scrollable, it might as well be significantly scrollable instead of just the final 20% of the image. I think it could also benefit from being a little taller (a byproduct of increasing width). <a href="../../../d/i/l/User%7EDiliff_29f1.html" title="User:Diliff">Diliff</a> <small>| <a href="../../../d/i/l/User_talk%7EDiliff_39f9.html" title="User talk:Diliff">(Talk)</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Diliff_8e9b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Diliff">(Contribs)</a></small> 23:39, 14 February 2007 (UTC)

<p>The first thing striking me about this article is that the lead seems too short for an article over a city as important as this, but I think the biggest problem is the references. Almost all of them are in the spanish language, compleatly incomphrehensible to most English wikipedia readers i'd figure. I don't think it matters how many there are if most people can't even read them to see if they are, in fact, referencing the facts they purport to cite. <a href="../../../h/o/m/User%7EHomestarmy_5e94.html" title="User:Homestarmy">Homestarmy</a> 04:24, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Agreed Delist</b> Is that gallery at the end really needed? Pehaps it can instead be made into a tourism section. <a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETarret_c08f.html" title="User:Tarret">Tarret</a> 14:38, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><b>Delist</b> — My main point of contention is the poor map "showing" where Barcelona is.
<ol>
<li>The map is in Spanish. This alone makes the map useless. I believe we should assume the reader <i>only</i> knows English.</li>
<li>The map only shows the immediate area around Barcelona, with no indication of its location relative to anything the reader might recognize other than the Mediterranean Sea. This alone <i>also</i> makes the map useless.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>Thus, going by the map alone, Barcelona could be next to <i>any</i> body of water literally <i>anywhere</i> in Spain. A <i>much</i> better map would be one like those for <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paris.html" title="Paris">Paris</a>, <a href="../../../b/e/r/Berlin.html" title="Berlin">Berlin</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/l/Milan.html" title="Milan">Milan</a>, <a href="../../../z/%C3%BC/r/Z%C3%BCrich.html" title="Zürich">Zürich</a>, or <a href="../../../m/u/n/Munich.html" title="Munich">Munich</a>. — <a href="../../../a/t/h/User_talk%7EAthelwulf_6c27.html" title="User talk:Athelwulf">Äþelwulf</a> <small><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Athelwulf_6e4a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Athelwulf">See my contributions.</a></small> 09:22, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Forget the previous message, I saw it. However, I have to say one thing: references are in Catalan (learn the difference with Spanish) because there don't exist English references for these facts. I do think Catalan references are better that no references at all. --<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndromeda_6fce.html" title="User:Andromeda">Andromeda</a> 18:21, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I just changed the spanish names for their real names in catalan). You know the usual (and official) name for nomenclature in Bcn is catalan. We don't use the spanish names, because they are not their original ones, and because some of them they don't exist (and they sound ridiculous for us). If you have some doubt, let's check the catalan wikipage of Barcelona... 83.49.208.146 11:16, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
