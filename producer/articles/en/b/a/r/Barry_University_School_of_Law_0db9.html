<p><b>Barry University School of Law</b> is an ABA accredited law school located in <a href="../../../o/r/l/Orlando%2C_Florida_6d05.html" title="Orlando, Florida">Orlando, Florida</a>. The school's mission is to educate students to become responsible lawyers, trained to assume an active role in the legal community. At Barry Law, students are trained to act in strict accord with the highest ethical standards and to exercise their professional skills competently, with sensitivity to the needs and concerns of their clients.</p>
<p>Students at Barry Law have many opportunities to experience the “law-in-action” concept, both in the classroom and through practical application. Small classes foster a collegial student/professor relationship and enable the School of Law to provide legal education at its best.</p>
<p>Barry Law offers a three-year daytime program structured for full-time students. The School of Law also offers a four-year extended studies program in the evening to accommodate working adults or anyone who, for whatever reason, is unable to pursue three full-time years of study toward a law degree.</p>

<p>Barry Law School offers an in-house clinical opportunity for students in the Children and Families Clinic (CFC). The CFC focuses on advocacy for children in the areas of delinquency, dependency, mental health and education law. All students in the CFC are certified as legal interns by the Florida Supreme Court. Certification as a legal intern enables the law student, under the CFC professor (who is a licensed attorney), to provide actual representation to indigent clients. The In-House Clinical Programs expect to expand in the near future to include clinical opportunities for students interested in a variety of legal areas.</p>

<p>Barry University Law Review is a scholarly law journal edited and published annually by students of the School of Law. Issues of the Law Review typically contain articles of current legal interest authored by law professors, judges, practitioners, and student members. Law students perform all editing on articles contained in the journal.</p>
<p>As part of the curriculum of the Law School, students receive academic credit for their work on the Law Review. Ordinarily, only top law students are selected to be members of the Law Review staff. Law firms, judges, and legal scholars recognize the scholarly achievement and hard work required of those students as the pinnacle of a law student's resume. Many times each year the highest courts in America are persuaded by and in fact quote articles published in law reviews.</p>

<p>Barry University <a href="../../../m/o/o/Moot_Court_33a6.html" title="Moot Court">Moot Court</a> Board is an invitational organization composed of upper-class students selected on the basis of academic achievement and oral advocacy skills. Membership on the Board is designed to strengthen the skills needed for trial and appellate brief writing and oral advocacy. Members of the Moot Court Board also work with first-year Legal Writing students in preparation for their oral arguments, and prepare an intra-school competition for new applicants to the Board. Members receive credit for participation in Board activities and competitions.</p>
<p>Members have competed and won praise in inter-school competitions open to law students from all over the United States. The Board has also sponsored a Law Day intra-school demonstration for members of the Bar and the general public, and hopes to become involved in local public school programs in oral advocacy.</p>

<p>The Trial Team is designed to give students real-world training in trial skills while still in law school. These skills, exhibited by team members in competition, carried the Barry University School of Law to the Final Four out of 223 teams nationwide in the Association of Trial Lawyers of America Trial Team Competition in April, 2005. To advance to that point, Barry defeated, in regional and then national championship round competition, several past national champions. In the Final Four semi-final round, Barry was one point on one judge’s scorecard away from advancing to the final round.</p>
