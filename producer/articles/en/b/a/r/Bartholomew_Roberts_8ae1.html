Bart Roberts' memorial stone in Little Newcastle</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Roberts was born in 1682 in the village of Casnewydd-Bach,<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup> (Little Newcastle), between <a href="../../../f/i/s/Fishguard.html" title="Fishguard">Fishguard</a> and <a href="../../../h/a/v/Haverfordwest.html" title="Haverfordwest">Haverfordwest</a> in <a href="../../../p/e/m/Pembrokeshire.html" title="Pembrokeshire">Pembrokeshire</a>, <a href="../../../w/a/l/Wales.html" title="Wales">Wales</a>. His name was originally John Roberts, and his father is thought to have been George Roberts.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup> It is unknown why he changed his name from John to Bartholomew.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup> He apparently went to sea at the age of 13 in 1695 but there is no further record of him until 1718, when he was mate of a <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barbados.html" title="Barbados">Barbados</a> <a href="../../../s/l/o/Sloop.html" title="Sloop">sloop</a>.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[6]</a></sup> In 1719 he was third mate aboard the <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slave_ship.html" title="Slave ship">slave ship</a> <i>Princess</i> of London, under Captain Abraham Plumb. In early June that year the <i>Princess</i> was anchored at Anomabu, then spelled Annamaboa, which is situated along the <a href="../../../g/o/l/Gold_Coast_%28British_colony%29_5b2d.html" title="Gold Coast (British colony)">Gold Coast</a> of West Africa (present-day <a href="../../../g/h/a/Ghana.html" title="Ghana">Ghana</a>), when she was captured by pirates. The pirates were in two ships, the <i>Royal Rover</i> and the <i>Royal James</i>, and were led by captain <a href="../../../h/o/w/Howell_Davis_09b5.html" title="Howell Davis">Howell Davis</a>. Davis, like Roberts, was a <a href="../../../w/a/l/Wales.html" title="Wales">Welshman</a>, originally from <a href="../../../m/i/l/Milford_Haven_c6ae.html" title="Milford Haven">Milford Haven</a> in <a href="../../../p/e/m/Pembrokeshire.html" title="Pembrokeshire">Pembrokeshire</a>. Several of the crew of the <i>Princess</i> of London were forced to join the pirates, including Roberts. Davis quickly discovered Roberts' abilities as a <a href="../../../n/a/v/Navigator.html" title="Navigator">navigator</a> and took to consulting him.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[7]</a></sup> Roberts is said to have initially been reluctant to become a pirate, but soon came to see the advantages of his new life. Captain Charles Johnson reports him as saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In an honest service there is thin commons, low wages, and hard labour. In this, plenty and satiety, pleasure and ease, liberty and power; and who would not balance creditor on this side, when all the hazard that is run for it, at worst is only a sour look or two at choking? No, a merry life and a short one shall be my motto.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>

The death of Captain Howell Davis in an ambush on Príncipe</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>It is easy to understand the lure of piracy; in the merchant navy, Roberts' wage was less than £3 per month and he had no chance of promotion to captaincy.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p>A few weeks later the <i>Royal James</i> had to be abandoned because of worm damage. The <i>Royal Rover</i> headed for the Isle of Princes, now <a href="../../../p/r/%C3%AD/Pr%C3%ADncipe.html" title="Príncipe">Príncipe</a>. Davis hoisted the flags of a British man-of-war, and was allowed to enter the harbour. After a few days Davis invited the governor to lunch on board his ship, intending to hold him hostage for a ransom. As Davis had to send boats to collect the governor, he was invited to call at the fort for a glass of wine first. The Portuguese had by now discovered that their visitors were pirates, and on the way to the fort Davis' party were ambushed and Davis himself shot dead.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p>A new captain now had to be elected. Davis' crew was divided into "Lords" and "Commons", and it was the "Lords" who had the right to propose a name to the remainder of the crew. Within six weeks of his capture, Roberts was elected captain. This was an unusual move since he was openly against his even being on board the vessel, and was probably due to his navigational abilities and his demeanor, which history reflects was outspoken and opinionated. According to Johnson:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He accepted of the Honour, saying, that since he had dipp'd his Hands in Muddy Water, and must be a Pyrate, it was better being a Commander than a common Man.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>His first act as captain was to lead the crew back to Príncipe to avenge the death of Captain Davis. Roberts and his crew sprang onto the island in the darkness of night, killed a large portion of the male population, and stole all items of value that they could carry away. Soon afterwards he captured a Dutch Guineaman, then two days later an English ship called the <i>Experiment</i>. While the ship took on water and provisions at Anamboe, a vote was taken on whether the next voyage should be to the <a href="../../../e/a/s/East_Indies_31c2.html" title="East Indies">East Indies</a> or to <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brazil.html" title="Brazil">Brazil</a>. The vote was for Brazil.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>
<p>The combination of bravery and success that marked this adventure cemented most of the crew's loyalty to Roberts. They concluded that he was "pistol proof" and that they had much to gain by staying with him.<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[13]</a></sup></p>

<p>Roberts and his crew crossed the Atlantic and watered and boot-topped<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[14]</a></sup> their ship on the uninhabited island of Ferdinando. They then spent about nine weeks off the Brazilian coast, but saw no ships. They were about to leave for the <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Indies_8d74.html" title="West Indies">West Indies</a> when they encountered a fleet of 42 Portuguese ships in the <a href="../../../b/a/%C3%AD/Ba%C3%ADa_de_Todos_os_Santos_a606.html" title="Baía de Todos os Santos">Todos os Santos' Bay</a>, waiting for two men-of-war of 70 guns each to escort them to <a href="../../../l/i/s/Lisbon.html" title="Lisbon">Lisbon</a>. Roberts took one of the vessels, and ordered her master to point out the richest ship in the fleet. He pointed out a ship of 40 guns and a crew of 170, which Roberts and his men boarded and captured. The ship proved to contain 40,000 gold moidors and jewelry including a cross set with diamonds, designed for the King of Portugal.<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[15]</a></sup></p>
<p>The <i>Rover</i> now headed for <a href="../../../d/e/v/Devil%27s_Island_7af8.html" title="Devil's Island">Devil's Island</a> off the coast of Guiana to spend the booty. A few weeks later they headed for the River Surinam, where they captured a sloop. When a <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brigantine.html" title="Brigantine">brigantine</a> was sighted, Roberts took forty men to pursue it in the sloop, leaving <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walter_Kennedy_%28pirate%29_9209.html" title="Walter Kennedy (pirate)">Walter Kennedy</a> in command of the <i>Rover</i>. The sloop became wind-bound for eight days, and when Roberts and his men were finally able to return, they discovered that Kennedy had sailed off with the <i>Rover</i> and what remained of the loot.<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[16]</a></sup> Roberts and his crew renamed their sloop the <i>Fortune</i> and agreed new articles, which they swore on a Bible to uphold.<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[17]</a></sup></p>

<p>In late February 1720 they were joined by the French pirate Montigny la Palisse in another sloop, the <i>Sea King</i>. The inhabitants of <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barbados.html" title="Barbados">Barbados</a> equipped two well-armed ships, the <i>Summerset</i> and the <i>Philipa</i>, to try to put an end to the pirate menace. On <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_26.html" title="February 26">26 February</a> they encountered the two pirate sloops. The <i>Sea King</i> quickly fled, and after sustaining considerable damage the <i>Fortune</i> broke off the engagement and was able to escape.<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[18]</a></sup> Roberts headed for <a href="../../../d/o/m/Dominica.html" title="Dominica">Dominica</a> to repair the sloop, with twenty of his crew dying of their wounds on the voyage. There were also two sloops from <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martinique.html" title="Martinique">Martinique</a> out searching for the pirates, and Roberts swore vengeance against the inhabitants of Barbados and Martinique. He had a new flag made with a drawing of himself standing upon 2 skulls, one labelled ABH (A Barbadian's Head) and the other AMH (A Martiniquian's Head).</p>

<p>The <i>Fortune</i> now headed northwards towards <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newfoundland.html" title="Newfoundland">Newfoundland</a>. After capturing a number of ships around the Newfoundland banks Roberts raided the harbour of Ferryland, capturing a dozen vessels. On 21 June he attacked the larger harbour of <a href="../../../t/r/e/Trepassey%2C_Newfoundland_and_Labrador_10ec.html" title="Trepassey, Newfoundland and Labrador">Trepassey</a>, sailing in with black flags flying. All the ships in the habour were abandoned by their panic-stricken captains and crews, and the pirates were masters of Trepassey without any resistance being offered. Roberts had captured 22 ships, but was angered by the cowardice of the captains who had fled their ships. Every morning when a gun was fired, the captains were forced to attend Roberts on board his ship; they were told that anyone who was absent would have his ship burnt. One <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brig.html" title="Brig">brig</a> from <a href="../../../b/r/i/Bristol.html" title="Bristol">Bristol</a> was taken over by the pirates to replace the sloop <i>Fortune</i> and fitted out with 16 guns. When the pirates left in late June, all the other vessels in the harbour were set on fire.During July Roberts captured nine or ten French ships and commandeered one of them, fitting her with 26 cannons and changing her name to the <i>Good Fortune</i>. With this more powerful ship, the pirates captured many more vessels before heading south for the West Indies, accompanied by Montigny la Palisse's sloop, which had rejoined them.<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[19]</a></sup></p>
<p>In September 1720 the <i>Good Fortune</i> was <a href="../../../c/a/r/Careening.html" title="Careening">careened</a> and repaired at the island of <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carriacou_and_Petite_Martinique_9440.html" title="Carriacou and Petite Martinique">Carriacou</a> before being renamed the <i>Royal Fortune</i>, the first of several ships to be given this name by Roberts. In late September the <i>Royal Fortune</i> and the <i>Fortune</i> headed for the island of St. Christopher's, and entered Basse Terra Road flying black flags and with their drummers and trumpeters playing. They sailed in among the ships in the Road, all of whom promptly struck their flags.<sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[20]</a></sup> The next landfall was at the island of St. Bartholomew, where the French governor allowed the pirates to remain for several weeks to carouse. By <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_25.html" title="October 25">25 October</a> they were at sea again, off <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Lucia_73b9.html" title="St. Lucia">St. Lucia</a>, where they captured up to 15 French and English ships in the next three days.<sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[21]</a></sup> Among the captured ships was the <i>Greyhound</i>, whose chief mate, James Skyrme, joined the pirates. He would later become captain of Roberts' consort, the <i>Ranger</i>.</p>
<p>In early April 1721 the pirates captured a French man of war and discovered that one of the passengers was the Governor of Martinique. Roberts had him hanged from the yardarm.<sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[22]</a></sup> By the spring of 1721, Roberts' depredations had almost brought sea-borne trade in the West Indies to a standstill.<sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[23]</a></sup> The <i>Royal Fortune</i> and the <i>Good Fortune</i> therefore set sail for West Africa.

Bartholomew Roberts at Ouidah with his ship and captured merchantmen in the background.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>By late April, Roberts was at the <a href="../../../c/a/p/Cape_Verde_a290.html" title="Cape Verde">Cape Verde</a> islands. The <i>Royal Fortune</i> was found to be leaky, and was abandoned here. The pirates transferred to the <i>Sea King</i>, which was renamed the <i>Royal Fortune</i>. The new <i>Royal Fortune</i> made landfall off the Guinea coast in early June, near the mouth of the Senegal River. Two French ships, one of 10 guns and one of 16 guns, gave chase, but were captured by Roberts. Both these ships were commandeered. One, the <i>Comte de Toulouse</i> was renamed the <i>Ranger</i>, while the other was named the <i>Little Ranger</i> and used as a storeship. Thomas Sutton was made captain of the <i>Ranger</i> and James Skyrme captain of the <i>Little Ranger</i>.<sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[24]</a></sup></p>
<p>Roberts now headed for <a href="../../../s/i/e/Sierra_Leone_8171.html" title="Sierra Leone">Sierra Leone</a>, arriving on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_12.html" title="June 12">12 June</a>. Here he was told that two <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Navy_80f7.html" title="Royal Navy">Royal Navy</a> ships, H.M.S. Swallow and H.M.S. Weymouth, had left at the end of April, planning to return before Christmas.<sup id="_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#_note-24" title="">[25]</a></sup> On <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_8.html" title="August 8">8 August</a> he captured two large ships at Point Cestos, three hundred miles SE of Sierra Leone. One of these was the frigate <i>Onslow</i>, transporting soldiers bound for Cape Coast Castle. A number of the soldiers wished to join the pirates and were eventually accepted, but as landlubbers were given only a quarter share. The <i>Onslow</i> was converted to become the fourth <i>Royal Fortune</i>.<sup id="_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#_note-25" title="">[26]</a></sup> In November and December the pirates careened their ships and relaxed at Cape Lopez and the island of Annabon.<sup id="_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#_note-26" title="">[27]</a></sup> Sutton was replaced by Skyrme as captain of the <i>Ranger</i>. They captured several vessels in January 1722, then sailed into <a href="../../../o/u/i/Ouidah.html" title="Ouidah">Ouidah</a> harbour with black flags flying. All the eleven ships at anchor there immediately struck their colours.<sup id="_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#_note-27" title="">[28]</a></sup></p>

Bartholomew Roberts' crew carousing at the <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calabar.html" title="Calabar">Calabar</a> River. Most of the crew were drunk when the <i>Swallow</i> appeared.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>On <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_5.html" title="February 5">5 February</a> H.M.S. Swallow, commanded by Captain <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chalonor_Ogle_%28Royal_Navy_officer%29_f9fb.html" title="Chalonor Ogle (Royal Navy officer)">Chalonor Ogle</a>, came upon the three pirate ships, the <i>Royal Fortune</i>, the <i>Ranger</i> and the <i>Little Ranger</i> careening at Cape Lopez. The <i>Swallow</i> veered away to avoid a sandbank, making the pirates think that she was a fleeing merchant ship. The <i>Ranger</i>, commanded by James Skyrme, departed in pursuit. Once out of earshot of the other pirates, the <i>Swallow</i> opened her gun ports and an engagement began. Ten of the pirates were killed and Skyrme had his leg taken off by a cannon ball, but refused to leave the deck. Eventually the <i>Ranger</i> was forced to strike her colours and the surviving crew were captured.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_10.html" title="February 10">10 February</a> the <i>Swallow</i> returned to Cape Lopez and found the <i>Royal Fortune</i> still there. The previous day Roberts had captured the <i>Neptune</i>, and many of his crew were drunk and unfit for duty just when he needed them most.<sup id="_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#_note-28" title="">[29]</a></sup> The pirates at first thought that the approaching ship was the <i>Ranger</i> returning, but a deserter from the <i>Swallow</i> recognized her and informed the captain. Roberts was breakfasting in company with Captain Hill, the master of the <i>Neptune</i>, when he was given the news. As he usually did before action, he dressed himself in his finest clothes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Roberts himself made a gallant figure, at the time of the engagement, being dressed in a rich crimson damask waistcoat and breeches, a red feather in his hat, a gold chain round his neck, with a diamond cross hanging to it, a sword in his hand, and two pairs of pistols slung over his shoulders ...<sup id="_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#_note-29" title="">[30]</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The pirates' plan was to sail past the <i>Swallow</i>, which meant exposing themselves to one broadside. Once past, they would have a good chance of escaping. However the helmsman failed to keep the <i>Royal Fortune</i> on the right course, and the <i>Swallow</i> was able to approach to deliver a second broadside. Captain Roberts was killed by <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grapeshot.html" title="Grapeshot">grapeshot</a> cannon fire, which struck him in the throat, while he stood on the deck. Before his body could be captured by Ogle, Roberts' wish to be buried at sea was fulfilled by his crew, who weighted his body down and threw his body overboard.</p>

<p>The battle continued for another two hours, until the <i>Royal Fortune'</i>s mainmast fell and the pirates signalled for quarter. One member of the crew, John Philips, tried to reach the magazine with a lighted match to blow up the ship, but was prevented by two forced men. Only three pirates, including Roberts, had been killed in the battle. A total of 272 men had been captured by the navy. Of these, 75 were black, and these were sold into slavery. The remainder, apart from those who died on the voyage back, were taken to Cape Coast Castle. 54 were condemned to death, of whom 52 were hanged and two reprieved.

<p>Captain <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chalonor_Ogle_%28Royal_Navy_officer%29_f9fb.html" title="Chalonor Ogle (Royal Navy officer)">Chalonor Ogle</a> claimed to have missed out on the treasure which the pirates had left on the <i>Little Ranger</i> when they sailed to their last engagement with the <i>Swallow</i>. Of the lesser loot Ogle did admit having taken possession of, from the <i>Ranger</i> and <i>Royal Fortune</i>, the crew did not receive their share until Ogle was reluctantly forced to give it to them by the legal system, three years later. By the time Ogle and his men arrived to take the treasure in the <i>Little Ranger</i> it had gone, with Captain Hill of the <i>Neptune</i>. Several weeks after the defeat of Bartholemew Roberts, however, Captain Ogle and Captain Hill had both sailed across the <a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlantic.html" title="Atlantic">Atlantic</a> and were in <a href="../../../p/o/r/Port_Royal_fa77.html" title="Port Royal">Port Royal</a> at the same time. Even if this is assumed to be a coincidence, it seems nearly inconceivable that Captain Ogle, who was already swindling his own crew, would not have then confronted Captain Hill, who in theory Ogle could easily have had hanged for trading with pirates. It therefore seems likely that the larger part of Bartholemew Robert's treasure ended up in the hands of Captain Ogle, and some part in the hands of Captain Hill.</p>

<p>Most of the information on Roberts comes from Captain Charles Johnson's book <a href="../../../a/_/g/A_General_History_of_the_Pyrates_2db6.html" title="A General History of the Pyrates">A General History of the Pyrates</a> published a few years after Roberts' death. "Charles Johnson" is a <a href="../../../p/s/e/Pseudonym.html" title="Pseudonym">pseudonym</a>, and it has been suggested that the author was in fact <a href="../../../d/a/n/Daniel_Defoe_2b0c.html" title="Daniel Defoe">Daniel Defoe</a>, but this is disputed. Johnson devotes more space to Roberts than to any of the other pirates in his book, describing him as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>... a tall black man, near forty years of age ... of good natural parts and personal bravery, though he applied them to such wicked purposes as made them of no commendation, frequently drinking 'Damn to him who ever lived to wear a halter'.<sup id="_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#_note-37" title="">[38]</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>After his exploits in Newfoundland the Governor of <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_England_30a7.html" title="New England">New England</a> commented that "one cannot with-hold admiration for his bravery and courage".<sup id="_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#_note-38" title="">[39]</a></sup> He hated cowardice, and when the crews of 22 ships in Trepassey harbour fled without firing a shot he was angry at their failure to defend their ships.<sup id="_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#_note-39" title="">[40]</a></sup></p>
<p>Roberts was the archetypal pirate captain in his love of fine clothing and jewelry, but had some traits unusual in a pirate, notably a preference for drinking tea rather than rum. He is often described as a <a href="../../../t/e/e/Teetotaler.html" title="Teetotaler">teetotaler</a> and a <a href="../../../s/a/b/Sabbatarian.html" title="Sabbatarian">Sabbatarian</a>, but there is no proof of this. He certainly disliked drunkenness while at sea, but Johnson does not state that he was a teetotaller and implies that he drank beer.<sup id="_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="#_note-40" title="">[41]</a></sup> The claim that he was a sabbatarian is based on the article which stated that the musicians were not obliged to play on Sundays, but this may merely have been intended to ensure the musicians a day's rest, as they were obliged to play music whenever the crew demanded it of them on other days.</p>
<p>Black Bart was not as cruel to prisoners as some pirates, such as <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_Lowe_6277.html" title="Edward Lowe">Edward Lowe</a>, but did not treat them as well as did Howell Davis or <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_England_b9c9.html" title="Edward England">Edward England</a>. Johnson says that he would sometimes ill-use prisoners if he felt that the crew demanded it, but:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When he found that rigour was not expected from his people (for he often practised it to appease them) then he would give strangers to understand that it was pure inclination that induced him to a good treatment of them, and not any love or partiality to their persons; "For", says he, "there is none of you but will hang me, I know, whenever you can clinch me within your power".<sup id="_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="#_note-41" title="">[42]</a></sup></p>
