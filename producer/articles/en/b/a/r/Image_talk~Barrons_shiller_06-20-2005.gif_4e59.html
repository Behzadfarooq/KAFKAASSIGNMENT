<p>Housing is just like any other product; the price is constantly adjusted by the forces of supply and demand. The very sharp increase shown in the chart is a function of several forces. Two of of the key forces are illustrated in the chart even though one of them is partially hidden. Another force illustrated in the chart, construction cost, has little bearing. Tremendous wealth being created by high productivity growth is another important factor.</p>
<p><br /></p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/r/Image_talk%7EBarrons_shiller_06-20-2005.gif_4e59.html" title="Edit section: Low Interst Costs">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Low Interst Costs</span></h2>
<p>The first powerful force illustrated is the interest costs which are approximated in the chart by the 10 year Treasury Bond Yield. The interest costs often make up to 90% of ones monthly house payment, therefore, if interest rates go up, houses are much more expensive to own and if they go down, houses are much cheaper to own. Interest rates were in a long down trend down from 1981 until 2003. As rates went down, consumers were able to pay a higher price for a house and yet not increase the monthly payment. As this happened year after year for 18 years, houses went up and up and owners who sold one house at a profit became more and more anxious to buy their next home. One tendency encouraged by this ever increasing spiral was to buy bigger and bigger homes. Another part of the big growth story has been the growth in second home purchases for vacation purposes or for rental income. Indeed, many an an owner has become so anxious that they have purchased a new home before selling their existing home. In a growing number of instances, the owners decide to keep the first home as a rental property. Another affect has been that the low yields on 10 year treasury bonds have boosted the relative value of the yield from rental property.</p>
<p>Because there is often 80% or more leverage involved, a 10% increase in the price of ones home translates into an even high increase in ones equity and on ones return on investment. To illustrate with easy math, if we assume a 10% down payment and a 10% increase in the value of the house, the return on equity is 100%!</p>
<p><br /></p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/r/Image_talk%7EBarrons_shiller_06-20-2005.gif_4e59.html" title="Edit section: Baby Boomers">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Baby Boomers</span></h2>
<p>The second force relates to the population graph. This graph shows the total growth in the population. Of course, the higher the population the higher the demand and, again, the price is set by the interplay of supply and demand. What this graph hides is the tremendous growth in population of home buying age. In the late 1940's and all through the 1950's, many people (about 78 million Americans) were born. All of these folks are now at or near their prime earnings years; they are on average making more money than ever before. For example, more people will turn 52 years of age over the next couple of years than in other two years in history and more people buy a vacation home at the age of 52 than at any other age. Also, the average age of the average child of these "baby boomers" is now around the prime age for buying a first home. The baby boom that occurred after WWII has created a high level of demand.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/r/Image_talk%7EBarrons_shiller_06-20-2005.gif_4e59.html" title="Edit section: Mountains of Disposable Income">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Mountains of Disposable Income</span></h2>
<p>A third powerful force not illustrated in the chart is the extraordinary growth of disposable income in America. This great wealth is a result of free trade and productivity growth. A couple of days ago, my wife bought a dress shirt for me. She paid less than $7. A similar shirt purchased 30 years ago would have cost $30. Under normal circumstances, inflation would have taken the price from $30 to $70 or so over these past 30 years. In effect, the cost of a shirt in real terums has been cut by 90%! A similar story could have been told using a calculator, computer or refrigerator (I paid over $1,200 for my first calculator and over $2,000 for my first cell phone). A relatively small number of Americans have been hurt on balance by free trade, all have benefited from the reduced costs of goods and services.</p>
<p>Without going into great detail here, the reality is that high productivity creates wealth and disposable income grows exponentially to income. Free trade lowers costs and therefore also serves to create disposable income. The dramatic world wide gains in productivity of the past 10 years have been stronger than at any time other than perhaps during the industrial revolution.</p>
<p><br /></p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/r/Image_talk%7EBarrons_shiller_06-20-2005.gif_4e59.html" title="Edit section: Powerful Combination--Lower Costs and Lots of People With Money">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Powerful Combination--Lower Costs and Lots of People With Money</span></h2>
<p>The bottom line is that the net costs of buying homes were reduced by the lower financing costs at a point in time when there were more people seeking a home and on average they had more money to spend than ever before. The argument has been made point and counter point time and again that the result is a housing "bubble" ready to pop. Only hind sight will provide the truth, but the average age of the baby boomers is still a low fifties number and the average age of their children is still a high 20's number. Furthermore, the average earnings of these folks is currently rising rapidly and the average amount of disposable income per household is rising at an even faster rate than the average income.</p>
<p>Strong arguments are available on both sides of the issue. Given that Shiller makes an argument that the bubble is bursting; here are some questions that suggest the housing boom may be only taking a pause.</p>
<p>1) Has the long down trend in interest rates been broken? Mortgage rates could be at 4.5% in nine months or less!</p>
<p>2) Will Americans continue to keep up with their neighbors? Even after the "panic" buying of last year, most Americans do not own a second home.</p>
<p>3) Will technology continue to spur high levels of productivity, wealth and disposable income? The time, effort and energy being saved through cell phone and Internet usage is just getting started.</p>
<p>4) Will free trade continue to hold down the cost of living? Despite the tremendous growth in manufacturing in China and the tremendous growth in service businesses in India, there are still billions of Chinese and Indians who still live "on the farm". They currently suvive off of $1 per day or less. A massive migration is underway, similar to the migration that happened in America almost 100 years ago. These folks are moving "off the farm". They are more than happy to dramatically increase their standard of living while providing low cost labor to produce an abundance of goods and services.</p>
<p>5) Will owning a second or third family home become as common as owning a second or third family car? When my Mom and Dad purchased the families first second car the neighbors could not understand the need. Today, many folks do not see the point of owning a second home, however, a second car rarely goes up in value. Those who own a beach house purchased at any time 5 to 100 years ago can brag about how much money they have made while enjoying the benefits of ownership.</p>
<p>Earlier, I dismissed the importance of construction costs. The reality is that the selling price is set by the market not by the cost of construction. Yes, if ample land is available, the replacement costs may put a lid on the amount of price appreciation one might expect, but, as they say, "they are not making any more land". The price of a new home really is set by supply and demand not by the builder. If the demand is very high, the builder realizing the situation will dramatically raise his price and he will make an extra high profit. If the demand is very low, the builder cannot build at a profit; he will stop building until the unsold homes on the market are depleted. The new price must exceed his construction costs plus the value of the land before he will build again but the relationship is not nearly as tight as is often presumed.</p>
<p>As of today, July 6, 2006, the supply of unsold homes on the market is over 6 months at current selling rates. Building continues but the pace is slowing dramatically in many markets. The rate on the 10 year bond is as high as it has been in several years. My belief, backed up by my actions, is that long bonds will be back down to 4% within 9 months. Thus it is my belief that the housing boom will resume in about 9 months. There are huge numbers of Americans in their late 40's and early 50's with children in their 20's and early 30's who have yet to buy.</p>
