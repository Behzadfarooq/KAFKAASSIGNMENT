<p><a href="../../../w/e/l/Wikipedia%7EWelcome%2C_newcomers_06aa.html" title="Wikipedia:Welcome, newcomers">Welcome</a> to Wikipedia, Barry Wells! My name is Ryan, aka <a href="../../../a/c/e/User%7EAcetic_Acid_31d1.html" title="User:Acetic Acid">Acetic Acid</a>. I noticed that you were new and haven't received any messages yet. I just wanted to see how you were doing. Wikipedia can be a little intimidating at first, since it uses different formatting than other sites that use <a href="../../../h/t/m/HTML_4c4a.html" title="HTML">HTML</a> and <a href="../../../c/a/s/Cascading_Style_Sheets_981c.html" title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</a>. In the long run, though, you'll find that the WikiSyntax is a lot easier and faster than those other ways. Here are a few links to get you started:</p>

</ul>
<p>There are a lot of policies and guides to read, but I highly recommend reading over those first. If you have any questions, feel free to leave me a message on my <a href="../../../a/c/e/User_talk%7EAcetic_Acid_8f87.html" title="User talk:Acetic Acid">talk page</a>. Please be sure to <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">sign your name on Talk Pages</a> using four tildes (~~~~) to produce your name and the current date, along with a link to your user page. This way, others know when you left a message and how to find you. It's easier than having to type out your name, right?&#160;:)</p>

<p>Very glad to read your comments on the <a href="../../../l/o/n/London%2C_Ontario_c3a0.html" title="London, Ontario">London, Ontario</a> page. You are in a very good position to answer a question for me, Mr. Wells, that is, <i>what the hell happened to Scene???</i> I read every edition of <b>Ram Fed and Loaded</b> (right after I read column). And then there it was....<i>Gone</i>! Horrible! Scene is now a shallow dish, whereas before the changes it was a tempest in a teacup. Curious minds want to know! Melonville hasn't been the same. Feel free to respond here or on my user page, as you prefer. And allow me to award you this... <b>The <a href="../../../l/e/m/Lemmy.html" title="Lemmy">Lemmy Kilmister</a> Public Service Award</b>!

<p>Hello Barry! I wanted to thank you for the reply to my questions about Scene. All things are clear now, too bad, so sad, you guys had a good thing going there. Entertaining and edifying in equal measure. Just to tell you that any additions, subtractions, embellishments or anything else you can think of as far as editing any of the articles here in WP, is cool with me. You have some good info on the Jack Richardson Music Awards? Go for it brother! I have no proprietary feelings for any of the articles I have started here in these pages. Although <a href="../../../l/i/s/Talk%7EList_of_people_who_have_said_that_they_are_gods_8f85.html" title="Talk:List of people who have said that they are gods">some people</a> do,and they can be extremely difficult to edit around. But not me, man, not me. BTW Barry, I too was born in Woodstockville and moved to London in the 70's. Thats why we are smarter than everyone else (it was the water). Take care man, you are a notable good egg! <a href="../../../h/a/m/User%7EHamster_Sandwich_8577.html" title="User:Hamster Sandwich">Hamster Sandwich</a> 04:08, 10 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I just read the article you started, <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philip_Aziz_d6bb.html" title="Philip Aziz">Philip Aziz</a>. I am glad you did it, I was going to write one on that artist myself. Any chance you can get permission to add a reproduction of some of his work to the article? I have no facility with importing images into the WP, just copying and pasteing existing ones from other pages. Also the addition you made to <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_Richardson_fc33.html" title="Jack Richardson">Jack Richardson</a> was most welcome! If I could find any biographical material on ggarth Richardson, I would happily write an article on him as well. Thanks again for your contributions to Wikipedia (aka Unemployed PhD Deathmatch!).

<p>Cool_Cat, I've just read some of your User Page and some of the details of your recent trials and tribulations. My gut feeling as a relatively new user on WP is that many in here and perhaps yourself have become "addicted" to this place and have let it replace real life.

<p>I mostly read the news stuff, and I think what I disliked was the uniform leftism so typical of Canadian regional weeklies, plus all the coverage of local news in a sad town. That's what has me convinced that your columns probably pissed me off, but I do also seem to recall there being one or two gems each on the local and the political fronts, stuff that was original and funny and even, on occasion, cogent. This may have been you... ...Hope this helps!

<p>Greetings:</p>
<p>With regards to your comments at <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_bureaucratship_Linuxbeak_%282%29_7140.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for bureaucratship/Linuxbeak (2)">Wikipedia:Requests for bureaucratship/Linuxbeak (2)</a>, I thought that you might appreciate a more thorough explication.</p>
<p>The English wikipedia has both American English users and Commonwealth English (i.e. "British" English) users. As such, there are occasionally competing grammar styles and methods of spelling. The <a href="../../../s/t/y/WP%7ESTYLE_9c31.html" title="WP:STYLE">Wikipedia Manual of Style</a> states that standards of American grammar will be followed in some instances, while standards of British grammar will be followed in other instances.</p>
<p>With particular respect to the issue of punctuation and quotation marks, the manual of style says:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>When punctuating quoted passages include the mark of punctuation inside the quotation marks</i> only if <i>the sense of the mark of punctuation is part of the quotation. This is the style used in Australia, New Zealand, and Britain, for example. (A fuller treatment of the recommendations given here can be found in</i> <a href="../../../f/o/w/Fowler%27s_Modern_English_Usage_c05f.html" title="Fowler's Modern English Usage">Fowler's Modern English Usage</a> <i>and other style guides for these countries, some of which vary in fine details.) "Stop!", for example, has the punctuation inside the quotation marks because the word "stop" is said with emphasis. When using "<a href="../../../s/c/a/Scare_quotes.html" title="Scare quotes">scare quotes</a>", however, the comma goes outside.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>Other examples:</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>Arthur said the situation was "deplorable".</i> (The <a href="../../../f/u/l/Full_stop.html" title="Full stop">full stop</a> (period) is not part of the quotation.)</dd>
<dd><i>Arthur said, "The situation is deplorable."</i> (The full sentence is quoted; the period is part of the quotation.)</dd>
<dd><i>Arthur said that the situation "was the most deplorable he had seen in years."</i> (Although the full sentence is not quoted, the sense of finality conveyed by the period is part of the quotation.)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Hope this helps clarify the issue for you.<br />

<p>This dispute between you and silsor seems to be a minor kerfluffle over a difference in two individuals sense of humour. I was, of course in the IRC while your argument was flaring up. My advice, if someone is really pissing you off, keep a cool head, and ignore the comments. There was a lot of chatter in IRC while you and silsor were having your convo, and I did think it odd that the really offensive comments by some of the other users were being ignored. My opinion, you can't like every person, all of the time, and you certainly aren't going to laugh at all of their jokes even if you do like the other editor. Since I am more thoroughly aquainted with your somewhat absurdist sense of humour, I am less likely to question humourous comments made by you in IRC, perhaps moreso than silsor is willing to be. And one last thing, Barry, I would implore you to not bring problems you, or anyone encounters in the IRC channels to the Wikipedia pages. IRC is not WP. Be well(s), noble editor! <a href="../../../h/a/m/User%7EHamster_Sandwich_8577.html" title="User:Hamster Sandwich">Hamster Sandwich</a> 22:28, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hamster, if it's a dispute between different senses of humour, he's denying it. i.e., "I don't have a problem with your sense of humour or how risque it is." (his words.)</p>
<p>Regarding ignoring someone if they tick you off, I was never ticked off until he came out of nowhere to try and push me around. When asked why he was threatening me he just insults me. He keeps teling me "put a cork in it" or he'll kick me off the channel for no valid reason. In my view, he's on a silly Internet power trip and yes I know that IRC and Wikipedia are different, but I can't reason with the guy in there because he takes offence to everything and anything I say and he's got the button. I haven't taken nonsense from bullies ever and I'm not about to start now, moreso one that's still wet behind the years and barely out of diapers. Of course the whole thing is as empty and goofy as an old banana peel. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarry_Wells_33a7.html" title="User:Barry Wells">Barry Wells</a> 23:38, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Better to let the whole matter dry up like the metaphorical banana peel. Speaking to silsor a few minutes ago on IRC, he seems willing to let the matter go. I think you should as well. Just hate to see you sanctioned, particularly for personal observations regarding other editors. My advice...please keep discussion relating to IRC in IRC. I happen to like the both of you, and see this whole thing completely blown out of proportion. Take the high road, brother. This is only a mutual annoyance between the two of you that has become imflated, by the copious amounts of hot air being generated. Remember, you are a professional journalist (read: Pain in the ass!), and you have the ability to get the goat of anyone who comes into your journalistic gunsight. You can probably get their whole herd of goats if you really try...so try to retain a goatless stance. Ok, I've definately gone into rambleing mode, here, but I want to do what I can to diffuse a potentially rancorous situation. See you 'round Barry!

<dd>Will do. About the Greens... the platform as it stands really seems to shine. I'm impressed (though the devil's in the details, of course). But the thing that bothered me about the Greens of years ago, and still bothers me under Jim Harris of today, are provisions like #40 on the platform. As a general rule, I tend to think that taxes create governmental dependency upon whoever is taxed. So I become quite scared at notions of "shifting taxes" from consumers and onto polluters in any long-term sense, because then we'll be changing our whole social structure to be dependent upon pollution (!). It's not a prudent policy imho. We've got to think in the "Longer Now".</dd>
<dd>I don't want to be a sop, but I have to mention that my fellow NDP goons are proud of their Green policy. So I don't think the new kid Green is the only one living on the block. But I take the party seriously, for sure.

<p>Mainly just that the intro needs to be reformatted a bit. Currently it starts out as historical background on baseball in general, with only a parenthetical mention of the team in the fourth paragraph. Basically, if the team is the primary topic of the article, then the first paragraph needs to say what the London Tecumsehs are, and <i>then</i> it can go into the historical background...and if the article's meant to be about the <i>general</i> history of baseball in early Canada rather than one particular team, then it needs to be moved to a general title.

<p>Your edit regarding the JLC that "Not unique -- it is very common for it take years for a demolished property to officially cease to be designated -- the Talbot Inn by no means the first" is 100 per cent incorrect.</p>
<p>The standard procedure for demolishing a designated heritage property is to repeal the designating by-law and to issue a demoltion permit. At the JLC, the City of London did neither. What the City did obtain was a "heritage alteration permit" to demolish the Talbot Inn -- totally contrary to the <i><a href="../../../o/n/t/Ontario_Heritage_Act_304f.html" title="Ontario Heritage Act">Ontario Heritage Act</a></i> and a total abuse of process.</p>
<p>The Talbot Inn remained a designated heritage property in London for approximately 17 months after it was demolished and the building materials trucked to Try Recycling on Highbury Avenue.</p>
<p>According to officials that I spoke with at the <a href="../../../o/n/t/Ontario_Heritage_Foundation_19ba.html" title="Ontario Heritage Foundation">Ontario Heritage Foundation</a> (I did a story on the matter in SCENE magazine, plus I sat on the London advisory Committee on Heritage for three years), it is a first for Ontario and likely Canada. It is also a first for <a href="../../../l/o/n/London%2C_Ontario_c3a0.html" title="London, Ontario">London, Ontario</a>.</p>
<p>I will be editing the article accordingly. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarry_Wells_33a7.html" title="User:Barry Wells">Barry Wells</a> 23:48, 1 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Although I am pleased to know that you take such an interest in heritage matters, and am very happy to discuss such matters with you at length, I am afraid that you are incorrect. I am a lawyer that handles heritage matters on a regular basis. Under the Ontario Heritage Act (an article I wrote, by the way), as it existed prior to the 2005 amendments, a landowner could demolish a designated building 180 days after a municipality refused permission to demolish. Where the municipality was opposed to the demolition, it was incredibly rare for it to repeal the designation by-law prior to the demolition. In fact, it wouldn't make any sense for the municipality to do so, given that the intent of the 180 day period was for the municipality to try and negotiate some level of heritage preservation (if it was able).
<p>And although the statute required the municipality to repeal the by-law after the demolition, it was very common for a municipality to take quite awhile to pass the housekeeping by-law to repeal the earlier designation by-law. It was not rare whatsoever in Ontario, therefore, for a building to technically remain designated for quite some time after the demolition. The only time that it was standard practice for a municipality to repeal the designation by-law prior to demolition was where the municipality approved the demolition.</p>
<p>Under the Act currently, a landowner must apply to the Ontario Municipal Board to demolish a building where the municipality refuses a permit to demolish. Presumably, where the Board grants permission to demolish, in the face of municipal opposition, the designating by-law will still end up usually being repealed post-demolition, depending on how quickly a landowner acts on the Board order. I can only speculate, as the first appeals under these new provisions are still working their way through the system.</p>
<p>The City of London may have demolished the Inn contrary to the provisions of the Act. That does not change the fact that the fact that it was not unusual for the City to take 17 months to repeal the designation by-law. There may have been many matters unique to the demolition of the Inn, but this was not one of them.</p>
<p>And although the Foundation is established pursuant to a section of the Ontario Heritage Act, it does not administer the municipal designation provisions in section 29 or the alteration/demolition provisions in sections 33 and 34 of the statute.</p>
<p>So unless I have completely misunderstood what you are attempting to convey by the phrase "a first in Ontario's history and perhaps Canada's, according to officials with the Ontario Heritage Foundation", I'd have to say on its plain reading that it is wrong at law. I have amended the article accordingly. <a href="../../../s/k/e/User%7ESkeezix1000_63e3.html" title="User:Skeezix1000">Skeezix1000</a> 03:34, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>I saw your contributions over at the Marc Emery article, and thought you might be a good person to talk to about this.</p>
<p>I've started a Marijuana wiki (aka The Sticky Wiki) which I think you might be interested in. I'm hoping you can help me get started with this project. Whereas lots of articles about weed get speedy-deleted on Wikipedia, they would be totally cool over at MarijuanaWiki. But really I want the site to be more of a marijuana community than merely an encyclopedia.</p>
<p>To give you an example, I want to have city guides about where to score, find pot-friendly cafes, marijuana events, and what represents a good price in that city. Etc. (You can check out the featured article: "Toronto" to see what I mean). I also want to have grow diaries and marijuana blogs. All in all, basically more communal than encyclopedic.</p>
<p>I am in need of admins/moderators, and people experienced with MediaWiki to help build policy, categories, and templates, etc. If you'd be interested in helping me with this project, the URL is <a href="http://marijuana.relately.com/" class="external text" title="http://marijuana.relately.com/" rel="nofollow">MarijuanaWiki</a></p>

<p>Thanks Barry. I was the first volunteer for the first three years and set up the archives with Inge. I catalogued the collection and scanned the oldest photographs. The three related articles are in process. They are not finished, I try to do the Wiki about 5-6 hours a week and this past week I had various things to do other than Wikify articles. All will be adjusted and come to completion soon. Thanks for your input, it is appreciated as are your articles in Scene. The WFA seems to be ignoring UWO who was promised the collection for preservation and materials are dissapearing already. I am trying to help save it and the material by putting a record of its worthwhile existance on Wikipedia. <a href="http://wayneray.ca/" class="external autonumber" title="http://wayneray.ca/" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> <a href="http://www3.sympatico.ca/cpa" class="external autonumber" title="http://www3.sympatico.ca/cpa" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> cpa@sympatico.ca <a href="../../../w/a/y/User%7EWayneRay_bb81.html" title="User:WayneRay">WayneRay</a> 20:50, 15 May 2006 (UTC)WayneRay</p>

<p>I saw you in the 'Freeps the other day. I hope you'll be attending Anne Marie's upcoming nupulations! Perhaps as "Best Man", or "Keeper of Her Wursh-ships Quilt Warmer" or some such thing as befits your station within the realm...</p>
<p>I keep trying to get down to the ol' Labatt Park, but too many things going on at the moment. Regarding <a href="../../../s/a/l/User%7ESalix_alba_9f89.html" title="User:Salix alba">Salix alba's</a> post on my page, I think I tried to respond at that time but somehow didn't complete the save to the discussion page I was directed too. I don't think it really important enough to give an opinion about at this point, suffice to say that user pages are an important introduction to the individual wikipedian's who participate in the project. While not Myspace.com, the WP user page should offer some glimpse of the users here, some way of connecting with the real persons involved. Well Barry, I'll be looking for you in the funny papers and hope to buy you a dog and a pop sometime soon.

<p>If you can point me towards a site which has public domain images I can sort those out for you.</p>
<p>If it's a photograph you took, you hold the copyright, so can license it (under GFDL or PD as you see fit). Just press "Upload file" (on the left, below the search bar, in the "toolbox" - between "E-mail this user" and "Special pages"), click on "Browse" next to "Source filename" then find the file you want on your PC (I'm presuming you have a digital camera or scanned images). Under "Destination filename" type something meaningul like "Labatt Park in 2004.jpg" or suchlike, then under "licensing" pick "GFDL (self-made)" or "You created this work yourself and release it to the public domain" (as you see fit) then press "Upload file". That ought to work just fine. Hope this helps, <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheGrappler_4371.html" title="User:TheGrappler">TheGrappler</a> 23:20, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I can upload the Norm Aldridge photo as soon as you tell me which copyright license you want to use. The preferred license for Commons pictures is multi-licensed into GFDL (the license used for Wikipedia) and Creative Commons 2.5 (a less restrictive license that is very useful for photographs: it allows people to reprint the image with a small copyright notice, while GFDL requires a large one). You would retain the right to have the image attributed to you, but commercial organizations would be allowed to profit from it for free (exactly the same situation as with your other contributions to Wikipedia). Am I safe to assume you'll release your images under the GFDL/Creative Commons 2.5 multilicense? <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheGrappler_4371.html" title="User:TheGrappler">TheGrappler</a> 09:02, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Excellent, sometimes people can be a little zealous if they find an image duplicated anywhere else on the web, so that message should keep this well and truly safe. He certainly does appear to be something of a character! It may be hard to see who nominated the article as a GA, but you can try checking the "history" tab of the talk page and see if you can spot the revision that included the GA nomination for the first time - that would tell you who nominated it.

<p>The problem is that "public policy analyst" isn't a real category -- it's just something KA made up during his first trip through the article.</p>
<p>As to "Ontario politicians", KA did organizational work for the PCs in the 1990s and later helped create a breakaway organization. He also ran for office.

<p>Hi Barry</p>
<p>My name is Becky Pope and myself and my partner Brad Wolfe are doing a project on Labatt Park and the reasons behind why it has been able to sustain itself as "The oldest ballpark in North America". The project is for our Canadian Sport History class at Wilfrid Laurier University. Both Brad and I are originally from the London area and are huge baseball fans. We have been able to find some good information about the park from both the Weldon Library and the London Room at the London Public Library. We have also come across information on your organization "Friends of Labatt Park". We feel that your organization has played a significant role in saving and maintaining Labatt Park. If it is possible we would love to meet with you and discuss your organization as well as Labatt Park. If you could email me back at your earliest convenience at <b>pope5010@wlu.ca</b> it would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for taking the time to read my email.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>Hello Barry, I was wondering whether you had any information as to whether Mrs. Dianne Haskett was still a member of the Metropolitan United Church. Your recent edit to her article seemed to suggest that she had left the church. If you have any information as to where she is currently worshipping, feel free to add it to the article. <a href="../../../h/o/m/User%7EHomagetocatalonia_4ee6.html" title="User:Homagetocatalonia">Homagetocatalonia</a> 00:42, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
