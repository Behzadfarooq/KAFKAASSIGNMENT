<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/r/Bart_Conner_330c.html" title="Edit section: Early career">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Early career</span></h2>
<p>Conner, who participated in many sports as a child, started gymnastics at the age of ten, after a school <a href="../../../p/h/y/Physical_education.html" title="Physical education">physical education</a> coach noticed his talent. He began training with the <a href="../../../n/i/l/Niles_West_High_School_d1f5.html" title="Niles West High School">Niles West High School</a> team and competing in local meets, where he progressed quickly but seldom won; after a few years he also began training at the local <a href="../../../y/m/c/YMCA_8c40.html" title="YMCA">YMCA</a> and competing in YMCA events. Conner's first significant gymnastics victory was the <a href="../../../a/m/a/Amateur_Athletic_Union_d59d.html" title="Amateur Athletic Union">AAU</a> Junior Olympics, where he won in 1972, followed soon after in 1974 by the USGF Junior National Championships. Immediately following his high school graduation in 1976, he went on to join the United States team as its youngest member at the <a href="../../../1/9/7/1976_Summer_Olympics_81ce.html" title="1976 Summer Olympics">1976 Summer Olympics</a> in <a href="../../../m/o/n/Montreal.html" title="Montreal">Montreal</a>.</p>
<p>Conner attended the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Oklahoma_0676.html" title="University of Oklahoma">University of Oklahoma</a> in order to work with coach Paul Ziert on the gymnastics team, which was then ranked 19th nationally by the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Collegiate_Athletic_Association_2404.html" title="National Collegiate Athletic Association">NCAA</a>. Conner is relatively unsuited physically for gymnastics, according to Ziert, for his relative lack of spinal flexibility as well as his weakness in tumbling skills. However, Ziert continues, Conner's motivation and dedication to the sport combined with his other physical abilities helped him quickly advance to the world-class level. In 1979, he won the parallel bars event at the <a href="../../../1/9/7/1979_World_Artistic_Gymnastics_Championships_0baf.html" title="1979 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships">World Championships</a> with an original move called the "Conner Spin." In this move, the gymnast performs a complete 360-degree turn on one bar in a straddled position, and then presses to a handstand.</p>
<p>Much of Conner's early career was seen as a rivalry between himself and fellow American <a href="../../../k/u/r/Kurt_Thomas_%28gymnast%29_7c56.html" title="Kurt Thomas (gymnast)">Kurt Thomas</a>, both of whom were top competitors but whose styles of competition were quite different. Thomas, a more physically gifted gymnast than Conner, impressed judges with his explosive strength and unusual degree of difficulty in his routines, whereas Conner's strengths were in his solid consistency and artistic presentation. The media made much of this rivalry, with Conner and Thomas competing for the top spots in national competition, and though the two were good friends the publicity around their rivalry and media exaggeration incited ill feeling between the two for a time.</p>
<p>He was the first qualifier for the 1980 Olympic gymnastics team, and did not support the US boycott of the Games; he made several media appearances in which he described the boycott as "futile", and protested the Olympics being used for political purposes. However, due to a torn <a href="../../../b/i/c/Biceps.html" title="Biceps">biceps</a> he received during the Olympic Trials, it is unlikely he would have performed well; due to continued training after this injury, his recovery lasted well over a year. In December 1983, competing at the Chunichi Cup, Conner tore his left biceps during his rings routine; due to several bone chips floating around his elbow, his arm mobility was limited, which placed undue stress on the muscles of the upper arm during the strenuous activities of competitive gymnastics.</p>

<p>After surgery and intensive physical therapy, Conner squeaked onto the 1984 Olympic team, after competing in only one of the two qualifying events, the Olympic Trials. He had begun competing in the earlier National Championships, but several serious falters including a headfirst landing on the floor exercise made it clear that he had not yet made a full recovery. Conner was granted a petition by the USGF to consider only the Trials scores, with which he was selected for the team.</p>
<p>After intense training to return to the level of competition he had reached before his injury, Conner's consistently good scores (including a perfect 10 on the parallel bars) helped the US men's team earn its first team gold. Conner took sixth place in the individual all-around competition, with his total separated from gold medalist Koji Gushiken by .35 in total.</p>
<p>He qualified for two individual event finals, on floor exercise and parallel bars. He had a lackluster floor exercise, scoring a 9.75 for fifth place. In the parallel bars final just hours later, however, he scored a perfect 10 to win the event.</p>
<p>Former rival Kurt Thomas, who had retired from gymnastics, was a commentator for <a href="../../../a/b/c/ABC_Sports_4ad3.html" title="ABC Sports">ABC Sports</a>; coach Paul Ziert saw his assessments of Conner's performance as being more fair and accurate than any others'.</p>

They currently own the Bart Conner Gymnastics Academy, Perfect 10 Production Company and several sports equipment shops, and are editors of <i>International Gymnast</i> magazine; they also do charity work. Conner is also a gymnastics commentator, and accepts speaking engagements.</p>
<p>Bart became a father when Nadia gave birth to their first child, a little boy named Dylan Paul Conner via <a href="../../../c/-/s/C-section.html" title="C-section">c-section</a> on the morning of <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_3.html" title="June 3">June 3</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> in <a href="../../../o/k/l/Oklahoma_City_ee0e.html" title="Oklahoma City">Oklahoma City</a>, <a href="../../../o/k/l/Oklahoma.html" title="Oklahoma">Oklahoma</a>.

However, Dylan left the hospital after a short stay and immediately thrived.</p>
