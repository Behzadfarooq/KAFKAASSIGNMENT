	    <p><b>Barnaby Bernard Lintot</b> ("Lintott" before 1724, usually referred to as "Bernard" and very rarely as "Barnaby") (<a href="../../../d/e/c/December_1.html" title="December 1">December 1</a>, <a href="../../../1/6/7/1675.html" title="1675">1675</a> - <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_9.html" title="February 9">February 9</a>, <a href="../../../1/7/3/1736.html" title="1736">1736</a>), <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">English</a> publisher, was born at <a href="../../../s/o/u/Southwater.html" title="Southwater">Southwater</a>, <a href="../../../s/u/s/Sussex.html" title="Sussex">Sussex</a>, and started business as a publisher in London about 1698. He was apprenticed to a bookseller in 1690 and was not officially freed of his contract until 1700, but he began selling books independently at the sign of the Cross Keys in St. Martin's Lane before that, and six <a href="../../../p/l/a/Play.html" title="Play">plays</a> appeared with his imprint in 1698.</p>
<p>By concentrating his stock primarily on literary authors, Lintot was a rival of <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jacob_Tonson_93bd.html" title="Jacob Tonson">Jacob Tonson</a>'s. In 1700, he married Catherine Langley, a widow, and moved his shop to <a href="../../../f/l/e/Fleet_Street_fda1.html" title="Fleet Street">Fleet Street</a> at the Post House. In <a href="../../../1/7/0/1705.html" title="1705">1705</a>, he moved his shop again, to its most permanent location, at the Cross Keys on Fleet Street, next to Nandy's Coffee House and right by <a href="../../../t/e/m/Temple_Bar_418d.html" title="Temple Bar">Temple Bar</a>. From <a href="../../../1/7/0/1705.html" title="1705">1705</a> to <a href="../../../1/7/1/1712.html" title="1712">1712</a>, he published all the plays put on at <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theatre_Royal%2C_Drury_Lane_c64b.html" title="Theatre Royal, Drury Lane">Theatre Royal, Drury Lane</a>, and he was one of the leading publishers of literary authors, including the dramas of <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Farquhar_37b8.html" title="George Farquhar">George Farquhar</a>, <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Dryden_c542.html" title="John Dryden">John Dryden</a>, <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Congreve_425f.html" title="William Congreve">William Congreve</a>, <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Steele_4c94.html" title="Richard Steele">Richard Steele</a>, <a href="../../../s/u/s/Susanna_Centlivre_403b.html" title="Susanna Centlivre">Susanna Centlivre</a>, and <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colley_Cibber_0789.html" title="Colley Cibber">Colley Cibber</a>.</p>
<p>In 1712, Lintott attempted to set up his own <i>Miscellany</i> series to counter Tonson's <i>Poetical Miscellanies,</i> which had been edited by Dryden, and so he got <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_Pope_8096.html" title="Alexander Pope">Alexander Pope</a> to assemble <i>Miscellaneous Poems and Translations.</i> This volume contained the first version of Pope's <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Rape_of_the_Lock_b78a.html" title="The Rape of the Lock">The Rape of the Lock</a>.</i> Pope became a friend and author for Lintott, and many of Pope's friends began to sell their works to Lintott as well. <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Gay_27bf.html" title="John Gay">John Gay</a> and <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nicholas_Rowe_%28dramatist%29_1be4.html" title="Nicholas Rowe (dramatist)">Nicholas Rowe</a>, in particular, became clients of Lintott's, and Lintott published Pope's <i>Works</i> of 1717, Gay's <i>Poems on Several Occasions</i> in 1720, and Rowe's <i>Works</i> in 1728. Despite the early rivalry, in 1718, Lintott made an arrangement with Jacob Tonson that the two publishers would share in any future plays either house printed, and throughout his career Lintott established multiple publishing agreements with his rivals.</p>
<p>As a publisher, Lintott focused on works of literature, but he also published legal guides, the <a href="../../../l/i/t/Literary_criticism.html" title="Literary criticism">literary criticism</a> of <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Dennis_9400.html" title="John Dennis">John Dennis</a>, and the philosophical works of noted <a href="../../../d/e/i/Deism.html" title="Deism">deists</a>. He also increased the pay that he gave to authors who had proven successful and occasionally speculated on contemporary furores. He paid, for example, £105 to Colley Cibber for <i>The Nonjuror</i> and over £100 to John Gay for <i>Poems on Several Occasions</i> (after offering only £35 for <i>Trivia</i>). However, he also paid £130 to <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Moore_Smythe_73dc.html" title="James Moore Smythe">James Moore Smythe</a> for <i>The Rival Modes,</i> primarily because of the disagreement Smythe had had with Pope.</p>
<p>Lintott was the first to publish a catalogue of his holdings in 1714, with <i>The Monthly Catalogue.</i> He also, according to Pope, performed an early version of <a href="../../../p/e/e/Peer_review.html" title="Peer review">peer review</a>. When he had a translation that he had purchased, he would send it out to "gentlemen" to assess its accuracy before he published it. From 1714 to 1727, he was one of the primary printers to the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_House_of_Commons_bbac.html" title="British House of Commons">House of Commons</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/7/2/1725.html" title="1725">1725</a>, Pope and Lintot had a significant and complex quarrel. Lintott had paid Pope £2,201 for his translation of <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homer.html" title="Homer">Homer</a>'s <i><a href="../../../i/l/i/Iliad.html" title="Iliad">Iliad</a>.</i> Because of piracy and miscalculations, Lintott had not recouped the profit he anticipated. Thus, when Pope came to publish his translation of <i><a href="../../../o/d/y/Odyssey.html" title="Odyssey">Odyssey</a></i>, Lintot was in no mood to offer the same terms. Pope therefore went to Jacob Tonson. He offered to do an edition of <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Shakespeare_c1d2.html" title="William Shakespeare">Shakespeare</a> for only £100 if Tonson would offer very good terms on <i>Odyssey.</i> Tonson, however, had arrangements with Lintot and declined to offer a better deal, and so Pope received only £337 from Lintot for the translation. Tonson, for his part, went ahead and advertised the new Shakespeare edition by Pope, and this infuriated Lintot, who complained in print. Pope quit Lintot at that point.</p>
<p>In 1725-1727, Pope referred to Lintot twice in his works. In the <i>Narrative of Dr. Norris,</i> Lintot is satirized lightly, and in the <i>Full and True Account</i> of the "poisoning" of <a href="../../../e/d/m/Edmund_Curll_6da5.html" title="Edmund Curll">Edmund Curll</a> he is struck a bit more directly. However, in <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Dunciad_5549.html" title="The Dunciad">The Dunciad</a>,</i> Pope took full revenge. Lintot is satirized several places in the poem. He is, first, given a memorable description as a "dabchick" flopping through bedpan slops (Lintot was a very large and clumsy man, according to contemporaries, with a tendency to "sputter" and to resort to exasperated profanity):</p>
<dl>
<dd>"As when a dab-chick waddles thro' the copse,</dd>
<dd>On feet and wings, and flies, and wades, and hops;</dd>
<dd>So lab'ring on, with shoulders, hands, and head,</dd>
<dd>Wide as a windmill all his figure spread . . .</dd>
<dd>Full in the middle way there stood a lake,</dd>
<dd>Which Curl's Corinna chanc'd that morn to make,</dd>
<dd>(Such was her wont, at early down to drop</dd>
<dd>Her evening cates before his neighbour's shop,)</dd>
<dd>Here fortun'd Curl to slide; loud shout the band,</dd>
<dd>And Bernard! Bernard! rings thro' all the Strand." (II 59-70)</dd>
</dl>
<p>He is next satirized for being foolish enough to chase after the "Phantom More" (James Moore Smythe) and for winning the company and writings of the "Juno of majestic size" <a href="../../../e/l/i/Eliza_Haywood_a322.html" title="Eliza Haywood">Eliza Haywood</a>.</p>
<p>Lintot went into semi-retirement in 1730. From that point on, his son, Henry Lintot, ran the publishing business with him, and Lintot moved out to Sussex. During his career, Bernard purchased lands adjoining his father's lands every time he had occasion, and so he had moderate estates by the time he gave his son a role in the business. In 1735, he was nominated as high <a href="../../../s/h/e/Sheriff.html" title="Sheriff">sheriff</a> of Sussex, but he died of "an asthma" in February of 1736.</p>
