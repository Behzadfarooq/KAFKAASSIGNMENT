<p><a href="../../../b/a/r/Barbie.html" title="Barbie">Barbie</a> stars as a beautiful princess named Genevieve with eleven sisters, Ashlyn, Blair, Courtney, Delia, Edeline, Fallon, Hadley, Isla, Janessa, Kathleen and Lacey, who all love to dance. Along with their own personal likes and interests, all twelve love to dance and live in a beautiful castle with their widowed father, King Randolph.</p>
<p>Disheartened by his daughter's unladylike behavior and his inability to understand them, the King summons his cousin, Duchess Rowena to help him with their upbringing. Rowena strips the castle of all fun: no color, singing, playing, and no dancing. She forces the princesses to practice "proper" behavior, such as fanning. Disappointed with the changes, the princesses find that their mother's favorite story book, which recounts a tale of a magic land where a princess could dance for three nights, is actually true. The entrance to this magic land is in their bedchamber, on twelve tiles, each having each princess's favorite flower on it, and matching each storybook for the girls, to open the doorway they have to dance from stone to stone, oldest to youngest, and on the last stone, they must twirl 3 times. In the magic land any wish is granted by flowers that sprinkle gold dust and the princesses dance the night away. Lacey, the youngest princess, hurts her knee and discovers that water from the fountain heals the wound instantly.</p>
<p>The next day the royal cobbler and love interest of Princess Genevieve, Derek arrives to find that they have worn their new dancing shoes out in a single night and that they are covered with gold dust. The duchess continues to deprive them of any enjoyment and prevents them singing for their father, who has fallen ill. The doctor gives Rowena medicine for the king, of which she promptly disposes, so she can poison the king. That night, the princesses danced throughout the night.</p>
<p>The next day, the princesses are still exhausted, and the duchess demands to know why. Lacey tells her the truth, which upsets the duchess in disbelief. The princesses return again to their magic land after being locked into their bedroom. Derek returns, having discovered that Rowena is stealing from the king and dealing with an apothecary or pharmacist (presumably for the poison). Using the pattern of Genevieve's dancing, Derek enters the magic land and reports his findings.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Genevieve's talking pet, a kitten, fights with Rowena's talking pet, a monkey. The monkey determines the pattern for opening the gateway. Soon Rowena enters the magic land and discovers the ability for wishes to come true. She removes a flower that sprinkles gold dust that grants wishes and returns with it. Then her henchman destroys the stone pattern that forms the gateway.</p>
<p>Trapped in the magic land Genevieve wishes to know the way out and they find that the same pattern that led them in will let them out. Soon Genevieve discovers that alone she can no longer open the gateway. Only by dancing with Derek, Genevieve can open the gateway to return to their land, returning this time to their mother's dance pavillion, which surprisingly looks alike to the pavillion in the magic land.</p>
<p>Genevieve discovers that the king has been tricked into proclaiming Rowena acting queen until he recovers, but Rowena has poisoned him (presumably to death) and sent guards to capture any stray princesses. Using their diverse talents the princesses distract or disable the guards and enter the palace to confront Rowena. Lacey ignores Genevieve's instructions and enters the palace to give Genevieve the magic water in her vial and is seized by Rowena's henchmen.</p>
<p>Derek and Genevieve defeat the magically summoned suits of armor that defend Rowena but discover that Rowena has the upper hand when the henchman drags in Lacey. Noting that Genevieve is the source of most of her sister's resistance, Rowena wishes that Genevieve would dance forever and ever, but when the golden flowers spew dust Genevieve produces her fan and fans the dust onto Rowena, whose henchman joins her in dancing. The two villains then dance their way out of the castle and out of the movie.</p>
<p>It is revealed that Lacey saved some of the water from the magic land, and using it, Lacey revives the king, who explains that Rowena was poisoning him. Genevieve and Derek wed and the King remarks that this is truly a remarkable day, as Genevieve is finally on time for something (her wedding).</p>

<p>The names of the 12 princesses start with the first 12 letters of the alphabet; for example, A for Ashlyn, B for Blair, etc. Each Princess has an associated flower - the flowers that appear on the books and the stones are on their dresses. On Ashlyn-Genevieve, it is just below the neckline of their dresses. On the twins, it is off to the side. On the triplets, it's located on the sash in the middle where the dress meets the upper part. (Much like a belt buckle.)</p>
