<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/r/Barclay_College_d11a.html" title="Edit section: Barclay College">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Barclay College</span></h3>
<p>Barclay College traces its beginnings to 1917, when evangelist and teacher, Scott T. Clark, founded the Kansas Central Bible Training School on the site of a Friends academy for Quaker high school youth in Haviland, Kansas. Born out of a desire for a strong evangelistic emphasis, the college immediately became a center for the training and preparation of pastors and missionaries.</p>
<p>In 1925, a two-year junior college course was added, and the name was changed in 1930 to Friends Bible College to more fully reflect the growing mission of the institution. By 1968, supporters felt the purposes of the college would best be served by emphasizing the four-year institution. They consequently closed the academy and junior-college programs and embarked on a vigorous effort to secure necessary faculty and facilities. This effort resulted in widespread support from the community and the college constituency and received general recognition in 1975 with the granting of full accreditation by the American Association of Bible Colleges (now the Accrediting Association of Bible Colleges).</p>
<p>In the Spring of 1990, the college adopted its current name in honor of the first Quaker theologian, Robert Barclay. For a more detailed description of Barclay's rich history, contact the college to receive a copy of "Lighthouse on the Prairie", written by Haviland resident and former president Sheldon Jackson.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/r/Barclay_College_d11a.html" title="Edit section: History">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h3>
<p>Haviland Kansas was founded in 1884, when a group of Quaker families from Indiana were migrating west. Their naming of the city came from Laura Smith Haviland, a Quaker woman who was a pioneer social activist and devoted her life to others. Laura Haviland is most known for being very involved in the anti-slavery movement, serving as Superintendent and Stationmaster on the Underground Railroad. Following the Civil War, she became an officer in the Freedman’s Aid Society, assisting in the relocation and adjustment of former slaves in Kansas which probably was the signinficant connection involved in the naming of this Kansas settlement.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/r/Barclay_College_d11a.html" title="Edit section: Atmosphere">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Atmosphere</span></h3>
<p>Presently, the city consists of approximately 624 residents and streatches about one to two square miles. The town is mostly surrounded by open fields and farm lands with the nearest town twenty miles to the west being Greensburg, and twenty-five miles to the east being Pratt.</p>
<p>Within the downtown area there are many businesses from an insurance company, bank, phone company, an autobody repair shop, a baraber shop, and a few others. Many of the more suburban ammenities are found in Greensburg and Pratt. There are also two churches within the city, The Haviland Friends Church and Haviland United Methodist Church.</p>
<p>It is fairly obvious that the "small-town" feel is inescapable in the town of Haviland, but with many of the everyday necessities within Haviland, and everything else within a twenty to thirty minute drive, Haviland is a quieter and more peaceful alternative to many of American's modern-day suburbanized towns and villages.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/r/Barclay_College_d11a.html" title="Edit section: Student Life">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Student Life</span></h2>
<p>Barclay College recognizes that students are people who have many needs and joys in addition to their academic life. Believing that God wants to teach us and love us in every phase of our lives, Barclay College has developed an extensive student life program. The ultimate goal is to take the idea that life in the middle of Kansa is boring and turn it around by planning many diverse extra curriculars and cultivating a valuable spiritual atmosphere that encourages growth.</p>

<p>On the Barclay College campus a favorite hang-out spot amongst the students is The Bear's Den. The Bear's Den is housed within the Braodhurst Student Center on the western side of the campus. In side the Bear's Den is basically an area for students to enjoy good food, do homework, or just relax.</p>

<p>Barclay College competes in intercollegiate men's soccer and basketball, and women's volleyball and basketball. The college is a member of the Midwest Christian College Conference (MCCC) including colleges in Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, and Iowa, and the Association of Christian College Athletics (ACCA). The ACCA allows colleges to compete in intercollegiate athletics, but does not permit them to offer 'athletic' scholarships.</p>
