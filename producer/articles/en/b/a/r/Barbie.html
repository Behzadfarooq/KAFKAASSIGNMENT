The original 1959 Barbie</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><a href="../../../r/u/t/Ruth_Handler_1883.html" title="Ruth Handler">Ruth Handler</a> watched her daughter Barbara at play with paper dolls, and noticed that she often enjoyed giving them adult roles. At the time, most children's toy dolls were representations of infants. Realizing that there could be a gap in the market, she suggested the idea of an adult-bodied doll to her husband Elliot, a co-founder of the <a href="../../../m/a/t/Mattel.html" title="Mattel">Mattel</a> toy company. He was unenthusiastic about the idea, as were Mattel's directors.</p>
<p>During a trip to <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germany.html" title="Germany">Germany</a> in 1956 with her children Barbara and Kenneth, Ruth Handler discovered a German doll called the <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bild_Lilli_doll_e628.html" title="Bild Lilli doll">Bild Lilli doll</a> in a shop window. The adult-figured Lilli doll was exactly what Handler had in mind, so she purchased three of them. She gave one to her daughter and took the others back to Mattel. The Lilli doll was based on a popular character appearing in a <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comic_strip.html" title="Comic strip">comic strip</a> drawn by Reinhard Beuthin for the newspaper <i><a href="../../../b/i/l/Bild-Zeitung_bcf2.html" title="Bild-Zeitung">Die Bild-Zeitung</a></i>. Lilli was a working girl who knew what she wanted and was not above using men to get it. The Lilli doll was first sold in Germany in 1955, and although it was initially sold to adults, it became popular with children who enjoyed dressing her up in outfits that were available separately. On her return to the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>, Handler reworked the design of the doll (with help from engineer <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_Ryan_%28designer%29_db1e.html" title="Jack Ryan (designer)">Jack Ryan</a>) and the doll was given a new name, <i>Barbie</i>, after Handler's daughter Barbara. The doll made its debut at the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_International_Toy_Fair_d0f6.html" title="American International Toy Fair">American International Toy Fair</a> in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_3da4.html" title="New York">New York</a> on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_9.html" title="March 9">March 9</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/5/1959.html" title="1959">1959</a>. This date is also used as Barbie's official <a href="../../../b/i/r/Birthday.html" title="Birthday">birthday</a>. Mattel acquired the rights to the <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bild_Lilli_doll_e628.html" title="Bild Lilli doll">Bild Lilli doll</a> in 1964 and production of Lilli was stopped. The first Barbie doll wore a black and white zebra striped swimsuit and signature topknot <a href="../../../p/o/n/Ponytail.html" title="Ponytail">ponytail</a>, and was available as either a <a href="../../../b/l/o/Blonde.html" title="Blonde">blonde</a> or <a href="../../../b/r/u/Brunette.html" title="Brunette">brunette</a>. The doll was marketed as a "Teen-age Fashion Model", with her clothes created by Mattel fashion designer Charlotte Johnson. Around 350,000 Barbie dolls were sold during the first year of production. Barbie's appearance has been changed many times, most notably in 1971 when the doll's eyes were adjusted to look forwards rather than sideways. Barbie was one of the first <a href="../../../t/o/y/Toy.html" title="Toy">toys</a> to have a marketing strategy based extensively on <a href="../../../t/e/l/Television.html" title="Television">television</a> <a href="../../../a/d/v/Advertising.html" title="Advertising">advertising</a>, which has been widely copied by other toys. It is estimated that over a billion Barbie dolls have been sold worldwide in over 150 countries, with Mattel claiming that three Barbie dolls are sold every second. <sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Barbie products include not only the range of dolls with their clothes and accessories, but also a huge range of Barbie branded goods such as books, fashion items and <a href="../../../v/i/d/Video_game.html" title="Video game">video games</a>. Barbie has appeared in a series of animated films and makes a brief guest appearance in the 1999 film <i><a href="../../../t/o/y/Toy_Story_2_3a0a.html" title="Toy Story 2">Toy Story 2</a></i>. Almost uniquely for a toy fashion doll, Barbie has become a <a href="../../../c/u/l/Cultural_icon.html" title="Cultural icon">cultural icon</a> and has been given honors that are rare in the toy world.

<p>Barbie's full name is <b>Barbara Millicent Roberts</b>. According to the <a href="../../../r/a/n/Random_House_0f9b.html" title="Random House">Random House</a> novels of the 1960s, her parents' names are George and Margaret Roberts of Willows, <a href="../../../w/i/s/Wisconsin.html" title="Wisconsin">Wisconsin</a>.

Barbie has an on-off romantic relationship with her beau <a href="../../../k/e/n/Ken_%28toy_doll%29.html" title="Ken (toy doll)">Ken</a> (<b>Ken Carson</b>), who appeared in 1961. Like Barbie, Ken shares his name with one of Ruth Handler's children. Mattel announced in February 2004 that Barbie and Ken had split up, but in February 2006 they were back together again. <sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup> <sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>Barbie has had over forty <a href="../../../p/e/t/Pet.html" title="Pet">pets</a> including cats and dogs, horses, a panda, a lion cub, and a zebra. She has owned pink <a href="../../../c/o/n/Convertibles.html" title="Convertibles">convertibles</a>, trailers, <a href="../../../j/e/e/Jeeps.html" title="Jeeps">jeeps</a> and more.

<p>Barbie's popularity ensures that her effect on the play of Western children attracts a high degree of scrutiny. The criticisms leveled at her are often based on the assumption that children consider Barbie a role model and will attempt to emulate her.</p>
<ul>
<li>In September 2003 the <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middle_East_c1c7.html" title="Middle East">Middle Eastern</a> country of <a href="../../../s/a/u/Saudi_Arabia_53d2.html" title="Saudi Arabia">Saudi Arabia</a> outlawed the sale of Barbie dolls, saying that she did not conform to the ideals of <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam.html" title="Islam">Islam</a>. The <a href="../../../c/o/m/Committee_for_the_Propagation_of_Virtue_and_Prevention_of_Vice_11ce.html" title="Committee for the Propagation of Virtue and Prevention of Vice">Committee for the Propagation of Virtue and Prevention of Vice</a> stated "<a href="../../../i/s/r/Israel.html" title="Israel">Jewish</a> Barbie dolls, with their revealing clothes and shameful postures, accessories and tools are a symbol of decadence to the perverted West. Let us beware of her dangers and be careful."<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[8]</a></sup> In Middle Eastern countries there is an alternative doll called <a href="../../../f/u/l/Fulla_%28doll%29.html" title="Fulla (doll)">Fulla</a> who is similar to Barbie but is designed to be more acceptable to an Islamic market. Fulla is not made by the Mattel Corporation.

<li>The word <i>Barbie</i> has come to be used as a <a href="../../../d/e/r/Derogatory.html" title="Derogatory">derogatory</a> <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slang.html" title="Slang">slang</a> term for a <a href="../../../g/i/r/Girl.html" title="Girl">girl</a> or <a href="../../../w/o/m/Woman.html" title="Woman">woman</a> who is considered stupid, most famously in the song <i><a href="../../../b/a/r/Barbie_Girl_c50f.html" title="Barbie Girl">Barbie Girl</a></i>. In 1992 Mattel released <i>Teen Talk Barbie</i>, which spoke a number of phrases including "Will we ever have enough clothes?", "I love shopping!", and "Wanna have a <a href="../../../p/i/z/Pizza.html" title="Pizza">pizza</a> party?" Each doll was programmed to say four out of 270 possible phrases, so that no two dolls were likely to be the same. One of these 270 phrases was "<a href="../../../m/a/t/Mathematics.html" title="Mathematics">Math</a> class is tough!" Although only about 1.5% of all the dolls sold said the phrase, it caused a public outcry.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[10]</a></sup></li>

<ul>
<li>One of the most common criticisms of Barbie is that she promotes an unrealistic idea of body image for a woman, leading to a risk that women who attempt to emulate her will become <a href="../../../a/n/o/Anorexia_nervosa.html" title="Anorexia nervosa">anorexic</a>. Critics have argued that for a woman to have Barbie's body, she would need to be 7 feet 2 inches tall, weigh 115-130 pounds, have 30 to 36 inch hips, an 18 to 23 inch waist and a 38 to 48 inch bust. Additionally, she would lack the 17 to 22 percent body fat required for a woman to <a href="../../../m/e/n/Menstruate.html" title="Menstruate">menstruate</a>. In 1997 Barbie was redesigned and given a wider waist, with Mattel saying that this would make the doll better suited to contemporary fashion designs. A standard Barbie doll is 11.5 inches tall, giving a height of 5 feet 9 inches at 1/6 scale. <sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[11]</a></sup></li>

As had become the custom, Mattel manufactured both a <a href="../../../w/h/i/White_people.html" title="White people">white</a> and a <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_people.html" title="Black people">black</a> version. Critics argued that in the <a href="../../../a/f/r/African_American_5c73.html" title="African American">African American</a> community <i>Oreo</i> is a derogatory term for a person like the chocolate sandwich cookie itself, meaning that the person is black on the outside and white on the inside. The doll was unsuccessful and Mattel recalled the unsold stock, making it sought after by collectors.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[14]</a></sup></li>

<li>In May 1997 Mattel introduced <i>Share a Smile Becky</i>, a doll in a pink wheelchair.

<li>In March 2000 stories appeared in the media claiming that the hard <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polyvinyl_chloride.html" title="Polyvinyl chloride">vinyl</a> used in vintage Barbie dolls could leak toxic chemicals, causing danger to children playing with them. The claim was rejected as false by technical experts. A modern Barbie doll has a body made from <a href="../../../a/c/r/Acrylonitrile_butadiene_styrene.html" title="Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene">ABS</a> plastic, while the head is made from soft <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polyvinyl_chloride.html" title="Polyvinyl chloride">PVC</a>. <sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[17]</a></sup></li>

<p>Mattel estimates that there are well over 100,000 avid Barbie collectors. Ninety percent are women, at an average age of 40, purchasing more than twenty Barbie dolls each year.
