<dd>In regards to GRider's User:GRider/Schoolwatch page, I have been warily watching his arbitration case. I have no association with him other than a common school-inclusionist viewpoint. Now that the case has been decided against him and he promptly broke the rules of his arbitration, I think that it's rather pointless to continue using his userspace, since he won't be able to edit any page having to do with deletion for a year. I like the new Wikipedia:Watch/schoolwatch; all it began as was a copy of listings from GRider's page. I've been keeping both up to date, but I agree that it won't do me any good to edit a page in a banned user's space. Thank you for your comments. --BaronLarf 19:22, Apr 11, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I disagree, <a href="../../../w/a/t/Wikipedia%7EWatch_schoolwatch_4cc0.html" title="Wikipedia:Watch/schoolwatch">Wikipedia:Watch/schoolwatch</a> isn't really about school inclusionism. GRider's page is. By the time the arbitrarion proceding got moving, Grider had stopped his objectionable behavior.

<li>While I do have some misgivings about the severity of the punishment imposed, it does appear that he broke the rules and continues to not show respect for the system. I think it makes the school-inclusionist movement, if you will, look bad if we are organized around a page on his user space. If you wish to keep updating his page, go for it.

<p>Hi BaronLarf! Recently I've taken to categorizing schools by the century they were established, i.e. <b>"[[Category:Schools established in the 1800s]]"</b>. Would you agree that this might be helpful to a potential researcher? Also, the category name as it stands is a bit wordy, do you have any suggestions for something less verbose? Cheers --GRider\<sup><a href="../../../g/r/i/User_talk%7EGRider_a2d7.html" title="User talk:GRider">talk</a></sup> 23:59, 19 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Hey GRider, welcome back. Yeah, I noticed the new categories. I can't say that I have a huge amount of enthusiasm for it; the vast majority of schools are going to be in the 1900s category, and the categorization doesn't, in my opinion, add some new dimension to the school categorized. I don't know of any other institution categorized this way, and institutions founded in one century versus another aren't that different. It's not the same as categorizing works of art, music or literature by century, where when they were created really makes a difference in their make-up, in my opinion.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I think that what really needs to be done is a revitalization of the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Schools_9658.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Schools">Wikipedia:WikiProject Schools</a>, where you, I and other school-inclusionists could discuss what we need to do to make school articles better.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>What is your reasoning behind the new categories? Maybe if I understood them better I could support them more. Thanks for the message. --<a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaronLarf_c8b8.html" title="User:BaronLarf">BaronLarf</a> 00:29, Apr 20, 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>This effort was initiated as a form of cross-categorization, not "pointless sub-categorization" as someone recently put it. My reasoning is that this could be very useful to a researcher looking for schools which began in any given century. Given that the vast majority of school articles are bound to be created in the 1900s, it may be best to sort those out by decade rather than century, but it is an interesting way to look at schools much like how we have songs and movie titles by year on Wikipedia. Can you think of any additional potential benefit this may provide to a researcher? --GRider\<sup><a href="../../../g/r/i/User_talk%7EGRider_a2d7.html" title="User talk:GRider">talk</a></sup> 16:19, 20 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi there! You asked this on a school deletion discussion, <i>"With no consensus, isn't the deletion policy default to declare "no consensus" and keep the articles? --BaronLarf 15:06, Apr 19, 2005 (UTC)"</i>. You are of course correct, articles are kept unless there is a clear consensus otherwise. But given the spirit of Wikipedia, it is preferable if a consensus can be formed - otherwise people will just keep repeating themselves&#160;:).</p>
<p>That said, there has been some fragmented talk on getting a compromise. One suggestion is to keep articles on schools that have a lot to be said about them, and to keep-but-merge information on schools that don't indicate much of interest about the school. I would like your opinion on this. Of course this still needs to be worked out, but BEEFSTEW seems like a good starting place for drawing the line. Yours, <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_*</a> 07:37, Apr 27, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Radiant!— Thanks for the message. I have come to the belief that all secondary schools (including high schools) are inherently notable. Elementary and middle schools should be merged into an article on the school district. I respectfully disagree with the BEEFSTEW system. Having said that, I believe that articles on Wikipedia should be of the highest possible calibre, so I do try to improve secondary school articles as much as possible, and watch over the ones I have edited to guard against POV additions and vandalism, to which high schools seem especially vulnerable.

<ul>
<li>I'm glad to hear you're improving them; I'd be a lot happier with a good article on schools (or indeed anything) than with a stub. Still, how would you feel about merging school stubs, and have them broken out to their own article if and when somebody comes along to provide more information to elevate it above stub-status? <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_*</a> 12:58, Apr 27, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I personally would rather expand the stubs now rather than merge them and break them apart later. In the interest of compromise, however, I could agree to merging of school stubs into school district articles, provided that no information was deleted. I would then propose the following timeline for the creation of new high school articles:
<ul>
<li>Mention the school districts in the municipality on the municipality's article</li>
<li>Create an article on the school district</li>
<li>If enough information is included, break out articles on the high schools to their own pages. These articles should have a good amount of verifiable information, with a format agreed upon at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Schools_9658.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Schools">Wikipedia:WikiProject Schools</a>. They would not, however, have to pass any notability test in order to be broken out.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>The issue of non-government funded schools (private schools in the United States) would still need to be discussed. Primary schools should remain merged with articles on school districts. How does this sound to you? Cheers. --<a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaronLarf_c8b8.html" title="User:BaronLarf">BaronLarf</a> 20:43, Apr 27, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>BaronLeaf, i applaud your efforts on keeping school articles in wiki. I also like the idea you have, by the way, for merging elementary schools and junior highs in with school district articles as a fair enough compromise for those who complain that wiki is too cluttered (which is not an issue in deciding whether to delete or keep according to wiki guidelines anyway). my argument for keeping schools is straightforward enough (see <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_The_Crescent_School_f997.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/The Crescent School">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/The Crescent School</a> for a more thorough version) - thousands of alumni exist for any one school, they and hundreds interested in education or the community a school is located in are all potential wiki users. that s too many potential users to needlessly not provide info for by not providing the articles. given that there is not strong argument for deleting and one for keeping, i m at a loss really why those opposed to school articles persist.

<p>I agree that the list of high schools does not go on the state page. In order to avoid having people just start a new list on the same page, I think it would be a good idea to have a new page for "List of high schools in Illinois" like there already is for Pennsylvania and New Jersey. With a name like that, anyone going to the page would know exactly what they are getting - nothing more, nothing less. A link on the Illinois page would let people know they should go elsewhere to list their schools. What do you think?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Personally I think that a list of high schools is useful unless it is a complete list of every high school in the state (which I don't see happening any time soon). But a seperate article is much better than a listing in the article on the state. --<a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaronLarf_c8b8.html" title="User:BaronLarf">BaronLarf</a> 14:50, May 31, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think that there's a ways to go before this or any school gets to be a FAC.

<p>I think it should be okay to remove the sort of obvious vanity/nonsense which various anons have been adding to the article. If, on the other hand, they're adding anything that might be construed as valuable information, and you think it's not notable or too much detail or whatever, be careful about reverting repeatedly. No, I don't think you've broken the 3RR, but I tend to be more lenient on such cases than other admins might. — <a href="../../../r/d/s/User%7ERdsmith4_389f.html" title="User:Rdsmith4">Dan</a> | <a href="../../../r/d/s/User_talk%7ERdsmith4_959f.html" title="User talk:Rdsmith4">Talk</a> 00:48, Jun 2, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There's been a big debate over whether or not your average, everyday high school should be allowed an article on Wikipedia. I, and others, believe that they should (with a few cavaets). Others believe that there should be a requirement of "notability" about the school before letting it stay. Sad to say, your article is just one of scores that have been nominated for deletion and battled over.

<p>I noticed we were editing this page simultaneously this morning, and I'd like to get your thoughts how the article should be improved. (Initially, I should mention I am relieved that you pulled the trigger and removed a lot of the extraneous cruft (name of student computer administrators <i>etc.</i>)—since I hesitated for fear of being "the bad guy," despite the fact that it clearly junked up an otherwise serviceable article.)</p>
<p>I attempted to consolidate some of the extracurricular activities (<i>e.g.</i> the Shakespeare Troupe and TJ Theatre sentences), but I'm dissatisfied how the resulting article appears as a collection of one-liners without much substance. Any suggestions, or should the whole thing be excised—perhaps in favor of a single paragraph describing such matters in summary only?</p>

<p>Hi there! If people such as this bother you and keep adding irrelevant detail, you should probably discuss it with them (preferably with a third opinion as well). Most people are reasonable about that and will understand what is and is not encyclopedic. Those few that don't could end up blocked - adding irrelevant or nonsensical material after being repeatedly told not to is a form of vandalism. Not that I mean that you should use that as a threat, but I just meant that there's a way of dealing with them if they really don't listen.
