<p>There has recently been a renaming of the school by the administration, and it was announced by the Provost Mary Marcy. The school is now, apparently, named Bard College at Simon's Rock. However, this has not yet been made public to the... well... public. Should this be noted on wikipedia before any publice announcement, or just left as is for the time being even though it has been mentioned by the provost of the school? <a href="../../../r/e/t/User%7ERetinarow_a0f0.html" title="User:Retinarow">Retinarow</a> 01:08, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Please do not move the page until an official announcement is made. I would also prefer that we not mention the change until it is officially announced and can be cited to something other than "Mary Marcy said so." Reporting it here would be a violation of several wikipedia policies (e.g. <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> - the name change is not, at present, verifiable by reliable sources and constitutes original research. Furthermore is no need to cause confusion or to prempt the schools own PR operation. <a href="../../../g/a/b/User%7EGabrielF_84d5.html" title="User:GabrielF">GabrielF</a> 01:13, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This is Wikipedia, not Rumorpedia. Before making a change like this, you need written sources that you can cite. That could be a newspaper article -- has the Eagle covered it yet? -- or an online source such as the college Web site. --<a href="../../../f/u/b/User%7EFubar_Obfusco_9a7a.html" title="User:Fubar Obfusco">FOo</a> 05:06, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Simon's Rock will be transitioning to the new name throughout 2007, primarly during the summer between two academic years. As it stands, the college's name on all official correspondence has not changed; there is no reason for the wikipedia article to have moved yet. Further, I suggest that the article be named simply "Simon's Rock" (which is more historically accurate, represented by the official seal, etc) and all other past, present, and future names should redirect there. --<a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGruepig_d012.html" title="User:Gruepig">Gruepig</a> 07:28, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>"Simon's Rock" is probably the best name, considering that this article is about the entire history of the college and not just the possible future of the college. Currently, the "Bard College at Simon's Rock" name is <i>vaporware</i> -- it has been announced but not yet actually used. --<a href="../../../f/u/b/User%7EFubar_Obfusco_9a7a.html" title="User:Fubar Obfusco">FOo</a> 03:53, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I expanded the page a little, adding sections about the name and the history of the school. I'd ultimately like to make a section about the academics of the school, one about student life (no, not the office of student life, just what students do, clubs, the town, etc.), and clean up the "trivia" section (ultimately I'd like to remove that section in favor of incorporating it into other sections, like I did a little of). Of course, change things as you wish, 'cause that's what Wikipedia's about, eh? <a href="../../../j/e/s/User%7EJesuschex_d368.html" title="User:Jesuschex">Jesuschex</a> 01:01, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Umm, i'm not quite sure of the actual dates, but i know for a fact that the science center was not completed until at least 1998, as opposed to 1996 as the article currently states. I entered SRC as a student in the Fall of 1997 and construction had just begun on the Fisher Science Center. Likewise, the athletic center was also completed at a later date,but i am unsure as to exactly when. If someone who feelsa little more motivated to maintain the accuracy of Wikipedia, they may want to go back and re-check their research. Thanks.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Construction of the Fisher Science Center began in March 1997 and it opened for classes in January of 1998. <a href="http://www.simons-rock.edu/about/history.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.simons-rock.edu/about/history.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> --<a href="../../../f/u/b/User%7EFubar_Obfusco_9a7a.html" title="User:Fubar Obfusco">FOo</a> 20:19, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Although the supposed name change was announced several months ago, it has not happened yet. The college continues to send out mailings in the names "Simon's Rock College of Bard", "Simon's Rock College", and "Simon's Rock", still uses these names on its Web site, and is still commonly known by these names.</p>
<p>I suggest that the page move was substantially premature. What was announced was not that the college <i>has</i> changed its name, but that it <i>plans to change its name in the future</i>. The name change has not happened yet, as evidenced by the continuing use of the "Simon's Rock College".</p>
<p>In other words, by moving the article to "Bard College at Simon's Rock", we have mistaken an engagement for a marriage. --<a href="../../../f/u/b/User%7EFubar_Obfusco_9a7a.html" title="User:Fubar Obfusco">FOo</a> 06:04, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I disagree. When the change was announced, it was, in fact, announced that the change would technically go into full effect during the summer of 2007. However, it was added that it would be a slow process, and that various things would start changing as soon as the announcement went out. So, the name of the Wikipedia article could have changed this summer, yes. But it could also have changed at any time between the announcement of the change and this summer. It's much more like we've taken an engagement to mean that from now on, the two people involved will spend the rest of their lives together, which is implied in an engagement. Just, the marriage itself hasn't technically happened yet. <a href="../../../j/e/s/User%7EJesuschex_d368.html" title="User:Jesuschex">Jesuschex</a> 18:08, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><i>The marriage hasn't technically happened yet.</i> Precisely. So it is <i>incorrect</i> for an encyclopedia article to refer to the college as Mr. and Mrs. Bard College At Simon's Rock. <code>:)</code></dd>

<dd>To be quite honest, there is a general conflict or tension in <i>many</i> Wikipedia articles between representation of <i>this year's version</i> of something, and representing the <i>history</i> of it. However, in this case, naming the article as it is means taking <i>next year's version</i> as more credible than the current usage. --<a href="../../../f/u/b/User%7EFubar_Obfusco_9a7a.html" title="User:Fubar Obfusco">FOo</a> 08:23, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
