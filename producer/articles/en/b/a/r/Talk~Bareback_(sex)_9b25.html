<p>Based on reading the discussion below, I think the neutrality concerns have been addressed (i.e., the language of the article is balanced and addresses the various points of view about what barebacking means). People seem to still have problems with lack of citations and maybe the quality, but I think as written it is neutral (a separate issue from sourcing and quality).</p>
<p>Considering the many people who have deemed it neutral, I'm going to remove that flag. If someone objects, can you very specifically explain what is objectionable in terms of NEUTRALITY?

<p>There are way too many "some people believe" and "others claim that" sentences in here. There was also an entire report regarding AOL ads that lacked references or citations. I placed a "weasel word" flag on here and edited some of the language because, yet again, we have obvious agendas being furthered in this article. --<a href="../../../j/u/l/User%7EJulien_Deveraux_5c4d.html" title="User:Julien Deveraux">Julien Deveraux</a> 23:26, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>"A small minority subculture of gay men has gone further, in fetishizing HIV infection itself, and deliberately taking part in barebacking as a way to get infected: this so-called bugchasing behavior is even more controversial."</p>
<p>Hello, rather new to wikipedia. Does anyone have substantial reason to take this at face value? As far as I know this is merely an urban rumor and, while I don't think such a fetish impossible, I wonder its validity.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Hi, welcome to Wikipedia.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>There's substantial discussion of that topic, as well as the controversy over whether or not the phenomenon actually exists, over at the article <a href="../../../b/u/g/Bugchasing.html" title="Bugchasing">bugchasing</a>. - <a href="../../../j/r/e/User%7EJredmond_3335.html" title="User:Jredmond">jredmond</a> 21:24, 13 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>The phenomenon really does exist, though my evidence is rather anecdotal; as there are lists online for people into this behavior and an episode of Queer as Folk dealt with the topic..so..who knows. I did, however, remove the reference to this in the article because I felt it was irrelevant since there is no article called "bugchasing". Also, there were too many references to all the negative connotations surrounding this behavior and a lack of information about how the word is now used in straight porn to mean just what the phrase is supposed to mean..fucking without a condom. --<a href="../../../j/u/l/User%7EJulien_Deveraux_5c4d.html" title="User:Julien Deveraux">Julien Deveraux</a> 8 July 2005 08:59 (UTC)</p>

<p>The question to RFC:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Talk:Bareback and Talk:Barebacking -- an ongoing dispute about the specific meaning of the term: does it refer primarily to unprotected anal sex among gay men, or can it refer to any type of unprotected intercourse among people of any gender? 21:10, August 2, 2005 (UTC)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The article:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Barebacking is a term that originated in gay slang for anal sex without the use of a condom. Though it largely retains its original meaning, the term has recently "crossed over" outside the gay community to simply mean any type of penetrative intercourse (anal, oral, or vaginal) without the use of a condom.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, I came here from RfC and took a look. I see an insistence that it only refers to gay sex as patently ridiculous. Any lookup of the term on the web gives you non-gay and non-anal references. Is the term bareback used for non-gay and non-anal sex? Yes, obviously, and without dispute. So are the first two lines in the article correct? Yes. Are they controversial or argumentive? No. Are there people in the world who still use it only one way? Sure, but I'm sure plenty of male Johns who hire pros only think of it another way. The way the article presents it is neutral. <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchmuckyTheCat_0da1.html" title="User:SchmuckyTheCat">SchmuckyTheCat</a> 23:14, 17 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Google is not gospel, but if it were, well in the first 7 pages of results <i>all</i> the pages define barebacking as unprotected anal sex between men, including several health authorities (see <a href="http://www.canadian-health-network.ca/servlet/ContentServer?cid=1013985&amp;pagename=CHN-RCS%2FCHNResource%2FFAQCHNResourceTemplate&amp;c=CHNResource&amp;lang=En" class="external text" title="http://www.canadian-health-network.ca/servlet/ContentServer?cid=1013985&amp;pagename=CHN-RCS%2FCHNResource%2FFAQCHNResourceTemplate&amp;c=CHNResource&amp;lang=En" rel="nofollow">Canadian Health Network</a>) and AIDS organizations. <a href="../../../e/x/p/User%7EExploding_Boy_5421.html" title="User:Exploding Boy">Exploding Boy</a> 01:00, August 18, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I see a problem here. Google is generating links between gay and barebacking because barebacking is being discussed in the context of HIV amongst gay men. The epidemic was 'a gay plague', and in the context of government and health organisations, they will be be discussing the relevance of barebacking in terms of this population. From the UK i do not know whether HIV is still a predominantly gay issue in the US. I think that in the whole of the world, it is not, but medical care is frequently a developed world issue, and the rest of the world does not get studies done about what is going on. This does not answer your debate, but it gives reason why the terms gay and bareback may frequently be linked.<a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandpiper_2d25.html" title="User:Sandpiper">Sandpiper</a> 18:36, 21 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have personally used this term to refer to unprotected hetereosexual sex, and know many others that do so. <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.urbandictionary.com/" rel="nofollow">Urban Dictionary</a> is a frequently referred to site on modern slang, and <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=bareback" class="external text" title="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=bareback" rel="nofollow">they list both definitions</a> with 50+ votes in support of the gay only definition, but also a number of supporters for varying definitions that omit gender. Like so much slang, its usage has clearly expanded. Even if the article continues to focus primarily on gay unprotected sex, there needs to be mention of its crossover into the wider community. <a href="../../../t/o/d/User%7ETodfox_2c77.html" title="User:Todfox">Kit</a> 02:07, 13 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Personally, I'd never heard the term "bareback" mean anything but gay anal sex, but it seems clear that the other meaning, having sex without a condom in general, is also common enough to be notable. What's not clear is that we've assembled any evidence that the gay meaning came first. Perhaps someone with access to the OED or similarly comprehensive dictionary could look it up. Or perhaps there is another authoritative source which could be located. -- <a href="../../../b/e/l/User%7EBeland_b814.html" title="User:Beland">Beland</a> 06:17, 28 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Authoritative source regarding slang? Usage would vary from culture to country. I think it's clear the term can have multiple meanings, and it should be so stated.

<p>Youll find bareback originates from riding a horse without a saddle (unprotected). An obvious cross reference to sex can be made, i.e sex with a person without protection. --<a href="../../../p/r/i/User%7EPrincessBrat_4583.html" title="User:PrincessBrat">PrincessBrat</a> 10:51, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>In my view, there are four different referents for barebacking: 1)The practice of casual unprotected sex amongst gay men 2)The practice of casual unprotected sex amongst straight people 3)A feature that prostitutes may use to sell themselves 4)The controversy surrounding these sexual practices. This article can have sections about each of these.</p>
<p>I think we should examine carefully all claims about what "Barebacking: the Sexual Practice" is responsible for, because many of these claims are related to that story's sequel, "Barebacking II: The Controversy."</p>
<p>Please edit my edits, add epidemiological information, and, especially, pay attention to what I wrote about straight people. I don't know a lot about straight people, so I need some help with that section.</p>

<p>This article has zero sources and consists almost entirely of dubious characterizations and facts. For example, the claim that protease inhibitors caused the gay community to have more unprotected sex. Seriously? No doubt my fears are baseless and all of this information comes from some peer reviewed study in the JOURNAL OF INTERNET RUMORS. <a href="../../../s/a/v/User%7ESavidan_59ac.html" title="User:Savidan">savidan</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/v/User_talk%7ESavidan_3fd9.html" title="User talk:Savidan">(talk)</a> <a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><span style="color:#008000;">(e@)</span></a></sup> 02:55, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><br />
oh, come on. anybody who has been a gay adult since the early 90s knows that barebacking exploded only after the protease inhibitors made aids a so-called manageable disease. there have been countless articles about it, and yes i am too lazy to look it up. but it's not exactly a wild internet rumor.</p>
<p>i agree that this article needs more sources, though.</p>

<p>I strongly object to this merge proposal. Unprotected sex is a superset of barebacking. <a href="../../../j/b/k/User%7EJBKramer_42bf.html" title="User:JBKramer">JBKramer</a> 12:34, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I disagree, i feel that having a barebacking and unprotected sex article is tantamount to having an article for unprotected anal sex, unprotected oral sex, unprotected vaginal sex, unprotected fellatio, unprotected rimming, unprotected cunilingus, etc. It should be an important compnant of the unprotected sex article, alltho i do believe that unprotected sex should be merged into barebacking, and then the name should be changed to unprotected sex, or perhaps a new name such as, sex without a barrier?<a href="../../../q/r/c/User%7EQrc2006_905d.html" title="User:Qrc2006">Qrc2006</a> 00:43, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Comment: I also strongly disagree with the merger. Barebacking is a fetish and, in the age of AIDS, a social and psychological phenomenon. Barebackers are now a major subculture within the gay community. Go and have a look at bareback.com, barebackjack.com, bnskin.com, bugshare.net and the websites of bareback porn companies like Treasure Island Media, Cobra Video, Hot Desert Knights, SX Video, Tippo Sesso, Puppy Productions, and Eurocreme's Bare, Twinkz, Raw and Punkz studios to fully appreciate how barebacking and bareback sexual fantasies have totally exploded within the gay community. The Wikipedia article on barebacking conveys this.</p>
<p>In contrast, "unprotected sex" is an adjective and a noun. It absolutely and totally fails to convey the subculture of "barebackers" and the connotations of that word. If you merge the "barebacking" article into the "unprotected sex" article, you should merge the articles on "Christianity" into an article on "worship".</p>
<p>By way of analogy, Christians "worship", but self-identify as Christians and are part of the Christian movement.</p>
<p>In like manner, barebackers have "unprotected sex", but self-identify as barebackers and are part of the barebacking movement. [Anon User]</p>

<p>As I understand it, the more comonly used clinmical term has become STI, with STD being an old term that has fallen/is falling out of usage. I recognize that the article itself is titled: "Sexually transmitted disease", and STI is redirected there. (See <a href="../../../s/e/x/Talk%7ESexually_transmitted_disease_9b2b.html#STI.27s.3F_When_did_this_happen.3F" title="Talk:Sexually transmitted disease">Talk:Sexually_transmitted_disease#STI.27s.3F__When_did_this_happen.3F</a>) Obviously epotions both ways. SO, it is certainly debatable. Frankly I have been more familiar with "STD".</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You may have asked yourself why we use the term sexually transmitted infection (STI), instead of the term sexually transmitted disease (STD). The term "infection" more accurately describes conditions where sexual partners may not have symptoms and may not be aware that they have an infection, and because many of these infections are actually curable. The term "infection" carries less of a social stigma than the term "disease." The term STI is also being used by leading sexual health organizations such as Planned Parenthood.<a href="http://www.brown.edu/Student_Services/Health_Services/Health_Education/sexual_health/sti/sti_home.htm#4" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.brown.edu/Student_Services/Health_Services/Health_Education/sexual_health/sti/sti_home.htm#4" rel="nofollow">[4]</a></p>

<p>I searched google scholar for ther terms, and in 1996, there were 224 papers with the term STI, and 2210 about STD. In 2006 (10 years later) there were 2000 papers with the term STI and 3010 with the term STD. In raw numbers, STD is still used, and used slightly more freqently that STI, but in percentage, STI was only 9% of the time, and last year, 40%. There is no place that standardizes the uses of the term, but STI will likely be the predominant term a few years from now, and 10 years from STD will be considered to be archaic. <a href="../../../a/t/o/User%7EAtomaton_fe94.html" title="User:Atomaton">Atom</a> 22:35, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Where would the best place be to mention the "Load-taking" phenomenom, Since barebacking doesn't have a condom in use when and where a man ejaculates is often a question.
