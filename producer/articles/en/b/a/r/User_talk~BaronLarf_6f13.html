<p>Good to see you around again. Welcome back! Btw the April issue of Milwaukee Magazine was supposed to have a piece on Wikipedia (I can only get the online version where I live though).

<dd>Thanks. I really can't say how long I'll be able to stick around before my job starts sucking up too much of my time again, but it's good to be Wikipedia-ing again. I think I overdid it last time around, and got burned out. Let me know if you find out anything more about that magazine article; I can't find out anything about it at the <a href="http://www.milwaukeemagazine.com/042006/" class="external text" title="http://www.milwaukeemagazine.com/042006/" rel="nofollow">Milwaukee Magazine</a> website.

<p>It has been suggested by <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianSmithson_ad3a.html" title="User:BrianSmithson">User:BrianSmithson</a> that the Beer and brewery categories should be renamed. The proposal has been supported by <a href="../../../s/y/r/User%7ESyrthiss_6bb0.html" title="User:Syrthiss">User:Syrthiss</a>, and supported and expanded by myself. The notion is that the regional categories should follow the format of "Beer and breweries in Africa" /Europe/Asia/North America/South America/Oceania. "Brewers and breweries" could also be renamed "Beer and breweries by region". And all the countries should also be renamed (and merged if needed) as, for example, "Beer and breweries of Germany", "Beer and breweries of Britain", "Beer and breweries of Poland". The word in each case would be beer rather than beers to allow for general articles on beer culture in each region as well as individual beers.</p>

<p>You deleted much of the Camp Timberlane article, mostly about the camp-related podcast. The podcast is a major new "off-season" thing that everyone listens to. Can you restore it please? 66.82.9.81 21:37, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You don't Understand. The podcast is a very big part of Camp Timberlane, and not mentioning it in an article about Timberlane borders on censorship. Plus, you told me to get my own account. I have one, but due to something, the login doesnt stick. Know anything about it? 66.82.9.81 03:16, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Please don't keep deleting a perfectly good article section becuase someone wrote an essay telling you not to. At the very least, post on the talk page and then the various editors of the article about your proposed delete rather than just deleting and citing non-official policy as your reasoning. 66.82.9.81 03:20, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Upon your request, I separated the two topics (Timberlane/KTIM) and placed a short summary in the Timberlane article. But now some other admin wants me to merge it back. At least he told me with a notice on the page rather than taking action straightaway. 66.82.9.81 03:36, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In view of the fact that this user appears to be referencing me (although I should note that I'm not an admin), I write to direct your attention to KTIM Online, the article about which he writes and an article that I PRODded a bit ago. Surely the station itself, and especially the podcasts thence issuing, is non-notable, and so I imagine that if the PROD tag is removed, the article will be deleted at AfD. Even as I've only looked cursorily at the Camp Timberlane article, I think you are altogether correct that the information as appended is non-notable, and, for that reason, I wouldn't support a merge. Inasmuch, though, as the user seems to have been relatively cordial and to have attempted to comply with policy in his creation of the article, I don't think the "merge" tag is applied in bad faith; I think simply that he/she fails to understand that, irrespective of one's politeness or compliance with otherwise applicable policies, that which is non-notable is non-notable (whether as a standalone article or as part of a broader art). For my part, then, I think the new article should surely be deleted (although not speedied, since it seems to make some argument--however spurious--toward the notability of its subject), and I will leave you to continue what seems to be altogether sound work in policing the Camp article. <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 03:43, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Alright.. sorry about that whole mess. One more thing: Where can I read dicussions/discuss <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">notability</a>? I don't like the idea that a certain number of people have to know about it for it to be in WIkipedia. If everyone knows about it, then why does it get priority over a topic that 30 people know about? How does that expand human knowledge. Sorry to criticize, and thanks for helping out. 69.19.14.23 01:33, 7 April 2006 (UTC) (Yet another post by "66.82.9.81")

<dd>Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, not a collection of links. Notability is indeed a guideline, and it's a subjective one. But I think you would agree that not every podcast that has 30 listeners deserves its own Wikipedia article.

<p>Hi! Since I put up the new list of opera companies (complied by three of us on the Opera Project), there have been a flurry of changes by first you and afterwards by E Pluribus Anthony. It's actually difficult to work it all out. Would it be possible to put your recommendations (which I probably agree with) on the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_notable_opera_companies.html" title="List of notable opera companies">List of notable opera companies</a> (present title - not that I like it) Talk page under the explanation of what we did?</p>
<p>One point: you changed the category to opera companies rather than opera. At the moment all the lists are top level (i.e. under Opera) rather than sharing a category with individual items on the list. Is this wrong? It seems a common sense arrangement. After all someone who checks the opera category with want to know what is in it. Regards.</p>

<dd>First, I want to applaud you for all of your high-quality additions to opera-related articles; though I'm an admin and the third member of <a href="../../../w/p/o/WP%7EWPO_12ba.html" title="WP:WPO">WP:WPO</a>, I have had to take a wiki-break until a month ago, and was pleasantly surprised by all of the great new opera articles.</dd>
<dd>With the lists, I see it as pretty straight-forward that articles having to do with a specific aspect of Opera should go under that category; lists of operas go under "Operas," lists of opera houses go under "Opera Houses," lists of opera singers go under "Opera singers," and so on. If someone is looking for a list of Opera Houses, they can simply click on "Opera houses". At that category page, a user will see "Main article: Opera houses: Houses listed by continent, then country", making it clear that they can click on that article for a list. The same goes for Opera companies, etc.</dd>
<dd>If someone is looking for lists, they can also click on the "Opera-related lists" category under the Opera category, linking them to the lists.--<a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaronLarf_c8b8.html" title="User:BaronLarf">Baron</a><strong class="selflink">Larf</strong> 15:16, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thank you. I should also applaud you for developing the opera project! I'm delighted you are back and look forward to cooperating on projects. I've been recruiting some opera enthusiasts and specialists to work on articles - mainly people who write on the Opera-L email list. They know a lot about opera but not a great deal about Wikipedia. Having an admin around to support the group and help solve technical problems will be great!</dd>
<dd>With regard to categories, if a list has the same category designation as an item, surely it will be listed as such? For example if the 'List of Opera Companies' is categorized as an opera company, surely it will appear as an opera company under the letter L? Isn't this a problem?</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Yes, it would normally be listed just plain alphabetically in the category. To get around that, the following things are done:
<ul>
<li>The list is given the following code for categoization: [[Category:Operas| ]] instead of [[Category:Operas]]. This puts the article at the very top of the articles in the category (see <a href="../../../o/p/e/Category%7EOperas_d24f.html" title="Category:Operas">Category:Operas</a>, where <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_operas.html" title="List of operas">List of operas</a> is at the top of the list.)</li>
<li>The list is mentioned in the text of the category page (see <a href="../../../o/p/e/Category%7EOperas_d24f.html" title="Category:Operas">Category:Operas</a> where <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_operas.html" title="List of operas">List of operas</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_famous_operas.html" title="List of famous operas">List of famous operas</a> are prominently mentioned.</li>

<p>10 days ago, you fixed this redirect, and you appeared a bit perturbed (excusably) about it. Okay, I can clear up the confusion for you on why on earth this page (improperly) liked to the university. (The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Washington_state&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Washington_state&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">page history</a> might help.)</p>
<p>Four years ago, the page was created to link to <a href="../../../w/a/s/Washington.html" title="Washington">Washington</a>. Then, two months ago, an ill-advised (probably East Coast <a href="../../../s/m/i/Image%7ESmiley.png_c43a.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/8/80/Smiley.png/20px-Smiley.png" alt="" width="20" height="20" longdesc="../../../s/m/i/Image%7ESmiley.png_c43a.html" /></a>) user attempted to move Washington to <a href="../../../w/a/s/Washington_State_09b2.html" title="Washington State">Washington State</a>, and subsequently "fixed" the redirect. Problem is, <a href="../../../w/a/s/Washington_State_09b2.html" title="Washington State">Washington State</a> (with the capital S) is <i>not</i> the state's actual page, and it redirects to the university, as well it should. A <a href="../../../b/o/t/WP%7EBOT_8b0e.html" title="WP:BOT">robot</a> then "fixed" the <a href="../../../d/o/u/Double_redirect.html" title="Double redirect">double redirect</a>, automatically assuming that the redirect <i>wanted</i> to go to the university. Finally, you walked in and solved the problem.</p>
<p>What boggles my mind is how this could have possibly gone on for two entire months before someone fixed it. (Due to the <a href="../../../w/a/s/Washington_State_09b2.html" title="Washington State">Washington State</a> redirect, <a href="../../../w/a/s/Washington_State_University_f7e8.html" title="Washington State University">Washington State University</a> <i>did</i> already have a disamb header on top of the page, which probably had something to do with it...) It's also stunning that in the week after the double redirect was created, nobody noticed it enough to fix it. But in any case, thank you very much for doing so, and I've now added the page to my watchlist, so problems like this probably won't happen again.

<p>For the climate section of <a href="../../../m/i/l/Milwaukee.html" title="Milwaukee">Milwaukee</a>, how does, "Milwaukee's location in the [[Great Lakes region of the <a href="../../../m/i/d/Midwestern_United_States_9447.html" title="Midwestern United States">Midwestern United States</a>.." I think it is important that we include the Great Lakes in the intro because being on the shores of Lake Michigan is a veyr important factor in our climate.

<dd>I agree that the Great Lakes are important to the climate; that's why a couple paragraphs down there's a discussion of Lake Michigan and the lake effect. But the region is known as the Midwest more often than the Great Lakes region, and that's where there's a good article to link to. So, imho, the "midwest" should stay as the name of the region.

<p>Sorry to keep coming back, but i think the 11-time violence thing was probably a mistake from an edit conflict. It was 9 times before the 6 may violence, so I changed it to 10. Then you probably came upon an edit conflict when reverting and changed it to 11 or some other mishmash. I'm guessing the true vandal count is 10.</p>

<p>Hi. I noticed you reverted my edits from the Bob Uecker article that I made late Friday night (early Sat. morning). Your edits are incorrect. I was watching while Uecker was on 'The Tonight Show with Jay Leno' Friday night when Leno asked him if he was born in Milwaukee. He said many people believed that he was but that he actually had been born outside Chicago while his family was traveling. He said he had always lived in Milwaukee. If you have any other information suggesting that the tonight show interview was false, please let me know. Otherwise, I do not see why Uecker would lie about his own birthplace on national television. Just wanted you to know the reason for my edits and that I am not a random vandalist&#160;:-).

<dd>Well, as I say in the article, it's a homophone for the card game "Euchre". In past arguments with other IPA proponents, we have compromised on this approach: You can have your IPA stuff, and for words where the pronunciation is not necessarily obvious, it's acceptable to <i>also</i> say "rhymes with" or whatever.

<dd>If we could get a sound file of him saying his own name <i>and</i> telling that tale of the "oleo run", we could cover both bases. The sound file is theoretically a good idea, except that it requires special software, maybe, which is a worse issue than having to learn another language. I saw there was a sound file in the <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago.html" title="Chicago">Chicago</a> article. I've heard it said "chi-KAH-go" (which is how I usually say it), "chi-KAW-go" (which is how trained radio announcers say it, or used to), "chi-KAW-<i>guh</i>" (which is how some of the natives say it) and probably other ways. However, it's curious that the IPA thing is not even there.

<p>The recently added piece on Vern was offensive; thank you for removing it. I also don't think that he is particularly notable as he isn't actually affiliated with the school in any way, merely sometimes tolerated having been kicked off the grounds multiple times.</p>
<p>Rick, however, is more well known than most of the faculty and staff at the school. He, and his interactions with the student body, are a major component of the culture of the school. If you simply believe that no one associated with a high school is notable, well, so be it, but is the existence of mental disability is offensive to you? The section on Rick was factual and objective, if not referenced. (I'm sure I can dig up any references you want for it in past issues of <i>The Messenger</i>.) I don't think it was offensive and assume that most people, especially those that know Rick and even Rick himself, would agree with me. Rick has managed to live independently into early middle age in the face of his disability. It is a part of who he is, not some dirty secret to hide under the rug. I mean, we could say that defining Hellen Keller by her disabilities is offensive as well. We could write an article about al the great work she did and leave out any mention of disability as that would be tarnishing her image.</p>
<p>Finally, what is offensive about what was written about Mr. Warren Anderson, who taught at Garfield for over 20 years and revolutionized the history department making him as notable as a teacher can get aside from the one at <a href="../../../g/a/r/Garfield_Senior_High_School_%28Los_Angeles%29_5167.html" title="Garfield Senior High School (Los Angeles)">the other purple and white Garfield bulldogs</a>. It obviously needs cleaning up, but neither of your reasons for deleting would seem to apply:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>*<b>Anderson</b> - Refers to the beloved former Garfield world history teacher named Warren Anderson. Though he retired in 2004, his name is still often brought up, as he had taught freshman world history at Garfield for many years. He is known for his wit, intelligence, slideshows of his travels around the world, and ability to make students disappointed about having substitute teachers. He taught in the same room (119) for the length of his tenure at Garfield. Room 119 is considered to be hallowed ground by most students who had him as a teacher.</i>&#160;?</dd>

<p>Hello. Thank you for your attention to the <a href="../../../j/o/u/Journal_Communications_f306.html" title="Journal Communications">Journal Communications</a> page. I am curious about one thing, though: Why did you change some state abbreviations so they're spelled out, but not others? I don't really have a preference either way if it's consistent. (For the record, I went with state abbreviations because the <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia%7EManual_of_Style_350a.html" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style">Manual of Style</a> doesn't address it, so I deferred to the Associated Press Stylebook.) Thanks for your help as I learn. <a href="../../../d/m/p/User%7EDmp348_bc6b.html" title="User:Dmp348">Dmp348</a> 22:45, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Hey, great job on the article. There wasn't any reason why I left a couple abbreviations there other than the fact that I missed some. I wish I could point to someplace on the <a href="../../../m/o/s/WP%7EMOS_8984.html" title="WP:MOS">WP:MOS</a> where it says that it's common practice to spell out cities, and states, but I can't find anything which specificall says that in regards to cities. If you look around, though, it's very rare to see state abbreviations used, probably just because it takes so much more time to type [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin|Milwaukee, Wis.]] as opposed to [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]]. It does state <a href="../../../m/o/s/WP%7EMOS_8984.html#Acronyms_and_abbreviations" title="WP:MOS">here</a> that abbreviations are discouraged unless the abbrevation has been explained earlier in the article. Convention is to state "City, State" the first time, and then to just say "City" from then on.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Anyhow, it just didn't look right to me, so I spelled out the state names while I was editing the article to add a category and italics to the newspapers.

<p>Hello, I edited the <a href="../../../w/i/s/Wisconsin.html" title="Wisconsin">Wisconsin</a> page to describe the Democratic party as being both liberal and progressive, and you reverted my edit. The reason I made the edit is because the portrayal of the Democratic Party as exclusively <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberalism.html" title="Liberalism">liberal</a> is incorrect. The Democratic Party is a big tent, and while liberals are a certainly a big part of the party, I believe it to be a mistake to characterize the Democrats as a 'liberal' party, because there are non-liberals to both the <a href="../../../b/l/u/Blue_Dog_Democrat_6513.html" title="Blue Dog Democrat">right</a> and <a href="../../../d/e/m/Democratic_Socialists_of_America_fb16.html" title="Democratic Socialists of America">left</a> within the party organization. In Wisconsin specifically, <a href="../../../t/a/m/Tammy_Baldwin_d7e2.html" title="Tammy Baldwin">Tammy Baldwin</a> identifies herself as a progressive rather than a liberal. Perhaps we could find a way of describing the parties that accurately reflects their <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_tent.html" title="Big tent">big tent</a> natures but does not unwittingly draw parallels with the defunct Progressive Party or is otherwise misleading? <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAliceinlampyland_08a2.html" title="User:Aliceinlampyland">aliceinlampyland</a> 21:55, 19 May 2006 (UTC).</p>

<p>I noticed your request for articles on both places. I live just minutes from both. I can <b>EASILY</b> get an image of both. I'm wondering what sources I could use for creating an article. Do you have any generic sources on places in Wisconsin? Pipe has been especially elusive.</p>
<p>I wonder if there should be an article on a region of Fond du Lac county called "The Holyland". Both Johnsburg and Pipe are just outside the region. Almost every little unincorporated village is named after something religious: Jericho (2 miles from me), Marytown (also 3 miles from me), St. Joe, St. Peter, Mount Calvary, St. Cloud, etc. Thousands of my Catholic distant cousins live there.

<p>I noticed on my watchlist that you moved the Brothertown, Calumet County, Wisconsin article to Brothertown, Wisconsin. I notice that there are several other towns in Calumet County should get moved. I can do the task. I'm curious about what's the current naming convention for townships in Wisconsin.</p>
<p>I also noticed that you abbreviated the wording and moved around images that I took. I'm cool with that. I ran across an article last night that talked about how to arrange images to lessen conflicts with different monitor display resolutions. I found it somewhere under WP:IMAGE. --<a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyalbroil_3602.html" title="User:Royalbroil">Royalbroil</a> 23:12, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hey Royalbroil. I was going systematically through all municipalities in Wisconsin by county, alphabetically, to add the {{<a href="../../../w/i/k/Template%7EWikiProject_Wisconsin_b46e.html" title="Template:WikiProject Wisconsin">WikiProject Wisconsin</a>}} template to their talk pages. When I come across a page that needs improvement, I do a bit of touch up.</dd>
<dd>The naming convention for municipalities is at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Wisconsin_Cities_6b27.html#Naming_conventions" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Wisconsin/Cities">Wikipedia:WikiProject Wisconsin/Cities#Naming conventions</a>. Basically, it just states that the name of an article for Footown, Foo County, Wisconsin should be Footown, Wisconsin, unless there's another place with that same name. There's lots of articles with Footown, Foo County, Wisconsin where that county name just isn't necessary. The articles were mostly created by bots, so it takes a bit of work to have everything make sense. When there's a city and a town <i>next to each other</i> with the same name (like <a href="../../../c/e/d/Cedarburg%2C_Wisconsin_af2f.html" title="Cedarburg, Wisconsin">the City of Cedarburg</a> and <a href="../../../c/e/d/Cedarburg_%28town%29%2C_Wisconsin_76a6.html" title="Cedarburg (town), Wisconsin">the Town of Cedarburg</a>, the city gets <a href="../../../c/e/d/Cedarburg%2C_Wisconsin_af2f.html" title="Cedarburg, Wisconsin">Cedarburg, Wisconsin</a> and the town gets <a href="../../../c/e/d/Cedarburg_%28town%29%2C_Wisconsin_76a6.html" title="Cedarburg (town), Wisconsin">Cedarburg (town), Wisconsin</a>. Villages are treated like cities in this way.</dd>
<dd>Now, if there are two completely unrelated towns in separate counties, that's when something like <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harrison%2C_Calumet_County%2C_Wisconsin_a6f7.html" title="Harrison, Calumet County, Wisconsin">Harrison, Calumet County, Wisconsin</a> and <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harrison%2C_Waupaca_County%2C_Wisconsin_5e18.html" title="Harrison, Waupaca County, Wisconsin">Harrison, Waupaca County, Wisconsin</a> becomes necessary.</dd>
<dd>With the images, I was just trying to standardize using my own judgment; <a href="../../../p/i/c/WP%7EPIC_5fb5.html" title="WP:PIC">WP:PIC</a> shows that images should usually not be made to be larger than 300 pixels, with the norm being 180. If you want to resize thumbnails to show on your computer at a different size, you can do this under the "files" tab at <a href="../../../p/r/e/Special%7EPreferences_a6b2.html" title="Special:Preferences">Special:Preferences</a>. There's a good guide for captions at <a href="../../../c/a/p/Wikipedia%7ECaptions_f5bf.html" title="Wikipedia:Captions">Wikipedia:Captions</a>; I was aiming for more brevity. Thanks for your comments. --<a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaronLarf_c8b8.html" title="User:BaronLarf">Baron</a><strong class="selflink">Larf</strong> 00:27, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>WP:PIC is the article that I was talking about. Thanks for citing the naming conventions. Sounds like a reasonable policy to me. Good job in cleaning up the bots' work. You used good judgement with the images that I looked at. I'll let you do the articles for Calumet County since you have everything under control. I'm trying to improve Wikipedia's articles for my part of the state since there aren't many wikipedians here. My cousin, Bdman, was been helping a bit too. Please don't ask him to join, for I doubt he plans to join this Wikiproject, but he is a friend of the project.</p>
<p>I have been to all 72 counties in Wisconsin during my vacations. I'll keep my eyes open for photo opportunities when I'm on vacation. I'll look over the Images needed in Wisconsin category before I leave for a few day long trip to Sturgeon Bay in Door County in around a month.</p>
<p>I have been doing a Wisconsin racetrack tour this summer. I've been to 11 tracks: Chilton (2 tracks), Plymouth, Columbus, Madison, Manitowoc, Luxemburg, Kaukauna (stockcar and drag tracks), Shawano, and Oshkosh. I hope to get to 5 more yet (Sturgeon Bay, Antigo, Francis Creek, Beaver Dam, Seymour, and Slinger). The track needs to be within 2 hours of my home. I've been taking pictures of the county fairgrounds where the tracks are located at, and I'll upload them to the county's article later when I have more time. I've also taken some pictures of the cities that I've passed through. I've been uploading a picture of a car from each division to a flickr account. There are links on my user page. --<a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyalbroil_3602.html" title="User:Royalbroil">Royalbroil</a> 00:56, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>_ _ I'm reverting your 4 edits of the 16th, even tho in their diffident and bumbling way, the MOS page you cite and the <a href="../../../d/a/s/Dash.html" title="Dash">Dash</a> page it cites (and their talk pages) do support your contention more than mine. I'm not persuaded that the guideline represents more than the consensus of a few pedants caring more about it than more better grounded users. For instance, the 30 years' experience of a professional writer i consulted includes knowing how to generate dashes in MS Word but does not suggest doing so for this usage. And in any case, i'm pretty sure the difference is not worth changing 10s of thousands of entries. But that's not the real issue here.<br />
_ _ Perhaps you have a bot that could do the conversion to the hundreds of LoPbN pages in one fell swoop, and can use it in an ongoing fashion to maintain the en-dashes (unspaced, i trust) against their erosion by the many LoPbN contributors who are so clueless about the surrounding entries as to even enter unlinked names or create red links like Newton, Isaac; i will not squawk at your doing so. But changing over page by page is simply a recipe for sowing confusion, and i will continue to resist page-by-page conversion away from the largely uncontested and predominant de-facto standard.<br />
_ _ Even if you do manage a quick LoPbN-global changeover, i predict it will be a maintenance headache, and if i find the new inevitable hyphens (or em-spaces or worse) are not regularly cleaned up (which i predict will only occur if a bot is regularly used), i will ask myself that a bot driver act: to either take on the regular task, or convert the en-spaces back to the much more natural and more hand-maintainable hyphens.<br />

<p>BaronLarf, please see the talk page for <a href="../../../f/r/o/Frozen_custard.html" title="Frozen custard">frozen custard</a> for the justification for my edits--I really don't think the article is helped by naming prominent custard places in Milwaukee, or that a stand in Northern Virginia happens to be named "Milwaukee's Frozen Custard".

<p>Mr. BaronLarf While I duly appreciate the fact that you are an editor of sorts for Wikipedia, I can't help but hold the opinion that a prerequisite of such work, particularly before commencing in earnest upon the "improvement" any legislator's entry, is that you actually hold the merest of acquaintances with proper English spelling. For example, "Berceau" is not spelled "Burceau" as your improvement would have it. Moreover, "resident" is not spelled "recident" as per your correction. Neither is "science" spelled "sciene." Deleting the photo of the representive is inexplicable.</p>

The original article you created was not written in from a <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral point of view</a>, thus my rewrite.

<p>Dear Mr. BaronLarf,</p>
<p>The photo, to which to refer, is most definitely not a copyright infringment. I would know of such things, as it was taken by one, Brent Nicastro, photographer for the Democratic caucus of the Wisconsin State Legislature. We have his unreserved permission to use the image in whatever way we choose. If you desire further evidence to the fact, we would be happy to provide it. Do you have evidence otherwise? I would ask that you please restore it to the entry. It adds a nice touch.</p>
<p>While I could argue that nothing in our original entry was lacking in neutrality -- to which I can only assume that you mean non-partisan -- I fear that such a discussion would not bear fruit -- and so, I can live with those edits.</p>
<p>Oh, and I'll say "hi" to Terese for you, whoever you are.</p>

<p><a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESqueakBox_f62d.html" title="User:SqueakBox">User:SqueakBox</a> doesn't like me. He has insulted me in the past and, recently, he was blocked for posting the following insult in his <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESqueakBox_f62d.html" title="User:SqueakBox">user page</a>: "My greatest achievements here [...] have been [...] and restoring José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero from the POV of another user who claims to write about saints." (See the entry for August 21 in his <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:SqueakBox" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:SqueakBox" rel="nofollow">block log</a>) My nick, Hagiographer means just that, "to write about saints", so it's clear that comment is a direct attack against me. Furthermore, when I came to the article about Zapatero SqueakBox had already been banned from editing Zapatero's editing articles by the Arbitraton Committee (what can he restore?). And, in fact, I've never contributed or deleted information from any of those articles. I simply reverted some vandalism SqueakBox introduced as part of his harassment campaing against other user who was also banned by the same Arbitration Comittee decision. So, that paragraph is pure slander.</p>
<p>Taking <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a> into account, I believe that paragraph should be deleted or, at least, marked like what it is, a personal attack. I did just that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3ASqueakBox&amp;diff=71121865&amp;oldid=71011996here" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3ASqueakBox&amp;diff=71121865&amp;oldid=71011996here" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. However, SqueakBox removed it and <a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuettarda_9de6.html" title="User:Guettarda">User:Guettarda</a> protected the page <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3ASqueakBox&amp;diff=71242385&amp;oldid=71181172" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3ASqueakBox&amp;diff=71242385&amp;oldid=71181172" rel="nofollow">here</a>. SqueakBox has had a lot of problems with other users and, sometimes, Guettarda has taken part in them. For example, in <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESqueakBox_f62d.html" title="User:SqueakBox">User:SqueakBox</a> can be found a barnstar given by <a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuettarda_9de6.html" title="User:Guettarda">User:Guettarda</a> in which he says that SqueakBox has gone beyond the call of duty in his fight against "strange" people in the article <a href="../../../j/a/v/Javier_Solana_a15f.html" title="Javier Solana">Javier Solana</a>. <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a> states clearly that comments must be about content not users so it's clear that Guettarda and SqueakBox have cooperated in, at least, dubious actions against other users. It's also clear Guettarda is biased in favor of SqueakBox. In this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AHagiographer&amp;diff=73033267&amp;oldid=73007896" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AHagiographer&amp;diff=73033267&amp;oldid=73007896" rel="nofollow">edit</a> in my talk page, he implies that I like looking for conflict, that I'm obsessed with SqueakBox that I've to settle down and so on, all violation of <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> and unpleasant remarks.</p>
<p>It mustn't be forgotten that according to <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">WP:OWN</a>, user pages belong to everybody and I don't believe a wikipedian has any right to transform his user page in a platform to attack other users. So Guettarda's supposed protection of SqueakBox's user page (really of SqueakBox's insults) is very difficult to defend in my opinion.</p>
<p>I'm simply asking fair treatment. I don't believe I have to see how the Wikipedia is populated with insults against me. I believe SqueakBox can contribute useful edits without transforming his user page into a gallery of attacks. So please, either unprotect the page so <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">WP:OWN</a> can be applied, or remove the negative comment or mark it as a personal attack untolerable in the Wikipedia or, at least, explain to me why I have to bear that kind of treatment. SqueakBox has been blocked for that unpleasant remark, What is the use of blocking him and then keeping the insult?

<p>Thanks for uploading <b><a href="../../../p/e/r/Image%7EPerinsBadge.jpg_4943.html" title="Image:PerinsBadge.jpg">Image:PerinsBadge.jpg</a></b>. The image description page currently specifies that the image is non-free and may only be used on Wikipedia under a <a href="../../../f/u/_/WP%7EFU_03b9.html" title="WP:FU">claim of fair use</a>. However, the image is currently <a href="../../../o/_/_/WP%7EO_c91c.html" title="WP:O">orphaned</a>, meaning that it is not used in any articles on Wikipedia.
