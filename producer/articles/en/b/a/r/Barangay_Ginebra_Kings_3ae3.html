<p>Barangay Ginebra uses the trademark run-and-gun offense, which excites the fans during games. Defensively, they are known to play physical, employing a suffocating man-to-man defense. They are also known for their "never say die" attitude by coming back from deficits during games and upsetting better-ranked teams.</p>

<p>Joining the league in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1979_PBA_season_f3d5.html" title="1979 PBA season">1979</a>, it was known as <i>Gilbey's Gin</i> of then-owner Carlos Palanca Jr.'s La Tondeña franchise. Its first head coach was Pilo Pumaren and was bannered by former MICAA standout Willie Tanduyan and imports Larry McNeil and Dean Tolson. Gilbey's managed to placed fourth in the 1979 Invitational tournament.</p>
<p>Willie Generalao won the <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philippine_Basketball_Association_Rookie_of_the_Year_award_6e06.html" title="Philippine Basketball Association Rookie of the Year award">Rookie of the Year</a> honors during the <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980_PBA_season_fd04.html" title="1980 PBA season">1980</a> season as Gilbey's placed fourth in the All-Filipino tournament.</p>
<p>Gilbey's also changed its name one time as <i>St. George Whiskies</i> when they had a bunch of young teenagers acting as cheerleaders. <a href="http://mypba.com/forum/index.php?s=&amp;showtopic=9&amp;view=findpost&amp;p=13" class="external autonumber" title="http://mypba.com/forum/index.php?s=&amp;showtopic=9&amp;view=findpost&amp;p=13" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/8/1982_PBA_season_43c5.html" title="1982 PBA season">1982</a>, the Gins made it to their first Finals appearance during the Open Conference. But, they were swept by <a href="../../../t/o/y/Toyota_Basketball_Team_99b2.html" title="Toyota Basketball Team">Toyota</a> team of coach Ed Ocampo, <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Jaworski_f7b8.html" title="Robert Jaworski">Robert Jaworski</a>, and Ramon Fernandez.</p>
<p>Gilbey's made another Finals appearance in the <a href="../../../1/9/8/1983_PBA_season_b3a9.html" title="1983 PBA season">1983</a> All-Filipino but was also swept by Tommy Manotoc's <a href="../../../c/r/i/Crispa_Redmanizers_45ca.html" title="Crispa Redmanizers">Crispa Redmanizers</a> in the first of three titles won by the fabled Redmanizers squad.</p>
<p>Before the <a href="../../../1/9/8/1984_PBA_season_716a.html" title="1984 PBA season">1984 PBA season</a>, Toyota announced its departure from the league after winning nine titles in nine seasons. As part of an agreement with new team Beer Hausen, the rights of the Toyota players will be acquired by Beer Hausen. The team owned by <a href="../../../l/u/c/Lucio_Tan_2ad0.html" title="Lucio Tan">Lucio Tan</a> is entering its first year in the PBA.</p>
<p>Jaworski and backcourt partner Francis Arnaiz refused to join the Beer Hausen team. This further ingnited the internal Toyota feud between Jaworski and Fernandez which went on for the next several years. With this development, Gilbey's accepted Jaworski, Arnaiz and Arnie Tuadles to name a few while several Toyota players, led by Fernandez, joined Beer Hausen.</p>
<p>Gilbey's suffered another loss in the championship as the <a href="../../../c/r/i/Crispa_Redmanizers_45ca.html" title="Crispa Redmanizers">Crispa Redmanizers</a> defeated the Gins, 4-1, giving Crispa its last PBA title.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/r/Barangay_Ginebra_Kings_3ae3.html" title="Edit section: 1985-1987: Ginebra San Miguel">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">1985-1987: Ginebra San Miguel</span></h3>
<p>By <a href="../../../1/9/8/1985_PBA_season_5ee8.html" title="1985 PBA season">1985</a>, Gilbey's was renamed as Ginebra San Miguel. Following the recruitement of the immensely popular backcourt tandem of Robert Jaworski and <a href="../../../f/r/a/Francis_Arnaiz_af19.html" title="Francis Arnaiz">Francis Arnaiz</a>, the fanbase of Ginebra grew. These were mostly Toyota fans that followed the two stalwarts. (The precursor of the wild Baranggay Ginebra that cheered themselves hoarse in the rafters were the old raucous Toyota cheering squads that rumbled with Crispa fans in the rafters of the Araneta Coliseum). With Jaworski and Arnaiz at the forefront, Ginebra's fanbase grew larger. It grew as the ex Toyota backcourt infected the team with the legendary Toyota fighting spirit:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>In 1985, Ginebra established itself as the "people's team" when they displayed their never-say-die attitude on court. The biggest manifestation was when their leader, Jaworski came back from the nearby Medical City with seven stitches in his lip to lead the Gins to a come-from-behind victory against NCC. Jaworski incurred this from a wayward elbow inflicted by Jeff Moore in the second canto. But with them behind by 15 points going into the final seven minutes of the game, Jaworski re-entered the court and sparked a frenzy that to date, has yet been matched. The NCC team simply froze upon sight of the Big J and didn't know what hit them, eventually losing to the Gins.</i><a href="http://mypba.com/forum/index.php?s=&amp;showtopic=9&amp;view=findpost&amp;p=13" class="external autonumber" title="http://mypba.com/forum/index.php?s=&amp;showtopic=9&amp;view=findpost&amp;p=13" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></dd>
</dl>
<p>Despite the team's growing number of fan support, Ginebra failed to enter the finals in each of the three conferences in 1985, showing only a strong third place finish in the Reinforced Conference.</p>
<p>Michael Hackett also saw his name in the PBA record books by scoring 103 points in Ginebra's 197-168 victory against Great Taste on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_21.html" title="November 21">November 21</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1985.html" title="1985">1985</a>. This was later broken by Swift's <a href="../../../t/o/n/Tony_Harris_%28baskeball_player%29_a967.html" title="Tony Harris (baskeball player)">Tony Harris</a> in a <a href="../../../1/9/9/1992.html" title="1992">1992</a> game, against Ginebra.</p>
<p>Former Crispa import <a href="../../../b/i/l/Billy_Ray_Bates_0536.html" title="Billy Ray Bates">Billy Ray Bates</a> was brought in for the <a href="../../../1/9/8/1986_PBA_season_a86b.html" title="1986 PBA season">1986</a> Open Conference. Each PBA team was allowed to get two imports for the said conference. Bates' other partner was Michael Hackett, who was the <a href="../../../1/9/8/1985_PBA_season_5ee8.html" title="1985 PBA season">1985</a> Open Conference <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philippine_Basketball_Association_Best_Player_of_the_Conference_Award_f5ce.html" title="Philippine Basketball Association Best Player of the Conference Award">Best Import</a>. It is believed that the pair was the greatest import tandem in PBA history.</p>
<p>The super imports combined to lead Ginebra in the Finals of the tournament against the Lucio Tan franchise now known as Manila Beer, with the newly acquired Abet Guidaben and imports Michael Young and Harold Keeling. Bates and Hackett powered Ginebra to a convincing 4-1 win in the series to give the team its first-ever championship.</p>
<p>After the season, Francis Arnaiz suddenly left for the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> and ended his 11-year PBA career and popular backcourt tandem with Jaworski.</p>
<p><a name="1988-1990:_A.C3.B1ejo_Rhum_65"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/r/Barangay_Ginebra_Kings_3ae3.html" title="Edit section: 1988-1990: Añejo Rhum 65">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">1988-1990: Añejo Rhum 65</span></h3>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/8/1988_PBA_season_5699.html" title="1988 PBA season">1988</a>, Ginebra changed their name to <i>Añejo Rhum</i> with the team already gaining a rugged style of play. Añejo took on new team <a href="../../../p/u/r/Purefoods_Chunkee_Giants_e927.html" title="Purefoods Chunkee Giants">Purefoods</a> in the Finals of the All-Filipino Conference. Añejo won the series 3-1 over the young Purefoods team led by Jerry Codinera and Jojo Lastimosa (who had a confrontation with Jaworski). At that time Ramon Fernandez was benched by Purefoods management for alleged game-fixing. In the final game, three Ginebra players scored 25 points or more - Joey Loyzaga, Dondon Ampalayo and Sonny Jaworski as the Gins didn't allow the then rookie-laden Purefoods team to gain confidence, winning by a comfortable 9 point margin. Of course, the game was close all throughout until the final 3 minutes of the game when Loyzaga and Jaworski uncorked timely 3 pointers that sealed the fate of Purefoods.<a href="http://mypba.com/forum/index.php?s=&amp;showtopic=9&amp;view=findpost&amp;p=18" class="external autonumber" title="http://mypba.com/forum/index.php?s=&amp;showtopic=9&amp;view=findpost&amp;p=18" rel="nofollow">[3]</a></p>
<p>In the season-ending Reinforced Conference wherein teams were allowed two imports each, Añejo again hired the great Billy Ray Bates and paired him with soon-to-be Boston Celtics starter Kevin Gamble. But at this time, Bates was fading and was clearly just a shadow of his old self. After only four games, PBA's "greatest import ever" was sent home for good. Añejo would finish the season with the exciting and high-scoring duo of "Jumpin'" Joe Ward and Tommy Davis as imports.</p>
<p>On the next season, Añejo lost in five games to the <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grand_Slam_%28PBA%29_555d.html" title="Grand Slam (PBA)">grand slam</a> winning <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Miguel_Beermen_0c7b.html" title="San Miguel Beermen">San Miguel Beer</a> in the Third (Reinforced) Conference. In that Conference, Añejo paraded another super import in Carlos Briggs who easily bagged the Best Import Award.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990_PBA_season_a81e.html" title="1990 PBA season">1990</a>, Añejo entered the finals of the First Conference against <a href="../../../b/e/n/Benjie_Paras_c541.html" title="Benjie Paras">Benjie Paras</a> and the <a href="../../../s/h/e/Shell_Turbo_Chargers_f45f.html" title="Shell Turbo Chargers">Shell Rimula X</a> team. In Game Six, with Shell already leading the series 3-2, Añejo protested a foul on Rey Cuenco with a few minutes left in the second quarter. This led to the infamous walk out of Añejo. The team also complained about the unfavorable officiating as the team had more fouls than Shell. In the end, the game was forfeited and awarded the title to Shell.</p>
<p>The result of this event gave the team a fine of more <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philippine_peso.html" title="Philippine peso">PHP</a> 500,000 which was then the highest fine in league history.</p>

<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/9/1991_PBA_season_2a06.html" title="1991 PBA season">1991</a>, Añejo reverted back to Ginebra. They met <a href="../../../s/h/e/Shell_Turbo_Chargers_f45f.html" title="Shell Turbo Chargers">Shell</a> once again in the 1991 First Conference title series. Shell got the upper hand by taking a 3-1 series, needing only a win to clinch the series. But Ginebra managed a furious comeback to force a seventh game. In the final seconds of Game 7, an off-balanced shot by Rudy Distrito with a second remaining sealed Ginebra's third PBA title and completed one of the greatest comebacks in PBA history.</p>
<p>Ginebra placed third in the <a href="../../../1/9/9/1992_PBA_season_3be4.html" title="1992 PBA season">1992</a> Third Conference but at that time the team was starting to fade.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/9/1993_PBA_season_de49.html" title="1993 PBA season">1993</a>, Ginebra compiled a record of 9-26 win-loss slate in all three conferences. This horrible performance gave them the top pick in the next draft.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/9/1994_PBA_season_5d0a.html" title="1994 PBA season">1994</a>, in an effort to change their fortunes, the team was renamed as <i>Tondeña Rhum 65</i>. The team selected Noli Locsin with their first pick, and was hoped by many fans to save the team for the season. But Tondeña's struggles continued, winning just 12 of the 32 games that year.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/9/1995_PBA_season_5e66.html" title="1995 PBA season">1995</a>, the team reverted again to Ginebra. They selected 7-0 center <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_Joseph_Feihl_16e1.html" title="Edward Joseph Feihl">Edward Joseph Feihl</a> and also drafted Jaworski's son, Robert Jr. Unfortunately, misfortunes still struck the team as Ginebra won only 5 of the 30 games played that year.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/9/1996_PBA_season_3ac1.html" title="1996 PBA season">1996</a>, Ginebra used the top overall pick to draft controversial center <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marlou_Aquino_6143.html" title="Marlou Aquino">Marlou Aquino</a> from <a href="../../../a/d/a/Adamson_University_244b.html" title="Adamson University">Adamson University</a>. Aquino was a big star in the PBL for Nikon and Stag Pale Pilsen but was involved in a controversial scandal in terms of his academic status with Adamson although it was somewhat neglected when he jumped pro. Aquino showed the promise Ginebra fans expected during the All-Filipino Conference as Ginebra won fourth place that tournament. It also showed the discovery of former <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Santo_Tomas_7726.html" title="University of Santo Tomas">University of Santo Tomas</a> point guard Bal David as one of the team's popular players along with Vince Hizon, Jayvee Gayoso and Pido Jarencio.</p>
<p>In the Commissioner's Cup, the team was paraded by NBA veteran Henry James as Ginebra wound up in a knockout match against familiar rival Formula Shell. Kenny Redfield's buzzer-beating three enabled Formula Shell to enter the finals. Ginebra finally entered the Finals of the Governors Cup but lost to the <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grand_Slam_%28PBA%29_555d.html" title="Grand Slam (PBA)">grand slam</a> winning <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alaska_Aces_%28PBA%29_6d15.html" title="Alaska Aces (PBA)">Alaska Milkmen</a> in five games.</p>
<p>Aquino's impact on Ginebra gave the team a 30-game improvement from a year ago and was named as the <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philippine_Basketball_Association_Rookie_of_the_Year_award_6e06.html" title="Philippine Basketball Association Rookie of the Year award">Rookie of the Year</a>.</p>

<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/9/1997_PBA_season_7748.html" title="1997 PBA season">1997</a>, Ginebra was renamed once again, this time as the <i>Gordon's Gin Boars</i>. Gordon's was now considered as a title favorite for the league's 23rd season.</p>
<p>One of the most memorable shots in team history was Bal David's final second heave from half-court to defeat San Miguel by a point during the All-Filipino Cup.</p>
<p>Gordon's entered the Finals of the All-Filipino against the <a href="../../../p/u/r/Purefoods_Chunkee_Giants_e927.html" title="Purefoods Chunkee Giants">Purefoods Corned Beef Cowboys</a>. Purefoods managed to take a 3-1 series lead. In Game Five, they were about to score a winning basket after a Gordon's turnover. But Vince Hizon blocked Dindo Pumaren's layup, as the Boars lived another day. Unfortunately, in Game Six, the strong performance of <a href="../../../a/l/v/Alvin_Patrimonio_c4c1.html" title="Alvin Patrimonio">Alvin Patrimonio</a> and company denied Gordon's a title losing the series 4-2. The loss marked Jaworski's (playing coach) last game with the La Tondeña franchise and did not enter himself in a game since.</p>
<p>In the Commissioner's Cup, NBA veteran <a href="../../../c/h/r/Chris_King_d2f5.html" title="Chris King">Chris King</a> became a replacement in time for the semis of the tournament. Gordon's met sister-team <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Miguel_Beermen_0c7b.html" title="San Miguel Beermen">San Miguel</a> in a knockout semifinal match. It was a true classic game that went to double overtime and saw several comebacks by Gordon's. The Boars won, 105-101, to meet <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alaska_Aces_%28PBA%29_6d15.html" title="Alaska Aces (PBA)">Alaska</a> in the finals. Gordon's eventually defeated Alaska in six games for their first title in six years. Jaworski got into the mic and thanked the Gordon's Gin fans for their support.</p>
<p>Expectations were high for the Governor's Cup, but they were eliminated by <a href="../../../s/t/a/Sta._Lucia_Realtors_153d.html" title="Sta. Lucia Realtors">Sta. Lucia</a> in the quarterfinals.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/9/1998_PBA_season_8e47.html" title="1998 PBA season">1998</a>, Jaworski ran for a <a href="../../../s/e/n/Senate_of_the_Philippines_8f73.html" title="Senate of the Philippines">senatorial seat</a> for the elections which he won by a lot of votes. This led to a conflict between Jaworski's role in the Senate and his role as coach of Ginebra (named during the Commissioner's Cup). Assistant Rino Salazar was named as interim at one point. Ginebra still struggled despite the addition of Bong Alvarez to the team.</p>
<p>That year, <a href="../../../d/a/n/Danding_Cojuangco_d4cb.html" title="Danding Cojuangco">Danding Cojuangco</a> regained ownership of <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Miguel_Corporation_c614.html" title="San Miguel Corporation">San Miguel Corporation</a>. One of the moves the team made was adding <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allan_Caidic_1e5c.html" title="Allan Caidic">Allan Caidic</a> from San Miguel Beer. This caused a rift between Jaworski and the new management because he was not informed of the move. In a press conference held at the Senate, Jaworski resigned as playing coach of Ginebra.</p>
<p>To this day, Jaworski hasn't announced his retirement, but before he quit his post, he was considered the oldest basketball player on any roster at 52 years of age.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/r/Barangay_Ginebra_Kings_3ae3.html" title="Edit section: 1999-Present: Barangay Ginebra Kings">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">1999-Present: Barangay Ginebra Kings</span></h3>
<p>After <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Jaworski_f7b8.html" title="Robert Jaworski">Jaworski</a> left, the team still enjoyed popularity. The chant of <i>Ginebra! Ginebra!</i> filled the air wherever the team was playing. It is said that their fans can compose a <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barangay.html" title="Barangay">barangay</a>, hence the phrase <i>Barangay Ginebra</i> came into being to denote the team's legions of fans.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/9/1999_PBA_season_4486.html" title="1999 PBA season">1999</a>, the team was then officially called <i>Barangay Ginebra</i>. Now, "Barangay Ginebra" did not only denote to the fans of the team, but to the club as well. It is often said that wherever Ginebra plays, they have a homecourt advantage.</p>
<p>In the All-Filipino, Brgy. Ginebra only managed to finish 8th in the eliminations, and needed to win twice against the first-seeded <a href="../../../t/a/l/Talk_N%27_Text_Phone_Pals_079e.html" title="Talk N' Text Phone Pals">Mobiline Phone Pals</a> team of <a href="../../../a/s/i/Asi_Taulava_e6e9.html" title="Asi Taulava">Asi Taulava</a>. The Kings managed to forced a knockout match, winning the first game. In the decider, Brgy. Ginebra came back from a 20 point deficit and Bal David's off-balance game-winner resulted in one of the biggest upsets in league history to advance to the next round. Taulava was seen crying in disappointment after the game. In the semis, they were eliminated by eventual champion <a href="../../../s/h/e/Shell_Turbo_Chargers_f45f.html" title="Shell Turbo Chargers">Shell</a> that was marred by a scuffle in Game One of the series.</p>
<p>Noli Locsin was later traded to Pop Cola for the acrobatic Vergel Meneses but it still didn't help the Kings throughout the season. Allan Caidic replaced Rino Salazar as the team's head coach. In the offseason, Marlou Aquino was also traded, this time to <a href="../../../s/t/a/Sta._Lucia_Realtors_153d.html" title="Sta. Lucia Realtors">Sta Lucia</a> for Jun Limpot.</p>
<p>Brgy. Ginebra was eliminated early in the quarterfinals by <a href="../../../t/a/n/Tanduay_Rhum_Masters_5fd1.html" title="Tanduay Rhum Masters">Tanduay</a> in the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2000.html" title="2000">2000</a> All-Filipino Cup as well as the Commissioner's Cup. With Brian Green as import for the Governors' Cup, the Kings tried to repeat the same result of the <a href="../../../1/9/9/1999.html" title="1999">1999</a> All-Filipino against <a href="../../../t/a/l/Talk_N%27_Text_Phone_Pals_079e.html" title="Talk N' Text Phone Pals">Mobiline</a>. But the Phone Pals were able to beat Brgy. Ginebra in the knockout match.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../2/0/0/2001_PBA_season_e90c.html" title="2001 PBA season">2001</a>, Barangay Ginebra drafted Filipino-American <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mark_Caguioa_28a5.html" title="Mark Caguioa">Mark Caguioa</a>, a virtual unknown in the Philippine basketball scene. Despite that, Caguioa showed brilliance during the All-Filipino, earning his current nickname <i>The Spark</i>. The Kings finished 5th in the eliminations and faced Purefoods, who had a twice-to-beat advantage, in the quarterfinals. In a repeat of the events of two years ago, the Kings were able to defeat the TJ Hotdogs twice, after an off-balanced game-winner by Ronald Magtulis, to enter the semis. The Kings faced Shell in a five-game affair, and Brgy. Ginebra upset the top-seeded Turbo Chargers in five games to meet sister team <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Miguel_Beermen_0c7b.html" title="San Miguel Beermen">San Miguel</a> in the finals. Barangay Ginebra trailed 0-2 but won the next two games to tie the series at 2-2. In the end though, the Beermen won the series in six games.</p>
<p>Ginebra's success in the All-Filipino were not duplicated in the import-laced Commissioner's and Governor's Cup as they were eliminated in the quarterfinals.</p>
<p>After the season, the Kings acquired <a href="../../../e/r/i/Eric_Menk_d219.html" title="Eric Menk">Eric Menk</a> from Tanduay to solidy their frontline for the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002_PBA_season_d705.html" title="2002 PBA season">2002</a> season. Unfortunately, Menk was loaned to the Philippine team and the Kings struggled throughout the Governor's and Commissioner's Cups, once again failing to enter the semis. In the All-Filipino, Menk made his Ginebra debut but the team did not enter the quarterfinals.</p>
<p><a href="../../../r/o/m/Rommel_Adducul_f702.html" title="Rommel Adducul">Rommel Adducul</a> finally made his PBA debut after his years with the <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metropolitan_Basketball_Association_7402.html" title="Metropolitan Basketball Association">Metropolitan Basketball Association</a>. Barangay Ginebra selected the former <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Sebastian_College_-_Recoletos_ed2f.html" title="San Sebastian College - Recoletos">San Sebastian College - Recoletos</a> Stag as the No. 2 pick in the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003_PBA_season_7a08.html" title="2003 PBA season">2003</a> draft. His addition though, did not help Ginebra's fortune to change for the 29th season. In the All-Filipino conference, they were eliminated by eventual champions, <a href="../../../t/a/l/Talk_N%27_Text_Phone_Pals_079e.html" title="Talk N' Text Phone Pals">Talk N' Text Phone Pals</a> in the quarterfinals. They also failed to qualify for the Invitational tournament, after being eliminated by eventual champions, <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alaska_Aces_%28PBA%29_6d15.html" title="Alaska Aces (PBA)">Alaska Aces</a> in the qualifying rounds. In the season ending Reinforced Conference, they were knocked out by sister team and eventual champions, <a href="../../../c/o/c/Coca_Cola_Tigers_4151.html" title="Coca Cola Tigers">Coca Cola Tigers</a> in the quarterfinals.</p>

<p>At the start of the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004_PBA_Fiesta_Conference_fc36.html" title="2004 PBA Fiesta Conference">2004 PBA Fiesta Conference</a>, Caidic was promoted to team manager and was replaced by former San Miguel assistant coach Siot Tanquincen. One of Tanquincen's best moves was to give more playing time to comebacking Jayjay Helterbrand over veteran Bal David, who was nursing an injury. His partnership with Mark Caguioa was later dubbed by <a href="../../../a/s/s/Associated_Broadcasting_Company_3ed3.html" title="Associated Broadcasting Company">ABC Sports</a> commentators as the "Fast and the Furious." The team also traded Jun Limpot and Rob Johnson to sister team Purefoods in exchange for Rodney Santos and Andy Seigle. The changes helped Ginebra to become a strong team during the season.</p>
<p>And in <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_7.html" title="July 7">July 7</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>, Barangay Ginebra ended a 7-year title drought when they defeated <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_Bull_Barako_56e2.html" title="Red Bull Barako">Red Bull Barako</a> in a best of 5 finals, 3-1, capturing the transition 2004 Fiesta Conference. During that time, Torraye Braggs was their import player. It was actually a total miracle as the team was only seeded 7th after the classification rounds. In the sudden death wildcard phase, they came back from a 21-point deficit to beat the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Sta._Lucia_Realtors_153d.html" title="Sta. Lucia Realtors">Sta. Lucia Realtors</a>. In the quarterfinal round, they had a 2-1 record, good enough to make it to the semifinals.

They dethroned the defending champions <a href="../../../t/a/l/Talk_N%27_Text_Phone_Pals_079e.html" title="Talk N' Text Phone Pals">Talk N' Text Phone Pals</a>, 4-2, in a controversial best of 7 Finals series. Game One was forfeited in favor of Ginebra when Phone Pals star center Asi Taulava, who was ineligible to play, entered the game. His citizenship case was still on the Bureau of Immigration and Deportation. The Kings filed a protest prior to the start of game one. Barangay Ginebra carried the momentum and went on to win the championship. This was also the first time in franchise history that they won back-to-back championships.</p>

And it proved to be costly too, as Red Bull would go on to master Ginebra in the next 3 conferences that would follow after the Kings' back-to-back championships, denying the Kings numerous chances to rewrite history.</p>

<p>They faced <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_Bull_Barako_56e2.html" title="Red Bull Barako">Red Bull Barako</a> themselves in the semifinals, and eventually lost in the series, 4-3. But the Kings showed real fighting heart as they came back and tied the series, after being down 1-3.

<p>After the series, coach Siot Tanquincen, apologized to the legion of the team's fans. It was also revealed that Mark Caguioa was playing hurt and had a hamstring injury throughout the series. Barangay Ginebra battled <a href="../../../a/i/r/Air21_Express_e06a.html" title="Air21 Express">Air21 Express</a> for 3rd place honors but lost. In that game, an evidently lackluster Barangay Ginebra team played, which was believed to be still emotionally down from their game 7 defeat. <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_Bull_Barako_56e2.html" title="Red Bull Barako">Red Bull Barako</a> eventually won the championship against the <a href="../../../p/u/r/Purefoods_Chunkee_Giants_e927.html" title="Purefoods Chunkee Giants">Purefoods Chunkee Giants</a> in six games.</p>

Being defending champions, they were considered as favorites to win the tournament. Unfortunately, injuries haunted the team as players began to fall one by one. All-stars Eric Menk and Rommel Adducul and role players Rodney Santos and Andy Seigle all suffered injuries during the conference. The Kings made a gallant stand in the wildcard phase as role players Manny Ramos, Allan Salansang, Ervin Sotto and Mark Macapagal, were able to step up their games. Ginebra took the sixth and final spot in the quarterfinals after defeating Air21 on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_4.html" title="June 4">June 4</a> with a 118-114 overtime victory as Mark Caguioa recorded a new career-high with 45 points.</p>
<p>However, the Kings still fell short as they were eliminated in the quarterfinals by Red Bull, 3-2.

The third part was voided by Commissioner <a href="../../../n/o/l/Noli_Eala_fe0e.html" title="Noli Eala">Noli Eala</a>, which would have allowed the Express to regain its own 2007 and 2008 picks plus the Tigers' 2008 second round draft pick from Coke, in exchange for Ferreria and Ramos plus the second-round pick this year and the future first-round pick. <a href="../../../a/i/r/Air21_Express_e06a.html" title="Air21 Express">Air21</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/c/Coca-Cola_Tigers_cae2.html" title="Coca-Cola Tigers">Coca-Cola</a> submitted a revised version of that part of the trade and was approved by Commissioner Eala.</p>
<p>Under the revised version, the Express will trade Manny Ramos and Kalani Ferreria plus two second-round picks acquired from <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Miguel_Beermen_0c7b.html" title="San Miguel Beermen">San Miguel</a> and Ginebra to the Tigers. The Tigers retained <a href="../../../a/i/r/Air21_Express_e06a.html" title="Air21 Express">Air21</a>'s 2007 and 2008 first-round picks but traded away their 2008 and 2009 first-round picks.</p>
<p>The trade has been questioned by many within the league as a one-sided trade. It also speculated the rumors of Coca-Cola's possible disbandment from the league, which was denied in a statement released last August 2, 2006 by Bobby Huang, president of Coca-Cola Bottlers Philippines Inc.(CCBPI) and PBA governor for the <a href="../../../c/o/c/Coca-Cola_Tigers_cae2.html" title="Coca-Cola Tigers">Coca-Cola Tigers</a>.</p>
<p>Also, the coaching staff underwent a major revamp with Jong Uichico, from sister team <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Miguel_Beermen_0c7b.html" title="San Miguel Beermen">San Miguel Beer</a>, taking over coaching duties from Siot Tanquincen. Tanquincen will slide down as assistant coach, along with Art Dela Cruz and Junno Sauler. Dela Cruz is also from <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Miguel_Beermen_0c7b.html" title="San Miguel Beermen">San Miguel Beer</a>, having served as assistant coach, while Sauler is a holdover from Tanquincen's coaching staff. Uichico, Tanquincen, and Dela Cruz powered San Miguel Beer in their late-90s championship run and also helped win their 17th title.</p>
<p>As part of their preparations for the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006-07_PBA_season_ba17.html" title="2006-07 PBA season">2006-07 PBA season</a>, the team competed in the 6th Shell Rimula Brunei Cup but failed to make it to the semis after losing close games. They started the <a href="../../../p/b/a/PBA_b8e6.html" title="PBA">PBA</a> pre-season tournament with a 90-75 drubbling of <a href="../../../p/u/r/Purefoods_Chunkee_Giants_e927.html" title="Purefoods Chunkee Giants">Purefoods</a>,<a href="http://pba.ph/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1162&amp;Itemid=59" class="external autonumber" title="http://pba.ph/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1162&amp;Itemid=59" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> but failed to advance to the pre-season finals due to an inferior record of only 2-2.</p>
<p>Rudy Hatfield made a comeback from years of absence and he decided to play for Ginebra alongside with his best friend, Eric Menk.</p>
<p>Coca-cola released Johnny Abarrientos 2 weeks before the start of PBA and Ginebra was able to catch him as back-up guard for Jayjay Helterbrand. His court generalship will be additional factor as Kings' powerhouse line-up.</p>

<p>In the season opener, the Kings defeated the expansion <a href="../../../w/e/l/Welcoat_Dragons_e464.html" title="Welcoat Dragons">Welcoat Dragons</a> 102-69 on October 1. Two victories over sister team Purefoods and Air21 gave Ginebra an early 3-0 record before being defeated by Red Bull in a hyped matchup on October 15.</p>
<p><a href="../../../r/o/m/Rommel_Adducul_f702.html" title="Rommel Adducul">Rommel Adducul</a> was later sent to the San Miguel Beermen as part of a three-team deal which involved Red Bull, a non-SMC squad.<a href="http://pba.ph/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1229&amp;Itemid=82" class="external autonumber" title="http://pba.ph/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1229&amp;Itemid=82" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> Ironically, the following game saw the two sister teams face off at the <a href="../../../c/u/n/Cuneta_Astrodome_3370.html" title="Cuneta Astrodome">Cuneta Astrodome</a>, in a game which the Beermen edged 101-97 in overtime, after leading by as much as 20 points during the regulation period.

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/r/Barangay_Ginebra_Kings_3ae3.html" title="Edit section: Controversies">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Controversies</span></h2>
<p>Over the last few years, Ginebra has been involved in several incidents involving players and the team itself.</p>
<ul>
<li>Jaworski and Fernandez, two former Toyota teammates, engaged in a well-publicized feud in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1984_PBA_season_716a.html" title="1984 PBA season">1984</a>. Apparently, Toyota's players were sold to new team Beer Hausen. Jaworski, in utter defiance, refused to play for Beer Hausen and joined Ginebra. The franchise sell out was the final straw in the 2 year silent feud of Jaworski and Fernandez within Toyota. It finally exploded into a full out war between the two. However, in the <a href="../../../1/9/8/1989_PBA_season_e028.html" title="1989 PBA season">1989</a> All-Star Game, Jaworski and Fernandez were teammates for the Veterans. In the final seconds, with the game tied, Jaworski's pass to Fernandez led to the Veterans escaping a 132-130 win against the Rookies-Sophomores-Juniors team in the inaugural All-Star Game. Afterwards, Jawo and Fernadez shook hands to the delight of the capacity crowd at <a href="../../../p/h/i/PhilSports_Arena_0465.html" title="PhilSports Arena">ULTRA</a>, now PhilSports Arena, which signalled the reconcillation between the two legends.</li>
<li>On <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_15.html" title="May 15">May 15</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990.html" title="1990">1990</a>, Shell defeated Anejo Rhum 4-2 to win the 1990 PBA 1st Conference title. However, it sparked a controversy in the sixth and final game of the series when the whole Anejo team walked out with still 2:52 left in the second quarter in favor of the Zoom Masters. Back-to-back technical fouls were slapped by referee Rudy Hins on Rey Cuenco led to the walkout, as loyal Anejo fans peltered the court with debris. Coach Robert Jaworski and team manager Ber Navarro refused to return back to the playing court, which to the forfeiture of the match, and the championship to Shell. Two days later, the league fined Anejo a whopping 550,000 <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philippine_peso.html" title="Philippine peso">pesos</a>, the biggest in league history. It was the second time that a forfeiture happened in a PBA Finals series since <a href="../../../c/r/i/Crispa_Redmanizers_45ca.html" title="Crispa Redmanizers">Crispa</a> in Game four of the 1975 series against rival <a href="../../../t/o/y/Toyota_Basketball_Team_99b2.html" title="Toyota Basketball Team">Toyota</a>.</li>
<li>Robert Jaworski resigned as player-coach of the team after the <a href="../../../1/9/9/1998_PBA_season_8e47.html" title="1998 PBA season">1998</a> due to misunderstandings with the new management of <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Miguel_Corporation_c614.html" title="San Miguel Corporation">San Miguel Corporation</a>. It is claimed that the newly-elected Senator was frustrated over the company's acquisition of <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allan_Caidic_1e5c.html" title="Allan Caidic">Allan Caidic</a> as the new assistant-playing coach from San Miguel without a prior notice from the famed coach.</li>
<li>On <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_17.html" title="May 17">May 17</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1999.html" title="1999">1999</a>, a bench-clearing brawl ensured during Game two of the All-Filipino Cup semi-finals series against <a href="../../../s/h/e/Shell_Turbo_Chargers_f45f.html" title="Shell Turbo Chargers">Formula Shell</a>. A total of 235,000 pesos was slapped on 16 players and one official from both teams. Shell's Jay Mendoza was fined 40,000 pesos, while Ginebra players Noli Locsin, Elmer Lago, Cris Bolado and Boy Valera were fined 20,000 each.</li>
<li>Ginebra fans are known for peltering debris whenever they felt that officiating was poor. It was joked by many that the coins that the fans threw are collected by the referees. However, it is somewhat rare to see such incidents these days due to either proper security measures, especially at the privately-owned <a href="../../../a/r/a/Araneta_Coliseum_0ddc.html" title="Araneta Coliseum">Araneta Coliseum</a> or the poor attendance that the league has been suffering.</li>
<li>In the 2005 PBA Philippine Cup Finals, Barangay Ginebra was awarded the winner of the first game of the series, after Finals opponent <a href="../../../t/a/l/Talk_N%27_Text_Phone_Pals_079e.html" title="Talk N' Text Phone Pals">Talk N' Text Phone Pals</a> fielded suspended cager <a href="../../../a/s/i/Asi_Taulava_e6e9.html" title="Asi Taulava">Asi Taulava</a>. With documents of his Filipino blood still questionable, the Phone Pals used the 6-9 center in their convincing double-digit victory. The Kings filed a protest prior to the start of the game. Two days later, PBA Commissioner <a href="../../../n/o/l/Noli_Eala_fe0e.html" title="Noli Eala">Noli Eala</a> announced the forfeiture of Talk N' Text's Game one victory.</li>

<ul>
<li>Gary Granada, a well-known composer and singer in the Philippines, composed two songs about the Kings; <i>"Kapag Nanalo ang Ginebra"</i> (When Ginebra Wins) sung by <a href="../../../b/a/y/Bayang_Barrios_5ac6.html" title="Bayang Barrios">Bayang Barrios</a>, and <i>Kapag Natatalo ang Ginebra</i> (When Ginebra Loses), sung by himself. The songs became popular in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1996.html" title="1996">1996</a> and somewhat became the "official anthem" of Ginebra fans.</li>
<li>Ginebra is the first of only two teams to have ever come back from a 1-3 series deficit and won the series. They did it wayback in the 1991 First Conference against Shell. Purefoods was the other team to do so. They duplicated the feat just recently against Alaska in the semis of the 2005-2006 Philippine Cup.</li>
