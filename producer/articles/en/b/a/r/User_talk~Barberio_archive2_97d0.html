<p>Jon Postel was <i>never</i> an employee of the DoD. He worked for the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Southern_California_4e4b.html" title="University of Southern California">University of Southern California</a>. The exact copyright status of anything he produced would depend on details of the contract between DARPA and USC. I don't know those details, but I can tell you (from experience at MIT) that it was quite common for such material <i>not</i> to be in the public domain. Hence your modification to the copyright tag was completely inappropriate. (And anyway, you shouldn't be changing the copyright status tag on an image someone else uploaded, an image you don't have a clue about the copyright status of.) Please stop meddling with things which you don't have knowledge of. <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 07:50, 31 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Accepting a DOD grant ties you to legal obligations to the DOD to provide them with research, such as a requirment to disclose any patentable invention created during the research, and a requirment to grant licence to any research product, and disclosure of patentable items as with any employed contractor. (See University and Small Business Patent Procedures Act) The DOD may also take a contractual aquisition order if the reseach is directed to the creation of item or items to further the goals of the US. (See DoDGARS) It would be perfectly resionable use of language to say 'Dr. X was employed in a research project to the DOD'. Products of ARPANET research are thus products of someone Employed by the DOD. --<a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarberio_8f89.html" title="User:Barberio">John R.

<dd>I am reasonably aware of US Govt procurement regulations (although not in detail, and also you're probably looking at the current regs, not the circa-'82 regs which would apply), which is why I said on the image page that it was 'probably publicly available' (or words to that effect). (Also, note that those terms say the work product has to be made available to the <i>government</i> for free - it says nothing of making them available to private individuals. IIRC, the terms <i>do</i> differ between <i>patents</i>, and other intellectual property, such as <i>documents</i>, though; the latter are often required to be made publicly available.) However, without knowing the exact circumstances in which it was created (e.g., maybe Jon did it in his spare time, not during paid work hours - and we'll never know now, as Jon is gone), and the exact details of the contract (you can get waivers from those terms), it is not certain.</dd>
<dd>That's a diffent point from the employment issue, though: legally (i.e. not in colloquial or informal terms) Jon, Peter and I all worked for private organizations (in various countries) which had a contractual relationship with the US government. I.e. we were all no more "government employees" than someone working for any company which has a contractual relationship with a government to supply any given service or product. Joe Bloggs who works for British Leyland (do they still exist?) is not a "government employee" because he's making trucks that the MoD has contracted for.</dd>
<dd>It does make a <i>big</i> difference exactly who one does legally work for when it comes to these legal issues; e.g. as an MIT employee, I received a share of royalty income from patents filed by MIT on things that were created in the course of doing government-funded research. Such would not have been the case for government employees (except in very unusual circumstances, such as the grants to various people such as Watson-Watt, Whittle, Turing etc by the Royal Commission after WWII). <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 18:12, 31 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Tell you what, why don't you back off editing it until you've read all the major histories, and also studied the history of networking, and don't keep making all sorts of beginner's mistakes (like thinking the '82 map shows the MILNET - which didn't even <i>exist</i> in '82). <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 00:08, 15 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I protected at Noel's request. I don't think protecting an article escalates conflict. It forces everyone to take a deep breath and explain what they're thinking, rather than just reverting back and forth. If you want to start arguing, instead, about whose fault the protection is, go ahead, but that doesn't seem terribly productive to me. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john</a> <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Kenney_ebe6.html" title="User talk:John Kenney">k</a> 19:45, 15 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
