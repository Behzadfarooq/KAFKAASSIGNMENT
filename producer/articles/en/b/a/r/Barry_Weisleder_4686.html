<p><b>Barry Weisleder</b> (born <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_15.html" title="January 15">January 15</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/5/1953.html" title="1953">1953</a>) is a <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canadian</a> <a href="../../../t/r/o/Trotskyism.html" title="Trotskyism">Trotskyist</a> political activist.</p>
<p>Weisleder became a student activist in <a href="../../../h/i/g/High_school.html" title="High school">high school</a> through his involvement in the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Left_1a8c.html" title="New Left">New Left</a> League for Student Democracy (LSD) in <a href="../../../t/o/r/Toronto.html" title="Toronto">Toronto</a>. He served a year as president of the student council at Sir Sanford Fleming Secondary School in <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_York%2C_Ontario_62de.html" title="North York, Ontario">North York</a>. He joined the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Democratic_Party_ef87.html" title="New Democratic Party">New Democratic Party</a> (NDP) in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1968.html" title="1968">1968</a>, and was elected president of the <a href="../../../o/n/t/Ontario_New_Democratic_Youth_0e48.html" title="Ontario New Democratic Youth">youth wing</a> of the <a href="../../../o/n/t/Ontario_New_Democratic_Party_0991.html" title="Ontario New Democratic Party">Ontario New Democratic Party</a> in the early <a href="../../../1/9/7/1971.html" title="1971">1971</a>. In the early 1970s, Weisleder joined the <a href="../../../t/r/o/Trotskyism.html" title="Trotskyism">Trotskyist</a> group at the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Toronto_e570.html" title="University of Toronto">University of Toronto</a> that published the <i>Old Mole</i> newspaper. The group, initially also known as the "Old Mole", became the <a href="../../../r/e/v/Revolutionary_Marxist_Group_%28Canada%29_6362.html" title="Revolutionary Marxist Group (Canada)">Revolutionary Marxist Group</a> (RMG). Weisleder was the RMG's candidate in the <a href="../../../o/n/t/Ontario_general_election%2C_1977.html" title="Ontario general election, 1977">1977 Ontario provincial election</a> in the <a href="../../../r/i/d/Riding.html" title="Riding">riding</a> of <a href="../../../r/i/v/Riverdale.html" title="Riverdale">Riverdale</a>, and received 117 votes. The election was won by <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Alexander_Renwick_b8b3.html" title="James Alexander Renwick">James Renwick</a> of the NDP.</p>
<p>He became a member of the <a href="../../../r/e/v/Revolutionary_Workers_League_%28Canada%29_8476.html" title="Revolutionary Workers League (Canada)">Revolutionary Workers League</a> (RWL) at its creation out of the merger of the RMG and the <a href="../../../l/e/a/League_for_Socialist_Action_%28Canada%29_d40d.html" title="League for Socialist Action (Canada)">League for Socialist Action</a>, and moved to <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winnipeg%2C_Manitoba_55db.html" title="Winnipeg, Manitoba">Winnipeg, Manitoba</a> for a period.</p>
<p>Weisleder received his <a href="../../../b/a/c/Bachelor_of_Education_7b83.html" title="Bachelor of Education">Bachelor of Education</a> degree from the University of Toronto in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1976.html" title="1976">1976</a>, and found work in a Winnipeg tractor factory and at McDonald-Douglas aircraft in Toronto. Weisleder later found employment as a <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supply_teacher.html" title="Supply teacher">supply teacher</a> in the early 1980s, and organized a <a href="../../../t/r/a/Trade_union.html" title="Trade union">trade union</a> for supply teachers in Toronto with the <a href="../../../o/n/t/Ontario_Public_Service_Employees_Union_df94.html" title="Ontario Public Service Employees Union">Ontario Public Service Employees Union</a>. He became president of the new union local, OPSEU 595, when it was chartered in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1984.html" title="1984">1984</a>, and led it in a <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990.html" title="1990">1990</a> strike against the Toronto school board.</p>
<p>Weisleder resigned from the RWL in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1982.html" title="1982">1982</a> just prior to an exodus of Trotskyists who were expelled or forced out of the group when it moved away from Trotskyism. At his departure, he accused the group of becoming an undemocratic and sterile organization. The RWL had previously refused to endorse his union for supply teachers, claiming that it conflicted with their focus on industrial labour. Weisleder also accused the RWL of turning its back on one of its members, an <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armenia.html" title="Armenia">Armenian</a> political activist who had been accused of <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terrorism.html" title="Terrorism">terrorist</a> activities.</p>
<p>He formed a new group, the Socialist Workers Committee, with other former members of the RWL in the early 1980s. This group joined with similar groups in other cities to become first the Alliance for Socialist Action and then <a href="../../../s/o/c/Socialist_Challenge_b410.html" title="Socialist Challenge">Socialist Challenge</a>. Weisleder acted as editor of the group's eponymous newspaper.</p>
<p>Weisleder was accused by some in Socialist Challenge of promoting a rigid interpretation of <a href="../../../d/e/m/Democratic_centralism.html" title="Democratic centralism">democratic centralism</a>. He has rejected this charge, arguing that other members of the group refused to abide by its constitution, and were not building the organization effectively.</p>
<p>Weisleder also opposed the majority tendency in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Secretariat_of_the_Fourth_International_ed0b.html" title="United Secretariat of the Fourth International">United Secretariat of the Fourth International</a> with which Socialist Challenge was aligned. His views were in line with those of the American group, <a href="../../../s/o/c/Socialist_Action_%28US%29_f5e4.html" title="Socialist Action (US)">Socialist Action</a>, where the majority in Socialist Challenge were more sympathetic to the views of groups like <a href="../../../s/o/l/Solidarity_%28US%29_ae97.html" title="Solidarity (US)">Solidarity</a> in the US. These differences were exacerbated by personal disputes between Weisleder and other Socialist Challenge members in <a href="../../../t/o/r/Toronto.html" title="Toronto">Toronto</a> and Weisleder was expelled from the group.</p>
<p>He regrouped with fellow thinkers who left Socialist Challenge and formed a smaller group, <a href="../../../s/o/c/Socialist_Action_%28Canada%29_37d1.html" title="Socialist Action (Canada)">Socialist Action (Canada)</a>.</p>
<p>Weisleder served as an executive member of OPSEU on three occasions. In <a href="../../../1/9/9/1997.html" title="1997">1997</a>, as a result of a reorganization of teachers' unions imposed by the <a href="../../../o/n/t/Ontario_Progressive_Conservative_Party_d4fe.html" title="Ontario Progressive Conservative Party">Progressive Conservative</a> government, Weisleder's substitute teachers' local was dissolved and its members re-assigned to the <a href="../../../o/n/t/Ontario_Secondary_School_Teachers_Federation_4327.html" title="Ontario Secondary School Teachers Federation">Ontario Secondary School Teachers Federation</a> and Elementary Teachers Federation of Ontario (EFTO). As well, due to the amalgamation of the city of Toronto, the new OSSTF Toronto Substitute Teachers' local represented all substitute teachers in the former municipality of <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metropolitan_Toronto_fdae.html" title="Metropolitan Toronto">Metropolitan Toronto</a>. Weisleder ran for and won the presidency of the new local in May 1998.</p>
<p>Weisleder's tenure as leader was controversial, and his political style was criticized by some others in the OSSTF. After a number of confrontations with his opponents, he was charged with mistreating individuals and violating certain rules and procedures, particularly those dealing with finances and following democratic procedures. Weisleder has argued that these charges were petty and politically motivated, conducted by those who wanted to dissolve the part-time teacher units into regular teacher units, where members would have reduced bargaining power. The OSSTF's judicial council removed Weisleder from the executive of his local in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002.html" title="2002">2002</a>, and barred him from being an office holder in the union until <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_31.html" title="August 31">August 31</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a> <a href="http://www.osstf.on.ca/www/pub/update/vol30/1ja/1jaajud.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.osstf.on.ca/www/pub/update/vol30/1ja/1jaajud.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. In a subsequent decision, Weisleder's suspension was extended until August 31, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> <a href="http://www.osstf.on.ca/www/pub/update/vol31/1mr/1mradec.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.osstf.on.ca/www/pub/update/vol31/1mr/1mradec.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>.</p>
<p>Politically, Weisleder has remained active in the NDP. He opposed many policy decisions taken by <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Rae_f137.html" title="Bob Rae">Bob Rae</a>'s NDP government in Ontario in the early 1990s, however, and particularly the legislation of the <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_contract.html" title="Social contract">social contract</a>. Weisleder organized a conference entitled "Alternatives to the NDP government" during this period. This conference studied various courses of action in relation to the party, ranging from the creation of an internal "socialist caucus" to leaving the NDP and creating a new party.</p>
<p>Weisleder supported the candidacy of "independent labour" candidates <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joe_Flexer_8c5e.html" title="Joe Flexer">Joe Flexer</a> and Amani Oakley in the <a href="../../../o/n/t/Ontario_general_election%2C_1995.html" title="Ontario general election, 1995">1995 provincial election</a>, and acted as Oakley's campaign manager. He also endorsed NDP candidates <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Kormos_3d3b.html" title="Peter Kormos">Peter Kormos</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mark_Morrow_241b.html" title="Mark Morrow">Mark Morrow</a>, who had voted against the social contract. For supporting Oakley and Flexer, he was expelled from the NDP shortly after the election, and was not readmitted to the party until <a href="../../../1/9/9/1998.html" title="1998">1998</a>.</p>
<p>Weisleder was a leading figure in the formation of the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Democratic_Party_Socialist_Caucus_3441.html" title="New Democratic Party Socialist Caucus">New Democratic Party Socialist Caucus</a> in 1998, and was the co-chair of the caucus with Flexer, who had rejoined the NDP following the 1995 election. He remains the leading figure in the caucus along with <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marcel_Hatch_1e90.html" title="Marcel Hatch">Marcel Hatch</a> in <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Columbia_90ec.html" title="British Columbia">British Columbia</a>, and managed <a href="../../../b/e/v/Bev_Meslo_ed80.html" title="Bev Meslo">Bev Meslo</a>'s candidacy to lead the federal NDP in the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Democratic_Party_leadership_election%2C_2003_c847.html" title="New Democratic Party leadership election, 2003">2003 New Democratic Party leadership election</a>.</p>
<p>Weislder unsuccessfully contested the NDP's federal nomination in <a href="../../../t/r/i/Trinity--Spadina_b42e.html" title="Trinity--Spadina">Trinity--Spadina</a> in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2000.html" title="2000">2000</a>, losing the nomination battle to <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Valpy_de6a.html" title="Michael Valpy">Michael Valpy</a>. In <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Paul%27s_%28electoral_district%29_cd41.html" title="St. Paul's (electoral district)">St. Paul's</a> riding in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>, he lost the NDP nomination to Norman Tobias. He again contested the St. Paul's nomination in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a> (for the <a href="../../../3/9/t/39th_Canadian_federal_election_0ff9.html" title="39th Canadian federal election">39th Canadian federal election</a>), but was defeated by <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Summerville_51ce.html" title="Paul Summerville">Paul Summerville</a>.</p>
