<p>Hello! Thank you for working on documenting some of the shameful history of involuntary medical experimentation -- but please note that we need original material, not re-works of existing articles on the Web that may risk being regarded as copyright-infringing derivative works. Otherwise we risk having our article challenged for copyright violation. You cannot in general rely on "mere paraphrase" to get round this, although you can still rely on copyrighted articles for facts, and write a new text in your own words: but it is best to use several sources when writing an article.</p>
<p>Please note that this problem does not arise when <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_domain.html" title="Public domain">public domain</a> works are adapted, which is why we can use the words of the Nuremberg prosecutor in the Nazi article: as an employee of the U.S. federal goverment acting as such, his words were automatically in the public domain. Please see <a href="../../../c/o/p/Wikipedia%7ECopyright_policy_c6a7.html" title="Wikipedia:Copyright policy">Wikipedia:copyright policy</a> for more on this. -- <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Anome_61a9.html" title="User:The Anome">The Anome</a> 16:54, 30 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Thank you for telling me. Please check my article on the Labour Party's Clause IV. I am not sure about copyright.</p>
<p>On the Japanese experiments, try contacting the original website. They may want their material to reach a wider audience and may be willing to let you use their copyright.</p>
<p>Why has my article on <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_Korean_human_experimentation_74cd.html" title="North Korean human experimentation">North Korean human experimentation</a> been voted for deletion?

<p>Hi there! Looks like you're doing some useful stuff. I've come across a number of small articles about <a href="../../../t/o/n/Tony_Blair_f43c.html" title="Tony Blair">Tony Blair</a> by you, such as Tony Blair's Early Years. It is more within the style of Wikipedia to include this information in the main article, which in this case would be <a href="../../../t/o/n/Tony_Blair_f43c.html" title="Tony Blair">Tony Blair</a>. May I respectfully suggest that you merge your information into that article, and we can delete the small ones? <a href="../../../m/o/i/User%7EMoink_dc9f.html" title="User:Moink">moink</a> 20:37, 4 Mar 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>I didn't write the small articles on Tony Blair. I split them off from the main article. The section about his early life was right at the top of the article. I thought readers would prefer to read about his politics first. Rearranging things with those sections later in the article also works.</p>

<p>Hi Barbara, I have a question about the two sentences you've added to the opening paragraph in the article about <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Catholic_Church_sex_abuse_scandal_2830.html" title="Roman Catholic Church sex abuse scandal">Roman Catholic Church sex abuse scandal</a>:</p>
<p><i>It is believed that the Roman Catholic Church used the fear of <a href="../../../h/e/l/Hell.html" title="Hell">Hell</a> among the faithful to discourage them from criticizing what Priests were doing. Priests give <a href="../../../a/b/s/Absolution.html" title="Absolution">Absolution</a> which Roman Catholics believe can save them from the consequences of <a href="../../../m/o/r/Mortal_sin.html" title="Mortal sin">Mortal sin</a>.</i></p>
<p>It seems extremely biased to me.</p>
<dl>
<dd>"It is believed..." - namely, who <i>does</i> believe that and why?</dd>
<dd>"Priests give absolution, etc..." - what does it have to do with the topic?</dd>
</dl>
<p>All this may suggest that Catholic doctrine justifies sexual abuse by priests or that it grants impunity to priests. That's why I've added this sentence:</p>
<p><i>This, however, does not mean that the Roman Catholic doctrine in any way justifies sexual abuse of children by anybody, let alone by priests</i></p>
<p>But personally, I believe it would be much better if all three sentences - yours and mine - were deleted from the article.</p>

<p>Barbara, your current edits to <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magdalen_Asylum_72c1.html" title="Magdalen Asylum">Magdalen Asylum</a> are turning a well written and informative article into a mess. Much of what you are adding is not <b>directly</b> relevant (e.g. child abuse scandals), incorrect (wrong order of nuns, no such place as Biltmore Industrial School), very POV and somewhat incoherent. Much of what you are adding has a place in the Wikipedia, but it isn't here. Sorry to be so negative, but I think you are doing damage. BrendanH 13:33, Apr 5, 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>I don't agree with Brendan H</p>
<dl>
<dd>Of course you don't, Barbara. I just think you should be much more thoughtful about what you add, particularly in terms of the coherence, conciseness and NPOV nature of the articles. By the way, the order of nuns in (many of, at least) the Magdalen Laundries was Good Shepherd, and it was Baltimore Industrial School. BrendanH 13:58, Apr 5, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>So the Religious people guilty of this abuse called themselves, "Good Shepherds". That's a bit ironic.</p>

<p>Sorry, I think I was too impolite last Saturday. It is good that Wikipedia and Wikinfo do things differently. At the moment Wikinfo is at a disadvantage because it started later. When the Wikinfo site has developed I hope it will provide a different service from Wikipedia. Wikipedia will concentrate on providing condensed articles where everything is in one place. This will be useful for people who want information quickly. Wikinfo will often have work by different authors in different articles. This will be useful for people who like to surf educational sites. It will also help serious researchers who want to incorporate many viewpoints in their research. It will take longer to find what you want, if you want anything specific but what you read will often be creatively written and pleasant to read. Creative writers on Wikinfo will not find their style cramped because someone else has rewritten and condensed their work and integrated it somewhere else. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarbara_Shack_6c33.html" title="User:Barbara Shack">Barbara Shack</a> 15:54, 17 May 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Sorry but I reverted your edits to this article. Whatever you feel about the organization, it is not appropriate to "argue" with them in the way that you were doing. It's not a debating society. The article doesn't aim to praise the SA, merely to explain what it does and believes. How can you justify adding your text questioning their beliefs interspersed with those points? It's like you are trying to turn it into your own piece pointing out their shortcomings, which I do not believe is encylopedic. I am sorry if this offends you but I really do not think that what you did was correct. --82.35.17.203 21:50, 1 Jun 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p><i>How would a perfect God allow evil? See <a href="../../../p/r/o/Problem_of_Evil_f5aa.html" title="Problem of Evil">Problem of Evil</a></i></p>

<li>Belief that our first parents were created in a state of innocence but, by their disobedience, they lost their purity and happiness; and that in consequence of their fall all men have become sinners, totally depraved, and as such are justly exposed to the wrath of God.</li>

<p>Barbara, I think what you added is not appropriate for article pages.

<dd>Barbara added these templates along with her own opinions to articles. I think commenting on that definetly belongs here, since I've already tried to point out the problem with making such edits at <a href="../../../c/h/o/Talk%7EChocolate_and_slavery_60d0.html" title="Talk:Chocolate and slavery">talk:chocolate and slavery</a>. There didn't seem to be any problem with <a href="../../../w/h/i/Whitman%27s.html" title="Whitman's">Whitman's</a>, <a href="../../../v/a/l/Valrhona.html" title="Valrhona">Valrhona</a> or <a href="../../../g/o/d/Godiva_%28chocolatier%29.html" title="Godiva (chocolatier)">Godiva (chocolatier)</a> before Barbara added her own personal comments on the article in the form of the template and an inappropriate attempt to trump debate that belongs on talkpages rather than in articles. I haven't checked every single article involved, but as far as I can tell, this fair trade-POV seems to be about accusing every single chocolatier that isn't part of the fair trade-network of some kind of shared guilt for labor force abuses in certain cocoa-producing countries.</dd>

<p>I see you're getting into a revert war over your addition of this phrase:</p>
<p>If this were correct the<a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_of_America_8a5e.html" title="United States of America">United States of America</a> with its famous <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melting_pot.html" title="Melting pot">Melting pot</a> would be weak. The United States is clearly strong.-</p>
<p>May I remind you of the Three Revert Rule <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a>?</p>
<p>Also, I and others have removed your phrase, and your other one about "unworthy life" as they are off-topic.</p>
<p>When discussing Nazism, a phenomenom of the 30's and 40's, you bring in your personal point of view, which presumably relates to MODERN America.</p>
<p>The problem is not only is it a POV statement, but it's out of place, and out of time. America of the 30's and 40's was a place where blacks had few Civil Rights, faced horrendous problems and intimidation when they tried to vote (various discriminatory poll-taxes); where segregation was rife, in schools, on buses, even when it came to buying a soda or taking a drink of water at a public water-spout. Even the US Army sent to fight the Nazis was segregated at every level. Even if you were to argue that the US has overcome these problems today, (which is debatable) you cannot set up two systems at two different times against each other.</p>
<p>Your comments would be appreciated.</p>

<p>Barbara, I removed the link to dictionary.net, and the explanation of washerwoman. I think most people know what a washerwoman is and if they don't, they can look it up at a reputable online dictionary, such as the one at Bartleby. I'm sure you didn't intend to post advertising, just grabbed one of the first links that came up with Google ... but dictionary.net is one of those "reference" sites that display minimal or plagiarized content in order to get eyeballs for ads -- they're making money from the advertisers.</p>

<p>Barbara, you added this piece about the Santorini explosion and a resulting tsunami as a possible naturalistic explanation for the Red Sea crossing. ("The eruption of the Santorini volcano would have generated a Megatsunami estimated at 600-foot.") Two points to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>1. Santorini is in the Mediterranean, and the Red Sea isn't.</li>
<li>2. Genesis depicts the crossing as a supernatural event, caused by God (or Yahweh). Take away the supernatural, and you take away God.</li>
</ul>
<p>Just some thoughts&#160;:). <a href="../../../p/i/c/User%7EPiCo_bced.html" title="User:PiCo">PiCo</a> 13:08, 25 March 2006 (UTC)<br />
<a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarbara_Shack_6c33.html" title="User:Barbara Shack">Barbara Shack</a> 13:16, 25 March 2006 (UTC)Thanks for the comments. Your first point, that the Mediterranean isn't connected to the Red sea is rational. I've modified <a href="../../../p/a/s/Passage_of_the_Red_Sea_70b5.html#Cause_of_the_Passage" title="Passage of the Red Sea">the article</a>.</p>
<p>Barbara, I don't think you understood what I was getting at. It's simply this: before looking for naturalistic explanations for the Biblical picture of the crossing of the Red Sea, you must first understand clearly what that picture is. It's not a matter of the sea withdrawing and then returning: the sea is said to have split down the middle, so that the Israelites were walking through a canyon with water on either side. ("[T]he water was like a wall to them on their right and on their left.") This is not the kind of effect that a tsunami produces. But it's the picture you have to accept if you accept the Bible as a religious, and a true, document.<br /></p>
<p>Alternatively, you can take the Bible as a history, true in its details but not a true account of God's actions. This is what you're doing if you reject the image of the sea split by Moses and by God, with water in walls to the right and the left. Then of course, you can bring in theories about Santorini. But if you're going to reject the supernatural element, then why accept the naturalistic part? Why accept that the crossing ever took place? Perhaps it was a late 8th century piece of propaganda, deisgned to bolster the kingdom of Judah in its struggles against its its neighbours - the neighbours named in the Song of the ASea? After all, several of these peoples named in the Song of the Sae - Edom, Moab - didn't even exist at the time of the Exodus. So which do you believe? <a href="../../../p/i/c/User%7EPiCo_bced.html" title="User:PiCo">PiCo</a> 13:37, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarbara_Shack_6c33.html" title="User:Barbara Shack">Barbara Shack</a> 14:11, 25 March 2006 (UTC)Frankly I don’t take the Bible more seriously than I take, for example <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greek_mythology.html" title="Greek mythology">Greek mythology</a>, <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_mythology.html" title="Roman mythology">Roman mythology</a>, <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindu_mythology.html" title="Hindu mythology">Hindu mythology</a> The <a href="../../../k/o/r/Koran.html" title="Koran">Koran</a>, or other faith based writings considered sacred. Mythology frequently includes elements of truth mixed with inaccuarte information. I’m quite prepared to believe that a tsunami evernt may have happened. Later after the story had been retold very many times it became the story in the Old Testament.</p>
<p>Maybe...but that's speculation. Still, if what you're saying is that you believe the Crossing story is not literally true, but may represent a folk-memory of a real event, you should say so. You should also give some context - dates for the supposed Crossing (you can take that from the article on <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Exodus_a4d5.html" title="The Exodus">the Exodus</a>), dates of the Santorini event, do they match up... And if you want to go down that rtack, it would be only fair to include other naturalistic explanations as well (there's another theory that the crossing took place across marshes, rather than the sea, and that strong east winsd frequently blow back the waters of the marshes making them passable for men on foot but not for chariots, which would be bogged in the mud - have a look again at the Crossing article where it talks about the distinct threads making up the narrative according to the Documentary Hypothesis). <a href="../../../p/i/c/User%7EPiCo_bced.html" title="User:PiCo">PiCo</a> 14:28, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thank you for recognizing my work needed improvement and taking action on it, Barbara. We here at Wikipedia are supposed to do that. Unfortunately, you did not do the appropriate research.

<p>Having looked at the page on James Randi, it does appear true that he is probably objective, and that he has done much good in exposing frauds. One thing about Lourdes needs to be clarified. The water DOES NOT HAVE ANY SCIENTIFIC POWERS. It is simply an instrument used by God when He chooses. When He does not choose that it will cure, it will not cure. Also, if you read the documents, Bernadette only says she saw "a lady," not the Blessed Virgin Mary. An investigation done after the fact came to the conclusion that the Blessed Virgin Mary appeared to Bernadette. Regarding miracles, the Lourdes Medical Bureau's job is to investigate cases that may possibly be miracles and determine whether there is any way it may have possibly occured naturally, but it is not their job to determine what a miracle is. See the website for details. The apparition at Lourdes is not required to be believed by Catholics because it is not an integral doctrine of the Faith and is not public revelation, but private revelation. The Church has CONDEMNED other "apparitions" because they are not of God. Apparently you do not understand the Church's position on apparitions, but neither do I have time to explain it here. The Catechism of the Catholic Church is available online <a href="http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/_INDEX.HTM" class="external text" title="http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/_INDEX.HTM" rel="nofollow">here</a>. <a href="../../../j/b/o/User%7EJBogdan_c268.html" title="User:JBogdan">JBogdan</a> 01:41, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>You did not do your research before reverting the page. Also, another user corrected us. The "miracles" can also be consummated by participating in a Eucharitic procession on the premises, i.e., the water does not have scientific healing powers, nor should it, as I previously stated on the page.

<p>Barbara, I can tell that you feel very strongly about including information about scientific explanations of body preservation in the articles on <a href="../../../b/e/r/Bernadette_Soubirous_524d.html" title="Bernadette Soubirous">Bernadette</a> and <a href="../../../m/i/r/Miracles_at_Lourdes_3aba.html" title="Miracles at Lourdes">Lourdes</a>. May I suggest putting this information in the <a href="../../../i/n/c/Incorruptibility.html" title="Incorruptibility">Incorruptibility</a> article? I see you have made some minor edits on that page, but I think that the very detailed information you've been trying to put into those other articles would be more appropriate there. You could then put a "See Also" or a sentence in the criticisms sections of the <a href="../../../b/e/r/Bernadette_Soubirous_524d.html" title="Bernadette Soubirous">Bernadette</a> and <a href="../../../m/i/r/Miracles_at_Lourdes_3aba.html" title="Miracles at Lourdes">Lourdes</a> articles refering to <a href="../../../i/n/c/Incorruptibility.html" title="Incorruptibility">Incorruptibility</a>, perhaps somethine like, "There have been scientific explanations offered to account for the preservation of Bernadette's body.

<p>On two occasions you have now added the following content to <a href="../../../a/r/t/Arthritis.html" title="Arthritis">arthritis</a>:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>The general public does not understand arthritis very well. Arthritic people can have "good days" and "bad days". they can do less on a "bad day" than on a "good day". This can cause uncertainty and prejudice among the public.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>This is entirely <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">POV</a>. You could substantiate the first sentence by citing a well-conducted study that examines popular perception of arthritis; however, there are numerous forms of arthritis, and their popular perception varies wildly (i.e. osteoarthritis vs true inflammatory arthritides).</p>
<p>"Arthritic people" do not exist, much like people with cancer will probably not like to be called "cancerous people". Some forms of arthritis do not have "good &amp; bad days": some flare every few weeks or months, and some are chronically debilitating (e.g. osteoarthritis). One cannot possibly generalise between all forms.</p>
<p>Uncertainty &amp; prejudice? Possibly. But this is your opinion, not established fact. <a href="../../../j/f/d/User%7EJfdwolff_9ea6.html" title="User:Jfdwolff">JFW</a>&#160;|&#160;<a href="../../../j/f/d/User_talk%7EJfdwolff_aee2.html" title="User talk:Jfdwolff"><small>T@lk</small></a> 21:17, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>hey there. sorry, had to fulfill your interesting question on how long "they" would take to change your edit. it falls under NPOV.
