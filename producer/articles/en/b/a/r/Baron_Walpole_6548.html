Robert Walpole,<br />
1st Earl of Orford</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The title of <b>Baron Walpole</b>, of Walpole in the County of Norfolk, was created in the <a href="../../../p/e/e/Peerage_of_Great_Britain_8357.html" title="Peerage of Great Britain">Peerage of Great Britain</a> in <a href="../../../1/7/2/1723.html" title="1723">1723</a> for <b>Robert Walpole</b>, in honour of his father, <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Walpole%2C_1st_Earl_of_Orford_a215.html" title="Robert Walpole, 1st Earl of Orford">Sir Robert Walpole</a>, known as the first <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom_dd87.html" title="Prime Minister of the United Kingdom">Prime Minister</a> of <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">Great Britain</a>. The peerage was created with remainder, failing male issue of his own, to his brothers Edward Walpole and Horace Walpole, in default thereof to the heirs male of his father, and in default thereof to the heirs male of his grandfather Sir Thomas Walpole. On Sir Robert Walpole’s retirement from the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_House_of_Commons_bbac.html" title="British House of Commons">House of Commons</a> in <a href="../../../1/7/4/1742.html" title="1742">1742</a>, he was himself raised to the <a href="../../../p/e/e/Peerage_of_Great_Britain_8357.html" title="Peerage of Great Britain">Peerage of Great Britain</a> as <b>Baron Walpole</b>, of Houghton in the County of Norfolk, <b>Viscount Walpole</b> and <b>Earl of Orford</b>, with remainder to the heirs male of his body. When Lord Orford died in <a href="../../../1/7/4/1745.html" title="1745">1745</a> he was succeeded by his aforementioned son Robert Walpole, 1st Baron Walpole. In <a href="../../../1/7/2/1724.html" title="1724">1724</a> he had married Margaret, who in <a href="../../../1/7/5/1751.html" title="1751">1751</a> became one of the co-heirs to the ancient <a href="../../../b/a/r/Baron_Clinton_664a.html" title="Baron Clinton">Barony of Clinton</a>, which fell into abeyance the latter year. In <a href="../../../1/7/6/1760.html" title="1760">1760</a> the abeyance was terminated in her favour, and she became the 15th Baroness Clinton. The second Earl of Orford was succeeded by his eldest son, the third Earl. He notably served as <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lord_Lieutenant_of_Norfolk_df45.html" title="Lord Lieutenant of Norfolk">Lord Lieutenant of Norfolk</a> from <a href="../../../1/7/5/1757.html" title="1757">1757</a> to <a href="../../../1/7/9/1797.html" title="1797">1797</a>. In <a href="../../../1/7/8/1781.html" title="1781">1781</a> he also succeeded his mother as 16th Baron Clinton. Lord Orford never married and on his death the Barony of Clinton became dormant (see the <a href="../../../b/a/r/Baron_Clinton_664a.html" title="Baron Clinton">Baron Clinton</a> for later history of this peerage), while the other titles were inherited by his uncle, the fourth Earl. He was a well-known writer and politician. Lord Orford never married either and on his death in <a href="../../../1/7/9/1797.html" title="1797">1797</a> the Barony of Walpole, of Houghton, Viscountcy of Walpole and Earldom of Orford became extinct. However, he was succeeded in the Barony of Walpole according to the special remainder by his cousin Horatio Walpole, 2nd Baron Walpole of Wolterton.</p>
<p>The title of <b>Baron Walpole of Wolterton</b>, was created in the <a href="../../../p/e/e/Peerage_of_Great_Britain_8357.html" title="Peerage of Great Britain">Peerage of Great Britain</a> in <a href="../../../1/7/5/1756.html" title="1756">1756</a> for the politician and diplomat <b>Horatio Walpole</b>. He was the younger brother of Prime Minister <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Walpole%2C_1st_Earl_of_Orford_a215.html" title="Robert Walpole, 1st Earl of Orford">Robert Walpole, 1st Earl of Orford</a>. As mentioned above, his son, the second Baron, succeeded his cousin as 4th Baron Walpole in <a href="../../../1/7/9/1797.html" title="1797">1797</a>. He had earlier represented <a href="../../../k/i/n/King%27s_Lynn_%28UK_Parliament_constituency%29_cec2.html" title="King's Lynn (UK Parliament constituency)">King's Lynn</a> in Parliament. In <a href="../../../1/8/0/1806.html" title="1806">1806</a> the Earldom of Orford was revived when he was created <b>Earl of Orford</b> in the <a href="../../../p/e/e/Peerage_of_the_United_Kingdom_2a90.html" title="Peerage of the United Kingdom">Peerage of the United Kingdom</a>. His son, the second Earl, sat as <a href="../../../m/e/m/Member_of_Parliament_22d1.html" title="Member of Parliament">Member of Parliament</a> for <a href="../../../w/i/g/Wigan_%28UK_Parliament_constituency%29_ef5a.html" title="Wigan (UK Parliament constituency)">Wigan</a> and <a href="../../../k/i/n/King%27s_Lynn_%28UK_Parliament_constituency%29_cec2.html" title="King's Lynn (UK Parliament constituency)">King's Lynn</a>. His grandson, the fourth Earl, briefly represented <a href="../../../w/i/g/Wigan_%28UK_Parliament_constituency%29_ef5a.html" title="Wigan (UK Parliament constituency)">Wigan</a> in the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_House_of_Commons_bbac.html" title="British House of Commons">House of Commons</a>. On the death of the latter’s nephew, the fifth Earl, the Earldom of Orford became extinct. However, the Baronies of Walpole and Walpole of <a href="../../../w/o/l/Wolterton_Hall_af37.html" title="Wolterton Hall">Wolterton</a> survived, and were inherited by the late Earl’s distant relative, the ninth Baron Walpole and seventh Baron Walpole of Wolterton. He was a descendant of Hon. Thomas Walpole, second son of the first Baron Walpole of Wolterton. As of <a href="../../../2/0/0/2007.html" title="2007">2007</a> the peerages are held by the ninth Baron’s son, the tenth Baron Walpole and eighth Baron Walpole of Wolterton. He is one of the ninety <a href="../../../h/e/r/Hereditary_peer.html" title="Hereditary peer">hereditary peers</a> who remain in the <a href="../../../h/o/u/House_of_Lords_efb8.html" title="House of Lords">House of Lords</a> after the passing of the <a href="../../../h/o/u/House_of_Lords_Act_1999_f0bb.html" title="House of Lords Act 1999">House of Lords Act</a> of <a href="../../../1/9/9/1999.html" title="1999">1999</a>, and sits as a cross-bencher.</p>
