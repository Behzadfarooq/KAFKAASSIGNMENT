<h2><span class="mw-headline">Gas tax, estate tax</span></h2>
<p>Recent edits by an anon (seen <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Barack_Obama&amp;diff=58215374&amp;oldid=58202556" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Barack_Obama&amp;diff=58215374&amp;oldid=58202556" rel="nofollow">here</a>) added the following to the article:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In May 2006, Obama campaigned to maintain a $.54 per gallon tax on imported ethanol, during a period when automotive fuel prices hovered around $3.00 per gallon. Obama justified the tax by joining Senator Durbin in stating that "ethanol imports are neither necessary nor a practical response to current gasoline prices". In June 2006, Obama campaigned to increase estate tax to their 2000 levels, claiming that this would eliminate the "Paris Hilton" tax break for "billionaire heirs and heiresses."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My position is that, as written, the blurbs violate <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> as they provide merely soundbytes without any context that are slanted toward a conservative view of both issues.</p>
<p>Regarding the estate tax, the use of the word "increase" is misleading and POV, considering that the estate tax is in the middle of a steady, drawn-out cut that will culminate in its elimination for one year in 2010. As the law stands now, the estate tax will automatically roll back to its 2000 level one year later in 2011. Regardless of what one thinks of the estate tax, one can hardly say, and remain neutral, that Obama supports an "increase" of the estate tax if he merely opposes extending a cut that is ALREADY set to expire in five years. My edit, which is only a slight change, to the blurb is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Barack_Obama&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=58202556" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Barack_Obama&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=58202556" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>
<p>Second, regarding the gas tax, the sentence soundbyte purporting to explain how Obama justifies the tax is nothing more than an attempt to (1) make Obama appear to have no justification for the tax, and (2) avoid explaining how Obama actually justifies tax. It's POV and does not deserve to be in the article without elaboration. - <a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJersyko_510d.html" title="User:Jersyko"><font color="#013220">Jersyko</font></a>·<i><a href="../../../j/e/r/User_talk%7EJersyko_3ca3.html" title="User talk:Jersyko"><font color="#465945" size="1">talk</font></a></i> 15:46, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>These are simply news items that show Obama's record of favoring raising taxes. If the news items show what is true, how is that slanted. One of them is from his own webpage. The other from a joint release with Sen Harkin, signed by Obama.</p>
<p>"Increase" is the straightforward term Jerseyko is attempting to bury as a rollback of a tax cut. The simple English language description of raising taxes from current levels is Increase. Any other description is political mucky-muck, or POV if you prefer.</p>
<p>The gas tax quote, from Obama's press release is accurate. If you have further explanation of his justification, please add it, or start another page for it, but I cannot see how you can remove a letter from the Senator campaigning for ethanol tariffs in the name of POV. The POV is shown in your removal of news accurately describing the positions of Sen Obama. If you feel as though you must apologize for Obama's campaigns to raise taxes, how about starting an "Obama Apologetics" section, rather than removing the actual quotes from the esteemed Senator.--24.13.84.218 17:23, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>How about <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assuming good faith</a> and <a href="../../../d/i/c/WP%7EDICK_0b34.html" title="WP:DICK">not being a dick</a>? Cut the BS rhetoric when you respond to my points. I've explained how "increase" is a mischaracterization and oversimplification of Obama's position on estate taxes. I've explained how the gas tax blurb is an attempt to (1) make Obama appear to have no justification for the tax, and (2) avoid explaining how Obama actually justifies tax. You're justifying them by pointing out that they are <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">cited</a>, but you fail to realize that verifiability is only one qualification for text in an aritcle: it must also be <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">written neutrally</a>.

<dd>I just read Obama's statement on the estate tax again. Point out where in that short statement Obama says we should increase the estate tax. It's not there.

<p>Jersyko, your characterization of raising taxes being mischaracterized as a tax increase is pure Orwellian. In plain English, if one removes tax decreases, that is an increase. It is a completely neutral statement to point out the fact that Obama supports increased taxes. He may have some justification, he may not, but this is not the section on Obama Apologetics. It is simply a statement of his position on Estate Taxes. I do not see this entry as an appropriate area to explain Obama's support for higher gas prices or higher estate taxes, rather just report the information as is, and set up links to other sections that go into estate taxes and import tariffs in more depth.--24.13.84.218 20:46, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Oh ok, so this encyclopedia article about Barack Obama in a section about his career in the Senate is not "an appropriate area to explain Obama's support for higher gas prices or higher estate taxes." Your continued use of inflated rhetoric instead of reference to Wikipedia policy is impressive but unpersuasive. - <a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJersyko_510d.html" title="User:Jersyko"><font color="#013220">Jersyko</font></a>·<i><a href="../../../j/e/r/User_talk%7EJersyko_3ca3.html" title="User talk:Jersyko"><font color="#465945" size="1">talk</font></a></i> 20:54, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Yes, that is correct. This is a good place to post facts about Sen. Obama. It is not a good place to make justifications for his posititions. That would be better on a campaign site, rather than on an encyclopedia entry. Where on earth is the inflated rhetoric? Can we stop this campaign to bury the facts? Just let the facts speak for themselves.</p>
<p>I have removed the list of billionaires. There is nothing in the links suggesting that these people are affected by the estate tax. In general, it may be a good assumption to think that billionaires have found methods of estate tax avoidance, or maybe they haven't but by no means are all billionaires eligible for the estate tax.--24.13.84.218 21:22, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm fine with the removal of the link to the list of billionaires. Where are you getting this seemingly-arbitrary "52%" estate tax rate number that you claim Obama likes? I don't see it anywhere in the source. - <a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJersyko_510d.html" title="User:Jersyko"><font color="#013220">Jersyko</font></a>·<i><a href="../../../j/e/r/User_talk%7EJersyko_3ca3.html" title="User talk:Jersyko"><font color="#465945" size="1">talk</font></a></i> 22:03, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks.

<p>Well, a revert of the Estate Tax taking it back to 2002 levels would make it..50%.., which is what Obama voted for. Obama voted to allow taxes to revert to their 2002 level.--24.13.84.218 12:59, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Perhaps you're right, but the source does not say this. The source merely indicates that Obama opposes a Republican-backed tax break. Until a source says differently, I think the article should not presume that Obama voted this way or that. - <a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJersyko_510d.html" title="User:Jersyko"><font color="#013220">Jersyko</font></a>·<i><a href="../../../j/e/r/User_talk%7EJersyko_3ca3.html" title="User talk:Jersyko"><font color="#465945" size="1">talk</font></a></i> 13:58, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Jerseyko, can you please do a minimal amount of research before removing my posts? The estate tax vote was widely publicized, in most every media outlet in America. Obama voted to allow the estate tax to revert to 2002 levels, quoted here in Newsday <a href="http://www.newsday.com/news/politics/wire/sns-ap-senate-rollvote-estate-tax,0,1019235.story?coll=sns-ap-politics-headlines" class="external free" title="http://www.newsday.com/news/politics/wire/sns-ap-senate-rollvote-estate-tax,0,1019235.story?coll=sns-ap-politics-headlines" rel="nofollow">http://www.newsday.com/news/politics/wire/sns-ap-senate-rollvote-estate-tax,0,1019235.story?coll=sns-ap-politics-headlines</a></p>
<p>I don't see why your speculative removals are more justified than my correct postings. A 2 second Google search would verify Obama's voting record. It had to take you longer to remove my statement than to check it vs. the congressional record.--<a href="../../../j/b/p/User%7EJbpo_d43b.html" title="User:Jbpo">Jbpo</a> 15:27, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>First, the burden to provide sources is on those wishing to include the information, NOT on editors who remove unsourced information, per <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a>. Second, your wording, "Obama voted to allow estate taxes to return to a 50% level" is an inference based on what actually happened, which is that Obama voted against a Republican tax break. The source says "The 57-41 roll call by which the Senate rejected advancing a Republican bill to eliminate or shrink taxes on inherited estates." It does not say "The senators voted to retun taxes to a 50% level." That might well be the effect of the vote (though it might not end up that way!), but it was NOT the purpose of the vote. - <a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJersyko_510d.html" title="User:Jersyko"><font color="#013220">Jersyko</font></a>·<i><a href="../../../j/e/r/User_talk%7EJersyko_3ca3.html" title="User talk:Jersyko"><font color="#465945" size="1">talk</font></a></i> 15:43, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>OK, so then request a source in the discussion rather than acting as the censor. There is nothing in the wiki rules suggesting you should remove such statements. Why not just do a minimal amount of research 1st? --24.13.84.218 21:35, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Jerseyko above examples are not much on POV. They are simply a restating of the facts, and the implications of defeating the Estate Tax rollback. I have selectively chosen to publicize Obama's recent record. I do not think it gets publicized in the mainstream press, thus I publish here. The implied stance I am trying for is balance. This article is very rah-rah in favor of Barack Obama, without stating much of anything about his votes, or his stance on issues. Publicizing his votes, show his stance on issues.

<p>The 10,000 jobs statement was from Mayor Daley. Nothing implied, it is a fact that major politicians, businessmen, and unions have creditted the sugar tariff, championed by Senator Durbin, with destroying the candy industry in Chicago. How is this POV? It is the general consensus, which even Senator Durbin has admitted (to an extent).</p>
<p>One might get the impression that facts unfavorable to Senator Durbin and Obama are being removed, soley to protect Senator Durbin from having his record published. I see no reason why I should be composing an explanation for Sen. Obama's voting record. I do not know the reason why he votes the way he does (and neither do you). A neutral posting of Sen Obama's voting record certainly stands on its own. If you have some favorable votes that Sen Obama has made, go ahead and post them.

<dd>Tailoring your neutral posts to fit my pov? Well, for one thing, I completely disagree with Obama and Durbin on economic protectionism, including sugar and ethanol tariffs. So that's a non-starter, I'm afraid. Second, I haven't removed any facts. Your edit about ethanol made it appear that Obama/Durbin had no explanation for their support of the tariff, as it said "___ justified the tariff by stating 'Ethanol imports are neither necessary nor a practical response to current gasoline prices'" without actually explaining how they justified the tariff, which is because they think domestic ethanol production is sufficient and even expanding (straight from the source). You selectively left off the crucial final fact, which is where the POV problem is. So what I've done, instead of removing facts, is merely told the whole story. The bit about ethanol tariffs, for instance, is still in the article, and is substantially the same as it was when you added it, but now it doesn't selectively leave out a crucial fact. Finally, you say "I see no reason why I should be composing an explanation for Sen. Obama's voting record", but didn't you add the "justified the tariff" sentence in the first place? So are you (1) not composing explanations for Obama's voting record or (2) cherry-picking facts from sources that happen to fit <i>your</i> pov while omitting others? - <a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJersyko_510d.html" title="User:Jersyko"><font color="#013220">Jersyko</font></a>·<i><a href="../../../j/e/r/User_talk%7EJersyko_3ca3.html" title="User talk:Jersyko"><font color="#465945" size="1">talk</font></a></i> 23:35, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Jerseyko, I am not Obama's PR man. I am simply posting information about Obama's voting record and campaigns. The "cherry-picking" is for real: I am posting information largeley ignored by the mainstream media. That is one of the strong points of a Wiki. Information which is very important (Obama's stance on the Bridge to Nowhere, for example), is typically not reported or buried in the Chicago newspapers, although it is crucial to understanding the Senator. While the Chicago Tribune and SunTimes publish details of Obama's Grammy Awards, High School Athletics, and cheerful consideration of the Presidential nomination, there needs to be some outlet publsishing his voting record, even if that record is not popular with his constituents. Isn't one of the purposes of Wiki-Media to avoid the POV and cheerleading of the mainstream media? --24.13.84.218 14:51, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Well, no, if Wikipedia was only here to re-publish things from the mainstream media, one could just use the mainstream media. One of the weak points of the MSM is that piles on information, without using much discretion as to its utility. Thus we know quite a bit about Obama's multicultrualism and high school sporting achievments and next to nothing about his stance on issues. I am not about to post the charming story of Obama attending fancy private schools for 30 years of his life.

(3) Ultimately, I don't see anything where Obama prefers to return the estate tax to Y2K (particularly since I think that failing to prevent the scheduled increase only takes us to 2002).

<dd>You've misrepresented my view. I don't "see POV in any story that is not Rah-Rah for Obama", I see POV in your attempts to report the story differently from what has actually been reported. Let's look at this in detail with your recent edit as a good example. You wrote:
<blockquote>
<p>"Obama campaigned to reform immigration through a system of paying a substantial fine and back taxes, learning English, satisfying a work requirement, and passing a background check, and well as securing the border with Mexico [reference]."</p>
</blockquote>
</dd>
<dd>Here's what the reference actualy said:
<blockquote>
<p>"The first priority of any immigration reform should be to secure our nation's borders. In that respect, the president's proposal has merit as a temporary solution. . . . We also know that border security is only one side of the equation. Comprehensive immigration reform cannot succeed without a plan to bring the undocumented out of the shadows and offer them a path to citizenship, after they pay a substantial fine and back taxes, learn English, satisfy a work requirement, and pass a background check."<a href="http://abcnews.go.com/US/story?id=1965517&amp;page=1" class="external autonumber" title="http://abcnews.go.com/US/story?id=1965517&amp;page=1" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>
</blockquote>
</dd>
<dd>First, you've obviously deleted the point of Obama's quote from your summary of it, his point being that "comprehensive immigration reform cannot succeed without a plan to bring the undocumented out of the shadows and offer them a path to citizenship." This is the crux of the debate over immigration in the United States right now, and Obama's position on this issue should not be conveniently left out of the article in favor of taling <b>only</b> about fines etc. for illegal immigrants.<br />
Second, and merely as an aside, your addition was poorly worded, mainly because it forces the reader to ask "but who is paying taxes and fines, and for what purpose?" Surely you don't believe that Obama's position on immigration is to fine, tax, learn English, and satisfy work requirements? That doesn't even make any sense. That's like responding to the question "What is your favorite color?" with "I like baseballs"--your answer might be "white", the color of baseballs, but "I like baseballs" isn't an answer to the question. Similarly, the answer to "what is your position on immigration reform" would not be "taxes, fines, learning English", it would be "<b>providing citizenship if</b> you pay taxes, fines, learn English, etc."<br />
I hope this helps you understand why your addition was POV, quite contrary to your contention that I "insisted, without much merit, that this represents point of view." - <a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJersyko_510d.html" title="User:Jersyko"><font color="#013220">Jersyko</font></a>·<i><a href="../../../j/e/r/User_talk%7EJersyko_3ca3.html" title="User talk:Jersyko"><font color="#465945" size="1">talk</font></a></i> 20:28, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>No, your edit was trivial and not very helpful. Immigration reform implies that there would be some path to legal immigration. You duplicate that by writing about the path to citizenship. My addition was basically copied from Obama's press release. The poor wording belongs to the Senator. I'll stand by my observation that Obama is offering a series of fines, penalties and tests as a path to legal immigration. That is what he said. If it does not make any sense, then perhaps he should not have said it, but of course that is up to the Senator, and not me. In any case, it does not merit your trivial edit, nor your condemnation as POV. --<a href="../../../j/b/p/User%7EJbpo_d43b.html" title="User:Jbpo">Jbpo</a> 00:29, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You said: <i>Immigration reform implies that there would be some path to legal immigration.</i> What?? There have been <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minutemen_Project_a1d8.html" title="Minutemen Project">constituencies</a> calling for deportation of all illegal immigrants for years. Why does merely saying "immigration reform" automatically mean "providing some path to legal immigration"? That's an absurd argument. You also say <i>I'll stand by my observation that Obama is offering a series of fines, penalties and tests as a path to legal immigration.</i> -- but you didn't do that! You left off the <b>as a path to legal immigration</b> part in your edit, the most crucial words in that sentence in the context of the immigration debate as it is in the US today. You claim to merely be reproducting what Obama said, but now you're now misrepresenting what you said Obama said. Thus, as is your pattern and professed POV, you edited in a negative picture (instead of a netural picture) of Obama talking about how he's going to fine and tax without even referring to who he's going to fine and tax and for what reason. Finally, as to your point about me being picky with the <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral point of view</a> policy, well, it is the most important policy here at Wikipedia and is absolutely non-negotiable (that's in the policy itself), so, yeah, that's what we do. - <a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJersyko_510d.html" title="User:Jersyko"><font color="#013220">Jersyko</font></a>·<i><a href="../../../j/e/r/User_talk%7EJersyko_3ca3.html" title="User talk:Jersyko"><font color="#465945" size="1">talk</font></a></i> 01:05, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>No, you are wrong. 1) There is already a path to legal immigration that does not require Obama's fines and penalties. 2) There is evidently some kind of immigration reform called for by Obama. That reform calls for various hurdles for immigrants, which I listed. 3) There is a major difference between reform and calling out the militia. No one is suggesting that Obama is calling out the Militia.</p>

Everytime that's said, it's in the words of the author of the article, but no proof is given.

<p>Someone keeps changing the posts about the petitions online to force Obama to run for president. One comment left said they were removed because they weren't noteworthy. I think that person is politically motiviated. I honestly believe most people reading this article will find the information interesting maybe even useful. So, who would erase such information? Who wants to suppress the common man? Someone who doesn't agree with Obama? Yes, I'm suggesting that. Why else? The information obviously is on topic and well written.

<p>Of course, the "Reliable Sources" is a guidline and not a rule. It seems perfectly logical to state opinions from blogs in encyclopedic entries, probably more so than posting opinions from newspapers. There are varying degrees of blogs out there. This one <a href="http://www.acton.org/blog" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.acton.org/blog" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>is quite well researched, and reliable. However, given that the statement is only a matter of opinion, and given that the blogger did a significant amount of research to form his opinion, one could fairly surmise that the bloggers text is a well informed statement as to the reaction of some in the Christian community to Sen. Obama's statements. If there is a dispute as to reliability, it should be as to whether the statement reflects the authors opinion, rather than whether the blog is 100% correct.

I'm not sure why the bill was necessary, given that tort law most likely already provides for such an action. But that's neither here nor there. I'm posting here to see what others think about the bill's notability and whether we should give a detailed description of Obama's vote on one state bill (and why this one over all the rest? why cherry pick here?) in light of undue weight and other relevant policy.

<dd>The bill is by far the most controversial vote of obama's career in the state senate. Read the bill; it's very short and simple, which is why I included a direct quote in the post. <a href="http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/legisnet92/sbgroups/sb/920SB1661LV.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/legisnet92/sbgroups/sb/920SB1661LV.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> (It mentions nothing of disfiguration.) A vote for controversial legislation is notable, regardless of whether he sponsored the bill or not. A post that references his explanation of his vote would be an appropriate addition as you mentioned. As for undue weight, it seems that one reference to a "negative" (and very controversial) vote in a section that describes several "positive" bills that he supported does not give undue weight. Also consider that it supports the statement in the next paragraph: "though known as a principled liberal..." And btw, this is my only wikipedia user name. No sock puppets. J8427</dd>

<dd>It is true that it is not parallel to the other bills mentioned. However, it is common on most articles about politicians to mention significant votes they cast (check some other high profile senators, for example). It might be more appropriate to mention it in the senate race section - see my comment below. The senate race section in general needs to be added to. Compared to the same section in the Alan Keyes article, it is rather sparse, especially considering that it was a notable campaign that received significant national media coverage.--J8427 02:56, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree with Shsilver. Whether the bill is controversial is somewhat beside the point, but the bill was not <i>nearly</i> as controversial as you think it was. It merely creates a cause of action for damages so that the parent of a child that was born alive after a botched abortion can recover from the negligent doctor. The bill does <b>not</b>, as you originally suggested, "grant medical care and protection for any child born after a failed abortion attempt." Have you read the bill? I recommend reading it again so you can see what I mean. Finally, it is likely that the parents would already have an action for malpractice against the doctor even without the bill in question, making opposition to the bill even less "controversial" since a remedy at law exists even without the bill's newly created cause of action. · <a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJersyko_510d.html" title="User:Jersyko"><font color="#013220">j·e·r·s·y·k·o</font></a> <i><a href="../../../j/e/r/User_talk%7EJersyko_3ca3.html" title="User talk:Jersyko"><font color="#465945" size="1">talk</font></a></i> · 23:43, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Your interpretation is noted; the bill does say that, among other things.("The General Assembly finds that all children who are born alive are entitled to equal protection under the law regardless of the circumstances surrounding the birth.") Even if it as toothless as you say, it still makes one wonder why he would oppose it, especially given the other legislation that he supported. This is why on my most recent post I put a quote from the bill and a link to the full text of the legislation, allowing the reader to decide. You are probably right that it is not as controversial as I think (since I closely followed his US senate race), but it is also probably more controversial than you claim. Why bother including it? Because anyone who does a bit of research on his senate race will come across references to that vote. Keyes even claimed it was the motivating factor in his decision to oppose Obama (this was probably just campaign propoganda, but shows that this was not just an obscure vote). Including information on the vote and obama's explanation for it, if he has one, would fill a significant gap. The first time I saw the article, I was surprised to find that the vote was not mentioned, because I assumed that an explanation of his vote would be on wikipedia, if anywhere. --J8427 02:56, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The bill was commonly called the "Born Alive Infant Protection Act," probably because a similar federal bill had that name. For that reason, the actual title will not show up on google results as much, assuming that to be a legitimate measure of notability. Alan Keyes' motivation can be found in his acceptance speech (about halfway down) where he says that vote is "what finally arrested my attention and forced me to consider whether I not only had the opportunity to oppose him, but the obligation." <a href="http://www.renewamerica.us/archives/speeches/04_08_08illinois_announce.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.renewamerica.us/archives/speeches/04_08_08illinois_announce.htm" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>, as well as in many interviews. <a href="http://www.keyesarchives.com/media/interviews/04_09_09kresta.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.keyesarchives.com/media/interviews/04_09_09kresta.htm" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> The notability of Obama's position that he voted against a bill that in very similar form was passed by the US senate by unanimous consent, and by the house on a voice vote. This would indicate his vote is significant. Granted, it is not the same bill, but the intent was the same. I'm really not sure why there is such a question of notability. Where are all the sources for the the bill that he sponsored to make sure mammograms are covered? Where is the evidence of notability for that bill?

<dd>You're quite correct to point out the lack of sources for other statements about Obama's time in the IL legislature. Feel free to remove the relevant unsourced statements from the article if you like. Cherry picking is likely not implicated if a source is cited, however, as he sponsored the bill. Nonetheless, if it turns out to be merely a minor bill, however, that Obama did not push for very hard or really had little to do with, it doesn't deserve mention, in my opinion. Finally, I'm not sure that two Alan Keyes sources prove the notability (or can serve as reliable sources) of the bill. The more I think about it, the more I'm convinced that if Keyes really was motivated to enter the race by Obama's "no" vote on this bill, then it belongs in Keyes article, not this one. · <a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJersyko_510d.html" title="User:Jersyko"><font color="#013220">j·e·r·s·y·k·o</font></a> <i><a href="../../../j/e/r/User_talk%7EJersyko_3ca3.html" title="User talk:Jersyko"><font color="#465945" size="1">talk</font></a></i> · 12:38, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In response to our British cousin, I note: Disraeli was not Jewish; he was Christian. His family had originally been Jews, but they had converted before he was born. No Jew could serve as a Member of Parliament until the 1860s, when the oath was ammended to removed references to Jesus. Baron Lionel de Rothschild was, I believe, the first Jewish member to take the new oath. Or was it Sir Moses Montefiore? I forget. Anyway, Britain has never had a Jewish Prime Minister. Considering that the Jewish Community in Britain is almost 1,000 years old, it is arguably more overdue in Britain than in our young nation. On the other hand, you have had a woman PM, and we have never had a woman President. The Jews are approximately 2 per cent of the US population, and we have at least 2 Jewish Senators (2% of 100). I don't really know where all this talk is headed; just a response to your comments....66.108.4.183 23:22, 22 October 2006 (UTC) Allen Roth</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Is Wikipedia a PR Flak for Senator Obama?</span></h2>
<p>Re-reading this article, it sure seems like Sen Obama can do no wrong. Despite his partisan voting record, he is presented as seeking some middle ground. His vacant pronouncements about national unity are taken at face value, while his voting record and campaigning are completely New Deal Democrat. Any addition, by myself and others, that mention the Senator's actual voting record are removed via Wikilawyering and some completely partisan editors. If "this page is about an active politician who is running for office, is in office and campaigning for re-election, or is involved in some political conflict or controversy. Because of this, this article is at risk of biased editing, talk-page trolling, and simple vandalism", shouldn't this article be editted to remove cheerleading and POV?--<a href="../../../j/b/p/User%7EJbpo_d43b.html" title="User:Jbpo">Jbpo</a> 15:10, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I strongly agree. To tell everyone the truth, I am quite surprised that this is even a featured article. Compared to the Hurricane Katrina FA, it does not seem to possess a FA's level of content or quality. The main reason in support of that belief is that this article seems to indicate that Barack's beliefs and/or polcies have never engendered controversy. Many, and I mean many, of the other articles of prominent politicians have sections devoted to controversy. Lieberman's page has an entire section on "Bush's kiss," something that could be summed up in two to three sentences. This article seems POV to me; we should at least rename it Barack for Senate(jk). Seriously though, I propose a POV tag. <b><i><a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_great_kawa_b4db.html" title="User:The great kawa"><font color="green">The great kawa</font></a></i></b> 09:18, 17 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>If you guys have any notable controversies to add, then please do so. Obama is the kind of Senator who tries to avoid controversy, so it's no surprise that there aren't any on the page.

<dd>I agree, and you can add the state bill voting record (see talk section above) to your list.

<p>The controversy that Obama avoids is mostly due to the press not reporting his voting record. The miserable editor/censors here on Wikipedia have effectively drowned out any reporting on actual votes by the Senator and his positions on issues and replaced it with fawning (and quite distorted) coverage of how popular Obama is. Could his popularity have something to do with the suppression of his actual positions and voting record by the Chicago Media AND Wikipedia? --<a href="../../../j/b/p/User%7EJbpo_d43b.html" title="User:Jbpo">Jbpo</a> 17:08, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I believe that Obama's page should at least have sections devoted to some controversial decisions of his (like those stated above) even if that involves statements from certain organizations that do not support his liberal views and positions on certain issues. I mean Steve Irwin's article has a section on people who are glad he is dead and their criticisms on his death. I am not saying that this article should be turned into that, but I do believe anybody who comes to his page looking for specific issues or positions that he has taken that have created controversy, will think that he has had none. <b><i><a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_great_kawa_b4db.html" title="User:The great kawa"><font color="green">The great kawa</font></a></i></b> 19:03, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Things get removed and re-added all the time. You just have to make your case here on the Talk page and build consensus. As far as your examples, it's important to note that Senators make lots of votes. We can't mention all of them; only the most notable ones. I did a Google search for "Obama" and "Bridge to Nowhere" and the only things I found were a quote from Obama where he actually states his opposition to projects like the Bridge to Nowhere and a comment from you on another website where you criticize Obama for 2 of the things you mention above. So I think that's an example of something that definitely does not belong in the article. I do think the Rezko thing belongs in the article. He's not exactly a "fugitive felon", but he is notable because Obama returned his contribution <a href="../../../m/a/x/User%7EMaximusveritas_5f31.html" title="User:Maximusveritas">Maximusveritas</a> 19:20, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Aside from being a fugitive charged with a felony, how is Antoin Rezko NOT a fugitive felon...anyway...you folks are proving my point quite well. It is common knowledge among everyone interested in Illinois politics that Obama traded his support for the Bridge to Nowhere for support for the I-355 extension (so did Hastert btw). However you will not find that info in the Tribune or SunTimes, and even the slightest mention of Obama supporting the Bridge to Nowhere get censored here, although his vote speaks for itself. Why even have an alternative media if only the MSM drivel is repeated about what an upstanding citizen and unifying force Senator Obama is, despite his partisan voting record, and various sellouts of the voters. Read the below info on why Obama questionable votes are not controversial. Why not just publish a few of his votes, and a few of the questionable things he campaigns for (tariffs for example, while he was one of the bigger abusers of flying around in ADM's private jets from function to function) and let the reader decide if it is controversial?--<a href="../../../j/b/p/User%7EJbpo_d43b.html" title="User:Jbpo">Jbpo</a> 23:25, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

The article currently includes a section titled "<a href="../../../b/a/r/Barack_Obama_6463.html#Sponsored_legislation" title="Barack Obama">Sponsored legislation</a>" which also discusses his votes on other legislation. I've never been opposed to including such a subsection, and even suggested <a href="../../../b/a/r/Talk%7EBarack_Obama_36f7.html#Subdividing_.22Senate_Career.22.3F" title="Talk:Barack Obama">something similar</a> on this talk page awhile back. Even the vote on the "bridge to nowhere" is currently discussed in the article. It was, initially, removed several times because of (1) improper sourcing, (2) deceptive use of sources, and (3) NPOV violations. My guess is that it was removed again recently in the course of HailFire's edits to overhaul the article. But it's back now. Regarding Illinois state bills, there was <a href="../../../b/a/r/Talk%7EBarack_Obama_36f7.html#Illinois_state_bills" title="Talk:Barack Obama">a discussion</a> on this talk page about that. Basically, it came down to assertions of notability and such about bills without any <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>, if I remember correctly. Finally, Rezko. It seems Obama received a donation from a person who is now a convicted felon, but was not at the time he donated the money to Obama. Obama returned the money. Numerous other Democratic politicians in Illinois received money from the guy. Do I have the story right? If so, why is such information warranted in this article instead of in an article about the donor himself? Obviously, if consensus favors including it here, fine, but it is only now being discussed on this talk page. · <b><a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJersyko_510d.html" title="User:Jersyko"><font color="#707070">j e r s y k o</font></a></b> <i><a href="../../../j/e/r/User_talk%7EJersyko_3ca3.html" title="User talk:Jersyko"><font color="#465945" size="1">talk</font></a></i> · 22:31, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Jerseyko's opinions show through on his editting. It is impossible to post something as simple as (indicted felon) Tony Rezko being a campaign donor to Obama without facing censorship from Jerseyko or Hailfire regardless of the validity of the sources or the factual nature of the stories. They just refuse to allow facts to be publish that may reflect negatively on the Senator. It ruins the tone of the whole article. If Obama took money from a (accused) crook, lets hear about it. Why bury it? So he gave it back, publish it and let the reader decide if there was a quid pro quo. If a posting if verified, or verifiable, then leave it alone or verify it: quit censoring posts that do not fit your point of view.--<a href="../../../j/b/p/User%7EJbpo_d43b.html" title="User:Jbpo">Jbpo</a> 01:56, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>CP/M, thank you for your intervention here. I think it is helping us to make some progress. This article was named a FA in 2004, but please compare any <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Barack_Obama&amp;oldid=66321298|" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Barack_Obama&amp;oldid=66321298|" rel="nofollow">version from just before August 2006</a> when the overhauling began. You will see this article had become disordered, full of scattered facts and unattributed POV or rah rah statements with either no citations or weak citations. A lot of writing, reorganizing, and research has gone into cleaning those up and improving quality, as well as adhering to the higher FA verifiability standards of 2006. I do not think anyone is trying to bury anything significant. My own contributions have mostly been improvements to existing details found in the article, and plenty of scattered or less contemporary facts have been shifted around. See for example the new article created to accommodate expansive details on the <a href="../../../i/l/l/Illinois_United_States_Senate_election%2C_2004_ed89.html" title="Illinois United States Senate election, 2004">2006 Senate race</a>.

<p>Hailfire, you English skills are quite fine, and the article has better organization than it did before your edits, but there is still the major issue of removal of information. I think you (and most Wiki editors) should work on editting, rather than removing statements. The "cleanup" you performed, while fixing some format issues, also happened to delete important information about Senator Obama. This article needs less censorius Wikilawyering, which harshly but accurately describes your defense of deletions, and more facts. --<a href="../../../j/b/p/User%7EJbpo_d43b.html" title="User:Jbpo">Jbpo</a> 12:24, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Your response is more appropriate for the talk section, but in general, unwarranted. You can use the link to the source for that information at HillMonitor, which works much like any other hypertext link. If you can click through first, rather than deleting my entry, you might discover that Obama is 88th, not 12th on voting with the Republicans and 4th in voting with the Democrats. Other commentators have (rightly) interpreted this as a partisan voting record. I suppose it could be phrased differently, but it is pretty much another of a series of facts that you have deleted.--<a href="../../../j/b/p/User%7EJbpo_d43b.html" title="User:Jbpo">Jbpo</a> 17:23, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I agree with the original poster. This article reads like a press release from Obama's office. The one line of "criticism" is utterly hilarious. Check out any other senator's site (especially a REPUBLICAN senator's site, and you'll see scads of criticism - even from first-termers. I don't know enough about Obama's record to add critiques, but I guess that's the point. The media and now Wikipedia have been so fauning it's impossible to get a fair viewing of the man and his record. This is a common problem on WP, and must be addressed by neutral observers if it hopes to remain a good resource. - <a href="../../../n/h/p/User%7ENhprman_7c20.html" title="User:Nhprman">Nhprman</a> <a href="../../../n/h/p/User%7ENhprman_Userinterestlist_56e3.html" title="User:Nhprman/Userinterestlist"><small><sup>List</sup></small></a> 01:12, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Not exactly the media's fault. The missing facts in this article are mostly due to Jersyko. He tends to remove anything that does not sound favorable to the esteemed Senator. There is plenty of negative information in the local media about Obama (Tony Rezko anyone? Sponsoring the mafia-linked Treasurer candidate? Skipping a Better Government meeting in Chicago, while lecturing Kenyans on corruption?), it just gets removed from the Wikipedia entry and ignored by Obama cheerleaders.--<a href="../../../j/b/p/User%7EJbpo_d43b.html" title="User:Jbpo">Jbpo</a> 22:16, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

You are mostly to blame for the deletions in this article and for wikilawyering any dissenting views out of the editorial content.

When you added the information back, I reworded it to read what the source actually says after finally confirming what the source was hillmonitor.com, which uses an IP in its urls for some reason.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Voting record subsection</span></h2>
<p>Actually, I think a section titled "voting record" goes too far. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information</a>, after all. I'm not aware of any other Senator articles that have such a subsection. What is common practice, however, is to have a subsection on the Senator's political views and ideology, listing a few pertinent votes or sponsored legislation as evidence where no better evidence exists. See, for instance, <a href="../../../t/e/d/Ted_Kennedy_7459.html#Political_views" title="Ted Kennedy">Ted Kennedy#Political views</a> and <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Frist_4763.html#Ideology_and_issues" title="Bill Frist">Bill Frist#Ideology and issues</a> (I'm not saying these articles should be used as templates for this one, of course). "Voting record" is just too broad and indiscriminate to include in an encyclopedia article, whereas "political views and ideology" focuses a bit more on the person's views on prominent political issues. · <b><a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJersyko_510d.html" title="User:Jersyko"><font color="#707070">j e r s y k o</font></a></b> <i><a href="../../../j/e/r/User_talk%7EJersyko_3ca3.html" title="User talk:Jersyko"><font color="#465945" size="1">talk</font></a></i> · 14:52, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hailfire, that is exactly the point. The reader can see that Obama talks one way and votes another, but only if it is published, not suppressed. It is common knowledge that Hastert and Obama traded the Bridge to Nowhere for the I355 extension (which is being built right now), but that is insider politics stuff. The verifiable point is that Sen. Obama votes differently that his press releases would have you believe (pro-tariff, pro-pork, pro-tax) but repeating his press releases will not provide that information, (nor does disguising the Bridge to Nowehre as the Gravina Island Bridge provide much useful information)--<a href="../../../j/b/p/User%7EJbpo_d43b.html" title="User:Jbpo">Jbpo</a> 19:40, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This Contro section is a basic definition of capitulation to the mainstream media and using wikilawyering to censor information that does not fit ones own views. The #1 defense of a wikilawyer is always 'this is not wikilawyering' as the censor uses lawyerly nonsense to purge facts from their flak. As HailFire is one of the offenders I am pleading against, why not let Obama's record speak for itself rather than editting out the Senators actual record? Why do you insist on taking out information like felon Rezko supporting Obama? Perhaps it needed cut down, but why not let the (well documented)facts come out somewhere rather than acting as a censor?--<a href="../../../j/b/p/User%7EJbpo_d43b.html" title="User:Jbpo">Jbpo</a> 01:56, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I dont believe this section should be included in the article. Yes, it is sourced. I am not denying that. How is it notable? Does the average person know about this? No Does the average voter? No Does the average policy wonk know about this? No Was Obama the target of an investigation? No Was Obama the main target of news reports? No. I am not saying that this does not belong in wikipedia. However, ths should be mentioned on the Rezko page and not have its own "controvery" section here. How is this controversial? This is nothing. Here is the section:</p>

<ul>
<li>Illinois businessman <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antoin_Rezko_f025.html" title="Antoin Rezko">Antoin Rezko</a> hosted a 2003 fundraiser for primary candidate Obama, raising $11,500 on top of $8,500 Rezko had earlier raised for Obama's campaign for the Illinois state legislature. Rezko was later charged with participation in a scheme involving the Illinois state Teacher's Retirement System, prompting Obama to return the $11,500.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup></li>

<dd>I think this is more about relevance than notability. It is <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> in a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a>. But why is this particularly relevant to Obama? He got money from a donor who, at the time Obama received the donation, was not convicted or accused of anything. And not only did Obama get donations from the guy, but numerous other politicians did as well. In fact, others received more sizeable donations than Obama, <i>including <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W._Bush_315d.html" title="George W. Bush">George W. Bush</a></i>. Once Obama found out about the guy's illegal activities, he gave the money to charity. All of this stuff clearly belongs in an article about Rezko (and one <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antoin_Rezko_f025.html" title="Antoin Rezko">exists</a>). But why here? If here, why not in Bush's article and each of the other numerous politicians he gave money to as well? Should Wikipedia discuss donors who are later accused or convicted of a crime in each politician's article that has received a political donation from such a person? I posit that such information, given that none of the politicians were complicit in receiving any illegal donations in this case (or at least in Obama's case), is irrelevant, or at least nearly so, in any of these politician articles. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> indicates that such information does not belong in these politician's articles. · <b><a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJersyko_510d.html" title="User:Jersyko"><font color="#707070">j e r s y k o</font></a></b> <i><a href="../../../j/e/r/User_talk%7EJersyko_3ca3.html" title="User talk:Jersyko"><font color="#465945" size="1">talk</font></a></i> · 00:08, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I agree completely. This section should be in an article about that years election cycle or about Rezko. Even in those article this only merits a brief mention.

<p>Obama certainly knew that Rezko was a aggressive Illinois political animal when he took the money. Rezko has had his hand in a huge amount of government contracting when he gave so generously to candidate Obama. Either Obama was aware of Rezko's manipulations or incompetent in not knowing a major backer was a schemer. Why not edit it to a managable length and publish? Rezko is in a huge controversy for pay-to-play politics. How about bringing up the question at least, was Obama involved in a quid pro quo with an indicted felon?

<dd>J23 Having had nearly 25 factual entries (with citatation) concerning Sen Obama deleted, I am not a likely candidate as a "bully". Your politeness is certainly welcome here. My point is that a factual entry that complies with standards should not be removed, but editted for format etc, rather than debated to death for inclusion/non-inclusion. A team of editors stands ready to remove any entry that does not serve as PR for Sen Obama, and they are very willing to discuss, wikilawyer, delete without comment.

I would ask you to please stop with the wikilawyering and team of PR editors accusations. It gets tiring. Especially when you say the same thing in every comment.

<dd>J23, in general, no, we do not need to go through the inclusion/exclusion process for compliant edits, but perhaps, with regard to Tony Rezko it is called for..Rezko is a major donor to Illinois Democrats (and a few Republicans). There is major unexplored issue as to what has been provided to Rezko in return for his donations, for example, seats on Illinois Healthcare Failities Planning boards. How about we leave an open ended entry for a while as Blago, Obama, Madigan, Stroeger may be charged in the next few months with providing quid pro quo to Tony Rezko for his donations. A short entry noting that Obama has a long relationship with Rezko seems very appropriate. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../j/b/p/User%7EJbpo_d43b.html" title="User:Jbpo">Jbpo</a> (<a href="../../../j/b/p/User_talk%7EJbpo_63b2.html" title="User talk:Jbpo">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jbpo_a89d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jbpo">contribs</a>) .</small>

<dd>Thank you for your response. Unexplored issues and people possibly being charged in the future do not make this a legit item for inclusion in this article.

Does this line warrant a mention in the introductory paragraph? I would argue absolutely, as this isn't POV, cites an unquestionable source, and is an important characteristic of Obama's. The article needs to recognise very early why Obama is so notable as a politician, and does so effectively, but this sentence is just as important in the introduction as any other.

<p>Why is "only currently serving" notable? I could very well go to many articles and add unneeded facts about something that is liable to change. What if he dies, what will it say then? "Was the only currently serving African-American."</p>
<p>I've dropped trying to change the line, (he is the only currently serving black/white biracial too, but that doesn't seem to matter at all) so it should be dropped entirely. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShakam_b4e8.html" title="User:Shakam">Shakam</a> 15:17, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Unless you are prepared to say that John F. Kennedy's status as the only Roman Catholic president is unimportant (and delete that fact from the article on him), please stop propagating the notion that Barack Obama's status as the only African-American senator is unimportant. We all know that it is. You may or may not like hearing it, but it matters. The very fact that you keep deleting it from the article proves that it matters more than you're willing to admit.

<p>Do you have any records that say it is notable? (I know now you want to ask, "Do you have any that say it isn't?") Well, you don't need evidence for something that isn't but you need some for what is. This sentence is liable to change and has no significance towards this article.</p>
<p>On JFK: I would say it is unimportant, because it's a Christian religion; furthermore, if Bush were to convert to Catholicism today it would negate that fact. Only notable thing I see being added as a qualifier for a description is if the president was a non-Christian, e.g. Muslim, Buddhist, etc. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShakam_b4e8.html" title="User:Shakam">Shakam</a> 01:42, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Even though the Senate Historical Site may be reliable, it isn't reliable in the way it describes him.

How can you cite something deviating from the common belief, especially of what is notable?</p>

<dd>No, I didn't. You're talking about how the U.S. Government was wrong about something in the past. I don't see a metaphor, I see a description of something that actually happened. If the inference is that the government is that the government has been wrong before, so it might be wrong here too, I agree. But I fail to see how the argument effectively assails the reliability of the 2006 Senate website for information about Senators. As I've said before, I'm generally sympathetic to your normative point, but the fact that you're arguing in the normative is a problem when we're dealing with article content, which must not adhere to Wikipedia policy, not what one *thinks* it should adhere to. Finally, why are you seemingly randomly linking to the Wikitruth article? What relevance does this have to information in the Barack Obama article?

<p>If I may, I am not one to edit things I merely come here for information that I hope is accurate and spot-checked (I know that makes me bad too). As an African American, I simply wanted to interject my thoughts on this situation and you all can take it and change it as you will. I feel that it is equally racist than anything else to call him African-American only. There was (in some places it is still) a time where one drop of "black blood" made you black and most people would argue that that is racist. Mr. Obama is multiracial not just black. To identify him as African American is equally as fair as to identify him as white in that he is equal parts. Because the media and in my humble opinion the Democratic party chooses to (for political gains) show his African family and in many cases hide his white family (I can Google and find pictures of his African family who he only met recently but if I look for his white family who he grew up with they are nearly non existent), does not mean that he is black or African American or whatever else. I'm not saying as a black person I would "kick him out the club" I'm saying if we are going to be accurate then tell the truth he is multiracial otherwise its equally correct to call him white. One can identify as they choose (a white person from South African who naturalized to the United States claims to be an African American that would be true but to read that on paper would in people's minds at least invoke other feelings and thoughts that may be inaccurate) but for the sake of the truth and accuracy for those who may not know better I would hope that you all take this into consideration.

<li>Applauses* Thank you!!!!! This is what I have been trying to pitch to them for the longest, but they do not want to hear it. Your input is greatly appreciated by me. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShakam_b4e8.html" title="User:Shakam">Shakam</a> 04:23, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Almost every long profile I have read about Obama in major media sources since 2004 (<a href="http://www.senate.gov/pagelayout/history/h_multi_sections_and_teasers/Photo_Exhibit_African_American_Senators.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.senate.gov/pagelayout/history/h_multi_sections_and_teasers/Photo_Exhibit_African_American_Senators.htm" rel="nofollow">and the Senate itself, evidently</a>) makes note of him being the Senate's only current African-American. Evidently, then, this is a salient fact. Yes, <i>in an ideal world</i> it would not matter what his racial background is, and no politicians would ever use race issues to win votes. But we don't live in that world. We should not be using Wikipedia as a means of pushing for racial harmony. Also, the article <i>does</i> say that he is not just African-American, but that he has a white mother, i.e. is white. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Levine_ad03.html" title="User:Andrew Levine">Andrew Levine</a> 01:27, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The real world is what you make it. And, just because something is wide-spread does not make it a fact, ignorance is a factor. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShakam_b4e8.html" title="User:Shakam">Shakam</a> 02:46, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I think the real problem here is one that is beyond the scope of this article. Most biologists will tell you that the idea of race is a purely social construction. It is almost impossible to identify people consistently by race based on genetics (even with mitochondrial DNA mapping for those who know). There is more difference between a white man and a white woman than between a black man and a white man (assuming the social labels "black" and "white") Race is very much a social construction. Barack Obama is "black" only because he appears to have a skin coloration that is associated with "African Americans." There is no real reason for this. He does not socially fit into stereotypical "African American" or "black" culture. He is as "African American" as Theresa Heinz. His upbrining and cultural roots are CLEARLY not culturally aligned with the stereotypical "American black." What really becomes clear is that in Obama's case our comfortable but largely irrelevant racial classes break down to absurdity. The same holds true for Tiger Woods and many other multi racial individuals. Is it fair to label Obama "black" when he is just as much "black" as "white?"</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>The real issue is whether the social application of "African American" to Obama is significant. Is he suddenly "African American" because several media sources say so? Could we equally say he is one of several Hawaiian American or Kansasian American senators? Perhaps a rewording to "such and such source identifies Obama as the only..." would be appropriate. The problem of race categorization is well beyond the scope of this article and should probably be the focus of a Wikipedia guideline. <a href="../../../r/t/r/User%7ERtrev_b641.html" title="User:Rtrev">Rtrev</a> 03:45, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The problem with "such and such source identifies Obama as the only..." is that the list of sources is almost endless, and they include Obama himself. See for yourself:

<dd>I stopped there but could easily go on. When editing Wikipedia, we put aside our own ideas of whether race is real or only a social construct. We do not base articles on our own opinons of what it means to be a white American or an African American or a Kansan-Kenyan American, and whether labels like these are of any relevance at all. We report on what the reliable sources say. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Levine_ad03.html" title="User:Andrew Levine">Andrew Levine</a> 04:48, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>By the way, here's Obama in his own words:
<ul>
<li><i>"I think most people are aware of my biography and I think appreciate the fact that not only <b>as the African-American senator</b>, but also a senator whose father was from the African continent, that I've got a special interest in these issues."</i> <a href="http://obama.senate.gov/news/050718-obama_draws_on_african_roots_as_he_steps_onto_global_stage_with_sudan/index.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://obama.senate.gov/news/050718-obama_draws_on_african_roots_as_he_steps_onto_global_stage_with_sudan/index.html" rel="nofollow">[15]</a>.</li>
<li><i>"As a law professor and civil rights lawyer and <b>as an African American</b>, I am fully aware of [Lincoln's] limited views on race."</i> <a href="http://obama.senate.gov/news/050627-what_i_see_in_lincolns_eyes/index.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://obama.senate.gov/news/050627-what_i_see_in_lincolns_eyes/index.html" rel="nofollow">[16]</a>.</li>
<li><i>"<b>My view has always been that I'm African-American</b>," he said. "African Americans by definition, we're a hybrid people. One of things I loved about my mother was not only did she not feel rejected by me defining myself as an African-American, but she recognized that I was a black man in the United States and my experiences were going to be different than hers."</i> <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/columnists/chi-0403150115mar15,1,3734322.column?coll=chi-navrailnews-nav" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/columnists/chi-0403150115mar15,1,3734322.column?coll=chi-navrailnews-nav" rel="nofollow">[17]</a> <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Levine_ad03.html" title="User:Andrew Levine">Andrew Levine</a> 05:01, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> is stupid. You can't have a neutral point of view and say that information is based on verifiability, not truth. I have a question, why can't we add all of the other appositives that he is currently in the U.S.? He is also the only black/white biracial senator, senator with recent Kenyan ancestors, etc. Who decides that "African-American" is the most important?</p>
<p>African American - a black American of African descent. <sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup> Biracial - consisting of, representing, or combining members of two separate races <sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>Now tell me, which applies more to Barack Obama from a neutral point of view knowing what both of his parents are? Dictionary.com is a reliable source. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShakam_b4e8.html" title="User:Shakam">Shakam</a> 05:15, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>He's both African-American and biracial. I do not dispute that. But as shown above, most major media sources in the U.S. and others around the world have mentioned that he is "African-American." The Senate terms him "African-American." Obama calls himself "African American." He has even called himself "the African American senator." They all seem to think it's relevant, even if you don't. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Levine_ad03.html" title="User:Andrew Levine">Andrew Levine</a> 05:25, 27 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I think the point is that he and several other major verifiable sources have named him such. Unless there is a groundswell against the nomenclature in verifiable sources we cannot say otherwise per WP guidelines. However, I would like to note the dissent on the talk page at least (see my above statements). <a href="../../../r/t/r/User%7ERtrev_b641.html" title="User:Rtrev">Rtrev</a> 05:36, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Wikipedia is not a democracy. I thought it operated by concensus. At any rate, *sigh* African-American and biracial are not synonymous. Aren't news articles just adhering to social construction anyway when they are written? It seems that the dictionary can only be used to give accurate definitions of words, because that is the only thing it does. People must learn to think on a subject for themselves without the help of others. But that will never be the case, as was the case with Patrick Henry, people are idle-minded and need to be lead. "Give us liberty, or give us death." <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShakam_b4e8.html" title="User:Shakam">Shakam</a> 05:34, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, news articles adhere to social constructs. So does Wikipedia. The core of this dispute, I think, is that you want Wikipedia to be something it isn't. Wikipedia isn't supposed to be an instrument for social change. It is not for smashing existing social norms, however wrongheaded and false they may be. It is not an instrument for promoting novel ideas or activism of any kind. It is a collection of knowledge that has already been published and verified. You hit the nail on the head when you say we follow rather than lead. When we edit Wikipedia articles, we aren't <i>allowed</i> to think for ourselves. If you want to advance your own personal views on race, and convince people of their truth, you will need to find another outlet for them. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Levine_ad03.html" title="User:Andrew Levine">Andrew Levine</a> 05:48, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Congrats to everyone here on this article -- pro &amp; con -- compliment to Wikipedia generally -- with all the noise &amp; fluff so available now, about this guy, that it literally is pouring down on all of our heads, this article is the best resource I've found so far for learning about Barack Obama. Can't say the same for all the other Wikipedia articles I've read, although there have been some other good ones... As long as Wikipedia is up to this sort of quality, not only will it be of great value to those of us in the US who may want to vote for Obama some day, it also -- because it's on the nets and so accessible -- will explain the Obama Phenom to foreigners, who wonder what in blazes we think we're doing over here in our politics, sometimes. So, kudos.</p>
