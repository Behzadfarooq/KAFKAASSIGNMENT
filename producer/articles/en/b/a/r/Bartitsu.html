<p>In 1898, <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_William_Barton-Wright_d429.html" title="Edward William Barton-Wright">Edward William Barton-Wright</a>, a <a href="../../../b/r/i/Briton.html" title="Briton">British</a> <a href="../../../e/n/g/Engineer.html" title="Engineer">engineer</a> who had been building <a href="../../../r/a/i/Railway.html" title="Railway">railways</a> in <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japan.html" title="Japan">Japan</a>, returned to England and announced the formation of a "New Art of Self Defence".<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> This art, he claimed, combined the best elements of a range of fighting styles into a unified whole, which he had named Bartitsu.

<p>As detailed in a series of articles Barton-Wright produced for <i>Pearson's Magazine</i> between 1899 and 1904, Bartitsu was largely drawn from the <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shinden_Fudo_Ryu_3030.html" title="Shinden Fudo Ryu">Shinden Fudo</a> and <a href="../../../t/e/n/Tenjin_Shinyo-ryu_c96c.html" title="Tenjin Shinyo-ryu">Tenjin-Shinyo</a> schools of <a href="../../../k/o/r/Koryu.html" title="Koryu"><i>koryu</i></a> ("classical") <a href="../../../j/u/j/Jujutsu.html" title="Jujutsu">jujutsu</a> and from <a href="../../../k/o/d/Kodokan.html" title="Kodokan">Kodokan</a> <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judo.html" title="Judo">judo</a>. The art also incorporated combat techniques from British <a href="../../../b/o/x/Boxing.html" title="Boxing">boxing</a> and <a href="../../../w/r/e/Wrestling.html" title="Wrestling">wrestling</a>, French <a href="../../../s/a/v/Savate.html" title="Savate">savate</a>, and a defensive <a href="../../../s/t/i/Stick_fighting.html" title="Stick fighting">stick fighting</a> style that had been developed by Professeur <a href="../../../p/i/e/Pierre_Vigny_51b2.html" title="Pierre Vigny">Pierre Vigny</a> of <a href="../../../s/w/i/Switzerland.html" title="Switzerland">Switzerland</a>.</p>

<dd>Under Bartitsu is included boxing, or the use of the fist as a hitting medium, the use of the feet both in an offensive and defensive sense, the use of the walking stick as a means of self-defence. Judo and jujitsu, which were secret styles of Japanese wrestling, he would call close play as applied to self-defence.</dd>

<dd>In order to ensure as far as it was possible immunity against injury in cowardly attacks or quarrels, they must understand boxing in order to thoroughly appreciate the danger and rapidity of a well-directed blow, and the particular parts of the body which were scientifically attacked.

<dd>Judo and jujitsu were not designed as primary means of attack and defence against a boxer or a man who kicks you, but were only to be used after coming to close quarters, and in order to get to close quarters it was absolutely necessary to understand boxing and the use of the foot.</dd>

<p>Between 1898 and 1904, Barton-Wright set about publicising his art through magazine articles, interviews and a series of demonstrations or "assaults at arms" at various <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a> venues. He established a school known as the Bartitsu Club, which was located at #67b <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shaftesbury_Avenue_4dec.html" title="Shaftesbury Avenue">Shaftesbury Avenue</a> in <a href="../../../s/o/h/Soho.html" title="Soho">Soho</a>. In an article for <i>Sandow's Magazine</i> published in <a href="../../../1/9/0/1902.html" title="1902">1902</a>, journalist Mary Nugent described the Bartitsu Club as "... a huge subterranean hall, all glittering, white-tiled walls, and electric light, with 'champions' prowling around it like tigers."<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>Barton-Wright arranged for Japanese jujutsu practitioners <a href="../../../y/u/k/Yukio_Tani_b943.html" title="Yukio Tani">Yukio Tani</a> and Sadekazu Uyenishi to travel to London and serve as instructors at the Bartitsu Club. Swiss master-at-arms Pierre Vigny and wrestler Armand Cherpillod were also employed as teachers at the Club. As well as teaching well-to-do Londoners, their duties included performing demonstrations and competing in challenge matches against fighters representing other combat styles.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[5]</a></sup> In addition, the Club became the headquarters for a group of <a href="../../../f/e/n/Fencing.html" title="Fencing">fencing</a> <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antiquarians.html" title="Antiquarians">antiquarians</a> led by <a href="../../../e/g/e/Egerton_Castle_47e1.html" title="Egerton Castle">Egerton Castle</a> and Captain <a href="../../../a/l/f/Alfred_Hutton_64d0.html" title="Alfred Hutton">Alfred Hutton</a>, and it served as their base for experimenting with <a href="../../../h/i/s/Historical_fencing.html" title="Historical fencing">historical fencing</a> techniques, which they taught to members of London's acting elite for use in <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stage_combat.html" title="Stage combat">stage combat</a>.<sup id="_ref-wolf_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-wolf" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Bartitsu Club membership included <a href="../../../c/o/s/Cosmo_Duff_Gordon_f84c.html" title="Cosmo Duff Gordon">Sir Cosmo Duff Gordon</a>, who was later to achieve notoriety as one of the few adult male survivors of the sinking of the <a href="../../../r/m/s/RMS_Titanic_9d7a.html" title="RMS Titanic">RMS Titanic</a>, as well as Captain F.C. Laing of the 12th Bengal Infantry, who subsequently wrote an article on Bartitsu stick fighting techniques which was published in the <i>Journal of the United Service Institution of India</i>.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>Barton-Wright later reported that, during this period, he had challenged and defeated seven larger men within three minutes as part of a Bartitsu demonstration he gave at St. James's Hall. He said this feat earned him a membership in the prestigious <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_London%27s_gentlemen%27s_clubs_05aa.html" title="List of London's gentlemen's clubs">Bath Club</a> and also a Royal Command to appear before <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_VII_of_the_United_Kingdom_9851.html" title="Edward VII of the United Kingdom">Edward, Prince of Wales</a>.<sup id="_ref-koizumi_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-koizumi" title="">[7]</a></sup> Unfortunately, Barton-Wright then suffered an injury to his hand, due either to a fight in a <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kent.html" title="Kent">Kentish</a> country lane or a bicycling accident, which prevented him from appearing before the Prince.<sup id="_ref-nugent_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-nugent" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/r/Bartitsu.html" title="Edit section: Bartitsu as a self defence method">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Bartitsu as a self defence method</span></h2>
<p>It is unclear whether Barton-Wright ever devised a formal <a href="../../../c/u/r/Curriculum.html" title="Curriculum">curriculum</a> for Bartitsu as a self defence method. Rather, he encouraged members of the Bartitsu Club to study each of the four major hand-to-hand combat styles taught at the Club, with the goal of mastering each style well enough that they could be used against the others if needed. This process was similar to the modern concept of <a href="../../../c/r/o/Cross-training.html" title="Cross-training">cross-training</a>.</p>
<p>Based on Barton-Wright's writings upon this subject, contemporary researchers believe that Bartitsu placed greatest emphasis upon the Vigny cane fighting system at the striking range and upon jujutsu (and, secondarily, the "all-in" style of European wrestling) at the grappling range. Savate and boxing were used to bridge the gap between these two ranges, or as a means of first response should the defender not be armed with a walking stick.<sup id="_ref-wolf_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-wolf" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>According to interviewer Mary Nugent, Barton-Wright instituted an unusual pedagogical system whereby students were first required to attend private training sessions before being allowed to join class groups.<sup id="_ref-nugent_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-nugent" title="">[8]</a></sup> It is currently believed that both private and group classes included pre-arranged exercises, especially for use in rehearsing those techniques that were too dangerous to be performed at full speed or contact, as well as free-sparring and fencing bouts.<sup id="_ref-wolf_3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-wolf" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Many Bartitsu self defence techniques and sequences were recorded by Barton-Wright himself in his series of articles for <i>Pearson's Magazine.</i> The specific details of other Bartitsu stick fighting training drills were recorded in Captain Laing's article.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/r/Bartitsu.html" title="Edit section: The decline of Bartitsu">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The decline of Bartitsu</span></h2>
<p>Despite his enthusiasm, Barton-Wright seems to have been a mediocre promoter and the fame of his associates and their jujutsu quickly eclipsed that of Bartitsu. By 1903, the Bartitsu Club had closed its doors for the last time; subsequent speculation had it that the enrollment and tuition fees were too high. Barton-Wright's assistants, including jujutsuka Yukio Tani and Sadekazu Uyenishi and Swiss self defence expert Pierre Vigny, established their own gymnasia in London. After breaking with Barton-Wright, purportedly due to an argument and a fight, Tani also continued his work as a professional <a href="../../../m/u/s/Music-hall.html" title="Music-hall">music-hall</a> wrestler under the shrewd management of William Bankier, a strength performer who went by the stage name of "Apollo".<sup id="_ref-koizumi_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-koizumi" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>Although Barton-Wright may have continued to develop and teach his art at least until the 1920s, it never again returned to prominence. Bartitsu might have been completely forgotten if not for a chance mention by <a href="../../../s/i/r/Sir_Arthur_Conan_Doyle_017d.html" title="Sir Arthur Conan Doyle">Sir Arthur Conan Doyle</a> in one of his <a href="../../../s/h/e/Sherlock_Holmes_4282.html" title="Sherlock Holmes">Sherlock Holmes</a> mystery stories. In <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Adventure_of_the_Empty_House_b4bd.html" title="The Adventure of the Empty House">"The Adventure of the Empty House"</a> (1903), Holmes explained that he had escaped the clutches of his enemy <a href="../../../p/r/o/Professor_Moriarty_f2fa.html" title="Professor Moriarty">Professor Moriarty</a> through his knowledge of "<a href="../../../b/a/r/Baritsu.html" title="Baritsu">baritsu</a>, or Japanese wrestling". Doyle mis-spelled the name of the art; this, in addition to the <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anachronism.html" title="Anachronism">anachronism</a> of portraying Bartitsu in a story set several years before the art had been invented, was enough to intrigue and confuse Holmesian scholars for most of the next century.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p>E.W. Barton-Wright spent the rest of his career working as a physical therapist specialising in innovative (and sometimes controversial) forms of heat, light, and radiation <a href="../../../t/h/e/Therapy.html" title="Therapy">therapy</a>.<sup id="_ref-wolf_4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-wolf" title="">[2]</a></sup> He died in 1951, at the age of 90, and was buried in what the late martial arts historian Richard Bowen described as being "a pauper's grave."<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>

<p>In many ways, E.W. Barton-Wright was a man ahead of his time. He was among the first Europeans known to have studied the <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japanese_martial_arts.html" title="Japanese martial arts">Japanese martial arts</a>, and was almost certainly the first to have taught them in Europe.</p>
<p>Bartitsu was probably the first martial art to have deliberately combined Asian and European fighting styles towards addressing the problems of civilian/urban <a href="../../../s/e/l/Self-defense.html" title="Self-defense">self-defence</a> in an "unarmed society". In this, Barton-Wright anticipated <a href="../../../b/r/u/Bruce_Lee_368a.html" title="Bruce Lee">Bruce Lee</a>'s <a href="../../../j/e/e/Jeet_Kune_Do_22ff.html" title="Jeet Kune Do">Jeet Kune Do</a> approach by over seventy years. Barton-Wright's philosophy of <a href="../../../p/r/a/Pragmatism_%28non-technical_usage%29.html" title="Pragmatism (non-technical usage)">pragmatic</a> <a href="../../../e/c/l/Eclecticism.html" title="Eclecticism">eclecticism</a> was taken up by other early 20th century European self-defence specialists, including Percy Longhurst, George Dubois and Jean-Joseph Renaud, all of whom had studied with former Bartitsu Club instructors.<sup id="_ref-wolf_5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-wolf" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>A similar philosophy was later to be embraced by Bill Underwood, <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_E._Fairbairn_393a.html" title="William E. Fairbairn">William E. Fairbairn</a> and others charged with developing <a href="../../../c/l/o/Close_combat.html" title="Close combat">close combat</a> systems for use by <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allies_of_World_War_II_afb4.html" title="Allies of World War II">Allied</a> troops during the <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_World_War_e58d.html" title="Second World War">Second World War</a>. Underwood had actually studied jujutsu with Yukio Tani and another jujutsuka, <a href="../../../t/a/r/Taro_Miyake_4b64.html" title="Taro Miyake">Taro Miyake</a>, in London during the first decade of the 20th century. The systems founded by Underwood, Fairbairn, and their contemporaries became the basis for most military and police close-combat training throughout the Western world during the 20th century.</p>
<p>E.W. Barton-Wright is also remembered as a pioneering promoter of <a href="../../../m/i/x/Mixed_martial_arts.html" title="Mixed martial arts">mixed martial arts</a> or MMA contests, in which experts in different fighting styles compete under common rules. Barton-Wright's champions, including Yukio Tani and Swiss <i><a href="../../../s/c/h/Schwingen.html" title="Schwingen">schwingen</a></i> wrestler Armand Cherpillod, enjoyed considerable success in these contests, which anticipated the MMA phenomenon of the 1990s by a hundred years.</p>
<p>The Bartitsu Club was the first school of its type in Europe to offer specialised classes in women's self defence, a practice taken up after the Club's demise by students of Yukio Tani and Sadekazu Uyenishi including Edith Garrud and Emily Watts. Mrs. Garrud established her own jiujitsu dojo (school) in London and also taught the art to members of the militant <a href="../../../s/u/f/Suffragette.html" title="Suffragette">Suffragette</a> movement, establishing an early association between self defence training and the political philosophy of <a href="../../../f/e/m/Feminism.html" title="Feminism">feminism</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/r/Bartitsu.html" title="Edit section: Contemporary interest in Bartitsu">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Contemporary interest in Bartitsu</span></h2>
<p>In 2001, the <i>Electronic Journals of Martial Arts and Sciences</i> (EJMAS) web site<a href="http://ejmas.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://ejmas.com" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> began to re-publish many of Barton-Wright's magazine articles that had been uncovered by Richard Bowen.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[11]</a></sup> Almost immediately, the "Self Defence with a Walking Stick" articles attracted a minor cult following and the illustrations were reproduced, often with humorous captions or other alterations, on a number of other sites.</p>
<p>In 2002, an international association of Bartitsu enthusiasts, known as the Bartitsu Society, was formed to research and then revive E.W. Barton-Wright's "New Art of Self Defence". The Society communicates via an email group established by author <a href="../../../w/i/l/Will_Thomas_1f2d.html" title="Will Thomas">Will Thomas</a> and individual members occasionally offer practical workshops in Bartitsu fighting techniques.</p>
<p>In August 2005, the Society published a book, <i>The Bartitsu Compendium</i>, which was edited by Tony Wolf.<sup id="_ref-wolf_6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-wolf" title="">[2]</a></sup> The <i>Compendium</i> details the complete history of the art as well as a technical curriculum for "canonical Bartitsu", the self-defense sequences that were promoted by Barton-Wright and his assistants between 1899-1902.</p>
<p>In September 2006, Bartitsu Society member Kirk Lawson released a DVD presentation entitled <i>Bartitsu - the Martial Art of Sherlock Holmes</i>, which is a presentation of Bartitsu techniques as demonstrated at the Spring '06 Cumann Bhata Western Martial Arts Seminar.</p>
<p>In October 2006, the Bartitsu Society launched the <a href="http://www.bartitsu.org/" class="external text" title="http://www.bartitsu.org/" rel="nofollow">Bartitsu.org</a> website, which includes information on the history, theory and practice of Barton-Wright's martial art.</p>
<p>Proceeds from the sales of the <i>Bartitsu Compendium</i> and the <i>Martial Art of Sherlock Holmes</i> DVD have been dedicated to creating a memorial for E.W. Barton-Wright.</p>
