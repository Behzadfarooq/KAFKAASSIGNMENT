<p>Are you a designer? We could use a Babel Barnstar for those jumping in to help translate pages; it should incorporate the Tower of Babel into the design. I have received speedy and gracious help in the past 48 hours, as my new international user pages at <b><a href="../../../../de/p/a/u/User%7EPaul_Klenk_243c.html" class="extiw" title="de:User:Paul_Klenk">de:wiki</a>, <a href="../../../../fr/p/a/u/User%7EPaul_Klenk_243c.html" class="extiw" title="fr:User:Paul_Klenk">fr:wiki</a>, <a href="../../../../nl/p/a/u/User%7EPaul_Klenk_243c.html" class="extiw" title="nl:User:Paul_Klenk">nl:wiki</a>, <a href="../../../../no/p/a/u/User%7EPaul_Klenk_243c.html" class="extiw" title="no:User:Paul_Klenk">no:wiki</a>, <a href="../../../../pt/p/a/u/User%7EPaul_Klenk_243c.html" class="extiw" title="pt:User:Paul_Klenk">pt:wiki</a>, <a href="../../../../it/p/a/u/User%7EPaul_Klenk_243c.html" class="extiw" title="it:User:Paul_Klenk">it:wiki</a>, <a href="../../../../fi/p/a/u/User%7EPaul_Klenk_243c.html" class="extiw" title="fi:User:Paul_Klenk">fi:wiki</a>, <a href="../../../../nn/p/a/u/User%7EPaul_Klenk_243c.html" class="extiw" title="nn:User:Paul_Klenk">nn:wiki</a>, <a href="../../../../da/p/a/u/User%7EPaul_Klenk_243c.html" class="extiw" title="da:User:Paul_Klenk">da:wiki</a></b>, have been translated by users at those sites. I was quite astonished. The German trans. was provided by a <i>brand new user</i>; his work on my page were his 2nd and 3rd edits. He didn't even have a page of his own yet! Needless to say, I have handed out many generic barnstars; the recipients have been deighted to find them on their pages.</p>
<p>When my pages at ja:wiki, zh:wiki, <s>sv:wiki</s> (done and awarded), pl:wiki, es:wiki and ru:wiki are translated, I would love to have a new Babel Barnstar ready for them.</p>
<p>I don't have good enough software to create a high quality image, but I will play around and <b>place an example here</b>. This award doesn't have to be a barnstar, of coure; I could simply adapt an existing Babel picture into an award. But a Babel Barnstar would be great.</p>

<dd>I like the idea for this Barnstar. The previous discussion yielded no results because people gradually lost interest and abandoned the discussion â which unfortunately happens quite often around here (I was myself away from this forum back when the original proposal was discussed, and so I never participated in it). I support this idea, and hope it will get through this time around. In fact, I could propose (or repropose) an image that was suggested in the original discussion, which I'm posting here now. Incidentally, I'll be leaving on a 20-day wikibreak and should be back on the 23rd or the 24th, so I probably won't be able to post here again (in fact, this one might very well be my last post before my break). I hope I'll see this award instated when I return. Cheers, <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedux_c670.html" title="User:Redux">Redux</a> 00:37, 3 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Oh, and suggestions for the name: <b>The Babelic Barnstar</b>, or <b>The Barnstar of WikiBabel</b>, or <b>The Babel Barnstar</b>, or even (and finally): <b>The Barnstar of Babel</b>. If I had to choose from these, I'd go with the first one (The Babelic Barnstar). <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedux_c670.html" title="User:Redux">Redux</a> 00:45, 3 October 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I personally like the Babelic Barnstar. <a href="../../../z/s/c/User%7EZscout370_3f46.html" title="User:Zscout370">Zach</a> <a href="../../../z/s/c/User_talk%7EZscout370_dbee.html" title="User talk:Zscout370">(Sound Off)</a> 00:46, 3 October 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I thought it had a nice ring to it. The other suggestions were just so there'd be more to choose from (we never know it someone else will be offering other possible names). What about the image? I know it sort of "favors" five countries, but still... If someone has the skills (and the patience), it could also be interesting to have a Barnstar inside a circle, which would be made of flags â and that would accommodate many more flags than this image does... <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedux_c670.html" title="User:Redux">Redux</a> 00:53, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>But the problem is that so many languages are not represented by a flag, so that might not be possible. <a href="../../../z/s/c/User%7EZscout370_3f46.html" title="User:Zscout370">Zach</a> <a href="../../../z/s/c/User_talk%7EZscout370_dbee.html" title="User talk:Zscout370">(Sound Off)</a> 01:04, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>That's true, but it might not be possible to come up with something absolutely universal, that will evoke all languages and no countries specifically. Let's see what other images will come up in this discussion, but if nothing better comes along, we just might have to settle for a representative amount of flags. If we were to abandon the whole flag notion, perhaps the Biblical tower itself might be a good idea, but I didn't think that Paul's first proposition would be ideal, mixing the Tower of Babel with a contemporary building â especially since, if we don't want to evoke any country (ies), it would be difficult to create composites with world famous skyscrapers, which are normally closely associated with their countries. Maybe we could have a Barnstar (or the Wikipedia logo, if this is not to be a Barnstar) hovering over the Tower of Babel, like some sort of guiding star? <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedux_c670.html" title="User:Redux">Redux</a> 02:17, 3 October 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Or just have a photo of the drawing of Babel and call it a Wikiaward. We do not have to stick a barnstar on everything. On a side note, it is very, very hard to create official Barnstars now. <a href="../../../z/s/c/User%7EZscout370_3f46.html" title="User:Zscout370">Zach</a> <a href="../../../z/s/c/User_talk%7EZscout370_dbee.html" title="User talk:Zscout370">(Sound Off)</a> 02:40, 3 October 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>That could be. Although if we were to just take a drawing of the Tower and call it our award, it might be too direct an association. I would <b>not</b> object it though. I believe it could work. If we throw out the flag thing, it does get difficult to work in a Barnstar in a convincing, interesting manner. It would be nice to get more input on this though, but this forum is just too unstable in terms of the people participating in discussions. On the other hand, it's actually somewhat positive that we might also be getting to a point where we don't need to create new Barnstars all the time. It wouldn't be useful to end up with tens of Barnstars that no one can keep track of â err, actually we are already there, so let's just say that it's best if doesn't get too much worse.<br />
In this case, though, if Paul agrees with the idea of just having the image of the Tower of Babel be the actual award, we might be able to wrap this at it, unless someone else (or Paul himself) comes up with a significant suggestion for a third way. If not, we could just call it <b>The Babelic Award</b>, or <b>The Babelic WikiAward</b>, or <b>The Award of Babel</b>, or even the simpler <b>The Babel Award</b>. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedux_c670.html" title="User:Redux">Redux</a> 03:22, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Two things:</p>
<p>1. Is there any particular reason why the award (whatever form it takes) <i>must</i> contain a reference to the word "Babel"? As a <a href="../../../t/o/w/Tower_of_Babel_05fa.html" title="Tower of Babel">Biblical</a> reference, this seems rather counterintuitive (given that God's act was the exact opposite of a translator's goal), and as a <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy_539c.html" title="The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy">Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</a></i> reference, it's awfully specific and somewhat arcane. I much prefer the previously proposed "<b>Interlingual Barnstar</b>."</p>
<p>2. Of the image candidates from the earlier discussion, this one (by <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESango123_0773.html" title="User:Sango123">Sango123</a>) is my favorite:</p>
<div class="floatright"><span><a href="../../../i/n/t/Image%7EInterlingual_Barnstar-small.png_10f6.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/4/41/Interlingual_Barnstar-small.png" alt="" width="111" height="125" longdesc="../../../i/n/t/Image%7EInterlingual_Barnstar-small.png_10f6.html" /></a></span></div>
<p>That's beautiful, and it conveys an inclusive, "worldwide" connotation. â<a href="../../../l/i/f/User%7ELifeisunfair_1bef.html" title="User:Lifeisunfair">Lifeisunfair</a> 04:08, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, at this point everything is up for discussion/consideration. The image looks good too. And there's no reason why it would "have to" be called "Babel something". But I thought that the word "Babel" was completely usable: 1) Because of <a href="../../../b/a/b/Wikipedia%7EBabel_d383.html" title="Wikipedia:Babel">Wikipedia:Babel</a>, which is a highly visible and successful project, and which uses the word and, AFAIK, no one has complained about it being too Biblical or anything (at least nothing that was serious enough to warrant a revision of the project's name; or am I wrong?). 2) And this is part of the reason why "Babel" can be used with ease, it's that, although originating in a Biblical story, "Babel" has grown passed the Biblical sense, it has become idiomatic (much like saying "good Samaritan", or "throwing the first rock"). Basically, I see no problems in using "Babel" on account of it being too Christian, or because of God's intent in the Biblical story. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedux_c670.html" title="User:Redux">Redux</a> 04:36, 3 October 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>As Paul notes below, the Biblical reference is from the <a href="../../../o/l/d/Old_Testament_79e6.html" title="Old Testament">Old Testament</a>, so it's associated with both <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judaism.html" title="Judaism">Judaism</a> and <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christianity.html" title="Christianity">Christianity</a>. (For the record, I'm Jewish.) I'm familiar with <a href="../../../b/a/b/Wikipedia%7EBabel_d383.html" title="Wikipedia:Babel">Wikipedia:Babel</a> (and I don't object to fact that the origin of its name is Biblical in nature, nor would I object to a Wikipedia project name that references a different religion's holy scripture), but its purpose (<i><b>dividing</b></i> people's user pages into various language categories) more logically (IMHO) relates to the word "Babel."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>As for "Babel" becoming idiomatic, I'll take your word for that. I haven't personally encountered its use beyond the Biblical connotation, the related <a href="../../../d/o/u/Douglas_Adams_4bdd.html" title="Douglas Adams">Douglas Adams</a> connotation (which actually fits the "translation" theme, but is not directly referenced) and the aforementioned (and equally related) Wikipedia connotation.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Though I hadn't thought about it, the fact that the Biblical reference is <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judeo-Christian_b255.html" title="Judeo-Christian">Judeo-Christian</a> in nature is a valid consideration for an award that's intended to extend to other languages' Wikipedias (some of which are used predominantly by people of other religions). I always welcome exposure to outside cultures, but I suppose that this <i>could</i> be perceived as an endorsement of one set of religions over all others. (I wouldn't view it in that context, but others might.)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>My primary concern, however, is that I don't perceive the "Babel" reference as evocative of the concept of "translation." The "multiple languages" element certainly is present, but I'm of the opinion that these awards should be assigned the most straightforward, descriptive, unambiguous names possible. (Even "<b>The Translator's Barnstar</b>" would be sensible.)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Of course, all of this is merely my 2Â¢. â<a href="../../../l/i/f/User%7ELifeisunfair_1bef.html" title="User:Lifeisunfair">Lifeisunfair</a> 12:00, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thank you all for rejoining this discussion. It is a pleasure to hear your ideas. My opinions:</p>
<ul>
<li><u>Keep the name simple</u>, like "Babel Barnstar". "Babelic Barnstar" sounds a bit precious or pretentious. "Barnstar of WikiBabel" is okay, only if the term "WikiBabel" (short for Wikipedia:Babel) is in widespread use here; if it isn't, let's not coin a neologism for an award. If WikiBabel is in use, let's put in a "wiki" colon: "Wiki<b>:</b>Babel".</li>
<li><u>Sango's globe image</u> is really beautiful, and my favorite. The "rotating globe" as a classroom tool also reflects the educational aspect of Wikipedia. And the "earth" connotes the idea in the Genesis text of dispersing people "over the whole earth" (see my aside, below).</li>
<li><u>Do not use flags</u>; they confuse countries with languages. Wikipedia does not have "country" sites, we have "language" sites, and we want to protect this idea. Even "made-up" flags or "international" flags confuse this issue. This is a language award.</li>
<li><u>Do not use the U.N. laurels</u>; it confuses our mission with theirs, and appears to pay homage to it, and it (again) appears on its flag. The U.N. is a council of representative <b>countries</b> (again, Babel is about languages, not countries). The U.N. is controversial, it is political, it is corrupt, it has strong loyalists and detractors. It is too much-loved and much-hated to appear in "official" WP anything. (Sorry, Redux, if my comments are not very diplomatic -- I actually think the image itself is quite beautiful and well executed, and am glad you shared it. &#160;:-))</li>
<li><u>A tongue</u> would also be a great icon for language, but I don't have the time or skill to create something, and I like the globe too much. I would love to see a Wikipedia with a sense of humor get creative with it.</li>
<li><u>"Babel" is okay; don't worry about its Biblical roots</u>.
<ul>
<li><small>An aside: Actually, Babel is not originally Christian, per se, but Jewish, as the account appeared in Genesis 11. Regarding God's intent as "opposite" of a translator: That's a very cool observation, Life, and I never thought of it that way. However, in the Biblical account, God's actual intent in confusing language was to <b>scatter everyone</b> so the entire globe would be populated. It was the mechanism to do this. God had actually commanded mankind to do scatter ("be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth"), but mankind disobeyed Him, and did the <b>opposite</b> -- he gathered together in one place ...("lest we be dispersed over the face of the whole earth..."), on the Babel plain where its eponymous tower was being built. By confusing the languages, God forced everyone to split up into little groups and scurry to find their own exclusive homelands ("...And from there the LORD dispersed them over the face of all the earth..."). Ironically, the desire to translate the Bible for world use has made Christians very large players in the historial practice of translating languages. So now the Babel account (as part of the Bible) is now the most translated text in human history. Biblical translators have not only broken much ground by creating many of the first and highest quality translations, they have also helped <b>create</b> many written languages for people groups who never before had a written language or alphabet. This was in response to another command, this one by Jesus Christ, given to his Jewish followers: "Go into all the world and preach the good news to all creation..."</small></li>

<dd>1. I strongly agree that the image should convey a "global" connotation, <i><b>not</b></i> an "international" one. What better likeness than that of a globe? And indeed, that's one of the nicest looking Barnstar images that I've seen.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>2. Note that I referred not to God's "intent," but to God's "act." Both, however, relate to the concept of separation, which directly opposes the objective of translation. It's true that the Bible has played a significant role in the translation and development of written languages, but the "Babel" reference is considerably more specific. â<a href="../../../l/i/f/User%7ELifeisunfair_1bef.html" title="User:Lifeisunfair">Lifeisunfair</a> 12:00, 3 October 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I'm almost leaving, but still have time for one last comment. So:<br />
1) The globe image looks great to me.<br />
2) Indeed, my reference to Babel as being Christian (excluding the Jewish origin) was more due to the fact that it was [very] late when I was writing that. Certainly, if the [perceived] religious connotation may become a problem, it's best to avoid it altogether. And indeed, it is a complicating factor that the purpose of the award is to recognize those who help people understand each other better, not divide and create confusion (as it happened in the Biblical Babel).<br />
<small>on a cultural note, it's a somewhat common expression, at least in my experience, to say, for instance, of a place where there's people from all kinds of backgrounds/walks of life: <cite>this is a Babel of XXX.</cite></small><br />
3)I don't quite have the time to do the research now, but if we want to find a name that escapes the obvious (as in The Translator Award/Barnstar), perhaps we could look for, say, a famous tool of translation, or maybe some individual who might have become famous for speaking an unsually large number of languages (I know of a Lebanese naturalized Brazilian guy who speaks 52 languages). Something along those lines...<br />

<dd>I appreciate the concern/wish to avoid use of the word Babel, but allow me to point out that 1] use of the word "Babel" is already fully established and widespread on Wikipedia, with respect to which language people speak, so it is apropos, and 2] it has fabulous euphonic appeal ("Babel Barnstar"). Having said that, of course I would not be offended if another word were used. <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_Klenk_243c.html" title="User:Paul Klenk">paul klenk</a> <a href="../../../p/a/u/User_talk%7EPaul_Klenk_4cff.html" title="User talk:Paul Klenk"><sup>talk</sup></a></dd>

<dd>As I mentioned, the current use of the word "Babel" on Wikipedia is fairly consistent with the Biblical connotation, because it refers to a means of <i>dividing</i> people's user pages by the languages that they read. The connection between the word "Babel" and multiple languages is obvious, but I don't believe that the concept of translation (or even enhanced communication) is conveyed. â<a href="../../../l/i/f/User%7ELifeisunfair_1bef.html" title="User:Lifeisunfair">Lifeisunfair</a> 23:45, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ally, we also have the Barnstar of National Merit, which the image for the award is also about the size of this, maybe longer.

<dd>For me, whenever I hear "Babel," I think more of the connotation of <i>many languages</i> than <i>Old Testament that was doomed by God</i>. So I don't have a problem with the use of that world. And Sango123's image is absolutely delicious, again.

<li>Since it's pretty much all about translation, I'd be in favor of calling it the "translation barnstar". - <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 22:31, 5 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I'm also strongly in favour of the Rosetta stone idea, but agree with <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllyUnion_7163.html" title="User:AllyUnion">AllyUnion</a> that at the moment it is a little large. However, since the original stone has broken edges, it would probably be OK if the embossed barnstar had some of its tips broken off too. The might make it easier to shrink the award down to standard barnstar size. -- <a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESolipsist_66d1.html" title="User:Solipsist">Solipsist</a> 15:04, 6 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I like the Rosetta image, but the name Barnstar of Babel flows off the tongue better (I agree that "Babelic" is pretentious).

<dd>This was a concern of mine when I created the image (which is why I initially used the 130x190 size). The 89x130 version looks fine on my screen (a 15" LCD at the relatively high 1400x1050 resolution â which means that it's smaller for me than it is for most people), but a compromise size (somewhere in between these two) certainly is an option. â<a href="../../../l/i/f/User%7ELifeisunfair_1bef.html" title="User:Lifeisunfair">Lifeisunfair</a> 16:51, 6 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Per the advice of Sango123 (who has contacted the participants in this discussion), I'd like to try to revive the proposal. Irrespective of which name or design is used, I feel that outstanding Wikipedia translators deserve a dedicated barnstar. I suggest that we conduct a straw poll to determine a consensus regarding the general concept, and <i>then</i> return to the specifics (and possibly conduct an additional vote) if sufficient backing exists. â<a href="../../../l/i/f/User%7ELifeisunfair_1bef.html" title="User:Lifeisunfair">Lifeisunfair</a> 15:49, 28 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Flags, UN flag these all are nice but this doesnt cover the languages. Non UN member states do exist, this doesnt mean people dont live there. Besides countries and flags have changed in the past, also some languages dont come with a flag. We do not have a roman empier, there exists a Latin language wikipedia. The globe is nice because in the future 5000 years the "look" of the planet should not change much unless a planetary catastrophy happens and even then the barnstar wouldn't matter...&#160;:P. The Earth should rotate in the background so every part of earth is visible (to evade conflicts and to satisfy my desire for animations). --<small><a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECool_Cat_eb3e.html" title="User:Cool Cat">Cool Cat</a><sup><a href="../../../c/o/o/User_talk%7ECool_Cat_0d3e.html" title="User talk:Cool Cat">Talk</a>|<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Cool_Cat_9377.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Cool Cat">@</a></sup></small> 10:09, 30 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Both the Interlingual Barnstar (I would call it "multilingual barnstar") and the Rosetta Barnstar have their place. The latter seems appropriate for direct translations -- a very different beast from original content creation in many languages. The former would be appopriate for broader multilingual and interlingual efforts. Can we add both of these? They are beautiful and appropriate. <a href="../../../s/j/_/User%7ESj_7824.html" title="User:Sj">+sj</a> <a href="../../../s/j/_/User_talk%7ESj_d037.html" title="User talk:Sj">+</a> 00:52, 2 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Was just going to say something to the extent, thanks! So hard for me to decide between the Rosetta and the Globe, I so like both. The Globe is such a beautiful piece of work already, and with added animation, mmmm! If we were to choose the Rosetta, could we keep the Globe for something else perhaps? (like, for successful mediation of nationalistically-based edit wars, or for successful ambassador activity, or for translations of formal content such like official policies or help, etc. ). I'd compliment, profusely, Paul Klenk's Babel Tower as well... but that one's been put to good use already&#160;:) so there should not be any concern about having that piece of work underappreciated. - <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EIntrovert_e3fe.html" title="User:Introvert"><font color="#004161">Introvert</font></a> <a href="../../../i/n/t/User_talk%7EIntrovert_66c0.html" title="User talk:Introvert"><font color="#004161"><sup>talk</sup></font></a> 01:08, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

It's beautiful, but I'd like to see it used as "the Geography Barnstar" (or something similar), spun off from the <a href="../../../b/a/r/Template%7EBarnstar_of_National_Merit_9024.html" title="Template:Barnstar of National Merit">Barnstar of National Merit</a> (which "may also be awarded to those who create a particularly fine article regarding geography," but doesn't appear to be used in this manner). â<a href="../../../l/i/f/User%7ELifeisunfair_1bef.html" title="User:Lifeisunfair">Lifeisunfair</a> 17:36, 29 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I totally agree with you, the geography one is beautiful, but should be used for that. I am thrilled with the Rosetta stone, it's perfect for the translation (Babel?) Barnstar.

<dd>If my reading is correct, the first is for translating an article from one language to another; the second is for starting an article in two or more different language Wikipedias. imo, second one could cause a lot of confusion and can be subsumed under the first. --<a href="../../../g/u/r/User%7EGurubrahma_62f8.html" title="User:Gurubrahma">Gurubrahma</a> 16:44, 3 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sj has suggested that we introduce two new barnstars â one for translation, and one for the creation of original content in multiple languages. I believe that the <b>Rosetta Barnstar</b> (image and name) could cover both, because the <a href="../../../r/o/s/Rosetta_Stone_d392.html" title="Rosetta Stone">Rosetta Stone</a> is a bilingual artifact that was used as a translation tool. â<a href="../../../l/i/f/User%7ELifeisunfair_1bef.html" title="User:Lifeisunfair">Lifeisunfair</a> 01:54, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Rosetta Barnstar</b>. My preference for the size is a little bigger than the small one, perhaps around 104x150px (this is halfway between the large and the small rosetta stars.).

<p>I propose my back scratching barnstar (viewable at <a href="../../../p/e/r/Wikipedia%7EPersonal_user_awards_2b20.html" title="Wikipedia:Personal user awards">Wikipedia:Personal_user_awards</a>, although someone with more photoshop skill is <i>very</i> welcome to make a better image), as a sort of community building barnstar, based on the phrase "I'll scratch your back if you'll scratch mine". It is intended that if a wikipedian has done something that you like, you leave this on their page to make a promise to scratch their back in the future. Additonally, it would be nice if its giving was reciprocated - after all, there's no rule saying you can't have five hundred barn stars, it just doesn't seem to be the convention yet.</p>

<dd>In my opinion, good wiki-deeds should be done for the sake of improving Wikipedia and/or being a nice person â not in repayment for the good wiki-deeds of others. Likewise, an award (such as a barnstar) should bestowed upon someone because he/she deserves it â not because he/she has given someone else an award.

<p>I'm thinking this award indeed has "other uses", but it seems to be most singularly related to the "B***S*** meaning in its current incarnation - I mean, give an award to get an award?

<p>I propose creating a barnstar for: "Users whose dedication and accomplishments show wisdom and maturity far beyond their years." Basically, I am looking to create a special award because I want to acknowledge the contributions of two 15 year old admins and a 13 year old bureaucrat, but I am sure there are other youthful contributors that have had a significant impact on the project as well. In my mind, I have an image of a barnstar (perhaps somewhat yellowed) rising in a arc with a comet like tail, but I haven't tried to create such an image yet. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> 18:56, 6 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I would like to see an award that recently elected admins can give out to people who have voted for them, or another idea, for the people who nominated them. It could have like a tick in the middle of a barn star, (not the insect tick, the drawn tick), like you have on election papers when voting. It would allow the new admin to give something back to the people &amp; make the voters want to vote again, thus making more people to begin to vote more often. This would make better represented voting selections. Although I have a clear image in mind, I doubt I could do anything on graphics etc. I hope this gets read &amp; someone decides to make it....

<dd>Someone has political issues..... However, I'd like Zach's thoughts on it... Also, I'm not paying to use a barnstar... I still think it's a good idea, for, as I said, Admins to give to the people who nominated them... It wouldn't take much time to make. Plus, if you don't want to remake a barnstar, then why are you creating the rosetta barnstar? Shouldn't you just keep the sociology barn star? <i><b>NO</b></i>. Exactly my point, we should try &amp; create a free barnstar which thanks nominators, even if we do have a similar one... <a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESpawn_Man_fbc1.html" title="User:Spawn Man">Spawn Man</a> 04:50, 11 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

I'm actually a bit short on ideas for the Barnstar's design, although my initial thought was to put Mario or some other famous gaming icon on top of the standard Barnstar, but of course that would probably be a copyvio. Then I tried putting Gamepad_Icon.png on top of Barnstar.png. Made in Appleworks 6, doesn't look good&#160;:/ So, I'm not quite sure what it would look like; maybe a picture of a game console cropped to be shaped like a star. Thoughts?

<li>Hello, all. Long time. I'm going to risk sounding a bit blunt on this one, but the of a "manstar" idea seems a bad one. The text of the star reads that it is supposed to be awarded for "EXCEPTION (sic) VIRILITY and EXTRAORDINARY MANLINESS", and its creator says that there is a "lack of real men on Wikipedia" with no indication of what that means in the context of Wikipedia. Is it for bravery and boldness? Those traits transcend gender. Is it for aggression? Sorry, that doesn't deserve a star. Really, it seems distasteful to associate any virtue(s) to one gender over another. I say we pass on this one. â <a href="../../../c/l/o/User%7EClockworkSoul_d5aa.html" title="User:ClockworkSoul">Clockwork<b>Soul</b></a> 05:06, 28 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

Or perhaps the star could be reserved for people who contribute great material to exceptionally manly articles, or help improve articles by making them much more virile, much like we have stars and medals for working on weird topics or foreign-country ones. -<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a> 05:47, 28 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Oppose</b> - I agree with ClockworkSoul. Sorry, but The Manstar seems to imply that only men possess courage, audacity, and vandal-hunting abilities, which is far from a realistic statement. This would destroy the sense of impartiality that Wikipedia strives for, where editors should not be categorized and thought of differently based on something as trivial as gender. And a creation of "<i>a counterpart barnstar, of course, for pretty, delicate ladies who are very dainty and who the manly men can help protect from vandals and trolls, and on occasion ravish passionately</i>" would only aggravate the situation. The <a href="../../../w/m/b/Image%7EWMBarnstar.png_9e38.html" title="Image:WMBarnstar.png">Working Man's Barnstar</a> already embodies the overall idea of this award, without as much of the gender stereotyping. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESango123_0773.html" title="User:Sango123"><font color="#00008B">Sango</font></a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="#008000">123</font></a> <a href="../../../s/a/n/User_talk%7ESango123_3e3e.html" title="User talk:Sango123"><font color="#00008B">(talk)</font></a> 14:47, 28 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>I propose a Maintenance and Collaboration Barnstar.

<p>I was thinking that there should be a barnstar for edits having to do with Wikipedia pages. The Wikipedia:_________ pages, like this one or Department of Fun or AFD or FAC or any of them. I would put my idea for the picture on it but I'm not good at making them. It would either have a normal barnstar with the backround has the logo or vice versa.

<p>This may not be in the spirit of wikipedia - i don't really know because i haven't been here very long - but it would be fun none-the-less (as long as people don't get offended).

Hmm. Not quite what I meant but I realize that (like the other barnstars, too) it would be hard to regulate when and how to use it...</p>
<p>Perhaps it could be used for a different purpose... I just kind of liked the name and image. Maybe it could be a warning to users or something when they don't follow the rules (like if they sabotage pages) or otherwise offend users</p>

<dd>The concept of barnstar is used to celebrate good work. Burnstar doesn't fit in and sounds like a poor joke on barnstar.
