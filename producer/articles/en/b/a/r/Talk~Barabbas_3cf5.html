<dd>See entry Bar Abba, in which the theory is presented that the name originally referred to Jesus himself, who was the prisoner whose freedom was demanded by the Jewish crowd before Pilate. A separate "Barabbas" was invented, according to this theory, as part of the tendency to shift the blame for the crucifixion away from the Romans and to the Jewish people.</dd>
</dl>
<p>I came upon an interesting theory, perhaps it could be mentioned in passing in this article ( I just don't see where ). There are many contradictions between Matthew's and Luke's stories about birth and childhood of Jesus. According to Matthew, Jesus, grandson of Jacob, was born during the time of Herod ( i.e. before 4 BC ), received gifts from the Magi, his family fled to Egypt to escape the <a href="../../../m/a/s/Massacre_of_the_Innocents_aac6.html" title="Massacre of the Innocents">Massacre of the Innocents</a>, and then a few years later moved to Nazareth. According to Luke, Jesus, grandson of Heli, was born during the Quirinius census ( 6 AD ), taken to Jerusalem and then returned home to Nazareth. There's no mention of the Magi, massacre or Egypt. The theory goes that these two passages refer to two different Jesuses, both sufficiently important to Jewish people at the time. Later these two got confused. One of them is Jesus Christ; the other - an insurrectioner who planned to overthrow the Roman government in Judea - is no other than Jesus Barabbas. Let me see if I can pull up some links. --8.4.80.163 01:40, 15 Apr 2005 (UTC) --<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_66.99.3.143_fb08.html" title="Special:Contributions/66.99.3.143">66.99.3.143</a></p>

<dd><i>However, no other such release is recorded, even as a passing mention, nor does such a Passover custom appear in the Old Testament. However, the Roman occupation of Jerusalem significantly postdates the majority of the Old Testament. Additionally, <a href="../../../p/o/n/Pontius_Pilate_f765.html" title="Pontius Pilate">Pontius Pilate</a>'s historic disregard for Jewish sensibilities and Jewish custom is well documented. From an imperial perspective, such a practice makes little sense; releasing a prisoner accused of murdering soldiers would certainly undercut morale. However, no account in the Gospels states that Barabbas murdered soldiers, and his release might be seen as a safety valve to prevent further riots.</i></dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li>I removed the reference to Barabas killing soldiers. As the text itself said, there is no account that this accusation was made against Barabas. So, why is the accusation mentioned here, if no one made it?</li>
<li>I added a possible explaination to why Pilate would want to release Jesus.</li>

<p>I have several suggestions to improve this section.</p>
<p>1. Hyam Maccoby's theory</p>
<dl>
<dd>a. The reference to Hyam Maccoby's theory should be attributed to him alone, unless other cites are found in which other scholars support him.</dd>
<dd>b. All elements of Maccoby's theory should be clearly labeled as Maccoby's ideas.

<p>2. Benjamin Urritia's Theory</p>
<dl>
<dd>a. Does Urritia explicitly cite Maccoby? If not, his theory should not invoke Maccoby.
<dl>

<p>3. The Crowd Calling for Jesus Theory</p>

<p>4. Jesus as Revolutionary Paragraph</p>
<dl>
<dd>a. This paragraph has nothing to do with Barabbas and Jesus being the same person. It should be eliminated or made relevant by moving it to another section and making an explicit comparison between Jesus' behavior and Barabbas'.
<dl>
<dd>The only concern I have on that paragraph is the use of "said by some analysts".

<dd>a. It is impossible to tell from this paragraph, as it is currently written, what Drew's theory was. Is he alleging that first-century Jerusalem saw an annual human sacrifice? This section should be substantially clarified.

<p>In regard to the anti-semitic effect, I refer you to <i>Jesus Framed</i> (1996) by George Aichele, (p.17-18 and p.23).

<dd>One possible explanation has been put forward to account for Pilate's otherwise inconsistent move. Historians note that, in approximately AD 36 (roughly the year estimated for Jesus' crucifixion), Pilate used arrests and executions to quash a Samaritan religious uprising. The ruthlessness with which he acted caused the Roman legate of Syria to complain about him, and Pilate to be recalled to Rome. It is possible that, after such disciplinary measures were taken against him, Pilate was reticent to execute people (especially someone with the popular following of Jesus, whose execution could spark further riots), and appealed to a popular vote to condemn Jesus in order to deflect any future blame from himself. It is worth noting that this would make Pilate's actions a singular event, and not a yearly tradition as the Bible states</dd>

<p>Pilate did not return to Judea after he was recalled to Rome in 36 CE, (and 36 CE is usually considered too late for the crucifixion also) --<a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimWae_0457.html" title="User:JimWae">JimWae</a> 10:07, 9 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<b>Bold text</b>==Jesus Barabbas?==</p>
<p>I'm looking at the OCT text of the gospels, and nowhere am I finding any name preceding Barabbas, or the grammatical form of Barabbas changing to indicate that its an epigraph and not someone's proper name. Why does the article state that the original Greek text has "Jesus" inserted as a part of Barabbas's name when I'm looking at it right now and it doesn't? <a href="../../../p/o/o/User%7EPookster11_83f2.html" title="User:Pookster11">pookster11</a> 06:29, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>i'm not sure what OCT means but you can read Jesus Barabba's name in the old versions of the gospels including those found at the Qumran caves or the dead sea scrolls.</p>

<p>The Pagan Romans did not care, but the Christian Romans certainly cared. As Christianity spread through the Roman empire, persecutions occurred from time to time. Seeking to prevent such persecutions, Christian writers bent over backwards to show that there was no real conflict between Christianity and Roman rule, and that Pilate only executed Jesus because of Priestly pressure, not because Jesus had ever acted against the interests of the Empire. These writers then had to explain why had the Jewish multitude demanded "Free Yeshua Bar Abba!" (Free Jesus, Son of the Father!). Then they were forced to invent a different, separate Yeshua Bar Abba, one who was not Jesus. For the same reason the Gospel authors and other Christian writers were careful to suppress all mention of the major nonviolent protest in <a href="../../../c/a/e/Caesarea.html" title="Caesarea">Caesarea</a>. - Das Baz, 03/28/2006, 1:13 PM.</p>
<p>And for the same reasons, "Jesus" was removed from "Jesus Barabbas" -but you will find it in the oldest texts and scholarly translations. DB, same day, 1:15 PM.</p>
<p><br />
And you base this on what? Rome is clearly depicted in a negative light in Revelation, and of the documents that survive from the Apostolic and early Patristic period none of them give any leeway to Rome or "bend over backwards" to the Imperial cult. Please, if you have any specific sources, share them, otherwise the gross and unfounded generalization isn't much help. Second, "Iesus ton Barabbon" appears nowhere in any of the earliest Greek sources of the Gospels; the only reason we know about it at all is from commentary by Origen based on the Syriac gospels that are after the Greek Gospels by at least two centuries. So, once again, what precisely are you talking about? <a href="../../../p/o/o/User%7EPookster11_83f2.html" title="User:Pookster11">pookster11</a> 09:35, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>It is not just Origen. Early Syriac manuscripts, the Caesarean Group of Texts, the Sinaitic Palimpsest, and the Palestinian Syriac lectionaries all agree that the reading is <i>Iesous ton Barabban</i>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Criterion of Embarrasment strongly supports the reading "Jesus Bar Abba." This is something that four families of manuscripts would have no reason at all to invent, but everybody else would have very good reasons to suppress and delete.</p>
<p>Revelation does not so "clearly" attack Rome. The name "Rome" is never mentioned - only allegories and code names.</p>
<p>Any serious New Testament scholar who can read the original Greek will tell you that the Apocalypse's author can not possibly be the author of any of the four Gospels.</p>
<p>Any serious New Testament scholar - <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Dominic_Crossan_a1cf.html" title="John Dominic Crossan">John Dominic Crossan</a>, <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paula_Fredriksen_aae0.html" title="Paula Fredriksen">Paula Fredriksen</a>, etc., will agree that the Gospel authors were very afraid to offend the Roman authorities, and tried very hard to shift the blame for the <a href="../../../c/r/u/Crucifixion.html" title="Crucifixion">Crucifixion</a> away from <a href="../../../p/i/l/Pilate.html" title="Pilate">Pilate</a> as much as possible. - Das Baz 03/30/2006, 10:55 AM</p>

<dd>The syriac gospels were specifically what I was mentioning, hence... well, why I mentioned them. Revelation was "taken" as an attack on Rome even during the post-Nicean era; there is no doubt the ancients clearly saw the "city/woman on seven hills" in Revelation as being Rome. As far as that goes, I AM a serious New Testament scholar and I CAN read the Greek and there are several reasons to link the Gospel of John and Revelation, though whether the letters from John are written by the same John is a diffrent matter. Frankly this idea that the Gospel writers would attempt to shift the blame of the crucifixion anywhere at all is nonsensical, and why it would appear in the Gospels, the foundational texts of the religion, and then disappear and no one afterwards feel it necessary to expand or reference this concept for at least 300 years is beyond me; in the early patristic and late apostolic writings there is no concern whatsoever about either ascribing or deflecting blame for thecrucifixion on anyone. I thank you for the scholars who hold this view however, and I will certainly look into it. <a href="../../../p/o/o/User%7EPookster11_83f2.html" title="User:Pookster11">pookster11</a> 03:42, 1 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>See specially <i>From Jesus to Christ</i> by Paula Fredriksen. See also <i>What Jesus Meant</i> by Garry Wills. Wills, an excellent scholar of New Testament Greek, points out that the Book of Revelation has the worst Greek in the NT. There is no way its author could be the same as the author of the Gospel of John. Besides its very unusual Greek, Revelation was unusual in attacking Rome, however veiled and encoded was the attack.</p>
<p>You forget that once the Gospels were accepted as Scriptures, their viewpoint was engraved on granite as far as the Christians were concerned. None of the writers who wrote after the canon was complete had any inclination to dispute what the Gospels claimed. It was no longer a matter of debate.</p>
<p>I hope you realize that your viewpoint is the unusual and exceptional one. Serious scholars in general hold it as common knowledge that the Gospel writers were trying to protect the Church by deflecting Crucifixion blame away from the Imperium and onto the Jews. Once this was done, there was nothing more to be said by the Christians, for whom the Gospels were literally Gospel Truth. Das Baz.04/04/2006, 10:53.</p>
<p>P.S. Is there any serious scholar besides yourself who agrees with your strange views? Please give us some examples. DB, 04/04/2006, 10:54 AM.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Not sure what specifically your short paragraph on the Gospels being "engraved in granite" has to go with te discussion; I apologize if I'm being dense, but I was referring to Christian works pre-Constantine and canonization. Both Revelation and John have a similiarly poor usage of Greek, and are structured along almost identical lines with identical use of symbolism and a strong tie to the "mystery religion" aspect of early Christianity; in style, structure, and language the two books are nearly identical in almost everything except their exact subject matter. Once again I'm not questioning you, but rather the scholars that hold these views that you are putting forth and would have to analyze the grounds that they are basing their arguments on, but to my knowledge the views on the Gospel of John and Revelation are generally that either a: they were both written by John, b: they were both written by the same person, but not John, or c: that they were written in tandem by two authors working closely together. As far as the Gospel writers trying to shield the church, this is quite unusual, and most of the research I have done points to an ambivalence on the part of both te early church and Rome; neither really cared what the other was doing. Revelation especially stands out as it was believed to have been written as a response directly to Nero's persecutions, but other than that the Gospels ar ambivalent towards Roman authority, as Roman authority in turn is generally ambivalent to Christianity, only realy paying any attention to the Christians at certain times and (especially in the case of Diocletian)for unknown and seemingly counter-productive reasons. Once again, the bottom line is that neither side really cared about what the othr was doing, and there really is no attempt by the Christians to try to placate or appear attractive to the Romans. For sources, look at Mellor, Helfgott, Price, Bengston, Aldo, Grant, Chambers, Bury, Mommsen, et al. Basically put, just about any book on Roman history or early Christian history will give ou this analysis. Really the only negative Roman view of Christianity we have comes from Tacitus, and thats only if you assume that by mentioning the "proselytizing Jews" Tacitus is in reality making reference to Pauline Christians, as generally speaking after the Diaspora Jews were not a proselytizing community and neither the Ebionites nor the Gnostics made all that great an effort to bring new followers in. Pliny mentions Christians in a negative light in a letter to Trajan, but the content is more "what do I do with these yokels?" rather than "how do we wipe out Christianity?" Once again, there's no reason to assume the Gospel writers tried to shield the early church from anything or in any way tried to paint Rome in a special light; the two groups just ignored each other. <a href="../../../p/o/o/User%7EPookster11_83f2.html" title="User:Pookster11">pookster11</a> 06:39, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The situation was different and special during the years of the Jewish War (66-73 AD/CE) and the years following after. During this period, Christians were fearful of being considered Jews and being treated accordingly. The Gospel authors, who probably worked during this period, tried very hard to prove they were not Jews and were not part of any revolutionary movement against Rome. Thus, they had to show that when a Jewish multitude demanded the freedom of Yeshua Bar Abba / Jesus Barabbas / Jesus Son of the Father / they were talking about another Jesus Barabbas, not Jesus of Nazareth. Wedges had to be driven between Jesus and his people. After a few decades, this was no longer an issue or a problem. During the Patristic age, the Gospels were accepted as unquestionable authority and their viewpoint the only one that counted among Christians. Das Baz April 6, 2006, 10:56 AM.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'm familiar with this analysis, and I will say that it is considered to have some validity within the historical community, but the main problem that most have with the theory is that there is little to base the analysis on, and most scholars will argue the same, that while the theory makes logical sense there is no evidence of it from the sources; thus we are left in our usual quandry in the ancient world where we all throw up our hands and all together say "we don't know" and then get research grants to go into the field and state "we don't know." The problem is that there doesn't seem to be evidence of a tremendous backlash against the Jewish community within Rome. The Jews had been powerful as populares and publicani since the time of Caesar, but once Augustus comes to power they, along with the other political factions, seem to simply drop off the political map, except for a mention during Caligula's reign and of course the Jewish revolts. While the theory makes complete and logical sense, the bottom line is we don't know, we don't have evidence for a backlash against Jews in Rome, and the assumption that Jews and Christians were lumped together comes from a few spotty sources, like Tacitus as I mentioned above, where we assume that certain aspects of the Jewish community that are described are actually aspects of the young Christian community. What we do see from the Christian and Roman sources that do directly address each other is, once again, ambivalence and neutrality. Strong ties still exist between the Christian and Jewish community, and it is debatable here at this point whether or not the Ebionites should even be considered a sepparate sect or are still part of the greater Judeo-Christian identity. So the question here is what sources do you trust? Do you trust sources that are vague and from which conclusions have been drawn based on complicated analysis? Or, do you trust sources that are explicit about who and what they are talking about? Do you assume that Christians attempted to placate Rome despite a lack of grounded evidence and based solely on logic? Or do you assume based on the available evidence that neither cared about the other? Do you believe sources in the original Greek, or sources a century later that had been translated into Syriac? <a href="../../../p/o/o/User%7EPookster11_83f2.html" title="User:Pookster11">pookster11</a> 05:34, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I quite agree that at this point in time the Ebionites were not a "sect" but indeed the mainstream Judeo-Christian community. The Jewish Revolt forced them to flee to Arabia (where eventually they were forced to convert to Islam, or be exterminated), to become a small persecuted sect (persecuted from both sides, Judaism and Christianity), to join either mainstream Judaism or Gentile Christianity, or to die out. Anyway, since <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus.html" title="Jesus">Jesus</a> and his apostles were native speakers of <a href="../../../a/r/a/Aramaic.html" title="Aramaic">Aramaic</a>, of which <a href="../../../s/y/r/Syriac.html" title="Syriac">Syriac</a> is a dialect, Syriac texts are far more likely to be authentic than Greek ones.</p>
<p>There is very good textual evidence that the Gospel writers were trying to whitewash and appease the Romans: The Gospels themselves. Note for example that the Gospel of "John" does not contain the word "Publican" (Tax Collector) even once, though this class of people is so prominent in the Synoptic Gospels. Why? Because "John" wanted to avoid saying anything negative about Roman rule. Notice that in John, Pilate says "you have a custom" of releasing a prisoner at Passover. He, the poor puppet, has no option but to go along with this custom imposed on him by the Jews. This is of course total nonsense. No Roman administrator was so subservient to the people he ruled.</p>
<p>John, a hardcore Gentile, is abysmally ignorant about Jewish culture. He has the proud Jews declare "Children of Abraham are we, and we were never slaves." (Capter 8). Real Jews remind themselves every year, at this time of year, "Slaves we were in Egypt." Das Baz 11 April 2006, 10:33 AM.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Its an interesting theory, but once again there's no evidence and in fact quite the contrary, evidence that the universal language amoung early Christians was koine Greek. Everything Christian we have of that time is Greek, even grafitti mocking Christians has them speaking in Greek words and letters. You have many interesting ideas that make 100% sense on their own, but you need to do some research and back these ideas up with what we know to be true. As for the Gospels themselves, Publican is a Latin word and would not appear in the Greek text, nor were publicani used extensively after Augustus, nor would they have appeared in Judea, a series of client-kingdoms under the Herodian dynasty. Further, a publican is not a general word for "tax collector", it refers specifically to citizens who have been drafted as tax-farmers, a practice that was abandoned under Augustus and Tiberius. While you present an interesting read of the Pilate incident, there is ample evidence to show that Pilate was, essentially, very subservient and compliant to the Jewish poulation of Judea. Around the same time of Christ there is a minor revolt that he manages to put down by acquiescing to the conspirators, he removes Roman standards from the Antonian fortress because of public complaint, etc. Realize that Pilate is conscious of the fact that he is in one of the most volatile areas of the Empire, and manages to succesfully and effectively rule the area throughout the reign of Tiberius until his removal just before Tiberius's death, and if you study Pilate's life he mainly does so through cooperating and compromising with the Jewish community. As far as John, there is a degree to which the particular verse you pick out has a number of textual debates, and its interesting that you should choose this verse as it was presented to me as an example of the koine concept of the perfect tense; what exactly is meant here by "douleo"? Does the perfect here imply that the speakers are referring solely to themselves, or all of the "sperma" of Abraham? If its all inclusive, why was the perfect used and not the aorist, which would make more grammatical sense? This is partially why John and Revelaion suck, and a lot of koine greek at this time sucks as well; the language itself is in a kind of transition that it won't really figure out until Constantine. But anyway, all of this seems like one big sidetrack; I have not yet seen any evidence that there was an attempt to whitewash of project a "happier relation" between the Christians and the Romans, though this has certainly been a fun conversation. I have never seen the relationship between Rome and the Christians painted as anything other than ambivalence; this of course does not make it true, but it does place a heavy burden of proof on those who wish to say otherwise. <a href="../../../p/o/o/User%7EPookster11_83f2.html" title="User:Pookster11">pookster11</a> 03:56, 12 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well, it seems to me that saying "Children of Abraham are we; we were never enslaved" implies that no children of Abraham were enslaved. And you you yourself tell us that the koine Greek used by most NT writers is very ungrammatical, so deriving conclusions from fine points of grammar is rather pointless in this case.</p>
<p>Yes, Pilate backed down in Caesarea on the matter of the Standards in Jerusalem, though only after he had threatened to massacre a multitude of thousands who had gathered to petition their removal. Apparently some first-century Rabbi who was very much into "turning the other cheek" (Nonviolent Resistance) had persuaded his fellow Israelis to offer their own lives without offering violence. Who could that leader be? Josephus does not say, but he does mention that Pilate later crucified Jesus - the only Rabbi executed by Pilate.</p>
<p>We learn about the incident from Josephus, but not a word of it in any of the Four Gospels, even though the incident took place at the beginning of Pontius Pilate's administration? Why such silence? You see, comparing Josephus and the Gospels is the best evidence that Rome is being whitewashed and appeased in the Gospels.</p>
<p>Pilate was better prepared the next time there was a popular manifestation against him. He had many of his agents disguised among the crowd, which they attacked physically at a point in time. He had changed, but only in becoming more clever and more ruthless, not more pliable.</p>
<p>During the lifetime of Jesus, Galilee was ruled by Herod Antipas, but the Romans did collect taxes on merchandise going in and out of Galilee. During the same time, Judea was under Roman Procurators. Matthew, Mark and Luke contain plenty of references to Publicans - but not a single one in John - even though John, in comparison to the Synoptics, spends more time in Jerusalem and less in Galilee. He should have more references to Publicans, not fewer. But John is not historical, but polemical. Ungrammatical, too, as you say. Garry Wills says the author of the Epistle to the Hebrews is the only NT writer who writes Good Greek. Das Baz, 13 April 2006, 10:33 AM.</p>
<dl>
<dd>As I said in that specific verse the difference is between the translation of the perfect and the aorist tense. In the perfect tense, the individuals are only referring to themselves, literaly "we have never been in a state of being slaves", referring specifically to the speakers themselves. Douleo appears in that verse in the perfect tense. Now, the problem is that in later texts the aorist drops off considerably and is replaced by the perfect; it may be that John is indicative of this change in the grammar of the language, and that this is simply the common usage, in which case your reading is correct. However, John has no problems in other areas as far as using the aorist and perfect tenses correctly, so is unlikely that John's usage of the perfect in this verse is suddenly indicative of a vulgar grammatical change when he has no problem elsewhere. As far as the story of the Syrian "rebels" I'm well aware of this story and frankly trying to tie this to Christ is a bit of a stretch. The "rebels" were not specifically lead by a rabbi, and the event seem unrelated and is never mentioned again by either the Romans identifying who Christ or Chrestus was nor by the Jews as a reference. The Josephus reference seems to stand on its own. Once again though, there are some that feel the incident is related to Christ's ministry, and I will leave it at that. As a nitpick, Judea at that time was under Praefects; Procurator did not become a title for an Imperial governor until the reign of Claudius, by which time Praefect had become a separate title with its own powers and position, hence there is clear corruption of the original texts in order to clarify what position Pilate held, as he is listed as the Procurator of Judea. As far as the references to Publicani in the other gospels, I'm not sure what you're referring to. Once again, Augustus had abolished tax-farming as part of his reform of the provincial system, and they formed part of the backbone of his support, as well as Caesar's before him. The provinces had suffered a kind of economic recession during the First Triumvirate and could not pay the amount they had bid. That and publicani would have nothing to do with collecting taxes on imports and exports. It may be that you're reading the Latin texts and seeing publicani there as a general reference for tax collectors; please know that, once again, publican and publicani are terms for a specific type of tax collector and not simply tax collectors in general; I would have to check, but it may be that Jerome simply translated the Greek term into an accessible and highly generalized Latin term that had long since lost its true meaning in Jerome's time. I would check myself but Perseus appears to be down right now, or at least running slow as hell. <a href="../../../p/o/o/User%7EPookster11_83f2.html" title="User:Pookster11">pookster11</a> 09:51, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>All these points are very interesting and worthy of study and thought, but these points also remain: Jews remind themselves every year "Slaves were we in Egypt," and no real Jews would ever say: "We are children of Abraham and we were never enslaved." The Synoptics contain several references to tax collectors and John not a single one. Josephus indeed does not say who was the leader of the great Jewish protest in Caesarea, and rather gives the impression that it was spontaneous and acephalous, but this is rather hard to believe. A brief mention of the <a href="../../../c/r/u/Crucifixion.html" title="Crucifixion">Crucifixion</a> of <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus.html" title="Jesus">Jesus</a> by Pilate follows, which may or may not be a useful hint.</p>
<p>Besides the tax collectors, John also omits the Baptism of Jesus, the Temptation, the Transfiguration, the Kiss of Judas, the Tears of Peter, the institution of the Eucharist, etc.</p>
<p>Roman historians are just as bad as the Gospel writers when it comes to confusing Procurators and Prefects. The archaeological evidence says that Pilate was a Prefect, but both Tacitus and the Gospels call him a Procurator, just to confuse us, perhaps. Das Baz, 18 April 2006, 10:51 AM.</p>

<dd>I completely agree with you on the point of slavery, but what I'm saying is that the sentence means something different in greek than it does prima facia in English. As for the omissions, I encourage you yourself to do a comparison of Revelation and the Gospel of John. Note what events John focuses the Gospel account on, and then parallel this with an examination of the structure of Revelation. This may help you as far as understanding why John includes certain events and omits certain events that the gospels leave out. As far as the references to tax-collectors, once again I'm not exactly sure what you're trying to argue. At face value it seems that you are arguing there is a problem in John simply because he does not mention tax-collectors, which is a bit of a ridiculous argument, as there are any number of things not mentioned that in no way impact the narrative or structure of John, so I'm sure thats not your point. Something to keep in mind additionally is that with the parallels with Revelation its entirely likely that the Gospel of John is in no way meant to be a complete re-elling of Christ's ministry and life, ala Matthew or especially Luke, but rather falls into a type of grey area between the Pauline Christians and Gnostics; while obstensibly Pauline in its message, both books are very "mystical" in their nature. The Procurator/Praefect thing is basically an issue of clarity; under Claudius the governors are titled Procurators, and the Praefect becomes a type of "pseudo-mayor" for the major cities within the empire. Pilate was a Praefect, however calling him Praefect would only confuse the heck out of a late 1st and early 2nd century audience. <a href="../../../p/o/o/User%7EPookster11_83f2.html" title="User:Pookster11">pookster11</a> 04:19, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The point is that the tax-collectors are very prominent in the Synoptics but omitted in John. Together with all the other strange omissions in John, this gives the definite impression that John omits important details because of his tendentiousness. Some of his omissions are rather mysterious. For example, John, as you say, has an "obstensibly Pauline message" - and yet, he is the only one of the 4 Gospels that has no mention of the eucharist - the blessing of the bread and wine - at the <a href="../../../l/a/s/Last_Supper_561f.html" title="Last Supper">Last Supper</a>. Why is this, do you think? Paul certainly taught that the Last Supper was the occasion of the first eucharist. - Das Baz, 21 April 2006, 10:27 AM.</p>

<dd>Hence the word "obstensibly" and why I described John before as being somewhat mystical. John seems to reach somewhat into the "mystery" aspects of the Christian religion that at that time were mainly suppoted by the Gnostics as an extension of Greek mystery religions. Many point to this as evidence that John is written by someone else outside of the Pauline community, is a Gentile, etc (I'm surprised you yourself haven't brough this up yet). There is a degree to which the similiarities with the mystery concept of Christianity are divergent in John though, and in many ways fundamentally disagree with Gnostic cryptotheology. In this respect its hard to say what precisely is going on, but because of the subject matter (and John's location at Ephesus) I tend to see John and Revelation as an attempt to incorporate aspect of cryptotheology into Pauline Christianity as well as a response to Gnostic cryptotheology, pulling it back into a Jewish rather than Greek perspective. The allusions in Revelation (symbology, etc) are all drawn exclusively from the OT, something very odd for a Gentile to do or a Gnostic (who largely ignored the OT writings). As far as his omissions, once again I would encourage you to study the parallels between John and Revelation, especially in structure (For example, seven seals, trumpets, bowls, etc in Revelation, and in John seven miracles, parables, etc). Rather than asking why certain things are omitted, ask why they would have been included in the first place? What would the narrator gain by their mention? And rather than assuming the writer doesn't know what he's doing (which is an idea that only seems to be prevalent here when questioning the Gospels...), ask if something is omitted why would he be expected to include such information and what relevance such information would have. LOL consider this a crash course in ancient historicity. <a href="../../../p/o/o/User%7EPookster11_83f2.html" title="User:Pookster11">pookster11</a> 21:58, 23 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I <i>did</i> bring up John being a Gentile. Pointed out that "Children of Abraham are we; we never were slaves" had to be a Gentile invention, since Jews remind themselves every year "Slaves we were in Egypt." When three of the four canonic Gospels have a lot to say about tax collectors, and about the eucharist, then it makes more sense to ask why the fourth Gospel omits any mention of either than why do the other three talk about an important fact of life in the first century Roman Empire and about the center Mystery of Christian worship. Yes, John is very much into Mystery - so why does he skip the eucharist? That is itself a mystery. Das Baz 26 April 2006, 10:04 AM.</p>

<p>According to <i>National Geographic</i>, May <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>: "As Christianity distanced itself from its origins as a Jewish sect, Christian thinkers found it increasingly convenient to blame the Jews as a people for the arrest and execution of Christ, and to cast Judas as the archetypal Jew."
