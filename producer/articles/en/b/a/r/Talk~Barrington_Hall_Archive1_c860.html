<p>M Dillion indicated that there's no soucre for the student death in my original edit. Most newspapers in the area seemed to have started archiving editions in 1995. I'll look into more research from my memory as a student (not in Barrington)- the student who died was named "Juan" and depending on who's telling the story he either fell, jumped, or was pushed off the roof the week after the "all-night riot" incident. I will look into sources.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>His name was Juan Mendoza from Taos, New Mexico. He was 19 or 20 years old and the fall/jump/push occurred sometimes in Spring, 1990. --<a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAstanhope_1188.html" title="User:Astanhope">AStanhope</a> 16:27, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>the cause of his fall was never definitively determined. the fact that it happened while hostile, armed security guards were patrolling the roof was considered very suspicious, because 1) he was not reported to be suicidal, but was happy at the time 2) his body was thought to be too far away from the building for an accidental fall, indicating instead that someone pushed him. there were no witnesses except guards, and they claimed never to have seen or heard him. their "saw nothing" claims were regarded suspiciously, however, since they spent all their time on the roof--they were stationed exclusively on the roof because barrington residents threw a washer and dryer off of it into beverly and sebastien's yard. (actually, someone threw a washing machine into her yard, and when she called to complain *then* they threw the dryer. guards were posted to make sure nothing else went off the roof, due to usca liability concerns. no one except them was permitted on the roof after that. that is even verifiable according to the original east bay express article, which is no longer available on-line but should perhaps be scanned.) to say that juan died in a fall from the roof which was never explained, while armed guards were patrolling it is NOT inaccurate or even biased, and newspaper accounts verify it. an outright accusation that they killed him is not verifiable, however. <a href="../../../c/i/n/User%7ECindery_01fc.html" title="User:Cindery">Cindery</a> 04:48, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I lived at Barrington from 1974-78, and was house president and Board rep. I'd really like to expand this article, since there is much more to the history, culture, and significance of Barrington Hall than the unfortunate events preceding its closing. I'm also going to see if the USCA will release some historical photographs into the public domain, GFDL, or CC free license. <a href="../../../m/c/b/User%7EMCB_427d.html" title="User:MCB">MCB</a> 17:58, 8 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>A very good initiative! I think that Barrington Hall in its many aspects was alwas something special and the time there was formative and singular for many. Two of us have visited <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andreas_Floer_9dc2.html" title="Andreas Floer">Andreas Floer</a> there in the eighties and have never seen anything like it again. <a href="../../../e/r/k/User%7EErkabo_847b.html" title="User:Erkabo">Erkabo</a> 19:27, 8 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I remember a long article in the Daily Cal (Berkeley campus newspaper). Wish I remembered the date!</p>
<p>(begin comment by Mr. Atoz) Barrington Hall was not =the= headquarters of the University of California at Berkeley anti-apartheid movement in the 1980s. I have no information about the 1970s. Several members of Barrington were very active in the Berkeley anti-apartheid movement from late 1984 to 1986. For example, Barrington members often brought large amounts of food to the student and community occupation of Sproul Plaza (then known at Biko Plaza by the anti-apartheid movement to honor the late South African student activist Steve Biko) MrAtoz 23:00, 9 November 2006 (UTC) Mr. Atoz</p>

<p>regarding acid rain/idiot flesh--not my original writing, and i would agree "fire on the mountain" not important enough/"memorable" too subjective. (also not my additon) but charming hostess, faun fables-- those are internationally recognized musical artists very much related to barrington (and they all have wiki pages already). reference to them in the musical history section should absolutely stay (and deletion without comment or research quite rude).</p>
<p>joshua clover appears to have been deleted with NO research regarding his notability, and should stay, as he is quite notable (and should have his own wiki page already).</p>
<p>same for micah garen. he was on every major tv news station during his captivity in iraq, and received a macdowell fellowship to write his book, which was published by simon and shuster.</p>
<p>re joanna--the line "internationally recognized sculpture conservator" was taken verbatim from her obituary in the dallas morning news.</p>
<p>joel rane might be iffy, but editing all of raymond pettibon's films is not completely UN-notable, as pettibon has a wiki page to link to, AND he did album covers for black flag, already mentioned in the article. i get the feeling danielcd has no clue about 80s punk culture, and is not a judge of what is relevant to that subtopic. (as a side note, there is a definite need for explansion of this article to include some of barrington's history that is not from the 80s, although that was the period about which most has been written in the news, etc. right now it's an article about "barrington in the 80s," not really barrington.)</p>
<p><br />
FURTHERMORE, the link of the picture of the front of the building was already in this article, but the link was broken. so i replaced it with an updated link. deleting that is not just rude, it's vandalism. <a href="../../../c/i/n/User%7ECindery_01fc.html" title="User:Cindery">Cindery</a> 05:00, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>"nasty" is a subjective and unfounded accusation--i could even say it's nasty of you to lob that accusation at me, man. if i had said, "looks like you made more than one mistake,&lt;expletive&gt;," that would have been nasty. meanwhile, i think your autocratic editing was more objectionable because you're not a newbie--or even a mere user--you're a wiki administrator. so in that august capacity, you're the last person who should go around deleting things from articles without discussion or research. it's reasonable to hold you to a higher standard. "whoops" is kinda lame, given that you already knew better.<a href="../../../c/i/n/User%7ECindery_01fc.html" title="User:Cindery">Cindery</a> 00:16, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>not sure where/if to put this. i think some mention of the slingshot would be ok--it's a well-known anarchist newspaper, it was started in barrington, and it still exists. (it evolved out of "the biko plaza news," during ant-apartheid protests. funnily enough, ex-barringtonian jeff kravitz, now a lawyer, who helped start both publications, is running for congress right now--california 5th district: sacramento. he has the green party's endorsement...and a website, where he lists involvement with slingshot/biko plaza news as accomplishments...) but anyway, maybe slingshot could be listed in "long tradition of social and political activism" etc?</p>
<p>i don't think ian was "famous" enough to be listed as notable--but his obituary in the slingshot gives interesting perspective/info on barrington. ("southside wingnut culture" and "unofficial Nudity Liberation Front.") maybe it could be listed in external references? like the allison roberts piece, it's a subjective account, but it was published:</p>

<p>Let us not forget the unforgetable moment when Johnny Puke (chimsack) had his head smashed in by the hollow body guitar being used by the player for the Misfits, after he had thrown a beer bottle at the afore mentioned. Johnny Puke was an unpredicable type- last time I saw him, after his car accident in the back of Lonnie Hunolt's truck (rick from Exodus's bro) which left him brain damaged, he was feeding LSD to pidgeons on the UC Berkeley campus. To many of us Bekeley Heathen Scum, this was THE moment to remeber, and a moment of turning in Barrington's history as Meth and rebellion capitol of the world (and it was- don't let anyone tell you otherwise.

<p>...some rewording seems ok. i mean, there <i>was</i> no official headquarters, anywhere. the "biko plaza news" was published in barrington, making it "headquarters-tastic"&#160;:-) maybe say, "center of activity, publisher of BPN..."? <a href="../../../c/i/n/User%7ECindery_01fc.html" title="User:Cindery">Cindery</a> 04:10, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>is not copyvio--the link is provided free on the barrington site (which is still busted at moment, i think). anyway, the film was made by mahlen morris and his brother, and they have always provided free access to it online. adam stanhope put it on youtube for easier access, because the site is down (but the link is still available through cache--it was you-tubed only because the cache was a long, clumsy link. <a href="../../../c/i/n/User%7ECindery_01fc.html" title="User:Cindery">Cindery</a> 04:14, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>So, this is in fact the 1% of links to YouTube that do NOT violate copyright. My brother, Clark Morris, and I made this film in 1988. Clark just redigitized to remove the audio. The credits on the wall at the end of the film were written on my bathroom wall. Is there any mechanism to assert our permission to link to this? Cause this situation is getting a bit silly.

<p>Hmmm. Does anyone here read the most popular blog online? BoingBoing has a post entitled <b>Fake "no-linking" copyright law breaks Wikipedia</b> (<a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2006/12/02/fake_nolinking_copyr.html" class="external text" title="http://www.boingboing.net/2006/12/02/fake_nolinking_copyr.html" rel="nofollow">Link</a>) by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cory_Doctorow" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cory_Doctorow" rel="nofollow">Cory Doctorow</a> which states: <i>Some Wikipedia editors have now taken the position that all links to YouTube clips and any other material whose copyright status can't be validated (that is, practically every single page on the Internet) should be ripped out of Wikipedia.</i> Since this imaginary rule against linking to alleged copyright violators is not on the books, either in the reality of international law or in Wiki policy, it is extremely impractical <b>(If you wish for perfect compliance, OK then, please remove the Google and Yahoo search bars from ever showing on Wiki, and ALL links that go to Google or support Google, since its search results could have copyright violating link suggestions therein! Spooky! Do you seriously want to validate every web page link on the Wiki project for copyright? What about if pushed one step further, and the pages your links link to are violating? And so on, leaving scrutinizing pages for infinity or the ends of the internet, whichever comes first!)</b> This <s>is going to</s> <b>is already giving negative PR to Wikipedia</b>, which I love and believe in as a great social and educational experiment that can teach us much about human nature. I have never edited very much or been vocal in discussions, but I feel I must stand up and say how absurd this restriction is. It is nothing less than asking for a complete restructuring of Wikipedia because of a flimsy, largely discredited argument about liability and the hand-wringing of overly cautious editors. Until serious debate is made with professional pro-Wiki copyright lawyers on the matter and Wiki policy clearly takes a position on this specific case, it should be left as-is. <b>Remember: "Be Bold".

<p>I agree with BoingBoing. To eliminate links to YouTube and other material with similar copyright status is more than lazy, it's irresponsible. Treating copyright like this would destroy real copyright and substitute a draconian system that favors big publishers.</p>
<p>Linking to copyrighted work is absolutely not a violation of copyright. No copyright holder could possibly get that to hold up in court. Fox threatening to sue is a deliberate attempt to intimidate responsible Internet providers, and by doing this they put themselves in the league of the current Administration equating criticism with aiding the enemy! Where have our principles gone off to? Are we all gonna roll over and play dead, in this, a so called free society? I should move to Russia! At least there, if you criticize the powers-that-be, they have the decency to try to murder you, rather than holding this vague, ominous threat of taking your money.Jmalin 17:52, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I agree that we don't play the "I am afraid to act" game. While I support copyright protection, we can't live in fear that the copyright status of a video or photograph has not been fully explored by another site's poster. If necessary we can use disclaimers when in doubt. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrankTownend_78da.html" title="User:FrankTownend">FrankTownend</a> 17:08, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I absolutely agree that we should not remove the links. Wikipedia's primary goal is allow the free exchange of information. We didn't back down to China's call to censor it, we post information while the media self-censors it, we are dedicated to addressing topics the mainstream media never would, and even unpopular viewpoints in the name of neutrality. Until linking to copyrighted material is made illegal, which it will never practically be because it would severely cripple the web, Wikipedia should post it. I will go as far to say Wikipedia has a mandate to post it. Companies will pick on the little guy but when someone like Wikipedia comes into play, these companies think twice about their sleazy tactics. Wikipedia needs to stick to its principles! <a href="../../../s/i/f/User%7ESifaka_87ba.html" title="User:Sifaka"><font color="green"><b>Sifaka</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../s/i/f/User_talk%7ESifaka_e89b.html" title="User talk:Sifaka"><b><font color="green">talk</font></b></a></sup> 21:48, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think the comments here may be talking at cross purposes. This discussion should not be about copyright law, but about Wikipedia policy. If a video on youtube is likely to breach copyright, at some point youtube will remove it, making a dead link on the page. Additionally, linking to copyright violations paints Wikipedia in a bad light. I'm not saying all youtube links should be removed, only those which are likely to cause the problems I outlined. --<a href="../../../h/2/g/User%7EH2g2bob_b842.html" title="User:H2g2bob">h2g2bob</a> 22:50, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Linking to ANYTHING may one day result in a dead link. Editors are constantly scouring the Wikipedia for these types of problems. Dead links are removed all of the time.

<dd>Further to my comments, (INAL but) it looks like this video is probably OK from a copyright point of view, so should be fine to include. I'd like to point out that lots of the links to youtube do link to copyrighted materials, and there are literally thousands of youtube links to check. It is hardly surprising if mistakes are made, so please <a href="../../../f/a/i/WP%7EFAITH_32f0.html" title="WP:FAITH">assume good faith</a> about edits.

<p>There is a clear distinction between linking to copyrighted material (which draws attention to that material and its author) and linking to material that is in violation of copyright (which draws attention to material outside of the context of its authorship). The Fox lawsuit is related to the first (linking to copyrighted material) and the YouTube issue is the second (linking to material in violation of copyright).</p>
<p>The web exists on the principal that anyone should be allowed, in good faith, to direct viewers to content made available for public display. Without this fundamental idea, linking as we know it would collapse. A link to a YouTube video should not be treated differently than any other web video within Wikipedia policy, because all web video is governed by the same interplay of disparate copyright laws and governing organizations. YouTube is the same as all other hosting services in that it provides tools that are absolutely necessary for a set of legitimate content delivery services, and it is the burden of the person that uses those tools to observe copyright law when using them, just as a printer must not break copyright law with her press. YouTube clearly states in its <a href="http://www.youtube.com/t/terms" class="external text" title="http://www.youtube.com/t/terms" rel="nofollow">Terms of Service</a>(part 5C) that users may not utilize YouTube to display copyrighted material. Furthermore, YouTube has a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/t/dmca_policy" class="external text" title="http://www.youtube.com/t/dmca_policy" rel="nofollow">method for reporting copyright infringements</a>. As such, YouTube has a written policy of observing copyrights, should authors choose to invoke them.</p>
<p>Any assumption by Wikipedia that all YouTube content may be in infringement of copyright would observe the rights of video authors without observing the authors' privilege not to exercise them.</p>
<p>By the same token, any content posted on Wikipedia should meet the <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia verifiability standards</a>. If a statement about a specific piece of web video content, on YouTube or otherwise, can meet those verifiability standards, it should be acceptable. If the video itself is presented <i>as encyclopedic content,</i> it should also meet those verifiability standards. It's my guess that most articles fall in one of three categories when dealing with video:</p>
<ol>
<li>There is a link to a video as a related resource, with no claims made about the video</li>
<li>There are claims about the video, but the video is not presented as encyclopedic content, in which case the claims should be verified</li>
<li>The video itself is presented as encyclopedic content, in which case the video content, claims about it, and the video's copyright standing should be verifiable</li>
</ol>
<p><br />
As a side note, Wikipedia policy should not be based on the expected availability of a link target because to do so would require two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>reciprocal communication between the linker and the linkee, which is not guaranteed by the standards(w3c) that define links</li>
<li>that the original author of the content have an expectation of the lifetime of her content, which is not guaranteed by the methods that are used to generate content</li>
</ul>

<p>Ever heard of innocent until proven guilty. Even if 99% of YouTube material is against copyright, linking to it is not an offense (unless maybe if you know it is against copyright), and the video you may be linking to might not be against copyright. The argument you have used is the same as that used by those pro-discrimination. I think you need to look back, and consider exactly what it is that you are including in Wikipedia, ie a link, not the copyrighted material itself. <a href="../../../i/a/n/User%7EIan13_865f.html" title="User:Ian13"><span style="color:#067"><u>Ian</u>¹³</span></a><a href="../../../i/a/n/User_talk%7EIan13_e2ae.html" title="User talk:Ian13"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">/t</span></a> 18:23, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<td valign="top" style="padding:4px 10px;">OVERVIEW: Plaintiffs moved for preliminary injunction. Plaintiff claimed that unless a preliminary injunction issued, defendants would directly infringe and contribute to the infringement of its copyright. Plaintiff owned a valid copyright on the material defendants posted on their website. Plaintiff, at trial, was likely to establish that those who have posted the material on three websites were directly infringing plaintiff's copyright. Those who browse any of three infringing websites were infringing plaintiff's copyright by making a copy of the material. Defendants actively encouraged the infringement of plaintiff's copyright. Plaintiff had demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits and there was a presumption of injury. In addition, plaintiff would suffer <b>immediate and real irreparable harm if defendants were permitted to post the copyrighted material or to knowingly induce, cause or materially contribute to the infringement of plaintiff's copyright by others.</b> On that basis, the court granted plaintiff's motion for preliminary injunction.</td>

<dd>Your claim that Wikipedia falls under US fair use doctrine for "just about everything" is patently untrue.

<p>Come on folks, this is really nothing new. If the content on Youtube was released there by its copyright holders we should, generally, delink it because of our long standing practice to avoid being a link gallery and to encourage people to upload free content here. If the content was submitted to youtube without the authorization of its copyright holders, then it's a violation.. and we have had a long standing practice of removing links to copyright violations. The Wikimedia foundation has a mission of increasing the amount of freely available content in the world, and on Wikipedia we've found that linking material creates a general discouragement against the creation of new completely-free material. Obviously, we should link sources.. but youtube is not a good source and I don't see anyone arguing that it is a good source. --<a href="../../../g/m/a/User%7EGmaxwell_5150.html" title="User:Gmaxwell">Gmaxwell</a> 15:18, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It can... sometimes... be a good source. Not most of the time, but sometimes. (For example, a notable political commercial and the counter commercial were both uploaded to YouTube by thier respective campaigns. Since it's official, copyright and reliability concerns are satisfied.)</dd>
<dd>Alot of people have missunderstood the mission with what we are doing here. The goal isn't to remove all YT links.

It was uploaded by the creator(s) with as much proof as we require for uploading self-made media.

<dd>Nick, I'd be interested to know about the legal consequences of linking to something where there's no particular reason to believe that it's a copyvio, but it turns out afterwards to be one. I know there are problems with <b>knowingly</b> contributing to infringement, but no one is suggesting we do that. No one has expressed the slightest belief that this Barrington video is a copyvio, but only that we maybe don't have solid proof that it isn't one. Where is the knowing infringement, or else where are the legal consequences for inadvertent infringent? Where does it say it's our job to gather documentation (maybe even backed up by DNA evidence, everyone knows that written documents can be forged) for every URL on the web before we can link to it? If you're saying we face legal consequences for inadvertent infringement, I'd particularly like to know how the DMCA's safe harbor provision figures into them assuming we're willing to remove disputed materials on receiving a takedown notice. If you're not saying there's such consequences, then what's the problem here? Thanks. <a href="../../../6/7/2E/User%7E67.117.130.181.html" title="User:67.117.130.181">67.117.130.181</a> 12:24, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Its the other way around. Without any information we have to assume that the subject is copyrighted. That is why we do not upload images from websites not mentioning their licensing information. We need them to be explicitly free-licensed, creative-commons licensed, link them to the website of the original copyright holder or uploaded on Wikimedia Commons by the original copyright holder (once we have that provision). Any default on the policies and the copyright laws would then be treated like we treat other kinds of plagiarism.

<li>Nick - you are continually attempting to blur the distinction between the standards which apply to content hosted by Wikimedia and content <b>linked to</b> by Wikimedia. There are different standards. It is not reasonable to assume that content which lacks a copyright notice and which was made before the Berne Convention took effect in the U.S. is actually copyright. It is not reasonable to assume that content made by a (at the time) amateur video producer which has been uploaded to YouTube is in violation of the producer's copyright. Especially when it's been asserted above that the film does not violate copyright. <b><a href="../../../a/r/g/User%7EArgyriou_d8d1.html" title="User:Argyriou">Argyriou</a></b> <small><a href="../../../a/r/g/User_talk%7EArgyriou_e022.html" title="User talk:Argyriou">(talk)</a></small> 18:30, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I think the best way out of this mess would be for the owner of the film to upload the file to wikimedia commons and release it under creative commons or similar - then we can link to it internally.

<p>This is getting really silly.</p>
<p>The link to the video on YouTube will stay.</p>
<p>There are two main aspects of this discussion. One is linking to YouTube videos in general. That appears to be a fight for another day. The other aspect is linking to this video specifically. I wish to address that.</p>
<p>Both User:Cindery and I know Mahlen and his brother personally. We all lived together, in fact, at Barrington Hall in Berkeley, California - the subject of this article. Mahlen and his brother are aware of the desire here to link to the video. There was a question about the Matrix soundtrack - that question has been answered by Mahlen and his brother rebuilding the video sans music. There is, therefore, no copyright issue with this work.</p>
<p>The Wikipedia depends on experts on an article's topic to decide what information is relevant and not in a given article. Both Cindery and I are, by virture of our personal histories at Barrington Hall, "experts" on the topic. The video exists. It is an essential piece of the history of Barrington Hall. A link to the video belongs in this article.</p>
<p>I'd like to suggest that people who are super-paranoid about violating copyright laws focus their time and energy on articles that link to YouTube where the article's editors simply don't care. Cindery and I "care" and I'm not going to allow anyone to interfere with this aspect of the article because they have wrong and unhelpful understanding of copyright law and how it works in the real world. --<a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAstanhope_1188.html" title="User:Astanhope">AStanhope</a> 21:05, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>okay, from what i can discern from a quick read, the issue now is 1) mahlen and clark never applied for/wanted copyright 2) therefore they cannot prove they are the copyright holders? that puts them in the absurd condition of being forced to disprove a negative. in honor of the holidays, i will give anyone a million dollars if--after providing tangible proof that jesus is *not* the son of the <a href="../../../f/l/y/Flying_spaghetti_monster.html" title="Flying spaghetti monster">flying spaghetti monster</a>--they can then also provide tangible proof that mahlen could not be the copyright holder.</p>
<p>confidential to adam: are undergraduates dimmer now, or has the "war on terror"/the popularity of CSI turned everyone into a "shithouse lawyer"/wannabe facsist:-)? but seriously, for those of you who are "in law school," perhaps you should read up on the first amendment. and libel--the accusation that mahlen has made a false claim in writing to hold the rights to the video is tantamount to accusing him of lying, and he has every right to interpret that as defamatory. there is no "reasonable doubt" about this, (i.e., no one else has claimed copyright, there is no reason to believe mahlen is not mahlen or not the rights holder) and the only circumstance in law in which something must be proved <i>beyond</i> a reasonable doubt is criminal court. what do we have here? a hypothetical civil case, in which the preponderance of the evidence--the standard of evidence for a civil case-- indicates that the video is owned by mahlen and clark, who have specifically indicated their permission for its inclusion on wikipedia. mahlen's a pretty mellow guy, though... and a grown-up. i imagine he will laugh at undergraduate-Fed attempts to libel him. (but i dunno who has seen barrington's friendster profile--remember the "mostly, i'm a lawyer. i have thousand law degrees or somthing, i forget"? this is definitely the *wrong* article to try to pick a fight about *anything* without good cause, but especially not something petty. it's probably worse than abortion or israel or george w. bush, because of the high number of lawyers crossed with, er, "onngh yannghism", which could perhaps result in sheer delight in the absurd...we did not unanimously elect &lt;redacted&gt; to represent us in the USCA for every semester he ran for nothing...anyhow, as part of the grown-up vote, which also happens to include--AHEM--all the regular editors of this article, i insist that the video is not only an invaluable enrichment to the article, but the single most valuable resource in the article, and should absolutely stay, for the benefit of <i>Wikipedia readers</i>--the <i>forgotten population</i> in most <i>stupid arguments over nothing.</i> Mahlen need do nothing more, and has every right to be free from libel and harassment. in my opinion, anyone who disagrees has "talents" which could best benefit Wikipedia elsewhere--fixing typos, posting vandal warnings directed at highschool students who have inserted the word "COCK!" randomly in articles, etc. otherwise, it <i>may</i> be time to ask ourselves, "what would Berkeley Bob do in this situation?" (he was the former head of both the CIA *and* the KGB, so, as i'm sure you can imagine, this could involve a lot of yelling and confusion, insults-that-go-over-your-head of a highly poetic-judicial nature, a sort of mayakovksy-on-LSD-in-1984 affair...:-) <a href="../../../c/i/n/User%7ECindery_01fc.html" title="User:Cindery">Cindery</a> 23:29, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>So far, the problem - at least that part of the problem where the deletionists have a case - is that (until recently) the file was hosted on AStanhope's YouTube account, and he's not the copyright holder, and that there is no statement saying that whoever is hosting it right now (Mahlen, I believe) says they do have the copyright. Copyright doesn't take much to assert - no big forms and no fees, anymore. So if the deletionists are reasonable people (I have my doubts about some of them), just saying, on YouTube, "I am the creator and copyright holder to this video" should be enough to put an end to this nonsense. <b><a href="../../../a/r/g/User%7EArgyriou_d8d1.html" title="User:Argyriou">Argyriou</a></b> <small><a href="../../../a/r/g/User_talk%7EArgyriou_e022.html" title="User talk:Argyriou">(talk)</a></small> 23:50, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>It's not so much the attribution, but the assertion that you have permission. If you, for example, posted to a YouTube video taken from some local newscast, saying that the video was from Channel 5 isn't enough - the uploader on YouTube would have to say that he had permission from Channel 5 to upload it. Technically, right now, Mahlen doesn't say that the video is his, so someone who doesn't know Mahlen might assume that he uploaded it without permission. If Mahlen says, <b>on YouTube</b>, that he owns the rights to the video, or that he has permission from the copyright holder, or that the copyright holder has released the video into the public domain, then there's a presumption that the material is not in violation of copyright. Mahlen could also go through the process of releasing the video under the GFDL or a CC license, but that's not really necessary. <b><a href="../../../a/r/g/User%7EArgyriou_d8d1.html" title="User:Argyriou">Argyriou</a></b> <small><a href="../../../a/r/g/User_talk%7EArgyriou_e022.html" title="User talk:Argyriou">(talk)</a></small> 00:53, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>meanwhile, for those of you who who don't read the admin page, here's the most up-to-date current "consensus" (derisive snort) sir mimsy-whomever referred to in his edit summary ("current consensus at WP:ANI"): <a href="../../../c/i/n/User%7ECindery_01fc.html" title="User:Cindery">Cindery</a> 01:23, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I believe you are being willfully obtuse if you believe that "(t)here is no project to remove YouTube links blindly." Editors like Sir Nicholas and others are taking the information you've posted, and removing every link to a YouTube page without checking either the talk pages of the affected articles or the videos being removed.</p>
<p><br />
People like User:J.smith and User:Tom harrison are correct when they say that most YouTube links should be removed. But most is not all, and your project is encouraging people to remove all YouTube links, without any checking. Tom Harrison suggests that each YouTube link requires individual justification, but how is someone running AWB with the regexes you supply supposed to know that there's a talk page with 30k of discussion on why that particular YouTube link has been repeatedly justified?</p>
<p><br />
Ok - I've just answered my own question. Will you, and the people who are part of your YouTube deletion project, honor notices like the one I've placed on Barrington Hall? I've placed it in a way that it's nearly impossible for an editor to miss. Note that I don't agree with Tom Harrison - I think the burden of checking should be on the deleter - but if people in the YouTube Deletion Project are willing to actually stop and notice that there is a history or justification behind a particular YouTube link, I'm willing to accept that it's up to the person linking to YouTube to justify and restore (once!) the link. Argyriou (talk) 22:04, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>No, don't expect anyone to heed you once I've given you a warning for incivility and your response is to repeat the very same incivility, and then even come here to point it out. Vandalism is a bad-faith attempt to harm the encyclopedia, not a disagreement over links. Stop it. Dmcdevit•t 04:52, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><br />
...you are way out of line talking to Argyriou that way. First of all, his vandal warning was clearly given in good faith. Bringing the issue here is precisely what he should have done, and also done in good faith, not "pointing out incivility." Moreover, you are not The Arbiter of civility (and I have personally noticed Argyriou to be more civil than I have noticed you to be). Last but not least, it is a gross failure to AGF to decide that you will ignore a reasonable request/refuse to engage in reasonable discussion "as an authority" because of something you have decided someone did in a previous conversation (i.e., if Argyriou had been blocked and returned, that would not be sufficient reason to render any reasonable edit he made "ignorable," now or in the future, as you are well aware.) The fact that the whole YT issue is something in which you are very subjectively over-enagaged makes this much worse, in my opinion. This is the second time I have observed you to be rude and threatening to someone over YT, and I believe that you may be so ill-equipped to objectively assess any situations in which YT is involved that you should recuse yourself from acting as anadmin with regards to YT disagreements. I may file a report. Cindery 01:14, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Well, upon reviewing things which occurred during my wikibreak, it seems first of all that sticking up for NE2 is necessary. Pls see his/her talkpage. that really disgusts me--the discouragement of a neutral party from giving an opinion, by an admin who conceals heavy subjective investment. It also appears that--as NE2 points out--there was no discusssion by mimsy whomever and devit in the so-called "edit war"--it doesn't look like there was an edit war at all, or that there is anything to discuss. There was just a petty boring petty opportunistic "silent coup." There is--and has been since it was included--consensus that the link should be here. It would appear that the people who deleted it this time are people who 1)have never at any time been editors of this article or contributed to it in any way 2) are in the micro-committee which deleted the video in the first place on kneejerk source bias. They have declined to offer any reasoning or discussion for their actions, so unfortunately we can only speculate about why they did this. It seems that their likely motive is probably petty malice???? --they looked like jackasses/soundly LOST all the arguments on all policy pages regarding YT source bias, which were largely started by me after they attacked the link on this page&#160;??? Bearing some grudge, and noticing that I was on wikibreak, they returned to delete the YT link here??? If so, nobody likes a sore loser, guys!--go find those typos and "COCKS!" if you're looking for consolation prizes&#160;:-)</p>
<p>I suppose we should just request unprotection on the grounds that we have consensus/page should never have been protected in the first place. (And I would back up an RFC on Dmcevit for his actions here, and towards NE2 and Argyiou, to prevent further shenanigans from the YT Crew/out of a general sense of justice about how Dmcdevit has treated people. Though it seems like a bummer thing to have to do. Kids!--I can't tell you how sad it makes me that you are not out partying and trying to spring Gitmo prisoners at the same time!

<p>...mimsy-whomever was clearly editing in bad faith in late Dec by deleting the link without discussion, as he was politely informed in <i>early Nov</i> that the link was not a copyvio, and that he should not even be attempting to delete it without discussion (see below). He is also an official member of the "You Tube Deletion Committee" started by Dmcdevit--i.e., has an admitted bias/ego investment in something other than editing this article. From his current talkpage, you can easily observe that "Nearly Headless Nick" is a close ally, and not constructively for the benefit of Wikipedia, from what I have seen--NHN has recently made the bizarrely ludicrous accusation on mumsy's talkpage--to Arygiou--that stating any alternate opinions about YT links is "disruptive." He clearly has ZERO idea what "disruptive" means, as on-topic good faith editorial opinions on talkpages are never disruptive--or perhaps he <i>does</i> know and is trying to bully??? NHN, on the other hand, is in fact participating in a project which is disrupting Wikipedia to make a point; has certainly had a decidedly and idiotically disruptive effect on this article, in my experienced judgement. My feeling is that they can get lost and stay lost, or we can take it to a higher level. They are not editors of this article, they have categorically refused to engage in discussion on the talkpage of this article while making edits they know are disputed, and they do NOT have consensus on policy pages--consensus is against them. What they lack in consensus they have tried to compensate for with bullying (which disgusts me).</p>

<li>Has anyone ever considered that AGF is a two-way street? It is absolutely correct to insist that we do not link to rich media which violates copyright (contributory infringement, as it's known, which has been identified as a legal and ethical problem for the project regardless of what anybody here might assert), and the entire dispute could have been settled right at the outset by calmly stating the evidence that the work is (unlike very many YouTubes) not a copyright infringement. Instead I see a lot of arm-waving and hysterical assertions of "copyright terrorism" which really does <i>not</i> help. So: after the holidays, how about everybody takes a dose of calm and move on? <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 10:52, 25 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

And we don't even know that Jane is aware of the other blog, after all it just was created what, yesterday?

<dd>I absolutely am addressing those points, I'm not sure if you're unable to understand them or are intentionally ignoring them. 1) I agree this is absolutely true - and this is exactly why WP recommends <b>not</b> using blogs as sources, except in exceptional circumstances (such as when a blog is hosted on or linked from an official website, which does verify the authorship of the blog). And 2) There is NO reason to believe it is really his/her blog since anyone could create a blog and put the name of someone notable on it. With potential RS, the burden of proof is on the source (as RS says, have you read it?) - if we have no way of knowing if it's legit, it's not a reliable source. --<a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMilo_H_Minderbinder_261f.html" title="User:Milo H Minderbinder">Milo H Minderbinder</a> 21:50, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

To just go at face value and say 'yes this is the site of X because it says it is' is naive and against our verifiability policy. Note that blogs in general are discouraged from being used as sources - unless they have a very good reason to be linked, and in the case of being a self published blog,100% guarenteed that they are the work of that person.

<dd>Authorship <i>is</i> covered by RS. As one example: "Attributability—The more we know about the originator, either organisation or individual, of source material, the better. This helps us measure the authority of the content." At this point, we don't know if the authors really wrote those blogs, so we know zero about the originator of the source material. Also: "Posts to bulletin boards, Usenet, and wikis, or messages left on blogs, should not be used as sources. This is in part because <b>we have no way of knowing who has written or posted them</b>, and in part because there is no editorial oversight or third-party fact-checking.

<li>1) COI does not apply. Jane Dark is an "expert": note that among J.Smith's original objections to Jane Dark was that Jane was <i>not</i> an expert on "70s/80s Berkeley graffiti." Any source who verified the graffiti would have to have personally seen it, photographs of it, or interviewed someone who had seen it. If they personally saw it, they are an "expert." COI, moreover, refers to commercial interest in a subject. As the subject was a nonprofit housing cooperative which is now defunct, there is no possible commercial interest.</li>

<dd>1) If you are giving info to a website for publication, and then using that published info as a source, you're basically citing yourself, which is a clear COI. Assuming the new blog is legit, is it a coincidence that it was published now, or did you contact him and ask him to publish it? COI has nothing to do with whether a person is an expert or not, it's simply about whether the info/link is being added to WP by the same person who created the source. 2) I agree with both of these.

<dd>(edit conflict) The line between "original research" and "research" is publication. "Orginal research" does not equal "unverifiable."

<dd>It's difficult to think of a better example of why blogs are generally considered unreliable sources. First, an uncited edit is made and citations are requested; subsequently a couple of blog postings pop up which list nearly or exactly the information in question? The ex post facto appearance of the "sources", regardless of whether the posts were solicited by <a href="../../../c/i/n/User%7ECindery_01fc.html" title="User:Cindery">Cindery</a>, underscores the fact that these are inherently unreliable sources for Wikipedia, and that citing them violates both the letter and spirit of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>.

Is there any way we could establish that any photo of such graffiti was authentic?&#160;:-) I haven't looked at RS--was it changed to exclude New York Times writers?

<dd>We = Wikipedia website (all editors are representitives) really. What do I need to cite? That we don't normally accept blogs? Well that comes under <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> I believe - as an unreliable source. Exceptions are made for a few things, such as the publications by 'experts' etc... but in light of there not being any evidence that the source is in fact legit then generally, from experience (having done ~5500 edits on the site now) we just disallow the inclusion of blogs. This is common sense. Again, all we are asking for is some evidence that the blogs belong to the people they say they do. Simple. Nothing amazing, nothing complex. Just some evidence. As it stands you are not providing any reason to believe that they are the blogs of those people beyond conjecture and 'they say they are' - which is quite simply not good enough. This seems to have got beyond the point of reasonable arguments and is approaching nonsensical repetition of previous arguments that have no grounds or value. Please provide me with your reasons why these blogs should be considered as reliable sources - and don't use original research to justify them.-<a href="../../../l/o/c/User%7ELocalzuk_3f68.html" title="User:Localzuk">Localzuk</a><sup><a href="../../../l/o/c/User_talk%7ELocalzuk_0fb5.html" title="User talk:Localzuk">(talk)</a></sup> 11:26, 17 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The situation has gotten pretty ridiculous, and Cindery's arguments have become increasingly out of touch with WP policy. At this point, I'm not sure if she simply doesn't understand the policies or is intentionally trying to ignore or wikilawyer them to try and get what she wants. I agree with the idea of no longer wasting time arguing and just reverting the addition of unsourced material (or "sourced" by something unreliable like the two blogs). If the grafitti is truly notable and verifiable, it will appear in a <i>reliable</i> source, not just some guy listing things his friends told him over the phone. --<a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMilo_H_Minderbinder_261f.html" title="User:Milo H Minderbinder">Milo H Minderbinder</a> 13:43, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

In the absence of criteria, any blog of a professional journalist is of "dubious authorship," and there is no agreed way to establish that it is not. (This is not unlike the the EL copyvio discussion, in which Milo noted, hmm, if there's no way to establish that an EL is <i>not</i> a copyvio, people can delete links they don't like on that grounds, and there is no way to prove that the links aren't copyvios. Not logically possible to disprove a negative, etc.) Discussion about changing RS to exclude self-published sources by professional journalists, or to demand an unspecified proof of authorship should take place at RS, not here, as RS currently and explicitly allows self-published sources of professional journalists, and does not demand unspecified proof of authorship.-<a href="../../../c/i/n/User%7ECindery_01fc.html" title="User:Cindery">Cindery</a> 19:11, 17 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>"Ignoring". That's rich. Even if Anasi were a reliable source, we don't know that the blog is actually his. And assuming it is, he may be a journalist but is he an expert on Barrington Hall? (I guess you're ignoring "writing within his or her field of expertise", or do you feel that once someone is published by a big paper, everything they write from then on is automagically guaranteed to be true?) It's not even mentioned in his WP article. Aside from his blog, what has he written about the subject? And what fact checking has taken place (as mentioned in RS) on this particular blog entry? Since he says he got the info from "phone conversations with friends" I suspect none. "In the absence of criteria, any blog of a professional journalist is of "dubious authorship," and there is no agreed way to establish that it is not." This is exactly why blogs are not acceptable in the vast majority of cases. Also, I should point out that based on current WP policy the burden of proof isn't applied the same way for verifiability of sources and info, and copyright. From WP:V: "The burden of evidence lies with the editor who adds or restores material. Any material that is challenged or likely to be challenged needs a reliable source, which should be cited in the article. If an article topic has no reliable, third-party sources, Wikipedia should not have an article on it." --<a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMilo_H_Minderbinder_261f.html" title="User:Milo H Minderbinder">Milo H Minderbinder</a> 19:27, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>1. yes, ignoring. RS clearly states <b>When a well-known professional journalist, has produced self-published material, these may be acceptable as sources, so long as his or her work has been previously published by credible, third-party publications.</b></li>
<li>2. Re "I guess you're ignoring "writing within his or her field of expertise"--RS states "writing within his or her field of expertise" OR is a well-known professional journalist. I believe this is a distinction which allows an experts in sciences who do not write for Rolling Stone to self-publish.</li>
<li>3. Yes, professional journalists and writers are afforded a degree of credibility about what they self-publish that other self-publishers are not--that is why they can be reliable sources/are the exception.</li>
<li>4. If Anasi didn't live in Barrington, he would have to interview people. Are you saying that interviews are not a valid source of information? (If so, there goes every secondary source in Wikipedia, as they all contain interviews. That is the only way to obtain quotes.)</li>
<li>5. Please address the issue of disproving a negative/unspecified criteria of "proof" of authorship.</li>
<li>6. In Anasi's case, his blog looks rather old (not that it matters). But, what are the grounds for doubt that it is his blog?</li>

<dd>Cindery you have to take an entire guideline into account and not just focus on a single line of it. Else we can pick and choose what bits we want all the time - it doesn't work that way!</dd>
<dd>Sorry but you are hugely missing the point and your obsession on including these links is amazing. I will repeat my earlier question - What evidence have you got to show that either of these websites belong to the people you and they say they do?? Right, now, disprove that <a href="http://cinderysblog.blogspot.com/" class="external text" title="http://cinderysblog.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">this</a> blog is not yours... You cannot. Why? Because it is not possible to disprove something like that unless you have another blog that is already <i>known to be yours</i>. (Note, I shall delete the blog in a few hours). In the case of a journalist this situation is the same - somehow we have to be able to track the authenticity (so a link on the journalist's employers website or a plug in their column or something).</dd>
<dd>Finally, don't comment on my editing behaviours as they are irrelevant.

<p>To refocus on the issue at hand: blogs are deprecated as sources because they lack any editorial oversight. Case in point: Anasi's NYT article on Mike Tyson, in which he incorrectly wrote that, with one exception, all heavyweight champs in the last 60 years have been African-American. <a href="http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F50A13F93C590C748CDDAF0894DA404482" class="external text" title="http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F50A13F93C590C748CDDAF0894DA404482" rel="nofollow">The error was picked up and the Times printed a correction</a>. Even experts writing in their field of expertise make mistakes. If such an error occurs on a blog, there's no mechanism to reliably correct it. This is presumably why <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> states that ""<b>Personal websites, blogs, and other self-published or vanity publications should not be used as secondary sources.</b> [emphasis in the original] That is, they should not be used as sources of information about a person or topic other than the owner of the website, or author of the book." But repeating the same arguments seems unlikely to change anyone's mind. If there's really a rush to settle this before <a href="../../../a/r/g/User%7EArgyriou_d8d1.html" title="User:Argyriou">Argyriou</a> produces more reliable sources, an <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERfC_a13a.html" title="WP:RfC">RfC</a> is probably the next step; otherwise the back-and-forth is likely to continue. <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMastCell_1b0e.html" title="User:MastCell">MastCell</a> 20:13, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>(edit conflict, agreed with the two comments above by MastCell and Localzuk) Note the use of the word "<i>may</i>" in that quote (and that RS even emphasizes <i>may</i>). And read the rest of RS which talks about attributability, editorial oversight, declaration of sources, corroboration, recognition by other reliable sources, etc. And specifically "Self-published material, whether published online or as a book or pamphlet, may be used as sources of information about the author, so long as there is no reasonable doubt who wrote the material, and so long as it is...about the subject only and not about third parties or events not directly related to the subject" and "Personal websites, blogs, and other self-published or vanity publications should not be used as secondary sources. That is, they should not be used as sources of information about a person or topic other than the owner of the website, or author of the book." You seem to be under the impression that if someone is published by the New York Times, anything they write anywhere automatically deserves to be a reliable source. As for disproving a negative, if that's not possible, I guess you can't use it as a source. What part of that don't you understand? --<a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMilo_H_Minderbinder_261f.html" title="User:Milo H Minderbinder">Milo H Minderbinder</a> 20:16, 17 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>You're still ignoring that "may" is qualified specifically by "so long as they have been published by credible third party publications," and I have yet to see an answer. (I do think it's an interesting thing to explore further at RS if you have an objection, though.) But let's look at "reasonable doubt" that Robert Anasi writes his blog. I just looked over the first couple of pages, and he has posted a link to a published piece about <a href="../../../h/2E/p/H.P._Lovecraft_03a6.html" title="H.P. Lovecraft">H.P. Lovecraft</a>. &#160;? If you click "email me" at bonus sugar or Sugarhigh, the email address is the same. Hmm. I'm just not seeing any reasonable doubt that these people write their blogs.&#160;? (I think a lot more interviews could be conducted, though. If I <i>were</i> a publicist, and I wanted to make something that happened in 1985 newsworthy in 2007, the easiest way--if I were lucky enough that there was some controversy about blog authorship with reference to the subject--would be to sit back, do nothing, and let people blog about it until it hit print.:-) -<a href="../../../c/i/n/User%7ECindery_01fc.html" title="User:Cindery">Cindery</a> 20:55, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That's a new line of discussion, and I think it would help if you read the sources in the article: graffiti was a *particularly* notable phenomenon in Barrington, and many sources address that. Per long ago discussion above, I stated that there was an overemphasis on Barrington in the 80s (although that is when it got most of the press) and that other decades needed expansion. There is clearly no argument that graffiti was notable. I think it would be redundant to state that the collected graffiti was "from the 80s," as the article notes that graffiti was an 80s phenomenon. I don't think the graffiti is given undue weight, but that there is need (and has been for a long time) for research/expansion of Barrington's history from other decades, especially the 30s, the 60s and the 70s--there are sources for those decades; they were especially interesting.-<a href="../../../c/i/n/User%7ECindery_01fc.html" title="User:Cindery">Cindery</a> 23:45, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's not a "catalog" of the graffiti--that would take 400 pages. It's <i>examples</i> of the most-remembered/significant, which give an idea of what the place was like. As such, it's valuable to the article because it gives view into the culture/the time/the place. As lists go, it's extremely brief (esp. in comparison to "famous people with uterine cancer," etc.)-<a href="../../../c/i/n/User%7ECindery_01fc.html" title="User:Cindery">Cindery</a> 23:57, 17 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Considering that people are having to create new blog entries to try and document them, they seem the very opposite of "most-remembered" or "significant". If they were truly significant, they would be documented somewhere. --<a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMilo_H_Minderbinder_261f.html" title="User:Milo H Minderbinder">Milo H Minderbinder</a> 00:00, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>(edit conflict; reply to Milo)I don't think that's helpful or constructive--please assume good faith. Your precept seems to be that the graffiti did not exist; the graffiti noted here is not the most remembered/significant. Again, I did not write or create the graffiti section. Arygiou states that he saw it, and that there are probably records. I think that some is documented in Mahlen's site "Colorful website from the 80s," and I have already stated that I am not sure it isn't documented in press which is not available online. People who lived in Barrington in the 80s are living now (for the most part) and hence can be interviewed. If professional journalists interview them, or note the graffiti, they have indirectly done Wikipedia a favor (by providing an online source which can be checked online).-<a href="../../../c/i/n/User%7ECindery_01fc.html" title="User:Cindery">Cindery</a> 00:09, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There are many things which are true which are unsuitable for inclusion in WIkipedia.

<dd>On the other hand, if they've been published in the <i>Daily Californian</i> or, for that matter, the <i>Berkeley Barb,</i> that would be fine. If you can cite an issue of a local newspaper that a) mentions these graffiti and b) says that they're important or classic or part of the local culture or something like that, I'd support their inclusion.</dd>
