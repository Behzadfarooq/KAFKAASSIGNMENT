<p>Awesome! Now let's <i>really</i> test your memory: In the late 1950s, WGN-TV ran a late-afternoon show featuring Bugs Bunny cartoons, and also a live host named Dick Coughlin, who talked to a Bugs Bunny puppet that "lived" in a tree... kind of a variant on the Garfield Goose schtick. If you remember those shows, you're hiding your age well. &#160;:) <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 22:49, 27 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>In serious need of TLC it is. It'll have to wait until the weekend, though. BTW, I nominated the Category:American Pop Culture at <a href="../../../c/f/d/CfD_daf1.html" title="CfD">CfD</a> <i>not</i> to delete it, but to have it renamed to Cateory:American pop culture as per the Wikipedia Manual of Style. It looks like they're finding that it's a bit too broad to be maintainable (which, truth be told, it is; it could also be seen as being Anglo-American centric as well). --<a href="../../../f/u/r/User%7EFuriousFreddy_75f4.html" title="User:FuriousFreddy">FuriousFreddy</a> 17:23, 4 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thank you for pointing that out - both sides were incomplete, and gosh it was hard to kind the key. Noticed some inconsistencies so i went in to clean up - thanks for pointing out the extra table. though it doesnt seem to include a couple other single categories, like the lightblue for 12" MAXI singles. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarrettmagic_ed4a.html" title="User:Barrettmagic">Barrettmagic</a> 12:20 10 August 2005 (UTC)

<dd>True, there are no separate colour for 45s, etc. I think the problem with that is that most singles are released in several formats: 7", 12", cd1, cd2 and so forth. So it's not really possible to classify singles like that. I'll add a link to the songs project. <a href="../../../f/l/o/User%7EFlowerparty_4b7e.html" title="User:Flowerparty">Flowerparty</a> <sup><a href="../../../f/l/o/User_talk%7EFlowerparty_6764.html" title="User talk:Flowerparty">talk</a></sup> 19:46, 10 August 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Are you sure the box is blue for that reason. Often people just assume there's no official policy for deciding which colour to use and pick one that they like instead. I'm assuming <s>Like a Prayer (song)</s> is such a case.

<p>You shouldn't do copy and paste moves of articles to change the title - that way the history of the article gets split between two pages (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Yellow_Submarine_%28Song%29&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Yellow_Submarine_%28Song%29&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Yellow_Submarine_%28song%29&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Yellow_Submarine_%28song%29&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>).

<p>Disambig pages are fine for certain articles that have more than one meaning; however, in the case of Casino Royale, every ambiguous meaning is an adaptation of Ian Fleming's novel. So if you type in Casino Royale, you should get the book. Right off the bat in the intro it 1) uses {{<a href="../../../o/t/h/Template%7EOtheruses_bbf8.html" title="Template:Otheruses">otheruses</a>}} that links to a disambiguation page with other meanings for "Casino Royale", this is used on a number of pages (including <i><a href="../../../g/o/l/GoldenEye_bd88.html" title="GoldenEye">GoldenEye</a></i>, which has a number of meanins - most of them relating to Ian Fleming) and 2) it clearly states the others meanings (adaptations) and actually links to them in the intro as well. I think because of those two and the fact that the page is kind of set up like an overview article now, that it's easy to navigate and better than having "Casino Royale" as a disambig page. It is for the best, at least IMHO, that the 1967 spoof was moved to its own page. I don't disagree with that move. In fact I was planning to get around to it, most likely later in the year when I have time to write up more background on Casino Royale - it being the foundings of Bond and technically based on a real-life happening, although heavily embellished. <a href="../../../k/1/b/User%7EK1Bond007_3a91.html" title="User:K1Bond007">K1Bond007</a> 16:19, August 16, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello. I removed two of the pictures because four images in such a brief article was too many and made the page look like a gecocities fan site. I see your point that a recent picture might be more relevant: I'd suggest that the <i>1990</i> image is <b>replaced</b> by the <i>2000</i>photograph. The <i>10</i> photograph is iconic, so I'd like to see that stay. I left a message on the talk page before I did anything, but no one responded after a few days. , so I was <a href="../../../b/e/_/Wikipedia%7EBe_bold_in_updating_pages_1d2f.html" title="Wikipedia:Be bold in updating pages">bold</a>. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_JPS_fb9e.html" title="User:The JPS">The JPS</a> 15:54, 3 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>If the file also doesn't have a copyright tag, then one should be added.
