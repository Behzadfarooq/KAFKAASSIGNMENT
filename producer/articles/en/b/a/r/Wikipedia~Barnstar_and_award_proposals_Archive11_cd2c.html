This barnstar can be user to award Wikipedia Youth. I, as a member of the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_Youth_Foundation_0d61.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia Youth Foundation">Wikipedia Youth Foundation</a>, believe that young editors should be commended with a seperate, more appropriate star. (Like a Barnstar looking like a plush toy). I don't know how to create barnstars, though. Could someone make it?--<a href="../../../l/e/r/User%7ELeroyencyclopediabrown_71f9.html" title="User:Leroyencyclopediabrown">walkingencyclopedia</a> 16:34, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>The awards are for actions. What action should youth be awarded for? --<a href="../../../e/v/r/User%7EEvrik_3a44.html" title="User:Evrik">evrik</a> 17:45, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I'm sorry, I didn't make myself clear. I was talking about contributions relating to articles for young children. For example, tirelessly contributing to articles made for <a href="../../../d/i/s/Disney_Channel_faad.html" title="Disney Channel">Disney Channel</a>, <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nickelodeon_%28TV_channel%29_ac4d.html" title="Nickelodeon (TV channel)">Nickelodeon</a> could qualify as a special barnstar for that person. In other words, the barnstar is used for contributing to youth articles. --<a href="../../../l/e/r/User%7ELeroyencyclopediabrown_71f9.html" title="User:Leroyencyclopediabrown">walkingencyclopedia</a> 18:47, 21 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>Hmmmm ... well, the are you proposing a youth-related topical award or is there a wikiproject relating to youth? --<a href="../../../e/v/r/User%7EEvrik_3a44.html" title="User:Evrik">evrik</a> 19:19, 21 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>Yes! That's what I'm talking about: a youth topical award. Cn you make it? I've only been here for a month, and I'm still trying to get the hang of things. I don't even know how to make a barnstar.--<a href="../../../l/e/r/User%7ELeroyencyclopediabrown_71f9.html" title="User:Leroyencyclopediabrown">walkingencyclopedia</a> 20:20, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I think that there should be a Barnstar for those editors and writers that contribute to Wikipedia, but not just to one particular subject. The Barnstars we have today are "specialized." I know that a lot of people write really weird but really good articles that doesn't fit into any of the Barnstar categories. What I'm proposing is a Barnstar for anything. Any article. Any change. Any contribution. For anyone and everyone. Unfortunatly, I'm not really into image creation, and, so, am having difficulty creating this Barnstar. If anyone is interested, feel free to make one and present it here. Best wishes. -- <a href="../../../w/o/l/User%7EWolfie001_2b41.html" title="User:Wolfie001">Wolfie001</a> 20:52, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

As a spinoff from the TV/Radio Barnstar, I have developed a Music Barnstar. This also covers the music video section as well. The barnstar glows in a black <a href="../../../e/i/g/Eighth_note.html" title="Eighth note">eighth note</a>. This was developed because one was needed for music/music video. This will not cover radio articles: the equivalent is the TV/Radio barnstar. -TrackerTV 00:41, 25 July 2006 (UTC)

<p><b>Comment</b> I made it specifically because I thought the RMB unsuitable as it is too general. Football is the most popular sport worldwide, and is appropriately well-represented on the project. There may be many other users like me who felt the RMB unsuitable for a football editor, as it shows a stylised runner. I am not suggesting that every sport should have its own barnstar, just football. It seems to me to be big enough to deserve it. Hope that makes sense. --<a href="../../../g/u/i/User%7EGuinnog_5d26.html" title="User:Guinnog">Guinnog</a> 22:47, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>User:Daniel.Bryant/Comment - OK, I see the main point is that the Football/Soccer barnstar covers this area, and therefore this doesn't deserve its' own listing. I accept your reasoning, and wish to withdraw this nomination, provided it isn't against any rule/policy to give this the title of the "A-League <b>Barnstar</b>". Can someone just assure me we will be allowed to call it that title, and then I will be happy to withdraw this proposal. <b><a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel.Bryant_22a1.html" title="User:Daniel.Bryant"><font face="tahoma" color="#086F9A">Daniel</font></a>.<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel.Bryant_Esperanza_c5f3.html" title="User:Daniel.Bryant/Esperanza"><font face="tahoma" color="green">Bryant</font></a></b> 06:15, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><br />
This is a proposed series of awards for service: <b><a href="../../../s/e/r/WP%7ESERVICE_5427.html" title="WP:SERVICE">WP:SERVICE</a></b></p>
<p>As I have it now, this is unlike other awards in that:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is based strictly on a mechanical count of service time and number of edits. (Yes I know about editcountitis.)</li>
<li>It can be self-awarded.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is no human judgement (=politics) involved here. If nobody likes you, you still get one (if you qualify). If everyone likes you, you still can't get one (unless you qualify).</p>
<p>Right now, I have it as only being for editors who are not admins. The reason being, I was thinking that there ought to be something, that is kind of hard to get, <i>besides</i> becoming an admin.</p>
<p>This would only be very useful if it catches on, though. I think this is kind of unlikely. Partly because people who are <i>currently</i> eligible are likely to be blasé and uninterested. But it's not for them, it's for editors who aspire to be like them, so perhaps they could be be jollied into going along, some of them anyway. (To get a list of eligible editors I'd need to query the database which I don't know how to do, but that's a detail. After the backlog is cleared, and supposing it did catch on, editors just help themselves, I guess.)</p>
<p>I'm wondering if this is even worthwhile. Anyway, I liked making the graphics, and suggesting an entirely different use for them would be fine, too.</p>
<p>Questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Does this make sense. Is it likely useful.</li>
<li>Does it make sense for it only to be for editors who are <i>not</i> admins.</li>
<li>Are the levels set too high or too low.</li>
<li>Other.</li>

<li><b>Note</b>: I added one more level and made a couple of the early "steps" be six months instead of a year. All open to criticism/comment of course.

<li>Not that I'm trying to make parallels with Wikipedia at all, but it would be like messageboards have certain ranks for the number of posts a person has.

<li>Done. Although I think there are better terms than "snorf", "snorf klangtnor", and "snorf klangtnor angkt", but I can't think of any right off. "Mank" is OK I think because it references "manque" which is an obscure term for "wannabe". <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 07:52, 20 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>This whole idea seems rather silly and self-serving. --South Philly 00:52, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Hmmm, I think maybe that Knight Grand Cross and so forth is too formal. And anything military like "lieutenant" would be straight out. The Counter-Vandalism Unit has been attacked for sounding too "military" already. This <i>is</i> Wikipedia, I think we have way more anti-militarists than not. I don't know, though. I think various shades of "editor" are straightforward, <i>somewhat</i> formal, and to the point, while the various shades of "Tutnum" are kind of like "Pooh-bah" or such, to be taken less seriously. What WOULD be cool if there was someone who knew heraldry or medal design to make a third "more formal" path, using the Knight Grand Cross and whatnot (which I personally like as an <i>additional</i> third path, not replacing the others.)</li>
<li>South Philly, you have a point, but the reasoning is not to serve self but serve the 'pedia by enticing editors to keep it up to "get to the next level", granted it seems silly that people would care about that... but some do. I know I would.</li>
<li>I also note that two people already (at least) have awarded these to other editors, I don't know how they even found it. <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 03:34, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Taking all the discussions together, I'm seeing a roughly 50-50 split. So here's what I'm going to do now (which of course any editor can change), which seems a reasonable compromise:</p>
<ul>
<li>I won't delete the service awards, but I also won't make templates of the individual awards, list them on the barnstar template, or add any mention of them anywhere on the barnstar pages.</li>
<li>I will move the page from my userspace to Wikipedia space, let them remain in the Category:Wikipedia awards (another editor has placed them there), and personally give out a <i>few</i> here and there.</li>
<li>If another editor wants to put up the page as a "Proposed guideline" to get either a decisive rejection or acceptance, that would perhaps be reasonable in my opinion. True, they are just barnstars, which don't usually go up a proposed guidelines, but since its a whole system of stars maybe it would be OK. <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 21:02, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I am proposing a slight modification to the barnstar barnstar. In the existing image there is a black dot in the middle of the smaller star (most likely due to copying the image which changes transparent parts to black, if anyone knows how this can not be done please inform me). I have eliminated the spot, though it is a bit pixely if anyone can fix that, and I am proposing the switch here just in case there is any opposition. --<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillMak050389_99a3.html" title="User:WillMak050389"><font color="#336699">Will</font></a><a href="../../../w/i/l/User_talk%7EWillMak050389_3c7d.html" title="User talk:WillMak050389"><font color="#660000">Mak</font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_WillMak050389_060d.html" title="Special:Contributions/WillMak050389"><font color="gray">050389</font></a> 19:58, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think that there are enough television and radio articles to warrant a barnstar meant for extraordinary contributions to television and radio. This proposal would be used by WikiProjects Television and Radio (plus any subprojects, like Television Stations).</p>

<p>Medicine is a major part of Wikipedia, having tens of thousands of articles, but has no award. It falls awkwardly between Science and Life. It may not be suitable as a barnstar, but if not chosen for that, I'm sure <a href="../../../m/e/d/WP%7EMED_be36.html" title="WP:MED">WikiProject Medicine</a> wouldn't mind having this as a WikiProject award. <font style="color:#CC1111"><b>s</b>murrayinch</font><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><font style="color:green"><i><b>e</b></i></font></a><font style="color:#CC1111">ster<sup>(<a href="../../../s/m/u/User%7ESmurrayinchester_f294.html" title="User:Smurrayinchester">User</a>), (<a href="../../../s/m/u/User_talk%7ESmurrayinchester_aa08.html" title="User talk:Smurrayinchester">Talk</a>)</sup></font> 15:32, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I noticed that Cabalists, Mediators and Arbitrators do an awful lot of work on Wikipedia, and they hardly get any recognition. I thought we ought to roll out a barnstar in their honor. I approached <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESango123_0773.html" title="User:Sango123">Sango123</a> to ask her if she would design the barnstar, seeing as I am no good at design.

<p>Subsequent comments should be made in a new section. What I had in mind is a ten pointed Barnstar Award. You take two Gold Barnstars, rotate one until you get a Barnstar that has ten points on it. Then in this is placed a silver circle, in that is a large gold <b>A</b>. Outside of the ten point Barnstar, is a set of wings, similar to what is seen in certain USAF designations, so that this Barnstar looks like one that has wings on it. I intend to call this the <b>Admin Gold Medal</b>, to be awarded to outstanding Admins. Appreciate your assisstance, patience in this matter. I know of some Admins I'd like to award this thing to, if it is approved. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartial_Law_9af9.html" title="User:Martial Law">Martial Law</a> 16:55, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Although I strongly believe that all Admins User Pages should indicate that they are Admin with a Userbox or a disclaimer or something. I can understand the Noms motivations, and I think they are well intentioned. I feel a Barnstar for Admins only is way too exclusive and elitist. I think the this will strengthen a Clique Admin culture within the Wikipedia, and leave regular joes like me out. An Admin Barnstar could mean more than a regular Barnstar because only select Wikipedians can qualify. And having a Barnstar with two Barnstars of equal size symbolizes that an Admin Barnstar is more important than other Barnstars. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPete_Peters_7b3c.html" title="User:Pete Peters">Pete Peters</a> 22:05, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I propose a welcoming commitee <s>barnstar</s> <i>award</i>. It should be awarded to <a href="../../../w/e/l/Welcoming_Commitee_d461.html" title="Welcoming Commitee">Welcoming Commitee</a> members who tirelessly welcome new users with lots of WikiLove. There are lots of <a href="../../../w/e/l/Welcoming_Commitee_d461.html" title="Welcoming Commitee">Welcoming Commitee</a> members who deserve an award like this. I encourage people to create a new design for it.

<li>I dunno. It seems like thanking people can be done with many of the existing awards. Isn't it against the spirit of the Welcoming Committee to expect to get an award?

<li>The fourth makes for an ok award, I suppose. As for a barnstar, how about one that enlarges the "speaking person" (the center of #1) and places a classic barnstar in the thought balloon?</li>

<p>Hey, I just found the big gallery of Barnstars of National Merit for various specific countries over in the Commons. Can we have one for Hungary? I think a few of those may be in order if we manage to get the <a href="../../../1/9/5/1956_Hungarian_Revolution_3abe.html" title="1956 Hungarian Revolution">1956 Hungarian Revolution</a> article tops on the Article Creation and Improvement drive, and especially if it becomes featured article on Oct. 23 as is our hope!

<ul>
<li><b>Reject</b> The new image has all the same problems as the old one - you have a fairly photographic image of a barnstar stuck in front of a line drawing of a computer - and the two clash horribly. You need to keep the same style throughout the image or else it looks like <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mary_Poppins_%28film%29_6745.html" title="Mary Poppins (film)">Mary Poppins (film)</a> in which live action was just crudely pasted over cartoon action. Either use a more photographic computer - or a more line-drawn barnstar. But I still think you should come up with something less obvious. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteveBaker_6942.html" title="User:SteveBaker">SteveBaker</a> 22:42, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Support 3b</b> 22:43, 22 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The original concept behind 3a was of 'bringing Computing &amp; Wikipedia into sharp focus' - so the star shows sharp text in classic 'green screen' style where the award is - and blurry text where it isn't. For good measure, the text I chose is the first few lines of the MediaWiki sourcecode (index.php in the latest distro). OK - so it's heavy on the symbolism - but IMHO, it doesn't look too shabby. However, as was subsequently pointed out, (3a) <i><b>almost</b></i> looks like the star is reflected in an old-style green-screen monitor - and by making all of the text equally blurry (which is what 3b is), that's the effect you get. So, 3b is simply a barnstar reflected in a monitor that's showing the beginning of the Wiki source code. The text is intentionally out of focus now because we are focussing our attentions on a reflection - which makes the 'foreground' be out of focus - it adds a touch of realism. I actually prefer 3b - it's subtle. If you make all of the text sharp - it just looks cheesey and obvious - and I'm not interested in going that way.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>If you really wanted to go the circuit board route, I think you'd need to do with some 3D modelling and make the star be somewhat in perspective with the components on it sticking up out of it. The star would need bevelled edges or something so it looks 'finished' - and you'd want to take care that none of the components were cut in half by the edges of the star. As it is now, it just looks like someone cut out a photo with scissors. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteveBaker_6942.html" title="User:SteveBaker">SteveBaker</a> 02:15, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Your first vote was before all of the images we currently are considering were included - and also we were initially asking the question "Should there be a computing barnstar?". From where I'm sitting it looks like we unanimously agree that we want a barnstar - and (if you sort out the order of arrival of votes and images), I think we have a definite preference for 3b. Are we done? Do we have some sort of consensus? If so, I'll do whatever is necessary to move it onto the barnstar page. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteveBaker_6942.html" title="User:SteveBaker">SteveBaker</a> 01:46, 28 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>But you could equally argue that #5 is all about hardware and that there needs to be a more general design to encompass the software parts of the art. I don't think you can come up with a single image that says it all - so no matter what you pick you'll have a bias one way or the other. #5 just seems so crudely done - there are white speckles all around the edges of the star and the lighting on the laptop is poor and doesn't match the star. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteveBaker_6942.html" title="User:SteveBaker">SteveBaker</a> 23:08, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This is a concept for <s>a barnstar</s> an award for exemplary work in Automotive-related articles. Note that there was general support for a Railroad star, and the Automotive section of Wiki is comparable in size, support and need for recognition. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteveBaker_6942.html" title="User:SteveBaker">SteveBaker</a> 06:01, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Support.</b> The Auto project has grown quite large and considering the extensive scope of the project a custom barnstar is more than appropriate. Besdies, I like this particular proposal: It's easily recognizable as a barnstar, yet clearly hints at the subject matter of the project.

<li>The consensus is that each wikiproject can create its own award, and that anyone can place an award on the PUA page. However, to have an award listed on the wikiproject page, or to create a barnstar, it has to be vetted here first and that consensus or greta support must be achieved. --<a href="../../../e/v/r/User%7EEvrik_3a44.html" title="User:Evrik">evrik</a> 21:38, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Simply stated, because the image already existed (<a href="../../../s/a/i/Image%7ESaintBarnstar.PNG_152f.html" title="Image:SaintBarnstar.PNG">Image:SaintBarnstar.PNG</a> was created in December 2005, and the creation of the WikiProject Award was simply a reuse of an existing image. --<a href="../../../e/v/r/User%7EEvrik_3a44.html" title="User:Evrik">evrik</a> 15:03, 18 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>The logic makes perfect sense. The image was accepted for one use. After the imnage had been accepted, two different WikiProjects adopted it as theirs.

<p><b>Update</b> - The consensus both here and on the Automobiles project appears to be that we 100% agree that we need an automotive barnstar - and that almost everyone likes the idea of a star overlaid on a custom wheel - but that not everyone likes this particular custom wheel. Whilst I think we have the votes to justify making the image above be the automotive barnstar, it would be better to try some more designs based around the car wheel motif. I'll be working on that as time permits. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteveBaker_6942.html" title="User:SteveBaker">SteveBaker</a> 15:26, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

Automotive Wikiproject <s>Barnstar</s> Award</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>After further discussion on the Automobile project page, I am please to announce that there is a clear consensus in favor of adopting this image as the Automobile project Barnstar to be awarded for all significant contributions of an automotive nature. For those who care, the image is of a Simca 1000 GL - the car was originally blue and the hubcap had an ALMOST barnstarish look that took a little GIMPing around to look as it does now. Thanks to Bravada for suggesting it. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteveBaker_6942.html" title="User:SteveBaker">SteveBaker</a> 20:06, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Good idea! I have actually been looking for a suitable award like that once and ended up awarding somebody a <a href="../../../c/h/r/Chrysler.html#Logos" title="Chrysler">Pentastar</a>. For some reason I find a very appropriate travesty of the original barnstar concept. Unfortunately, the only pic of the pentastar is the one I insert below, though I think that it's roughness only adds to the effect. If somebody could get hold of a hood ornament of the 1980s Imperial Coupe photogrpahed head-on, I think it would be a perfect Pentastar!

<dd>But that's a photo, not the logo itself. Unless of course some anal-retentive copyright maniacs butt in, it is a free photo and can be used wherever we want. If anything, we are promoting it rather than disgracing it, besides the company has not been using it for some time now. Finally, the pentastar as such is nobody's property, it is just a generic graphic design. I would be even more for a graphic interpretation of it, perhaps having a barnstar-like Pentastar posing as a hood ornament. Somebody would have to do it (*sigh*), perhaps I will think of it later.</dd>
<dd>My problem with the "alloy barnstar" is that simply I am not quite enamoured with it graphically (with all due respect to Steve, who surely put a lot of effort in it). Compared to the railway barnstar, which you can find just above in the nominations page, it is not really that refined, and I do not feel too good about striving for a 20-inch gaudy Giovanni. I like the way the author of the railway barnstar propositions incorporated the barnstar design discreetly into a really nice photo, without making it too obvious. If we could have something like this, it would be great. Bravada, <a href="../../../b/r/a/User_talk%7EBravada_8b8b.html" title="User talk:Bravada">talk</a> - 11:56, 13 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I don't mean to be an anal-retentive copyright maniac as it were, but my understanding is that a picture of a logo is <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Derivative_works" class="extiw" title="commons:Commons:Derivative_works">nearly equivalent</a> to any other image of the logo (otherwise we'd constantly be getting around the fair-use issue by taking lots of photos of subway maps and famous artwork and television screens and such, and declaring them magically public-domain). This seems to be only loosely enforced on WIkipedia and even Commons, but if a photo is exclusively of a logo, it seems like it makes itself a more obvious target. (granted, there's <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Car_company_logos" class="external text" title="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Car_company_logos" rel="nofollow">this</a>, but those are <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Commons:Deletion_requests&amp;oldid=2672183#Category:Logos" class="external text" title="http://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Commons:Deletion_requests&amp;oldid=2672183#Category:Logos" rel="nofollow">being discussed for deletion now</a>). --<a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInteriot_4e2d.html" title="User:Interiot">Interiot</a> 12:48, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for drawing my attention to that - I placed a warning on the deletion page! The problem is that this category, apart from artistic depictions of details of automobiles, also contains logos outright copied from the Internet or something, so no wonder it raised concerns. I believe that a photo of a badge or hood ornament does not infringe any rights of the automaker, as we do not use for commercial purposes or anyhow else that would inflict losses on the company (quite contrary to photographing a map, as the photograph might serve the same purpose of the map - you can figure out the rest). I guess you have all seen numerous photos of badges and signs on products, buildings etc. placed in print media articles more or less directly discussing the company or product. I doubt it whether they contact the trademark owner for permission everytime they publish a photo like that.</dd>
<dd>Anyway, this is a totally different issue. What I wanted to propose is some internal contest for the design of the Automotive Barnstar. I don't know whether many of us are gifted with artistic talents (I am not), so maybe we can post raw ideas here, and get some of the Wikipedia artists to submit their designs, both based on our suggestions and their own concepts.

<dd>Well, I'm quite 100% certain I don't want a company logo for the barnstar...no, no, no - hell no. There are two issues to decide here: Firstly - do we agree that we want there to be an automotive barnstar? Secondly - what graphic do we want? I don't here any objections to the first - but we're not happy with the second. Please don't spare my feelings - the chrome rim barnstar was a 5 minute job, I'm a 3D graphics geek and I can create stuff like that very easily. So - let's kick around some ideas for what it should look like and when we have some good ideas I'll be very happy to do the detailed design and rendering - and even knock up a few variations that we could vote on.</dd>

<dd>What I don't like about the railroad barnstar is that it's a photo with a barnstar embedded into it - none of the other barnstars out there are full rectangular photos and it looks out of place. I chose the chrome rim because it's cut out like the original barnstar whilst clearly saying "Automotive" by being recognisably part of a car. I think that's more appropriate than (say) a regular rusty star with a car stuck over the top of it. Barnstars generally seek to be somewhat witty and clever. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteveBaker_6942.html" title="User:SteveBaker">SteveBaker</a> 14:52, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><i>(indent reset)</i> Well, I actually like the railway barnstar very much for what you mentioned - it is not an in-your-face image screaming "BARNSTAR!" with a blinking neon light over it and Elgar's "Pump &amp; Circumstance" playing while Miller's and popcorn are being handed out. No, it is a discreet, elegant, refined picture of high quality by itself, with a small hint recognizable by those in the know. It will always come with loads and loads of info on what it is and there can be no mistake about that, so I guess the fact that it isn't the standard barnstar with Thomas the Tank Engine (who is a subject of a separate project btw) slapped on it is not a problem. If it doesn't fit in with the other barnstars, it says something of the quality of their quality.</p>
<p>What I would strive for is a barnstar that would exude the same qualities, being a refined, high-quality picture itself, with a recognizable reference to the scope of this WikiProject, and a barnstar well-composed into it. Apart from the Railway Barnstar, I can think of two current barnstars that have similar qualities - <a href="../../../h/o/l/Image%7EHollywood_Barnstar3.png_7560.html" title="Image:Hollywood Barnstar3.png">The Hollywood Barnstar</a> and <a href="../../../b/l/u/Image%7EBlueprint_Barnstar_2.PNG_a2e6.html" title="Image:Blueprint Barnstar 2.PNG">The Blueprint Barnstar</a> (although the barnstars are pretty evident due to the theme employed). Coming close would be the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Image%7EStargatebarnstar.jpg_5987.html" title="Image:Stargatebarnstar.jpg">Stargate Barnstar</a>, although the idea might not be that inventive.</p>
<p>My vision is something quite like the <a href="http://www.absolutads.com/gallery/" class="external text" title="http://www.absolutads.com/gallery/" rel="nofollow">Absolut Vodka ads</a> (excuse me to indirectly promot alcohol here, ApolloBoy and Karrmann please don't click the link&#160;;-) ), where the iconic bottle is cleverly composed into different backgrounds. People who know what it is about can really appreciate those little works of art.</p>
<p>On the other hand, nobody says we should absolutely have our award in the form of a barnstar. The fellow airborne WikiProject employs some very nifty <a href="../../../w/i/k/Image%7EWikiwings2.png_6e05.html" title="Image:Wikiwings2.png">WikiWings</a>. Perhaps we can devise a more unique award like that?</p>
<p>Here's a list of items that one can compose a barnstar in, or can derive a new award from - I hope other will chip in:</p>
<ul>
<li>car's wheel (obvious)</li>
<li>steering wheel</li>
<li>hood ornament or a badge</li>
<li>car keys or a keychain</li>
<li>engine cover</li>
<li>(your proposition)</li>
</ul>

<dd>So - I tried the obvious car wheel and a few people don't like it...Karrmann suggests: steering wheel, hood ornament, car keys or engine cover. Engine covers don't really lend themselves to star-shaped things - they are square things - we need a round thing. A barnstar car key is certainly do-able. I like that idea. The trouble with it being a hood ornament is that we wouldn't know it <i>was</i> a hood ornament (as opposed to a shiney chrome barnstar) because a hood ornament is just a chrome thing with no other distinguishing features. Somehow I don't like the steering wheel suggestion. Hmmm - OK - so how about I try a car key? <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteveBaker_6942.html" title="User:SteveBaker">SteveBaker</a> 18:39, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I believe you have to think out of the box. Try to fend off the negative feelings towards the railway barnstar and rectangular shapes - all graphic files are rectangular after all. We do not really have to make our barnstar look like all other barnstars - it's rather them that should catch up with our great design&#160;:D If the resulting design won't pass as a barnstar, why not call it something else? We might use the barnstar theme to signify that it belongs to the "Wikipedia awards" family, or not, like in the case of Wikiwings. A hood ornament can be portrayed so that the fact that it is standing on a car's bonnet is evident.

But on the offchance that nobody does...I'm here to help. I do feel it's important for our barnstar to fit in harmoniously with all of the others - and whilst I like the railway star image a lot, I don't think it fits the bill for that reason.

<dd>Yes, Bravada, I know all Barnstars are clearly labeled, but for esthetic purposes it is still nice if they're easily recognizable. As I said I'm fine with the key too, but liked the wheel better-In this case I'll make things easier and would, if there is a vote, cast my vote in favor of either one. <b><a href="../../../g/e/r/User%7EGerdbrendel_cba6.html" title="User:Gerdbrendel"><font face="Arial" color="#1F860E">Signature</font></a><font color="#20038A"><sup><a href="../../../g/e/r/User%7EGerdbrendel_cba6.html" title="User:Gerdbrendel">brendel</a></sup></font></b> 23:59, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, my sense of esthethics clearly differs, as for me it is nice that e.g. the railway barnstar is not that strikingly recognizable - I like understatement.

I just emailed the owner and asked if I could use the photo (Yes, I could) - then I touched up the highlights and emphasised the grooves along the arms of the star to make it look more like a barnstar. There are dozens and dozens of wheel patterns with five armed stars out there though. I like the idea of a more subtle star that's not immediately obvious. That's what I was trying for with the key. At first you see a car key - and it's only a moment or two later that you see the embossed barnstar on the bow. It's a standard GM car key - from an era just before everyone started cramming electronics and other junk into big plastic lumps. I can put this treatment onto just about any key you guys could come up with - I did some Porshe and RollsRoyce keys first - but those actually look even more plain than the GM key I finally settled on. But if you have a better key to choose from - I'm game to add the barnstar to it. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteveBaker_6942.html" title="User:SteveBaker">SteveBaker</a> 03:51, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Okay seems like we settled on a key-barnstar design (that may not be my first choise, but its fine with me). Anyways, the GM key seems allright but just to throw an idea out there-how about a Mercedes-Benz key (w/o plastic) with the MB symbol revised to look like a bartnstar. I now I want to avoid confusion I am not stating that the MB symbol should serve as the Barnstar, the symbol should be photoshopped to take on a more abstract form. This would be an interesting play on the car logo idea. Anyway, just some food for though.

<p><i>(reset indent again)</i> I don't think we "settled on" anything yet - is there any rush? I think we might wait, perhaps some other people will come with other propositions, or Steve will have yet another idea. I have asked some Wikipedia artists, who designed nice barnstars before, whether they would like to submit their propositions, so I suggest we would wait for them.</p>
<p>As concerns the car key, now that you told me it's a GM key I can see the GM logo peeking from behind more and more&#160;:D I have no idea how the pre-electronics Mercedes key looks like, but perhaps if somebody could find an image, it would be good to try that too. Finally, I think the wheel itself is a good idea, especially not a sole rim, but a whole wheel with a tire sitting in a wheelwell. I absolutely loathe shiny Pimp-My-Ride Giovannis, but a nice-looking wheel would absolutely do the trick for me. I invite you once again to take a look at the Primula - totally accidentally, Autbianchi designers managed to incorporate the barnstar theme in a very good way!

<dd>Yeah - now you come to mention it - it does look like a ghost of the original GM logo is still there. I promise to fix that if we decide we want that image - but I don't plan to spend more time on it until/unless we do because it's already good enough to give you the idea. So far, I hear Gerdbrendel expressing a preference for the wheel - but not objecting to the key. I prefer the wheel - but could live with the key if there was a strong majority for it. I think Bravada likes the key - but so far is the only person who has actually said so. On the other hand, on the <a href="../../../b/a/r/Wikipedia%7EBarnstar_and_award_proposals_New_Proposals_3fb9.html#Automotive_Barnstar" title="Wikipedia:Barnstar and award proposals/New Proposals">Wikipedia:Barnstar_and_award_proposals/New_Proposals#Automotive_Barnstar</a> page, there are another three people (Jared, Gray Porpoise and Digital me) who said they love the wheel graphic. So I'd say it was pretty strongly in favor of the wheel right now. We need more people contributing artwork - or at least proposing ideas that I could turn into artwork for you. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteveBaker_6942.html" title="User:SteveBaker">SteveBaker</a> 22:15, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I am pestering a number of graphic artists for contributions now, so hopefully we might have more choice. Frankly speaking, I like the CONCEPT of the wheel more, I just hate the gaudy Giovanni rim&#160;:D (not your artwork, but the base). Concerning ideas - I am still under the impression how the Autobianchi Primula wheels resemble our barnstar pattern - see here <a href="http://www.clubautobianchi.com/images_primula/Primula_16.jpg" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.clubautobianchi.com/images_primula/Primula_16.jpg" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> and here <a href="http://www.clubautobianchi.com/images_primula/Primula_15.jpg" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.clubautobianchi.com/images_primula/Primula_15.jpg" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. Unfortunately, I haven't got hold of any photos of these in higher resolution (not to mention free), and my puny attempts to recreate this design ended up so that I am even more ashamed of my lack of PhotoShop talent. But if you had some spare time, perhaps you might give it a try - I would start with any five- or six-spoke rim with a reasonably thick tire on it. I tried to resize the central element of the barnstar (how do you call it?) to make it serve as a central wheelcover and it worked, it was making it all fit into an image of a wheel in a wheelwell where I had to admit defeat. Would be great if you could do that! Bravada, <a href="../../../b/r/a/User_talk%7EBravada_8b8b.html" title="User talk:Bravada">talk</a> - 22:26, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>For those who wanted a 'wheel' design for the Automotive barnstar - but <i><b>not</b></i> the chrome wheel I did before, here is a suitably doctored Simca1000 wheel following a suggestion from Bravada over on the <a href="../../../b/a/r/Wikipedia%7EBarnstar_and_award_proposals_New_Proposals_3fb9.html" title="Wikipedia:Barnstar and award proposals/New Proposals">Wikipedia:Barnstar_and_award_proposals/New_Proposals</a> page. I'm not sure which of the cropped designs looks best. The one at the extreme left is a bit too subtle IMHO - at normal barnstar sizes it's really not obvious that it's a barnstar at all. I think the one that's second from the right is probably the best mix of "This is a Barnstar" and "This isn't obviously a barnstar until you look carefully". <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteveBaker_6942.html" title="User:SteveBaker">SteveBaker</a> 11:31, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Today on GIMP My Ride....&#160;:D You have even repainted the Simca - I like the color much more than the blue, actually! More seriously, these are really good! The middle two show what it's all about without compromising the quality! The only problem will be that nobody will believe anything has been modified here - your mods are immaculate!

<dd>&lt;blush&gt; Well, the blue didn't tone in with the yellowish rims - so I retinted the car. Also the resolution of the original image was poor and had been saved with a very high level of JPEG compression - so I had to smooth out the paint quite a lot so we could blow it up to a reasonable size. I juiced up the chrome a little too. Actually adding the highlights to turn the spokes on the hubcaps into stars was the easy part! I left-right mirrored it because people 'buy' highlights better when the light appears to come from above and to the right than they do when it's above and to the left...dunno why that is - it's a subtle perceptual 'kink' in our brains...but it somehow made the faked star look more convincing.</dd>

<dd>I am not sure whether I want a Toyota Barnstar to be our WikiProject Award, but this is just great! I was wondering whether we could find a free high-res pic of a profile shot of a car with a similar rim/wheelcover pattern - it would be an even better base for such an award!

<dd>No - I don't like the Toyota either. We could search wheel photos forever and hack dozens of them into barnstars - but it's not very productive. I personally like the Simca - it's understated. I don't think a modern car fits the bill at all, the wheels are just too boring. Something older is more to my taste - but then I am restoring a 1963 Mini and a 1972 VW Bug - so the Simca is right in the ballpark for my tastes. I looked at things like Model T Ford wheels - you could stick a barnstar into one of those fairly easily - but close-up, it looks like a cart-wheel and it just doesn't scream "CAR!" at you like the Simca wheel does.</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Does it have to be a star? Well, yes and no. Each project (and indeed, anyone who feels like it) can award any damned thing they like to whomever they like for whatever they like...and people do. But the five pointed 'barnstar' is a long-standing Wikipedia tradition and every single award on the <a href="../../../b/a/r/WP%7EBarnstar_8aed.html" title="WP:Barnstar">WP:Barnstar</a> page is a star. Some effort goes into making them look nice and to having them fit into the overall 'theme'. So whilst you - and this project - can award any darned thing it likes - what I would like to see is an automotive barnstar...and that has to be a star.</dd>

Simca 1301s seem, however, to have been getting those standard, and perhaps some 1501s.

Btw, all the pics from Garage de l'Est are now fully available for use in Wikipedia again, I have cleared it out with Mr. Stedehouder and he agrees for everybody to use it for any purpose, which includes us and uploading it to the Commons. An example how to do that with all the appropriate tags and stuff: [:commons:Image:1964 Simca 1500.jpg].

<dd>Well, those photos are certainly more square-on - but they don't have that nice cream-coloured rim (which makes the car look very 1950's) and the hubcaps aren't so shiney. I'll see what I can do with them tonight. I might try sticking one of those wheels into the existing image so it looks like the steering wheel has been turned to make the wheel face the camera.

They just kinda sat there and look like a boring old car wheel. If anyone else can do a good job with them - that would be a good thing.

<h4><span class="mw-headline">One note</span></h4>
<p>Since y'all are developing this award here instead of on the Award Proposal page I just wanted to bring a couple of things to your attention. The consensus on the WikiProject Awards (which this appears to be) is that only things listed on the Barnstar page are called Barnstars. Everything else is called an award or a star. Just an FYI. If you're making a topical barnstar for automotive related issues, I would suggest moving this debate to the proposal page. Finally, most of the awards listed on the two aformentioned pages tend to focus on the star image. --<a href="../../../e/v/r/User%7EEvrik_3a44.html" title="User:Evrik">evrik</a> 02:41, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, so does Steve's "Simca Barnstar". Some of the Project "stars" (actually only one of the project awards is not called a star, and some are still called Barnstars) look like travestations (travesties?) of the original barnstars, but some simply incorporate the star theme in this way or another, like the Military history WikiProject Award or Indigenous American Star. I think Steve's design is right on spot with regard to that. That said, if we aren't supposed to call it a "barnstar", I believe it could be even more appropriately referred to as <b>"Silver Wheelcover"</b>!

<dd>I started the discussion over on the barnstar page - and was told to move the discussion here! My impression is that a discussion of which image we want should happen here first - and when we have consensus, it should go over to the Barnstar talk page to get a final "OK" from the community at large. Now, as to whether the star images we've been looking at "count" as barnstars is a different matter. Most of the barnstars in current use are pretty much square-on obvious images of the barnstar - but the railroad proposal isn't. It's much more subtle...and a vast majority of people here like that. So the idea of having the classic barnstar appearing embedded into another image is an up-coming thing. Should we <i>call</i> that a barnstar? Hell yes! We've gone to a lot of trouble to incorporate the classic star image into our award. Life would have been a lot easier if I hadn't had to do that! The fact that it's recognisably a barnstar - to people <i><b>outside</b></i> of the automotive group - is very important to me - and the fact that it will ultimately appear in the list of standard awards on the barnstar page is also very important. Whether the participants at the barnstar talk page will agree is unknown (although they seem to like the railroad star and nobody complained about my chrome wheel star). However, I'm 100% sure that this group doesn't want something as boring as "The standard brown star with a car stuck in front of it". So - let's let the process work itself out. Let's come to a consensus here - then move it to barnstar talk - and get a vote on it there. If we fail at either of those stages, we'll find some more images and go around again. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteveBaker_6942.html" title="User:SteveBaker">SteveBaker</a> 17:04, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>So...it's all gone quiet. No more contributions for an Automotive Barnstar? Should we move to a vote? <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteveBaker_6942.html" title="User:SteveBaker">SteveBaker</a> 01:29, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I like the key and the third of the tire photos, as well. The chrome Barnstar looks interesting... could you do a version that makes it "transparent"? (Meaning clearing the "spaces" between the circle and the spokes of the star) and give it a shadow&#160;: ) - <a href="../../../j/c/3/User%7EJc37_cfd0.html" title="User:Jc37">Jc37</a> 15:20, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I did try removing the black areas between the spokes - but it somehow didn't look like a car wheel afterwards. It looked more like a 'Sheriff' badge from an old-style cowboy movie. I like the third of the 'tire' photos too. Sadly, the impetus has gone out of the discussion. We really need some more artists to participate. Once I find something I really like, I find it hard to get the energy to make anything else! <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteveBaker_6942.html" title="User:SteveBaker">SteveBaker</a> 16:44, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Subsequent comments should be made in a new section. Why did you remove the Automobile barnstar? I believe I followed all the instructions for creating such a thing. If I messed up, it can only be because the rules are pretty vague.</p>
<p>There was 100% agreement about the need for such a thing - not one person objected (either on the barnstar page or on the automotive page) - the image we selected was the one we all wanted - again, we had almost 100% agreement. It doesn't appear to violate any guidelines. Your edit comment says to look in the discussion page - but there is no mention of the reason you removed it. Please respond or I shall assume you made a mistake and go ahead and reinstate it. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteveBaker_6942.html" title="User:SteveBaker">SteveBaker</a> 03:42, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I removed the Automotive Award from the topical Barnstar page because I think it was placed there prematurely. There has generally been a different set of standards for WikiProject Awards than for barnstars. I made a couple of comments on the proposal page earlier about the difference between a WikiProject Award and a Barnstar. I will note that the majority of the development of the Award was done at the WikiProject Automoblie pages - which is fine for that type of award. Since the barnstar pages have been devloped there has been a clear move to limit the number of barnstars, or to enable poeple to create awards that fit their needs.</p>
<p><a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteveBaker_6942.html" title="User:SteveBaker">SteveBaker</a>, if you want to propose a barnstar, then you have to do it here, and it has to be vetted by the community. The process may be vague and unevenly applied, but there are some loose standards. I hope that explaisn my actions. --<a href="../../../e/v/r/User%7EEvrik_3a44.html" title="User:Evrik">evrik</a> 17:58, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I think the award should be changed back to its original proposal. Yes, I know it has been highly supported by other Wikipedians and by the WikiProject, but.. doesn't anyone see how unfit it looks on <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_awards_59f5.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject awards">WikiProject awards page</a>? It completely ruins the quality of the page. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichaelas10_bbb3.html" title="User:Michaelas10">Michaelas10</a> 17:44, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>What purpoise are you referring to? We tried to make it clear from the beginning that it was a WikiProject Award ... and not a barnstar. --<a href="../../../e/v/r/User%7EEvrik_3a44.html" title="User:Evrik">evrik</a> 18:03, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>The original propose was the wheel shaped silver star. I understand its not a barnstar but it doesn't fit as a WikiProject award, mostly because all the other awards have a direct view of the star and a good quality, attractive designing. If this award will not be changed, it should at least be moved to the PUA page. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichaelas10_bbb3.html" title="User:Michaelas10">Michaelas10</a> 18:31, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
