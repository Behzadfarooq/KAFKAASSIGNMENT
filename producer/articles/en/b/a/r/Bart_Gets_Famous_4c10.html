<p><a href="../../../b/a/r/Bart_Simpson_19e2.html" title="Bart Simpson">Bart</a> goes on a class field trip to the <a href="../../../b/o/x/Box.html" title="Box">box</a> factory. However on the tour of the box factory Bart gets bored and escapes from the class to go to the Channel 6 TV studio nearby where he wanders by a beach scene and <a href="../../../b/u/m/Bumblebee_Man_eecc.html" title="Bumblebee Man">Bumblebee Man</a>. With his absence, <a href="../../../s/e/y/Seymour_Skinner_4313.html" title="Seymour Skinner">Skinner</a> calls Homer who arrives, thinking that Bart was killed in one of the box-making machines.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Bart meets up with <a href="../../../k/r/u/Krusty.html" title="Krusty">Krusty</a> who is angry that he doesn't have his <a href="../../../d/a/n/Danish_pastry.html" title="Danish pastry">Danish</a>. Because of this, Bart steals a Danish from <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kent_Brockman_1e8d.html" title="Kent Brockman">Kent Brockman</a> and gives it to Krusty who becomes grateful and asks him to become his assistant (though he forgets all the other times Bart has helped him out, from saving his career to renewing Krusty's relations with his father). When Bart returns home, Homer is relieved that he doesn't have to tell Marge that Bart was killed in a box accident. Afterwards, Bart continues his work as Krusty's assistant, though soon he gets tired in that the cast members don't treat him well and he doesn't get credited for his work of helping the show. However, before Bart decides to quit Krusty offers him to say one line in a sketch. Bart messes up his lines and destroys all of the props on the stage and when the crowd's focus comes on him, he tries to get out of it, saying, "I didn't do it", which causes the audience to laugh and applaud. Seeing this, Krusty immediately uses Bart and his "I didn't do it" catch phrase in later sketches and eventually creates a franchise out of Bart such as the "I didn't do it" music video.</p>
<p>As Bart continues with his "I didn't do it" catch phrase, he begins to fear that the fad will eventually wear off so he tries to act intelligent (as during his interview on <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conan_O%27Brien_99b0.html" title="Conan O'Brien">Conan O'Brien</a>'s show). Even so, eventually Bart's catch phrase loses its humor and Bart loses his fame.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/r/Bart_Gets_Famous_4c10.html" title="Edit section: Trivia/Goofs">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Trivia/Goofs</span></h2>
<ul>
<li>The song that Bart whistles and Marge finds annoying is actually the Simpsons theme.</li>
<li><a href="../../../k/r/u/Krusty.html" title="Krusty">Krusty</a> used the catchphrase "I didn't do it" at least twice in the first season episode "<a href="../../../k/r/u/Krusty_Gets_Busted_ce34.html" title="Krusty Gets Busted">Krusty Gets Busted</a>".</li>
<li>This episode was shown on the UK's <a href="../../../c/h/a/Channel_4.html" title="Channel 4">Channel 4</a> shortly after the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004_Indian_Ocean_tsunami_cfe3.html" title="2004 Indian Ocean tsunami">2004 Indian Ocean tsunami</a>. As a result, the references to a <a href="../../../t/i/d/Tidal_wave.html" title="Tidal wave">tidal wave</a> from Kent Brockman and Bumblebee man were cut out. As of January 2007, these lines are still omitted from airings of this episode. Because of this, Bumblebee Man is seen to take the news script off Kent Brockman, then fall straight over without saying anything.</li>
<li>In Bart's imagination, of himself as a future celebrity panelist on "<a href="../../../m/a/t/Match_Game_308e.html" title="Match Game">Match Game</a> 2034", one of the other panelists is the "lovely and vivacious" head of <a href="../../../k/i/t/Kitty_Carlisle_86b6.html" title="Kitty Carlisle">Kitty Carlisle</a>, which was located in a glass jar filled with water. This may have served as a basis for <a href="../../../f/u/t/Futurama.html" title="Futurama">Futurama</a>'s similar use of heads kept alive in jars, though the show takes place almost a millennium after Bart's dream occurred.</li>
<li>This is the last episode in <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Simpsons_DVD_boxsets_45e4.html" title="The Simpsons DVD boxsets">The Simpsons DVD boxsets</a> to not include a chapter break at an act break. All subsequent episodes released on DVD have a break after the opening, between each act, and before the credits.</li>
<li>When Krusty opened the door so he and Bart could leave, his glove was clearly shown. When he claimed to own Bart and grabbed him, he was wearing no gloves.</li>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/r/Bart_Gets_Famous_4c10.html" title="Edit section: Cultural references">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Cultural references</span></h2>
<ul>
<li>Bart getting famous for one phrase might be a reference to 1930s comedian <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joe_Penner_dafe.html" title="Joe Penner">Joe Penner</a> whose major claim to fame was his phrase "Wanna buy a duck?".</li>
<li>The idea of Bart becoming famous by ducking out of a school trip into a studio is possibly a reference to Stephen Spielberg's early life. He once ducked out of a school bus, and found a back door into Universal Studios.</li>
<li>The writing on the blackboard is a reference to <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Fugitive_%28TV_series%29_92a0.html" title="The Fugitive (TV series)">The Fugitive</a></i>.</li>
<li>Bart's line "Jawohl, mein Mommandant" is similar to Sergeant Schultz's line to Colonel Klink: "Jawohl, mein Kommandant" from <i><a href="../../../h/o/g/Hogan%27s_Heroes_7d21.html" title="Hogan's Heroes">Hogan's Heroes</a></i>.</li>
<li>Krusty with a candlestick in the conservatory is a reference to the board game "<a href="../../../c/l/u/Cluedo.html" title="Cluedo">Cluedo</a>" (<a href="../../../c/l/u/Clue.html" title="Clue">Clue</a> in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>).</li>
<li>Krusty's line "Hey kid!" is a parody of <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joe_Greene_%28football_player%29_20b7.html" title="Joe Greene (football player)">"Mean" Joe Greene</a>'s line from the <a href="../../../c/o/c/Coca-Cola_916a.html" title="Coca-Cola">Coke</a> <a href="../../../t/e/l/Television_commercial.html" title="Television commercial">television commercial</a>, which was recently voted the best commercial in <a href="../../../s/u/p/Super_Bowl_21ed.html" title="Super Bowl">Super Bowl</a> history.</li>
<li>The set of "<a href="../../../m/a/t/Match_Game_308e.html" title="Match Game">Match Game</a> 2034" makes a reference to the <i><a href="../../../j/e/t/Jetsons.html" title="Jetsons">Jetsons</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../m/a/t/Match_Game_308e.html" title="Match Game">Match Game</a></i>.</li>
<li>The musical cue is a parody of the <i><a href="../../../b/a/t/Batman.html" title="Batman">Batman</a></i> television series.</li>
<li>Bart raps to <a href="../../../r/i/c/Rick_James_84a9.html" title="Rick James">Rick James</a>' "Superfreak"/<a href="../../../m/c/_/MC_Hammer_c2ad.html" title="MC Hammer">MC Hammer</a>'s "U Can't Touch This".</li>
<li>Bart's album cover looks similar to the <a href="../../../k/r/i/Kris_Kross_d949.html" title="Kris Kross">Kris Kross</a> rap duo.</li>
<li>Homer compares Bart to another child star, the character <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steve_Urkel_341c.html" title="Steve Urkel">Steve Urkel</a>, who gained his own show after a single appearance in the sitcom <i><a href="../../../f/a/m/Family_Matters_da6e.html" title="Family Matters">Family Matters</a></i>.</li>
<li>In the beginning of the episode, Bart hums the Simpsons theme, then Marge tells him to stop whistling that annoying tune. This is a reference to <a href="../../../t/v/_/TV_Guide_969f.html" title="TV Guide">TV Guide</a> saying the Simpsons theme was one of the most annoying themes ever.</li>
<li>Bart does <i><a href="../../../l/a/t/Late_Night_with_Conan_O%27Brien_2fed.html" title="Late Night with Conan O'Brien">Late Night with Conan O'Brien</a></i> after he becomes famous. Conan was part of the writing staff before he got his talk show, was written into the show just before he got the job because it wasn't 100% if Conan would get the Late Night spot or not.</li>
<li>Cast members on Bart's imagining of "<a href="../../../m/a/t/Match_Game_308e.html" title="Match Game">Match Game</a> 2034" include himself (As "The I Didn't Do It Boy"), <a href="../../../b/i/l/Billy_Crystal_aaeb.html" title="Billy Crystal">Billy Crystal</a>, <a href="../../../f/a/r/Farrah_Fawcet_ab0f.html" title="Farrah Fawcet">Farrah Fawcet-Majors-O'Neal-Varney</a> (A reference to her marriages to <a href="../../../l/e/e/Lee_Majors_df70.html" title="Lee Majors">Lee Majors</a> and <a href="../../../r/y/a/Ryan_O%27Neal_0014.html" title="Ryan O'Neal">Ryan O'Neal</a>, and a supposed union with <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jim_Varney_8274.html" title="Jim Varney">Jim Varney</a>), "<a href="../../../v/e/n/Ventriloquist.html" title="Ventriloquist">ventriloquist</a>" <a href="../../../l/o/n/Loni_Anderson_3caa.html" title="Loni Anderson">Loni Anderson</a>, <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spike_Lee_91fb.html" title="Spike Lee">Spike Lee</a>, and the head of <a href="../../../k/i/t/Kitty_Carlisle_86b6.html" title="Kitty Carlisle">Kitty Carlisle</a>.</li>
