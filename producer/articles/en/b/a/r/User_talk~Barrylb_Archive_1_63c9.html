<p>Hi Barry,</p>
<p>Yet another piece on your talk page about a BB Aus external link. I'm writing about the eyeonbigbrother.com link that you removed. I understand that you adhere to the How not to be a spammer page, but I think this site is worthy for inclusion on the basis that it is infact an anti-fan site, covering the criticisms of the show in more detail than can be placed in the Wikipedia article. For users coming to Wikipedia after criticism of BB (which, based on the reaction of the website in question, is a valid hypothesis) they will surely find the website informative and useful. Yes, it is a new website, in the sense that it coincided with the beginning of the series this year, however I would like to point out that</p>
<p>a) The website is completely non-profit and information based: There are no advertisments on the website at all, and users are *not* given the option to sign up. Therefore the emphasis on the website are the articles themselves.</p>
<p>b) In the last 2 days, the website has received over 800 unique visits, and several articulate emails stating the usefulness of the website (can be found on the Your Say area)</p>
<p>I noticed further down on this talk page you stated "If your site is worthy of adding to Wikipedia, then someone else will add it" -- which was not the case with WikiDave. That's fine, but please keep that in mind if you choose to respond to this with the same point. For the record, I am not the webmaster of this website. It belongs to a friend of mine, who writes all of the content. This is more than I can say for WikiDave who has a direct role in the fansite Behind Big Brother and its content, surely violating the How not to be a spammer guidelines, or at best giving precedence to allow for the inclusion to the link to the Eye on Big Brother website.</p>
<p>Of course, it is inevitable that inclusion as an external link will result in promotion for the website, just as it does for the Behind Big Brother website that is there now. However I am arguing for it's inclusion by suggesting that Wikipedia should strive to provide its users with a balanced 'argument', and not link to fan only websites and the link pages that house them. The Eye On Big Brother link would reflect the section of the article entitiled "Criticisms", and give users interested in those criticisms to read further and expand thier knowledge. It would also make the article more balanced, as the website is indeed unique and different to the others that have requested inclusion on this page. I'd appreciate you giving thought to these points.</p>
<p>Thanks for your time. Dust77 07:05, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Hi Barry, I'd appreciate a response to this. I posted it on your talk page because I respect your decision, however if there is to be no response perhaps the discussion page on the article in question is more appropriate. Dust77 08:59, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I don't believe your site should be included on the external links. We already have a link to the major fansite as per the external link guidelines. -- <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarrylb_eb29.html" title="User:Barrylb">Barrylb</a> 10:04, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Sorry last night at 2 in the morning in a dream i added to the <a href="../../../g/u/n/Gunns_Limited_e3f6.html" title="Gunns Limited">Gunns Limited</a> article and added that "and this will create a positive ... (blah) to the economy" it was meant to be "Gunns claims this will help the local economy" or along those lines. I realise it sounds bad, almost as though it was advertising to the <a href="../../../p/u/l/Pulp_mill.html" title="Pulp mill">pulp mill</a> proposal.

<p>Hi Barry,</p>
<p>I was wondering if you could please refrain from removing the link (www.insidebigbrother.com) from the <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Brother_%28Australian_TV_series%29_92e7.html" title="Big Brother (Australian TV series)">Big Brother (Australian TV series)</a> page.</p>
<p>I understand that you do not think that it should appear on the page, but I have just started helping with the insidebigbrother website and would like it listed on this wikipedia page for everyone to enjoy. The content on insidebigbrother relates entirely to Big Brother, so there is no reason why it should not be able to be listed. I could understand if the site had nothing to do with Big Brother, but this is not the case.</p>
<p>Wikipedia is all about free speech and free content.</p>
<p>We are hoping that people will enjoy the insidebigbrother.com website throughout 2006, so we would appreciate it if you could please leave the hyperlink on the <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Brother_%28Australian_TV_series%29_92e7.html" title="Big Brother (Australian TV series)">Big Brother (Australian TV series)</a> page.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance,</p>

<p>Damien, I'm sorry but I cannot agree. Although your site relates to Big Brother, Wikipedia is not for promoting new websites or for self-promotion. If your site is worthy of adding to Wikipedia, then someone else will add it.</p>
<p>See this link <a href="../../../s/p/a/Wikipedia%7ESpam_35ea.html#How_not_to_be_a_spammer" title="Wikipedia:Spam">Wikipedia:Spam#How not to be a spammer</a> where it says:</p>

<p>Hi Barry,</p>
<p>Please visit the website www.insidebigbrother.com. You will find that the website does offer unique content. The website is a fan site of the big brother television program, yet the website keeps getting removed from the big brother Australia links page.</p>
<p>I believe the link should remain on the Australian Big Brother wiki page, as it does offer unique content and unique services (such as the Inside Big Brother Tipping Competition which will start once again when big brother 2006 airs - other websites do not offer such a service).</p>
<p>It is disappointing to see this website constantly being removed whilst other fan sites stay - I can not see a valid reason for this. If the website is to be removed again, please offer a valid explanation. A link is not for promotion, but to offer the content and services of the website to the public.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Dave.</p>

<dd>It is something I would accept. I really would like to determine if this is one of those "extreme" cases the guideline refers to. I don't like the idea of being forced it into a directory because someone isn't happy we haven't linked to their site. I think the major-fansite link is really useful as it is. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarrylb_eb29.html" title="User:Barrylb">Barrylb</a> 12:45, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, can you review the compromise <i>Have a link to BBB and a link to a directory</i> and add your opinion. Thanks&#160;:) I realise that you don't want to be forced into it, but I think it might be a valid move as the guy points out, if someone comes in future and tries to linkspam you can revert with impunity as there is already a link to the directory. Unfortunately I haven't found any references for how to define extreme, but maybe the fact that this is in dispute mediation could make it extreme&#160;;) Anyway, I'd be glad to hear your opinion.

<p>Dear Barry,</p>
<p>I am writing in response to the removal of australianfauna.com from "Fauna of Australia" page on wikipedia.</p>
<p>Australian Fauna (.com) has been running for over two years now - this website does not fall under the category of spam. Please take some time to view the website, and if required please check that it is listed in dmoz, google directory, links from government departments, etc.</p>
<p>If you are still unhappy and wish to label the website as "spam", then I would request that a third party be involved to check over this - as I believe you will find that it is not spam and in fact a leader in its area. It has been referenced in printed material like council newsletters and schools, and images that I own I have released freely to magazines with readerships of over 200,000. It is a not for profit website - however it receives revenue from Google Adsense, which covers the cost of web hosting - and any remainder is donated to WWF Australia. Is this why you considered the website to be spam?</p>
<p>You can e-mail me at samschmidtusa@hotmail.com if you want to discuss this further.</p>
<p>I would really like to know why you have classed the website as spam - it is something I do not want the website to be associated with - and something that I would like to fix as soon as possible!!!</p>
<p>Thankyou and Kind Regards,</p>
<p>Sam.</p>

This isn't a War Monkeyman. It's called debate or discussion, the only democratic means available here. "Vote" and "majority rule" on the other hand do not. Live with the fact that people that have interest in Wikipedia and are willing to sacrifice their spare time to contribute in areas of their expertise will not always agree with your view on things and will question your actions and point of view.</p>
<p>I have no clue about Biology and would not touch any Article there and delete stuff. I don't have the ability to argue with Biology experts, PhD’s, professors about good or bad content, because I don't know anything about it. I don't know which sites are good and important and why and which are not. I can not just make a decision based on "gut feeling" and if I like the colors of a site or not.</p>
<p>I will stick around. Live with it. I am always willing to discuss things on a professional level (we outgrew kindergarten). And because we are adults, it should be possible for us to solve our problems like adults. You know where to fine me. You are always welcome there. --<a href="../../../c/u/m/User%7ECumbrowski_fe91.html" title="User:Cumbrowski">Roy-SAC</a> 19:58, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I think it's a good thing you are vigilant against linkspam. But you should realize that not all links are spam. The sites I quote (especially www.whyq uit.com - this is a small encyclopedia in its own right) are excellent information for people wanting to know more, they also serve as references for the article.</p>
<p>It would be nice if you state your problems against them, then we can discuss. But in the mean time, please refrain from removing them from the <a href="../../../s/m/o/Smoking_cessation.html" title="Smoking cessation">article</a>.</p>

<dd>There are many quit-smoking sites on the internet. This one is not particular better than any other - it is a website of one particular individual and is biased towards particular views on quitting. It is not particular authoritative. I can't see any reason why this particular site deserves to be linked. I also cannot see why you would have any reason to keep the other 'quit meter' sites that are obvious link spam. -- <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarrylb_eb29.html" title="User:Barrylb">Barrylb</a> 22:18, 6 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>While indeed I do not care whether the quit meters stay or go, I do care so about whyquit. You might want to review the site, it is a good site to keep linked; easily better than most other quit sites out there. It also is not just an individual, it has organisation and community. And, maybe the best argument for keeping it in, it serves as a link out for people wanting to know more about cold turkey (cf. the modalities paragraph).</dd>

<dd>Please see this page: <a href="http://www.healthyplace.com/advertise/sponsors.asp" class="external free" title="http://www.healthyplace.com/advertise/sponsors.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.healthyplace.com/advertise/sponsors.asp</a>. The page plainly tells me that this is a site setup to benefit pharmaceutical companies. Thus I think that classifies the site as a "commercial link". As a direct consequence of that, another problem is that the information on the site is highly likely to be biased towards the products and services offer by the sponsors. And I did not know until Monkeyman pointed out here that the site was spammed onto multiple articles in January, which troubles me greatly.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Further, the "blanking" you are referring to is not a "thing" against the pharmaceutical industry. I removed the links (and I think only healthyplace.com is pharma related) because I don't believe we should have any links on that article. It is such a vague topic that it is hard to know what types of links should be there, and it is a magnet for all kinds of rubbish. Not every article needs links. I am not too bothered by that though, and my main concern is healthyplace.com -- <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarrylb_eb29.html" title="User:Barrylb">Barrylb</a> 02:44, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There are a few 'red flags' about healthyplace.com:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>According to <a href="http://www.geobytes.com/IpLocator.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.geobytes.com/IpLocator.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.geobytes.com/IpLocator.htm</a> the IP address that added links to healthyplace.com (67.9.115.64) is located in San Antonio, Texas. Entering www.healthyplace.com into the locator service reveals that is also located in the same city. This is a possible indicator that someone closely affiliated with the site has tried to promote it.</li>
<li>Their 'Contact us' page is merely a direct link to an email address info@healthyplace.com. There is no phone number to call, no fax number and no physical address or mailing address. Why not?</li>
<li>A WHOIS check on the domain name reveals only a PO Box address in San Antonio and an invalid phone/fax number 999 999 99999.</li>
<li>At <a href="http://www.healthyplace.com/site/editorial_policy.asp" class="external free" title="http://www.healthyplace.com/site/editorial_policy.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.healthyplace.com/site/editorial_policy.asp</a> it says "HealthyPlace.com, Inc. is a private corporation..." &amp; "funding for the HealthyPlace.com Site comes from private individual investors" &amp; "We do sell advertising to outside companies and organizations". So, why have they established this site? It appears to be a commercial profit-seeking enterprise that seeks advertising to make money. There are usually two or three advertising banners on every page.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>Do we really want to link to a site that was primarily set up to sell advertising? They have no interest in health issues, only making money. To use them as a reference or as somewhere to send people for further information or help seems inappropriate. Surely there are some better sites such as well-established non-profit organisations or government sites that don't have the conflict-of-interest problems of healthyplace.com and may have a real interest in health issues. We can do better.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>"Do we really want to link to a site that was primarily set up to sell advertising?" If the content is otherwise acceptable then the answer is <i>yes</i>. Because that is the business model of just about every newspaper in America and we don't just accept them as external links, we accept them as <i>references</i>. The New York Times is not funded by its subscriptions; it is funded by advertisers who trust that the ads they pay the NYT to run will be seen by a large number of readers who have come to read the content. "They have no interest in health issues, only making money." I'm sorry, but your prejudice against 'the pharma industry' is not a point of policy. "Surely there are some better sites such as well-established non-profit organisations or government sites that don't have the conflict-of-interest problems of healthyplace.com and may have a real interest in health issues." Hmmmm, let's see, like the <a href="http://www.samhsa.gov/" class="external text" title="http://www.samhsa.gov/" rel="nofollow">Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration</a>? Obviously not, since you removed that link too. As for the "conflict-of-interest problems of healthyplace.com", please explain to me how an article which <i>does not mention pharmaceuticals in any way</i>, appearing on a site sponsored by 'the pharma industry', represents a "conflict-of-interest". Clearly, it doesn't; it represents instead your own private prejudice against the pharmaceutical industry, one that you also show with your phrasing that another site "may have a real interest in health issues." If you have <i>evidence</i> that healthyplace.com <i>does not</i> have a "real" interest in health issues, then show that proof in order to get a consensus. If you do not have evidence then what you have instead is prejudice, and prejudice may not be substituted at your discretion for policy. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 16:52, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have already given evidence as to why healthyplace.com does not have a real interest in health issues. Read my comments again. Your comparison to newspapers is not valid because newspapers - especially ones like NYT - have established credibility and they have accountibility (editors, journalistic standards, professional ethics, industry organisations, and laws to abide, and even a phone number to call them) and they have something called editorial independence. Healthyplace.com is not likely accountable to anyone. I also question Healthyplace's editorial independence. I believe the content on their site is closely linked to advertisers. Look at their <a href="http://www.healthyplace.com/advertise/sponsor_opportunities.asp" class="external text" title="http://www.healthyplace.com/advertise/sponsor_opportunities.asp" rel="nofollow">sponsorship opportunities</a> page at it looks like they are very willing to do whatever you want. Look at <a href="http://www.healthyplace.com/communities/depression/serious/index.asp" class="external free" title="http://www.healthyplace.com/communities/depression/serious/index.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.healthyplace.com/communities/depression/serious/index.asp</a>. It says 'funding provided by Wyeth'. So basically they have placed editorial content because an advertiser wanted to. My problem here is not with pharmaceutical companies, it is with healthyplace.com's credibility and that they appear to be open to do whatever their advertiers want them to do. My edit summaries regarding 'healthyplace.com is pharma industry sponsored - removed' were a shorthand way of saying all that I have said here.</dd>
<dd>And lastly, your reference to me removing a link to samhsa.gov is quoted out of context. I removed the entire set of links of the Mental health article because it was a complete mess. -- <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarrylb_eb29.html" title="User:Barrylb">Barrylb</a> 00:37, 8 March 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Actually, what it says is "<b>This content was created by HealthyPlace.com under its sole editorial control.</b> Funding was provided by Wyeth." <i>(emphasis added)</i> So, basically, you didn't just read the sentence "Funding was provided by Wyeth" and leap to the conclusion "oh, they must be a bunch of whores who'll say anything for the right price", you actually read <i>two</i> sentences, one of which directly contradicted the conclusion you wanted to leap to, and surpressed that one, asserting 'Oh, well, clearly because <i>they receive funding</i> they must be placing their editorial control in the hands of their advertisers!' and trying to present this as a <i>reasonable deduction</i> from what you can read at that page instead of a <i>direct contradiction</i> of it. Look, if your personal prejudice is that the big bad pharma industry is a crawling corruption twisting everything it touches and everything said by them or by anyone who has accepted a taint on their soul by accepting their sponsorship should be assumed to be a bald-faced lie even when it has nothing to do with pharmaceuticals -- fine, that's great, hold that as your opinion.

<p>I admit that I missed that there was an existing sentence in the Panrea Bread article that mentions wireless, however the fact that the restaurant is the leading free WiFi provider in the US is quite notable so merging my additions with the existing sentence in the article would have been more appropriate than reverting my work.

<dl>
<dd>This is most certainly notable and should be included in the article. The fact that such a large national chain offers this service is unique and it exemplified by the fact that they are the largest such provider. It is also notable because until the article was published, the common conception was that the largest free wireless provider was some sort of ISP or wireless company, but instead it is a restaurant chain. I'm not sure how this sounds like advertising, it is stating facts that make the company unique and notable. That is the point of wikipedia. To see further discussion on this topic, to show its worthiness, look at <a href="http://hardware.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/02/17/1915204" class="external text" title="http://hardware.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/02/17/1915204" rel="nofollow">this</a> large slashdot discussion on the topic. If you want to rephrase the sentence go right ahead but removing it is not the correct action, I will be reverting back to my edit. I'll even rephrase it for you, but again, please don't revert it as that would be detremental to the completeness of the article. <a href="../../../d/s/e/User%7EDsemaya_4519.html" title="User:Dsemaya">dsemaya</a> 04:41, 8 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Could we still delete <a href="../../../b/i/p/Bipolar_disorder_support_groups.html" title="Bipolar disorder support groups">Bipolar disorder support groups</a>? Someone has merged the content and redirected it to <a href="../../../b/i/p/Bipolar_disorder.html" title="Bipolar disorder">Bipolar disorder</a> but I don't think we need it at all. -- <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarrylb_eb29.html" title="User:Barrylb">Barrylb</a> 01:25, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hello, <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarrylb_eb29.html" title="User:Barrylb">Barrylb</a>. I see that you've unmerged the list from <a href="../../../b/i/p/Bipolar_disorder.html" title="Bipolar disorder">Bipolar disorder</a> and moved it to the talk page. Content-wise, I'll let you and <a href="../../../i/a/p/User%7EIapetus_ba08.html" title="User:Iapetus">User:Iapetus</a>, who did the merging earlier, decide what to do with the list. I think I'll let <a href="../../../b/i/p/Bipolar_disorder_support_groups.html" title="Bipolar disorder support groups">Bipolar disorder support groups</a> stay as a redirect. This way, <a href="../../../b/i/p/Talk%7EBipolar_disorder_support_groups_f97f.html" title="Talk:Bipolar disorder support groups">Talk:Bipolar disorder support groups</a> get to stay as well. In case someone re-creates a similar list, you can quickly point to this talkpage and say that we've talked about this already and we don't want such a list. Okay&#160;? Thanks for reminding me on this issue. -- <a href="../../../p/f/h/User%7EPFHLai_0319.html" title="User:PFHLai">PFHLai</a> 06:23, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, User:ThomasTechnologies has just added himself to WikiProject Spam but wants to add links to his site at <a href="../../../t/a/r/Target_%28Australia%29_4876.html" title="Target (Australia)">Target (Australia)</a>, <a href="../../../t/a/r/Target_Corporation_8dc1.html" title="Target Corporation">Target Corporation</a> and <a href="../../../s/c/r/Scrip.html" title="Scrip">Scrip</a>. Perhaps you could add some comments to <a href="../../../t/a/r/Talk%7ETarget_%28Australia%29_27c4.html" title="Talk:Target (Australia)">Talk:Target (Australia)</a> if you agree with my decision? I don't think he has got the idea yet. Thanks -- <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarrylb_eb29.html" title="User:Barrylb">Barrylb</a> 06:49, 31 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree with you ... sorry I wasn't around sooner but fortunately his additions appear to have ended. His link addition isn't spam but it really doesn't add any content to the article. A collection of gift card images? I don't get it. How does this contribute to the article? Will keep an eye out. <a href="../../../m/o/n/Image%7EMonkeyman.png_bb1e.html" class="image" title="Image:Monkeyman.png"><img src="../../../upload/e/ee/Monkeyman.png" alt="Image:Monkeyman.png" width="20" height="20" longdesc="../../../m/o/n/Image%7EMonkeyman.png_bb1e.html" /></a><a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonkeyman_4f4d.html" title="User:Monkeyman">Monkeyman</a><sup>(<a href="../../../m/o/n/User_talk%7EMonkeyman_fda3.html" title="User talk:Monkeyman">talk</a>)</sup> 04:35, 1 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello</p>
<p>For some reason you felt it right to discredit MyIdolSpace.com without merit</p>
<p>The growing problem of fraud on MySpace is huge, and we have made significant progress curbing the fraud of all American Idol contestants.</p>
<p>The only people listed on MyIdolSpace.com are confirmed official and authorized pages.</p>
<p>You may contact any of us here: <a href="http://www.myspace.com/myidolspace" class="external free" title="http://www.myspace.com/myidolspace" rel="nofollow">http://www.myspace.com/myidolspace</a></p>
<p>We have every right to be on Wiki for the efforts we have put forth, and this is not a discussion.</p>
<p>Thank you very much for your attention, and leaving our contribution alone.</p>

<p>Hi Barry, I am looking for Wikipedians that are interested in the topic about Link Spam to express their opinion about this. After checking some other Talk Pages and Votes I think you seem to be one of them&#160;:)</p>
<p>Talk at at WikiProject:Spam Talk Page: <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Spam_459e.html#How_to_save_hundreds_or_thousands_of_hours_by_spending_just_a_few" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Spam"><b>How to save hundreds or thousands of hours by spending just a few</b></a></p>

Thank you very much. I am looking forward to hear your opinion on it and hopefully also some facts about the primary means and the extend of the link spam problem which I am still looking for. Something that can be meassured/quantified , estimated and afterwards validated and evaluated. --<a href="../../../c/u/m/User%7ECumbrowski_fe91.html" title="User:Cumbrowski"><b>roy</b></a>&lt;sac&gt; <a href="../../../c/u/m/User_talk%7ECumbrowski_c6d0.html" title="User talk:Cumbrowski"><font color="red"><b><sup>Talk!</sup></b></font></a> .oOo. 06:14, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
