<p>Sanders was born in <a href="../../../w/i/c/Wichita%2C_Kansas_34cc.html" title="Wichita, Kansas">Wichita</a>, <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kansas.html" title="Kansas">Kansas</a>. Recruited as a kick returner, Sanders spent his first two years at <a href="../../../o/k/l/Oklahoma_State_University_-_Stillwater_1678.html" title="Oklahoma State University - Stillwater">Oklahoma State University</a> as a backup for All-American Running Back <a href="../../../t/h/u/Thurman_Thomas_a2e7.html" title="Thurman Thomas">Thurman Thomas</a>. He called it a "great experience". "I could study the great approach to the game that Thomas had." In his junior year, Sanders went on to lead the nation in rushing yards (2,628), total yards (3,250), touchdowns (39) and scoring (234 points) en route to winning the 1988 <a href="../../../h/e/i/Heisman_Trophy_cdcb.html" title="Heisman Trophy">Heisman Trophy</a>. His rushing yards and touchdowns in that year still stand (quite easily) as <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Collegiate_Athletic_Association_2404.html" title="National Collegiate Athletic Association">NCAA</a> single season records in <a href="../../../d/i/v/Division_I-A_90bf.html" title="Division I-A">Division I-A</a>. He capped off his junior year at Oklahoma State with a 62-14 victory over Wyoming in the <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holiday_Bowl_0ac9.html" title="Holiday Bowl">Holiday Bowl</a>. Rather than try to set more records as a senior, Sanders declared himself eligible for the <a href="../../../n/f/l/NFL_draft_e007.html" title="NFL draft">NFL draft</a> and left OSU as the team's all time leading scorer with 330 points (55 touchdowns). In 2004, Sanders was enshrined in the <a href="../../../c/o/l/College_Football_Hall_of_Fame_85e4.html" title="College Football Hall of Fame">College Football Hall of Fame</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/r/Barry_Sanders_2242.html" title="Edit section: Professional career">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Professional career</span></h2>
<p>The <a href="../../../d/e/t/Detroit_Lions_6dd4.html" title="Detroit Lions">Detroit Lions</a> selected Barry Sanders third overall with their 1st-round pick in the <a href="../../../1/9/8/1989_NFL_Draft_3a53.html" title="1989 NFL Draft">1989 draft</a>. Though again there were concerns about his size it turned out these concerns were mostly unfounded. Sanders was far too quick for defenders to hit solidly on a consistent basis, and too strong to bring down with arm tackles. Though short, Sanders was very stocky; his playing weight of 200 lb (91 kg) was the same as Walter Payton and only slightly under the NFL average for a back. Further, Sanders was able to dazzle onlookers at an <a href="../../../e/s/p/ESPN_7b0e.html" title="ESPN">ESPN</a> <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slam_dunk.html" title="Slam dunk">slam dunk</a> contest by jamming comfortably from a flat footed position demonstrating his other defining characteristic: explosiveness. Combined with his low <a href="../../../c/e/n/Center_of_gravity.html" title="Center of gravity">center of gravity</a>, Also of note was his on-field humility. Despite his flashy playing style, Sanders was rarely seen celebrating after the whistle was blown instead he preferred to hand the ball to a referee or congratulate his teammates. Unlike many of his contemporaries, and similar to the humility of Willie Monty, he never spiked the ball after a touchdown.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/9/1994.html" title="1994">1994</a>, Sanders rushed for an impressive 1,883 yards, on an even more amazing 5.7 yards per carry. But he also totaled 283 recieving yards, which gave him a combined 2,166 yards from scrimmage for the season. This was one of Sanders most impressive feats, and it gave him the NFL's Offensive MVP award. In <a href="../../../1/9/9/1995.html" title="1995">1995</a>, Sanders posted 1,500 yards rushing with 398 receiving yards, barely beating his rushing total alone of the '94 season. In <a href="../../../1/9/9/1996.html" title="1996">1996</a>, Sanders rushed for 1,553 yards with a career-low 147 recieving yards. Sanders greatest season came in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1997.html" title="1997">1997</a> (see below), when he rushed for a career-high 2,053 yards.</p>
<p>In Sanders last season in the NFL, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1998.html" title="1998">1998</a> he rushed for 1,491 yards, breaking the four-year streak of rushing for over 1,500 yards in a season.</p>
<p>Despite his individual success, the Lions never reached the <a href="../../../s/u/p/Super_Bowl_21ed.html" title="Super Bowl">Super Bowl</a> while Sanders played for them. The closest they ever came was in the <a href="../../../1/9/9/1991_NFL_season_bead.html" title="1991 NFL season">1991 season</a>. Aided by Sanders 1,855 combined rushing/receiving yards and 17 touchdowns during the season, they recorded a 12–4 record and went on to defeat the <a href="../../../d/a/l/Dallas_Cowboys_c876.html" title="Dallas Cowboys">Dallas Cowboys</a> 38–6 in the divisional playoffs, the Lions only playoff win since <a href="../../../1/9/5/1957_NFL_season_47c1.html" title="1957 NFL season">1957</a>. However, they were crushed by the <a href="../../../w/a/s/Washington_Redskins_17e9.html" title="Washington Redskins">Washington Redskins</a> 41–10 in the <a href="../../../n/f/c/NFC_Championship_Game_bc6c.html" title="NFC Championship Game">NFC Championship Game</a>, and Sanders was held to just 59 total yards. Detroit made the playoffs 4 more times during Sanders' career, but each time they were eliminated in the first round.</p>
<p>In Sanders spectacular career, although short, he achieved Pro Bowl status in all of his 10 seasons as a pro. Sanders was named All-Pro from <a href="../../../1/9/8/1989.html" title="1989">1989</a>-<a href="../../../1/9/9/1991.html" title="1991">1991</a> and <a href="../../../1/9/9/1993.html" title="1993">1993</a>-<a href="../../../1/9/9/1997.html" title="1997">1997</a> and was named All-Pro second team the '89, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1992.html" title="1992">'92</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1993.html" title="1993">'93</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1996.html" title="1996">'96</a>, and <a href="../../../1/9/9/1998.html" title="1998">'98</a>.

<p>Sanders' greatest season came in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1997_NFL_season_dc0b.html" title="1997 NFL season">1997</a>. After a horrendous start in which he gained only 53 yards on 25 carries in the first two games of the season, Sanders rang off an NFL record 14 consecutive 100 yard games, including two 200 yard performances, en route to rushing for 2,053 yards. In reaching the 2,000 yard plateau, he became only the 3rd player to do so in a single season. He was the first running back to rush for 1,500 yards in five seasons and the only one to do it four consecutive years. At the end of the season, Sanders shared the Associated Press's <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Football_League_Most_Valuable_Player_Award_3e78.html" title="National Football League Most Valuable Player Award">NFL Most Valuable Player Award</a> with <a href="../../../b/r/e/Brett_Favre_652e.html" title="Brett Favre">Brett Favre</a>.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/r/Barry_Sanders_2242.html" title="Edit section: Retirement">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Retirement</span></h3>
<p>On <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_28.html" title="July 28">July 28</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1999.html" title="1999">1999</a>, at the age of 31, Sanders stunned many when he announced his retirement from pro football. He left football healthy and in his prime, having gained 15,269 rushing yards, 2,921 receiving yards, 118 kickoff return yards, and 109 touchdowns (99 rushing and 10 receiving). He retired within a one-season striking distance of Walter Payton's career rushing mark of 16,726 yards. Only Payton and <a href="../../../e/m/m/Emmitt_Smith_5103.html" title="Emmitt Smith">Emmitt Smith</a>, who broke the record in 2002, have rushed for more yards than Sanders. Yet by comparison, Payton amassed his total in 13 seasons, while Smith did so in 15 (and surpassed Payton in his 13th season). However, perhaps Sanders' most impressive statistical achievement was to join <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jim_Brown_3756.html" title="Jim Brown">Jim Brown</a> as the only players among the NFL's 50 all-time rushing leaders to average 5 yards a carry (only a handful manage above 4.5 yards per carry).</p>
<p>Sanders's retirement was a matter of some controversy. Two years beforehand, Sanders had renewed his contract with the Lions for $35.4 million over six years with an <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_dollar_db5c.html" title="United States dollar">$</a>11 million signing bonus. When he retired with several years left on his contract, the Lions demanded that he return $7.3 million of the bonus.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> Sanders refused, and the Lions sued and eventually won a judgment against him. On <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_15.html" title="February 15">February 15</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2000.html" title="2000">2000</a>, arbitrator Sam Kagel ruled that Sanders was in default of his bonus agreement and owed $5.5 million plus interest over the next three years.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Several years after retirement, and repeated refusals to discuss the abruptness of it, Sanders finally admitted that the culture of losing in the Lions' organization was too much to deal with even though he said that he could still play. He explained that it robbed him of his competitive spirit, and he saw no reason to believe things were going to improve. He also stated that there were tears in his eyes as the Lions lost the final game of his career the season before he left, because he knew in his heart he was never going to play another NFL game.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>

<ul>
<li>Sanders holds the NFL record for the most carries for negative yardage. This is due to his common practice of running backwards to avoid a tackle in hopes of breaking out an explosive run; this, however, often led to being brought down behind the line of scrimmage.</li>
<li>He holds the college single-season rushing record with 2,628 rushing yards in 1988 at <a href="../../../o/k/l/Oklahoma_State_University_3ecc.html" title="Oklahoma State University">Oklahoma State University</a>.</li>
<li>As a receiver, Sanders made 352 receptions for 2,921 yards and 10 touchdowns for the Detroit Lions.</li>
<li>Sanders led the NFL in rushing four times. 1990, 1994, 1996 and 1997.</li>
<li>He rushed for over 1,500 yards in a season for an NFL record five times.</li>
<li>In 1988, Sanders won the <a href="../../../h/e/i/Heisman_Trophy_cdcb.html" title="Heisman Trophy">Heisman Trophy</a> while attending <a href="../../../o/k/l/Oklahoma_State_University_-_Stillwater_1678.html" title="Oklahoma State University - Stillwater">Oklahoma State University</a>.</li>
<li>In the 1989 draft, he was selected in the 1st round (3rd overall) by the <a href="../../../d/e/t/Detroit_Lions_6dd4.html" title="Detroit Lions">Detroit Lions</a>.</li>
<li>In 1997, he set an NFL record by rushing for at least 100 yards in 14 consecutive games and became only the third player to reach 2,000 yards in a single season. He shared the NFL MVP award with <a href="../../../b/r/e/Brett_Favre_652e.html" title="Brett Favre">Brett Favre</a>.</li>
<li>During the final 14 games of the 1997 season Sanders rushed for exactly 2000 yards on 310 carries (6.5 yd./carry), a figure which bears comparison with <a href="../../../o/2E/j/O.J._Simpson_76f9.html" title="O.J. Simpson">O.J. Simpson</a>'s 14-game mark of 2003 yards on 332 carries (6.0 yd./carry).</li>
<li>Each of his 10 years from 1989 through 1998 he was first- or second-team All-Pro and selected to the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Pro_Bowl_580f.html" title="Pro Bowl">Pro Bowl</a>.</li>
<li>Over his professional career, he rushed for at least 100 yards in 76 games, just short of Walter Payton's 77 games and Emmitt Smith's 78 games.</li>
<li>At the time of his retirement, Sanders' 15,269 career rushing yards placed him second behind Walter Payton's 16,726 yards. At Sanders' then-current yearly yardage pace, he would have eclipsed Payton within one or two years.</li>
<li>If Sanders had gained an additional 31 yards over the course of his 153 games, he would have been only the 2nd NFL runner to average 100 yards per game. [see <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jim_Brown_3756.html" title="Jim Brown">Jim Brown</a>]</li>
<li>His 18,190 career yards from scrimmage place him fourth on the all-time list.</li>
<li>In <a href="../../../1/9/9/1999.html" title="1999">1999</a>, he was ranked number 12 on <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Sporting_News_afe1.html" title="The Sporting News">The Sporting News</a>'</i> list of the 100 Greatest Football Players, making him the highest-ranking Lions player.</li>

<li>On <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_25.html" title="November 25">November 25</a>, 2004, his jersey number #20 was retired before the Lions' annual <a href="../../../t/h/a/Thanksgiving_%28United_States%29_7e49.html" title="Thanksgiving (United States)">Thanksgiving Day</a> game.
