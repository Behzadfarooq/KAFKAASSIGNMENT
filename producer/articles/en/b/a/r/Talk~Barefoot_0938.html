<dd>Going barefoot and <a href="../../../f/o/o/Foot_gymnastics.html" title="Foot gymnastics">foot gymnastics</a> act against flat <a href="../../../f/o/o/Foot.html" title="Foot">feet</a> and <a href="../../../v/a/r/Varicose_veins.html" title="Varicose veins">varicose veins</a> by toughening and training the muscles of feet and legs. It builds up resistance against cold and cough, and relieves dorsal pain by improving the motion sequence of walking. For children, going barefoot is of particular importance because lack of exercise during growth would be a significant health risk. However, walking barefoot may be the cause of a <a href="../../../h/o/o/Hookworm.html" title="Hookworm">hookworm</a> infection.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Cold and cough? Right. Source?</p>
<dl>
<dd>=== Public spaces ===</dd>
<dd>Apart from a county in Massachusetts, USA, and certain <a href="../../../b/o/a/Boardwalk.html" title="Boardwalk">boardwalks</a> on the California coast, it is not illegal anywhere in the world to appear barefoot in public.</dd>
</dl>
<p>I doubt that <i>very</i> much. Blanket statements about the laws of the entire world are almost invariably untrue.</p>
<dl>
<dd>=== OSHA (USA) ===</dd>
<dd>== Health ==</dd>
<dd>Health department regulations always apply only to employees of an establishment, not customers. Even so, there are no known health department rules that mandate footwear. Signs that proclaim 'No Shoes, No Service, by order of the Health Department' are always fraudulent.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Whatever. See note about blanket rules above. Also, private businesses are free to refuse customers for not wearing proper attire (try wearing ripped jeans and a T-shirt to a black-tie restaurant, for instance.) <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJosephBarillari_83cd.html" title="User:JosephBarillari">jdb ❋</a> (<a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJosephBarillari_0a57.html" title="User talk:JosephBarillari">talk</a>) 17:15, 25 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Being barefoot is so fun!</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I've always been kind of flummoxed about the conflicting "expertise" regarding the health benefits/drawbacks of going barefoot. For every chiropractor, famous track coach, and podiatrist who insist its healthy and beneficial, you will find one of each who insist it is unhealthy and damaging. But it's hard to deny that a humungous taboo exists here, in every sense of the word. Western society has built up many negative associations with going barefoot; consumer culture demands that we spend a lot on shoes; many people don't even think twice about their assumption that being barefoot is inherently dirty and dangerous, even just walking around their backyard ("there could be glass somewhere!"). But we are subtly encouraged to break the trend, to go barefoot on "special" occasions like on a lush lawn after it rains or on the beach when we're on vacation - silly stuff like that. Whole subcultures exist that have incorporated being barefoot as an important element. Some people sexualize being barefoot, others are physically disgusted by naked feet. It's such a bizarre facet of our culture.

<dd>Might be interesting to add a section about "cultural elements" or "taboos" or something.</dd>

<dd><b>Female pop stars</b>: For whatever reason, and for better or worse, a lot of female pop stars do, indeed, go barefoot on stage and/or in a lot of promotional material, album covers, videos etc., etc. You don't have to be any sort of fetishist to notice this as a cultural phenomenon. Sandie Shaw originated it in the 1960s, and should surely get a mention. Others who immediately come to mind, but are not listed in the article, include Kate Bush, Kylie Minogue, Grace Jones, Mariah Carey, the Bangles, Delta Goodrem, and Dido.

<dd>This page is super creepy, I came here from a page on flip flops since I thought it was odd that "barefoot" was a link. It's like a combination of weird apologeticism and all around weirdness. "Many barefooters are optimistic that with increased awareness, education and visibility, social acceptance will return to pre-1960s levels and in time, the illogical anti-barefoot sentiment of the late 20th and early 21st centuries will be little more than a footnote in the history of footwear."

<p>Going barefoot as a lifestyle choice is very much subject to taboo. I get the feeling this is why there isn't much research either performed or published on the subject.</p>
<p>I did manage to do a little investigating over the internet. Two of my sources are OSHA's web site and the Health Department's page for my home area/state. There are search fields one can use, and I tried using several terms such as "barefoot", "bare feet", "shoes", "attire", and "customer". I didn't receive any results stating that customers had to wear shoes into business establishments based on OSHA's or the Health Department's rules. Stating that owners/operators have the right to manage their business as they seem fit not only seems to be fair and makes sense, but also seems to be the ONLY leverage they have against allowing someone in barefoot, at least in many areas.</p>
<p>But on the other hand, why would anyone turn someone else away for being barefoot? If I go into a store while wearing shoes, I look around and maybe buy something and then leave. If I go in barefoot, I do the same thing. What exactly is the problem? No one seems to want to answer that. If the risk of personal injury is the problem, well then I should say that I've cut my hands a time or two in stores, quietly chastized myself and went home to doctor myself up by washing my hands and putting a bandaid on. Am I to wear gloves next time?</p>
<p>As far as hookworm goes, there are many more parasites and species of bacteria that enter through our mouths and other exposed areas of skin. Feet are not the sole entrypoint, no pun intended. A person could be working in his or her garden and not completely wash up before eating, thereby running an increased risk of getting infected by something. There are other health risks besided parasites. Look at flu season -- lots of people walking around with shoes on, but people still get sick. Bare hands and the basic act of breathing, coupled with less-than-adequate personal hygiene, can spread disease. Once again, should we wear gloves and maybe some breather/filter masks during those times we come in contact with others? Not too many people seem concerned about that. I'm guessing that the general attitude is: get your flu shots, and if you don't and then get sick, go to the doctor.</p>
<p>There are arguments for and against going barefoot. I'm not going to list any here; other people can do their own research. I've done my share of research and have come to a basic conclusion: it looks to me like it all boils down to personal choice. Do I want to incorporate going barefoot more into my life? Does the pleasure of going barefoot in public, or anywhere, outweigh the disappointment or fear of being kicked out of a store, being hurt, or getting sick? Do the shop keepers want to ban bare feet for personal reasons, or simply let people conduct business as usual? If anyone does find some reputable research into this matter, please bring it up. Let's get all this out on the table.</p>
<p>By the way, if there are more arguments against going barefoot than there are in favor of it, that doesn't mean that people shouldn't do it. People go sky diving and bungie jumping, which can be very dangerous, but people still choose to do it, and quite a few of them live through it unscathed.</p>

<p>Somebody added an "expert" tag to the top of the page. Which kind of expert do you want help from? The article attempts to carry a rather broad topic, from health aspects of barefooting, to the cultural and historical significance of bare feet, to practical issues facing contemporary barefooters. I think that only someone who goes barefoot himself would bother to know something about <i>all</i> that, but barefooters tend to be rather POV about this subject.

<dd>I can't really see the point of the "expert" tag, so I've removed it.

<p>I myself enjoy barefooting incredibly, and know of(and participate in) a several bare feet forums, there may be some experts. Many people in the barefeet associations do research into that stuff. If you wish I can somehow obtain their assitance.--<a href="../../../w/h/y/User%7EWhytecypress_886b.html" title="User:Whytecypress">Whytecypress</a> 23:33, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have read that, some places in Africa, people generally walk barefoot, and that tends to make the feet hardened and crack up, so people generally keep some kind of stone, like a <a href="../../../p/u/m/Pumice.html" title="Pumice">pumice</a> at home to scratch away hardened skin with. If someone knows more, maybe it could be added to the article. <a href="../../../w/a/k/User%7EWakuran_4540.html" title="User:Wakuran">惑乱 分からん</a> 09:48, 10 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've removed the "partial nudity" reference for the second time now. How ridiculous! Don't equate being barefoot in any way to being nude. Under this argument, not wearing gloves (and thus having bare hands) or wearing short-sleeved shirts (having bare arms) would be a form of partial nudity. When traveling to <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russia.html" title="Russia">Russia</a> 13 years ago, my group was advised that we should not wear short pants because the Russians found them offensive. Should I then use that fact to decry shorts as partial nudity because some people (e.g. Russians) are "embarrassed" by them?</p>
<dl>
<dd>(Off-topic) I think that either you misunderstood the advice or it was not very accurate. Russians in general do not find shorts offensive. Short pants are not as popular as in U.S., but Russians do wear short pants themselves. There are just a few exceptions.
<ul>
<li>A Russian will not go outside wearing shorts unless it's sunny and the air is at least 65 F. If you see a group of people wearing short pants in Moscow when it's 50 F and raining, they are likely to be American tourists.</li>
<li>Women rarely wear shorts because they are considered bad taste in clothing ( jeans are better than shorts, a dress or a skirt is best )</li>
<li>Shorts are a big no-no in churches, for either gender --<a href="../../../i/t/i/User%7EItinerant1_2854.html" title="User:Itinerant1">Itinerant1</a> 10:45, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The partial nudity reference is definitely POV. It was taken out once. Please leave it out! <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Gschrive87 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Gschrive87_9ca6.html" title="Special:Contributions/Gschrive87">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

<dd>I agree a categorical statement that going barefoot is a form of partial nudity is POV. (I assume you meant POV, not NPOV.) But perhaps a better solution than simply deleting it would be to mention that it is seen this way in certain cultures, especially if we can give some examples and sources. To me, the variation in cultural perceptions surrounding bare feet is one of the most interesting angles here. [<i>response by Avenue</i>]
<dl>
<dd>Thanks, I've changed it to POV -- don't know what I was thinking. There are different standards in different societies, true, but I think you would be hard-pressed to find a culture that would regard barefootedness as akin to any type of nudity. Different societies may regard being barefoot, especially publicly barefoot, as unacceptable to varying degrees, but usually not for decency reasons. Normally it has to do with public health perceptions, job regulatory agencies misunderstandings (e.g. OSHA regs against bare feet in restaurants by customers which is false), or "safety" reasons (e.g. "You might step on glass!"). Perhaps changing it to note that different societies view barefooters with varying degrees of acceptance would be fine, but can we take out the <i>partial nudity</i> reference? --Gschrive87 17:12, 25 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>This is a tough one. In societies that accept flip-flop sandals, it is hard to argue that bare feet are consciously considered <i>indecent</i>. On the other hand, the "health" and "safety" objections are clearly post hoc rationalizations of something else that the objector cannot or will not state directly. My impression is that much opposition to barefooting does originate in a general perception that appearing in a public space wearing "too few" items of clothing is wrong, which I cannot but think is somehow related to the nudity taboo -- although not as directly as the contested sentence suggests. It is probably too convoluted a connection to try to explain in the intro paragraph. <a href="../../../h/e/n/User%7EHenning_Makholm_0024.html" title="User:Henning Makholm">Henning Makholm</a> 10:01, 26 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm not sure what the world view might be on this. Here in America, whenever I hear anyone make a disparaging comment about anyone being barefoot in public, I've never heard anyone object to it due it being anything <i>indecent</i> or <i>obscene</i>. As I said, the number 1 disapproval almost always has to do with it supposedly being <i>unsanitary</i> (as if the bottom of a shoe isn't?), especially if one is in a restaurant or supermarket. Some quote supposed OSHA regulations against it "for health reasons". It would be interesting to poll people and see what the general objection is to bare feet. My guess is that it would be based more on these issues and not on the <i>partial nudity</i> basis. To be more NPOV in the article, perhaps a section on "Objections" could be added with a bulleted list of possible or observed objections to barefooters. This could be listed as one issue, that some regard it as indecent.--Gschrive87 16:02, 26 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I'm not saying that the "indecency" feeling is conscious. What I'm trying to say is that the health arguments are <i>subconscious</i> rationalisations of an objection whose real cause cannot comfortably be spoken <i>or thought</i> about. To consciously consider bare feet a form of nudity would for many non-barefooters be confusingly similar to considering the bare feet in front of you sexy, which would be perverse, so the superego censors it. (Hm... arrgh, I'm turning into an armchair Freudian. Heavens help me. Disregard everything I said. It's not as if it can possibly lead to encyclopedic content anyway) <a href="../../../h/e/n/User%7EHenning_Makholm_0024.html" title="User:Henning Makholm">Henning Makholm</a> 23:09, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Technically any 'part' of the body that is 'not clothed' qualifies as 'partial nudity' by definition, not a matter of POV, so <i>ad absurdum</i> even a burka which just 'reveals' the eyes; obviously the cultural perception as 'rather nude', not 'rather dressed', determines whether the term for a case fitting the technical definition makes sense in a given context, so Avenue's idea is a good one. <a href="../../../f/a/s/User%7EFastifex_6571.html" title="User:Fastifex">Fastifex</a> 11:23, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Quite some time ago this article included a "list of famous barefooters". In late January 2006 it was converted into a category, which some time later <a href="../../../c/a/t/Wikipedia%7ECategories_for_deletion_Log_2006_July_12_1515.html#Category:Barefooters" title="Wikipedia:Categories for deletion/Log/2006 July 12">got deleted</a>. Now the list is back, and being populated by one or more anons. I have been trying to filter the additions, removing people whose main biography pages do not contain any claim about them being barefoot. However, this begins to feel rather like an uphill battle, and if some of the barefoot claims that <i>are</i> found on some bio pages are found to be wrong and are corrected, we have no good mechanism for correcting the list here (unlike a category, incidentally). Do we really want such a list here? If we do want it, can it be reliably maintained? –<a href="../../../h/e/n/User%7EHenning_Makholm_0024.html" title="User:Henning Makholm">Henning Makholm</a> 00:44, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>It does seem like a rather odd list, I mean who really cares? Next we'll be putting up a list of celebs that have been known to scratch there ass in public lmao.
