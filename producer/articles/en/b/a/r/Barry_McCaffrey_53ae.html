<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/r/Barry_McCaffrey_53ae.html" title="Edit section: Account of the incident from The General's War">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Account of the incident from <i>The General's War</i></span></h3>
<p>In <i>The General's War</i>, authors Michael Gordon (<i><a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Times_d49e.html" title="New York Times">New York Times</a></i>) and Bernard Trainor (<a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._Marine_Corps_5b3a.html" title="U.S. Marine Corps">U.S. Marine Corps</a>, retired), note that the U.S. Army's objective in the western desert of Iraq was to degrade Saddam Hussein's military capability by destroying the <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republican_Guard_f566.html" title="Republican Guard">Republican Guard</a>, especially its equipment, while the Marine Corps forces liberated <a href="../../../k/u/w/Kuwait.html" title="Kuwait">Kuwait</a>. The VII Corps and XVIII Corps of the army were about to heavily engage the Republican Guard when a ceasefire was declared at the behest of Bush administration officials.</p>
<p>After the cease fire was declared, McCaffrey's ordered his unit, the 24th Infantry Division, to push forward to a point where it would be in between the retreating Iraqi forces, who were coming up from the south, and the northern direction they were headed. He did so without explicit orders from his superiors. This put the division in prime position to bump into retreating Iraqi forces and be fired upon by the Iraqis. Such fire from the Iraqis would give the 24th Infantry Division pretext to return fire under the doctrine of self-defense, and this occurred.</p>
<p>McCaffrey claims his division received fire from an Iraqi. Units of the 24th Infantry Division, under McCaffrey's direction, unleashed a fury of fire, disproportionate force, in return, according to the book. It used all the assets at its disposal and wiped out the Iraqi forces.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/r/Barry_McCaffrey_53ae.html" title="Edit section: New Yorker article">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline"><i>New Yorker</i> article</span></h3>
<p>According to an article written by <a href="../../../s/e/y/Seymour_Hersh_88ba.html" title="Seymour Hersh">Seymour Hersh</a> published in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2000.html" title="2000">2000</a> <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_New_Yorker_6fe2.html" title="The New Yorker">The New Yorker</a></i>, General McCaffrey committed <a href="../../../w/a/r/War_crimes.html" title="War crimes">war crimes</a> during the <a href="../../../g/u/l/Gulf_War_bc7b.html" title="Gulf War">Gulf War</a> by having troops under his command kill retreating <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iraq.html" title="Iraq">Iraqis</a> after a <a href="../../../c/e/a/Ceasefire.html" title="Ceasefire">ceasefire</a> had been declared. Hersh's article "quotes senior officers decrying the lack of discipline and proportionality in the McCaffrey-ordered attack." One colonel told Hersh that it "made no sense for a defeated army to invite their own death. ... It came across as shooting fish in a barrel. Everyone was incredulous." <a href="http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2000/05/15/hersh/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2000/05/15/hersh/" rel="nofollow">[3]</a></p>
<p>These charges had been made by Army personnel after the war and an Army investigation had cleared McCaffrey of any wrongdoing. Hersh dismissed the findings of the investigation, writing that "few soldiers report crimes, because they don't want to jeopardize their Army careers."</p>
<p>Hersh describes his interview with Private First Class <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Sheehan-Miles_6196.html" title="Charles Sheehan-Miles">Charles Sheehan-Miles</a>, who later published a novel about his experience in the Gulf:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>When I asked Sheehan-Miles why he fired, he replied, "At that point, we were shooting everything. Guys in the company told me later that some were civilians. It wasn't like they came at us with a gun. It was that they were there -- 'in the wrong place at the wrong time.'" Although Sheehan-Miles is unsure whether he and his fellow-tankers were ever actually fired upon during the war, he is sure that there was no significant enemy fire. "We took some incoming once, but it was friendly fire," he said. "The folks we fought never had a chance." He came away from Iraq convinced that he and his fellow-soldiers were, as another tanker put it, part of "the biggest firing squad in history."</i></dd>

<p>McCaffrey denied the charges and attacked what he called Hersh's "revisionist history" of the Gulf War. According to Georgie Anne Geyer of the <i><a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago_Tribune_3abd.html" title="Chicago Tribune">Chicago Tribune</a></i> from May 2000, Hersh’s accusations were disputed by a number of military personnel, who later claimed to have been misquoted by the journalist. She argues that this may have been Hersh’s misguided attempt to break another <a href="../../../m/y/_/My_Lai_8cdf.html" title="My Lai">My Lai</a> story, and that he "could not possibly like a man such as McCaffrey, who is so temperamentally and philosophically different from him…” Finally, she suggests that Hersh may also have been motivated to attack the general for McCaffrey’s role as the drug czar.<a href="http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/chicagotribune/access/53912132.html?dids=53912132:53912132&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=May+19%2C+2000&amp;author=Georgie+Anne+Geyer%2C+Universal+Press+Syndicate&amp;pub=Chicago+Tribune&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=23&amp;desc=SEYMOUR+HERSH%27S+GULF+WAR+MISCONCEPTIONS" class="external autonumber" title="http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/chicagotribune/access/53912132.html?dids=53912132:53912132&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=May+19%2C+2000&amp;author=Georgie+Anne+Geyer%2C+Universal+Press+Syndicate&amp;pub=Chicago+Tribune&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=23&amp;desc=SEYMOUR+HERSH%27S+GULF+WAR+MISCONCEPTIONS" rel="nofollow">[4]</a></p>
<p>Lt. Gen. Steven Arnold, interviewed by Hersh for the controversial article, was one of the officers who later claimed to have been misquoted. He wrote the editor of <i>The New Yorker</i> saying "I know that my brief comments in the article were not depicted in an entirely accurate manner and were taken out of context…. When the Iraqi forces fired on elements of the 24th Infantry Division, they were clearly committing a hostile act. I regret having granted an interview with Mr. Hersh. The tone and thrust of the article places me in a position of not trusting or respecting General Barry McCaffrey, and nothing could be further from the truth." <a href="http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/wsj/access/53954284.html?dids=53954284:53954284&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;date=May+22%2C+2000&amp;author=By+Barry+R.+McCaffrey&amp;type=8_1984&amp;desc=The+New+Yorker%27s+Revisionist+History" class="external autonumber" title="http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/wsj/access/53954284.html?dids=53954284:53954284&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;date=May+22%2C+2000&amp;author=By+Barry+R.+McCaffrey&amp;type=8_1984&amp;desc=The+New+Yorker%27s+Revisionist+History" rel="nofollow">[5]</a></p>
<p>Similar criticism came from Gen. <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colin_Powell_f293.html" title="Colin Powell">Colin Powell</a>, former <a href="../../../s/e/c/Secretary_of_State_088f.html" title="Secretary of State">Secretary of State</a> and the <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chairman_of_the_Joint_Chiefs_of_Staff_27d7.html" title="Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff">Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff</a> during the Iraq War, who described the Hersh article as "attempted character assassination on General McCaffrey," in an interview with <a href="../../../s/a/m/Sam_Donaldson_e336.html" title="Sam Donaldson">Sam Donaldson</a> for the TV show <i><a href="../../../t/h/i/This_Week_3437.html" title="This Week">This Week</a></i>, in May of 2000.</p>

<p>ABC News followed up on Hersh's report in June 2000, interviewing six soldiers from the platoon of scouts under the command of Gen. McCaffrey. All six confirmed Hersh's report, telling ABC News that they witnessed the attack. Two of the scouts, Edward Walker and David Collatt, claim to have witnessed the attack from 200 yards away.</p>
<p>ABC interviewed Major General John LeMoyne, who oversaw the Army investigation into the charges against McCaffrey. LeMoyne denies the incident occurred: "Nobody was killed. None, zero. Soldiers--the Iraqi soldiers were never shot at, ever, at that point. None of us, hundreds and hundreds of us ever saw a body. None of us."</p>
<p>ABC reviewed LeMoyne's investigation and found it "flawed and incomplete. The Army failed to interview the aide Le Moyne told investigators he immediately sent to the area. It failed to interview many of the Scouts, and it failed to interview all the Bradley crews. While the Army did conclude there was firing, it failed to establish which Bradleys were firing. The Bradley crew members who did submit statements denied any knowledge of the incident and denied shooting at anything. Further, the Army failed to establish why there was firing at all in an area known to hold the prisoners. To this day, Battalion Commander Charles Ware does not have a clear explanation."</p>

<p>In June of 2005, he surveyed Iraq on behalf of <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._Central_Command_ad21.html" title="U.S. Central Command">U.S. Central Command</a> and wrote an optimistic report afterwards <a href="http://www.foreign.senate.gov/testimony/2005/McCaffreyTestimony050718.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.foreign.senate.gov/testimony/2005/McCaffreyTestimony050718.pdf" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>. In it, he says the U.S. senior military leadership team is superb and predicts the insurgency will reach its peak from January-to-September 2006, allowing for U.S. force withdrawls in the late summer of 2006. A year later, however, after visiting Iraq again, his assessment was grim: "Iraq is abject misery...I think it's a terribly dangerous place for diplomats and journalists and contractors and Iraqi mothers. Trying to go about daily life in that city is a real nightmare for these poor people." He called <a href="../../../a/b/u/Abu_Ghraib_ba45.html" title="Abu Ghraib">Abu Ghraib</a> "the biggest mistake that happened so far." <a href="http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0605/30/sitroom.01.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0605/30/sitroom.01.html" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>. In an official memorandum <a href="http://www.jerrypournelle.com/reports/jerryp/Iraqreport.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.jerrypournelle.com/reports/jerryp/Iraqreport.html" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>, McCaffrey nevertheless expressed optimism about the operation's longer term future: "The situation is perilous, uncertain, and extreme — but far from hopeless. The U.S. Armed Forces are a rock. This is the most competent and brilliantly led military in a tactical and operational sense that we have ever fielded.... There is no reason why the U.S. cannot achieve our objectives in Iraq. Our aim must be to create a viable federal state under the rule of law which does not: enslave its own people, threaten its neighbors, or produce weapons of mass destruction. This is a ten year task. We should be able to draw down most of our combat forces in 3-5 years. We have few alternatives to the current US strategy which is painfully but gradually succeeding. This is now a race against time. Do we have the political will, do we have the military power, will we spend the resources required to achieve our aims?"
