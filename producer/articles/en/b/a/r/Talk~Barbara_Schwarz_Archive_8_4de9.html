<dd>As Tilman states below, this is a typical modus operandi for those who follow the ways of the scientology cult.

<dd>She does say that, and she's wrong - I've never interacted with her before.

<p>This article should include the <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientology.html" title="Scientology">Scientology</a> tag as part of the Category.</p>
<ul>
<li>Barbara Schwarz was the former president of the scientology cult in Germany.</li>
<li>Barbara Schwarz sued the scienology cult in the US courts.</li>
<li>Senior scientology cult executive Mark "Marty" Rathbun is a central point of her FOIA requests, where Barbara Schwarz claims a marital relationship to him.</li>
<li>The scientology cult's former spokesperson, Linda Simmons Hight, claimed the cult did not know her. However this is at odds with other documentation which clearly shows that Barbara Schwarz was a senior figure in the scientology cult. Hight's claim is clearly false, and her statement is noteworthy in relation to the scientology cult and how it disconnects itself from its members whom it considers embarressing.</li>
<li>Although Barbara Schwarz claims the scientology cult is full of infiltrators, she defends the cult and follows its practices, and she refers to herself as a scientologist. <a href="../../../o/r/s/User%7EOrsini_2b01.html" title="User:Orsini">Orsini</a> 01:12, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Remove page?</span></h2>
<p>To continue the now-deleted discussion on deleting the page due to lack of notability.... I had made a few points.</p>
<ul>
<li>Schwarz has four news articles about her. One in the Asbury Park paper, one in the Oregonian, a blurb in the Deseret News, and the front page article in the Salt Lake Tribune. Just because you were in the paper four times doesn't mean you deserve an article.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>There were six articles about in the news media, not four. Specifically:
<ul>
<li>Getting at public records tests intent of new law, Asbury Park Press, 13.3.2005</li>
<li>Utah woman without rival in pursuit of public records, The Oregonian, 3.5.2004</li>
<li>E-mail at heart of battle, The Deseret News, 23.8.2001</li>
<li>S.L. Woman's Quest Strains Public Records System, The Salt Lake Tribune, 11.5.2003</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>- which you have mentioned, plus:
<ul>
<li>'Neutral reportage' privilege recognized, rcfp.org (The Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press), 11.5.2005</li>
<li>Utah appeals court backs reporting privilege, First Amendment Center Online, 14.6.2005</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>The Asbury Park article in particular described Barbara Schwarz as <i>notorious for her nationwide quest for documents</i> <a href="http://72.14.221.104/search?q=cache:WwrfqBC4gOEJ:www.app.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article%3FAID%3D/20050313/NEWS/503130395+&amp;hl=de&amp;gl=de&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=1" class="external autonumber" title="http://72.14.221.104/search?q=cache:WwrfqBC4gOEJ:www.app.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article%3FAID%3D/20050313/NEWS/503130395+&amp;hl=de&amp;gl=de&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=1" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> in her use of the FOIA process. A noteworthy point here is New Jersey Government Records Council chairman, Vincent Maltese, suggested <i>lawmakers should consider amending the law to keep libraries from being forced to undertake private research projects, like Schwarz's.</i> While merely being the subject of news articles on its own may not be deserving of a biographical article in Wikipedia, Barbara Schwarz’s effect on FOIA process, the controversy surrounding her requests for records to verify some extraordinary allegations about her personal life and the resulting litigation, and her part as a national president in the scientology cult are of lasting and noteworthy significance and Barbara Schwarz is deserving of an unbiased and factual encyclopedic biographical account. <a href="../../../o/r/s/User%7EOrsini_2b01.html" title="User:Orsini">Orsini</a>
<dl>

They are reliable sources for purposes of <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> (in that they are real organizations that generally don't publish lies and cite their sources) but don't count for purposes of establishing notability. <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalwatch_8ce9.html" title="User:Calwatch">Calwatch</a> 04:07, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The notability guidelines are not policy, and does state, in part, that "non-notability does not attract editors".

<li>Whether or not she is a notable usenet personality is debatable.

If it were not for the fact that Schwarz has no assets, she would have been sued for libelous defamation, and she has invited people to sue her <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/alt.religion.scientology/msg/14719a7ba0cb0b9c?hl=en&amp;" class="external autonumber" title="http://groups.google.com/group/alt.religion.scientology/msg/14719a7ba0cb0b9c?hl=en&amp;" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> knowing the exercise will only leave a prospective plaintiff suing her out of pocket.

<dd>Ms. Schwarz is one of apparently two people that <a href="../../../s/c/o/SCOTUS_92d6.html" title="SCOTUS">SCOTUS</a> has permanently barred from filing civil cases due to her frivilous filing of lawsuits. Ms. Schwarz has also filed more FOIA requests than any other individual on Earth. She is a notable Usenet personality due to her posting of tens of thousands of posts, many of which caught the attention of spam watchers that put the Salt Lake City Library on a spam list because they refused to limit Ms. Schwarz's internet use. SLC Library ultimately banned her from their computers due to her prolific spamming. She is probably the only person in the entire country that has been barred from a public library's computer system for Usenet abuse. <i>do we know that she wrote her 92 part life story on Usenet? And is it verifiable?</i> We know that she did because she admitted to the Salt Lake City Tribune that the life-story series posted to Usenet was written by her. <a href="../../../v/i/v/User%7EVivaldi_8033.html" title="User:Vivaldi">Vivaldi</a> (<a href="../../../v/i/v/User_talk%7EVivaldi_d6d0.html" title="User talk:Vivaldi">talk</a>) 10:18, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Inclusion is a question that has been debated and, as has been pointed out, essentially resolved by three AfDs to date.

<dd>However, a point that was made last night was that votes tended toward inclusion a) due to the bizarre behavior of Ms. Schwarz and b) due to the tendency of wikipedians to err on the side of keeping articles, and especially not to be swayed by sockpuppetry or outside influences (look at the cascades of "delete" votes any time a couple of anons start putting their two cents in on a AfD). If we took Ms. Schwarz out of the picture, could it be deleted in AfD? Probably, although at this point it's gotten famous enough, so maybe the best we could hope for would be "no consensus". So I'm not going to do the work to put it up again for AfD, although I would vote for deletion if it came up. <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalwatch_8ce9.html" title="User:Calwatch">Calwatch</a> 04:11, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

The fact Barbara Schwarz was once the president of the scientology cult in Germany, and claims to have a marital relationship with senior cult exectutive Mark "Marty" Rathbun in her court pleadings <a href="http://66.102.7.104/search?q=cache:m7vkVTRCIoIJ:www.dcd.uscourts.gov/opinions/2000/Kennedy/98-2406.pdf+%22barbara+schwarz+%22+site:.gov&amp;hl=en" class="external autonumber" title="http://66.102.7.104/search?q=cache:m7vkVTRCIoIJ:www.dcd.uscourts.gov/opinions/2000/Kennedy/98-2406.pdf+%22barbara+schwarz+%22+site:.gov&amp;hl=en" rel="nofollow">[12]</a> and FOIA searches, as well as in her 92-part published autobiography on the Usenet, makes this article something very much to do with the scientology cult. <a href="../../../o/r/s/User%7EOrsini_2b01.html" title="User:Orsini">Orsini</a> 01:25, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If they really did have 10 million that would be another thing. Admitting, for the sake of argument, that the CoS is an evil organization then compare it to other evil organizations, as to the amount of Wikipedia coverage. How about the <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazi_party.html" title="Nazi party">Nazi party</a>, the <a href="../../../k/l/u/Klu_Klux_Klan_07cc.html" title="Klu Klux Klan">Klu Klux Klan</a>, the <a href="../../../m/a/f/Mafia.html" title="Mafia">Mafia</a>, the <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesse_James_ee9c.html" title="Jesse James">Jesse James</a> gang? My point is that Scientology is not all that important so critics of Scientology are not that important (I don't mean to hurt their feelings; just not so important in the flow of world history.) and a critic of critics of Scientology is even less important. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_Dufour_1d44.html" title="User:Steve Dufour">Steve Dufour</a> 11:04, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Heck, even the entire Milky Way Galaxy is sort of insignificant and unimportant. It really only matters to people that happen to be alive right now and want to learn more about a topic that they've heard about. And I would put forth than many folks on the Internet are curious to learn more about Ms. Schwarz's vast FOIA records persuits, her large numbers of frivilous lawsuits, and her posting of her life story on Usenet.

<dd>Wikipediatrix writes, <i>"If we were talking about a woman in..."</i> It is perhaps true that a similar person in a similar situation may not garner an entry, it depends on how many people and what kinds of people that they become notable to. B.S. captured the attention of <a href="../../../s/c/o/SCOTUS_92d6.html" title="SCOTUS">SCOTUS</a> and the watchful eyes of A.R.S. discovered that she had filed lawsuits against the Church of Scientology -- a notably litigious cult.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Suggestion</span></h2>
<p>Personally, I find the 2nd paragarph awkwardly worded, and feel that the use of, "She says...", "According to...", "She claims..." does not provide a neutral presentation of the information:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Schwarz stated purpose in seeking information is to verify her personal history. According to Schwarz's memories, she was born in Utah, the daughter of L. Ron Hubbard and the granddaughter of Dwight Eisenhower, where she lived in a submarine village beneath the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Salt_Lake_6798.html" title="Great Salt Lake">Great Salt Lake</a> until she was kidnapped and taken into Germany at age 4 by Nazi agents. In Germany, she married a prominent Scientologist who was falsely imprisoned, for having killed her, in a secret prison in the United States.<sup id="_ref-slctrib_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-slctrib" title="">[1]</a></sup> However, the requests for information Schwarz has made have not been able to verify her recollection of the preceding events.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Or something similar where the intro clearly identifies that it is her version of events and then uses a sympathetic tone. --<a href="../../../t/r/%C3%B6/User_talk%7ETr%C3%B6del_2c9f.html" title="User talk:Trödel"><font color="#06C">Trödel</font></a> 23:53, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Your last sentence needs to clearly state that it is Barbara's assertion of an alleged event. The <a href="../../../s/c/o/SCOTUS_92d6.html" title="SCOTUS">SCOTUS</a> said her claims were frivilous and other judges said her claims were fanciful. And obviously they are. But you can't just leave a ridiculous claim like that in the article without clearly specifying that it is B.S. that is making the claim. <a href="../../../v/i/v/User%7EVivaldi_8033.html" title="User:Vivaldi">Vivaldi</a> (<a href="../../../v/i/v/User_talk%7EVivaldi_d6d0.html" title="User talk:Vivaldi">talk</a>) 00:20, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>See my attempt above. It gives her description of the events, and then asserts that the requests for info have not verified her claims - just the information - no assertion that she is claiming, or whatever - the reader can draw their own conclusions of whether she is delusional or there is a conspiracy against her. --<a href="../../../t/r/%C3%B6/User_talk%7ETr%C3%B6del_2c9f.html" title="User talk:Trödel"><font color="#06C">Trödel</font></a> 05:15, 16 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Her descriptions of events are "claims" that she is making. It is not "asserting that she is claiming". A persons descriptions of events can rightly be called their claims as to what happened. Goldman claims OJ murdered his son. Bush claims Iran is a part of the axis-of-evil. Newton asserted that F=M*A.

<dd>"She says" and "she claims" are about as neutral as you can get. The only reason it sounds dismissive is because the claims are so absurd. If you write, "David Touretzky claims that neural networks can be usefully modeled and studied by utilizing rat populations". Or if you say Einstein claims that E=MC^2, it is pretty neutral. But when you say, "Tom Cruise claims to know the history of psychiatry", then it sounds like you are being dismissive. The whole point is that absurd claims will sound absurd to anyone that reads them. We are under no obligation on Wikipedia to make absurd claims sound plausible or believable or more believable than they appear on the surface. Every claim that is made in the article should be attributed to someone or some group. <a href="../../../v/i/v/User%7EVivaldi_8033.html" title="User:Vivaldi">Vivaldi</a> (<a href="../../../v/i/v/User_talk%7EVivaldi_d6d0.html" title="User talk:Vivaldi">talk</a>) 01:31, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Steve writes, <i>Do you think people need to be told not to believe Barbara's story?</i> Do you like asking questions just to waste people's time? Obviously I don't think that people need to be told to disbelieve B.S. I just want any claim that is attributed to Barbara's words, to be attributed to Barbara in the article by using "Barbara says..." or "Barbara claims...". It is not appropriate to say that Barbara is the granddaughter of Eisenhower and the wife of L. Ron Hubbard and also the daughter of L. Ron Hubbard (yes...both wife and daughter since her "thetan" moved from mother to daughter during her childbirth) -- and then just source the claim to B.S. with a link to her writings. It is appropriate to say "Barbara claims she is the granddaughter...". This is as neutral as you can get. We are under no obligation to pretend that Ms. Schwarz's claims -- that are absurd on their face and mocked by numerous judges -- have any merit whatsoever. But we also don't need to waste time by pointing out that invisible pink unicorns controlled by nazi psychiatrists probably don't exist outside of Barbara's mind. We just need to say what Barbara claims and attribute it to her. Then we can present the claims of others in a similar manner. Even those that are not astute can figure out "the Truth" without a Big Chief Tablet(tm) and a set of crayons. <a href="../../../v/i/v/User%7EVivaldi_8033.html" title="User:Vivaldi">Vivaldi</a> (<a href="../../../v/i/v/User_talk%7EVivaldi_d6d0.html" title="User talk:Vivaldi">talk</a>) 06:30, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>We are going in circles. No I don't think anybody will believe Barbara's stories, whether they are posted on Wikipedia, nor if she writes them on stone, nor if she shouts them from rooftops. The article isn't here to disprove Barbara's claims. Wikipedia isn't the arbiter of "Truth". Wikipedia's standard for inclusion is <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a> and not "Truth". The reason she is "so important that we must have an article about her" is because many people on the internet are interested in learning more about her and they have made it known that they want this article here. The process is called consensus and after three attempts were made to completely remove the article in AfDs and the resounding voice of Wikipedia editors was they want the article. I can't speak for all the people that said we should have this article, but I know it would have saved me some valuable time if there was an article like this to read when I first had the displeasure of running across Ms. Schwarz. <a href="../../../v/i/v/User%7EVivaldi_8033.html" title="User:Vivaldi">Vivaldi</a> (<a href="../../../v/i/v/User_talk%7EVivaldi_d6d0.html" title="User talk:Vivaldi">talk</a>) 07:50, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Everyone's life story will contain nuggets of information that are unusual and notable because they distinguish those folks from "normal" folks. Most people don't say they had sex with L. Ron Hubbard and died in the process and then became their own child. That's an unusual claim that Barbara makes and it is one of the more interesting bits. The few parts were she talks about mundane and "normal" things in her life aren't why she is notable. <a href="../../../v/i/v/User%7EVivaldi_8033.html" title="User:Vivaldi">Vivaldi</a> (<a href="../../../v/i/v/User_talk%7EVivaldi_d6d0.html" title="User talk:Vivaldi">talk</a>) 07:50, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Barbara (or rather, a supporter of her) posted the letter from Nancy Tessman. (One might verify this letter through a GRAMA request <a href="http://attorneygeneral.utah.gov/GRAMA.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://attorneygeneral.utah.gov/GRAMA.html" rel="nofollow">[16]</a> if there is doubt that her access was terminated) Plus, AHBL mentions it too, and that they removed the UEN block <a href="http://www.ahbl.org/notices/barbschwarz.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ahbl.org/notices/barbschwarz.php" rel="nofollow">[17]</a>. --<a href="../../../t/i/l/User%7ETilman_2a94.html" title="User:Tilman">Tilman</a> 15:43, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The second linked reference above supports the first linked reference which was posted to the Usenet on October 24, 2005. It states: <i>"As of October 21st 2005, it appears that the Salt Lake City Library has terminated her access to their computers and network. As per AHBL policies, we have delisted the UEN netblock that she was posting from."</i> <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Abusive_Hosts_Blocking_List_2af1.html" title="The Abusive Hosts Blocking List">The Abusive Hosts Blocking List</a> is considered to be a reliable reference, since its IP block lists are used for filtering corporate email. Thirdly, on the archived talk page that was deleted about 24 hours ago, Barbara Schwarz herself stated in reference to this matter: <i>"One day they</i> [the library] <i>gave in and denied Internet access to me."</i> There are many other references posted on the Usenet by Barbara Schwarz herself stating that she was permanently suspended from the Library's computer and internet use, however the reference above from the cited Usenet message above accurately quotes the letter dated as October 21, 2005 by Nancy Tessman, the Director of the library.

<dd>Well, it's negative and poorly sourced to USENET. What does WP:BLP say about this? How deeply have you researched into Barbara Schwarz related USENET postings?

<dd>Okay. 1. There are at least two sources to verify the allegation; one source is the Usenet. The second source is <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Abusive_Hosts_Blocking_List_2af1.html" title="The Abusive Hosts Blocking List">The Abusive Hosts Blocking List</a> reference. A third source is from Barbara Schwarz herself on the Talk page that was removed.</dd>
<dd>2. Noting the concerns stated in <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> which may be of issue here:
<ul>
<li><i>Unsourced or poorly sourced negative material about living persons should be removed immediately from both the article and the talk page.</i> I don't consider the material to be poorly sourced. The <a href="../../../a/h/b/AHBL_c731.html" title="AHBL">AHBL</a> and the poster of the Usenet message are on opposite "sides"; the person posting Schwarz's email to the Usenet is a friend of Schwarz.</li>
<li><i>The writing style should be neutral, factual, and understated, avoiding both a sympathetic point of view and an advocacy journalism point of view.</i> The statement <i>Barbara Schwarz was permanently suspended from the use of the Salt Lake City Public Library's personal computers and internet due to complaints regarding her spamming of the Usenet</i> can be amended to <i>Barbara Schwarz was permanently suspended from the use of the Salt Lake City Public Library's personal computers and internet due to complaints based on allegations she was spamming the Usenet</i> while still citing the same references and retaining accuracy with a softer "tone".</li>
<li><i>Remove unsourced or poorly sourced negative material.</i> Reference is made to <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> guidelines: <i>Unverified material that could be construed as critical, negative or harmful in articles about living persons should be removed immediately, and should not be moved to the talk page.</i> Also: <i>Because conscious and unconscious biases are not always self-evident, you shouldn't necessarily be satisfied with a single source. Find another one and cross-check.</i> Reference sources have been provided. More than one source confirms the validity of the statement. The statement has been verified by both of the stated references, and by Barbara Schwarz herself.</li>
<li><i>Any assertion in a biography of a living person that might be defamatory if untrue must be sourced.</i> I am satisfied that the information is accurate and is not defamatory.</li>
<li><i>The responsibility for justifying controversial claims in Wikipedia, of all kinds, but especially for living people's bios, rests firmly on the shoulders of the person making the claim.</i> As I am the editor who added this material to the article (this time around), I am accountable for it, and I am satified the material is correct and accurate.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>I notice there is a project which Fred Bauder is on, (WikiProject Fact and Reference Check) and as Mr Bauder has been looking at this page already, his comments on this matter would be welcomed.</dd>
<dd>3. The only positive posting I have found Barbara Schwarz has made to the Usenet was a report of the opening of the Salt Lake City branch of the scientology cult in December 2005. <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/alt.religion.scientology/msg/fef961684ae61764" class="external autonumber" title="http://groups.google.com/group/alt.religion.scientology/msg/fef961684ae61764" rel="nofollow">[18]</a> It shows Barbara Schwarz is capable of writing a good article when she chooses. She often appears to choose differently. <a href="../../../o/r/s/User%7EOrsini_2b01.html" title="User:Orsini">Orsini</a> 14:44, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Yes it is her. I know it because 1) Barbara reposted the court decision and mentions "Vosper" in her 92 part series, 2) attorney Heinemann mentioned the case with all the names 3) a book mentions her name <a href="http://books.google.com/books?q=%22Barbara+Schwarz%22+Vosper&amp;btnG=Search+Books&amp;as_brr=0" class="external autonumber" title="http://books.google.com/books?q=%22Barbara+Schwarz%22+Vosper&amp;btnG=Search+Books&amp;as_brr=0" rel="nofollow">[19]</a>.

<dd>Barbara Schwarz recently posted three articles to the Usenet relating to her involuntary deprogramming. Article <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/alt.religion.scientology/msg/76d2bb4b669add54" class="external autonumber" title="http://groups.google.com/group/alt.religion.scientology/msg/76d2bb4b669add54" rel="nofollow">[20]</a> appears to be a transcripted copy of a letter from Doctors Slavin and Häser, detailing the injuries she had sustained and assessing her psychological trauma. Article <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/alt.religion.scientology/msg/0f88f95aeb3550f1" class="external autonumber" title="http://groups.google.com/group/alt.religion.scientology/msg/0f88f95aeb3550f1" rel="nofollow">[21]</a> appears to be a transcripted copy of a letter from Doctor Kühnemann, stating her estimated recovery time from her injuries. Article <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/fr.soc.sectes/msg/ac32f30293a1e476" class="external autonumber" title="http://groups.google.com/group/fr.soc.sectes/msg/ac32f30293a1e476" rel="nofollow">[22]</a> appears to be a transcripted copy of a letter from the police or a police report. Barbara Schwarz's transcriptions of letters and documents are mostly accurate; it's when her interpretations of these documents are added that matters tend to become confused, or when parts of the original are omitted. Is there an independent copy or scan of these letters and documents available? By this account, it appears her own exit counseling / involuntary deprogramming experience explains much of the venom she expresses for the practice. <a href="../../../o/r/s/User%7EOrsini_2b01.html" title="User:Orsini">Orsini</a> 16:46, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I've never heard of these documents before. I'd advise Barbara (who is hopefully reading this page) to put up scans of the originals on her website. Btw, there was no "exit counseling" for Barbara, since it was never volontary. "Exit counselling" is by definition voluntary. --<a href="../../../t/i/l/User%7ETilman_2a94.html" title="User:Tilman">Tilman</a> 17:16, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Note that I used the term "involuntary deprogramming". Per se, deprogramming does not mean a kidnapping, although the word is often represented as something illegal, which is why the term "exit counselling" is used today. In the "old" days, Deprogramming could also mean that cult members agreed to talk with a "deprogrammer" hired by the family to hear another side of the story about the cult. Usually the deprogrammer brings an ex-cult member with him. --<a href="../../../t/i/l/User%7ETilman_2a94.html" title="User:Tilman">Tilman</a> 15:41, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>According to Barbara's story, she was illegally detained and abused at a German psychiatric hospital (University of Munich). She gives names of people involved, judges, lawyers, witnesses, etc. She mentions court hearings and cases she has won. So she has won cases, contrary to the previous version of the article that said she has never won a case. Are there any alternative sources to support these claims? --<a href="../../../h/r/e/User%7EHResearcher_0608.html" title="User:HResearcher">HResearcher</a> 06:42, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There are only sources that she did undergo psychiatric treatment in Germany (the Heinemann source I mentioned before, which names a person (Barbara) mentioned without name in a state attorney document about scientology, as an example of a member whose mental condition got bad because of scientology).</dd>
<dd>Germany does not have "public" court records like the US. We can only get the documents through Barbara, her family, her german attorney, or any other people who were involved in these court cases. --07:03, 17 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>According to Barbara's story, she is also the daughter of L Ron Hubbard and lived in a submarine village in Great Salt Lake. She gives names of people involved.

She also claims the lawsuit her friend Richard Scoville lost against the <a href="../../../a/h/b/AHBL_c731.html" title="AHBL">AHBL</a> wasn't dismissed.

<dd>Please don't make assumptions on my intent. This article should not reflect any opinion or bias. As Fred Bauder has stated above, the article should contain just the facts. Key claims Barbara Schwarz have made under oath are that she is L Ron Hubbard's daughter and lived in a submarine village in Great Salt Lake. Any person or agency assessing the charges she makes about others without substantive evidence ought to bear her history of these claims in mind, especially when she accuses other people of criminal acts and activities. In response to you in the section "Remove page?", with regards to your comments on "undeniable meat": the same facts apply here. The article does not need to make a statement on her credibility, as a key point of <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> is <i>Let the facts speak for themselves</i>. As it stands, <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> is being violated by the current article in omitting verifiable sources. <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> states <i>If an allegation or incident is notable, relevant, and well-documented by reliable published sources, it belongs in the article — even if it's negative and the subject dislikes all mention of it.</i> Also: <i>editors should exercise restraint and include only information relevant to their notability.</i> Many references have been removed which have been relevant to her notability because of accusations of negative bias; I repeat: we cannot make a silk purse from a sow's ear. I do not dispute you have found postings from Barbara Schwarz with reference to legal documents, but are they copies or transcripts of the documents, or are they her interpretations of them? As her numerous postings on the Usenet have shown, Barbara Schwarz will mix one or two facts with her own fictitious interpretation and present the result in a manner favorable to her. Please also note you have also previously dismissed the Usenet as being reliable source material, even when this material has been supported by other publications. Do you now propose to allow Barbara Schwarz's recollections posted on the Usenet of the court cases she claims to have won as statements of fact? As a suggestion, it is worth noting in the article that: <i>Although her court challenges in the United States have been dismissed as frivolous, Barbara says she has pursued litigation in Germany with success, including the cases of</i> (cite the material you have found). Adding this statement is NPOV and is more favorable to her than stating only that <i>Schwarz has responded by resorting to litigation, most of which has been dismissed as frivolous</i> as the article curently stands. <a href="../../../o/r/s/User%7EOrsini_2b01.html" title="User:Orsini">Orsini</a> 15:01, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><i>It is quite likely she was subjected to deprogramming at least once; was homeless for extended periods of time; jailed; and institutionalized. In a word, suffered.</i> Fred, if you are willing to accept that her 90+ part story posted to Usenet is authentic (since it was verified by the SLC Tribune and presumably by the subject Ms. Schwarz), then you can mention those facts in the article as long as you say that Ms. Schwarz claims "blah blah blah..." I don't object to having more of her notable quotes about events in her life from being talked about, but I think you'll find that the subject of the article will not be happy with any summary of her story that you can possibly come up with. However I am concerned that you and HResearcher have deleted a number of claims about Ms. Schwarz that are notable and verifiable from news sources. Namely 1) The CoS has specifically disavowed Ms. Schwarz. 2) She is in the country illegally and costing taxpayers thousands of dollars 3) You erased links to a number of lawsuits and hearings that she was involved in, these documents further bolster the claims made by the newspapers. 4) She has sued thousands of people and agencies. Negative information is perfectly acceptable in a <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">biography of a living person</a> when that information is properly sourced to a <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable source</a>.

<dd>Fred cannot singlehandedly make a decision to delete this entire article. He does not own Wikipedia. Mr. Bauder has already stated that he has no intention to delete the article anyway. And I am not the only editor nor admin that has objected to the manner in which Fred has handled himself with his edits to this article. I am warning you not to engage in <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">personal attacks</a> against other editors, HResearcher. It is inappropriate for you to question my motives here. I have no intention to make this an "attack page", I only want to include information that is notable and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a>. And claiming that "USENET" is not a reliable source would only leave you in the strange position of arguing both for and against the inclusion of Ms. Schwarz's own words in this article. Barbara Schwarz's 90+ part story that was posted on USENET has been verified as authentic by Ms. Schwarz and also by the Salt Lake City Tribune. Do you now wish to argue that the story is not acceptable to be quoted here? <a href="../../../v/i/v/User%7EVivaldi_8033.html" title="User:Vivaldi">Vivaldi</a> (<a href="../../../v/i/v/User_talk%7EVivaldi_d6d0.html" title="User talk:Vivaldi">talk</a>) 03:09, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think it would be fine to mention it, although I find it odd that you would think that including her mental health history and history of commitments for insanity would tend to put her in a more favorable light.

This is Ingo Heinemann, attorney and longtime scientology critic (who has spoken out against involontary deprogramming long before the Barbara Schwarz case, but is often attacked by scientology and Schwarz): <i>Offenbar hatte die Mutter den Engländern nicht gesagt, dass ihre Tochter nicht eine beliebige Scientologin war, sondern die frühere Pressesprecherin Barbara Schwarz. Die war während ihrer Tätigkeit bei Scientology psychisch krank geworden und <b>wurde wegen Selbstgefährdung zwangsweise in eine psychiatrische Einrichtung eingewiesen</b>.</i> Summarized: The mother had not told the deprogrammers that Barbara was the former spokesperson and had been put into a psychiatric institution because she was a danger to herself. This is a german issue. So it won't be available in english.

<dd>If you find notable information that is verifiable then it should be included. I've said numerous times that I think her long history and battles with mental illness should be included if they come from verifiable sources. We should also include in the article that Ms. Schwarz has recently been publicly disavowed by the Church of Scientology in her local newspaper. We should also include that she sued the Church of Scientology. We should also mention her status as an illegal alien, wasting thousands of taxpayer dollars with her frivilous and fanciful claims. <a href="../../../v/i/v/User%7EVivaldi_8033.html" title="User:Vivaldi">Vivaldi</a> (<a href="../../../v/i/v/User_talk%7EVivaldi_d6d0.html" title="User talk:Vivaldi">talk</a>) 03:09, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That would be a good question. My reasons for protesting against this article are: 1. She is not very important; there is very little interest in her outside of people who happen to post on the same newsgroups that she does. 2. Because there is very little interest in her the only people who have an interest in the article are people who have something against her; there is no balancing view. 3. Because the article is so one-sided it looks like an attack article. 4. Barbara herself has said that she is hurt by the article. 5. After looking over some of Wikipedia's policies, especially on biographies of living people, it seems to me that this is not the kind of article that is intended to be a part of Wikipedia.<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_Dufour_1d44.html" title="User:Steve Dufour">Steve Dufour</a> 14:27, 19 August 2006 (UTC)

You can talk all you want about what seems to be real to you, but you cannot use your arguments to compose the article. Here is what WP:NOR says about this: <b>Like most Wikipedia policies, No original research applies to articles, not to talk pages or project pages, although it is regarded as poor taste to discuss personal theories on talk pages.</b> <b>Articles may not contain any previously unpublished arguments, concepts, data, ideas, statements, or theories.

<dd>Thank you for the reminder of the policy, and if what you alleged was so, I would agree with you - but it isn't, and so I don't. Evidence of the scientology cult's wishing to disconnect from their former German president is evident in the statement from Linda Simmons Hight, former director of media relations for the cult, who has stated: <i>"We're clueless about this person and obviously she is delusional about Mr. Rathbun and she needs help. We're sorry for her."</i> (source: Smith, Christopher, "S.L. Woman's Quest Strains Public Records System", The Salt Lake Tribune (Payment required), 2003 May 11). The cult claimed not to know her, which is clearly a lie since she'd sued the cult <i>and</i> had been a past German national president. This doesn't makes my observation original research, and I am not suggesting <i>my opinion</i> of that statement is incorporated into the article. I believe the Hight statement supports what I have also stated insofar as the scientology cult wishing to diconnect from Barbara Schwarz. Removal of article category tags, particularly in relation to the <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientology_controversy.html" title="Scientology controversy">Scientology controversy</a>, indicates a bias in favor of the scientology cult; the removal of these tags has opened this article up to be edited by Wikipedia editors who are prohibited from editing articles associated with the <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientology_controversy.html" title="Scientology controversy">Scientology controversy</a>. In my opinion based on observation of events here, there seems to be a fanatical desire to remove this article after three failed AfD discussions initiated by those supporting the aims of the scientology cult, edit wars, and the removal of verifiable source material only because its inclusion does not make the subject appear to be the peer of <a href="../../../m/o/t/Mother_Teresa_71c4.html" title="Mother Teresa">Mother Teresa</a>. <a href="../../../o/r/s/User%7EOrsini_2b01.html" title="User:Orsini">Orsini</a> 04:43, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I disagree. There are many people in Scientology and many people who "have been" presidents of it's churches. This does not make her notable.

That is amazing and the most notable thing about Barbara Schwarz. Also, the deprogramming attempts, is interesting.

<p>A highly notable thing about Barbara Schwarz is her involuntary deprogramming and psychiatric "incarceration" after being the President of the church.

<dd>Her involuntary commitment wasn't notable enough for newspapers to report on it. However her FOIA requests and her lawsuits were notable enough for numerous papers and the Associated Press to write a story about them. I certainly don't object to having this article contain more quotes from Barbara talking about her numerous psychiatric incarcerations and evaluations, but the majority of the article should be reserved for the claims for which we have numerous independent <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> outside sources, namely her numerous lawsuits and FOIA requests. <a href="../../../v/i/v/User%7EVivaldi_8033.html" title="User:Vivaldi">Vivaldi</a> (<a href="../../../v/i/v/User_talk%7EVivaldi_d6d0.html" title="User talk:Vivaldi">talk</a>) 06:53, 21 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Are you sure there hasn't ever been any news articles about it her deprogramming and psychiatric incarceration? What about in Germany? This was back in the late 80's. But news articles are not the only sources to be used in Wikipedia. There are other sources and we discussed this a couple days ago. She is mentioned on the Cyril Vosper articles which gives references, that's where I found one of the references I mentioned. --<a href="../../../h/r/e/User%7EHResearcher_0608.html" title="User:HResearcher">HResearcher</a> 07:15, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm pretty confident of it. Ms. Schwarz seems fairly adept at locating information that exists. But it is silly to argue about something that doesn't exist. No, I can't prove that there weren't any stories written by some source 20 years ago about Ms. Schwarz, or about you, or about invisible nazi psychiatrists that use earplants and killer bees to further their agenda to destroy the universe.

<pre>
In the past this has led to a series of embarrassing and worrying
incidents. In 1987, Cyril Vosper, a Fair committee member, was
convicted in Germany of kidnapping and causing bodily harm to
Barbara Schwarz, a 32-year-old German Scientologist whom he tried
to "de-programme".

<dd>Well, Fred, according to the <i>New York Times</i>, the first Scientologist believed to have received asylum in the United States was Antje Victore in 1997, who was claiming religious persecution in Germany. Catherine Bell in fact introduced Victore before Congress in 2000 as "the first German Scientologist to be granted asylum by a U.S. immigration court on the grounds that she faced ruinous religious persecution if she had to return to Germany". Unfortunately, it was shortly after that that Victore's application was exposed as fraudulent -- of the business owners who had written letters explaining that they could not hire her because she was a Scientologist, at least five were actually <i>themselves</i> Scientologists who had been asked to provide Victore, not with a job (which she had not, in fact, applied for) but for a letter similar to the sample letters Victore provided, pretending that they dared not hire Victore because she was a Scientologist. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 23:39, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>HResearcher, I am afraid you are very greatly misinterpreting Wikipedia's policies. I hope it is accidental. You may, if you wish, <b>ask</b> for sources for things said on a talk page; your idea that nothing may be said "which may <b>affect</b> how we or outside readers may view Barbara Schwarz' status in the United States" <i>(emphasis added)</i> without pre-emptively anticipating the demand for sources is simply without foundation. If all policies affecting article space were to affect the talk pages as well, then Fred would never have been allowed to go into his <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a> speculation, which according to his own claims <i>could not possibly be</i> supported by citations to reliable sources, Barbara "may very well have been granted asylum" and "this may explain her immigration status." Your own blatant bias is, I'm afraid, demonstrated by the fact that you said not a single word about this speculation, which practically jumps up and down and screams "I may affect how we or outside readers may view Barbara Schwarz' status in the United States!!!!" but when I provide detailed information about why Fred's entirely speculated scenario conflicts with known information (and as previously noted, you could have <i>asked</i>, in a <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">CIVIL</a> manner, for sources, and I would have been happy to oblige) you jump down my throat with an irrational demand that I constrict my postings on the talk page according to those policies which affect article space. Perhaps you should attain a greater grasp of Wikipedia policy yourself before you try to use it so one-sidedly. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 13:36, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>However, I find it unlikely that this information could have gone in <i>this</i> article, since the only way it is relevant to the article is in debunking an editor's private speculation that Barbara Schwarz might have been granted asylum, which of course cannot go in the article since that <i>is</i> original research. I would appreciate you withdrawing your false accusation of original research now, rather than trying to perpetuate it with phrases such as "The uncited [...] information which you provided <i>could lead to</i> original research" <i>(emphasis added)</i>. Again, your bias is quite amply shown by the fact that when you read one editor advancing his own speculation, and a second editor providing factual information which rebutted that speculation (admittedly, without source citations, since <i>those are not expected on talk pages</i> unless requested), you misidentified the rebutting factual information as "speculation" and made an unreasonable demand that that poster abide by wide-ranging restrictions not to "make any claims or speculations or arguments which may affect how we or outside readers may view Barbara Schwarz' status in the United States" unless abiding by a policy which specifically states it is <i>not</i> to be applied to article talk pages. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 19:07, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Again, you rely an a weak branch; why take her word even at second-hand?

<dd>As editors, it isn't really our job to wonder why she isn't deported (even if this document <a href="http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/terrorvisa1.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/terrorvisa1.html" rel="nofollow">[25]</a> shows that some people aren't very awake), only whether she is an illegal or not.

<dd>Her US citizenship status is uncertain, at best. An earlier version of the article said she was a <i>"German citizen living in Salt Lake City"</i>. If <i>The Chatanooga Factors</i> in her statements are ignored, Paragraph 83 of her Salt Lake Tribune lawsuit <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/alt.religion.scientology/msg/d89a09147bf034b1" class="external autonumber" title="http://groups.google.com/group/alt.religion.scientology/msg/d89a09147bf034b1" rel="nofollow">[26]</a> states she denies telling anyone she is in the country illegally. In paragraph 120, she admits she has a German birth cerificate. This makes her a German citizen. It appears one version of edits to the article described her as an <i>illegal alien,</i> however that was a inappropriate POV description based on what is known, and a conclusion based on speculation on what remains uncertain. Conclusions based on speculations, even if they are logical conclusions, don't belong in the article. <a href="../../../o/r/s/User%7EOrsini_2b01.html" title="User:Orsini">Orsini</a> 22:29, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>HResearcher, do you consider the SLC Tribune article an unreliable source only because it fails to turn the sow's ear into a silk purse? I remind you again of <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> policy: <i>If an allegation or incident is notable, relevant, and well-documented by reliable published sources, it belongs in the article — even if it's negative and the subject dislikes all mention of it.</i> The Tribune article was the subject of Schwarz's libel lawsuit against the newspaper, and it was thrown out of both the trial court, and on appeal. From the appeal court decision: <i>Because <b>we conclude that all of Plaintiff's claims are without merit,</b> none of her claims could possibly proceed to trial.</i> (emphasis added) <a href="http://www.utcourts.gov/opinions/mds/schwarz050505.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.utcourts.gov/opinions/mds/schwarz050505.htm" rel="nofollow">Schwarz v. Salt Lake Tribune, Media Newsgroup, ET AL Case No. 20030981-CA , COURT OF APPEALS OF UTAH , May 5, 2005</a>. The Tribune article underwent the scrutiny of courts of law on two occasions; given this level of attention to that article, why do you consider it to be unreliable source? Also <a href="../../../v/i/v/User%7EVivaldi_8033.html" title="User:Vivaldi">User:Vivaldi</a> raised the paradox of your selective sourcing of the Usenet material before in the section on <i>Involuntary psychiatric treatment</i> when you dismissed the Usenet as a source, and you have not replied to the points Vivaldi raised there. <a href="../../../o/r/s/User%7EOrsini_2b01.html" title="User:Orsini">Orsini</a> 04:18, 29 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I am not the only one who thinks the SLCT article is unreliable. Fred Bauder has also stated that it is biased. Are there any other reliable third-party published sources to support claims of her status here in the U.S? That's what this discussion thread is about. If you'd like to discuss the <i>Involuntary psychiatric treatment</i> then please do so in the appropriate thread to avoid arguing things over &amp; over. Note that in that thread I stated that I am working on getting sources, until then mention of the <i>Involuntary psychiatric treatment</i> is not supported for entry into the the article. --<a href="../../../h/r/e/User%7EHResearcher_0608.html" title="User:HResearcher">HResearcher</a> 04:37, 29 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Claiming that the SLC Tribune article is biased is original research that is not supported by any evidence whatsoever. Are there any verifiable sources that have said the article is biased? If so, then please add that information to the article and cite your sources. Otherwise, you are falling into the same trap as Bauder. You want to remove <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> information using unsourced claims of bias. It isn't up to editors to discern "the Truth". The standard for inculusion in Wikipedia is not "Truth" at all, it is verifiability.

<dd>HResearcher, the matter of <i>Involuntary psychiatric treatment</i> isn't being discussed by me in this thread; the matter I am discussing here is the reliability of source data meeting <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> standards. Specifically, the Salt Lake Tribune article which you do not consider reliable source data, and the paradox in your dismissal of the Usenet as a source, to which <a href="../../../v/i/v/User%7EVivaldi_8033.html" title="User:Vivaldi">User:Vivaldi</a> pointed to in that thread. Your willingness to accept her 90+ part autobiography posted on the Usenet, yet dismiss other articles on the Usenet, and also dismiss a published media article that has undergone court scrutiny appears to be a paradox. With regards to her immigration status, any discussion is pure speculation for the reasons Fred Bauder has stated before. You are wrong in stating the article is not a reliable source, and you are wrong to dismiss the article's factual data as unreliable because you don't consider the article was complimentary to Schwarz, despite most of the data within it being independently verifiable by other sources. <a href="../../../o/r/s/User%7EOrsini_2b01.html" title="User:Orsini">Orsini</a> 06:45, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Fred Bauder writes, "<i>Nevertheless, there is obviously no interest in deporting her. We do have some problems with enforcement of immigration laws, but such a notorious troublemaker would have been deported if she was illegal.</i>" My response: There are 10-15 million illegal aliens in this country. ICE concentrates on evicting the ones that are convicted of felonies, gang-related crimes, and drug-related crimes. Petty thiefs like Ms. Schwarz are not a top priority for the ICE. Ms. Schwarz is admittedly an illegal alien. She admits that she is subject to deportation. She admittedly has a German birth-certificate. Numerous judges and justices have referred to her status as a German citizen as recently as 2 years ago. Your idle speculation that she may have been granted asylum does not deserve a place in this article. You could perhaps say that "Ms. Schwarz claims that she was granted asylum" IF that were true, but that isn't true. Ms. Schwarz has never claimed that she was granted asylum or citizenship. She has claimed that she was born in the U.S., but those claims are only substantiated by her memory. The reason her immigration status is important to this article is the same reason it was important when the newspaper discussed it. People in the U.S. especially are concerned that illegal immigrants, like Ms. Schwarz, are wasting taxpayer funds with their abusive FOIA requests and frivilous pro-se lawsuits. I don't care if this information is "prominently featured" as you claim all editors here insist on. I do however want notable information that is properly sourced to be included in the article and so the discussion of her immigration status is appropriate. <a href="../../../v/i/v/User%7EVivaldi_8033.html" title="User:Vivaldi">Vivaldi</a> (<a href="../../../v/i/v/User_talk%7EVivaldi_d6d0.html" title="User talk:Vivaldi">talk</a>) 04:19, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Why are you bringing up this subject of asylum, that discussion ended days ago and most of us agreed that it was original research and we shouldn't even be discussing it. And, your statements seem to be original research, you haven't provided any source that claims any reason of the importance of her status in the United States.

It holds no more water than claiming that Ms. Schwarz was spawned by invisible pink unicorns. I respect Fred Bauder as an editor, but I'm under no obligation to agree with all of his decisions.

<dd>If you can get the Salt Lake City Tribune to write an article that says they interviewed Ms. Schwarz and she admitted to writing under the name HResearcher at a specific place on the Internet, then the answer is "yes". Works that are verifiably by the subject of the article are allowed in articles, even if they are available on Usenet. Obviously, Usenet by itself isn't a great source of information, but when we have a statement by Ms. Schwarz admitting that she wrote the series...and that statement is published in a reliable and reputable newspaper, then it meets the qualifications for inclusion. In any case, you need to take it up with Fred Bauder, since he is the admin and arbcom member that thought is was appropriate to include the authors own verifiable statements in the article as a partial effort to maintain neutrality, rather than previous versions that neglected using her own written words. <a href="../../../v/i/v/User%7EVivaldi_8033.html" title="User:Vivaldi">Vivaldi</a> (<a href="../../../v/i/v/User_talk%7EVivaldi_d6d0.html" title="User talk:Vivaldi">talk</a>) 23:25, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well, there is some duplication in the list, and it does need a clean-up, but it seems that the list is rather long and distracts from the article itself. That is why I was thinking in terms of a sub-page rather than in the main line.</p>
<p>Also, many of the entries were added just before the great war started, and do not have links to the source documents, something that should be fixed if there are on-line versions available. (Not all courts have their documents available via the internet.)</p>
<p>I'm not sure if the list should be alphabetic, or ordered by date of initial action (if known.) <a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESuper7_252b.html" title="User:Super7">Super 7 - Everything else is just transport</a> 21:06, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sorting the list by dates may be confusing, as could sorting the cases in alphabetical order as some of the cases inter-relate. For example, a case may go from the trial court, to the appeals court, to the circuit court, then finally to the <a href="../../../s/c/o/SCOTUS_92d6.html" title="SCOTUS">SCOTUS</a>, which is also why some entries appear to be duplicated. A combination of alphabetical and cases might be appropriate, but listing the cases strictly in chronological order overlooks how a particular case may have run through several courts over a period of years. <s>Please also note the Utah courts don't have an internet lookup system for dockets as yet.</s> <a href="../../../o/r/s/User%7EOrsini_2b01.html" title="User:Orsini">Orsini</a> 22:33, 26 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd><i>"Why clutter up the place with a big list of cases that only support editors who have already shown they intend to spread the</i> rumor <i>that Barbara only loses case?"</i> My goodness. You call the mountain of evidence showing nothing but losses "a rumor"? Even Ms. Schwarz does not claim to have won a case in the U.S., so why would you make it seem like there is some possibility that she has? In any case, we can say that in the over 80+ cases that we do know about, she has lost them all. Let the reader decide what that means. If there are any wins, even Ms. Schwarz is unaware of them. <a href="../../../v/i/v/User%7EVivaldi_8033.html" title="User:Vivaldi">Vivaldi</a> (<a href="../../../v/i/v/User_talk%7EVivaldi_d6d0.html" title="User talk:Vivaldi">talk</a>) 05:51, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It would be more accurate to state that Schwarz has lost every case she has filed in the United States; go through that list, look at the case summaries. <i>She claims</i> she's won cases in Germany. <i>She claims</i> also to have lived in a submarine base under Great Salt Lake as a child.

<dd>Orsini, stop using original research. You have no source that says she has lost every case filed in the United States. You are basing your speculation entirely on the some cases that are known of, while forgetting that there could be cases you are not aware of. That is <i>original research</i>. Note, I will be applying WP:BLP and removing every statement you make make about Schwarz which you do not support with citation. --<a href="../../../h/r/e/User%7EHResearcher_0608.html" title="User:HResearcher">HResearcher</a> 23:35, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm fairly sure you've made a mis-statement there. The Church of Scientology might have been seen by some people in the past (especially in the German Government) as being hostile, in recent years the German Government has quit investigating every Scientologist they can find, every E-meter they can lay their hands on, every piece of Church promo litature that is passed out, etc. etc. etc. The Church quit resisting to the degree the government quit harrassing, heh. <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerryeo_a180.html" title="User:Terryeo">Terryeo</a> 16:44, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>So this is what Robert Vaughn Young described as "handling"? Ontopic or not, to answer Terryeo: officially, <i>The German government considers the Scientology organization a commercial enterprise with a history of taking advantage of vulnerable individuals and an extreme dislike of any criticism. The government is also concerned that the organization's totalitarian structure and methods may pose a risk to Germany's democratic society. Several kinds of evidence have influenced this view of Scientology, including the organization's activities in the United States.</i> In addition: <i>Scientology has waged an aggressive campaign against Germany. Using full-page ads in the New York Times and the Washington Post that began in October 1996, the Scientology organization has compared the treatment of Scientologists in present-day Germany with that of the Jews under the Nazi regime. This is not only a distortion of the facts, but also an insult to the victims of the Holocaust. Officials in Germany and the U.S. have repeatedly spoken out against this blatant misuse of the Holocaust.</i> It continues: <i>In its ads and writings, the Scientology organization claims it is internationally recognized as a religion, except in Germany. This is false.</i> Further: <i>In its campaign to discredit Germany, Scientology uses the tactic of supplying only incomplete information to back up its claims, making it extremely difficult for the German government to research and respond to charges.</i> Source: <a href="http://www.germany.info/relaunch/info/archives/background/scientology.html" class="external text" title="http://www.germany.info/relaunch/info/archives/background/scientology.html" rel="nofollow">German Embassy, Washington DC: Understanding the German View of Scientology</a>. I'm fairly sure there's been no mis-statement there by <i>me</i>; it is clear there has been an orchestrated campaign of hostility against the German administration by the scientology cult. Claims of governmental persecution of cult members are questionable. For example, the claims "religious refugee" Antje Victore was being "harassed" by the German government have been proven to be fraudulent. In the cult's claims of her "persecution", it omitted the fact of Victore's debts, and the pending trial of Karl-Erich Heilig, a senior member of the scientology cult, where Victore would be called to give testimony had she remained in Germany for his tax evasion prosecution. How convenient that all of her rejection of employment letters due to her scientologist background from Germany were written in English, ready for presentation to US immigration and the court in Clearwater, Florida. Was the fact these rejection letters were written by members of the scientology cult merely a superfluous detail? It's clear the cult wanted Victore out of Germany, beyond the reach of a subpoena. How inconvenient though that <i>Stern</i> exposed this textbook example of fraud in the "religious persecution by the government" claim by the scientology cult of its disciples in Germany, in an article published on June 29, 2000. Terryeo, these persecution claims appear to be <i>Chatanooga</i>, so please do not falsely accuse me of making “mis-statements”. It seems to me that cult sympathizers are trying to pull a version of this scam here with unsubstantiated claims of Schwarz’s “unlawful" psychiatric incarceration "by the German government".

<dd>This is beginning to look like the Chinese govt. vs. Falun Gong disputes. The Chinese government also makes such statements. It's a propaganda war. The U.S. State Department has pointed out violations of freedom of religion by both Germany and China. Freedom of religion is a basic human right, governments are out of line in determining what people can and cannot choose as their religion. There may always be problems within religions but pointing out those specific instances to just justify the wholesale condemnation of a religion is a violation of human rights. It is wrong and evil for any goverment to use psychiatric detainment and involuntary "treatment" against individuals who choose to fight for their religious freedom. That is what the Chinese government has doing to the Falun Gong and that is what Germany did to Barbara Schwarz. --<a href="../../../h/r/e/User%7EHResearcher_0608.html" title="User:HResearcher">HResearcher</a> 02:12, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Linda Simmons Hight, a spokesperson for the Church, claimed just a few years ago that the Church knew nothing of Ms. Schwarz and called her delusional. This was well after the fact of Ms. Schwarz being president of CoS Germany. When you are expulsed from the Church that you love and the Church's spokespeople disown you, that is called "disconnection".

<dd>Linda Simmons Hight, made no mention of disconnection. Claiming the church wishes to disconnect from Barbara Schwarz is Orsini's original research and Vivaldi agrees with her. Orsini and Vivaldi have "consensus" but no clear reference. --<a href="../../../h/r/e/User%7EHResearcher_0608.html" title="User:HResearcher">HResearcher</a> 15:50, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Mark Rathbun, the former Inspector General of RTC and leader of Scientology, is the man she is looking for. That is why she sued CoS. That is why Ms. Hight said she was delusional about Mr. Rathbun. The name should be reinstated in the article. Rathbun is a public figure as well and his "involvement" with Ms. Schwarz is part of the reason she is notable. <a href="../../../v/i/v/User%7EVivaldi_8033.html" title="User:Vivaldi">Vivaldi</a> (<a href="../../../v/i/v/User_talk%7EVivaldi_d6d0.html" title="User talk:Vivaldi">talk</a>) 01:07, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>He had <i>something</i> to do with it. He was specifically mentioned in a lawsuit by Ms. Schwarz who believes him to be her husband. The Church of Scientology itself mentioned Ms. Schwarz and Mr. Rathbun in the same sentence <b>to a newspaper reporter</b>. At the time Mr. Rathbun was the #2 man in all of Scientology, being the Inspector General of <a href="../../../r/t/c/RTC_60d7.html" title="RTC">RTC</a> under <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Miscavige_578d.html" title="David Miscavige">David Miscavige</a>. If CoS didn't have a problem mentioning their leader and Ms. Schwarz for an article in the newspaper, I see no reason why you think Mr. Rathbun should have his name removed from this article. A comparable example would be removing the link to <a href="../../../j/o/d/Jodie_Foster_9072.html" title="Jodie Foster">Jodie Foster</a> from the article about <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Hinckley_b0e4.html" title="John Hinckley">John Hinckley</a>.

Neither Ms. Foster nor His Excellency wanted the attention tossed at them by these former unknowns. Mr. Rathbun is (if he's still alive) a public figure. His position as a leader of Scientology made him an object of obsession for Ms. Schwarz as evidenced by the many thousands of FOIA requests and lawsuits that she filed trying to find him. His name should be reinserted into the article. <a href="../../../v/i/v/User%7EVivaldi_8033.html" title="User:Vivaldi">Vivaldi</a> (<a href="../../../v/i/v/User_talk%7EVivaldi_d6d0.html" title="User talk:Vivaldi">talk</a>) 02:09, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Jodie Foster isn't dead either. Look, WP:BLP says that unsourced negative information about living people may be removed. The fact that Marty Rathbun figures in Schwarz's delusions <i>isn't</i> unsourced and while it might be uncomfortable to Rathbun that the situation <b>exists</b>, it isn't negative to him to report on its existence. I'm trying to give every benefit of the doubt but I still have trouble understanding how it <i>could</i> be seriously argued that the name of a public figure should be removed until -- until what? Until Rathbun steps forward and admits that he <i>is</i> Schwarz's husband? Fred said that he was removing the name because we have "no credible evidence of the involvement of this innocent person", but the only way Rathbun could be <i>more</i> involved in the matter of Schwarz's claims regarding him is if he stepped forward to confirm them. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 18:17, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I would agree that it certainly is not negative in the least, and in any case, could be viewed as positive for Mr. Rathbun. It shows that he was an important enough figure within the organization to be the target of Ms Schwarz's fantasy despite no prior relationship. And, yes they could have met in their lives, but I also met and spoke with L. Ron Hubbard, but that does not mean there was any sort of "relationship". Chance and casual meetings happen all the time. It also adds to the fact that Ms. Schwarz has a history of selecting [in]famous people to weave into her stories. She also claims that Hubbard and Eisenhower were replaced by imposters and that the ones we know are not "the real ones." <a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESuper7_252b.html" title="User:Super7">Super 7 - Everything else is just transport</a> 11:56, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Bauder writes, <i>"But Ms Schwarz could have picked almost anyone. What if she had picked you? Hubbard and Eisenhower are dead. Mark Rathbun is not."</i> Hinckley and Ağca could have picked anybody as well, but they picked public notable figures, just like Ms. Schwarz. Rathbun wouldn't have been chosen as an object of desire if he wasn't one of the leaders of Scientology. In any case, his name is an important part of the story. Ms. Schwarz is now inextricably linked to Mr. Rathbun through presumably no fault of his own. However, just because Mr. Rathbun is "innocent", doesn't mean that Wikipedia should bury its head in the sand. It is verifiable that Rathbun has a woman that is stalking him and it should be reported here just as it was in the Salt Lake Tribune and in numerous lawsuits and even in U.S Appeals court opinions. This is public knowledge about notable public people. There is no excuse to excise Rathbun's name from the article. <a href="../../../v/i/v/User%7EVivaldi_8033.html" title="User:Vivaldi">Vivaldi</a> (<a href="../../../v/i/v/User_talk%7EVivaldi_d6d0.html" title="User talk:Vivaldi">talk</a>) 01:23, 1 September 2006 (UTC)

Readers can make their own conclusions as to why the scientology cult would state officially about their former German president: <i>"We're clueless about this person".</i> Readers are then free to examine allegations of how the scientology cult disconnects from its former members, if they wish. We are reporting the verifiable fact that the cult officially made this statement in relation to Barbara Schwarz, in the same way President Bush officially made this statement in relation to the presence of WMDs in Iraq; does the fact none were ever found mean that statement should never be cited? <a href="../../../o/r/s/User%7EOrsini_2b01.html" title="User:Orsini">Orsini</a> 15:59, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>HResearcher writes, <i>"So basically, this Linda Simmons Hight person is an unreliable source, yet you think we should still use her statement just because it can be cited?"</i> Absolutely don't think she is an "unreliable source". Ms. Hight was acting as a member of the Church of Scientology and a paid spokesperson for the Church when she made her comments that were intended to published in a newspaper about Ms. Schwarz. In any case, if you want to suggest that Ms. Hight is unreliable then you need to provide a source that says she is not a reliable person or a source that says she was not acting under the authority of the Church of Scientology. We already have a newspaper article where she was quoted talking about Ms. Schwarz. That is verifiable information and it is appropriate for this article. <a href="../../../v/i/v/User%7EVivaldi_8033.html" title="User:Vivaldi">Vivaldi</a> (<a href="../../../v/i/v/User_talk%7EVivaldi_d6d0.html" title="User talk:Vivaldi">talk</a>) 20:57, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
