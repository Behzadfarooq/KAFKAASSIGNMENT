<p>Shamrock was <a href="../../../s/t/r/Stringer_Bell_8a79.html" title="Stringer Bell">Stringer Bell</a>'s second in command while <a href="../../../a/v/o/Avon_Barksdale_e5e8.html" title="Avon Barksdale">Avon Barksdale</a> was in prison and oversaw the technical aspects of the drug operation on his behalf. Stringer sounds out his loyalty by having him followed on a trip to Philadelphia to collect a package of drugs, along with <a href="../../../b/o/d/Bodie_Broadus_1278.html" title="Bodie Broadus">Bodie Broadus</a>. The package is not delivered correctly, but Shamrock and Bodie keep to Stringer's orders and meticulously documented his progress, and Stringer is satisfied with their response.</p>
<p>Stringer entrusts Shamrock with driving Bodie to dispose of the weapons used in a misguided territory war after a young child was killed by a stray bullet. Unfortunately Bodie drops the bag of guns onto a passing freight ship instead of into the water. Little comes of it because Bodie had wiped the weapons clean of prints.</p>
<p>Stringer entrusts Shamrock with the set-up of <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_from_The_Wire_9268.html#Dwight_Tilghman" title="List of characters from The Wire">CO Dwight Tilghman</a> to allow Avon to exchange information about Tilghman with the prison authorities for an early parole hearing. Stringer, Shamrock and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_from_The_Wire_9268.html#Country" title="List of characters from The Wire">Country</a> follow Tilghman and learn that he smuggles heroin from <a href="../../../o/m/a/Omar_Little_and_Associates_27ba.html#Butchie" title="Omar Little and Associates">Butchie</a> into the prison. Stringer has Shamrock deliver a package of tainted narcotics to Tilghman through Butchie, causing several deaths in the prison. Shamrock also plants narcotics in Tilghman's car to make sure Avon could successfully inform on Tilghman.</p>
<p>Shamrock oversees Stringer's organizational meetings at the funeral home and tries to keep to <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert%27s_Rules_of_Order_2bb6.html" title="Robert's Rules of Order">Robert's Rules of Order</a>. He tries to keep minutes at the first meeting of the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Day_Co-Op_cead.html" title="New Day Co-Op">New Day Co-Op</a>, a group of major Baltimore drug players; Stringer curtly reminds him that he is taking notes on a criminal conspiracy.</p>
<p>Stringer uses Shamrock to insulate himself from the street; Shamrock takes phone calls on Stringer's behalf, then organizes face to face meetings at secure locations. Stringer put Shamrock in charge of overseeing <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barksdale_Organization_37fd.html#Bernard" title="Barksdale Organization">Bernard</a> in obtaining disposable cell phones used by the organization. Stringer insisted that Bernard buy a maximum of two phones from any one outlet. Once Shamrock takes over, he stops checking up on Bernard and Bernard begins to buy phones in bulk from <a href="../../../l/e/s/Lester_Freamon_2523.html" title="Lester Freamon">Lester Freamon</a>, an undercover officer in the Major Case unit investigating Stringer. Freamon is thereby able to supply the Barksdale's crew with pre-wiretapped phones.</p>
<p>When Avon is paroled, Shamrock continues in his role as Stringer's assistant controlling their drug dealing through the lieutenants and crew chiefs. He is peripherally involved in Avon's turf war with <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marlo_Stanfield_d6f5.html" title="Marlo Stanfield">Marlo Stanfield</a>, passing messages back and forth to soldiers. Shamrock is arrested alongside Avon at the end of season three.<sup id="_ref-OCS_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-OCS" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>

<p>Marquis "Bird" Hilton was a foul mouthed soldier in the Barksdale crew who is involved in the brutal murder of <a href="../../../o/m/a/Omar_Little_33fc.html" title="Omar Little">Omar Little</a>'s boyfriend and accomplice <a href="../../../o/m/a/Omar_Little_and_Associates_27ba.html#Brandon" title="Omar Little and Associates">Brandon</a>. As revenge, Omar tells police that Bird murdered a state witness against <a href="../../../d/27/a/D%27Angelo_Barksdale_7446.html" title="D'Angelo Barksdale">D'Angelo Barksdale</a>, as a warning to others not to testify. Because the police need a witness, Omar agrees to falsely testify that he saw Bird shoot Gant with his signature gun. Omar further tells the police they would find Bird taking drugs (which is against <a href="../../../a/v/o/Avon_Barksdale_e5e8.html" title="Avon Barksdale">Barksdale's</a> rules) and that they should be careful, as Bird was reckless. The arrest is made, and which a ballistics report matches Bird's gun to the killing. Bird is beaten for his disrespectful attitude by <a href="../../../k/i/m/Kima_Greggs_8476.html" title="Kima Greggs">Detective Greggs</a>, <a href="../../../c/e/d/Cedric_Daniels_da38.html" title="Cedric Daniels">Lieutenant Daniels</a>, and <a href="../../../j/a/y/Jay_Landsman_%28The_Wire%29_9f09.html" title="Jay Landsman (The Wire)">Sergeant Landsman</a>.

<p>Wintell "Little Man" Royce was a heavyset soldier in the Barksdale crew, responsible for enforcing their regime at the Franklin towers, mainly Tower 221. With <a href="../../../w/e/e/Wee-Bey_Brice_446b.html" title="Wee-Bey Brice">Wee-Bey Brice</a>, he is involved in the shooting of <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barksdale_Organization_37fd.html#Wendell_.22Orlando.22_Blocker" title="Barksdale Organization">"Orlando"</a> and specifically shot <a href="../../../k/i/m/Kima_Greggs_8476.html" title="Kima Greggs">Detective Greggs</a> because he is surprised by her presence. <a href="../../../s/t/r/Stringer_Bell_8a79.html" title="Stringer Bell">Stringer Bell</a> decides that, with the police cracking down on them because an officer has been shot, they would be better off without the unreliable Little Man, and Wee-Bey kills him. The murder occurs offscreen, but Wee-Bey later tells the police where to find Little Man's body as part of his confession.</p>

After the Barksdale crew realizes Orlando is cooperating with the police, Savino meets with Orlando and has him drive, with Greggs in the car posing as a dancer from his club.

(Savino tried to signal them about her presence but they were unable to see him because it was night time.)

Attorney <a href="../../../m/a/u/Maurice_Levy_%28The_Wire%29_1cce.html" title="Maurice Levy (The Wire)">Maurice Levy</a> makes the argument that Savino was intending to provide Orlando with baking soda instead of cocaine, and that he was unconnected to the shooting, and Savino is expected to receive only a three year sentence.</p>

<p>Anton "Stinkum" Artis was a lieutenant and enforcer in the Barksdale crew, responsible for making re-supplies from the crew's base at the Franklin Towers to their territory in the low-rise projects, known as "The Pit". He is robbed during one such delivery by stick-up man <a href="../../../o/m/a/Omar_Little_33fc.html" title="Omar Little">Omar Little</a>, later taking part in the brutal killing of Omar's boyfriend and accomplice <a href="../../../o/m/a/Omar_Little_and_Associates_27ba.html#Brandon" title="Omar Little and Associates">Brandon</a> in retribution. Stinkum is set to be a central piece of the Barksdale detail's case as their investigation progressed, amassing much evidence of him performing various illegal acts. The police seizes the resupply from his subordinate Kevin Johnston, but allow Stinkum to go free to avoid arousing suspicion about their surveillance methods. After being promoted by <a href="../../../a/v/o/Avon_Barksdale_e5e8.html" title="Avon Barksdale">Avon Barksdale</a>, Stinkum is killed by Omar, as revenge for Brandon.

<p>Wallace was a young drug dealer in the Barksdale crew's low rise projects organization (called "The Pit"). He serves with <a href="../../../p/o/o/Poot_Carr_d5d7.html" title="Poot Carr">Poot Carr</a> and <a href="../../../b/o/d/Bodie_Broadus_1278.html" title="Bodie Broadus">Bodie Broadus</a> under <a href="../../../d/27/a/D%27Angelo_Barksdale_7446.html" title="D'Angelo Barksdale">D'Angelo Barksdale</a> through the entirety of season one. He shows the signs of a half-finished education - he could identify famous people on currency better than the rest of his crew but sometimes struggled with the math of dealing. He also takes responsibility for his numerous younger siblings in the projects, packing their lunches, seeing them off to school and helping them with their homework. He betrays his age when he is found playing with toys while supposed to be on lookout duty.</p>
<p>After <a href="../../../o/m/a/Omar_Little_33fc.html" title="Omar Little">Omar Little</a> robs the pit crew's stash of drugs, Wallace spots his accomplice <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_from_The_Wire_9268.html#Brandon" title="List of characters from The Wire">Brandon</a> playing pinball and called this information in. <a href="../../../s/t/r/Stringer_Bell_8a79.html" title="Stringer Bell">Stringer Bell</a> grabs Brandon and has him tortured to death. His body is left on display, coincidentally outside of Wallace's home. Wallace receives a quarter of the $2000 bounty on Brandon's head, but is so sickened by the event that he decides he wants out of "the game". He approaches D'Angelo and tells him he wants to go back to school. D'Angelo gives him his blessing and some cash. Poot discovers that Wallace has spent the money on drugs and was spending most of his time at home.</p>
<p>Wallace is picked up by the police and agrees to cooperate with the Barksdale detail, revealing Stringer's involvement in the killing of Omar's boyfriend Brandon. In order to keep him safe until the trial, Wallace is sent to live with his grandmother in rural <a href="../../../c/a/m/Cambridge%2C_Maryland_aacf.html" title="Cambridge, Maryland">Cambridge</a>. After detective <a href="../../../k/i/m/Kima_Greggs_8476.html" title="Kima Greggs">Kima Greggs</a> is shot in an undercover operation, the detail becomes so preoccupied with her condition that Wallace is temporarily forgotten. Bored with life away from Baltimore, he returns to the low-rise projects and asks to get involved in the trade again. Stringer Bell becomes suspicious of Wallace's return. D'Angelo tries to reassure Stringer of Wallace's loyalty, but Stringer is not convinced and assign Bodie to kill Wallace. Bodie and Poot get him cornered, and Wallace begs for mercy because of their friendship. Bodie works up the nerve to shoot Wallace, and Poot took the gun and finished him off.</p>
<p>D'Angelo is outraged when he learns of Wallace's death. It is one of the main factors that lead D'Angelo to want to leave "the game" himself, and it drives a permanent wedge between he and Stringer.</p>
<p>Creator <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Simon_0c5b.html" title="David Simon">David Simon</a> has described Wallace as an emotional center to the show's first season and praised Jordan's performance, saying that he was sorry the character had to leave but that the story comes first. Simon sees the character as an illustration of the adage "a 14 year old drug dealer is still 14."<sup id="_ref-Target_Commentary_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Target_Commentary" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>

<p>Orlando acted as a front operator for the Barksdale crew and ran their strip club, Orlando's.

<p>Shardene was a dancer at Orlando's, who deliberately ignored the immoral activity in the club because she wanted to make quick money. Her first meeting with <a href="../../../d/27/a/D%27Angelo_Barksdale_7446.html" title="D'Angelo Barksdale">D'Angelo Barksdale</a> did not go well, but she soon agreed to go out with him.

D'Angelo had told her the girl was taken to a hospital following an overdose at a party; in reality, she had (unbeknownst to him) been left to die, wrapped in a carpet, and dumped by <a href="../../../w/e/e/Wee-Bey_Brice_446b.html" title="Wee-Bey Brice">Wee-Bey Brice</a>. She felt betrayed by D'Angelo, and agreed to try to help the police however she safely could.</p>
<p>Shardene moved out of D'Angelo's place soon after this. Kima and Freamon wired her with a microphone, and she attempted to get close to Barksdale's conversations with little success. Frightened, Shardene begged to be allowed to stop, but Freamon persuaded her to help them determine the floorplan of the club so they could install a hidden camera in <a href="../../../a/v/o/Avon_Barksdale_e5e8.html" title="Avon Barksdale">Avon Barksdale</a>'s office, which ultimately led them to catch Avon incriminating himself on video.</p>
<p>Freamon and Shardene grew close during the investigation, and by season two, they were sharing an apartment. Though she is no longer a stripper, she is able to help put the detectives in touch with some dancers when they were investigating the deaths of girls involved in the sex trade.</p>

<p>Brianna Barksdale is <a href="../../../d/27/a/D%27Angelo_Barksdale_7446.html" title="D'Angelo Barksdale">D'Angelo's</a> mother and <a href="../../../a/v/o/Avon_Barksdale_e5e8.html" title="Avon Barksdale">Avon's</a> sister. Brianna grew up in Western Baltimore and her family has always been involved in the drug trade. With her brother Avon controlling narcotics on the Westside Brianna acts as an advisor and helps to manage their profits and receives a healthy income, nice home and new car for her efforts. She raised her son to manage the tough streets and got him working in the family business as soon as he was old enough. D'Angelo was quickly made a lieutenant in Avon's operation despite some misgivings. She first appears bringing food to D'Angelo at work. Later she is fiercely protective of her son when he is arrested for drug trafficking, insisting that Avon was in the wrong for sending him to pick up narcotics. Her brother promises to do everything he could to help D'Angelo.</p>
<p>When D'Angelo is ready to turn against his family, Brianna visits him and changes his mind, convincing him to accept a lengthy prison sentence to protect Avon. When D'Angelo once more begins to withdraw from his family in prison, Brianna visits him to try and talk him around. This time D'Angelo insists that he did not want to see her any more. When D'Angelo appears to have committed suicide in the prison, Brianna is distraught. She is comforted by her brother's second-in-command <a href="../../../s/t/r/Stringer_Bell_8a79.html" title="Stringer Bell">Stringer Bell</a>, the man who had actually ordered D'Angelo's death. Brianna argues with Avon to allow Stringer to manage their business his way while Avon is imprisoned.</p>
<p>When Avon is released, she continues to advise both men. After <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimmy_McNulty_a94e.html" title="Jimmy McNulty">Jimmy McNulty</a>, having done independent policework, told <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barksdale_Organization_37fd.html#Donette" title="Barksdale Organization">Donette</a> that there is a chance D'Angelo had been murdered, Donette passed the information on to Brianna. Brianna, suspicious, meets with McNulty and is convinced by the evidence. She asks Avon, indirectly at first, if he ordered D'Angelo's killing. He truthfully denies any involvement (although Stringer has, by this point, admitted to Avon that he ordered the murder). Brianna is not convinced and begins to hold Avon responsible for D'Angelo's death.</p>
<p>Brianna is left at the helm of what remains of the Barksdale empire when Avon is arrested and Stringer is killed. She is responsible for distributing their funds to family members of crew members in prison. For example she pays for De'Londa Brice to raise <a href="../../../w/e/e/Wee-Bey_Brice_446b.html" title="Wee-Bey Brice">Wee-Bey</a>'s son, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_from_The_Wire_9268.html#Namond_Brice" title="List of characters from The Wire">Namond</a>. She eventually decides to cut off the families, rationalizing that she has no further income, and no need to protect Avon because of the rift in their relationship. She calls Namond and De'Londa to her home to give them the news and tries to make sure that Namond knows that his mother has received more than enough to live on already.<sup id="_ref-OCS_3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-OCS" title="">[1]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-BB_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-BB" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>

<p>De'Londa is the mother of <a href="../../../n/a/m/Namond_Brice_f5ec.html" title="Namond Brice">Namond Brice</a>. Namond’s father <a href="../../../w/e/e/Wee-Bey_Brice_446b.html" title="Wee-Bey Brice">Wee-Bey Brice</a> is incarcerated for multiple homicides. De'Londa raises her son using funds from the criminal organization Wee-Bey worked for and she holds Wee-Bey in high regard as a male role model for Namond. She actively encourages him to get involved in Baltimore's drug trade and uses Wee-Bey's contacts to get him work.</p>
<p>De'Londa owns her own home and spends a relatively large amount on clothes and jewellery compared to her neighbours. She ensures that Namond always wears expensive clothes even when he has misbehaved. De'Londa enjoys regular shopping trips to New York and visits to Atlantic City while leaving Namond to care for himself.</p>
