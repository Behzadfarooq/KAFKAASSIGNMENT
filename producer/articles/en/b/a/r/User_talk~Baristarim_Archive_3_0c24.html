<h2><span class="mw-headline">Request of assistance for vandal user behaviour by Khoikhoi</span></h2>
<p>Could the administation and users take an independent look for the following reversal of useful and pertinent contributions at the Mustafa Kemal Ataturk site please? It is very difficult for me not to interpret the revision by Khoikhoi as disrespectful vandalism and disruptive behaviour. More I studied his log history at various article related to the Turkish subjects and prior bans for the same disruptive behaviour, more concerned I became. Could someone help revert the edits he damaged and request him to be more respectful to others' work? Thank you.</p>

<p>Hey man, how's it hanging?&#160;:-) Welcome back BTW. I just made the edit because that's what the article said for awhile, until it was recently changed. <a href="http://66.201.122.226/weekly/ayaz/20010105.htm" class="external text" title="http://66.201.122.226/weekly/ayaz/20010105.htm" rel="nofollow">This article</a>, for example, says "<i>Ataturk drank to excess and liked amorous company</i>". I know he wasn't an alcoholic, but I don't think it's a huge deal even if he was. For example, <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winston_Churchill_74d2.html" title="Winston Churchill">Winston Churchill</a>, <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_F._Kennedy_9798.html" title="John F. Kennedy">John F.

As for the debate, I don't think we should have a section titled, "opinions on genocide". Rather, we should create a (neutral) criticism section and add the stuff there, among other things What do you think? <tt class="plainlinks"><a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhoikhoi_b62f.html" title="User:Khoikhoi">Khoi</a><a href="../../../k/h/o/User_talk%7EKhoikhoi_f6d5.html" title="User talk:Khoikhoi">khoi</a></tt> 02:30, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Re:Turkish President</span></h2>
<p>Thanks for the info! Not that complicated... i got it:). the turkish president has in education more privillages than he has on other fields, e.g. economy. btw, i suddenly remembered what the other field is: the law. politics are complicated, not only in Turkey, but generally in states where the head of state and the head of the government is not the same person (as it is in France and the US). in Greece we had a ridiculous incident a couple of years ago: the parliament voted for a law (not an important one), which later was found to be slightly in conflict with an article of the constitution. but the paper had already been handed to the president (Stephanopoulos at that time). so, the President signed it, and then said publicly, that he was obliged by the constitution to sign a law accepted by the majority of the parliament, even though this law was incompatible, and called for the parties to be more careful next time and not bring him in an awkward situation. of course, that law was declared invalid by the parliament the next day... But, the President of Greece has some real special powers, such as the right to dismember the parliament and to proclaim elections, or the right to declare a war. though no president ever used these powers (and, i guess noone will ever use them in the future...). (not to mention the "stupid" english law that if the Queen kills the PM, noone will be blamed for it:p). i have been watching in the news about Erdogan wanting to become president, and what Sezer and the generals say (also, what people were shouting in Etsevit's funeral). i think Turkey will be in a mess if he wil be elected... i hope not! however, for the majority of the Greeks, this does not seem important. i mean that nothing really changed, regardless if Ciller, Etcevit, Erbacan or Erdogan was on power, concerning Greco-Turkish relations. so, we more or less think that an Erdogan as president will be bad for the Turks themselves (we have taken it for granted that this does not really affects us directly).

<dd>Barış, you really gotta calm down man. It's extremely important that you don't let your emotions get the best of you. Take a deep breath and try to relax. When I get frustrated I usually get up from my computer, and do something else. However, it's important that we don't take things too far...&#160;:-( <tt class="plainlinks"><a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhoikhoi_b62f.html" title="User:Khoikhoi">Khoi</a><a href="../../../k/h/o/User_talk%7EKhoikhoi_f6d5.html" title="User talk:Khoikhoi">khoi</a></tt> 04:13, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>What do you want with me? Just because I'm an Armenian, you decide to call me a racist among other things? If anything, you're the racist, in fact, its your government that's been oppressor minorities as they aren't "pure Turkic" whether they be Kurds, Armenians, Jews, Greeks or Greek Cypriots, Assyrians, Arabs, Laz, Zazas, Georgians, Bulgarians, Serbs etc. -- <a href="../../../c/l/e/User%7EClevelander_3c35.html" title="User:Clevelander">Clevelander</a> 04:16, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I am not picking on you because you are Armenian, but your post to my page shows who is a nationalist. Anyone who dares suggest that a group of people should be converted to a religion as if they are some kinda of a lost flock of sheep is racist, whether this suggestion comes from a Turk, Chinese, American or Armenian. How dare you suggest that I am criticizing you because you are Armenian???? That is extremely offending. And instead of arguing ideas you simply say "your govt is doing this, doing that".

<dd>You know, Baristarim, I'm frustrated at you right now for bringing in personal, unrelated talk page discussions into the debate in order to discredit me. But I forgive you and I apologize myself for maybe going off the handle too. I want to work with you and I'd be open to working with you. I'm all for cooperation between Turkish and Armenian editors on Wikipedia. But please try to be respectful of others.

<dd>Sorry for stalking:). This: <i>Anyone who dares suggest that a group of people should be converted to a religion as if they are some kinda of a lost flock of sheep is racist</i>, is correct from one point of view. However, we should not forget the <a href="../../../j/a/n/Janissary.html" title="Janissary">extremely racist</a> and <a href="../../../s/h/a/Sharia.html" title="Sharia">inhuman</a> methods used in the past to convert these people (religiously or ethnically), before saying <i>Anyone who dares suggest this... is racist</i>.

<p>Hey! I didn't block anyone, but I think Karcha's ban should stay. He has proven to have been an extremely disruptive editor, with 90% of his edits being reverts, and the rest being personal attacks. However, I honestly don't care if E104421 is a sockpuppeteer or not; I was just undoing Karcha's edits. <tt class="plainlinks"><a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhoikhoi_b62f.html" title="User:Khoikhoi">Khoi</a><a href="../../../k/h/o/User_talk%7EKhoikhoi_f6d5.html" title="User talk:Khoikhoi">khoi</a></tt> 23:17, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Speaking of {{Turkish History Brief}}, I know that there's some vote stacking going on, and I was just about to report it.

<dd>Ok, I'll keep that in mind. I was just using Erdem as an example, I never said we weren't going to count him. Some of the users that voted had like 5 edits, which is why I said they might be sockpuppets. All I requested is that admins check out the TfD, I never said, "don't count the Turks", or anything like that. As for Karcha, the discussion is ongoing it seems, so I'd rather not take any action until we hear from Dmcdevit. If you can show me any message boards where the template was mentioned, that would be good.</dd>
<dd>Again, I never said there was anything wrong with his opinion, but where do you think he heard about the nomination?

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Try to avoid unnecessary sarcasm</span></h2>
<p>Hi, some users complain that some of your comments are off-topic, unnecessary sarcastic and plainly clutter the official pages. Lets see e.g. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Templates_for_deletion/Log/2006_November_16&amp;diff=88895006&amp;oldid=88894671|this" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Templates_for_deletion/Log/2006_November_16&amp;diff=88895006&amp;oldid=88894671|this" rel="nofollow">this edit of yours</a>. What Gollum has to do with the deletion or keeping of a wikipedia template? Do you imply that you want to kill Tajik or Tajik wants to kill all the Turkish editors? Do you suggest something disrespectful about Tajik? Honestly I do not know what to answer since I probably have not completely understood the joke myself. Wikipedia is not a blog, each page here has a specific purpose, please stay focused on this purpose.

<dd>Thanks, Baristam. I do not threat you with blocks or anything, just try to find some commons points with the Iranians instead of antagonizing them even more. You will make a half-step towards their position, they would make a half-step... Nobody need the situation then the best editors are occupied with the war plans instead of writing the articles.

<dd>This is groundless.. I don't know if as an admin you can see which pages I have on my watchlist, but if you can, you will see that I had all those articles on my watchlist. Please look at my contribution log, I edit and engage in up-keep tasks in many articles.. The fact that I ran into Mardavich doesn't mean that I am wikistalking. I am sorry to say this, but I have better things to do with my time then stalk him.. I have told you before about being aware of this trap: please do not fall for this. I had "Military of Armenia" on my watchlist for months, it had nothing to do with Mardavich. I made a very legitimate edit to that page, please have a look. I guarantee you, I was not stalking him. There are instances where I am contacted by e-mail about certain articles, but none of them are <b>ever</b> person-specific. And I was not contacted by anyone for any of the pages mentioned above. Three coincidental edits doesn't prove the gravity of the charges laid: harassment. I am also having enough of this, blatant blackmail, insults, vote-stacking campaigns.. In any case, just be assured that I was not stalking Mardavich.. I will try to be more carefull about "perceptions" then.. I just would have wished that he had contacted me before to ask me if I was actually doing so. Pff.. Have a good day in any case.
