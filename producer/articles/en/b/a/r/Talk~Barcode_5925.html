<p>no, they are also barcodes. I have clarified the issue of 2-D barcodes since they were perhaps not well understood by the previous authors. <a href="../../../s/b/w/User%7ESbwoodside_37da.html" title="User:Sbwoodside">Sbwoodside</a> 22:37, 19 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>I say Yes, although they are based on the same technology (using black and white to create 0's and 1's), you cannot use a 1D scanner on a 2D barcode. The inherent 2D design is an improvement of the original concept and should have 1D as part of its history. There are multiple 2D symbologies, and I feel enough difference to warrant its own page. Joseadamflores 08:29, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p><br />
So, is a matrix code just one type of 2d barcode, or are all 2d barcodes also matrix codes? This is not very clear, as the matrix code stub more or less dupiclates the 2d barcode section of this article. Either this article needs a lot more work, or we need a proper 2d barcode/matrix code article to help clarify things. Zubari 19:09, 2004 Oct 2 (UTC)</p>
<p>Matrix codes are a subset of 2d barcodes, which are a strict subset of barcodes. So {matrix codes, stacked codes} are members of the set "2d barcodes", I think that those are the two main types of 2d codes. I didn't noticed the <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matrix_code.html" title="Matrix code">matrix code</a> article before; it should more accurately be called "matrix barcode". <a href="../../../s/b/w/User%7ESbwoodside_37da.html" title="User:Sbwoodside">Sbwoodside</a> 21:33, 2 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Symbologies section, Continuous vs. discrete should maybe be reworded? "Abut" is a word I did not know existed (until now&#160;:). It's a bit hard to understand for a non-english speaker.</p>

<p>I suggest that we seriously reduce the external link section. We can link to pages in DMOZ and the Google Directory that list barcode-related sites. The current long list of external links is totally subjective and prone to linkspam. If we list one person's barcode generator, how can we prevent listing all of them? Wikipedia isn't Google. If people want to find free barcode software, they can use Google to search for it.</p>

<p>I am sorry if I've deleted your favorite link. This is not an ideal solution. I'd prefer to get rid of most of the external links, but since there is no apparent support for that, I've just done my best to edit the lists, keeping those links that are useful, and removing those that aren't. I did visit very link before editing to see what was on the target page.</p>
<p>I've removed obvious commercial promotion, links to inferior quality resources, and links to resources that are not unique. Example: If a barcode free barcode font is available on 50 different web sites, do we allow all 50 to list? Of course not. People who want free barcode fonts can easily find them through Google. <a href="../../../j/e/h/User%7EJehochman_26e5.html" title="User:Jehochman">Jehochman</a> 06:49, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Whilst there was a lot of great info in this article, I feel that it seems to flit between extremely basic and extremely technical information, and leaves a lot of questions unanswered for the average reader who is simply interested in learning a bit more about the technology. For example:</p>
<ol>
<li>Does the barcode itself actually store data about the item - or is it purely a reference code for an external database?</li>
<li>Approximately how much information can be stored in an average barcode? Is there a bits-per-inch estimation?</li>
<li>If I was looking to implement barcoding in my business or hobby, how would I decide on a format?</li>

<li>Barcodes are just short pieces of information. How they are used is up to the application. In most applications they would be used as an ID code to look up the information in some sort of database.</li>
<li>There is no "average" barcode. The articles on the individual types of barcodes should include how much information is encoded. e.g the <a href="../../../u/n/i/Universal_Product_Code_4bf3.html" title="Universal Product Code">UPC</a> barcode used worldwide on product packaging "<i>encodes twelve decimal digits</i>".</li>
<li>If you were a business, you probably wouldn't be the one making that decision. You would buy a system from a supplier and let them handle it. For a hobby, that's entirely different. I suggest you start by looking at what barcode readers are available and what codes they can read.</li>

<li>Some barcode symbologies can encode alpha-numeric characters, some are numeric only. Most 1D barcodes store a number that is used in a relational database to lookup other information assigned to that number. So the only information stored in most 1D barcodes is a type of item, or unique identifier number. 2D barcodes on the other hand can store much more data in a fixed space. It is possible to encode much more information in 2D barcodes than a 1D barcode occupying the same space.</li>
<li>A 1D barcode encodes the data using a series of line and spaces of different thickness. Different symbologies use different combinations to encode data. A linear measurement is not an accurate measure of data, because the data is encoded depending on the ratio thinnest line and space and the thickest line and space. So long as that ratio is maintained it does not matter how wide the thinnest line or space is so long as the other lines and spaces are proportional to them.</li>
<li>Most businesses use barcodes for inventory control. You scan X number items in when you receive a shipment, and deduct 1 from your inventory when ever you sell it. Barcodes are also used for shipping and recieving. You pack a box of goods to be sold at a retailer. You assign a Unique ID number, and relate it to the contents of the box. Electronically you notify the store that will sell your goods of all of the shipments you sent. When the store receives the box they scan the barcode with the UID and they will know what the content of the box is, how much it sells for, and who to send the check to.</li>

<p>i didn't like the line about barcodes being an "essential" part of modern civilization...... ___</p>
<p>Then you don't understand that every product you purchse from a major retailer requires barcodes to automate everything from shipping and recieving of the product to the inventory of and sale of each individual item. Having someone manually track and enter the information that is now encoded in barcodes would add significant labor thus increasing the price of the products we purchase.

<p>Apart from reliability, the current benefits section doesn't actually give benefits of using barcodes. The bullets all relate to the benefits of having point-of-sale management data. I think this should be changed to talk about things like the speed and reliability advantages of automatically inputting or outputting data using bar codes, versus manually processing it or using some other marking technology (RFID, magnetic strips, etc.) It could also give a cost comparison between the technologies. I've not changed anything, since I'm not personnally aware of a verifiable source of this kind of information. <a href="../../../j/r/i/User%7EJRI_2301.html" title="User:JRI">JRI</a> 12:13, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Barcodes work because a scanner bounces a light (usually a visible laser) off of it and the black lines (low reflectance) and the white lines (high reflectance) back to a photo detector that registers the highs and lows as 0's and 1's. The computer then displays the ascii equivalent on a screen for us to understand. While the transaction doesn't quite work at the speed of light, it is much faster than having someone read a product number and manually type that number in. Point of Sale benefits greatly from Barcodes, but inventory control is also a big factor in business barcoding. Not to mention that the shipping industry uses barcodes to help route your package to your door. If they didn't, they wouldn't be any faster than the post office.
