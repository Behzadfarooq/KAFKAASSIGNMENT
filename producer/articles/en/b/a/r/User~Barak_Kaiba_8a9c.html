<p>Barak Kaiba was born <i>Barak Zimri HaLevy</i> on <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_1.html" title="April 1">April 1</a><a href="../../../s/_/_/S.html" title="S">s</a><a href="../../../t/_/_/T.html" title="T">t</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1992.html" title="1992">1992</a> in <a href="../../../t/e/l/Tel_Aviv%2C_Israel_cb91.html" title="Tel Aviv, Israel">Tel Aviv, Israel</a> to two <a href="../../../o/r/t/Orthodox_Jewish_c066.html" title="Orthodox Jewish">Orthodox Jewish</a> parents named Avner and Elisheva HaLevy. Five days later, their home was destroyed in a bombing by an unknown terror group. The family moved to an underground boarding home in Tel Aviv, and Barak grew up there for about 8 years, until the boarding home was discovered by the same terror group that destroyed his home 8 years earlier, and they were forced to retreat to <a href="../../../e/g/y/Egypt.html" title="Egypt">Egypt</a>. He was forced to work for the next nine years of his life in a crop field.</p>
<p>In 2006, Barak was sent an invitation to duel in an upcoming Duel Monsters Tournament in Domino, Japan, called the "International Skill Tournament" hosted by <a href="../../../k/a/i/Kaiba_Corporation_4203.html" title="Kaiba Corporation">Kaiba Corporation</a>. He faced off against <a href="../../../s/e/t/Seto_Kaiba_0793.html" title="Seto Kaiba">Seto Kaiba</a> in the last round, and suprisingly won, sending Kaiba into a feeling of distrot that he'd never been in before.</p>
<p>Kaiba did some research, and discovered that his parents, whose names were originally Moshe and Eliora Keiva (pronounced KAY-vuh, they changed their name when they became Japanese citizens), and his father specifically (Moshe), was the brother of Elisheva (Barak's mother), which makes Barak his cousin.</p>
<p><a href="../../../j/o/e/Joey_Wheeler_0b27.html" title="Joey Wheeler">Joey Wheeler</a>, also suprised at the newcomer, does some research, and discovers that his parents, Mitchell and Lisa Wheeler, specifically his mother Lisa, was a sister of Elisheva (Barak's Mother), which makes Barak his cousin as well, which he enjoys for a while, until he realizes that this means that Seto Kaiba is his cousin, which he freaks out about.</p>
<p>Barak then finds himself living in the Kaiba Mansion after Seto comes ot his senses and sees the promise Barak has as not only a duelist, but as the <a href="../../../v/i/c/Vice_President_56ab.html" title="Vice President">Vice President</a> <a href="../../../o/f/_/Of.html" title="Of">of</a> <a href="../../../k/a/i/Kaiba_Corporation_4203.html" title="Kaiba Corporation">Kaiba Corporation</a>, as well as it's <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chairman.html" title="Chairman">Chairman</a> <a href="../../../o/f/_/Of.html" title="Of">of</a> <a href="../../../s/p/e/Special_Operations_a72e.html" title="Special Operations">Special Operations</a>.</p>
<p>After he turned 18, he returned to Cairo, to find his parents murdered by the same terror group that haunted him his whole life. He found them, and dealt with them all accordingly, by burning a house they were all in, and putting his parents to rest.</p>
<p>Terribly grief-stricken by this, Barak Zimri HaLevy instead began going by the name Barak Kaiba, in order to maybe forget about the past, and like Seto, move on to the future.</p>
<p>He returned to Domino destrot, but hopeful, for his future in Japan looked brighter now that he had friends and family he could trust around him.</p>

<div class="notice spoiler" id="spoiler"><b><a href="../../../s/p/o/Wikipedia%7ESpoiler_warning_6b56.html" title="Wikipedia:Spoiler warning">Spoiler warning</a>: <i>Plot and/or ending details follow.</i></b></div>
<p>In the <a href="../../../t/o/u/Tournament.html" title="Tournament">Tournament</a> <a href="../../../o/f/_/Of.html" title="Of">of</a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/The.html" title="The">the</a> <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kings.html" title="Kings">Kings</a>, Barak enters the first round as one of 500 duelists from around the world. He is considered a favorite by not only the fans, but by Duelist Champion, <a href="../../../y/u/g/Yugi_Mutou_7f99.html" title="Yugi Mutou">Yugi Mutou</a>. In the qualifying round, Barak duels a rookie duelist named Joturio Yuri, from the <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russian_Federation_4de3.html" title="Russian Federation">Russian Federation</a>. Barak easily defeats Joturio, after a combination of the Clay Dreidl Gadget and Blue Eyes of the Desert, a variant of <a href="../../../b/l/u/Blue_Eyes_White_Dragon_66f6.html" title="Blue Eyes White Dragon">Blue Eyes White Dragon</a>.</p>
<p>As Seto watches this, he is confused and at the same time, he is not suprised. After Seto himself defeats his qualifying round opponent, a weak duelist who's name is not even mentioned, Barak starts off the first round of the actual tournament by defeating a duelist named Rudolf Heston, from <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germany.html" title="Germany">Germany</a>. The duel was seen as somewhat controversial, as Heston was summoning a monster known as The Ultimate Reicher. In response, the creator made the duel only last two full chapters, with Barak won by attacking Heston directly with the Ultimate Desert Knight (Blue Eyes Desert Dragon x 3 with the Magic Card, Title of the True Hebrew).</p>
<p>After defeating Heston, Barak next, in the round in which only 62 remained (the tournament's organizer, Rashad Kotikiw had given himself a <a href="../../../b/y/e/Bye.html" title="Bye">bye</a> to the final round), faced his cousin, <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joey_Wheeler_0b27.html" title="Joey Wheeler">Joey Wheeler</a>. The duel was fierce and drawn out, with the victor being Barak.</p>
<p>The next round contained 31 duelists, in which the duelist who won the fastest would be given a bye through the next round. However, duel rules had changed back to the old Deck Master rules from the <a href="../../../n/o/a/Noah_Kaiba_426f.html" title="Noah Kaiba">Noah Kaiba</a> saga. In his first duel against <a href="../../../f/r/e/French.html" title="French">French</a> national, Pierre Jermaine, Barak chose Dreidl of Luck as his deck master. After being cornered by Pierre's deck master, Black and White King, Barak brought Dreidl of Luck onto the field and fused it together with Blue Eyes Desert Dragon, to create Desert Hope Dragon. However, before he could defeat Pierre, Rashad Kotikiw took control of Pierre's mind and dueled for him. The overall outcome was Barak's defeat, but Pierre was eventually disposed of (Kotikiw forced him to jump over the dueling bridge and into the river).</p>
<p>After seeing this, Yugi, Joey, Seto, and Barak were convinced that Kotikiw was aiming at something evil. Even more so in the next round, in which only 15 remained, where Rashad got rid of the tournament recognized duels and began to put duels together as he pleased. The first duel was Yugi Mutou vs. Kitzuko Mionwa, a <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japan.html" title="Japan">Japanese</a> national, in which Yugi was the obvious victor, and then Barak Kaiba vs. John Jones, an <a href="../../../a/m/e/American.html" title="American">American</a> national, in which Barak was the winner, and finally Seto Kaiba vs. Oliver Jenkins a <a href="../../../b/r/i/British.html" title="British">British</a> national, in which Kaiba won.</p>
<p>Rashad decreed that since seven was an odd number and there could not be an equal distribution of fair duels between the remaining contestants, there would be a duel lottery, in which the winner would be given a bye to the semifinals. The winner, Yugi Mutou (<a href="../../../j/a/p/Japan.html" title="Japan">Japan</a>), was given the bye, as the final six: Barak Kaiba (<a href="../../../j/a/p/Japan.html" title="Japan">Japan</a>), <a href="../../../s/e/t/Seto_Kaiba_0793.html" title="Seto Kaiba">Seto Kaiba</a> (Japan), <a href="../../../m/a/i/Mai_Valentine_d7f1.html" title="Mai Valentine">Mai Valentine</a> (Japan), Vernon Paulstin (<a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australia</a>), Brien O'Hallrin (<a href="../../../n/o/r/Northern_Ireland_a52b.html" title="Northern Ireland">Northern Ireland</a>), and David Carter (<a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>), would all stake it out in two three-on-three duels.</p>
<p>The first (Kaiba vs. Vernon vs. Brien) was quick and absolute, with Kaiba destroying the two competetors easily. The second (Barak vs. Mai vs. David) was a long battle due to the fact that Rashad's attempts to take over Mai's mind were thwarted by Yugi and Joey. Barak eventually was the winner, and went on to face Kaiba in the semi-finals.</p>
<p>The battle was the main duel of the series, with most of Barak's past being revealed in the duel, including his life working in different places for money to help his family stay alive. Kaiba, however, held nothing back, and got Barak down to 500 life points on the first turn. Barak, though, fought back against the force of Kaiba's <a href="../../../b/l/u/Blue_Eyes_Ultimate_Dragon_01bf.html" title="Blue Eyes Ultimate Dragon">Blue Eyes Ultimate Dragon</a> and was able to summon his ultimate monster, Maccabee Judah (3700 ATK), and with that and the combination of his Hammer of the Maccabee Magic Card, he was able to bring Kaiba from 7000 life points down to 0 in just one move. Kaiba finally admitted his defeat after the long fought duel had ended, and wished Barak luck in the finals.</p>
<p>However, as Barak's duel with <a href="../../../y/u/g/Yugi_Mutou_7f99.html" title="Yugi Mutou">Yugi Mutou</a> was to begin, Rashad yet again changed the rules. He made the duel Yugi and Barak vs. Himself, and raised the steaks. Rashad declared that if he was the winner, he would lead his army to enslave the world and become Pharaoh. During the duel, three cards, each respective card holding it's own individual significance, appear in the decks of Yugi and Barak. The first card, Almighty Armor, appears in Yugi's deck, and allows him to stop all opponent attacks on his monsters or life points, or that of Barak, for ten whole turns. The second card, Almighty Opportunity, appears in Barak's deck, and allows him to discard how ever many cards he wishes each turn, and then search his deck for as many cards as he discarded, and the cards can be anything. However, before the final card can appear, Rashad is able to defeat Yugi with the God of the Nile (10,000 ATK), which is a combination of <a href="../../../o/b/e/Obelisk_the_Tormentor_774c.html" title="Obelisk the Tormentor">Obelisk the Tormentor</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Winged_Dragon_of_Ra_7259.html" title="The Winged Dragon of Ra">The Winged Dragon of Ra</a>, and <a href="../../../s/l/i/Slifer_the_Sky_Dragon_3f73.html" title="Slifer the Sky Dragon">Slifer the Sky Dragon</a>. And Barak's Almighty Card, Almighty Opportunity, is destroyed as a result of Yugi's loss, due to it's effect that states your partner must have at least 50 life points for it to stay in play. However, Barak is able to draw the final Almighty card, Almighty Wrath, which allows him to summon his ultimate monster, The Almighty (∞ ATK), and destroy the God of the Nile, and defeat Rashad.</p>
