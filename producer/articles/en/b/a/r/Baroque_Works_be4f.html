<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/r/Baroque_Works_be4f.html" title="Edit section: About">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">About</span></h2>
<p>There are initially thirteen main agents in the organization, each male agent has a number codename and paired with a female agent that has a holiday name (most of which are based on Japanese holidays) with the exception of Mr. 2 (since he is a transvestite, thus serving as his own female agent, in a sense. In his case, he is referred to by both his number, and name; Mr. 2 Bon Clay).</p>
<p>Numbers 12 through 6 are known as Frontier Agents and are generally somewhat skillful, although not unusually powerful. Numbers 5 through 0 however are the Officer Agents and all but Mr.4 and Miss Golden Week (who was later confirmed by Oda in one SBS not to be a Devil Fruit user) have the power of the <a href="../../../d/e/v/Devil_Fruit_394e.html" title="Devil Fruit">Devil Fruit</a> behind them, making them the most powerful. Lastly, there are the Unluckies, two animal agents that act as messengers and punishers to the others.</p>
<p>Strength seems to be proportional to rank, with the higher ranked officers much more powerful than the lower ranked agents. They in turn are more capable and stronger (albeit not much) than the masses of common henchmen in the organization.</p>

Mr. 1</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Mr. 1's real name is Das Bones. He is not seen for much of the Baroque Works saga, though he is the most powerful member in the organization next to Crocodile and once was an infamous assassin in West Blue. He works with Miss Doublefinger.</p>
<p>Mr. 1 was thought to have been dead from the bloody wound Zoro inflicted on him but in a title page mini-arc featuring the Baroque Works, he is seen alive and well in the same cell as Mr. 4 and Crocodile. He refused to escape, choosing to stay behind with Crocodile, and the two of them (as well as the recently-imprisoned Mr. 2 Bon Clay/Kurei and Mr. 3) are heading for the Marine prison Impel Down.</p>
<p><br />
Mr. 1 ate the Supa Supa no Mi(Dice Dice fruit in dub) that can make any part of his body into powerful steel blades capable of doing large-scale damage, as well as giving his entire body the same composition as steel. It can be assumed this is from honing his Devil Fruit powers, since most other people who have metamorphing Devil Fruit powers are not always in their morphed state like this. His bare fighting skill is also very refined and shows signs of great skill and training; he's very powerful and quick.</p>

Miss Doublefinger</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Miss Doublefinger (Miss New Year's Day in english), first appears as the owner of the Spiders Cafe, Paula, which may or may not be her real identity. Named after a Japanese holiday that occurs January 1st, she is paired with the blademan assassin, Mr. 1, giving the top Officer Agents team a "sharpness" theme. She ate the Toge Toge no Mi (Spike Spike Fruit in the English) to create stretchable thorns that grow from anywhere on her body in battle, coupled with her own agility and skill. Her attacks mainly consist of physical attacks with her spiked body. She also seems to be one of the few agents of Baroque works capable of any sympathy. She is, however, a professional, and will forsake said sympathy for the sake of the job. Miss Doublefinger is defeated by Nami when she is blasted into a wall by Nami's Tornado Tempo attack. She is later broken out of jail and starts a new Spider's Cafe with the others.</p>

Mr. 3</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>A self proclaimed brilliant strategist, Mr. 3 prides himself that his plans are supposedly flawless, and was ordered to kill the <a href="../../../s/t/r/Straw_Hat_Pirates_ff71.html" title="Straw Hat Pirates">Straw Hat Pirates</a> and decided to claim the bounty on One Piece minor characters Dorry and Broggy as well on Little Garden. Mr. 3 ate the Doru Doru no Mi (Wax Wax Fruit in the English), giving him the power to produce molten wax from any part of his body. However, he can't himself turn into wax. He sabotages a sacred battle between the two giants and then captures Vivi, Nami, and Zoro creating a huge, spinning wax cake he made with his devil fruit abilities to rain wax down upon them, the desired effect being that the three will slowly be encased in wax, and suffocate to death. This would also give Mr. 3 human wax statues, as he admits he has trouble making human wax figures himself. Mr. 3 was defeated at the end along with three other Baroque Works Officer Agents, Miss Goldenweek, Mr. 5, and Miss Valentines Day.</p>
<p>However, he does make another appearance in the Alabasta arc trying to report to Crocodile that the Straw Hats are alive. But Crocodile, infuriated with Mr. 3’s uselessness (Due to the fact the Mr. 3 was unable to kill them), absorbs most of the water in his body, and tosses him to the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_One_Piece_animals_626a.html#Bananawani" title="List of One Piece animals">Bananawani</a>, where he is supposedly eaten.</p>
<p>By creating a wax shield around himself, called the Doru Doru Ball, he survives. Happening upon a crisis the heroes are in with a locked cage, a room filling with water, and hungry Bananawani. He finds the keys the straw hats need, but as revenge, he disposes of the key. However, Sanji comes up with the idea of forcing him to use his Wax Wax power and make a duplicate of the cage’s key. Sanji 'convinced him' to do it...with his feet. Mr. 3 makes another appearance in a Mini Arc Operation: Meet Baroque. His Doru Doru Ship is seen, and although unshaven, he still sports his trademark hair. Mr. 2 Bon Clay poses as him to save Miss Valentines Day and succeeds, but later Mr. 3 is somehow caught and is sent to jail with Mr.'s 0, 1, and 2. In his jail picture, he is seen crying.</p>
<p>In the English dub, the entire Little Garden arc is cut out and all references to it are removed, so Mr. 3's part is greatly downplayed, making his first major appearance when he confronts Crocodile at Rain Dinners. In this version, he has been following the Straw Hats since Roguetown and is punished by Crocodile because he didn't attack them. This creates a plot hole as Baroque Works did not learn about the Straw Hats until after the crew entered the Grand Line, at the time Vivi had not joined then which creates another plot hole as Crocodile says that Vivi was with them at the time. He is also given a comedic side in the English dub, where he is almost constantly cracking bad jokes, such as "I just flew in, and boy are my arms tired"(they are so bad that Luffy will not even laugh at them). This is probably because his partner's is Miss April Fool's Day in the dub.</p>
<p>Mr. 3 is partnered with Miss Goldenweek, who paints, giving the "3" team the artistic idea.</p>

Miss Goldenweek</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Miss Goldenweek is partnered with Mr. 3, a wax sculptor. Not much is known about Miss Goldenweek's personality other than that it seems that she hates work, is a talented painter, and can be seen constantly eating her favourite snack: rice crackers. She wields Colour Traps, which control a person's emotions by painting colours upon their body (or elsewhere, in the red bull's eye trap).</p>
<p>Miss Goldenweek's only major appearance in the manga and anime thus far was during the Alabasta saga on the island of Little Garden. During Luffy's attempt to save his friends from becoming wax statues in Little Garden, she interrupts his attacks by painting Colour Traps on his vest that make Luffy do whatever emotion that a particular color is associated with. If anything, she comes the closest to defeating Luffy out of the four agents who attack in Little Garden, at least until Usopp fires an explosive shot that burns his vest and snaps him out of Miss Goldenweek's spell. After Mr. 3 is defeated, she tries to hide from the heroes but is found by Karoo, Princess Vivi's pet duck. It is unknown what Karoo did to her as it happens offscreen, with only her terrified screams being heard, though it is shown that Luffy, Karoo, and Usopp are eating her rice crackers later on.</p>
<p>Recently in the series, Miss Goldenweek has gotten her own mini-arc on the chapter covers of the manga during the Water 7 arc. Where upon finding out that Baroque Works has been exposed; she, along with Mr. 5 and Miss Valentines Day, fly from Little Garden on top of a pterodactyl with the help of a Colour Trap to go visit them in jail. However, the symbol is washed away in a storm and the three are dropped onto a resort island where Hina, former Black Cat pirate Jango (who is now a marine and Fullbody's partner), Ironfist Fullbody and their Marine unit happen to be vacationing. Miss Goldenweek manages to break out the other agents except for Crocodile and Mr. 1 and starts a new Spider's Cafe with the ones that escaped.</p>
<p>In the English dub, the entire Little Garden Arc is cut out, so she does not appear other than in an explanation by Vivi of Baroque Works Which makes the characters intact reactions to Mr. 3. and herself remarkably odd. Her appearance in One Piece Grand Battle! as a side character, as well as Vivi's explanation of the agents during the English dub is maintained however, and her name is changed to Miss April Fools Day, most likely due to Goldenweek being a reference to a Japanese vacation and American audiences not understanding the original name.</p>

<p>Mr. 4 is the partner of Miss Merry Christmas. He and his partner are actually, in terms of physical power, stronger than the Mr. 3 Team, but are a lower rank because Mr. 3 is much smarter.</p>
<p>He has a dog called Lassoo, which was originally a gun, but ate or rather, merged with the Inu Inu no Mi, Model Dachsund (Mutt Mutt Fruit in the English) and became a gun-dog, who shoots exploding baseballs whenever he sneezes. Mr. 4 then takes out his 4-ton baseball bat and hits the balls at his enemies.</p>
<p>Mr. 4 is rather tall, fat and very strong, but extremely slow in nature, so without Miss Merry Christmas handling the intelligence and forcing him along, he would not succeed. He has extreme upper arm strength, as seen when he holds the 4-ton bat.</p>
<p>He, Lassoo, and Miss Merry Christmas take on Usopp and Chopper during the Straw Hats' final fights with Baroque Works during the Alabasta rebellion, and he manages to severely injure Usopp using a combined attack with Miss Merry Christmas. However, Usopp and Chopper trick him into knocking out his partner, and then, using Chopper's horns as a slingshot, defeats Mr. 4 by shooting an extremely fast hammer at him the move called UsoCho Hammer Comet (Usopp Hammer Shooting Star in the dub) and knocking him and Lassoo into a stone structure. Afterward both Mr. 4 and Miss Merry Christmas appear to be finished off by one of Lassoo's exploding baseballs. However, all three later seen alive, but in prison, in the Baroque Works chapter title page story. They manage to escape and are now working in the new Spider's Cafe.</p>

Miss Merry Christmas</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Miss Merry Christmas (Miss Groundhog's Day in english), is partnered with Mr. 4. Unlike her partner, who is very slow, she talks very fast, often only pronouncing the first syllable of the word. In the English anime, she talks like an army drill sergeant.</p>
<p>She has the power of the Mogu Mogu no Mi (Diggy Diggy Fruit in the English), a Zoan type fruit that gives her the ability to transform into a giant mole or a mole-human hybrid that Usopp thinks is a penguin. Because of this transformation, she can easily dig underground in the sands of Alabasta and sneak up on opponents.</p>
<p>In the final fight between the Baroque Works and the Straw-Hat Crew, she and Mr. 4 fight against Usopp and Chopper. This battle is a bit ironic for Usopp, because during the time they face Captain Kuro Arc, Usopp tried to sneak onto Kaya's estate by claiming he was searching for a giant mole, which she can transform into.</p>
<p>She was defeated by Chopper's Horn Point transformation. After blinding Mr. 4 with his Smoke Star, Usopp was able to escape from Miss Merry Christmas and her partner's combined attack Molehill Intersection Number 4, leaving Chopper to scoop her into his antlers. Falling for Usopp's impression of her calling out the attack's name, Mr. 4 immediately slugged her in the face with his bat and sent her flying into a stone arch. In the American dub, she is called Miss Groundhog Day inreference to her abilities.</p>
<p>Shortly after the trio were defeated, Lassoo coughed up one last explosive baseball. Mr. 4 and Miss Merry Christmas were later taken to prison, where Miss Goldenweek visited them. They managed to escape and are now working in the new Spider's Cafe.</p>

Lassoo</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Lassoo used to be Mr. 4's gun before it consumed the Inu Inu no Mi, Model Dachsund (Mutt Mutt Fruit in the English). The fruit gave the gun the ability to turn into a dachshund, becoming a dog-gun. Lassoo teams up with the Mr. 4 and Miss Merry Christmas team to fight Usopp and Chopper. On Mr. 4's call, Lassoo would bark out an infinite amount of exploding baseballs. But, Lassoo had a cold during the fight and sneezed them out. They are -to Usopp's surprise- not balls that explode on impact, but are, instead, time bombs. According to Chopper, Lassoo's baseballs are as heavy as cannon balls, thus ruining Chopper's plan to throw the ball back towards the agents before the baseball explodes. Lassoo is ultimately defeated when Usopp and Chopper trick Mr. 4 into slugging Miss Merry Christmas with his 4-ton bat. While Mr. 4 was shocked at what had just happened, Usopp took advantage of this time to fire a hammer at his gut using Chopper's horns and a giant rubber band as a slingshot. Mr. 4 then flies into Lassoo and crashes into a stone structure, thus knocking them both out, however, not before Lassoo could cough up one last exploding baseball that supposedly finished off the Mr. 4 team. However, the only thing it does is add more injury to the trio. Lassoo is then arrested by the Marines along with the rest of Baroque Works when Crocodile is defeated. After all the members of Baroque Works have been exposed, Miss Goldenweek, Miss Valentines Day, and Mr. 5 fly to the Marine base and try to break out all of the captured members of Baroque Works. They succeed in rescuing Mr. 4, Miss Doublefinger, Miss Merry Christmas, and Lassoo. Sir Crocodile and Mr. 1 decide to stay behind. Lassoo then helps out around the new Spider's Cafe.</p>

</ul>
<p>Mr. 5 is the lowest-ranked Officer Agent in the Baroque Works along with his partner, Miss Valentines Day. Like most of the Baroque Works agents, he is extremely confident and believes that friendship is a sign of weakness.</p>
<p>Mr. 5 and Miss Valentines Day first meet the Straw Hat Pirates at Whiskey Peak during the Whiskey Peak Arc, then later fight them at Little Garden with Mr. 3 and Ms Goldenweek during the Little Garden Arc where he is knocked out by Zoro.</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Note: In the English dub, because the Little Garden arc was cut out, he appears only at Whiskey Peak and is defeated there and then.</i></li>
</ul>
<p>He, along with Miss Valentines Day and Miss Goldenweek, has reappeared in the series in a chapter cover mini story where the three fly away from Little Garden to rescue their captured Baroque Agents only to end up on an island resort swarming with Marines. They manage to release most of the agents and he helps out at the new Spider's Cafe.</p>
<p><b>Abilities</b></p>
<p>Mr. 5 has the power of the Bomu Bomu No Mi (Bomb Bomb Fruit in the English and Boom Boom Fruit in the English Manga) which allows him to turn any part of his body into a bomb without harming himself and it renders all explosive based attacks useless against him. He can make any part of his body, even his entire body, explode, but he mainly uses snot from his nose, and on Little Garden likes using a revolver full of his breath, which is surprisingly also explosive.</p>

Miss Valentines Day</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Miss Valentinea Day is partnered with Mr. 5, and she has the power of the Kilo Kilo no Mi (Same name in the English), which allows her change her weight to anything between 1 and 10,000 kilograms. She uses this power to crush her opponents, or to make her light enough to glide through the air using her umbrella. Being a top Baroque Works agent, she is quite confident in her abilities.</p>
<p>She, along with Mr. 5, find out about the Straw Hat Pirates during the Whiskey Peak Arc and fights them alongside Mr. 3 and Miss Goldenweek during the Little Garden Arc where she is swiftly defeated by both Nami and Nefertari Vivi.</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Note: In the English dub, because the Little Garden Arc was cut out, she appears only at "Misty Peak" and is defeated there and then.</i></li>
</ul>
<p>She, along with Mr. 5 and Miss Goldenweek, have appeared in a chapter cover mini-story where the three fly from Little Garden to rescue their fellow Baroque Works agents in prison but wind up on an island resort swarming with Marines. The three later try to disguise themselves but are unsuccessful and are spotted by Hina. While Mr. 5 and Miss Goldenweek escape, Miss Valentines Day is captured and is about to be executed by the Marines. Luckily, Mr. 2 shows up disguised as Mr. 3 and pretends to have surrendered before challenging Hina to a rematch, allowing Mr. 5 and Miss Goldenweek time to rescue Miss Valentines Day and escape. They manage to break many agents out of prison and start a new Spider's Cafe.</p>

<li><b>Mr. 7</b> is a Baroque Works agent and part of a sniper pair along with Miss Father's Day. His body is covered with sevens, including his eyebrows, shoes, nose, mouth, and gun. In the English dub of the anime, he also uses phrases and terms common during the 1970s. His Yellow Gun named the <i>Kiiroi Juu</i> shoots dice-shaped bullets, which he fires so they line up with Miss Father's Day's bullets, thus creating an explosion. Sir Crocodile gave them the job to guard the cannon at the top of the clock tower until it went off and destroyed the people fighting in the middle of the capital city of Alabasta, Alubarna, though they are both unaware of the fact that they'll be caught in the blast as well. He always seems to yawn or whisper to Miss Father's Day. Both he and Miss Father's Day were defeated by Princess Vivi as the Straw Hat Pirates help her climb the clock tower.</li>

<li>Along with Mr. 7, <b>Miss Fathers Day</b> is part of the "Sniping" pair who apparently are deployed for jobs where sniping is necessary. Miss Fathers Day has a strange sense of fashion involving frogs, and her Gero Gun is shaped like a one. Gero is the Japanese word for the sound a frog makes. Miss Father's Day shows up in the main story briefly during the climax of the Alabasta Kingdom storyline manning the giant cannon that Baroque Works has placed in the Alabasta capitol of Alubarna. Princess Vivi figures out the location of this cannon and, during the final moments of the battle of Alubarna, she with the Strawhat Crew's help attacks it. Miss Fathers day and Mr. 7 attempt to stop her, but Vivi skilfully evades their gunfire and defeats them using her peacock slashers. Miss Fathers Day has a french accent in the dub.</li>

While Miss Monday manages to get some hits in, she is soon defeated by Zolo during his rampage.

Mr. 11</div>
</div>

<ul>
<li>Mr. 11 is a Frontier Agent for Baroque Works in the and manga. His partner, <b>Miss Thursday</b>, is not shown. He makes a very short appearance in two episodes during the Alabasta Arc. In the first, he is captured by Captain Smoker and tied to a flag post. On Smoker's ship, he unwittingly reveals some information about Baroque Works after Smoker's men intercepted the call (from Little Garden) where Sanji and Mr. 0 were talking. In the second, the ship is in Alabasta. When an unforseen event happens that causes the crew, including Smoker, to leave their ship, Mr. 11 tries to free himself. Surprisingly, "billions" henchmen for Officer Agents board the ship. Mr. 11 mistakes them for "millions" henchmen for Frontier Agents and yells at them to untie him. The billions then reveal their rank and are hence the same level as him. Then Mr. 11 apologizes, but too little too late for they have no intention of freeing him. Then Mr. Mellow comes toward Mr. 11 and says "It's about time a post got opened." and shoots Mr. 11. Though his death isn't shown, Mr. Mellow's comment makes it a likely possibility,especially as Tashigi tells Smoker he got murdered in the same chapter/episode.</li>
</ul>
<p>Mr. 11 also resembles the character Robert Edward (or Speedwagon) from the first Jojo's Bizarre Adventure.</p>

The Unluckies</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The <b>Unluckies</b> are two agents of Baroque Works. They consist of an otter named <b>Mr. 13</b> and a vulture named <b>Miss Friday</b>. The Unluckies serve as messengers for Mr. 0 and are also in charge of executing any Baroque Works agents that fail their missions. Also, Mr. 13 is a skilled artist &amp; was able to draw up posters of Nami, Zoro, &amp; Luffy to report to Mr. 0 that they'd learned of his secret identity.</p>
<p>The name the Unluckies comes from the superstition of Friday the 13th being an unlucky day for people, as well as the unfortunate fate of those they come to visit.</p>
<p>The Unluckies appear during the Whiskey Peak and are later seen in the Little Garden when they are sent to check up on Mr. 3 and Miss Goldenweek. Instead they encounter Sanji who is answering a phone call from Mr. 0.</p>
<p>They attempt to assassinate Sanji but fail miserably. Though the two were thought to be dead due to the fact that Sanji twisted Miss Friday's neck until it snapped and Mr. 13 was kicked into the side of Mr. 3's wax house so hard it left an imprint, though it has recently been revealed in the Meet Baroque Works mini-arc that the Unluckies survived their encounter with Sanji and were used by the Marines to make drawings of the Baroque Works agents that were not captured in Alabasta (using a hot bowl of Donburi as encouragement). However, it is unknown what was done with them afterwards.</p>
<p>When the two tried to assassinate Sanji, it was revealed that that in combat, Miss Friday has a pair of machine guns strapped on her back, and Mr. 13 has a pair of shell gloves with short but very sharp claws on the fingers.</p>

<ul>
<li>The names of all the female officer agents (And the second part of Mr. 2's name) were named after happy days of the year. The higher-ranking agents being more specific (holidays), while lower-ranked members are more general (the English names for the days of the week). The holidays are chosen by how special they are. Nico Robin's codename, Miss All-Sunday, appears to encompass both (a day of the week, and the fact that Sunday is also a holiday, werein most work is closed, and "all the Sundays" are the "best holiday.").</li>
<li>The word "baroque" is defined as "extravagant, complex, or bizarre...", which aptly describes Baroque Works' megastructure, plans, and members.</li>
<li>In the English anime, Miss Valentine is the only Female Officer Agent not to have her name changed, due to it being a non-religion holiday that is celebrated all over the world.</li>
