	    <p>The <b>Barcelona International Football League</b> is an amateur <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football_%28soccer%29.html" title="Football (soccer)">football (soccer)</a> league in <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barcelona.html" title="Barcelona">Barcelona</a>, <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spain.html" title="Spain">Spain</a>.</p>
<p>Founded in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1992.html" title="1992">1992</a>, it now consists of a league of 23 teams made up from a mix of native <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catalan_people.html" title="Catalan people">Catalan</a> and Spanish players, as well as representatives from many other nations who live in this multi-cultural city.</p>
<p>Of the foreigners, the majority are English speakers from the <a href="../../../u/k/_/UK_7642.html" title="UK">UK</a>, but there are also <a href="../../../s/c/a/Scandinavia.html" title="Scandinavia">Scandinavians</a>, <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">French</a>, <a href="../../../i/t/a/Italy.html" title="Italy">Italians</a>, <a href="../../../n/e/t/Netherlands.html" title="Netherlands">Dutch</a>, <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germany.html" title="Germany">Germans</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_America_e7c4.html" title="North America">North</a> and <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_America_9663.html" title="South America">South Americans</a>, and many others. One team, Mu Gung Hwa is entirely <a href="../../../k/o/r/Korea.html" title="Korea">Korean</a>, while Dragon United are all <a href="../../../c/h/i/China.html" title="China">Chinese</a>, and one of the new additions for this season is Saint George, who are almost all from <a href="../../../g/e/o/Georgia_%28country%29.html" title="Georgia (country)">Georgia</a>, plus a few players from other former <a href="../../../s/o/v/Soviet_Union_ad1f.html" title="Soviet Union">Soviet nations</a>.</p>
<p>All the matches are played on pitches in Barcelona itself, with the exceptions of <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terrassa.html" title="Terrassa">Terrassa</a> and <a href="../../../s/i/t/Sitges.html" title="Sitges">Sitges</a>, who are based outside.</p>
<p>The teams playing in the 2006-07 edition are Anglo American, Catalan Knights, Celtic Cross, Dragon United, Dynamo, Fastnet, FCUK, Flaherty, Independent, Mallorca 204, Manchester La Fianna, Metropolitan, Mu Gung Hwa, Pechekali 43 AD, Real Sitges, Red Star, Saint George, Storesnay, Strollers, Terrassa St Patricks, Torpedo Raval, Vueling FC and West Ham</p>
<p>The format of the league has changed several times over the years. The 2006-07 edition is being played with the teams divided into two groups, one of 12 and the other of 11. Teams play all the other sides in their group once, and then the top six from each group progress to the first division and the remainder play in the second division. Half the points from the first stage carry over to the second phase.</p>
<p>As well as the league competition there is a separate cup competition played as a straight knock-out.</p>

<ul>
<li>Anglo American: A founding member, they have probably been around longer than any other team. They are now mainly Catalan and no longer have any connection to the language school from which they took their name. For years one of the weakest teams in the league, they have improved enormously in recent seasons, but have yet to win any major trophies.</li>
<li>Catalan Knights: Joined the league in 2000, and as their name suggests, are mainly Catalan. Despite a tradition of prolific goalscorers, have never been much more than a mid-table outfit.</li>
<li>Celtic Cross: A founding member, originally called the British Institute, they were then sponsored by the Black Horse and Michael Collins before becoming the Celtic Cross in 2006. At the heart of the social core of the league, they have yet to win any major trophies, but made the 2005 cup final after losing in all eight of their previous league or cup semi final appearances.</li>
<li>Dragon United: Joined the league in 2005 as an entirely Chinese team setting new standards of ineptness, including the league's biggest ever defeat, 21-1 against Dynamo. Consistently concede over ten goals a game, and have yet to even come close to registering their first BIFL win. 2006 saw foreigners join the team but as yet there hasn't been any improvement in the team's fortunes.</li>
<li>Dynamo: Formed by Welshman Gary Moore, originally as Wellington Arms in 2001, then Temporary Bar, and have continued to change names on an annual basis, but now keep the Dynamo prefix and have picked up quite a following. After a slow start, they pushed Metropolitan all the way for the 2004 title, and finally won the league the season after. Developed a friendly rivalry with the Metropolitan, and were unlucky to miss out on the 2006 title when they went through the league season unbeaten and lost the Cup Final to FCUK in extra time.</li>
<li>Fastnet: Joined the league in its second season in 1993 as Miro Park Rangers, then became George and Dragon before finally becoming the [Fastnet]. Apart from a few mid-table performances, they have generally finished near the bottom of the league table. Usually has a wide range of different nationalities in the squad.</li>
<li>FCUK: Joined the league in its second season in 1993, and apparently came up with the name long before the <a href="../../../f/c/u/FCUK_13e1.html" title="FCUK">FCUK</a> clothing company. Were always a strong contender without winning major trophies, and were felt unfortunate to lose the controversial 1999 League final against the Michael Collins. After some poor seasons have come back strong of late and in 2006 won their first major honour, the BIFL Cup, beating Dynamo in extra time in the final</li>
<li>Flaherty: This Irish pub team joined the league in 2002 and after a poor start, flew up the table to claim the third division title. However, in the few years they have been with us, this very international team has never managed to escape from the lower echelons.</li>
<li>Independent: Futbol Club Independent de [Catalunya], Independent or FCIC for short. A mainly Catalan side with more and more international players getting involved, they joined the league in 2004-05 and finished second bottom. They have not done much better in subsequent seasons.</li>
<li>Mallorca 204: Their name is the address of the Philharmonic pub and they joined the league in 2001-02, although many of the squad had already played in the BIFL for the defunct Inter Paradis and Stella City teams. They won the league at the second time of asking in 2003, some would say surprisingly, but have failed to build on that with the dynasty we had been promised.</li>
<li>Manchester La Fianna: The brainchild of <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manchester_United_0c9f.html" title="Manchester United">Manchester United</a> supporter Andy Mitten, these are new for the 2006-07 season, although some of the players previously appeared for other teams. They wear United kit and from early evidence look like they could be one of the stronger teams in the tournament.</li>
<li>Metropolitan: Joined the league in 1997-98 as the Clansman, originally as a failed attempt to form an all-Scottish team. Started slow but came from nowhere to become the first team to win the league in its debut season. Have gone on to become the strongest side in the tournament for the last few years, winning back-to-back league titles in 2001 and 2002, winning the title again in 2004 (having become Metropolitan) and making it a record five league titles in 2006. In 2005 they won the Cup for the first time, beating the Collins in extra time in the final, and have won a major trophy every year but one for the last six years.</li>
<li>Mu Gung Hwa: A <a href="../../../k/o/r/Korea.html" title="Korea">Korean</a> team that joined the BIFL in 2000-01, and lost every game. They have gone to finish bottom every season since, except in 2005-06, when the even weaker Dragon United joined the league. Their famous first point was from a draw with Vueling (then called Flanns) and their first win was against Red Stars (then Shamrock).</li>
<li>Pechekali 43 AD: Joined the league in 2005-06, as an all-Catalan team that picked up more yellow and red cards than wins in its first season. They are loosely based on the now defunct Cranks side, and in their second season they look to have improved considerably both in terms of discipline and results.</li>
<li>Real Sitges: Originally joined the league in 1998-99, having guested in the cup the year before. They have traditionally played all their games in their home city. Struggled to adapt and resigned in 2002, but returned for the 2005-06 season, and with the Aiguadolç pitch now artificial. The annual trip to the seaside town is a great away day for the BIFL teams.</li>
<li>Red Star: Founder members of the league as Dynamo [Smirnoff], they won the first ever edition in 1993 and came second the year after. Were the first BIFL team to be sponsored when they became Flann O'Brien in 1995, and won the cup under their new name. In 1998 they became the Shamrock and are now called Red Stars, but have never quite managed to return to the glory days of the first few seasons.</li>
<li>Saint George: A new side for 2006-05, this team is made up entirely of players from <a href="../../../g/e/o/Georgia_%28country%29.html" title="Georgia (country)">Georgia</a>, plus a few players from other former <a href="../../../s/o/v/Soviet.html" title="Soviet">Soviet</a> nations. They bring more fans to games than any team in the BIFL before them, which has led to a few early problems. Many of the players have experience of playing at a very high level, and they are proving to be one of the strongest teams ever to appear in the league.</li>
<li>Storesnay: Originally a breakaway team formed by the Catalan contingent of the British Institute, they joined the league in 1996-97 and nobody has ever managed to produce a satifying explanation for what their name means. Their first few seasons were dreadful, but things have gradually improved since and they are now firmly established in the mid-table positions of the BIFL.</li>
<li>Strollers: Joined the league in 2004, led by a group of BIFL stalwarts seeking to form a new and mainly veteran side. They won the second disvion in their first season and finished fourth in their second year.</li>
<li>Terrassa St Patricks: A founder member of the league and the team with the best overall record in BIFL history, although their finest years were before rather than after the turn of the century. Surprisingly, they only have one league title, from 1994. In the days of the play off system they were consistently the best team over the season, but developed a habit of messing it up in the finals. However, they have won more BIFL Cups than anybody else, four, winning in 1995, 1998, 1999 and 2002. Play most of their matches in <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terrassa.html" title="Terrassa">Terrassa</a>.</li>
<li>Torpedo Raval: New Catalan team that joined the league in 2006. They were originally a seven-a-side club and this season are enjoying their first taste of the full-size game in the BIFL. Seem about the right level for this league.</li>
<li>Vueling FC: Joined the league as Real Balmes in 1998, but became <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flann_O%27Brien_1f6a.html" title="Flann O'Brien">Flann O'Brien</a> shortly after (taking over the sponsor another team that went on to become Red Stars). They won the 1999 BIFL Plate in their first year, and have gone to become one of the better sides in the league, but have rarely come close to challenging for major honours. Now sponsored by the airline <a href="../../../v/u/e/Vueling.html" title="Vueling">Vueling</a>.</li>
<li>West Ham: Formed by league president and Hammers fan Nick 'Paquete' Simons for the 2000-01 season, they wear the same kit as the real <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Ham_United_F.C._c452.html" title="West Ham United F.C.">West Ham</a>. They beat the Michael Collins to win the Cup in their first ever season, but have not won any titles since, although they are one of the stronger teams in the league. Their striker Enric Sales is the most prolific goalscorer the league has ever known, finishing top scorer on five occasions.</li>

<ul>
<li>Black Sheep: A founding member and one of the main teams in ever getting the league off the ground. They won back to back leagues in 1995 and 1996, and the cup in 1997. Results gradually worsened after that, but despite a revival in 2000 and another cup victory, things were falling apart and they sadly pulled out of the league at the end of the following season.</li>
<li>Celtic Blades: Only played in the first ever season.</li>
<li>University: Wore <a href="../../../s/h/e/Sheffield_United_f380.html" title="Sheffield United">Sheffield United</a> kit and only played in the first two editions.</li>
<li>Dublin: A founding member of the league, they won the first ever Cup in 1994. Were involved in several brawls and were eventually kicked out of the league, only to return the next season. Eventually resigned midway through the 1999-00 season.</li>
<li>Barcelona Wednesday: Only appeared in the 1994-95 season and lost every match.</li>
<li>Stella City: Played seven seasons from 1994-95 to 1999-00, later becoming the Dow Jones, and reaching two cup finals and establishing themselves as one of the strongest teams in the league. Then shockingly resigned from the league, with many players going on to join the Clansman and help form a super-team.</li>
<li>Ateneu: Catalan team that joined in 1994 and played for three seasons without ever doing much of note.</li>
<li>Teknon: Team of doctors from the hospital next door to the old Bonanova pitch that played for two seasons.</li>
<li>Ka Goone Low: Catalan team that joined in 1995 but only lasted for two fairly respectable seasons.</li>
<li>International Paradis: Formerly International Gothics, the <a href="../../../r/e/g/Reggae.html" title="Reggae">reggae</a>-clad Catalans joined in 1994 and played for four seasons. They were involved in too many violent encounters and were kicked out of the league, although many of the players went on to play for Mallorca 204.</li>
<li>Michael Collins: The Irish Pub named after the famous Irish rebel <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Collins_%28Irish_leader%29_b503.html" title="Michael Collins (Irish leader)">Michael Collins</a> won the league in its debut season, 1999-00, and also reached three cup finals, and lost them all. They surprisingly pulled out of the league in 2003-04, and the pub instead started sponsoring the former British Institute, with several of the players switching to the new team.</li>
<li>Velocciraptor: Former 3a regional side that joined the league in 1999-00 and won it in their debut season. A strong side, they also won back-to-back Cups in 2003 and 2004 before amazingly resigning from the league due to lack of players midway through the 2005-06 season while in a strong position.</li>
<li>Cranks: Played just one season in 2003-04 and finished third from bottom. Some of the players went on to form part of the current Pechekali team.</li>
