<h2><span class="mw-headline">African-American, again</span></h2>
<p>Sorry to open up this discussion again, but I do not see any justification for saying that if elected he would be the "first (half) African-American President" as the article said in that section. I didn't plow through history or this talk page in depth, so maybe that was just an edit that crept in and wasn't placed by consensus, but I object to it and changed "(half) African-American" to "biracial". I have no problem if it is changed to "African-American" either. But I don't think we want "(half)" in there. Are we now going to measure ethnicity by percentages? I don't think so. Did I miss something here? <a href="../../../t/v/o/User%7ETvoz_babb.html" title="User:Tvoz">Tvoz</a> 20:54, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>If he so self-identifies, he's African American. He's most definitely <i>not</i> half-African American - he's half Kenyan. Race is a matter of self-identification, not blood quantum. If he's American (which he is) and black (which he is) he's African American unless he chooses not to so self-identify. <a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuettarda_9de6.html" title="User:Guettarda">Guettarda</a> 21:00, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That's not entirely true. To be legally considered a Comanche Indian and receive the benefits from the government, you must have at least "1/8th" Comanche blood in you...so that means if your great-grandmother or great-grandfather was a "full" Comanche, and you can prove it, then you can be legally registered as a Native American. You'll receive a card from the government as proof with the percentage indicated on it. I don't know how it works with other tribes. <a href="../../../n/i/a/User%7ENiasain_faac.html" title="User:Niasain">Niasain</a> 19:33, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree with that. He is indeed African-American, and in his case that's not just a euphemism, or currently acceptable term. And mostly, the page should be consistent. (I believe he also self-identifies as biracial, by the way, but either way is fine with me. Just not "half".) <a href="../../../t/v/o/User%7ETvoz_babb.html" title="User:Tvoz">Tvoz</a> 21:03, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Fine with me. I didn't insert the sentence, but I could not let it remain as it was with a parenthetical "half". Surprised no one noticed this before, in fact <a href="../../../t/v/o/User%7ETvoz_babb.html" title="User:Tvoz">Tvoz</a> 22:38, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>If he does announce his candidacy, the discussion will come up again; and, I believe social perceptions should not be used when that time comes. It is 2006. I would however accept first non-Caucasian. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShakam_b4e8.html" title="User:Shakam">Shakam</a> 06:28, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>The way I see it Jersyko was right to remove it... pure uncited speculation. Considering the nature of the race discussion, we should probably not refer to Obama racially unless using something from a reliable source. In that case the racial designation should match the source (similar to the "African American" designation in the first paragraph from the Senate Historical Office). It is not our place as Wikipedia editors to give him a racial designation per <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>. --<a href="../../../r/t/r/User%7ERtrev_b641.html" title="User:Rtrev">Rtrev</a> 06:39, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Shakam, referring to Obama as the first non-white.. is a little crude. Reasonorgan 09:20, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I do not understand? <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShakam_b4e8.html" title="User:Shakam">Shakam</a> 00:48, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
This argument is absurd. For one, how can you state he is a non-caucasian, when he is half white? If you are going to argue that he is a non-Caucasian, he is also a non-African American. It is a contradiction to deny that he is Caucasian and claim he is African-American, when it is clear that he is NEITHER pure African-American nor Caucasian. <a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKelvinator_1860.html" title="User:Kelvinator">Kelvinator</a> 23:49, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think you all are misinterpreting what I am trying to say. For weeks I tried to get "first African-American" removed because he is not African-American, he is a black/white biracial. I was just saying that since the <a href="../../../j/o/k/Joke.html" title="Joke">Nazi Police</a> is around, if he announces his canidacy, they will try to add African-American as a qualifier. I would first suggest putting "first bi-racial" but "they" wouldn't even allow that for the introduction to this article. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShakam_b4e8.html" title="User:Shakam">Shakam</a> 00:44, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Shakam, I find your nazi police joke very offensive and would ask you to remove it. <a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJasper23_de2f.html" title="User:Jasper23">Jasper23</a> 02:21, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I agree, it isn't correct to label him as an African-American, but unfortunately this is a byproduct of American racial categorization. If you notice, the reference for the "African-American" statement in the first line directs to a US Senate page. It is the government that's classifying him African-American. <a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKelvinator_1860.html" title="User:Kelvinator">Kelvinator</a> 00:57, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>So why not "biracial" and avoid all of this nonsense? <a href="../../../t/v/o/User%7ETvoz_babb.html" title="User:Tvoz">Tvoz</a> 02:10, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Read through the archives. There is a very lengthy discussion that led us to the compromise statement that is currently in the article. <a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJasper23_de2f.html" title="User:Jasper23">Jasper23</a> 02:16, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I finally got around to reading the archives, and no, I don't believe the issue is resolved. While it is true that Obama himself claims to be African-American and the US Senate page identifies him as an African-American, it is a very valid point that he is biracial. This is a fact. Yet, the sentence in question makes no reference to this, and just says outright that he is African-American. <a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKelvinator_1860.html" title="User:Kelvinator">Kelvinator</a> 03:02, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Nevermind, anyway I think consensus has been reached in the archive pages and what you bring up has been brought up before. I think I will bow out of this conversation. Have fun hashing it out. <a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJasper23_de2f.html" title="User:Jasper23">Jasper23</a> 03:11, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Gzkn suggested this:
<dl>
<dd><i>3) Anyway, with regard to the lead, I took what you wrote above and came up with another compromise: "Obama, who is multiracial, is the fifth African American Senator in U.S. history and the only African American now serving in the Senate, according to the Senate Historical Office."</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>There was no opposition to this suggestion, yet there has not been a change made that makes note of his mixed ethnicity. Yes, the suggestion was brought up, but no, there was no discussion of it. <a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKelvinator_1860.html" title="User:Kelvinator">Kelvinator</a> 03:27, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Here is my "how I really feel rant." Don't we all have mixed ethnicity? Do you believe in pure race? I for one don't. For me it is a lot easier to label him with a social construct than a falsely constructed pseudo-biological one. Obama is an African-American. It is silly to argue otherwise. Who cares if he is biracial or multiracial? If Obama wants to be black, let him be black. If he wants to be African-American, I am fine with that too. Who are you to tell him who he is and who he cant be. Let him put himself in his own box. <a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJasper23_de2f.html" title="User:Jasper23">Jasper23</a> 03:37, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Jasper23, I agree with you, race is a social construct. However, the argument made before (and this will be the last time I bring this up, I know everyone wants to end this conversaion) is that if you accept race as a social construct, you are acknowledging that it is a <i>subjective</i> viewpoint. <a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKelvinator_1860.html" title="User:Kelvinator">Kelvinator</a> 04:08, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Regarding changes to the intro, I'm not going to argue about it any further here. I support the version currently in the article, as it's sourced to an undoubtedly <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a> and does not say that Obama is <i>objectively</i> African-American, but rather that a particular source says he is African-American. I support this, as it is indisputably accurate to say that the Senate historical office says he is the 5th Af-Am and only currently serving Af-Am. We can question the Senate historical office all we want. But that's what it says. This Wikipedia article doing no more than repeating the office's claim, with the caveat that it is, in fact, the Senate historical office making the claim, is the best way for us to adhere to Wikipedia policies and guidelines. This has been talked to death, and the current version is an acceptable compromise. Basically, I don't see any improvement over the current compromise, in terms of Wikipedia policy, in any other proposals. · <b><a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJersyko_510d.html" title="User:Jersyko"><font color="#709070">j e r s y k o</font></a></b> <i><a href="../../../j/e/r/User_talk%7EJersyko_3ca3.html" title="User talk:Jersyko"><font color="#007BA7" size="1">talk</font></a></i> · 03:39, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><i>Here is my "how I really feel rant." Don't we all have mixed ethnicity? Do you believe in pure race? I for one don't. For me it is a lot easier to label him with a social construct than a falsely constructed pseudo-biological one. Obama is an African-American. It is silly to argue otherwise. Who cares if he is biracial or multiracial? If Obama wants to be black, let him be black. If he wants to be African-American, I am fine with that too. Who are you to tell him who he is and who he cant be. Let him put himself in his own box. Jasper23 03:37</i></dd>

<p>Falsely constructed biological one? I think the social construct is false. And even though we all have mixed "ethnicity", his is diametric.

<li>Per Wikipedia guidelines, Wikipedia uses a subject's self-identification where known. See <a href="../../../s/t/y/Wikipedia%7ESTYLE_9773.html#Identity" title="Wikipedia:STYLE">Wikipedia:STYLE#Identity</a>. If this were an obvious mis-identification (if, for example, Obama self-identified that he was neither African-American nor bi-racial, but rather "a rubber accordion from the planet Venus, manufactured by elves"), it might be a close case. However, the American usage of African-American includes individuals with mixed origins, so WP guidelines and common sense both support using Obama's identity. Also, if say, his father was of Italian descent and his mother was not, nobody would really complain if Obama self-identified as "the first Italian-American to march at the head of the Rose Bowl parade" or whatever. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheronJ_75b8.html" title="User:TheronJ">TheronJ</a> 15:01, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I was reading this back (and I admit I haven't yet read the archived discussions), and I thought I would add my own point-of-view. I'm from Hawaii, where just about everyone is multiracial. For us, one of the big things is being part <a href="../../../n/a/t/Native_Hawaiian_7feb.html" title="Native Hawaiian">Native Hawaiian</a>. However, since full Hawaiians are very rare (I've met two in my life), most people are content to identify as "part-Hawaiian". This takes out the (ludicrous) claim that you are full Hawaiian as well as indicating that you identify with that racial background especially. Now, I'm not sure if there is the same connotation for African heritage, as honestly I've never met an African-American. But I would wonder if it's possible to identify Obama as "part-African"...it's not a fractional quantifier, but it indicated briefly his heritage. I'm sure you guys have come up with many different compromises, so I won't puff myself up to say this is any better, but in case it hasn't yet been suggested, here you go. Otherwise, I'd like to thank everyone who contributed to this article; it's really well-done, and it's nice to see such attention on a (sort-of) Hawaii-related article. —<a href="../../../k/e/a/User%7EKeakealani_18ec.html" title="User:Keakealani"><font color="#8100B4">K</font></a><a href="../../../k/e/a/User%7EKeakealani_Esperanza_a49d.html" title="User:Keakealani/Esperanza"><font color="#2F690D">e</font></a><a href="../../../k/e/a/User%7EKeakealani_18ec.html" title="User:Keakealani"><font color="#8100B4">akealani</font></a> 18:45, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Regardless of what colour his father was the simple fact is that Obama, while African descended, for certain, does not fall under the classical definition of 'African American' in that he is not descended from black slaves brought to the Americas during the trans-Atlantic slave trade. This is a divisive statement, I know, which causes harm to those who would see him as a bridge which connects individuals high over the tides of racial and ethnic strife in this country, but it's the truth.</p>
<p>Calling people who've emigrated here recently 'African Americans' is detrimental to that ethnic group's social progress. As a Caribbean/West-Indian American, the distinction is paramount to understanding the several racial tensions in this country. For instance-- Affirmative Action, intended to lift up African Americans through job opportunities, is more often than not used to seat black people of more direct African descent and/or Caribbean/West Indian people, which boxes the 'socially native' black people out of the competition for spots in schools and jobs that are by law, made available for them.</p>
<p>Self -identification makes little sense in the context of fact. You can't entertain a consensus (whether it's a one man consensus or wiki-style)whereby Michael Jackson is a Caucasian simply because he identifies w/ Caucasian people more than he does the African American. 207.190.217.90 19:32, 28 December 2006 (UTC)Refractions of the Dawn</p>

<dd>My parents are both first generation immigrants (from Scotland and India respectively) who have both been US citizens since the 1980's. I am thus biracial, Indian and Scottish. I was born in the United States, however, and have lived here pretty much all my life (vacation time not included). I don't consider myself "half indian" or "half scottish" when thinking of my country. I am American through and through. That's the beauty of this country. We shouldn't even be debating about what color he is - I'm not half brown. As a matter of statistical interest, we could mention he is the first <i>biracial</i> president. Anything else is taking the matter out of hand. The focus should be on his qualities as a president - not on his ancestry and the semantics of his race. <a href="../../../m/r/m/User%7EMrmaroon25_8321.html" title="User:Mrmaroon25">Mrmaroon25</a> 18:38, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think his article should classify him as being black, as opposed to the much more exclusive term African-American. I think black people should all be called black, because they're not all of African descent.

<p>Well, you guys can quibble about how you want to classify him based on the colour of his skin if you want to waste your time like that. The only kind of American I will refer to Barack Obama as is a Great-American, and hopefully soon, I will be able to call him a Presidential-American. Fuck labels and categories. His 2004 DNC Keynote Address talked about how much he hated the 'slice and dice' job people are doing to divide this country into categories, be it Red State/Blue State, White America, Black America, Gay America, Straight America-Barack Obama himself only acknowledges one America-Our America.

<p>The statement below is deeply unfair-- and is completely incorrect. It oversimplifies what it means to be an African American, limiting that to having multi-generational roots in America. The fact is, any fair-minded person can see that Obama has to deal with the reality of racism any time he leaves his home in the United States. The fact is that if someone has even one eighth African heritage in this country-- and it shows in their features in any way-- they have to contend with racism as an undeniable reality in this country.</p>
<p>America is a great country, but for if someone has any visible African heritage at all--you can be 100% sure they will encounter racism during their lifetime. Barak Obama is of 50% African heritage and he is American. That is more than enough to call him African American with no hesitation and no second thoughts. Saying, in effect, that his status "doesn't count" also oversimplifies the entire African American community in the USA-- the African American community is hugely diverse-- ranging from predominantly priveledged, highly educated, hugely successful, on the one hand; all the way over to poor and struggling on the other extreme (not unlike the White American community). It encompasses both recent immigrants and those who have roots here going back hundreds of years. Sean7phil 09:54, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">middle name</span></h2>
<p>Please correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe the consensus reached was that Barack Obama's complete name including his middle name of Hussein was correctly included in the first sentence in boldface, as per Wiki style, and then again in the first sentence of "early life" as this is an expansion on the first intro sentence, but that since he is widely known as Barack Obama, the title of the article and any other references to his name would not properly include his middle name. Some people are known by their full names (e.g. John Kenneth Galbraith), others are known by first and last with middle initial (e.g. George W. Bush), and others by their first and last names only, even if they have a middle name (e.g., John Kerry). So I believe the name in the infobox should remain as Barack Obama, the name he is generally known as. Therefore, I reverted the last edit. <a href="../../../t/v/o/User%7ETvoz_babb.html" title="User:Tvoz">Tvoz</a> 07:50, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You know what - I don't really care either way, myself. I reverted the previous edit earlier today and reinstated the middle name in the Early Life first sentence because I was hoping to avoid an edit war over this incredibly minor point - I thought this had been hashed out here enough. The reason, to me, for including the full name in the first sentence of Early Life as well as in the intro sentence - and nowhere else - is the Early Life section expands upon the information that is sketched out in the Intro, and in this case there is additional detail in Early Life regarding his name that clarifies the intro. Namely, he is actually a "Jr." - his name is identical to his father's name - and so if we say there that his name is Barack Hussein Obama, Jr, and that he is the son of Barack Hussein Obama of Kenya, etc., we are clearly providing a succinct explanation of how his name came to be. I agree that he is not commonly known by the middle name or the Jr, and that's why I say above in an earlier comment (yesterday) that neither belongs in the the infobox. But Early Life should be used to expand upon and clarify and provide details for the introductory sketch - this does - and I would say we should reinstate it. But I mean it when I say I don't want to get into an edit war over this - it is far too unimportant a detail to warrant such dissension, in my opinion. So I didn't revert it again - instead I'd like, once again, to hear what other editors of this page think, reach consensus, and for heaven's sake move on. <a href="../../../t/v/o/User%7ETvoz_babb.html" title="User:Tvoz">Tvoz</a> 00:10, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Obviously, the name should be included in the intro. Standard practice, however, is to use only the most commonly known names throughout the rest of the article, including "early life" sections. See, e.g., <a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Gore_0261.html" title="Al Gore">Al Gore</a>.

<dd>Another explanation... Barack Obama is not from an Arabic country, therefore his name is not and should not be written in Arabic. Just because his name has a Muslim origin, it does not mean that his name should be also written in Arabic. Barack Obama was born and raised in the United States and as such, it would be unencyclopedic to provide a spelling that is not native to his native country. All of the examples you provided come from Arabic countries, so it is logical to provide the Arabic spelling of their names. As an example, <a href="../../../d/a/s/Dashiell_Hammett_c287.html" title="Dashiell Hammett">Dashiell Hammett</a>'s name is of French origin, should his article include "de Chiel Hammette" as a spelling?

<p>Why is there no mention of Obama's Muslim background? His family has a Muslim history, and there is some indication he was raised in a Muslim household, and has a Muslim middle name. If his unique racial background is worthy of discussion, why is his even more unique religious background (for someone being considered for President in the age of terrorism and after 9/11) not mentioned at all? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 67.23.164.225 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_67.23.164.225_43a7.html" title="Special:Contributions/67.23.164.225">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<dd>Senator Obama's background is amply mentioned, in more minute detail than one usually encounters here. To say he was "raised in a MUslim household" is not supported by the facts that have been presented. If you have other facts that are verifiable, please share them. His parents were divorced when he was 2 years old. He lived with his non-Muslim mother for the next 4 years. He lived in Indonesia for the next 4 years, from ages 6-10, 2 of which were spent in a Muslim school, as the article says. The other two years were in a Catholic school. At least one source (which I will dig up if needed) said his mother's new husband, with whom he lived for only 4 years, was a "non-practicing Muslim". NOte, please, "<i>non-practicing</i>". This hardly constitutes being "raised in a Muslim household". He was sent back to the US and lived with his mother's parents who are apparently not Muslim. He attended a non-sectarian school from 5th grade through high school and for the remainder of his education. He is a member of a Christian church. I see absolutely no indication that his "Muslim background" is being short-changed - indeed, the article is bending over backward to reveal every little detail of his multi-ethnic, multi-racial background. I am becoming increasingly disheartened as I see the kinds of edits and questions that are being raised here - let's try to remember <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> and <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> and look at this article with the same standards we apply to others. <a href="../../../t/v/o/User%7ETvoz_babb.html" title="User:Tvoz">Tvoz</a> 23:23, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Its really a matter of volume and ability to revert. S-Protection should be used carefully. From <a href="../../../s/p/p/WP%7ESPP_ae93.html" title="WP:SPP">WP:SPP</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Semi-protection should be considered if it is the only reasonable option left to deal with vandalism on a page or to stop a banned or blocked user from editing it. Like full protection, it is usually not a preemptive measure. However, Jimbo Wales has suggested semi-protection may be used in cases of '...minor [biographies] of slightly well known but controversial individuals...' which are not widely watchlisted, if they are "...subject to POV pushing, trolling [or] Vandalism." In such cases, semi-protection '...would at least eliminate the drive-by nonsense that we see so often.'"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The truth is Obama is pretty highly watched and the amount of vandalism here has been comparatively low... although annoying. The page is subject to all three "POV pushing, trolling [and] Vandalism" but it is widely watchlisted and vandalism is routinely and quickly reverted. The important thing is that it is not a preemptive measure. My guess is that the level of vandalism on the GWB page is a constant stream as opposed to the more sporadic seen here... but I don't know that for sure. --<a href="../../../r/t/r/User%7ERtrev_b641.html" title="User:Rtrev">Rtrev</a> 16:59, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, we'll all find out soon enough. Believe me, I'll be happy to be wrong on this. Just to say, though - it's not the mindless drive-by juvenile ("JOE IS THE COOLEST GUY IN MILWAUKEE") vandalism that was causing problems here - it seemed rather more targeted (Osama, etc) so I don't think this is pre-emptive, I think it was reactive to the situation we were seeing, and have no particular reason to think will change. But, hey, hope springs eternal. It seems to me that it is such a trivially easy thing to do to register a username, that I do wonder why people of good faith wouldn't - it's rarely registered usernames who do that kind of targeted vandalism.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Also, although it's true that lots of people watch this page so lots of us were doing the reverting and keeping the integrity of the page fairly stable, the effect it has on diligent editors who wish to track changes is they have to slog through a lot of crap in histories until they can see substantive changes, and in my opinion that's an unfair burden on a page like this one which is by definition frequently changed because the subject is evolving.

<dd>I agree with HailFire. The article has been nice and quiet for a while now. The good thing about random IP vandals is that they are fickle and not very dedicated. Obama was just near the top of the news cycle. Now he is out of it. I think that the 24-72 hour sprotect is fine. Perhaps we can be a little quicker to save ourselves some headaches when the vandalism starts but I see no need for an extended protection at this point. A couple other points.
<ul>
<li>"It seems to me that it is such a trivially easy thing to do to register a username, that I do wonder why people of good faith wouldn't" Anonymity pure and simple.

Well, <i>that is as it should be.</i> That is how the vast majority of online systems work. Why not do it here? In fact, you'all spoke too soon.

<p>I request that the current semi-protection tag be changed to the less obtrusive {{sprotected2}} and removed after an appropriate timeout interval. I believe that any move to establish permanent semi-protection is premature and preemptive for this article. I have previously expressed this view on the article's talk page, where no consensus has yet emerged on the issue. While it is true that some IP edits have been needlesome, they are manageable because the article is closely watched by a global audience. Reverts have been made by many editors, including some with IP addresses. Blatant vandalism is usually corrected within minutes and at all hours of the day. I have been an active contributor to the article since September 2006. Though I appreciate that there are others who may define the role of semi-protection differently, I have reviewed the policy documents and I think my view is more to the mainstream of the current thinking.

<dd><a href="../../../h/a/i/User%7EHailFire_f565.html" title="User:HailFire">HailFire</a>: sprot only blocks IP (and brand new) addresses from editing - it does not stop anyone from reading, nor does it stop anyone who wants to contribute to create an account with an unidentifiable and untraceable name (i.e., don't give your email address) and contribute. The edits made by multiple IP addresses on this page, as you know, have been (not always but by and large) at best unhelpful but much more often downright offensive and I see absolutely no reason why that should be allowed to continue. Again, you know I am not talking about the juvenile HI MOMs - they are also annoying, but that is not what plagues this page. We are plagued by <i>targeted</i> vandalism - changing "Obama" to "Osama", for example, and the regular changing of text that has hidden text clearly requesting that it not be changed right there, plus blatant POV pushing, trolling, etc. Classic case for permanent sprot. The result, when sprot is in place, is the ability to conscientiously edit and improve the article (which has a changing base of facts so needs constant attention). But rather than being able to easily evaluate substantive changes that responsible editors make, we are bogged down in having to go through screen after screen of pure and often vicious vandalism. For what positive reason, may I ask?</dd>

<dd>If what you were unhappy about is the tag itself, I also thought all along that we should have {{sprotect2}} and had thought to change it last time but the block was lifted before I had a chance to. I have changed it to that less obtrusive tag. The question of the duration of the lock is what I am interested in. Two-three weeks is much better than what we had a few weeks ago, and may coincide with any announcement that Senator Obama makes which is also good timing for sprot, but I'd like to understand why you would want it not to be an extended one, because I can't make any sense out of your position on this, as a person (you, I mean) who clearly is interested in having this remain a high quality page, as evidenced by the excellent work you do here, and the fact that this page has been by far your main area of Wikipedia editing. <strong><a href="../../../t/v/o/User%7ETvoz_babb.html" title="User:Tvoz">Tvoz</a></strong> | <small><a href="../../../t/v/o/User_talk%7ETvoz_576b.html" title="User talk:Tvoz">talk</a></small> 18:15, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Consensus on intro wording in is Archive- NEW EDITORS PLEASE READ</span></h2>
<p>For new editors: there is hidden text on the intro for good reason - please don't change the relevant sentences without reading the extensive archives on this point, and then please discuss here before proceeding, as requested. Editors of this article worked hard to reach consensus on how to accurately and neutrally describe Senator Obama, and apparently it was agreed that the US Senate Historical Office was a neutral source and that they should be cited - in the text <i>as well as</i> in the footnote - exactly as: "According to the U.S. Senate Historical Office, he is the fifth African American Senator in U.S. history and the only African American presently serving in the U.S. Senate." followed by the footnote. I was not editing this page at that time, but I believe the consensus reached by the editors involved should be respected. So I have reinstated the agreed upon text, and I hope that this reverting will stop. I also believe discussion is welcome, however. This is not a closed subject - nothing ever is closed on Wikipedia - but reverting wars won't get us anywhere. <a href="../../../t/v/o/User%7ETvoz_babb.html" title="User:Tvoz">Tvoz</a> 08:22, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The "web articles" section seems to have devolved into a list of articles that attack or support Sen. Obama - I don't see how these are "unofficial sites" at all. They are at best "further reading", but would be out of proportion there - they are not in-depth looks at t Obama pro or con - they are just individual commentaries. They could be used as references to the text of the article, if the article addresses the issues raised in these pieces and if someone actually used them as source material. We have to have a balanced view in this article, absolutely, but attaching an attack piece with no context as an "unofficial site" (like Raimondo's or Cockburn's) or for that matter a "pro"-Obama piece like the Vermont one - as "unofficial sites", I think is wrong on both sides. I propose removing the "web articles" section from unofficial sites. <strong><a href="../../../t/v/o/User%7ETvoz_babb.html" title="User:Tvoz">Tvoz</a></strong> | <small><a href="../../../t/v/o/User_talk%7ETvoz_576b.html" title="User talk:Tvoz">talk</a></small> 22:58, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>The above unsigned comment on "Muslim schooling" is very silly. Attending a Muslim school has nothing to do with leading the nation against Muslim extremists or any other extremists, any more than my having attended a Christian school has anything to do with my dislike of Christian extremists like Jerry Falwell.

<dd>OK. It's not clear what you're asking for a source on, but if you're asking about his schooling, here it is. Obama's mother married a non-practicing Muslim Indonesian man and they moved to Indonesia when Barack was 6 years old. He attended a school there for 2 years - when he was ages 6-8, which has been described as a "Muslim" school, but no further detail given as to what that means; he then was put in a "Catholic" school from ages 8-10, then his mother sent him back to Hawaii to her parents where he went to a private non-sectarian school from fifth grade through high school. It is apparent that going to these 2 schools from ages 6-10 neither made him Muslim nor Catholic - they were just elementary schools - and has been deemed an unecessary detail for this piece as it is completely irrelevant to anything else. Some people seem to want to make a big deal out of it for unknown reasons. The source we had for this was one short sentence in an <a href="http://dir.salon.com/story/news/feature/2004/03/30/obama/print.html" class="external text" title="http://dir.salon.com/story/news/feature/2004/03/30/obama/print.html" rel="nofollow">article</a> written by Scott Turow, and the point of Turow's article was that Obama is "the face of American diversity", not that somehow he is a secret Muslim, or a secret Catholic for that matter. Somewhat ironic seeing as how this little tiny factoid seems to be wielded here. If you look at earlier edits of that section you'll find one that I did which spelled out this unimportant story, because I thought that it was preferable to spell it out rather than just saying that he spent 2 years in a Muslim school as if that somehow conveyed something meaningful - when you look at the whole story it is crystal clear that these were merely educational choices that his mother made, and of no lasting import at all. I agreed with whoever decided to remove the whole explanation, because I never really thought it rose to the level of a notable fact either. So that is the whole story as I know it. Not worth the time it took to tell it, not significant, and not needed in the article. <strong><a href="../../../t/v/o/User%7ETvoz_babb.html" title="User:Tvoz">Tvoz</a></strong> | <small><a href="../../../t/v/o/User_talk%7ETvoz_576b.html" title="User talk:Tvoz">talk</a></small> 06:09, 6 January 2007 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Added section on Global Labor Arbitrage</span></h2>
<p>I wanted to start a section on global labor arbitrage even though I'm unsure of Obama's exact position on the subject or if he even has one. I suspect that his views on related issues will prove contradictory (favors illegal alien amnesty but supports American middle class and jobs for Americans). Why start such a section? Because this issue, a crucial economic issue often known as "foreign outsourcing", played a significant role in the 2004 presidential election where, but for the War in Iraq, it might have helped John Kerry win the election. It is a crucial issue that few Americans (and politicians and media pundits) understand, but it has in many forms that people would recognize: immigration, foreign outsourcing, H-1B and L-1 visas, trade deficit, and popluation explostion (an increase of labor relative to the limited capital of land and natural resources). This issue is also related to the economy in general, health insurance, unemployment, crime, and education (often advocated as a magical panacea for global labor arbitrage -- "We need better education so our jobs won't go overseas. Education will save us!"). Consequently, it is very possible that a great many of these issues, especially the issue of foreign outsourcing, could play a role in the 2008 election, especially since the American middle class feels that it is being squeezed by many aspects of global labor arbitrage. For example, in spite of news reports about the health of the stock market and allegedly (and deceptively) low unemployment numbers, the news reports have also said that the American middle class does not feel that it is enjoying any of the benefits.</p>
<p>I hope that people will take this issue seriously and begin filling in the blanks on Obama's stances on these crucial issues. Perhaps this section will encourage Obama and his campaign to think about these issues. If he could articulate the threat that Global Labor Arbitrage poses to the American middle class and if he were to play his cards right on these issues, it could win him the election.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by WhipperSnapper (<a href="../../../w/h/i/User_talk%7EWhipperSnapper_3c80.html" title="User talk:WhipperSnapper">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_WhipperSnapper_f2c2.html" title="Special:Contributions/WhipperSnapper">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<dd>That's nice, but how is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Barack_Obama&amp;diff=99487488&amp;oldid=99486693" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Barack_Obama&amp;diff=99487488&amp;oldid=99486693" rel="nofollow">unsourced analysis</a> worthy of inclusion in the article?

<dd>In the absence of voting records, speeches, major news coverage, etc. what exactly would you want to add to this section? Speculation and original research are not part of what Wikipedia does. Even if this is a crucial issue as you say, why is the Barack Obama article on Wikipedia uniquely deserving of a section on "global labor arbitrage?" There are 99 other senators. I put the term in quotes because you seem to be using the phrase as an attack on U.S. work visas, as opposed to the economic phenomenon of arbitrage. <a href="../../../r/h/o/User%7ERhobite_7e81.html" title="User:Rhobite">Rhobite</a> 05:14, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>He has to have some sort of a record on issues like mass immigration (legal and illegal), H-1B visas (aka "The Skill Bill"), and trade policy. I just don't know exaclty what they are other than that he voted for the Senate illegal alien amnesty bills. Perhaps the new section could start with that. Regardless, every Congressman's Wiki page and especially every presidential candidate's page should have a section on this issue. So many Americans have suffered because of it. Maybe we should just just create the section and leave it blank for now, allowing more knowledgeable folks to fill in the blanks with cited references?<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by WhipperSnapper (<a href="../../../w/h/i/User_talk%7EWhipperSnapper_3c80.html" title="User talk:WhipperSnapper">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_WhipperSnapper_f2c2.html" title="Special:Contributions/WhipperSnapper">contribs</a>).</small>

<dd>Unfortunately, creating blank sections is not the right way to go about doing things. You're welcome to <a href="http://www.google.com" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com" rel="nofollow">dig around</a> to see if there are any <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> on his record on this issues. But keep in mind that the article shouldn't become a record of every vote Mr. Obama has cast. That wouldn't be very encyclopedic. Finally, please sign your talk page posts with four tildes (~~~~).
