<p>The Deadspin blog sports page has been planting various covert links to their nasty and insulting articles on Barbaro. Most of what they write celebrates barbaro's pain and death with low brow racist, sexist frat boy 'sensibility.'

<p>Great, then take your nasty links about Barbaro and your poorly written articles and leave wikipedia. Deadspin has a typical post modern way of being satrical; tired jokes and an 'I only grew up with Mtv and vh1' sense of pop culture. My own opinion about Deadspin aside, you have no right to be putting your joke honors on this article, just the fact that you placed a link at the top of externals shows how unprofessional you are. Remark after remark about Barbaro on your site is nasty and just reeks of post- modernism. Their is a paucity of intellect not to mention good sportsmanship eg: An entire blog was spent insulting the messages left at New Bolton Center by Barbaro's well wishers-get a life many of you said.Ha! <a href="../../../c/a/t/User%7ECatherine_Huebscher_af3b.html" title="User:Catherine Huebscher">Catherine Huebscher</a> 16:45, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Not just one post, but many. And it is important to note that it is not the actual horse that is being made fun of, but the crazies who think the horse can read all the cards that you send him, or figure out how to work the internet to visit his message board. Maybe you people should spend more time sending letters to actual PEOPLE who can read and appreciate them instead of a horse who's only thoughts are food, run, and mares. The only reason the owners kept this horse alive for months suffering in a giant sling was to make more money, not out of the kindness of their hearts. As far as a "joke honor", it is just as real as the Time Person of the Year, and you have no business deciding which honors are deemed "worthy". Unlike you, I do not pretend to be a "professional", and nobody editing Wikipedia is, as none of us get paid for the job. I am just trying to give your beloved horse the credit he is due.<a href="../../../z/z/z/User%7EZzz345zzz_fecc.html" title="User:Zzz345zzz">Zzz345zzZ</a> 19:56, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Your squalid online rag means nothing outside of the keg parties and girl gone wild fans and has no place on this article along side the Kentucky Derby honors. Dead spin has no status-have some b*lls and get attention another way without exploitation. Your above diatribe just proves how fixated you are on Barbaro anyway and proves you need to elsewhere.

<p>6 million unique page visits a month. Not exactly unknown. Has been written about and acclaimed in many more mainstream publications such as ESPN and Sports Illustrated. That would lend a note to some of its credibility. Get with the times, the internet and blogs are the wave of the future while hardcope newspapers and magazines are on the way out. Just ask Presidential candidates Barack Obama and Hilary Clinton who announced their candidacy via blog. Or Speaker Pelosi who had an exclusive press conference with ONLY online bloggers invited. Look at all the fun things you can learn at keg parties and by watching girls gone wild 4 hours a day. SPRING BREAK CANCUN 07 NO REGRETS!!!22:29, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>shrug: That's not a legitimate edit, I agree. However, an award given by Deadspin.com is slightly different. While you may disagree it, this is an encyclopedia, not a collection of personal opinions. Deadspin, whether you like them or not, is a legitimate sports website, which has been featured in Sports Illustrated and ESPN. Will Leitch, the editor, is the author of two novels and has written for the New York Times. A.J. Daulerino is filing reports from the Super Bowl. Whatever you may think of their material, it's really irrelevant. It's part of the story. Your personal opinions are not as important as presenting a complete picture.</dd>
</dl>

<dd>The issue is not how many web-hits it gets or how many mentions in, or connections to, credible sources it has. It's a comedic site and the award was tongue-in-cheek, and is not encyclopedic. For the record, other awards from far more well-known sources are not encyclopedic, either: Kieth Olbermann's nightly array of awards on MSNBC or Howard Stern's F-Emmies . . . entertaining and funny, but not encyclopedic despite the fact that both are classified (really) as news programs. Saying it's not encyclopedic is not disrespectful to the site or to the credibility of the editors - it just means that the reference is simply out of place here. The award is clearly not intended to legitimately honor the subject of this article. On another note, I don't think it would be disrespectful to the horse to include a "controversies" section in the article, especially since it has been widely noted that most often, such an injury would result in a much earlier euthenasia. I think it merits a discussion on why this situation was different and the resulting debate, particularly in light of the outcome. Two sentences in the "Public Reaction" section seems inadequate. <a href="../../../m/d/e/User%7EMdeaton_db9d.html" title="User:Mdeaton">Mdeaton</a> 18:30, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Look, I don't know DeadSpin from a hole in the ground and I'm an avid sports fan, but I totally support their opinion that this Barbaro thing is completely stupid. Think about the loads of money that have been poured into a horse and the gambling industry. If you were told that millions and millions of dollars could be spent on improving schools, finding a cure for cancer, funding charities or supporting gambling, I can tell you that you would want any alternative than fueling gambling. If you think that horse racing is about the beauty of the horses, good for you but you are sorely mistaken, it's about making money baby. I have to say I respect that the horse owners are business people but I really feel that the money and attention given to this issue is just rediculous. As a friend put it to me, "Barbaro was a great horse with a lot of love," I say "phooey." The fact that the American public would rather support the sensationalized image of a horse that is a figurehead for business than support social progress or even, hell a pool in my backyard, at least that will satisfy my friends and I and not make people go bankrupt on bad bets.... In the context of this article, however, I feel that to uphold Wikipedia's pillars, if this article is going to praise Barbaro, it should be open to criticism of the horse and its rehabilition.

<p>I love how intimidated men are by Barbaro, its so pathetic! You forgot to mention the war in Iraq, guess what&#160;? People like variety of things and horses happen to be one of them. Like Sea Biscuit, Misty etc Barbaro is now a legend. Deadspin is a lowgrade operation with little history and no class, its down there with Maxin, FHM and John Rocker, Deadspin's great Beacon of racist hope. Deadspin honors do not belong next to storied sport honors like the Kentucky Derby. The way these boys defend Deadspin is so pitiful. It reminds me of the dumb jock/coach syndrome in High School. <a href="../../../c/a/t/User%7ECatherine_Huebscher_af3b.html" title="User:Catherine Huebscher">Catherine Huebscher</a> 11:47, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Nobody is intimidated by a horse. It was terrible watching the preakness (i was there) while Barbaro cam up lame with a broken leg. It was worse seeing him kept alive and in pain only for the selfish reasons of the people around him. If you knew anything about the internet, you would know that <a href="../../../g/a/w/Gawker_Media_da75.html" title="Gawker Media">Gawker Media</a> is the most powerful blogging community on the web. John Rocker has also been a target of the Deadspin community for his ridiculous antics, and you can be assured that if people had set up a messageboard sending words of encouragement to him, he would be mentioned and mocked more. As far as the "little history" goes, I din't really see how that is important. Yes the Run for the Roses is very old, yes it is a great honor. But over 125 horses have also won the honor. Barbaro is the only horse to ever win the SHOTY, which is notable, and most likely will be the only one ever. The way these old ladies defend Barbaro is so pitiful. It reminds me of the old insane cat lady from down the street.<a href="../../../z/z/z/User%7EZzz345zzz_fecc.html" title="User:Zzz345zzz">Zzz345zzZ</a> 18:41, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I now realize how powerful they are but online blog magazines simply don't have the established status as awards givers to be alongside Barbaro's racing honors-not yet anyway. The next decade or so I'm sure will see a huge shift towards online reality but while ball sports might be largely there already, old school sports like horse racing are still very much about the old school. If you want to add Sportshuman Award thingy into the public reaction section then okay but it was not an award given by decent,classy people. Deadspin can't be taken seriously if they are publishing photoshop glue angels alongside Barbaro and then claim they have respect for 'the horse.' That whole "I want it both ways blunt culture" is too flightly and anti-intellectual. (eg: Deadspins' "Negro Bowl") Deadspin needs to own what they do and take responsibility for the fact they are basicallly just ball loving goofballs. It was very sneaky of them to come on to this article and put a link to their mag at the top of the External links. Sneaky denotes immaturity.... AND OMG!! A lot of Barbaro's fans are really hot, did you notice my work on the Russ Meyer article? I practically wrote that whole thing because I have the measurements to understand his work-I'm very sexy and beautiful and I'm sought after on YouTube! I'm happy with the additions to the public reaction section and would like to call a truce on this and wish everyone well. <a href="../../../c/a/t/User%7ECatherine_Huebscher_af3b.html" title="User:Catherine Huebscher">Catherine Huebscher</a> 12:15, Feb 1 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Where is the life threat from a broken leg, other than blood loss? Is it different for horses than for humans? Also, why is it that other horses with comparable injuries are usually put down, while Barbaro was not? Is it because of the potential future stud fees?

<dd>Horses are fairly heavy animals, and cannot stand on three legs alone without causing injury to those legs. Also, horses are unable to lay down for long periods of time without causing internal injuries. Personally, I think Barbaro was spared euthanasia for several reasons: after the injury he was able to remain standing and calm, the injury occured on a nationally televised race, he was a Kentucky Derby winner, and yes, he was definitely worth keeping alive for the stud fees.&#160;— <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheKMan_941b.html" title="User:TheKMan"><b><font color="#0000FF">The</font><font color="#FF0000">KMan</font></b></a><a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheKMan_98f4.html" title="User talk:TheKMan"><font color="#000000"><sup><u>talk</u></sup></font></a> 21:10, 27 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Articles following the injury and the surgery (including those stating that his chances of survival following surgery were 50-50, which as far as I know is still true), have cited both the risk of internal injury (as TheKMan states), and more immediately, the risk of infection. The latter risk is somewhat reduced in Barbaro's case because his skin was not broken while at the race track, but even the incisions made in the "sterile" surgical environment pose a risk. I also read somewhere that due to the size of the animal, the amount of antibiotics needed to reduce the risk of infection would themselves pose a medical risk to the horse. Sadly, these magnificent animals are also very fragile because they cannot sit or lie down for extended periods, and therefore are very vulnerable when their legs are injured. <a href="../../../6/s/j/User%7E6SJ7_69d8.html" title="User:6SJ7">6SJ7</a> 04:25, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I always wondered about this too -- horses were always being put down for broken legs but no one ever explained why. Recent news reports in the last couple of days have (finally) gone into detail regarding the two major problems. First, a horse's circulatory system apparently only functions properly when their weight is distributed on all four feet. Second, the additional weight on the compensating foot (in Barbaro's case, the left one) can cause a very serious complication called <a href="../../../l/a/m/Laminitis.html" title="Laminitis">laminitis</a> which results in loss of the hoof and a great deal of pain. <a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBookgrrl_63e2.html" title="User:Bookgrrl">Bookgrrl</a> 23:05, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This idea that contact with Brother Derek led Barbaro to take the bad step that led to his breakdown is simply one person's theory. Given that, I think it gets far too much play in the article.

<p>69.228.34.119 17:23, 26 August 2006 (UTC)The shift of "blame" for the accident to contact with Brother Derek seems an attempt of the Pimlico officials to dodge (rather spurious) allegations that the track vet did not really examine the horse after the false start. There is no footage that shows this alleged contact, no film with camera angles capable of showing such contact, and, most importantly, neither jockey thinks it happened either.</p>

<p>Today someone added a paragraph about Barbaro's latest setbacks, including the comment that he is still not "out of the woods", and ending with this sentence:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>His appetite remains strong and he remains as active as he can under the circumstances, however, since his value as a stud remains tied to his ability to mount a female in a natural way, the healing of his leg is necessary for the owners to capitalize on this animal's post race career value.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I realize that Barbaro is "only" a horse and therefore not necessarily entitled to the same "sensitivity" as a human being, but in light of the fact that his life is still in danger, do we really need to be speculating on his future ability to "get it on" with female horses? Or perhaps more to the point, on his monetary value in the future?

<p>We do not need the day-by-day report. Let us sum up what happened immedidately after the injury and *sigh*, the up-to-day status. This has far too newsy a feel to it. We do not know if this vigil we are keeping a death watch or not.</p>
<p>If I had my druthers, I think it would be better if we imposed a rule on ourselves like: "No information that is less than 3 days old". In other words: no daily status. Such information is not going to survive in the long run so it is not encyclopedic. I will be sorry if the horse does not live out the month, BUT, we need to keep things in perspective that <i>supposedly</i>, "Wikipeida is not a newspaper." Except that our Main Page has an "In the News" section (which I have always thought is a bad idea because it encourages such short-term thinking).</p>
<p>If you ever looked at Source Watch, you will see that it is not very good prose because it often reduced down to just a string of quotes.

<p>If there is one thing we should get rid of, it is all of this speculation. If the vet said one day that the horse's prognosis is bad and the next day the horse is doing fine, then the vet was maybe correct for that day, but in the long run, he was wrong. Tough luck. One of our jobs is to smooth out these ups and downs if there is any possibility that the vet was wrong. The vet is only human. Without a meter like a stock market ticker on the horse's prognosis, we have to chaulk up these dramatic press conferences to human error (and the limitations of technology and human ability) and move on. -- 75.26.3.87 20:30, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This article might benefit from a paragraph that discusses the larger truths that the physician faces in managing a horse injury like this. The issues seem to be:</p>
<ul>
<li>pain management</li>
<li>horse mobility</li>
<li>balance of weight between the legs</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, it has been stressed recently that the horses condition is like a house of cards: if only one leg fails entirely and that leg cannot be maintained to bear at least some weight, then all hope for a dignified life for the animal is lost because, even though he can be kept alive "in bed", he will either die of pnuemonia, requiring constant pain and infection suppression, or he will live until his other legs atrophy. You can have a "lame" horse with a bad foot, but there is no such thing as a three-legged horse in the way that we occasionally have seen three-legged dogs. That is the Nature of the beast. We should somehow inform the reader of these truths (I am not really qualified, but there has got to be a "horse person" or vet who can competently describe the situation). In past eras, that is why they simply shot horses with a broken leg: if this had happened thrity years ago, then such a horse might have simply been put down that day. -- 71.141.246.35 17:16, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>You state that the owners of Barbaro are from "Edgemont", in Delaware County, PA. The actual spelling of the town is "Edgmont". There is only one "e" in the name. I know it looks weird, but I'm from there, so I promise you- it's Edgmont.</p>

<dd>The only argument I have heard so far regarding the removal of the Sports Human of the Year Award, is because it doesn't belong next to "storied honors" such as the Kentucky Derby since it is a "satire". While I acknowledge that the Run for the Roses is indeed older, and more prestigious than the SHOTY, this is not reason enough to eliminate the latter award from the article entirely. The Oscar, awarded annually to the best of film industry, is almost as old and many consider it more prestigious than the Kentucky Derby, yet it stands alongside the <a href="../../../r/a/z/Razzie_Award_1650.html" title="Razzie Award">Razzie Awards</a>, an annual award given to the worst of the film industry, in many actors' and directors' pages in Wikipedia now. In addition, I would argue that the SHOTY is not, in fact, a "satire award". It is awarded to the biggest newsmakers and subjects of the longest running stories. Barbaro, but mostly his devoted fans, became such a sensation at Deadspin, that articles and threads are still popping up today, months after he won the Derby.<a href="../../../z/z/z/User%7EZzz345zzz_fecc.html" title="User:Zzz345zzz">Zzz345zzZ</a> 17:01, 8 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I had never heard of Deadspin until yesterday, but it seems to be a notable (though irreverent) sports site, so I tend to agree that it should be included. We don't need to worry about hurting Barbaro's feelings. Any other thoughts?

<dd>I agree, its pretty much been these two users reverting or just outright vandalizing Barbaro and Deadspin related articles. Keep a special eye on [[User talk:Peakdetector] who has been warned of vandalism several times and nominated various articles for deletion out of spite. Any more vandalism on his/her part should end in some type of suspension, I believe. Also I would appreciate it if <a href="../../../c/a/t/User%7ECatherine_Huebscher_af3b.html" title="User:Catherine Huebscher">User:Catherine Huebscher</a> stops talking about her "perfect hourglass figure" and "large breast size".

<dd>Well, I'm not too worried about the comments made up to this point. Most of that seems to be settled down. I'm more concerned about whether it's notable enough for inclusion. As I said, I'm leaning toward a yes, and I haven't heard any evidence at all for why it shouldn't be included so I'd say at this point it can go back in.

<p>I'm one of the people who are against the SHOTY award, because IMHO it's a clear case of satire and/or mockery. The language used in describing the SHOTY award was at times POV as well. IMHO SHOTY does not belong at the Barbaro article, although it could be allowed to stay at the Deadspin article if it's clearly indicated that it is a satire, and not a prestigeous award. --<b><a href="../../../k/j/o/User%7EKjoonlee_eff3.html" title="User:Kjoonlee">Kjoon</a></b><a href="../../../k/j/o/User_talk%7EKjoonlee_1f30.html" title="User talk:Kjoonlee">lee</a> 00:16, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>Why did Deadspin make fun of Barbaro and his fans if they were going to give him an award?</li>

<dd>I don't really know much about the issue itself, just how it pertains to Wikipedia policy. I can say that the second question isn't really valid; it doesn't have to bestow prestige to be included. It's no different than the <a href="../../../r/a/z/Razzies.html" title="Razzies">Razzies</a> or the <a href="../../../i/g/_/Ig_Nobel_Prize_68bd.html" title="Ig Nobel Prize">Ig Nobel Prize</a>. I suppose we could create an entire separate section for it, but I think that would be giving it more attention than it deserves.</dd>
<dd>As for the rest, the tone and bias of the people who give out the "award" doesn't necessarily carry over into our reporting of it. A biased or mocking award doesn't necessarily make it less notable. <a href="../../../k/a/f/User%7EKafziel_f39f.html" title="User:Kafziel">Kafziel</a> <sup><a href="../../../k/a/f/User_talk%7EKafziel_9d20.html" title="User talk:Kafziel">Talk</a></sup> 01:33, 9 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The second question is valid because the inclusion of SHOTY would be off-topic in a section on honorable awards, called "Honors", as you admit. Furthermore, there already is a section that could include SHOTY, the section on public reactions. 81.235.40.198 18:25, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I NEVER said my figure was perfect! Okay I understand your points and I was attacked rabidly by Deadspin fans who were asking me to reveal personal details about my private life so I was fighting back which I now realize was a mistake that will not be repeated. I have not been on Deadspin's article in days and have never vandalized it! If SHOTY award ends up in the permanent honors then I think a link on the public reaction section to the photoshopped pic of Barbaro on Deadspin surrounded by glue angels is warranted. This is not the same as The Razzies, Deadspin does not have decades of satirical history to throw it's weight around with. SHOTY is like the Razzies if the Razzies were just getting going, this will open the door to many other joke awards from young and fledgling websites.The entire reason I even heard of Deadspin was because my mother googled her FULL NAME and they had her entire post from the New Bolton message board on their blog being mocked and degraded with homophobic overtones. Do the Razzies need to go after private citizens? I rest my case, the honor should not be allowed!</dd>

<p>This is not about your tiny website and don't give out advice to me it's not asked for nor respected, this is about whether or not SHOTY award should be on this article. I mentioned the printing of my mom's name as an example of how 'high schoolish' your website is. Your web honors are light years behind The Razzies largely because of the sloppy way you conduct yourselves. Kafziel should note that The Razzies are nearly 27 years old and run as foundation, how could Deadspin SHOTY award even begin to measure up? <a href="../../../c/a/t/User%7ECatherine_Huebscher_af3b.html" title="User:Catherine Huebscher">Catherine Huebscher</a></p>

<dd>Well, as I said above, I suppose we could create an entire separate section for it, but I think that would be giving it more attention than it deserves. Maybe that's most appropriate, though: we can scour the web looking for other notable website making fun of Barbaro and make a section. I'm sure some ESPN writer had something mocking to say. No doubt the Onion did as well.</dd>
<dd>The point is that the site has been deemed by the community as notable, so articles they write can also be notable. We're not talking about a separate article, just a mention here. It doesn't matter how old the award is. Age has nothing to do with notability. I know you have a personal grudge against the site—a quick google search for your name brings up anti-Deadspin sentiments on several other sites—but <a href="../../../s/o/a/WP%7ESOAP_5cc8.html" title="WP:SOAP">Wikipedia is not a soapbox</a>. Our guidelines don't provide for hurt feelings. They provide for verifiability and notability, which this seems to meet.</dd>
<dd>It doesn't seem to be debatable at this point whether the info should be included; it's overwhelmingly supported by editors and guidelines. Now it's just a matter of whether we leave it in the awards section or create a whole separate section to cover sites making fun of it. That's not really the norm in most articles, but it's not unheard-of, either. <a href="../../../k/a/f/User%7EKafziel_f39f.html" title="User:Kafziel">Kafziel</a> <sup><a href="../../../k/a/f/User_talk%7EKafziel_9d20.html" title="User talk:Kafziel">Talk</a></sup> 18:31, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Excuse me, I have POSTED NO anti-Deadspin rants outside of Wikipedia, so please do not vilify me. DEADSPIN POSTED THOSE ABOUT ME which they pasted from wikipedia, got it?

<dd>No, that would be POV pushing, putting too much focus on people who mock Barbaro. It's not verifiable that SHOTY is honorable; we can't put it there. --81.235.40.198 18:34, 9 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>What's with all this "honorable" stuff? There's no guideline that says an award needs to be "honorable". <a href="../../../k/a/f/User%7EKafziel_f39f.html" title="User:Kafziel">Kafziel</a> <sup><a href="../../../k/a/f/User_talk%7EKafziel_9d20.html" title="User talk:Kafziel">Talk</a></sup> 18:40, 9 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>An award in an "honors" section needs to be honorable. An award in a "public reaction" section doesn't need to be honorable if it's noted as satire. --81.235.40.198 18:41, 9 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>So just change "Honors" to "Awards". That's easy. <a href="../../../k/a/f/User%7EKafziel_f39f.html" title="User:Kafziel">Kafziel</a> <sup><a href="../../../k/a/f/User_talk%7EKafziel_9d20.html" title="User talk:Kafziel">Talk</a></sup> 18:56, 9 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>No, that would be misleading. An award in an award section should be honorable; a satiric award would be off-topic, more so if it's marked as satire. --<b><a href="../../../k/j/o/User%7EKjoonlee_eff3.html" title="User:Kjoonlee">Kjoon</a></b><a href="../../../k/j/o/User_talk%7EKjoonlee_1f30.html" title="User talk:Kjoonlee">lee</a> 22:37, 9 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>No where does Wikipedia say that an award section must be honorable. Satiric awards appear under the awards sections of other articles (ie. <a href="../../../h/a/l/Halle_Berry_1870.html" title="Halle Berry">Halle Berry</a>) and the Barbaro article is no exception, despite your disagreements with the award. Please keep in mind, <a href="../../../s/o/a/WP%7ESOAP_5cc8.html" title="WP:SOAP">Wikipedia is not a soapbox</a>. <a href="../../../z/z/z/User%7EZzz345zzz_fecc.html" title="User:Zzz345zzz">Zzz345zzZ</a> 23:05, 9 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>It's still misleading, though. People know that Razzies are satiric; people don't know SHOTY is satiric. Please keep in mind that WP:SOAP applies to you too, despite your disagreements with Barbaro. --<b><a href="../../../k/j/o/User%7EKjoonlee_eff3.html" title="User:Kjoonlee">Kjoon</a></b><a href="../../../k/j/o/User_talk%7EKjoonlee_1f30.html" title="User talk:Kjoonlee">lee</a> 23:20, 9 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>You cannot assume that everybody knows the Razzies are satiric, but to clear up any misconceptions, they can follow the links to the Deadspin article and the awards section. It is also important to note that the Razzies and the SHOTY are not identical in their purposes. The Razzies are awarded to the worst of the film industry. The SHOTY is not awarded to the worst of the sports world, but to the biggest and longest running story of Deadspin.com. Winning the SHOTY is not meant to say Barbaro is the worst thing to happen to sports in 2006. Also, I am not on a soapbox against Barbaro, I have no problem with the horse, but the award was given to him, and has been determined to be notable and relevant to the article by the Wikipedia community and admins, so am determined to uphold their decisions against vandalism by the rabid, uncompromising Barbaro fan base. <a href="../../../z/z/z/User%7EZzz345zzz_fecc.html" title="User:Zzz345zzz">Zzz345zzZ</a> 23:32, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It may be a good idea to redo the Legacy/Public Reaction sections and add in something more about the anti-Barbaro fan sentiment that includes Deadspin, With Leather, the Onion, and ESPN Page 2. Also I would please remind Catherine of the no personal attacks rule at Wikipedia.

<dd>No, right now these types of articles are not reported in the article, despite the fairly widespread publication.
