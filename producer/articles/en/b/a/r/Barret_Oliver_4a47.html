<p>He was born to the interior designer Kent Oliver and his wife Kathy. Kent and Kathy already had one son, Kyle, then aged 2. Though little information is available about Barret's early years, it is generally accepted that he attended the <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Feliz_6c5f.html" title="Los Feliz">Los Feliz</a> Private School (also sometimes called the Apple School) and continued to live in the Los Angeles area throughout his acting career.</p>
<p>In the late 1970s, a friend of the Oliver family with Hollywood connections introduced Kyle to the movie business, where he soon achieved some modest success in juvenile roles. At once, Barret on his own initiative declared that he would like to venture on to the screen. His first appearances were in a number of commercials, and this eventually led to small roles in television productions such as <i><a href="../../../b/a/t/Battlestar_Galactica_%281978_TV_series%29_f35c.html" title="Battlestar Galactica (1978 TV series)">Battlestar Galactica</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Incredible_Hulk_%281977_TV_series%29_3d0a.html" title="The Incredible Hulk (1977 TV series)">The Incredible Hulk</a></i>.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/r/Barret_Oliver_4a47.html" title="Edit section: Early '80s TV and Film">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Early '80s TV and Film</span></h2>
<p>By <a href="../../../1/9/8/1982.html" title="1982">1982</a>, Barret was being offered more significant, speaking roles in the feature movies <i><a href="../../../k/i/s/Kiss_Me_Goodbye_43d6.html" title="Kiss Me Goodbye">Kiss Me Goodbye</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../j/e/k/Jekyll_and_Hyde..._Together_Again_4021.html" title="Jekyll and Hyde... Together Again">Jekyll and Hyde... Together Again</a></i>, and <i><a href="../../../u/n/c/Uncommon_Valor_112f.html" title="Uncommon Valor">Uncommon Valor</a></i>. There was also a well-developed character for him in the pilot episode of <i><a href="../../../k/n/i/Knight_Rider_3608.html" title="Knight Rider">Knight Rider</a></i> for TV, and in a further pilot for <i>The Circle Family</i> which did not evolve into the expected series. During the autumn of the same year, he was one of 200 boys to audition for the role of Bastian in the imminent production of <i><a href="../../../d/i/e/Die_Unendliche_Geschichte_%28film%29_047f.html" title="Die Unendliche Geschichte (film)">The NeverEnding Story</a></i>, to be directed by <a href="../../../w/o/l/Wolfgang_Petersen_3c04.html" title="Wolfgang Petersen">Wolfgang Petersen</a>. Barret made a strong impression, but was initially rejected on the grounds of being too young and immature for the role.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/r/Barret_Oliver_4a47.html" title="Edit section: The Never Ending Story">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline"><i>The Never Ending Story</i></span></h3>
<p>By March <a href="../../../1/9/8/1983.html" title="1983">1983</a>, however, the casting directors for <i><a href="../../../d/i/e/Die_Unendliche_Geschichte_%28film%29_047f.html" title="Die Unendliche Geschichte (film)">The NeverEnding Story</a></i> had still not found their ideal Bastian, and Barret was called to re-audition. The agents were amazed that he had matured so much in a few months, and they were impressed by the confidence and intensity with which he read the scene with Bastian in conversation with Koreander, though he had declined the chance of a practice run. It happened that Petersen was in LA at that time for the <a href="../../../a/c/a/Academy_Awards_b109.html" title="Academy Awards">Oscar</a> presentations. So it was arranged that Barret should meet Petersen in a lounge at LA airport - Petersen's Lufthansa flight was delayed so that the meeting could take place. Barret was immediately confirmed in the Bastian role, and shooting began in <a href="../../../m/u/n/Munich.html" title="Munich">Munich</a> only a few weeks later.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/r/Barret_Oliver_4a47.html" title="Edit section: Frankenweenie">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline"><i>Frankenweenie</i></span></h3>
<p><i>The Neverending Story</i> was filmed in Munich during the spring and summer of 1983, and premiered in Germany in April 1984. Barret's powerful contribution to the success of this movie brought him a measure of international stardom, and despite the author of the original book reportedly being unhappy with the film, it is still regarded as a classic. At around the time of the release of The Neverending Story, <a href="../../../t/i/m/Tim_Burton_a41c.html" title="Tim Burton">Tim Burton</a> was planning his first live-action movie under the <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Walt_Disney_Company_cac2.html" title="The Walt Disney Company">Disney</a> banner. This was to be <i><a href="../../../f/r/a/Frankenweenie.html" title="Frankenweenie">Frankenweenie</a></i>, a spoof of (but also loving tribute to) the <a href="../../../g/o/t/Gothic_novel.html" title="Gothic novel">gothic horror genre</a>. The lead role was that of a young boy who uses Frankensteinian techniques to resuscitate his beloved dog, killed in a traffic accident. Burton was keen to cast Barret in this part, and the movie was shot in a few weeks in the early summer of 1984. Once it was completed, however, Disney lost the courage to release it, though it is now regarded as a minor classic, and is widely available.</p>

<p>In that same year, he was featured in <a href="../../../w/e/s/Wes_Craven_d976.html" title="Wes Craven">Wes Craven</a>'s <i>Invitation to Hell</i>, in the <i><a href="../../../h/i/g/Highway_to_Heaven_70ba.html" title="Highway to Heaven">Highway to Heaven</a></i> episode "To Touch the Moon", and in the <i><a href="../../../f/i/n/Finder_of_Lost_Loves_f3f3.html" title="Finder of Lost Loves">Finder of Lost Loves</a></i> episode "Portraits". These were minor productions, but Barret had a major role in each of them.</p>

<p>Barret was not short of screen work at this time. He spent the late summer of 1984 in <a href="../../../f/l/o/Florida.html" title="Florida">Florida</a>, filming the role of David in <i><a href="../../../c/o/c/Cocoon_%28film%29.html" title="Cocoon (film)">Cocoon</a></i> under the direction of <a href="../../../r/o/n/Ron_Howard_07f5.html" title="Ron Howard">Ron Howard</a>. Barret was very effective in this, but he himself was quick to acknowledge his debt to Howard's directorial assistance. The David character is central to the movie's storyline, appearing in both the first and last scene, and Barret also had the chance to learn from working with a cast of former Hollywood stars. Yet Barret's career was developing further even while <i>Cocoon</i> was being shot. He had been shortlisted for the title role of Daryl in <i><a href="../../../d/2E/a/D.A.R.Y.L._7ab7.html" title="D.A.R.Y.L.">D.A.R.Y.L.</a></i>, and he was flown to <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_3da4.html" title="New York">New York</a> during the <i>Cocoon</i> shoot to confirm him in this role.</p>
<p>Filming for <i>D.A.R.Y.L.</i> started in January <a href="../../../1/9/8/1985.html" title="1985">1985</a> - the first scene to be shot was Daryl's and Turtle's first day at school. There were location shoots in Florida, <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_Carolina_5c52.html" title="North Carolina">North Carolina</a>, and <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">France</a>, while the technical scenes were completed at Pinewood studios near London, England, in March 1985. The movie opened in June of that year, and critical reaction was mixed. The movie itself was regarded as enjoyable, but less meaningful in the context of its human/android theme than had been hoped; yet Barret's playing of the title role was widely regarded as a skilled example of juvenile acting. He and his family paid their only visit to <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japan.html" title="Japan">Japan</a> at this time, to promote <i>D.A.R.Y.L.</i>, and there was considerable worldwide interest in the movie.</p>
<p>Oliver won the <a href="../../../s/a/t/Saturn_Award_for_Best_Performance_by_a_Younger_Actor_07ca.html" title="Saturn Award for Best Performance by a Younger Actor">Saturn Award for Best Performance by a Younger Actor</a> for his role as the <a href="../../../c/y/b/Cyborg.html" title="Cyborg">cyborg</a> Daryl in the film <i>D.A.R.Y.L.</i>.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/r/Barret_Oliver_4a47.html" title="Edit section: Later '80s career">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Later '80s career</span></h2>
<p>Barret's next appearance was in the <a href="../../../s/h/e/Shelley_Duvall_ac94.html" title="Shelley Duvall">Shelley Duvall</a> production of <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Legend_of_Sleepy_Hollow_4da5.html" title="The Legend of Sleepy Hollow">The Legend of Sleepy Hollow</a></i> in her <i>Tall Tales and Legends</i> series for TV. At the end of the year (1985) he returned to the realm of <a href="../../../s/c/i/Sci-fi.html" title="Sci-fi">sci-fi</a> in <a href="../../../g/r/a/Gramma_%28The_Twilight_Zone%29_a7b3.html" title="Gramma (The Twilight Zone)">Gramma</a>, an episode of <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_New_Twilight_Zone_6651.html" title="The New Twilight Zone">The New Twilight Zone</a></i> based on a <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stephen_King_bf4f.html" title="Stephen King">Stephen King</a> story. Here Barret was on screen for the entire episode, and also did the voice-overs, but the low production values in NTZ prevented Barret's efforts from making much critical impression. In 1986, however, he moved on to his last feature-length role as a juvenile actor in Disney's lightweight comedy-crime-spoof <i>Spot Marks the X</i>. Here at last Barret was able to play the part of a normal, well-balanced, good-humored American youth, and he clearly revelled in the opportunity.</p>
<p>Henceforth Barret, his voice now changed, took on the roles of teenagers rather than children. In <a href="../../../1/9/8/1987.html" title="1987">1987</a> he returned to <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a> to shoot <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Secret_Garden_874d.html" title="The Secret Garden">The Secret Garden</a></i> with a galaxy of British stars that included <a href="../../../s/i/r/Sir_Michael_Hordern_77b7.html" title="Sir Michael Hordern">Sir Michael Hordern</a> and <a href="../../../s/i/r/Sir_Derek_Jacobi_8f30.html" title="Sir Derek Jacobi">Sir Derek Jacobi</a>. The casting of an American in the role of Dickon Sowerby, an English rustic lad, is open to question, but Barret performed manfully, giving the part a wistful twist. Next, after completing an episode in the <i>Hooperman</i> television series, he was recalled in 1988 for a reprise of the <i><a href="../../../c/o/c/Cocoon_%28film%29.html" title="Cocoon (film)">Cocoon</a></i> theme in <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/Cocoon%7E_The_Return_d633.html" title="Cocoon: The Return">Cocoon: The Return</a></i>, but by this time his natural charm and confidence in front of a camera was less conspicuous, and he lacked the support of a Ron Howard. In <a href="../../../1/9/8/1989.html" title="1989">1989</a> he was asked by Paul Bartel to take on the role of Willie Saravian in <i><a href="../../../s/c/e/Scenes_from_the_Class_Struggle_in_Beverly_Hills_ea11.html" title="Scenes from the Class Struggle in Beverly Hills">Scenes from the Class Struggle in Beverly Hills</a></i>. Here Barret broke new ground - he played a diseased teenager with sexual fantasies. This became his last role.</p>
