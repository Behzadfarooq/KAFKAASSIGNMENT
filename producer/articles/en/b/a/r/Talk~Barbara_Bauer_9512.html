<dd>I disagree regarding The Writer Beware blog. Victoria Strauss is the spokesperson for Writer Beware, an arm of SFWA, and I could make an argument it's not self-published at all. However <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> states:</dd>

<p>Exceptions to this may be when a well-known, professional researcher writing within his field of expertise, or a well-known professional journalist, has produced self-published material.</p>

<dd>She is on writing fantasy, but here's the deal: She's a moderator at absolutewrite which is the aggrieved party in this feud. How can an obviously involved partisan be allowed to source an encyclopedia article in which she's been involved? She's a friend of Neilsen Hayden, and all of these folks are involved in the issue. That's not NPOV any way you cut it. Makes no difference if they're right ot not. If this stands, anyone can do it to anyone. We'll just attack from Wikipedia.

<dd>Based on her interviews as an activist against literary scams, she appears to qualify as an expert. Experts in any field are not necessarily neutral or unassociated.

<dd>I have to say that I like the Strauss entry much better than the P&amp;E cite as a source for this paragraph. It covers the allegations of fee charging, cease and desist letters, and the AW takedown, but is much less distateful and mocking than the other source. Strauss does criticize the ISP, but makes no specific allegations and does not name the company or its principals. This source makes the blog and forum references unnecessary while allowing us to retain the part of the controversy that makes Bauer notable, as distinct from the other agents and agencies listed as "20 Worst." (However, I believe one or two of the others are having legal problems now, which might conceivably make them notable in the future.) And Mark, by your logic, nobody with direct knowledge of a situation should ever be quoted about it. That doesn't make sense to me. As far as I can tell, Strauss has been fairly restrained on the subject of Bauer, answering questions in interviews but not going out of her way to pursue any kind of vendetta. And for the record (and I've mentioned some of this before), I've never met or spoken to TNH, Victoria Strauss, the P&amp;E guy whose name I keep forgetting, Bauer, Jules, or anyone else mentioned here, with one exception. Nor have I ever posted to Absolute Write. My interest in this article is simply to convey an accurate and fair picture of Barbara Bauer and why she is notable. That includes both the positives and the well-sourced gist of the negatives. The current wording does this, without directly accusing her of any wrongdoing. That seems pretty NPOV to me. Good job, people. <a href="../../../m/a/v/User%7EMavarin_fb6d.html" title="User:Mavarin">Karen</a> | <a href="../../../m/a/v/User_talk%7EMavarin_8ade.html" title="User talk:Mavarin">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mavarin_e910.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mavarin">contribs</a> 06:18, 16 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Mavarin, I'm not sure why you volunteered this disclaimer "for the record". I just came across a blog full of foul comments about myself in which you and, I suppose other editors here, were participating, including one of the persons you list above. You do seem to have some connection at least as a correspondent. If the purpose of the assertion is to show that you are neutral and uninvolved, then your statement is neither needed nor sufficient. We don't require editors to be neutral, just their edits. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_Beback_8185.html" title="User:Will Beback">Will Beback</a> 06:49, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sorry about that. I suppose that was unclear out of context. I was responding to something from another subheading above, which implied that I am a member of Absolute Write. I certainly do read Making Light, albeit not consistently, and my contact with TNH to date has been blog comments, plus two emails in three years, the first of which was to say "Oops! I posted a dupe comment! Sorry!" I will also disclose that I have a submission in the slush pile at Tor, but would not expect anything Wikipedia-related to make an iota of difference in my chances of a sale. My point was that commenting there is a far cry from being here for the purpose of supporting TNH and AW, and disparaging BB. It is also true that I have been frustrated with you at times, Will, not personally, but because I disagree with you about certain sources being citable. However, I do respect you and your work here, and I would hope that I personally never said anything foul about you. I try not to say foul things about anyone. Nor do I agree with everything other people say on Making Light - or anywhere else. Sometimes people are harsh, but I seldom call them on it because I hate discord and confrontation. Nevertheless, if I failed to defend you in public, I apologize. <a href="../../../m/a/v/User%7EMavarin_fb6d.html" title="User:Mavarin">Karen</a> | <a href="../../../m/a/v/User_talk%7EMavarin_8ade.html" title="User talk:Mavarin">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mavarin_e910.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mavarin">contribs</a> 07:38, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Your apology is unnecessary but accepted. I gather that you all know each other from some sci-fi publishing special interest group, etc. Everyone should check their affiliations at the door, and "write for the enemy" in order to achieve NPOV. Beyond that, we should always remember that the subject is a living person, the type of encyclopeda topic that deserves the most care. I think the article is much better now than it had been before. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_Beback_8185.html" title="User:Will Beback">Will Beback</a> 08:38, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'd like to clear up what seems to be a misconception about the "sci fi" aspect of this whole issue. As far as I'm aware, the SFWA seems to be the only major association of authors that has undertaken an effort such as Writer Beware. In fact, the Mystery Writers of America points to Writer Beware <a href="http://www.mysterywriters.org/pages/resources/library/agent.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.mysterywriters.org/pages/resources/library/agent.htm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. If Writer Beware was under the umbrella of the MWA or the Romance Writers of America, would it make any difference to this article? I doubt it. (Obligatory disclosure - I am a writer, but I do not belong to any of the above-mentioned organizations.) <a href="../../../s/t/_/User%7ESt_jb_9afd.html" title="User:St jb">St jb</a> 22:13, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"misconception about the "sci fi" aspect of this whole issue." Well the whole effort is indeed by this association and those sympathetic to them. I'm a writer too, but not a member. So what? Will saw the blogmob associated with them at Making Light attack him. They crushed me and I wasn't allowed to defend myself. When I did I became guilty of "incivility." How convienient. VS is a moderator at Absolutewrite and part of the whole shutdown fight. Can't you see the inbreeding in this by members, forum posters, and this vendetta? Not being a member of SFWA is a real bifurcation of the issue. The records are clear on this. You may just be a fan or reader of the forums and blogs and jumped on the bandwagon, but bandwagon it is just the same? I mean Karen was running back and forth to Making Light and complaining about me for months. From there they mounted a defense and this is the result, not to mention the source of the article in the first place. This is epic denial of documented facts and history of the conflict. My problem is reporting a "rumor" cause in an encyclopedia. It could be linked to but not claimed as fact in the article for starters. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarky48_ac6f.html" title="User:Marky48">Marky48</a> 00:13, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"I will also disclose that I have a submission in the slush pile at Tor." Yeah, there's no connection to defending the cause to the death there. No sir. Albeit probably won't help when money is on the line for the company. This is how connected the editors here are. Possibly Jules has too? Sci-fi is his genre according to his page. Does anyone think this is not evidence of bias? Conflict of interest r' us<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarky48_ac6f.html" title="User:Marky48">Marky48</a> 00:24, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Oh, I knew you would jump on that. First of all, Mark, if I were a friend of Teresa, my submission probably wouldn't be a week away from its 6 month anniversary on the slush pile with no response. That's how well connected I am. Patrick or some first reader (probably not Teresa) will either reject it or ask to see more, and nothing I do or say here will affect that outcome one way or the other. (Nor should it.) Second, I have no reason to want "revenge" on BB. She's never done anything to me. I have no connection whatsoever to AW, other than reading a few pages in connection with this article, and no connection to anyone who has received a C&amp;D from her. Even Teresa hasn't actually been harmed by her - and from what I've seen, Teresa can take care of herself with no help from timid, inoffensive me. Third, I don't believe in revenge. I believe in truth, and compassion, and fairness, and redemption. That's why many of my edits to this article have been to add the "positive" and neutral material: the singing, the PhD, and the podcast were all originally added by me. The only thing I want to see happen to BB herself is for her to be prodded or inspired or educated or lucky enough to change her practices and start placing books for her clients with major publishers again, if indeed she isn't doing so now. A Wikipedia article is unlikely to accomplish that, but in its present form it's not going to do her substantial harm, either. I don't want anyone, anywhere, to suffer over a Wikipedia article, but I also don't want to truth to suffer over a suppression of relevant, well-sourced information. And finally, with the exception of TNH, BB (extremely vaguely) and one other person, I was never aware of the existence of anybody involved in this mess until I read the Making Light article about the AW takedown, and the comment thread that followed.

<p>Hence, "albeit probably won't help" as I said. Connections are connections. Invloved in the blog world in THIS issue translates to being involved on behalf of one side, thus a conflict of interest. Karen you are the prize winner when it comes to admitting to a charge and then magically waving it off as inconsequential. It's happened every time. This doesn't mean you have dinner with the Neilsen Haydens in Brooklyn. Or are on the board of directors of SFWA. I think that would require legitimate publication to start with? It means, 1. You came here from the blog in question. 2. You support the position of the blog and owner, who happens to be the editor of a publishing company where you've submitted work and has had negative run ins with the subject of the article. 3. You've gone back and forth in trying to discredit me, an apparent enemy of said group, by virtue of disagreeing with the "consensus" choiresque audience there on the "Bauer influence" on matters of the world. Aside that list you are typically neutral. End of story.<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarky48_ac6f.html" title="User:Marky48">Marky48</a> 02:50, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sorry about that. As for the article, I think it's looking very good now. It leads with her achievements, factually and neutrally reported. The negatives are attributed to reliable sources, and stated in such as way that Wikipedia is not actually accusing her of anything, but merely reporting substantiated allegations for which she is notable. It's also a plus that the two sources aren't themselves too vitriolic in tone, compared with most of what we've reviewed, and balanced by five positive citations. The remaining thing that probably needs to be done is the removal of two of the three external links. The first one is Bauer's main page and should stay. The second is a duplication of reference #7. The third is a blog, albeit the blog of a fairly notable writer. We don't need that at this point; it's overkill IMO.

<dd>Well, it looks reasonably good to me. The last paragraph doesn't flow particularly smoothly -- the repetition of "is also alleged" near the starts of two sentences in it is annoying.

An edit confilct. I have found one of her clients who claims a sale to a small, but well-known, press. I'm waiting for confirmation on Bauer's page or at another reliable site. Still, I'm not sure that it will help unless Bauer is somehow given credit as the agent who made the deal.

<p>There have been a number of complaints on internet message boards about the fees that Bauer charges.

<dd>The sentence is well-sourced, and there isn't even a link to Absolute Write on the page. (Indeed, the article doesn't mention whether they ever went back online.) I did try to figure out a nice clean way to acknowledge the idea that Bauer may not have been the <i>sole</i> cause of the incident, but it's tricky to do without going beyond the scope of the source provided. It is also difficult to soften the allegation against Bauer without implicating someone else.

There's analysis of what he said on Making Light, but that's third-party non-reliable commentary on a barely-reliable source to start with. That said, I'm not sure how wikipedia policy would apply to making a less-strong assertion than the one that the source does: would we actually need another source for that, or could we just use common sense and say that if the one source we do have says she caused this, then saying her actions contributed to it must also be true? <a href="../../../j/u/l/User%7EJulesH_8c63.html" title="User:JulesH">JulesH</a> 22:04, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There isn't any source.
