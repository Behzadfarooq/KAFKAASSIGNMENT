<p>The <a href="../../../l/e/g/Legal_profession.html" title="Legal profession">legal profession</a> in <a href="../../../e/n/g/England_and_Wales_a031.html" title="England and Wales">England and Wales</a> is divided between <a href="../../../s/o/l/Solicitor.html" title="Solicitor">solicitors</a> and barristers. Both are trained in <a href="../../../l/a/w/Law.html" title="Law">law</a> but serve differing functions in the <a href="../../../p/r/a/Practice_of_law.html" title="Practice of law">practice of law</a>.</p>
<p>Historically, the superior courts were based in <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a> the capital city, and in order to dispense justice throughout the country, a judge and court would periodically travel a regional circuit to deal with cases that had arisen there. From this emerged a body of lawyers that were on socially familiar terms with the judges, had training and experience in the superior courts, and had access to a greater corpus of research material and accumulated knowledge on the interpretation and application of the law. Some would go "on circuit" with the court to act on behalf of those requiring representation. By contrast, solicitors were essentially local to one place, whether London or a provincial town.</p>
<p>Lawyers who practised in the courts in this way came to be called "barristers" because they were "called to the Bar", the symbolic barrier separating the public -- including solicitors and law students -- from those admitted to the well of the Court. They became specialists either in appearing in court, or in the process of using the courts, which would include giving oral or written advice on the strength of a case and the best way to conduct it. For those who had the means and preference to engage a solicitor, it became useful, then normal and then compulsory, for the solicitor in turn to select and engage a barrister to represent the client before the courts. Likewise, it became either useful or normal (but not compulsory) to engage an appropriate barrister when highly specialist advice was required. In fact, many barristers have largely "paper practices" where they rarely or never make court appearances.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/r/Barristers_in_England_and_Wales_1ea9.html" title="Edit section: Key Differences from the Profession of Solicitor">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Key Differences from the Profession of Solicitor</span></h2>
<p>Until recently, the most obvious differences between the two professions was that, firstly, only barristers had exclusive and wide rights of audience (that is, a right to plead) in all courts in England and Wales, and secondly, only solicitors could be directly engaged for payment by clients. These differences have been eroded by recent deliberate changes, although the style of the distinction in practice has changed little.</p>
<p>Barristers have full rights of audience to appear in all courts, from highest to lowest. Solicitors, on the other hand, have traditionally only been able to appear as advocates in the inferior courts (that is, the magistrates' and county courts) and <a href="../../../t/r/i/Tribunal.html" title="Tribunal">tribunals</a>. Indeed the bulk of such work continues to be handled by solicitors. Under section 17 of the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990, solicitors with appropriate advocacy experience are entitled to acquire higher "rights of audience", enabling them to appear in the superior courts. Solicitors who attain these rights are known as <a href="../../../s/o/l/Solicitor-advocates.html" title="Solicitor-advocates">solicitor-advocates</a>. However, in practice few exercise the option to do so, and solicitors continue to engage a specialist advocate or adviser from the Bar (that is, a barrister). Not only is this division traditional; in higher value civil or more serious criminal cases, it is often tactically imperative to engage a specialist advocate (because if one side does not the other might), and the Bar is a specialist advocacy profession with an abundance of trained and experienced practitioners.</p>
<p>Until 2004, barristers were prohibited from seeking or accepting "instructions" (that is, being hired) directly by the clients whom they represent. The involvement of a solicitor was compulsory. The rationale was that solicitors could investigate and gather <a href="../../../e/v/i/Evidence_%28law%29.html" title="Evidence (law)">evidence</a> and instructions and filter them - according to the interests of the client - before presenting them to the barrister; in return the barrister, being one step removed from the client, could reach a more objective opinion of the merits of the case, working strictly from the evidence that would be admissible in court. In addition, being less involved in the current affairs of clients, including many matters that might never come to court, barristers had more time for research and for keeping up to date with the law and the decisions (<a href="../../../p/r/e/Precedent.html" title="Precedent">precedent</a>) of the courts.</p>
<p>Theoretically, this prohibition has been removed. In certain areas (but not <a href="../../../c/r/i/Crime.html" title="Crime">crime</a> or <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conveyancing.html" title="Conveyancing">conveyancing</a>), barristers may now accept instructions from a client directly ("Direct Access"). However, a barrister cannot undertake any work that requires him to hold funds on behalf of their client, something only a solicitor may do.</p>
<p>A barrister is in principle required to act for any client offering a proper fee, regardless of the attractions or disadvantages of a case, if he is available to take the case and feels competent to handle the work. A barrister who specialises in, for example, crime is not therefore obliged to take on employment law work if he is offered it. He is also entitled (and, indeed, obliged) not to take a case which he feels is too complicated for him to deal with properly. This is known as the "cab-rank rule", since the same rule applies to licensed taxi-cabs.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/r/Barristers_in_England_and_Wales_1ea9.html" title="Edit section: Manner of Working">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Manner of Working</span></h2>
<p>Barristers work in two main contexts: in self-employed practice (formerly known as "independent practice") or in "employed" practice (i.e. salaried).</p>
<p>Most barristers are in self-employed practice, but operate within the framework of a set of Chambers. Under a tenancy agreement, they pay a certain amount per month ("rent") or a percentage of their incomes, or a mixture of the two, to their chambers, which provides accommodation, clerical support and clerking (the crucial function of finding and booking work). The Head of Chambers, usually a <a href="../../../q/u/e/Queen%27s_Counsel_3fe5.html" title="Queen's Counsel">Queen's Counsel</a> or a "senior junior", may exercise a powerful influence on the members (and the Head Clerk who finds all the work), and all members will offer informal help and guidance to each other. However they are not liable for each other's business (as partners are), and members of the same set of chambers may indeed appear on opposite sides in the same case. Each barrister remains an independent practitioner, being solely responsible for the conduct of their own practice and keeping what they earn rather than drawing a salary. A barrister in independent practice will be instructed by a number of different solicitors ("professional clients") to act for various different individuals, agencies or companies ("lay clients").</p>
<p>In contrast, an "employed" barrister is a barrister who works as an employee within a larger organisation either in the public or private sector. For example, employed barristers work within government departments or agencies (such as the <a href="../../../c/r/o/Crown_Prosecution_Service_cfd3.html" title="Crown Prosecution Service">Crown Prosecution Service</a>), the legal departments of companies and in some cases for firms of solicitors. Employed barristers will typically be paid a salary, and in most circumstances may only do work on behalf of their employer, rather than accepting instructions on behalf of third parties (such as their employers' customers). Nevertheless they remain subject to the <a href="../../../b/a/r/Bar_Council_c136.html" title="Bar Council">Bar Council</a>'s Code of Professional Conduct, and their advice is entitled to professional privilege against disclosure.</p>
<p>It is now the case that new entrants to the employed bar must have completed <a href="../../../p/u/p/Pupillage.html" title="Pupillage">pupillage</a> in the same way as those in independent practice. The Bar Council produces exhaustive guidance regulating the way in which both groups operate, although in 2006 some of the regulatory authority was passed over to the independent Bar Standards Board.</p>
<p>In December 2004 there were just over 11,500 barristers in independent practice , of whom about ten percent are <a href="../../../q/u/e/Queen%27s_Counsel_3fe5.html" title="Queen's Counsel">QCs</a>. Many barristers (about 2,800) are employed in companies as ‘in-house’ counsel, or by local or national <a href="../../../g/o/v/Government.html" title="Government">government</a> or in academic institutions.</p>
<p><a name="Appearance_and_forms_of_address" id="Appearance_and_forms_of_address"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/r/Barristers_in_England_and_Wales_1ea9.html" title="Edit section: Appearance and forms of address">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Appearance and forms of address</span></h3>
<p>The appearance and form of address of a barrister is bound by a number of conventions.</p>
<p>A barrister's appearance in court depends on whether the hearing is "robed" or not. In England and Wales criminal cases in the Crown Court are almost invariably conducted wearing robes, but there is an increasing tendency in civil cases to dispense with them. The vast majority of County Court hearings are now conducted without robes, although they continue to be worn in High Court proceedings.</p>
<p>At a robed hearing, barristers wear a horsehair <a href="../../../w/i/g/Wig.html" title="Wig">wig</a>, an open black <a href="../../../g/o/w/Gown.html" title="Gown">gown</a>, dark suit and a <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shirt.html" title="Shirt">shirt</a>, with strips of white <a href="../../../c/o/t/Cotton.html" title="Cotton">cotton</a> called 'bands' or 'tabs' worn over a winged collar, instead of a tie. Female barristers wear either the same shirt, or a special collar which includes the bands and tucks inside a suit jacket. QCs wear slightly different silk gowns over short embroidered black <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jackets.html" title="Jackets">jackets</a> and striped trousers. By contrast, solicitors wear a gown, wing collar and bands but no wig. The question of barristers' and judges' clothing is currently the subject of review, and there is some pressure to adopt a more "modern" style of dress, with European-style gowns worn over lounge suits.</p>
<p>In court, barristers refer to each other as "my learned friend". Historically, this is a sign of mutual respect for the common heritage and position they occupy. It is also a reminder of the time when the Bar was small enough for all practitioners to know each other personally, which to some extent is still true; in an earlier generation, barristers would not shake hands or address each other formally, on the grounds that they were all "brothers-at-law".</p>
<p>When appearing in court against a solicitor-advocate, even one exercising rights of audience in the higher courts, the barrister typically will refer to his opponent as "my friend", that is to say without the "learned" honorific. Whilst it exists, and survives, by virtue of convention, most lawyers, either solicitor or barrister, would regard it as an anachronism that does not by itself dictate the nature of the relationship between the two professions.</p>

<p>While solicitors are regulated by the <a href="../../../l/a/w/Law_Society_d4fc.html" title="Law Society">Law Society</a>, barristers are governed by the General Council of the Bar and the individual <a href="../../../i/n/n/Inns_of_Court_c340.html" title="Inns of Court">Inns of Court</a>. There are four Inns, all situated in the area of <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a> close to the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Courts_of_Justice_a594.html" title="Royal Courts of Justice">Law Courts</a> in the <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strand%2C_London_512c.html" title="Strand, London">Strand</a>. <a href="../../../g/r/a/Gray%27s_Inn_5e27.html" title="Gray's Inn">Gray's Inn</a> is off <a href="../../../h/i/g/High_Holborn_0d0b.html" title="High Holborn">High Holborn</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/n/Lincoln%27s_Inn_7f29.html" title="Lincoln's Inn">Lincoln's Inn</a> off Chancery Lane, the <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middle_Temple_a0a0.html" title="Middle Temple">Middle</a> and <a href="../../../i/n/n/Inner_Temple_3dd9.html" title="Inner Temple">Inner Temples</a>, situated between <a href="../../../f/l/e/Fleet_Street_fda1.html" title="Fleet Street">Fleet Street</a> and the <a href="../../../e/m/b/Embankment.html" title="Embankment">Embankment</a>.</p>
<p>The Inns bear more than a passing resemblance to <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Oxford_2ca4.html" title="University of Oxford">Oxford</a> and <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Cambridge_5f20.html" title="University of Cambridge">Cambridge</a> colleges, with communal dining halls and libraries as well as living and working rooms: arguably, this facilitates the transition from <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_school_%28England%29_f90c.html" title="Public school (England)">public school</a> to <a href="../../../o/x/b/Oxbridge.html" title="Oxbridge">Oxbridge</a> college to the Bar.

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/r/Barristers_in_England_and_Wales_1ea9.html" title="Edit section: Public Access Barristers">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Public Access Barristers</span></h2>
<p>Certain barristers in England and Wales are now instructed directly by members of the public. These are known as ‘Public Access Barristers’. The public contract with (instruct) the barrister directly through the barrister’s clerk; a solicitor is not involved at any stage. Public Access Barristers can provide expert legal advice and/or representation in court in almost all areas of law and they are entitled to represent clients in any court or tribunal in England and Wales. Once instructions from a client are accepted, it is the barrister (rather than the solicitor) who advises and guides the client through the relevant legal procedure/litigation. As barristers do not operate from the High Street like solicitors traditionally do, the general public generally find them by searching the internet.</p>
<p>Public Access Barristers are normal barristers with an extra legal qualification. Before a barrister can undertake Public Access work, he or she must have completed a special course. At present, about 1 in 20 barristers have qualified as Public Access Barristers. Confusingly, there is also a scheme called ‘Direct Access’. However, this is different and it is not open to the general public.</p>
<p>The ability of barristers to accept such instructions is a recent development; it results from a change in the rules set down by the barristers’ governing body, the Bar Council, in July 2004. The Public Access Scheme has been introduced as part of the drive to open up the legal system to the public. It is part of a wider scheme to make it easier and cheaper for the general public to access legal advice.</p>
<p>To some extent this relaxation mirrors the relaxation in the rules to allow ‘solicitors advocates’. It further reduces the distinction between solicitors and barristers. The distinction remains however because there are certain aspects of a solicitor’s role that a Public Access Barrister is not able to do.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/r/Barristers_in_England_and_Wales_1ea9.html" title="Edit section: Education and training">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Education and training</span></h2>
<p>Prospective barristers must first complete the academic stage of their legal education by obtaining a qualifying law <a href="../../../a/c/a/Academic_degree.html" title="Academic degree">degree</a> (usually an <a href="../../../b/a/c/Bachelor_of_Laws_a1d1.html" title="Bachelor of Laws">LL.B.</a>, but in some universities <a href="../../../b/a/c/Bachelor_of_Arts_b70d.html" title="Bachelor of Arts">B.A.</a> - a first degree in the United Kingdom) but many undertake a one year conversion course having initially graduated in a non-law subject. This conversion course used to be known as a CPE (Common Professional Examination) or PGDL (Postgraduate <a href="../../../d/i/p/Diploma.html" title="Diploma">Diploma</a> in Law), and is now known simply as a GDL: a Graduate <a href="../../../d/i/p/Diploma.html" title="Diploma">Diploma</a> in Law. The student then joins one of the Inns of Court and takes the <a href="../../../b/a/r/Bar_vocational_course.html" title="Bar vocational course">bar vocational course</a> (BVC) at one of the accredited providers. It is still mandatory to 'keep terms' before the student can be <a href="../../../c/a/l/Call_to_the_bar.html" title="Call to the bar">called to the bar</a>. This involves 'eating dinners', a custom whereby all students must dine at their Inn a requisite number of times. It used to be a pre-requisite that twenty-four dinners were eaten before call but the number has since been reduced to twelve. Dining credits are available for participating in specified training events e.g. a weekend at Cumberland Lodge organised by one of the Inns credits attendees with three dinners. It is also possible to "double-dine" on various special occasions, where the student is credited with two dinners.</p>
<p>The origins of this date from the time when not merely students but practitioners dined together and students picked up the elements of their education from their fellow diners and from readings given by a senior member of the Inn (Master Reader) after the meal. Generally, in order for the dinner to count towards the twelve required, the student must remain seated until after coffee has been served. At Middle Temple, the students are required to be present both at the commencement of the formal meal and at the grace that completes it. This is said to be good practice for the courtroom, where the barrister must stay put for hours on end. Often moots (legal <a href="../../../d/e/b/Debate.html" title="Debate">debates</a> arguing for or against a point before a theoretical <a href="../../../a/p/p/Appellate_court.html" title="Appellate court">appellate court</a>) are held in hall afterwards. At the successful completion of their BVC (where continuous assessment as well as examinations are now the rule) and the survival of the requisite number of dining nights, students have been entitled to be 'called to the Bar' at a ceremony in their Inn. This is conducted by the Masters of the Bench, or 'Benchers', who are generally senior practising barristers or judges. However, from 2008, only those who have successfully completed pupillage will be entitled to be called to the bar.</p>
<p>Once called to the bar, the new barrister has a choice whether or not to pursue a career in practice. There are far more applicants for "tenancy" in barristers' "Chambers" (see below) than there are places, and so many barristers, unable to obtain a tenancy in chambers, nowadays choose to go into commerce or academe and eschew the vagaries of life in the courtroom. Those who wish to become a practising barrister must first obtain a 'pupillage'. This is a competitive process which involves some 1500 students applying for some 600 places each year. The online pupillage application system, <a href="../../../o/l/p/OLPAS_afa4.html" title="OLPAS">OLPAS</a> enables applicants to submit their details to up to twelve barristers chambers. The OLPAS application rounds take place twice a year in summer and autumn with individual chambers recruiting in one or other of these seasons, or both, should they not find suitable pupils the first time around. The OLPAS system is utilised by most chambers to recruit their pupils; many, however, do not, and these chambers must be contacted directly by applicants. There is no limit to the number of non-OLPAS chambers that an applicant can contact, although such chambers' recruiting deadlines broadly mirror those of the OLPAS sets, in that some will recruit only in the summer and others only in the autumn.</p>
<p>Pupillage consists of a period of twelve months, where the pupil serves an <a href="../../../a/p/p/Apprenticeship.html" title="Apprenticeship">apprenticeship</a> (known as a "pupillage") to a barrister of at least five years experience. This is traditionally served in two six-month periods under different pupil-masters (three month periods are becoming increasingly common), usually in the same chambers. Traditionally, the pupil was paid nothing and could earn no fees until the second six month period, when he or she was entitled to undertake work independently. All sets are now required to pay their pupils a minimum of £10,000 per year. Some pay considerably more than that although others have applied for exemption and do not guarantee any income. The Bar is a very varied profession, both in terms of the specialism (or otherwise) of individual sets of chambers, and in the financial rewards available. For sets doing predominantly publicly-funded work, earnings are low for new practitioners, and tend to remain so for many years. In such areas, the Bar remains a career where supportive bank managers (and/or parents) are necessary. In other more specialised areas serving private clients, such as commercial, tax or chancery work, earnings are far higher and at least comparable to those of similarly experienced <a href="../../../s/o/l/Solicitor.html" title="Solicitor">solicitors</a> in big City firms (perhaps with the exception of the highest-earning partners at such firms). The Bar is perceived as something of an elite profession, both in the social sense and also academically: many barristers are educated in educational systems of the older universities where competition is encouraged.</p>
<p>After pupillage the new barrister must find a seat or 'tenancy' in a set of chambers. Chambers are groups of barristers, and tend to comprise between 20 and 60 barristers. The members of a Chambers share the rent and facilities, such as the service of "clerks" (who are a cross between a salesperson and a PA), secretaries and other support staff. Most chambers offer a system whereby the members contribute to these common expenses by paying a certain percentage of their gross income. However, there is no <a href="../../../p/r/o/Profit_sharing.html" title="Profit sharing">profit-sharing</a> as in a <a href="../../../b/u/s/Business_partnership.html" title="Business partnership">business partnership</a>, and individual barristers keep the fees they earn, beyond what they have to pay towards the chambers expenses. The Bar remains a highly individualistic profession and earnings vary widly from some newly qualified (usually criminal) juniors who are lucky to earn £25,000 per year to the top <a href="../../../q/u/e/Queen%27s_Counsel_3fe5.html" title="Queen's Counsel">Queen's Counsel</a> (QCs or 'silks' as they are known, from their silk gowns) making well in excess of £1 million a year (with a handful of tax and commercial QCs reported to earn more than £2 million a year). Although not all barristers now practise from the Inns themselves (for reasons such as the limited amount of space available and the terms upon which Inns premises are habitually leased), the vast majority still practise from chambers. The names placed on boards at the entrances of many of the staircases of the buildings within the Inns are the names of the tenant barristers (and occasionally distinguished members now prominent in judicial or political life) practising out of the chambers in those buildings.</p>
