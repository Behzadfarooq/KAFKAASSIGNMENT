<li>Proposed award for template creation. The <b>WikiProject California Award</b> would be awarded to persons who make or have made significant contributions to the <a href="../../../c/a/l/WP%7ECAL_acbd.html" title="WP:CAL">WP:CAL</a> project. This image incorporates one of the original barnstars superimposed on a California map outline with the project banner in the lower left corner. It is similar to another state project barnstar that I recently saw. <a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonbo76_441b.html" title="User:Ronbo76">Ronbo76</a> 16:05, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Here is the second proposed design. The outline of the state is meant to show through just as the state flag does. The barnstar is an enlargement of the star in our flag and sits approximately over the state capital</li>
<li>Third design is an <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homage.html" title="Homage">homage</a> to the original barnstar with the bear seeking the <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_Star_365f.html" title="North Star">North Star</a>.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> This is a WP Award, and not a barnstar. --<a href="../../../e/v/r/User%7EEvrik_3a44.html" title="User:Evrik">evrik</a>&#160;<sup>(<a href="../../../e/v/r/User_talk%7EEvrik_9dfe.html" title="User talk:Evrik">talk</a>)</sup> 21:44, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - Prior to this comment, <a href="../../../e/v/r/User%7EEvrik_3a44.html" title="User:Evrik">user:evrik</a> reverted changes I made to reflect that this barnstar is intended to California related articles. Stars come in all shapes and sizes on <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikimedia_Commons_7b57.html" title="Wikimedia Commons">Wikimedia Commons</a> storage page. The second proposed image has a barnstar center and takes the shape of the star in the California flag. I have asked <a href="../../../e/v/r/User%7EEvrik_3a44.html" title="User:Evrik">user:evrik</a> to help me but he seems to very opposed to any suggestion. By no means is this a final image. But, its intent is to be awarded as a barnstar to California related articles. I am a <a href="../../../p/l/e/Wikipedia%7EPlease_do_not_bite_the_newcomers_ec77.html" title="Wikipedia:Please do not bite the newcomers">newbie</a> to this page.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>My intent is genuine. I just need help to get the wording correct to reflect it is a barnstar award. If someone could help rewrite the proposal, I would appreciate it. <a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonbo76_441b.html" title="User:Ronbo76">Ronbo76</a> 22:20, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>My rewrite reflected it is not a Wikiproject award. It would be called the <b>California Barnstar Award</b>. It would be awarded for significant contributions to California related articles. <a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonbo76_441b.html" title="User:Ronbo76">Ronbo76</a> 22:23, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Well then, I'm sorry but I <b>Oppose</b> any attempt to introduce a barnstar for a single state. <a href="../../../d/e/v/User%7EDev920_f8f8.html" title="User:Dev920">Dev920</a> (Have a nice day!) 22:28, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>No newcomers have been bitten in the making of this proposal. Let me repeat what I've said elsewhere. This is not the commons. There are almost no geographic loaction barnstars, unless you count the <b>National Barnstars of Merit</b>. My suggestion to you - make a WP Award for all California WikiProjects, and make it in the shape of a star. I am a member of <a href="../../../c/a/l/WP%7ECAL_acbd.html" title="WP:CAL">WP:CAL</a>, but I'm not going to say anything different than I've said about other awards. --<a href="../../../e/v/r/User%7EEvrik_3a44.html" title="User:Evrik">evrik</a>&#160;<sup>(<a href="../../../e/v/r/User_talk%7EEvrik_9dfe.html" title="User talk:Evrik">talk</a>)</sup> 22:30, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I still dont like them. The barnstar is terrible resolution. I dont mind the bear as much in that one - but i might suggest making the fur one shade.

<li><b>Comment</b> i was not refferring to yours as it is just two images.

<p>This was proposed on Jan. 4 as a barnstar. I thought we had strong support (11 supports), but then Evrik made the only opposing&#160;!vote and archived it. I don't understand how much support is needed for this to pass, and Evrik's comment on this was not helpful. So, I'm re-proposing it. Also, could someone please tell me what degree of support we need for this to become official? I'm really not attached to whether this is a barnstar or other award, but so many of the supporting comments were for it to not be limited to being a Wikiproject award. The original proposal and comments are <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Wikipedia:Barnstar_and_award_proposals/Archive15#Copyeditor.27s_Barnstar" class="external text" title="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Wikipedia:Barnstar_and_award_proposals/Archive15#Copyeditor.27s_Barnstar" rel="nofollow">here</a>, and <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Barnstar_and_award_proposals#Confused_about_approval_process_and_archiving" class="external text" title="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Barnstar_and_award_proposals#Confused_about_approval_process_and_archiving" rel="nofollow">here</a> is my exchange with Evrik.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> This was proposed as a barnstar and not as a WikiProject Award. While there was initial support, it died down after the first wave. The image doesn't fit with the rest of the barnstars, nor with the bulk of the WikiProject Awards - that's why I archived it. Any wikiproject can use whatever award it wants (and you can list it on the PUA page. If you want it to go up on the other awards pages then resubmit is as a wikiproject award. If you disgree, then ask some of the other people who are part of the WikiProject Awards to comment.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>The image does not fit with the other images. I would suggest making the image more of a square, and having the quill and broom cross the star and not below it.

<li><b>Support</b> I do not believe that the Editor's Barnstar really covers copy-editing, which is an integral and important part of keeping the quality high. I do not think that this should be a project-specific award, but rather a way to recognize users across the board.

<li><b>Support</b> -- first version as an "other related award". I don't feel it should be submitted as WikiProject award, since copyediting works on Wikipedia are a lot more common than solely inside the WikiProject, nor it should be submitted as a barnstar due to the design and some redundancy with existing barnstars. Although if redundancy is taken this seriously, the "The Welcomer's Award" might also be redundant with the "The Random Acts of Kindness Barnstar". <b><span style="background:#000"><a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichaelas10_bbb3.html" title="User:Michaelas10"><span style="color:#fff">Michaelas10</span></a> <a href="../../../m/i/c/User_talk%7EMichaelas10_7a56.html" title="User talk:Michaelas10"><span style="color:#fff">(Talk)</span></a></span></b> 09:26, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I meant higher, more like version 6, which I'm still not happy with. It ought to be possible to have the quill and broom <i>with</i> the barnstar, without obscuring the barnstar, somehow.

<dd>What if we went with different symbols altogether? I know that the quill and broom are the "symbols" of the LoCE, and that it's really hard to find something else that is good to symbolize copy-editing -- I've been trying to think of something for a while, now. Maybe something like a fountain pen? Another idea (and bear with me, as this is somewhat hard to explain): Similar in idea to the RickK anti-vandalism barnstar, something that looks like a pen/quill "editing" a barnstar (by fade out or something)... again, I can see something in my head, but I'm not quite sure how to explain it. Some ideas to ponder, in any case. I think that perhaps if we move away from the LoCE symbol for a non WP-specific award, which is what we want this to be, the people who see this is a project award could be happier... –<a href="../../../d/v/a/User%7EDvandersluis_3730.html" title="User:Dvandersluis">Dvandersluis</a> 20:45, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Okay, according to my count, there is pretty much a first place tie between Original/Version 1 and Version 8. Both have 4&#160;!votes. Second is Version 5 with three&#160;!votes. Version 4 has two&#160;!votes. Versions 2 and 3 have one&#160;!vote each. The latecomers, Versions 9 and 10, <i>could</i> be said to have one&#160;!vote apiece because they were added by someone who cared enough to create their own vision of the award.

The title is a play on words of "The Congressional Medal of Honor", in this case, the word "Congressional" means dealing with Congress and not that it is actually awarded by Congress.

<li><b>Comment</b> The ribbon itself is a medal - it is worn without the adornment by a recipient in civilian clothes. Furthermore, adopting a medal awarded to United States military personnel who risked (and sometimes made) the ultimate sacrifice to save other soliders is in bad taste.

<li><b>Oppose</b> - concur with Evrik and Smomo. I like the pun, but given we've already had irate soldiers emailing us about using the purple heart in a barnstar, I don't imagine this much more prestigious medal would go down too well at all.</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Oppose</b> - Since a star is prominent in the design of the true Medal of Honor, this is too similar to qualify and would make some non-US readers think it is the actual medal. Not to mention it's a felony for anyone who did not receive the Medal of Honor to display or otherwise indicate they were a recipient - not sure if a Wiki barnstar would rise to that level, but why tempt fate? I do like the concept though. Perhaps a different image, maybe a regular barnstar with the US Capitol dome superimposed on it, without the ribbon and background, and renamining simply "Congressional Barnstar" would be more appropriate. Otherwise, there's always the generic Society Barnstar.<a href="../../../d/c/m/User%7EDcmacnut_1c9e.html" title="User:Dcmacnut">Dcmacnut</a> 22:13, 8 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>My uninformed personal opinion is that if you took the stars off and made it a different color, that would be sufficient change to make it a new, although derivative, work. But I don't know.

<p>Hope I'm doing this right, folks; please to be gentle.&#160;:)</p>
<p>I'm proposing an award for this project, and would like help in navigating through the hoo-ha (that <i>is</i> the technical term, I believe *g*) required. Since I started the project in October of last year, there's been a lot of wonderful work done that needs recognition, so I thought an award of some sort was in order. If it helps, the <a href="../../../n/r/h/WP%7ENRHP_f5de.html#Members" title="WP:NRHP">members</a> are from all over. I dunno about it being an award vs. a barnstar or something else, which is why I'm asking for y'all's expert advice.</p>
<p>I just kinda threw the image together, so if there's better ideas, I'd love to hear. I was going for an aged look (thus the crackly effect), and with the color a sort of old <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copper%28II%29_carbonate_a388.html" title="Copper(II) carbonate">copper</a> effect. I've got some doodling for the award in this <a href="../../../e/b/y/User%7EEbyabe_gloppy6_5296.html" title="User:Ebyabe/gloppy6">sandbox</a>. Also, for any <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy_539c.html" title="The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy">Hitchhiker's Guide</a> fans, all the settings I used to make the image (depth, light angle, etc.), except the actual color itself, were <a href="../../../a/n/s/Answer_to_Life%2C_the_Universe%2C_and_Everything_4a3b.html" title="Answer to Life, the Universe, and Everything">42</a>! Who knew?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for the help, doncha know.&#160;:) --<a href="../../../e/b/y/User%7EEbyabe_3643.html" title="User:Ebyabe">Ebyabe</a> 17:14, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Im not too sure about the idea, but as for the image... i think you should use the original barn-star image and set the opacity to around 80% and the blend mode to screen (if your map has white lines) or multiply/darken (if your map has black lines) and then up the contrast on the map (if you use your current star as a layer use darken/multiply after you desaturate it) This would make it closer to current awards. If the concept gets support and you do not know how to do this, perhaps i could do it (with equal credit of course). I would also suggest removing the bevel. <a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThuglas_a91e.html" title="User:Thuglas">thuglas</a><sup><a href="../../../t/h/u/User_talk%7EThuglas_be5d.html" title="User talk:Thuglas">T</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_thuglas_5d0f.html" title="Special:Contributions/thuglas">C</a></sup> 01:55, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<b>Alternative</b>; how about this image; it's based on the green plaques used by the register (<a href="../../../n/a/t/Image%7ENatlRegisterHistoricPlacesplaque.JPG_92b6.html" title="Image:NatlRegisterHistoricPlacesplaque.JPG">example</a>), so it's more obviously to do with NRoHP, not just history in general. <a href="../../../s/m/u/User%7ESmurrayinchester_f294.html" title="User:Smurrayinchester"><span style="color:#77AAAA">Laïka</span></a> 16:30, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>OK, I think this one is very very nice, and quite suitable for a National Registry of Historic Places award. I support this image. In general I think award 'process' has begun to verge on instruction creep and a tendency to bureacratize what I think should be a secondary part of Wikipedia/ WikiAwards are an expression of WikiLove and should be less formatted and more free-for-all in my opinion. However, <b>if the process helps to generate nice images like this, it might be almost worth the excessive procedural angst</b>. <a href="../../../p/e/d/User%7EPedant_30ce.html" title="User:Pedant">User:Pedant</a> 20:15, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>I like this one too, but i have concern for rescaling. The barnstar looks great in its current size and is proportional to the original barnstar but will become small when rescaled due to the large background. if you can stretch the barnstar out to the edges of the background (the metal part), or alternatively (probably a better idea because the resolution wont have to be rescaled) shrink the background to the size of a normal barnstar and keep the current barnstars size i think it will be perfect. <a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThuglas_a91e.html" title="User:Thuglas">thuglas</a><sup><a href="../../../t/h/u/User_talk%7EThuglas_be5d.html" title="User talk:Thuglas">T</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_thuglas_5d0f.html" title="Special:Contributions/thuglas">C</a></sup> 22:40, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Funnily enough, I <i>was</i> wanting something that looked like the plaques. It's like you read my mind or something! I'll wait 'til the scaly thing is figured out, but I think we've pretty much got a winner.

I've created a new version of the star. The star now goes almost all the way up to the border, and the box now has a similar <a href="../../../a/s/p/Aspect_ratio.html" title="Aspect ratio">aspect ratio</a> to normal barnstars.
