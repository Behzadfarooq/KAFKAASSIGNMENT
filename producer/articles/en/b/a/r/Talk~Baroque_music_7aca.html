<p>I've taken out indications of which composers are the "most important". Everyone will disagree about who is important and who isn't. Personally, I would certainly have marked Monteverdi (I assume him not being marked was an oversight) and Sweelinck, and probably not marked A.Scarlatti, but that's just me, and everyone will have different views. What <i>would</i> be useful is a prose commentary on the baroque period wherein we can explain who was significant and exactly why they were significant. --<a href="../../../c/a/m/User%7ECamembert_9597.html" title="User:Camembert">Camembert</a></p>

<dl>
<dd>Sorry, I didn't notice Dowland was there. You're right, he doesn't belong, I'll take him out (the same goes for John Bull and Thomas Tomkins). These stylistic divisions are somewhat artificial and tricky, of course, but I feel reasonably confident that these English composers are usually considered to be Renaissance rather than Baroque. --<a href="../../../c/a/m/User%7ECamembert_9597.html" title="User:Camembert">Camembert</a></dd>
</dl>
<p>Hmmm, yes, but Banchieri (born c1557), Sweelinck (born 1562), and Titelouze (born 1563), and Claudio Monteverdi (born 1567) are listed. For instance Titelouze was born about the same year as Dowland, and Monteverdi about the same year as Campion. Now we're getting into composers that are really associated with Baroque (esp. Monteverdi). Any clarity? --<a href="../../../6/5/2E/User%7E65.73.0.137.html" title="User:65.73.0.137">65.73.0.137</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, it's not really a question of birthdates, it's a question of style. Banchieri and Titelouze I don't know about, but I would say Sweelinck and Monteverdi show enough Baroque characteristics to make listing them on this page reasonable. But as I say, dividing things up stylistically (Baroque vs Renaissance) is somewhat artificial and rather tricky. If you're looking for clarity, you've come to the wrong place&#160;;) --<a href="../../../c/a/m/User%7ECamembert_9597.html" title="User:Camembert">Camembert</a></dd>

<dd>(Following this comment, 65... readded Campion, Dowland, Bull and Tomkins to the article - edit summary: "until there is reasonable disproof of Baroqueness (on talk page), it wouldn't hurt for Campion, Dowland, Bull, and Tomkins to reappear" --<a href="../../../c/a/m/User%7ECamembert_9597.html" title="User:Camembert">Camembert</a> 14:57, 27 May 2004 (UTC))</dd>

<p>I can speak to Dowland, in particular, because I'm familiar with his work. His compositional style is clearly late Renaissance, as is his choice of small forms (songs, airs) and his scoring for the lute and for consorts of limited size, made up most often of recorders and viols. These can hardly be considered baroque instruments. I've performed some of his work (when I was an aspiring lute player) and listened to other of it, and whatever else might be said of it, it isn't baroque.</p>
<p>As for the others, I would tend to defer to Camembert's judgement since he is more of a musicologist than I. I would only add that the transition from Renaissance forms to classical ones occured at different times in different places. That and the presence of leading-edge composers alongside laggards who sought to polish the existing forms serves to explain the difference in dates.</p>
<p>I think the encyclopedia would be best served by categorizing the prominent composers in one era or another, and noting any crossover in the articles on each composer. In closing, I observe that the distinction between eras, while somewhat artificial, is still an important one inasmuch as there are so many shared compositional elements among composers in each era.</p>
<p><a href="../../../u/n/i/User%7EUninvitedCompany_c154.html" title="User:UninvitedCompany">UninvitedCompany</a> 20:28, 26 May 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>You know, the recorder and viol were used during the Baroque Period. For example, <a href="../../../g/e/o/Georg_Philipp_Telemann_cca5.html" title="Georg Philipp Telemann">Georg Philipp Telemann</a> composed for the recorder, and <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marin_Marais_c15e.html" title="Marin Marais">Marin Marais</a> was a viol player. <a href="../../../6/5/2E/User%7E65.73.0.137.html" title="User:65.73.0.137">65.73.0.137</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>Telemann included basso continuo (a uniquely baroque phenomenon) in many of his compositions, while Dowland did not. Do you really believe that Dowland is better understood in the context of Baroque music than in the context of Renaissance music? <a href="../../../u/n/i/User%7EUninvitedCompany_c154.html" title="User:UninvitedCompany">UninvitedCompany</a> 21:24, 26 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Actually, no. It is not that I think Dowland belongs any <i>more</i> in Baroque than Renaissance. I think that he deserves mention in both. The Baroque period is said to begin about 1600 anyway, when non-Renaissance styles were emerging, and Dowland died 26 years later. Dowland is also listed in the Renaissance section, and have kept him there. And don't you think that "basso continuo" came out of the closet somewhere in the middle of the Baroque Period? --<a href="../../../6/5/2E/User%7E65.73.0.137.html" title="User:65.73.0.137">65.73.0.137</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>Other than the date of his death, is there anything to suggest that Dowland was a part of the Baroque era? I would think not, and don't consider the dates to be particularly important. Therefore, Dowland should stay off this list. There may be a few composers who arguably worked in both styles, but he isn't one of them. <a href="../../../u/n/i/User%7EUninvitedCompany_c154.html" title="User:UninvitedCompany">UninvitedCompany</a> 22:48, 26 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Well, some of his music does sound a little Baroque to me (ex. Galliard a 5 for strings). Is there any reason for being too confident about <i>0%</i> of Dowland's music being baroque? --<a href="../../../6/5/2E/User%7E65.73.0.137.html" title="User:65.73.0.137">65.73.0.137</a></p>
<p>Hmmmmmmmm...very debatable.I'll Get back to you. What would you say the 5 main things that make Baroque different from all other genres?</p>

<p>This will eventually have to be factored out, as it is going to include a great deal of text, however it should remain here until there is a consensus version, which can be moved to the subsidiary article at that point. By no means is the version I am writing canonical or in any sense a "best" version, merely an attempt to get some text up so that we can get to work on it, and decide the best way of presenting the huge volume of material that the subject requires.

<p>We have two quoted end dates of the Baroque period as 1750 in the opening para and 1760 in the table.

<dd>I had ever understood that the Baroque period is usually deemed to have closed with the death of J.S. Bach in 1750. Of course this is an arbitrary cut-off, but it's as good as any. There seems to have been a consensus that Bach's style was already old-fashioned at the time. <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 20:38, 10 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree with this; 1760 is awfully late. Some composers continued to write in a more-or-less "Baroque" style after 1750, but they were a minority. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntandrus_5ef3.html" title="User:Antandrus">Antandrus</a> <a href="../../../a/n/t/User_talk%7EAntandrus_af9e.html" title="User talk:Antandrus">(talk)</a> 20:42, 10 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The Student's Desk Reference by the New York Public Library ((c) 1993) says the end date to the Baroque period is 1760. Handel was a Baroque composer and he lived to 1759, which is pretty close to this date. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarcus2_3f8f.html" title="User:Marcus2">Marcus2</a> 23:04, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'd argue that the date is even later. Telemann died in 1767, Tartini in 1770, and many of the lesser English Handelian composers (Arne, Stanley) were active until they died in the mid-1780s. These composers certainly weren't a minority--the late 18th century was a period of considerable diversity in styles and compositional techniques, often dictated by geography, religion, and social climate.</dd>

<dd>It depends on what you mean by "common use". <a href="../../../j/o/s/Josquin_Desprez_c9d0.html" title="Josquin Desprez">Josquin Desprez</a> used a four-flat signature around 1500. Sometimes one less flat was used for a piece than we expect, e.g. a piece in C minor might have only two flats in the signature (the A flats being added via accidentals); Bach's Dorian toccata is an example of this, with no key signature yet in D minor (not really Dorian). It's true that exotic key signatures like F-sharp major weren't used at this time, but I don't think we could draw a line with any consistency or verifiability. —<a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahoofive_09c2.html" title="User:Wahoofive">Wahoofive</a> (<a href="../../../w/a/h/User_talk%7EWahoofive_6e5c.html" title="User talk:Wahoofive">talk</a>) 17:24, 24 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>In what piece did Josquin use four flats? Having looked at facsimiles of his music I find this highly unlikely, although possible. Remember that modern editors tend to transpose Renaissance music. <a href="../../../m/a/k/User%7EMakemi_70a4.html" title="User:Makemi">Mak</a><a href="../../../m/a/k/User_talk%7EMakemi_7cb0.html" title="User talk:Makemi"><font color="green">emi</font></a> 17:21, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This seems to be a recurrant feature of baroque music, if I recall correctly, partly because the harpsichord couldn't sustain a note. How about a section on the instruments of the baroque period and how they influenced the style? The baroque trill isn't mentioned in the article and it is arguably the most identifiable feature of most baroque music. I am not comfortable enough with the genre to add it (nor do I have references). --<a href="../../../t/b/e/User%7ETbeatty_05ec.html" title="User:Tbeatty">Tbeatty</a> 05:17, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Ornamentation is indeed an important aspect of music of the Baroque, but I'm not sure about the "Baroque trill". Ornaments are a whole can of worms, and when you look at Baroque treatises which have written out ornaments, you can see that there is no single "Baroque trill". Perhaps what you are thinking of is more something which is a modern habit of generalist performers of Baroque music, especially Bach etc. I don't quite know. Perhaps there should be more discussion of ornamentation, but I don't think talking about a "Baroque trill" is the way to go about it. <a href="../../../m/a/k/User%7EMakemi_70a4.html" title="User:Makemi">Mak</a> <a href="../../../m/a/k/User_talk%7EMakemi_7cb0.html" title="User talk:Makemi"><font color="green">(talk)</font></a> 05:37, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Baroque music itself is not under copyright anymore, except, I think, for the <i>Messiah</i>, because of an odd quirk which might actually just be apocryphal. The problem is that most of it exists in modern editions, which as far as I understand <i>are</i> under copyright. Wikipedia generally discourages uploading tons of media which isn't being used in any articles. <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org" class="external text" title="http://commons.wikimedia.org" rel="nofollow">Wikimedia commons</a> might be a more appropriate place to set up a project of finding, scanning, and uploading music which is out of copyright. I don't know what the whole deal is with the copyright on facsimiles either though, so it would have to be approached with caution. <a href="../../../m/a/k/User%7EMakemi_70a4.html" title="User:Makemi">Mak</a> <a href="../../../m/a/k/User_talk%7EMakemi_7cb0.html" title="User talk:Makemi"><font color="green">(talk)</font></a> 05:32, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am not sure if this part of the article is accurate (Baroque versus Renaissance style):</p>
<p><i>These stylistic differences mark the transition from the <a href="../../../r/i/c/Ricercar.html" title="Ricercar">ricercars</a>, <a href="../../../f/a/n/Fantasia_%28music%29.html" title="Fantasia (music)">fantasias</a>, and <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canzona.html" title="Canzona">canzonas</a> of the Renaissance to the <a href="../../../f/u/g/Fugue.html" title="Fugue">fugue</a>, a defining Baroque form. <a href="../../../c/l/a/Claudio_Monteverdi_5338.html" title="Claudio Monteverdi">Monteverdi</a> called this newer, looser style the seconda pratica, contrasting it with the <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prima_pratica.html" title="Prima pratica">prima pratica</a> that characterized the <a href="../../../m/o/t/Motet.html" title="Motet">motets</a> and other sacred <a href="../../../c/h/o/Choir.html" title="Choir">choral</a> pieces of high Renaissance masters like <a href="../../../g/i/o/Giovanni_Pierluigi_da_Palestrina_8b05.html" title="Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina">Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina</a>.</i></p>
<p>1 - Fugue is in no way a defining Baroque form: as early as the 15th century, the word <i>fugue</i> was already the established term for any piece in which all voices participated in the canonic performance of a single melodic line, as for example, the fugues by Oswald von Wolkenstein (1376-1445).</p>
<p>2 - For both Vicenzo Galilei and Michael Praetorius, ricercare and fugue were about the same thing. The difference, if any, is in their form rather than the stylistic differences mention in the article.</p>
<p>3 - Monteverdi would never refer to a fugue as <i>seconda pratica</i>, as the article implies. The main characteristic of the Seconda pratica, in fact, was the absence of polyphony. Grove online reads: <i>The first major composers of vocal music in the new Baroque style, however, all but abandoned fugal techniques for their seconda pratica music. (A piece such as Monteverdi’s Piagne e sospira, from the fourth book of madrigals, is a rare exception.) Fugue found no place in the new genres of opera, monody or cantata, nor, surprisingly, did it play a role in the early development of the oratorio.</i></p>
<p>4 - Opera, monody, cantata and oratorio, are, thus, the defining Baroque genres, since they did not exist during the Renaissance. The organization of a tonal harmony did not take place until the the middle Baroque.</p>
<p>As most of the stylistic features mentioned in the article are not manifestations of the Early Baroque, maybe it is not appropriate to try comparing it to the Renaissance style. Probably it would work better if the section was about "EARLY Baroque vs. Renaissance styles".</p>

<dd>You've identified an important problem with the article; feel free to have a go at fixing it. I don't think anyone has worked on this article in a while. Indeed, the importance of "fugue" is overstated and quite misunderstood in the article. The development of functional tonality, the concertato style, the polarisation of bass line versus melodic line, the innovations of the Camerata and the Venetian School, the development of idiomatic instrumental writing and specific instrumentation, the development of big musical forms performed on a stage, -- all this is more important than fugue.
