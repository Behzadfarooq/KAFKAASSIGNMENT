<p>I think what was intended in the header you edited was "manner of using". According to my dictionary, "custom or convention" is the secondary definition of "usage"; the primary defintion is "the act, manner, or amount of using".

<p>Err, why? In my experience, I very rarely hear the phrases "concertina wire" and "razor wire" being used interchangably and I've never heard the terms "concertina wire" and "barbed tape" used interchangably. The modern US Army uses three types of barbed wire-type constructs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Barbed wire: Braided wire, with short spikes sticking out of it every few inches. Comes on a reel.</li>
<li>Concertina wire: A large (1m in diameter, roughly 30m in length) coil, with rectangular razors clamped onto it every 6 inches or so.</li>
<li>Razor wire: A small (Maybe a foot in diameter, not sure how long it stretches to) coil, with diamond-shaped razors clamped onto it every few inches.</li>
</ul>
<p>I can't speak for other branches of service or other countries, but that's the terminology as I understand it and the 3 types of wire are very distinct. <a href="../../../e/v/i/User%7EEvilCouch_61b6.html" title="User:EvilCouch">EvilCouch</a> 16:23, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>What's the difference between razor and concertina then? Nothing more than the size of the coil? What about the double helix vs single helix aspect? What is the difference between concertina wire and constantine wire?
<dl>
<dd>OK, hope I can answer some of these. "Razor" and "concertina" are orthogonal classifications. "Razor wire" is a slangy term for what manufacturers, quartermasters and city ordinances generally called barbed tape, and refers to the type of cutting surface: blades vs. the points found in barbed wire. "Concertina" refers to the shape into which the wire is formed, i.e. interlocking, mutually supporting coils which are easily expanded (like a <a href="../../../c/o/n/Concertina.html" title="Concertina">concertina</a>); it can be made from barbed wire or barbed tape. The size of the coil is determined by intended function; self-supporting ground based obstacles (which are invariably concertinas) need to be big enough that they can't simply be leapt over, so they are typically about 1 m in diameter (or a little less, if overstretched.) Coils for mounting on top of fences or walls only need to be large enough that they can't be climbed over, which requires much smaller coils. They also don't need to be self-supporting, so they usually are single coils rather than concertinas, which in turn means that the diameter is easily adjustable (unlike concertinas). It should be pointed out that apart from concertina wire, <i>all</i> wire (barbed wire, barbed tape, plain steel wire, speaker cable, whatever) initially comes in single coils. It can then be stretched out to give a straight strand, or left loosely coiled to give it a bit more width. As for "constantine wire"; I have been involved with military, civilian and agricultural wire obstacles for more than a decade, and until I read it here, "constantine wire" to me was a common misspelling of "<a href="../../../c/o/n/Constantan.html" title="Constantan">constantan</a> wire", a special type of electrical cable! I would almost have written it off as a <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malapropism.html" title="Malapropism">malapropism</a>, although from some quick googling, there does seem to be at least one barbed tape manufacturer now using the term. I would be interested (and mildly surprised) to see if there is any kind of official definition. -- 203.40.201.164 04:00, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The barbs aren't "clamped on" every few inches; they're part of a continuous piece of tape that is wrapped around the wire itself.
<dl>
<dd>Almost right; the tape isn't wrapped, it's cold-crimped. Yes the crimp is continuous. -- 203.40.201.164 04:00, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
<dd>Barbed wire is made of wire alone, twisted into barbs regularly. I can see it getting its own article, though I could also see it being merged, too.
<dl>
<dd>It already has its own article, at <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barbed_wire.html" title="Barbed wire">barbed wire</a>. Because of its longer history, and its use in agriculture as well as security, that article is <i>much</i> more extensive than this one and could not possibly be merged. -- 203.40.201.164 04:00, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
<dd>As far as I can tell, though, concertina, constantine, and razor wire are all the same thing, implemented in different shapes and sizes and given different names, but all fundamentally the same, and with overlap between the names and implementations. They should be merged. — <a href="../../../o/m/e/User%7EOmegatron_4264.html" title="User:Omegatron">Omegatron</a> 16:39, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The primary difference between concertina wire and razor wire is the shape of the razors. Concertina wire's razors are rectangularly shaped and will catch on your skin and clothes but are unlikely to cause anything more than superficial cuts. Razor wire's razors have pretty acute angles and could result in a nasty cut if you're careless around it.</dd>

<dd>Erm, the existing <a href="../../../c/o/n/Concertina_wire.html" title="Concertina wire">concertina wire</a> and <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barbed_tape.html" title="Barbed tape">barbed tape</a> articles already explain the difference. Barbed tape ("razor wire") vs. barbed wire refers to the type of cutting surface on the wire; steel wire points vs. steel tape blades. Whereas "concertina" refers to the shape of the interlocking, expandable coils into which the wire is formed, and can be made from either barbed wire or barbed tape. Both barbed tape concertinas and barbed wire concertinas are now quite common in military usage, although the barbed wire ones are the original version and worldwide are probably still more common. In civilian usage, barbed wire concertinas were always rare but barbed tape concertinas have recently made big inroads into the commercial market -- with considerable controversy. BTW the image to the left, labelled "Razor wire up close", is most accurately called long barb barbed tape; it is coiled here, but not formed into concertinas. The linked image called "Concertina wire up close" is short barb barbed tape, and is formed into concertinas. Concertinas can also be made from barbed wire (and traditionally were), for example here is a photo from the VN War era: <a href="http://www.utapao.org/harrypiskun/MVC-004For.jpg" class="external free" title="http://www.utapao.org/harrypiskun/MVC-004For.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.utapao.org/harrypiskun/MVC-004For.jpg</a> -- 203.40.201.164 03:24, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Sure, all of them have their differences, but all the wiring (<a href="../../../b/a/r/Barbed_tape.html" title="Barbed tape">barbed tape</a> (razor wire), <a href="../../../c/o/n/Concertina_wire.html" title="Concertina wire">concertina</a>, constantine) have the same fixture and surface to them, which is sharp razor teeth that eat through skin when grabbed tightly. All of them have a placement on permanent fencing (except <a href="../../../c/o/n/Concertina_wire.html" title="Concertina wire">concertina</a>) and have the same purpose. There should be a single page talking about the wiring itself, but also having topics within the article talking about each type of wiring. People won't tell which is which (between concertina <b>wire</b> ITSELF, razor <b>wire</b>, and/or constantine <b>wire</b>) if they were to see them, without them being labeled as such and such. I'm for the merging. <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustN5%7E12_fff7.html" title="User:JustN5:12">JustN5:12</a> 01:03, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Indeed. I now appreciate that "concertina" and "razor" are orthogonal concepts, but they are so closely related they need to be addressed in the same article. — <a href="../../../o/m/e/User%7EOmegatron_4264.html" title="User:Omegatron">Omegatron</a> 03:13, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
