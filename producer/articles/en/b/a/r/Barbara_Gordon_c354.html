<p>Barbara Gordon debuted in <i><a href="../../../d/e/t/Detective_Comics_f034.html" title="Detective Comics">Detective Comics</a></i> #359 (cover-dated 1967, although the comic was actually released in late 1966) as the daughter of <a href="../../../g/o/t/Gotham_City_7766.html" title="Gotham City">Gotham City</a>'s Police Commissioner <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Gordon_%28comics%29_3507.html" title="James Gordon (comics)">James Gordon</a>. On her way to a costume ball dressed as a female version of <a href="../../../b/a/t/Batman.html" title="Batman">Batman</a>, Barbara intervenes in a kidnapping attempt on Bruce Wayne by the villainous <a href="../../../k/i/l/Killer_Moth_8cd1.html" title="Killer Moth">Killer Moth</a>, attracting the Dark Knight's attention and leading to a crime-fighting career.</p>
<p>In her original adventures during the <a href="../../../s/i/l/Silver_Age_of_Comic_Books_7e75.html" title="Silver Age of Comic Books">Silver Age</a>, Batgirl is depicted as a librarian by day, and a spirited crimefighter by night. After a handful of guest appearances in <i>Batman</i> stories, she was given her own back-up strip in <i>Detective Comics</i>. This allowed the character to be fleshed out considerably, with the shy, mousy, bookworm version of Barbara Gordon quickly giving way to a more modern, confident character. Devoid of her plain-Jane glasses and hair bun, Barbara starts to date what would become a succession of boyfriends, the most popular being <a href="../../../v/i/e/Vietnam_War_129f.html" title="Vietnam War">Vietnam</a>-veteran-turned-private-investigator <a href="../../../j/a/s/Jason_Bard_1a64.html" title="Jason Bard">Jason Bard</a>.</p>
<p>Barbara proved to be more popular than her predecessor (<a href="../../../b/e/t/Bette_Kane_7f88.html" title="Bette Kane">Bette Kane</a>, the Bat-Girl), as readers requested for her to appear in other titles. In addition to her appearances in both <i>Detective Comics</i> and <i><a href="../../../b/a/t/Batman_%28comic_book%29.html" title="Batman (comic book)">Batman</a></i>, Batgirl made a guest appearance in <i><a href="../../../w/o/r/World%27s_Finest_Comics_0a98.html" title="World's Finest Comics">World's Finest Comics</a></i> where she met <a href="../../../s/u/p/Superman.html" title="Superman">Superman</a>, <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supergirl.html" title="Supergirl">Supergirl</a>, <a href="../../../b/a/t/Bat-Mite_ab72.html" title="Bat-Mite">Bat-Mite</a>, and <a href="../../../m/x/y/Mxyzptlk.html" title="Mxyzptlk">Mxyzptlk</a> for the first time. She also fights alongside the <a href="../../../j/u/s/Justice_League_of_America_526b.html" title="Justice League of America">Justice League of America</a> against the villainous <a href="../../../q/u/e/Queen_Bee_%28comics%29_3a94.html" title="Queen Bee (comics)">Queen Bee</a>. She encounters Supergirl again in <i><a href="../../../a/d/v/Adventure_Comics_0066.html" title="Adventure Comics">Adventure Comics</a></i> #381 when both heroines separately investigate a female criminal gang.</p>

<p>Her back-up stories ran sporadically in <i>Detective Comics</i> until the mid 1970s. During this time, Barbara revealed her <a href="../../../s/e/c/Secret_identity.html" title="Secret identity">secret identity</a> to her father (who had already discovered it on his own), and served as a member of the <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._House_of_Representatives_5a56.html" title="U.S. House of Representatives">U.S. House of Representatives</a>. She moved to <a href="../../../w/a/s/Washington%2C_D.C._323f.html" title="Washington, D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a>, intending to give up her career as Batgirl.</p>
<p>Editor <a href="../../../j/u/l/Julius_Schwartz_95ec.html" title="Julius Schwartz">Julius Schwartz</a> brought her back in <i><a href="../../../s/u/p/Superman_%28comic_book%29.html" title="Superman (comic book)">Superman</a></i> #268, where she has a blind date with <a href="../../../c/l/a/Clark_Kent_46f6.html" title="Clark Kent">Clark Kent</a>, establishing their friendship, and allowing Batgirl to fight alongside <a href="../../../s/u/p/Superman.html" title="Superman">Superman</a>. Batgirl and Superman team up twice more, in <i>Superman</i> #279 and <i><a href="../../../d/c/_/DC_Comics_Presents_7991.html" title="DC Comics Presents">DC Comics Presents</a></i> #19. She also teamed up with Supergirl in <i><a href="../../../s/u/p/Superman_Family_183e.html" title="Superman Family">Superman Family</a></i> #171, and the two became close friends, with Batgirl delivering Supergirl's eulogy during the <i><a href="../../../c/r/i/Crisis_on_Infinite_Earths_b4fc.html" title="Crisis on Infinite Earths">Crisis on Infinite Earths</a></i> storyline.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/7/1975.html" title="1975">1975</a>, DC created the <i><a href="../../../b/a/t/Batman_Family_af31.html" title="Batman Family">Batman Family</a></i> comic book, which ran for 20 issues. Batgirl became one of the main features in the book, frequently teaming with <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robin_%28comics%29.html" title="Robin (comics)">Robin</a>. <a href="../../../d/i/c/Dick_Grayson_3d69.html" title="Dick Grayson">Dick Grayson</a> (Robin's <a href="../../../a/l/t/Alter_ego.html" title="Alter ego">alter ego</a>) served as Barbara's summer intern, building a friendship between the two. Soon they discovered each other's alternate identities. During this time, Barbara dated Senator Tom Cleary. Dick, who was dating fellow college student Lori Elton, had a crush on Barbara that was not reciprocated. The "Dynamite Duo" teaming of Batgirl and Robin fought the criminal organization M.A.Z.E., supervillains <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paula_Brooks_c43f.html" title="Paula Brooks">Huntress</a>, <a href="../../../s/p/o/Sportsmaster.html" title="Sportsmaster">Sportsmaster</a>, and the Outsider, and Duela Dent, who later appeared in the <a href="../../../t/e/e/Teen_Titans_629f.html" title="Teen Titans">Teen Titans</a> as the <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harlequin_%28comics%29.html" title="Harlequin (comics)">Harlequin</a>.</p>
<p>Barbara met <a href="../../../b/a/t/Batwoman.html" title="Batwoman">Batwoman</a> in <i>Batman Family</i> #10, when the retired superheroine returned to her crime-fighting career. The two fight <a href="../../../k/i/l/Killer_Moth_8cd1.html" title="Killer Moth">Killer Moth</a> and Cavalier, and learn each other's secret identities. They formed a friendship and teamed up twice more in <i>Batman Family</i> and again alongside the <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freedom_Fighters_%28comics%29_a2fc.html" title="Freedom Fighters (comics)">Freedom Fighters</a>.</p>

<p>Barbara also met <a href="../../../h/u/n/Huntress_%28comics%29.html#Helena_Wayne" title="Huntress (comics)">Helena Wayne</a>, the Huntress and daughter of the Batman and <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catwoman.html" title="Catwoman">Catwoman</a> in the <a href="../../../m/u/l/Multiverse_%28DC_Comics%29_d45a.html" title="Multiverse (DC Comics)">parallel universe</a> "Earth-Two," in <i>Batman Family</i> #17. (Like Supergirl, Huntress died during the Crisis on Infiite earths storyline.)</p>
<p>When <i>Batman Family</i> ended at issue #20, the concept of the comic merged with <i>Detective Comics</i>, beginning with issue #481 in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1979.html" title="1979">1979</a>, and Batgirl continued her adventures. Even after the "Batman Family" concept left <i>Detective Comics</i>, Batgirl continued to apeear in the back-up features through issue #519 (October <a href="../../../1/9/8/1982.html" title="1982">1982</a>). She returned to Gotham City and took a job as a social worker, fighting villains such as Lady Snake and the Velvet Tiger. Supergirl visited Gotham and shared an adventure with her. Later, Batgirl was shot and nearly killed by the criminal Commorant; while recovering, she had a serious crisis of faith and briefly retired. After a talk with Batman, however, she returned to face down and capture Commorant, and returned to crimefighting.</p>
<p>After her back-up series of stories ended, Barbara continued to be Batgirl, but increasingly felt unnecessary in a world filled with super-powered heroes. She expressed her doubts to Supergirl during the <i>Crisis on Infinite Earths</i>. Finally, after capturing the Commorant again in <i>Batgirl Special</i> #1 (1988), Barbara retired her Batgirl persona (although later stories revealed she occasionally put the costume back on for special cases).</p>

<p>The <i>Crisis on Infinite Earths</i> changed <a href="../../../d/c/_/DC_Universe_3c38.html" title="DC Universe">DC Universe</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Continuity_%28fiction%29.html" title="Continuity (fiction)">continuity</a> in many ways.</p>
<p>In the new continuity, Barbara was born to Roger and Thelma Gordon, and is Jim Gordon's niece.</p>
<p>(In <i><a href="../../../g/o/t/Batman%7E_Gotham_Knights_647e.html" title="Batman: Gotham Knights">Batman: Gotham Knights</a></i> #6, Batman discovered a letter that Barbara had been keeping in a safe deposit box that had been stolen. The letter revealed that Barbara knew Jim Gordon had dated her mother Thelma before she married Roger, and that there is a chance that Jim Gordon might be her biological father, although he is not aware of that. Barbara has stated that she has not confronted Jim about this, not because she is afraid it might be true, but because she is afraid it might not be).</p>
<p>She showed interest at a young age in superheroes, often dressing up as one. Barbara's mother and aunt were killed in a car accident, partly caused by her father's drinking. Roger began drinking heavily and started taking his aggression out on Barbara. Barbara took on a great deal of responsibilities to cover for her father, consoling herself by thinking her father was not the same man she had once known. Eventually Roger's drinking and self-abuse caused his death.</p>
<p>James Gordon adopted his orphaned niece. James "Jim" Gordon, his wife (also named Barbara), and their son lived in Gotham City, where he worked as a Police Captain (Batman: Year One). Although James and young Barbara initially did not get along, with time they grew close (Secret Origins #20) - Barbara came to think of him as her father (which he already was, legally).</p>
<p>Barbara was a highly gifted child, hard working in martial arts, and graduated from High School at an early age. In college she accepted a position as a research assistant at the Gotham Public Library, although she dreamed of one day working in law enforcement. This was a source of conflict between her and Jim, as she didn't even meet the height requirements and he felt she needed a less dangerous life. She attempted to enroll in the FBI as a field agent, but they dismissed her, mostly for her physical build.</p>
<p>Angry at her father, Barbara crashed the Gotham City Police Department's annual Ball dressed in feminine version of Batman's costume. However, Killer Moth, a costumed criminal, attempted to rob the event, and Barbara now found herself taking on the "Batgirl" persona she was dressed as to defeat him. This proved to be the start of a successful crime-fighting career for her. Batman and Robin soon took active role in training Barbara once she became Batgirl. Much of this training was covered in the nine-issue mini-series <i>Batgirl: Year One</i>, which updated her origin. Although Barbara's time as a Congresswoman has not been mentioned often, it was included in her post-Crisis on Infinite Earths origin story in <i>Secret Origins</i> #20 (1987), and again in <i><a href="../../../h/a/w/Hawk_and_Dove_d17a.html" title="Hawk and Dove">Hawk and Dove</a></i> #22-24 (1991). Since then, it has rarely, if ever, been mentioned.<a href="http://www.dcuguide.com/chronology.php?name=oracle2" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.dcuguide.com/chronology.php?name=oracle2" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>
<p>Post-Crisis Supergirl did not arrive on Earth until Barbara has already established herself as Oracle. Many of her earlier adventures (including some shared with Batgirl) were retroactively participated in by <a href="../../../p/o/w/Power_Girl_3499.html" title="Power Girl">Power Girl</a> instead. In addition, Barbara and Dick Grayson had been lovers at some time in the past, and she had once been engaged to Jason Bard, who is no longer a Vietnam veteran but is still a private investigator (and former Gotham City policeman).</p>

<p>In <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/Batman%7E_The_Killing_Joke_3db1.html" title="Batman: The Killing Joke">Batman: The Killing Joke</a></i>, a graphic novel by <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alan_Moore_f74a.html" title="Alan Moore">Alan Moore</a> and <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brian_Bolland_1d96.html" title="Brian Bolland">Brian Bolland</a>, the <a href="../../../j/o/k/Joker_%28comics%29.html" title="Joker (comics)">Joker</a>, as part of his plan to drive James Gordon into madness, shoots Barbara through the <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spine.html" title="Spine">spine</a>, <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paralysis.html" title="Paralysis">paralyzing</a> her and ending her career as Batgirl forever.</p>
<p>Initially, Barbara's paralysis plunges her into a period of <a href="../../../c/l/i/Clinical_depression.html" title="Clinical depression">depression</a>. Eventually, she realizes that, in a world increasingly centered on technology and information, she had a tremendous repository of skills which could be potentially useful to fight crime. These qualities include a <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genius.html" title="Genius">genius</a>-level intellect, a <a href="../../../p/h/o/Photographic_memory.html" title="Photographic memory">photographic memory</a>, a vast knowledge of computers and electronics, expert skills as a <a href="../../../h/a/c/Hacker.html" title="Hacker">hacker</a>, and her training as a librarian.</p>
<p>After having a dream where Barbara (in her previous Batgirl persona) sees an all-knowing woman (similar to <a href="../../../o/r/a/Oracle_at_Delphi_b6fc.html" title="Oracle at Delphi">Oracle at Delphi</a> of <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greek_mythology.html" title="Greek mythology">Greek mythology</a>), she adopts <b>Oracle</b> as her new codename. She now acts as an information broker, gathering and disseminating intelligence to <a href="../../../l/a/w/Law_enforcement.html" title="Law enforcement">law enforcement</a> organizations and members of the superhero community. She has also trained under the tutelege of <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Dragon_f557.html" title="Richard Dragon">Richard Dragon</a>, one of the world's premier <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martial_arts.html" title="Martial arts">martial artists</a>, who has trained some superheroes, to engage in combat (usually <a href="../../../e/s/c/Escrima.html" title="Escrima">escrima</a>) from her wheelchair should the need arise.</p>
<p>Barbara first uses the Oracle identity to assist her father on an extremely difficult murder investigation, and later takes it to the <a href="../../../s/u/i/Suicide_Squad_1727.html" title="Suicide Squad">Suicide Squad</a>. For a time, she relocates to <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belle_Reve_be60.html" title="Belle Reve">Belle Reve</a> prison in <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louisiana.html" title="Louisiana">Louisiana</a> to work with the team under the alias of "Amy Beddoes". After leaving the Suicide Squad, she returned to Gotham City and begins aiding Batman and his protegés frequently, as well as many other heroes. Just after her debut as Oracle in the pages of the Suicide Squad, Barbara appeared in the 12-issue mini-series <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Hacker_Files_a786.html" title="The Hacker Files">The Hacker Files</a></i>. This was her second appearance as a hacker in the DC Comics <a href="../../../f/i/c/Fictional_universe.html" title="Fictional universe">universe</a>.</p>
<p>Later she joined the <a href="../../../j/u/s/Justice_League_of_America_526b.html" title="Justice League of America">Justice League of America</a>, and was an active member for some time, serving as the team's primary information and communications resource.

Therefore, two different Barbara Gordons are members of the Justice League: one as Oracle, the other as Batgirl.</p>

<p>Barbara founds the <a href="../../../b/i/r/Birds_of_Prey_%28comics%29_dc53.html" title="Birds of Prey (comics)">Birds of Prey</a>, a team of female heroes, whom she employs as agents.

When an early case goes wrong and several deaths resulted from it, Power Girl quits working with Oracle on a regular basis.

<p>Barbara regroups and joins forces with superheroine <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_Canary_8568.html" title="Black Canary">Black Canary</a>. The two, who shared a similar background – both having lost their original abilities while fighting crime, yet managing to overcome – would later meet and become best friends (Birds of Prey #29), and form the nucleus of the Birds of Prey.</p>

<p>During the "<a href="../../../n/o/_/No_Man%27s_Land_%28comics%29_ddf2.html" title="No Man's Land (comics)">No Man's Land</a>" storyline, Barbara keeps a record of what is happening in Gotham City by employing various teenagers to be her eyes and ears on the street. One of these teenaged agents is <a href="../../../c/a/s/Cassandra_Cain_deb0.html" title="Cassandra Cain">Cassandra Cain</a>, who later saves Jim Gordon's life. Realizing that Cassandra is one of the world's top martial artists, and knowing that Batman needs as many allies as possible during this time, Barbara gives her blessing for Cassandra to become the new Batgirl.

She cuts ties with Batman, and after a temporary world trip with her team, moves to <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metropolis_%28comics%29.html" title="Metropolis (comics)">Metropolis</a>.</p>
<p>Barbara becomes infected with a virus from <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brainiac_%28comics%29.html" title="Brainiac (comics)">Brainiac</a> and discovers that she has <a href="../../../c/y/b/Cyberpathy.html" title="Cyberpathy">cyberpathic</a> powers and can psychically interact with computer systems.

Even <a href="../../../b/a/t/Batman.html" title="Batman">Batman</a>, who himself has a wide knowledge base and access to vast information resources, routinely consults Oracle for assistance.</p>
<p>Barabra was infected with a sentient computer virus, and gained the ability to mentally interact with computers. However, she lost this power when the virus was surgically removed.</p>

<p>In <i>Batgirl and Robin: Thrillkiller</i>, Barbara Gordon is a rebellious young woman in the early 1960s who becomes a thrillseeking vigilante with her boyfriend, a circus acrobat named Richard Greystark, who used the alias Dick Grayson. A sequel, <i>Thrillkiller '62</i>, teamed her with Bruce Wayne as Batman.</p>

Other heroes fear and respect Batgirl, but eventually she and Supergirl become crimefighting partners and friends. In this story, Bruce Wayne's playboy behavior is not an act, as his parents are very much alive and have taken Babs in.

The episode would have her getting injured during a case as Batgirl. Since Batman forbids her from participating, she would recreate herself as Oracle, and get in touch with Black Canary and Huntress to finish her case. Neither of them would meet her in person.

Barbara Gordon as the Batgirl from <i>The Batman</i> series.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>In <i>Batman Beyond</i>, Barbara (voiced by <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stockard_Channing_ef88.html" title="Stockard Channing">Stockard Channing</a>, then later by <a href="../../../a/n/g/Angie_Harmon_a460.html" title="Angie Harmon">Angie Harmon</a>) had shared a romance with Bruce Wayne. After the relationship (which was implied to have ended badly) dissolved, she retired as Batgirl and went on to join the <a href="../../../g/o/t/Gotham_City_Police_Department_c62a.html" title="Gotham City Police Department">Gotham City Police Department</a>, eventually becoming Commissioner, the position once held by her father. Barbara is also shown to be married to the <a href="../../../d/i/s/District_Attorney_151f.html" title="District Attorney">District Attorney</a>, Samuel Young. (She retained her last name). She at first resents Bruce's training of <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terry_McGinnis_2b01.html" title="Terry McGinnis">Terry McGinnis</a> as a new Batman, but eventually grows to accept his presence after they work together to stop an assassin sent to kill her husband. Barbara also expresses pity for how lonely Bruce has become in his old age. It is unclear whether Barbara took on the role of the Oracle in the <i>Batman Beyond</i> continuity, as she was shot during her tenure as Batgirl, but there was no mention made of Oracle or any paralysis. Tara Strong provided the voice of Barbara Gordon again in <i><a href="../../../r/e/t/Batman_Beyond%7E_Return_of_the_Joker_e85a.html" title="Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker">Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker</a></i>.</p>
<p>Oracle was adapted as one of the main characters in <a href="../../../w/b/_/WB_Television_Network_db4b.html" title="WB Television Network">the WB</a> <a href="../../../t/e/l/Television_series.html" title="Television series">television series</a>, <i><a href="../../../b/i/r/Birds_of_Prey_%28television_series%29_f605.html" title="Birds of Prey (television series)">Birds of Prey</a></i>, in which she was played by <a href="../../../d/i/n/Dina_Meyer_2fe9.html" title="Dina Meyer">Dina Meyer</a>. The series was loosely based on the comic book of that name. Meyer also suited up as Batgirl in both flashback scenes and modern-day scenes where technology would allow her to walk.</p>
<p>In 2005, the Barbara Gordon Batgirl began making guest appearances on episodes of the <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Batman_%28TV_series%29_9fb6.html" title="The Batman (TV series)">The Batman</a></i> animated series. <a href="../../../d/a/n/Danielle_Judovits_9cb6.html" title="Danielle Judovits">Danielle Judovits</a> provides her voice. Although she appears before <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robin_%28comics%29.html" title="Robin (comics)">Robin</a> in this series, he still becomes Batman's "official partner," which she resented at first. An older version of Barbara, in the guise of Oracle, voiced by <a href="../../../k/e/l/Kellie_Martin_77ce.html" title="Kellie Martin">Kellie Martin</a>, also appeared in the Season Four episode <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_The_Batman_episodes_e412.html#Artifacts" title="List of The Batman episodes">"Artifacts"</a>. Her appearance, set <a href="../../../2/0/2/2027.html" title="2027">2027</a>, shows her using a wheelchair and operating as control center for Batman. She mockingly claims to have trouble remembering that Dick Grayson changed his codename from "Robin" to "<a href="../../../n/i/g/Nightwing.html" title="Nightwing">Nightwing</a>".</p>
<p>On <i><a href="../../../b/a/t/Batman_Begins_16f4.html" title="Batman Begins">Batman Begins</a></i>, at Detective James Gordon's apartment. Through the window, the detective's pregnant wife was nursing their two-year old child. According to the Dennis O'Neil's novelization, the infant was a young Barbara Gordon. The detective's wife's was also name Barbara, whom the child was named after. <sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> <sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup> Her maiden name was Kean. <sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>Oracle also appeared in the video game <i><a href="../../../d/a/r/Batman%7E_Dark_Tomorrow_ab29.html" title="Batman: Dark Tomorrow">Batman: Dark Tomorrow</a></i>.</p>
