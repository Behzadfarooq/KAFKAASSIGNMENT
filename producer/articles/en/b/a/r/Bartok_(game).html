<p>The game of <b>Bartok</b>, also known by a number of other names, such as <b>Wartoke</b>, <b>Warthog</b>, <b>Bartog</b> (in <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australia</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/t/Mathematical_olympiad.html" title="Mathematical olympiad">Mathematical olympiad</a> circles), <b>Bentok</b>, <b>Last One Standing</b> or <b>Bong 98</b>, is a <a href="../../../c/a/r/Card_game.html" title="Card game">card game</a> that is often also a <a href="../../../d/r/i/Drinking_game.html" title="Drinking game">drinking game</a>. It belongs to the "shedding" or <a href="../../../c/r/a/Crazy_Eights_2bd8.html" title="Crazy Eights">Crazy Eights</a> family of card games, whereby each player tries to rid himself of all of his cards. The game progresses through a series of rounds with a new rule being added in each round, thus making the game increasingly complex as it progresses. These newly introduced rules may modify any existing rules. It is against the spirit of Bartok to divulge any information about the rules to new players, including when and how they may play. A penalty of one card is typically awarded for any incorrect action.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/r/Bartok_%28game%29.html" title="Edit section: History">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
<p>The history of Bartok is not very well known. It is claimed in Australian Mathematical Olympiad circles that the game originated there, although no inventor(s) can be definitively identified. Others claim that the game came from the UK, gradually spreading outwards. Yet others claim that the game originated as a variant of <a href="../../../m/a/o/Mao_%28game%29.html" title="Mao (game)">Mao</a>, which gained popularity in <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Cambridge_5f20.html" title="University of Cambridge">Universities of Cambridge</a> and <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Oxford_2ca4.html" title="University of Oxford">Oxford</a> around <a href="../../../1/9/7/1975.html" title="1975">1975</a>. Even if this last hypothesis is true, it is not known when the game of Bartok as we know it evolved.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/r/Bartok_%28game%29.html" title="Edit section: Bartok and Mao">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Bartok and Mao</span></h2>
<p>Like combination shedding and guessing games such as Mao, the rules can become quite complex. The similarity between Mao and Bartok is such that Mao is called Bartok, or Bartok is called Mao, in many places. The principal difference is that in Mao a substantial set of rules is maintained between games, whereas in Bartok this is only true of the minimal initial set of rules. Further, in those variants of Mao where rules are added between rounds, these rules are usually added silently, whereas in Bartok the new rules are told to all players. This allows the rules of Bartok to be substantially more technical than the rules of Mao since the rules are known to everyone. In both Bartok and Mao, if a new player joins an existing game he is not told the current rules.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/r/Bartok_%28game%29.html" title="Edit section: Divulging the rules">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Divulging the rules</span></h2>
<p>Many Bartok players feel that that the enjoyment of players everywhere is enhanced by the fact that the rules are not known in advance to new players. It provides a challenge to new players and great pleasure (at the new players' expense) to the experienced. For this reason, it is considered the height of bad etiquette to tell a new player the rules or to tell a person arriving late for a game the rules that have been introduced since the start. Nevertheless, for pragmatic purposes, a description of the rules may be used by an individual who is unfamiliar with Bartok to start a game when no experienced players are available. Some people feel that while a description of the rules is inappropriate, describing an example game would be a reasonable compromise.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/r/Bartok_%28game%29.html" title="Edit section: Playing the game">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Playing the game</span></h2>
<p>The many variations of local rules for Bartok, as with any non-standardised game, make it difficult to give a general account of the rules. A game of Bartok is often played with a standard deck of 52 playing cards and two jokers. However, this is not strictly enforced in some places and it is quite presentable to use multiple decks, incomplete decks or decks without jokers. This does not affect the flow of play terribly, since the rules are not fixed anyway. The game of Bartok consists of several rounds of play after which a rule is created by the winner of that round.</p>
<p><a name="Play_of_a_round" id="Play_of_a_round"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/r/Bartok_%28game%29.html" title="Edit section: Play of a round">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Play of a round</span></h3>
<p>The players sit in a circle and the cards are placed face down in the centre and mixed. Each player then picks up either five or seven cards, by agreement. A single card is then flipped to face up to start the discard pile. The rest of the face down cards form the draw pile. Any player may then play on that card, providing such a play is legal. One of the players to the left or right of that person then plays, to determine the direction of play. It is also possible use a dealer, who deals the cards to each player in the usual manner. In this case play follows to the left of the dealer, as usual.</p>
<p>Initially a legal play is the same as in <a href="../../../u/n/o/Uno_%28game%29.html" title="Uno (game)">Uno</a>, one may discard a card face up on the discard pile which has either the same suit or face value of the top card of the discard pile. At that point play moves on to the next player. Plays must be made in a timely manner or face a penalty. In rounds after the first the notion of a legal play may change with the introduction of new rules. Providing there are no new rules that obtain, the Uno system of play is used. If a player cannot, or does not wish to, make a legal play, he may pick up from the draw pile; this also ends his turn. In some games it is acceptable, if a player has just drawn a card to end his turn which <i>could have</i> legally been played, he may jump in with that card before the next player has played.</p>
<p>A round ends when any player has no cards left. That player is declared the winner of the round and is permitted to create a new rule for the next round. Note that if a player has only one card left he must say "Bartok" (or "Bartog" etc. if playing the game by a different name) or receive a penalty. This applies even if he gets down to one card by non-standard means, such as trading hands with someone else. If the draw pile runs out before a round ends, simply flip over all but the top card of the discard pile to form the new draw pile.</p>
<p><a name="Penalties" id="Penalties"></a></p>
<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/r/Bartok_%28game%29.html" title="Edit section: Penalties">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Penalties</span></h4>
<p>A penalty of one card is awarded for a number of illegal actions in Bartok. Anyone may award penalties in Bartok, although only one penalty may be awarded to a player for any given action, so if two people simultaneously accuse player X of the same action, only one of the penalties holds. Penalties do not end a player's turn. For example, if awarded a <i>Too Slow</i> penalty the player must still either play or pick up. Below is a complete list of penalties. In italics is the appropriate accusation that should accompany each one.</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Question</i>: For a player who has asked a question or started to ask a question. It does not matter if the question is relevant to the game or not.</li>
<li><i>Incorrect Play</i>: For a player who has just played illegally during his turn.</li>
<li><i>Out of Turn</i>: For a player who has played when it is not his turn.</li>
<li><i>Too Slow</i>: For a player who has not played in a timely manner. These can be issued multiple times during one turn if the player is extrordinarily slow. As a rough guide, leave about 3 seconds between each <i>Too Slow</i> issued.</li>
<li><i>Failure to say "Bartok"</i>: For a player who has only one card left but has not said "Bartok". In many circles these are issued very quickly after the player reaches one card, since he should say "Bartok" directly after playing his last card. If a player wins the round without saying "Bartok" and without being caught, he still successfully wins the round. The penalty is not awarded retroactively.</li>
<li><i>False Accusation</i>: For a player who accuses another player of a penalty incorrectly.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is no penalty awarded for drawing a card when it is not your turn, since you only disadvantage yourself by taking another card.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/r/Bartok_%28game%29.html" title="Edit section: Creating new rules">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Creating new rules</span></h3>
<p>New rules are introduced to Bartok by the winner of each round, the idea being that as the rules become more and more involved, the game becomes increasingly frantic. The creator must tell the other players what this rule is. Any rule can be introduced providing it is not player specific, for example <i>Skip Bill every turn,</i> and does not remove or alter a rule introduced in a previous round, unless that is the wish of every player. Additionally, if there is a unanimous veto, that is, <i>every</i> player bar the creator vetoes a new rule, then the rule is not used and the creator thinks of another. Commonly there is a time out rule, whereby if players need clarification during a round of a newly introduced rule they may call time out and discuss it.</p>
<p>Almost all rules are of the form <i>if (trigger) then (consequence)</i>, for example <i>If a 7 is played, reverse the direction of play.</i> Common triggers and consequences are listed below. Many rules can be made cumulative as well, for example <i>If a 7 is played, the next player picks up two cards and forfeits his turn or plays another 7, if he plays another 7, the player after him picks up 4 cards and forfeits his turn or plays another 7, etc.</i> Generally it is desirable to have the more confusing or tricky rules on a rarer trigger so that the players are not overly taxed by any one rule. The very best rules are creative but playable and fun. The list below is certainly not intended to be comprehensive.</p>

<p>The game usually finishes when everyone gets bored or the rules get too complicated to be maintained. This often occurs after about 12 rounds, depending on the complexity of the rules. Providing that this does not happen, the game can continue indefinitely.</p>

<p>There are two common ways to make Bartok a drinking game. Either replace or augment the one card penalties by making the offending player have to drink. Alternatively, create rules that encourage drinking, for example <i>If a 7 is played, the next player drinks.</i> Of course, both of these systems may be used simultaneously.</p>

<p>There are a few variants of Bartok. These are generally not well known and not commonly played but are very much in the spirit of the game.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/r/Bartok_%28game%29.html" title="Edit section: Combat Bartok">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Combat Bartok</span></h3>
<p><b>Combat Bartok</b> starts as several Bartok games running concurrently. Rules are gradually introduced, in normal Bartok fashion, that allow games to interact. For example, a rule may be introduced that <i>Upon playing a one-eyed Jack, switch places and hands with the person in the other game with the most cards.</i> The rules for each game still apply only to that game, even though the consequences of a rule being triggered may affect the other game.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/r/Bartok_%28game%29.html" title="Edit section: Reverse Bartok">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Reverse Bartok</span></h3>
<p><b>Reverse Bartok</b> involves beginning with a predefined set of rules and the winner of each round removes a rule from the game. Many experienced players are tripped up by this variant, as they are not accustomed to learning not to use previous rules.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/r/Bartok_%28game%29.html" title="Edit section: Set Bartok">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Set Bartok</span></h3>
<p><b>Set Bartok</b> uses the usual rules of Bartok but with one or more standard <a href="../../../s/e/t/SET_%28game%29_f68b.html" title="SET (game)">Set</a> decks, instead of normal playing cards. This allows rule triggers to be far more complicated than in a standard game of Bartok, since the triggers can intersect in very twisted ways. For example, there can be rule triggers on <i>red diamonds</i>, on <i>single diamonds</i> and on <i>shaded singles</i>. Then any <i>one shaded diamond</i> will trigger two rules and the <i>one shaded single diamond</i> will trigger all three rules.</p>
