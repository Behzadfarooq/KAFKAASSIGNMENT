<p>Bernard M. Baruch College (CUNY) is part of a tradition that dates back more than 150 years to the founding, in 1847, of the Free Academy, the very first free public institution of higher education in the nation. (Baruch’s landmark building at 23rd Street and Lexington Avenue occupies the site of the Free Academy). Established in 1919 as City College’s School of Business and Civic Administration, the school was renamed in 1953 in honor of <a href="../../../b/e/r/Bernard_Baruch_e5e6.html" title="Bernard Baruch">Bernard M. Baruch</a>—statesman, financier, and devoted alumnus. In 1968 the school became an independent senior college in The City University of New York (CUNY) system.</p>
<p>Today, a thriving, urban, multicultural institution and a senior college of CUNY, Baruch attracts motivated students of proven achievement who are seriously committed to making their dreams a reality. Their ability and drive, along with the superb, professional education for which Baruch is known, have established the College’s national and international reputation for excellence. In providing opportunity for these students, the College sustains the original mission of the Free Academy and the City University, adapting that mission to the needs of New York City, once a commercial hub, now a global corporate and financial powerhouse.</p>
<p>Baruch offers undergraduate and graduate programs of study through its three schools: the <a href="../../../z/i/c/Zicklin_School_of_Business_2982.html" title="Zicklin School of Business">Zicklin School of Business</a>, the largest and one of the most respected business schools in the nation; the <a href="../../../w/e/i/Weissman_School_of_Arts_and_Sciences_520a.html" title="Weissman School of Arts and Sciences">Mildred and George Weissman School of Arts and Sciences</a>; and the School of Public Affairs. The College also offers nondegree and certificate programs through its Division of Continuing and Professional Studies.</p>
<p>Baruch College is in the heart of one of the world’s most dynamic financial and cultural centers. The College is within easy reach of Wall Street, Midtown, and the global headquarters of major companies, firms, and organizations. This “real-world classroom” adds immeasurably to the value of a Baruch education and offers unparalleled internship, career, and networking opportunities. Some of the nation’s top executives are Baruch alumni, and many of them regularly come to campus to share their expertise with current students.</p>
<p>Baruch’s innovative, 17-floor <a href="http://newman.baruch.cuny.edu/DIGITAL/2001/history/exhibit/Update/vc/vc_3.htm" class="external text" title="http://newman.baruch.cuny.edu/DIGITAL/2001/history/exhibit/Update/vc/vc_3.htm" rel="nofollow">William and Anita Newman Vertical Campus</a> was honored in 2003 by the American Institute of Architects with the highest award it offers to an individual building.</p>

Previous winners of the award were Oberlin, Wellesley, and Earlham Colleges.</p>
<p>Baruch’s Student Academic Consulting Center received the National College Learning Center Association’s 2003 Frank L. Christ Award for outstanding learning center among four-year colleges.</p>
<p>Baruch faculty are among the most distinguished and most widely known in their fields. They combine outstanding academic credentials with significant real-world experience. Approximately 500 teach full time, with about 95 percent holding a PhD or other terminal degree. Full-time faculty teach both entry-level and advanced courses and serve as advisors to student organizations and preprofessional programs. Adjunct faculty are typically drawn from New York City’s business and professional ranks. Baruch employs another 700 administrative and support personnel. Faculty members are regularly recognized with fellowships, grants, and awards from many notable foundations and public agencies.</p>

Newman Vertical Campus</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Designed to recreate the atmosphere of a traditional college campus in an urban setting, Baruch’s innovative, 17-floor <a href="http://newman.baruch.cuny.edu/DIGITAL/2001/history/exhibit/Update/vc/vc_3.htm" class="external text" title="http://newman.baruch.cuny.edu/DIGITAL/2001/history/exhibit/Update/vc/vc_3.htm" rel="nofollow">Newman Vertical Campus</a> serves as the hub of the College. The $319 million dollar complex opened its doors in 2001. Covering nearly an entire square block between Lexington and Third Avenues and 24th and 25th Streets, the 800,000-square-foot structure houses more than 100 high-technology classrooms and research facilities; faculty and administrative offices; executive conference facilities; a three-level Athletics and Recreation Complex; an expanded student activities center; the Marvin Antonowsky Performing Arts Complex, which comprises the Rose Nagelberg Theatre and Engelman Recital Hall; a 500-seat auditorium; a television studio; a food court; and a new campus bookstore. The Newman Vertical Campus has been honored by the American Institute of Architects with the highest award it offers to an individual building.</p>
<p>The 1,450-seat, 330,000-square-foot <a href="http://newman.baruch.cuny.edu/" class="external text" title="http://newman.baruch.cuny.edu/" rel="nofollow">William and Anita Newman Library</a>, housed in the Information and Technology Building, directly opposite the new Newman Vertical Campus, provides the Baruch community with access to several hundred online databases and information resources in print and electronic formats. Users have access seven days a week to the library’s on-site computing facilities, as well as remote access from off-campus locations to thousands of full-text journals, newspapers, and books. A Web-based reference service, in which librarians answer questions via a “text chat,” is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. In 2003, the library won the prestigious Excellence in Academic Libraries Award for best college library in the nation from the Association of College and Research Libraries. The Baruch Computing and Technology Center, also located in the Information and Technology Building, is the largest student computing center in New York City. It provides computer access to 250 students at a time.</p>

<p>Beginning with Bernard M. Baruch’s gift of $9 million in 1965, the College has flourished through the generosity of its many friends. In addition to strong support from the Weissman and Zicklin families, gifts from a score of other alumni have allowed Baruch to create and enhance such programs and facilities as the Bert W. and Sandra Wasserman Trading Floor / Subotnick Financial Services Center, the Stan Ross Department of Accountancy, the William Newman Programs in Real Estate, the Bernard L. Schwartz Communciation Institute, and the Lawrence N. Field Center for Entrepreneurship.
