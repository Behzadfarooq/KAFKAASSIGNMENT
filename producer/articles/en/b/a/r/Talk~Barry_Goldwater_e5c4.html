<p>Hector, the ad was aired as part of Johnson's campaign, according to every source I have encountered. You may be thinking of the famous "Daisy Girl II" aired against Al Gore in 2000<a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2000/10/27/politics/main244829.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2000/10/27/politics/main244829.shtml" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, which was created and run by Arelino Industries in Texas, which CBS calls a "mysterious group". These kinds of "non official" ads were largely unknown in the 1960s. From my understqanding, they arose in large part because of limitations of campaign finance that were not enacted until after <a href="../../../w/a/t/Watergate.html" title="Watergate">Watergate</a>. -- <a href="../../../d/e/c/User%7EDecumanus_9e44.html" title="User:Decumanus">Decumanus</a> <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/unbound/polipro/pp2001-08-08.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.theatlantic.com/unbound/polipro/pp2001-08-08.htm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></p>

<p>Is it true that Barry Goldwater seeked the help of a psychiatrist, therapist, or in some similar area before he ran for President in 1964. This was taboo at that time and it seems that I recall it affected his ability to win. Please verify.....</p>

<p>Cut this sentence:</p>
<dl>
<dd>An original thinker, fearlessly outspoken, <i>he built the political machine that was inherited by <a href="../../../r/o/n/Ronald_Reagan_9da1.html" title="Ronald Reagan">Ronald Reagan</a>.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>I disagree with the italicized text. After the 1964 election the national Republican party was in a shambles - the Democrats had their largest House and Senate majorities since the Depression, if not since the Civil War. Goldwater certainly didn't "build a political machine" in the sense in which that is ordinarily understood i.e. by winning elections.</p>
<p>The party was brought back to life by the Nixon victory in '68, in which Goldwater had no part - although he did get back into the Senate, winning an open seat.</p>
<p>I tend to concur with Theo Lippman that Reagan was elected president in 1980 primarily because he'd been running for 16 years and the political climate was finally right for him. <a href="../../../e/l/l/User%7EEllsworth_11a3.html" title="User:Ellsworth">Ellsworth</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>The phrase "political machine" may be a poorly chosen one, but the basic point about the continuity between Goldwater and Reagan should be made. The Goldwater campaign not only gave birth to Reagan's political career, it was a watershed moment for the Republican Party, and more specifically, the conservative movement which came to control it. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadicalsubversiv_69e3.html" title="User:Radicalsubversiv"><b>R</b>adical<b>S</b>ubversiv</a> <a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadicalsubversiv_1bf7.html" title="User talk:Radicalsubversiv"><b>E</b></a> 00:34, 25 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I agree, but I believe that the sentence as originally written (and perhaps the article as a whole?) gives Goldwater a bit too much credit.<br />
<br />
To take just two of the planks of Goldwater's campaign platform: 1. he opposed the <a href="../../../c/i/v/Civil_Rights_Act_of_1964_483d.html" title="Civil Rights Act of 1964">Civil Rights Act of 1964</a> and other civil rights laws directed at private (as opposed to governmental) economic discrimination against minorities and 2. he favored complete privatization of Social Security.<br />
<br />
These ideas were not endorsed by any serious Republican presidential candidate since, and it is questionable whether these positions commanded a majority the national Republican party as a whole - Republicans in Congress favored the CRA of '64 by a large margin, and in fact the Act never would have passed the Senate filibuster if the GOP senators hadn't supported it. <a href="../../../e/l/l/User%7EEllsworth_11a3.html" title="User:Ellsworth">Ellsworth</a> 14:08, 25 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>This is getting off-topic, but I think you've phrased those examples far too narrowly. Beginning in 1968, the Republican Party absolutely did put itself squarely in opposition to the civil rights agenda. And social security privatization has become a major cornerstone of Republican domestic policy -- it's just that no presidential candidate has been political suicidal enough to propose doing so all at once. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadicalsubversiv_69e3.html" title="User:Radicalsubversiv"><b>R</b>adical<b>S</b>ubversiv</a> <a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadicalsubversiv_1bf7.html" title="User talk:Radicalsubversiv"><b>E</b></a> 19:50, 25 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The "civil rights agenda" shifted over time, so I agree that ultimately the Republican Party found itself at odds with the leaders of the civil rights movement on issues such as forced busing etc. - but many Democrats came into conflict with that agenda as well.<br />
<br />
As far as the 1968 date - Nixon proposed the "Philadelphia plan" to use "quotas, goals and timetables" to improve minority participation in government employment and contracting in 1969. So I don't see how 1968 can be regarded as the demarcation line.<br />
<br />
And didn't Bill Clinton acknowledge that Social Security is going to need some kind of overhaul in order to keep it from breaking tha bank, and appoint some kind of commission to make recommendations in that regard?
<dl>
<dd>Actually, self, that was Bush, although Clinton set up a commission on the broader issue of "entitlement reform", which went the way of others of its kind... <a href="../../../e/l/l/User%7EEllsworth_11a3.html" title="User:Ellsworth">Ellsworth</a> 17:12, 20 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
<dd>But, getting back to what's in the article, I think with that sentence removed it's pretty close to being spot-on. <a href="../../../e/l/l/User%7EEllsworth_11a3.html" title="User:Ellsworth">Ellsworth</a> 18:50, 26 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In American politics -- and particularly when discussing the 50s and 60s -- referring to someone as a former Communist, especially without any context, is incendiary. You might as well be telling the reader "what follows is extremist dogma which you should ignore." The only thing that's even potentially relevant as background for the comment is that he is a leftist and hence unfriendly to Goldwater. Anyone interested in Hofstadter's views on capitalism-writ-large, which are immaterial to the quotation given, can consult the article about him. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadicalsubversiv_69e3.html" title="User:Radicalsubversiv"><b>R</b>adical<b>S</b>ubversiv</a> <a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadicalsubversiv_1bf7.html" title="User talk:Radicalsubversiv"><b>E</b></a> 22:02, 28 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>The passage in contention:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>At the time, Goldwater seemed to many to be far out of step with the then-prevailing <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberalism_in_the_United_States_215a.html" title="Liberalism in the United States">Cold-War liberal consensus</a> in U.S. politics. Leftist Historian <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Hofstadter_2e7a.html" title="Richard Hofstadter">Richard Hofstadter</a> remarked at the time, "When, in all our history, has anyone with ideas so bizarre, so archaic, so self-confounding, so remote from the basic American consensus, ever got so far?" <a href="http://scoop.agonist.org/story/2004/9/5/13652/16915" class="external autonumber" title="http://scoop.agonist.org/story/2004/9/5/13652/16915" rel="nofollow">[4]</a></dd>

<dd>Why not just drop the quotation the context can't be agreed upon? I hardly consider Hofstadter as being the last word on Goldwater anyway. Or Lewis Lapham, for that matter - the Lapham article that's cited there is just an anti-conservative screed with a few statistical charts thrown in. Lapham goes so far as to refer to the <a href="../../../m/o/n/Mongols.html" title="Mongols">Mongols</a> besieging <a href="../../../v/i/e/Vienna.html" title="Vienna">Vienna</a>, which they never did. <a href="../../../e/l/l/User%7EEllsworth_11a3.html" title="User:Ellsworth">Ellsworth</a> 22:28, 28 Sep 2004 (UTC)

<p>Well, I have no problem with dropping the Hofstader quote (which I introduced), but there should be some remark on the prevailing liberal consensus of the time. Even within the Republican Party, the Goldwater candidacy was seen as an insurgency; this was a party whose leading figures at the time included liberals Nelson Rockefeller and William Scranton and where John Lindsay was a rising star; Richard Nixon, who was on the party's ticket in every other presidential election from 1952 to 1972 - that's 5 out of 6 elections - was more or less within the liberal consensus, although certainly at the "right" edge of that consensus politics, nowhere near Goldwater in any event. -- <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> 23:08, Sep 28, 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>You're right, the quote isn't worth battling over. We do however, as Jmabel says, need to explain that Goldwater was way outside the consensus. I've added a new paragraph in the opening trying to get at that, and inserted a quote from a recent Goldwater biography that tries to get at this issue, as well as the subsequent drastic shift in that consensus. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadicalsubversiv_69e3.html" title="User:Radicalsubversiv"><b>R</b>adical<b>S</b>ubversiv</a> <a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadicalsubversiv_1bf7.html" title="User talk:Radicalsubversiv"><b>E</b></a> 23:44, 28 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>I like the way you did it, I think it gives a broader perspective to the article. <a href="../../../e/l/l/User%7EEllsworth_11a3.html" title="User:Ellsworth">Ellsworth</a> 23:56, 28 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Ummm, but I have to say, Perlstein is no more an impartial observer than Lapham or Hofstadter. Did you read his post-mortem Reagan-bashing in Salon.com? Can we maybe balance Perlstein's rather idiosyncratic analogy with something from someone more kindly disposed to Golwaters philosophy? <a href="../../../e/l/l/User%7EEllsworth_11a3.html" title="User:Ellsworth">Ellsworth</a> 16:40, 4 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>How is Perlstein's analogy in any way derisive of Goldwater? It's merely an attempt to describe the magnitude of the political shift that is largely a result of his political legacy. Yes, Perlstein is a lefty. But he's also a trained historian (I think at the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Chicago_7f0f.html" title="University of Chicago">University of Chicago</a>) who's probably written the most comprehensive account of Goldwater's '64 campaign, which has won a fair amount of praise even from conservatives. Moreover, what do his writings on Reagan have to do with anything? <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadicalsubversiv_69e3.html" title="User:Radicalsubversiv"><b>R</b>adical<b>S</b>ubversiv</a> <a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadicalsubversiv_1bf7.html" title="User talk:Radicalsubversiv"><b>E</b></a> 19:38, 4 Dec 2004 (UTC)<br />
<dl>
<dd>I'm saying, Perlstein besides writing books, has had a fair career as a liberal polemicist. Nothing wrong with that, but it renders his analysis suspect.<a href="../../../e/l/l/User%7EEllsworth_11a3.html" title="User:Ellsworth">Ellsworth</a>
<dl>
<dd>No, I don't think it does. The work in question is a scholarly and well-respected one, and thus an appropriate source for a quote. Other works by the writer are immaterial. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadicalsubversiv_69e3.html" title="User:Radicalsubversiv"><b>R</b>adical<b>S</b>ubversiv</a> <a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadicalsubversiv_1bf7.html" title="User talk:Radicalsubversiv"><b>E</b></a> 20:54, 4 Dec 2004 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Other works I find valuable for two reasons: 1. It gives you an insight into the writer's POV 2. It tells you whether the person is inclined to play fast and loose with the facts. For an example of Perlstein's bloviations on Reagan, Goldwater and conservatives, I give you <a href="http://archive.salon.com/opinion/feature/2004/06/07/reagan/index.html" class="external text" title="http://archive.salon.com/opinion/feature/2004/06/07/reagan/index.html" rel="nofollow">this salon article</a>. Just on the last three paragraphs, Perlstein berates Reagan for not being able "make peace...with the welfare queens he fabricated" (how do you make peace with someone who you fabricated?) and for not "deign[ing] to publicly acknowledge" AIDS until 1987 - this is way off, see <a href="../../../r/o/n/Ronald_Reagan_9da1.html" title="Ronald Reagan">Ronald Reagan</a>. A good analyst will get his facts right no matter how great his antipathy for his subject. <a href="../../../e/l/l/User%7EEllsworth_11a3.html" title="User:Ellsworth">Ellsworth</a>
<dl>
<dd>That Perlstein personally has a left POV is certain. What is at issue is whether it seeps into the work, and the quote provided, in such a way that it is inappropriate for a Wikipedia article. You haven't provided any evidence that it does. As for the Reagan article, the only fact you've got him on is the AIDS matter, which is a common mistake, based on Reagan's long-standing refusal to address the epidemic in any kind of official way. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadicalsubversiv_69e3.html" title="User:Radicalsubversiv"><b>R</b>adical<b>S</b>ubversiv</a> <a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadicalsubversiv_1bf7.html" title="User talk:Radicalsubversiv"><b>E</b></a> 22:28, 4 Dec 2004 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>There's more, much more, on Perlstein's POV extending to getting the facts wrong than just what I cited. That was just a couple examples. (Should someone who fancies himself a historian be excused for making a "common mistake"?) But that's really a discussion for the article on Perlstein, which has yet to be written.<br />
I will try to parse the quote at a later time. <a href="../../../e/l/l/User%7EEllsworth_11a3.html" title="User:Ellsworth">Ellsworth</a> 22:41, 4 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>As for the quote, I think it injects a needless sexual element into the analysis, that has no analog with the issues in Goldwater's 64 campaign. <a href="../../../e/l/l/User%7EEllsworth_11a3.html" title="User:Ellsworth">Ellsworth</a> 20:46, 4 Dec 2004 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I don't think it does, but feel free to remove that phrase with an ellipsis if you think it necessary.</dd>
<dd>Also, "historian" is fine, and probably more accurate. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadicalsubversiv_69e3.html" title="User:Radicalsubversiv"><b>R</b>adical<b>S</b>ubversiv</a> <a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadicalsubversiv_1bf7.html" title="User talk:Radicalsubversiv"><b>E</b></a> 20:54, 4 Dec 2004 (UTC)

<dd>However, on religious issues there can be little or no compromise. There is no position on which people are so immovable as their religious beliefs. There is no more powerful ally one can claim in a debate than Jesus Christ, or God, or Allah, or whatever one calls this supreme being. But like any powerful weapon, the use of God's name on one's behalf should be used sparingly. The religious factions that are growing throughout our land are not using their religious clout with wisdom. They are trying to force government leaders into following their position 100 percent. If you disagree with these religious groups on a particular moral issue, they complain, they threaten you with a loss of money or votes or both. I'm frankly sick and tired of the political preachers across this country telling me as a citizen that if I want to be a moral person, I must believe in "A," "B," "C," and "D." Just who do they think they are? And from where do they presume to claim the right to dictate their moral beliefs to me? And I am even more angry as a legislator who must endure the threats of every religious group who thinks it has some God-granted right to control my vote on every roll call in the Senate. I am warning them today: I will fight them every step of the way if they try to dictate their moral convictions to all Americans in the name of "conservatism."<br /></dd>

<p>The joke about someone half-Jewish being allowed to play nine holes at the restricted golf course is an old one, told about many people. If we are going to mention it here, it should be with a citation (e.g. a particular time Goldwater told the story about himself). It's perfectly likely that he told this story about himself; it's even possible that he actually used the joke in such a situation at a real country club, but it's unlikely that he invented the joke. -- <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 04:49, Oct 27, 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>In his autobiography, "Goldwater," BG attributes this joke to his brother Bob, speaking about HIS brother Barry at "a golf pro tournament near Los Angeles." B. Goldwater adds, "The story got a big laugh, but the incident never occurred." [PaulW3]</p>

<p>Everyone keeps adding back the Tom Daschle bit that I keep erasing. The sentence as it is constructed is inaccurate and is meant to convey an inaccurate impression. Tom Daschle was not the senate Majority Leader, William H. Frist was. Daschle was the Minority Leader when he was defeated. You could possibly say he was a former Majority leader because he had at one point previously been one, however McFarland wasn't a former Majority Leader when he was defeated. John Thune's victory is not equivalent to Goldwater's and bears very little relevance to Barry Goldwater himself. If you wanted an illustrative point for Goldwater’s victory why not look to the previous time it actually happened as opposed to the current time when it didn't quite happen.

<dd>You'll find mention of this in pretty much any detailed biographical information on Goldwater; I'm pretty sure it's in Perlstein's book, and certainly others. It's important to understand (and perhaps this needs to be clarified), that Goldwater didn't run on a racist platform in the same way that Southern segregationists did. His opposition to much of the 60s civil rights legislation had to do with his political philosophy about the role of government. He had very little taste for appeals to white racism, and fastidiously avoided them until late in the campaign when he felt he had been unfairly smeared. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadicalsubversiv_69e3.html" title="User:Radicalsubversiv"><b>R</b>adical<b>S</b>ubversiv</a> <a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadicalsubversiv_1bf7.html" title="User talk:Radicalsubversiv"><b>E</b></a> 8 July 2005 23:22 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There was a Supreme Court case deciding that Native Americans/Eskimos were American citizens even though Alaska was not a state. I'll tell you its exact date later. I am not imagining the case. The point is, I doubt the section about their being a potential for constitutional crisis. It should be changed. When I have the time, I'll find the case, cite it, and edit the section myself. And that sentence about a "political consensus" existing after WWII is absurd. Look the word "consensus" up in a dictionary. Or, if we accept hyperboles, then there has been a conservative consensus in the U.S. for the last 25 years. Obviously, neither is the case. <small>—<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> 69.95.168.98 (<a href="../../../6/9/2E/User_talk%7E69.95.168.98.html" title="User talk:69.95.168.98">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_69.95.168.98_a279.html" title="Special:Contributions/69.95.168.98">contribs</a>) 27 Oct 2005.</small></p>

<dd>I imagine that you are right about citizen from birth. But the term "liberal consensus" for US politics from the end of WWII down to the late 1960s or early 1970s is in wide use among political scientists and, yes, there is a different consensus (I'd call it a "free market" consensus more than a conservative consensus) in the country roughly since the 1980 elections). "Consensus" in national politics never means unanimity, it basically means ideological hegemony. -- <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 05:17, 28 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm not going to try to exhaustively list everything that was recently removed—it's there in the history, if someone wants to look—but the following seem to me like they belong in the article.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Goldwater used to tell a joke about his brother Bob being told at a <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golf.html" title="Golf">golf</a> course, "You can't play here, this is a restricted course," to which he responded "I'm only half Jewish...is it all right if I only play nine holes?" In his <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autobiography.html" title="Autobiography">autobiography</a> he remarks, "The story got a big laugh, but the incident never occurred."</dd>
</dl>
<p>This was a joke Goldwater told repeatedly. I think it casts and interesting light on his relation to a partially Jewish identity. It is the only mention of this other than mention of his father's conversion. If this is gone, something else should be in the article related to that.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Hard to pigeonhole, he began as a reform <a href="../../../d/e/m/Democratic_Party_%28United_States%29_2333.html" title="Democratic Party (United States)">Democrat</a>, served as a friend and colleague of <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joseph_McCarthy_1e1b.html" title="Joseph McCarthy">Joseph McCarthy</a> to the bitter end (one of only 22 Senators who voted against McCarthy's censure), developed a deep friendship with President <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_F._Kennedy_9798.html" title="John F. Kennedy">John F. Kennedy</a> and a lasting dislike for <a href="../../../l/y/n/Lyndon_B._Johnson_d5db.html" title="Lyndon B. Johnson">Lyndon B. Johnson</a>, whom he said "used every dirty trick in the bag", and <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Nixon_9d26.html" title="Richard Nixon">Richard Nixon</a>, whom he later called "the most dishonest individual I have ever met in my life" (though he was a key ally of Nixon during his administration).</dd>
</dl>
<p>The article now has <i>no</i> mention that he was ever a Democrat, <i>no</i> mention of being one of the roughly 1/5 of the Senate who opposed McCarthy's censure (in general, discussion of his anti-Communism has been much reduced), <i>no</i> mention of friendship with JFK, <i>no</i> mention of his disliking Nixon, and lacks the "used every dirty trick in the bag" quote about Johnson. All of these seem to me to round out the portrait of the man. It's hard to see how dropping that enhances a portrait of the man.</p>
<p>Also, his interest in UFOs has also now been relatively downplayed, what with dropping Clark's description of him almost losing his friendship with <a href="../../../c/u/r/Curtis_LeMay_3832.html" title="Curtis LeMay">Curtis LeMay</a> over the matter. -- <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 09:00, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>In a serious article we should avoid jokes. Yes, most politicians tell jokes. His religion was Episcopal; his ethnic heritage was Jewish. Article says that; No jokes needed. Was his interest in UFO's serious? Not according to the material that was cut out. (Here's a powerful US Senator and committee chairman who could have made speeches or held Senate hearings if he thought UFOs were true, but he never did. Whoever inserted the item added three books on UFOs!) Did he support McCarthy? Yes, that should be included, because that was an important public act and tied to his anti-communism, which is important. Mention that as a youth before he got into politics he was a Democrat? That is a small point but it could go in. (The more important point is that he was a major player in moving Ariz from Dem to GOP in 1950-52.) Was he friends with many Senators, and disliked some, and made wise cracks about some? Yes, but that is trivia and does not belong. People who want gossip should read a popular biography or a supermarket tabloid (re UFO) not an encyclopedia.<a href="../../../r/j/e/User%7ERjensen_b7df.html" title="User:Rjensen">Rjensen</a> 10:32, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I checked on the UFO story, and indeed Goldwater in 1994 told Larry King he believed there were alien life forms. As the article notes, he was becoming senile. The letter to a constituent was staff written--the sort of thing congression staff write to true believers. <a href="../../../r/j/e/User%7ERjensen_b7df.html" title="User:Rjensen">Rjensen</a> 13:37, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm usually on the other side of these arguments, trying to strip out relative trivia (and I really don't care that much either way about the UFO thing) but I think some of these changes have tended to remove his humanity from the article. His friendships did not follow party lines, and he was outspoken in his views on other prominent politicians of the era. Both are unusual. I think the article should reflect that. -- <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 04:17, 17 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't see anything unusual here. Before the 1990s cross-party friendships were the norm in Washington. He and Kennedy were freshmen senators together and often were at the same parties, where they chatted. Goldwater was not especially friendly with Kennedy. He did have occasional snide remarks about people, but that was not especially noteworthy. So let's skip the gossip and focus more on his actions. For example, much more is needed on his labor policy (where again he collaborated with the Kennedys). <a href="../../../r/j/e/User%7ERjensen_b7df.html" title="User:Rjensen">Rjensen</a> 05:00, 17 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I cut this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Before the 1964 election, a muckraking magazine, Fact, published by Ralph Ginzburg, polled psychiatrists on whether Goldwater was psychologically fit to be President. Most of the psychiatrists said no. (Goldwater had had a nervous breakdown in his youth.) After the election, Goldwater sued for libel--and a jury awarded him $75,000 against Goldwater and the magazine, and $1 against Ginzburg, the magazine, and Warren Boroson, an editor at the magazine. Boroson claims that the main biography of Goldwater in the magazine was actually written by David Bar-Illan, the Israeli pianist.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For starters: citation? But assuming that is forthcoming, this is incoherent: "After the election, Goldwater sued for libel--and a jury awarded him $75,000 against Goldwater and the magazine, and $1 against Ginzburg, the magazine, and Warren Boroson" The jury awarded Goldwater $75,000 against Goldwater and the magazine??? Work out what you mean to say, cite your source. I suppose that if true this would merit mention in Wikipedia (it is very hard for a public figure to win a libel case in the U.S., so if he won, that certainly belongs in Wikipedia somewhere), though perhaps more in terms of libel law or Ginzburg than in terms of Goldwater (I don't see the point in a short biographical article of raising a libelous accusation, only to say it was dismissed as libelous). -- <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 05:58, 1 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>"He began to drink heavily, a health issue he never completely overcame."</p>
<p>IMHO this needs clarification. Is it meant to say that his heavy drinking caused physical problems? or do you mean to say that he was an alcholic who continued to drink heavily, and that alcholoism is a health issue? Was his drinking even a problem? Did he have driving or social incidents?</p>
<p>The whole statement is unclear and unsupported. I have no opinion about the vaildity of what the author is trying to say, but suggest that the statement be clarified and supported, or deleted. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 68.184.146.61 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_68.184.146.61_28c8.html" title="Special:Contributions/68.184.146.61">contribs</a>) 25 May 2006.</small></p>

<p>I don't see the relevance of the web link in the reference at the end of the paragraph that begins "The Goldwater campaign spotlighted Ronald Reagan". It's to the online first chapter of a Bush biography. Goldwater is not even mentioned. I take it that a different chapter of the book may be relevant; fine; but why link an irrelvant chapter? - <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 04:40, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>50-50 that something like this was a stunt instigated by opponents.

<p>"In fact, his own daughter Joanne chose to have an abortion before her first marriage at the age of 20, and he supported her decision. He was also not against homosexuals in the military. (Goldwater had a grandson who was homosexual.)" I'm no Goldwater expert, but the claim his daughter had an abortion is rather heavy. It is well known Mr. Goldwater supported abortion rights, but I'd never heard this.

<dd>Okay, I'll put it back. I missed the bit on him remining in the reserves after the war, and was under the impression he only did service in WWII, which doesn't make him a career soldier. In general I think it's a bad idea to have someone called a "soldier" if they only served for a couple years, but I guess that's very debatable. It seems to me too much like putting "dishwasher" for someone who worked in an Applebee's kitchen during college. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 20:56, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Largely agree, although I suspect that time in the military usually has rather more effect on one's formation than time in an Applebee's.
