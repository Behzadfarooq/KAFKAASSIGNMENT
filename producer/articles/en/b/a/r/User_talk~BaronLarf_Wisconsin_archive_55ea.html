<p>Hello there! When you are adding categories to an article, please be sure that it is not already covered by a more specific category to avoid redundancy. I found a couple of articles to which you added <a href="../../../w/i/s/Category%7EWisconsin_politicians_54d1.html" title="Category:Wisconsin politicians">Category:Wisconsin politicians</a> that were already in <a href="../../../g/o/v/Category%7EGovernors_of_Wisconsin_5ae9.html" title="Category:Governors of Wisconsin">Category:Governors of Wisconsin</a>; one of those was additionally categorized as serving under both houses of the state legislature. Obviously all Wisconsin governors and Wisconsin legislators are also Wisconsin politicians. If we didn't exclude from articles all parent categories to which they necessarily belong as members of subcategories, <a href="../../../c/o/l/Coles_Bashford_e208.html" title="Coles Bashford">Coles Bashford</a>, for example, would also be placed in Category:U.S. politicians, <a href="../../../g/o/v/Category%7EGovernment_of_Wisconsin_7f82.html" title="Category:Government of Wisconsin">Category:Government of Wisconsin</a>, <a href="../../../s/t/a/Category%7EState_governors_of_the_U.S._f405.html" title="Category:State governors of the U.S.">Category:State governors of the U.S.</a>, <a href="../../../w/i/s/Category%7EWisconsin_0d10.html" title="Category:Wisconsin">Category:Wisconsin</a>, <a href="../../../p/e/o/Category%7EPeople_from_Wisconsin_c5f9.html" title="Category:People from Wisconsin">Category:People from Wisconsin</a>, <a href="../../../a/m/e/Category%7EAmerican_people_128f.html" title="Category:American people">Category:American people</a>, <a href="../../../p/e/o/Category%7EPeople_4ca7.html" title="Category:People">Category:People</a>...

<p>May I inquire why you removed the synagogue link from the Eau Claire page (and from the La Crosse page too I see)? I was surprised to see it show up there, but not particularly disturbed by it, but I'm curious why you saw fit to delete it without a word on the talk page as to why...in fact, you didn't even bother to comment on your deletion. What I find to be the strangest about your deletion is that the person who put it there, 4.158.171.24, apparently went around much of the midwest putting links to various synagogues in medium-sized cities...yet the only ones you saw fit to delete were the ones in Eau Claire and La Crosse. I admit, I'm not entirely impartial...as the webmaster, I'm wondering if you found something about the site particularly objectionable? <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">TShilo12</a> 09:01, 16 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I don't find anything objectionable about it, just nothing notable. Why link to a single house of worship from a page devoted to a city? With that logic, every church, synagogue, etc should have a link there. If anything, there could be a link to a page which lists the places of worship in that city. The way it was seemed to be doing nothing but promoting a non-notable place of worship over others. I only deleted it from Eau Claire and La Crosse because I happened to see it there as I was going through cities from Wisconsin.--BaronLarf 15:04, Feb 16, 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>In that case, I agree with your decision to do so. I would take the time to delete the rest of them myself, but I'll let someone else worry about that, since listing or delisting houses of worship really isn't very big on my list of interest. Perhaps I'll open up the Yellow Pages someday when I have nothing to do (like 317 years after I die), and do just that. Or maybe one of these days I'll discover what this "boredom" thing is that people talk about. That hasn't happened to me yet... &#160;:-) <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">TShilo12</a> 20:19, 16 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks for your comment regarding Wisconsin articles. You're right, a Wisconsin/Milwaukee Wikiproject is in order someday. I created the Milwaukee article many moons ago, so I have tried to stay with it somewhat. (It was more of a shell or list, but prior to that all the page talked about was beer and partying...) I have seen your editing at the Milwaukee article; hope you can continue in between your other contributions.

<p>I saw that the other day on your userspace and meant to ask you about it...lemme finish up sorting through all the Wisconsin articles I can find that need my pretty stub tag slapped on them first, and then I'll get back to you w/ my thoughts on the WP:WP_W. <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tomer</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><font size="-1" color="#129DBC">TALK</font></a></sup> 21:23, July 24, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>OK, I've lost interest in this for a while...I haven't done the Wisconsin Sports and Wisconsin People cats and subcats.

<dd>I haven't fully-formed my ideas about the WikiProject yet, though I've been toying with the idea for two months. When I saw you creating a new stub type and implementing it on lots of articles, I thought that it might be time to set up a WikiProject so we could work together on destubbing them. I'll add more to the project page tomorrow, and help you add the stub messages on those sports and people pages.

<p>I was pretty sure that my quote - since it credited the original publication - was ok under "fair use" however, I contacted Kevin Savetz who has permission to post the articles on the web. His response seems to ok that. I would like to resubmit my entry but before I do - what other objections to you have that would prompt you to summarily revert my edits?</p>

<p>You reverted the additions I made to the entry on WVTV, saying that they were copied from: <a href="http://www.milwaukee-horror-hosts.com/MilwTV.html" class="external free" title="http://www.milwaukee-horror-hosts.com/MilwTV.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.milwaukee-horror-hosts.com/MilwTV.html</a>.

<dd>Sorry, but there's no way of showing that you are the same person who wrote the website article. In order to protect his copyrighted material, it was removed.

<p>Well, it was a rewrite. You reverted it 6 minutes after I posted it - hardly enough time to check.</p>
<p>The easy way to clear things up would have been for you to have gone to the website, write an email to the contact, and I would have responded that I wrote that section and that it was ok.</p>
<p>If we work this out, I'll write the histories of WJJA and WPXE, but I'm not going to take all of the time to do so and then have those pages reverted.</p>

<p>BaronLarf, Wow. Congratulations on getting the admin tap. I hope that when you settle at your new location, you still have time for the old WP, which needs good editors. Speaking of that, I wrote an article for <a href="../../../b/j/%C3%B6/Bj%C3%B6rklunden.html" title="BjÃ¶rklunden">BjÃ¶rklunden</a> based on a newspaper clipping my mother sent me (I even referenced it). It could use some treatment from a student who actually had a chance to attend something there (NPOV of course). Mention of <a href="../../../b/j/o/Bjorklunden.html" title="Bjorklunden">Bjorklunden</a> (this is a redirect) should also be added to the Lawrence page. I made some attempts, but all involved major changes to the order of the page and it's after midnight. I'll see if I have more time for both articles tomorrow. Will you do what you can? Thanks. -<a href="../../../a/c/j/User%7EAcjelen_acd8.html" title="User:Acjelen">Acjelen</a> 05:27, 13 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks; I'll definitely take a look at it and try to help you out. I don't get internet installed at my new place until tomorrow, but I'm hoping to become active again soon after that. --<a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaronLarf_c8b8.html" title="User:BaronLarf">Baron</a><a href="../../../b/a/r/User_talk%7EBaronLarf_6f13.html" title="User talk:BaronLarf">Larf</a> 19:26, 13 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've finally decided on a place for the first Wikipedia meetup in Chicago: 2 p.m. at <b>Saturday, October 15th</b> at <a href="http://www.cafeiberico.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.cafeiberico.com/" rel="nofollow">Cafe Iberico</a>, a <a href="../../../t/a/p/Tapas.html" title="Tapas">tapas bar</a> in the River North neighborhood of Chicago at 739 N. La Salle Drive. They have parking available and are 0.3 mile from the Chicago stop of the CTA Red Line. See their website for parking information; for transit planning use <a href="http://www.transitchicago.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.transitchicago.com/" rel="nofollow">the RTA trip planner</a> with a destination address of "739 N. La Salle Dr." Cafe Iberico has vegetarian selections for those who are so inclined (sorry, they're not very vegan-friendly, I'm afraid). The food is excellent and the environment very suitable for an informal gathering. Do check their webpage for any additional questions, or ask me. They typically cost typically costs between $10 and $15 per person; I'm willing to cover for anyone for whom this is too much (as long as we don't get too many people).</p>
<p>Please let me know before <b>Saturday, October 8th</b> (by email or on my talk page) if you're planning on coming so I can make the appropriate reservations. See you there! Oh, and please share this invitation with anyone you know of in the Chicago area who I've missed. <a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKelly_Martin_056a.html" title="User:Kelly Martin">Kelly Martin</a> 19:53, 2 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
