<p><i>The following is the archive of an ended discussion. Please don't edit the contents. The result of the discussion was <b>rename the Anti-Vandalism Barnstar as the RickK Anti-Vandalism Barnstar</b></i>.</p>
<div style="border:1px solid red;width:100%;background-color:#dddddd">
<p>I know that we already have both a <i>Defender of the Wiki</i> and an <i>Anti-Vandalism</i> barnstar, but I would like to suggest an additional, <i>senior</i> award for those tireless, long-serving Wikipedians who have defended us for a long time, have withstood countless vandal attacks upon their own users pages for doing their jobs, and who neverless continue to persevere.</p>
<p><i>Optionally</i>, (and no doubt <i>controversially</i>), I would also like to suggest that it be named in <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickK_c665.html" title="User:RickK">RickK</a>'s honor.</p>
<p>As a <i>senior</i> award, I would like to further suggest that the Wikipedians who award it might want to consider the following criterion:</p>
<ul>
<li>A potential candidate for the award should already have received <i>The Defender of the Wiki Barnstar</i> or the <i>The Anti-Vandalism Barnstar</i>.</li>
<li>A potential candidate for the award should be a regular and consistent RC patroller.</li>
<li>A potential candidate for the award should have a certain minimum number of edits (1000? 2000?) and/or have been here a certain minimum amount of time (6 months? A year?).</li>
</ul>
<p>Other criteria might be considered as well: for instance, I have no idea how long <a href="../../../c/r/y/User%7ECryptoDerk_6aa9.html" title="User:CryptoDerk">CryptoDerk</a> has been here, how many edits he has made or whether or not he is on rc patrol alot, <b>but</b> having created <a href="../../../c/r/y/User%7ECryptoDerk_CDVF_0a2d.html" title="User:CryptoDerk/CDVF">CDVF</a> would certainly make him a <i>Senior Guardian</i>.&#160;:)</p>

<ul>
<li>I appreciate your intention, but as far as wiki-awards are concerned, several criteria for awarding it become rather difficult, if not impossible, to enforce. In fact, there is no actual way to police or enforce the awarding of Barnstars and other awards. If someone were to receive the award without having received one of the previous awards, of with less than the minimum number of edits set, what could anyone do about it? We can't just go to people's talk/user pages and remove awards that others have bestowed upon them. Even the existing awards, which are guided only by their scopes, get awarded "off topic", so to speak, every now and then. I see no practical way to make this work, but your idea certainly is admirable. I would have no objection to naming it after RickK, he sure does a lot of work for the project.

<ul>
<li>I like the idea of naming a barnstar after RickK. Since he used to deal with tonnes of vandalism, how about we re-name the <a href="../../../b/a/r/Image%7EBarnstar_of_Reversion2.png_be56.html" title="Image:Barnstar of Reversion2.png">Anti-Vandalism Barnstar</a>, or something similar, as the <b>RickK Barnstar</b>? There are some, however, who didn't like RickK, and would probably object to getting a barnstar that is so named. --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">Death</a><a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>phoenix</b></a> 15:46, 24 July 2005 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>Sounds good to me. In time, if the award takes, the fact that it was named after a user who did a lot of work to fight vandalism will become a topic for one of those "Did you know" sections. Not something that would work against the award, misathinks. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedux_c670.html" title="User:Redux">Redux</a> 17:16, 24 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd>It doesn't quite look like a Barnstar yet, so as of now, I'm against having 'Barnstar' in its name. However, since you proposed the 'Starfish Barnstar' (great idea!), I'm thinking of creating a new image of a starfish with the contours of the original Barnstar, which works quite well since the two are very similarly shaped.

<dd>I oppose this one; I've thought about it, and there's already the <b>The E=MC<sup>2</sup> Barnstar</b> for science and mathematics. This is a <a href="../../../b/a/r/Wikipedia%7EBarnstars_on_Wikipedia_c8fc.html#Category_Barnstars" title="Wikipedia:Barnstars on Wikipedia">Category Barnstar</a>, one of those that were created solely for the purpose of preventing excessive proliferation of Barnstars. A Barnstar (even multiple Barnstars, as suggested) for oceanography seems unfair, as there is no specific Barnstar for biology or any other individual science fields. Anyone is welcome to give out awards to acknowledge excellent contributions, but they don't necessarily have to be official Barnstars, which are generally very broad in scope. Those are just my thoughts. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESango123_0773.html" title="User:Sango123"><font color="#3D9140">Sango</font></a><a href="../../../s/a/n/User_talk%7ESango123_3e3e.html" title="User talk:Sango123"><font color="#006400">123</font></a> 01:46, July 26, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>After my 3-week experience in barnstar-awarding, I find that there is quite a need to divide the awarding area for the E=MC2 barnstar into 2: natural (hard) science and theoretical/microscopic (soft) science.

<dd>It seems that only three people have been awarded the E=MC<sup>2</sup> Barnstar thus far. You mean that maybe the award, or rather, the two new awards you propose to create, would be more popular? I don't know, my experience is that, the more we narrow down the scope of a Barnstar, the less it actually gets awarded. But if you have ideas for those two new awards, you could display them here, so a broader appreciation may be obtained. For the uninitiated, the distinction you made between the two may not be that easy to visualize, so perhaps you could lie them down in a more explicit way. Also, if you have graphic design expertise, you can also propose the appearances you would like the awards to have. If you don't, I'm sure some of the people who contribute here would help you out in that (I lack the skills and the software, sorry), but you might have to contact them directly, since we all contribute in so many fronts and it gets difficult to be on top of every discussion going on in this forum.

<dd>Your proposal seems sound. But consider what I said: narrowing down the scope of an award may end up weakining it (in this case, it would mean that both Barnstars would be less likely to be awarded, I believe). As for changing the name of the E=MC<sup>2</sup> award, it was agreed upon in a vote. It actually took us forever to finally agree on an image and a name for the award. In light of that, changing it would require consensus, maybe another vote. Also another detail: generally, the term "Barnstar" is used when the award features a Barnstar in it, even if it's somewhat modified; the "Natural Science Barnstar" doesn't actually feature a Barnstar, although it's pretty close in terms of general appearance. You might consider some alternative appearances, in case this one gets objected, and/or alternative names, as another way of getting around this if necessary.

<p>Nice to have you back Bratsche. About the Barnstar image: you're right Deryck, it <b>is</b> a Barnstar. My bad. As for the creation of the new award and the new scope for the E=MC one, Bratsche is right. We need more input from various users before going ahead with it. I, for one, am not entirely convinced that breaking the present award in two would be the best move, for the reason I've stated above. At this point, we don't even have enough discussion going on to start a vote. It would be best not to promote any changes in the Barnstar page for now. Sometimes it takes us a little while to get some things done here, but this is the only way to ensure that the awards will not get disputed once they get instated.

<dd>Zscout370 brought up a detail that I feel is key here: Deryck, do you believe that there's going to be a considerable, or a reasonable at least, demand for a Natural Science-specific award? It's true that the present E=MC award's appearance evokes primarily theoretical science, but the idea was to create an award for work on scientific topics in general. There doesn't seem to be much of a demand for the existing award as it is. Do you believe that there's going to be one for both the awards?

<dd>In my humble opinion, we'd be safer with just one award for science-related efforts. Perhaps we could discuss a new image for it though, one that would be more "neutral" in terms of theoretical science and natural science. Unless you (or anyone) would make the point that the two topics, although being generally about science, are distant from each other, and that awarding them both with the same Barnstar would be unseemly. If that were to be the case, then it wouldn't be about demand anyways, and the two should definitely be split. This is not my field of expertise, so I could be generalizing — to be honest, when we were discussing the original award, it never even cross my mind the distinction between theoretical science and natural science, which is entirely valid (I'm just not certain if it would be one to warrant two separate science Barnstars).

<p>I would like to propose the creation of a Bot Barnstar, to award an individual for creating or running bots that assist the Wikipedia in some matter, whether it is maintenance related, uploading information, etc. -- <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllyUnion_7163.html" title="User:AllyUnion">AllyUnion</a> <a href="../../../a/l/l/User_talk%7EAllyUnion_d722.html" title="User talk:AllyUnion">(talk)</a> 05:11, 9 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sounds like a great idea. Bots do a lot of behind-the-scenes work that has greatly helped Wikipedia. <a href="../../../v/f/d/User%7EVFD_Bot_4e8f.html" title="User:VFD Bot">VFD Bot</a> (thank you, AllyUnion), <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMathbot_604f.html" title="User:Mathbot">Mathbot</a> (ditto <a href="../../../o/l/e/User%7EOleg_Alexandrov_8bb5.html" title="User:Oleg Alexandrov">Oleg Alexandrov</a>), and <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERambot_08b0.html" title="User:Rambot">Rambot</a> (kudos <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERam-Man_eba5.html" title="User:Ram-Man">Ram-Man</a>) would probably qualify. I'd probably give it a shot when I have time, but I can see this one looking like a couple of circuit boards soldered together in the shape of a star, or maybe a stereotypical robot that looks like a star. --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">Death</a><a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>phoenix</b></a> 06:14, 9 May 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I second this idea.

<dd>I would also give this Barnstar to the people who created the bots, since without their efforts, the bots will not be here. <a href="../../../z/s/c/User%7EZscout370_3f46.html" title="User:Zscout370">Zscout370</a> <a href="../../../z/s/c/User_talk%7EZscout370_dbee.html" title="User talk:Zscout370">(talk)</a> 14:35, 9 May 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>On the talk pages, we can either award the users, or perhaps we can award it to the bots with an explicit note allowing or encouraging them to place the barnstar in the owners' user pages, whichever you prefer. --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">Death</a><a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>phoenix</b></a> 17:16, 9 May 2005 (UTC)

<dd>It will be easier for the Barnstar to be placed on the owner's talk page, and describing to them which bot got the award and why. <a href="../../../z/s/c/User%7EZscout370_3f46.html" title="User:Zscout370">Zscout370</a> <a href="../../../z/s/c/User_talk%7EZscout370_dbee.html" title="User talk:Zscout370">(talk)</a> 17:51, 9 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't particularly know how to rotate the barnstar at an angle... The BSD daemon's horns are on his head because he's facing at an angle. If someone had more artistic skills than photo manipulation skills, we might have something better. I'd perfer somehow to make the barnstar more... cartoony and draw in the horns, the trident, and the shoes. And oh, the idea of using the BSD Daemon is on the concept of what a UNIX daemon is... more or less what bots do. Bots on the Wikipedia are more or less Daemons themselves. I wouldn't necessarily consider bots as angels... since some bots do cause harm. Daemons are normally more neutral... -- <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllyUnion_7163.html" title="User:AllyUnion">AllyUnion</a> <a href="../../../a/l/l/User_talk%7EAllyUnion_d722.html" title="User talk:AllyUnion">(talk)</a> 11:09, 19 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Well, I think most of them look good, but we should decide on what angle to take: Daemon, Linux, Intel, or something else. <a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBratsche_d97d.html" title="User:Bratsche"><font color="#006666">Bratsche</font></a><sup><a href="../../../b/r/a/User_talk%7EBratsche_6f8a.html" title="User talk:Bratsche"><font color="#FF6600">talk</font></a> <a href="../../../5/p/_/WP%7E5P_c2b8.html" title="WP:5P"><font color="#333333">5 pillars</font></a></sup> 15:57, Jun 21, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>The thing is that we have to remember that a bot is a designed piece of code that is usually meant to be used unattended and automatic. It might be attended, but it is still automatic and geared toward some function. Basing it off a circuit board, to me, seems not particularly accurate in the sense of the work of what bots do on the Wikipedia. And neither does implying that Intel is the only type of processor which a bot runs off of. One could take the view that the barnstar is to award the maintainer of the bot... and the image of a computer geek could apply in some sense... However, it made sense to me that we try to use something that symbolic to something that is equal to an "errand boy." Because that's what bots are really, they are our automatic "errand boys". They take our grunt work off of normal users, and liberate us from doing them. One of the reasons that I thought of a <a href="../../../d/a/e/Daemon_%28computer_software%29.html" title="Daemon (computer software)">Daemon</a>, particularly the character used as the <a href="../../../b/s/d/BSD_Daemon_4d7f.html" title="BSD Daemon">BSD Daemon</a>. It's ashame I'm not an artist, but it'd be nice if someone could make a cartoonish looking barnstar with eyes, a smile and such that looks similar to the BSD Daemon. -- <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllyUnion_7163.html" title="User:AllyUnion">AllyUnion</a> <a href="../../../a/l/l/User_talk%7EAllyUnion_d722.html" title="User talk:AllyUnion">(talk)</a> 06:31, 22 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Now that you mentioned "errand boy", I immediately thought of <a href="../../../m/r/2E/Mr._ZIP_aa56.html" title="Mr. ZIP">Mr. ZIP</a> and the logo <a href="http://www.usps.com/history/his2_75.htm#ZIP" class="external text" title="http://www.usps.com/history/his2_75.htm#ZIP" rel="nofollow">here</a>.

<li>I find the robot barnstar you have created rather scary... It reminds me of Hal, and I'd do not want that as an idea for a barnstar... The Binary Barnstar is good, but some how it reminds me of the Matrix. --<a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllyUnion_7163.html" title="User:AllyUnion">AllyUnion</a> <a href="../../../a/l/l/User_talk%7EAllyUnion_d722.html" title="User talk:AllyUnion">(talk)</a> 1 July 2005 10:56 (UTC)</li>

<p>Hmm... SEWilco's barnstar gave me an interesting idea. What if you used the five star points to represent "computer nodes" and they all point to the middle to where the empty hole is for the barnstar? This is on the concept of a networking star configuration, and that bots are multiple systems connecting to the Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllyUnion_7163.html" title="User:AllyUnion">AllyUnion</a> <a href="../../../a/l/l/User_talk%7EAllyUnion_d722.html" title="User talk:AllyUnion">(talk)</a> 1 July 2005 10:59 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi all - back after a gap (forgot to update my watch list when this page was spun off, so forgot what was going on here)... I have three thoughts for you, two possible barnstars and (IMHO) a great name for one of them. I've been working quite a bit around the tfd, cfd, and vfd pages (and hopefully will be around sfd if that ever takes off), and that's prompted a couple of thoughts. What I suggest are:</p>
<ol>
<li>A barnstar for people who repeatedly and effectively save articles from vfd by rewriting hopeless articles that are nominated up to a standard where no-one would think of deleting them; and</li>
<li>A barnstar for tireless work cleaning out the messes which end up at tfd and cfd (there are a lot of chore activities involved in both). This one, I would suggest calling "Barnstar of the Knights Template"&#160;:)</li>
</ol>
<p>Any takers? <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<font color="green"><small><i><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness">wha?</a> 13:43, 17 May 2005 (UTC)</i></small></font></p>

<p>I hereby propose a barnstar for people who help the various language versions of Wikipedia by translating articles into other languages / getting native speakers to do so and providing them with information, in order to make articles present on all language versions. This not only greatly helps in creating complete Wikipedias in the smaller Wikipedias, with fewer members who only know about a few subjects, but also allows people to read articles about the more common subjects in their own language, where it may have been previously impossible. I don't have any image to submit yet, but I think it should feature a barnstar (of course) and a globe, or a selection of glyphs / flags denoting "smaller" languages. This to emphasize the multilingual character of the award. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/en:User:Har%C3%B0or" class="extiw" title="w:en:User:Harðor">Harðor</a> 14:48, 1 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I was just talking about this the other day - an Interlingual barnstar has to be a good idea. I have had cause to request translations into English for excellent articles on other Wikis at least three times, and I've always been delighted with the results.</dd>
<dd>Also I would support AllyUnion's star - except it seems a little big. Would it be possible to overlay the laurels on the star? I guess you would also have to change the colour of the star to say dark blue or gold? -- <a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESolipsist_66d1.html" title="User:Solipsist">Solipsist</a> 07:09, 8 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I rather shrink mine... I'm not certain if you got the pun of my image... it is a parody of the United Nations flag.

<dd>Yes, I like the UN reference (except for licensing issues with the original flag, which probably isn't too much of a problem).

<dd>And a further alternative. My suggestion of a dark blue or gold barnstar ends up looking ugly, but the white barnstar with overlayed UN laurels works quite well with a drop shadow <a href="../../../b/a/r/Image%7EBarnstar-Interlingual2.png_246b.html" class="image" title="Image:Barnstar-Interlingual2.png"><img src="../../../upload/9/9d/Barnstar-Interlingual2.png" alt="Image:Barnstar-Interlingual2.png" width="111" height="107" longdesc="../../../b/a/r/Image%7EBarnstar-Interlingual2.png_246b.html" /></a>. -- <a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESolipsist_66d1.html" title="User:Solipsist">Solipsist</a> 11:31, 10 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I think this might be problematic, since it looks more like an "international" rather than "interlingual".

<dd>I must admit I like the one with the two branches overlaid and the drop shadows. Another possibility would be a barnstar overlaid on the Wiki globe (as at the top left of this and every page). That would get across the interlingual idea. Perhaps like one of the two images below...<br />

That's what I get for taking too long.&#160;:-P In any case, let me give you some feedback based on my own thoughts about using the Vetruvian man for a barnstar: The way he spreads his arms is like a star by itself.

<p>I know I'm a little late in this discussion, but I'd like, if I might, to take the opportunity to make a suggestion: I rather like the Cool as a Cocumber award, but the fact that there are gender variations is perhaps not ideal, since we aren't always sure of the gender of a user. A screen name isn't always — in fact, it's hardly ever — revealing in that aspect. Having one general award would make awarding it much more simple.

<dd>I was not involved in the discussions concerning this award. But usually the community "lets an idea die" when discussions lead nowhere, or express agreement is reached, indicating that the idea will not work. In this case, it seems to me that a wikiaward just for Oceanography is far too specific for it to be a wikiaward. We prefer the awards have a broader scope, so as to make them awardable to a larger number of people, for work in a larger spectrum of articles. Notice that this is not to say that an award as you suggest could not be created, just maybe not a wikiaward, or a Barnstar, that would be added to the <a href="../../../b/a/r/Wikipedia%7EBarnstars_on_Wikipedia_c8fc.html" title="Wikipedia:Barnstars on Wikipedia">Wikipedia:Barnstars on Wikipedia</a> page. It is, however, completely doable to create an "internal award" for the community of contributors for Oceonagraphy-related articles.

<p>First, notice that about 80% of the existing awards, which are numerous, are scarcely awarded, if ever. There are just a handful of awards that become more popular. Unchecked proliferation of Barnstars (and other awards) only aggravates this scenario. Not long ago, people used to create and instate awards as they pleased. That allowed for awards that were given out two or three times and then completely forgotten, not to mention awards with unclear, or even unsuited, themes. We started this discussion section, and subjected the creation of new awards to a previous discussion and approval by the community, as a means to deal with those problems. Please notice that no one here is looking to undermine, or "kill", anyone's ideas, but we do have a process by which people contribute to improve the general quality of wiki awards. We have discussions, we take votes, it doesn't get more democratic than this. Finally, it is key to notice that all this I've just said applies only to wiki awards. As I had mentioned, internal (in this case, Oceanography-specific) awards are left to each user's or segments of the community's discretion. We only work on wiki awards, for the Barnstars on Wikipedia (which also includes other community awards) project page, here.<br />
It is possible, however, that in this particular case we pulled the plug on this award too soon. I don't know, I wasn't there. The process certainly isn't perfect, but we are here to strive towards that, or as close as possible, anyways.

<dd>Well said, Redux. To clarify, there is no animosity against the actual award (it's listed at <a href="../../../p/u/a/WP%7EPUA_9bb4.html" title="WP:PUA">WP:PUA</a>), but since we already have a science category barnstar, and to prevent "barnstar creep", the award is not needed as an "official: award. For the same reasons, some are against the Natural Science Barnstar, not because it's a bad award, but because there needs to be a set number of barnstars instead of a whole mess of awards. It would be a shame now if we all went back to awarding the Hero of the Soviet medal instead of the more Wikipedia-like barnstar. On the same note, I found <a href="http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?BarnStar" class="external text" title="http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?BarnStar" rel="nofollow">this page</a> from the Meatball Wiki useful to shed some light on why we actually use the barnstar in the first place; it has great significance in community building. <a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBratsche_d97d.html" title="User:Bratsche"><font color="#006666">Bratsche</font></a><sup><a href="../../../b/r/a/User_talk%7EBratsche_6f8a.html" title="User talk:Bratsche"><font color="#FF6600">talk</font></a> <a href="../../../5/p/_/WP%7E5P_c2b8.html" title="WP:5P"><font color="#333333">5 pillars</font></a></sup> 03:08, August 8, 2005 (UTC)

Just stick to narrow minded arguments (is any of you a scientist? you don't even work with a name with us), you are not doing a favor for Wikipedia (what "vote" do you refer to?) at personal award I do not want it, will never award it, maybe invite the editors to our campus instead <a href="../../../k/i/l/User%7EKils_f4a7.html" title="User:Kils"><font color="#A29EBA"><i><b>Uwe Kils</b></i></font></a> <a href="../../../h/e/r/Image%7EHeringmini.jpg_fd2a.html" class="image" title="Image:heringmini.jpg"><img src="../../../upload/3/3a/Heringmini.jpg" alt="Image:heringmini.jpg" width="84" height="20" longdesc="../../../h/e/r/Image%7EHeringmini.jpg_fd2a.html" /></a> 10:44, August 9, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I agree with Redux and Bratsche. Absolutely no offense meant, but whether or not we are scientists is not relevant in this issue. The issue is if this should be accepted as a general Wikipedia award, not something only an exclusive group of people would understand and use. I don't see why the <i>E=MC<sup>2</sup> Barnstar</i> would not be sufficient, as it includes all the sciences.

<dd>Thank you for your suggestion. The scope you propose, however, seems far too specific for a wiki award, which needs to be awardable to a broader variety of contributions/contributors. It may be worth adding it to the <a href="../../../p/u/a/WP%7EPUA_9bb4.html" title="WP:PUA">Personal User Awards</a> page, which is a list of awards created by users or groups of users for more specific, or directed, purposes.

<dd>This looks good to me, and I rather obviously support the measure. We need a clear idea of the purposes and criteria of the award, though. Calling it the Wikinews barnstar sounds pretty weird since Wikinews is a separate project, but that might be just me. Perhaps a... "Current Events Barnstar"? The logo would still do fine. As for criteria, they could be awarded for substantial work on any article that's classified as a current event, <i>or</i> on such an article that's crowded (London bombings), controversial (<a href="../../../t/e/r/Terri_Schiavo_eb3a.html" title="Terri Schiavo">Terri Schiavo</a>) or otherwise difficult, <i>or</i> as a "Cataclysm Barnstar" for helping information get through when it's most important. Or I might be wrong entirely.-- <a href="../../../k/i/z/User%7EKizor_34ff.html" title="User:Kizor">Kizor</a> 7 July 2005 22:21 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I like where your idea is going. <b>The Current Events Barnstar</b> sounds like a promising name, though we'll have a Vote or Die session to determine it. The criteria is nicely outlined; so <i>this Barnstar may be awarded to editors who make particularly fine contributions to articles that are crowded, controversial, or categorized under <a href="../../../c/u/r/Category%7ECurrent_events_6154.html" title="Category:Current events">current events</a>, helping accurate information get through when it is most needed.</i> How does that sound?

<dd>Thank you very much. By "crowded", I meant swamped. The frenzy of edits made to the London bombing article made it very difficult for editors to get through and created a rather absurd scene as work was repeatedly inserted and overwritten, and the article got duplicated once every few minutes. How does it sound? Since you asked, nice but somewhat cluttered. I'd suggest: <b>This Barnstar may be awarded to editors who make substantial contributions to <a href="../../../c/u/r/Category%7ECurrent_events_6154.html" title="Category:Current events">current events</a>, helping accurate information get through when it is most needed.</b> "Particularily fine" doesn't really work here, since - for instance - Evercat's many-hour vigil against duplication was a very substantial help but had little to do with finesse. -- <a href="../../../k/i/z/User%7EKizor_34ff.html" title="User:Kizor">Kizor</a> 8 July 2005 12:35 (UTC)</dd>

And the category barnstars use the word 'fine' to define contributions; e.g., <i>The Epic Barnstar may be awarded to an editor who makes particularly fine <a href="../../../h/i/s/Category%7EHistory_9287.html" title="Category:History">History</a>-related contributions.</i> But I suppose one word isn't that important.&#160;:)</dd>

It's <i>very</i> similar to <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESango123_0773.html" title="User:Sango123">Sango123</a>'s version, but with even centering and greater color contrast between the two elements. I incorporated the same (or nearly the same) 90° drop shadow.</p>
<p>I haven't uploaded the image to this site yet, because the Wikinews logo is copyrighted. I usually release image files into the public domain (as <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESango123_0773.html" title="User:Sango123">Sango123</a> did in this case), but that doesn't appear to be legally appropriate.

<dd>I like <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESango123_0773.html" title="User:Sango123">Sango123</a>'s new image, but it conveys more of a "world" connotation than a "current events" connotation. I don't know if <a href="../../../z/s/c/User%7EZscout370_3f46.html" title="User:Zscout370">Zscout370</a>'s idea is legally feasible, but I think that we should pursue it further. Does anyone know whom we could ask about receiving permission to use the Wikinews logo?

<dd>No problem I see, but it seems that if the vote is started now, you and I might be the only ones voting (Sango and Zscout would likely participate too though). I see that most of the people who participated in the discussions about this award are not "regulars" on this forum, and given the extraordinary period of time elapsed, it would appear that the interest (and people's attention) will have gone a little cold by now. But it's not just here, it seems that the entire forum is going through another "dry spell". Maybe another call to action is in order?

<p>I've gone through the discussion, and there may not be a need for a vote, since there appears to have been agreement on the outline of the award, it would seem to be the following:</p>
<div style="float:left; margin-right:1em"><a href="../../../w/i/k/Image%7EWikiNews-barnstar.png_06ae.html" class="image" title="The Current Events Barnstar"><img src="../../../upload/e/e2/WikiNews-barnstar.png" alt="The Current Events Barnstar" width="111" height="107" longdesc="../../../w/i/k/Image%7EWikiNews-barnstar.png_06ae.html" /></a></div>

<p>This barnstar was introduced by <a href="../../../k/i/z/User%7EKizor_34ff.html" title="User:Kizor">Kizor</a> on <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_7.html" title="July 7">July 7</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a> and designed by <a href="../../../z/s/c/User%7EZscout370_3f46.html" title="User:Zscout370">Zscout370</a> and <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESango123_0773.html" title="User:Sango123">Sango123</a>.<br clear="left" /></p>

<p>From the original discussion, it seems that Sango deserves the credit as well. It appears that she was the first person to come up with the actual design for the Barnstar with the Wikinews logo superposed. Quite simple: let's just have the final sentence read: <cite>(...)designed by <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESango123_0773.html" title="User:Sango123">Sango123</a>, <a href="../../../z/s/c/User%7EZscout370_3f46.html" title="User:Zscout370">Zscout370</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/f/User%7ELifeisunfair_1bef.html" title="User:Lifeisunfair">Lifeisunfair</a>.</cite> Splitting the credit three ways seems to be the right thing to do here.

<dd>A three-way credit is fine by me, provided that <a href="../../../z/s/c/User%7EZscout370_3f46.html" title="User:Zscout370">Zscout370</a> is listed first (because the image was his idea). —<a href="../../../l/i/f/User%7ELifeisunfair_1bef.html" title="User:Lifeisunfair">Lifeisunfair</a> 23:01, 23 August 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Ok, but that won't matter much once this discussion is over and archived and the award is added to the project page. No one will check this discussion, and they won't pay much attention to or derive any conclusions from the order in which the names are listed in the template at the project page. If you would like to make absolute sure that due credit is given to each contributor, it would be far more effective to introduce a History section with the details of creation in the award's image page (once the award is officially introduced).
