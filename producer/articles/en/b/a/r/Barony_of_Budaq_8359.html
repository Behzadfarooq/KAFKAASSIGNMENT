<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/r/Barony_of_Budaq_8359.html" title="Edit section: History">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
<p>The <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barony.html" title="Barony">Barony</a> of Budaq was created on February 6, <a href="../../../1/7/3/1736.html" title="1736">1736</a> by Grandmaster <a href="../../../r/a/m/Ramon_Despuig_ed7f.html" title="Ramon Despuig">Ramon Despuig</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../f/i/e/Fief.html" title="Fief">fief</a> of Budaq (originally Budacco) had been granted or sold numerous times during its interesting history:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../1/3/9/1397.html" title="1397">1397</a> Barba family</li>
<li><a href="../../../1/3/9/1398.html" title="1398">1398</a> Gatto family and Aulesa family</li>
<li><a href="../../../1/4/0/1408.html" title="1408">1408</a> Inguanez family</li>
<li><a href="../../../1/6/4/1644.html" title="1644">1644</a> Cilia family</li>
<li><a href="../../../1/6/4/1646.html" title="1646">1646</a> Passalaqua family and Fiteni family</li>
</ul>
<p>The families of Barba, Gatto, Alesa and Inguanez intermarried, passed the <a href="../../../f/i/e/Fiefdom.html" title="Fiefdom">fiefdom</a> as a <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marriage.html" title="Marriage">marriage</a> legacy.</p>
<p>Francesco Cilia had purchased the fief of Budaq from Baron Antonio Inguanez on May 16, <a href="../../../1/5/9/1590.html" title="1590">1590</a> for the sum of 2280 onze, and was registered in the acts of Notary Enrico Zarb. For some reason, neither father nor son ever paid homage to the Grand Master as an acknowledgement of <a href="../../../f/e/a/Fealty.html" title="Fealty">fealty</a> and were consequently never styled <i>Baron</i>.</p>
<p>When Cilia was in danger of having his fief confiscated by the Order for failure to pay homage, he successfully petitioned the Grand Master to formally recognise him as the Baron de Budaq. The Grand Master, Lascaris, acceded to Cilia's request in and concluded a transaction with his protomedico, but only over a part of the fief. He was probably also awarded the "Croce d'Oro" on his appointment. On February 18, <a href="../../../1/6/4/1644.html" title="1644">1644</a>, the Council of the Order gave the Grand Master permission for the said transaction. Eight days later, Cilia was created Baron di Budaq. There is no evidence that Cilia had been ennobled because of his service to the Order, but his appointment as Protomedico probably had considerable influence in his investiture as Baron, since Lascaris could have claimed this fief by virtue of Cilia's omission to pay homage.</p>
<p>Cilia died two years later in <a href="../../../1/6/4/1646.html" title="1646">1646</a>, leaving no successor, whereupon the fief devolved to the Order, to be regranted a few months later. At this time, the fief went to Cesare Passalacqua, his daughter and her husband Silvestro Fiteni. Silvestro Fiteni was Capitano della Verga (1644 - 1652), and was created a Knight of the Order of St John in <a href="../../../1/6/5/1656.html" title="1656">1656</a>. Fiteni left no legitimate heir and so the title became extinct with his death.</p>
<p>The Barony was regranted to Gio Pio de Piro and his wife, Anna Gourgion, by the Grand Master, Perollos, on April 23, <a href="../../../1/7/1/1716.html" title="1716">1716</a>, with the required tribute of two <a href="../../../m/u/s/Musket.html" title="Musket">muskets</a> on <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Barbara_6b0d.html" title="St. Barbara">St. Barbara</a>. The Barony de Budaq was given to the de Piros and his legitimate heirs, males and females, <i>procreatis vel procreandis</i>.</p>
<p>The Baron de Piro could not attend his first Investiture since he was in <a href="../../../s/i/c/Sicily.html" title="Sicily">Sicily</a>. His father paid homage instead. Only three years after de Piro was ennobled, he neglected to present his two muskets, to the grave concern of his father. Not only were Gio Pio's successors never invested, their rights to the Barony was never queried. It may be argued that when a nobleman did not pay homage and present tribute, he was in breach of the original oath, which was similar to that taken in 1644 by the feudatory of Budach, who declared:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I, Niccolo Cilia, swear and promise fidelity, reverence and observance to your Highness and to Your Holy Religion, recognising you as the true and rightful Lords of the fief of Budach which you and your Holy Convent have honoured me with and to present, every year at Easter of the Resurrection, a bunch of roses as rightful recognition in the said fief."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The de Piro family has held this fief to this day.</p>
<p><a name="Note_of_interest" id="Note_of_interest"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/r/Barony_of_Budaq_8359.html" title="Edit section: Note of interest">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Note of interest</span></h2>
<p>The remainder of the Barony to the de Piro family stated "His descendants in perpetuity, each holder of the title having the right to nominate a successor, in default of nomination to the first born male descendant and in absence of male issue, to the first born female descendant. Members of the clergy are precluded from succession by primogeniture."</p>
<p>Wealth therefore becomes an influencing factor in the choice of a prospective "Secreto". The fourteen thousand <a href="../../../s/c/u/Scudi.html" title="Scudi">scudi</a> which Baron Gio Pio de Piro paid out during <a href="../../../1/7/2/1720.html" title="1720">1720</a> - <a href="../../../1/7/2/1721.html" title="1721">1721</a> in his official capacity as Zondadari's administration was less than the private income for the same period of the de Piro-Gourgion family.</p>
<p>The only two sons of Marquis Vincenzo de Piro to marry disregarded the wish of their parents and married partners of their own choosing. The eldest, Antonio, married Teresa de Re, a person of his own "nationality but not of equal rank," from whom it was rumoured, he had an illegitimate child. This enraged his father who not only disinherited him, but also his innocent descendants. Five years later, in <a href="../../../1/7/9/1795.html" title="1795">1795</a>, Antonio left with his family to live in <a href="../../../r/o/m/Rome.html" title="Rome">Rome</a>. The second son, Giuseppe, was nominated, within the space of three years, as the future heir to the lucrative Gourgion and the de Piro entails. Rather surprisingly, he was not disinherited in spite of the fact that he married Generosa Borg, who was below his rank.</p>
<p>The title passed from father to son, until the 4th holder, where it was succeeded by his sister, who died in <a href="../../../1/8/7/1877.html" title="1877">1877</a> and nominated her cousin Msgr. Don Salvatore Grech-Delicata to succeed her. But the Court of Appeal overruled this decision in favour of Giuseppe de Piro-Gourgion, the holder of the Primogeniture. The senior branch of the de Piros, though, were excluded from succession, due to Vincenzo de Piro being born outside of wedlock to the third Baron and his wife, Teresa della Re.</p>
<p>In a lengthy judgment on December 5, <a href="../../../1/8/0/1807.html" title="1807">1807</a>, the Courts of <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malta.html" title="Malta">Malta</a> upheld the primogenital and fede-commessary right, due to Vincenzo and his descendants being members of the de Piro family.</p>
<p>Today, the junior branch still carries the titles of Baron di Budaq and Marquis de Piro (Maltese recognised title), with Nicholas de Piro D’Amico-Inguanez, as the 8th Marquis de Piro, and 9th Baron di Budaq.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/r/Barony_of_Budaq_8359.html" title="Edit section: Giovanni Pio, 1st Baron of Budaq">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Giovanni Pio, 1st Baron of Budaq</span></h2>
<p>Giovanni Pio (Gio’Pio) J.U.D. (<a href="../../../1/6/7/1670.html" title="1670">1670</a> - <a href="../../../1/7/5/1752.html" title="1752">1752</a>) was the 1st Baron of Budach and 1st Marquis de Piro . He studied for his doctorate in <a href="../../../r/o/m/Rome.html" title="Rome">Rome</a> and was appointed ambassador, representing the Grand Master and the Università as procurator of <a href="../../../w/h/e/Wheat.html" title="Wheat">wheat</a>. He was created Baron of Budach by Grand Master Perellos in <a href="../../../1/7/1/1716.html" title="1716">1716</a> with a tribute of two muskets annually to be paid on the feast of <a href="../../../s/t/_/St_Barbara_f810.html" title="St Barbara">St Barbara</a>. He became a Segreto of the Inquisition in <a href="../../../1/7/2/1720.html" title="1720">1720</a>, and in <a href="../../../1/7/2/1728.html" title="1728">1728</a>, became <a href="../../../c/u/r/Curator.html" title="Curator">Curator</a> of the Holy Office. He was placed in a position of further trust by being appointed Secreto of Malta, Gozo and Comino. His honours increased. He was not only appointed Luogotenente of the regimental company to which the Grand Master’s famigliari belonged, but was also appointed Regio Secreto of <a href="../../../s/y/r/Syracuse%2C_Italy_db3e.html" title="Syracuse, Italy">Syracuse</a> by the King of <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spain.html" title="Spain">Spain</a>.</p>
<p>By <a href="../../../1/7/4/1742.html" title="1742">1742</a>, Gio’Pio was Senior Jurat of Valletta and later Lieutenant Governor of Malta. As a stepping stone to his final accolade, he was temporally created Viscount Cartely but this title was suppressed in order to raise him further. On November 6, <a href="../../../1/7/4/1742.html" title="1742">1742</a>, <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philip_V_of_Spain_2f3b.html" title="Philip V of Spain">Philip V</a> of Spain raised him to the rank of <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marquis.html" title="Marquis">Marquis</a> de Piro in the Kingdom of <a href="../../../c/a/s/Castile_%28historical_region%29.html" title="Castile (historical region)">Castile</a>.</p>
<p>Gio’Pio was an entrepreneur with seemingly insatiable ambition and unflagging energy. He was soon in charge of his family’s business, including transactions involving infidel <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slaves.html" title="Slaves">slaves</a>. The family archives held a bill for 1,500 Scudi, representing one transaction in which Gio’Pio sold <a href="../../../m/u/s/Muslim.html" title="Muslim">Muslims</a> to a Muslim trader called Rais. But these were early days in his career. Soon, he would concentrate on other people’s administrations and prove his reliability.</p>
<p>His marriage to Anna Antonia Gourgion considerably increased his worldly assets and fortune seems to have been showered upon him for the rest of his life. His wealthy father-in-law’s administration fell into his lap. Giovanni Gourgion was a landowner, Magistro di Sala of the Valletta Magisterial Palace and even a patron of Mattia Preti. The artist painted both Giovanni and his wife, pouring water over the Holy Souls in Purgatory, in a great altarpiece at St George’s Basilica in <a href="../../../g/o/z/Gozo.html" title="Gozo">Gozo</a>.</p>
<p>Gio’Pio’s career was a triumph and perhaps the most successful of any Maltese man of his period. He invested in land, ships, and cargoes of <a href="../../../t/e/x/Textiles.html" title="Textiles">textiles</a>, grain, <a href="../../../s/u/g/Sugar.html" title="Sugar">sugar</a>, <a href="../../../r/i/c/Rice.html" title="Rice">rice</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/f/Coffee.html" title="Coffee">coffee</a>. He would sometimes insure cargoes and ships on his own account. He sometimes lent money, and quite often to knights, resident in <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malta.html" title="Malta">Malta</a>, including the illustrious Fra Carlo Albani, nephew of <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope_Clement_XI_597d.html" title="Pope Clement XI">Pope Clement XI</a>.</p>
<p>Gio’Pio purchased land all over Malta, and great tracts in the plains of Girgenti in <a href="../../../s/i/c/Sicily.html" title="Sicily">Sicily</a>. He kept houses in <a href="../../../v/a/l/Valletta.html" title="Valletta">Valletta</a>, in <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medina.html" title="Medina">Medina</a>, by the sea in <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scicli.html" title="Scicli">Scicli</a> and also in the hexagonal city of <a href="../../../a/v/o/Avola.html" title="Avola">Avola</a>. He also invested in good unions. He married off his daughter to the Baron Ferdinando de Ribera, and his granddaughter to Francesco, eldest son of the Duke of Montalto. Both ladies were given conspicuous <a href="../../../d/o/w/Dowry.html" title="Dowry">dowries</a>, the descriptions of which survive in the family archives.</p>
<p>His business affairs were administered with efficiency. The surviving papers, including many of his letters, make the point. He was always aware of what was happening and crosschecked his information through a series of agents in Malta, Sicily, Naples and Rome. His income in later years would certainly suffice for him to buy a <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palazzo.html" title="Palazzo">palazzo</a>, such as Casa Rocca Piccola, without any need to touch his capital. He organised the education of his sons through his contacts: Angelo went to Siena and was made to take the Holy Orders against his will; Felicissimo Antonio, who pre-deceased his father, went to Lyons; Vincenzo, his adored grandson and heir, went to Rome under the tutelage of the <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albani_%28family%29.html" title="Albani (family)">Albani</a>.</p>
<p>Gio’Pio was conscientious and even religious. He endowed charities, helped spinsters, donated altars and embellishments, and gave oil and legacies to churches for their masses. He died in <a href="../../../1/7/5/1752.html" title="1752">1752</a> after his son, and was succeeded by his grandson. He was buried with his wife in his family vault under an intarsio marble tombstone in the main isle of the Church of St Francis in <a href="../../../v/a/l/Valletta.html" title="Valletta">Valletta</a>.</p>
<p>Antonio Felicissimo, Baroncino of Budach and Marchesino de Piro, died in <a href="../../../1/7/3/1738.html" title="1738">1738</a>. He was Secreto to Grand Master Despuig. He married Elena Grech Balzani as his third wife in <a href="../../../1/7/3/1736.html" title="1736">1736</a> and from this final union was born a son and heir.</p>

<p>Vincenzo (<a href="../../../1/7/3/1736.html" title="1736">1736</a> - <a href="../../../1/7/9/1799.html" title="1799">1799</a>) was the 2nd Baron of Budach and 2nd Marquis de Piro. He became a Jurat and also Procurator of the Inquisition. He was interested in military tactics and operations and was appointed Colonel Commandant of the Royal Sicilian Regiment. In this capacity, he helped to raise the rebellion against the French invaders, and was elected one of the four representatives of the people.</p>
<p>Vincenzo married Maria Testaferrata Abela, daughter of the 3rd Baron of Gomerino, in <a href="../../../1/7/5/1757.html" title="1757">1757</a>, and died in <a href="../../../1/7/9/1799.html" title="1799">1799</a>, having nominated his eldest son to the Barony and his second son to the Marquisate.</p>

They produced four children out of wedlock, two of whom took Holy Orders. The couple eventually married and were blessed with a legitimate, scholarly and erudite heir.</p>

<p>Sir Giuseppe Maria G.C.M.G. (<a href="../../../1/7/9/1794.html" title="1794">1794</a> - <a href="../../../1/8/7/1870.html" title="1870">1870</a>) was the 4th Baron of Budach. He was the author of <i>A History of the Plague of 1813</i> and <i>Pieces of History</i>, both written in Italian. The second book was an impassioned answer to Adolphus Slade’s vitriolic and denigrating commentary on Malta. In his book, Giuseppe Maria listed Maltese savants and artists together with their creditable works of merit. He set out to prove that his compatriots had been the principal factors in procuring their emancipation and had voluntarily submitted to England's help; and that the latter, it had to be remembered, had not lost a single soldier in the procurement of Malta.</p>
<p>According to William Hardiman’s <i><a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Malta_3b6f.html" title="History of Malta">History of Malta</a></i>, Sir G.M. was an aspirant to the government of the Islands (p.643). He married the wealthy Antonia Moscati Gatto Xara, 3rd Baroness of Benwarrad and widow of Sir Paolo Parisio G.C.M.G. They lived in the magnificent Palazzo Parisio in <a href="../../../v/a/l/Valletta.html" title="Valletta">Valletta</a> where Napoleon had chosen to spend his days in Malta. It was he who presented the ‘Majmuna Stone’ (now in the Gozo Museumto the nation. Governor Reid historically appointed him first Maltese Captain Commandant of the Malta Militia. He died without legitimate heirs in <a href="../../../1/8/7/1870.html" title="1870">1870</a> and was succeeded by his sister.</p>

<p>Francesca, the 5th Baroness of Budach, was a spinster. She received an inheritance from her brother and died seven years later in <a href="../../../1/8/7/1877.html" title="1877">1877</a>. She attempted to leave her title and estates to the Bishop of Gozo but was succeeded by Giuseppe de Piro, following a successful claim in the courts.
