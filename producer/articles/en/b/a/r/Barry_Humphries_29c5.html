<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/r/Barry_Humphries_29c5.html" title="Edit section: Early life">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Early life</span></h2>
<p>Barry Humphries was born in the <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melbourne.html" title="Melbourne">Melbourne</a> suburb <a href="../../../k/e/w/Kew%2C_Victoria_d296.html" title="Kew, Victoria">Kew</a> in <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victoria_%28Australia%29_71e6.html" title="Victoria (Australia)">Victoria</a>, <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australia</a>. His father was a well-to-do construction manager and Barry grew up in a "clean, tasteful and modern home" in <a href="../../../c/a/m/Camberwell.html" title="Camberwell">Camberwell</a>, then one of Melbourne’s new ‘garden suburbs’. His early home life set the pattern for his eventual stage career -- Barry's parents bought him everything he wanted, but his father in particular spent little time with him, so he spent hours playing dress-ups in the back garden.</p>
<dl>
<dd>"Disguising myself as different characters and I had a whole box of dressing up clothes ... Red Indian, sailor suit, Chinese costume and I was very spoiled in that way ... I also found that entertaining people gave me a great feeling of release, making people laugh was a very good way of befriending them. People couldn't hit you could they if they were laughing."</dd>
</dl>
<p>His parents nicknamed him 'Sunny Sam', and his early childhood was happy and uneventful, but in his teens Barry began to rebel against the strictures of conventional suburban life by becoming 'artistic' – much to the dismay of his parents who, despite their affluence, distrusted "art". A key event took place when he was nine -- his mother gave all his books to the <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salvation_Army_4c99.html" title="Salvation Army">Salvation Army</a>, cheerfully explaining: "But you've read them, Barry."</p>
<p>Humphries responded by becoming a voracious reader, a collector of rare books, a painter, a theatre fan and a surrealist. Dressing up in a black cloak, black homburg and mascara'd eyes, he invented his first sustained character, "Dr Aaron Azimuth", <a href="../../../d/a/n/Dandy.html" title="Dandy">dandy</a> and <a href="../../../d/a/d/Dadaist.html" title="Dadaist">Dadaist</a>.</p>
<p>Educated at <a href="../../../c/a/m/Camberwell_Grammar_School_8d68.html" title="Camberwell Grammar School">Camberwell Grammar School</a>, he has been awarded his place in the Gallery of Achievement there. His father’s building business prospered, and Barry was sent to <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melbourne_Grammar_School_f74f.html" title="Melbourne Grammar School">Melbourne Grammar School</a>, where he spurned sport, detested mathematics, shirked cadets "on the basis of conscientious objection" and matriculated with brilliant results in English and Art.</p>
<p>He spent two years studying at <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melbourne_University_559c.html" title="Melbourne University">Melbourne University</a> (<a href="../../../q/u/e/Queen%27s_College_%28University_of_Melbourne%29_00fe.html" title="Queen's College (University of Melbourne)">Queen's College</a>), where he studied <a href="../../../l/a/w/Law.html" title="Law">law</a>, <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philosophy.html" title="Philosophy">philosophy</a> and <a href="../../../f/i/n/Fine_arts.html" title="Fine arts">fine arts</a>. During this time he became Australia’s leading exponent of the deconstructive and absurd art movement, <a href="../../../d/a/d/Dada.html" title="Dada">Dada</a>. The Dadaist pranks and performances he mounted in Melbourne were experiments in anarchy and visual satire which have become part of Australian folklore. An exhibit entitled "Pus In Boots" consisted of a pair of <a href="../../../w/e/l/Wellington_boot.html" title="Wellington boot">Wellington boots</a> filled with custard; a mock pesticide product called "Platytox" claimed on its box to be effective against the <a href="../../../p/l/a/Platypus.html" title="Platypus">platypus</a>, a beloved and protected species in Australia.</p>
<p>He was also legendary for his provocative public pranks. One infamous example involved Humphries dressing as a Frenchman, with an accomplice dressed as a blind person; the accomplice would board a tram, followed soon after by Humphries. At the appropriate juncture, Humphries would force his way past the "blind" man, yelling "Get out of my way, you disgusting blind person", kicking him viciously in the shins and then jumping off the tram and making his escape in a waiting car.</p>
<p>An even more extreme example was his notorious "sick bag" prank. This involved carrying a tin of condensed soup onto an aircraft, which he would then surreptitiously empty into an air-sickness bag. At the appropriate point in the flight, he would pretend to vomit loudly and violently into the bag. Then, to the horror of passengers and crew, he would proceed to eat the contents. One <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_Fool%27s_Day_5641.html" title="April Fool's Day">April Fool's Day</a>, Humphries placed a roast dinner and glass of champagne in an inner-city <a href="../../../b/i/n/Bin.html" title="Bin">bin</a>. Later in the morning, when there were many businesspeople queuing at a nearby building, Humphries approached the group as a dirty, dishevelled man. He walked to the bin, opened the lid and proceeded to lift the roast and drink from it. Much to the amazement of watchers-by, he found a suitable seating area and began to eat it.</p>
<p>Such stunts were the early manifestations of a lifelong interest in the bizarre, discomforting and subversive.</p>
<p>He had written and performed songs and sketches in university revues, so after leaving university he joined the newly formed <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melbourne_Theatre_Company_4d0b.html" title="Melbourne Theatre Company">Melbourne Theatre Company</a>. It was at this point that he created the first incarnation of what became his best-known character, <a href="../../../d/a/m/Dame_Edna_Everage_255a.html" title="Dame Edna Everage">Edna Everage</a>. The first stage sketch featuring Mrs Norm Everage, called "Olympic Hostess", premiered at Melbourne University's Union Theatre on December 12, 1955. In his award-winning autobiography <i>More Please</i> (1992) Humphries relates that he created a character similar to Edna in the back of a bus while touring country Victoria in <i><a href="../../../t/w/e/Twelfth_Night_4e11.html" title="Twelfth Night">Twelfth Night</a></i> with the MTC at the age of twenty. The dowdy <a href="../../../m/o/o/Moonee_Ponds_19e3.html" title="Moonee Ponds">Moonee Ponds</a> housewife, originally created as a caricature of Australian suburban complacency and insularity, has evolved over four decades to become a satire of stardom, the gaudily dressed, acid-tongued, egomaniacal, internationally feted Housewife Gigastar, <a href="../../../d/a/m/Dame_Edna_Everage_255a.html" title="Dame Edna Everage">Dame Edna Everage</a>.</p>
<p>Humphries' other satirical characters include the legendary comic strip hero, nephew of Dame Edna (and progenitor of <a href="../../../c/r/o/Crocodile_Dundee_acb9.html" title="Crocodile Dundee">Crocodile Dundee</a>) <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barry_McKenzie_f6b3.html" title="Barry McKenzie">Barry McKenzie</a>; the "priapic and inebriated cultural attaché" <a href="../../../s/i/r/Sir_Les_Patterson_d74e.html" title="Sir Les Patterson">Sir Les Patterson</a>, who has "continued to bring worldwide discredit upon Australian arts and culture, while contributing as much to the Australian vernacular as he has borrowed from it"; gentle, grandfatherly "returned gentleman" Sandy Stone; iconoclastic '60s underground film-maker Martin Agrippa, <a href="../../../p/a/d/Paddington.html" title="Paddington">Paddington</a> <a href="../../../s/o/c/Socialist.html" title="Socialist">socialist</a> academic Neil Singleton, sleazy <a href="../../../t/r/a/Trade_union.html" title="Trade union">trade union</a> official Lance Boyle, high-pressure art salesman Morrie O’Connor and failed tycoon Owen Steele.</p>
<p>Humphries then moved to Sydney and joined Sydney's Philip Street Revue Theatre, Australia's leading venue for revue and satirical comedy. After a long season in revue, he appeared as <a href="../../../e/s/t/Estragon.html" title="Estragon">Estragon</a> in <i><a href="../../../w/a/i/Waiting_for_Godot_fef6.html" title="Waiting for Godot">Waiting for Godot</a></i>, Australia's first ever production of a <a href="../../../s/a/m/Samuel_Beckett_de21.html" title="Samuel Beckett">Samuel Beckett</a> play.</p>

<p>In 1959 he settled in <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a> where he lived and worked throughout the Sixties. He became friends with leading members of the British comedy scene including <a href="../../../d/u/d/Dudley_Moore_8dbd.html" title="Dudley Moore">Dudley Moore</a>, <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Cook_1071.html" title="Peter Cook">Peter Cook</a>, <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alan_Bennett_1b29.html" title="Alan Bennett">Alan Bennett</a>, <a href="../../../j/o/n/Jonathan_Miller_3c6d.html" title="Jonathan Miller">Jonathan Miller</a>, <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spike_Milligan_c14a.html" title="Spike Milligan">Spike Milligan</a>, <a href="../../../d/i/c/Dick_Bentley_e81e.html" title="Dick Bentley">Dick Bentley</a>, <a href="../../../w/i/l/Willie_Rushton_e56f.html" title="Willie Rushton">Willie Rushton</a> and fellow Australian expatriate comedian-actor <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Bluthal_0819.html" title="John Bluthal">John Bluthal</a>. Humphries performed at Cook's comedy venue <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Establishment_%28club%29_d158.html" title="The Establishment (club)">The Establishment</a>, where he also became friends with and was photographed by leading photographer <a href="../../../l/e/w/Lewis_Morley_f99f.html" title="Lewis Morley">Lewis Morley</a>, whose studio was located above the club. He contributed to the satirical magazine <i><a href="../../../p/r/i/Private_Eye_4f62.html" title="Private Eye">Private Eye</a></i>, of which Cook was publisher, his best-known work being the cartoon strip <i>The Wonderful World of Barry McKenzie</i>. The bawdy cartoon satire of the worst aspects of Australians abroad was written by Humphries and drawn by <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Zealand_2311.html" title="New Zealand">New Zealand</a> born cartoonist Nicholas Garland. The book version of the comic strip, published in the late' 60s, was for some time banned in Australia.</p>
<p>Humphries appeared in numerous West End stage productions including the musicals <i><a href="../../../o/l/i/Oliver%21.html" title="Oliver!">Oliver!</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../m/a/g/Maggie_May_850a.html" title="Maggie May">Maggie May</a></i>, by <a href="../../../l/i/o/Lionel_Bart_12f2.html" title="Lionel Bart">Lionel Bart</a>, and stage and radio productions by his friend Spike Milligan, in particular <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Bed_Sitting_Room_dd26.html" title="The Bed Sitting Room">The Bed Sitting Room</a></i>.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/6/1962.html" title="1962">1962</a> when Humphries was in <a href="../../../c/o/r/Cornwall.html" title="Cornwall">Cornwall</a> with his wife, he fell over a cliff near <a href="../../../z/e/n/Zennor.html" title="Zennor">Zennor</a> and landed on a ledge 150ft below, breaking various bones. The rescue by helicopter was filmed by a news crew from <a href="../../../i/t/n/ITN_c367.html" title="ITN">ITN</a>. The footage of the rescue were shown to Humphries for the first time on a 2006 <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_a61d.html" title="BBC">BBC</a> show - <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turn_Back_Time_%28TV%29_1d7f.html" title="Turn Back Time (TV)">Turn Back Time</a>.</p>
<p>Humphries' first major break on the British stage came when he was cast in the role of the undertaker Mr Sowerberry for the original 1960 London stage production of <i>Oliver!</i> He recorded Sowerberry's feature number "That's Your Funeral" for the original London cast soundtrack album (released on <a href="../../../d/e/r/Deram.html" title="Deram">Deram</a>) and reprised the role when the production moved to <a href="../../../b/r/o/Broadway_theatre.html" title="Broadway theatre">Broadway</a> in 1963, where it became the first London stage musical to be transplanted to Broadway and receive the same critical and audience reception it had received in Britain. In 1967 he starred as <a href="../../../f/a/g/Fagin.html" title="Fagin">Fagin</a> in the <a href="../../../p/i/c/Piccadilly_Theatre_c58f.html" title="Piccadilly Theatre">Piccadilly Theatre</a>'s revival of <i>Oliver!</i> which featured a young <a href="../../../p/h/i/Phil_Collins_af82.html" title="Phil Collins">Phil Collins</a> as <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Artful_Dodger_b978.html" title="The Artful Dodger">The Artful Dodger</a>. In 1997 Barry reprised the role of Fagin in <a href="../../../c/a/m/Cameron_Mackintosh_9bb7.html" title="Cameron Mackintosh">Cameron Mackintosh</a>'s award winning revival at the <a href="../../../l/o/n/London_Palladium_bcd9.html" title="London Palladium">London Palladium</a>.</p>
<p>In 1967 his friendship with Cook and Moore led to his first film role, a cameo as "Envy" in the hit film <i><a href="../../../b/e/d/Bedazzled_%281967_movie%29.html" title="Bedazzled (1967 movie)">Bedazzled</a></i> starring Cook and Moore with <a href="../../../e/l/e/Eleanor_Bron_92f9.html" title="Eleanor Bron">Eleanor Bron</a>, and directed by <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stanley_Donen_7d58.html" title="Stanley Donen">Stanley Donen</a>. The following year he appeared in <i>The Bliss Of Mrs Blossom</i> with <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shirley_MacLaine_0c3e.html" title="Shirley MacLaine">Shirley MacLaine</a>.</p>
<p>In the late '60s Humphries contributed to <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC-TV_2f5e.html" title="BBC-TV">BBC-TV</a>'s popular <i>The Late Show</i> (which also featured <a href="../../../o/z/_/Oz_magazine.html" title="Oz magazine">Oz magazine</a> editor <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Neville_1afe.html" title="Richard Neville">Richard Neville</a>) but Humphries found his true calling with his one-man satirical stage revues, in which he performed as Edna Everage and other character creations including <a href="../../../s/i/r/Sir_Les_Patterson_d74e.html" title="Sir Les Patterson">Les Patterson</a> and Sandy Stone. "A Nice Night's Entertainment" (1962) was the first such review. It and "Excuse I: Another Nice Night's Entertainment" (1965) were only performed in Australia. In 1968 Humphries returned to Australia to tour his one-man revue <i>Just A Show</i>; this production transferred to London's <a href="../../../f/o/r/Fortune_Theatre_2bee.html" title="Fortune Theatre">Fortune Theatre</a> in 1969. Humphries' gained considerable notoriety with "Just A Show". It polarized British critics but was successful enough to lead to a short-lived BBC television series <i>The Barry Humphries Scandals</i>, one of the precursors to the <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monty_Python_f0e0.html" title="Monty Python">Monty Python</a> series.</p>

<p>In 1970 Humphries returned to Australia, where Edna Everage made her movie debut in John B. Murray's <b>The Naked Bunyip</b>. In 1971-72 he teamed up with producer <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philip_Adams_d446.html" title="Philip Adams">Philip Adams</a> and writer-director <a href="../../../b/r/u/Bruce_Beresford_1030.html" title="Bruce Beresford">Bruce Beresford</a> to create a film version of the Barry McKenzie cartoons. <b>The Adventures of Barry MacKenzie</b> starred singer <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barry_Crocker_6f86.html" title="Barry Crocker">Barry Crocker</a> in the title role and featured Humphries — who co-wrote the script with Beresford — playing three different parts.</p>
<p>It was filmed in <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a> and <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australia</a> with an all-star cast including Spike Milligan, Peter Cook, <a href="../../../d/e/n/Dennis_Price_60de.html" title="Dennis Price">Dennis Price</a>, <a href="../../../d/i/c/Dick_Bentley_e81e.html" title="Dick Bentley">Dick Bentley</a>, Willie Rushton, <a href="../../../j/u/l/Julie_Covington_b14e.html" title="Julie Covington">Julie Covington</a>, <a href="../../../c/l/i/Clive_James_31fd.html" title="Clive James">Clive James</a> and broadcaster <a href="../../../j/o/a/Joan_Bakewell_d84f.html" title="Joan Bakewell">Joan Bakewell</a>. Like several other films of the time which have since been categorised as belonging to the <a href="../../../o/c/k/Ocker.html" title="Ocker">Ocker</a> genre of Australian film, it was almost unanimously panned by Australian film critics, but became a huge hit with audiences. In fact, the film became the most successful locally-made feature ever released in Australia up to that time, paving the way for the success of subsequent locally made feature films like <i><a href="../../../a/l/v/Alvin_Purple_e64f.html" title="Alvin Purple">Alvin Purple</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../p/i/c/Picnic_at_Hanging_Rock_0dc9.html" title="Picnic at Hanging Rock">Picnic at Hanging Rock</a></i>.</p>
<p>Although his career was blossoming, throughout his sojourn in London Humphries had become increasingly dependent on alcohol and by the late Sixties his friends and family began to fear that his addiction might cost him his career and possibly even his life. It was undoubtedly one of the main reasons for the failure of his marriage, and his drinking was also a contributing factor to the collapse of his second.</p>
<p>His drinking reached crisis point during a visit home in the early Seventies — his parents finally had him admitted to a private hospital to 'dry out' when, after a particularly heavy binge, he was found unconscious in a gutter. Since then he has abstained from alcohol completely and was one of the many friends who tried vainly to help <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Cook_1071.html" title="Peter Cook">Peter Cook</a>, who eventually died from alcohol-related illnesses. It has been speculated that the excesses of the perpetually drunk <a href="../../../s/i/r/Sir_Les_Patterson_d74e.html" title="Sir Les Patterson">Sir Les Patterson</a> are to some extent informed by Humphries' own battles with the bottle. This brush with mortality may account for his enduring fascination with <a href="../../../c/r/y/Cryonics.html" title="Cryonics">Cryonics</a>, the practice of human cryopreservation. Humphries only makes occasional self-reflexive references to this interest: "why would I want to go on living in the future after dressing up as a woman for fifty-two years"? However, members of the immortalist community have credited the momentum behind a planned Australian facility to his strong private support.</p>

<p>Since the late '60s Humphries has appeared in numerous films, mostly in supporting or cameo roles. His credits include the UK sex comedy <i><a href="../../../p/e/r/Percy%27s_Progress_da48.html" title="Percy's Progress">Percy's Progress</a></i> (1974), David Baker's <i>The Great McCarthy</i> and Bruce Beresford's <i>Barry MacKenzie Holds his Own</i> (1974) -- in which Edna was made a Dame by then Australian PM <a href="../../../g/o/u/Gough_Whitlam_3876.html" title="Gough Whitlam">Gough Whitlam</a>.</p>
<p>Other film credits include <i>Side By Side</i> (1975) and <i>The Getting Of Widsom</i> (1977). The same year, he had a cameo as Edna in the <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Stigwood_2bb3.html" title="Robert Stigwood">Robert Stigwood</a> musical film <i>Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band</i> (which became infamous as one of the biggest film flops of the decade), followed in 1981 by his part as the fake-blind TV-show host Bert Schnick in <i><a href="../../../s/h/o/Shock_Treatment_bd51.html" title="Shock Treatment">Shock Treatment</a></i>, the unsuccessful sequel to <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Rocky_Horror_Picture_Show_04d4.html" title="The Rocky Horror Picture Show">The Rocky Horror Picture Show</a></i>.</p>
<p>He was more successful with his featured role as Richard Deane in <i>Dr Fischer of Geneva</i> (1985); this was followed by <i>The Howling III</i> (1987), a cameo as <a href="../../../r/u/p/Rupert_Murdoch_2da1.html" title="Rupert Murdoch">Rupert Murdoch</a> in the miniseries <i>Selling Hitler</i> (1991) with <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexei_Sayle_b296.html" title="Alexei Sayle">Alexei Sayle</a>, a three-role cameo in Phillipe Mora's horror satire <i>Pterodactyl Woman From Beverly Hills</i> (1994), the role of Count Metternich in <i><a href="../../../i/m/m/Immortal_Beloved_%28film%29_248d.html" title="Immortal Beloved (film)">Immortal Beloved</a></i> (1994), as well as roles in <i>The Leading Man</i> (1996), the <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spice_Girls_4805.html" title="Spice Girls">Spice Girls</a>' film <i><a href="../../../s/p/i/Spiceworld_%28film%29.html" title="Spiceworld (film)">Spiceworld</a></i>, the Australian feature <i>Welcome To Woop Woop</i> (1997) and most recently <i>Nicholas Nickelby</i> (2002).</p>
<p>Barry has also featured in various roles in comedy performance films including <i>The Secret Policeman's' Other Ball</i> (1982) and <i>A Night of Comic Relief 2</i> (1989). In 1987 he starred as Les Patterson in one of his own rare flops, the disastrous <i><a href="../../../l/e/s/Les_Patterson_Saves_the_World_8840.html" title="Les Patterson Saves the World">Les Patterson Saves the World</a></i>, directed by <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_T._Miller_4075.html" title="George T.

<p>In 2003 Humphries had a small role in the animated film <a href="../../../f/i/n/Finding_Nemo_ebf1.html" title="Finding Nemo">Finding Nemo</a>. In it he plays a shark who attempts to curb his addiction to fish eating. He eventually falls off the wagon. Playing this role, given his own struggles with <a href="../../../a/l/c/Alcoholism.html" title="Alcoholism">alcoholism</a>, is perhaps a good example of Humphries' penchant for self-deprecation.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/r/Barry_Humphries_29c5.html" title="Edit section: One-man shows">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">One-man shows</span></h2>
<p>Humphries' forte has always been his one-man satirical stage revues, in which he appears as Edna Everage and a host of other character creations, including Les Patterson and Sandy Stone. There can be few (if any) comedians who can boast the career longevity he has enjoyed with Dame Edna, whose popularity shows no signs of flagging after more than forty years. Humphries' success is also a tribute to the tremendous skill, style and insight — and the sheer hard work — that he invests in performing two-and-a-half hour shows of entirely original material, laced with ad-libbing, improvisation and audience participation segments.</p>
<p>Humphries has had many successful stage productions in London, most of which he subsequently toured internationally. Despite his later popularity, he encountered stiff resistance in the early years of his career — his first London one-man show <i>A Nice Night's Entertainment</i> (1962) received scathing reviews and it was several years before he made a second attempt. He gained considerable notoriety with his next one-man revue <i>Just A Show</i>, staged at London's <a href="../../../f/o/r/Fortune_Theatre_2bee.html" title="Fortune Theatre">Fortune Theatre</a> in 1969. It polarized the critics but was a hit with audiences and became the basis of a growing cult following in the UK. He continued to gain popularity with his early '70s shows including <i>A Load Of Olde Stuffe</i> (1971) and <i>At Least You Can Say You've Seen It</i> (1974-75).</p>
<p>He finally broke through to widespread critical and audience acclaim in Britain with his 1976 London production <i>Housewife, Superstar!</i> at the <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apollo_Theatre_bd7b.html" title="Apollo Theatre">Apollo Theatre</a>. Its success in Britain and Australia led Humphries to try his luck with the show in New York in 1977, but it proved to be a disastrous repeat of his experience with <i>Just A Show</i>. Humphries later summed up his negative reception by saying: "When the <i><a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Times_d49e.html" title="New York Times">New York Times</a></i> tells you to close, you close."</p>
<p>His next show was <i>Isn't It Pathetic At His Age</i> (1978). Like many of his shows, the title quotes one of the remarks his mother often made when she took Barry to the theatre to see superannuated overseas actors touring in Australia during his youth.</p>
<p>His subsequent one-man shows include:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>A Night With Dame Edna</i> (1979), which won the Society of West End Theatres Award</li>
<li><i>An Evening's Intercourse With Dame Edna</i> (1982)</li>
<li>Three seasons of <i>Back with a Vengeance</i> (1987-1988, 2005-2007)</li>
<li><i>Look at Me When I'm Talking to You</i> (1996)</li>
<li><i>Edna, The Spectacle</i> (1998) at the <a href="../../../h/a/y/Haymarket_Theatre_8c69.html" title="Haymarket Theatre">Theatre Royal Haymarket</a>, where he holds the record as the only solo act to fill the theatre since it opened in 1663</li>
<li><i>Remember You're Out</i> which toured Australia in 1999.</li>
</ul>
<p>He has made numerous theatrical tours in <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germany.html" title="Germany">Germany</a>, <a href="../../../s/c/a/Scandinavia.html" title="Scandinavia">Scandinavia</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Netherlands_cf8a.html" title="The Netherlands">the Netherlands</a>, and in the Far and Middle East.

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/r/Barry_Humphries_29c5.html" title="Edit section: Dame Edna">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Dame Edna</span></h2>
<p><i>Main article: <a href="../../../d/a/m/Dame_Edna_Everage_255a.html" title="Dame Edna Everage">Dame Edna Everage</a></i></p>
<p>Edna Everage is undoubtedly one of the most enduring Australian comic characters of all time, and one of the longest-lived comedic characterisations ever devised. Originally conceived in the late 1950s, Edna has long since transcended her modest origins as a <a href="../../../s/a/t/Satire.html" title="Satire">satire</a> of Australian <a href="../../../s/u/b/Suburbia.html" title="Suburbia">suburbia</a> to become one of the most successful, best-known and best loved comedy characters of all time. She has grown over the years to become, in the words of journalist Caroline Overington:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"... a perfect parody of a modern, vainglorious celebrity with a rampant ego and a strong aversion to the audience (whom celebrities pretend to love but actually, as Edna so boldly makes transparent, they actually loathe for their cheap shoes and suburban values).<br />
(<i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Sydney_Morning_Herald_4298.html" title="The Sydney Morning Herald">The Sydney Morning Herald</a></i>)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Like her ever-present bunches of <a href="../../../g/l/a/Gladioli.html" title="Gladioli">gladioli</a>, one of the most popular and distinctive features of Edna's stage and TV appearances has been her extravagant wardrobe, with gaudy, custom-made gowns that satirically outdo the most outrageous creations of Hollywood showbiz designers such as <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Mackie_aaf2.html" title="Bob Mackie">Bob Mackie</a>. Her costumes, most of which were created for her by Australian designer <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Goodwin_3af8.html" title="Bill Goodwin">Bill Goodwin</a>, routinely incorporate Aussie <a href="../../../k/i/t/Kitsch.html" title="Kitsch">kitsch</a> icons such as the flag, Australian native animals and flowers, the <a href="../../../s/y/d/Sydney_Opera_House_ea14.html" title="Sydney Opera House">Sydney Opera House</a> and the boxing <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kangaroo.html" title="Kangaroo">kangaroo</a>.</p>
<p>As the character evolved, Edna's always unseen family became an integral part of the satire, particularly the travails of her invalid husband Norm, who suffered from an almost lifelong onslaught of an unspecified <a href="../../../p/r/o/Prostate.html" title="Prostate">prostate</a> ailment. Her daughter Valmai and her gay, hairdresser son Kenny also became intrinsic elements of the act, as did her long-suffering best friend and New Zealand bridesmaid, Madge Allsop.</p>
<p>Throughout Edna's career, Madge has been played by English actress <a href="../../../e/m/i/Emily_Perry_%28English_actress%29_a19c.html" title="Emily Perry (English actress)">Emily Perry</a> (born in 1907), who has the distinction of being the only other actor ever to appear on stage with Humphries in his stage shows, as well as making regular appearances in Dame Edna's TV programs.</p>
<p>Dame Edna is also notable as one of the few satirical characters to make a successful transition from stage to TV without losing popularity in either genre, and her decades-long popularity shows no signs of waning. The talk show format provided a perfect outlet for Humphries' rapier wit and his legendary ability to ad-lib, and it enabled Edna to draw on a wide and appreciative pool of fans among fellow actors and comedians, with scores of top-rank stars lining up to be lampooned on her shows. As other Australian actors have begun to make a wider impression in international film and television, Edna has not hesitated to reveal that it was her mentorship which helped "kiddies" like "little <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nicole_Kidman_310b.html" title="Nicole Kidman">Nicole Kidman</a>" to achieve their early success.</p>

In the UK he made two highly successful series of his talk show <b><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Dame_Edna_Experience_69ad.html" title="The Dame Edna Experience">The Dame Edna Experience</a></b> for <a href="../../../l/o/n/London_Weekend_Television_7f3c.html" title="London Weekend Television">London Weekend Television</a>.

<p>These enormously popular programs have since been repeated worldwide and the special <b>A Night On Mount Edna</b> won Humphries the <b>Golden Rose of Montreux</b> in 1991. He wrote and starred in <a href="../../../a/b/c/ABC-TV_133e.html" title="ABC-TV">ABC-TV</a>'s <b>The Life And Death Of Sandy Stone</b> (1991), and presented the ABC social history series <b>Barry Humphries' Flashbacks</b> (1999).</p>

<p>Barry Humphries finally realised his long-delayed dream of success in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> when he took <i>Dame Edna - The Royal Tour</i> to Broadway in 2000, scoring a smash hit and winning rave reviews. As a result Humphries won the inaugural 'Special Tony Award for a Live Theatrical Event' in 2000 and two National Broadway Theatre Awards for "Best Play" and for "Best Actor" in 2001. Asked what it was like to win a <a href="../../../t/o/n/Tony_Award_ddaa.html" title="Tony Award">Tony</a> award by an Australian journalist he said " it was like winning 1000 Gold <a href="../../../l/o/g/Logies.html" title="Logies">Logies</a> at the same time".</p>
<p>Edna's new-found success in America led to many media opportunities, including a semi-regular role in the hit TV series <i><a href="../../../a/l/l/Ally_McBeal_40ca.html" title="Ally McBeal">Ally McBeal</a></i>. <i><a href="../../../v/a/n/Vanity_Fair_%28magazine%29_3c10.html" title="Vanity Fair (magazine)">Vanity Fair</a></i> magazine then invited Dame Edna to write a satirical advice column but she unwittingly created a storm of controversy with a piece published in the February 2003 issue. Replying to a reader who asked if she should learn <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spanish_language.html" title="Spanish language">Spanish</a>, she replied:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"Forget Spanish. There's nothing in that language worth reading except <a href="../../../d/o/n/Don_Quixote_1079.html" title="Don Quixote">Don Quixote</a>, and a quick listen to the <a href="../../../c/d/_/CD_4170.html" title="CD">CD</a> of <i><a href="../../../m/a/n/Man_of_La_Mancha_6355.html" title="Man of La Mancha">Man of La Mancha</a></i> will take care of that ... Who speaks it that you are really desperate to talk to? The help? Your leaf blower?"</dd>
</dl>
<p>Edna's satirical intent -- poking fun at the haughty attitudes of wealthy Americans who hire low-waged <a href="../../../h/i/s/Hispanic.html" title="Hispanic">Hispanic</a> domestic workers -- evidently went over the heads of some readers. Many who subsequently complained appeared not to realise that Dame Edna was merely a character and that 'she' was not really a woman. Members of the Hispanic community took the joke out of context, reading it as a deliberately racist remark, and complaints flooded in to the magazine. Hollywood actress <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salma_Hayek_22d3.html" title="Salma Hayek">Salma Hayek</a> responded angrily, penning a furious letter in which she denounced Dame Edna. Death threats were even received and <i>Vanity Fair</i> was eventually forced to publish a full-page apology to the Hispanic community.</p>
<p>Humphries commented later. "If you have to explain satire to someone, you might as well give up." When questioned about the controversy (as Dame Edna) on the eve of her 2003 Australian tour, she retorted that Hayek's denunciation was due to "professional jealousy", and that Hayek was envious because the role of painter <a href="../../../f/r/i/Frida_Kahlo_11d6.html" title="Frida Kahlo">Frida Kahlo</a> (for which Hayek received an Oscar nomination) had originally been offered to Edna:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"When I was offered the part of Frida I turned it down, and she was the second choice. I said 'I'm not playing the role of a woman with a moustache and a monobrow, and I'm not having same-sex relations on the screen' ... I'm not racist. I love all races, particularly white people. You know, I even like <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Catholic_3b40.html" title="Roman Catholic">Roman Catholics</a>."</dd>
