<p>somebody needs to change the main image. it only shows Impulse (Bart) in the water, but focuses on Kid Flash (Wally!).</p>
<p>this is made obvious by the wrong eye-color (Bart seldom suffers the wrong eyes syndrom and does have his trademark golden eyes in the Impulse half) and by huge differences between Wally's and Bart's Kid Flash uniform. Bart modified it with lotsa little details, especially the boots.</p>
<p>I guess it's a cover from the Sins of Youth arc.</p>
<p>I'd change it myself, but I don't have any fitting images at hand.</p>
<p>Twincast</p>
<dl>
<dd>I also think the image stands to be changed, though considering the rumors that Bart may be the star of the upcoming <i>Flash</i> series, I think we could stand to wait until we have confirmation that he either is or is not the new Flash. If he is not, I think we should either go back to the previous KF/Imp image or find one of just Kid Flash. A separate image of Impulse could probably be better. <a href="../../../k/r/a/User%7EKramarDanIkabu_e98b.html" title="User:KramarDanIkabu">KramarDanIkabu</a> 03:42, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>We already have a picture of the Impulse comic. Now, if there's a better image we can use, i say we use it. What's the point of waiting? (Especially if the image we're currently using is displaying the wrong flipping character) <a href="../../../a/c/e/User%7EAce_Class_Shadow_f213.html" title="User:Ace Class Shadow">Ace Class Shadow</a> 06:15, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The cover is from "World Without a Young Justice", and it <i>is</i> supposed to be Bart (although, for reasons explained in the story, that <i>is</i> Wally's Kid Flash outfit he's wearing). You're right about the eye-colour being wrong. <a href="../../../d/a/i/User%7EDaibhid_C_8edb.html" title="User:Daibhid C">Daibhid C</a> 09:41, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Like the <a href="../../../s/u/p/Superboy_Prime_03d6.html" title="Superboy Prime">Superboy Prime</a> Action Figure showing him with his <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Monitor_603d.html" title="Anti-Monitor">Anti-Monitor</a> like armor before IC#5, the merchandising DC has likely spread a major spoiler on the final destiny of Bart Allen. Uncertain if put it on his own page, I leave here the link.</p>
<div class="notice spoiler" id="spoiler"><b><a href="../../../s/p/o/Wikipedia%7ESpoiler_warning_6b56.html" title="Wikipedia:Spoiler warning">Spoiler warning</a>: <i>Plot and/or ending details follow.</i></b></div>

<p>Before, when the Superboy Prime action figure blew up the suspance about him, a mention to him was immediately added to wikipedia. But in this case I suggest waiting at last the 3rd of May, when IC#7 is up, then decide to use or not this spoilerful information to put up a paragraph like the one in Superboy Page. DrTofu83 13:02, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yeah, well, spoilers are spoilers. Furst off, a warning on the talk page is a bit excessive. Second, it's a talk page, not an article. Third, let's take our cue from the <a href="../../../s/u/p/Superboy-Prime_c14b.html" title="Superboy-Prime">Superboy-Prime</a> article. Also, since this affects multiple articles, we'll have to edit them accordingly. Bart Allen is the new flash in his grandfather's suit. <a href="../../../a/c/e/User%7EAce_Class_Shadow_f213.html" title="User:Ace Class Shadow">The Anti-Gnome</a> 21:49, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The point of the Talk Page warning is that I wasn't, and still I'm not quite sure on the opportunity of the edit on the main article. Wikipedia usualy tolerates tagged spoiler. But this spoiler will last until the first number of the new series of Flash will came out. And we are talking of June. I'm wondering if there's a <i>Wikipedia official position</i> to refer DrTofu83 22:41, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I know, dude. I bet I seem like a maniac, huh? The thing is, Bart appeared in Barry's suit. It was right there the whole time. That mean the spoiler is comics canon from Infinite #5. Look at it like...smilex. Joker gas formula, that is. In the Tim Burton movie, it was combinations that were deadly, but multiple products were poisoned. This is the same thing. The games confirm what the comic already hinted at. It's genius, actually. <a href="../../../a/c/e/User%7EAce_Class_Shadow_f213.html" title="User:Ace Class Shadow">The Anti-Gnome</a> 23:03, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>there's lots of rumors pertaining to the new flash. didio said "the first flash you see will not be the last" or some such. speaking of which, i've read rumors that the flash who returned is indeed bart, but he used the last of his powers and "retired" as seen in teen titans one year later. so i think, in this case, it would be better to only reflect established fact and not get in the habbit of rumor mongering.</p>

<p>It is sad as Bart was one of those heroes created by DC in the '90s which had great hope as DC's future. <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conner_Kent_ff91.html" title="Conner Kent">Superboy</a> was one of them and now he is dead, though <a href="../../../t/i/m/Tim_Drake_eb7b.html" title="Tim Drake">Robin</a> is trying to re-clone him. Good luck with that. Now Bart is a man without powers. It is just ridiculous. He is DC's most youthful characther and a has a sort-of <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Pan_7c41.html" title="Peter Pan">Peter Pan</a> persona and now he ages. Hope in the <a href="../../../d/c/_/DC_Comics_9a75.html" title="DC Comics">DC Comics</a>'s <a href="../../../l/i/m/Limited_series.html" title="Limited series">limited series</a>'s <a href="../../../5/2/_/52_%28comics%29.html" title="52 (comics)">52</a> will explain what in the world has happened to Bart. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 208.181.90.67 (<a href="../../../2/0/8/User_talk%7E208.181.90.67.html" title="User talk:208.181.90.67">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_208.181.90.67_c93b.html" title="Special:Contributions/208.181.90.67">contribs</a>).</small></p>
<p>Well, technically, 52's meant to explain what happens directly after the crisis in the present/past. Bart, depowered, would be irrilation unless connected in some way to the new Flash set to appear. I'm not sure about Peter Pan. Bart's a time traveller, but he was aging and maturing naturally before the crisis. Also, with semi-capable Jay active and once again the fastest known speedster, it's likely he'll have more of a part in the new Flash's life. I'll say this, though: The decision to, basically, bitchslap Bart rather than give him the flash title was probably for the same reason Hal was turned into a headcase. Drama, and to introduce a new guy whilst making the old guy/candidate look seem incapable. Sometimes it's less respectful/honorable/logical than others. Look at <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catwoman.html" title="Catwoman">Catwoman</a>. Selina's a single mom. WTF?! <a href="../../../a/c/e/User%7EAce_Class_Shadow_f213.html" title="User:Ace Class Shadow">ACS (Wikipedian)</a> 20:35, 13 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Why has my entry for Bart's one year later keep getting removed? Everything I stated was CITED FROM PAGES OF INFINITE CRISIS #7 u see in that issue that he's been aged to an adult from taking super boy prime through the speed force to the future and that he has used the last of his powers when he returned and saved Wonder Girl from SBP.

<p>Now I know that the issue where Bart officially becomes the Flash will come out next week (<b>Flash: Fastest Man Alive</b> #2) and, in retrospect, I agree with <a href="../../../c/o/v/User%7ECovenantD_b5a4.html" title="User:CovenantD">CovenantD</a> on not posting spoilers in the SHB. However, 002KFlash052 changed the entry to reflect the spoiler again. My question is since the issue comes out next week (or, in some cases like the comic shop I get my books at, the preview that retailers got this week and sell to their customers) do we revert it back to Bart being a retired <b>Kid Flash</b> or just leave the update that reflects his adopting the Flash codename? Either way is fine with me. It would also be a good idea to set some sort of timeframe guideline where the SHB can get updated with info that some would consider spoilers (like if it's something that is pretty obvious, been talked about in various media, and within a few days of the issue's release)--<a href="../../../c/n/j/User%7ECnjartist_852e.html" title="User:Cnjartist">Cnjartist</a> 20:50, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The usual rule-of-thumb that those of us involved in the Comics Project have been using is to wait until something hits the stores to include it in the SHB or the lead section. In the body of the text is fine, as long as it's cited and has spoiler warnings. The reasoning is that not everybody reads the previews, the fan sites, etc., and we're shouldn't be putting information out there where it can't be avoided. <a href="../../../c/o/v/User%7ECovenantD_b5a4.html" title="User:CovenantD">CovenantD</a> 21:00, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hey. Back in 2004, Kyle Gallner's performance as Bart was being promoted as an appearance of "the Flash". Now, in 2006, Bart is the Flash. Shouldn't this be mentioned in the article? 172.191.146.152 23:50, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

We don't need to have a longwinded explanation of who else was in TT, becuase that sort of thing belongs on the TT page, not Bart's. We can change the TT link to point directly to the subsection if needed. Concerning his crush on Rose, I can't find ref of that anywhere by the Titans Tomorrow section.

<dd>It's barely a mention that he was in the Titans first of all. Second, fine, don't put the long winded stuff about the other members, but it's worth mentioning that he was in the Titans before, cause not many people know about that team, but it was an important part of his Impulse run that doesn't get much press..

<dd>So elaborate on his time as a Titan, rather than what the Titans were. "While Bart was a member of the Titans he..." I don't have those issues, so I can't speak for it myself, but there has to be more to it than 'Bart was on the titans, had a crush on Ravager.'

<p>Well, see, it makes a good deal of sense to write about exactly what the teen titans were for an impulse site, merely due to the fact that over time his initial stretch with that team has become insignificant enough as one could follow Bart and not follow the team (unlike Young Justice). And his initial stretch was essentially that small, given how he was only part of the team during the "rebel years". That last part came from what pretty much acted as the original "titan's tower" keeffee.com, which was closed down around 3 years or so ago. Connerjade 07:06, 13 January 2007 (UTC)connerjade</p>

<p>Why is Bart listed under the "Fictional mechanics" category? Wally West worked as a mechanic during the second half of Geoff Johns' run, but the closest I can think of to Bart working as a mechanic is his job at Keystone Motors. For all we've seen of it, it may have involved standing next to a machine and pressing buttons once in a while. (Rather likely, considering all the complaints about automation at the beginning of the story.) I can't remember him showing any interest in it as a hobby, either. --<a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKelson_Vibber_5872.html" title="User:Kelson Vibber">Kelson</a> 21:29, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
