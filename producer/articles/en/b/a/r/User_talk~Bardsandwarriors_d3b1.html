<p>Hello. You're right, it isn't awful for a first draft. But first drafts require cleanup, that's why they're not final drafts. When I said it desperately required cleanup, I didn't mean to insult your contribution, and I'm sorry if it looked that way. It's just got a long way to go before it meets our standards. Cheers. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThesocialistesq_d715.html" title="User:Thesocialistesq">-- Thesocialistesq/M.Lesocialiste</a> 19:16, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Bards: Thanks for the note! I did add a couple of images of male skirts that I have designed and constructed. I will be adding more as I make more skirts. --<a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllyn_59b4.html" title="User:Allyn">Allyn</a> 23:32, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks very much, Mark! Your outlandish sense of style is great&#160;:) I've replied on <a href="../../../m/e/n/Talk%7EMen_in_Skirts_88b8.html" title="Talk:Men in Skirts">Talk:Men in Skirts</a> aswell.

<p>Just to let you know, some anonymous user took out both of my pictures, saying in the summary line that they were not appropriate for men's skirts, or something like that. I re-inserted the pictures. I feel that as I have seen men wear skirts like the ones that I made; as well as having sold several of these skirts to men who wear them in public; that they are appropriate. --<a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllyn_59b4.html" title="User:Allyn">Allyn</a> 05:42, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks Mark, well done&#160;;) It seems that <a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_Brenneman_d498.html" title="User:Aaron Brenneman">User:Aaron_Brenneman</a> (an admin) thinks he is god, and can change whatever he pleases, on subjects he knows nothing about, without any consultation. His ruthlessness makes me suspect a POVPush (ie. pushing his own point of view, antipathetic to the movement; wikipedia should be neutral). I have also restored the list of external links that he deleted, and left a message on his talk page to get the name of the article changed back. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBardsandwarriors_abab.html" title="User:Bardsandwarriors">Bards</a> 06:06, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I do need to mention, Bard, that the edit to remove my pictures was from an anonymous user (an IP address). I don't know if it was Aaron, using a public terminal such as an Icafe, or someone else. No one left me anything in my talk page, nor the talk page for the article. From you experience, if Aaron makes a change, does he usually leave a comment in your talk page or the talk page of the article? --<a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllyn_59b4.html" title="User:Allyn">Allyn</a> 13:34, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If you look at the history page - here <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Men_in_skirts&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Men_in_skirts&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> - you will see a flurry of 4 edits (after along break with no editing) - 2 with an anonymous IP, followed by 2 signed by Aaron. I haven't encountered Aaron before. But this is very likely the same person, as it follows a pattern: he makes some edits, then realises he isn't logged in, then logs in to finish his work. There is nothing wrong with that. But his reasons for removing the pictures make no rational sense to me, and his other edits don't either. On a debatable issue, he should have opened it for discussion on the talk page. Taking high-handed unilateral decisions, on things that are debatable, strongly suggest he is not doing it for rational reasons. We will have to see if he replies. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBardsandwarriors_abab.html" title="User:Bardsandwarriors">Bards</a> 21:17, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Bards:</p>
<p>Thank you for restoring my skirt pictures. I did some checking and found that it was a different IP address that removed them this time. I went ahead and left a note in the talk page for each of the two IP addresses to please do not remove my pictures unless you leave a note in the talk page for the article or my own talk page. Nothing has been left. I will assume these removals as vandalism.</p>
<p>By the way, both of the IP addresses are housed in Great Brittan, but they are of different ISP's.</p>

<dd>No problemo. Wikipedia is full of vandals. Most are harmless - schoolkids having a laugh, or people passing through and thinking they know better. But some are jerks with issues, eg. you might find some christians or moslems objecting to your style on religious grounds. Also small-minded people with similar issues, who think it is 'perverted' or some old rubbish. Pushing points of view like that are strictly not allowed in wikipedia, but it happens. Best thing is to just revert the changes (look at history page; hit 'diff' to compare pages; hit 'undo') and think no more of it! <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBardsandwarriors_abab.html" title="User:Bardsandwarriors">Bards</a> 07:52, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have no idea what you are talking about. I'm working on a project to populate the Arctic Ocean category, and I've been placing articles and categories in all of its subcategories, including the Arctic islands category. I've never spoken to you about this project, and didn't know until right now that you are working on a project that overlaps with mine. <a href="../../../c/r/k/User%7ECRKingston_5e4d.html" title="User:CRKingston">CRKingston</a> 01:11, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>You are right. I had the idea that you were someone else, and I don't know why I thought that. I will delete my question from your talk page if you like.01:34, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>But since we are introduced now - I have been working on cleaning up the 'islands' categories, and would appreciate a discussion on the best protocols for organising them. In Arctic Islands, for instance, I had got almost all articles categorised inside the subcats organised by archipelago, eg. article Franz Josef Land inside category Franz Josef Land. But many of your recent changes have placed the main article back outside aswell, eg. Franz Josef Land in both Franz Josef Land, and Arctic islands. Should I revert your edits in those cases, or edit them back, or do you have an interesting strategy that I should take note of? 01:34, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Sorry it has taken me so long to respond, I just found your note. First, I really like the Arctic Islands category, and other oceans have something similar (more like Islands of the xx ocean). Here is the strategy I have had in mind (which I might not have executed correctly). I was thinking that your islands category would have all of the islands (and island subsets like archipelago) for the entire ocean. You can break it out however you think is best. I saw the islands listed in two places, in the Arctic Islands cateogry, and in the specific sea category. A lot of them are the dividing line between seas, so they would be in both. If you create a category like DeLong Islands, it would be in the Arctic Ocean and the specific sea as well. Does this strategy make sense? I'm certainly open to discussing it. I think the inconsistencies you have found were from before, before I started creating the sea categories, I put everything into the Arctic Ocean category. Now, as I'm going through, I'm replacing the Arctic Ocean cat with a more specific sea cat. One other thing I've done that touches the islands, the island categories (like DeLong) I've started populating with other things like landforms, explorers, etc. that are beyond the scope of the ocean/sea categories. Let me know what you think, and again, sorry for the delayed response. <a href="../../../c/r/k/User%7ECRKingston_5e4d.html" title="User:CRKingston">CRKingston</a> 04:09, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for the reply. In my fervour to sort everything out, I may have been a bit hasty and/or over-assertive in places. I've fully read the wiki help articles on categories now, and the 'exceptions' to the parent-child non duplication rule are applicable. I need to put back some of my changes - under <a href="../../../c/a/t/Wikipedia%7ECategorization_and_subcategories_80b6.html#Incomplete_sets_of_subcategories" title="Wikipedia:Categorization and subcategories">the 'incomplete subsets' rule</a> - so that eg. Svalbard appears in both the category Svalbard and the category Artic Islands. This applies because not all islands can be classified into subcats for groups of islands, therefore all island main articles must also form a complete list within "Artic islands". Live and learn! With your agreement, I will sort them out. And thanks for the other comments, I agree with everything except putting islands into the Arctic Ocean - surely readers can follow the "Arctic islands" category link? <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBardsandwarriors_abab.html" title="User:Bardsandwarriors">Bards</a> 11:38, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>It all sounds good. I've not been clear about putting islands into the Arctic Ocean. I did that first, before I added the seas cats, and before you created the Arctic islands category. I agree with you completely that no island should appear in the Arctic Ocean category, and as I'm working through the seas (still not done), I'm replacing the Arctic ocean cat on the island article with the appropriate sea cat. You can do that replacement as well. I don't know if we have all of the sea cats created yet, so you may have to create a sea category to move an island from Arctic Ocean. <a href="../../../c/r/k/User%7ECRKingston_5e4d.html" title="User:CRKingston">CRKingston</a> 18:25, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I propose deleting <a href="../../../m/a/r/Category%7EMarginal_seas_of_the_Arctic_Ocean_b986.html" title="Category:Marginal seas of the Arctic Ocean">Category:Marginal seas of the Arctic Ocean</a>, and moving all seas into "Seas of the Arctic Ocean". Reason: currently the reader needs to look in 2 places instead of one, and may not think of looking 2 places; and I see no special reason to split them up. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBardsandwarriors_abab.html" title="User:Bardsandwarriors">Bards</a> 23:52, 6 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Marginal seas are a subset of seas, and the marginal seas category traces back to the Seas category and covers every ocean. Instead, let's put the marginal seas in both the marginal seas and the Seas of the Arctic Ocean category. This makes sense to me as being within the category guidelines. Agree? <a href="../../../c/r/k/User%7ECRKingston_5e4d.html" title="User:CRKingston">CRKingston</a> 00:47, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>If we make "Marginal Seas of..." into a subcat of "Seas of...", it wouldn't be necessary to duplicate the subcats; but we could still duplicate the articles to make a full list in each "Seas of..." category. Currently the other oceans are inconsistent: Atlantic has it that way; Pacific and Indian do not; Southern does neither, and has no Marginals cat. Note that "Marginal Seas" is a subcat of "Seas". However, I am straying onto your territory here (pun). <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBardsandwarriors_abab.html" title="User:Bardsandwarriors">Bards</a> 01:01, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello. Please, make sure your contributions are consistent. You created "Islands of Asia" cat but didn't include subcategories to it. I have now made it for you. - <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarwinek_e9a2.html" title="User:Darwinek">Darwinek</a> 11:11, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Darwinek - thank you. There already exists a primary classification of <a href="../../../i/s/l/Category%7EIslands_by_country_1cc7.html" title="Category:Islands by country">Category:Islands by country</a>, which contains lists of countries. I have been populating "Islands by continent" in a different way, although only tentatively, while wondering if it should be there at all. What are your thoughts? <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBardsandwarriors_abab.html" title="User:Bardsandwarriors">Bards</a> 11:36, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>As per our traditions here, all countries should be under each continent category, i.e. "islands of Italy" under "islands of Europe" etc. I have done it all yet. As for the Russian Lakes category now at CFD, relocate these articles as you suggested and I will then delete empty Russian Lakes category and close that CFD listing (I am an admin). - <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarwinek_e9a2.html" title="User:Darwinek">Darwinek</a> 12:04, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Agreed, Darwinek. You may notice I have made a vast number of changes to the categories for Islands, and I freely admit to making a few poor decisions amongst them, aiming to clear them up later.

<dd>"Islands by river" already existed when I tackled the Islands. However it seems reasonable to me. What are you concerns? Also: I disagree with speedy-rename of Category:Lands with Arctic islands.

<dd>I don't know how many yet, as many of the articles are still improperly classified. Maybe a few dozen? But there may be 100s or 1000s in the world which do not have articles yet. For consistency, I accept your implied argument: we should have "Islands in lakes" and "Islands in rivers". Or we should have "Islands by lake" and "Islands by river", with subcategories. I cannot decide which is better. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBardsandwarriors_abab.html" title="User:Bardsandwarriors">Bards</a> 13:18, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

I would strongly suggest discussing the organization first, rather than making changes with having a consensus on what the changes should be. We have not heard anything about your proposed changes here <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Indonesia_ceb6.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Indonesia">Wikipedia:WikiProject Indonesia</a>.
