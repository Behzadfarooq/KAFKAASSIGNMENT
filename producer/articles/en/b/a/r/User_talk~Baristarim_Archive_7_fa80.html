<p>Thanks for the encouragement! One section I would like to add to complete the package would be Politics. Except for my meetings with the mayor and once with the state appointed governor, I know little about local politics. Do you know of any sites that have election data or maps for the region? Preferably in English? Otherwise my only concern with the article is citation, since many observations are not verifiable. --Patrickneil 17:44, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Look up <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mushku" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mushku" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mushku</a> To find more about Phrygians and Mushku or Mushki(Mushkitsi) These are Georgian tribes, they have nothing to do with our history. We are never remembered by the name Phrygians, but yet we are rememberd by Nairi etc etc. Greeks say there is no link with Assyrians referring to Phyrgians as Mushki, yet Moshchoi which Greeks use is Georgian tribes. We have always called ourselves with the name Armen. The most common Armenian name. A nationality just doesnt forget its name, or change names sometime in their history, it doesnt work that way. <a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EArarat_arev_8df7.html" title="User:Ararat arev">Ararat arev</a> 18:28, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi. Since you were the first to welcome Greatmuslim I thought I'd let you know as a matter of courtesy that I've blocked him for 24 hours for repeatedly posting attack (and possibly libellous) stuff on <a href="../../../a/d/n/Adnan_Oktar_16ae.html" title="Adnan Oktar">Adnan Oktar</a> despite several warnings on his talkpage by yourself and others not to do so.

<p>Merhabalar. kusura bakma daha önce cevap veremedim. iki haftadır internete erişimim çok rahat değildi.</p>
<p>Turkey article'ının FA'sı için tebrikler! Gerçi çok takip edemedim gelişimini ama anladığım kadarıyla buna en büyük pay sana ait.</p>
<p>Armenian Genocide'ın talk'u da o gün bir anda alevlendi hakikaten. hala da sönmemiş anladığım kadarıyla&#160;:) Umarım kıvılcımı çakan ben olmamışımdır, zira tam aksiydi amacım. Ortamı biraz yumuşatabilirim sanmıştım ama sanırım kabul etmem lazım ki her iki tarafta da bu konu hakkında sabit fikirli olan çok. yine de bana yardımcı olduğun için (özellikle hukuk bilginle) çok teşekkür ediyorum.</p>
<p>Wikipedia'ya da yeni başladım evet ama henüz biraz pasif kalıp gözlemlemeyi tercih edeceğim. Sanırım işler ekşi sözlük'te alışık olduğum şekilde yürümüyor&#160;;) Bir de belki sonra Türkçesine katkı yapmayı da tercih edebilirim. zira galiba orada daha çok yardıma ihtiyaç var.</p>
<p>Sana da Türkiye hakkında yaptığın katkılar için gönüllerin barnstar'ını veriyorum&#160;:)O da şimdilik benim gibi bir çömez için gerçeğini vermek ne kadar doğru olurdu bilmediğimden&#160;:)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Response to question</span></h2>
<p>Basically, I should indicate that I am less interested in actually trying to collect trophies as I am in the possibility of seeing as many articles as possible assessed (which can pretty much be only done through projects) and in trying to help editors who might share similar interests to be able to work together in what is maybe a slightly broader number of articles than they might work on otherwise. Honestly, this could be done just as easily through work groups or tasks forces of other existing projects, as through separate groups. Also, having groups dedicated to given topics also at least potentially allows for greater opportunties for other functions, like peer review, collaboration, and even portals. Granted, the OO project could work just as well as a group within the existing Christianity project, and I personally would be more than amenable in seeing a work group/task force for Oriental Orthodoxy created within that project. Also, as the person who probably did the most to assemble the existing Project Directory, I am probably aware of more areas which are not covered by any existing project than others, and I would ultimately like to see every article we have have at least one project interested in it. I'm not sure if this answers your question, but it is the best answer I have. Thank you for your attention and your polite inquiry. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadbilltucker_7b20.html" title="User:Badbilltucker">Badbilltucker</a> 14:48, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hallo, my Source is nothing less than the commander of the police station of Fatih, located in Fevzi Pascia Caddesi. I have been robbed in the quarter - near Isa Feneri Camii - last week, on the second day of Bayram. The officer told me that they received me only because I am a foreigner. According to him, in the quarter live about 12,000 criminals (The process of recognizing someone by means of pictures of known criminals living in Fatih and archived on the police intranet lasted almost two hours...) . According to him the day before my aggression a couple (she was a foreign tourist, he was a turkish friend) has been attacked and robbed in the evening near Zeyrek Camii. The police officer concluded that he would never walk alone in the streets of the quarter at night. I wrote this remark just because I think that could be useful for other tourists that go to Fatih. Kind regards,</p>

<p>This is very true, but this wrestlying bears many similarities to greek wrestling practiced throughout byzantine times. Turks like to claim the cultural similarities between greeks and turks are due to turkish cultural assimalation of the greeks, however for the most part it is largely because of turkish appropriation of byzantine culture. i mean this in no offensive way, it is simply a statement of fact that the cultural similarities began not after 1453, but in 1071 after turks became more 'byzantinized' after capturing major anatolian seats of grecobyzantine culture.</p>
<dl>
<dd>There is certainly a synthesis of cultures, this is something that i have propounded, not ridiculed any nation for. The Romans made an art out of copying other cultures and it got them the greatest empire in world history. However, there seems to be a tendency among many nationalist turks to attribute anything that seems byzantine to a conjectural 'turkic' culture. The tanbur is clearly a mix of greek and persian stringed instruments for example, yet many turks claim that it existed prior to their invasions of persia and byzantium. &lt;small&gt;(<a href="../../../r/e/m/Wikipedia%7ERemove_personal_attacks_ff02.html" title="Wikipedia:Remove personal attacks">Personal attack removed</a>)&lt;/small&gt; regards. nikos.</dd>

<dd>Please read the articles closely and do not do blind reverts&#160;:) I put a lot of effort into finding sources and writing that article's intro. The ones that you called sourced information are not so actually. The other refs in the intro are actual books on architecture with visible pages. The ones provided by anon are one of them from a web forum, the other one from a book description - I read very carefully every source provided and write them carefully. If you have any other concerns about the specifics of the article, you can leave me a note. Ottoman architecture was influenced primarily by Byzantine architecture, and Mimar Sinan, originally a Orthodox convert to Islam made a great synthesis of the Islamic Mamluk and Byzantine styles. Seljuk styles was never predominant after the 14th century. In any case, the influence of Persian styles can be extensively talked about in the article of Seljuk architecture. If you ever come to Istanbul, you would see what I mean&#160;:) Cheers! <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaristarim_c144.html" title="User:Baristarim">Baristarim</a> 18:45, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Your argument makes no sense. Those are sources from BOOKS. See Wikipedia NPOV. You cannot decide what is and what is not a source. Those are from books too, I do not have to buy the book just so I can use it as a source. Both of those sources come from books. Would you like me to talk to admins about your POV push? Obviously, you cannot possible believe you can get away with dictating what a source is and what is as source is not, especially when you yourself say that books are sources.

<dd>Listen, did you even read what I just wrote above? Why are you insisting that Persian is placed in front of Byzantine? Do you have any idea what Ottoman architecture was? Have you ever seen Sinan's works? One of the source is from a forum, the other one is a book summary. This has nothing to do with NPOV, it has to do with academic correctness. Seljuk styles were influenced by Persian architecture, and Seljuk architecture was the basis for Ottoman architecture until 1453. What about 1453-1922? It was Byzantine and Mamluk influence (after the transfer of the Caliphate to Ottoman dynasty). <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaristarim_c144.html" title="User:Baristarim">Baristarim</a> 19:29, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Those are not book sources: one of them is from a post in a forum, the other one a book summary - the other sources listed are the words of actual academics who have written on the specific subject, and there are six of them. Playing with the order is the real POV pushing since it goes against established academic concensus. That's all.

<dd>What are you talking about? Islamic architecture was Iranian architecture. The Islamic Armies adopted old Sassanid architecture, and that later became known as Islamic architecture. Iranian architecture was used in Anatolia and the Caucasus alongside Byzantine architecture before the area even became Turkified. Not only did the Ottoman's used Islamic Persian architecture, but they also used Byzantine architecture, which itself had some Persian influences.<a href="../../../a/z/e/User%7EAzerbaijani_f7b7.html" title="User:Azerbaijani">Azerbaijani</a> 20:16, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">embargo</span></h2>
<p>I think that we should include the reason why Turkey is not opening its ports to the RoC: because it refuses to lift the embargo against TRNC / Northern Cyprus. Any ideas? I can do it, or you, or we can leave it out. No problem. The longer reason is that after the 2004 referendum the EU had given assurances to the TC people that their isolation would end; the TC voted for, but the EU failed to keep its commitment. <a href="../../../p/o/l/User%7EPolitis_3dd1.html" title="User:Politis">Politis</a> 23:43, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, I was just about to sleep actually. And please let me apologize if it was a bit rude to just point out the issue and do nothing with the paragraph, like I was expecting you to do everything. I really think you would be more comfortable doing that, after all, you know every piece and corner of the article. I don't mind at all if you start modifying it because I trust your writing skills and I will try to help along.

<dd>I'm going to find and read the main page summaries of all previous FA country articles. As a reminder, I have a problem with the mention of Middle East, note that it's not even referred to in the actual article save the relations with Israel, and I'm not sure if the country's being populous should be something to focus on (be it at the very beginning, or any place at all), when I read that, it's a bit like there is nothing much interesting about the country. I mean, putting more emphasis on Turkey's unique characteristics could be more "catchy" to get people to read the rest of the article. And I really believe mentioning the process of EU membership negotiations is a must for this summary. Just sharing my thoughts.&#160;:) I'll try to help. <a href="../../../a/t/i/User%7EAtilimGunesBaydin_6556.html" title="User:AtilimGunesBaydin">Atilim Gunes Baydin</a> 05:30, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Turkification</span></h2>
<p>Hi Baris. To be honest, i did not read the whole discussion, but i have been following some parts of it the past days, and at that time, i checked only the diff link; u quoted a PA for the revert, but i did not see any. Not that the language Tajik uses is the best possible to reach agreements and solutions, but i do believe that he does have a point. what he said about the former Turkish Minister of Culture shocked me, and if true, it surely has a place somewhere in Wikipedia. Maybe not in that article, though... Khoikhoi had proposed a different term to be used for assimilation by Turkic peoples, as a whole, different than the term "Turkification". I will post a comment in that article's talk, explaining further. PS: i have that article in my watchlist since long ago (when the articles about -ication began to appear like mushrooms) and i tried not to get involved in the past. Hope i will help to settle disputes down now:) Regards <a href="../../../h/e/c/User%7EHectorian_d70e.html" title="User:Hectorian">Hectorian</a> 16:54, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Ugh. It looks like I'd be jumping into a snake pit if I got involved; maybe you can just explain to me on my talk page what the problem is? Is there any way it can be resolved? You might try contacting <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrancis_Tyers_a973.html" title="User:Francis Tyers">Francis Tyers</a> about it—he's the one who created the article, and he's also an excellent mediator. <tt class="plainlinks"><a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhoikhoi_b62f.html" title="User:Khoikhoi">Khoi</a><a href="../../../k/h/o/User_talk%7EKhoikhoi_f6d5.html" title="User talk:Khoikhoi">khoi</a></tt> 05:14, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Sorry to butt in. Allow me to <b>disagree</b> about <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrancis_Tyers_a973.html" title="User:Francis Tyers">Francis Tyers</a> being a good mediator. In my experience, his involvement generates constant and unecessary compliations that lead to antagonisms. <b>His abscence seems like a blessing</b>: things are sorted out. For instance, Greek-Turkish points of contention tend to find common ground or people can agree to disagree. No offence intended to anyone holding an opposite imperssion. <a href="../../../p/o/l/User%7EPolitis_3dd1.html" title="User:Politis">Politis</a> 12:59, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
