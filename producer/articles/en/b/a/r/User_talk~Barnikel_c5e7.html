<p>Hi, I signed up for project middle earth yesterday. I've been adding infoboxes for battles and places. Are there any tasks you guys are currently working on? Where can I help? Most of the tasks listed on the things to do page seem to be completed. --<a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarnikel_4a8e.html" title="User:Barnikel">Barnikel</a> 04:59, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi Barnikel, and welcome. I've moved this message to my user talk page and copied it to your user talk page (you left it on my user page, rather than the user talk page). There is lots to do, but the best place to ask is at the talk page for the WikiProject. Try posting your message <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Middle-earth_8f84.html" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Middle-earth">here</a> and see what people find for you to do.

<p>Hi there (again). I've been looking through some of your edits, and I like what I see. I've also added some comments and responses to some of your comments on talk pages. Apologies if it feels like things are inactive or not a lot is going on - I for one find it difficult to keep track of what is going on, but there is quite a lot happening. There is a way to have a watchlist covering all Tolkien-related articles, there is an example at <a href="../../../m/i/d/Portal%7EMiddle-earth_8b9a.html" title="Portal:Middle-earth">Portal:Middle-earth</a>. The best place to raise issues that don't seem to be getting responses is at the talk page of the WikiProject. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 12:35, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have thought of one thing that does need doing urgently (well, not <i>that</i> urgently, but it is something that is annoying me and I don't have time to do). There are four volumes of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_History_of_Middle-earth_ca50.html" title="The History of Middle-earth">The History of Middle-earth</a> that have been merged at <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_History_of_The_Lord_of_the_Rings_aece.html" title="The History of The Lord of the Rings">The History of The Lord of the Rings</a>. That article should be kept, but it would be nice to have separate articles for the four volumes, both to categorise and to write about separately. The pages exist, but are currently redirects to <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_History_of_The_Lord_of_the_Rings_aece.html" title="The History of The Lord of the Rings">The History of The Lord of the Rings</a>. The four books are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Return_of_the_Shadow_01ab.html" title="The Return of the Shadow">The Return of the Shadow</a></li>
<li><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Treason_of_Isengard_d533.html" title="The Treason of Isengard">The Treason of Isengard</a></li>
<li><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_War_of_the_Ring_2cad.html" title="The War of the Ring">The War of the Ring</a> (complicated - currently a disambiguation page)</li>
<li><a href="../../../s/a/u/Sauron_Defeated_2304.html" title="Sauron Defeated">Sauron Defeated</a></li>

<dd>I have access to War of the Ring. I'll help write that one. But I don't know how to redirect pages. Maybe a more experienced wikipedian can take care of that part? --<a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarnikel_4a8e.html" title="User:Barnikel">Barnikel</a> 13:18, 12 May 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Redirecting is easy, but probably not needed here. You may not have enough edits yet, but give it a few more days and a little "move" tab should appear at the top of pages. It is best though to wait until you know what you are doing with that. Actually, #REDIRECT, which is probably what you were talking about, is even easier. Try <a href="../../../r/e/d/Help%7ERedirect_9b77.html" title="Help:Redirect">Help:Redirect</a> and <a href="../../../m/o/v/Help%7EMove_8179.html" title="Help:Move">Help:Move</a>. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 13:22, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Another thing - removing movie images from articles is OK, but some people will object. Possibly placing them lower down the article is best. If you do remove them, could you please make a list or category of them somewhere, so we can keep track of them all. It is easy to lose the images otherwise.

<dd>Apologies! I just removed images where they are absolutely contradictory to te text (like the Balrog!) or use stuff that could misguide the reader seeking to freshen up on his concepts. How do I go about categorizing them?

<p>I noticed this edit <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Caradhras&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=52803291" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Caradhras&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=52803291" rel="nofollow">here</a>, which in general I agree with. When you remove material like this, though, it might be an idea to add it to an article like <a href="../../../t/h/e/Cuts_and_alterations_from_the_book_in_The_Lord_of_the_Rings%7E_The_Return_of_the_King_%28film%29_313a.html" title="Cuts and alterations from the book in The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (film)">Cuts_and_alterations_from_the_book_in_The_Lord_of_the_Rings:_The_Return_of_the_King_(film)</a>, but for the films in general. Actually, looking at that article, is seems to be beyond repair, so I'm not quite sure what to do about the many "book versus films" comments that have appeared in many articles. Gathering them into their own sections seems to be the next best thing to removing them. Maybe there needs to be a centralised discussion at the WikiProject about this. Or maybe there is something at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Middle-earth_Standards_5fc6.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Middle-earth/Standards">Wikipedia:WikiProject Middle-earth/Standards</a>? <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 14:08, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Its no problem when there is a sub section like 'Portrayal in the films', which is great for subtly ranting about book to movie changes, but here, it is added as a part of the description of the peak itself. I will remember to put such stuff in movie changes article in the furure.</dd>

<dd>They are in the <a href="../../../m/e/w/Mewlips.html" title="Mewlips">Mewlips</a> poem. I found a copy online <a href="http://users.cybercity.dk/~bkb1782/tolkien/mewlips.html" class="external text" title="http://users.cybercity.dk/~bkb1782/tolkien/mewlips.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>. They are mentioned in the third verse. Whether this even warrants its own article is debatable. But at least we should correct the existing article. Also, that webpage seems to think it is possible to say where Merlock Mountain is. At the least, there are clues in the poem to the location of the Mewlips and Gorcrows. But an important point to make is the dating of the poem - when did Tolkien write it? Did he intend for it to be taken as anything more than a hobbit legend? <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 14:58, 12 May 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Of course! How silly of me. But truth be told, we don't even know what they are- we only know that they croak! A complete article would be one sentence, and still not complete. Tell you what. I'll add a reference to the gorcrows in the Mewlips article, and you can decide what to do with the independent gorcrows article. For what it's worth, I don't think that article should even exist.--<a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarnikel_4a8e.html" title="User:Barnikel">Barnikel</a> 15:05, 12 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Hi. Newly created articles sometimes take a little while to be added to the 'index' for searching. You should be seeing it now. I updated the campaign box, but in general when you see something like {{&lt;whatever&gt;}} you can edit it by searching on 'Template:&lt;whatever&gt;'. If no 'namespace' (Wikipedia:, User:, et cetera) is specified then anything inside double curly brackets is assumed to be in the 'Template:' namespace. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User%7ECBDunkerson_e7cf.html" title="User:CBDunkerson">CBDunkerson</a> 09:42, 13 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Hmmm. Apparently the search index isn't being updated very often currently. You can still get directly to the page using the 'Go' button instead of 'Search'. 'Go' tries to load the exact page named and then performs a 'Search' if that page is not found... so it's usually better to use 'Go' by default. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User%7ECBDunkerson_e7cf.html" title="User:CBDunkerson">CBDunkerson</a> 19:06, 13 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
