<dd>There was a line item with your username that said, "If your going to remove one genealogy link, then we must remove them all. The last two were spam". Those last two were added by me. These sites are not commercial and are pertinent to the state of New York. They are research related and valuable resources. The reason that I had removed them before was because I misunderstood Pavel and when it was clear what his objection was, I reinstated the links. If I have misunderstood the line item, then I apologize. Cribbswh 14:22, 11 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<p>FYI, I resent (i.e. do not appreciate) you calling the 2004 irregularities article "[my] pet article". I did not create it, I did not make the most contributions to it, I do not claim any authority over it, and I do not consider it a pet. It is the product and property of the general public, and, as such, is as legitimate as any other wikipedia article. Articles on wikipedia are not "owned" by any member, and represent the consensus of the community. etc. etc. See the pages in the community portal section for more detail about the nature of wikipedia articles. Also, please look over the behavior pages, such as <a href="../../../c/i/v/Wikipedia%7ECivility_f107.html" title="Wikipedia:Civility">Wikipedia:Civility</a>. Again, I do not appreciate this.</p>
<p>Regarding the 2004 irregularites article, there have been numerous blanket pov allegations on the vfd pages, and the allegors have repeatedly been asked to bring their disputes to the article talk page and make them specific. Most of them just ignored the invitations, but a few of them decided to make contructive use of their criticism. As soon as they brought their specific criticisms to the talk page, a NPOV dispute tag was put up. Their contributions to the article were quite welcome, and all of their qualms have been resolved. They took the NPOV dispute tag down when the article met their satisfaction. As far as I know, everyone contributing to that page would like the article to be as NPOV as possible, so if you have any specific disputes, I encourage you to bring them to the article's talk page. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_baas_eec8.html" title="User:Kevin baas">Kevin Baas</a><sup><a href="../../../k/e/v/User_talk%7EKevin_baas_1af8.html" title="User talk:Kevin baas">talk</a></sup> 07:41, 2005 Mar 17 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'm flattered that you wanted to write such a long commentary on my use of the word "pet" on Rhobite's user talk page. I'm sorry if I offended you; such was not the intent. I am fully aware of the nature of articles on Wikipedia, but that you for taking the time to explain that to me.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Articles on wikipedia should, indeed, represent the consensus of the community. This is why I was confused on your continued efforts to place a statement on the <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W._Bush_315d.html" title="George W. Bush">George W. Bush</a> opening paragraph which others believed should not be placed such a position of importance in the article.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As far as the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004_U.S._presidential_election_controversy_and_irregularities_5add.html" title="2004 U.S. presidential election controversy and irregularities">2004 U.S. presidential election controversy and irregularities</a> article goes, I had tried to enter into the discussion a month or so ago, but you repeatedly disagreed with every statement I had made. I received no support for my proposals and saw that this was a contencious article, so I chose not to pursue the matter further.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If I may, for a second, digress for moment about that particular article. Please do not construe this as a personal attack, just an observation. It seems that people who seriously believe that there existed a concerted effort to disenfranchise Democratic voters feel quite strongly about it. On the other hand, there are those who aren't convinced that a significant number of irregularities occured, such as myself. I don't feel as strongly about this issue simply because, in my opinion, statistical whining doesn't change the election's result. I will not go through as much effort to make an article such as that one NPOV from my perspective. But for those who seriously believe that great injustices have been wrought, Wikipedia might be the only outlet to vent these feelings. There is no way that I can match the passion that others feel on this issue, and I don't really feel like waging a hard fought battle alone for that article.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I look forward to working with you again. --<a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaronLarf_c8b8.html" title="User:BaronLarf">BaronLarf</a> 15:07, Mar 17, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>A nice reply. I have replied on the GWB talk page regarding the meaning of "consensus", according to wikipedia policy.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I don't particularly remember the conversions we had a month ago, and if I disagreed with you, that is not neccessarily objection to either of our arguments, or either of us, regardless of the proportion. Likewise regarding support for proposals. Regardless, users should feel welcome on all pages and I regret that you did not feel this way, and that I, as I suppose you mean to say, was a factor in this.</dd>

<dd>I really don't think anyone on that page has a strong opinion about how many irregularities there were, or whether there was a concerted effort to disenfrancise Democratic voters. (I see, however, how one might get this impression from reading the article.) From my experience, the contributors to that page have presented and organized the facts pertaining to irregularities in the 2004 election in a straightforward and impartial way. I wouldn't doubt that most of them, at least, are of the opinion that, say, Mitofsky has offered no evidence to support their explanation of the exit poll - vote count discrepancy. But I would much sooner believe that they are of this opinion because Mitofsky has offered no evidence to support their explanation of the exit poll - vote count discrepancy, than because they believe there was a concerted effort to disenfranchise Democratic voters. I would sooner believe this because I have read Mitofsky's reports, and they offered no evidence to support their explanation. Likewise regarding the inequitable distribution of voting machines. The probable are of the "opinion" that the voting machines in Ohio were not distributed in an equitable manner, because the voting machines in Ohio were not distributed in an equitable manner. I think you'll discover that everything in the articles has this simple explanation. <a href="../../../o/c/k/Ockham%27s_razor..html" title="Ockham's razor.">Ockham's razor.</a> No where in the set of article is it alleged that there was a concerted effort to disenfrancise Democratic voters, and the information in the articles is not guided by or contingent on that hypothesis. The information in the articles is a neutral presentation of the empirical facts, irrespective of any given hypothesis. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_baas_eec8.html" title="User:Kevin baas">Kevin Baas</a><sup><a href="../../../k/e/v/User_talk%7EKevin_baas_1af8.html" title="User talk:Kevin baas">talk</a></sup> 18:48, 2005 Mar 17 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello, BaronLarf. I suspected you might be a Lawrence graduate. The <a href="../../../l/a/w/Lawrence_University_46e4.html" title="Lawrence University">Lawrence University</a> page is well on its way to respectable. It certainly needs more treatment of Bjorklunden, which should have its own article. I would also like to see the Conservatory with its own article. Milwaukee Downer deserves an article as well (with the predecessor schools given redirects). Few of my contemporaries at Lawrence have gone on to enough fame and fortune (though one is apparently an Internet-porn king) to warrent articles. If they do, I'll be sure to add them to the list of distinguished alumni -<a href="../../../a/c/j/User%7EAcjelen_acd8.html" title="User:Acjelen">Acjelen</a> 20:27, 7 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thank you for any format changes you did to improve the Jeb Bush article. I was a bit perplexed that you came to that page, after I then saw this on your user page: "Trying to make articles on George W. Bush neutral really makes me want to scream, though, so I don't do much on that page." Ini any event -- please note: you are the 2nd person to change the way quotes appear in the article, and both you and the other wiki person claim to have the format correct, but neither one of you agree. So. I will just wait till the 3rd person comes along and changes the format again. Same thing with certain other format changes that others approved (and I never did in the first place), but you changed, and, I am sure, again, someone will come along and then change your format saying it was wrong, too. So, I am staying away from format arguments since no one here seems to actually agree on format. With respect to photos, kindly read my talk page and you will see an on-going discussion about it. Thanks again for your interest and help, and I am being sincere, because if you made the page look better, I appreciate it. But, FYI, I believe the photo issue is already resolved. And, I will let the other person I am already involved on that, on my talk page, know more. <a href="../../../s/u/m/User%7ESummerFR_7a91.html" title="User:SummerFR">SummerFR</a> 17:49, 23 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

Also, for the reasons I stated in my last response on the discussion page -- my belief that any lawyer will want to see how the photos are being used -- I intend to restore all photos as I had them, to enable those lawyers next week to see them on the page. I am asking that you leave those photos up for that purpose, since getting an answer is what both you and I seek, and I feel we will get an answer if they know what we are talking about. They will not know if you keep deleting the photos. In addition, I will later write to you a longer response on the discussion page of the Jeb article, outlining the reasons for a complaint I have about every single political and historical biography entry I have thus far read onwikipedia, and my complaint is this: there are not enough photos on those pages. There should have been more, and I will make my case about this. Consequently, in my view, as an educator and someone who wants to support the goals of wikipedia, the real problem here is not that I have posted too many photos, but that not enough photos have been posted on other wiki entries. That is something we can peraps discuss more after you consider my reasoning, to come.

<li>BaronLarf,, Please stop reverting my edits that I just stayed up all night to do because of the reason I already explained to you. You asked me for permission about the photos. I got you an email from myflorida. com You were silent when I posted that email. I put all the photos back so those lawyers could see them. Now you are going back in and changing all my work yet again. Please stop it. It is annoying. You are not doing anything that is helpful to your alleged complaint of pro=Jeb slant. You are just doing what you want, no matter than I got you an email and asked you to stop so the lawyers could see. Please stop it now. If you are so big on woiki rules, then you know you can not keep reverting back that page 3X in 24 hours as yo have done. So, stop it. <a href="../../../s/u/m/User%7ESummerFR_7a91.html" title="User:SummerFR">SummerFR</a></li>

<p>Hi BaronLarf,</p>
<p>I was close to putting all the photos up on <a href="../../../c/p/_/WP%7ECP_e7b9.html" title="WP:CP">WP:CP</a> too. But I figured it couldn't hurt to try to have a conversation about them with SummerFR first, especially because SummerFR is new to Wikipedia. I was surprised when s/he got into emailing the Bush folks for permission. It doesn't seem likely to me that the copyright holders will release the images under GFDL. Now I'm feeling a little over my head, and I'm thinking of asking someone with more Wikipedia experience to look in on things. I'm worried that the Bush folks will grant some kind of permission that will be incompatible with Wikipedia, and it will turn into a big confusing mess.</p>
<p>Also, yes, the article is POV and I'm trying to think of ways to NPOV-ify it. I know that Mother Jones ran a lengthy article about his ties to Big Sugar that tend to, hmm, undercut his claims of environmentalism. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreplySpang_52d7.html" title="User:FreplySpang">FreplySpang</a> <a href="../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFreplySpang_a627.html" title="User talk:FreplySpang">(talk)</a> 01:22, 24 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Hi Freply Spang, I don't know what "POV" means in wiki talk, but I am guessing it means you think the article is too slanted pro-Jeb. The last link I added, in the concluding paragraph, is an opinion piece that I think is decidely anti-Jeb. Have you read it? What did you think of it? I added that in an effort to appease you, but it seems you want something akin to an in-depth analysis of the sort that Mother Jones can publish.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are willing to write opinion pieces or whatever, to extend the article, to a much longer version, and that is something wiki wants in an encyclopedia, well, then, do it. But, as I said to you or someone else, I honestly don't think any encyclopedia entry is the place to attempt to denigrate someone's acomplishments -- and, believe it or not, even while there is of course criticism one can make in every area about every governor, there are, in fact, MANY environmental accomplishments of this particular governor, in terms of expanding the preservation of land, helping endangered species, and a long list of other things I could name. You might be surprised to know that environmental groups -- none of which I belong to or head, by the way -- have not only endorsed Gov Bush in the past, but have given awards and honors to him, to reflect his comittment to the environement. Yes, it's true. Believe it or not. BTW, do you live in Florida as I do? Do you know these things as people in Florida do? That's why people vote for him. People here care about the environment, deeply, whether they head an environmental group or not. And, any governor who didn't care at all would not last very long in this state. Any rational person would tell you the same thing I am telling you. But, people out of state tend to thinmk they are experts about this state, when guess what - they are not. They like to come and protest here and the rest of the state gets polled by newspapers, and big surprise, no one in the state agrees with the out of the state protesters. It has happened constantly, in every controversy here, from One Florida on down. One Florida, for example, has 66% approval rating in this state. Do the busloads of protesters that have come from out of state to Florida to protest One Florida even know that? I will guess not. But the Miami Herald knows it, as they did the polling.</p>
<p>No, they do not all agree with him on every issue, and yes, there are controversies in Florida, and yes, I intend to mention that fact if you would only give me a chance to write all the text I would like to write, but, people like you seem way too eager to highlight one issue over a record that is a lot more than one or two issues in any area. It might be painful for you to know environmental groups have given him awards, but, I can prove to you they have.</p>
<p>Does Mother Jones ever want to write an article about that fact? Should that fact be mentioned in an encyclopedia? Is it so terrible that myflorida may want to cooperatie with wiki? These are fundamental issues for discussions on a political forum, not a forum about the gathering of knowledge, in a non-partisian way.</p>
<p>I notice that after a flurry of messages to me from you and BaronLarf about those photos, neither of you directly responded to me by mentioning that email, after I posted that email from myflorida. I think it was very nice of Gov Bush to respond so promptly to your concerns, on a weekend no less. But, does he ever get credit, from certain people, for something like being so responsible and easily accessible to the public, a hallmark of his many years in office? The answer, sadly in my view, is no, he never will. It doesn't mean he's right on every issue, but, he does try to do things that other leaders, and believe me I know this, would never do. <a href="../../../s/u/m/User%7ESummerFR_7a91.html" title="User:SummerFR">SummerFR</a> 04:39, 24 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Hi BaronLarf and SummerFR. After getting myself wrapped up in this yesterday, today I realized that I need to pull away somewhat.

<li>Hello BaronLarf. Thanks for the message. Not sure if I dare change anything on the Jeb page (last time I checked I was blocked from editing it anyway, after last week's annoyances).

<li>Oops. It took me a while for the penny to drop. I shouldn't bite the newbies. You're absolutely right. I was initially fairly brusque after being accused of vandalism, but not overtly rude. Then the accusations increased in spite of my explanations for my edit. That pissed me off and I ended up being rude to the person in question - the wrong thing to do, I know.

<p>I'm afraid that there's little anyone can do informally. The pattern is a familiar one: an editor who ahs a very strong point of view but isn't very articulate, who sees everyone who disagrees with him as biased and hostile, and who won't or can't think clearly about the issues or reflect upon his own behaviour. I'll keep trying, but eventually I think that something more formal, such as an RfC, will be needed. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 20:21, 25 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for the reply. I would tend to agree that an RfC against him will probably be necessary.

<dd>Thanks for carrying the flag of NPOV and civility for now, BaronLarf. Like you, I hope that SummerFR comes to understand the workings of Wikipedia better. Her reluctance to go over Wikipedia policies before yelling "harassment" is certainly a concern. I just don't have time to be in the thick of it right now, I'm sorry. But I think you have been trying very hard to be a good Wikicitizen and I'll support you in formal proceedings if necessary. (By the way, SummerFR is a "she.") Oh, I was just wondering: SummerFR has mentioned that your user page used to say something about "trying to make GWBush articles neutral makes me want to scream." She takes that to mean that you want them to be anti-GWB. It sounds to me like you want them to be neutral, but you're surrounded by zealots on all sides, and so it's screamworthily frustrating. Am I right? <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreplySpang_52d7.html" title="User:FreplySpang">FreplySpang</a> <a href="../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFreplySpang_a627.html" title="User talk:FreplySpang">(talk)</a> 21:25, 25 Apr 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Yeah, your interpretation is pretty accurate. My userpage (which I've editted now for clarity) used to list one of my passions as "Trying to make articles on Republicans a more NPOV. Trying to make articles on George W. Bush neutral really makes me want to scream, though, so I don't do much on that page." What I meant by that was I had tried to get involved at the GWB page, but there were so many people on every side along with frequent vandals that I gave up on the page, more or less. At some point I mentioned to SummerFR that I was a Republican, which I thought would help her understand that I wasn't out to tar and feather Jeb Bush. But it didn't seem to help; she then wrote that I was some sort of Republican who was anti-Jeb. &lt;shrug&gt; Thanks much for your message, and I completely understand that you didn't have enough time to get involved in this matter. It's taken huge chunks out of my day; I'm lucky that I can spare it. &#160;;^) --<a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaronLarf_c8b8.html" title="User:BaronLarf">BaronLarf</a> 21:38, Apr 25, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>(AIW) can you take a look at Wikipedia "apartheid"? There is a movement to delete a two-word inclusion that is fact and true. It's gotten to the point that everyone is focused on the disputing editors and not the edit itself.</p>
<p>" Deletionists are disputing the following statement: "South Africa was settled initially by the Dutch, Germans and French from the 17th century onwards. English, other European settlers, and Diaspora Jews followed in the 19th century." This statement is true, and it therefore should not be deleted.69.217.125.53 15:10, 14 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>His biography lists him as being born in Connecticut, so I'd understand that listing. The category <a href="../../../p/e/o/Category%7EPeople_from_Texas_12c5.html" title="Category:People from Texas">Category:People from Texas</a> has this standard listed: "This category includes persons born in Texas and non-natives who are strongly associated with the State of Texas at any time in its history", so he meets that qualification as well. --<a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaronLarf_c8b8.html" title="User:BaronLarf">Baron</a><a href="../../../b/a/r/User_talk%7EBaronLarf_6f13.html" title="User talk:BaronLarf">Larf</a> July 5, 2005 03:13 (UTC)

<dd>So in otherwords, a person doesn't have to be born in that state to be placed in that category.<a href="../../../n/o/b/User%7ENobs01_a89e.html" title="User:Nobs01">Nobs01</a> 5 July 2005 03:16 (UTC)

<dd>According to that category's definitions, no. But, according to <a href="../../../p/e/o/Category%7EPeople_from_Wisconsin_c5f9.html" title="Category:People from Wisconsin">Category:People from Wisconsin</a>, the working definition is "This is category of people born in Wisconsin, a state in the United States." I have no interest in the list for Connecticut or Texas, but I'm trying to maintain the integrity of Wisconsin's list.

<dd>Thanks. I had no idea wiki's policies were not uniform. Must be a <a href="../../../s/t/a/States_Rights_d0bd.html" title="States Rights">States Rights</a> issue. Thanks. <a href="../../../n/o/b/User%7ENobs01_a89e.html" title="User:Nobs01">Nobs01</a> 5 July 2005 03:22 (UTC)

<dd>Yeah, it's too bad that the policies aren't uniform; it would take a person with more fortitude than I have to try to formulate a policy, get consensus, and then enforce it on 50 different, frequently-used categories. --<a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaronLarf_c8b8.html" title="User:BaronLarf">Baron</a><a href="../../../b/a/r/User_talk%7EBaronLarf_6f13.html" title="User talk:BaronLarf">Larf</a> July 5, 2005 03:29 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'd like it if you'd reconsider your vote at CFD <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Categories_for_deletion#Category:Major_cities_in_North_Dakota" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Categories_for_deletion#Category:Major_cities_in_North_Dakota" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. The idea of the category is definitely different from Metro areas. I've also made significant improvements to the implementation of the category, and have incorporated the "Largest cities" section of <a href="../../../n/o/r/Template%7ENorth_Dakota_30f6.html" title="Template:North Dakota">Template:North Dakota</a> as a guideline for what constitutes "Major".</p>
<p>Please bear in mind that there is no legal differentiation between large and small communities in North Dakota. I feel that <a href="../../../c/i/t/Category%7ECities_in_North_Dakota_14c3.html" title="Category:Cities in North Dakota">Category:Cities in North Dakota</a>, being the full list of all communities, is inadequate, while <a href="../../../m/e/t/Category%7EMetropolitan_areas_in_North_Dakota_f164.html" title="Category:Metropolitan areas in North Dakota">Category:Metropolitan areas in North Dakota</a> is too restrictive. This category fills an important niche that until now has not been met. --<a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexwcovington_2ca2.html" title="User:Alexwcovington">Alexwcovington</a> (<a href="../../../a/l/e/User_talk%7EAlexwcovington_ddca.html" title="User talk:Alexwcovington">talk</a>) 05:38, 10 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sorry, I still believe that it's an unnecessary category. If there really needs to be a further list of cities, I believe it should be done in list form, not in a separate category with an arbitrary definition. Cheers. --<a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaronLarf_c8b8.html" title="User:BaronLarf">Baron</a><a href="../../../b/a/r/User_talk%7EBaronLarf_6f13.html" title="User talk:BaronLarf">Larf</a> 05:51, July 10, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I feel that lists are rather archaic now that Wikipedia's been supporting Categories for a while now. I'll concede the point that the category is a bit arbitrary, but it does not follow that the category is POV and will get out of hand. It has long been the case on Wikipedia that articles have been cared for by their editors, and I think that will continue in this case. --<a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexwcovington_2ca2.html" title="User:Alexwcovington">Alexwcovington</a> (<a href="../../../a/l/e/User_talk%7EAlexwcovington_ddca.html" title="User talk:Alexwcovington">talk</a>) 06:34, 10 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

If you have knowledge of the subject matter you are willing to contribute, then by all means, participate in the editing of the category.
