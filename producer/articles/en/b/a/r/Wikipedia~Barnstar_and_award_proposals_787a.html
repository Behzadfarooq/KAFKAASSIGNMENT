<li>I think it needs to be changed to simple one week approval voting. We should speedy all the "unsuccessful" candidacies and begin again, and delete all the other pages that add any extra bureaucracy. The whole point of the Wikihalo is that it is a community award, so it only seems fair that the community gets to express their opinion. As you have rightly pointed out though, it is embarassing for those who failed, and thus these pages should be eradicated. <a href="../../../d/e/v/User%7EDev920_f8f8.html" title="User:Dev920">Dev920</a> (Have a nice day!) 18:59, 27 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I say use the RfA standards: at least a thousand edits and four months on the wiki. I agree it needs to be a tough award, but no-one has heard of the Wikihalo, much less voted on it.

<p>If you look at the history of the award, you'll see that I defended it when it was up for deletion under and MFD - but I've always had problems with the way that it is administered. 1,000 is too low, 10,000 may be too high.

<li>I think that something closer to thirty hundred would be best... I mean evrik, I really respect you as an editor and everything - but really setting the bar that high would be insane - especially since a lot of times the number of edits someone has made is not the best indication for the cumulative effect of their contribution. This award is meant to make people feel good about themselves - and it rewards quality contributions. If a person with 3000 great edits is nominated - I think they should seriously be considered for the award (and no one start bringing in the slippery slope here- thirty hundred edits is still a lot of edits).<font style="font-family:Monotype Corsiva; font-size:5px;"><b>Daniel()Folsom</b></font> |\<a href="../../../d/a/n/User_talk%7EDanielfolsom_8afc.html" title="User talk:Danielfolsom"><sup>T</sup></a>/|\<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Danielfolsom_f7d3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Danielfolsom"><sub>C</sub></a>/|\<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanielfolsom_5631.html" title="User:Danielfolsom"><sup>U</sup></a>/|<sup>(</sup><a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanielfolsom_signature_c757.html" title="User:Danielfolsom/signature"><sup>Can you help me with my signature?</sup></a><sup>)</sup> 03:12, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I agree with what evrik is trying to say, in that this award should be <b>hard</b> to get, to make it more prominent and exclusive. The point i think he is trying to make is that if you have an award that has to be voted on and nominations are required, it should be reserved for really excellent contributors, not just any old Joe Bloggs with 2,000 edits.

<li>I just looked at your contributions page, set it to 500, and saw how many pages that went up to.

<li>My two cents: I like the current nomination process, although if someone is thought of well enough that someone else wants to nominate for a Wikihalo, then it should be done, except for any really major disagreements - like wait a week for major objections - and if none, then support. What you're talking about changing it to sounds just like the criteria for <a href="../../../s/e/r/Wikipedia%7EService_awards_d36e.html" title="Wikipedia:Service awards">Wikipedia:Service awards</a>, and so this award would be nothing special at that point. <a href="../../../c/r/i/User%7ECricket02_ffdd.html" title="User:Cricket02">Cricket02</a> 04:30, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>The wikihalo is for those who are THE Wikipedians, our <a href="../../../a/l/e/Aleksei_Grigorievich_Stakhanov_9796.html" title="Aleksei Grigorievich Stakhanov">Stakhanovs</a>, our heroes. I think that every criteria that we choose will we inadequate. I also think that the recipient doesn't have to accept his nominations, and that we can nominate and award it even to the ones who have left Wikipedia. This is our highest "decoration", the Wikipedia's <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medal_of_Honor_1efa.html" title="Medal of Honor">Medal of Honor</a>, and there are more than one who should received one even if he/she left. I think that the quorum should be of 10 votes, since there aren't actually many peoples who check the page, with over 85% of supports. I know that only a few candidates can pass such a limit, but it's right, only a few wikipedians can receive this award. I think that we should "advertise" wikihalos, it should be a community process, not just a few's decision. In conclusion, I'm really looking forward to nominate some wikipedians who have left for the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikihalo_1e2d.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikihalo">posthumously WikiHalo</a>.

<p>I've changed the time that each nomination should last from one week to one month. I know it's a lot, but until we find a way to get more people to participate, I think it's needed.

<p>FWIW, I realized something tonight. I was just awarded a Wikihalo. No, you didn't miss it; I was never nominated. Someone just awarded it to me. So I checked out <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Image:Wiki-halo.png" class="external text" title="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Image:Wiki-halo.png" rel="nofollow">the image page</a>. Seems LOTS of people have been just giving this out. I am very amused by the surreal and anarchistic spirit of Wikipedians in this instance. However, I still have to decide whether to display the one I was given. Perhaps I need a new section for "illegal awards"&#160;;-) - <font face="comic sans ms"><b><a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKathryn_NicDh%C3%A0na_9cdf.html" title="User:Kathryn NicDhàna"><span style="color:#009">Kathryn NicDhàna</span></a></b> <a href="../../../k/a/t/User_talk%7EKathryn_NicDh%C3%A0na_4e24.html" title="User talk:Kathryn NicDhàna">♫</a><font color="navy">♦</font><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kathryn_NicDh%C3%A0na_0d4e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kathryn NicDhàna">♫</a></font> 05:07, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>P.S. As I look at how long the list of actual recipients is, as opposed to the official recipients, and the low number of participants in this discussion, I'm thinking we already have a clear consensus here as to how this should be awarded, and by who. Then again, we could do a clever image switch and declare all the "illegal" recipients to be outlaws, and we could propose it be renamed <b>The Outlaw Award</b>&#160;;-D - <font face="comic sans ms"><b><a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKathryn_NicDh%C3%A0na_9cdf.html" title="User:Kathryn NicDhàna"><span style="color:#009">Kathryn NicDhàna</span></a></b> <a href="../../../k/a/t/User_talk%7EKathryn_NicDh%C3%A0na_4e24.html" title="User talk:Kathryn NicDhàna">♫</a><font color="navy">♦</font><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kathryn_NicDh%C3%A0na_0d4e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kathryn NicDhàna">♫</a></font> 05:20, 15 March 2007 (UTC</p>
<p>P.P.S.&#160;!Recount. It seems the award image is also being used in an "I Assume Good Faith" userbox. It's hard to tell how many of the links on that page are from that use, but I would cautiously assume a good number, possibly most of them. However, the text <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Wikipedia:Other_awards" class="external text" title="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Wikipedia:Other_awards" rel="nofollow">here</a> does not mention the award needing community approval of any sort.

<p>Why is this called "The Working <i>Man's</i> Barnstar? Surely a gender-neutral title would be a simple and less anachronistic choice.

<dd>Why the <b>sarcasm</b>? If there are women that do not feel included by 'Man', use a gender neutral barnstar. How hard would that be, to change a line? At least 4 women have participated in this discussion as far as I can ascertain, and three have supported the change. That's something to think about.

<dd>I'm not being sarcastic. Working Man <i>is</i> gender neutral, <a href="../../../m/a/n/Man.html#Etymology" title="Man">Man</a> refers to all mankind. If we start creating new barnstars on the basis on personality rather than edits, chaos will ensue, as I've pointed out above. As I said, I do not feel excluded by the barnstar, because I know the etymology of the word and am not offended by it. If we need to, link the Man in the title to ensure that everyone else knows it too. The whole point of the Barnstar seems to be that it's some kind of play on <a href="../../../w/o/r/Working_Man_62ef.html" title="Working Man">Working Man</a>, or the working class. Changing it to Working Wikipedian for the sake of political correctness ruins the whole thing. <a href="../../../d/e/v/User%7EDev920_f8f8.html" title="User:Dev920">Dev920</a> (Have a nice day!) 16:06, 25 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I don't think the point would be lost if we used, for example, the Working Wikipedia barnstar. If the play on words is so important, a link could always be included I guess. The point is all about being a hard working wikipedian, right?&#160;;-) Then why not change a simple word to be (yes, I'm not afraid to say it) politically correct?

Which I quote here:</p>
<blockquote class="templatequote" style="margin-top:0;">
<p>Your web site graphic of the purple heart "barnstar" is inappropriate and offensive to members of the United States Armed Services who suffered injuries to be awarded the medal. Reducing the purple heart to something awarded to wikipedians involved in anti-vandalism efforts seems disingenuous and is in bad taste. Please consider what message you are trying to send by posting this item on your user page, and whether it reflects poorly on the wikipedia community.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I agree with their opinion so perhaps the image should be changed so that it does not include an actual image of the medal, but instead is just purple. I don't have the graphic talent to makes the change, so I will leave it up to others to change should we agree to make the change. -- <a href="../../../g/o/g/User%7EGogo_Dodo_6e56.html" title="User:Gogo Dodo">Gogo Dodo</a> 22:59, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Oppose</b> Although I understand the main argument here for restoring the version without the medal, I think that we need not be so politically correct. Frankly, I think that nobody would really care with the usage of this medal on the purple barnstar, that's just nitpicking. The barnstar looked really nice with it, and if this medal has to go, I hope that at least a visually attractive and politically correct substitute can be added. --<strong><a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHusond_60c3.html" title="User:Husond"><font style="color: #082567">Hús</font></a><a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHusond_Esperanza_ea94.html" title="User:Husond/Esperanza"><font color="green">ö</font></a><a href="../../../h/u/s/User_talk%7EHusond_a306.html" title="User talk:Husond"><font style="color: #082567">nd</font></a></strong> 21:50, 19 March 2007 (UTC)

<p>Broadening the scope of the proposed star slightly to also incorporate <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spirituality.html" title="Spirituality">spirituality</a>, I've created this possible star, based on the fact that clouds are often used to represent the afterlife, which virtually all religions believe in in one way or another, as well as just the general role clouds play in meditation and prayer. Alternatively, I could create an image based on the candle, since most religions use candles at some point in their ceremonies. <a href="../../../s/m/u/User%7ESmurrayinchester_f294.html" title="User:Smurrayinchester"><span style="color:#77AAAA">Laïka</span></a> 17:14, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

The title is a play on words of "The Congressional Medal of Honor", in this case, the word "Congressional" means dealing with Congress and not that it is actually awarded by Congress.

<li>Alas, DrWho1975, I don't agree. Your points are all valid, but I don't agree in general with the principle of specialization/categorization among Barnstars. Either you earn a Barnstar or not. All this despite my being a active participant in <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikiproject_U.S._Congress_6957.html" title="Wikiproject U.S. Congress">Wikiproject U.S. Congress</a>.

<li><b>Comment</b> Markles, obviously I understand the point your are trying to make with reference to policy on Barnstars, but this it not the time or the place to assert your view on this policy. The question we are debating here, whether you agree with the general principal or not, is does this WikiProject deserve a Barnstar. Seeing as many other WikiProjects also have their own Barnstars, you must decide if this one should have one as well not on your own opinion on the policy, but your own opinion on the WikiProject and the proposal. <a href="../../../s/m/o/User%7ESmomo_8a01.html" title="User:Smomo">Smomo</a> 00:43, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Support</b>. Fair enough comments. I think that the proliferation of barnstar categories a problem. I would be so much more proud to get a Barnstar than to get a Project Barnstar. It's like the Oscar for "Best Picture" is better than "Best Foreign Language Film." That's my only reluctance regarding your otherwise sufficient proposal. Let me be clear: if Project Barnstars must proliferate, then your proposal for one involving Project Congress is fine with me. Therefore I agree that, despite my objection to the concept of the proliferation of categorical barnstars, this proposition is nonetheless worthy of categorical barnstarification.

<dd><b>Neutral</b>. I still think the image is far too similar to the real Congressional Medal of Honor, even with the changing of the ribbon color from blue stars to green. An upside down star is the central part of the medalion in the Medal of Honor. I'm afraid that it is still too close that it might raise objections among military recipients of the Medal of Honor. Having said that, I will not oppose the creation of the barnstar -- with the caveat that it the image be open to future changes in case any major objections are raised against it.<a href="../../../d/c/m/User%7EDcmacnut_1c9e.html" title="User:Dcmacnut">Dcmacnut</a> 21:52, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I thought my earlier arguments stood on their own. I was actually tying to let the debate run it's natural course with regards to those points because I'm actually interested in seeing what other users think without letting this turn too much into a point by point argument. However... since you asked... I do not agree that the image looks like an existing medal. We have several similar images already in use. As for the wording; I view this as a colorful play on words that pays homage to the term Congressional Medal of Honor... since the Congressional Medal of Honor is not the official name of the Medal of Honor, then surely there can be no offense. It's clear that the name doesn't readily bring about musch opposition... after all it took you an entire day before you realized you did not like the name after you had already viewed the award once.

<p>Like most things on Wikipedia, the discussion is left to mature until some sort of consensus is reached, or the discussion just dies, and at that point the Barnstar is either accepted or rejected by one person who is <a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBOLD_e2a0.html" title="WP:BOLD">bold</a> enough to make the decision that it should stay or go. This person normally has quite a bit of experience in these sorts of matters, but obviously, it can be anybody and, like anything else, it can be contested or reverted. I don't think that a consensus has been reached yet, so this debate isn't over, as far as I see. Now, a few people are opposed to the name or the image, but a few are also in support. Is there anyway parties from either side would be willing to compromise? <a href="../../../s/m/o/User%7ESmomo_8a01.html" title="User:Smomo">Smomo</a> 23:06, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Maybe this concept could replace the Nintendo star personal user award. Currently, it uses the same image as the CVG Star and doesn't do much to diffrentiate itself. Although... considering the suggestor appears to have a made a "hit and run" appearance; there doesn't seem to be much support for this star. Maybe I'll be bold and replace the Nintendo Star with this. I also agree with RyGuy's comment about th image.--<a href="../../../d/r/_/User%7EDr_who1975_66e5.html" title="User:Dr who1975">Dr who1975</a> 03:39, 7 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

My proposed barnstar</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>I'm proposing an award for those who are diligent in editing articles in the scope of WikiProject Professional Wrestling. The award is just like a normal barnstar in design, if someone in the project wants to give it to anyone else, they can just go ahead and do so. I believe this can help the overall quality of articles in the scope of the project because people will work towards getting the barnstar by posting exemplary edits and creations. Thank you. ----- <a href="../../../g/i/g/User%7EGIGGAS2_65ff.html" title="User:GIGGAS2">GIGGAS2</a> 04:51, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Kinda Support</b> - I love the idea of WProj:Oregon having a barnstar. It's a large project that certainly warrants it. However, I have to agree that the proposed image is a little obscure. I know it's something that is featured on the capital building, but I think something that screams "Oregon" a little better would be more appropriate. -- <img class='tex' src="../../../math/3/a/0/3a016d8d0cf70a5d2cf625fde5eeda1c.png" alt="\sqrt[\tfrac{_{32^\circ\mathrm {F}}} {^{0^\circ\mathrm {C}\;\;}}]{_{\infty}}\approx\tfrac{\sin('d) ^{\underline {\flat y}}}{\mathbb {Z} y+\Re_{\varnothing}\!{n!}} \otimes" /><a href="../../../z/y/t/User%7EZytron_6150.html" title="User:Zytron"><small>user</small></a><b>|</b><a href="../../../z/y/t/User_talk%7EZytron_c90f.html" title="User talk:Zytron"><small>TALK</small></a> 02:47, 4 April 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Additional comment</b> Possible image suggestions could be a beaver, specifically the beaver from the back of the flag (nearly everyone knows Oregon as the beaver state). Symbols of the Oregon Trail are also good for incorporating those unfamiliar with the state but familiar with US history and the state's origins (an aerial view of the star in a circle of wagons, for instance). I agree that landmarks should be avoided (with the possible exception of Crater Lake which gives the state planetary notoriety and appeared to represent the state on US currency) because they are divisive and generally unrecognizable to those outside specific geographic areas. One last possible image is to use the state seal, an image in the public domain. -- <img class='tex' src="../../../math/3/a/0/3a016d8d0cf70a5d2cf625fde5eeda1c.png" alt="\sqrt[\tfrac{_{32^\circ\mathrm {F}}} {^{0^\circ\mathrm {C}\;\;}}]{_{\infty}}\approx\tfrac{\sin('d) ^{\underline {\flat y}}}{\mathbb {Z} y+\Re_{\varnothing}\!{n!}} \otimes" /><a href="../../../z/y/t/User%7EZytron_6150.html" title="User:Zytron"><small>user</small></a><b>|</b><a href="../../../z/y/t/User_talk%7EZytron_c90f.html" title="User talk:Zytron"><small>TALK</small></a> 14:08, 8 April 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Oppose</b> the image. <b>Support</b> the barnstar.

I'm not trying to be mean in saying that). The statue itself is also somewhat obscure. The height relative to width of the image is far too long.

<li><b>Comment</b>-Since I made it I will refrain from voting, but a few comments: 1) I don't think proportions should be a legitimate concern as I doubt there is any sort of guideline judging from the vast array of shapes and sizes for barnstars and other awards (plus the size is easily adjusted). 2) What image better represents Oregon? I’m not saying the Oregon Pioneer is the best image to go with and we at WPOR are happy to go with another, but give a suggestion of what is a better image. However, please keep in mind that whatever image is chosen will not make everyone happy as the state can be very divided over things. For instance using Mt. Hood will tick off most people outside of Portland, few people would recognize Haystack Rock, and putting the star over a map of the state wouldn’t help judging by the repeated reports of a lack of geographical knowledge by the American public. Crater Lake might work, but again not sure if everyone would know what it is. There is not going to be a perfect image to represent any state, heck at WPOR we can’t even agree on if we want to collaborate on Portland or Oregon for an FA push. 3) What the award is for becomes obvious when text is written into the caption.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../a/b/o/User%7EAboutmovies_2e04.html" title="User:Aboutmovies">Aboutmovies</a> (<a href="../../../a/b/o/User_talk%7EAboutmovies_8e25.html" title="User talk:Aboutmovies">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Aboutmovies_a643.html" title="Special:Contributions/Aboutmovies">contribs</a>) 05:11, 4 April 2007 (UTC).</small></li>

<p><b>Comment</b> I should think that if you're worthy of being awarded the barnstar, you will know what the image is. Not to be insular and isolationist, but does the image need to please anybody outside the project? Like AM said, any added text will show what the award is for. The gold guy is a pioneer, he's holding an axe (symbolic of logging), schoolchildren save their pennies to get him regilded every so often (how symbolic of the wiki and how everyone pitching in a little creates a great thing--cheesy, but true), and I think that's about a good compromise solution as a symbol of the state as any (the pioneer heritage meme is quite prevalent here), except for the fact it leaves out the Native American people, but that's a whole other can of worms. I think it also makes sense because it's in our capital, and that is where everything comes together here, at least in terms of legislation that affects the whole state. An image of a forest would leave out much of the eastern half of the state. As my pals at WPOR know, I'm a stickler for consistency, but I don't know why our image has to conform to everyone else's idea of what an image should be. That seems pretty boring. We're known for being mavericks around here. Also, I'm female and I don't see anything remotely yonic about the position of the star... <a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKatr67_a209.html" title="User:Katr67">Katr67</a> 16:06, 4 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b> The award can be given to anyone by anyone if they felt the other party made a substantial contribution to Oregon related articles in general. Membership by either party should not be necessary. In any event, I understand your point. My opposition to the image is not so much opposition to the statue, I think it's mildly obscure but that was not my main point at all. My big point is that somebody should make a more artful image (this image looks like a simple cut and paste job). For instance, a stylized rendition of the statue inside the star (maybe standing on top of the dome) would look better. Also (lets call this a medium point of contention) I feel the image is just a bit too long relatvie to it's width (which is why I suggest the statue by inside and the same size as the star). Lastly (and this is another minor point... as was the obscurity of the statue), the way the star is lined up with the statue is a bit odd.--<a href="../../../d/r/_/User%7EDr_who1975_66e5.html" title="User:Dr who1975">Dr who1975</a> 16:43, 4 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><b>Comment</b> "We're known for being mavericks around here."

<li><b>Idea</b> for the picture of the barnstar, could be a barnstar with an Oregon state quarter in the center. I think that would be obvious and I imagine it would look alright. And also it would be more 'square-y' to go along with the shape of other barnstars. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETommyMoullet_2a0b.html" title="User:TommyMoullet">TommyMoullet</a> 01:33, 5 April 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>A barnstar for anyone thanking a person for their clever barnstar design.WikiLove is given for the hard-working people making barnstars.It should be created because you can't be properly thanked for your barnstar with an award.</p>

<p><b>Comment</b> I can't comment on the award concept either way. However, I am having difficulty with these images for awrds that look like simple cut and paste jobs. Surely we can come up with something better.--<a href="../../../d/r/_/User%7EDr_who1975_66e5.html" title="User:Dr who1975">Dr who1975</a> 17:05, 5 April 2007 (UTC) <b>Oppose</b> because perhaps people might be able to do something without receiving an award every five minutes. Sure, I've even made a few awards in my time, but I don't think that for every one I should deserve an award of my own for it. No, I don't like this idea, but good work coming up with an idea anyway. <a href="../../../s/m/o/User%7ESmomo_8a01.html" title="User:Smomo">Smomo</a> 19:05, 5 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>A barnstar for those who work to create new articles, because creating new articles is just as important as fixing old ones. I think a good image for this would be a crossed out red star with a non crossed out blue star next to it to show that we lose a red link and gain a blue link.
