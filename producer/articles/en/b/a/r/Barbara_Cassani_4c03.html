	    <p><b>Barbara Ann Cassani</b>, <a href="../../../o/r/d/Order_of_the_British_Empire_8609.html" title="Order of the British Empire">CBE</a>, (born <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_22.html" title="July 22">July 22</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960.html" title="1960">1960</a>) is an <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">American</a> businesswoman. She was the founder under <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Airways_c23d.html" title="British Airways">British Airways</a> of budget airline <a href="../../../g/o/_/Go_Fly_9eef.html" title="Go Fly">Go Fly</a> and was the first leader of <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a>'s bid for the <a href="../../../2/0/1/2012_Summer_Olympics_3ebe.html" title="2012 Summer Olympics">2012 Summer Olympics</a>.</p>
<p>Barbara Cassani was born in <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston%2C_Massachusetts_d688.html" title="Boston, Massachusetts">Boston</a> to James Cassani and his wife Noreen. She studied at <a href="../../../m/o/u/Mount_Holyoke_College_715e.html" title="Mount Holyoke College">Mount Holyoke College</a>, graduating <i><a href="../../../l/a/t/Latin_honors.html" title="Latin honors">magna cum laude</a></i> with a BA (Hons) <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_relations.html" title="International relations">international relations</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1982.html" title="1982">1982</a>; and is also a former trustee of Mount Holyoke.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> Cassani earned a <a href="../../../m/a/s/Master%27s_degree.html" title="Master's degree">master's degree</a>, again in international relations, from <a href="../../../p/r/i/Princeton_University_960f.html" title="Princeton University">Princeton University</a>'s <a href="../../../w/o/o/Woodrow_Wilson_School_of_Public_and_International_Affairs_8149.html" title="Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs">Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs</a>. She was awarded an honorary degree from <a href="../../../c/r/a/Cranfield_University_2d3c.html" title="Cranfield University">Cranfield University</a> in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a><sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Upon graduation in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1984.html" title="1984">1984</a> she worked as a management consultant for <a href="../../../c/o/o/Coopers_%26_Lybrand_acbe.html" title="Coopers &amp; Lybrand">Coopers &amp; Lybrand</a> before moving to work in the U.S. operation of <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Airways_c23d.html" title="British Airways">British Airways</a>. There she worked in <a href="../../../s/a/l/Sales.html" title="Sales">sales</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marketing.html" title="Marketing">marketing</a>, and on the team that integrated <a href="../../../d/a/n/Dan-Air_c3ba.html" title="Dan-Air">Dan-Air</a> into BA's business.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/9/1997.html" title="1997">1997</a>, facing increasing competition from budget airlines <a href="../../../r/y/a/Ryanair.html" title="Ryanair">Ryanair</a> and <a href="../../../e/a/s/EasyJet_1140.html" title="EasyJet">easyJet</a>, British Airways decided to found its own budget offering. Chief Executive <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Ayling_6d97.html" title="Robert Ayling">Bob Ayling</a> selected Cassani for the task, giving her only Â£25 million in seed capital. The company began operations in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1998.html" title="1998">1998</a> and reached profitability two years later. In <a href="../../../2/0/0/2001.html" title="2001">2001</a> Cassani led a <a href="../../../m/a/n/Management_buyout.html" title="Management buyout">management buyout</a> of the company (with most of the funding coming from <a href="../../../v/e/n/Venture_capital.html" title="Venture capital">venture capital</a> firm <a href="../../../3/i/_/3i.html" title="3i">3i</a>), and became its first Chief Executive.</p>
<p>In 2002, Cassini won the <i>Veuve Clicquot Businesswoman of the Year award</i> <a href="http://www.mtholyoke.edu/offices/comm/csj/050302/cassani.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.mtholyoke.edu/offices/comm/csj/050302/cassani.shtml" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. Later in 2002 the airline was bought by rival easyJet (a move bitterly opposed by Cassani) and she was not offered a position in the merged company. She next released a book detailing her experiences at Go; <i>Go - An Airline Adventure</i> (<a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0-316-72662-1</a>) won a number of business publishing awards the following year.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_2003.html" title="October 2003">October 2003</a> Cassani became a <a href="../../../n/o/n/Non-executive_director.html" title="Non-executive director">non-executive director</a> of retailer <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marks_%26_Spencer_2ad4.html" title="Marks &amp; Spencer">Marks &amp; Spencer</a>, a position she relinquished when she accepted the olympic position. After her olympic tenure she was one of the executives mooted as taking over as the struggling company's Chief Executive.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_2003.html" title="June 2003">June 2003</a> she was appointed to chair London's bid to host the 2012 Summer Olympics. The organising committee felt that her business background would give the bid a badly needed professionalism; the organisational reputation of British sport had already been tarnished when it won the right to host the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005_World_Championships_in_Athletics_92de.html" title="2005 World Championships in Athletics">2005 World Athletics Championships</a> but was forced to withdraw when the promised stadium could not be built.</p>
<p>Cassani's selection surprised many commentators, as she was unknown in the highly political world of Olympic sport. Although she was married to a Briton and had lived in the country for more than a decade, her American nationality also raised some eyebrows. She led the bid through the first phase of the two-stage bidding process. During her tenure the newly formed bid corporation grew to a staff of 80, with many large institutional backers, and gained increasing buy-in from a sceptical British public and political class. Her team created the bid's master plan, which detailed where events would be held, what infrastructure would be built, and provided an overall budget projection for the games. This was submitted to the <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Olympic_Committee_e5dd.html" title="International Olympic Committee">International Olympic Committee</a> in the spring of <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>, and on the strength of it London was selected as one of the five candidate cities.</p>
<p>In March 2004, the <a href="../../../d/a/i/Daily_Telegraph_dc47.html" title="Daily Telegraph">Daily Telegraph</a> diary printed claims that Cassani had been highly critical of <a href="../../../t/o/n/Tony_Blair_f43c.html" title="Tony Blair">Tony Blair</a>, saying "To be frank he wasn't very bright ... the subject he got most animated about was <a href="../../../b/e/a/Beach_volleyball.html" title="Beach volleyball">beach volleyball</a>". Cassani sued for <a href="../../../l/i/b/Libel.html" title="Libel">libel</a> saying that the story was not only completely without foundation but also highly damaging to the bid; on <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_21.html" title="April 21">April 21</a> the Telegraph admitted that she had made none of the remarks attributed to her, and agreed to apologise in print, pay her costs and make a donation to the Olympic bid committee.</p>
<p>In May 2004 Cassani announced she was stepping down as chairman in favour of olympic gold medalist and politician <a href="../../../s/e/b/Sebastian_Coe%2C_Baron_Coe_64a6.html" title="Sebastian Coe, Baron Coe">Lord Coe</a>, saying that she felt the bid had reached a stage where his track record in the Olympic movement would be more useful to the bid than her technical and managerial experience. Some commentators felt, however, that her departure had been precipitated by internal politics in the British sports establishment. <a href="../../../p/i/e/Pierre-Yves_Gerbeau_6638.html" title="Pierre-Yves Gerbeau">Pierre-Yves Gerbeau</a>, who she had appointed as the bid's ambassador, quit the effort shortly afterward she stepped down, saying the way Cassani had been treated was "shocking" <a href="http://news.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2004/07/16/noly16.xml" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2004/07/16/noly16.xml" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>.</p>
<p>Cassani stayed on with the bid, serving under Coe as Vice Chairman responsible for technical aspects of the bid. She continued to serve on the board (working unpaid one day per week); the IOC awarded the XXX<sup>th</sup> Olympiad to London on <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_6.html" title="July 6">July 6</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>.</p>
<p>Barbara Cassani married British investment banker Guy Davis in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1985.html" title="1985">1985</a>. The couple have two children, Lauren and James. Lauren plays keyboard in London rock band Feedback. She is a keen <a href="../../../e/q/u/Equestrianism.html" title="Equestrianism">horse rider</a>, and competes in <a href="../../../s/h/o/Showjumping.html" title="Showjumping">showjumping</a> and <a href="../../../d/r/e/Dressage.html" title="Dressage">dressage</a> events. Since stepping down from the Olympic bid Cassani has been working on plans for a new <a href="../../../s/t/a/Startup_company.html" title="Startup company">startup company</a>, and appears as a <a href="http://www.londonspeakerbureau.co.uk/speakers/viewSpeaker.aspx?speakerid=290" class="external text" title="http://www.londonspeakerbureau.co.uk/speakers/viewSpeaker.aspx?speakerid=290" rel="nofollow">business and management speaker</a>on the <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_speaking.html" title="Public speaking">public speaking</a> circuit.</p>
