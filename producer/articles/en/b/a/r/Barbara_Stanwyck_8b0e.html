<p>Barbara Stanwyck was born <b>Ruby Catherine Stevens</b> in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_City_1428.html" title="New York City">New York City</a> to Catherine Ann McPhee, a Canadian immigrant from <a href="../../../n/o/v/Nova_Scotia_7d1d.html" title="Nova Scotia">Nova Scotia</a>, and Byron E. Stevens, an American.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> She was raised in <a href="../../../b/r/o/Brooklyn%2C_New_York_07be.html" title="Brooklyn, New York">Brooklyn, New York</a>. Her mother died when she was four (pregnant at the time, her mother was pushed off a moving trolley by a drunken man), not long before her father abandoned the family. She was raised in foster homes and by an elder sister but began working at age 13, and was a fashion model and <a href="../../../b/r/o/Broadway_theatre.html" title="Broadway theatre">Broadway</a> <a href="../../../s/h/o/Showgirl.html" title="Showgirl">chorine</a> in 1922 at the age of 15.</p>
<p>In 1926, Stanwyck began performing at the Hudson Theatre in the drama <i>The Noose</i> which subsequently became one of the biggest hit plays of the season. She co-starred with actors <a href="../../../r/e/x/Rex_Cherryman_a0b1.html" title="Rex Cherryman">Rex Cherryman</a> and <a href="../../../w/i/l/Wilfred_Lucas_2e4b.html" title="Wilfred Lucas">Wilfred Lucas</a>. Cherryman and Stanwyck began a romantic relationship. The relationship was cut short however, when in 1928 Cherryman died at the age of 30 of septic poisoning while vacationing in <a href="../../../l/e/_/Le_Havre%2C_France_f6d4.html" title="Le Havre, France">Le Havre, France</a>. Barbara's performance in <i>The Noose</i> earned her rave reviews from critics and she was summoned by film producer <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Kane_d0c8.html" title="Bob Kane">Bob Kane</a> to make a screen test for his upcoming 1927 silent film <i>Broadway Nights</i> where she won a minor part of a fan dancer. The film marked Stanwyck's first film appearance.</p>
<p>Her first husband was established actor <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frank_Fay%28U.S.-born%29_da05.html" title="Frank Fay(U.S.-born)">Frank Fay</a>: they were married on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_26.html" title="August 26">August 26</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/2/1928.html" title="1928">1928</a>. On <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_5.html" title="December 5">December 5</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/3/1932.html" title="1932">1932</a> they adopted a son, Dion, who was one month old (Stanwyck eventually became estranged from Dion for reasons which are still not known). The marriage was a troubled one. Fay's successful career on Broadway did not translate to the big screen, whereas Stanwyck achieved <a href="../../../c/i/n/Cinema_of_the_United_States_4fa8.html" title="Cinema of the United States">Hollywood</a> stardom fairly rapidly. Also, Fay reportedly did not shy away from physical confrontations with his young wife, especially when he was inebriated (Some film historians claim that the Fay-Stanwyck marriage was the basis for <i><a href="../../../a/_/s/A_Star_Is_Born_%281937_film%29_b7f0.html" title="A Star Is Born (1937 film)">A Star is Born</a></i>). The couple divorced on <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_30.html" title="December 30">December 30</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/3/1935.html" title="1935">1935</a>.</p>
<p>Stanwyck and actor <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Taylor_%28actor%29_2c1f.html" title="Robert Taylor (actor)">Robert Taylor</a> began living together. Some books have said that Taylor was less in love with Stanwyck than she with him. Their marriage on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_13.html" title="May 13">May 13</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/3/1939.html" title="1939">1939</a> was arranged with the help of the studio, a common practice in Hollywood's golden age. She and Taylor enjoyed their time together outdoors during the early years of their marriage, and were the proud owners of many acres of prime West Los Angeles property. Their large ranch and home in the Mandeville Canyon section of <a href="../../../b/r/e/Brentwood%2C_Los_Angeles%2C_California_6cf5.html" title="Brentwood, Los Angeles, California">Brentwood, Los Angeles, California</a> is still to this day referred to by locals as the old "Robert Taylor ranch".</p>
<p>Taylor was rumored to have had several affairs during the marriage, including one with <a href="../../../a/v/a/Ava_Gardner_f176.html" title="Ava Gardner">Ava Gardner</a>. Stanwyck was rumored to have attempted suicide when she learned of Taylor's fling with <a href="../../../l/a/n/Lana_Turner_e69b.html" title="Lana Turner">Lana Turner</a>. She ultimately filed for divorce in 1950 when a starlet made her romance with Taylor public, the decree being granted on <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_21.html" title="February 21">February 21</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/5/1951.html" title="1951">1951</a>.</p>
<p>After her divorce from Taylor, Stanwyck had several discreet romances including one which was revealed many years later by actor <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Wagner_f42d.html" title="Robert Wagner">Robert Wagner</a>, 23 years her junior.</p>
<p>Whatever her true feelings for Taylor, Stanwyck was reportedly devastated when many of his old letters and photos were lost in a house fire. She never remarried, collecting alimony of 15 percent of Taylor's salary until his death. According to one book, she tried to collect back alimony even after his death from his second wife, Ursula, even while Ursula was struggling with financial problems.</p>
<p>Her <a href="../../../r/e/t/Retirement.html" title="Retirement">retirement</a> years were somewhat active, with charity work done completely out of the limelight, although she became somewhat reclusive following a robbery in her home while she was present; she was pushed into a closet, but suffered no serious injuries.</p>
<p>She died at age 82 of congestive <a href="../../../h/e/a/Heart_disease.html" title="Heart disease">heart disease</a> at her home in <a href="../../../s/a/n/Santa_Monica%2C_California_281b.html" title="Santa Monica, California">Santa Monica, California</a> in 1990.</p>
<p>Stanwyck's younger brother, Byron Stevens, also became an actor in Hollywood (possibly due to his sister's connections) but never found real fame.</p>

<p>In 1926 a friend introduced Stanwyck (then known under her original name) to <a href="../../../w/i/l/Willard_Mack_29f3.html" title="Willard Mack">Willard Mack</a> who was casting his play <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Noose_7558.html" title="The Noose">The Noose</a></i>. Asked to audition, she was cast on the spot. Willard thought a great deal of the actress and believed that to change her image she needed a first class name, one that would stand out. He happened to notice a playbill for a play then running called <i><a href="../../../b/a/r/Barbara_Frietchie_%28play%29_6d6a.html" title="Barbara Frietchie (play)">Barbara Frietchie</a></i> in which an actress named Joan Stanwyck appeared. He used this to come up with "Barbara Stanwyck" as Ruby's new stage name. She was an instant hit and he even re-wrote the script to give her a bigger part.</p>
<p>Stanwyck starred in almost a hundred films during her career and received four nominations for the <a href="../../../a/c/a/Academy_Award_for_Best_Actress_9bf5.html" title="Academy Award for Best Actress">Academy Award for Best Actress</a>: <i><a href="../../../s/t/e/Stella_Dallas_d691.html" title="Stella Dallas">Stella Dallas</a></i> (1937), <i><a href="../../../b/a/l/Ball_of_Fire_1303.html" title="Ball of Fire">Ball of Fire</a></i> (1941), <i><a href="../../../d/o/u/Double_Indemnity_7c4e.html" title="Double Indemnity">Double Indemnity</a></i> (1944), and <i><a href="../../../s/o/r/Sorry%2C_Wrong_Number_1344.html" title="Sorry, Wrong Number">Sorry, Wrong Number</a></i> (1948). In her best films (such as <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Lady_Eve_da13.html" title="The Lady Eve">The Lady Eve</a></i>) she often mixed a worldly toughness (a husky voice, an earthy sense of humor) with heartbreaking vulnerability, particularly in her early <a href="../../../p/r/e/Pre-Code_0581.html" title="Pre-Code">Pre-Code</a> films.</p>
<p>She received an <a href="../../../a/c/a/Academy_Honorary_Award_cf72.html" title="Academy Honorary Award">Academy Honorary Award</a> "for superlative creativity and unique contribution to the art of screen acting" in 1982. In her later years, she also starred in television, notably in the 1960s <a href="../../../w/e/s/Western_%28genre%29.html" title="Western (genre)">western</a> series, <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Big_Valley_ad5c.html" title="The Big Valley">The Big Valley</a></i>. Her last starring role was in 1985, on the TV series <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Colbys_ec8d.html" title="The Colbys">The Colbys</a></i> alongside <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charlton_Heston_4d26.html" title="Charlton Heston">Charlton Heston</a>, <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stephanie_Beacham_616f.html" title="Stephanie Beacham">Stephanie Beacham</a> and <a href="../../../k/a/t/Katharine_Ross_cc28.html" title="Katharine Ross">Katharine Ross</a>.</p>
<p>When Stanwyck's film career declined at age 50 in 1957 she moved to television. Her 1961–1962 series <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Barbara_Stanwyck_Show_5595.html" title="The Barbara Stanwyck Show">The Barbara Stanwyck Show</a></i> was not a ratings success but earned the star her first <a href="../../../e/m/m/Emmy_Award_4d8c.html" title="Emmy Award">Emmy Award</a>. The 1965–1969 series <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Big_Valley_ad5c.html" title="The Big Valley">The Big Valley</a></i> made her one of the most popular actresses on television, winning her another Emmy. Twenty years later, she earned her third Emmy for <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Thorn_Birds_9b85.html" title="The Thorn Birds">The Thorn Birds</a></i>.</p>
<p>Although beloved by her directors and most of her co-workers for her lack of vanity and unprententiousness on film sets, Stanwyck was not without flaws. She was considerably less friendly with her younger female co-stars than the male ones, and was notorious for holding grudges against those who she believed crossed her (like <a href="../../../b/e/t/Bette_Davis_3a1a.html" title="Bette Davis">Bette Davis</a>, with whom she appeared in a movie in 1932). Overall, though, Stanwyck had a reputation as one of the least "difficult" silver screen goddesses.</p>
<p><a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Holden_9ea3.html" title="William Holden">William Holden</a> always credited her with saving his career when they costarred together in <i>Golden Boy.</i> They remained lifelong friends and he paid tribute to her at the 1977 Academy Awards. In 1977 Stanwyck and Holden were presenting the Best Sound Oscar. In a rare example of pure graciousness and sincerity, Holden paused before they presented the Oscar to pay a special tribute to his good friend and acting partner Stanwyck. Stanwyck had no idea the tribute was coming. Holden continued discussing the tribulations that had occurred on the set of the film <i>Golden Boy</i> and said that he owed his career to Stanwyck, who stuck up for him when things looked bad. Stanwyck was overwhelmed by the tribute, and hugged her good friend.</p>
<p>For her contributions to the motion picture industry, Stanwyck has a star on the <a href="../../../h/o/l/Hollywood_Walk_of_Fame_b01f.html" title="Hollywood Walk of Fame">Hollywood Walk of Fame</a> at 1751 Vine Street.</p>
<p>In 1973, she was inducted into the <a href="../../../w/e/s/Western_Performers_Hall_of_Fame_b218.html" title="Western Performers Hall of Fame">Western Performers Hall of Fame</a> at the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Cowboy_%26_Western_Heritage_Museum_ba29.html" title="National Cowboy &amp; Western Heritage Museum">National Cowboy &amp; Western Heritage Museum</a> in <a href="../../../o/k/l/Oklahoma_City%2C_Oklahoma_f1c6.html" title="Oklahoma City, Oklahoma">Oklahoma City, Oklahoma</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li>"During Double Indemnity (1944) Fred MacMurray would go to rushes. I remember asking Fred, 'How was I?' 'I don't know about you - but I was wonderful!' Such a true remark. Actors only look at themselves."</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>"I'm a tough old broad from Brooklyn. I intend to go on acting until I'm ninety and they won't need to paste my face with make-up."</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>"Eyes are the greatest tool in film. Mr Capra taught me that. Sure it's nice to say very good dialogue, if you can get it. But great movie acting - watch the eyes!"</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>"Put me in the last fifteen minutes of a picture and I don't care what happened before. I don't even care if I was IN the rest of the damned thing - I'll take it in those fifteen minutes."</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>"My only problem is finding a way to play my fortieth fallen female in a different way from my thirty-ninth."</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Commenting in 1939 on the fact that her fiancé, Robert Taylor, at 28, was four years younger than she, which raised eyebrows then, Stanwyck said: "The boy's got a lot to learn and I've got a lot to teach."</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>"Its perhaps not the future I would choose. I still think it's possible to make a success of both marriage and career even though I didn't. But its not a bad future. And I'm not afraid of it."</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>"I couldn't remember my name for weeks. I'd be at the theatre and hear them calling 'Miss Stanwyck, Miss Stanwyck,' and I'd think 'Where is that dame? Why doesn't she answer? By crickie, it's me!"</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>"Egotism - usually just a case of mistaken nonentity."</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>"There's nothing more fun in the whole world than seeing a child open a present at Christmas. To have a six-year-old boy stroke a bicycle with his eyes and, not daring to touch, turn and ask, 'is it mine, Missy? Really mine' That's part of my future. The rest is work. And, I hope, some wisdom."</li>
