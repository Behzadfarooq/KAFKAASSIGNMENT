<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/r/Baron.html" title="Edit section: The British Isles">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The British Isles</span></h3>
<p>In the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">British</a> <a href="../../../p/e/e/Peerage.html" title="Peerage">peerage</a> system, <b>barons</b> rank below <a href="../../../v/i/s/Viscount.html" title="Viscount">viscounts</a>, being the lowest rank in the peerage. A female of baronial rank has the honorific <b>baroness</b>. A baron may hold a <b>barony</b> (plural <b>baronies</b>), if the title relates originally to a Feudal Barony by tenure, although such tenure is now obsolete in England and Ireland and any such titles are now held <i><a href="../../../h/e/r/Hereditary_in_gross.html" title="Hereditary in gross">in gross</a></i>, if they survive at all, as very few do, sometimes along with some vestigial manorial rights, or by <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grand_serjeanty.html" title="Grand serjeanty">grand serjeanty</a>.</p>
<p>Outside of the UK, the baronial rank is sometimes confused with the non-peerage title <a href="../../../b/a/r/Baronet.html" title="Baronet">baronet</a>.</p>
<p><a href="../../../w/i/l/William_I_of_England_322d.html" title="William I of England">William I</a> introduced "baron" as a rank into <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a> to distinguish the men who had pledged their loyalty to him (see <a href="../../../f/e/u/Feudalism.html" title="Feudalism">Feudalism</a>). Previously, in the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of England, the king's companions held the title of <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earls.html" title="Earls">earls</a> and in <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scotland.html" title="Scotland">Scotland</a>, the title of <a href="../../../t/h/e/Thegn.html" title="Thegn">thane</a>. All who held their barony "in chief of the king" (that is, directly from William and his successors) became alike <i>barones regis</i> (barons of the king), bound to perform a stipulated service, and welcome to attend his council. Before long, the greatest of the nobles, especially in the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marches.html" title="Marches">marches</a>, such as the <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earl_of_Chester_2397.html" title="Earl of Chester">Earls of Chester</a> or the <a href="../../../b/i/s/Bishop_of_Durham_bc2a.html" title="Bishop of Durham">Bishops of Durham</a>, might refer to their own tenants as "barons", where lesser magnates spoke simply of their "men" (<i>homines</i>).</p>
<p>Initially those who held land direct of the crown by military service, from earls downwards, all alike bore the title of baron, but under <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_II_of_England_0faa.html" title="Henry II of England">Henry II</a>, the <i>Dialogus de Scaccario</i> already distinguished greater (who held <i>in baroniam</i> by knights' service) or lesser baronies (generally smaller single manors). Within a century of the <a href="../../../n/o/r/Norman_Conquest_6c94.html" title="Norman Conquest">Norman Conquest</a>, as in <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Becket_4204.html" title="Thomas Becket">Thomas Becket</a>'s case (1164), there arose the practice of sending to each greater baron a special summons to the council that evolved into the <a href="../../../h/o/u/House_of_Lords_efb8.html" title="House of Lords">House of Lords</a>, while the lesser barons, <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magna_Carta_56fc.html" title="Magna Carta">Magna Carta</a> (1215) stipulated, would receive summons only in general, through the <a href="../../../s/h/e/Sheriff.html" title="Sheriff">sheriffs</a>. Thus appeared a definite distinction, which eventually had the effect of restricting to the greater barons the rights and privileges of peerage.</p>
<p>Later, the sovereign could create a new barony in one of two ways: by a <a href="../../../h/e/r/Hereditary_peer.html#Writs_of_summons" title="Hereditary peer">writ of summons</a> directing someone to <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parliament.html" title="Parliament">Parliament</a>, or by <a href="../../../l/e/t/Letters_patent.html" title="Letters patent">letters patent</a>. Writs of summons featured in medieval times, but creation by letters patent has become the norm. Baronies thus no longer directly relate to land ownership, except in so far as a small number of vestigial "Baron" titles survive in Ireland as incorporeal <a href="../../../h/e/r/Hereditaments.html" title="Hereditaments">hereditaments</a> held in gross as personal rights, following the Modus Tenendi Parliamenta (1419), the Feudal Tenure Act (1662), and the Fines and Recoveries Act (1834) which enabled such titles to be dis-entailed.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scotland.html" title="Scotland">Scotland</a>, the rank of baron is a rank related to feudal nobility of Scotland and refers to a holder of a feudal barony, a feudal superiority over a proper territorial entity erected into a free barony by a Crown Charter, and not a rank of <a href="../../../p/e/e/Peerage.html" title="Peerage">Peerage</a>. The Scottish equivalent of an English baron is a <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lord_of_Parliament_daab.html" title="Lord of Parliament">Lord of Parliament</a>.</p>
<p>In the twentieth century Britain introduced the concept of non-hereditary <a href="../../../l/i/f/Life_peer.html" title="Life peer">life peers</a>. All appointees to this distinction have taken place at the rank of baron. Baronies are often subsidiary titles, thus being used as <a href="../../../c/o/u/Courtesy_titles.html" title="Courtesy titles">courtesy titles</a> by eldest sons.</p>
<p><a name="Style_of_address" id="Style_of_address"></a></p>
<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/r/Baron.html" title="Edit section: Style of address">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Style of address</span></h4>
<p>Non-Scottish barons are styled <i>The Right Honourable The Lord [Barony]</i>. Barons' wives are styled <i>The Right Honourable The Lady [Barony]</i>. Baronesses in their own right are either titled <i>The Right Honourable The Baroness [Barony]</i> or <i>The Right Honourable The Lady [Barony]</i>, mainly based on personal preference (for an example of the former, see <a href="../../../m/a/r/Margaret_Thatcher_2770.html" title="Margaret Thatcher">Margaret Thatcher</a>). <i>Right Honourable</i> is frequently abbreviated to <i>Rt Hon.</i> When referred to by the Sovereign in public instruments, <i>The Right Honourable</i> is changed to <i>Our right trusty and well-beloved</i>, with <i>counsellor</i> attached if they are a <a href="../../../p/r/i/Privy_Council_of_the_United_Kingdom_f410.html" title="Privy Council of the United Kingdom">Privy Counsellor</a>.</p>
<p>Courtesy barons are styled simply <i>Lord [Barony]</i>, and their wives are <i>Lady [Barony]</i>. The style of <i>Right Honourable</i> is not used for them.</p>
<p>Normally one refers to or addresses Baron X as <i>Lord X</i> and his wife as <i>Lady X</i>. In the case of women who hold baronies in their own right, they can be referred to as <i>Baroness X</i> as well as <i>Lady X</i>. In direct address, they can also be referred to as <i>My Lord</i> or <i>My Lady</i>. The husband of a Baroness in her own right does not receive a style. Children of Barons and Baronesses in their own right, whether hereditary or for life, have the style <i>The Honourable [Forename] [Surname]</i>. After the death of the father or mother, the child may continue to use the style <i>Honourable</i>.</p>
<p>Scottish feudal barons style their surnames similarly to Clan Chiefs, with the name of their barony following their name, as in <i>John Smith of Edinburgh</i>. Traditionally this is extended to: <i>John Smith of Edinburgh, Baron of Edinburgh</i>. Their wives are styled <i>Lady Edinburgh</i> or <i>Jane Smith of Edinburgh, Baroness of Edinburgh</i>. Most formally (that is, in writing) they are styled <i>The Much Honourable John Smith of Edinburgh, Baron of Edinburgh</i>.</p>
<p><a name="Coronet" id="Coronet"></a></p>
<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/r/Baron.html" title="Edit section: Coronet">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Coronet</span></h4>
<p>An English Peerage baron is entitled to a <a href="../../../c/o/r/Coronet.html" title="Coronet">coronet</a> bearing six silver balls (or pearls) around the rim. The actual coronet is only worn on certain ceremonial occasions, but a baron can bear his coronet of rank on his <a href="../../../c/o/a/Coat_of_arms.html" title="Coat of arms">coat of arms</a> above the shield.</p>
<p>Scottish feudal barons are entitled to a red cap of maintenance (chapeau) turned up ermine. The chapeau is identical to the red cap worn by an English baron, but without the silver balls or gilt. This is sometimes depicted in armorial paintings between the shield and the helmet. Aditionally, if the baron is the head of a family he may include a chiefly coronet which is similar to a ducal coronet, but with four strawberry leaves.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/r/Baron.html" title="Edit section: Germany">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Germany</span></h3>
<p>In pre-republican <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germany.html" title="Germany">Germany</a> all the knightly families (sometimes distinguished by the prefix "von") eventually were recognised as of baronial rank. Families which had always held this status were called Original Nobility, or <i>Uradel</i>, and were heraldically entitled to a seven pointed coronet. Families which had been ennobled at a definite point in time had only five points on their coronet. These families held their titles from their lord. The holder of an allodial (i.e. free-standing) barony was thus called a <a href="../../../f/r/e/Free_Lord_97e3.html" title="Free Lord">Free Lord</a>, or <i><a href="../../../f/r/e/Freiherr.html" title="Freiherr">Freiherr</a></i>, and its various variations occupied the same rank as a foreign Baron, exclusively (as in the <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holy_Roman_Empire_f314.html" title="Holy Roman Empire">Holy Roman Empire</a>) or concurrently.</p>
<p>Today there is no legal privilege associated with hereditary titles. The offspring of holders of original titles may choose to distinguish themselves from a later-ennobled family by abbreviating "von" as "v.", however, many baron surnames do not contain any such prefix. Generally, all male members of a baronial family inherited the title <i>Baron</i> equally, and were so called from birth. As a result, it was much easier to inherit a German barony than, say, a French or English one, and the title may therefore be considered to rank below even an English baronet, though higher than an armigerous esquire.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/r/Baron.html" title="Edit section: In other languages">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">In other languages</span></h3>
<p>The title was quite common in most European countries, in various languages (whether Germanic, <a href="../../../r/o/m/Romance_language.html" title="Romance language">Romance</a>, <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slavic_language.html" title="Slavic language">Slavonic</a> or other), often in a slightly modified form. The following list includes the male and female forms and (sometimes) the territorial domain. Notice, especially for the 'alternative' Freiherr-type titles, that the existence of a word does not always imply an actual domestic use: it is often a mere rendering of foreign realities.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/r/Baron.html" title="Edit section: Elsewhere">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Elsewhere</span></h2>
<p>Like other major Western noble titles, Baron is sometimes used to render certain titles in non-western languages with their own traditions, even though they are not necessarily historically unrelated and thus hard to compare, which are considered 'equivalent' in relative rank.</p>
<p>This is the case with China's <i>Nan</i> (男), hereditary title of nobility of the fifth rank (男爵), as well as its derivatives and adaptations:</p>
<ul>
<li>the Korean <i>Namjak</i> (男爵) or <i>Chamise</i></li>
<li>the Japanese equivalent <i>Danshaku</i> (男爵)</li>
<li>the Vietnamese equivalent <i>Nam tước</i></li>
