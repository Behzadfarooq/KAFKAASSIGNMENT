<dd>Wow, great work. Amazing. This has never been done before. It all makes much more sense now - what a sad life. The only thing missing would be to mention the part nr. in some of the segments. It seems that I may have missed some parts when she posted them. If this doesn't go into Wikipedia, it should still go into some sort of Barbara Schwarz FAQ.

<dd>Thanks. There are still many gaps. Part numbers, case numbers, the name of the female judge in Washington DC etc need to be added, and other citations may be available on German sites. By her own accounts, she suffered greatly for the scientology cult, and also in its hands with the DPF assignments etc. It is a sad story; her problems appear to have began before her extradition from Denmark and well before the deprogramming attempt by Cyril Vosper. The comments by Linda Simmons Hight seem way out of place since Barbara Schwarz visited the Los Angeles head office more than once, so the cult's desire to disconnect from her is apparent. I hope you might be able to help with some details here: 1. Can you please cite an image URL on Ingo Heinemann's site where he posted one of the anti psychiatry advertisements in which Barbara Schwarz was mentioned or which she composed? (I stumbled on it on the site somewhere, but didn't keep the URL and I have to read German via a translation bot, but you'll find it in 5 seconds). He apparently also also offered to be her guardian after the Danish extradiction. 2. Is her ex husband Juergen Schwarz the treasurer or other official in German scientology? There is a Juergen Schwarz mentioned in some scientology cases written in German that I've found via Google searches, but their translation program is clunky; for some reason, one expression in German is translated by the bot as "sparking wine", heh. 3. There was also a meeting she attended with Peter Gauweiler, then head of the KVR in Munich. Do they or he keep a website where scientology is mentioned? Hope you can help. <a href="../../../o/r/s/User%7EOrsini_2b01.html" title="User:Orsini">Orsini</a> 18:07, 31 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Part 92 has a revelation about the civil submarine.
<blockquote>
<p><i>I had flash backs suddenly of my former life as child in the USA. It happened after my lunatic German neighbor throw me down some chairs. Interesting, instead of crying, this brutal event opened a curtain. Istood up from the ground and I suddenly saw the Great Salt Lake before my eyes. I knew I was there before, and I was able to draw a blueprint of a village of that civil submarine. I also remembered that Marty must have been from there and that I was not just married to him in this lifetime but that I knew him as a little boy, and that we both played with each other in that village.</i></p>
</blockquote>
Has anyone seen references to the civil submarine village anywhere else in her diaries? Is it possible that she sustained a brain injury when her neighbor threw her down a flight of stairs(which I assume is what she meant by chairs)? I don't mean any offense but she had to be more coherent than she is now when she was elected to be the President of the Scientologist s in Germany. Regardless of your view of Scientologists, it's hard to imagine them electing a woman who claims to be L. Ron Hubbard's daughter, and the paternal granddaughter of General Eisenhower born in a civil submarine in Utah. If this recollection came after a case of serious head trauma could this explain why her behavior is so irrational without the mental illness label she and other Scientologists reject? As I understand it and I could be wrong; Though they reject psychoanalysis, Scientologists do believe in things like brain cancer, strokes, and actual physical damage to the brain, thus allowing her to possibly seek help from a neurologist? <a href="../../../a/n/y/User%7EAnynobody_bd2c.html" title="User:Anynobody">Anynobody</a> 11:39, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline"><a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> guidlines</span></h2>
<p>I saw this article listed on the <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLPN_8a63.html" title="WP:BLPN">BLP noticeboard</a>, but you didn't mention any specific concerns, so I will just make a general recommendation that editors carefully read <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">Biographies of Living Persons</a>. Any negative information in Wikipedia that is about a living person must adhere to these rules, which are much more stringent than the general guidelines. Negative info must be solidly sourced with secondary unbiased reliable sources, (primary sources are ok to bolster a secondary source, but should not be used in lieu of secondary sources). Also, no original research is allowed, which means basically that you cannot draw a conclusion in an article that the sources do not overtly draw for you. For instance, if a news article states that cats have been reported missing from the area around Jane Doe's house, and another news article reports that cat bones have been discovered in Jane Doe's garbage cans, the wiki article cannot state that Jane Doe eats cats. You can only report a summation of the facts of the news articles. <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> rules also strictly apply. <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrockspot_fd90.html" title="User:Crockspot">Crockspot</a> 21:01, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Crockspot, we are familiar with the rules and the previous article and discussion here have laid out numerous sources for each of the claims made in the article.

<p>Meant to add before, the BLP guidelines also offer advice on dealing with the person who is the subject of an article, and dealing with articles about yourself, which could be useful here.

<dd>The person that is the subject of the article is banned from participating in Wikipedia, so there really isn't a problem with dealing with her anymore.

<dd>Well, that is understandable, but the claims that are solely those of Ms. Schwarz are clearly highlighted as being from her. Mr. Bauder that it would be appropriate to include more information that explained Ms. Schwarz's side of the story. I think the problem is that "her side of the story" doesn't do anything to make her views look any less absurd. In any case, the Usenet articles were added specifically to have more information to explain the "other side" of the issue since people claimed that the previous versions were one-sided. <a href="../../../v/i/v/User%7EVivaldi_8033.html" title="User:Vivaldi">Vivaldi</a> (<a href="../../../v/i/v/User_talk%7EVivaldi_d6d0.html" title="User talk:Vivaldi">talk</a>) 23:06, 3 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>A couple of items may need attention, although it may be nitpicking: 1. In the FOIA request heading, changing it from "frivolous lawsuits" to litigation history". (Yes, the much of the litigation <i>was</i> frivolous, but removing the word itself in the heading nulls any accusations of bias or POV.) 2. <i>A government official</i> called her lawsuits <i>frivolous</i>; perhaps the name the official can be cited.

<dd>There was no mention of the deprogramming or any discussion of it, until I brought it up with secondary sources. Note that about half of the editors involved in this article present a lot of anti-scientology discussion and it is well known that a many of the notable anti-scientologists supported deprogramming in the past and it makes me wonder why they would want to overlook this criminal deprogramming incident on Barbara Schwarz. And then there's the claim of "record holder". Barbara Schwarz has a high number of FOIA requests, but we don't know if it is a "record number". Neutrality is off because there is much more to be written about, if editors are going to use her USENET posting as a primary source, but only certain parts of her story seem to have been cherry picked. --<a href="../../../h/r/e/User%7EHResearcher_0608.html" title="User:HResearcher">HResearcher</a> 16:12, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Which editors want to "overlook this criminal deprogramming incident"? I haven't seen anyone that suggested that it be overlooked. And certainly this can't be a reason for the continued inclusion of a NPOV tag, since the article now mentions the deprogramming incident. I believe that HResearcher is making this accusation in bad faith, much as he made the accusation (in numerous places on Wikipedia) that I was cherry-picking information from Usenet to put in this article, when I hadn't even made a single edit to the article at all. The Usenet claims where added by ArbCom member and admin, Fred Bauder, because he felt they gave the subject an opportunity to explain her side of the story. <a href="../../../v/i/v/User%7EVivaldi_8033.html" title="User:Vivaldi">Vivaldi</a> (<a href="../../../v/i/v/User_talk%7EVivaldi_d6d0.html" title="User talk:Vivaldi">talk</a>) 19:58, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Your constant discussion about the contents of the article and your attempt to add <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> (the alleged "documents" in "boxes" in Germany) proves that you consider her notable. --<a href="../../../t/i/l/User%7ETilman_2a94.html" title="User:Tilman">Tilman</a> 15:31, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I've never claimed to be neutral. I know Barbara and the only reason I have had anything to do with her article is because she mentioned it to me and I told her I would try to get it removed. I think I said that on my first post, or if not soon after. The only thing I have done* is try to bring it to the attention of people so they can judge if it should be here according to Wikipedia policy. That's for them to decide, not me. There do seem to be wide differences of opinion here about what Wikipedia should or shouldn't be. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_Dufour_1d44.html" title="User:Steve Dufour">Steve Dufour</a> 01:12, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't know Steve Dufour. I came across this article because I was commenting on another BLP. My pet peeve is the inclusion and researching of basically non-notable people and including them on Wikipedia. This, to me, is a large invasion of privacy that I don't understand. If the government were doing this work it would be almost criminal. Yet, there are people who do it for nothing. Almost every person on the planet is notable for something. Their "15 minutes of fame" is not a reason for a permanent inclusion on Wikipedia and every detail of their life. The Notability guideline is in place so that non-famous people can maintain a semblance of privacy. Filing lawsuits or being a Scientologist or a victim of a crime does not make her notable or encyclopedic. More like a spectacle. --<a href="../../../t/b/e/User%7ETbeatty_05ec.html" title="User:Tbeatty">Tbeatty</a> 19:44, 4 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I wish you would have taken the time to read the discussion. Barbara has been featured in at least six news articles. And she's a legend in FOIA circles.

<dd>Those 6 articles do not automatically mean she is notable. I think you're referring to 6 articles over the last 20 years. That is NOT very frequenst and does not establish notability. She is not a legend in FOIA circles, she is a legend to a few FOIA workers who have been involved working on her requests. It doesn't matter what jokes they make about her, that doesn't establish her notability. And some other things that are notable, you simply ignored for a year. And now I'm trying to dig up the references on her involuntary psychiatric detainment/abuse, which is also HIGHLY notable, but I get opposition from you on this even though I'm just considering the idea until I get the references. You wouldn't even use her as a primary source to mention this "alleged" psychiatric abuse. --<a href="../../../h/r/e/User%7EHResearcher_0608.html" title="User:HResearcher">HResearcher</a> 16:44, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Fred, that would probably be the easiest thing to do. I agree with Steve Dufour and Tbeatty. Just look at the article. BIG DEAL. Makes you wonder why she's even here in Wikipedia. And then there's the ignorance of the deprogramming which was simply overlooked for more than a year, yet that is something more notable about her. Anti-scientology people seem to like to ridicule Barbara Schwarz and try to make her as some kind of poster-girl to warn against Scientology. It's like using Osama Bin Laden to attack Muslims. I think this article should be severly scrutinized and researched and if the editors don't want to do a good job, then it should just be deleted. --<a href="../../../h/r/e/User%7EHResearcher_0608.html" title="User:HResearcher">HResearcher</a> 16:20, 6 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You keep commenting on the deprogramming attempt in late 1987, yet you haven't commented on Schwarz's visit to Los Angeles in 1984, where she underwent some kind of scientology process that (by Schwarz's own published accounts) led to her mother filing a penal complaint in Germany about her daughter's experience in the hands of the scienologists. <a href="../../../o/r/s/User%7EOrsini_2b01.html" title="User:Orsini">Orsini</a> 16:49, 6 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, the deprogramming attempt, which is supported by secondary sources. I have no reason to comment on Schwarz' visit to LA in 1984, I haven't found any reliable secondary sources. Besides, according to Barbara's story, her mother was wrong to file a penal complaint, the scientologists didn't do anything wrong to her. Barbara says it is infiltrators that cause the problems. Have you any silk purses to discuss or are you only attracted to sow's ears?

Public Matters<br />
Getting public records from the feds has grown more difficult, but new efforts hope to increase access<br />
(...)<br />
While it is true that FOIAs sometimes net critical information, like the recently released FBI files on John Lennon, for instance, which took years to gather, there are those who have used the law for somewhat less socially important reasons since its enactment in 1967.<br />
In fact, the person who holds the record for the most FOIAs filed is Barbara Schwarz of Salt Lake City, a former president of the Church of Scientology of Germany in the early 1980s. Schwarz, according to the online encyclopedia Wikipedia, was trying to find information confirming her suspicions that she was the daughter of Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard and the granddaughter of Dwight D. Eisenhower.<br />
According to a 2003 report in The Salt Lake Tribune, Schwarz “carpet-bombed” federal agencies with thousands of FOIA requests, followed by dozens of follow-up lawsuits (one containing 2,307 pages, naming 3,087 defendants). Schwarz also liked filing lawsuits with the U.S. Supreme Court; 35 separate certiorari petitions to the high court, all of them eventually dismissed.<br />
But absent Schwarz’s seemingly frivolous legal challenges, “There’s no question that over the last several years, this administration … has been particularly good at making it more difficult to get information and releasing less information when it comes to the Freedom of Information Act,” said journalism professor Wendell Cochran of American University School of Communication in Washington, D.C.<br />

<p>Wikipedia can live without the article, Barbara Schwarz objects to the article. Why not removing the entire article and get it over with? Jimbo can make the decision. I don't like the postings on Usenet saying that Wikipedia drives her into suicide and neither her legal threats. She may have lost the pro se cases but she might not lose when she goes to an attorney. A handful of people, who have a personal dislike of hers and want to attack her on Wikipedia. We should not allow this. If they want to battle, they should do it on Usenet. That story might not have a happy ending for anybody involved.

She already lost her battle on this topic with the Salt Lake City Tribune and a judge ruled that there was no libel. And since Ms. Schwarz participated willingly with the newspaper, knowing full-well that a newspaper reporter is someone that publishes things in a publicly read newspaper. It is patently absurd to suggest that Ms. Schwarz deserves any sort of privacy now. She helped create her own publicity by knowingly participating in an interview. She just wasn't happy with the result she received. Too bad.

<dd>Tbeatty, no one will be spending a cent on legal fees about this article. No attorney is going to take on a contingency case which is certain to be lost. Fred Bauder mentioned the matter of malice, and there's no evidence of it; regardless, she still needs to provide evidence for her allegations and she's comprehensively failed to do so in any of her FOIA court filings. Have you read all the contents of this talk page and the three AfDs yet? <a href="../../../o/r/s/User%7EOrsini_2b01.html" title="User:Orsini">Orsini</a> 18:29, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As others have pointed out, she doesn't need grounds to sue. I, personally, wouldn't want to defend myself in a frivolous lawsuit. I doubt wikimedia wants to defend itself especially on a spectacle article. Also, the decision cited by the 3 judge panel protecting the Tribune may not protect Wikimedia because it would be difficult to prove that 1) this is journalism when the whole premise is that it's an encyclopedia 2) that the journalists (i.e. editors) are disinterested. If she has had a negative relationship with just one editor here she can overcome the disinterested requirement. She doesn't have to prove both, just one. The other thing to keep in mind is that the SLC Tribune was writing a <i>story</i> that ran for one day about a figure in their community. Wikipedia is writing a biography that is available to the world forever. There is a HUGE difference that cannot be overlooked. She may be notable for the SLC Tribune paper as a local celebrity but she is not notable enough for a Wikipedia Encyclopedia article. --<a href="../../../t/b/e/User%7ETbeatty_05ec.html" title="User:Tbeatty">Tbeatty</a> 02:14, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Tbeatty, first off, you are making arguments based on faulty premises. 1) She is not and was not just a local SLC celebrity. The <a href="../../../a/s/s/Associated_Press_9ff2.html" title="Associated Press">Associated Press</a> wrote an article about her that was published in many papers outside the state of Utah. The United States Supreme Court specifically mentions her in an important decision by the court (which actually had one justice dissenting), that permanently barred her from filling more frivilous claims. The U.S. Department of Justice specifically cites her as being the #1 filer of FOIA requests. There are numerous memos by FEDERAL agencies showing the prolific FOIA requester Ms. Schwarz is permanently barred from future FOIA requests. Ms. Schwarz was also listed in two books regarding her deprogramming from Scientology. 2) That she is not notable enough for a wikipedia article has been argued here 3 times and the overwhelming majority of people disagree with you. <a href="../../../v/i/v/User%7EVivaldi_8033.html" title="User:Vivaldi">Vivaldi</a> (<a href="../../../v/i/v/User_talk%7EVivaldi_d6d0.html" title="User talk:Vivaldi">talk</a>) 05:04, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree with all of Tbeatty's points. Pro se cases are usually not successfully for anybody. It all depends on the lawyer. If she goes shopping for one, she might find one sooner or later. I noticed that she is indigent. That could slow the process down but there are also activist lawyers who might take her case for free. I know that this article was up for deletion, three times. Problem is that those who have an axe to grind with her call their Usenet friends for help, who also oppose her religion. That's why we don't get rid of the article. Wikipedia should not become a 2nd usenet. Remove the article without a vote. Wikipedia needs money. Legal defense costs money. -- <a href="../../../s/u/m/User%7ESummertimeblues_b73d.html" title="User:Summertimeblues">User: Summertimeblues</a> 7:25, 4 September 2006 11:28 <small>note: this comment was really added by <a href="../../../s/u/m/User%7ESummertimeBlues_0a3c.html" title="User:SummertimeBlues">SummertimeBlues</a> (<a href="../../../s/u/m/User_talk%7ESummertimeBlues_98e6.html" title="User talk:SummertimeBlues">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_SummertimeBlues_9587.html" title="Special:Contributions/SummertimeBlues">contribs</a>) and not <a href="../../../s/u/m/User%7ESummertimeblues_b73d.html" title="User:Summertimeblues">Summertimeblues</a> (talk <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Summertimeblues_bebe.html" title="Special:Contributions/Summertimeblues">contribs</a>).</small> Note: This user is a blocked user of Wikipedia, being a sockpuppet of Ms. Schwarz</dd>

An attorney taking on Schwarz's case is going to look extremely foolish when her own unclean hands are presented to the court as evidence of her own malice, and it would be grounds for a summary dismissal of that case and a SLAPP / harassment countersuit against that "activist lawyer". <a href="../../../o/r/s/User%7EOrsini_2b01.html" title="User:Orsini">Orsini</a> 06:37, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>From the content of your information, I strongly assume you are no attorney, Orsini, as otherwise you would not write such a nonsense. I found absolutely no message of B. Schwarz in these talk pages, which means that you can't accuse her of malice but we might be all forced to reveal our identities to a judge. Are you willing to do that? A judge will ask who threw the first stone, who started the dispute, and was that really her? Did she write that stub on her article? I doubt it. I know you don't like her nor her "religious group" but you really should take your fights to Usenet. They are not good for Wikipedia. And who would pay the legal bills? You?</dd>

<dd>Barbara Schwarz, a key fact here is <b>you</b> do not have any law degree and you've never won any case you've filed in the United States courts. The administrators can see where you've violated Wikipedia policy in the archived talk pages, and those pages will be the first to appear in front of a court if you are foolish enough to attempt to follow through with your legal threats. You have violated Wikipedia policy and were banned for it, and you have returned to Wikipedia under a sockpuppet, which is another violation of policy. These facts will count against you, and your own sockpuppet identities would also be revealed if you were to proceed. I have also noticed your postings on the Usenet where you have viciously smeared and libeled people with your false and misleading allegations, your hate campaigns against Wikipedia and the editors of this article, your pleas for an attorney to sue Wikipedia, and your pleas to cause Wikipedia financial harm. I also suspect you know the person using an anonymous remailer on the Usenet in an attempt to intimidate and smear Fred Bauder when he did not do as you wanted. Bear in mind your own posts would be cause for summary dismissal of any vexatious lawsuit you might attempt to file. <a href="../../../o/r/s/User%7EOrsini_2b01.html" title="User:Orsini">Orsini</a> 20:57, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Wikipedia does not grant free speech to everyone. There are a number of rules that regulate not only the kind of speech that is acceptable here, but also there are rules that regulate who can contribute to Wikipedia at all. People are often banned for violating these rules. Namely, Ms. Schwarz was blocked because she has stated that she has made legal threats and because she has consistently ignored warnings to avoid making personal comments about editors. (e.g. She tries to reveal what she believes to be the real names of anonymous editors). Ms. Schwarz is under the misguided notion that private entities such as Wikipedia are required to grant everyone equal access to their forums. This is clearly not a requirement of the 1st Amendment. Private groups can, and do, decide who can contribute and what they can contribute. Ms. Schwarz is free to publish and say what she wants, but she must do so in forums that are willing to publish her views or in places that are designated for public speech. <a href="../../../v/i/v/User%7EVivaldi_8033.html" title="User:Vivaldi">Vivaldi</a> (<a href="../../../v/i/v/User_talk%7EVivaldi_d6d0.html" title="User talk:Vivaldi">talk</a>) 21:36, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I thought that the fact that she has a German last name, was president of the CoS in Germany, and moved to Utah together gave people the information without taking space up. (It sounds stupid in Tilman's article too, but he thinks that he speaks English better than me. &#160;:-) ) the one and only <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_Dufour_1d44.html" title="User:Steve Dufour">Steve Dufour</a> 06:09, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>She is too notable for being a German citizen. The U.S. court of appeals and the Salt Lake Tribune both thought that her German citizenry was important. The SLC Tribune had a particular problem with illegal immigrants, like Ms. Schwarz, having access to FOIA requests. <a href="../../../v/i/v/User%7EVivaldi_8033.html" title="User:Vivaldi">Vivaldi</a> (<a href="../../../v/i/v/User_talk%7EVivaldi_d6d0.html" title="User talk:Vivaldi">talk</a>) 06:12, 5 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You block a person of who you think it was Ms. Schwarz and then you ask Ms. Schwarz questions, knowing that she can't answer? Do you have just courage if she isn't around? Why do you hate her that much? Perhaps you should do some therapy. I think you do religious profiling.</dd>
<dd>There is something like dual citizenship. That means that a person can have two or even more citizenships. It is possible that Ms. Schwarz returned her German citizenship or makes no use of it. I read Ms. Schwarz' Tribune affidavit and a number of postings. What you claim is not honest. She posted that she had a very suspicious German birth certificate, concealing the place in which she was born. I think the place of birth is very important to a birth certificate. Also, she may have not just one citizenship. I also checked that CIA case out. She complained that she was not heard by that court. As she was not heard, the judges hardly could determine citizenships.JohnPowers <i>This edit was actually made by <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnPower_b27a.html" title="User:JohnPower">User:JohnPower</a>, not User:JohnPowers.</i></dd>

In one point only, you are correct; it's possible you have dual citizenship, and this is why the "illegal alien" label must not go into the article. There is no independent evidence to state you are a US citizen, however holding of a German birth certificate means you are certainly a German citizen, no matter where you were born. 3. You are wrong; the case summary for <a href="http://www.kscourts.org/ca10/cases/1999/05/99-4016.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.kscourts.org/ca10/cases/1999/05/99-4016.htm" rel="nofollow">Schwarz v CIA, No. 99-4016 (D.

<dd>1: "where a child born to German parents acquires another citizenship at birth":<br />
Barbara claims that her father was L.Ron Hubbard, not a German Citizen, and her mother was an American as well. (From her posts.) If her claims are viewed as fictional, then she was born in Germany of German parents (hence her birth certificate), also not meeting this guide. So this doesn't fit.<br />
2: "where a German citizen acquires a foreign nationality with the permission of the German government",<br />
If you accept Barbara's view, then she never was a German citizen, hence the German government would not be granting her permission. If you don't accept Barbara's view, then she would have had to apply for permission to be granted a dual US citizenship, and that is something she has said she didn't do because she has been claiming that she really was a US citizen all along. U.S. citizens cannot, IIRC, apply for U.S. citizenship. She has stated a few times that she gave up trying "to get the INS to change her status."<br />
3: "where a naturalised German citizen, or a child born to non-German parents in Germany, obtains permission to keep their foreign nationality"<br />
She hasn't made any claims of getting permission from the U.S. government to be granted a German citizenship, either, and IIRC, the U.S. government does not do that.<br />
So, before people start beating the drum: This is the "discussion" page, not the article page, and no, you cannot prove a negative, no matter how much some of the posters here keep insisting on having someone do so (e.g. "prove she never won a case" Well, you can only prove she HAS won a case, not that she has never won one.) -- [Darn, meant to hit preview, hit save instead.] <a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESuper7_252b.html" title="User:Super7">Super 7 - Everything else is just transport</a> 13:29, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">What do we know really? Is it really possible?</span></h2>
<p>We should put ourselves in he shoes of Wikipedia readers, who will ask, how is it possible that one single person filed so many actions in just a few years? How many heads and hands does this woman have to keep track of it all? The Salt Lake Tribune article is very confusing. It says that she filed thousands of FOIA requests. But in order to file them to court, she needed to exhaust her administrative remedies, e.g. administrative appeals. That means that she must have filed also thousands of administrative appeals. Another example are these many law suits. Fred is an attorney, he knows how much time goes in just one law suit, you got legal research and that goes back and forth. The First Amendment Center, reporter Chris Hamby interviewed a lawyer who opposed some of her cases. He said that Ms. Schwarz handled her cases better than many attorneys. The Tribune wrote that she has no legal training. How was she able handle her cases better than an attorney without legal training? How did she do it? Tribune reporter Smith refused answering ANY question of the First Amendment Center, Chris Hamby. Why? It is suspicious. Reporters usually help each other out. These are some of the questions that Wikipedia reader will ask. - My point is, as more as I read about Ms. Schwarz on Wikipedia, as less I have the feeling to know her. It is better having no article on her than a very confusing one, or one that is written mainly by the people who hate her religion. Wikipedians are not allowed to make own research but a personal biographer might be necessary to figure Ms. Schwarz and her activities out. And I don't think that the average person would buy a biography written by the usual Usenet folks who come in swarms to Wikipedia to stink it up. We should admit that we know mainly rumors about Ms. Schwarz and this harms Wikipedia's reputation. The best decision is for Jumbo to delete the article and wait how for real research and in what direction the Schwarz-life might develop. <a href="../../../s/u/m/User%7ESummertimeBlues_0a3c.html" title="User:SummertimeBlues">SummertimeBlues</a> 5 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well Fred, all people involved in this discussion, except you and Mr. Dufour, are sworn enemy of Ms. Schwarz' religion. If I am not very much mistaken, Chris Owen, wrote an infammatory book/articles against her religion. He should not block but recuse himself. It leaves a very bad impression to readers. Chris Owens and these other guys are too deep in their own private wars to think straight. Vivaldi knows to what admin to run when he wants people blocked who doesn't hate Ms. Schwarz or her religion. It is a shame.

<p>Barbara is noteable (as discussed under many other headings) because of her relationship with the CoS (and as an excelent case of becoming a non-person when it suits them) and her unique relationship with the various branches in the government (both local and national) as a result of her FOIA activities and many frivilous law suits.</p>
<p>That said, I have to question if she really does deserve to have her own page, or should the information be folded into other pages, like the one referenced above, where she could even have her own (sub-sub-)section, or <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freedom_of_Information_Act_%28United_States%29_01fc.html" title="Freedom of Information Act (United States)">Freedom of Information Act (United States)</a> where she is mentioned in the "See also" section. Maybe the FOIA page needs a bit more structure so that it includes, not only the three major cases listed, but a small section on other noteable requests and related litigation.</p>
<p>I'm not a friend of hers (she has threatened me with law suits more than once), but I have to question her having her own page. The information should not be lost, but, maybe it should be folded into other, more focused, pages.</p>

<dd>Super 7, I think there is enough hard data for Barbara Schwarz having a separate article. The reasons for her notability (FOIA, scientology, deprogramming, and litigation in relation to the <a href="../../../s/c/o/SCOTUS_92d6.html" title="SCOTUS">SCOTUS</a>) are diverse, and a footnote or merge into other articles fragments the data. In your Google searching, did you look for 'Schwarz', or "Barbara Schwarz", or 'Schwarz FOIA'? Did you search for an exact phrase or search for the words separately? Results can vary greatly depending on the method, as you know. The "B" class designation of this article could mean there are still a lot of gaps; however there is plenty of source data which has not yet been incorporated into the article. <a href="../../../o/r/s/User%7EOrsini_2b01.html" title="User:Orsini">Orsini</a> 04:38, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Super7: We've already gone through the notability discussion issue a number of times, we needn't keep having to have this discussion every two weeks. Notability was specifically brought up as a reason for deletion in AfDs #1 through #3 -- each of which resulted in a consensus to keep this article right where it is. Your specific test showing that a search for "Schwarz" does not result in a hit for "Barbara Schwarz" is not a useful test for determining notability especially when talking about inclusion for an encyclopedia. Its entirely possible that notable people worthy of inclusion have common names, such as Schwarz or Smith or Johnson and because they have such a common name, there may exist a number of other even more famous and notable people with the same. <a href="../../../v/i/v/User%7EVivaldi_8033.html" title="User:Vivaldi">Vivaldi</a> (<a href="../../../v/i/v/User_talk%7EVivaldi_d6d0.html" title="User talk:Vivaldi">talk</a>) 11:18, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Super7: Try doing these searches in Google, which may be more enlightening because they include the terms for endeavors for which she is notable: "Schwarz FOIA", "Schwarz Scientology", "Schwarz deprogramming", "Schwarz Rathbun", "Schwarz frivolous", "Schwarz Usenet". Now does Barbara's name pop up? I haven't even checked them out, but I'd almost bet the she is a top ten entry in her fields of notability. <a href="../../../v/i/v/User%7EVivaldi_8033.html" title="User:Vivaldi">Vivaldi</a> (<a href="../../../v/i/v/User_talk%7EVivaldi_d6d0.html" title="User talk:Vivaldi">talk</a>) 11:08, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">This is a very confusing article</span></h2>
<p>My radio audience wouldn't let me come away with this. Barb Schwarz is cited here of having said this and that, while she doesn't say so on Usenet. She also is blocked to participate in the discussion around her own person (big nono in the professional field of journalism) and accused of being any new contributor on Wikipedia. It makes the impression that the article is so uninteresting that nobody wants to read it or paticipate here, except the wrongfully portayed Ms.Schwartz. I am no fan of Scientology but this kind of hostility against individual Scientologists goes much too far. It is not good for Wikipedia. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadioHost_ac07.html" title="User:RadioHost">RadioHost</a> (<a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadioHost_2232.html" title="User talk:RadioHost">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_RadioHost_564f.html" title="Special:Contributions/RadioHost">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<dd>I'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt and assume you're not Ms Schwarz. First of all, Babs DID have the right to come here and give her side of the story. She then proceeded to violate a few Wikipedia policies, and so was banned until apologising and promising to not violate them any more. She has decided to not do that, and so is still banned. She tried, in vain, to pervert the discussion by sockpuppetting on a quite enormous level. She can come back any time she wants - she just has to agree to not harass, attack, threaten with legal action, etc. Babs HAS said everything that is attributed to her - check out her 92-page extravaganza on USENET (which she readily admits to have writing, which is stored for all eternity on a number of sources across the internet, all cross-referenceable). May I suggest doing some cursory research before claiming the entire article is bunk? And remember - this is no radio, a newspaper, a bathroom wall, etc. This is wikipedia.

<p>In the sentence: "She says that she later married a prominent Scientologist who she claims was imprisoned on the false charge of having killed her." I changed "killed" to "murdered".

<dd>Well, since she is alive, she claims that he is being <i>wrongly</i> held for her murder. She of course is his only relief witness.

Now that <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marty_Rathbun_8c5c.html" title="Marty Rathbun">Marty Rathbun</a> has gone missing, I am kind of worried that he might be dead now.

<dd>Trödel took the correct action to remove the emotive term "murder" and restore it to "killed".

<dd>I agree that it's a minor point. The reason I thought "murder" was a better word to use is that it is not always a crime to kill someone. It could be done in self defense.

<dd>The first three theories are actually better at explaining the evidence than the fourth -- plenty of people have gotten tired of Scientology and decided to leave it behind and become private people, but few have done so so completely that no one knows where they are or whether they're even still alive. If he <i>is</i> still alive, and his departure from the presidency of RTC (how many organizations make <i>no</i> statement when their president suddenly leaves?) was voluntary, it seems like "gone into hiding" is more accurate than "become a private person". -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 15:38, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Faking hit-and-run accidents to sabotage political careers? Framing journalists for bomb threats that never happened, including the utilization of impersonators staging nervous breakdowns in laundromats? The CoS has done it. As for blackmail, well, what <i>do</i> you think all those supposedly confidential auditing records are collected in writing for? According to numerous former members -- not to mention according to GO 121669, written by Mary Sue Hubbard -- they're for keeping members and former members in line if they ever pose any perceived danger to the organization. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 23:42, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Barb Schwarz never wrote that Mr. Rathbun is a bigamist. The problem is that people pick data from her life story and twist it to cause her and Mr. Rathbun harm. These articles on all living persons should be deleted as these kind of reportings on Mark Rathbun, Barbara Schwarz, or others, destroy lives. Both have right to privacy. The former Scientology speaker, Linda Simmons Hight should be found (she disappeared into thin air) and asked if she still stands to her defamatory statement about Ms. Schwarz. I doubt that she does. Wikipedia editors are living in the delusion that they have a right to exploit and destroy private lives with rumors and lies and come away with it. There a thousand rumors about these two individuals but also others, and it comes down to that Wikipedia editors really do not know these people. My advice to Wikipedia contributors/editors/admins: go for quality and not quantity, and stop hurting people and harassing people on Wikipedia. Wikipedia has no right to publish the photograph of Mr. Rathbun either. I learned it is a copyright violation.</dd>

<p>I don't think he is a bigamist either. It is only when his article talks about two possible wives some people might get that idea. I will see if I can change it a little.

<dd>Steve, I remember clearly that Barbara Schwarz posted on Usenet that she is convinced that there are two Marty Rathbun in Scientology and that they are being mixed up in one person on Wikipedia. Mark Rathbun is maybe not such a common name as John Smith but it is not rare either. Just in any major city in the USA, you find one or more Mark Rathbun's. -- L.M. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikisicki_fe48.html" title="User:Wikisicki">Wikisicki</a> (<a href="../../../w/i/k/User_talk%7EWikisicki_0e02.html" title="User talk:Wikisicki">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wikisicki_27f3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wikisicki">contribs</a>) 19:18, 13 February 2007 (UTC).</small></dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Added link to 2002 dismissal</span></h2>
<p>Judge John D. Bates' dismissed a series of Ms. Schwarz's lawsuits on September 24, 2002. In his summary one can find a basic summary of what she wants to know and how she believes the government is working against her. I put it as the first link because it seems to provide verifiable information that her litigation has been overwhelming, in one case there were over 400 defendants. Though it mentions nothing of her alleging she had married Mr. Rathbun, so perhaps that should be removed or verfied. <a href="../../../a/n/y/User%7EAnynobody_bd2c.html" title="User:Anynobody">Anynobody</a> 22:49, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I was able to verify that she did at one point claim to be married to Mr. Rathbun at this link <a href="http://www.kscourts.org/ca10/cases/1999/05/99-4016.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.kscourts.org/ca10/cases/1999/05/99-4016.htm" rel="nofollow">99-4016 -- Schwarz v.

Since this case also illustrates her claims, and serves to verify some of the information in the article I've also included it in the links section. <a href="../../../a/n/y/User%7EAnynobody_bd2c.html" title="User:Anynobody">Anynobody</a> 02:26, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
