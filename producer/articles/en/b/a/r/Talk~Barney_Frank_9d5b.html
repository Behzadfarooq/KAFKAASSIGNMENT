<p>Re [User:Adam Carr]'s question. Googling for</p>
<dl>
<dd>"Barney Frank" biography Harvard</dd>
</dl>
<p>shows several entries all specifying Harvard <i>College</i>.</p>
<p>Harvard <i>College</i> is the undergraduate institution. I am <i>not</i> an expert on this, but I believe that those who complete the undergraduate program receive their degrees from Harvard <i>College.</i> I don't think there is such a thing as "graduating from Harvard University." You can only graduate from Harvard College, Harvard Law School, etc. And I think Harvard graduates are particular about this. (Though not as particular as graduates of Dartmouth College!)</p>
<p>So I'm changing it back, because I'm pretty sure that Harvard <i>College</i> is correct, and that whoever edited it originally was just being punctilious.</p>
<p>(In other words, no, I don't think it's any sort of subtle deprecation of Barney Frank!)</p>
<p>I could well be wrong (and it's certainly not worth having an edit war over), bu that's what I think. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> 16:17, 30 Nov 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>I am happy to take your word for it. I have always assumed that Harvard was Harvard University. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 00:27, 1 Dec 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>Barney Frank's office only accepts emails from constituents (and I don't want to lie about my address!) but I've sent an email to the president of Harvard inquiring on this point... it will be interesting to see whether I get an answer. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> 02:06, 1 Dec 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>It might be better if the article just says he was "educated at <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harvard_University_9346.html" title="Harvard University">Harvard</a>", because a lot of people are going to assume that Harvard College is wrong - it certainly <i>looks</i> wrong. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 02:22, 1 Dec 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>Because it describes him as a "Jewish Democrat", or because it suggests that all Jewish Democrats are strong supporters of Israel? <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 01:30, 22 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>(1) <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russ_Feingold_9a08.html" title="Russ Feingold">Russ Feingold</a>, who is neutral at best.

(2) That's irrelevant. You should be able to support your factual assertions with outside authority, not ask me to disprove your assertion. (3) "Supporter of Israel" is an empty term. Does it mean "I support Israel's right to exist?" Or "I support every policy decision of the Sharon government." Or if somewhere in between, where? (4) Why say that he supports Israel because he is a Jewish Democrat? Do Jewish Republicans not support Israel? Do non-Jewish Democrats not support Israel? (5) "All X does Y" is a lazy way to write Wikipedia articles because they are essentially hyperbolic statements that are unsupportable by outside authority.</dd>

<dd>Amazing how when you argue with a Jew, they avid any direct discussion of your points. LOL.</dd>

<dd>Just because the statement is "mostly right" doesn't make it "all right" nor does it make it appropriate for this article. --<a href="../../../p/r/i/User%7EPrinceValium_3dfa.html" title="User:PrinceValium">PrinceValium</a> 05:02, 23 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have no objection to deleting "Like other Jewish Democrats," since is not essential to the meaning of the sentence. (Note in passing: Feingold's position on the evidence of that article is essentially pro-Israeli but critical of some Israeli policies. So far as I know this is also Frank's position. "Strong supporter" does not mean "uncritical supporter.") <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 06:17, 23 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Our article asserts as a fact that Gobie was running a prostitution ring out of Frank's apartment. But <a href="http://www.metroweekly.com/feature/?ak=391" class="external text" title="http://www.metroweekly.com/feature/?ak=391" rel="nofollow">one of the sources we cite</a> says that Gobie's claims proved false.

<p>I love how this site automatically redirects when one enters "Barney Fag". I expected a list of choices, this page being one of them, but to go straight here?? How do you know I wasn't looking for evidence of an affair between a certain purple dinosaur and a certain purple Telletubie?</p>

<p>What about the story about Frank hosting a man who ran a gay prostitution business from Frank's home? This was a big story and deserves some attention in such an entry. 89.54.56.159 18:50, 7 October 2006 (UTC)Steve</p>

<dd>Are you serious? The Gobie incident <i>is</i> described in the article—and it has been in the article since November 2003. By the way, it was never proved that Gobie <i>did</i> run a prostitution business from Frank's home. Gobie claimed to have been running such a ring, but the House Ethics Committee determined that Gobie's story was full of inconsistencies, and that much of what he said had been contradicted by third parties and phone records.--<a href="../../../r/a/t/User%7ERattBoy_5f67.html" title="User:RattBoy">RattBoy</a> 14:04, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ya, seriously. This is irrelevent, and is a way of getting in a quick gaybash. Leviticus also says that the disobedient drunkard son should be stoned, could that have applied to our president in the 70s? Stay on topic, this isn't a page to debate over barney frnak himself, just the article.</dd>

<dd>I disagree; being openly homosexual is both unusual and notable for an active politician in this country, not to mention that frank's rule makes very little sense unless it is known by the reader that Frank himself is an open homosexual. 71.59.142.105 01:47, 25 January 2007 (UTC)twelch

<dd>FWIW, mention of orientation does not come up on the <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberace.html" title="Liberace">Liberace</a> page until four subsections down. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberace#Lawsuits" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberace#Lawsuits" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>], and on <a href="../../../e/l/t/Elton_John_16de.html" title="Elton John">Elton John</a> not until the middle of his article.

As a compromise, can I suggest that a separate section be set up, above Controversies, discussing his sexual orientation and the effect it has had on his career. It's up to you, but it will match other famous people that way. <a href="../../../c/o/d/User%7ECodeCarpenter_0b40.html" title="User:CodeCarpenter">CodeCarpenter</a> 17:01, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>How come his scandals are deleted? Didn't he run a gay prostitution ring from his home?</p>
<dl>
<dd>No, he didn't. The facts are in the article now, as the third paragraph under "National politics":
<dl>
<dd>In 1990, the House voted to reprimand Frank when it was revealed that Steve Gobie, a male prostitute that Rep. Frank had befriended after hiring him through a personal advertisement, claimed to have conducted a prostitution ring from Frank's apartment when he was not at home. Frank had dismissed Gobie earlier that year, and reported the incident to the House Ethics Committee, after learning of Gobie's activities. After an investigation, the House Ethics Committee found no evidence that Frank had known of or been involved in the alleged illegal activity.</dd>

</dl>
<p>--&gt; That's not the whole story. Frank paid $80 for sex from Gobie, a three time convicted felon. (Wasn't one of the convictions the production of child pornography?) Also, the "personal advertisement" was more than just a typical dating service. It was an advertisement for prostitution.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Our current text says that Gobie was a male prostitute and that Frank hired him. That seems to convey that he paid for sex; I don't think any reader would assume from that context that Frank hired Gobie for yard work. Is there any evidence that Frank knew of any illegal activity by Gobie? <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a><small>&#160;<a href="../../../j/a/m/User_talk%7EJamesMLane_fe1e.html" title="User talk:JamesMLane">t</a>&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JamesMLane_dde2.html" title="Special:Contributions/JamesMLane">c</a></small> 08:46, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>But, alas, not amazing that a right-wing ideologue would throw charges of bias without bothering to get the facts straight.

<p>Can someone attest to any source saying that he is considered a potential candidate for the 2008 presidency? Cyby 07:04, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I doubt he is a candidate. In fact, I was thinking that the following on his page should be removed "On the 3rd of of February 2007, a group to draft Congressman Frank into the 2008 Presidential Race began. The group's website was launched on that day, and can be viewed at: www.freewebs.com/draftfrank2008". Anyone can set up a web site and have anyone in it to draft for president (Garfield, Mickey Mouse, Dick Cheney, Jimmy Carter), but that should not equate to them being a candidate. Let's face facts, Barney Frank would be carrying some luggage, and would be a RIPE target for a Republican party that has made a career of ripping Massachusetts liberals (Kerry, Dukakis, T. Kennedy). <a href="../../../c/o/d/User%7ECodeCarpenter_0b40.html" title="User:CodeCarpenter">CodeCarpenter</a> 16:44, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
