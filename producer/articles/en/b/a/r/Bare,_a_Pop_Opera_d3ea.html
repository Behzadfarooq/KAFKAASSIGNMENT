<p>Peter is a sensitive gay senior who is <a href="../../../c/l/o/Closeted.html" title="Closeted">closeted</a> and trying to reconcile his faith with his sexuality. During mass, he is <a href="../../../o/u/t/Outed.html" title="Outed">outed</a> and condemned by his friends and the <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catholicism.html" title="Catholicism">Church</a>, but wakes up and realizes it was all a dream (<i><a href="../../../e/p/i/Epiphany_%28feeling%29.html" title="Epiphany (feeling)">Epiphany</a></i>). Later in the school hallways, he bumps into Jason, his roommate and secret boyfriend. Jason is the most popular guy in school but is also closeted, and the two lovers find it hard hiding their relationship within the public space of the school (<i>You &amp; I</i>). Peter convinces Jason to try out for the school play, <i><a href="../../../r/o/m/Romeo_and_Juliet_141f.html" title="Romeo and Juliet">Romeo and Juliet</a></i>. After Jason leaves, Peter sings about his inner turmoil, having to keep their love secret and wondering about their future together (<i>Role of a Lifetime</i>).</p>
<p>At <i>the auditions</i> for the play, directed by the dynamic Sister Chantelle, Jason wins the role of <a href="../../../r/o/m/Romeo.html" title="Romeo">Romeo</a>. Peter gets the role of <a href="../../../m/e/r/Mercutio.html" title="Mercutio">Mercutio</a>, their friend Matt is <a href="../../../t/y/b/Tybalt.html" title="Tybalt">Tybalt</a>, and Ivy, the most popular and sought-after girl in school, gets the role of <a href="../../../j/u/l/Juliet.html" title="Juliet">Juliet</a>. After receiving a package from their father, Nadia, Jason's chubby sister and Ivy's roommate, laughs with her brother over their distant parents' lack of parenting (<i>Love, Dad</i>).</p>
<p>Later that night, the group of friends - Jason, Peter, Ivy, Matt and their classmate and drug dealer, Lucas - decide to go to <i>Wonderland</i>, a <a href="../../../r/a/v/Rave.html" title="Rave">rave</a>. Lucas supplies them with a powerful new drug that could be lethal if taken in large doses. Uninterested in the rave, Nadia decides to stay home (<i>A Quiet Night at Home</i>).</p>
<p>At the rave (<i>Rolling</i>), Peter and Jason dance together. Peter tries to kiss him, but Jason backs away, and the two run out and quarrel over their relationship. Peter wants to come out and tell the world about them, but Jason wants to keep their love secret (<i>Best Kept Secret</i>). Peter tells Jason he loves him. The two kiss, not knowing that Matt sees them. Meanwhile, Ivy suffers an overdose in the club and is taken away.</p>
<p>The next day, the students of St. Cecilia's begrudgingly go to <i><a href="../../../c/o/n/Confession.html" title="Confession">confession</a></i>, calling it a "poor man's therapy session." Peter and Matt go into their confession booths and they each ask the priest what they should do. Ivy, having returned shaken but not harmed by her drug incident, receives sketches of her Juliet costume and reminisces about her image (<i>Portrait of a Girl</i>). Matt, in love with Ivy, watches her from afar.</p>
<p>On her birthday, Ivy is brought drunk to her surprise birthday party and everyone serenades her with a crass tribute (<i>Birthday, Bitch!</i>). Peter accidentally eats some pot brownies and leaves the party after Jason intentionally ignores him. In a drunken stupor, Ivy turns away a lovelorn Matt and tries to seduce Jason (<i>One Kiss</i>). Having left the party, Peter and Matt express their frustration over the insensitivity of their beloveds (<i>Are You There?</i>). Drunk and high, Peter tells Matt his secret and Matt leaves. Peter then has a vision of the <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virgin_Mary_d301.html" title="Virgin Mary">Virgin Mary</a> who, looking remarkably like a <a href="../../../m/o/t/Motown.html" title="Motown">Motown</a>-singing Sister Chantelle, urges Peter to call his mother and tell her he's gay (<i>911! Emergency</i>).</p>
<p>Peter tells Jason that they should come out to their parents, but Jason refuses because his future is on the line (<i>Reputation Stain'd</i>). As their argument builds, Jason pushes Peter down. Peter, hurt and in disbelief, wonders if this is the boy he thought he'd "always follow," and how they ever lost their future together (<i>Ever After</i>). He leaves, but Jason tells him not to tell anyone about them. As <i>Spring</i> approaches, the students get ready to go home for the break. After Peter leaves, Ivy visits Jason and tells him about her feelings for him. Confused between what he wants in life, he gives in to her sexual advances as a last attempt to be "fit in" (<i>One</i>).</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/r/Bare%2C_a_Pop_Opera_d3ea.html" title="Edit section: Act II">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Act II</span></h3>
<p>In another dream, an ecstatic Peter and Jason are getting married in Massachusetts, with <a href="../../../g/o/-/Go-go.html" title="Go-go">go-go</a> boys dancing and Sister Chantelle presiding (<i>Wedding Bells</i>). Unfortunately, the wedding is interrupted by another bride, Ivy, and Peter is barred from the ceremony. He wakes up from the nightmare scared and alone. Spring break is now over, and <i>In the Hallway</i> of St. Cecilia's, Peter runs into Jason. The two try to talk but are interrupted by Ivy. After Peter leaves, Ivy confesses to Jason her love (<i>Touch My Soul</i>), but Jason rejects her, saying their night together was a mistake, and that he's not interested.</p>
<p>Peter, no longer able to live in the closet, calls home and desperately tries to come out to his mother, who is unwilling to listen (<i>See Me</i>). After the phone call, she wonders when she ever went wrong, and if she ever knew her son at all (<i>Warning</i>). At the play rehearsals, Ivy is missing. They try to continue with her inept understudy, but instead Peter steps forward and eloquently acts as Juliet to Jason's Romeo, and the two have noticeable chemistry together (<i>Pilgram's Hands</i>). After rehearsals, Sister Chantelle makes Peter stay behind. Saying that "it ain't a rainbow without the <a href="../../../p/i/n/Pink.html" title="Pink">pink</a>" and that "there's a black woman inside the soul of every gay man," she also tells him that <i>God Don't Make No Trash</i> - which is exactly what Peter needed to hear.</p>
<p>Ivy discovers she is pregnant (<i>All Grown Up</i>) and tries to find Jason. She meets him before the next rehearsals, and he is taken aback by the news(<i>Promise</i>). Matt walks in, and as the cast members arrive - Peter, Nadia, and the other students - Matt angrily reveals all. Sickened and appalled, Peter storms out. Ivy slaps Matt and also leaves. Left alone, afraid and aware of the mess he has caused, Jason goes to confession to seek help; however, while Jason desperation grows (<i>Once Upon a Time</i>) , the priest advises him to suppress his feelings and focus on other things (<i>Cross</i>).</p>
<p>On the night of the performance, the cast does final preparations (<i>Two Households</i>). Jason arrives and asks Peter if they could run away together and forget everything, but Peter tells him that he's tired of hiding. The performance begins, and Jason takes a fatal dose of the drug that Lucas gave him. As the night progresses, Peter notices that Jason is getting more and more disoriented (<i>Queen Mab</i>), and takes him backstage. There, Jason finally confesses to Peter that he is sorry and that he has always loved him (<i>Bare</i>). As they are hurried back out into the spotlight, Jason stumbles and falls onstage. He is carried away and dies.</p>
<p>Peter, in mourning (<i>A Glooming Peace</i>), goes to the confession booth to speak with the Priest. Peter tells him that Jason had looked to the Priest and the Church for guidance in a time of need, but that they failed him. Peter tells the Priest that he and Jason were in love, and that when Jason loved him, he never felt so close to God (<i><a href="../../../a/b/s/Absolution.html" title="Absolution">Absolution</a></i>). "I'm sorry, Peter," says the priest, to which Peter replies, "And I forgive you, Father."</p>
<p>At graduation, each character - Nadia, Ivy, Matt - tries to cope with their loss. Peter, reconciled with his mother, finally says good-bye to Jason. As he and the others graduate from St. Cecilia's, Peter tosses up his hat in one final release (<i>No Voice</i>).</p>
