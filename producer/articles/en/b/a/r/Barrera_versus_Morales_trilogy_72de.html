</div>
</div>
<p><b>Barrera versus Morales</b> fight trilogy is one of <a href="../../../b/o/x/Boxing.html" title="Boxing">boxing</a>'s most famous trilogies of all time, involving two of <a href="../../../m/e/x/Mexico.html" title="Mexico">Mexico</a>'s most revered fighters: <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marco_Antonio_Barrera_ecfb.html" title="Marco Antonio Barrera">Marco Antonio Barrera</a> and <a href="../../../e/r/i/Erik_Morales_e3fd.html" title="Erik Morales">Erik Morales</a>.

<p>The rivalry between Barrera and Morales is not a promotional hype confined to the boxing ring. It is a rivalry based on personal issues and over the past years the two people have qenuinely dislike each other.</p>
<p>Much of the hatred between Barrera and Morales comes from their different backgrounds. Barrera who is a one-time law student comes from a high class family in <a href="../../../m/e/x/Mexico_City%2C_Mexico_73c2.html" title="Mexico City, Mexico">Mexico City</a>, while Morales comes from a lower class family and grew up in great poverty in <a href="../../../t/i/j/Tijuana.html" title="Tijuana">Tijuana</a>.</p>
<p>Barrera and Morales follow the pattern quite well; during a pre-fight public meetings, both fighters were involved in a fist fight during a press conference before their second bout, and Morales threw a water bottle at Barrera's father after their third bout was over.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/r/Barrera_versus_Morales_trilogy_72de.html" title="Edit section: Background">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Background</span></h2>
<p>Marco Antonio Barrera had been the <a href="../../../w/b/o/WBO_d698.html" title="WBO">WBO</a> world <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bantamweight.html" title="Bantamweight">Bantamweight</a> champion before he moved to the <a href="../../../s/u/p/Super_Bantamweight_cf22.html" title="Super Bantamweight">Super Bantamweight</a> division to win the WBO title and unify it with Morales. Morales, from his part, was undefeated and he had won the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Boxing_Council_c4c7.html" title="World Boxing Council">WBC</a> world Super Bantamweight title, <a href="../../../k/n/o/Knockout.html" title="Knockout">knocking out</a> the usually durable <a href="../../../d/a/n/Daniel_Zaragoza_2edf.html" title="Daniel Zaragoza">Daniel Zaragoza</a> in eleven rounds in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1997.html" title="1997">1997</a> to win the world championship. Naturally, their first fight drew large interest in <a href="../../../m/e/x/Mexico.html" title="Mexico">Mexico</a> and many other Latin American countries. It also drew some interest in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>. But Barrera was seen by many as a fighter whose best days had gone by, therefore, most fans and critics expected an easy win for Morales.</p>

Morales defeats Barrera and wins the WBO Featherweight Title in 2000.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Their first fight took place on <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_19.html" title="February 19">February 19</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2000.html" title="2000">2000</a>, at the <a href="../../../m/a/n/Mandalay_Bay_Resort_and_Casino_b4f4.html" title="Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino">Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino</a>, in <a href="../../../l/a/s/Las_Vegas%2C_Nevada_aec8.html" title="Las Vegas, Nevada">Las Vegas</a> and was <a href="../../../t/e/l/Television.html" title="Television">televised</a> on <a href="../../../h/b/o/HBO_Boxing_df2e.html" title="HBO Boxing">HBO Boxing</a>.</p>
<p>This fight was set to a fast pace from round one on. By round four, the two boxers were sweating heavily, but they still managed to keep on punching. Round five was <a href="../../../r/i/n/Ring_Magazine_7546.html" title="Ring Magazine">Ring Magazine</a>'s round of the year. At the beginning of the round Barrera backed Morales into the ropes and as he approached Morales with a flurry, Morales fired back a flurry of his own and both fighters were in a furious exchange. They clinched and the ref separated them. Immediately Morales began bombarding Barrera with furious power punches landing about fifteen power punches in an onslaught that lasted about a minute. Then, with a minute left in the round, as Morales was bombing on Barrera, Barrera suddenly threw a flurry of power punches that stunned Morales and almost sent him to the canvas. For the rest of the round Barrera was attacking Morales with power punches.</p>
<p>Rounds six to eleven followed the same pattern: one of the two boxers would begin the round by hurting the other, then the other would attack back, and by the end of the round, both fighters were trading power punches.</p>
<p>In round twelve with about 30 seconds to go, Barrera sent Morales to the canvas with what appeared to be a body punch, but really Barrera's glove barely touched Morales' body as Morales was coming in with his own punch and as a result Morales slipped and took a knee on the canvas. The ref ruled a knockdown and Morales immediately protested. After the ref gave Morales a standing 8 count with about 15 seconds left in the fight, Morales ran across the ring and threw a flurry of about ten punches at Barrera and Barrera fired back. The ten second warning was up and Barrera backed Morales into the ropes and once again they exchanged punches until the final bell.</p>
<p>Morales was declared winner by a split decision, with scores of 115-112, 114-113 and 113-114.</p>
<p>Many who watched the fight, as well as many boxing magazine writers, felt Barrera was robbed of a win by the judges, therefore, claims for a rematch began almost as soon as the decision in favor of Morales was announced. The WBO refused to recognize Morales as champion, returning their belt, and championship recognition, to Barrera.</p>
<p>Most rounds in this fight were difficult to score, making it harder for observers to pick a winner. The fight was declared <a href="../../../r/i/n/Ring_Magazine_fights_of_the_year_e51c.html" title="Ring Magazine fights of the year">fight of the year</a> by Ring Magazine.</p>

After the impact their first fight had on many of those that saw it, their second fight was made a <a href="../../../p/a/y/Pay_Per_View_8779.html" title="Pay Per View">Pay Per View</a> event. It was for <i>The Ring</i> and WBC's world <a href="../../../f/e/a/Featherweight.html" title="Featherweight">Featherweight</a> titles.</p>
<p>This is often described as the most tactical fight of the three. Nevertheless, there was plenty of furious exchanges, but, with Barrera fighting a more technical fight, Morales looked like he was connecting with heavier punches. In round four, Barrera went to the floor from what many claimed was a body punch by Morales, but the fall was ruled a slip and not a knockdown. This would prove critical in the fight's outcome.</p>
<p>Morales and Barrera once again traded punches from round one to round twelve, with many furious exchanges. Barrera utilized his <a href="../../../j/a/b/Jab.html" title="Jab">jab</a> more, with Morales connecting more power punches. Once again, their second fight was very difficult to score.</p>
<p>Barrera was declared the winner by unanimous decision, with scores of 116-112 and 115-113 (twice). Had the fall in round four been called a knockdown, the two 115-113 scores might have changed to 114-114 each, therefore, it would have been a majority draw (tie).</p>
<p>This time, most fans and observers felt it was Morales who had been robbed of a win by the judges. The WBC reciprocrated the WBO's actions after the first fight, by returning their belt and world championship recognition to Morales.</p>
<p>Before the fight, Morales' team tried to trick the Barrera team by disguising the Japanese manufactured Winning gloves, which Morales prefers to wear due to his prominent knuckles, with the Cleto Reyes logos. The contract for the bout required that both fighters wear the Mexican designed Cleto Reyes gloves. Barrera's brother discovered the error and had Barrera's gloves changed to Cleto Reyes, while Morales proceeded to wear the Winning gloves with the Reyes logos.</p>

Barrera humiliated Morales and wins the WBC Super Featherweight Title in their bout in 2004.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The third fight of the trilogy was fought at the <a href="../../../s/u/p/Super_Featherweight_cbcd.html" title="Super Featherweight">Super Featherweight</a> Division. Morales had gone on to win the WBC world title in that division after defeating <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jes%C3%BAs_Ch%C3%A1vez_80a8.html" title="Jesús Chávez">Jesús Chávez</a>, and Barrera had lost recognition as world Featherweight champion after being defeated by <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manny_Pacquiao_ef02.html" title="Manny Pacquiao">Manny Pacquiao</a>, so he moved up to the Super Featherweight division to challenge Morales.</p>
<p>The third fight took place on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_27.html" title="November 27">November 27</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>, once again at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas. It was another <a href="../../../h/b/o/HBO_509e.html" title="HBO">HBO</a> Pay Per View event.</p>
<p>Barrera and Morales wore <a href="../../../y/e/l/Yellow.html" title="Yellow">yellow</a> Winning gloves (Morales, as the defending titleholder, was allowed the gloves of his choice), which is quite unusual in boxing. Once again, they fought to a furious pace from start to end. Each round was, once again, difficult to score. The two fighters gave each other as hard as they took.</p>
<p>After round eight, the fight seemed to be headed to be scored a tie. However, in round nine, Barrera punished Morales along the ropes, giving him a slight edge.</p>
<p>At the beginning of round ten, Morales caught Barrera with an <a href="../../../u/p/p/Uppercut.html" title="Uppercut">uppercut</a> that landed on Barrera's chin and stunned him. Morales followed with an onslaught that lasted for about one minute, with Barrera firing back, but getting his head snapped back by almost every punch Morales landed. Then, towards the end of the round, Barrera turned things around and began hitting Morales hard, putting him in trouble.</p>
<p>Round eleven saw more of the see saw action the two boxers had made their fans become accostumed to. Both boxers knew the fight, and the claim as to who was the better of the two boxers in the trilogy, was on the line before round twelve. In round eleven both fighters didn't stop throwing punches until the round was up. The entire round can be described as one big exchange between the two fighters. As Jim Lampley described it, it was, "a streetfight breaking out in Las Vegas."</p>
<p>Before round 12, Morales and Barrera surprisingly touched gloves to show respect to one another, which is something both fighters refused to do with each other in the past. The two fighters began firing away almost immediately. At the beginning of round 12 Morales threw a right hook that skinned the back of Barrera's head as Barrera was off balance and Barrera almost slipped to the canvas as he slipped across the ring but managed to stay on his feet. The entire round was another vicious exchange between the two fighters. With about 25 seconds left in the fight, an exhausted Barrera was almost pushed down to the canvas as Morales leaned a bit on Barrera's back which caused Barrera's hands to crash to the canvas to keep himself from completely falling on the floor. As Barrera slowly began to stand straight up, Morales jumped in front of Barrera as Barrera was on the ropes and threw a flurry of about 12 punches with most of them landing. Barrera clinched onto Morales in desperation. When the ten second warning was up Barrera let it all go and threw a flurry that backed Morales into the ropes and the two exchanged furious power punches to end the fight. As Jim Lampley described it, "They'll savagely trade until the final bell!"</p>
<p>Both the fans watching the fight live and HBO's broadcasters awaited for the decision anxiously, and both fighters were carried on their trainers arms around the ring and cheered by their fans after the third fight was over.</p>
<p>Barrera was declared the winner and new WBC world Junior Lightweight champion by a majority decision, with scores of 115-113, 115-114, and 114-114. The WBC did not take recognition away from Barrera.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/r/Barrera_versus_Morales_trilogy_72de.html" title="Edit section: A fourth fight?">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">A fourth fight?</span></h2>
<p>At the moment, it is very unlikely for this fight to happen due to Morales's recent consecutive back-to-back losses and poor form in the boxing ring. While Barrera is in a definite hot streak and eager to fight Morales for the fouth time, after disposing Mexican-American boxer <a href="../../../r/o/c/Rocky_Juarez_3a12.html" title="Rocky Juarez">Rocky Juárez</a> and retaining the WBC Super Featherweight title in May 20, 2006.</p>
<p>Citing Morales' most recent loss by knockout to rival Manny Pacquiao in November 18, 2006, the likelihood of a fourth match with Barrera is slim, as Morales has said he is contemplating retirement. However as of January 26, 2007, it has been confimed that Morales will not be retiring from boxing. In a recent holiday visit to the <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philippines.html" title="Philippines">Philippines</a>, he told <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Philippine_Star_74ec.html" title="The Philippine Star">The Philippine Star</a> Newspaper, he is definitely fighting again in the ring. Morales stated, he has unfinished business in the ring and will moved up to the <a href="../../../l/i/g/Lightweight.html" title="Lightweight">Lightweight</a> division in search of a fourth WBC title. He also revealed that he is determined to regain he's crown as the undisputed world boxing champion and become the first Mexican fighter to win four World Boxing Council (WBC) titles in different divisions. A fourth fight with Barrera is likely to happen in the near future.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
