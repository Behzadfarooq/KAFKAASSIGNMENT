<p><b>Barry Evans</b> was a <a href="../../../f/i/c/Fictional_character.html" title="Fictional character">fictional character</a> in the popular <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_a61d.html" title="BBC">BBC</a> <a href="../../../s/o/a/Soap_opera.html" title="Soap opera">soap opera</a> <i><a href="../../../e/a/s/EastEnders_4f21.html" title="EastEnders">EastEnders</a></i>. He was played by <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shaun_Williamson_3ee9.html" title="Shaun Williamson">Shaun Williamson</a>.</p>
<p>Barry saw himself as a business entrepreneur, but he was generally deemed by others as being a bit of a pathetic buffoon. Although he was often immature and irritating, Barry did have a soft heart and all he ever really wanted in life was his father's respect and the love of a good woman. It was being a soft touch that led to his untimely demise.</p>

<p>Barry arrived in <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albert_Square_f1ed.html" title="Albert Square">Albert Square</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1994.html" title="1994">1994</a> as an acquaintance to <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Wicks_b1fd.html" title="David Wicks">David Wicks</a>, and his initial role was to provide a trysting spot for David's adulterous affair with <a href="../../../c/i/n/Cindy_Beale_6f4a.html" title="Cindy Beale">Cindy Beale</a>. Barry later aided Cindy's escape from <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walford.html" title="Walford">Walford</a>, after she was wanted by the police for the attempted murder of her husband <a href="../../../i/a/n/Ian_Beale_939a.html" title="Ian Beale">Ian Beale</a>.</p>
<p>Barry was son to car dealer <a href="../../../r/o/y/Roy_Evans_%28EastEnders%29_fc26.html" title="Roy Evans (EastEnders)">Roy Evans</a>. He moved to Albert Square when Roy and his new romantic interest, <a href="../../../p/a/t/Pat_Evans_b3ff.html" title="Pat Evans">Pat</a>, moved in together. Barry intitially managed Roy's car business, 'Manor Wood', which was situated outside Walford. Roy later went into partnership with David Wicks when he bought into <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_buildings_in_EastEnders_e694.html#Car_lot" title="List of buildings in EastEnders">car lot</a> in Albert Square. Problems arose in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1996.html" title="1996">1996</a> when Pat's ex-husband, <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frank_Butcher_1e7b.html" title="Frank Butcher">Frank Butcher</a>, returned to the Square and attempted to reclaim his wife, his house and his business from Roy. Barry decided to try and get rid of Frank by hiring a man to torch the car-lot, with the hope that Frank would be frightened off. However, Frank had already cut his losses and departed and it was <a href="../../../p/h/i/Phil_Mitchell_2084.html" title="Phil Mitchell">Phil Mitchell</a> who was unwittingly trapped inside when the lot went up in flames. Phil survived and unfortunately for Barry the hired arsonist was soon traced by the police and it wasn't long before he'd implicated Barry. Barry was arrested trying to flee the country and was subsequently imprisoned, although he was released a few months later.</p>
<p>Upon his release, Barry was given a chance to prove his capabilities by running the car-lot on Albert Square while Roy enjoyed retirement. Following David's departure the business was renamed 'Evans &amp; Son', much to Barry's glee. Barry was forever searching for the respect and pride of his father, but however hard he tried he always messed things up and ended up trying his father's patience instead. Barry's management of the car lot was no exception. Barry risked the business and his family's savings by handing his monetary assets over to con-woman Vanessa Carlton. Barry was fooled into believing that Vanessa loved him, and after persuading him to invest the money in a fabricated business venture in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1997.html" title="1997">1997</a>, she disappeared and left Barry to face up to a furious Roy. Barry's blunder forced Roy out of retirement and Barry was never able to regain Roy's full trust again.</p>

Barry &amp; Natalie marry</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Losing his job at the car lot, Barry was forced to seek employment elsewhere. He soon replaced <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robbie_Jackson_502a.html" title="Robbie Jackson">Robbie Jackson</a> (through back-stabbing) as manager of the local video shop. It was around this time when Barry began to desire the love of a woman and he sought the help of a local dating agency to get it. This led to his first encounter with <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walford.html" title="Walford">Walford</a> returnee <a href="../../../n/a/t/Natalie_Evans_28d7.html" title="Natalie Evans">Natalie Price</a>. Years earlier Natalie was driven out of Walford by <a href="../../../b/i/a/Bianca_Jackson_7f8d.html" title="Bianca Jackson">Bianca Jackson</a> when her affair with <a href="../../../r/i/c/Ricky_Butcher_eb03.html" title="Ricky Butcher">Ricky Butcher</a> was uncovered. Unaware of Natalie's history, the two grew closer while Natalie attempted to set him up on many disastrous dates. After much bumbling from Barry, he eventually realised his true feelings for Natalie and a romance began. Natalie soon moved in with Barry, Roy and Pat and they married in a <a href="../../../m/i/l/Millennium.html" title="Millennium">millennium</a> double wedding with <a href="../../../i/a/n/Ian_Beale_939a.html" title="Ian Beale">Ian Beale</a> and <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melanie_Owen_dbb7.html" title="Melanie Owen">Melanie Healy</a>.</p>
<p>Barry and Natalie remained happy for a while, until Natalie discovered she was pregnant with Barry's baby. Barry was over the moon about the news but Natalie wasn't so pleased and almost <a href="../../../a/b/o/Abortion.html" title="Abortion">aborted</a> the baby. However Barry promised to help out with the baby duties so Natalie could continue with her career and in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002.html" title="2002">2002</a> <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_Evans_%28EastEnders%29_6c78.html" title="Jack Evans (EastEnders)">Jack</a> was born.</p>
<p>Barry had a turbulent time when his half brother <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nathan_Williams_397a.html" title="Nathan Williams">Nathan Williams</a> came onto the scene. Nathan, born out of an adulterous affair between Barry's father and Nathan's mother Jane Williams, was resentful towards Barry for having his fathers unconditional love, though he had never even known him. Meanwhile Barry was extremely angry with his father for being unfaithful to his mother and their relationship was severely tested. Despite attempts by both Barry and Roy to accept Nathan into the fold, Nathan did his best to exclude and diminish Barry. Things reached a head when Barry discovered that Nathan had kissed his wife Natalie, and realising Nathan's agenda Roy disowned him. Barry eventually came to forgive Natalie for her brief fling, but he never really trusted her fully again.</p>
<p>Although Barry tried to make his marriage work, Natalie had fallen out of love with him and it wasn't long before she strayed again with old flame <a href="../../../r/i/c/Ricky_Butcher_eb03.html" title="Ricky Butcher">Ricky</a>. Unbeknownst to Barry, Natalie and Ricky planned to leave Walford with their sons Jack and <a href="../../../l/i/a/Liam_Butcher_39ac.html" title="Liam Butcher">Liam</a>. However Barry discovered them just before they planned to leave, and although Natalie called off the affair with Ricky, she also left Barry. In a cruel twist of fate, Barry's night got worse, when his father was rushed to hospital after suffering a heart attack, and died not long after. Devastated Barry blamed his father's death on his step-mother Pat, who he had never forgiven after she cheated on his father with prior husband <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frank_Butcher_1e7b.html" title="Frank Butcher">Frank Butcher</a>. With Barry being sole beneficiary to his father's house and business, he threw Pat out onto the street and left the grieving widow with nothing.</p>

Janine causes Barry to fall to his death, 2004</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Barry spent a long time after this feeling sorry for himself and became a bit of a <a href="../../../r/e/c/Recluse.html" title="Recluse">recluse</a>. It was around this time that Barry's employee <a href="../../../j/a/n/Janine_Evans_23f1.html" title="Janine Evans">Janine</a> (sensing an opportunity to manipulate some money out of her boss) started worming her way into Barry's affections. With the help of her secret boyfriend <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Trueman_bd16.html" title="Paul Trueman">Paul Trueman</a>, she concocted a plan to make Barry fall in love with her, so she could get her hands on Barry's wealth. Feeling vulnerable since his split with Natalie, Barry fell for Janine's lies and the two got engaged. Meanwhile a mix up with Barry's doctor had foolishly led Barry to believe that he was not long left for this world. Thinking that he would soon be dead and believing that Janine really loved him Barry whisked her away to <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scotland.html" title="Scotland">Scotland</a> for his second New Years Eve wedding in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a>. However feeling a sudden twang of guilt, Janine's accomplice, Paul, called off his affair with her after the wedding. To make matters worse Barry had discovered that he was not dying after all, leaving Janine with the realisation that she was stuck married to Barry and couldn't get her hands on his money for the foreseeable future. The very next day on <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_1.html" title="January 1">January 1</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>, a blissfully unaware Barry forced Janine to go for a romantic walk with him on the Scottish moors. However, while at the edge of a steep hill, Janine, unable to stand Barry any longer, hurled venomous abuse at him and confessed that their entire relationship was fake and that she had been sleeping with Paul behind his back. Barry still wanted to be with her however and said he could forgive her for sleeping with Paul if she'd only stay with him. He begged Janine not to leave him and went towards her trying to molest her. Janine pushed him away and this caused him to stumble back, falling straight over the edge of the ravine, where Janine left him to die, inheriting his business and his wealth in the process.</p>
