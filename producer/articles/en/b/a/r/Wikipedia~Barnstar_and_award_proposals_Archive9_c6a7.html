<p>Humm, since we started this new forum for the creation of category-specific awards, I've noticed a problem (or a glitch..): maybe we were too bold. By starting too many discussions (one per award) at the same time, we created a puzzle of discussions that seem to drag on forever. As a result, we have votes that never quite close, and some discussions seem to have been abandoned halfway through. I mean, everybody here contributes in other articles/forums in Wikipedia, in addition to each one's personal life (I hope!). If there's too much stuff going on at the same time, as it is the case here, we can't focus and conclude one discussion (and create an award) before moving on to the next one. We are taking a surreal amount of time to wrap those awards up. How about we (meaning the regular contributors of this forum, of course, since we'd have no control over the ocasional visitors) make a pact to tackle one award at a time, and not touch the following one until we have finished with that one award? We'd do this Conclave style. Regards, <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedux_c670.html" title="User:Redux">Redux</a> 02:46, 23 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>While I am trying to find a hat that fits, I am looking at what Redux says and I say that he says and man he is right. We notice few people passing out Barnstars, and those that do, use the already established awards. What we can do is keep the ones we have, and create no more for right now. We will just instruct users that when you award a barnstar, you should try to include a short message (which I affectionately call a citation) on why this barnstar is given to this user. If there is a strong need for a category award, we can do so. But mainly, it is just the core group of us (Death, Redux, Clockwork, Brian and myself) who are voting, creating and designing these awards. Man, I just think we should just stop right now on this and just focus on trying to promote the award system we got. However, I do wish to say one thing: the awarding of real medals, like the Hero of Socialist Labor, has stopped, so it feels like our march for Barnstars has taken hold. I am not sure what the rest of yall think, but I hope it will be soon. I want to release white smoke on this issue, instead of the usual greys. <a href="../../../z/s/c/User%7EZscout370_3f46.html" title="User:Zscout370">Zscout370</a> 02:59, 23 Apr 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I am trying to help also, and yet, when I do something it just seems to make the voting or thinking process take longer. Has anyone even taken note of my plan to merge those two awards for Barnstar of Reversion? And I'm still puzzled at why my History Barnstar wasn't good enough, but oh well, I can rant another day. Btw, why do I get the feeling that the recent papal election has inspired you guys? I will continue to help out. -- <a href="../../../r/i/f/User%7ERiffsyphon1024_ff13.html" title="User:Riffsyphon1024">Riffsyphon1024</a> 03:09, Apr 23, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>One, yes, the papal election has inspired me and Redux with our responses (plus, I have been watching/editing/debating on the <a href="../../../b/e/n/Benedict_XVI_15c6.html" title="Benedict XVI">Benedict XVI</a> article). Two, I am sorry I left you off the short list (I probably left off Brian too) and three, the votes do take long, and I still see voting for Barnstars that have been decided upon already. Plus, if this whole project closes, we still can use the Defender of the Wiki or the Editor's Barnstar for honorable reverting of vandalism. <a href="../../../z/s/c/User%7EZscout370_3f46.html" title="User:Zscout370">Zscout370</a> 03:12, 23 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>The reason why the creation process of these awards is taking so long (and every little thing you add just seems to make it that much longer) is exactly that the regular contributors have too much in their plates right now. We are splitting our attention between 7 or 8 different discussions (if not more), and that's counterproductive. The category-specific awards are, at least in theory, a good idea, but we will not get all of those done any time soon unless we take this one [award] at a time. As Zscout pointed out, though, it may be that all of this work ends up being forgotten by the community. I'd suggest that we put up those awards that are nearly completed (but that we complete them one at a time!) and wait and see if they will be used before we put all this time and effort into other new awards.

<p>I'm not sure if unregistered users are allowed to make suggestions regarding wikipedia policies such as this however one idea that comes to mind might be an "Unknown Wikipdian" barnstar for contributions specifically made by anonymous users&#160;? While it would admittedly be dificult to seperate those IP's, particularly from AOL, which contribute legitimate articles and those from random vandalisim there are many IP addresses that use a single address. <a href="../../../1/5/2/User%7E152.163.100.202.html" title="User:152.163.100.202">152.163.100.202</a> 07:47, 24 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>There's no impediment for unregistered users to suggest new awards. Such a suggestion, btw, has nothing to do with Wikipedia policy. The process of creating and awarding a Barnstar is rather informal — although we prefer that new ideas be subject to the scrutiny of the community before being added to the project page. You may put your idea up for consideration at this project page, I'm certain we'd all like to hear your ideas and provide you with feedback. In this case, I can tell you that the technical difficulty you pointed yourself may be a considerable obstacle: it is difficult to sort unregistered users due to IP addresses being often shared. And not only that, whenever you post a message on the "talk page of an IP address", all those who share it get that message as if it was their own. Similarly, if we were to award a Barnstar to an IP address, it would look to all that share it that they got it, and because they are all unregistered, and therefore anon users, it would be quite difficult to indicate who it is that actually got it.<br />
I would like to take the opportunity to encourage you to register. You don't need to provide any personal information or even an e-mail address. You just have to create a screen name and a password. You will find that being a registered user makes your life as an editor much easier. That are many features of the website that exist only for registered users, such as the Watchlist and the list of contributions (that you can be positive to be just your own), in addition to some "privileges", so to speak, such as being able to upload images to the website.

<p>Humm, I've noticed that the rate of contribution for the forums on the new awards has decreased considerably. Some discussions have been on a stand-still for weeks! We're not getting much done around here, and at that pace, the internet will become obsolete before we can conclude all of the new awards currently in discussion. Could it be that the general interest has thined a little? Or maybe people are just busy and can't contribute as much as they used to. In any case, maybe we should organize some sort of "drive" to get some of the regular contributors back?? We must rekindle this forum.

<dd>Clockwork has been involved in trying to find impostors on Wikipedia, but I left him a note on his talk page. I have been involved in reverting vandalism, which have been turned into edit wars. I am willing to get rid of some of these ideas by voting on them. I already redid the Motivator award, so it looks less like a barnstar. That is ready for a vote. <a href="../../../z/s/c/User%7EZscout370_3f46.html" title="User:Zscout370">Zscout370</a> <a href="../../../z/s/c/User_talk%7EZscout370_dbee.html" title="User talk:Zscout370">(talk)</a> 12:41, 8 May 2005 (UTC)

<dd>It seems that when a new proposal is introduced, users pounce to debate it while leaving old discussions abandoned. Perhaps there are too many discussions occurring at once, ideas have been drained, or we all need some motivation. What sort of "drive" were you thinking of, Redux? <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESango123_0773.html" title="User:Sango123"><font color="#3D9140">Sango</font></a><a href="../../../s/a/n/User_talk%7ESango123_3e3e.html" title="User talk:Sango123"><font color="#215E21">123</font></a> 16:06, May 8, 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>What I will do is that I will have awards that are currently being voted on be placed at the top page, while putting the proposials at the bottom. The page set up will be different than what we have right now, but I hope it works. <a href="../../../z/s/c/User%7EZscout370_3f46.html" title="User:Zscout370">Zscout370</a> <a href="../../../z/s/c/User_talk%7EZscout370_dbee.html" title="User talk:Zscout370">(talk)</a> 16:12, 8 May 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I like Zscout370's proposal for a new set up for the page. It should help expedite the votes and make consultation of all the new discussions much easier. Sango123's point is very similar to the one I had raised on the discussion right above this one: too much stuff going on, people just get divided and we can't seem to finish anything. What I was thinking about was a standard message (so we don't take forever to get it all done) to be placed in the talk pages of all the users that are or have been until recently regular contributors to this forum (e.g.: <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>, <a href="../../../c/l/o/User%7EClockworkSoul_d5aa.html" title="User:ClockworkSoul">ClockworkSoul</a>, <a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">Death<b>phoenix</b></a> and others, although this is a relatively subjective assessment). In it, we could tell them that their input is missed and invite them to return if they can. But, and this may well be the most important part of it, let them know of this idea (if others agree with me that this is the best way to get things done) of taking one discussion at a time and not moving on to any other idea until the proposed award at hand has been decided on. Not many people took notice of the discussion on that subject, so what little contribution the forum has received over the last month has been split between the many, many different awards currently in discussion. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedux_c670.html" title="User:Redux">Redux</a> 22:40, 8 May 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>That sounds like a good idea. Should proposals for new awards/Barnstars continue or be stopped until we get the current ones decided and voted on? <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESango123_0773.html" title="User:Sango123"><font color="#3D9140">Sango</font></a><a href="../../../s/a/n/User_talk%7ESango123_3e3e.html" title="User talk:Sango123"><font color="#215E21">123</font></a> 23:15, May 8, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Just like with the Images for Deletion page, we can have a "holding cell" of proposals that just have been added, and has been accepted by the community to discuss and vote on. I moved the section of Category Barnstars onto it's own page, while I have created templates of the completed Barnstars. I have created sections of Barnstars up for a vote, Completed barnstars and the ones that are being debated. It will take some time, due to server errors, but it shall be done. <a href="../../../z/s/c/User%7EZscout370_3f46.html" title="User:Zscout370">Zscout370</a> <a href="../../../z/s/c/User_talk%7EZscout370_dbee.html" title="User talk:Zscout370">(talk)</a> 00:55, 9 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I believe we should establish priorities: no new ideas should be introduced until all of those that are up for discussion are settled. If a newcomer introduces a new proposal, we would let him know that his suggestion is greatly appreciated but that it will be added to the bottom of our list (and thus may take a while for it to actually be discussed). As for those awards that are already on the forum (category barnstars mainly, which Zscout370 has just moved), we establish an order of preference, according to which they would be discussed, one at a time. We would post that listing at the top of each discussion, in order to let people know (e.g.: "This award is 4th in the order of discussion. Now working on 2nd item." or something like this). I would suggest as criteria for organizing the list: 1) The discussions that are closer to a conclusion should take precedence. The closer it is to being settled, the higher it will go on the list. 2) Should two or more awards seem to be exactly as close to conclusion, the discussion that is the oldest takes precedence. I don't believe there should be any ties in this second criterium, for I propose that the "age" of the discussion be defined by the date of the first comment by a user on the topic, by date. If those are the same, hour differences shall decide. If those are the same as well, minutes (even a one-minute separation should be sufficient to determine which discussion takes precedence over another). I see it as practically impossible that a tie would withstand a minute-based separation. This way, all of the awards' discussions will be halted for a while. How long that will last for each discussion, the criteria (and how long we would take to settle each discussion) would decide. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedux_c670.html" title="User:Redux">Redux</a> 01:04, 9 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Since we are a small band of people, we can take a while to discuss and approve the awards, since it took a while to get some awards through. The holding cell is the exact place we can put the new ideas at, and just the page like a talk page: the newest awards on bottom. I am trying to keep things from oldest to youngest, and I am nearly done with my changes. <a href="../../../z/s/c/User%7EZscout370_3f46.html" title="User:Zscout370">Zscout370</a> <a href="../../../z/s/c/User_talk%7EZscout370_dbee.html" title="User talk:Zscout370">(talk)</a> 01:08, 9 May 2005 (UTC)

<dd>The holding cell sounds like a good idea for ordering the newest proposals for awards. I don't believe it would apply for the ongoing discussions though. Since those are already onset and are quite numerous, and therein lies the problem, I proposed that list as a neutral form of establishing a order of discussion for them, which we would tackle one at a time (which would represent a temporary arrest in the discussions of all the awards currently in discussion). <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedux_c670.html" title="User:Redux">Redux</a> 01:14, 9 May 2005 (UTC)

<dd>The holding cell will only affect the added ideas from now until whenever the policy changes again. Though, the idea that was recently added, we can add to the archives, since it was pretty much shot down. I still need to get through my featured article award and the motivation award, plus Sango has two awards (one here, one in the category) that needs to be fixed. And I am still wanting the Barnstar of National Merit to be used for the Geography category awards. <a href="../../../z/s/c/User%7EZscout370_3f46.html" title="User:Zscout370">Zscout370</a> <a href="../../../z/s/c/User_talk%7EZscout370_dbee.html" title="User talk:Zscout370">(talk)</a> 01:21, 9 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>ANNOUNCEMENT</b>- Hello! I've noticed that all of you have interest in creating logos, barnstars, or past artistic ability! Thus, I just wanted to let you know that the pre-round, an artistic competition, is now open at Wikipedia:Mind Benders (Shortcut: WP:MIND)! The competition is open to everyone and is seeking a logo/trophy, similar to Barnstars, to be placed on every winner's page. We urge you to help us out and submit an entry! Afterwards, the normal rounds, each consisting of ten or more fun, logical, brain-stimulating questions will open. Why don't you give it a try when it opens! Look forward to seeing your contribution.

<p>I noticed that just recently, the sections were transcluded into seperate articles. I'm not sure that's such a great idea, because I (and probably most other Barnstar folks) have just the main page in my watchlist. Changes to each of the transcluded articles aren't noted in the watchlist unless you've added each transcluded article in the watchlist. --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">Death</a><a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>phoenix</b></a> 18:17, 22 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Someone has hijacked my <a href="../../../h/e/r/Hero_of_Belarus_2d1c.html" title="Hero of Belarus">Hero of Belarus</a> award and make it into some Wikipedia award.

<dd>Indeed, I've seen it awarded to some people. I do believe we should try to talk people out of awarding real life awards as wiki awards. There are already so many Barnstars and other wiki awards, and more in the making. There's really no need to take over a country's national award and turn it into a Wikipedia prize. In fact, we had reached consensus about this. Doesn't the Guidelines agreed upon for creating Barnstars and other awards say that wiki awards shall not be, or even directly resemble, any real life award? This should apply to this case. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedux_c670.html" title="User:Redux">Redux</a> 03:34, 6 August 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I tried to talk to the users in question, but that is not working. While we did come up with a clear consensus that real awards should not be given out to users, such as the Hero of Socialist Labor, people still do it anyways. I pretty much just ask why they do it, and I get nothing back in return. <a href="../../../z/s/c/User%7EZscout370_3f46.html" title="User:Zscout370">Zscout370</a> <a href="../../../z/s/c/User_talk%7EZscout370_dbee.html" title="User talk:Zscout370">(Sound Off)</a> 03:36, 6 August 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Oh the humanity... Well, this is the best we can do: talk to them. It's not like anyone is going to get blocked for "giving out" real life awards. But if we can make them get a feeling that doing that is frowned upon, they might discontinue...eventually. Maybe those people you tried to contact didn't answer you, but didn't award the Hero of Belarus again too? If they did, we'll just have to keep reminding them that awarding real life awards is not supposed to be done. Some people only do it because they see it done first, so the more we can cut back on that, the less people will be awarding the Hero of Belarus and other real awards. Perhaps we could even come up with a "task force" for that: let each other know of cases, and coordinate an approach to the "giver" — maybe, if two, three or even more users all contact the person at once, (s)he will realise that it's not just one cranky user complaining, but rather a community feeling that what was done shouldn't have been done.

<dd>I figured I had some pull, since I created the image. But, if they choose not to respond, then everything else is beyond my control. However, we should have a list of real awards that were given out as Wiki-awards. Other than the HSL and the HoB, I know that the Order of Canada, Purple Heart, Order of the White Eagle, Hero of the Soviet Union, Hero of Ukraine, Order of Lenin, Order of Glory and many others were given out. <a href="../../../z/s/c/User%7EZscout370_3f46.html" title="User:Zscout370">Zscout370</a> <a href="../../../z/s/c/User_talk%7EZscout370_dbee.html" title="User talk:Zscout370">(Sound Off)</a> 04:23, 6 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>That is a long list. And indeed, it's almost impossible to keep track of such widespread misuse of the images of real awards. Ultimately, the best we can do is coordinate when we do stumble across one of those. It's like I said: if a number of users all convey to the person that awarding real medals should not be done, we might be able to convince the individual of not doing it again, and that alone can work towards cutting back the misawarding — people who get these awards sometimes start giving them out themselves, adding to the list. If we can prevent some awardings from happening, we may be preventing many future awardings in the process. And maybe this effort will get noticed in the project, maybe draw some support, and perhaps one day there may be a somewhat general awareness that real awards are not to be given out as wiki awards. We'll just have to outlast the misawardings. Our main problem seems to be that, although almost everyone is aware of the existence of Barnstars and other wiki awards, not many know of the work and the discussions that are behind those awards. I don't suppose many people know of the consensus not to award real life medals. We need to bring attention to this, so that more people might join the effort to prevent the misuse of real awards images. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedux_c670.html" title="User:Redux">Redux</a> 04:42, 6 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I didn't know where to post this, so I posted it twice. What about a barnstar for anon editors? There are some great editors who simply don't want to log in. I was thinking a regular barnstar, but with a question mark (?) around it. Have the top point of the staron top of the top of the question mark, and have the question mark sort of draped around the "shoulders" of the star. I'm not good with graphics, but maybe someone who is could help me out. And if not an Anon Barnstar, it would be a good "Barnstar for some reason that I can't think of right now" or a "Mystery Barnstar". Just my thoughts. --<a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELord_Voldemort_ca3f.html" title="User:Lord Voldemort"><font color="purple">Lord Vold</font></a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="green"><i><b>e</b></i></font></a><a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELord_Voldemort_ca3f.html" title="User:Lord Voldemort"><font color="purple">mort</font></a> <sup><a href="../../../l/o/r/User_talk%7ELord_Voldemort_cf5f.html" title="User talk:Lord Voldemort"><font color="#3D9140">(Dark Mark)</font></a></sup> 18:26, 29 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>With current feelings about userboxes, I'm not sure what people think of this, but perhaps, as well as the standard award template, perhaps something along the lines of <a href="../../../s/m/u/User%7ESmurrayinchester_Template%7EStarbox_72f8.html" title="User:Smurrayinchester/Template:Starbox">this</a> for users who prefer userboxes to words. Plus, if someone is given one these and would prefer a normal barnstar or vice-versa, it should be easy to swap (same fields, just different name). So {{Boxstar|image=Raok barnstar.png|text=I, Smurrayinchester, award this Barnstar to X on behalf of the [[WP:KC|Kindness Campaign]].}} could become {{Award|image=Raok barnstar.png|text=I, Smurrayinchester, award this Barnstar to X on behalf of the [[WP:KC|Kindness Campaign]].}} . <font style="color:#00BB55"><u><b>s</b>murray</u></font><font style="color:#00AA77"><u>inch</u></font><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><font style="color:green"><i><b>e</b></i></font></a><font style="color:#00AA77"><u>ster</u></font><font style="color:#00AA77"><sup>(<a href="../../../s/m/u/User%7ESmurrayinchester_f294.html" title="User:Smurrayinchester">User</a>), (<a href="../../../s/m/u/User_talk%7ESmurrayinchester_aa08.html" title="User talk:Smurrayinchester">Talk</a>)</sup></font> 14:10, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Most of the current Barnstars/Awards are given to each user on a individual basis. However, no awards are given to a group or community as a whole. The <i>groups</i> that I am referring to are WikiProjects mainly, along with other organisations such as <a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza">Esperanza</a>, <a href="../../../w/e/l/Wikipedia%7EWelcoming_Commitee_5883.html" title="Wikipedia:Welcoming Commitee">Welcoming Commitee</a> and even the Kindness Campaign!</p>
<p><b>Eg.</b> Person "X" has made a certain amount of edits and a certain amount of valuable work, enough to recieve a barnstar. In WikiProject ---, Persons "A","B","C" and "D" have done about half the amount of valuble work and edits than Person "X", not enough to deserve a barnstar or any other award. <b>BUT</b> as a team, they have done twice the amount of work. Remember, Wikipedia is a community and the community should be thanked. <b><font style="background: lightblue"><a href="../../../d/a/g/User%7EDaGizza_4a9b.html" title="User:DaGizza"><font color="darkblue">D</font></a><a href="../../../d/a/g/User%7EDaGizza_4a9b.html" title="User:DaGizza"><font color="blue">a</font></a><a href="../../../d/a/g/User%7EDaGizza_4a9b.html" title="User:DaGizza"><font color="yellow">Gizza</font></a></font></b> <i><sup><a href="../../../d/a/g/User_talk%7EDaGizza_180b.html" title="User talk:DaGizza"><font color="orange">Chat</font></a></sup></i> 01:32, 14 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>How about something for Wikipedians who have achieved at least 5 or more nominations of Wikipedia's newest articles which were featured on Wikipedia's Did You Know? section on the Main Page? I suggest that successful nominations for someone else's new article should count equally with self-created new article nominations. It's a lot of work either way. the DYK section helps keep the Main Page vital. There is a bit of healthy competition among editors currently. Someone else with art talent will need to come up with an appropriate image for the award: I just write and edit, I don't draw!</p>

<dd>As mentioned in the previous discussion, a DYK Barnstar seemed too narrow for an official award, so how about using the Trailblazer concept for creating new articles? A possible image could be the barnstar to the left; green suggests growth and newness.

<dd>Hmm. Not bad but not really great.

<dd>Though I may be a bit biased (I proposed the original idea)&#160;:-), I think that we should have a Trailblazer barnstar. As I said in the archived discussion, I imagined a fire-red barnstar with a zig-zag path/trail behind. I'm not an artist, though (don't even have Photoshop!), so I couldn't create this myself.

<dd>The trail reminds me of the video of the Challenger disaster. What's with the squiggle-zig-zag? Some straighter traces would be better.

<dd>Ah... I wasn't sure exactly what you meant by "trail", but your drawing effectively clears that up.&#160;:) By the way, do you want the trail to come from only one point of the star? <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESango123_0773.html" title="User:Sango123"><font color="darkblue">Sango</font></a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="green">123</font></a> <a href="../../../s/a/n/User_talk%7ESango123_3e3e.html" title="User talk:Sango123"><font color="darkblue">(talk)</font></a> 22:06, 24 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As they say, a picture is worth a thousand words.&#160;:-) I'm not sure, I really didn't think about that. Maybe try one version like that, another version where the trail comes from the bottom two points, and another version where the trail is in the middle? See what looks the best.

<dd>I second vaoverland's view. I just don't see it falling in place somehow and i'm also unable to imagine. but keep the ideas coming since I'm not good at artsy things. maybe how about changing the image idea to one I had proposed initially like a "sparkling barnstar" (silver color probably) That would be also different.

<p>Welp, the first idea for a DYK barnstar (also available in non-animated version!)... other ideas would just be a circle with the DYK-updated&#160;? mark in it, or more emphasis on a shiny-new theme instead of a question/information theme...

<dd>I strongly believe that the barnstar or medal should be exclusive to DYK. We hv a FA medal, why not for DYK which is the second feature of the Main Page? And while we are at it, we can have the cutoffs as 5 DYK entries (self-noms), 8 DYK entries (articles created by me but DYK suggested by others) and 15 DYK entries (articles created by others but suggested by me). No need for a hard and fast rule - for example, I may self-nom 4 suggestions but nominate other articles 3 times etc. I like the last version by Bushytails (the one with a single "?" and shining barnstar), though I'd want to see a version where the star is below the question mark, as if the <b>?</b> is a hanger from which the barnstar is hung.

<p>I like the idea of an award for DYK, since I do most of the updates I know the frequent and highly quality contributors, and I can think of 5-6 users that I would give the award to now. Since I'm potentially in a postition where I would award this barnstar- I don't think a numerical limit (4 DYKs = 1 barstar) is a workable or desirable, my criteria would be based on the quailty of new article, the supply of articles with free pics and the contributors persistence for example 8 DYKs over 6 weeks over a range of subjects. I can also think of at least one RC patroller that suggests lots of new artilces and has done so over a few months who I think would be a candidate. Also, I like Bushytails simplified, less sucky version, but the question makr should be bigger.--<a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPetaholmes_6f6f.html" title="User:Petaholmes">nixie</a> 10:15, 6 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Bigger enough? I don't have the font used for the DYK-updated image, so had to pick another font... trying to scale the little image bigger was rather ugly... I could vectorize it and scale the vectorized version (I need one of those photography/image barnstars. &#160;:), but I figure that for now, a different font is ok... I kinda like the shining version better (with the blinkies every 5 seconds), and it isn't too over-animated.

<p>A silver barnstar would be a tad too similar to the <a href="../../../r/e/s/Image%7EResilient-silver.png_cdb7.html" title="Image:Resilient-silver.png">Resilient Barnstar</a>. I think the question mark alone works well, as it's simple and concisely portrays the DYK aspect. Any extra animation might draw focus away from the barnstar's purpose (although the sparkles on the Bushytails' third version are quite pretty.&#160;;-) The fourth version would look great with a solidly colored question mark, possibly beveled or embossed. Any thoughts? <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESango123_0773.html" title="User:Sango123"><font color="#00008B">Sango</font></a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="#008000">123</font></a> <a href="../../../s/a/n/User_talk%7ESango123_3e3e.html" title="User talk:Sango123"><font color="#00008B">(talk)</font></a> 19:11, 27 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I had previously spoken of a version where the star is below the question mark, as if the <b>?</b> is a hanger from which the barnstar is hung.

<dd>How about something that isn't a barnstar? Maybe a gold questionmark? Barnstars seem really special and shouldn't be introduced too willynilly (I think I have minor standing to make suggestions but not to participate in consensus discussion itself, as I've had 5 selfnoms selected as main page DYKs... not sure that merits a barnstar, really, but something small/minor might be nice.) There ARE people who deserve barnstars for their work on this, but those would be the admins who do the moving around gruntwork... and those could be handled with existing barnstars, IMHO. ++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 18:33, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Draft 1 of Inclusiveness Barnstar</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>This barnstar is to be awarded to anyone, by anyone for recognition of efforts to incorporate contributions made by multiple contributors with multiple bodies of research. Many different people from many different backgrounds often come together when working on an article. Making sure that every piece of input is considered and given the appropriate voice can often mean the difference between a weak article and a solid one. Those who are able to successfully integrate differeny streams of input and varying interpretations with eachother are furthering the collaborative cause.</p>
<p>The idea for the graphic is basically a star with different coloured orbs about it. The orbs represent the different pieces of information that need to be weighed. Each one is in a different position relative to the star to symbolize the fact that different people come from different places and backgrounds. In the center of the star is a swirly-magjig intended to signify the coming together of the varying sources and contributions. <a href="../../../y/o/n/User%7EYonkeltron_62c8.html" title="User:Yonkeltron">yonkeltron</a> 11:25, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Subsequent comments should be made in a new section. After reviewing the Barnstars and awards that have been placed recently, I have found that many of the awards have no documentation in the archives pages. I imagine, assuming good faith, that I just couldn't find the discussions.</p>
<p>However, in some cases the awards were just created and placed on the page, and in several cases the awards were placed after they had been rejected by the community.</p>
<p>I wanted to bring attention to the fact that people have been throwing awards up onto the page without going through the 'process.' I think that letting people just add stars to the page defeats the whole idea of having a process. there are a number of stars that have been rejected as proposals. It's about fairness.</p>
<p>I am going to list the ones I found below. I recommend that we do three things. First, we formalize how a wikiprojects can have their barnstars placed on the page. Second, we organize the “Other Related Awards” page, and third, we move the wikiproject stars to the Barnstar page, and finally, we clean up the PUA page.</p>
<p>I would also hope that by doing this, there will be some more interest in helping to clean-up the pages, which are right now rather chaotic. I did not include all the images on the PUA page, like the birthday cakes, because I think there should be some place for good cheer.&#160;:-) <a href="../../../e/v/r/User%7EEvrik_3a44.html" title="User:Evrik">evrik</a> 23:27, 23 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I also propose that we make a decision on this group of awards after two weeks (April 7, 2006). <a href="../../../e/v/r/User%7EEvrik_3a44.html" title="User:Evrik">evrik</a> 20:55, 24 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Many of these awards existed long before I created the Proposals page (WikiMedal for Janitorial Service, Cool as a Cucumber Award, Atlas Award). Some of them were discussed on the <a href="../../../b/a/r/Wikipedia_talk%7EBarnstars_0133.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Barnstars">Wikipedia talk:Barnstars</a> page (I think the Exceptional Newcomer Award was), but many of the PUA's were just added as you said. The former two were "grandfathered" in, so to speak, and to be honest I think that a real review of them has been a long time coming. – <a href="../../../c/l/o/User%7EClockworkSoul_d5aa.html" title="User:ClockworkSoul">Clockwork</a><a href="../../../c/l/o/User_talk%7EClockworkSoul_028f.html" title="User talk:ClockworkSoul"><b>Soul</b></a> 01:14, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I believe that each Wikiproject should be able to give out an award if it chooses, but should we account for that here in the guidelines? If not the award, what about its placement? I was bold and moved all the Wikiproject Awards from the two pages where they were placed and moved them all togther onto a third (as this seemed like a good compromise) <a href="../../../o/t/h/Wikipedia%7EOther_awards_c564.html#Wikiproject_Awards" title="Wikipedia:Other awards">Wikipedia:Other awards#Wikiproject_Awards</a>.</p>

<p>Please feel free to add the cricket barnstar and bat to the list, if you so wish, but I can't see any reason why <a href="../../../c/r/i/WP%7ECRIC_f681.html" title="WP:CRIC">WP:CRIC</a> should not continue to award both of them. Quite why <a href="../../../e/v/r/User%7EEvrik_3a44.html" title="User:Evrik">Evrik</a> felt sufficiently moved to delete the bat from the project page and various participants' user pages is beyond me. I have reverted the ones I have found.</p>
<p>As for a "goundswell of support", it would be nice to at least post a notice on a WikiProject's talk page if you are thinking of mucking about with its awards. -- <a href="../../../a/l/o/User%7EALoan_b332.html" title="User:ALoan">ALoan</a> <a href="../../../a/l/o/User_talk%7EALoan_3527.html" title="User talk:ALoan">(Talk)</a> 13:08, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>If you look at the rest of the awards, you'll see that each wikiproject has only one award listed. The purpose of posting all of them was to generate some discussion. Personally, if the cricket people want two. I'm fine with that, but they should only get one listed on this page like everyone ese. --<a href="../../../e/v/r/User%7EEvrik_3a44.html" title="User:Evrik">evrik</a> 14:28, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Before this is archived, I want to address one issue - is this an award, a star, or a barnstar? Past precedent would be to name this as a star or award - mainly because it wasn't developed on this page, but was placed here after the fact. In fact, the cricket community has seemed resentful that its awards have been put up for review as part of their listing on this page. I am inclined to let the community decide. --<a href="../../../e/v/r/User%7EEvrik_3a44.html" title="User:Evrik">evrik</a> 14:54, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>A second issue would be how many awards will this community be allowed to list on this page. I'm inclined to say one, the Star, as an issue of fairness to the other awards listed here. --<a href="../../../e/v/r/User%7EEvrik_3a44.html" title="User:Evrik">evrik</a> 14:54, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I propose that we remove all of the "personal user awards" from here: they're creations by individuals that are <i>meant</i> to be outside of the "community" barnstars. We simply have no right to go and decide whether they should or shouldn't exist. – <a href="../../../c/l/o/User%7EClockworkSoul_d5aa.html" title="User:ClockworkSoul">Clockwork</a><a href="../../../c/l/o/User_talk%7EClockworkSoul_028f.html" title="User talk:ClockworkSoul"><b>Soul</b></a> 15:02, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The guidelines (I don't know if they're changed already) says that anybody can add awards to the PUA according to the favour, and PUA moderators should check out for other awards inside the community and list them there. PUAs don't have, and never had, to go through a proposal of acceptance to be placed. It's, maybe therefore, a common practice for BAP and PUA moderators to put rejected barnstars onto PUA. On many occasions, when a user proposes a new PUA, mods of BAP ask them to put the award <i>directly</i> onto PUA, because BAP is not a location to discuss PUA. It's just a place to debate about the general barnstars. Anybody can create whatever PUA they like. --<a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDeryck_Chan_2dc3.html" title="User:Deryck Chan"><font color="green">D</font></a><a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDeryck_Chan_Esperanza_f5cd.html" title="User:Deryck Chan/Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDeryck_Chan_2dc3.html" title="User:Deryck Chan"><font color="brown">ryc</font></a><a href="../../../d/e/r/User_talk%7EDeryck_Chan_4045.html" title="User talk:Deryck Chan"><font color="#007DFF">k C.</font></a> 15:27, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>An additional comment: as per ClockworkSoul, <b>BAP has no rights to overrule PUA</b>. PUA is a free community (at least freer than the barnstar proposal area).

I'm not even a "full member" of the project, I just had that image lying around (it was a proposed and rejected Mac project <i>logo</i>), decided to make it an award instead of deleting it, handed it out to someone and put in on <a href="../../../p/u/a/WP%7EPUA_9bb4.html" title="WP:PUA">WP:PUA</a>. While I'm sure that WP:MAC has nothing <i>against</i> this award, I just want to note that it has not been voted on, discussed or institutionalized by any project, a fact that (while being completely insignificant to me) seems to matter a lot here. On the other hand, if it pleases you the project could "officially" adopt it, but this might take a while and I'm not in the mood to initiate the proceedings, since I frankly don't care. --<span style="font-family:monospace">&#160;<a href="../../../g/r/m/User%7EGrm_wnr_b9ae.html" title="User:Grm wnr">grm_wnr</a></span> <a href="../../../g/r/m/User_talk%7EGrm_wnr_e8bc.html" title="User talk:Grm wnr"><span style="border:1px solid;color:black;font-size:9px;padding:2px 1px 0px 1px">Esc</span></a> 16:43, 28 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Answer</b> one of the reasons I put these up here was to try and put some order to the pages. If you feel it should be a topic PUA, then when this review is over, we can edit the description to reflect that. Have you posted your thoughts on the WikiProject Macintosh page? <a href="../../../e/v/r/User%7EEvrik_3a44.html" title="User:Evrik">evrik</a> 21:37, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I propose that if in the next week the award doesn't get a groundswell of support from its wikiproject or other users that we just place it on the PUA Page as a PUA, and not a barnstar or a wikiproject award. <a href="../../../e/v/r/User%7EEvrik_3a44.html" title="User:Evrik">evrik</a> 16:10, 17 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Opppose</b> The design and name are too reminscient of an actual military award. We shouldn't conflate actual military experience with helping out on articles, even in the small way of using a similar symbol. It is disrespectful to the veterans of everyone's armed forces. I would support if the symbol were the barnstary affixed to a bayonet or some similar symbol. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 05:40, 24 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Support</b>, obviously. And as per ClockworkSoul, the Military history WikiProject arrived at a consensus to use this award (over a <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Military_history_Archive_20_9c94.html#Project_award" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Military history/Archive 20">number of other options</a>); where it is to be listed is open for discussion, but it is hardly under the purview of this page to disallow an award entirely unrelated to it. Finally, I'd point out that it would be polite to <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Military_history_4800.html#Project_award_issue" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Military history">notify the project</a> of this discussion. <a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirill_Lokshin_7618.html" title="User:Kirill Lokshin">Kirill Lok</a><font color="green">s</font><font color="#960018">h</font><a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirill_Lokshin_7618.html" title="User:Kirill Lokshin">in</a> 02:59, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Mildly Oppose</b> I never liked the design of the award and felt it deviates too much from the standard barnstar; the barnstar is actually a tiny proportion of the image. I'm also not a fan of these "awards" as they tend to political and in honesty kind of meaningless. Given the inevitability of really good work going unnoticed because the main contributors are humble enough not to push their own work, I'd say the trouble of granting these types of awards is largely wasted. Sorry, Kirill, no offence but as valuable as the Military wiki project is, I see no need for their own award. I think fewer awards for ALL wikipedia articles would be much better. It's kind of like having Academy Awards but just for war movies. It diminishes the award and makes the category itself look like a fringe. Good military articles should be recognized as good Wikipedia articles - not "just" good <i>military</i> wikipedia articles.<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Dorosh_6aa0.html" title="User:Michael Dorosh">Michael Dorosh</a> 03:15, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The current wanted barnstar looks very silly, as it is actually a milk carton folded. I suggest it be replaced with a sort of "Poster" rather than an ID card.</p>
