<p>146.124.141.250 made again a lot of changes in the text on Liberal democracy, forgetting that Wikipedia should be neutral. I will try to change the text later. Your suggestion to integrate Liberal democracy into Democracy is positive but we might have to integrate more articles, like representative democracy and direct democracy. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilfried_Derksen_4ed6.html" title="User:Wilfried Derksen">Gangulf</a> 14:23, 2 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Sorry to bother you, but you seem to know what you're doing on Wikipedia. I was viewing the article on Freedom of Speech, and I deleted the whole text and left it only with "[censored]" (sorry, but I couldn't resist). I don't want to be an ass and have you clean up after me, but I know there's an easy way to bring back the previous version and unfortunately I don't know how it's done. So if you would be so kind as to fix it, I would appreciate it very much. Sorry for the trouble!</p>
<pre>
Don't worry about it.  Someone came along 12 minutes after you made 
your change and <a href="../../../r/e/v/Wikipedia%7ERevert_d321.html" title="Wikipedia:Revert">wikipedia:revert</a> it to the previous version.  On 
<a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">wikipedia</a> you can click on the tab <a href="../../../h/i/s/Wikipedia%7EHistory_7261.html" title="Wikipedia:History">wikipedia:history</a> to view 
previous versions of a page.  If you select a previous version and 
then save it you can restore an old version of the page that is not
vandalised.  But hey don't do it again! <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarnaby_dawson_0c30.html" title="User:Barnaby dawson">Barnaby dawson</a> 21:06, 27 Aug 2004 (UTC)

<p><br />
Tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>use a lowercase 'a' in See also</li>
<li>you can use a : to indent text instead of using preformatted text by adding a space to the beginning of the line</li>
</ul>
<p>By the way, I don't think it would be best to link to wikibooks that do not appear to be very complete yet. It's up to you, though. <a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDysprosia_bc6d.html" title="User:Dysprosia">Dysprosia</a> 13:42, 28 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hello. I notice you been adding a huge number of "See also" sections, with a capital "A" in "Also". As you see in <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia%7EManual_of_Style_350a.html" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style">Wikipedia:Manual of Style</a>, lower-case is conventional here. Thus</p>

<p>Barnaby, I did leave some notes on the talk page why I had no doubt that this link was propaganda. If you will read my notes and see the article on propaganda, I think you will have to agree that this link is classic propaganda, even though you may agree with it. If you still disagree, for the sake of harmony, please by all means change it back. --<a href="../../../h/2/o/User%7EH2O_a495.html" title="User:H2O">H2O</a> 10:52, 7 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Barnaby, I moved the EDD talk from my personal talk to the <a href="../../../d/i/r/Direct_democracy.html" title="Direct democracy">Direct democracy</a> talk, where I responded.

<p>From User page:</p>
<ul>
<li>What you've done is very good. I'm actually experiencing sibling-rivalry-like pangs because I started working on this—you can see what I've got on <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_temp_dd96.html" title="User:Dpbsmith/temp">User:Dpbsmith/temp</a>—but what you've got is much more straightforward and to the point. I might come back and polish it sometime. What I've written myself currently has too much in it about numbers and intuition and not enough about 0/0.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I think you should definitely copy what you have to a temporary location somewhere in case the 0/0 page does get deleted. I'm not sure where this material should go. It could go in <a href="../../../d/i/v/Division_by_zero.html" title="Division by zero">Division by zero</a> or <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indeterminate_form.html" title="Indeterminate form">Indeterminate form</a> or possibly on a new page, <a href="../../../z/e/r/Zero_divided_by_zero.html" title="Zero divided by zero">Zero divided by zero</a>. I'm going to these comments on Michael Hardy's talk page, too, and see if he has any thoughts.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Actually, I have a technical question for Michael Hardy. It's one of the things that has hung me up a bit. What is the most correct answer to the question "What is the value of sin(0)/0?" I guess the question is, what is the meaning of "sin(0)/0"? If it means the value of sin(0) divided by 0, then the answer is "indeterminate" or "NaN" (not a number), as I don't believe 0/0 is part of any definition of "number" that has ever been proposed. On the other hand, if it means "the limit of sin(x)/x as x approaches zero," the answer is not indeterminate at all, it is 1. It just "feels wrong" to me to say that sin(0)/0 is indeterminate, though; I feel that it "is" 1. Thoughts?</li>
</ul>
<p>I am sorry that Michael Hardy has chosen to bite your finger instead of looking where you were pointing. Apparently he is not sympathetic to the needs of those at a lower level of mathematical sophistication than himself....

<p>Hello Barnaby, a couple of comments in response to your message. (1) The previous content of <a href="../../../0/2F/0/0_0_aa00.html" title="0/0">0/0</a> is still recoverable after a redirect; you can find it in the page history. If you want to restore <a href="../../../0/2F/0/0_0_aa00.html" title="0/0">0/0</a>, take it up on <a href="../../../0/2F/0/Talk%7E0_0_0f24.html" title="Talk:0/0">talk:0/0</a>. Making a new page (<a href="../../../z/e/r/Zero_divided_by_zero.html" title="Zero divided by zero">zero divided by zero</a> in this case) because of an edit conflict is frowned upon, I'm afraid. I'll probably redirect <a href="../../../z/e/r/Zero_divided_by_zero.html" title="Zero divided by zero">zero divided by zero</a> to <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indeterminate_form.html" title="Indeterminate form">indeterminate form</a> unless some good reason to keep it separate comes up in discussion in the next few days. (2) Yes, I know that the page was revised after being listed on vfd. However, I'm generally in agreement w/ Mike Hardy that the revised page is still weak; that's why I redirected it. One comment on the text at this point is that a basic or simple explanation is usually not a lengthy explanation; my advice, if you care, is to strive for concision at all levels of mathematics.

<dl>
<dd>The new version is a completely new text from the old version. If you read the talk page of <a href="../../../z/e/r/Zero_divided_by_zero.html" title="Zero divided by zero">zero divided by zero</a> you will find that the intention is to incorporate parts of the text into <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indeterminate_form.html" title="Indeterminate form">indeterminate form</a>. I didn't know there was any established ettiquiete for what to do if you rewrite an article that is up for deletion or redirection and that is lost through the decision upon that page. If the article had not been up for deletion then I would have reverted you and asked for an explanation but I just assumed you were taking action upon the voting on 0/0. Explanations maybe short (as indeed is the one given in the article) but supporting examples may take more space and exposing the errors in reasoning that cause people to think 0/0 has a numerical value is not without use either. Why not work with me to incorporate as much as possible of the text of zero divided by zero into the article on indeterminate form or other articles where it is relevent? Once this has been done I do agree the article can be redirected. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarnaby_dawson_0c30.html" title="User:Barnaby dawson">Barnaby dawson</a> 17:22, 20 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hello Barnaby. About <a href="../../../0/2F/0/0_0_aa00.html" title="0/0">0/0</a>, after further reflection I think it should be redirected to <a href="../../../d/i/v/Division_by_zero.html" title="Division by zero">division by zero</a> and any further development on the topic of 0/0 should go there. I might work on that soon. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWile_E._Heresiarch_9879.html" title="User:Wile E. Heresiarch">Wile E. Heresiarch</a> 15:17, 21 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Barnaby, I saw that you restored comments to my user page, as you stated this is etiquette. However I believe I am not breaking any rules by editing my own page if I wish to do so, and I had very good reason to edit it. Please do not restore things to my user page or talk page again, if people wish to look at the history that is their choice. I am not greatly concerned with etiquette, as I had good reason to edit. AmyNelson.</p>
<p>Barnaby, your note on my page reads like a threat, I dont beleive I would be banned for deleting something I felt necessary on my own page and I dont appreciate your suggestion. Please DO NOT post on my talk page again, I will now have to further delete your unwelcome "possibilty of banning" note!

<p>Thanks for your comment on the infobox I put into the Mafia article. I know there are version in which you play with less than the 7 players I mentioned, but those would be, IIRC, variants to the normal game. That's why I didn't mention them.

<p>i put this on the page ... i figured i'd put it here too just in case:) -- i really appreciate your help with this stuff:). i guess the question i'm left with is this: "what's the NORM for this variation? what are we comparing it TO?" because after we differentiated from the single-celled organisms, they would have gone through MANY MILLIONS of more generations than we would have (because our lifespans got longer while theirs stayed the same) ... same thing with the chimps, who reach sexual maturity at age 8 ... so their non-coding segments would have had much more opportunity to vary than ours -- how can we COMPARE the degrees of randomness, to show relationship? what's our null? any thoughts? <a href="../../../u/n/g/User%7EUngtss_3d2c.html" title="User:Ungtss">Ungtss</a> 04:11, 3 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>It's not exactly the generations in bacteria that count its the rate of mutation and yes it is higher in bacteria. However, we can take that into account in our calculations and get a better figure for when a creatures line split from the prokaryotes. In sexual species the life span is more relevent but I think comparisons are often done on mitochondrial DNA which doesn't undergo sexual recombination. In plants chloroplasts are used to.</p>
<p>None of this effects the structure of the relationships between species. A non-tree relationship would generally remain so even if we got mutation rates wrong. What we do get is a distorted picture of when certain evolutionary events happened. Because of this many people work on ways to gauge rates of mutation. If I know two species originate from one species and I have a third closely related to those two then I can calculate how much mutation appears to have occured in each. The third species lets me judge what the original gene looked like when the two were one species. This allows me to see how variable the mutation rates are.</p>
<p>One thing that is difficult to gauge like this is large scale variations in mutation rates (maybe some star went supernova). This would distort the tree we get in that every organism (in our tree) 5 million years old might look like its 5.5 million years old (because all were subject to higher mutation rates for 2 million years). We can rule out the bigger such possible effects by looking at the geological strata and comparing age estimates for species that appear in there with age estimates obtained by phylogenetic trees. There will be some residual error which is too small to register in this comparison. Also, we can assume that the mutation rate wasn't drastically higher because we know mutation rates higher than a certain value will kill creatures. Like a lot of science in this area we obtain estimates from all available sources and compare them. While each individual estimate may have a high variance the estimates combined will have a low variance.

<p>"Deep limestone deposits are most reasonably explained as rapidly precipitating when CO2 suddenly escapes from carbonate-saturated ground water" - Limestone can be formed in many ways, in fact anywhere CaCO<sub>3</sub> accumulates, you can get limestone. This quote is probably talking about some unusual formation or something, but can't be refering to the way <i>all</i> limestone is formed. Without knowing what the author means by "Deep limestone deposit", the quote is rather meaningless. In short, this needs further elaboration as to what the writer is trying to support by using this quote and what the original author of the article was saying.</p>
<p>"Uniformitarian explanations fail because gradualism predicts a great deal of mixing in the formation of limestone, which is not observed." What..? Who says "mixing" is needed? All that's needed is accumulation of calcium carbonate and a little heat and pressure. There is no "mixing" needed.</p>
<p>"Further, for every molecule of limestone that precipitates, a carbon ion is released, predicting an equivalent amount of carbon in the atmospheres and seas as in limestone formations, while the amount of carbon in limestone on Earth exceeds the amount of carbon in the atmosphere and seas combined by almost 2000 times." Every molecule of limestone? Why is carbon released? Released from what? Why does the carbon "released" from CaCO<sub>3</sub> have to equal that in the atmosphere? And you'd expect carbon levels to be higher in surface rock than in the atmosphere. Why do they have to be the same? The original article <i>might</i> answer these questions...but we don't know from this quote.</p>
<p>In short: these quotes, to be taken seriously, need more background as to what the gist of the original articles are. The quotes are really meaningless and I wouldn't accept them as supporting anything. If you are going to use them, consider giving some wider context, like stating "In an article where the author tries to prove, observe, relate...", then after giving context go to the specifics of these quotees. They are not so great as they are rather out of context and any careful reader will spot that.</p>
<p>Anyway, my two cents worth. Hope I wasn't too long-winded. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanielCD_4f74.html" title="User:DanielCD">DanielCD</a> 22:21, 29 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Barnaby, I feel your pain. The problem with the views page, as I see it, is that the agenda is set by creationists. Scientists have a wholly separate discussion on the subjects listed, and they are obviously not seen as part of the same agenda. No matter how you format the page it's always going to be on the one side the creationist bollocks about a particular area of science and on the other the completely unconnected scientific explanation of it. But the right hand is rarely an actual refutation of the left (which is why creationists love this kind of thing -- they can make it look as though science ignores this wonderful explanation and this damning evidence they have come up with -- but let's face it, science does not investigate hypotheses such as a gushing fountain of carbon dioxide from an underground reservoir providing all the world's limestone because it's on the face of it ridiculous; it does not give a second's thought to creationist carping about radiometric dating because it simply does not share the belief that radiometric dating was invented solely to con people into believing fossils are old).</p>
<p>Science has its own issues and debates. It barely pays attention to creationists. When it does, it destroys creationist arguments with devastating critique, but frankly it's always going to be on a loser. When you are debating a guy like Sarfati, you are up against a guy who will selectively choose from millions of facts (which scientists do not have the liberty of doing -- their theories must try to fit all the facts if they are to be accepted) and will ignore any counterarguments, or claim that they are motivated by other considerations (scientists cannot do that either -- they can't say "you made these observations to destroy my phlogiston theory because you [insert reason]". They also continuously move the goalposts. You could call it "reformulating the hypothesis" if it weren't for the hypothesis' being completely refuted. Take Behe. He says "you can't evolve a flagellum because it looks too complicated for natural selection". He is shown how and it's pointed out to him that the parts were coopted from other uses as many, many parts of many, many lifeforms are (Behe has to ignore most of the evidence to even begin to have a case, but that is of course what he does: he picks the evidence that he thinks fits best and attacks that). A scientist would simply give up the ghost.</p>
<p>Most importantly, I think, only the left-hand side actually is composed of "views". It's a collection of the wild speculation that creationists indulge in. The right-hand side, if it were really to give the "views" of scientists, would simply quote a Dawkins saying that it's all bollocks made up by charlatans and leave it at that.</p>

<p>So you are a faint-hearted biologist? I honestly doubt that! Please keep in mind, Mr. Dawson, that in no way does your acceptance of evolution have anything to do with being a passionate scientist. You can be critical of neo-Darwinian views, and if they (your collegues) choose to excommunicate you, so to speak, then don't ever let that stop you from becoming a great scientist. In fact, your awareness to the flaws of evolutionary theory technically make <i>you</i> more suited for your practice. Scientists need to be open minded; if they ever lock themselves down on something, they may be missing critical information that could actually be helping them along. Also, why does that quote bother you? You said you weren't a neo-Darwinist, so what's the disagreement about?

<p>Sorry about that, but the comment was not related to you in any way. I didn't even realise the proximity to your comment. It wasn't exactly a polite things to say, and I regret saying it, but the comment was made about Salva - his comment made it apparent that he had either ignored or not read the replies to his question about radiometric dating. His reply started with a comment to "Grant", which Graft changed (with an edit summary something like "argh!". This was after he had fixed his name recently on the same page, I believe (I'd have to look at the diffs). So, I was struck by Salva's failure to digest what we had said to him, <i>and</i> his failure to read Graft's name right...</p>

<p>I have moved Infinite tree (graph theory) here and done a little cleanup. See the <a href="../../../t/r/e/Talk%7ETree_%28set_theory%29_a2ab.html" title="Talk:Tree (set theory)">talk page</a> for rationales. I'd like to put "Infinite tree (graph theory)" on rfd, which I wouldn't want you to see as an unfriendly gesture; it's just not an accurate description of the concept, and the only substantive thing that links there is your user page. Oh, and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_graph_theory_topics.html" title="List of graph theory topics">list of graph theory topics</a>, but that link should really be removed, because these trees aren't a graph-theory topic, to the best of my non-graph-theorist knowledge. --<a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrovatore_c393.html" title="User:Trovatore">Trovatore</a> 03:21, 13 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi and 10x for your reply.</p>
<p>You say that «The catholic church has changed its position on this issue. The document you quote is written by the pope who was in the vatican at the time of the second world war.» - On this topic, there is no possibility of changing of such of point of view. Is is about an Encyclical letter, that affirmes deffinitive teachings.</p>
<p>These days, cardinal Schönborn reminded the position of the RC church on darwinism. <a href="http://wittingshire.blogspot.com/2005/07/catholic-church-rejects-neo-darwinism.html" class="external free" title="http://wittingshire.blogspot.com/2005/07/catholic-church-rejects-neo-darwinism.html" rel="nofollow">http://wittingshire.blogspot.com/2005/07/catholic-church-rejects-neo-darwinism.html</a></p>
<p>You say: «the creation science page gets a lot of vandalism and trolling from those who support creation science». Of course. Guess why.</p>

<dd>Personal opinion: Unless you think that the Wikipedia can do a better job than the Guardian, why try to duplicate the Guardian list? If you are going to try to do a better job than the Guardian, you should contact each of the Regional notice boards and many of the different WikiProjects to help you fill out the list. The one big thing that Wikipedians could do better than the Guardian list is annotate the list pointing out any of the special features on a newspaper's website, such as the online usage guides and country profile pages that I've noted on my Anti-Google page, as well as making note of any inherent biases that a newspaper might have in their coverage and editorial positions. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlankVerse_b65f.html" title="User:BlankVerse"><font color="green"><i>Blank</i></font><font color="#F88017"><i>Verse</i></font></a> <a href="../../../b/l/a/User_talk%7EBlankVerse_add2.html" title="User talk:BlankVerse"><font color="#F660AB">∅</font></a> 08:25, 7 October 2005 (UTC) [PS: I would appreciate your opinion on my Anti-Google page.]</dd>

<dd>The purposes of the lists are different. <a href="../../../n/e/w/Wikipedia%7ENews_sources_bc02.html" title="Wikipedia:News sources">wikipedia:News sources</a> is intended for the purpose of NPOV and for the encyclopedic purposes of wikipedia (it is also meant to be primarily english language). I intend to subdivide each regional area again on the basis of population. I also intend to provide population statistics for each region and country. I like your idea of anotations particularly with regard to bias, although judging it may be tricky. We can also provide links to pages concerning the countries and/or regions linked to. In short I do think that wikipedia can do better.</dd>

<p>Thanks for uploading <b><a href="../../../s/c/o/Image%7EScopes_trial.jpg_9b7b.html" title="Image:Scopes trial.jpg">Image:Scopes trial.jpg</a></b>. I notice the 'image' page currently doesn't specify who created the content, so the <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copyright.html" title="Copyright">copyright</a> status is unclear. If you have not created this media yourself then there needs to be an argument why we have the right to use the media on Wikipedia (see copyright tagging below). If you have not created the media yourself then it needs to be specified where it was found, i.e., in most cases link to the website where it was taken from, and the terms of use for content from that page.</p>
<p>If the media also doesn't have a copyright tag then one should be added. If you created/took the picture, audio, or video then the {{<a href="../../../g/f/d/Template%7EGFDL-self_97c5.html" title="Template:GFDL-self">GFDL-self</a>}} tag can be used to release it under the <a href="../../../g/f/d/GFDL_75b9.html" title="GFDL">GFDL</a>. If you believe the media qualifies as fair use, consider reading <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_a984.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">fair use</a>, and then use a tag such as {{<a href="../../../f/a/i/Template%7EFairusein_19b9.html" title="Template:Fairusein">fairusein</a>|article name}} or one of the other tags listed at <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_copyright_tags_f6dd.html#Fair_use" title="Wikipedia:Image copyright tags">Wikipedia:Image copyright tags#Fair_use</a>. See <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_copyright_tags_f6dd.html" title="Wikipedia:Image copyright tags">Wikipedia:Image copyright tags</a> for the full list of copyright tags that you can use.</p>
<p>If you have uploaded other media, consider checking that you have specified their source and copyright tagged them, too. You can find a list of 'image' pages you have edited by clicking on the "<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Barnaby_dawson_18b9.html" title="Special:Contributions/Barnaby dawson">my contributions</a>" link (it is located at the very top of any Wikipedia page when you are logged in), and then selecting "Image" from the dropdown box. Note that any unsourced and untagged images will be deleted one week after they have been uploaded, as described on <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriteria_for_speedy_deletion_81ee.html#Images.2FMedia" title="Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion">criteria for speedy deletion</a>.

<p>I've added an out of copyright tag to the image as it appears to out of copyright according to my reading of the law (Ianal). Even if I were to be wrong on this I do think it would qualify as fair use as a non reproducible record of an historic event. Incidentally I did add a copyright tag to this page a while back but something seems to have gone wrong with the template. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarnaby_dawson_0c30.html" title="User:Barnaby dawson">Barnaby dawson</a> 08:59, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've moved the discussion back as I find no reason why you would take it upon yourself to "judge it to be very unlikely to result in any improvement of the article" let alone not a relevent discussion. The issues I raise deal solely with the state of the article and are not in any way, shape, or form a debate on evolution. I'd appreciate it if rather than censor the Talk page, you participate in answering the issues you yourself admit are frequently raised. There is no reason to move a dicussion about an article on that article's talk page to another page. —<a href="../../../a/i/d/User%7EAiden_abfd.html" title="User:Aiden"><font color="#077CD0"><b>Aiden</b></font></a> 13:29, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm sorry you feel that way. The talk pages are meant to contain serious discussion of the relevant article. Your comment did not fit that criteria.

<dd>How did it not fit "the criteria"? The points I raised were directly related to the point of view of the article, not of any evidence or lack thereof for evolution.

<dd>Well mainly your factual claims about the article's contents were false. There are sections addressing social effects of the theory and misunderstandings of the theory which you seem to have missed. Just mentioning NPOV is not enough to make a post relevant to the improvement of an article. Also I'm afraid the fact that a lot of people are annoyed at the contents of an article is not in itself sufficient to show that there is any problem with the article. We are talking about a featured article here. The objections raised by creationists to evolution are a complete joke and deserve nothing more than the passing reference they get. This is justified within wikipedia's policies by the fact that this is an article about an area of science and the "creation science" movement is not scientific.</dd>
