<li>The GFDL license doesn't really support "merge and delete" for reasons of keeping a history of contributors. Since you asked this, the article has been closed as "merge and redirect", which is fine with me. I think "Moog records" is an old term used only within a niche, not a made-up term with no currency. It's likely to be a search term but the redirect covers this. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 17:59, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I've put this article up for deletion review, after re-writing a stub focused much more on his non-Survivor notability as a TV host, which was then speedy deleted as a recreation of deleted content.

<p>I vaguely remember hearing his name when he was popular, as I've been a NASCAR fan since the early 1980's. Too bad I never got a chance to see him race. It was extremely easy to find a magazine cover with Evans.</p>
<p>My interest in NASCAR has declined over the past couple of years. Too many 1 to 1.5 D-shaped tracks. Not challenging enough. I concentrate more on NASCAR drivers from the 1980s and 1990s.

I'd have suggested a merge rather than a delete, but I'm not sure the page <i>has</i> any content that would add to <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transactinide_element.html" title="Transactinide element">Transactinide element</a>.

<ul>
<li>Since everything except the name and symbol, which are just the generic "1" "7" "6", are under the unsourced description of "presumably", there doesn't seem to be anything that really needs to be merged. A table of un-un-whatever names up to element 999 wouldn't help <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transactinide_element.html" title="Transactinide element">Transactinide element</a>. Where <i>groups</i> of superheavy elements are predicted in peer-reviewed journals to have certain properties if created, those can be discussed and cited in articles about those groups, as the Elements project commenter suggested; but I don't think the unsourced speculation here needs to be included at the level of individual never-created elements. Nor does this "presumably" chatter need to have attribution kept in TE or hypothetical-element-group articles (which will get citations instead) to satify the GFDL. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 19:01, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Hello. We both are trying to improve the external links organization. For instance, I added the long-overdue Yahoo! link to Diplomacy World since DW stopped posting issues at the old link and people might mistakenly think it defunct. I have a question on the new category. Almost anything can claim to be a hobby service, and anything on the web with a 'zine, Yahoo! group, forum, or mail list or can claim to be an international organization with a membership, so what did you have in mind about the new category that won't see everything get dumped into it, essentially un-doing the categorization advantage? Thank you. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikist_e9e5.html" title="User:Wikist">Wikist</a> 03:14, 31 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>In the 'Diplomacy' hobby, the term "hobby service" has a specific meaning, dating back to about 1968-70. A service relevant to the whole hobby, such as a centralized listing of zines, an orphaned-games rehousing service, or the Boardman Number Custodian, fits this idea. A zine (or these days a website) which just has some hobby news or its own ratings system isn't a hobby service, just a gaming forum with extra features for its own users. The list in this article now tries to categorize by primary function; I think that DW's traditional position as hobby flagship zine remains intact, DC exists to promote cooperation among local/regional/national/continental hobby groups, and DP (not counting its lack of updates) exists as a hobby-wide resource connecting references, player database, the webzine, and so forth. Most of the other big websites exist mainly for players to play games and to learn about events in their own geographic or online space; their "hobby service" features, if any, are secondary, so they should not go into this group. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 17:45, 31 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Thank you for the clarification on "service," which seems to be the crux. Most 'zines are "places" to play but DW is a service. I am going to end here and cross-post this on Diplomacy talk to inform future editors.<a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikist_e9e5.html" title="User:Wikist">Wikist</a> 12:57, 1 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>You seem to be in touch with the NASCAR Modified series. Please consider writing an article for the series. Here's a cool website that you could use if you choose to write the article: <a href="http://www.petesracingsite.com/index.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.petesracingsite.com/index.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. A cool related list would be NASCAR's list of Top 10 NASCAR Modified drivers: <a href="http://www.nascar.com/2003/news/headlines/official/top_ten/09/12/top10_modified/index.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nascar.com/2003/news/headlines/official/top_ten/09/12/top10_modified/index.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. Any article that I would write would likely pale in comparison to what you could do. I will eventually write an article if you don't.

<li>Another good source is <a href="http://www.modseriesscene.com/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.modseriesscene.com/" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. Okay, I'll try to get a proper stub started (in the next couple of days) with a couple of reference links, then we can both add details and have the community develop the article.

<li>Article drafted as a subpage of my userpage. Needs most champions added into table. Needs series logo, needs picture of a NASCAR Modified. None of either in Wikicommons. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 01:00, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>

<li>
<ul>
<li>Why didn't you just cut and paste the article? I don't care about the talk page. The days of waiting for the move will prohibit it from DYK consideration. I think this article is worthy, except possibly if its too long. I guess its too late now. <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyalbroil_3602.html" title="User:Royalbroil">Royalbroil</a> 04:00, 13 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Cut-and-paste moves lose the contribution history, as well as the talk page. The how-to page I read about page moves recommends <i>not</i> using cut-and-paste moves; it has instructions on how to fix it if cut-and-paste is done accidentally. Maybe I'm not aware of DYK policies and practices (never cared much about the front page), but I don't see what difference the delay makes. It seems like a more complete and documented article is a more important factor than how new the article is.

<p>Hello, I found out that Jimmy Spencer raced only one race in ASA, but he won it. It was in 1993 at Brainerd International Raceway.</p>
<p>To me the American Speed Association driver category is for any driver who raced at least one race in ASA. Do you think drivers who was not full time ASA drivers be allowed in the category? I personally think that anyone who raced a single race should be, but that is my opinion. Thank you <a href="../../../b/d/m/User%7EBdman_8089.html" title="User:Bdman">Bdman</a> 21:26, 09 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I don't have a problem with that definition, as long as we're using it consistently with how WP uses similar categories. Certainly it's notable that Spencer won that ASA race, so he should get this category tag, but some ARCA or IMCA racer who tried one ASA show and didn't win might not be such a clear choice. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 15:56, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I can hardly use Wikipedia, but you bet that's not a hoax. I added some refs and if you want one of the Annual Reports just drop me an e-mail at IvyEmporiums@aol.com. If you want ironic, our lawyer is now backing a startup company called Terrasphere that was originally started as a company that created grow-rooms for cannabis cultivators. This is like, nearly twenty years after we nearly made rhe cannabis plant legal as the source of a pure pharmaceutical, Laucence McKinney</p>

<p>Barno, I would implore you to change your vote on Julia Sinedia-Cazour. First off, the case was validated by Jean-Marie Robine (who verified the Jeanne Calment case) and Julia was rated as the world's 10th-oldest person at the time of her death. This may not seem like much to a lay observer, but when you consider that the well-publicized <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_Allingham_bca0.html" title="Henry Allingham">Henry Allingham</a> is ranked just 66th in the world right now, then perhaps it will start to sink in. We do in fact have multiple sources, including www.grg.org, www.genarians.com, and many French articles covering a period of years. Also, I find it ironic that Madame Cazour, who faced much discrimination in her lifetime and was a social activist for justice, would now be faced with another battle in her death. France still has an 'empire' (i.e. places like New Caledonia, Reunion, French Guiana, French Polynesia, etc) and thus Julia was the 'oldest ever' among quite a large collection of entitites.</p>

<p>Hi Barno, Thanks for your input into this discussion. You wrote 'I don't know many of the facts, especially whether major magazines have included featured coverage that shows probable "lasting influence" as compared to "only passing attention".' But some of the sources cited were published 15 years after the court-martial. Surely this shows some sort of "lasting influence"? warm regards <a href="../../../a/b/u/User%7EAbu_ali_1028.html" title="User:Abu ali">Abu ali</a> 08:56, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>(I've added discussion in that AfD of why that is not always true, although it's often an indicator in that direction.) <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 04:42, 29 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Thanks for your input. You wrote "Many newspapers and magazines have small-print filler sections of what went on five, ten, fifteen, twenty years ago." Do you think that the references discussed in the deletion debate (especially the books cited by RonaldR) fall into this category? You also said "If the newer articles demonstrate that the court-martial itself had a lot of lasting influence, then (when properly cited) they should help the relist end as <b>keep</b>." In the light of this comment, would you be prepared to change your vote to a <b>relist</b>? <a href="../../../a/b/u/User%7EAbu_ali_1028.html" title="User:Abu ali">Abu ali</a> 10:03, 29 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I already noted there that I favored a relist if closing admin saw it that way. The way deletion review works, I don't need to reverse my endorsement of the previous deletion (which was appropriate given the information available then) in order to favor a relist <i>based on the new information</i>, which is how I described my vote. Thank you for trying to cite sources and get the topic reconsidered within WP's rules. Perhaps the trial's facts and consequences should be merged to the new article titled by Keller's name, rather than have the article be about the court-martial itself. I suggest discussing with other editors whether the lasting effect was from the court-martial itself, or the protests and advocacy; again I haven't read in enough depth to judge fairly. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 00:50, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
