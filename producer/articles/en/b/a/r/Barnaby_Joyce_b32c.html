<p><b>Barnaby Thomas Gerald Joyce</b> (born <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_17.html" title="April 17">17 April</a> <a href="../../../1/9/6/1967.html" title="1967">1967</a>), <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australian</a> politician, has been a member of the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Senate_6fa9.html" title="Australian Senate">Australian Senate</a> representing the state of <a href="../../../q/u/e/Queensland.html" title="Queensland">Queensland</a> since July 2005. He is a member of the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Party_of_Australia_5507.html" title="National Party of Australia">National Party of Australia</a>. Joyce was born in <a href="../../../t/a/m/Tamworth%2C_New_South_Wales_9abf.html" title="Tamworth, New South Wales">Tamworth, New South Wales</a>, and was brought up in Danglemah. One of six children from a sheep-and-cattle farming family, he attended <a href="../../../s/t/_/St_Ignatius%27_College%2C_Riverview_d176.html" title="St Ignatius' College, Riverview">St Ignatius' College, Riverview</a>, in Sydney. His father, James Joyce, was a <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Zealander_d396.html" title="New Zealander">New Zealander</a> who moved to <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australia</a> to study <a href="../../../v/e/t/Veterinary_science.html" title="Veterinary science">veterinary science</a> at <a href="../../../s/y/d/Sydney_University_37f4.html" title="Sydney University">Sydney University</a> where he met Barnaby's mother, Marie, and they made their living as farmers.</p>
<p>Joyce graduated with a commerce degree from the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_New_England_c127.html" title="University of New England">University of New England</a> in <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armidale%2C_New_South_Wales_31dc.html" title="Armidale, New South Wales">Armidale</a>, and served in the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Army_Reserve_21e1.html" title="Australian Army Reserve">Australian Army Reserve</a> from 1994 to 1999. At university Joyce met his future wife, Natalie, who is part <a href="../../../l/e/b/Lebanon.html" title="Lebanon">Lebanese</a>. His parents were opposed to the marriage and no one from his family attended the 1993 wedding. After graduating, Joyce moved around northern New South Wales and Queensland, and at one point worked as a <a href="../../../d/o/o/Doorman.html" title="Doorman">bouncer</a>. Joyce worked in the Accounting Profession before entering Parliament and is a FCPA (Fellow of <a href="../../../c/p/a/CPA_Australia_a3c4.html" title="CPA Australia">CPA Australia</a>). The Joyces have four daughters and now live in <a href="../../../s/t/_/St_George%2C_Queensland_4387.html" title="St George, Queensland">St George</a> in western Queensland, where Joyce had an accounting business.</p>
<p>A <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Catholic_3b40.html" title="Roman Catholic">Roman Catholic</a>, Joyce served as President (1998-2004) of the <a href="../../../s/t/_/St_George%2C_Queensland_4387.html" title="St George, Queensland">St George</a> branch of the <a href="../../../s/o/c/Society_of_St_Vincent_de_Paul_bac3.html" title="Society of St Vincent de Paul">Society of St Vincent de Paul</a>. He holds conservative views on most moral and social issues. He took offence at a pamphlet put out by <a href="../../../f/a/m/Family_First_a2bc.html" title="Family First">Family First</a> candidate <a href="../../../d/a/n/Danny_Nalliah_22fc.html" title="Danny Nalliah">Danny Nalliah</a>, which identified brothels, <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freemasonry.html" title="Freemasonry">masonic lodges</a>, <a href="../../../m/o/s/Mosque.html" title="Mosque">mosques</a>, and <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hinduism.html" title="Hinduism">Hindu</a> and <a href="../../../b/u/d/Buddhism.html" title="Buddhism">Buddhist</a> temples as "strongholds of <a href="../../../s/a/t/Satan.html" title="Satan">Satan</a>", and said that he did not want the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_electoral_system.html" title="Australian electoral system">preferences</a> of such a party. Joyce criticised the party, calling them "the lunatic Right", and saying that "these are not the sort of people you do preference deals with".<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> Nonetheless he gained office with preference flows from Family First Party.</p>
<p><a name="Senator" id="Senator"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/r/Barnaby_Joyce_b32c.html" title="Edit section: Senator">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Senator</span></h2>
<p>Joyce was elected to the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Senate_6fa9.html" title="Australian Senate">Senate</a> in the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_legislative_election%2C_2004.html" title="Australian legislative election, 2004">parliamentary election</a> held on <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_9.html" title="October 9">9 October</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>. His term will run until June 2011 unless there is a <a href="../../../d/o/u/Double_dissolution.html" title="Double dissolution">double dissolution</a> election in the meantime. Joyce, regained the seat which the Nationals lost to the <a href="../../../o/n/e/One_Nation_Party_46fb.html" title="One Nation Party">One Nation Party</a> in 1998, defeating the One Nation Senator <a href="../../../l/e/n/Len_Harris_04e8.html" title="Len Harris">Len Harris</a>. The <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberal_Party_of_Australia_e08b.html" title="Liberal Party of Australia">Liberals</a> won three seats in Queensland, making this the first time since the enlargement of the Senate in 1984 that a party or coalition had won four of the six available Senate seats from a single state.</p>
<p>Joyce won 6.5 percent of the vote on first preferences (see <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_electoral_system.html" title="Australian electoral system">Australian electoral system</a>), well short of the 14.3 percent required for election, but made up for lost ground by the flow of second preferences from eliminated candidates of the <a href="../../../f/a/m/Family_First_Party_1e5d.html" title="Family First Party">Family First</a> and <a href="../../../o/n/e/One_Nation_Party_46fb.html" title="One Nation Party">One Nation</a> parties, as well as from the independent candidate, <a href="../../../p/a/u/Pauline_Hanson_2918.html" title="Pauline Hanson">Pauline Hanson</a>. The count attracted considerable media attention because Joyce's election contributed to the ruling <a href="../../../c/o/a/Coalition_%28Australia%29_d450.html" title="Coalition (Australia)">Coalition</a> government having control of the senate for the first time since 1981, a result that few political commentators had expected.</p>
<p>Although Joyce is a member of the ruling Coalition, he said before taking his seat in July 2005 that he would not be a cipher and that the government should not take his support for granted. In particular, he expressed misgivings about the government's proposed sale of <a href="../../../t/e/l/Telstra.html" title="Telstra">Telstra</a>, the partially state-owned telecommunications company, and said that he might vote against the sale unless he and the rest of the party were satisfied that its service in rural areas was adequate and that <a href="../../../p/r/i/Privatization.html" title="Privatization">privatization</a> would not adversely affect it.</p>
<p>Joyce's <a href="../../../m/a/i/Maiden_speech.html" title="Maiden speech">maiden speech</a> to the Senate on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_16.html" title="August 16">August 16</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>, was widely reported in the Queensland media. He expressed his desire to see the power of Australia's retailing duopoly, <a href="../../../c/o/l/Coles_Myer_88f4.html" title="Coles Myer">Coles Myer</a> and <a href="../../../w/o/o/Woolworths_Limited_66db.html" title="Woolworths Limited">Woolworths Limited</a>, reduced so as to protect <a href="../../../s/m/a/Small_business.html" title="Small business">small business</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/n/Consumer_rights.html" title="Consumer rights">consumer rights</a>. He also espoused the virtues of <a href="../../../f/r/e/Free_enterprise.html" title="Free enterprise">free enterprise</a>, particularly at the small business and family-owned business level. As well, having earlier told a Right to Life Conference in July that his greatest goal in public life was to ban "the unfortunate carnage" of abortion, he used his first speech to identify abortion as the "slavery debate of our time".</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_17.html" title="August 17">17 August</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a> the Government announced a package of $3 billion to improve telecommunications services in regional and rural areas. On the basis of this, the National Party, including Joyce, agreed to support the sale of Telstra. This led the Labor Party to label Joyce "Backdown Barney" and "Barnaby Rubble" in an acrimonious parliamentary debate. Joyce voted with the Government in the Senate on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_14.html" title="September 14">14 September</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>, to sell the Government's remaining share of Telstra.</p>
<p>Senator Joyce crossed the floor to vote with the ALP and minor parties on 11 October 2005 on two motions concerning the <a href="../../../t/r/a/Trade_Practices_Act_1974_31d5.html" title="Trade Practices Act 1974">Trade Practices Act 1974</a>. Although both motions were lost 32-32, it was the first time since 1986 that a Government Senator has <a href="../../../c/r/o/Crossed_the_floor.html" title="Crossed the floor">crossed the floor</a>.</p>
<p>Joyce also said that he would not support the Government's "<a href="../../../v/o/l/Voluntary_Student_Unionism_1159.html" title="Voluntary Student Unionism">Voluntary Student Unionism</a>" Bill banning the levying of compulsory service or amenity fees by universities without amendment because he believed it would unfairly disadvantage regional universities. However, Joyce was unsuccessful in his attempt to amend the bill, and subsequently crossed the floor on <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_9.html" title="December 9">9 December</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a> to oppose it. This was ultimately futile as the Government had secured the vote of <a href="../../../f/a/m/Family_First_a2bc.html" title="Family First">Family First</a> Senator <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steve_Fielding_570e.html" title="Steve Fielding">Steve Fielding</a>.</p>
<p>In October 2006 he again crossed the floor, unsuccessfully moving amendments to the government's cross media ownership laws.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>In May 2006 Joyce promoted mining of <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antarctica.html" title="Antarctica">Antarctica</a> (mining is banned under the <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antarctic_Treaty_8cfd.html" title="Antarctic Treaty">Antarctic Treaty</a>). Joyce justified his proposal by saying:</p>
<dl>
<dd>There's minerals there, there's gold, there's iron ore, there's coal, there's huge fish resources and what you have to ask is: 'Do I turn my head and allow another country to exploit my resource ... or do I position myself in such a way as I'm going to exploit it myself before they get there'."</dd>
</dl>
<p>The Federal Government has warned Joyce that Australia could lose one or two major oil companies should he succeed in plans to block the <a href="../../../d/e/r/Deregulation.html" title="Deregulation">deregulation</a> of the <a href="../../../o/i/l/Oil_industry.html" title="Oil industry">oil industry</a>.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>On <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_9.html" title="October 9">9 October</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>, Joyce appeared on the ABC television comedy show <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Glass_House_%28TV_series%29_6206.html" title="The Glass House (TV series)">The Glass House</a></i>.</p>
