<dd>please discuss something before you revert that far back - FYI, you also erased the dispute tags and interwikis</dd>
<dd>To erase was not my intent, I have a copy with tags and warnings, and I wanted to upload it tonight, along with a faximile of the page 103 that somebody said is a false quote.

What I would do is add back information individually (not all in one big revert) that you don't think is controversial each in separate edits. The stuff that people may dispute should be brought up in a comment on a talk page. You should discuss on the talk page a way to phrase it so the Iranian editors don't disagree with you.

<dd>Sorry to be giving you all these troubles, I observe that you are quite involved becides this subject that teaches me how the Wikipedia works. I made a number of pleas with "Iranian editors" (ethnic Iranians or pilitical Iranians? I had no clue that Wikipedia can be ethnic), but no constructive response so far. They just want to remove the subject from public view.</dd>

<dd>No worries. I believe that they're ethnic Iranians, although "Iranian" isn't a single ethnicity. As you know it's a <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iranian_peoples.html" title="Iranian peoples">group of peoples</a> or a <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iran.html" title="Iran">nationality</a>. Have you talked to <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAli_doostzadeh_552c.html" title="User:Ali doostzadeh">Ali</a> about the issue? I've found him to be quite reasonable. He's the one that said <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Scytho-Iranian_theory_ed86.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Scytho-Iranian theory">here</a> that he would support renaming the article. Just leave a message on his talk page and see what happens (let me know if it works out). —<span style="font-family:Palatino Linotype"><a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhoikhoi_b62f.html" title="User:Khoikhoi"><font color="">Khoikhoi</font></a></span> 01:20, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>But before adding topics they need to first be discussed. I learned that the hard way a couple weeks ago. I added information into an article before a consensus was made, got into a revert war, and eventually got blocked for 24h. I know how Wiki works from experience, and the way your doing it is not the right way.

<dd>Let us not get into rv war, stop using proxies, leave contents on, put a disputed tag, and we will discuss. I already spelled out the refute to the objections, accomodated the claim that Acathyrsi are not Scythians, explained the references. I will do it again, if needed,</dd>

<dd>Khosrow is totally correct. If you have reliable information you must bring all the sources.. You can't just claim Herodotus said this without bringing the actual quotes. Also I do not disagree with russian material, but still they need to be verified by Western Sources that are readily available. The reason is that we can't bring unverified sources like your previous article. And your reporting will not do anything really, since you had your other entery closed and have put up a good amount of non-factual information. From now on you need to bring actual quotes from the actual ancient sources in English else I believe I have the right to disagree due to your previous non-factual and wrong quotes. That is evidence must be presented before insertions are made. For example Herodotus differentiates between Agatharisi and Scythians (look at the quote I brought). So they were not Scythians. Greek myths about origins are not factual information to lead to interpolations into Safavid era. Also etymology is not an easy science and similar sounding words (although Aghajari does not sound even like Agatharisi) does not necessarily correspond to cognates. If you want to provce cognate, then you must do so using materials from top linguistics in the area and not popular folk etymology. --<a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAli_doostzadeh_552c.html" title="User:Ali doostzadeh">Ali doostzadeh</a> 17:27, 21 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>OK, this is better than vanton blanket deletions. Among the objections the main was that Herodotus differentiates between "Agatharisi" (i.e Agathyrsi, I presume) and Scythians. Your contention is that while Scythians are Scythians, and therefore Iranians, the Agathyrsi are not Scythians, and therefore can be Chinese or any other viable alternative. And that Greek's folk tale about Agathyrsi and Scythian brotherly kinship is irrelevant because Agathyrsi have commonality with Thracians. Did I expressed your objection right?</dd>
<dd>Does it also apply to Gelons, because Agathyrsi and Gelons taxonomically are on the same level in respect to Scythians, and Gelons also have some differences with Scythians? Does it apply to Amaxobies, Melanchlens etc, who even are not listed as Scythian brothers? Who else is excluded from the Scythian classification?</dd>

<p>Barefact, the material they keep deleting consists of historiographic cites to Herodotus, Ptolemy, Ammianus, Servius &amp; Priscus for primary sources, and consists only of their information about the Agathyrsi Scythians. It seems they are suppressing this valid, cited addition pretending it is OR when in reality they have political motives (They use their numbers to keep information from view, because that is what their message board does...

<p>Can I create my own sketch from a copyrighted material? For example, a scientific publication has a table and a graph, and I want to cite a part of a table or a section of a graph. The citation is not a mechanical reproduction, but a new tabulation or graph image that reflect the contents of the copyrighted article pertinent to the issue. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarefact_1f8e.html" title="User:Barefact">Barefact</a> 14:51, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>As I understand it (<a href="../../../i/a/n/IANAL_268a.html" title="IANAL">IANAL</a>) there should be no problem with creating an entirely new table or graph representing information from a copyrighted document, as information itself is not subject to copyright (cf. <a href="../../../c/o/p/Wikipedia%7ECopyrights_92c4.html" title="Wikipedia:Copyrights">Wikipedia:Copyrights</a>). However, the creative expression of information is subject to copyright, so you would need to be careful not to infringe this; for example, the choice and order of columns and rows in a table, the range and axes of a graph, any line of best fit, etc., could all be subject to copyright if they were judged not to simply be choices which would be obvious to anyone working in the field. <a href="../../../t/s/p/User%7ETSP_05ce.html" title="User:TSP">TSP</a> 15:32, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>(edit conflict) Ordinarily, no. Copying copyrighted material, even if done by hand rather than mechanically, will usually infringe on the owner's copyright. However, in most cases, scientific data resides in the class of "factual material that has been discovered" rather than creative works or matters of opinion. Generally in the US, factual content cannot be copyrighted, though the selection, arrangement, or style of presentation might be (e.g. <a href="../../../f/e/i/Feist_v._Rural_4040.html" title="Feist v. Rural">Feist v. Rural</a>). Since your intention is to take part of the data (presumably copyright exempt) and create a new image from it, you probably have nothing to worry about. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> 15:41, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>About an image from a scientific paper, I first consulted with WP, and received the following encouraging answer: "in most cases, scientific data resides in the class of "factual material that has been discovered" rather than creative works or matters of opinion. Generally in the US, factual content cannot be copyrighted, though the selection, arrangement, or style of presentation might be (e.g. Feist v. Rural). Since your intention is to take part of the data (presumably copyright exempt) and create a new image from it, you probably have nothing to worry about. Dragons flight 15:41, 29 August 2006 (UTC)". I followed these guidelines, especially fortunate because ordinates are part of the factual content, and the original abbreviations were too criptic for WP illustration. I feel comfortable that the sketch is an image truthfully reflecting relative position of the studied groups, with a highlight to mirror the subject of Ossetian genetics. From the WP consultation, I can claim a "fair use". BTW, Nasidze is a secondary article, consolidating a lot of primary research material.</dd>

<dd>I have already removed the notice since it doesn't make sense to place that notice up there. Those articles definitely don't match the speedy deletion criteria.

<dd>With the Iranian racism flaring in the WP, I thought it was a good idea to have an article that addresses the Turko-Persian historical relations in a positive perspective expressed by respectable academician from entirely neutral position. It gives the background, historical perspective, and a number of aspects of the phenomenon. It gives the decent members of the Persian community a chance to enrich the article by showing the deep roots of the Turko-Persian history. With the guise for deletion like "correct name for that culture is the Persianate culture not the "Turko-Persian", and "Turko-Persian Tradition" – This is misinformation", Surena not only dismisses the respected neutral academical views, she dismisses her own mottos "Truth for the sake of truth" - Ancient Persian Proverb, and "The best mode of instruction is to practise what we preach - Persian Proverb. Turko-Persian cultural symbiosis is directly and indirectly described in thousands of books and studies, no racist propaganda can erase or delete it. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarefact_1f8e.html" title="User:Barefact">Barefact</a> 02:49, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>OK, I found it. the way to give such information (a "diff", meaning "difference") is to give the URL, like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Turko-Persian_tradition&amp;diff=105090920&amp;oldid=105067503" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Turko-Persian_tradition&amp;diff=105090920&amp;oldid=105067503" rel="nofollow">this</a> — then the other person can find it easily.</dd>
<dd>If you look, you'll see that I reverted to a version that had been corrected (for example, it had changed the non-existent word "Islamicate" to "Islamic", had corrected the link from [[Persianate]] to [[Persianate society|Persionate]], improved the lead sentence so that the article title was together and bolded, according to the MoS, changed the non-standard "8th c." to the MoSed "8th century", and so on. I also made the English consistent (some had been American English and some British English). Is that what you wanted to know? --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font></a>) 21:57, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thank you for your addition of material there. However, I found the wording (your translation?) confusing, and have removed most of it to the talk page. I hope we can work together to strengthen and clarify it so it can be re-added to the article.

<dd>I am leaving <a href="../../../l/e/v/Levirate_marriage.html" title="Levirate marriage">levirate marriage</a> as it is. However, in researching something else, I came across the Wikipedia policy on translations, under "language" in <a href="../../../a/_/_/WP%7EA_5364.html" title="WP:A">WP:A</a> (for attribution). It recommends that the original be provided in a footnote, and I can see the sense in this.

<dd>Thanks for your comments but please can we keep this in one place please?! I drew it to your attention because I'd never heard of the policy. I agree that it is observed more in the theory than the reality, i.e. hardly at all. I drew the conclusion that very few people had heard of the policy, and perhaps you were among them. I like your suggestion of a "side pouch". (It could help with contentious images as well, for example; if I want to read about, e.g. torture, but don't want to risk a gory image slapping me in the eyeballs.) Why not suggest that in an appropriate forum? I wouldn't know where to start. As for levirate marriage, as I said, I'm leaving it as it is. If you want to make the additions of the Russian original in footnotes, that would be great, but it is a lot of typing, very tedious. I'm not asking you to. It would be a welcome move towards the Platonic ideal of an encyclopedia.

I will reiterate that regardless of the situation, a certain professional tone must be maintained. "This information is not factual because of X" is ok; "You are a liar because of Y" is not. Comments must be directed at content, not the people who create it. If you truly believe that an editor is simply working to the detriment of the Wiki, then there are proper channels to deal with this through; simply continuing to lob accusations directly at the editor and to others on talk pages serve no purpose. --<a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInShaneee_1a4d.html" title="User:InShaneee">InShaneee</a> 21:01, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Will you please clarify if UNESCO scientific publications and their components are copyrighted?

<dd>With the picture of the Chinese characters, you have several options here. (It looks like you accidentally put {{<a href="../../../p/d/-/Template%7EPD-self_86e2.html" title="Template:PD-self">PD-self</a>}} on the existing one, as it's not your image, you'll want to remove that.) However, that brings us to our easiest option. Since the picture is just a table of Chinese characters, you could simply make your own table in a different format! Remember, <i>information</i> is not copyrightable, only its specific layout and presentation sometimes is. (Even that sometimes is not, for example, if the layout would be the only logical one possible and that would be obvious to anyone in the field, but that doesn't seem the case here.) In that case, the newly-created image is yours to do as you like with. You could also contact UNESCO and ask if they'd be willing to license that image under GFDL, and that will quite often work, especially since that's not too much of a departure from their existing license as it is (aside from allowing commercial use). Copyright law's a tricky thing sometimes, but hope that's helpful! <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESeraphimblade_3956.html" title="User:Seraphimblade">Seraphimblade</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../s/e/r/User_talk%7ESeraphimblade_c110.html" title="User talk:Seraphimblade">Talk to me</a> <a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_Seraphimblade_2_de03.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/Seraphimblade 2">Please review me!</a></sup></small> 20:55, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I had a look, but quite honestly, I'm not sure how that shakes out! (Copyright law is a pretty nasty mess sometimes). If you do communicate with the author, though, perhaps you could get his permission to release that particular sketch under the GFDL (or straight public domain)? That would be the easiest way of solving the matter. (Just "permission to use on the web" or "permission to use on Wikipedia" or "noncommercial use only" is still considered a non-free license here, for a free license it must also be free to use for those who wish to reuse it in the future.) If you can't do that, I might ask at <a href="../../../f/u/_/WT%7EFU_a713.html" title="WT:FU">WT:FU</a>, a lot of the people who frequent that page deal with tricky copyright stuff frequently, and probably could give you a better answer then I could. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESeraphimblade_3956.html" title="User:Seraphimblade">Seraphimblade</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../s/e/r/User_talk%7ESeraphimblade_c110.html" title="User talk:Seraphimblade">Talk to me</a> <a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_Seraphimblade_2_de03.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/Seraphimblade 2">Please review me!</a></sup></small> 00:53, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Granted that, what copyright tag I should use in posting my sketch in the WP? <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarefact_1f8e.html" title="User:Barefact">Barefact</a> 17:16, 18 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Would you please advise me what copyright tag I should use in posting my sketch in the WP? Can you advise me? Barefact 14:49, 22 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Well, that's a strange case. First, make sure the book's author hold the copyrights of these illustrations. If I understood correctly, these illustrations are derivative works of "<i>of pictures given to him</i>". Who owns the copyrights of these pictures?</dd>
<dd>After making sure this author owns these illustration's copyrights, you must (according to <a href="../../../c/o/p/WP%7ECOPYREQ_7bbc.html#When_permission_is_confirmed" title="WP:COPYREQ">WP:COPYREQ#When permission is confirmed</a>) ask him to send an e-mail to "<i><b>permissions-en AT wikimedia DOT org</b></i>" identifying the pictures and explaining he agrees to release it under a free license (like <a href="../../../g/f/d/WP%7EGFDL_b1b2.html" title="WP:GFDL">gfdl</a>, <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.5/" class="external text" title="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.5/" rel="nofollow">cc-by</a> or <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.5/" class="external text" title="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.5/" rel="nofollow">cc-by-sa</a>) or to the public domain. Then ask some editor with access to the otrs system (like <a href="../../../j/k/e/User%7EJkelly_f091.html" title="User:Jkelly">User:Jkelly</a>) to look for this email in the system and give you the "<i>otrs number</i>" for this email. After that, upload the images and tag them with either {{<a href="../../../g/f/d/Template%7EGfdl_246d.html" title="Template:Gfdl">gfdl</a>}}, {{<a href="../../../c/c/-/Template%7ECc-by-2.5_411a.html" title="Template:Cc-by-2.5">cc-by-2.5</a>}} {{<a href="../../../c/c/-/Template%7ECc-by-sa-2.5_49da.html" title="Template:Cc-by-sa-2.5">cc-by-sa-2.5</a>}} or {{<a href="../../../p/d/-/Template%7EPD-release_c976.html" title="Template:PD-release">PD-release</a>}}, according to which license the author choose to release his image. Also, use the {{<a href="../../../p/e/r/Template%7EPermissionOTRSOnly_155c.html" title="Template:PermissionOTRSOnly">PermissionOTRSOnly</a>}} tag with the otrs number <a href="../../../j/k/e/User%7EJkelly_f091.html" title="User:Jkelly">User:Jkelly</a> gave you.</dd>
<dd>Let me know if you need any help. Also, you may want to read <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequesting_copyright_permission_5781.html" title="Wikipedia:Requesting copyright permission">Wikipedia:Requesting copyright permission</a> for more information on the process.
