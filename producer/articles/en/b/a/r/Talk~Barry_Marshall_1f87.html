<dd>The truth is that it probably resolved spontaneously. I will edit the Wiki but I don't want to make a big entry as the whole issue is rather complicated.

<p>Hi. Read all about it here. <a href="http://barryjmarshall.blogspot.com/" class="external autonumber" title="http://barryjmarshall.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarjammar_3a1a.html" title="User:Barjammar">Barjammar</a> 16:12, 21 January 2007 (UTC) Barry Marshall (yes - its really me!)</p>

<p>Recently, Marhsall has been criticised for appearing in an infomercial touting the book "World's Greatest Treasury of Health Secrets" sold by Bottom Line Press, which is not a medical publisher.</p>

<p>Seems the only citation of this is a blog, which I don't think is good citation. I'm going to remove it --<a href="../../../g/l/o/User%7EGlockmeister_8930.html" title="User:Glockmeister">Glockmeister</a> 14:03, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I saw this and have had people email me that they saw it too. I've been going nuts looking for a citation. It could have been someone pretending to be him (never know with these infomercials). Strangely, sockpuppets have been removing the citation, so something weird is going on. I looked at your history and I know you're not a sockpuppet, so I'll leave it deleted for now while I look for a citation. <a href="../../../m/j/k/User%7EMjk2357_a5c7.html" title="User:Mjk2357">Mjk2357</a> 16:46, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Another update - I don't want to sound like a nut but this is weird to me. A guy just posted on my blog re: this article and said I was "spamming" Wikipedia. One glance at my history shows I'm no spammer - but who cares because there are a lot of self-appointed "authorities" here that don't know what they're talking about, right? The weird thing was he chose "no reply" to his post so I couldn't respond to what he wrote. And his post was in perfect English but the blog it pointed to was in Chinese and all this guy's other comments were in Chinese. So I deleted it.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Still looking for confirmation or a source this guy was on this infomercial. Someone help - YouTube turned up empty. <a href="../../../m/j/k/User%7EMjk2357_a5c7.html" title="User:Mjk2357">Mjk2357</a> 01:37, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I tried - I couldn't find anything. May you have better luck. I don't care about this enough to sit up all night watching infomercials! <a href="../../../m/j/k/User%7EMjk2357_a5c7.html" title="User:Mjk2357">Mjk2357</a> 02:06, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There might be two Barjammars, because I'm pretty sure the Barjammar that's the moderator of helico.com is the real Barry Marshall. Anyway, this has passed my strangeness threshold.

<dd>It is true. I saw the infomercial again and recorded it. I've reposted the info with caveats, airtimes, producer's info and other references. If anyone knows how to get a video clip off a DVR and onto the Internet let me know and I'll post the raw data. <a href="../../../m/j/k/User%7EMjk2357_a5c7.html" title="User:Mjk2357">Mjk2357</a> 09:34, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It certainly seems to be Barry Marshall. Go to <a href="https://tvz.healthsecrets.com/" class="external free" title="https://tvz.healthsecrets.com/" rel="nofollow">https://tvz.healthsecrets.com/</a> and skip to 2:06 of the video clip on the main page. The person in the video has an Australian accent and looks like the person in the pictures on Barry Marshall's personal website. <a href="http://www.vianet.net.au/~bjmrshll/" class="external free" title="http://www.vianet.net.au/~bjmrshll/" rel="nofollow">http://www.vianet.net.au/~bjmrshll/</a> 70.69.54.1 11:05, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I tried contacting Barry Marshall and his Laboratory through their web sites to verify this. No luck. Barry Marshall doesn't publish his e-mail address and the only e-mail address on his "helico.com Foundation" (always suspicious am I of ".com foundations") bounces as "no such mail address". Maybe try their WHOIS record which they're required by regulation to keep up to date? [[User:Anon] Fri Jan 19 10:38:17 (UTC)</p>
<p>Any luck with WHOIS? I asked around. We may have an answer in a few days Toru-chan 00:26, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>It seems to me that the infomercial comments on this article are driven by mjk2357 original research and not any actual biographical sources. The history shows that mjk2357 added to the article the statement "Recently, Marshall has been criticised for appearing in an <a href="../../../i/n/f/Infomercial.html" title="Infomercial">infomercial</a> touting the book..." which was sourced only from mjk2357's blog site. BLPs require neutral point of view (NPOV) and no original research. I personally posted a comment on mjk2357's blog site about the wikipedia rules for biographies <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Biographies_of_living_persons" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Biographies_of_living_persons" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Biographies_of_living_persons</a> in October which mjk2357 promptly deleted (see above). More than three removals/edits by various editors have all been reverted by mjk2357. TLB 10:23, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>See above - Dr. Marshall has confirmed the information in this section - also see his own blog. When the guy himself admits it, and there's taped evidence, it's not orig. research! <a href="../../../m/j/k/User%7EMjk2357_a5c7.html" title="User:Mjk2357">Mjk2357</a> 12:09, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>No comment from mjk2357 on NPOV and I don’t think he understands original research (yes, the content is verifiable but that is only 1 of 3 criteria for biographies). I am going to undo this is clearly disputed material. Additionally there is an exception for 3RR 24hour rule for living biographies.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>This appears to be original research to me. Definition is here <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_research" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_research" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_research</a>. None of the section footnotes even mentions Marshall. My main issue is that the primary source is the authors blog and the subjects response (Dr. Marshall) was directly instigated by this wikipedia article section, not to any other source. This seems fundamentally at odds with what wikipedia is meant to do; not to create new content but to summarize and encapsulate a subject. This would be especially true for biographies of living persons. This section should be dropped until properly sourced as this section is completely self-referential.</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>"Recently Dr. Marshall appeared in an infomercial by Bottom Line Health, promoting The World's Greatest Treasury of Health Secrets, which is not a peer-reviewed book."</i>
<dl>
<dd>- "Recently" is ambiguous.</dd>
<dd>- The Bottom Line Health page does not exist, not sure if it ever did.</dd>
<dd>- There is no evidence that Bottom Line Health suggested this was a "peer-reviewed" book. The book is not an academic or scholarly release and is instead targeted at a general audience. Please see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_reviewed#Reasons_for_peer_review" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_reviewed#Reasons_for_peer_review" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_reviewed#Reasons_for_peer_review</a></dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>"Bottom Line Health claims in the infomercial that no doctor was paid for the inclusion of their research in the book, however the publisher does not specify that Dr. Marshall was not compensated for his appearance in the video program promoting it."</i>
<dl>
<dd>- No reference for this information. This statement is conjecture and there is not any relevance provided.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>"Bottom Line Health is not a medical publisher and it has published other material on 'natural and alternative cures' making claims that have not been validated by the FDA."</i>
<dl>
<dd>- This is not sourced, the footnotes are customer complaints.</dd>
<dd>- Again, what information describes this book as anything other than general audience? Publishers publish many types of content, is there a reason why the publishers should be exclusively medical publishers?</dd>
<dd>- Is there any information that the book claims its remedies have been approved by the FDA? By definition would not "natural and alternative" medicine be unapproved by the FDA? As a note, the FDA has in fact approved treatment for ulcers described in the book by Marshall. TLB 08:17, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi; I checked with the manager of my office and apparently there was no payment. Someone may put evidence on my blog page. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarjammar_3a1a.html" title="User:Barjammar">Barjammar</a> 21:04, 24 January 2007 (UTC)Barry Marshall.</p>
<p>I refer you once again to Dr. Marshall's own blog where he says he was paid for his appearance. However this was donated to charity. If you research this book you will find it is pure quackery. It's a serious issue that a Nobel Prize winner was seen endorsing it! Dr. Marshall himself has admitted that it was a mistake for him to appear in the book. Anyone who looks up Dr. Marshall's page after seeing this informercial deserves to see this information and know that Dr. Marshall no longer endorses this book. As for the claims not being validated by the FDA, this is stated on Bottom Line's website, which is sourced. You are justified in editing this section but not in removing it entirely. I find it suspicious also that someone whose only contributions to Wikipedia are on this page (plus one other minor edit) is such a hawk about the rules. Perhaps this is a separate account you have for doing controversial things such as this? <a href="../../../m/j/k/User%7EMjk2357_a5c7.html" title="User:Mjk2357">Mjk2357</a> 12:13, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>What are you saying? That you would accept inclusion of the section if it was rewritten? If so feel free to do so. However blanking sourced material repeatedly is in violation of policy. However, I have added a dispute tag and I am waiting for input from other users before restoring anything - at least for the time being. <a href="../../../m/j/k/User%7EMjk2357_a5c7.html" title="User:Mjk2357">Mjk2357</a> 12:56, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

</dl>
<p>One more thing: I checked the policy for living biographies and by repeatedly blanking a sourced section it's you that's in violation of the policy, not me. <a href="../../../m/j/k/User%7EMjk2357_a5c7.html" title="User:Mjk2357">Mjk2357</a> 12:16, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>These were reverts of your work which have been going on since October, not blanking. WP:BLP demands WP:NPOV and WP:NOR otherwise it is meant to be removed immediately. TLB 07:01, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>As I explained above it's not a violation of NPOV or NOR if the subject of the article confirms the accuracy of the section! What part about that don't you understand? I'm willing to let this issue be debated and not get into a time-wasting revert war with you but by removing the tag you're hiding even the mention of a debate.</dd>

<dd>Well my perspective is your own nationalism is keeping you from being objective here. As for a moral agenda, everyone has one, including Wikipedia. Wikipedia's is supposed to be free and accurate information. The info I added was accurate. Unfortunately you and another Australian have succeeded (so far) in suppressing it. As for when I was warned about no personal attacks, that user was nobly trying to cool a debate with the LaRouche people, who, if you've been here as long as I have, you would know almost ruined Wikipedia. I don't have any apologies to make about standing up to them. <a href="../../../m/j/k/User%7EMjk2357_a5c7.html" title="User:Mjk2357">Mjk2357</a> 10:15, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Wouldn't a subject's response to a wikipedia article be biased? I have outlined my problems with your treatment of the subject in the "Is this true?" section as not neutral; I don't think that Dr. Marshall's response is any more neutral. The sections commentary, relevance and moral judgements are your original work. I agree with Toru-chan that there should be links to both websites and people wanting more information can read the commentary for themselves.</dd>

<dd>I only posted my blog entry to get other people to confirm what I thought I saw while groggily watching TV at 4:40 AM! If you want to delete the blog link, fine. But suppressing this information is not fine. Users should be alerted as to an ongoing debate and be allowed to contribute to it. I agree Dr. Marshall's response is not NPOV since it's from the subject, but since it confirms embarrassing information, rather than denying it, that doesn't really matter, does it? If President Bush tomorrow admitted the whole Iraq War was based on lies, does that make it POV and not suitable for wikipedia? Ridiculous. <a href="../../../m/j/k/User%7EMjk2357_a5c7.html" title="User:Mjk2357">Mjk2357</a> 16:25, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>So you admit to posting unverified negative comments on a wikipedia biography in order to draw readers to your blog and support your agenda? Are you from Current Affair? Biographies and wikipedia articles should be a summary of collected information/commentary on a subject. So far your blog is the only other source which mentions Dr. Marshall. I do not want to delete your blog as an external link, I just don't feel the section you defended for months was neutral or a summary of biographical information on the subject.

That argument doesn't hold up, and you obviously don't apply it to yourself otherwise you as an Australian with an obvious emotional interest in this issue would excuse yourself from getting involved. But you didn't - in fact you even changed a title heading on the talk page to disguise the fact that there is a "national pride" factor involved with this debate - you're hiding your own POV. <a href="../../../m/j/k/User%7EMjk2357_a5c7.html" title="User:Mjk2357">Mjk2357</a> 10:15, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In response to, "If you research this book you will find it is pure quackery". First let me say I in no way am attempting to defend the infomercial or book but didn't Dr. Marshall review one of the sections? Is this section quackery? The comments on your blog are from "anonymous" users and don't reference the content at all. Another infomercial comment site seems to only be about Hugh Downs and not the content. I found another website with customer comments about how the content was "obvious", and many said that you would be better off searching google to find these "remedies". What if you don't have access to the internet? Does your term "quackery" mean the book contains false information or just obvious, vague or basic medical information as specified in the internet comments? TLB 13:13, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>One example (there are plenty more): The book advises treating heartburn by drinking vinegar. This is against all medical advice and could be very dangerous. The tone of the infomercial is such that "most doctors are misleading you" and you should use "alternative cures." I suggest you watch the infomercial yourself - a user has supplied a link on this page I believe. <a href="../../../m/j/k/User%7EMjk2357_a5c7.html" title="User:Mjk2357">Mjk2357</a> 16:25, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

I helped to expose a big sockpuppeteer named Zdrv a while back - maybe now I think everyone is one because of that. However, once again, you are mistaken when it comes to the rules. You can't claim NPOV and NOR violations when Dr. Marshall himself has admitted this event happened. The fact that he doesn't want the material included is immaterial - no subject would want embarrassing material included - but that doesn't mean Wiki biographies should be 100% positive. <a href="../../../m/j/k/User%7EMjk2357_a5c7.html" title="User:Mjk2357">Mjk2357</a> 16:25, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, I appreciate that my Wikipedia page is getting back to normal with the "book" episode being represented by a link. I don't have time to study the rules but whoever did that for me, many thanks. I hope it sticks. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarjammar_3a1a.html" title="User:Barjammar">Barjammar</a> 13:00, 23 January 2007 (UTC) Barry Marshall</p>
<p>I think we do need to make some reference to it, but also don't think we need blow it out of proportion. Barjammar was basically suckered into giving an endorsement for a book that he believed, based on the article he checked for them, was bone fide. Could happen to any of us, and he's come clean. That aught to be good enough. We've *all* made the odd mistake in our past. Acknowledge it, but it needn't take up half our of Wiki. BTW Contrary to what Barjammar thinks, this is not an exclusively Wiki/mjk thing. It was discussed on quite a few web sites. People tend to come to Wiki when they're looking for an answer. For that reason, we still need to have a reference for anyone looking for it. But lets keep it in proportion. Toru-chan 01:08, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Toru-chan please restore the infomercial section to the degree you feel appropriate, as I do not feel like wasting time in a revert/policy debate war with Trizow. Thanks! <a href="../../../m/j/k/User%7EMjk2357_a5c7.html" title="User:Mjk2357">Mjk2357</a> 01:20, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Mjk, yeah, it's a grey area. Probably it is worth a subheading in the wiki article itself, but so long as your blog and Barjammar's admission are live external links it is still on the record and we can leave it like that. Basically we'll give Barjammar the benefit of the doubt on this occasion. If Barjammar goes in another Informercial we can reconsider, but somehow I don't see it!&#160;:-) Toru-chan 03:54, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
