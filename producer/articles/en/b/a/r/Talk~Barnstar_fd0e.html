<p>Someone else mentioned having pictures of barnstars and similar taken in New Orleans. I live in Charleston, SC, and these (and non-star shaped examples) are very common structural aides in our historic, yet earthquake and hurricane prone city. However, this article only mentions a few cities. I don't think the article needs to mention every place in the world these occur, but I feel there should be some better rationale for what's included and what isn't than just author bias. --<a href="../../../j/h/l/User%7EJhlynes_10eb.html" title="User:Jhlynes">Jhlynes</a> 04:07, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

The function of these shapes is clearly identical to that of barnstars, but I don't know of a name for them. It would probably be useful to include them in the article if anyone has any more detailed info on them.<a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELee_M_8833.html" title="User:Lee M">Lee M</a> 00:32, 13 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>They're tie plates. The rods are called tie rods. They're usually iron, not steel. You find them on all sorts of UK buildings, including barns. They are usually structural, sometimes decorative. Go ahead and add this if you like. Not in an editing mood. 212.139.203.136 19:55, 17 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>These can also be plate-shaped. An old house of mine had a couple which had been used to remove an outward bulge in the brickwork. A tie rod with a thread at each end was run through through the house from outer wall to outer wall, the middle was heated so it expands and the tie-plates were loosely screwed on. The rod contracted as it cools, pulled the walls together and removed the bulges. Apparently. <a href="../../../d/a/e/User%7EDaen_8988.html" title="User:Daen">Daen</a> 14:31, 26 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Wall ties or wall anchors as they are sometimes known, are added to improve the support structure of a building or structure in areas where it is failing, or as a pre-emptive action to strengthen weak points. They can run across the outside of a wall, through a wall, or between walls. The ties used between walls consist of a round bar, spanning between the failing wall and the strongest, most favourable point of the opposite wall, with threads at both ends, onto which a plate (the anchor) is fastened. The plate has the function of distributing load across a wider surface area. Where wall ties are used to stabilise a failing wall, it is sometimes preferable to use the wall tie to pull the wall back so that it is vertical or near vertical. There are various methods of doing this, but the two most common are; gradually tightening the tie plate nut, and heating the center of a short rod, causing it to expand, then fastening the tie plate onto the ends - the bar then contracts as it cools, effectively pulling the bulge out of the wall. The tie plate can come in many shapes and sizes, including circular, square, cross, and star shaped.</p>
<p>I suggest this article be merged into an article on wall ties containing the above information, or at least something resembling the above information. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadharlick_3ea7.html" title="User:Badharlick"><font color="#FF0000">▫Bad▫</font><font color="#000000">harlick♠</font></a> 23:19, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>They still can be seen on many buildings there. I lived in Richmond, Virginia for six years and constantly saw them.</p>
<p>The explanation preceding this is accurate. I am sincerely impressed with Wilipedia!</p>
<p>In Charlottesville, Virginia where I was born and raised -- until Vietnam -- you can find these stars in the ruins of the old Confederate Clothing Factory.</p>

<p>This looks like vandalism.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Barnstars are seen not only on barns, but on many older buildings, often of brick. A long steel rod is passed entirely through the building; a star on either side is threaded onto the ends of the rod and they are tightened. This helps to keep the structure from collapsing. A heavily starred building should be examined for failure of the mortar, and may require tuckpointing or more drastic repairs.</dd>

<p>I removed the section. The added ext link only confirms the suspicion in hoax. Plates are threaded on coupling rods. A star would be a poor stress-distributor. `'<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> 02:23, 29 December 2006 (UTC).</p>
<dl>
<dd>My understanding of barnstars, especially on masonry buildings, is that they anchor the threaded rods which hold walls true (vertical) to each other, or to tie a wall into framing or other structural members to hold it true. An abundance of barnstars in a masonry structure is taken to indicate potential brickwork or foundation problems.

<p>Isn't that overdoing it a bit? I mean, we don't really want to draw attention to this, just reference it somewhere. Personally, I support the current use of an external link: as far as "an encyclopedia" is concerned (which is what this article is part of, in the context of mirrors, offline editions, and even just anonymous readers) this is just a link to "a page on the web with relevant information". OK, so it feels a bit weird for us to refer to it as "external", but in a sense the project namespace <i>should</i> be external to the article one. IMHO, of course. - <a href="../../../i/m/s/User%7EIMSoP_6779.html" title="User:IMSoP">IMSoP</a> 20:08, 25 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<li>Not trying to be contrary here, but how are all the <i>See also</i> sections, which are links to wiki namespace different? Also, it isn't really an external link, even if we make it use that syntax, so why not make it that syntactically in the see also section? <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikibofh_f636.html" title="User:Wikibofh">Wikibofh</a> 21:53, 3 November 2005 (UTC)

The only item in <i>See also</i> is <a href="../../../t/a/l/Talkoot.html" title="Talkoot">Talkoot</a>, which is a wikilink to a page in article-space. From a technical standpoint, the link to the Wikipedia:-space page on barnstars could be either <a href="../../../b/a/r/Wikipedia%7EBarnstars_on_Wikipedia_c8fc.html" title="Wikipedia:Barnstars on Wikipedia">internal</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Barnstars_on_Wikipedia" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Barnstars_on_Wikipedia" rel="nofollow">external</a>, but that's only for <i>this</i> particular instance of Wikipedia. If a mirror decides to pull only article-space and related content (categories, etc.) and <i>not</i> the Wikipedia:-space pages, an internal link to <a href="../../../b/a/r/Wikipedia%7EBarnstars_on_Wikipedia_c8fc.html" title="Wikipedia:Barnstars on Wikipedia">Wikipedia:Barnstars on Wikipedia</a> would be a dead link, whereas an external link would be functional.

<li><b>Yes</b> A straw poll at a userpage for someone against the question seems to be a tad biased to me. Personally, I see nothing wrong with informing the reader of more information on the topic. In "fact," it's biased to withhold the information. The only legitimate question, IMHO, is how to present it. <a href="../../../r/f/r/User%7ERfrisbie_fdd2.html" title="User:Rfrisbie">Rfrisbie</a><sup><a href="../../../r/f/r/User_talk%7ERfrisbie_975e.html" title="User talk:Rfrisbie">talk</a></sup> 13:31, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Yes</b> - When I first got here, I hit barnstar from the Random Article. I saw the Wikipedia Barnstars link and clicked that, and read up on Barnstars, and I thought that they were the neatest thing, and that's what got me editing here.

<li><b>Yes</b> definately. Many people who read wikipedia are active editors themselves (or possibly future editors). The help pages are a mess and I never find what I am looking for.

<p>Query: What do wikipedians have against newcomers learning more about wikipedia? Self References are one of the best ways to find out more information about an aspect of wikipedia, especialy since searching the other namespaces can be difficult and confusing for someone who has never done it before. Unless the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">wikipedia</a> article can encompass every self reference from <i>every</i> other article, we need them to be spread out in places where people would expect to find them. Ill never understand, especialy in the case of <a href="../../../e/s/p/WP%7EESP_03e8.html" title="WP:ESP">Esperanza</a>, why some wikipedians want to keep a solid wikipedia <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/The_Wikipedia_Community" class="external text" title="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/The_Wikipedia_Community" rel="nofollow">Community</a> from growing. The reader who comes across wikipedia barnstars may then be interested in contributing to wikipedia, going from reader to editor. --<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarterhawk_811c.html" title="User:Carterhawk">Carterhawk</a> 21:52, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

I respond with a counter-query: did you learn about barnstars by reading the <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barnstar.html" title="Barnstar">barnstar</a> article, or by some other means, such as visiting user pages? A followup query: why do you assume that some people's preference to keep Wikipedian cultural references out of articles that don't directly relate to us is a calculated attempt to keep newcomers in the dark? – <a href="../../../c/l/o/User%7EClockworkSoul_d5aa.html" title="User:ClockworkSoul">Clockwork</a><a href="../../../c/l/o/User_talk%7EClockworkSoul_028f.html" title="User talk:ClockworkSoul"><b>Soul</b></a> 22:02, 15 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>1)Through a userpage, however in looking for more information on them, i first came here. For me finding out more about wikipedia policies and culture involves a great deal of hoping an article in the Main namespace has a link to an article in the wikipedia namespace. 2) My suspicious nature. --<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarterhawk_811c.html" title="User:Carterhawk">Carterhawk</a> 06:20, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>A thought</b> What about a change to the underlying mediawiki software? What I propose is that the software track any namespaces that are set to cross reference each other. When each namespace has an article with the same name, add a tab button to the top of the article to the right of <i>Watch</i> that takes the reader to the other namespace. It avoids self referencing in the article, and makes related information in other namespaces easily accessible.

<p>It is clear to me that there is a major confusion going on here. There are decorative "plaques" that either feature star motifs (PA dutch) or are actually star-shaped (sheet metal?), and steel/iron forgings that function as anchor points for structural tie rods holding two opposing walls together. The image in this article is clearly the latter, yet the text not only makes no mention of the structural purpose, but specifically excludes it.</p>
<p>I'm going to re-write this in the near future. Anybody have a useable image of one of those decorative stars? <a href="../../../p/j/b/User%7EPjbflynn_2ca5.html" title="User:Pjbflynn">Pjbflynn</a> 23:37, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>You're right. This article seems lacking in those respects. In fact, earlier on this talk page, someone even thought that a discussion of tie rods and plates was "vandalism"! Here in Philadelphia there are loads of 18th- and 19th-century brick buildings that have such stars on them. On many of those buildings it looks as though, far from it being a random repair, the wall was designed to have the stars in certain places as anchors for joists, although I don't know that for sure. Some may be purely decorative, but I believe that many of them probably are joist anchors (and the joist itself may simultaneously serve as a tie rod) and some others may be tie plates for ad-hoc masonry repairs done, say, in 1860 on a building built in 1760.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>&#160;&#160;&#160;So some of the problems in this article currently are that such stars (a) were not just for barns, but rather were also used on brick houses; (b) were not only German or German-American; (c) were not always non-structural, but rather also seem to have been used as joist anchors, combination joist-anchor/tie-plates, or just ad-hoc tie plates. However, this article needs input from a good secondary source such as a book written by someone with real knowledge of the subject (e.g., architects, people who do renovation on colonial-era buildings). — <a href="../../../l/u/m/User%7ELumbercutter_ac32.html" title="User:Lumbercutter">Lumbercutter</a> 22:37, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I used to do renovation work on old buildings and may be able to find a source. To my best knowledge , a star-shaped anchor is for timber construction, while bigger tie plates are used for masonry, but barnstars almost certainly had a structural purpose prior to the decorative/award one.

<dd>Well, I've searched high &amp; low and can't find a reference to barn stars which indicate even a vestigial structural use.

The page has a link to a range of good photos (I've emaled for permission to use) all of which show a wooden star placed high in the eaves of the roof, too high (IMO) to be of any structural purpose, even if they were strong enough for the task.</dd>

<p>OK, so this has the potential to really upset some people (given the whole "barnstar as wikipedia award" thing), but by what verifiable source is this image being labeled as a "barnster"? From all of my research, I can find not a single reference to a reinforcing plate such as this being called a "barnstar". Indeed, they seem to be used predominantly on urban masonry (brick) buildings.</p>
<p>All that I can find searching for "barnstar" is those sheet metal (tin, copper) decorative types. Lacking a source defining a star-shaped tie rod anchor plate as a barnstar, I think the image(s) need to be renamed. <a href="../../../p/j/b/User%7EPjbflynn_2ca5.html" title="User:Pjbflynn">Pjbflynn</a> 01:32, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>A lot of the stuff I've read while searching for a structural connection mentions barn stars being a kind of 'trademark', fixed by the builder by way of signature, expressing pride in his work. It's this connection which is behind the barnstar an award for work well done, I think. The onus is on those of us who believe them to <i>have</i> a structural purpose to find evidence to back the claim up. At the moment, the article makes totally unsupported claims to this end; the decorative/award usage has plenty of corraborative evidence, by contrast. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMIckStephenson_eb9d.html" title="User:MIckStephenson">mikaul</a> 10:48, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Well, the real issue as I see it is that there are two distinctly different objects being labelled as "barnstars", and I can find no source describing a barnstar as a thick metal plate with a hole in the center, can you?

I think it would be useful to restate my concern and see what folks think.</p>
<p>The issue is that the image <s>currently on this page</s> called silverBarnstar.jpg, (and by extension, all the modified versions used as Wikipedia awards) is mis-named as a barn star. I have found plenty of sources (some linked above) that show and define a large, non-structural decorative star of wood or metal as a barn star. The only source for referring to the physically very different object in the picture as a barn star is the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20030401215556/designculture.nu/barn/barnstar.html" class="external text" title="http://web.archive.org/web/20030401215556/designculture.nu/barn/barnstar.html" rel="nofollow">Barnstar Subterfuge</a>, and I believe this is in error.</p>
<p>The object in this image is essentially a large washer, used on the ends of iron rods that pass through opposite walls of a masonry structure. These rods, generally called tie rods, serve to hold the sides of the structure together, either according to original design, or as a repair later in the building's history. These plates are usually called tie plates, and vary in their shape and degree of decoration. Apparently in the UK they are known as <a href="http://www.redgwick.co.uk/index.html" class="external text" title="http://www.redgwick.co.uk/index.html" rel="nofollow">pattress plates</a>. I can find no evidence of these plates being used on any non-masonry structure (usually <a href="http://ths.gardenweb.com/forums/load/oldhouse/msg0513524721840.html?15" class="external text" title="http://ths.gardenweb.com/forums/load/oldhouse/msg0513524721840.html?15" rel="nofollow">urban houses</a> and <a href="http://www.artery.org/MurrayMill.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.artery.org/MurrayMill.htm" rel="nofollow">industrial buildings</a>), and not on barns.</p>
<p>Unless someone can come up with evidence of these tie plates being used on barns, than the image must be renamed. I'm not really sure how to go about that, and the problem is compounded by it's use in so many "award images". <a href="../../../p/j/b/User%7EPjbflynn_2ca5.html" title="User:Pjbflynn">Pjbflynn</a> 04:24, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>It seems to me that there are two clearly seperate subjects here. From my reading in trying to cite this, and the discussion here, I'm thinking that Barnstars are a symbolic ornament. It's expected that some structural tie plates may have been decoratively shaped like stars, but this seems to be at best midly relevant to the topic of discussion. To try and make an analogy, consider hood ornaments, and assume that they were once used to open hoods of vehicles. It may be worth noting that this could be an origin for them, and cross referencing "Hood Latch," but the discussion of hood ornament design solely for aesthetic purposes is of its own merit. The best resolution appears to make an XRef and sentence reference to <a href="../../../t/i/e/Tie_rod.html" title="Tie rod">Tie rod</a>, which will in turn need some discussion of tie plates. <a href="../../../a/u/t/User%7EAutocracy_4fe0.html" title="User:Autocracy">Autocracy</a> 14:27, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I just did a revert to remove this text:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Barnstars (aka earthquake washers) were employed in the early 19th century. Earthquake bolts (accompanied with decorative washers mostly in star form) are often associated with repairs made to buildings following great earthquakes. Iron bolts and decorative washers (stars) often used with them were attached to rods inserted laterally through buildings to straighten walls and provide additional structural support. The star washers were found both internally adjacent to major wood structural beams and as “end cap washers” of the long rods on the building exterior. Many of these are still visible on older multiple story brick buildings in major cities. The ends of floor joists in older brick buildings sit in tiny pockets within the masonry wall. These small pockets are usuall not more than a few inches wide. The walls would not have to move much for the joist to slip out and fall (as would easily happen in an earthquake). To prevent this, a hole was drilled through the brick wall and run an iron rod into a floor (or ceiling) spanning the room or all the way through to the brick wall on the other side. An iron metal star or “washer” was affixed at the ends of the rod with a nut screwed on the end. Because the bricks and mortar weakened over time and are soft in nature, a large washer was used to disperse the stress of keeping the walls plumb over a wider area. Large stars were used as they are far more decorative than round or square washers, especially on older more historical buildings which were to be preserved. These tie-rods and/or "star bolts" devices are occasionally referred to as earthquake or hurricane bolts because such disasters often warrant their use.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Completely agree with the removal of the tie-plate text and your fine additional section should be an end to the matter, I think. No need to "upset" anyone or anything; there no point at all in changing name for the Wiki-award, simply because the word <i>actually</i> refers to something other than the object depicted. This is the way a lot of common names start out, often in ingorance of the "true" meaning or "correct" usage ('scuse my relativism) and the source of many an amusing etymological journey... this is usage outside of the public Wiki and I vote we keep the term in it's present form, display of ignorance, warts and all.

<p>I've had a go at fixing it. The hex-sign is no more a barnstar than the tie plate is, so I've added that into the 'confusion' section. The newer metal stars are proably nearer the lineage of the 'genuine' wooden ones, so (after a bit of messing about) I've left them in 'History'. I think we could probably expand this section, but it needs some verifiable research. I do have another photo, come to think of it.
