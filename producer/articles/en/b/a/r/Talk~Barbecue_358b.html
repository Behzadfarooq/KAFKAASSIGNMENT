<p>In order to be consistent with the definition AlbertCahalan is proposing, most of the article would have to be deleted, as it does not comply. Certainly the regional variations and all the photos would all have to be cut out.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Certainly not. It is you who insists on a POV definition that excludes what very many people consider to be barbeque. I'm only asking that the general and more inclusive definition be used. All the photos can remain; they are fine. In some particular place, the "deep south" I imagine, barbeque may exclude high-temperature cooking. This is not the definition normally used in California or New England.

From your <a href="../../../a/l/b/User_talk%7EAlbertCahalan_a654.html" title="User talk:AlbertCahalan">user talk page</a>, I can see that you have already had disagreements with at least two other users because you chose to impose American English on the <a href="../../../b/a/k/Bakeware.html" title="Bakeware">Bakeware</a> article. Now you seek to impose your own particular usage of American English over the usage of the previous contributors to this article.</p>

<dd>I think you mean on Wikibooks, where someone wanted to use an obscure term as the primary name of an article. Google tells me his name was unpopular by a factor of 38 to 1 against either of the top two alternatives. In spite of this, I was OK with mentioning his oddball term on the page.

<dd>Great. You <i>should</i> accept that there is a wide community of people who use definitions that differ from the ones you use. Please do so. Do not exclude high-temperature cooking, even in the flames. Do not exclude the use of barbeque sauce in a pot on the stove. These are perfectly valid forms of barbeque.

<dd>I should add that the dictionary agrees with me. See <a href="http://m-w.com/" class="external free" title="http://m-w.com/" rel="nofollow">http://m-w.com/</a> for example. (to pick a dictionary you can't just edit) Taking advantage of the <i>fair use</i> concept, I'll even quote it for you. Barbecue is: <b>"1&#160;: to roast or broil on a rack over hot coals or on a revolving spit before or over a source of heat 2&#160;: to cook in a highly seasoned vinegar sauce"</b> It actually looks like <i>your</i> definition is excluded, but I won't be cruel enough to delete that. I just ask that you quit pushing your unusual definition as the only definition. <a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlbertCahalan_d719.html" title="User:AlbertCahalan">AlbertCahalan</a> 16:40, 12 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I must say, I'm quite surprised by all of this. I always thought the traditional meanings of 'barbeque' versus 'grill' were quite clear — that while the former was starting to broaden its definition, its original sense was not in dispute. I don't think anyone's arguing to exclude the newer senses of 'barbeque', but at the same time it seems fair to note its original sense and to state that there are purists who insist on it. -- <a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPerey_ed5e.html" title="User:Perey">Perey</a> 18:20, 12 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, I'm quite surprised in the other direction. I've never met a person who'd make the distinction you make. This is almost certainly a regional issue, with the restrictive barbecue definition being used mostly in the South or Southeast.

<dd>Ironically, I think <i>you're</i> making the mistake of thinking too regionally now. I'm Australian.&#160;;-) Australian usage, for the record, uses 'barbeque' almost universally for the social occasion and the cooking appliance (which is actually of the grilling kind as a rule, rather than the slow cooker). As such, the slow-cook definition of the word is all but lost here, but I was still under the impression it was the original sense. ('Barbeque chicken' on the other hand is a popular takeaway food and is most definitely barbequed in the slow-cook sense.) -- <a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPerey_ed5e.html" title="User:Perey">Perey</a> 02:53, 15 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The true definition of barbecue is the indirect slow-cooking method, not common grilling. It is certainly not flipping burgers over a gas or charcoal grill and most certainly not baking chicken in Kraft "barbeque sauce" on a stove. If you think so, then you must come to the South and get some actual barbecue. Anyway, Wikipedia strives to maintain factual accuracy; therefore, this article should only cover the indirect method. Take everything else to the grilling article. <a href="../../../h/a/v/User%7EHaverton_6497.html" title="User:Haverton">Haverton</a> 20:23, 25 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>If they want to find out about regular grilling, then they can go to the article about grilling. This article is about slow-cooking barbecue.</p>

<dd>If you want the article to be about slow-cooking barbecue only, then move it to slow-cooking barbecue and I'll write a replacement article for barbecue. Otherwise, this article is about barbecue. Your "real barbecue" doesn't exist in most places, and I missed my chance while passing through Tennesee. I have had plenty of mainstream barbecue though. <a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlbertCahalan_d719.html" title="User:AlbertCahalan">AlbertCahalan</a> 20:31, 26 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Or mabye you should move your definition to the <a href="../../../g/r/i/Grilling.html" title="Grilling">grilling</a> article. Perhaps you should have some real barbecue and we'll see if you think barbecuing and grilling are the same. If you live in the Northeast, I know there are a couple of real barbecue places in New York and Boston. However, until you have acutal barbecue, you can't really comment on what's barbecue and what's not. By the way, mainstream barbecue is not canned slop on a bun or baked chicken in Kraft sauce. <a href="../../../h/a/v/User%7EHaverton_6497.html" title="User:Haverton">Haverton</a> 00:23, 27 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hang on a minute here. I think we've completely lost the point in some internecine American barbecue war.&#160;;-) It seems to me that on the one hand we have the "real barbecue is slow-cooking" camp, and on the other we have the "if enough people call it barbecuing, it's barbecuing, even if it's also grilling" camp. Can anyone explain to me why either of these would reject something like the following? <i>Barbecue traditionally refers to a slow-cooking method, and many enthusiasts still insist on this usage. However, the application of the term to other cooking methods, appliances and events is widespread. The most common sense in this less strict usage is the cooking style otherwise called grilling.</i> -- <a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPerey_ed5e.html" title="User:Perey">Perey</a> 17:05, 30 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>The compromise would be fine. Except that the last sentence needs serious reworking. "Common sense" is extremely confusing as used. Something like "Most commonly, "barbecue" is used to describe what purists call "grilling."</li>
</ul>
<p>Hayford Peirce</p>
<p>I'll compromise for that if you add at the bottom of that paragraph "This article is mainly about the slow-cooking method. For more information on general grilling, refer to the <a href="../../../g/r/i/Grilling.html" title="Grilling">Grilling</a> article." Sound good? <a href="../../../h/a/v/User%7EHaverton_6497.html" title="User:Haverton">Haverton</a> 23:54, 30 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Sounds good to me -- good enough to eat, even, whether grilled, barbecued, or smoked....</li>
</ul>
<p>Hayford Peirce (I've forgotten how to add my signature here...)</p>
<p>The first problem with that is the question of "How slow is slow?". There isn't a sharp dividing line. If there were a sharp dividing line, separate articles might be appropriate. The second problem is that "grilling" is a severely overloaded term that <i>does</i> have sharp dividing lines — it needs to be a disambiguation page of some sort. To the British it is the same as broiling, to be done in your electric oven! To many people, it means the use of something like the George Foreman Grill. So that's no good. Let's ditch the elitism; as I grudgingly admit that a hot dog is meat (yuck!) we should all admit that people use "barbecue" even if the cooking isn't painfully slow. <a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlbertCahalan_d719.html" title="User:AlbertCahalan">AlbertCahalan</a> 06:13, 31 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>As you say, "grilling" can mean many things. Not only to the British, but many American cookbooks and recipes also say "grill a steak" or whatever under the broiler unit in either a gas or electric oven -- I could find dozens of examples. It's probably an insoluble problem. Like "inflammatory" and "flammatory" essentially meaing the same thing. And thanks for the tilde tip -- I had completely forgotten how to do it.... <a href="../../../h/a/y/User%7EHayford_Peirce_5729.html" title="User:Hayford Peirce">Hayford Peirce</a> 16:27, 31 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I should mention that the emphasis in my suggestion ought to be on "something <i>like</i> the following". I wasn't really going for polished prose, more a statement of agreement to compromise.&#160;:-) I think adding such a comment is sufficient "admission" of the varied uses of "barbecue"; just because a "sharp dividing line" doesn't exist, doesn't mean they aren't distinct concepts! At the least, there's a wider gap between (slow) barbequing and grilling than grilling and broiling. -- <a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPerey_ed5e.html" title="User:Perey">Perey</a> 15:51, 1 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Most real barbecue is cooked for at least 8-10 hours in a pit either over or next to a very low burning wood flame. Compare that to 10-20 minutes for a burger. I think that's pretty clear cut. Anyway, split the grill article if you must, but keep the grilling and barbecue articles separate. If you want, have the barbecue article on a disambiguation page for grilling. <a href="../../../h/a/v/User%7EHaverton_6497.html" title="User:Haverton">Haverton</a> 01:22, 2 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>One Possible compromise solution: This article has sections devoted to various regions. Why not list in those regions what is meant by the term "barbecue". I'm from NC, and around here, anyone who mentioned Barbecue in relation to cookouts, grilling, beef, mutton or Propane Grills would probably be looked at strange. So a Note under NC Barbecue to specify what the general usage of the word locally could be added, and likewise in other location sections. Heck, for that matter, I should probably go in the the NC section and split up Eastern Vs. Lexington&#160;:) People from different parts of the state here get into arguments about what Barbecue means. Its no surprise people from different states and countries can't find one definition. --<a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahooker_df33.html" title="User:Wahooker">Wahooker</a> 18:42, 24 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>In Re: "...with the more direct high-heat methods to be called <a href="../../../g/r/i/Grilling.html" title="Grilling">grilling</a>...."</b> I'm teaching myself how to become a serious <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charcoal.html" title="Charcoal">charcoal</a> griller. The first lesson I learned is understanding the difference between "direct heat" and "indirect heat" cooking. <b>Both</b> terminologies are used in the context of grilling. From my lessons thus far, the use of "direct heat" is ideal for searing meat and indirect heat for slower cooking. To address the question of "how slow", the answer is provided by a <a href="../../../m/e/a/Meat_thermometer.html" title="Meat thermometer">meat thermometer</a>. My instructions indicate the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Well done: &gt;= 130 deg.F for red meats (beef), &gt;= 170 deg.F for white meats (pork &amp; poultry)</li>
<li>Medium done: =140 to 159.9 deg F (beef), 160 to 169.9 deg F (pork &amp; poultry)</li>
<li>Medium rare: &gt;= 130 deg. F (fish), 130 to 139.9 deg.F (beef)</li>

<p>I live in New England and everyone I know makes a distinction between barbeque and grilled food, though we do refer to a party where there will be grilling as a "barbecue", "cook out" is more often used. <a href="../../../m/a/x/User%7EMaxcap_8e01.html" title="User:Maxcap">maxcap</a> 13:28, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Alber Cahalan is over generalizing the regions where bbq as slow cooking as can be seen in Maxcap's comment above. His references are also inapplicable. I've never seen any recipes in the dictionary. The Joy of Cooking, an credible and definitive source, clearly defines bbq as slow cooking over indirect heat(The All New, All Purpose Joy of Cooking, page 1056). Not too many of his other arguments hold up either... 'how slow is slow?' In the talk section of the Wikicookbook entry on bbq his attitude is pretty clear: 'I wrote this page and this is what I want it to say.' He also seems to the the only one who wants it to say that. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 207.171.167.101 (<a href="../../../2/0/7/User_talk%7E207.171.167.101.html" title="User talk:207.171.167.101">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_207.171.167.101_5b41.html" title="Special:Contributions/207.171.167.101">contribs</a>).</small> <small>(<a href="../../../r/e/m/Wikipedia%7ERemove_personal_attacks_ff02.html" title="Wikipedia:Remove personal attacks">Personal attack removed</a>)</small></p>

<ul>
<li>I come from one of those parts of the world where "barbecue" means "grilling directly over charcoal". I am now aware of the distinction between between grilling and "Deep South" barbecue (the latter which I take to mean "cooking slowly by an indirect heat source and/or relatively cool smoke, sometimes using spicy, vinegary sauces"). Despite that, I am still in the dark as to what sort of contraption is needed for the Deep South-type barbecue. I don't think I've ever seen a good picture of such a thing. Is it essentially two metal boxes (the smoke/heat source and the cooking box) linked by a pipe? I think this article would benefit greatly from a diagram illustrating the difference between the two different methods. <a href="../../../l/e/o/User%7ELeon_Robbins_05ac.html" title="User:Leon Robbins">Leon Robbins</a> 22:06, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Should the regional sections of the article reflect (and perhaps explicitly mention) the conventional spelling of each region?

<p>Given the mere existance of "BBQ", I think "barbeque" appears to be more correct. "barbecue" looks like a misspelling that became common.

<p>For etymology - the spelling barbecue looks linked to the 1699 reference by William Dampier to <i>Borbecu’s</i> and the 1690 reference by Aphra Behn to <i>barbicu</i>. <a href="http://www.worldwidewords.org/qa/qa-bar1.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.worldwidewords.org/qa/qa-bar1.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> I don't think "barbecue" can be dismissed as a miss-spelling.

<dd>I think that the sections for each region should explicitly mention the common spellings/abbreviations in that region, but otherwise use the same spelling throughout the article.

For example, the <a href="../../../t/e/l/Television.html" title="Television">television</a> article mostly uses the full word television, but it refers to TV sets, which is the more common usage. <a href="../../../p/i/a/User%7EPianoman87_cd5d.html" title="User:Pianoman87">Graham</a> 05:45, 9 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The history channel special on "Barbecue" explains that the term "grilling" in reference to barbecue is in correct. The history of barbecue stresses that "grilling" was created as a technique to quicken and to simplify the process of cooking meats. The first appearence of the "grill" was by Weber who invented the new metal device as a quick and (relatively) painless way to cook meat. Even Weber didn't intend to draw a link between grilling and the slower process of creating barbecue. With the creation of mass produced charcoal families began to discover that they could recreate an outdoor meat taste without all of the work needed for barbecue. The introduction of national BBQ sauces in markets across America further made the gap between grilling and barbecue smaller. Companies such as Weber and Kraft marketed their product to convince the average American that they could easily make their own barbeque from their favorite meats in less than an hour. Product marketing (Kingsford, Weber, Kraft, KC Masterpiece) helped make the barbecue/grilling difference blurred for the average American. It is key to look at the history of the companies which had a profound impact on getting barbecue and grilling products in American homes. Kingsford charcoal bought KC Masterpiece in 1986 and took the product nationwide. The Clorox company (which owned Kingsford &amp; KC Masterpiece) took both products and presented them to the American public as a new way of having a "barbecue" and this tranformed into the misconception that families armed with a Weber, charcoal, and a bottle of sauce could "barbecue" their favorite meat and still be done in time to watch their favorite tv show that evening. The mass production of sauces which gave meat a barbecue taste led to Americans eventually calling almost anything barbecue. It wouldn't make sense for someone to call something barbecue only when they would use their KC Masterpiece . . . so the term stuck to include anything a person grilled in certain parts of the US. Language continually tries to simplify itself unconsciously so that the speaker labors as little as possible to convey their meaning. This same process which led to the creation of Romance languages, pidgin and creole languages . . . led to the ultimate perversion of the word barbecue and its over simplification. One day when I have enough time I can hopefully cite all of this information. If anyone else wants to cite some more about the history of what made barbecue what it is today that would be great. A very interesting fact about barbecue is the relation it had to the south and to the end of slavery. The spread of barbecue is actually linked to the ending of slavery. Also the reason why Texas uses beef for their "barbecue" being because beef during that same time period was the most affordable meat for Texans. Cowboys would take the unwanted cuts of meat and barbecue them so that they became tender. Keep getting that good ole barbecue! DJWikiDek 00:30, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Not bad. Some of that info is already at least touched on in the article (such as the distinction between grilling and barbecue, though there is no info on how they become befuddled in the first place; the relationship between barbecuing and slaves), but there is room for more info. I personally would look for citations beyond a TV show, though... I'm still peeved at the Food network show that compared the more popular regional variations against one another, and went and used "KC Masterpiece" as one of two representatives of Kansas City barbecue, so maybe I'm a wee bit biased, but still. If I recall, the reason for the popularity of beef in KC barbecue is very similar to that of the texas variation - KC was home to the biggest stockyards outside of Chicago, and a major stopping point of the cattle drives from Texas. In fact, one of the more famous local chains only recently started serving pork bbq. Anyways, back on topic - what you have does look decent as a rough draft - with citation, vast elements of your writing there can be integrated with only minor change (er, assuming it wasn't cut-n-paste from another source, which I assume it isn't!), at least in my opinion. --<a href="../../../r/e/v/User%7EReverend_Loki_a35b.html" title="User:Reverend Loki">Reverend Loki</a> 00:54, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
