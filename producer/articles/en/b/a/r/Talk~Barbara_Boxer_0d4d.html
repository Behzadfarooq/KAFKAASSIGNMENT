<dd>Agreed. It <i>still</i> reads like a campaign brochure. There isn't any reason, for example, to state that the Invest in the USA bill "would create 600,000 new jobs." That's for an article on the bill. This is an article about Boxer.

<p>Boxer is described as a "vocal advocate for ... the rights of the minority in the Senate", yet in 1994 she voted for a cloture motion aimed at ending the right of the Senate minority (in this case a Republican minority) to filibuster. Shouldn't this necessitate at least a tweaking of the "vocal advocate" label vis-a-vis "rights of the minority in the Senate"? Here is the cloture motion: <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?r103:S10MR4-868" class="external free" title="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?r103:S10MR4-868" rel="nofollow">http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?r103:S10MR4-868</a>: Clark Smith, Erfurt, Germany, 12:10, 2005 April 29</p>

<dd>Yes, she has acknowledged that and feels now that this decision was a mistake. She has publicly stated that her opinion has changed and that she regrets her prior vote, giving what she has learned. I would hope to see the same kind of wisdom from every member of the U.S. government: the ability to learn.

<p>I don't know how to add my own comment for the Barbara Boxer article, so I'll piggy-back on this note. The Boxer re-election campaign could not have written a more pandering, glowing profile! Is there really any effort by the Wiki community to attempt an unbiased presentation, or is this just a wink-nudge concept that is only followed when it's pointed out (if then)?</p>
<p>It would just be labeled "vandalism" if I changed a single word. It just needs a complete re-write, unless the intention of Wikipedia is present the Democratic party line. If so, then no changes are necessary at all.</p>

<p>The article says that Boxer supported capital punishment. But the good people at OnTheIssues.org <a href="http://www.issues2000.org/Senate/Barbara_Boxer.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.issues2000.org/Senate/Barbara_Boxer.htm" rel="nofollow">say otherwise</a>. Their records of Boxer's position:</p>
<ul>
<li>Moratorium on death penalty; more DNA testing</li>
<li>Require DNA testing for all federal executions</li>
<li>NO on rejecting racial statistics in death penalty appeals</li>
<li>NO on limiting death penalty appeals</li>
</ul>
<p>Until someone ponies up some proof of a pro-death penalty stance, I'm removing the information.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Granted. My stance on the dath penalty is somewhat ambiguous - but my stance on Barbara reflects that of the state of California. So to the point: supporting death penalty appeals is not neccessarily opposing the death penalty. It's opposing taking away the right to due process in regards one's life; the right of habeaus corpus (literally: you have the body), which is stated clearly in the constitution. So logically/legally speaking, neither she nor any member of congress, nor any judge or executive officer, has the authority to vote against appeals on the death penalty; if they would, they would not be doing so "under the authority of the united states", in other words they would not be acting in the capacity of a congressperson. But I digress - i have no objection to the removal of said content, it lacking substantiation as pointed out. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_baas_eec8.html" title="User:Kevin baas">Kevin Baas</a><sup><a href="../../../k/e/v/User_talk%7EKevin_baas_1af8.html" title="User talk:Kevin baas">talk</a>: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Kevin_baas&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Kevin_baas&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" rel="nofollow">new</a></sup> 06:27, August 28, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>A reader would think that Boxer is the least contrverisal Senator in Washington, which is not entirely accurate. Can we include some of the notable criticisms of Boxer? Cheers, -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillmcw_1a7f.html" title="User:Willmcw">Willmcw</a> 22:37, 5 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Indeed, there are absolutely no criticisms on this page. I think that the fact that she claimed to oppose all foreign ownership of ports when in fact 75% of her state's ports are foreign owned is an example of her ignorance on some issues. I placed that fact in the article and it was promptly deleted, but no one has said it was false.</p>
<p><br />
I think we should include notable criticisms, which means ones that can be sourced rather than ones proposed (for the first time) on this page. Anyone have any sourceable criticisms of Ms. Boxer?</p>

<p>This article is filled with fluff unrelated to her status as a US senator. it's also bloated. frankly, it reads like a campaign brochure. i've done my best to remove redundant wording and simplify overlong descriptive texts, but it's still much longer than most entries for - by and large - a senator lacking significant controversy (see kerry, kennedy, santorum, byrd, etc). <a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnastrophe-wikipedia_d908.html" title="User:Anastrophe-wikipedia">Anastrophe</a> 23:07, 25 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

ah. i see now that in fact most of this article really is directly from her own official website - <a href="http://boxer.senate.gov" class="external free" title="http://boxer.senate.gov" rel="nofollow">http://boxer.senate.gov</a>. while i'm sure there's no copyright involved in reproducing materials written at taxpayer expense, i seriously question the propriety of doing so. her official site is also her partisan site - you will not find a single word critical of her there. most of this article is strongly biased in her favor - POV. i think a POV tag should probably be applied, but better would be to revert the page to the one immediately before the wholesale inclusion of all this fluff, back in october. <a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnastrophe-wikipedia_d908.html" title="User:Anastrophe-wikipedia">Anastrophe</a> 23:37, 25 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>user baas, please explain your near wholesale reversion of my edits. most of what you have restored is highly POV, and as such not acceptable in an encyclopedia article. <a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnastrophe-wikipedia_d908.html" title="User:Anastrophe-wikipedia">Anastrophe</a> 18:57, 26 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>further review of user kevin baas's reversions shows almost no care for keeping the article NPOV. most of the edits i performed removed weasel wording that is unsourceable, except as being direct lifts from boxer's own senate website, which is essentially a campaign brochure - highly partisan, not NPOV. as well, the majority of my edits were to remove redundant wording that adds nothing to the article; wording that does not conform to good editorial practice; and wording that does not conform to other entries for political figures (it is unnecessary to repeat throughout the article "barbara" as her first name, nor "senator" for all those entries that are implicitly referring to her current tenure as a senator). reverting wholesale is not good practice. please discuss your justifications for the reversion of these changes, specifically, before doing so again.<a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnastrophe-wikipedia_d908.html" title="User:Anastrophe-wikipedia">Anastrophe</a> 19:08, 26 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>also, please review entries for other political figures. you will see that this article - even after my edits to trim the laudatory wording - is still a virtual bouquet of roses to this senator, rather than an NPOV encyclopedia entry. <a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnastrophe-wikipedia_d908.html" title="User:Anastrophe-wikipedia">Anastrophe</a> 19:09, 26 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I found that your intentions were good, but you were a bit overzealous. Some wording that you may have considered laudatory was just informative. For instance, comprehensive: "Comprehensive test ban treaty" - comprehensive can be an accurate, neutral descriptor, and it is interesting information. The Patriot Act is comprehensive - and although I think the Patriot Act is over-reching just like the Alien-Sedition Acts, and that this is just a repeat of a mistake we make every time there's a war like this, that we haven't learned from, I would nto object to calling it comprehensive, though I would object to the removal of that adjective. In any case, there was a lot of useful information trimmed, and I tried to put it back in, while preserving your elimination of rhetoric.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Regarding "Barbara" - I was preserving your trimming for the first half, but when i got to a certain point, a did a wholesale reversion of the remainder. I imagine you did a compromise semi-revert, I'll take a look at it and we can work together on getting something not-so-campaignish that still preserves usefull information. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_baas_eec8.html" title="User:Kevin baas">Kevin baas</a> 15:30, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>i restored almost all of my previous edits. rather than reverting virtually the whole of them, please edit the specifically problematic portions, as you noted above. i believe, with regard to 'comprehensive', it's use is valid for such things as the 'comprehensive test ban treaty', simply because that's the formal name of the treaty. <a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnastrophe-wikipedia_d908.html" title="User:Anastrophe-wikipedia">Anastrophe</a> 19:50, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>However, Boxer also was deeply involved in the House bank scandal in which congressmen, herself included, wrote bad checks in large amounts, an issue that the Sacramento Bee covered in a Mar. 1, 1992 article quoting Boxer as admitting she didn't pay enough attention to her House bank account. More specifically, that meant 143 bad checks totaling $41,417 over a three-year period that she had written on the House bank.</p>

<p>Someone has claimed that saying that <a href="../../../r/e/c/Recess_appointment.html" title="Recess appointment">recess appointment</a> is constitutional is POV. No. The Wikipedia article on <a href="../../../r/e/c/Recess_appointment.html" title="Recess appointment">recess appointment</a> (which is linked to in the section) says that it's explicitly in the Constitution. It's not debateable; under the current Constitution, <a href="../../../r/e/c/Recess_appointment.html" title="Recess appointment">recess appointment</a> is explicitly constitutional, look in the <a href="../../../r/e/c/Recess_appointment.html" title="Recess appointment">recess appointment</a> article to see where.

<dd>Um... no, no straw man, just mentioning that it's constitutional to avoid wrong impressions. You're assuming I'm using this article to argue and persuade, when I'm just using it to inform. You can't just say it's "straw man" because I said something that someone could possibly disagree with. I mean, if I had said "some people said it was wrong" or whatever, then maybe, but I didn't. By that logic, the whole article assumes that there are people alleging that Barbara Boxer is not a senator, has never done anything important, and doesn't even exist; the article suggests that some argue that Barbara Boxer is a figment of media imagination, and is building a straw man to refute this, saying she does indeed exist. You see what I mean? You're taking a three word phrase and seeing paragraphs of information that just aren't there. And the whole begigng the question accusation falls right in there; what am I assuming is correct here? That it's constitutional? I know that's not it, you said yourself it's not an assumption, it's the truth. So what am I assuming? What "question" am I begging (I don't think that's the right way to say it, but you get hwat I mean)?</dd>
<dd>I think you're seeing more to these three words than there really is. All I'm doing is mentioning that it's COnstitutional in order to avoid false impressions. I'm a pretty bright guy, but when I first read it it looked like Bush had done something wrong, until I read the <a href="../../../r/e/c/Recess_appointment.html" title="Recess appointment">recess appointment</a> article, so it's not just pre-middle school kids that could be duped, especially with the usage of the word "bypassed" in the same sentence, a word with bad connotation. My words add nothing but clarity, and there are no agenda-motivated assumptions behind them. I think you're assuming that I'm assuming a lot more than I'm really assuming. At least, that's what I assume you're assuming. HAHAHAHA <a href="../../../6/8/2E/User%7E68.59.61.191.html" title="User:68.59.61.191">68.59.61.191</a> 15:36, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Your arguments are just more logical fallacies. firstly, the point is that nobody is allegeding that it's unconstitutional. The chance that someone would get the wrong impression is negligible, and the article does not state or imply that it is unconstitutional, you're trying to fix something that ain't broke. but the impression that what you want to add gives people is that some people <i>do</i> have the wrong impression, which is not true or at best, original research. unless you can provide some sort of references to verify that ppl think or have said that it's unconstituional, it's a straw man fallacy. This article is not a straw man fallacy because there are people who don't know this stuff about barbara boxer, that's what an encyclopedia is for. on the content must meet the criteria of interesting and important, by common sense AND according to <i>policy</i>. That it's constitutional is obvious, and in general actions are assumed to be legal unless otherwise contested, because if there was any dispute it certainly would be interesting and important and be in the article. but whoa and behold, there isn't any dispute on this point in the article. so unless you can find a significant dispute and put it in the article per policy, then you're stating something that the reader is expected to assume, and therefore being redundant, making them think: "why is this mentioned?" "oh, they must be trying to clear up a common misconception." Thus, it implies that there's a common misconception.

People would only assume that it's a dispute just because it's mentioned if they were on guard for phrases that are aimed to persuade. If this were some kind of persuasive web page, it would be an issue, but it's just an informative encyclopedia, mentioning an uncommon occurence, recess appointment.

<dd>This isn't some jab that "makes it clear" that it's not unconstitutional, as I've already stated (and was ignored; perhaps you're thinking I'm not being honest?); it's just the inclusion of a fact, nothing more. It's no different than saying Boxer's a Democrat. Is that disputed? Are people getting the wrong impression by reading the article that her political orientation is in dispute? Or the fact that she's form California, do people also think that's in dispute? Have people been confused and befuddled by these statemtents? Not likely. Including something doesn't automatically imply that it's in dispute, especially something explicit and unarguable, such as Barbara Boxer's political preference, her state of origin, or the constitutionality of recess appointment. The reason I included, as I'll say again, is to mention that it's in the Constitution, because it's not as well-known as, say, veto power. I think it's overestimating the average reader (who is not, I'm guessing, a political figure article editor) to "expect them to assume" that it's in the Constitution. You say I need a source saying people could get the wrong impression? I could just as easily ask you for one saying they won't be, so that really doesn't cut it. The inclusion of a simple modifier phrase like this is not a POV statement, and couldn't be interpreted to imply a dispute by anyone who is not specifically looking to dispose of any words that make the President's actions seem valid or legal. This is a simple inclusion of a fact aimed at giving a very brief description of where the authority for a recess appointment originates, something that is not likely to be common knowledge, since recess appointments for Supreme Court justices are rare, and generally not brought into the media spotlight.</dd>

Besides, this isn't even something that widely known, so there should be no problem with including it. Maybe you should do a little more assuming of good faith before you start accusing me of including a simple modifier as part of an agenda to start a mass rumor about a question of the constitutionality of Bush's recess appointment.

<dd>Her state, party and stances on issues are important pieces of information in an article about her, not throwaway factoids like what you are edit warring to retain in this article. There are innumerable unimportant descriptors we could add to facts everywhere. An encyclopedia article wouldn't bother itself saying say "Barbara Boxer, whose hair is wavy," even though it's true. We also don't say "... the senator from California, which has many mountain ranges," even though it's true. Similarly there's no need for this.

<dd>Well, by that logic, why is this snippet even in there in the first place? It's a recess appointment, linked to Bush, linked to the judge, linked to Barbara Boxer. I may not like it, but if it's too obscure to describe, it's to obscure to even include. After all, just as you wouldn't say "Barbara BOxer has wavy hair", you wouldn't say "Barbara BOxer has hair" with no adjective. If it's not even important to label as constitutional, it shouldn't stand there, disallowed from being modified with a simple phrase, forcing people to make their own conclusions. If it can't be clarified, it shouldn't be included. <a href="../../../6/8/2E/User%7E68.59.61.191.html" title="User:68.59.61.191">68.59.61.191</a> 15:53, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Islamophobia <i>In late 2006, Senator Boxer angered the interfaith and civil rights communities in California after rescinding an award to a local Muslim activist Basim Elkarra due to allegations from from an extremist right-wing and pro-Israel blogger.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></i> <b>If Not Now, When?</b> <a href="http://www.infocusnews.net/content/view/4025/234/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.infocusnews.net/content/view/4025/234/" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>
<p>This incident has nothing to do with her bills, voting records, policies etc. Unlike its heading "Islamophobia," the section is only about how she rescinded an award to a Muslim not about her stances on the Muslim community. I would also like to say that it seemed POV. Its articles are also from Muslim POV, and one of them is an editorial. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESaranghae_honey_f82d.html" title="User:Saranghae honey">mirageinred</a> 23:13, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think this article comes from a more NPOV. <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/16384987/site/newsweek/" class="external free" title="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/16384987/site/newsweek/" rel="nofollow">http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/16384987/site/newsweek/</a> Whether her action was justified or not, this section doesn't fit very well into "bills and policy positions." <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESaranghae_honey_f82d.html" title="User:Saranghae honey">mirageinred</a> 23:18, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
