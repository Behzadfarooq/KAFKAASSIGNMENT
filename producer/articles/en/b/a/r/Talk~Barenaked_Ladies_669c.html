<p>This is all heresay, but I heard that the band got it's name when it was playing a gig with another band and neither one of the band's had a name for itself. They decided to call themselves <b>Barenaked Ladies</b>, and the other band decided to call themselves <b>Free Beer</b>. That way the sign outside would read:</p>
<p>TONIGHT FEATURING FREE BEER AND BARENAKED LADIES</p>
<p>That of course is all rumor and urban legend. <a href="../../../m/u/j/User%7EMuj0_bf2e.html" title="User:Muj0">Muj0</a></p>
<p>This website would seem to give that story some credence <a href="http://www.freebeernet.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.freebeernet.com" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>Barenaked Ladies started when Steven Page and Ed Robertson got together in the late 80's. Ed was in a band at the time, and had promised that they would appear at a charity show. When the show organizers called him to make sure they were coming, he had forgotten all about it, and his band had broken up. He assured them that he would come, with his new band, Barenaked Ladies. The name was made up earlier, when Steve and Ed were far back at a boring concert, and making up fake band names. Ed then proceeded to call Steve and let him know that he'd signed them up to play. It was just going to be a one-time gig, but by chance it kept going, and became the actual band. This is the explanation given by the band themselves, and is included in their biography. Just wanted to clear that up.&#160;:) --<a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatteroast_e908.html" title="User:Patteroast">Patteroast</a> 10:53, 12 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p><br />
The official story, from both Ed and Steve (the only two members who in the band when the name was chosen, is as follows:</p>
<p>They both went to a Bob Dylan Concert at the Ex in Toronto. It was very boring so they started pretending they were old music critics to amuse each other with comments like 'and who could forget that old metal band from the 80's, Barenaked Ladies?'. The name was one of many they made up during the concert.</p>
<p>Unrelatedly, Ed had commited his band to a gig for the Second Harvest Food Bank at Nathan Phillips Square. Ed's band however broke up. He forgot about the gig until someone called to confirm his band would be there - in a panic he said 'yes, but the name of the band has changed to... Barenaked Ladies' (recalling the name from the recent Dylan concert). He then called Steve up and asked him if he wanted to be in Barenaked Ladies with him (Steve replied with something like 'You told them we were called that?'). They set up 3 rehersal times and missed them all. They pulled out of the battle of the bands and asked if they could just play while the other bands setup. They rehersed under the ramp at the Square with every song they could think of that they knew how to play, and that was the first BNL show. Thus, the name isn't intended to be sexist, or provocative or anything because no thought really went into it being their name. It was a spur of the moment decision. Afterwards, they kept the name with the naive reasoning that 'if we ever book a gig, people who liked us from the Second Harvest show will never be able to find us if we change our name'. The name has been explained in many interviews is just 'what you call it when you're little kids and you see a girl in a magazine or through a window. It's a remeniscance of youth - though I would suggest that this may have been an explaination derived after they decided it would be their name, or even after people starting asking about the name. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheHYPO_6e9a.html" title="User:TheHYPO">TheHYPO</a> 12:37, 17 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Several removals:</p>
<p><i>Later that month, BNL was an opening act for <a href="../../../d/a/v/Dave_Matthews_Band_b2ac.html" title="Dave Matthews Band">Dave Matthews Band</a> at a weekend-long festival at <a href="../../../r/a/n/Randall%27s_Island_9213.html" title="Randall's Island">Randall's Island</a> in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_City_1428.html" title="New York City">New York City</a>.</i> -While perfectly true, there was nothing particularly special or historically important about this performance, it doesn't bear mention in the article any more than any other preformance.</p>
<p><i>all of which they performed at Camp Tamarack to a crowd of adoring 6 to 18 year-old youths during the Summer of 1990.</i> - Similarly, this seems like a pretty trivial mention of one random show in discussion of Gordon when the show really has nothing to do with the album, and the band played many shows.</p>
<p><i>The band has also collaborated with singer <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tom_Jones_%28singer%29_8063.html" title="Tom Jones (singer)">Tom Jones</a> for a track on his 1999 album</i> <a href="../../../r/e/l/Reload_%28Tom_Jones_album%29_823a.html" title="Reload (Tom Jones album)">Reload</a><i>.</i> And again, while this is true, it's one of many single track collaborations the band has had, and this one was not particularly notable as successful or special in a way that it needs to be mentioned in the notes on Stunt. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheHYPO_6e9a.html" title="User:TheHYPO">TheHYPO</a> 15:36, 17 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The name of that band sounds familiar, so I'm not saying I doubt the existance of that band - I recall it from somewhere, but is there a verification that that was the particular band that broke up around this show? I know Ed was in more than one band in his youth before BNL. Also, the band that broke up for this show wasn't specifically a Rush cover band, but an all-sorts-of-music cover band - I don't know if Ed ever was in a Rush-specific cover band. If this band was a Rush-only cover band, it sounds like it might not be the particular one that broke up at that time...</p>

<dd>Good point. I also recognise the name, but without checking with the band somehow I can't verify it. You're correct about it being a generic cover band though: in the iTunes originals with Barenaked Ladies, Steve said that "Ed's band were all over the map...they played everything from Talking Heads, to Peter Gabriel, to Tears For Fears, and some...canadian classic rock" <a href="../../../l/u/k/User%7ELukasa_6be7.html" title="User:Lukasa">Lukasa</a> 16:13, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's a fair point, but it's probably not an easy task. Much of the information comes from common knowledge of the fanbase, and other information is from live conversations with band members, concert banters, and other sources that aren't the kind of thing that is easily citable. Other info can come from articles someone read a long time ago about the band that they haven't had in their posession for a long time. Someone should probably go through the band's PSPS Bio and cite anything that is cited in there (though it should be noted that there are some typos and mis-infos in that book anyway so...)<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheHYPO_6e9a.html" title="User:TheHYPO">TheHYPO</a> 17:39, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Should the CMCC get its own article?

<p>First of all, can someone cite evidence (or at least a story behind) the following being noted as singles?</p>
<ul>
<li>"War On Drugs" - when was this released as a single? I simply can't imagine this happening.</li>
<li>"It's Only Me" - was this actually released?</li>
<li>"Alcohol" - I know there was a 6-song Stunt Sampler that this song was the title track on, but was this song ever actually intended as a single?</li>
<li>"Govatsos Shuffle" - how was this a single?</li>
<li>Rock spec. 1997-8 saw several releases of Brian Wilson 2000 and the live. I don't think it needs to be multi-listed. Just like Old Apartment was released as both BOAPS and RS within the 96-97 frame.</li>
<li>"Grim Grinning Ghosts" - was this a single? What do we base this on?</li>
<li>"Fight the Power" - I'm not sure about this one. Was it actually the single from that soundtrack?</li>
</ul>
<p>I would also like to reshuffle the primary/secondary/live album distinction (if so, Holidays might be a secondary release, since they wrote only a small part of it). I think the releases should be split by the significance of release, not the type of content. IE: Rock Spec and Disc One should be primary, since they had major commercial releases, charted, had press releases, appearances and touring, etc.</p>
<p>As for secondary, I have a few hesitations about it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Shoebox EP, though titled 'EP', is pretty much a CD single. It's a 4 track including 2 versions of the title. I'd call it a single, and not necessarily include it as a release (no more than the current 'Easy EP' is really an EP).</li>
<li>As You Like it is definately a secondary release,</li>
<li>Barenaked On A Stick is definately a secondary.</li>
<li>Is Barenaked 4 Hannukkah? It's really just a sampler repackaging for download. I'd say that a note about it on the BN4Holidays article is sufficient, and it's not really a secondary release. If it has to be mentioned in the article, I'd say under a seperate 'online repackaging' section with Everything Acoustic?</li>
</ul>
<p>I think maybe Primary, secondary for things like Barenaked On A Stick, As You Like It; and 'online releases' for itunes, the EPs and I think all the tour lives can be summed up with "Most Shows from all major tours since 2004" with a barenakedladies.com link. It's tough because, though I think iTunes is a notable release due to its exclusive recordings an interviews, I wouldn't call Everything Acoustic or HannukahEP even secondary releases. Tertiary at best, since they are just repackages. Perhaps even less significant than single releases, which we don't list here - at least not physical singles)</p>

<p>I'm planning on going through three or more sources: Behind The Music, a significant lengthed interview with Ed spanning their entire careers, and the iTunes Originals audio.

<p>That's all you need to do.

<p>I find it odd that the Barenaked Ladies tables at the bottom of all BNL-related articles list the singles which have official releases and videos, whereas the previous_single/this_single/next_single tables listed on the single pages oft include singles which are not listed in the before mentioned table, and do not even have articles.</p>
<p>Which seems the more logical course of action -- adding articles for those singles and adding them to the BNL table, or removing them from the timeline and correcting the order? <a href="../../../j/p/g/User%7EJPG-GR_8f4b.html" title="User:JPG-GR">JPG-GR</a> 05:51, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Some people have different ideas of what qualifies a single. "A" had a radio promo released but never had a video and didn't have much of a release. "Alcohol" was the title track of an album promo disc but also never had a video. The article for Stunt indicates that it was a moderate radio hit, so that implies to me that someone remembers it being a radio single, but it wasn't a high profile one and I suspect it has been forgotten (assuming the statement about the radio single is accurate). It's pretty hard to confirm things from that period. Similarly, there IS a radio promo for It's Only Me from Disc One, but it was never "promoted" as a single so whether is counts as a single is up in the air. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheHYPO_6e9a.html" title="User:TheHYPO">TheHYPO</a> 23:06, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't disagree but I don't have an opinion as to which one should 'reign'. It's not the only problem. Other problem include album chrono boxes - right now Barelaked Nadies is on the chronology (I forget where - before Everything to Everyone I think) even though it's a DVD, not a CD and contains no real original material (other than commentary). I wouldn't put it there, but someone did and because wiki has no guideline defining exactly what should in the chrono (I'd say only major album releases, but others could argue it...), it's not easy to deal with. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheHYPO_6e9a.html" title="User:TheHYPO">TheHYPO</a> 06:17, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

As for the singles... that's still tough to say. At this point, I'm inclined to prefer -neither- of the current lists, but more a version in the middle (for instance, I would count both FFTFT and TLTL from Maroon, but not A) <a href="../../../j/p/g/User%7EJPG-GR_8f4b.html" title="User:JPG-GR">JPG-GR</a> 19:59, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>For me, a good general rule would be "if there's a video, it's a single," but then you have to ask about both LiaDT and TTWF, which I don't think I'd count either.

<p>Both were singles unquestionably. You're the first person I've ever heard question one of those. If a song got a video, it's almost unquestionably a single. TTWF was a single, but possibly only in Canada. Lovers was definately a single. It's on Disc One, a singles-only collection. The iffy ones. Unless you added it, I see both FFFT and TLTL on the list on this page so I'm not sure why you say it's not there unless it wasn't there before and you've added it. Questionable singles are non-video songs. Celebrity was a UK single. Maybe Katie was supposedly a Canadian Single. For You had a radio single. 'A' did too. Million dollars never had a video but it had two or three UK singles and possibly North American ones... it's all debatable. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheHYPO_6e9a.html" title="User:TheHYPO">TheHYPO</a> 08:35, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You're misunderstanding me. I'm -not- saying that those two singles are questionable. I noticed they were missing because I was going through the list of what -I- thought would be the notable ones, and those ones stood out like sore thumbs as missing. And, currently, neither FFFT or TLTL are listed in the table at the bottom, nor have they been. (<a href="../../../b/a/r/Template%7EBarenaked_Ladies_00b8.html" title="Template:Barenaked Ladies">Template:Barenaked Ladies</a>) I'd add them, but for the life of me, I'm not sure which of them came first anymore. <a href="../../../j/p/g/User%7EJPG-GR_8f4b.html" title="User:JPG-GR">JPG-GR</a> 23:46, 3 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>OH, you mean that table. I think you answered your own question. I assumed you were referring to the 'discography' section of the site. Yes, the template has only existing song pages. "Single" might be a mistitling, but I believe the point is to collect all the pages on BNL songs that exist on wikipedia, though I didn't make the template. TLTL came first, but I wouldn't bother adding it until someone makes a page for the songs. They are likely to thus add the page themselves after making it. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheHYPO_6e9a.html" title="User:TheHYPO">TheHYPO</a> 07:17, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Listening to BnL's "iTunes Originals" which intersplices interviews with Ed and Steve with rerecorded specials, Steve states explicitly that the Yellow Tape was the first indie album to go *gold*, not platinum. I'm changing it accordingly until someone verifies otherwise. Funkbomb 04:33, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Even if you're right, you're. This isn't America, it's Canada. Gold is 50k, platinum is 100k. That said, I've only ever heard Yellow tape cited as being the first indie to go gold (50k) in Canada; but if none had ever gone gold, even if the tape went platinum later, it would still be the first to go gold. I see some pages on yahoo that mention platinum, but they all seem to be pretty much ripped from the same wiki page and other similar articles, so I'm not sure if there's a source on platinum or not yet. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheHYPO_6e9a.html" title="User:TheHYPO">TheHYPO</a> 07:50, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Alright then, wouldn't it seem reasonable to change it to gold, with the statistic at 50K? this is a verifiable source.Funkbomb 03:38, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
