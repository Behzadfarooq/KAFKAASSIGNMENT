<p>This might just be my personal taste, but the sentences look a bit short and choppy in some places (one sentence starts with "but" for example). It's not quite an A article for reasons of length (there should be a bit more to write on a ten-year career) and language, but it's a good starting point. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Vimes_3ff9.html" title="User:Sam Vimes">Sam Vimes</a> | <a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESam_Vimes_177e.html" title="User talk:Sam Vimes">Address me</a> 16:36, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I would also give it a B-Class rating, but I think with a bit of work and a lot of expansion on his career, you can at least put it through <a href="../../../g/a/c/WP%7EGAC_00ed.html" title="WP:GAC">WP:GAC</a>. <b><a href="../../../n/o/b/User%7ENobleeagle_e018.html" title="User:Nobleeagle"><font color="darkblue">Noble</font><font color="darkorange">eagle</font></a></b> <sup><a href="../../../n/o/b/User_talk%7ENobleeagle_accc.html" title="User talk:Nobleeagle"><font color="darkred" size="0.2" face="Arial Narrow">[TALK]</font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Nobleeagle_dfb1.html" title="Special:Contributions/Nobleeagle"><font color="darkred" size="0.2" face="Arial Narrow">&#160;[C]</font></a></sup> 22:37, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p><i>It was during his time with Belmont, in 1908, that King topped the England bowling averages with the extraordinary figure of 11.01. This was not bettered until 1958 when Les Jackson of Derbyshire posted an average of 10.99.[9]</i></p>
<p>What is the cut-off for inclusion in this list&#160;? King did not take 100 wkts (he took 87), so I guess it is something else (like we have 8 completed innings criterion for batting). <a href="../../../t/i/n/User_talk%7ETintin1107_ddb3.html" title="User talk:Tintin1107">Tintin</a> 18:21, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There's no universally agreed cut-off. However all the figures that I've seen used are far short of 100 wickets.

<dd><i>Wisden</i> has used, at least in recent decades, a minimum of 10 wickets and that the bowler must have bowled in at least 10 innings. 10 wickets seems very much on the low side, but any bowler who took 10 or more innings to get so few wickets would I suppose have a poor average. <a href="../../../j/h/a/User%7EJhall1_5763.html" title="User:Jhall1">JH</a> 21:58, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The <a href="../../../c/r/i/WP%7ECRIC_f681.html" title="WP:CRIC">WP:CRIC</a> standards are clear on how to rate importance. They say that National captains are generally classed as high importance, and players with many tests are generally classed as mid to high importance. King played no Tests, and I'm not sure if he ever captained a US national side.

<dd>I think so. Inevitably there's an element of subjectivity in assigning Importance rankings, but you could argue that MCC's having made him an Honorary Life Member must have meant that they rated him very highly. Also Ralph Barker's including him as one of his <i>10 Great Bowlers</i> is quite a feather in his cap, plus there's Warner's and other noted cricketers' evaluation of him. <a href="../../../j/h/a/User%7EJhall1_5763.html" title="User:Jhall1">JH</a> 21:02, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As a matter of personal taste, it doesn't read very well that the four sentences in the intro have very similar superlatives packed too close together ("one of the greatest American cricketers of all time", "the most prominent player in the United States", "one of the finest bowlers of all time", "He is arguably the greatest of all cricketers to have come from North America "). While we can argue about the semantics, the last of these practically makes the first two redundant (though I think the the last is the least important of the four).

<dd><small>John Barton "Bart" King (October 19, 1873–October 17, 1965) was an American cricketer, active in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Born in 1873, King was one of the Philadelphian cricketers that played in the period from the end of the 19th century until the outbreak of World War One. Though this period of cricket in the United States was dominated by wealthy gentlemen players, King was an amateur that was able to play based solely on his skill. He was not only a skilled athlete, but was regarded as an amiable individual. His colleagues and opponents regularly commented on his ability to keep everyone around him laughing.[3] Even as he dismissed batsmen he was able to remain friends with them off of the cricket ground. King's place on lists of powerful cricketers is assured by his statistics.</small></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><small>King was a very skilled batsman, but really proved his worth as a bowler. During his career, he set numerous records in North America and at least one first-class bowling record.[4] He competed with and succeeded against the best cricketers in the world from England and Australia. King was the dominant bowler on his team when it toured England in 1897, 1903, and 1908. He dismissed batters with his unique delivery, which he called "the angler," and helped to perfect swing bowling in the sport. Many of the great bowlers of today still use the strategies and techniques that he developed.[5] Sir Pelham Warner described Bart King as one of the finest bowlers of all time[1] , and Donald Bradman called him "America's greatest cricketing son."[2]</small></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>"Bart King was a very amiable person and was never at a loss for words. Ralph Barker called him the Bob Hope of cricket thanks to his quips and stories. King was noted for always striking the right note–taking jabs at opponents, but leaving them laughing at themselves. He might ask searching questions of an umpire who turned down his appeals–though in a tone that could only cause laughter. On his last English tour he is said to have spoken for ninety minutes at a dinner that were punctuated every few seconds with laughs. While King spoke with a dead-pan expression, the dinner guests nearly collapsed in hysterics. One man that was there noted that King "told his impossible tales with such an air of conviction...that his audiences were always in doubt when to take him seriously. He made their task doubly difficult by sprinkling in a fair mixture of truth with his fiction." All this paragraph is a hagiography of King's character. You know ... It is fine with me! But I'm not sure it is fine with Wikipedia's (sometimes peculiar!) NPOV policy. Maybe if you could keep the tone down a bit in the beginning, starting like that: "Ralph Barker called King the Bob Home of cricket thanks to his wit quips and stories; he was often striking the right ... " Something like that ... in order to avoid strong epithets ("amiable") and adverbs ("never", "always").</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>"According to the Wisden Cricketers' Almanack King proved himself far and away the best bowler on the American side and had to do much of the work." "Far and away" is too much IMO for a Wikipedia article.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>"It was in this match that King gave "the finest exhibition of skill and endurance which ever came from an American in first-class cricket."[24] I don't know know if it is necessary to repeat in every section that he is the best American cricketer ever. He got that from the lead and the previous section as well.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>"King was one of the finest bowlers his age, and certainly the finest ever to come from the United States.[30]" Again! I count the same assessment for the fourth or fifth time, I think (3 times in the lead, 1 in "Tour of England in 1897", 1 in "Tour of England in 1903" and one more in this section)! It is getting more a problem of repetition than of POV.</li>
</ul>
<p>In general, I must say that the POV problems are minor, but they should be fixed, especially when these assessments get repetitive IMO. If we forget these issues, the article in nicely written.--<a href="../../../y/a/n/User%7EYannismarou_16f4.html" title="User:Yannismarou">Yannismarou</a> 18:02, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd><i>"According to the Wisden Cricketers' Almanack King proved himself far and away the best bowler on the American side and had to do much of the work." "Far and away" is too much IMO for a Wikipedia article.</i> Isn't "far and away" a direct quote from Wisden? If so, it seems fair enough. Looking at King's statistics and his reputation, I don't think that there is any doubt that he was the best ever American cricketer by a wide margin. I accept a line needs to be drawn between emphasising that and being guilty of over-repetition.

<p>A nasty piece of proof-reading. Sorry for not fixing some of the things myself. Feeling too lazy&#160;:-/</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Though this period of cricket in the United States was dominated by wealthy gentlemen players, King was an amateur that was able to play based solely on his skill</p>
<ul>
<li>I suppose what is meant is that the players used to be amateurs who found a place in the teams on account of their wealth but King wasn't particularly rich but still played as one. The second half of the sentence is intended to contradict the first, but it doesn't convey that to the reader.</li>
</ul>
<p>&gt;&gt; During his career, he set numerous records in North America and at least one first-class bowling record.[2]</p>
<ul>
<li>It is not mentioned what this record is. The ref just mentions Neil Cohen's book.</li>
</ul>
<p>&gt;&gt; King proved his batting worth on a fourth-wicket stand of 109 with John Lester 107 <a href="http://cricketarchive.co.uk/Archive/Scorecards/4/4791.html" class="external free" title="http://cricketarchive.co.uk/Archive/Scorecards/4/4791.html" rel="nofollow">http://cricketarchive.co.uk/Archive/Scorecards/4/4791.html</a></p>
<p>&gt;&gt; In the second innings, King took 5 for 102 a</p>
<ul>
<li>6/102. Same link as above</li>
</ul>
<p>&gt;&gt; He bowled three hundred overs more than anyone else and took as many wickets.</p>
<ul>
<li>Not clear what is meant by "as many wickets". It is an exaggeration if it is "as many wickets as everyone else put together" (72 v 121)</li>
</ul>
<p>&gt;&gt; King scored 447 runs with an average of just over 20</p>
<ul>
<li>441 <a href="http://cricketarchive.co.uk/Archive/Seasons/Seasonal_Averages/ENG/1897_f_Batting_by_Runs.html" class="external free" title="http://cricketarchive.co.uk/Archive/Seasons/Seasonal_Averages/ENG/1897_f_Batting_by_Runs.html" rel="nofollow">http://cricketarchive.co.uk/Archive/Seasons/Seasonal_Averages/ENG/1897_f_Batting_by_Runs.html</a></li>

<p>&gt;&gt; He took 2 for 26 against Gloucestershire in the first innings but did not play the second.</p>
<ul>
<li><i>bowl</i> in the second</li>
</ul>
<p>&gt;&gt;He also made 7 for 21 and 2 for 28 against a strong MCC side at Lord’s.</p>

<li>7 for 51. Use 'took' instead of 'made'. <a href="http://cricketarchive.co.uk/Archive/Scorecards/6/6232.html" class="external free" title="http://cricketarchive.co.uk/Archive/Scorecards/6/6232.html" rel="nofollow">http://cricketarchive.co.uk/Archive/Scorecards/6/6232.html</a></li>

<p>&gt;&gt;In the second innings he made 113 and took 3 for 98. Surrey lost the match by 110 runs.</p>
<ul>
<li>113* <a href="http://cricketarchive.co.uk/Archive/Scorecards/6/6316.html" class="external free" title="http://cricketarchive.co.uk/Archive/Scorecards/6/6316.html" rel="nofollow">http://cricketarchive.co.uk/Archive/Scorecards/6/6316.html</a></li>
</ul>
<p>&gt;&gt;He also scored 39 centuries in his first-class career and he topped 1,000 runs in a season six times.</p>
<ul>
<li>You must be talking about league cricket in USA. He scored only one fc 100 (the 113*) and never made 1000.</li>
</ul>
<p>&gt;&gt;Bart King took all 10 wickets in an innings on three occasions (on five others he took 9 wickets). One of these occasions, against the Gentlemen of Ireland, in 1909 was followed by his taking the hat-trick in the second innings.[32]</p>
<ul>
<li>There is again a little mixup here. 3 10WIs must be in all cricket, while the 10WI v Ireland was in an fc match. So it may be highlighted.</li>
</ul>
<p>&gt;&gt;A bowler like Yorkshire's George Hirst started to shatter stumps with balls that ducked in with the force of a hard throw in from mid-off.</p>
<ul>
<li>The version that I am familiar with is that it was like a good throw from <i>cover point</i> (the first result in a google search is <a href="http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/wisdencricketer/content/story/258600.html" class="external free" title="http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/wisdencricketer/content/story/258600.html" rel="nofollow">http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/wisdencricketer/content/story/258600.html</a> ) Would like to hear the opinion of JHall/Johnlp etc on this. <a href="../../../t/i/n/User_talk%7ETintin1107_ddb3.html" title="User talk:Tintin1107">Tintin</a> 15:39, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Just came across this about Hirst's "swerve" (which I think we would nowadays call "swing", in a book by AA Thomson: "He began as a straight fast bowler and only developed his slightly diabolical 'swerve' round about the turn of the century. On his swerving day hardly anyone could play him. His swerver must have been a fearsome ball to deal with; its victims said it came suddenly at you like a fierce throw-in from cover."

Although Hirst did not play in that match, I like to imagine that in the nets afterwards King taught him how to bowl the swerver. Unfortunately I've no hard evidence to back it up.

<p>Others have noted that the GAC was going to be no problem. It seems that they were right because two editors have given us a pass on that front. Now, I'd like to push toward Featured Article Candidacy. Tintin made reference to <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony1_How_to_satisfy_Criterion_1a_7a97.html" title="User:Tony1/How to satisfy Criterion 1a">this article</a> by <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony1_9951.html" title="User:Tony1">Tony</a>. Based on others' input, the prose will be the largest obstacle to FA status.

<p>Good points, both. I'll get on those right away. Thanks. I've also put a notice for copy-editing on the page and on the league of copy-editors with the idea of getting the prose to be compelling/brilliant.--<a href="../../../e/v/a/User%7EEvadb_288e.html" title="User:Evadb"><font color="blue"><b>Eva</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../e/v/a/User_talk%7EEvadb_794e.html" title="User talk:Evadb"><b><font color="red">b</font></b></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Evadb_7e94.html" title="Special:Contributions/Evadb"><b><font color="green">d</font></b></a></sup> 22:27, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>As to the points raised above by Tintin1107 and Jhall1, I now have answers. Try as I might, I've not been able to find a hard copy of the Picador book. What I quoted was from a transcription of some information on rec.sport.cricket. Regarding the 1908 series, I don't think that it deserves as much coverage. King seems to have been declining in his allround form, though he did set the bowling average record, I haven't found much more info on specifics. Any other thoughts before this is FACed (after a CopyEdit)?--<a href="../../../e/v/a/User%7EEvadb_288e.html" title="User:Evadb"><font color="blue"><b>Eva</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../e/v/a/User_talk%7EEvadb_794e.html" title="User talk:Evadb"><b><font color="red">b</font></b></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Evadb_7e94.html" title="Special:Contributions/Evadb"><b><font color="green">d</font></b></a></sup> 20:38, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Obviously if information is in short supply for the 1908 tour then there isn't a lot you can do until/unless more turns up. But given King's bowling figures for that tour, I can't agree that it deserves less coverage than the other two if the information can be found. I think it should have a section of its own, even if it has to be shorter than those on the other two tours.
