<p>Come on, admit it, if she would no Scientologist, this article never would have been written. She files a couple of FOIA requests and files some lawsuits,(big deal - NOT) mades some claims of which she admits she has no proof just memories, and you guys go all gaga about it.

<dd>I would definitely be editing this article if she were not a Scientologist, anyone who files the amount of <i>pro se</i> litigation she has is notable. She has filled much more than "a few" requests, here is a link to some I found with a quick Google search of .gov domains. <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=FOIA+%22Barbara+Schwarz%22+site:.gov&amp;num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;filter=0" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=FOIA+%22Barbara+Schwarz%22+site:.gov&amp;num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;filter=0" rel="nofollow">This is just a fraction of her cases.</a></dd>
<dd>Moreover her experience being "deprogrammed" seems noteworthy too for it's own reasons. Personally the idea of forced deprogramming is a euphemism for kidnapping, but some people seem to think it's a good idea. I understand that Ms. Schwarz still considers herself a Scientologist, I guess it didn't work. (If she hadn't been a Scientologist, I'm assuming they'd be trying to deprogram her for some other reason)</dd>
<dd>Your point about there being difficulty telling between truth and memories is quite correct. That's why I personally have endeavored to only mention memories that are also addressed in court papers. I do not believe that ALL of the information in her autobiographic series merits inclusion here for exactly that reason.</dd>
<dd>I don't think "people hate her guts", honestly I think they mostly feel sorry for her. Nobody wants to go down in history for doing something perceived as madness, regretfully though it is often those people who are very notable . <a href="../../../a/n/y/User%7EAnynobody_bd2c.html" title="User:Anynobody">Anynobody</a> 06:36, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

You did get some votes for deletion, which I don't find to be that unusual considering that you spent considerably more time writing the nomination that the previous editors.

<dd>Respectfully , many of the editors who commented in the previous three AfDs addressed your concern about notability. (Actually the very first vote of the first AfD went directly toward notability as you'll see below.) I don't know if you read many of the comments left by editors who voted to keep, but here are a few examples from each of the three previous AfDs of notability discussion, starting with the very first comment:

<li>Keep Very notable in the FOIA scene. Also notable in that she is a major player in the Alt.Relgion.Scientology scene, which is clearly a point of interest given that A.R.S. also has its own entry. She is a curious facet of our modern times, and many, many internet denizens know of her and refer to her, which would cause others to seek her out on Wikipedia. There is no good reason to delete this page; unless you are Scientology, or Barbara Schwarz. Databind() 20:04, 30 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>When I said you haven't brought up anything that hasn't been addressed in the previous AfDs, quotes like these are what I meant. Many editors used notability arguments to trump concerns about it being an attack article. <a href="../../../a/n/y/User%7EAnynobody_bd2c.html" title="User:Anynobody">Anynobody</a> 06:56, 21 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>OK, there were mentions of notability in the previous AfDs. But, in my estimation, a true and fair discussion of the issue was overshadowed by the wrong premise nominations and the fact that a better case was not made for deletion. I felt that I could make that better case and I did and a sizable portion of the respondents agreed with me and a number of those that did not agree with me acknowledged that I was justified in bringing the AfD and that I made valid arguments that they just did not happen to agree with. So the AfD is over; and I acknowledged on the closing admin's talk page that the consensus was "Keep". So what. Move on, please. I have. --<a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother</a> 15:01, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I've actually kept <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barbara_Schwarz_fc5e.html" title="Barbara Schwarz">Barbara Schwarz</a> on my watch list because I think there is more work to be done here. <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother</a>, if you've "moved on" why are you still trying to justify your reasons for creating the fourth AfD? Saying "OK, there were mentions of notability in the previous AfDs." is actually a bit of an understatement considering it was the notability of the article that was cited by most of the editors voting to keep. It makes a separate AfD on the subject of notability seem superfluous. I'm sorry if it seems like I'm stuck on this, but my posts here have all been replies. If you do really want to move on, perhaps you should consider not making new posts on the subject. If you had not made posts I disagree with, I would not have replied.

<dd>Oh puleese, Anynobody. So long as you feel compelled to continue to attack my putting the article up for AfD, I reserve the right to respond. Move on means "it is over, move on". Why are you continuing to harp on the fact that mine is the minority position. I cannot tell you how many times we have seen Smee and other critics to be in the minority position, usually all by themselves, when it comes to inclusion of some bit of non-RS, POV material. I have shown Smee to be in the wrong time and again but you do not see me following him around say "See, you were wrong about those letters to the editor at <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philip_Gale_8b7e.html" title="Philip Gale">Philip Gale</a>; comeon, admit you were wrong, nanny nanny boo boo". I just ask that Smee stop his disruptive edit warring when such disputes arise. As far as you, Anynobody, if you have some actual dispute with me then you may address it on my talk page but only to the degree that we are addressing a dispute. --<a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother</a> 01:48, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm really trying to understand how you could see my disagreement with your assertions as both an attack and me following you to an unrelated page to discuss this. This is a section about the AfD on <strong class="selflink">Talk:Barbara Schwarz</strong>, an article which I was actually editing before this all started. If you truly believe that I am "attacking" you by responding to your comments here, perhaps you are too sensitive to continue editing. I will certainly not be the last person who disagrees with you, and are bound to encounter more "attacks" from editors who do not agree with you. I say this because you've accused me several times of attacking you or someone else, and thus far you have been the only one to make the accusation. If I <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> with you, I have to assume you really feel attacked when disagreed with. If you are "just saying" it then I must ask you to stop, for your own good. Making false accusations is a Petty violation of <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a>, here is a quote:

<dd>Which is also what your comments about the recent AfD being "...a fair hearing and the result was decidedly different." You are implying that both the previous AfDs were unfair and that the decision this time was also. I honestly think you are wrong, and am trying to explain to you why the past votes were fair and that this decision was too. In the three prior discussions over 50 people stated that the article's notability outweighed the possibility of the article being perceived as an attack, if you re-read the keep comments you'll see what I mean. So I cannot agree with your assertion that a "fair" discussion about whether or not the article is notable enough to keep even though it's notability had been deemed enough to override other concerns. <a href="../../../a/n/y/User%7EAnynobody_bd2c.html" title="User:Anynobody">Anynobody</a> 02:54, 22 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I guess the only mystery is why you keep trying to justify the AfD, and I'll be as concise as possible in explaining.
<ol>
<li>You start a discussion on this page suggesting it for AfD because it lacks notability.</li>
<li>I tried to explain to you that notability had been established by the comments in three previous attempts and suggest your view might be hindered by a biased POV.</li>
<li>You say I'm attacking you and ask me not to post on your talk page.</li>
<li>I set up a RfC so others could comment on the issue.</li>
<li>You had an involved admin delete it and set up the AfD arguing the article should be deleted for lack of notability.</li>
<li>The AfD reaffirmed her notability.</li>
<li>You try to explain here that you felt the previous requests and the recent result are unfair.</li>
<li>I responded to your assertion by disagreeing.</li>
<li>You accuse me of stalking and attacking you here.</li>
<li>I explain that a disagreement is not an attack, and that I was editing here first so I couldn't have followed you.</li>
<li>You said you don't understand why I keep writing about it.</li>

<dd>I'm writing about it because you are writing assertions that are untrue about the AfDs conducted here.

I can't let your comments rationalizing why you did what you did go unanswered, especially if they are implying unfairness of the AfDs. <a href="../../../a/n/y/User%7EAnynobody_bd2c.html" title="User:Anynobody">Anynobody</a> 04:41, 22 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>As I said:
<blockquote>
<p>OK, there were mentions of notability in the previous AfDs. But, in my estimation, a true and fair discussion of the issue was overshadowed by the wrong premise nominations and the fact that a better case was not made for deletion. I felt that I could make that better case and I did and a sizable portion of the respondents agreed with me and a number of those that did not agree with me acknowledged that I was justified in bringing the AfD and that I made valid arguments that they just did not happen to agree with. So the AfD is over; and I acknowledged on the closing admin's talk page that the consensus was "Keep". So what. Move on, please. I have.</p>
</blockquote>
and
<blockquote>
<p>As far as you, Anynobody, if you have some actual dispute with me then you may address it on my talk page but only to the degree that we are addressing a dispute.</p>
</blockquote>
There is really no reason for you to continue posting here on this topic, Anynobody, but luckily for me, all I need to do is copy and paste as I have already addressed your issues. --<a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother</a> 11:49, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I can understand why you feel the need to repeat yourself, you don't think the AfD process has been fair. You appear to want that point to made very badly, and it probably seems to you that I am interfering and should not be. If you think that, you would be right about the first part.</p>
<p>Rather than cutting and pasting, I'll do you the courtesy of reminding you about what I've said all along. I think that your point about how unfair the first three AfDs were is based on your inherently biased POV concerning Scientology. When a group of editors reject a call for deletion with remarks like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>*keep totally notable! Brighterorange 14:43, 30 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>in the numbers <a href="../../../s/m/e/User%7ESmee_be9e.html" title="User:Smee">Smee</a> pointed out below, insisting on a separate argument about notability after NOT making any new points makes no logical sense. It does make emotional sense if one considers that the requester has strong positive feelings about an aspect of the article, in your case Scientology.</p>
<p>Whether you personally approve of it or not, Ms. Schwarz's actions have made her a notable subject in American legal history. People who don't care one way or another about Scientology may find themselves looking for information about her legal odyssey. There are also people who will use her against the CoS and ridicule her, which is both unfortunate and wrong. It is also unavoidable, there will always be people who misuse information. We are not supposed to concern ourselves with such people, if we did an article like: <a href="../../../c/a/s/Cases_of_child_sexual_abuse_in_the_Roman_Catholic_Church_55e3.html" title="Cases of child sexual abuse in the Roman Catholic Church">Cases of child sexual abuse in the Roman Catholic Church</a> wouldn't exist. <a href="../../../a/n/y/User%7EAnynobody_bd2c.html" title="User:Anynobody">Anynobody</a> 05:57, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Actually <a href="../../../w/j/h/User%7EWjhonson_d987.html" title="User:Wjhonson">Wjhonson</a> the way I understood the difference of the two terms Paternal and Maternal to break down like this:</p>
<p>Paternal = father's side (Paternal granddaughter = daughter of son of father/mother)</p>
<p>Maternal = mother's side (Maternal granddaughter = daughter of daughter of father/mother)</p>
<p>Removing the entire paragraph seems a bit hasty because if you were right, Ms. Schwarz would be the maternal granddaughter of Dwight D Eisenhower and would require a one word change to correct. <a href="../../../a/n/y/User%7EAnynobody_bd2c.html" title="User:Anynobody">Anynobody</a> 05:42, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Paternal means "of my father". If she were the "paternal granddaughter" of Eisenhower that would mean, that since L Ron is her purported father, that L Ron himself would need to be the son of Eisenhower. I'm sure she does not believe that L Ron is the son of Eisenhower. So it must be that she believes that her mother is the daughter of Eisenhower. <a href="../../../w/j/h/User%7EWjhonson_d987.html" title="User:Wjhonson">Wjhonson</a> 06:54, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Certainly; I am aware of the exception.

It should be noted the Chronology in Archive 10 is part OR as it was compiled from statements extracted from her posts on the Usenet. Please read <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/alt.clearing.technology/msg/3b03276cf712486d" class="external text" title="http://groups.google.com/group/alt.clearing.technology/msg/3b03276cf712486d" rel="nofollow">Part 78</a> and <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/alt.self-improve/msg/199059d4ea2dfdfc?hl=en&amp;" class="external text" title="http://groups.google.com/group/alt.self-improve/msg/199059d4ea2dfdfc?hl=en&amp;" rel="nofollow">Part 30</a> for yourself and this will clarify for you what I mean as "part OR". For example her contention in her published accounts is that her date of birth (as stated) is incorrect, preferring to insist upon the Hubbard relationship and the submarine base delusion, and so on, despite her mother (whom Schwarz claims was not her mother) providing her with letters from a hospital. The <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> account is where she states she remembers being born in the US, and that her German birth certificate is "suspicious" since no place of birth is stated on it, and I believe these claims are reliably sourced in some of the cited court documents. Her search for her "real biography" forms the basis of the FOIA quests. Although the biography and German birth and background she wrote about and wants to deny is the more logical account, there isn't any reliable source to confirm it. It is also difficult to justify putting it into the article when she wrote about her German background and parenthood to say "this is what they tell me, but it's all lies" and basically denies what she was told by her mother was true. (Reading the whole of the 90-plus part series was a laborious task I did some time ago, so please note I am stating here what I remember of it without going through it all again, oh boy).

<p>The infobox says "Spouse: Marty Rathbun[1]" As there is no proof of this other than Barbara's fanciful (according to the US courts) claim, should it be "Spouse: Alleged to be Marty Rathbun" <a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESuper7_252b.html" title="User:Super7">Super 7 - Everything else is just transport</a> 20:33, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>There is a difference between the free-form nature of the article and the limited, structured nature of the infobox. In the article, we can cover Barbara's beliefs appropriately, affirming that yes, she believes them, but that there is no supporting evidence and no one else who has shown any signs of believing these things, and that US courts have deemed the claim "fanciful". We don't have the space to do that in the infobox, however, so I do not think we should list any spouse in the infobox, since we have no generally credibly claimed spouse. I'm also removing the citation next to this claim since the reference in question does not assert that Rathbun is Schwarz's spouse or even that she claims this. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 21:19, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Crockspot, you could try rewording it to be more accurate:
<blockquote>
<p><i>Public records searches failed to confirm Schwarz's <u>assertations about her biographical background</u>, which government officials have characterized as "fanciful".</i></p>
</blockquote>
Perhaps something along those lines may help? With your experience, you might find better wording than in my suggestion above. The original text was changed from the word "claims" to the word "statements", after someone waged war on weasel words (such as the word "claims"). Her biographical claims about the submarine base and being Hubbard's daughter etc are all claims which have no factual basis and are politely described as "fanciful". It is worth noting that <b>nearly all</b> the claims she makes are fanciful and are unsupported by any evidence, e.g. <a href="http://www.ncua.gov/FOIA/Appeals/FOIA-Decisions/01-0140.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.ncua.gov/FOIA/Appeals/FOIA-Decisions/01-0140.htm" rel="nofollow">Schwarz's claims that NCUA employees work secretly for the German Nazi Secret Service by hearing through microchip middle ear implants.</a> <a href="../../../o/r/s/User%7EOrsini_2b01.html" title="User:Orsini">Orsini</a> 03:26, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Crockspot: you are correct; she just said this stuff in her FOIA requests; government employeees scurried to do public records searches as they are required to do under 5 U.S.C. § 552 (the FOIA <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/oip/foia_updates/Vol_XVII_4/page2.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.usdoj.gov/oip/foia_updates/Vol_XVII_4/page2.htm" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>); and when they came back with no result or results conflicting with her delusions, she sued them. Please see "Schwarz v. Federal Bureau, et al, Civil Action No. 00-2758(JDB), United States District Court for The District of Columbia". <a href="http://www.fas.org/sgp/foia/schwarz.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.fas.org/sgp/foia/schwarz.html" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>:
<blockquote>
<p><i>Plaintiff received varying responses from the offices. <b>Generally the response was</b> to ask her to provide privacy waivers from individuals other than herself, and <b>to inform her that the office had no responsive records</b> and that no inquiries or subpoenas had been received from any independent or special counsel.</i></p>
</blockquote>
and
<blockquote>
<p><i>Some offices described the records systems that had been searched, prompting plaintiff to complain that the offices had failed to search other records systems.</i></p>
</blockquote>
Further:
<blockquote>
<p><i>She claims that the offices provided wrong information when they say she has never been of investigatory interest to the FBI and had not been the subject of electronic surveillance. <b>She refuses to accept a response that the office has no such records</b> and than it will not search for records on Mark Rathbun or his parents without a privacy waiver.10 <b>All such responses are attributed to the German Nazi conspiracy.</b> For example, plaintiff asserts that the Pittsburgh office "misinformed Mark Rathbun, his family or their attorneys (sic) or the independent or special counsel having no records on me so that they don't get hold of me as witness and to obstructjustice." Compl. at 20; see also Compl. at 50 (Louisville Field Office, defendant 22). <b>In some instances, a "no records" response provokes an allegation that the office simply did not conduct any search.</b> See, e.g., Compl. at 38 (Phoenix field office, defendant 18) (plaintiff asserts that the requested subpoenas exist and the office is "deliberately withholding them from" her); Compl. at 41 (Cincinnati field office, defendant 19); Compl. at 46-47 (Newark field office, defendant 21).</i></p>
</blockquote>
Finally:
<blockquote>
<p><i>Defendants essentially contend that plaintiff has failed to state a claim on which relief can be granted because <b>her numerous FOIA requests are based on the</b></i> <b><u>fanciful premise</u> <i>that Mark Rathbun is illegally held as part of a Nazi conspiracy. Defendants argue that the allegations that agencies deliberately failed to search for records or purposely concealed records are conclusory and without any "rational facts" to support them.</i></b> <i>Memorandum in Support Of Motion to Dismiss ("Memorandum") at 11. They point out that the agencies conducted legally adequate searches despite plaintiff's objection that many searches were inadequate because the entity did not search every office and every system of records.</i></p>

<li>I've worked through the entire article and improved wording where I thought it needed it. (I didn't verify sources, this was just a readability pass.) The one thing that bothered me was the constant repetition of "she says is her husband" at least a half dozen times, to the point of even replacing his name in a quote with "her alleged husband". It's mentioned in the intro, and the first section. Anyone reading further gets it, and the constant hammering home of the point gave the article an accusatory tone. I also don't think that the word "claim" is unneutral, if used in the proper context. I believe I have used it in a neutral way. Anyway, I was against this article existing, but if we're stuck with it, I figure it should at least be a good read. I hope everyone feels that it's an improvement. <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrockspot_fd90.html" title="User:Crockspot">Crockspot</a> 04:01, 25 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Hi <a href="../../../a/n/y/User%7EAnynobody_bd2c.html" title="User:Anynobody">Anynobody</a>, I replied to you about this issue on my Talk page but it appears there is more to this matter than first thought; it seems the 92 part series (or rather the 91 part series plus the never posted Part 24) is being gradually deleted from Google Groups. It is clear now the sockpuppet was trolling, since the same URL links appear in both the Faxor post and in the post you cite and so the trolling is to let us know she is deleting her posts.

<dd>I agree, it's worth mentioning for a couple of possible reasons. Either she came to her senses, or she was trying to sabotage the article. If it's the former, that'd definitely be worth adding (but doesn't change the fact that her past makes her notable). If she's trying to sabotage the article, all she's done is remove her perspective which itself seems worth noting too. <a href="../../../a/n/y/User%7EAnynobody_bd2c.html" title="User:Anynobody">Anynobody</a> 00:07, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This is a key reason why usenet posts and self-published sources make poor sources. If the posts vanish, we have no choice but to scrub the article of anything that referenced them. Further, to even note the deletion would be original research, unless that observation could be <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">attributed</a> to a reliable third party source. Now maybe it is a little clearer why I supported deletion of this article.

<dd>This is rubbish. The existence of the 92 part autobiographical series on USENET is supported by valid secondary sources. Much of the information in the posts is also confirmed by the newspaper story and by reading the contents of the 90+ court cases that were cited in the article (and on the talk page) at one time before Fred Bauder decided to make the history only available to admins. And in any case, there is no reason to get rid of a source just because one particular Internet link to that source is disappearing. Google does not maintain the sole archive of alt.religion.scientology posts.<a href="../../../v/i/v/User%7EVivaldi_8033.html" title="User:Vivaldi">Vivaldi</a> (<a href="../../../v/i/v/User_talk%7EVivaldi_d6d0.html" title="User talk:Vivaldi">talk</a>) 02:29, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>(I mean nothing against you <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> as your actions were completely correct and there was no context for you to offer this time anyway.)</p>
<p>I realize that this may sound like an obvious question, but my conscience has caused me to want to know. Would an administrator mind digging up some of her more atrocious edits, sanitize any personal information, and post them here? My recent experiences on Wikipedia have taught me that even if the action is correct it can seem cruel to those who don't know what caused her banning in the first place. Were this any other article I wouldn't care, but to a newbie a post like this without context looks disconcerting. [posts from sockpuppet of a banned user removed](I REALLY mean nothing against you <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> as your actions were completely correct and there was no context for you to offer this time anyway.) Say what you want about her mental health; She evidently has access, time, and motivation so we are going to keep hearing from her. (Again <i>I know</i> that the stuff she did was a big no-no so I understand why it's necessary, it'd just seem more open to remind her and us why she has been banned and save ourselves the headache of having to deal with any potential "Crusaders for Schwarz's right to speech!". If they knew what she said in the first place, I doubt people would be that sympathetic. <a href="../../../a/n/y/User%7EAnynobody_bd2c.html" title="User:Anynobody">Anynobody</a> 08:05, 4 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't think that's possible - I believe the edits in question were <a href="../../../o/v/e/WP%7EOVERSIGHT_fcd3.html" title="WP:OVERSIGHT">removed from the database</a> some time ago at the instigation of <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFred_Bauder_e542.html" title="User:Fred Bauder">Fred Bauder</a>, one of the arbitrators.

<dd>I guess that makes sense, can't be too careful with personal info. Still she was uncivil to a lot of editors in the accessible archives, yourself included. Could some of those be possibly sanitized and used as I mentioned (I'm not asking you to do that since I can get those archives, my question is do you think the idea is worth any effort?) <a href="../../../a/n/y/User%7EAnynobody_bd2c.html" title="User:Anynobody">Anynobody</a> 08:54, 4 April 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I submitted a proposal once for a formal redaction system so that in cases of extreme misbehavior as much evidence could be kept visible for public consumption as possible, for maximum transparency. The way it would work is that the unacceptable portions of an edit would be replaced by a formatted placeholder using a <a href="../../../c/h/e/Checksum.html" title="Checksum">checksum</a> of the removed text as a parameter.</dd>
<dd>For instance, suppose that in version 135792468 of a page, ObviousSockPuppet tried to reveal personal information of another editor:
<dl>
<dd><i>Why would anyone listen to RandomEditor, whose real name is John Doe? Call him on his cell, 212-555-1234, and tell him how much you hate him!</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>An admin seeing this edit would go in and pull that page version from the history. The admin would calculate checksum values for "John Doe" and "212-555-1234", and replace those passages in the text to produce something like the following:
<dl>
<dd><i>Why would anyone listen to RandomEditor, whose real name is {{redacted|crc="1A5B64F7"}}? Call him on his cell, {{redacted|crc="5E2305AC"}}, and tell him how much you hate him!</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>The edited page version would then be reinserted into the page history.</dd>
<dd>Using this approach, anyone could look into the page history and see that yes, ObviousSockPuppet did indeed try to reveal another editor's personal information. Those who already know what ObviousSockPuppet tried to reveal can calculate the checksums of the redacted passages themselves and verify indeed that it was not just harmless text that was removed. But those who don't already have the personal information can't get it from the checksum.</dd>
<dd>I still think this is a good idea. Unfortunately, either I submitted it in the wrong place or at the wrong time because I never got any response at all. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 14:20, 4 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This may sound bold, but we should mention her efforts to remove and/or sabotage the article.</p>
<ol>
<li>She has amassed a rather large list of sockpuppets to evade her block.</li>
<li>She deleted her biography in an attempt to sabotage one of the references.</li>
<li>Her behavior is consistent with her abusive behavior elsewhere, as mentioned in the article.</li>
<li>She seems to think we are publishing lies about her, when we've mostly posted what she sued for.</li>
</ol>
<p>It could also perhaps serve as an explanation of why she is blocked. <a href="../../../a/n/y/User%7EAnynobody_bd2c.html" title="User:Anynobody">Anynobody</a> 05:43, 6 April 2007 (UTC)</p>
