<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/r/Barry_Windham_1b60.html" title="Edit section: Early career">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Early career</span></h2>
<p>Barry Windham is largely considered one of the best workers of his time by many true wrestling experts. Much of Barry's early career was in the <a href="../../../f/l/o/Florida.html" title="Florida">Florida</a> region of the NWA where <a href="../../../g/o/r/Gordon_Solie_d748.html" title="Gordon Solie">Gordon Solie</a> was the head announcer. He was a fan favorite for most of the early and middle periods of his career, having great success in singles and tag action. He held tag team championships with <a href="../../../m/i/k/Mike_Rotunda_3852.html" title="Mike Rotunda">Mike Rotunda</a> (collectively known as the <a href="../../../u/s/_/US_Express_eb9e.html" title="US Express">US Express</a>) in both the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Wrestling_Entertainment_4940.html" title="World Wrestling Entertainment">WWF</a> and <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Wrestling_Alliance_182e.html" title="National Wrestling Alliance">NWA</a>. After leaving the WWF in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1985.html" title="1985">1985</a>, he was outspoken in his criticism of the WWF's "Rock and Wrestling" style, which deemphasized traditional wrestling. He joined the NWA and enjoyed success there as one of the top draws on and off for the next decade.</p>
<p>After departing from the WWF, Windham worked an extended stint in Florida, where most notably he wrestled in the main event of Battle of the Belts II for the NWA Title versus Ric Flair, and feuded over the Florida Heavyweight Title with Ron Bass. At this time, Windham also formed an alliance with <a href="../../../l/e/x/Lex_Luger_0f7a.html" title="Lex Luger">Lex Luger</a>, who would turn his back on Windham when they were both in the Crockett branch NWA shortly afterward when Luger had aspirations of joining the Four Horsemen.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/r/Barry_Windham_1b60.html" title="Edit section: NWA career">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">NWA career</span></h2>
<p>In the mid-1980s, he had memorable matches with <a href="../../../r/i/c/Ric_Flair_f8cb.html" title="Ric Flair">"Nature Boy" Ric Flair</a>, which were arguably some of the best matches of all time. These included matches going to 60 minute time limit draws and even some extending beyond an hour of action. In 1987, Barry Windham shifted back to tag team action and won the NWA's United States Tag Team Championship with Ronnie Garvin. Their biggest feud as a team was with The Midnight Express, managed by Jim Cornette. The Midnight Express were never able to beat Windham and Garvin for the titles. Windham and Garvin eventually lost these titles to Ivan Koloff and Dick Murdoch in the spring of 1987, shortly before the annual Jim Crockett Memorial Tag Team Tournament (also known as the Crockett Cup). Rather than enter the tournament as a team, the NWA split up Windham and Garvin. Ronnie Garvin instead teamed up with his stepson Jimmy Garvin (in the storyline of the NWA, they were called the Garvin brothers, but Ronnie was actually Jimmy's stepfather). Windham instead of partnering up with someone in the tournament, was booked to face Ric Flair for the NWA World Championship in what would be another classic match between the two. Flair defeated Windham with a controversial pinfall after a little over 25 minutes of action. From there, Windham continued the rest of 1987 as primarily a singles competitor. Eventually, Barry won the short-lived Western States Heritage Championship that year when a tournament was held for it. He defended this title during the rest of 1987, but it was considered the weakest championship out of the NWA's different titles. At Starrcade '87 in November, Windham challenged Universal Wrestling Federation champion Steve"Dr. Death" Williams but was pinned in defeat.</p>
<p>In 1988, Windham began rising up in the NWA ranks again and was a year of big twists for him. He started off in January 1988 losing the Western States Heritage Championship to Larry Zybysko. In March, he teamed up with Lex Luger to win the NWA World Tag Team Championship from Tully Blanchard and Arn Anderson. A few weeks later, a shocking swerve took place where Windham turned on Luger causing the team to lose the titles back to Blanchard and Anderson <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MSQg4RAaJ4" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MSQg4RAaJ4" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. Windham than joined the Four Horsemen (made up of other members Flair, Blanchard, and Anderson) and the turn as a bad guy was considered shocking at the time. In addition, he began using a black glove as well as the Iron Claw as his finisher, which was a signature move of his father <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Windham_a3b9.html" title="Robert Windham">Blackjack Mulligan</a>. He went back to singles competition and quickly won the NWA United States Championship defeating Nikita Koloff in a tournament for the title when the NWA suspended then champion Dusty Rhodes. Windham became a dominant NWA United States Champion and met Dusty Rhodes in a big match for the title at the Great American Bash in Baltimore on July 10. Old friend Ronnie Garvin interfered in the match on Windham's behalf causing Windham to get the victory and retain the title. Windham continued to be challenged by top opponents for the US title and held the belt until February 1989, losing it in Chicago to Lex Luger.</p>

<p>Windham then returned to the WWF in 1989 as the Widowmaker, but due to outside legal problems involving Barry's father and brother under indictment for counterfeiting, the character did not last long.<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> He left the company to return to WCW a few months later.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/r/Barry_Windham_1b60.html" title="Edit section: WCW career">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">WCW career</span></h2>
<p>In 1990, Barry Windham rejoined the Four Horsemen which at that point consisted of Flair, Arn Anderson, Sid Vicious, and Ole Anderson. He spent most of the time that year in tag team matches with the other Horsemen as partners. At Halloweeen Havoc '90, Windham dressed up as Sting and was involved in a controversial match between Sid Vicious and then NWA World Champion Sting. Sid appeared to pin Sting and win the championship, but it was actually Windham who was dressed like Sting. Once the hoax was noticed, the match was restarted and Sting defeated Sid Vicious. Windham spent the rest of the year teaming with Arn Anderson in the continuation of a feud between the Four Horsemen and then NWA World Tag Team Champions, Doom. At Starrcade '90, Windham and Anderson wrestled Doom to a no contest when a member of each team was pinned.</p>
<p>In 1991, Windham continued teaming with Arn Anderson and also wrestling singles matches. As the middle of the year approached, controversy erupted in the WCW (which the NWA became fully known as from then on) when WCW World Champion Ric Flair was fired by the company causing the title to be vacant. Windham was then elevated to the number 2 contender spot and faced Lex Luger in a cage match to declare the new champion. Windham lost the match to Luger with he and Luger reversing roles as Luger became the top bad guy of WCW and Windham becoming one of the most popular. This got Windham over in terms of popularity with the fans again despite still not winning the world championship.</p>
<p>Windham formed a tag team with <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virgil_Runnels_III_e560.html" title="Virgil Runnels III">Dustin Rhodes</a> and feuded with <a href="../../../a/r/n/Arn_Anderson_28eb.html" title="Arn Anderson">Arn Anderson</a> and <a href="../../../l/a/r/Larry_Zbyszko_b07e.html" title="Larry Zbyszko">Larry Zbyszko</a>, who were the WCW World Tag Team Champions. Anderson and Zbyszko slammed a car door on Windham's hand, breaking it and putting him out of action for awhile. That led to <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Blood_572b.html" title="Richard Blood">Ricky Steamboat</a> stepping in as the mystery partner for Rhodes. Steamboat and Rhodes won the titles. Windham, meanwhile, would come back a couple of months later to feud with Anderson, Zbyszko, and the rest of what was now the <a href="../../../d/a/n/Dangerous_Alliance_5538.html" title="Dangerous Alliance">Dangerous Alliance</a>. Windham would feud with "Stunning" <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stone_Cold_Steve_Austin_9bd5.html" title="Stone Cold Steve Austin">Steve Austin</a> in the spring of 1992, and they traded the World Television Title over the course of a month.</p>
<p>In the fall of 1992 Windham teamed with Dustin Rhodes to defeat Steve Williams and Terry Gordy for the WCW and NWA World Tag Team Titles. They held the belts for about two months before losing them to Steamboat and Shane Douglas in a memorable match at Clash of the Champions XXI. Windham turned on Rhodes after the match when Rhodes refused to pin Steamboat after an accidental low blow.</p>
<p>Windham became a full time singles wrestler in January 1993 and pursued the NWA World Heavyweight Championship held by <a href="../../../k/e/i/Keiji_Mutoh_a05a.html" title="Keiji Mutoh">The Great Muta</a>. He beat Muta for the belt at SuperBrawl III on February 21. Ric Flair, who returned to WCW that night, tried to present Windham with the belt, but when Windham saw it was Flair trying to put the belt around his waist, he took the belt and walked away. Flair and Anderson tried to recruit Windham to join the Horsemen again, but Windham declined and became the "Lone Wolf," feuding with Flair and Anderson. Windham dropped the NWA belt to Flair at Beach Blast '93, then disappeared from wrestling for almost a year, where he took on Flair again at Slamboree '94 for the WCW World Heavyweight Championship. Flair won again and Windham dropped out of sight for over two years.</p>

<p>Windham would again return to the WWF in 1996, this time as The Stalker, wearing camouflage face paint. For a short time, he renewed his feud with Dustin Rhodes, now known as Goldust, only this time, Windham was the face and Rhodes was the heel.</p>
<p>He later formed The New Blackjacks with <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Layfield_edbe.html" title="John Layfield">Justin Hawk Bradshaw</a> in 1997. That team didn't last long, as Barry turned on Bradshaw to join <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jim_Cornette_c874.html" title="Jim Cornette">Jim Cornette</a>'s "NWA faction" in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1998.html" title="1998">1998</a> (at the time, the NWA had become just a group of smaller independent promotions, and they cooperated with the WWF for this storyline). The angle was scrapped months later, and Windham left for WCW again.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/r/Barry_Windham_1b60.html" title="Edit section: Return to WCW">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Return to WCW</span></h2>
<p>In his last <a href="../../../w/c/w/WCW_bd9f.html" title="WCW">WCW</a> run, Barry Windham was originally brought back to WCW by <a href="../../../e/r/i/Eric_Bischoff_83ca.html" title="Eric Bischoff">Eric Bischoff</a> who had him turn on <a href="../../../r/i/c/Ric_Flair_f8cb.html" title="Ric Flair">Ric Flair</a>. Barry was then loosely associated with Bischoff's <a href="../../../n/w/o/NWo_a321.html" title="NWo">nWo Hollywood</a> for awhile before forming a tag team with <a href="../../../c/u/r/Curt_Hennig_11cb.html" title="Curt Hennig">Curt Hennig</a>. Windham, along with Hennig, would capture the WCW World Tag Team Titles from Chris Benoit &amp; Dean Malenko in early 1999.</p>
<p>Barry re-injured his knee during this period but would return as part of The <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Texas_Rednecks_cc06.html" title="West Texas Rednecks">West Texas Rednecks</a> in mid 1999. They were supposed to be a <a href="../../../h/e/e/Heel_%28professional_wrestling%29.html" title="Heel (professional wrestling)">heel</a> group to feud with rapper <a href="../../../m/a/s/Master_P_b0ed.html" title="Master P">Master P</a>'s "No Limit Soldiers" but the southern fans of WCW cheered the Rednecks, going against what WCW management and booking had hoped for, and the angle was eventually dropped. The group consisted of his brother <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kendall_Windham_10b3.html" title="Kendall Windham">Kendall Windham</a>, <a href="../../../c/u/r/Curt_Hennig_11cb.html" title="Curt Hennig">Curt Hennig</a> and <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bobby_Duncum%2C_Jr._c791.html" title="Bobby Duncum, Jr.">Bobby Duncum, Jr.</a>; Duncum was replaced by <a href="../../../m/i/k/Mike_Jones_%28wrestler%29_00de.html" title="Mike Jones (wrestler)">Curly Bill</a> shortly before the group was disbanded and the Rednecks storyline was dropped.</p>

<p>By 2001, photos of a rejuvenated Windham began to surface on the internet of the now defunct Dusty Rhodes' Turnbuckle Championship Wrestling Website. A group of fanatical internet wrestling fans known as "The Barry Windham Revolution" rallied behind Windham and his seemingly miraculous physical comeback. While other competitors might have simply retired, Barry had worked very hard and gotten back down to 236 lb (107 kg) as he had been for much of his early career.</p>
<p>During this time, on the American independent scene in Dusty Rhodes' now defunct Florida-based TCW, Barry won their heavyweight championship and held it for the better part of a year. He also became part of the <a href="../../../x/t/r/Xtreme_Horsemen_df0a.html" title="Xtreme Horsemen">Xtreme Horsemen</a> in stable with <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steve_Corino_f8c2.html" title="Steve Corino">Steve Corino</a> and <a href="../../../c/h/r/Chris_Wright_%28wrestler%29_24e2.html" title="Chris Wright (wrestler)">C.W. Anderson</a>. They feuded with Dusty &amp; Dustin Rhodes.</p>
<p>Barry's last appearances were at MLW's War Games and a one time U.S. Express Reunion with Mike Rotundo at <a href="../../../w/r/e/WrestleReunion_c325.html" title="WrestleReunion">WrestleReunion</a> I.</p>
<p>Barry now resides in Florida and competes infrequently.</p>
<p>In December 2006, it was announced that Barry Windham had signed on as a producer for the WWE.</p>
