<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/r/Barry_Lyons_b149.html" title="Edit section: Early Mets career">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Early Mets career</span></h2>
<p>Lyons was born in <a href="../../../b/i/l/Biloxi%2C_Mississippi_ba37.html" title="Biloxi, Mississippi">Biloxi, Mississippi</a>, graduated from <a href="../../../b/i/l/Biloxi_High_School_4649.html" title="Biloxi High School">Biloxi High School</a> and attended <a href="../../../d/e/l/Delta_State_University_3ecd.html" title="Delta State University">Delta State University</a> where he was an <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Collegiate_Athletic_Association_2404.html" title="National Collegiate Athletic Association">NCAA</a> <a href="../../../a/l/l/All-America_7275.html" title="All-America">All-American</a> catcher. He was taken in the 25<sup>th</sup> round of the 1981 <a href="../../../m/a/j/Major_League_Baseball_Draft_7b74.html" title="Major League Baseball Draft">Major League Baseball Draft</a> by the <a href="../../../d/e/t/Detroit_Tigers_a55b.html" title="Detroit Tigers">Detroit Tigers</a> but didn't sign. He was then taken in the 15<sup>th</sup> round of the 1982 Draft by the Mets and agreed to a contract.</p>
<p>Lyons came up slowly through the Mets' <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minor_league.html" title="Minor league">minor leagues</a> while <a href="../../../b/a/t/Batting_average.html" title="Batting average">batting</a> near or above .300 from 1983 to 1986. As a sign of the Mets' coming years of dominance, Lyons was on minor league teams that won championships at the A, AA and AAA levels. Lyons himself was named the <a href="../../../m/o/s/Most_Valuable_Player_9a8e.html" title="Most Valuable Player">Most Valuable Player</a> of the <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Atlantic_League_ded9.html" title="South Atlantic League">South Atlantic League</a> in 1984. <a href="http://www.barrylyons33.com/about.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.barrylyons33.com/about.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>
<p>Lyons moved one big step down the catching depth chart when the Mets traded for the <a href="../../../m/o/n/Montreal_Expos_1ed2.html" title="Montreal Expos">Montreal Expos</a>' superstar catcher, Gary Carter, before the <a href="../../../1/9/8/1985_in_baseball.html" title="1985 in baseball">1985</a> season. Lyons spent most of the Mets' <a href="../../../1/9/8/1986_World_Series_30ce.html" title="1986 World Series">1986 championship</a> season playing for the AAA <a href="../../../t/i/d/Tidewater_Tides_a5c0.html" title="Tidewater Tides">Tidewater Tides</a> but was brought up to the majors early on. Fellow Tidewater catcher, <a href="../../../e/d/_/Ed_Hearn_787d.html" title="Ed Hearn">Ed Hearn</a>, was also brought up early in 1986 but hit well pushing Lyons down to third-string. Consequently, Lyons only managed to play in six games including two starts — all before July — and never got a hit for the eventual World Champions. (Despite his lack of playing time, Lyons and other rarely-used players eventually received belated World Series rings).</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/r/Barry_Lyons_b149.html" title="Edit section: Fighting for a Mets job">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Fighting for a Mets job</span></h2>
<p>Ed Hearn was traded to the <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kansas_City_Royals_78c3.html" title="Kansas City Royals">Kansas City Royals</a> shortly before the <a href="../../../1/9/8/1987_in_baseball.html" title="1987 in baseball">1987</a> season in a one-sided trade that brought eventual star <a href="../../../p/i/t/Pitcher.html" title="Pitcher">pitcher</a> <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Cone_ec4e.html" title="David Cone">David Cone</a> to the Mets. More importantly for Lyons, the trade gave him sole backup duty and he played in 53 games, batting .254 with 24 <a href="../../../r/u/n/Run_batted_in.html" title="Run batted in">RBI</a> in 1987.</p>
<p>Lyons was back to sharing backup duties in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1988_in_baseball.html" title="1988 in baseball">1988</a> and <a href="../../../1/9/8/1989_in_baseball.html" title="1989 in baseball">1989</a> when the Mets traded for <a href="../../../m/a/c/Mackey_Sasser_838b.html" title="Mackey Sasser">Mackey Sasser</a>. In 1989, the aging Carter missed ten weeks after surgery giving Lyons a shot at starting but Lyons soon injured his foot. Sasser used the opportunity to prove himself as a starter. Despite the missed opportunity, Lyons had career highs of 79 games and 235 <a href="../../../a/t/_/At_bat.html" title="At bat">at bats</a> in 1989 but only managed a .247 average with 27 RBI. It was the only season in which he led the team in games caught.</p>
<p>After 1989, the 35-year-old Carter was released and Lyons was in a two-way battle with Sasser for starting duties. Lyons got most of the starts early in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990_in_baseball.html" title="1990 in baseball">1990</a> but hit terribly. Although he was a solid defensive catcher, Sasser was clearly the better hitter and quickly became the regular starter. While Sasser wound up at .307 for 1990, Lyons' sub-.240 average prompted the Mets to release him in early September and his career was all-but-over at age 30.</p>

<p>Between his release and the end of <a href="../../../1/9/9/1991_in_baseball.html" title="1991 in baseball">1991</a>, Lyons played in only fourteen games at the Major League level for the <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles_Dodgers_bc90.html" title="Los Angeles Dodgers">Los Angeles Dodgers</a> and <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles_Angels_of_Anaheim_8ace.html" title="Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim">California Angels</a>. He spent the next three seasons exclusively in the minors — 1992 with the <a href="../../../h/o/u/Houston_Astros_ddc6.html" title="Houston Astros">Houston Astros</a>, 1993 with the <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Louis_Cardinals_d4bc.html" title="St. Louis Cardinals">St. Louis Cardinals</a> and 1994 with the <a href="../../../c/i/n/Cincinnati_Reds_7554.html" title="Cincinnati Reds">Cincinnati Reds</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/9/1995_in_baseball.html" title="1995 in baseball">1995</a>, Lyons had one last mini-hurrah with the <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago_White_Sox_cecb.html" title="Chicago White Sox">Chicago White Sox</a>. With starting catcher <a href="../../../r/o/n/Ron_Karkovice_bbf7.html" title="Ron Karkovice">Ron Karkovice</a> hitting under .220, 35-year-old backup <a href="../../../m/i/k/Mike_LaValliere_094b.html" title="Mike LaValliere">Mike LaValliere</a> slowing down and the White Sox essentially out of the postseason hunt, Lyons was given a few starts in August and responded with a six-game hitting streak and the third four-RBI game of his career. He continued hitting well and even had the only five-RBI game of his career in late September. Lyons played four more games before the season ended and, despite posting career-highs in average (.266), <a href="../../../s/l/u/Slugging_average.html" title="Slugging average">slugging average</a> (.531) and <a href="../../../h/o/m/Home_run.html" title="Home run">home runs</a> (five), was released by the White Sox in November. He signed with the <a href="../../../t/e/x/Texas_Rangers_%28baseball%29_b4f3.html" title="Texas Rangers (baseball)">Texas Rangers</a> but retired without playing again at age 35.</p>
<p><a name="After_retirement" id="After_retirement"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/r/Barry_Lyons_b149.html" title="Edit section: After retirement">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">After retirement</span></h2>
<p>Instead of playing for the Rangers in 1996, Lyons became a minor league manager for the next three years. He was the manager of the Cincinnati Reds' A-level <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charleston_Alley_Cats_5ca4.html" title="Charleston Alley Cats">Charleston Alley Cats</a> in 1998 when he left the team after being denied a promotion <a href="http://www.cincypost.com/sports/1998/rednot091798.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cincypost.com/sports/1998/rednot091798.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. He then spent three years in <a href="../../../n/a/s/Nashville%2C_Tennessee_0fa5.html" title="Nashville, Tennessee">Nashville, Tennessee</a> broadcasting for the <a href="../../../n/a/s/Nashville_Sounds_7ab6.html" title="Nashville Sounds">Nashville Sounds</a> as well as running a baseball academy.</p>
<p>In 2002, Lyons moved back to his home town of Biloxi and became involved in efforts to bring professional baseball back to Mississippi's coast where no team had played since 1928. In 2004, he was the <a href="../../../g/e/n/General_manager.html" title="General manager">general manager</a> for the inaugural season of the amateur Cotton State League's Biloxi Breeze <a href="http://orig.clarionledger.com/news/0306/05/s02.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://orig.clarionledger.com/news/0306/05/s02.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> <a href="http://www.clarionledger.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20040713/COL0502/407130323" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.clarionledger.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20040713/COL0502/407130323" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>.</p>
<p>Lyons was married in the early 1990s and had a daughter in the late 1990s. He, his family and his father as well as his efforts to bring pro baseball to southern Mississippi were severely rocked by <a href="../../../h/u/r/Hurricane_Katrina_e7df.html" title="Hurricane Katrina">Hurricane Katrina</a>. The storm devastated the Mississippi coast and Lyons' home in 2005. He and his family rode out the storm and lost their house and memorabilia — including his 1986 World Series ring — but all managed to survive. <a href="http://newyork.mets.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/news/article.jsp?ymd=20051222&amp;content_id=1286333&amp;vkey=news_nym&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=nym" class="external autonumber" title="http://newyork.mets.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/news/article.jsp?ymd=20051222&amp;content_id=1286333&amp;vkey=news_nym&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=nym" rel="nofollow">[5]</a></p>
