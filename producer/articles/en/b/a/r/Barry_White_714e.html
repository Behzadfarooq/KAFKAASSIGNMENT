He released 106 <a href="../../../m/u/s/Music_recording_sales_certification.html" title="Music recording sales certification">gold</a> and 41 platinum albums, 20 gold singles and ten platinum singles. All inclusive, record sales of White's music with singles, albums, compilation usage and paid digital downloads as a singer, songwriter and producer now exceed 100 million worldwide.</p>
<p>He created the <b>Love Unlimited Orchestra</b>,which consisted of live musicians, including string and percussion players. Records featuring White's deep <a href="../../../b/a/s/Basso.html" title="Basso">bass</a> voice and suave delivery were used by couples wishing to create a <a href="../../../r/o/m/Romantic_love.html" title="Romantic love">romantic</a> ambience. Considered handsome and deeply romantic by his many female fans and admired for the unique blend of soul and classical orchestral musical elements he created, White was often affectionately referred to as the "<a href="../../../m/a/e/Maestro.html" title="Maestro">Maestro</a>" or "The Man with the Velvet Voice". His portly physical stature led some in the popular press to refer to him as the "Walrus of Love", a monicker not known to have been employed by fans who appreciated the great affection with which White performed for live audiences and who considered him a mainstay among soul music artists throughout his career.</p>

At 17, he was jailed for four months for stealing $30,000 worth of <a href="../../../c/a/d/Cadillac_%28automobile%29.html" title="Cadillac (automobile)">Cadillac</a> tires.</p>
<p>After being jailed, White left gang life and began a musical career at the dawn of the <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960s.html" title="1960s">1960s</a> in singing groups before going out on his own in the middle of the decade. The marginal success he had to that point he was as a songwriter; his songs were recorded by rock singer <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bobby_Fuller_5546.html" title="Bobby Fuller">Bobby Fuller</a> and TV <a href="../../../b/u/b/Bubblegum_pop.html" title="Bubblegum pop">bubblegum</a> act <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Banana_Splits_0edc.html" title="The Banana Splits">The Banana Splits</a>.

<p>In 1969, he got his break backing up three talented singers in a girl group called Love Unlimited. Formed in imitation of the legendary <a href="../../../m/o/t/Motown.html" title="Motown">Motown</a> girl group <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Supremes_adcc.html" title="The Supremes">The Supremes</a>, the group members honed their talents with White for the next two years until they all signed contracts with 20th Century Records. White produced, wrote and arranged the classic soul ballad "Walking in the Rain (With The One I Love)", which hit the Top 20 of the pop charts. The group would score more hits throughout the '70s and White eventually married the lead singer of the group, <a href="../../../g/l/o/Glodean_White_aa82.html" title="Glodean White">Glodean James</a>.</p>

<p>While working on a few demos for a male singer, the record label suggested White step out in front of the microphone, to which he reluctantly agreed. His first solo chart hit, <a href="../../../1/9/7/1973_in_music.html" title="1973 in music">1973</a>'s "I'm Gonna Love You Just a Little More Baby", rose to #1 R&amp;B and #3 Pop. That same year, the Love Unlimited Orchestra's recording of White's composition "<a href="../../../l/o/v/Love%27s_Theme_a409.html" title="Love's Theme">Love's Theme</a>" reached #1 Pop, one of only two recordings ever to do so. Other chart hits by White included "Never, Never Gonna Give You Up" (1973), "Can't Get Enough of Your Love, Babe" (1974), "You're the First, the Last, My Everything" (1974), "What Am I Gonna Do With You" (1975), "Let the Music Play" (1976), "Your Sweetness is My Weakness" (1978), and "Change" (1982).</p>
