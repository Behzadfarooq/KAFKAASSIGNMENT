<p>Switzer is the son of Frank Mays Switzer (b. 1908; d. 1972) and Mary Louise Wood Switzer (b. 1914; d. 1959). Frank Switzer attended the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Arkansas_116b.html" title="University of Arkansas">University of Arkansas</a>, and Mrs. Switzer was the valedictorian of her high school class in Crossett, Arkansas. After spending several years with <a href="../../../b/e/t/Bethlehem_Steel_119e.html" title="Bethlehem Steel">Bethlehem Steel</a> and the <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._Navy_1b88.html" title="U.S. Navy">U.S. Navy</a> during <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a>, Frank Switzer returned to Arkansas in 1945 and attempted to run his father's <a href="../../../f/a/r/Farm.html" title="Farm">farm</a>. Unable to earn a decent living for his family as a farmer or in a number of other businesses, Frank Switzer turned to selling untaxed <a href="../../../l/i/q/Liquor.html" title="Liquor">liquor</a> in a <a href="../../../d/r/y/Dry_county.html" title="Dry county">dry county</a> in <a href="../../../a/r/k/Arkansas.html" title="Arkansas">Arkansas</a>, a "<a href="../../../b/o/o/Bootlegger.html" title="Bootlegger">bootlegger</a>." Frank Switzer ultimately served <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prison.html" title="Prison">prison</a> time on a related conviction that was later overturned.</p>
<p>Frank Switzer was known as progressive in seeking fair treatment for <a href="../../../a/f/r/African-Americans_ce19.html" title="African-Americans">African-Americans</a> in South Arkansas in the 1940s and 1950s. In addition to operating a small <a href="../../../l/o/a/Loan.html" title="Loan">loan</a> business with the African-American community at a time when no <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bank.html" title="Bank">bank</a> would do business with them, Frank Switzer paid the <a href="../../../c/o/l/College.html" title="College">college</a> <a href="../../../t/u/i/Tuition.html" title="Tuition">tuition</a> for numerous African-American young people in an attempt to provide greater opportunities, and made certain certain that his young sons, Barry and Donald, had African-American playmates.</p>

He played <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_football_positions.html" title="American football positions">center and linebacker</a> for two years under Head Coach <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_Mitchell_1b1e.html" title="Jack Mitchell">Jack Mitchell</a> and two years under Head Coach <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frank_Broyles_7613.html" title="Frank Broyles">Frank Broyles</a>, completing his eligibility following the 1959 season. After graduation, he did a brief stint in the <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._Army_6c52.html" title="U.S. Army">U.S. Army</a> and then returned to Arkansas as an <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assistant_coach.html" title="Assistant coach">assistant coach</a>. He worked in that capacity on the Razorbacks' <a href="../../../1/9/6/1964.html" title="1964">1964</a> <a href="../../../n/c/a/NCAA_Division_I-A_national_football_championship_f5c0.html" title="NCAA Division I-A national football championship">National Championship</a> team (whose players included <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimmy_Johnson_%28American_football_coach%29_018c.html" title="Jimmy Johnson (American football coach)">Jimmy Johnson</a>, <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jerry_Jones_4a52.html" title="Jerry Jones">Jerry Jones</a> and <a href="../../../k/e/n/Ken_Hatfield_7df2.html" title="Ken Hatfield">Ken Hatfield</a>).</p>
<p>Following the 1966 season, Switzer moved to the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Oklahoma_0676.html" title="University of Oklahoma">University of Oklahoma</a> as an assistant coach under new Head Coach and good friend <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jim_Mackenzie_5647.html" title="Jim Mackenzie">Jim Mackenzie</a>, who died of a heart attack following spring practice of 1967.

He is often credited by Sooner fans and other major college coaches as having "perfected" the <a href="../../../w/i/s/Wishbone_formation.html" title="Wishbone formation">wishbone offense</a>.</p>
<p>When Fairbanks accepted the position of Head Coach of the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_England_Patriots_d9e3.html" title="New England Patriots">New England Patriots</a> following the 1972 season, Switzer was the choice to succeed him.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/r/Barry_Switzer_ba27.html" title="Edit section: Head Coach, University of Oklahoma">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Head Coach, University of Oklahoma</span></h3>
<p>Switzer became head coach at Oklahoma in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1973_in_sports.html" title="1973 in sports">1973</a>, leading the team to undefeated seasons that year and the next. The 1973 squad went 10-0-1, and was recognized as national champions by Billingsley, Dunkel, and Sagarin. Although 1973 was unusual in that 5 teams were recognized as some form of national champs, <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alabama.html" title="Alabama">Alabama</a>(UPI) and <a href="../../../n/o/t/Notre_Dame_Fighting_Irish_football_010f.html" title="Notre Dame Fighting Irish football">Notre Dame</a>(AP) were the most agreed upon kings of college football that season. Things were more clear-cut in 1974 as the <a href="../../../1/9/7/1974_Oklahoma_Sooners_football_team_fede.html" title="1974 Oklahoma Sooners football team">Sooners</a> went 11-0 and shared the national championship with <a href="../../../u/s/c/USC_Trojans_football_61d4.html" title="USC Trojans football">USC</a>. They were outright national champions in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1975_Oklahoma_Sooners_football_team_aad2.html" title="1975 Oklahoma Sooners football team">1975</a>, winning 11 games against just one defeat. Because of the lesser amount of influence the aforementioned polls that declared Oklahoma champs in 1973, the university does not claim a national title for 1973, thus meaning they did not achieve the elusive three-peat. Regardless, Switzer's Sooners were a national force in the 1970s as his teams won or shared the Big Eight Conference title every year between 1973 and <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980.html" title="1980">1980</a>. Another highwater mark came in 1978 as running back <a href="../../../b/i/l/Billy_Sims_e48b.html" title="Billy Sims">Billy Sims</a> won the most prestigious award in college football, the <a href="../../../h/e/i/Heisman_Trophy_cdcb.html" title="Heisman Trophy">Heisman Trophy</a>. Oklahoma also played for another national championship in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1977_in_sports.html" title="1977 in sports">1977</a>, but lost in the January 1978 Orange Bowl to Arkansas.</p>
<p>Oklahoma slumped slightly in the early <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980s.html" title="1980s">1980s</a>, but rebounded with another conference title in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1984_in_sports.html" title="1984 in sports">1984</a>. They won the national championship the next year in the <a href="../../../1/9/8/1985_Oklahoma_Sooners_football_team_e018.html" title="1985 Oklahoma Sooners football team">1985</a> season, going 11-1 and defeating top-ranked <a href="../../../p/e/n/Pennsylvania_State_University_be4e.html" title="Pennsylvania State University">Penn State</a> in the 1986 <a href="../../../o/r/a/Orange_Bowl_%28game%29_6e6b.html" title="Orange Bowl (game)">Orange Bowl</a>. The next two years, they posted the same record but finished ranked third in the final polls both seasons.</p>
<p>Switzer was a "lightning rod" for controversy. While he was frequently accused of lax discipline, his players and associates note that he was one of the first coaches in major college football to allow his players to show off their individual personalities, e.g., allowing All-American <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brian_Bosworth_6831.html" title="Brian Bosworth">Brian Bosworth</a> to "paint" his hair to grab attention and market himself to the public and the NFL, and quarterback Thomas Lott to wear a bandana under his helmet, which many took as an affront to the dignity of the game. Switzer knew, however, that Lott wore the bandana to keep his <a href="../../../a/f/r/Afro.html" title="Afro">Afro</a> from being imprinted by the inside of the football helmet.</p>
<p>Switzer was among the first major college coaches in America to recruit and allow African-American athletes to play any position on the team. It was perhaps because of his background and his comfort in the African-American culture learned as a youth, that made him, to his coaching competitors who were mostly "old school" and not comfortable in that culture, the most feared recruiter in America. He was a candid public speaker and often said things in jest that caused difficulty when they appeared in the media. A significant example came once when Switzer answered a question from an audience at the Southern Hills Country Club in Tulsa as to why his teams seemed (at that time) to regularly beat those of University of Texas Coach Darrell Royal. His answer, although Switzer loves Country music, was, "Darrell would recruit better if he quit hanging around with those guitar pickers." Royal was incensed, and it was apparently the beginning of a lasting hatred of Switzer by Royal and many other coaches and members of the media.</p>

<p>His team of the 1988-1989 school year was racked by scandal and placed on NCAA probation. In a whirlwind series of events after the 1988 season, on February 13, 1989, Charles Thompson, the starting quarterback, Stephen Wyatt, a local drug dealer, and John Beebe, a local drug dealer were arrested for Illegal distribution of CDS, a Felony in Oklahoma. Wyatt and Beebe were tried and found innocent due to an illegal search and seizure, Thompson plead guilty and served two years in prison. He made the February cover of Sports Illustrated in orange prison garb. Switzer was held by many in the public and almost all of the media as responsible. Switzer responded to this charge, sagely, by saying that he never knew he had to instruct his players not to commit criminal acts. Switzer survived the media and public discontent, but he could not survive the ire of a temporary University President and a new Board of Regents who in late May of 1989 threatened to fire him, not for the earlier incidents but for false charges that he had been involved in unrelated criminal activity (pushing the limits of local Bingo parlor laws). Many similar incidents of such activity by players have occurred in years since at other major universities, but Switzer was the only coach to be personally accused of being responsible for criminal actions of players. He actually resigned on June 19, 1989. In a team meeting with his players after the arrests had stopped, he asked his players if he had messed up by giving certain players "second chances." To a man, all of the players told him and the media he was not responsible. Several players stood up and said that they were glad that they had been given a second chance.</p>
<p>Switzer left Oklahoma with a career record of 157-29-4. His winning percentage of .837 is fourth-best all-time, and he posted remarkable records against several famous contemporaries, going 3-0-1 against <a href="../../../d/a/r/Darrell_Royal_5705.html" title="Darrell Royal">Darrell Royal</a>, 12-5 against <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tom_Osborne_%28football_coach%29_a02f.html" title="Tom Osborne (football coach)">Tom Osborne</a>, 5-3 against <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimmy_Johnson_%28American_football_coach%29_018c.html" title="Jimmy Johnson (American football coach)">Jimmy Johnson</a>, 2-0 against <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bobby_Bowden_f871.html" title="Bobby Bowden">Bobby Bowden</a> and 1-0 against <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joe_Paterno_b1ef.html" title="Joe Paterno">Joe Paterno</a>, <a href="../../../b/o/_/Bo_Schembechler_0872.html" title="Bo Schembechler">Bo Schembechler</a> and <a href="../../../w/o/o/Woody_Hayes_63b4.html" title="Woody Hayes">Woody Hayes</a>. He was, however, 0-3 against Johnson when Johnson coached the Miami Hurricanes. The losses to Johnson's Hurricanes were Switzer's only defeats from 1985 to 1987, a span in which Switzer's Sooners were 33-0 against all other teams they played.</p>

<p>Barry Switzer resurfaced in coaching in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1994.html" title="1994">1994</a> with the <a href="../../../d/a/l/Dallas_Cowboys_c876.html" title="Dallas Cowboys">Dallas Cowboys</a>, replacing former player and longtime rival Jimmy Johnson on a team now owned by former player and longtime friend and <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Arkansas_116b.html" title="University of Arkansas">University of Arkansas</a> team-mate Jerry Jones. Switzer was successful with the Cowboys, going 13-6 his first season and 15-4 in his second, when Dallas won <a href="../../../s/u/p/Super_Bowl_XXX_55e4.html" title="Super Bowl XXX">Super Bowl XXX</a> over the <a href="../../../p/i/t/Pittsburgh_Steelers_bedf.html" title="Pittsburgh Steelers">Pittsburgh Steelers</a>, 27-17. Many would cite the next NFL season as a "litmus test" to determine Switzer's actual coaching ability, as the Cowboys would undergo much flux in the offseason. Other experts cite the declining fortunes of the team as being more directly related to free agency and salary caps (which caused a diffusion of talent) and the fact that owner Jerry Jones spent enormous sums of money on a very few "super" players and neglected to leave enough money to re-sign their good veteran players.</p>
<p>Switzer and Jones were unable to halt the team's decline from age and free agency following the Super Bowl, and Switzer was again accused of lax discipline by some of his players, most notably quarterback <a href="../../../t/r/o/Troy_Aikman_e800.html" title="Troy Aikman">Troy Aikman</a>. The Cowboys won their division in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1996.html" title="1996">1996</a>, but had a losing season (6-10) the next year (the first losing season in Switzer's career). Switzer resigned as Cowboys' coach with a 45-26 career NFL coaching record, after being asked by owner Jerry Jones to remain.</p>

<p>The University of Oklahoma maintained some distance from Coach Switzer for many years after he left. This changed in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1998.html" title="1998">1998</a>, when current Sooner head coach <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Stoops_d616.html" title="Bob Stoops">Bob Stoops</a> was hired and sought to restore the program's ties to its successful past. Switzer now maintains a close relationship with the Sooner football program.</p>
<p>In 1990, Switzer released his best-selling autobiography, "Bootlegger's Boy," written with Bud Shrake with a foreword by <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joe_Paterno_b1ef.html" title="Joe Paterno">Joe Paterno</a>. Switzer was elected to the <a href="../../../c/o/l/College_Football_Hall_of_Fame_85e4.html" title="College Football Hall of Fame">College Football Hall of Fame</a> in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002.html" title="2002">2002</a>. In <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>, he received the <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jim_Thorpe_Lifetime_Achievement_Award_ba6f.html" title="Jim Thorpe Lifetime Achievement Award">Jim Thorpe Lifetime Achievement Award</a>.</p>
<p>In 2006, Switzer announced his support for former rival <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tom_Osborne_%28Nebraska%29_54cc.html" title="Tom Osborne (Nebraska)">Tom Osborne</a>'s campaign for <a href="../../../g/o/v/Governor.html" title="Governor">Governor</a> of <a href="../../../n/e/b/Nebraska.html" title="Nebraska">Nebraska</a>.</p>
<p>Switzer still resides in <a href="../../../n/o/r/Norman%2C_Oklahoma_4f38.html" title="Norman, Oklahoma">Norman, Oklahoma</a>, not far from the University, and in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2001.html" title="2001">2001</a>, married longtime girlfriend Becky Buwick, the former head <a href="../../../g/y/m/Gymnastics.html" title="Gymnastics">gymnastics</a> coach at OU.</p>
<p>Switzer served as a pregame analyst for Fox television's coverage of the 2007 <a href="../../../f/i/e/Fiesta_Bowl_75b3.html" title="Fiesta Bowl">Fiesta Bowl</a>, along with former rival and fellow ex-Cowboy head coach <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimmy_Johnson_%28American_football_coach%29_018c.html" title="Jimmy Johnson (American football coach)">Jimmy Johnson</a> .</p>
