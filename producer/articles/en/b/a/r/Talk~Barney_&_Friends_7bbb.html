<p>The crticism section is very biased in favor of the show. The few criticisms, which are vaguely and briefly mentioned, are quickly rebuted and disregarded. Also, many valid criticisms such as the shows puported encouragement of conformity, lack of individuality of the characters, one sided messages, etc. are not mentioned. Positive aspects of the show should be discussed separatley from the criticisms. Retep412</p>

<dd>Then find some sourced criticism. There's a lot of complaints about the show so it shouldn't be hard to find some real information from a reputable source. <a href="../../../c/a/m/User%7ECambridgeBayWeather_aa30.html" title="User:CambridgeBayWeather">CambridgeBayWeather</a> <a href="../../../c/a/m/User_talk%7ECambridgeBayWeather_e92a.html" title="User talk:CambridgeBayWeather">(Talk)</a> 22:38, 12 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>A quick search on-line turned up a report by the Indiana Department of Education that discusses the negative aspects of the show. For example, "The court also noted legitimate criticism of Barney–“that his shows do not assist children in learning to deal with negative feelings and emotions.” According to one critic, 'Barney offers our children a one-dimensional world where everyone must be happy and everything must be resolved right away."</dd>

<dd>Almost but not quite. They are reporting on a court case, "Lyons Partnership v. Ted Giannoulas", which does not state who the critic was nor if the quotes were taken out of context. It would be good to see where the court got it's criticism from. <a href="../../../c/a/m/User%7ECambridgeBayWeather_aa30.html" title="User:CambridgeBayWeather">CambridgeBayWeather</a> <a href="../../../c/a/m/User_talk%7ECambridgeBayWeather_e92a.html" title="User talk:CambridgeBayWeather">(Talk)</a> 17:25, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I agree with the merge proposal. The show is called Barney &amp; <i>Friends</i>, it would make sense to merge the articles about the friends. Anthopos 21:38, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I proposed a merge on the <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barney.html" title="Barney">Barney</a> discussion page, because that page is nearly identical in content to this one and even the vandalism is frequently duplicated between the two entries. I just have no idea how to formally propose or begin the procedure for getting a merge of the two articles. 24.218.222.86 15:51, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>this sounds questionable, can someone provide a news-link for this claim:</p>
<p>"After the Iraq war of 2003, American interrogators reportedly used Barney's theme song, "I Love You," to break the resistance of high-ranking Iraqi captives, playing the tune over and over to disorient and demoralize the prisoners."</p>
<p>i read the link <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/Iraq/Story/0,2763,959538,00.html" class="external text" title="http://www.guardian.co.uk/Iraq/Story/0,2763,959538,00.html" rel="nofollow">article</a>, and it says that "i love you" was used to train american operatives not to torure iraqis...</p>
<p>quote from article:</p>
<p>"Trust me, it works," a US "operative" told Newsweek magazine.</p>
<p>"In training, they forced me to listen to the Barney I Love You song for 45 minutes. I never want to go through that again."</p>
<p>the article talks about use of Heavy Metal, not Barney to break will of the prisoners.</p>

<p>This article has been vandalised continuously for more than a month. The edits here mainly consists of blanking (which is vandalism) or reverting vandalism.

<dd>I disagree. The vandalism is so slow that it's not really a problem. The main vandalism comes from one or two users and I already blocked one for a week.

<dd>We need it now more than ever. Since I reverted the funding vandalism, there were 19 edits, most of them were vandalism attempts by anonymous users.

<pre>
Barney was created in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1987.html" title="1987">1987</a> by <a href="../../../s/h/e/Sheryl_Leach_7469.html" title="Sheryl Leach">Sheryl Leach</a> of <a href="../../../d/a/l/Dallas%2C_Texas_2045.html" title="Dallas, Texas">Dallas</a>, <a href="../../../t/e/x/Texas.html" title="Texas">Texas</a>. She came 
</pre>
<p>up with the idea for the program while considering TV shows that she felt would be educational and appeal to her son. Leach then brought together a team who created a series of home videos, <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barney_and_the_Backyard_Gang_a301.html" title="Barney and the Backyard Gang">Barney and the Backyard Gang</a>, which also starred actress <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sandy_Duncan_45ef.html" title="Sandy Duncan">Sandy Duncan</a> in the first 3 videos.

<p>Think of it this way. Barney teaches us to love and trust everyone. Someday a person may say "Want to go in my car for a ride and go to Chuckie Chesses" they could kidnapp them and murder them. They could also say "Want to have sex with me" since the child may not know what sex is they may not know it's bad the kid would get raped. That's why some pepole don't like barney for a real reason.<a href="../../../e/d/d/User%7EEddy643_6cb9.html" title="User:Eddy643">Eddy643</a> 13:31, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>"one particular episode made use of the phrase, "A stranger is a friend you have not met yet", which some parents may view as sending a dangerous message to their children."</p>
<p>"[peer pressure] encourages children to suppress outward signs of unhappiness rather than deal openly with their feelings, which has been shown to have dangerous effects on their development.'</p>

<p>I just removed everything uncited with a fact tag as well as one section that had a cite, but the cite had nothing to do with the statement it was supposed to be sourcing.

<p>I don't think it's banned in the Philippines unless it's been banned within the last 2 years I wasn't there. As far as I know, they show Barney a lot in RPN Channel 9 (much to my dismay, seeing that I prefer Sesame Street). Sukotsuto 10:55, 09 January 2007 (PST)</p>

For starters this is <a href="../../../w/e/a/WP%7EWEASEL_bba5.html" title="WP:WEASEL">weasel wording</a>.

<p>I recently heard of an incident that supposedly resulted in legal action against the show involving a television with an image appearing to be a demon. (It was created by someone moving in front of the screen.) I can't find anything on it myself, but I was wondering if anyone else had any information on it? My resource is just a neighbor who has lied about things before, but I always like to look things up before I call someones' bluff... If it's true, though, stuff like that should probably be in a Wiki. (KyrieSanctus 06:14, 8 February 2007 (UTC))</p>
