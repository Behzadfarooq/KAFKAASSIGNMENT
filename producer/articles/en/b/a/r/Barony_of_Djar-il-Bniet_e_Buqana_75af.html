The Fort St Angelo was known by Aragonese rulers as <i>Castello a Mare</i>, "the castle by the sea"</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The 1st Baron of Djar-il-Bniet, Cicco Gatto (died 1372) was governor of the <i>Castello a Mare</i> (<a href="../../../f/o/r/Fort_St_Angelo_43dc.html" title="Fort St Angelo">Fort St Angelo</a>) in 1350. He is credited with quelling a rebellion on the island of <a href="../../../g/o/z/Gozo.html" title="Gozo">Gozo</a> and inducing the inhabitants to submit to the House of <a href="../../../a/r/a/Aragon.html" title="Aragon">Aragon</a>. The fief of Djar-il-Bniet fell after the extinction of the Bava family during the reign of King <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louis_of_Sicily_c520.html" title="Louis of Sicily">Louis of Sicily</a> and was conferred on Cicco Gatto and his heirs. Louis also granted Gatto’s son Francesco Lanza and his heirs exemption from payment of dues to the Royal Court, placing them on equal footing with the citizens of <a href="../../../m/e/s/Messina.html" title="Messina">Messina</a>. Following Lanza's death, his son Francesco succeeded the title on <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_14.html" title="February 14">February 14</a>, <a href="../../../1/3/9/1397.html" title="1397">1397</a>, and was invested by <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martin_I_of_Sicily_0f4d.html" title="Martin I of Sicily">Martin I of Sicily</a>. The 2nd Baron was Lanza Gatto, who was a chief justice of Malta and Regio Proposito. Baron Cicco’s other son Francesco Gatto, the 3rd Baron married an heiress of the Barony of Buqana in 1387. The Barony of Buqana was given to governor Guglielmo Murina in 1372 by King <a href="../../../f/r/e/Frederick_III_the_Simple_b7d0.html" title="Frederick III the Simple">Frederick III</a>. Guglielmo's daughter married Manfredo, a member of the noble <a href="../../../s/i/c/Sicily.html" title="Sicily">Sicilian</a> family of de Castelli. Their daughter Paola married Baron Francesco Gatto, and they became the parents of Imperia, the wife of Antonio Inguanez.</p>
<p>The 3rd Baron Francesco Gatto (d. 1442) received the lordships of Hemsija and <a href="../../../%C5%BC/a/b/%C5%BBabbar.html" title="Żabbar">Żabbar</a> from <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martin_I_of_Sicily_0f4d.html" title="Martin I of Sicily">Martin I of Sicily</a> in 1397 was appointed governor of Malta and also Regio Proposito in 1403. He died in 1442 and was succeeded by his daughter Imperia Gatto who married the <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spain.html" title="Spain">Spanish</a> Baron Antonio Inguanez, a close relative to the royal Aragona family of Sicily. Baron Antonio Inguanez inherited the titles of Baron di Ghariexem, Signor di Saccaja, Mugiarro and <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Giorgio_2cbe.html" title="San Giorgio">San Giorgio</a>. Antonio and Imperia produced not only descendants to most Maltese, Sicilian, Roman, Neapolitian Nobility, but also royalty in Western Europe such as <a href="../../../q/u/e/Queen_Paola_of_Belgium_c494.html" title="Queen Paola of Belgium">Queen Paola of Belgium</a>, the Orleans-Bourbons, and <a href="../../../a/u/s/Austria-Este_a285.html" title="Austria-Este">Austria-Este</a>.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Prior to settling in Malta the Inguanez had been a powerful noble family in <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catalonia.html" title="Catalonia">Catalonia</a>, where its members held high offices and possessed the fief of Ortigos. Angeraldo Inguanez (d. 1403) accompanied by his son Antonio, who subsequently became the husband of <a href="../../../i/m/p/Imperia_Gatto_eafc.html" title="Imperia Gatto">Imperia Gatto</a>. Angeraldo was governor of Malta and Gozo for three years before handing the governorship to his friend Francesco Gatto on October 16, 1403. Before his death, Angeraldo also intrusted Francesco Gatto with the guardianship of his only son Antonio. The orphan Antonio married his guardian's daughter Imperia Gatto, whose dowry included a house in the town of Notabile, with several <a href="../../../f/i/e/Fief.html" title="Fief">fiefs</a> and other properties. Antonio Inguanez accompanied King <a href="../../../a/l/f/Alfonso.html" title="Alfonso">Alfonso</a> of Sicily in the siege of <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barbary.html" title="Barbary">Barbary</a> and was appointed <a href="../../../d/e/s/Despotic.html" title="Despotic">despotic</a> governor of Malta and Gozo, as successor to his father-in-law Francesco Gatto. Their governorship became almost hereditary, being mortgaged to him and to his son by King Alfonso in <a href="../../../1/4/3/1437.html" title="1437">1437</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/4/3/1432.html" title="1432">1432</a> King Alfonso visited Malta on his triumphant return from <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barbary.html" title="Barbary">Barbary</a> and was the guest of Francesco Gatto and Antonio Inguanez at the family house in Mdina (which is still in the possession of their descendants). As a reward for his services during the war in Barbary, the estate and garden of Saccajja near <a href="../../../m/d/i/Mdina.html" title="Mdina">Mdina</a>, was confirmed to Antonio on <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_25.html" title="October 25">October 25</a>, <a href="../../../1/4/4/1442.html" title="1442">1442</a>. The united arms of Gatto and Inguanez were placed over the <a href="../../../f/o/r/Fort_St_Angelo_43dc.html" title="Fort St Angelo">Fort St Angelo</a> by King Alfonso, Francesco Gatto and Antonio Inguanez. Antonio Inguanez was very devout, and founded four <a href="../../../b/e/n/Benefice.html" title="Benefice">benefices</a> which exist today. He and Imperia had many children which caused a great division of his properties. He died in 1458, after which his son acquired the fiefs of Djar il Bniet, Buqana, and Budaq. Antonio’s son <a href="../../../a/n/g/Angeraldo_Gatto_Inguanez_a0a7.html" title="Angeraldo Gatto Inguanez">Angeraldo Gatto Inguanez</a> was <i>consigliere regio</i> in 1439 and governor of Malta in 1469. Nothing more is know of him except that he married and had a son named <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antonio_Angeraldo_Inguanez_cdde.html" title="Antonio Angeraldo Inguanez">Antonio Angeraldo Inguanez</a>, who received his investiture from <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palermo.html" title="Palermo">Palermo</a> in 1472.

<p>King <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_V_25cb.html" title="Charles V">Charles V</a> sent an authoritative letter to the Grand Master of the <a href="../../../k/n/i/Knights_Hospitaller_38b8.html" title="Knights Hospitaller">Knights Hospitaller</a> giving Giacomo Angeraldo Inguanez and his kindred permission to sell their property and fiefs if they wished to leave Malta.

Antonio's second son of Marco Inguanez, succeeded his brother in 1589 and sold the estates of Budaq.

<p>Alessandro's brother Marco took advantage of his absence, and owing to the uncertainty respecting his existence, usurped the Baronies in 1608, and held them until his death in <a href="../../../1/6/1/1612.html" title="1612">1612</a>.</p>

<p>Baron Alessandro Inguanez, the eldest son of Baron Inguanez, was denounced before the local Tribunal on several charges of <a href="../../../h/e/r/Heresy.html" title="Heresy">heresy</a> in 1608. The case was particularly interesting since the title of Baron of Djar-il-Bniet e Buqana legally belonged to the accused, but his father had nominated Alessandro's brother as heir, perhaps in view of the circumstances of the case. In 1606, at the age of eighteen, Alessandro embarked on a <a href="../../../p/r/i/Privateer.html" title="Privateer">privateer</a> on a <a href="../../../l/e/v/Levant.html" title="Levant">Levant</a> expedition. About eight months later he disembarked near <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexandretta.html" title="Alexandretta">Alexandretta</a> and was captured by some fifteen <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkic_peoples.html" title="Turkic peoples">Turks</a>. He became a slave in the home of Bascia de Rey, where, after nearly two months, he converted to <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam.html" title="Islam">Islam</a> with the help, so he claimed, of three hundred <i><a href="../../../b/a/s/Bastinado.html" title="Bastinado">bastinado</a></i>. Morato (Alessandro's assumed Muslim name) managed to escape and boarded a <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flanders.html" title="Flanders">Flemish</a> vessel in harbour, but he was recaptured when the Turks threatened to burn the ship. He was nearly executed, but was given another chance to repent. After serving his master faithfully, Morato was adopted by Bascia de Rey and married a Muslim woman named Fatima. But apparently, he still felt an alien in the Muslim environment and eventually escaped with the aid of two missionaries and a French consul.</p>
<p>Back in Malta, Alessandro was denounced and brought before the <a href="../../../i/n/q/Inquisition.html" title="Inquisition">Inquisition</a>. In spite of his belonging to one of the principal local families, he was charged with having apostatized and practiced the Muslim religion. It was only the special circumstances of the case that enabled Inguanez to receive a mid penalty. He was fined 30 <a href="../../../s/c/u/Scudi.html" title="Scudi">scudi</a>, had to confess and receive <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communion.html" title="Communion">communion</a> at least six times annually, and was made to fast every Friday on bread and water while reciting the <a href="../../../p/s/a/Psalms.html" title="Psalms">psalms</a>.</p>

<p>The line of Inguanez became extinct with the death of the 14th Baron Marc’Antonio who died childless after two marriages. His brother Francesco, was born illegitimate by his father and an heiress of the Ghariexem ( junior branch of the Inguanez family). The decree of the fief of Djar-il-Bniet in 1351 carried the right of hereditary succession, provided that the heirs were legitimate descendants to avoid illegal possession of feudal lands. <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archdeacon.html" title="Archdeacon">Archdeacon</a> Lancia Inguanez who had inherited <a href="../../../g/h/a/Ghariexem_e_Tabia_5fb5.html" title="Ghariexem e Tabia">Ghariexem e Tabia</a> from his father, granted the fief to his illegitimate son Antonio.</p>
<p>On December 25, 1760 Baron Inguanez died without issue and illegally nominated his cousin Gio Francesco d’Amico as successor. The legality of this nomination was contestable, since these fiefs were bequeathed to the Inguanez family by Francesco Gatto who stipulated that if the main branch of this family became extinct, his estate would pass first to his nearest descendants then to the church. To strengthen their claim Gio Francesco d’Amico immediately adopted the Inguanez surname. However, the Grand Master reclaimed the fiefs and instructed his <i>secreto</i> Count Preziosi and the Uditori, to inquire into the claim of d’Amico-Inguanez. The heirs of Francesco Inguanez protested that it was their inheritance, not some distant cousin such as the d’Amicos. (The d’Amicos were illegitimate descendants of a lady from Sicilian nobility). The present claimant is Principe <a href="../../../g/i/u/Giuseppe_Said_fcef.html" title="Giuseppe Said">Giuseppe Said</a> (1949-, De Jure "27th" Baron di Djar-il-Bniet e Buqana). The Grand Master considered granting the natural descendants succession but it ended up becoming a personal choice as per will of Lancia Gatto.</p>
<p>The Grand Master granted the d’Amico-Inguanez family succession to the ancient titles, but the descendants of the 13th Baron continued to style themselves <a href="../../../d/e/_/De_jure.html" title="De jure">De jure</a> Baron and Baroness di Djar-il-Bniet without hindrances from the d’Amico descendants. Legend has it that a supporter of the Tanti-Inguanez placed a spell on the title holders of Djar-il-Bniet e Buqana who were descendants of the d’Amico family, making them unable to produce heirs legitimately.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>Though the source of this “spell” became known, as many died unmarried or childless. Upon hearing about these rumored spells the Grand Master realised his mistake, but died before he could change his decision. Francesco dei Baroni Ingunaez was unsuccessful in claiming the estates, which went to his distant cousin, Gio Francesco d’Amico, who succeeded as the 15th Baron and <i>Capitano della Verga</i> (c1764-75). Gio Francesco had one son who died unmarried in 1782. The estate then passed to the previous holder’s uncle who assumed the <a href="../../../s/u/r/Surname.html" title="Surname">surname</a> Inguanez and married into the Bonici family who held the Barony of <a href="../../../g/h/a/Ghariexem_e_Tabia_5fb5.html" title="Ghariexem e Tabia">Ghariexem e Tabia</a>.</p>

<p>Their eldest son, Vincenzo d’Amico-Inguanez, succeeded as the 18th Baron, and died unmarried in 1850 and was succeeded by his sister Maria Teresa, who also died unmarried in 1880.

In 1983, the title was resurrected by the next living heir, Dr. Carmelo Apap-Bologna Sceberras d’Amico-Inguanez as the premier title holder of Malta and 23rd Baron. The present Baron is a descendant of the 17th Baron of <a href="../../../d/j/a/Djar-il-Bniet_3c88.html" title="Djar-il-Bniet">Djar-il-Bniet</a>, and third cousin twice removed to Frances Chesney. He is a member of the marquisate of the <a href="../../../g/n/i/Gnien-is-Sultan_3d86.html" title="Gnien-is-Sultan">Gnien-is-Sultan</a> family and is related to most of the <a href="../../../m/a/l/Maltese_Nobility_baaf.html" title="Maltese Nobility">Maltese Nobility</a>. He attempted to gain <a href="../../../g/h/a/Ghariexem_e_Tabia_5fb5.html" title="Ghariexem e Tabia">Ghariexem e Tabia</a> from a distant ancestor, who he suggested was senior heiress to the actual successor. After extensive research, it was discovered in the will of the late Baron that the titles would be split between two daughters with no recourse as each received extensive estates in Malta and Sicily. Baron Carmelo’s claim was denied as it was biased to the descendants of the Barony of Ghariexem e Tabia, and although he was heir to both Djar il-Bniet and Castel Cicciano, Castel Cicciano went to another branch. The Sicilian title of <a href="../../../m/o/n/Montagna_di_Marzo_2838.html" title="Montagna di Marzo">Montagna di Marzo</a> went to the next male descendant of the Sceberras family, who still carries the title. Baron Carmelo has two sons and two daughters who will carry the Baronies on to another generation securing it within the Apap-Bologna family as the jewel of Malta.</p>
