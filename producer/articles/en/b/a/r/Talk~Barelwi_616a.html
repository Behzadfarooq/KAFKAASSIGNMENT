<ul>
<li><b>Merge</b>, but merge TO this article. Most of the English-language works that mention Barelwis use this spelling; Brelvi is a close second.

<li>This page includes less facts about Barelwies and more <a href="../../../w/a/h/Wahhabi.html" title="Wahhabi">Wahhabi</a> propoganda. It is full of POV by Wahhabies. While the Fatwa by Barelwies against Wahhabies is shown as their bigotry, the fatwa of Wahhabies against them is shown as some kind of a fact. The main disagreement between Wahhabies and Barelwies is celebration of Maulood and my news link of Wahhabi suicide bomber killing Barewlies celebrating maulood is removed by a Wahhabi editor.<a href="../../../h/a/s/User%7EHassanfarooqi_1cb2.html" title="User:Hassanfarooqi">Hassanfarooqi</a> 19:14, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Defence of peacful schools of thought against Wahhabi jihad continues. Quote from Allama Shami's Radd-ul-Mukhtar about the first Wahhabi wave, "The state of the followers of Ibn Abdul Wahhab was like this, they rose from Nejd and attacked our holy cities Mecca and Medina in Hejaz. They killed everyone who did not confirm to Ibn Abdul Wahhab. Then Allah send the Armies of Muslims to push them back to Nejd". Rest assured it seems until oil runs dry in Saudi Arabia, the second wave of violent Wahhabi jihad against peaceful muslims would continue.<a href="../../../h/a/s/User%7EHassanfarooqi_1cb2.html" title="User:Hassanfarooqi">Hassanfarooqi</a> 01:54, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

For what it's worth, I think <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItaqallah_7a9f.html" title="User:Itaqallah">User:Itaqallah</a>'s version is more NPOV as it clearly states what each side thinks of the other. The links need classification though. Right now, it's an amorphous mass of pro and anti sites.--<a href="../../../n/k/v/User%7ENkv_e00c.html" title="User:Nkv">Nkv</a> 17:15, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The article is still full of Wahhabi POV and anti-Barelwi propoganda. It has very little secular information for the readers about the Barelwi movement. Watch out for the POV words like "Self Proclaimed".</p>

<p>Do you see much words in the article "Wahhabism"?</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>In spirit, yes. "The Wahhabis claim to hold to the way of the Salaf as-Salih, the pious predecessors..." which is self proclamation. Perhaps it's more mildly worded.--<a href="../../../n/k/v/User%7ENkv_e00c.html" title="User:Nkv">Nkv</a> 19:33, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>No way, all reference that I made about Wahhabies coming into power with the help of British was removed without giving any reason. Those references were from western pro Arab historians/biographers like <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Holden_befe.html" title="David Holden">David Holden</a>. See his book "The House of Saud".</p>

<p>I am not talking about anti-Wahhabies like Stephen Schwartz or Pipes. Also watch quotation marks around words blasphemous when quoting Barelwis. These quotes do not appear around words coming from Wahhabies.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I see quotes around the work Shirk in the Wahabi page. But really, I think you're overreacting. Let's separate concerns. I can't stand Wahabi ideology one bit but in the interest of keeping wikipedia accurate, let's just state everyones views as accurately as possible (using the talk pages to resolve disputes) and leave it at that rather than accusing people of editorial slant. --<a href="../../../n/k/v/User%7ENkv_e00c.html" title="User:Nkv">Nkv</a> 19:33, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I tell you man, Wahhabies are brain washed to not tolerate any Non-Wahhabi. They can not be secular. It is against their very basic training.170.35.208.22 13:14, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>No "religious" person can be "secular". I expect the wahabi minded editors on wikipedia to defend their points of view on all articles and I expect the non wahabis (traditional sunni muslims if you prefer) to defend theirs. There will be a little ruckus and then things will settle down to something which both parties (perhaps grudgingly agree upon). --<a href="../../../n/k/v/User%7ENkv_e00c.html" title="User:Nkv">Nkv</a> 19:33, 11 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I agree with what you have said so far except this one. I have been with people of many religions and found their intellectuals are always secular in research e.g. Jehovah's witness are very very fundamentalist Christians. However their research about Islam is very secular as printed in their paper. Their conclusion is not secular ofcourse. Then you can read "Christian Science Monitor" which is also a very fundamentalist organization's paper. You can not point a finger on their secular research. Again, their POV appears seperately. I am a staunch fundamentalist Muslim (fundamentalist meaning sticking to fundamentals as foundation and building over it, not sticking to fundamentals and destroy all construction over it). However I am certified in studies of Old Testament and the new Testaments and have done a lot of faith sharing to form my own knowledge about Jews and Christians, not what the Mullah told me when I was a kid.<a href="../../../h/a/s/User%7EHassanfarooqi_1cb2.html" title="User:Hassanfarooqi">Hassanfarooqi</a> 19:48, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>With respect to <i>this</i> article, can you list down all the items which you think compromise it's NPOV? We'll then work on them one by one and try to come up with a neutral and good article.

<p>Here is a perfect example. You have categorized AFSA people as Barelvies. It is because you consider all non-Wahhabies as Barelvies. AFSA people are by no means Barelvies. Shaikh Hasham probable can not even tell where in the world Bareli is!<a href="../../../h/a/s/User%7EHassanfarooqi_1cb2.html" title="User:Hassanfarooqi">Hassanfarooqi</a> 15:35, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
