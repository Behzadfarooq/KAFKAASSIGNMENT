<p>Ditto J.smith - I have been challenged about the odd deletion (see my talk - its very few given how many I have done) and have only once reverted a restoration (right at the beginning of the exercise and I wouldn't have done it now). The vast majority of my deletions have been uncontroversial removal of blatant copyvios or otherwise well within the terms of EL as well as C. Frankly, I'm fed up with constantly being accused of doing something I'm not. If I was blanket removing links I would have finished weeks ago. Its hard work going through all the dross to find the occasional worthwhile content but I'm doing this because of the concerns raised at EL - so I have already moderated my behaviour because on consensus. Unless you want to make issue with anything I have done, I suggest you leave me to get on with a boring unpleasnat job that is a) in full agreement with policy b) reflecting the consensus because I have accepted that the links need to be reviewed and considered on their individual merits and c) clearly misunderstood because noone actually seems to want to follow what I am actually doing. I'm not going to stop because of an RFC that is completely unrelated to my activities - especially as I agree with the main thrust and am working on that basis. I'm very disappointed with the ignorance shown by those opposing my editing and I think a lot of people need to stop opposing for the sake of it and trying to understand what we are about before commenting adversly. --<a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESpartaz_f576.html" title="User:Spartaz">Spartaz</a> 18:54, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No. Please direct your ire to actions that I have taken personally. I became involved after participating in a discussion on AN.

<dd>There appears to be consensus for what I'm doing. The author of the RFC accepts that links must be reviewed and blatant copyvios removed. Why don't you review the small collection of examples to be found from the link at the bottom of my talk page. --<a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESpartaz_f576.html" title="User:Spartaz">Spartaz</a> 21:01, 22 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Its a home movie showing some blokes kid. Do you really believe we should be linking that?????? An edited version without the child would be fine but not this. <a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESpartaz_f576.html" title="User:Spartaz">Spartaz</a> 22:08, 22 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Why do you keep pestering me? We clearly do not agree (and I'm not arguing copyright here - its clearly a non-commercial video). I just stating that I don't think a video that shows someones child is a suitable link. I'm sorry you don't agree and frankly I'm getting tired of being nagged about it. If you don't agree with my actions revert me. I'm not the slightest bit worried if you want to go through the deletions and check them all yourself. Sure I'm bound to have made mistakes but at least I'm trying to do something constructive instead of constantly critizing other editors. Whats your prefered option? Leaving thousands of copyvios on the site while we argue about a policy for marginal links that don't really add content one way or another? Frankly the whole thing would be a lot less effort if some of the people complaining actually dug in and gave us a hand sorting this lot out. You do the deletions - I will have less to do and you will have less to whine about. I'm currently on R do you fancy S? Doesn't that sound like a good deal? Oh, and the list of deleted links is a sample not a "best of" so no I'm not asserting that this is one of my better decisions. --<a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESpartaz_f576.html" title="User:Spartaz">Spartaz</a> 23:40, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>No, honestly, <i>any</i> content can be removed by any editor who gives a credible reason, and we assume good faith, and we don't put it back without addressing the good-faith reasons expressed. Why would <i>any</i> type of content be different? Seriously? If a long-standing contributor has a problem with something, it makes sense to sit and think about it, not immediately start a revert war. Especially where they are an admin and may be fixing up something which is actually a problem for the project. There is no deadline, and the onus has always been on those seeking to include, to justify inclusion. I'm not aware of any exceptions to that consensus if the content in question is links. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 21:37, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The moment it become acceptable to go around telling people to "F*** off" is the moment we can declare Wikipedia dead. I'm confused why you are defending a blatant insulting personal attack.

I do not expect, and should not be expected to, accept abuse and insults.</dd>
<dd>Going in and changing a guideline in a near 180 turn on what it originally said without consensus support is very much disruptive behaviour. As is giving someone your word you have not been active on a problematic issue, when you have.</dd>
<dd>I don't appreciate either JzG's or DmcDevit's handling of this Youtube issue which has amounted to unilateral action without recourse to consensus discussion. I think it reflects very badly on them, and would prefer them to instead sit down and discuss it in a clam consensus lead manner. --<a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarberio_8f89.html" title="User:Barberio">Barberio</a> 12:24, 2 January 2007 (UTC)

<p>In looking over JzG's talk page and related pages, I can see that tensions are running really high. I'd like to ask you to try to remain calm when editing, and not to participate in others' arguments because you're already watching his talk page. Calling another editor a "dick" wasn't cool, but since you're already involved in a dispute with him the warning doesn't carry much impact. If you feel there's a serious problem that needs intervention, you can go to <a href="../../../p/a/i/WP%7EPAIN_2701.html" title="WP:PAIN">WP:PAIN</a> for administrator assistance involving personal attacks--that way, a neutral third-party can investigate the claims.

<p>Barberio, I suggest you take Hipocrite's advice and walk away. Experienced Wikipedia admins are allowed to break any rule they want, as long as they are not attacking each other or the project itself. See <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a>. That's just the way it is here, and the powers that be want it that way. This is not a complaint, it's just reality. I've learned the same lesson, the hard way - I fought back on several occasions and I was labelled as a troll and "argumentative". So the best approach is to just let it go and move on. Wikipedia is not a democracy. Good luck. <a href="../../../a/t/r/User%7EATren_6e1d.html" title="User:ATren">ATren</a> 20:42, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Do you think it might be useful to note something like "Notable precedents in discussion" in general for EL, as has been done with abortion article? (Some disputes crop up regularly on abortion, and when they do, editors can refer those not familiar with the dispute to check the archives. There's also a notice to check the archives for "Notable precedents in discussion" before editing/reviving an issue, to make sure it hasn't already been addressed at great length, so editors can be sure they are adding something new to the discussion.) Just a thought. "You Tube discussions here" doesn't tell us there have been notable precedents in discussion, etc? Also, it seems there are other issues besides You Tube which crop up regularly.-<a href="../../../c/i/n/User%7ECindery_01fc.html" title="User:Cindery">Cindery</a> 20:38, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, Barberio! I decided to contact you here so we can thrash out this whole complex of pages and issues without cluttering up the talk page at the dab project too much. I hope you don't mind. Do you see where I'm coming from? Am I overlooking some really simple option for handling this? (I have a tendency to do that sometimes.) I really do want to help straighten this out, but without being able to use CorHomo (the dab tool I like) or even popups, it's so tedious to dab links. Neither will work unless the base page is a proper dab page.

<dd>I've turned <a href="../../../e/n/a/Enabling_Act_39b1.html" title="Enabling Act">Enabling Act</a> into a simple disambig page the tool can work on, and once finished you can turn it back into a redirect. This can be done with all the redirects, and then finaly with <a href="../../../e/n/a/Enabling_act.html" title="Enabling act">Enabling act</a> by placing a temporary disambig template there , processing it, then removing the template.</dd>
<dd>There's no real reason that CorHomo should only work on disambig pages, since it's also useful in repairing links to the wrong page.

<p>Barberio, I've seen your name a few times and I was saddened by your decision to leave Wikipedia <i>indefinitely</i>. By this, I really hope you mean that you are going to "chill" for a time - a time which is not decided in advance. I'm also having difficulty with some individuals in the Wiki community. Fortunately, I don't think any of them are admins (yet) but the bullying certainly introduces a lot of stress in my life, which I seriously can do without. Let me just suggest something - take it or leave it, as you see fit. Part of what makes Wikipedia work is consensus building. That comes easier if you have a group of friends. I myself have been tempted to try to make contact with people for that purpose, but until now, I've just let it go. What I'm trying to say is that maybe we should just stick together. At the opening of every club meeting, we can work on setting to music the quote popularly attributed to either Mark Twain or Robert Heinlein, "Never try to teach a pig to sing. It's frustrating for you, and it annoys the pig." Chill for a while, and when you feel up to it, drop me a line. <a href="../../../c/b/d/User%7ECbdorsett_98d9.html" title="User:Cbdorsett">Cbdorsett</a> 06:20, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

And Radiant, please comment on the issue, not the user. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <small><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">Talk</a></small> 14:00, 2 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>Steve, my comments were that he was "doing good work on improving the blocking policy".

<li>No, it was the form shopping statement at <a href="../../../n/o/t/WT%7ENOT_d1b4.html" title="WT:NOT">WT:NOT</a> that I had in mind. Suggestions should stand or fall on their merits.

<p>Thanks for uploading <b><a href="../../../s/p/a/Image%7ESpace-cadets.png_fbd9.html" title="Image:Space-cadets.png">Image:Space-cadets.png</a></b>. The image description page currently specifies that the image is non-free and may only be used on Wikipedia under a <a href="../../../f/u/_/WP%7EFU_03b9.html" title="WP:FU">claim of fair use</a>. However, the image is currently <a href="../../../o/_/_/WP%7EO_c91c.html" title="WP:O">orphaned</a>, meaning that it is not used in any articles on Wikipedia.

<p>If you have uploaded other unlicensed media, please check whether they're used in any articles or not.
