<p>The Simpsons serve as church ushers one Sunday morning. <a href="../../../b/a/r/Bart_Simpson_19e2.html" title="Bart Simpson">Bart</a> uses the opportunity to switch the intended <a href="../../../h/y/m/Hymn.html" title="Hymn">hymn</a> with a song called "In the Garden of Eden" by "I. Ron Butterfly"; actually, the song is <a href="../../../i/r/o/Iron_Butterfly_d13b.html" title="Iron Butterfly">Iron Butterfly</a>'s "<a href="../../../i/n/-/In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida_%28song%29_93ee.html" title="In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida (song)">In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida</a>". <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_recurring_characters_from_The_Simpsons_08fd.html#Lovejoy_Family" title="List of recurring characters from The Simpsons">Rev. Lovejoy</a> initially fails to notice anything amiss (or the lewd behavior of congregants) but he eventually catches on, noting "This sounds like <a href="../../../r/o/c/Rock_and_roll.html" title="Rock and roll">rock and/or roll</a>". At the end of the 17-minute song, the exhausted organist collapses on the <a href="../../../p/i/p/Pipe_organ.html" title="Pipe organ">organ</a>.</p>
<p>An angry Rev. Lovejoy assembles the children into his office and demands that the culprit identify himself. When <a href="../../../m/i/l/Milhouse_Van_Houten_ac8b.html" title="Milhouse Van Houten">Milhouse</a> sees a <a href="../../../c/r/o/Crow.html" title="Crow">crow</a> squawk at him menacingly, he immediately rats out Bart. As punishment for his <a href="../../../p/r/a/Practical_joke.html" title="Practical joke">prank</a>, Bart is told to clean the organ pipes ... and for being "snitchy", Milhouse is forced to help Bart. Bart blames Milhouse for snitching on him, and when Milhouse says he feared crows pecking at his <a href="../../../s/o/u/Soul.html" title="Soul">soul</a> for <a href="../../../e/t/e/Eternity.html" title="Eternity">eternity</a> if he didn't tell, Bart scoffs at the very notion of having a soul, saying there is no such thing. Milhouse calls his bluff, and tells Bart he'd like to buy it (in the form of a piece of paper saying "Bart Simpson's soul") for <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_dollar_db5c.html" title="United States dollar">$</a>5. He then proceeds to say "Thanks, chum....p.</p>
<p>Lisa tells Bart that he will regret selling his soul, but Bart is still disbelieving. Soon, however, <a href="../../../s/a/n/Santa%27s_Little_Helper_520b.html" title="Santa's Little Helper">Santa's Little Helper</a> won't play with him, automatic doors fail to open for him, and when he blows on the freezer doors at the <a href="../../../k/w/i/Kwik-E-Mart_aeb9.html" title="Kwik-E-Mart">Kwik-E-Mart</a>, no <a href="../../../c/o/n/Condensation.html" title="Condensation">condensation</a> forms. Also, he finds <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Itchy_%26_Scratchy_Show_5495.html" title="The Itchy &amp; Scratchy Show">Itchy &amp; Scratchy</a></i> <a href="../../../c/a/r/Cartoon.html" title="Cartoon">cartoons</a> to no longer be funny (actually he still knows they're funny but he simply can't laugh any longer), to which Lisa quotes "laughter is the language of the soul". Bart begins to suspect he really <i>did</i> lose his soul, and sets out to get it back.</p>
<p>He finds Milhouse playing maniacally with the piece of paper. Bart makes several offers to buy back his "soul", but Milhouse refuses each time and jacks up the price. That night, Bart has a <a href="../../../n/i/g/Nightmare.html" title="Nightmare">nightmare</a> about being the only child in <a href="../../../s/p/r/Springfield_%28The_Simpsons%29_365b.html" title="Springfield (The Simpsons)">Springfield</a> to not have a soul, and is mocked as a result. Lisa also taunts Bart with a dinnertime <a href="../../../p/r/a/Prayer.html" title="Prayer">prayer</a>, leading him to make a desperate, all-out attempt to get the piece of paper back.</p>
<p>In desperation, Bart makes a late-night attempt to retrieve his soul, having to travel across town where Milhouse and his parents are staying with his grandmother. However, the 2 a.m. visit is in vain; Milhouse had traded it to the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comic_Book_Guy_e1e5.html" title="Comic Book Guy">Comic Book Guy</a> for <i><a href="../../../a/l/f/ALF_%28TV_series%29_f21d.html" title="ALF (TV series)">Alf</a></i> <a href="../../../p/o/g/Pogs.html" title="Pogs">pogs</a>. A frustrated Bart camps the rest of the night in front of the Android's Dungeon to get his soul back.</p>
<p>In the morning, an annoyed Comic Book Guy tells Bart that he does not have said piece of paper anymore, refuses to disclose who he sold it to and tells him to go home. A despondent Bart walks home in the rain, and in his room dejectedly prays to <a href="../../../g/o/d/God.html" title="God">God</a> for his soul. Then, floating down from above is a piece of paper, with the words "Bart Simpson's soul." Lisa had purchased the piece of paper, and while explaining philosophers' opinions on the human soul, Bart maniacally eats it up. That night, he rests easy with the pets curled at his feet, and has a dream about his soul helping him get even with <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martin_Prince_295d.html" title="Martin Prince">Martin</a> and his soul.</p>
<p>In the subplot, <a href="../../../m/o/e/Moe_Szyslak_c98b.html" title="Moe Szyslak">Moe</a> wants to expand his customer base by turning his <a href="../../../b/a/r/Bar_%28establishment%29.html" title="Bar (establishment)">tavern</a> into a <a href="../../../f/a/m/Family_restaurant.html" title="Family restaurant">family restaurant</a> called Uncle Moe's Family Feedbag, styled a la <a href="../../../t/2E/g/T.G.I._Friday%27s_fa44.html" title="T.G.I.

The <a href="../../../g/i/m/Gimmick.html" title="Gimmick">gimmick</a>: If he doesn't smile when he hands a customer his check, the meal is free.</p>
<p>Moe's surly demeanor and the <a href="../../../s/t/r/Stress.html" title="Stress">stress</a> of running a family restaurant by himself ultimately unnerve him, and it isn't long before he finally snaps at a little girl (who complains that her ice-cold <a href="../../../s/o/f/Soft_drink.html" title="Soft drink">soft drink</a> causes pain in her mouth). The restaurant is a resounding failure, forcing Moe to revert the restaurant back into his run-down tavern.</p>

<ul>
<li>During the song, in crowd shot of the church Jasper's beard is the same color as his skin, rather than white.</li>
<li>The song originally intended for the opening scene was <a href="../../../l/e/d/Led_Zeppelin_cf85.html" title="Led Zeppelin">Led Zeppelin's</a> "<a href="../../../s/t/a/Stairway_to_Heaven_14f0.html" title="Stairway to Heaven">Stairway to Heaven</a>"<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup>.</li>
<li>The idea of selling someone's soul is taken from <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greg_Daniels_216c.html" title="Greg Daniels">Greg Daniels</a> childhood, When he encouraged a bully who picked on him, to sell his soul for 50 cents, Daniels then got everyone else to tell the bully that Daniels could own him forever he came to Daniels crying one night asking for it back, so he jacked up the price and the bully got his soul back. He also did this many more times as it was a good way to make money, he stopped it when he realized that the Devil made a living just the same way, and that scared him.<sup id="_ref-comDaniels_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-comDaniels" title="">[1]</a></sup></li>
<li>Bart comments on how there is no such thing as the soul, and claims that it was something that grown-ups made up to scare children. "Like the Boogeyman, or Michael Jackson." Incidently, it was Michael Jackson who produced and written the song, "Do the Bartman."</li>
<li>As Mrs. Feesch plays "In the Garden of Eden" in church, a caption appears, to indicate a passage of time, that reads "Seventeen minutes later." That song actually does run seveteen minutes.</li>
