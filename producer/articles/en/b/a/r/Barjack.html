A map depicting the extent of Barjack territorial control in the Western Region.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The Barjack have for five years been conducting operations against the Tipharean ground forces, including ambushing caravans, attacking the Factory Railroad, and even taking over Factory Farms, such as Factory Farm 21, which has been under their control for two years. The extent of their control includes 14 out of 29 Factory Farms in the Western Region as they draw closer to Tiphares. The Barjack also control remote areas of ruins that serve as bases for their units, such as the Boiling Metal Battalion, and demarcate their territory boundaries with gruesome markers. Despite the length of their war with Tiphares, not much is known about the Barjack in the Scrapyard. After Vector fails to negotiate a deal with Den to protect his interests and is released on the condition that he warn the Scrapyard so that its citizens can evacuate before Tiphares falls, he is pressured by the Factory into keeping quiet about the Barjack, leaving the Scrapyard unaware that the Barjack are closing in.</p>
<p>The prime means of destroying Tiphares for the Barjack lies in the construction of the giant 80 cm <a href="../../../r/a/i/Railway_gun.html" title="Railway gun">railway gun</a> Heng, and the climax of five years’ of fighting arrives when the Heng is brought to bear against Tiphares. After it fails to destroy Tiphares and is demolished by the Abaddon, Den orders his generals to disband their units and switch over to guerilla warfare in order to attack the Factory from inside the Scrapyard. Den then charges the Scrapyard alone in a last ditch attempt to bring down Tiphares, managing to bring his sword down on one of the Factory tubes before dying. While having proved effective against the Tipharean ground forces, the deployment of 11 <a href="../../../a/l/i/Alita.html#TUNED_AR_Series_.28Alita_Replicas.29" title="Alita">TUNED AR units</a> against them leaves the fate of the remaining Barjack forces uncertain. Years later, the Barjack story is told in a book of B.B. Buick’s photographs compiled by Koyomi when she is 15 titled <i>Barjack War Chronicle</i>, which becomes the Scrapyard’s greatest bestseller on record.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/r/Barjack.html" title="Edit section: Den">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Den</span></h3>
<p>The founder and leader of the Barjack, Den as he appears is actually a remote-controlled slave unit run from a transmitter embedded in Kaos’ chest. Called a figment of his psyche by Kaos, Den describes himself as the child of Kaos’ uncontrollable rage, which had been within Kaos since he was a child. Whenever this rage manifested itself, Kaos became homicidal, but he had no memories of what happened to him when this part of his psyche takes over. Normally dormant within Kaos, when he is 15 or 16 it suddenly bursts forth, resulting in the near death of his father Desty Nova and his assistant Bazarld, and making Nova aware of it for the first time. Nova installs an EPR transmitter into Kaos’ heart and nervous system and creates a slave body for Den, making him independent of Kaos’ body. Despite this, the death of Kaos can mean the death for both of them. Because of his connection to Kaos, the knowledge of Alita gained from Kaos’ psychometric ability is passed on to Den, who targets Alita because of her role as a TUNED agent, and fights her because of her willingness to protect the Scrapyard. The day after fighting her, Den manifests himself in Kaos’ physical body, revealing himself to Alita and attempting to kill her. Alita’s refusal to kill Kaos and thus him as well leaves him puzzled. Ruthless towards his enemies, Den displays empathy and compassion for his troops, who address him as “Master Den” or “Lord Den.”</p>
<p>When the slave unit is created by Nova, it is man-sized. Den goes into the badlands in order to find himself and train as a warrior. He discovers his purpose in finding a suitable body to contain his rage, to rule the desert, and to bring Tiphares to the ground. Den firmly believes that Tiphares is the source of the surface dwellers' pain and misery, and that anyone associated with Tiphares, the Factory, or the Scrapyard is corrupted and not fit to exist in the new order that he plans to create. When he appears as leader of the Barjack, Den’s body is many times its original size, being large enough to fight the equally massive coliseum champion Vanado. This is the only time in his massive form that Den’s lower body is that of a man’s instead of a horse, which appears to be his combat body. Den wields a giant katana, Zanshato, but is also armed with a yari and equipped with a shield on his left arm when in his centaur form. In this form, Den’s body is a formidable weapon, heavily armored and able to crush anything in his way. Den also proves that his massive size is not a handicap in fighting a much faster and smaller opponent when he duels Alita, as he is a master of controlling his chi and even his kizashi or superchi, enabling him to predict Alita’s moves even though she manages to blind him. Den’s body is not indestructible though, as Alita nearly kills him during their fight with a solenoid quench gun. He speeds up the timetable of the Barjack campaigns to control more territory closer to the Scrapyard and Tiphares after the connection between him and Kaos is revealed to Alita. After the Heng is destroyed and Den orders his generals to switch over to guerilla warfare, he charges the Scrapyard in a last attempt to attack Tiphares. The Factory ground forces inflict fatal wounds, blowing off his right arm and the latter half of his centaur body. Den manages to bring Zanshato down on one of the Factory tubes, but the katana breaks and the tube is undamaged. He then succumbs to his wounds. His fallen head is treated as a deity by some Scrapyard residents prior to the self-destruction of Melchizedek.</p>
<p>When Kaos tries to rescue Alita from Desty Nova's Ouroboros program, he appears in one of Alita's dreams as Den, who then battles the giant Great Martian King dream robot, which is controlled by Nova.</p>
<p>Den means "The," or "It" in German.</p>

<p>Koyomi joined the Barjack for a brief, two week period following Alita's duel with Den, befriending B.B. Buick and participating in the battles to gain ground closer to the Scrapyard and Tiphares. She survived the destruction of the Heng and received Buick's camera before he died. After Den disbands the Barjack, Koyomi volunteers to accompany him on his charge on the Scrapyard.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/r/Barjack.html" title="Edit section: Knucklehead">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Knucklehead</span></h3>
<p>A former bandit, Knucklehead joined the Barjack not because he believed in its cause, but for the opportunities it would give him to fire his gun and ride his motorcycle, all he claims he needs in life. His face serves as a protective covering for his brain, and can be detached when damaged. Becoming a squad commander, Knucklehead ambushes Factory Train 12, on which Alita is aboard as a Tuned agent along with Figure Four and Yolg, who are serving as rail mercenaries. The only member of his squad to survive Alita’s counterattack, his head is taken by her for interrogation, but gets lost in a desert tornado that Alita and her companions get caught in. Knucklehead is recovered by the Barjack’s Boiling Metal battalion and restored to a cyborg body. Begging Col. Bozzle for the chance to avenge his decimated squad, he is given a platoon of socket soldiers, but is unaware that he is being used as decoy. Once again, Alita wipes out Knucklehead’s party, but the timely intervention of the rest of the battalion saves his life. However, he is humiliated and demoted, seething with resentment at his treatment and hatred for Alita.</p>
<p>Knucklehead makes his move 48 hours after Alita has lost contact with the GIB and the Boiling Metal is camped for the night while on its way to attack Factory Farm 22. Shooting Col. Bozzle, he kidnaps Alita, insuring the battalion’s inability to take action against him by sabotaging their guns, the socket soldiers, and blowing up their vehicles. Taking Alita to a sand dune, he gives her her Damascus Blade and arms himself with a single shot 28 mm pistol for a duel. Before they can carry it out however, Figure intervenes, attacking and killing Knucklehead. Knucklehead was also shown as one of the soldiers interviewed by Buick.</p>

<p>A “special prisoner,” Buick has been with the Barjack for three years, recording their story through photographs and interviews. He claimed to be a Scrapyard reporter when captured, but was actually a murderer who targeted women and photographed their mutilated bodies. The sale of some of these photos placed a bounty on his head, forcing him to flee the Scrapyard. Buick’s time with the Barjack makes him start to believe in their cause and hope that he can change, but after witnessing Alita’s duel with Den, he falls in love with her and his innermost desires begin to resurface. These burst forth when the GIB destroys the Heng with Tiphares’ superweapon Abaddon and AR-10 starts to kill the survivors. Glorifying in the death and destruction, Buick records what he can, mistaking AR-10 from Alita. He loses his mind, asking AR-10 for an interview as she is about to shoot Koyomi. Shot with an armor-piercing round, Buick’s intervention gives Fury enough time to grab AR-10 by the neck and throw her into a pool of molten metal. He turns over his camera to Koyomi, which has 200,000 photos of Barjack’s battles and campaigns before dying of his wounds. The photos are later compiled by Koyomi when she is 15 into a book titled Barjack War Chronicle and packaged with an audio recording of an interview with Den, becoming the Scrapyard’s greatest bestseller on record.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/r/Barjack.html" title="Edit section: Colonel Bozzle">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Colonel Bozzle</span></h3>
<p>A former member of the Green Beret Tribe and commander of a mercenary squad, Bozzle was defeated in battle by the Barjack two years prior and decided to join them, becoming a convert to Den’s mission to bring down Tiphares. He rose to battalion commander and leads the Boiling Metal, Barjack’s most powerful battalion, based in a former city in the desert near the Western Mountains. Bozzle has two heads, one on top of his body that serves as a platform for long distance optics, and a secondary head in the middle of his torso. His brain however, is located just above this secondary head. If need be, his torso can be detached from the lower half of his body and mobility is provided by hover jets.</p>
<p>Bozzle and his battalion come across Alita, Figure, and Yolg after they wind up in the city following a desert tornado, and Bozzle decides to attack them. Alita destroys his optical head with a pistol shot and nearly kills him with her Damascus Blade, but is stopped by Yolg, a childhood friend of his. Bozzle manages to shoot off both of Alita’s legs below the knees when she tries to attack him after his men attack and appear to have killed Figure. He interrogates her while the battalion is camped for the night, revealing that Ido is still alive and assisting Desty Nova, who is a friend of Den’s. Bozzle is shot in his secondary head by Knucklehead when the latter kidnaps Alita, but appears in his hovercraft torso form with Yolg, whom he had turned into a socket soldier, after Figure has killed Knucklehead. When Yolg turns against him, he detonates Yolg’s body, then is killed by Alita.</p>

<p>Kayna is a cyborg nurse working for Ido at Factory Farm 21, which has been under Barjack control for two years when Alita visits it with Kaos in search of Ido. She first met Ido five years prior, when she was working at Desty Nova’s lab, and has been instructed by Ido to show anyone from his past who comes looking for him a recording of him explaining how discovering the truth behind Tiphares almost drove him to madness and caused him to erase his memory. Kayna is very protective of Ido and attempts to have some local cyborgs intimidate Alita into leaving when she discovers that she is searching for Ido. When this failes, Kayna reveals that her capoeira skills are good enough to match Alita blow for blow. However, their fight is cut short when she breaks down and whines after taking a hit and Ido intervenes. During Alita's brief stay, she cautions her not to bring up anything that might make him recall his past.</p>

<p>Dorotabo is a soldier who appears to have been responsible for Koyomi, as he is shown alongside her in a machine gun turret during a Barjack attack as well as in Koyomi's memories of her time in the Barjack. He was killed when the Heng was destroyed. Dorotabo was also shown as one of the soldiers interviewed by Buick.<br clear="all" /></p>

The Boiling Metal battalion in action.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The Barjack is predominantly a mobile ground force, given that they largely operate in the desert. They are formally organized, with ranks such as sergeant, squad commander, and colonel being mentioned. The largest unit shown is the battalion, although the mention of generals suggests armies. However, the numbers of troops or vehicles that make up these units is not specified. When Knucklehead’s squad attacked Factory Train 12, their forces included 15 buggies and 18 motorcycles, his entire unit.</p>
<p>There do not appear to be any formal requirements for inclusion into the Barjack, and even a desire to share Den's ideals and fight against Tiphares is not necessary. This has allowed former bandits such as Knucklehead to join, although he personally does not believe in the Barjack's cause, while B.B. Buick is captured and used as a "special prisoner" because of his photography skills. Even soldiers who hold themselves in low regard and may not be suitable for combat can volunteer to function as cyborg missiles. Koyomi is shown as one of the few females and the youngest member of the largely male Barjack.</p>

A socket soldier is readied for battle.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>These are special troops whose heads are mounted on large, lightbulb-like sockets. An adrenalizer is injected into a port on the back of their necks before they are literally screwed into armored cyborg bodies. They are armed with assault rifles, grenades, and combat knives. Appearing anxious and frightened at the prospect of combat while in their socket head form, the adrenalizer and attachment to their cyborg bodies appears to make the socket soldiers more aggressive and eager to fight. To guard against mutiny, an explosive charge in the cyborg body can be remotely detonated, killing the soldier. They are seen being deployed by Colonel Bozzle when he comes up against Alita at his battalion’s base, where she wipes out a platoon of them. Knucklehead later sabotages them by replacing the adrenalizer with cleaning detergent when he kidnaps Alita. Yolg is turned into a socket soldier by Colonel Bozzle and sent to kill Alita and Figure, but turns on Bozzle.</p>

The Heng ready to fire.</div>

</div>
<p>A giant, 80 cm <a href="../../../r/a/i/Railway_gun.html" title="Railway gun">railway gun</a>, it takes two nuclear powered trains to pull the Heng, which is 45 m long, 12 m wide, has a height of 15.5 m, and weighs 1,400 tons, excluding its base and the trains pulling it. It is constructed by the Barjack as their ultimate weapon to destroy the shaft supporting Tiphares, with the intent of bringing the city down onto and obliterating the Factory and the Scrapyard. More than just a weapon, the Heng is a potent symbol for the members of the Barjack, who manifest this by writing their last words on the barrel and placing the brains of injured soldiers into the shells, so that their hopes will help bring Tiphares down.</p>
<p>Two weeks after Den duels Alita, the Heng is brought within range of Tiphares. Only one shot is fired, which is blocked by a force field surrounding Tiphares. Before it can be reloaded, the Heng is destroyed by the Tipharean superweapon Abaddon.</p>
