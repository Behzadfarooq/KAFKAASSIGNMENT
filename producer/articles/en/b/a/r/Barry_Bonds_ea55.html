To date, Bonds has not been charged with any crime in connection with the BALCO incident. The steroids he is accused of taking were not outlawed by <a href="../../../m/l/b/MLB_d3e5.html" title="MLB">MLB</a> at the time he allegedly took them, however they were and are illegal in the United States without a <a href="../../../p/r/e/Prescription.html" title="Prescription">prescription</a>.

As a freshman, he spent the baseball season on the JV team. The next 3 years —1980-82—he starred on the varsity. He batted .467 his senior year, and was honored as a prep All-America. Bonds was drafted as a high school senior by the Giants. But, instead of pursuing big league baseball immediately, he decided to attend college. <a href="http://64.233.187.104/search?q=cache:rYO5kx5yCKMJ:www.jockbio.com/Bios/Bonds/Bonds_bio.html+%22Jun%C3%ADpero+Serra+High+School%22+bonds+arizona&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=9" class="external autonumber" title="http://64.233.187.104/search?q=cache:rYO5kx5yCKMJ:www.jockbio.com/Bios/Bonds/Bonds_bio.html+%22Jun%C3%ADpero+Serra+High+School%22+bonds+arizona&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=9" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>

In 1984 he batted .360 and stole 30 bases. In 1985 he hit 23 homers, with 66 RBIs and a .368 batting average.

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/r/Barry_Bonds_ea55.html" title="Edit section: Pittsburgh Pirates">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Pittsburgh Pirates</span></h3>
<p>He began his major league career in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1986_in_baseball.html" title="1986 in baseball">1986</a> with the <a href="../../../p/i/t/Pittsburgh_Pirates_22c6.html" title="Pittsburgh Pirates">Pittsburgh Pirates</a>, who selected him with the 6th overall pick in the 1985 draft. Bonds played with the Prince William Pirates for the 1985 season (with <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bobby_Bonilla_c102.html" title="Bobby Bonilla">Bobby Bonilla</a>) and, during the last game of the season, played all nine positions.</p>
<p>In 1986, Bonds finished 6th in Rookie of the Year voting, hitting 16 home runs and stealing 36 bases. Over the next 3 years, he was criticized for not living up to his potential, despite having respectable numbers. He hit 25 home runs in his sophomore season, along with 32 stolen bases and 59 RBIs. Bonds improved in 1988, hitting .283 with 24 home runs, the latter being among the league leaders. Bonds started off his 1989 campaign well, but petered off quickly. He finished with just 19 homers and 58 RBIs.</p>
<p>However, 1990 proved to be a different story. Bonds won the MVP award for the first time, hitting .301 with 33 home runs and 114 RBI. His 52 stolen bases was third in the league. He won his first <a href="../../../g/o/l/Gold_Glove_d943.html" title="Gold Glove">Gold Glove</a> and <a href="../../../s/i/l/Silver_Slugger_0642.html" title="Silver Slugger">Silver Slugger</a> Awards. In 1991, Bonds also put up great numbers, hitting 25 homers and driving in 116 runs, and obtained another Gold Glove and Silver Slugger. Despite this, he finished second to NL batting champion <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terry_Pendleton_4d46.html" title="Terry Pendleton">Terry Pendleton</a> in the MVP voting. The next season, Bonds won his second MVP award. He dominated the NL, hitting .311 with 34 homers and 103 RBIs. Bonds led the Pirates to the National League East division title where the Pirates fell to the Atlanta Braves. Bonds was involved in the final play in Game 7 of the NLCS, where he tried to throw out Atlanta Braves first baseman <a href="../../../s/i/d/Sid_Bream_0112.html" title="Sid Bream">Sid Bream</a>. But the throw to catcher <a href="../../../m/i/k/Mike_LaValliere_094b.html" title="Mike LaValliere">Mike LaValliere</a> was late and Bream scored the winning run. For the third consecutive season, the NL East Champion Pirates were denied a trip to the World Series.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/r/Barry_Bonds_ea55.html" title="Edit section: San Francisco Giants">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">San Francisco Giants</span></h3>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/9/1993_in_baseball.html" title="1993 in baseball">1993</a>, Bonds left the Pirates to sign a lucrative <a href="../../../f/r/e/Free_agent.html" title="Free agent">free agent</a> contract worth a then-record $43.75 million over 6 years with the Giants, with whom his father spent the first 7 years of his career. That season, Bonds hit .336, and led the league with 46 home runs and 123 RBI. Unfortunately, as good as the Giants were, winning 103 games, the Braves were one game better.</p>
<p>In the strike shortened season of 1994, Bonds hit .312 with 37 home runs, and was leading the league in walks. In 1995 Bonds hit 33 homers and drove in 104 runners, along with a .294 batting average, but he finished 12th in the MVP voting.</p>
<p>In 1996, Bonds became the first National League player to hit 40 home runs and steal 40 bases in the same season. He also drove in 129 runs with a .308 average, and walked a then-National League record 151 times. During the season, he also joined the very exclusive 300 homer/300 stolen base club, with fellow members <a href="../../../w/i/l/Willie_Mays_bc08.html" title="Willie Mays">Willie Mays</a>, <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andre_Dawson_8621.html" title="Andre Dawson">Andre Dawson</a>, and his own father, <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bobby_Bonds_4d13.html" title="Bobby Bonds">Bobby Bonds</a>. In 1997, Bonds hit .291, his lowest number since 1989, but his other numbers were very impressive. He hit 40 home runs for the second straight year and drove in 101 runs. That year he led the league in walks again with 145, just 6 off his NL record of a year before. He tied his father in 1997 for having the most 30/30 seasons.</p>
<p>In 1998, Bonds got off to a very rocky start, and some were starting to wonder if Barry was beginning to age. By season's end however, he put those notions to rest. He hit .303 with 37 home runs and drove in 122 runs, winning his eighth Gold Glove, and became the first player ever to have 400 home runs and 400 stolen bases. Yet, he placed 8th in the MVP voting, likely due to baseball's home run fever in 1998, led by the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mark_McGwire_face.html" title="Mark McGwire">Mark McGwire</a>/<a href="../../../s/a/m/Sammy_Sosa_e94a.html" title="Sammy Sosa">Sammy Sosa</a> home run chase.</p>
<p>Throughout the decade of the 1990s, Bonds was an exceptionally patient hitter and a great slugger who stole bases and played <a href="../../../g/o/l/Gold_Glove_d943.html" title="Gold Glove">Gold Glove</a> defense. Bill James ranked Bonds as the best player of the 1990s, noting that his selection for the 1990s' 2nd-best player (<a href="../../../c/r/a/Craig_Biggio_4602.html" title="Craig Biggio">Craig Biggio</a>) had been closer in production to the decade's 10th-best player than he was to Bonds.</p>

Bonds at the plate with the Giants.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>In 1999, with only statistics through <a href="../../../1/9/9/1997.html" title="1997">1997</a> being considered, Bonds ranked Number 31 on <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Sporting_News_afe1.html" title="The Sporting News">The Sporting News</a>'</i> list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players, making him the highest-ranking active player. When the Sporting News list was redone in 2005, Bonds jumped up 28 spaces to Number 6 All Time, behind only <a href="../../../b/a/b/Babe_Ruth_8c7f.html" title="Babe Ruth">Babe Ruth</a>, <a href="../../../w/i/l/Willie_Mays_bc08.html" title="Willie Mays">Willie Mays</a>, <a href="../../../t/y/_/Ty_Cobb_62bb.html" title="Ty Cobb">Ty Cobb</a>, <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walter_Johnson_b086.html" title="Walter Johnson">Walter Johnson</a>, and <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hank_Aaron_0d82.html" title="Hank Aaron">Hank Aaron</a>. However, while Bonds was nominated as a finalist for the <a href="../../../m/a/j/Major_League_Baseball_All-Century_Team_3f8b.html" title="Major League Baseball All-Century Team">Major League Baseball All-Century Team</a> that year (1999), Griffey was actually elected to it. That same year, baseball historian and <a href="../../../s/a/b/Sabermetrician.html" title="Sabermetrician">sabermetrician</a> <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_James_7752.html" title="Bill James">Bill James</a> wrote of Bonds, "Certainly the most un-appreciated superstar of my lifetime... Griffey has always been more popular, but Bonds has been a far, far greater player." As of 1999, James rated Bonds as the 16th best player of all time, even though his career was far from complete. "When people begin to take in all of his accomplishments", James predicted, "Bonds may well be rated among the five greatest players in the history of the game."</p>
<p>By the year 2000, Bonds was already regarded as a surefire Hall of Famer, but it was in the beginning of the next millennium when Bonds would surpass his peers and reach a level of offensive production that only a select few in the history of the game have achieved. In 1999, he hit 34 home runs in just 355 at-bats in just 102 games. In 2000, at age 36, Bonds hit .306, with a slugging percentage of .688 (career best at that time), and hit 49 home runs in just 143 games (also a career high to that point), while collecting a league-leading 117 walks. He had started off that season even hotter, hitting 28 home runs and slugging over .730 at the All-Star break, but some minor injuries on the season quieted him down somewhat.</p>
<p>The next year, however, he would make his 2000 season look mild by comparison. Barry Bonds put on an offensive show in 2001. In his team's first 50 games, he hit 28 home runs, ending the season with 73 home runs, a new major league record. He hit 39 home runs by the All-star break (ML record), hit a home run every 6.52 at-bats (ML record - McGwire in '98 hit one every 7.2), drew 177 walks (ML record at the time), and had a .515 on-base percentage, a feat not seen since Mickey Mantle and Ted Williams some 40+ years before him. He also had an ML record and absolutely absurd .863 slugging percentage (411 total bases in just 476 at-bats), and his OPS (on-base + slugging) was minuscule percentage points behind Babe Ruth in 1920 for the highest of all time.</p>
<p>In 2002, he didn't stop. He hit 46 home runs in just 403 at-bats. He hit a career high .370 and struck out only 47 times. Despite playing in nine fewer games than the previous season before, he shattered his own walks record, drawing 198, with a major-league record 68 intentional. He slugged .799, at the time the 4th highest total all time. And he broke Ted Williams' ML record for on-base percentage with a staggering .583. He also broke Ruth's OPS record this season by 2 points. And, he hit his 600th home run, less than a year and a half after hitting his 500th.</p>
<p>In 2003, Bonds played in just 130 games, though he still won his 3rd straight MVP, standing for "Most Valuable Player", awarded by McGwire. He hit 45 home runs in just 390 at-bats, along with a .341 batting average. He slugged .749, walked 148 times, and had an OBP well over .500 for the 3rd straight year. He also became the charter and only member of the 500 home run/500 stolen base club. Finally, in 2004, Bonds had what was arguably his best season. He hit .362, and broke his own walks record again, walking 232 times. He slugged .812, 4th highest all time, and broke his on-base % record by becoming the first person to have an on-base % over .600. He also broke his OPS record. He passed his godfather, Willie Mays, on the all-time home run list, then hit his 700th home run near the end of the season. He hit 45 home runs in just 373 at-bats, and struck out just 41 times, putting him in elite company, as few people have ever had more home runs than strikeouts in a season.</p>
<p>In the new millennium, MLB was shrouded with the controversy of steroids. During an investigation of BALCO Laboratories, Bonds' grand jury testimony was illegally leaked and obtained by the media. In the testimony he allegedly admitted he may have unknowingly been given "<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_clear.html" title="The clear">the clear</a>" and "<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_cream.html" title="The cream">the cream</a>", when he was told the substances were flaxseed oil. This ignited much media speculation on Bonds in relation to the BALCO investigation.</p>

<p>On <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_22.html" title="March 22">March 22</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>, Bonds announced that he could be sidelined for the rest of the 2005 season because of surgery on his knee. At the press conference, Bonds also indicated that he was frustrated by the focus on his alleged <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steroid.html" title="Steroid">steroid</a> use and the negative portrayal of him in the media. Later, Bonds sounded positive about his rehabilitation and told fans at the Opening Day festivities, "I will be back!" The chances of Bonds' return to the playing field were covered relentlessly throughout the summer by <a href="../../../e/s/p/ESPN_7b0e.html" title="ESPN">ESPN</a>, in anticipation of potentially unprecedented scrutiny by the media and baseball fans (baseball had toughened its steroid-testing program since Bonds had last played and Bonds was tested regularly even though he did not play). On <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_4.html" title="May 4">May 4</a>, Bonds revealed on his website that he had undergone a third arthroscopic knee surgery because of a bacterial infection in his knee. This setback led many to assume that Bonds would not play in the 2005 season, and in the process raised much speculation as to whether <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hank_Aaron_0d82.html" title="Hank Aaron">Hank Aaron</a>'s career home run record of 755 would ultimately be out of Bonds' reach.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_1.html" title="August 1">August 1</a>, in an interview with MLB.com, Bonds stated that he would most likely not return before the end of the 2005 season, due to continued buildup of fluid in the knee. On <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_5.html" title="August 5">August 5</a>, though, he stated on his website that while he was unsure of his status, he remained optimistic. In September, Bonds started working out with the team while they were in Los Angeles to play the <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles_Dodgers_bc90.html" title="Los Angeles Dodgers">Dodgers</a>. On <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_10.html" title="September 10">September 10</a>, the Giants announced that Bonds would be activated on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_12.html" title="September 12">September 12</a>. He was indeed activated that day, and immediately returned to being a starter in left field. In his return against the <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Diego_Padres_1989.html" title="San Diego Padres">San Diego Padres</a>, he nearly hit a home run in his first at-bat, but the ball was ruled to be only a double due to fan interference. Bonds finished the night 1-for-4 with a double. Upon his return, Bonds mostly continued his pre-injury dominance at the plate, hitting home runs in four consecutive games from <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_18.html" title="September 18">September 18</a> to <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_21.html" title="September 21">September 21</a> and finishing with five in only 14 games.</p>

Bonds batting versus the Cubs in 2006.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>On <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_19.html" title="February 19">February 19</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>, Bonds announced in an interview with <i><a href="../../../u/s/a/USA_Today_69f3.html" title="USA Today">USA Today</a></i> that he planned on retiring at the conclusion of the 2006 season, with or without the all-time home run record. "I've never cared about records anyway", he said, "so what difference does it make? Right now, I'm telling you, I don't even want to play next year. Baseball is a fun sport. But I'm not having fun...I love the game of baseball itself, but I don't like what it's turned out to be. I'm not mad at anybody. It's just that right now I am not proud to be a baseball player."<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>On <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_9.html" title="March 9">March 9</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>, after his first game of the preseason with the <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Francisco_Giants_cfa9.html" title="San Francisco Giants">San Francisco Giants</a>, Bonds said that he would know around the <a href="../../../m/l/b/MLB_All-Star_Game_c500.html" title="MLB All-Star Game">All-Star Break</a> and in a time period ranging from July to August 2006, whether or not he would be returning for the 2007 MLB season.</p>
<p>Bonds started the 2006 season with a slump. Bonds hit under .200 for his first 10 games of the season. Bonds didn't hit a home run until <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_22.html" title="April 22">April 22</a>; it was his biggest home run slump since the 1998 season. Throughout May, June, July, and early August, Bonds continued with sub-par offensive performance, although as his chronic injuries began to bother him less and less as the season went on, his defensive performance improved. In August, he made several running and leaping catches of a sort that had become rare for him during recent seasons.</p>
<p>Then, in late August, Bonds began an offensive surge, hitting 10 home runs in 25 starts from <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_21.html" title="August 21">August 21</a> through <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_23.html" title="September 23">September 23</a>, and lifting his batting average 40 points in the same stretch. On <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_20.html" title="August 20">August 20</a> Bonds' batting average fell to .235, his lowest average since early May. From then to <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_23.html" title="September 23">September 23</a>, Bonds could look back to a full month on an offensive tear: a .400 batting average (34 hits in 85 official at-bats), a .800 slugging percentage, with 10 home runs, 6 doubles and 26 runs batted in, along with 19 walks and only 8 strikeouts. Although media talk about the unlikelihood of Bonds' being re-signed by the Giants for the 2007 season had grown through the season and into August, the tenor of speculation abruptly turned around with many commentators concluding that it would be difficult to ignore the late-season contribution by Bonds that was keeping the Giants in the pennant race.</p>
<p>In 2006, Bonds recorded his lowest <a href="../../../s/l/u/Slugging_percentage.html" title="Slugging percentage">slugging percentage</a> (a statistic that he has historically ranked among league leaders season after season) since <a href="../../../1/9/9/1991_in_baseball.html" title="1991 in baseball">1991</a> with the <a href="../../../p/i/t/Pittsburgh_Pirates_22c6.html" title="Pittsburgh Pirates">Pittsburgh Pirates</a>.</p>
<p>In a 2005 interview with MLB.com, Bonds stated that he could play into 2007 if he remains healthy and if he is close to Aaron's 755 home runs, although he also noted that he might retire before then if he is able to win a World Series title. <sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup> Bonds' current total, as of the end of the 2006 MLB season, is 734. With his 733rd and 734th career home runs, hit respectively on September 22 and 23, 2006, Bonds tied and then passed Henry Aaron's National League career record in <a href="../../../m/i/l/Milwaukee%2C_Wisconsin_a6b4.html" title="Milwaukee, Wisconsin">Milwaukee</a>, the city where Aaron's career began and ended.</p>
<p>In early December the Giants announced they had an agreement in place with Bonds on a 1 year, $15.8 million contract. On <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_29.html" title="January 29">January 29</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2007.html" title="2007">2007</a>, the contract was finalized as both the Giants and Bonds finally agreed to the language and terms in the contract. <sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup> After the commissioner's office rejected Bonds' one-year, $15.8 million deal because it contained a personal-appearance provision, the team sent revised documents to his agent, Jeff Borris. Who stated that "At this time, Barry is not signing the new documents."<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup> Bonds signed a revised 1 year, $15.8 million contract on <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_15.html" title="February 15">February 15</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2007.html" title="2007">2007</a>, and will report to the Giants' Spring Training camp on time.</p>

<p>Bonds re-signed with the Giants for a five-year, $90 million contract in January 2002. His salary for the 2005 season was $22 million, the second-highest salary in Major League Baseball (the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Yankees_cfbf.html" title="New York Yankees">Yankees</a>' <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alex_Rodriguez_76fe.html" title="Alex Rodriguez">Alex Rodriguez</a> earned the highest, $25.2 million). In 2006 Bonds earned $20 million (not including bonuses), the fourth highest salary in baseball. Not including the 2006 season, he has made approximately $153 million during his 19-year career, making him one of baseball's highest paid players.</p>
<p>A free agent after the 2006 season, Bonds sought to play one more year for $20 million, but did not receive any contract offers, outside of the Giants.

The towering home run -- one of the longest in Citizens Bank Park's two season history, traveling an estimated 450 feet -- hit off the facade of the third deck in right field and was Bonds' first "pulled" home run of the 2006 season. Curiously, and perhaps revealingly, the jeers from the Philadelphia crowd that had haunted Bonds earlier that night turned noticeably into cheers as he completed his swing, watched the flight of the ball, rounded the bases, and touched home plate, all this to flashbulbs going off throughout the stands. The mixed and often paradoxical reaction to Bonds' impending achievement exemplifies the polarizing effect of his controversial career on baseball aficionados and casual observers alike. Some have ventured to say that while many fans hate Bonds, they all come to the park to see him play.</p>

It came on a 3-2 pitch, with one man on base, in the bottom of the fourth inning of the final game of a home stand at <a href="../../../a/t/%26/AT%26T_Park_3d25.html" title="AT&amp;T Park">AT&amp;T Park</a>. The ball was hit an estimated 445 feet into center field where it went through the hands of several fans but then fell onto an elevated platform in center field. Then it rolled off the platform where Andrew Morbitzer, a 38-year-old San Francisco resident, caught the ball while he was in line at a concession stand. Mysteriously, broadcaster <a href="../../../d/a/v/Dave_Flemming_4670.html" title="Dave Flemming">Dave Flemming</a>'s radio play-by-play of the home run went silent just as the ball was hit, apparently from a microphone failure. But the televised version, called by <a href="../../../d/u/a/Duane_Kuiper_0d2e.html" title="Duane Kuiper">Duane Kuiper</a>, was not affected. This historic home run was not officially celebrated by MLB; however, the Giants organization unfurled two large banners from light standards alongside the scoreboard in center field to honor the event. And as Bonds took his position in left field at the top of the fifth inning, <a href="../../../e/d/_/Ed_Montague_%28umpire%29_2a93.html" title="Ed Montague (umpire)">Ed Montague</a>, the long-time National League and MLB umpire and crew chief who was officiating at second base for this game, approached Bonds to congratulate him, and the two hugged. Bonds went 2 for 3 with a walk, run scored and two RBI for the day in a 6-3 loss to the Rockies while batting cleanup and playing left field.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_22.html" title="September 22">September 22</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>, Bonds tied Henry Aaron's National League career home run record of 733. The home run came in the top of the 6th inning of a high-scoring game against the Milwaukee Brewers, at <a href="../../../m/i/l/Miller_Park_9238.html" title="Miller Park">Miller Park</a> in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The achievement was notable for its occurrence in the very city where Aaron began (with the Milwaukee Braves) and concluded (with the Brewers, then in the American League) his career. With the Giants trailing 10-8, Bonds hit a blast to deep center field on a 2-0 pitch off of the Brewers' <a href="../../../c/h/r/Chris_Spurling_2899.html" title="Chris Spurling">Chris Spurling</a> with runners on first and second and one out. Though the Giants were at the time clinging to only a slim chance of making the playoffs, Bonds' home run provided the additional drama of giving the Giants an 11-10 lead late in a critical game in the final days of a pennant race. The Brewers eventually won the game, 13-12, despite Bonds' going 3 for 5, with 2 doubles, the record-tying home run, and 6 runs batted in.</p>
<p>On the following day, <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_23.html" title="September 23">September 23</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>, Bonds surpassed Aaron for the NL career home run record. Hit in Milwaukee like the previous one, this was a solo home run off of <a href="../../../c/h/r/Chris_Capuano_9d91.html" title="Chris Capuano">Chris Capuano</a> of the Brewers, and it came on a 1-0 count with 1 out in the 3rd inning of the game. This was his last home run hit in 2006.</p>

<p>In <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003_in_baseball.html" title="2003 in baseball">2003</a>, Bonds became embroiled in a scandal when <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greg_Anderson_%28trainer%29_6456.html" title="Greg Anderson (trainer)">Greg Anderson</a> of the <a href="../../../b/a/l/BALCO_c58e.html" title="BALCO">Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative</a>, Bonds' trainer since 2000, was indicted by a federal <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grand_jury.html" title="Grand jury">grand jury</a> in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_District_Court_for_the_Northern_District_of_California_303e.html" title="United States District Court for the Northern District of California">United States District Court for the Northern District of California</a> and charged with supplying <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anabolic_steroids.html" title="Anabolic steroids">anabolic steroids</a> to athletes, including a number of baseball players. This led to speculation that Bonds had used performance-enhancing drugs during a time when there was no mandatory testing in Major League Baseball. Bonds declared his innocence, attributing his changed physique and increased power to a strict regimen of bodybuilding and legitimate dietary supplements.</p>
<p>During grand jury testimony on <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_4.html" title="December 4">December 4</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a> — which was obtained through unknown means by the <i><a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Francisco_Chronicle_5d76.html" title="San Francisco Chronicle">San Francisco Chronicle</a></i> (leaking grand jury testimony is a felony) and published almost a year later, on December 3, 2004 — Bonds allegedly said Anderson gave him a rubbing balm and a liquid substance that Anderson said was arthritis cream and flaxseed oil, respectively.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[6]</a></sup> The prosecutors contended that what Bonds was actually given was "<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_cream.html" title="The cream">the cream</a>" and "<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_clear.html" title="The clear">the clear</a>", which are both forms of the designer steroid <a href="../../../t/e/t/Tetrahydrogestrinone.html" title="Tetrahydrogestrinone">THG</a>.</p>

<p>In March, 2006 the book <i><a href="../../../g/a/m/Game_of_Shadows_abeb.html" title="Game of Shadows">Game of Shadows</a></i> was released amid a storm of media publicity including the cover of <i><a href="../../../s/p/o/Sports_Illustrated_9f1c.html" title="Sports Illustrated">Sports Illustrated</a></i>. Initially small excerpts of the book were released by the authors in the issue of <i>Sports Illustrated</i>. The book alleges Bonds used <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stanozolol.html" title="Stanozolol">stanozolol</a> and a host of other steroids, and is perhaps most responsible for the change in public opinion regarding Bonds' alleged steroid use.</p>
<p>The book contained excerpts of grand jury testimony that is supposed to be sealed and confidential by law. Due to this the authors have been subpoenaed before a grand jury about how they obtained the testimony. The authors have been steadfast in their refusal to divulge their sources, and are currently facing jail time. On February 14, 2007, Troy Ellerman, one of <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victor_Conte_bb52.html" title="Victor Conte">Victor Conte</a>'s lawyers, plead guilty to leaking grand jury testimony. Through the plea agreement, he will spend two years in jail and pay a $250,000 fine. The government also dropped their case against Williams and Fainaru-Wada in the process. <a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/top/news;_ylt=A0Je5THPq9NFJUAAtQ85nYcB?slug=ap-athletes-steroids&amp;prov=ap&amp;type=lgns" class="external autonumber" title="http://sports.yahoo.com/top/news;_ylt=A0Je5THPq9NFJUAAtQ85nYcB?slug=ap-athletes-steroids&amp;prov=ap&amp;type=lgns" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></p>

According to these sources, the United States Attorney's Office in San Francisco has brought evidence before another grand jury to determine if Bonds should be indicted. Before testifying to the original grand jury (in 2003), witnesses were told that they could not be charged with any crime other than perjury based on their testimony.</p>

<p>On <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_22.html" title="July 22">July 22</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>, it was reported that federal prosecutors had obtained Barry Bonds’ medical files as part of their investigation into whether the slugger perjured himself when he said he never knowingly used steroids. U.S. Attorney Kevin Ryan had said he had postponed his decision on whether to seek an indictment of Bonds "in light of some recent developments", and the receipt of the medical records was apparently one of those developments. The records are believed to include information about three operations Bonds had last season to treat his right knee, as well as a serious elbow injury that required surgery in 1999. Bonds’ former girlfriend, Kimberly Bell, testified that Bonds blamed the elbow injury on steroid use. According to the <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Francisco_Chronicle_5d76.html" title="San Francisco Chronicle">San Francisco Chronicle</a>, prosecutors had subpoenaed the documents nearly two months ago, but Bonds’ attorneys went to federal court to stop the government from obtaining the records.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>

U.S. District Judge William Alsup ordered Anderson to return to court August 28 for a contempt hearing. In requesting the hearing, prosecutors for the first time publicly acknowledged they are targeting Bonds.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>
<p>On <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_28.html" title="August 28">August 28</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>, Greg Anderson was held in contempt of court and sent to federal prison for a second time for refusing to answer questions from a federal grand jury investigating Bonds. U.S. District Judge William Alsup said Anderson had provided no legal justification for refusing to tell the grand jury on Aug. 17 whether he had supplied steroids to Bonds or other athletes, or even whether he knew Bonds. Mark Geragos, Anderson's lawyer, said he would file an appeal with the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[13]</a></sup></p>
<p>On <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_5.html" title="October 5">October 5</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>, Greg Anderson was ordered released from prison after 37 days. U.S. District Judge William Alsup ordered his release because the federal appeals court hadn't affirmed the contempt order within the required 30 days after Anderson was jailed. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeal had sent the contempt order back to Judge Alsup, thus delaying any ruling. The main contention of Anderson's appeal is that a secret, illegally-recorded tape of him discussing Bonds' steroid use is the basis for the grand jury questions he refuses to answer. Prosecutors, however, say the tape is legal and was made in a face-to-face meeting with Anderson. Although Alsup dismissed Anderson's tape claim and others, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeal sent Anderson's appeal back to the judge, saying Alsup's ruling regarding the tape was not clear enough. In clarifying his order, Alsup said he agreed with prosecutors that there was ample evidence beyond the tape to question Anderson. Prosecutors have also said the questions they want answered are based on athletes' secret testimony in the Bay Area Laboratory Co-Operative case and a search of Anderson's house that turned up drug records, some with Bonds' name on it. Other than the tape dispute, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals had rejected the merits of Anderson's appeal.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[14]</a></sup> In November, after the order was clarified, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals agreed to hear Anderson's argument that his "entire grand jury process was tainted" because the government let the grand jury hear the tape. If the appeals court agrees that the tape unfairly contributed to Anderson's guilty plea, his conviction could be thrown out, even though Anderson already completed his three-month sentence. In the disputed tape recording, first reported by the San Francisco Chronicle, Anderson reportedly told an unidentified person that Bonds was using drugs that could not be detected. Alsup, who has read a transcript of the tape, called it "as worthless a piece of evidence as I've ever seen", according to newspaper reports. <sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[15]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[16]</a></sup></p>

The court ordered him to report to the Federal Correctional Institution in Dublin by <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_20.html" title="November 20">November 20</a>. The San Francisco-based appeals court agreed with U.S. District Judge William Alsup, ruling there was ample evidence beyond the tape to justify the grand jury's interest in questioning Anderson about Bonds.<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[17]</a></sup></p>
<p>Greg Anderson is currently in jail awaiting an appeal before the entire 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.

While Bonds was not suspended for any games under the <a href="../../../m/l/b/MLB_d3e5.html" title="MLB">MLB</a>'s new drug-testing policy, he was subjected to six further tests over the next six months, and a second positive test would have resulted in a 25-game suspension. Although media reports suggest that Bonds initially insisted that a substance taken from teammate <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mark_Sweeney_6d63.html" title="Mark Sweeney">Mark Sweeney</a>'s locker was to blame for the positive test, he has decided not to appeal the test results, and has since denied that Sweeney was ever involved in any way.<sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[20]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[21]</a></sup><sup><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>

<p>In <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_2006.html" title="April 2006">April 2006</a>, <a href="../../../e/s/p/ESPN_7b0e.html" title="ESPN">ESPN</a> premiered a 10-part <a href="../../../r/e/a/Reality_TV_3699.html" title="Reality TV">reality TV</a> series starring Bonds. The show, titled <a href="../../../s/h/o/Shows_on_ESPN_0cda.html#Original_Series" title="Shows on ESPN">Bonds on Bonds</a>, revolves on the life of Bonds and his chase of <a href="../../../b/a/b/Babe_Ruth_8c7f.html" title="Babe Ruth">Babe Ruth</a> and <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hank_Aaron_0d82.html" title="Hank Aaron">Hank Aaron</a>'s <a href="../../../h/o/m/Home_run.html" title="Home run">home run</a> records, but was met with public indifference and ridicule. It was produced by <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brian_Robbins_764a.html" title="Brian Robbins">Tollin/Robbins Productions</a>, producers of the <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nickelodeon_%28TV_channel%29_ac4d.html" title="Nickelodeon (TV channel)">Nickelodeon</a> series <i><a href="../../../a/l/l/All_That_4ac6.html" title="All That">All That</a></i> and other shows and movies. Currently, this show is on permanent hiatus.</p>
<p>The first segment of <i>Bonds on Bonds</i>, aired Tuesday, <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_4.html" title="April 4">April 4</a> nationwide on <a href="../../../e/s/p/ESPN2_2b08.html" title="ESPN2">ESPN2</a>. Much of the premiere episode dealt with how Bonds has coped with questions about whether steroids have fueled his athletic performance. At one point, Bonds even started to break down in tears. "If it makes them happy to go out of their way to try to destroy me, go right ahead. You can't hurt me any more than you've already hurt me", he said. He continued by saying, "You don't see me bringing anyone else into this. I'm going to take it myself." Bonds paused as his eyes welled and he choked back tears, "And I'm going to take it because there's so many people who depend on me."</p>
<p>In different segments throughout the program, Bonds acknowledged his often rocky relations with the press but cast himself as a victim of critics out to tear him down. He described himself as "mentally and emotionally drained" but insisted he was not going to let anyone "bring me down."</p>
<p>In June 2006, ESPN and producer Tollin/Robbins Productions officially pulled the plug on the reality series, citing "creative control" issues with star Barry Bonds and his representatives. No other details about the decision were given. "Bonds on Bonds" had been absent from the network's schedule since May 30, and given its poor ratings, the decision to cancel the show was hardly surprising, especially when coupled with the creative issues.</p>
