<p>Looks like I have my work cut out for me. All the links you have except for the obit. at ALOR are from the Left. Norman Bethune was a well known communist..ie. Red Fascists. The Leagues are anti-totalitarian (which includes fascism, Nazism, or any other authoritarianism).</p>
<p>I attended a meeting once where an agent-provocateur like Mr. Long of the Alberta "wing" of the Aryan Nations showed up with some kids he dressed up in Nazi youth suits. They might have been ousted by security, if they had misbehaved, but they were allowed to stay and the media gleefully reported that as indicating sympathy for "extreme right-wingers", rather than an act of generosity in practising freedom (plus they knew why Mr. ALberta Aryan Nations was there. That was a typical ploy of communists (especially the Zionist faction) and the Jewish Congresses in stifling legitimate defenders of freedom.</p>
<p>If you didn't know, the League itself exposed the Aryan Nations and numerous other White Supremacist Neo-Nazi phonies from the 60s through to the 90s. Wolfgange Droegge cited in one of your links was exposed long ago by Patrick Walsh (among many others, some of whose leaders turned out to be Jewish, paid agents, criminal types connected to Jewish mobsters etc.--read his "Unholy Alliance"). The Hertitage Front itself, was exposed in the main media "surprisingly" as being fronted by CSIS, the leader founder Grant Bristow, one of it's agents. When he disappeared after the exposure, the story disappeared. The group did not. The politician in charge of the oversight committee for CSIS was a fellow who was need I say it..himself Jewish. Now this is suppose to look bad if a bunch of "Nazi" agent-provocateurs and their useful idiots show up at a lecture by a Gostick, or a Fromm "seig heiling" for the media!! By bringing in this linked biased "socialist" colored story...you have continued the mockery.</p>
<p>The league was never opposed to multicuturalism in the American sense of the melting pot, but they were opposed to the gratuitous buying of votes of ethnics, of all races which catered to balkanising rather than allowing the natural process of blending. In particular they were opposed to open-door immigration, which is tantamount to invasion. In the league I met people of the Arabic, Sikh, African and American blacks (actually met a reformed leader of the Black Panther movement!) and even an aboriginal Australian preist.</p>
<p>If there had been any racist overtone to this group or Mr. Gostick himself, they would never have got my support. (My son is married to a black Zimbambwean girl and I have my heart-tugged by an Ethiopian lady--but heck, I like the ladies of all persuasions and have had friends from all streams of humankind.) In point of fact, I have had more respect for many of the immigrants here than I have had for some "educated-elitest" white liberal trash (who talk the talk, and pretend to walk the walk--the biggest mouth peices claiming to represent the multicultural fabric of our society). I am just letting you know where I am coming from and what my experience is. You need to do a lot of homework if you are going to a proper job of presenting the truest balance of Ron Gostick's story. It is a story full of muckraking and lies I can tell you from personal knowledge.--68.146.186.180 23:15, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Please log in or create an account if you don't already have one, so I know who you are. Also please note I don't give a rats' about Ron Gostick, the "League", the Heritage Front, the Communist-Zionist conspiracy or the fact that some of your best friends are black. All I ever wanted was a NPOV article, which is why I researched and edited Ron Gostick.</p>

<p>I was logged in. Wiki unlogged as I made my save. Bizzarre. All you ever wanted was a NPOV article?!! You should stick to something you know and care about--that you can give a fair and accurate perspective on. Why would you choose Ron Gostick unless you had a bias--your don't give a rat's --- shows your contempt for the subject of the article to begin with and evidently your bias. As I said, whoever started this article couldn't even get the dates correct and was filled with all kinds of hostile language as you said. The wiki "researched" links you provided are more of that kind of prejudice.--<a href="../../../r/p/s/User%7ERpsugar_c3a3.html" title="User:Rpsugar">Skull</a> 20:29, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Fair enough about logging in. With regards to the article... please spare me. Not caring is different from having bias... in the same manner purple is different from cheese. I agree that the original article was not NPOV, that's why I edited it! I really do not see the problem here. --<a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarto_fbee.html" title="User:Barto">barto</a> 03:30, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
