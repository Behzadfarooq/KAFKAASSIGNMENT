<p><b>Bard College at Simon's Rock</b><sup id="_ref-name_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-name" title="">[1]</a></sup>, also known as <b>Simon's Rock College of Bard</b>, <b>Simon's Rock College</b>, and <b>Simon's Rock</b> or, simply, <b>The Rock</b> (see <a href="../../../b/a/r/Bard_College_at_Simon%27s_Rock_3b48.html#The_name" title="Bard College at Simon's Rock">below</a>), is a small <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberal_arts_college.html" title="Liberal arts college">liberal arts college</a> located in the small town of <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Barrington%2C_Massachusetts_427e.html" title="Great Barrington, Massachusetts">Great Barrington, Massachusetts</a>, in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>. The foremost of the many unusual things about Simon's Rock is that it is designed for students to enroll after completing the tenth or eleventh grade of high school, rather than after graduating. Students who attend Simon's Rock rarely earn a high school diploma.</p>
<p>The college's founder, <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elizabeth_Blodgett_Hall_826e.html" title="Elizabeth Blodgett Hall">Elizabeth Blodgett Hall</a>, had formerly been a private girls' school headmistress at <a href="../../../c/o/n/Concord_Academy_61a8.html" title="Concord Academy">Concord Academy</a>. She concluded from her experience, and that of her colleagues, that for many students the latter two years of high school are wasted on repetitious and overly constrained work. Many young students, she thought, are ready to pursue college-level academic work some time before the usual system asks it of them.</p>
<p>While Simon's Rock is still the only college to take this approach with all of its students, it is now only one of a number of <a href="../../../e/a/r/Early_college_entrance_program.html" title="Early college entrance program">early college entrance programs</a> that provide opportunities for students to enter college one or more years ahead of their traditional high school graduation date.</p>
<p>Because Simon's Rock provides this accelerated program, it also attracts many students who might not consider a "liberal arts" education if they had to wait two more years. Computer science, pre-med, and math students read <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plato.html" title="Plato">Plato</a>, <a href="../../../d/a/n/Dante_Alighieri_bba0.html" title="Dante Alighieri">Dante</a>, <a href="../../../f/r/i/Friedrich_Nietzsche_159c.html" title="Friedrich Nietzsche">Nietzsche</a>, and <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michel_Foucault_7519.html" title="Michel Foucault">Foucault</a> alongside dancers, artists, and literary types. Students generally transfer to larger institutions after two years, though some stay for four.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/r/Bard_College_at_Simon%27s_Rock_3b48.html" title="Edit section: The name">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The name</span></h2>
<p>Simon's Rock is named after a large <a href="../../../g/l/a/Glacial_erratic.html" title="Glacial erratic">glacial erratic</a>, currently in the woods on the campus, a short walk from the main part of the campus. At the time that Simon's Rock earned its name (in the early <a href="../../../1/9/2/1920s.html" title="1920s">1920s</a>), the woods that now surround it were part of the vast area of land called Great Pine Farm. The rock was a favorite spot for people who lived nearby, especially children. One neighborhood child, named Simon, claimed the rock as his own.</p>
<p>When envisioning the college in the early <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960s.html" title="1960s">1960s</a>, Elizabeth Blodgett Hall deliberately named it nothing more than "Simon's Rock." Her reasoning for this was that even she didn't know if it was a high school, a college, or something else.</p>
<p>Throughout its short history, Simon's Rock has gone through names such as "Simon's Rock," "Simon's Rock Early College," "Simon's Rock of Bard College" (for a period after 1979, when it was acquired by <a href="../../../b/a/r/Bard_College_4a64.html" title="Bard College">Bard College</a>) and "Simon's Rock College of Bard."</p>
<p>In 2006, it was announced that the school would once again change its name, making it "Bard College at Simon's Rock"<sup id="_ref-name_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-name" title="">[1]</a></sup>. Vice President and Provost Mary Marcy said that the reasons for the change include an effort "to be more clear about identity" and "to be very clear about the Bard College system." Reactions were mixed among students, employees and alumni, many of whom were staunchly opposed to the name. The relationship with <a href="../../../b/a/r/Bard_College_4a64.html" title="Bard College">Bard College</a>, which is more clear than it has ever been with the new name, has become a point of contention among members of the school community.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/r/Bard_College_at_Simon%27s_Rock_3b48.html" title="Edit section: History">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
<p>Simon's Rock was officially founded in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1964.html" title="1964">1964</a>. From 1964 to 1970, the buildings of the campus were built on Great Pine Farm, a farm that was owned by Hall's family. These buildings were the college center, the library, the classroom buildings, three dormitories (now dormitories primarily for first-year students: Crosby, Dolliver, and Kendrick) and the dining hall. Some of the farm's buildings, such as Hall's own home, were incorporated into the college campus as well. Hall was the president of the college at its founding.</p>
<p>In 1966, the first class, all <a href="../../../w/o/m/Women%27s_college.html" title="Women's college">women</a>, were admitted to Simon's Rock. These women, along with some of the other early classes, went through a four-year program that resulted in the <a href="../../../a/s/s/Associate%27s_degree.html" title="Associate's degree">associate's degree</a>, at which point students desiring a further degree would have to transfer to another school. This differs from the current system, in which students receive an associate's degree typically after two years, and a <a href="../../../b/a/c/Bachelor%27s_degree.html" title="Bachelor's degree">bachelor's degree</a> after four years of study.</p>
<p>1970 saw both the first commencement ceremonies at Simon's Rock as well as the first <a href="../../../c/o/e/Coeducational.html" title="Coeducational">coeducational</a> entering class.</p>
<p>Hall retired as Simon's Rock's president in 1972, handing the post off to Dr. Baird W. Whitlock, whose presidency ended in 1977. Though only serving for five years, Whitlock was very influential to Simon's Rock's development. He oversaw a complete change in the associate's program, which was condensed into two years, eliminating the high school components (as it is now). He also oversaw the beginning of the <a href="../../../b/a/c/Bachelor%27s_degree.html" title="Bachelor's degree">bachelor's degree</a> program, which was accredited in 1974 by the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_England_Association_of_Schools_and_Colleges_19fe.html" title="New England Association of Schools and Colleges">New England Association of Schools and Colleges</a>.</p>
<p>Dr. Samuel McGill was Simon's Rock's president from 1977 to 1979, at which point <a href="../../../b/a/r/Bard_College_4a64.html" title="Bard College">Bard College</a> acquired Simon's Rock. The acquisition was completed as an attempt to bring Simon's Rock out of the major financial struggle it was experiencing. At the time that Simon's Rock was looking for a school to acquire it, some of the possible schools included <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston_University_b25d.html" title="Boston University">Boston University</a> and <a href="../../../y/a/l/Yale_University_757c.html" title="Yale University">Yale University</a>. The Bard acquisition took about one month from start to finish. This made <a href="../../../l/e/o/Leon_Botstein_51b8.html" title="Leon Botstein">Leon Botstein</a>, the president of Bard, the <i>ex officio</i> president of Simon's Rock, and he still holds both offices today.</p>
<p>In 1981, with the help of various donors, Simon's Rock purchased the 75-acre Upper Campus, a former <a href="../../../s/e/m/Seminary.html" title="Seminary">seminary</a> three quarters of a mile uphill from the original Simon's Rock campus. This added a gymnasium, chapel and various forms of housing to Simon's Rock's assets.</p>
<p>In 1989, an arts and humanities building was built directly across Alford Road, near the college's other arts buildings. In the same year, the student union was established in the lower level of the dining hall.</p>
<p>December of 1992 saw the college's greatest tragedy, a <a href="../../../s/c/h/School_massacre.html" title="School massacre">school shooting</a> in which a student killed one student and one professor and injured four other members of the college community. On the night of December 14, <a href="../../../w/a/y/Wayne_Lo_c008.html" title="Wayne Lo">Wayne Lo</a>, armed with a gun he had purchased earlier that day in <a href="../../../p/i/t/Pittsfield%2C_Massachusetts_09fb.html" title="Pittsfield, Massachusetts">Pittsfield, Massachusetts</a> that was loaded with ammunition he had received in the mail, walked out of his room to the school's entrance. There, he shot the security guard at the security shack, injuring her, then fired at a professor driving onto campus, killing him. He proceeded to walk to the library, where he shot four students, injuring three and killing one, outside the library's entrance.</p>
<p>Lo remains in prison to this day for his actions. Students who knew Lo claim that he held hateful and violent attitudes towards diverse groups including <a href="../../../a/f/r/African_Americans_0672.html" title="African Americans">African Americans</a>, <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jews.html" title="Jews">Jews</a>, <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homosexuals.html" title="Homosexuals">homosexuals</a>, <a href="../../../a/i/d/AIDS_b1c7.html" title="AIDS">AIDS</a> patients, and individuals with <a href="../../../d/i/s/Disabilities.html" title="Disabilities">disabilities</a>.</p>
<p>Gregory Gibson, the father of Galen Gibson, the student Lo killed, has written a book, <i>Gone Boy</i> (<a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 1-56836-292-7</a>), about his experience with the events of the murder, as well as the trial and other events that followed the murder. In it, Gibson writes heavily about the cold, careless response he claims he experienced from representatives of Simon's Rock after his son's murder.</p>
<p>In 1993, the then-unused chapel from upper campus was relocated to the main part of campus and renovated, becoming the college's music building. That same year, a number of the campus's arts and dormitory buildings were also renovated.</p>
<p>Since then, many buildings have been built or renovated. These include the Fisher Science and Academic Center (completed 1998), the Kilpatrick Athletic Center (completed 1999), the Daniel Arts Center (completed 2005), an apartment-like dormitory for upperclassmen (Pibly House, completed 2000), the Livingston Hall Student Union (completed 2006), and others.</p>
<p>In the early morning hours of April 11 2006, part of Carriage House, a residence in upper campus, burned in an electrical fire. No one was hurt in the incident, but some student possessions were partially or entirely destroyed. The residence is not currently in use, and its future is unclear.</p>
<p>Simon's Rock became the first US college to officially recognize <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_Day_2f10.html" title="May Day">International Workers' Day</a> in 2000.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/r/Bard_College_at_Simon%27s_Rock_3b48.html" title="Edit section: Trivia">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Trivia</span></h2>
<ul>
<li>There are only about 350 students, resulting in a very low student-to-faculty ratio.</li>
<li>It is a school policy that teachers are on a first-name basis. For example, students don't refer to the former dean as "Dr. Bernard Rodgers." They call him "Bernie."</li>
<li>Class sizes do not exceed 30 students, but usually have no more than 15, and average around 12. It isn't unheard of to have a class with as few as three students.</li>
<li>Classes are discussion-oriented, with lecture based offerings largely limited to the sciences. The system is predicated on the idea that the students bring as much value to the class as the professors. In fact, orientation for incoming students is a mandatory weeklong writing and thinking workshop, designed to readjust students to pedagogical, cooperative bidirectional learning.</li>
<li>In 2000, Simon's Rock was rated as the second most gay-friendly college in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> by <a href="../../../g/a/y/Gay.com.html" title="Gay.com">gay.com</a>. A survey around that time showed that a full third of the students were <i>not</i> <a href="../../../h/e/t/Heterosexual.html" title="Heterosexual">heterosexual</a>.</li>
<li>The <a href="../../../l/l/a/Llama.html" title="Llama">llama</a> is the mascot of Simon's Rock College. This is due to the proximity of the college <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football_%28soccer%29.html" title="Football (soccer)">soccer</a> fields to Seekonk Veterinary Hospital, a veterinary clinic that, at one time, had a llama pasture. The <a href="../../../s/w/i/Swimming.html" title="Swimming">Swim</a> Team is known as the Swimming Llamas.</li>
<li>The average entering age of a freshman at Simon's Rock College is 16.</li>
