	    <p><b>Barry Fry</b> (born <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_7.html" title="April 7">April 7</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/4/1945.html" title="1945">1945</a>) is an <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">English</a> <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football_%28soccer%29.html" title="Football (soccer)">football</a> <a href="../../../c/o/a/Coach_%28sports%29.html" title="Coach (sports)">manager</a>. A former <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manchester_United_F.C._7c41.html" title="Manchester United F.C.">Manchester United</a> apprentice as a <a href="../../../m/i/d/Midfielder_%28soccer%29.html" title="Midfielder (soccer)">winger</a> (his playing career involved brief spells with <a href="../../../b/o/l/Bolton_Wanderers_F.C._f176.html" title="Bolton Wanderers F.C.">Bolton</a>, <a href="../../../l/u/t/Luton_Town_F.C._24dc.html" title="Luton Town F.C.">Luton</a> and <a href="../../../l/e/y/Leyton_Orient_F.C._887b.html" title="Leyton Orient F.C.">Leyton Orient</a>), who retired prematurely due to injury.

<p>In 1973, Dunstable Town received the financial backing of Keith Cheesman. He hired a young Barry Fry as manager, and gave him money to build up a strong team; indeed in his autobiography, Fry claims that he was often given blank, signed cheques. Of note, both Jeff Astle and George Best were brought in to play for the team (Best only actually playing three competitive games). Fry was later dismissed by Cheeseman's successor, Billy Kitt, after a poor performance in the Southern League.</p>
<p>In 1979 Barry became <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barnet_F.C._112c.html" title="Barnet F.C.">Barnet</a> manager for the first of two management spells covering almost 13 seasons. In his first spell, Barnet maintained a mid-table position in the Alliance League for 6 seasons before Barry left in December 1985 to manage <a href="../../../m/a/i/Maidstone_United_F.C._54cb.html" title="Maidstone United F.C.">Maidstone</a>. He returned to Barnet in August 1986 for a further 7 seasons. Three times runners-up in the GM Vauxhall Conference, Barry achieved his first managerial success as Champions in 1990/91. Two years later he guided them towards the new Division Two (leaving two months before the end of the season to manage <a href="../../../s/o/u/Southend_United_F.C._7bb9.html" title="Southend United F.C.">Southend</a>) despite being sacked eight times and reinstated each time by controversial chairman <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stan_Flashman_4aaf.html" title="Stan Flashman">Stan Flashman</a>, as well as being in charge of a club which was in a precarious financial state and under threat of expulsion from the Football League.</p>
<p>At Birmingham City, he won the Division Two championship in 1995. During the <a href="../../../1/9/9/1995-96_in_English_football_3330.html" title="1995-96 in English football">1995-96</a> season, Fry guided the Blues to the semi-finals of the League Cup but was sacked after their mid-season promotion hopes faded and the club finished 15th in Division One.</p>
<p>Just after leaving Birmingham, Fry became chairman-manager of Peterborough United. They were relegated to Division Three in his first season at the helm but they regained their Division Two status three years later. Fry's nine-year reign as manager came to an end in May 2005 after they were relegated again. He owns the football team (but not the stadium, although he is a director of the Holding Company which owns it) and was the Chairman for the 2005-2006 season.</p>
<p>This season witnessed the departure of Mark Wright and Steve Bleasdale as first team manager. He stepped aside as Chairman on 18th September 2006, but continues have a majority shareholding, and is the current Director of Football. He described his successor as chairman, Darragh MacAnthony who now has purchased 200 shares, as "The best signing Peterborough have ever made". MacAnthony has stated his ultimate goal is to become the sole owner of the club.</p>
<p>Fry is today recognised as one of the last great true characters of english football management. His many and often erratic dealings in the transfer market led to lifelong Birmingham City supporter <a href="../../../j/a/s/Jasper_Carrott_d86d.html" title="Jasper Carrott">Jasper Carrott</a> claiming Fry "was probably trying to sort out the unemployment problem single-handed&#160;!!". In a game against <a href="../../../h/u/d/Huddersfield_Town_2218.html" title="Huddersfield Town">Huddersfield Town</a> in 1995, Birmingham City took the lead, and Fry memorably lept from the dugout and charged down the length of the touchline flailing his arms around like a windmill, before leaping into a (quite probably) stunned commentators booth.</p>
<p>Fry was often renowned for his attacking brand of football, although his tactics often meant his teams arguably conceded as many goals as they scored. Former Birmingham striker <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steve_Claridge_fe99.html" title="Steve Claridge">Steve Claridge</a> was quoted as saying; "You could write Barry's knowledge of tactics on a stamp ... ... but first of all you'd have to fold the stamp in half&#160;!!".</p>
<p>Fry starred in a documentary called <i>There's Only One Barry Fry</i>. The programme was included some of Fry's dressing room antics, including a row with Mick Bodley and his promise to get the Posh out of the second division. He did ... they were relegated to the third division.</p>
<p>Fry's Peterborough United were the subject of Sky One's 2006 documentary series "Big Ron Manager" in which <a href="../../../r/o/n/Ron_Atkinson_9f20.html" title="Ron Atkinson">Ron Atkinson</a> was bought in as a troubleshooter to help Fry and the management team during Peterborough's quest for promotion. The series was most known for seeing Peterborough manager Steve Bleasdale quit his position just 70 minutes before a match in front of his team in the dressing room. Bleasdale cited too much interference as his reason. This is thought to be mainly from Fry and Atkinson.</p>
<p>Fry still occasionally takes charge of both legend and pro-celebrity teams whenever Birmingham City hold either testimonial or fund raising games at their home ground, St Andrews.</p>
<p>Fry has also had two heart attacks during his time as a manager.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Fry makes regular guest appearances on <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglia_Television_991f.html" title="Anglia Television">Anglia</a> Soccer Night. Such is the dearth of 'expert' opinion on football in the Anglia region.</p>
