<p>Thanks for your note. I tried the link with the space eliminated and got an error message. Then, however, based on your reference to a separate article, I found that the article <a href="../../../n/j/u/Njudge.html" title="Njudge">Njudge</a> does indeed exist and is wikilinked in the <a href="../../../d/i/p/Diplomacy_%28game%29.html" title="Diplomacy (game)">Diplomacy (game)</a> article.

<p>Hey, you endorsed the RfC on Everyking, and you probably know it's gone to arbitration. Some of us feel that the proposed decision against Everyking is insufficient and too weak for a user who has abused Wikipedia so badly.

<p>Barno, I note that your reasoning in the VfD seemed to closely follow mine, so since it is possible that my arguments may have influenced your thinking, I wanted to let you know that I believe that my original statements were substantively in error. That said, I have not changed my vote, but have discovered new information regarding DVB. Please see the <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Dvb_asi_69e7.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Dvb asi">VfD page in question</a> for my current understanding if my statements influenced your vote.

<p>Hi Barno/Archive 1, I've noticed that you currently don't have a userpage. Not a problem in itself, but it makes your name appear as a redlink when signing talk pages, or when seen in <a href="../../../r/e/c/Special%7ERecentchanges_05b8.html" title="Special:Recentchanges">Special:Recentchanges</a>. Some users feel that lack of a userpage is an indication that a user may be a <a href="../../../t/r/o/Troll.html" title="Troll">troll</a>, <a href="../../../s/o/c/Sockpuppet.html" title="Sockpuppet">sockpuppet</a>, or simply a newbie. One simple solution, if you don't want to create a userpage, is to edit your userpage and insert the following:</p>
<p>#REDIRECT [[User talk:Barno/Archive 1]]</p>
<p>This will make your userpage a redirect to your talk page. If you ever want to create a user page, follow this link:</p>

<li>Since both <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_answer_songs.html" title="List of answer songs">List of answer songs</a> and List of referential songs exist, the correct solution was to fix the answer-song definition to correspond to that title, and to move the referential but non-answer songs to the other article. I did only the first; people don't seem to have been doing the second part of that cleanup in the intervening couple of weeks.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Disruptive voting?</span></h2>
<p>I am troubled by your accusation that I am disrupting wikipedia to make a point. I consider that very close to a personal attack. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 18:51, 13 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>"...The concept of "notable" should not get in the way of "verifiable and important to users". If wikipedia is doing its job of explaining national politics, it needs to cover these <s>idiots</s> minor party candidates. Kappa 06:40, 14 May 2005 (UTC)" -- Is "idiots" more of a personal attack than citing <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> in response to a user who explicitly rejected notability policy in arguing for a "keep all XXX" vote the previous day? (Or maybe it was earlier the same day.) <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not</a> a knowledge base, and it has policies about significance/lasting-impact/encyclopaedicness <b>on all topics</b> that are grouped as "notability". By consensus, some topics such as heads of states of UN-recognized nations are automatically notable enough; but no such consensus exists for minor-party candidates for national legislatures (which was the topic that raised this exchange). No such consensus existed for the previous topic where Kappa's VfD vote comment rejected notability policy and declared a voting war against it (rather than a <a href="../../../v/i/l/Wikipedia%7EVillage_pump_e980.html" title="Wikipedia:Village pump">Village pump</a> initiative to change policy). HOWEVER... so far this has only taken the form of votes and reasons that people can ignore. It hasn't risen to the level of, for example, Iasson's VfD postings that appeared to define voting rules for each article; those could confuse VfD voters and editors who had articles flagged for VfD. When another editor listed an RfC on Kappa earlier for "disruptive" postings of the same general type, I commented in Kappa's defense, for the same reason -- it's not really disruptive, and seems not to be intended as real disruption. I apologize for the implication in "don't disrupt Wikipedia to illustrate a point" that I was accusing K of <i>that level of</i> counter-policy action. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 16:00, 15 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Sorry man, no cranksite here. I have, during my travels, actually ran into people who say that they're devoutly religious and have told me that aliens/UFOs are "of the Devil" and that evil people who run the world are cooperating with Satan and his minions. Also, remember the media chaos regarding the meteorite tha had fossilized organisims in it, and it came from Mars&#160;? IF there is contact, these people may be the first to revolt.<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartial_Law_9af9.html" title="User:Martial Law">Martial Law</a> 20:52, 9 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Where is this alleged "cranksite"&#160;? All material taken from Wikipedia itself. Find ths alleged "cranksite" and I'll examine it myself.<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartial_Law_9af9.html" title="User:Martial Law">Martial Law</a> 21:40, 9 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Can this be merged,salvaged&#160;?<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartial_Law_9af9.html" title="User:Martial Law">Martial Law</a> 00:19, 10 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Examined the article in which UFOs/Aliens are mentioned in religion. I was referring to people who I've encountered belong to religious sects that believe that UFOs/Aliens are "of the Devil" and that his minions are in cooperation with evil people who run today's world. NOT 2 pro UFO religions, Scientology, UFO cults. I'm referring to people that may stone you if you tell them about being with aliens, thus they'll kill you to get rid of the demonic influences that you had picked up. <b>Those</b> people who believe that UFOs/Aliens are 'of the Devil'. I've found, in my current location, a church preacher who'll probably have a alien abductee killed to remove demonic creatures.<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartial_Law_9af9.html" title="User:Martial Law">Martial Law</a> 00:32, 10 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Can you show me some of these "UFO sites"&#160;? Can this article be salvaged&#160;? The people I'm referring to appearantly belong to Christian Fundamentalist sects.<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartial_Law_9af9.html" title="User:Martial Law">Martial Law</a> 00:41, 10 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>The only people to see anything amiss will be the controllers of HST, some ground based observatories, as a large construct nears Earth, parks itself near earth's moon, cuts loose with a powerful particle beam composed of sub atomic particles emitted from a apparatus similar to the electron gun in a old style TV, only vastly more powerful. Earth currently has nothing that can reach that far, much less stop anyone. The tectonic pressure will take care of the rest of the planet, just as if a large meteorite had hit the planet. The alien will logically park the device on the daylight side, but in a position, so as to not cause a eclipse, so that common people, such as you and I will not see it.<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartial_Law_9af9.html" title="User:Martial Law">Martial Law</a> 10:15, 10 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>One of my hobbies is military strategies and/or tactics. Seems like the relevent sources I had used NOW has updates on them that make the article Contact Consequences moot. I've read these articles myself, and found zip, thus is why I had created this frankenstein article. I've even found some new material on the UFO article. Just tell all that the article can now be <b>Terminated</b> , due to the updated info. I've found.</p>
<p>One other thing, I've heard that the National Enquirer had offered a $1M bounty on a UFO, aliens and the like. Nick Pope, a former(?) British agent and UFO author has made this claim, and I've got the book that details this claim. He was either MI-5 or MI-6. I wonder how many MI-x designations are there&#160;?<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartial_Law_9af9.html" title="User:Martial Law">Martial Law</a> 10:31, 10 November 2005 (UTC) <b>:)</b></p>

<p>Hi, I noticed you replied to my rather terse comment on this AfD. I should point out that I wasn't trying to sway your vote, rather that the comment <i>Balderson is a troll on discussion websites</i> wasn't relevant to the AfD, because the AfD wasn't about the troll. My apologies if I didn't make this explicitly clear. I've added a comment to the AfD to reflect this. <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMindmatrix_3c6f.html" title="User:Mindmatrix"><font color="#8B4513">Mind</font></a><a href="../../../m/i/n/User_talk%7EMindmatrix_738b.html" title="User talk:Mindmatrix"><font color="#EE8811">matrix</font></a> 23:54, 15 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
