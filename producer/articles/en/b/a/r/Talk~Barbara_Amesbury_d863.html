<p>What is the appropriate way for Wikipedia to write about a <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transgender.html" title="Transgender">transgender</a> person who was already notable <i>before</i> transitioning?</p>
<p>This article was recently edited by an anonymous editor (possibly, but not verifiably, Amesbury herself) who removed all references to transgender and rewrote it to leave the impression that she was always known as Barbara. I fully understand why a transperson might <i>want</i> that, but there's a problem: when she was still publicly known as Bill, she had a Top 40 hit called "Virginia (Touch Me Like You Do)", which is <i>still</i> frequently played on <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canadian</a> <a href="../../../o/l/d/Oldies.html" title="Oldies">oldies</a> radio stations (and which is the primary reason she even warrants an article in the first place.)</p>
<p>Anyone who's ever heard the song on the radio heard a male singing voice and a DJ saying the artist's name was Bill. Anyone who ever bought the single, or has it on a K-Tel "hits of the 1970s" compilation, sees the song being credited to an artist named Bill. Anyone who wants to Google the song for more information on it has to search for Bill. Anyone searching for it in the <a href="../../../c/h/u/CHUM_Chart_5bb9.html" title="CHUM Chart">CHUM Chart</a> archives has to search for Bill.</p>
<p>Bottom line, we have to acknowledge that "Virginia" was credited to a performer named Bill. We cannot imply that she was known as Barbara at the time, because it's far too easily verifiable that she wasn't.</p>
<p>So there are really only three possible approaches:</p>
<ol>
<li>The article acknowledges Barbara's transgender status, whether it's what Barbara wants or not.</li>
<li>The article is rewritten to be strictly about "Bill", and makes no mention of her gender transition or her current name.</li>
<li>The article is deleted, because if we eradicate "Bill" from the article, then "Virginia" has to go with it — and without "Virginia", unfortunately, she doesn't merit an article.</li>
</ol>

<p>Assuming there's some reliable source regarding her being transgender, I think the current version <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Barbara_Amesbury&amp;oldid=34144957" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Barbara_Amesbury&amp;oldid=34144957" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> handles it fine. It isn't outing her if there's already public information about her being transgender. And since she's notable for things before she transitioned, and the songs are still attributed to her birth name, it'd be misleading/confusing to not mention that and the fact that she transitioned. --<a href="../../../m/a/i/User%7EMairi_7ec6.html" title="User:Mairi">Mairi</a> 23:39, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I would say that option 1 is the only conceivable policy for a reputable encyclopaedia. Subjects do not get to censor their own biographies in other respects. Barbara Amesbury was formerly Bill, and while we can say that transgender people were born into what they feel was the wrong physical gender, the fact remains that that was how they used to live. You can change your future but not your past. Incidentally there are other famous transgender people who changed gender after becoming notable: travel writer <a href="../../../j/a/n/Jan_Morris_405b.html" title="Jan Morris">Jan Morris</a> and bandleader <a href="../../../a/n/g/Angela_Morley_4116.html" title="Angela Morley">Angela Morley</a> are two British examples.

<dd>The Jan Morris article has its own problems, I think. "She served in World War II in British Intelligence" but she was a he at the time! I'm tempted to rewrite it, but as this is a sensitive issue I think I'll leave be for now. --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 21:17, 13 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It's normally proper to refer to a transgendered person by the pronouns of their chosen gender identity, even when discussing periods that precede their transition. The issue in this case has more to do with the presence or absence of Amesbury's old <i>name</i>, and whether the article identifies her as transgendered at <i>all</i>; nobody has suggested at any point that the article should actually refer to Amesbury as "he" or "him". I'd revert or rebuke them if they did. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 23:56, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><i>RfC Response</i>: I agree that the current article <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Barbara_Amesbury&amp;oldid=34176202" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Barbara_Amesbury&amp;oldid=34176202" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> handles it just fine. It bolds the male name, so someone can easily find it if that's what they're looking for, and the redirect from <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Amesbury_8d0e.html" title="Bill Amesbury">Bill Amesbury</a> is very efficient in getting someone here. Also, the reference to "Bill" cannot be allowed to be deleted; as is argued above, if you take away this part of the person's past, you eliminate their notability. <a href="../../../e/w/s/User%7EEWS23_debe.html" title="User:EWS23">EWS23</a> | <a href="../../../e/w/s/User_talk%7EEWS23_56e9.html" title="User talk:EWS23">(Leave me a message!)</a> 01:07, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><i>RfC response</i>: If the article's subject wants an official change then she can write to Wikipedia admin and make it their call. Until and unless that happens, my inclination is to treat this as unjustified deletion of verifiable encyclopedic material, possibly POV pushing by some other transgendered person. It's a leap of faith to assume the identity of an unregistered editor. <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova">Durova</a> 01:58, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Another example is Donald McCloskey, the economist, who became Dierdre. In some articles she is referrred to as Dierde (nee Donald) which I think is pretty witty.</p>
<p>I'm sure I'm alone on this, but I feel the simple approach, especially given the current lack of *cited* sources, is to simply treat this as a woman named "Barbara Amesbury (formerly Bill Amesbury); with no statement "she was a he" whatsoever (though the name would give something away). Unless there are published accounts of her changes, in reputable sources, then we shouldn't delve into that at all. I think for sensitive matters like this the source citation must come with the content, and not be asked for after (I'm getting tired of asking for sources, why don't they appear in the first draft of the article, why must they be asked for?). Also, I really see no great relevance. As an analogy, suppose somebody changes their last name to re-acknowledge their ethnic background. If there's nothing published about the reasoning of the name change, we merely state the name change. I suspect there are hundreds or thousands of such cases, with no delving into the meaning of the name change. If the name change was a notable event, in enough of itself (Cat Stevens=&gt; Yusuf Islam), then it's well worth mentioning. However, sex changes are no longer automatically big news in the world anymore. If no notable source cares, we shouldn't care. If notable sources care, then we should care. The key here is it important to the public (probably not), not is it important to the individual and those close to them (probably so). --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 08:13, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The appropriate way for Wikipedia to write about anyone is accurately. the current article is not accurate, the spelling and references about this person are not accurate. Bearcat, self-proclaimed writer is inaccurate in much of his information. The editing to the previous version can in whole be attributed to me, not Ms. Amesbury. What I wrote (although not accurate) was about as accurate as what Bearcat purports to be fact. Because Wikipedia relies solely on the kindness of contributors, this leaves it open to misinformation by self-aggrandizing pompous purveyors of 'truth'. I know of at least 3 factual errors in the online listing of Ms. Amesbury.</p>
<p>The discussion of who and when to 'out' a transperson is also fairly limited by the limitations of the contributors. Binary interpretations of gender are based in an old patriarchal system of thinking. Additionally, basing gender solely on the physical is a limited system of thinking.</p>
<p>Transphobia is everywhere. It is the homophobia of the 1950's. <small>—<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> 70.51.164.130 (talk&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_70.51.164.130_9c32.html" title="Special:Contributions/70.51.164.130">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

<dd>If the article contains inaccuracies, kindly be specific about what they are. As for interpretations of gender, we somehow have to acknowledge the distinction that the songs are credited to a performer named <b>Bill</b> Amesbury. So how, then, would you propose that we address that fact without simultaneously "outing" her?

<p><i>RfC Response</i>: Although regrettable that Ms. Amersbury objects to the contents of the article cencorship is not within Wikipedia policy. It is custom to mention the most important parts of a persons life in their biography - such as marriage, children, career - and in this case <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philanthropy.html" title="Philanthropy">philanthropy</a> and <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sex_change.html" title="Sex change">sex change</a>. The article deals with the subject in a neutral and professional manner without focusing unnecesarily on the disputed matter and I see no reason to ... um... reduce or change anything.

<dd>I removed the sentence because the anon blanker was disputing it, so I reviewed the matter and noted that I couldn't find any verifiable evidence in a Google search as to whether they were still partners, or had broken up, or what. So I felt it better to remove it for the time being, and trust that if somebody was able to confirm whether they were still a couple, they'd eventually come along and reinsert it. (Admins don't have the power, incidentally, to entirely strike material from the edit history...if you can't find the original edit, you're just not looking in the right place.) <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 06:59, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
