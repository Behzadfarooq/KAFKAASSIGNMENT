<h2><span class="mw-headline">Never Muslim</span></h2>
<p>According to <a href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1546579-4,00.html" class="external text" title="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1546579-4,00.html" rel="nofollow">this article he wrote</a> for Time:</p>
<p>"In sum, my mother viewed religion through the eyes of the anthropologist that she would become; it was a phenomenon to be treated with a suitable respect, but with a suitable detachment as well. Moreover, as a child I rarely came in contact with those who might offer a substantially different view of faith. My father was almost entirely absent from my childhood, having been divorced from my mother when I was 2 years old; in any event, although my father had been raised a Muslim, by the time he met my mother he was a confirmed atheist, thinking religion to be so much superstition."</p>
<p>His mother exposed him to many different religions when he was young, but didn't raise him with any. His father was an atheist when his parents married, so it is highly unlikely that for the first two years of his life Obama was "Muslim," whatever that would mean. So his Muslim name is only that, a name. <a href="../../../a/r/r/User%7EArrow740_2a2c.html" title="User:Arrow740">Arrow740</a> 22:57, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Arrow740 is completely correct - this is consonant with all that I have read as well. He was not raised as a Muslim (see discussion above on this page about this too), and his Indonesian stepfather with whom he lived for only 4 years was a NON-practicing Muslim. The IP address edits that have been made that say otherwise are pushing a POV, for whatever reasons they have, not reporting facts. <strong><a href="../../../t/v/o/User%7ETvoz_babb.html" title="User:Tvoz">Tvoz</a></strong> | <small><a href="../../../t/v/o/User_talk%7ETvoz_576b.html" title="User talk:Tvoz">talk</a></small> 23:09, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Can a child really be considered to be religious anyway? Richard Dawkins discusses this at length. Even if both his parents were praticing Muslims, Christians, Zoroastrians, or whatever, it wouldn't matter, because he was a child and children can't be considered to be of one religion or another since they're too young to make those kinds of personal identity decisions. obama's childhood "religion" shouldn't even be a consideration. What is important, however, is how he was raised to view religion, and how his upbringing (religious or otherwise) informed his current faith. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 71.227.219.0 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_71.227.219.0_cb49.html" title="Special:Contributions/71.227.219.0">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<dd>The Fox report is only about the Insight report. The Insight report meanwhile says the madrasah claim comes from unnamed sources in the Clinton camp. More tellingly, it mixes up a bunch of obvious half and quarter truths to try and create the impression that something sinister is going on. Because Obama described it as a predominantly muslim school, rather than madrasah, it must be a secret. This is part of a concerted smear campaign. Last week I received a remarkably similar email that originated from someone who was supposedly on Obama's side but was dismayed to discover he was raised a muslim. I think it's pretty obvious who's behind this, and I rather doubt it's Hillary Clinton. By the way, according to <a href="../../../m/a/d/Madrasah.html" title="Madrasah">madrasah</a> the word in Arabic, simply means "school". --<a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELeeHunter_0ab1.html" title="User:LeeHunter">Lee Hunter</a> 01:58, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Ref check</span></h2>
<p>Pursuant to the FAR, I ran through all of the references yesterday: it is <i>extremely</i> rare to find an article this well referenced on <a href="../../../f/a/c/WP%7EFAC_4b7f.html" title="WP:FAC">WP:FAC</a> - never at <a href="../../../f/a/r/WP%7EFAR_432e.html" title="WP:FAR">WP:FAR</a>. It is also rare to find an article that completely conforms to guidelines such as <a href="../../../m/o/s/WP%7EMOS_8984.html" title="WP:MOS">WP:MOS</a>, <a href="../../../m/s/h/WP%7EMSH_7bf4.html" title="WP:MSH">WP:MSH</a>, <a href="../../../g/t/l/WP%7EGTL_2e4c.html" title="WP:GTL">WP:GTL</a>, and so on. Kudos to editors here, mainly HailFire, I understand.</p>
<p>I found no unreliable sources, and only one dead link (in Presidential ambitions - pls have a look - I put a <sup class="noprint">[<a href="../../../a/t/t/Wikipedia%7EAttribution_916a.html" title="Wikipedia:Attribution"><i><span title="The material in the vicinity of this tag needs to be fact-checked with the cited source(s)." style="white-space: nowrap;">verification needed</span></i></a>]</sup> tag on it).</p>
<p>I made the following changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Added last access date on all websources. Last access date should always be given on websources. Last access dates are not necessarily required on newspaper links, since the biblio info provided allows one to find them in hardprint, but I went ahead and added them on lesser known news sources that I checked - no reason not to include the date when the link has been verified.</li>
<li>I wikified dates so that date preferences would work.</li>
<li>I changed authors to last name first, to agree with citation style guides.</li>
<li>I changed news sources to agree with style guides, author last name first, article title in quotes, newspaper in italics, date, (and last access date on lesser known sources that might not have stable links).</li>
<li>I switched the FindArticles.com format, since I've found those links not to be stable. (It might be good to replace those with internet archive links.)</li>
<li>I found a couple of wayward errors - a few typos in publication dates, and a few inconsistencies in the way Obama's Senate Office was listed on his Senate website - made those consistent.</li>
<li>I wasn't sure why CNN and some other live news sources had the news source listed before the title rather than after, but I left them that way.</li>
<li>Probably more could be done per <a href="http://www.english.uiuc.edu/cws/wworkshop/writer_resources/citation_styles/mla/mla.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.english.uiuc.edu/cws/wworkshop/writer_resources/citation_styles/mla/mla.htm" rel="nofollow">the MLA citation guide,</a> but the refs are way better than most FAs right now.</li>
</ul>
<p>I found one thing that should be addressed: there are four specific citations from a book authored by Obama (Dreams something), that had been combined into one named ref. I split them out because page numbers should be provided for each one (along with an ISBN on the ref now listed in References, so we know which edition the page numbers refer to). Can someone pls fill in that information? I left them with p. x.</p>
<p>This article is far superior to what usually comes through FAR: I hope you're all able to keep it that way, and that new editors appreciate the quality of the work relative to the kind of stuff that is getting promoted daily at <a href="../../../f/a/c/WP%7EFAC_4b7f.html" title="WP:FAC">WP:FAC</a>. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy<font color="green">Georgia</font></a> (<a href="../../../s/a/n/User_talk%7ESandyGeorgia_ca9b.html" title="User talk:SandyGeorgia">Talk</a>) 16:29, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Great work, SandyGeorgia - thank you. I don't have the Obama book, but I'm sure some editors do, and will enter the correct page refs. About the FindArticle links - a few days ago (before your edit) I had found that several of the Sun-Times direct links were dead, and I wasn't able to find them archived on the Sun-Times site, which is why I switched to the FindArticle links that did come up on search. If anyone can find the direct links that would be better, but would you agree that as long as the full citations are there for the print pieces we don't even need online links, if the FindArticle links end up dead? One other question - do you think the piece is over-wikified or is the balance ok as it is now. I'm thinking particularly in terms of dates, but am interested in your view of that. <strong><a href="../../../t/v/o/User%7ETvoz_babb.html" title="User:Tvoz">Tvoz</a></strong> | <small><a href="../../../t/v/o/User_talk%7ETvoz_576b.html" title="User talk:Tvoz">talk</a></small> 20:33, 9 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I think it's wise to leave the FindArticles links (and all others) as courtesy links; because they are news sources, you're not required to provide a link at all (you satisfy <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> without the URL), but when you have one, may as well leave it there. I didn't look at the wikilinking yet, since you were going to be doing some re-writing. WRT dates, it's tricky - there's a proposal in the works to eliminate date wikilinking with a new function that will make preferences on dates work, but for now, in order for date preferences to work right, we're stuck with linking them. (Is 03-05 May 3 or March 5?) Some reviewers insist that all full dates, and even month-day combos, are linked, but don't link solo years. For now, until the new function is resolved, I think it's best to link except solo years - hopefully if the new function is approved, a bot will be able to convert them. I'll look at the rest of your wikilinks later: generally, wikilink only the first occurrence of any term, but with an article of some length, it's OK to wikilink "complex" or technical terms - or terms that just may need definition - in subsequent sections, because not everyone reads linearly. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy<font color="green">Georgia</font></a> (<a href="../../../s/a/n/User_talk%7ESandyGeorgia_ca9b.html" title="User talk:SandyGeorgia">Talk</a>) 02:05, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Resolve confusion</span></h2>
<p>I haven't read this article yet, but I did see this in the early part, that left me confused:</p>
<dl>
<dd>In his 1995 memoir, Dreams from My Father, Obama describes a nearly race-blind early childhood. He writes: "That my father looked nothing like the people around me—that he was black as pitch, my mother white as milk—barely registered in my mind."[3][4]</dd>
</dl>
<p>But the very next sentence indicates he didn't grow up with his father, his father wasn't even in the same country, so this quote seems to give undue importance to something that he might have barely remembered - can this be resolved? His memories before the age of two aren't meaningful&#160;????</p>

<dd>This is a guess (which of course is not a reliable source!) - so someone should look at Dreams and see the context of the quote - but I would assume that he had photographs of his father when he was growing up, and therefore was aware of who he was and what he looked like. <strong><a href="../../../t/v/o/User%7ETvoz_babb.html" title="User:Tvoz">Tvoz</a></strong> | <small><a href="../../../t/v/o/User_talk%7ETvoz_576b.html" title="User talk:Tvoz">talk</a></small> 22:02, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It really would be better, and more in line with WP's purpose, if the article were about half the size or less and just gave the basic facts about Senator Obama and explained a little why he is considered important, plus any worthwhile published criticism of course. As it is much of the article is about minute points of his career and his opinions on every issue anyone can think of. This seems to be mainly for the purpose of debating back and forth about his prospects of being the president someday. I would like to see the article trimmed down, but I don't expect this to happen. Why? Because it is much more fun to debate about his presidental chances! &#160;:-) <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_Dufour_1d44.html" title="User:Steve Dufour">Steve Dufour</a> 03:59, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't think that's really an apt characterization - most editors here are just adding information that they find which helps to describe and explain this up-and-coming politician - every major news outlet went to Obama Thursday night after Bush's speech, for his reaction/response, fo example - presumably because they think he is of great interest to their viewers. Likewise, he is of interest to Wikipedia readers. Nor do I see why we should be limited to "a little" of why he's important. I don't want to have unneeded verbiage - like, maybe not every piece of legislation he has had anything to do with - but we have plenty of room, and I think the article gives a good, well-rounded view. I do not at all think we should cut it in half. I do think, though, that we're not running a news site here, so the moment-by-mooment updates on if he's going to announce, when he's going to announce, who thinks what about his announcement - are all kind of useless and certainly won't stand the test of time. So I'd say we should just put it out of our minds are get the page otherwise in shape. If/when he annbounces, there will be a lot more readers here. <strong><a href="../../../t/v/o/User%7ETvoz_babb.html" title="User:Tvoz">Tvoz</a></strong> | <small><a href="../../../t/v/o/User_talk%7ETvoz_576b.html" title="User talk:Tvoz">talk</a></small> 09:01, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Tvoz, reducing the size of the article does not necessarily mean a deletion of the information in the article, just removing the details from this article and moving the detail to a child article. As an example, the section on his senate career is extremely long and delves into the minutia of his career as a senator. It's all important and encyclopedic, but it can get in the way of a reader making it down to the rest of this article. It's also something that should be relatively easy to <a href="../../../s/s/_/WP%7ESS_0b59.html" title="WP:SS">summarize</a>. What could happen is the details of his senate career are moved to United States Senate career of Barack Obama (or some other similar name) and a summarization of the high points of his senate career can be left here. That way the content is retained in Wikipedia, the article size of this article is reduced while still leaving important details behind, and any readers that want to read more about his senate career just have to click on the link to the article. --<a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobblehead_bff2.html" title="User:Bobblehead">Bobblehead</a> 18:36, 13 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Yeah, I agree that having the minutiae of his Senate career here will become oppressive - I said so too above - but Steve didn't seem to be saying that it should be forked off: I was responding to his point that we should explain "a little of why he is considered important" and to cutting the piece in half, both of which I think are too extreme. Also I didn't agree with the characterization that the purpose of having the details seems to be to debate his presidential chances - I think editors are genuinely trying to maintain FA status with a comprehensive article. I worry about minutiae here too - as in the mmoment to moment speculation on when an announcement will be made, as I said, and as I've removed. And yes - when his Senate career material is sufficiently large as to warrant its own article, then sure that makes sense. <strong><a href="../../../t/v/o/User%7ETvoz_babb.html" title="User:Tvoz">Tvoz</a></strong> | <small><a href="../../../t/v/o/User_talk%7ETvoz_576b.html" title="User talk:Tvoz">talk</a></small> 19:03, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's probably not too important. A lot of the staff members/advisers had red links, which says something about their notability.

<p>Point taken. However, the fact that a Freshman senator was able to recruit former aides to the senate majority leader, as well as a former aide to the Secretary of the Treasury and a Pulitizer-winning international affairs scholar, did seem unusual and noteworthy (perhaps moreso than the details of his international travel, honorary degrees, and puff pieces in newsweeklies). Would there be any support for a short paragraph in the senate career section, like this?:</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Critical voices</span></h2>
<p>Thoughts on this recent addition? Is it undue weight? I've only read the Nation one before, but is criticism by the Socialist Worker really notable? Wouldn't the Socialist Worker kind of...criticize anyone who's not a socialist (which is everybody in the Senate and House)? And I could've sworn we had established that the Nation article was not exactly notable criticism (back in Archive page 3), as Mr. Sirota's actual criticism came in the form of blog posts; the article itself was much more nuanced. <a href="../../../g/z/k/User%7EGzkn_c916.html" title="User:Gzkn">Gzkn</a> 00:54, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Consensus on IP edits</span></h2>
<p>Two weeks have passed since the most recent <a href="../../../s/p/p/WP%7ESPP_ae93.html" title="WP:SPP">semi-protection</a> was added blocking IP edits. Here in a nutshell is my personal view as an active contributor to this article since September 2006:</p>
<p><b>Presidential candidates ought to take sustained and preemptive measures to protect their security, but their Wikipedia articles should not.</b></p>
<p>How about we try to reach a consensus approach on contributions from editors who choose not to set up user accounts or log in? I think it warrants a full discussion here. --<a href="../../../h/a/i/User%7EHailFire_f565.html" title="User:HailFire">HailFire</a> 03:32, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I buy that, HailFire. If vandalism persists after protection is removed, I can always re-semi now that I have the tools (I watch the page, of course). · <b><a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJersyko_510d.html" title="User:Jersyko"><font color="#709070">j e r s y k o</font></a></b> <i><a href="../../../j/e/r/User_talk%7EJersyko_3ca3.html" title="User talk:Jersyko"><font color="#007BA7" size="1">talk</font></a></i> · 03:55, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I agree with Hail in that openness is the hallmark of wikis everywhere. The catch 22 is that because Obama is now a presidential candidate there should be more openness in editing and there will be a larger desire for anonymous editing (whether purposefully anonymous or "drive by" anonymous). However, at the same time, there will most certainly be a significant rise in vandalism because of the interest generated by the move. The truth is that there may be very valid reasons for anonymous editing and even if there is no reason other than sheer laziness that does not make the contribution of an earnest, anonymous editor any less valid than an earnest, registered editor.</dd>

I say lift it and we (the editors with this article watchlisted) can deal with vandalism until it really and truly gets out of hand. In a certain sense I feel a bit shameful when and article I keep tabs on gets protected because it signifies a breakdown in the vigilance of the editorship (I know this is an unrealistic view... but still). I say we give it a go... the worst that can happen is a re-addition of protection (and hey.. Jersey is pretty vigilant right?). --<a href="../../../r/t/r/User%7ERtrev_b641.html" title="User:Rtrev">Rtrev</a> 03:58, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I disagree about this - we already tried that, Rtrev, just a few weeks ago, and as predicted the extreme vandalism returned. Nothing has happened to change that likely trajectory - if anything, I expect it will be even greater now. The fact is that no one is prevented from editing here, as long as they take the few minutes it takes to create a user ID. That user ID need be in no way identifiable to any individual person - in fact, IP addresses are <i>more</i> identifiable than user IDs, because they can easily be traced with WHOIS by anyone. User IDs can be traced by admins, but it requires a special request to do so, and those are not granted frivolously. So in fact the user ID editor is more anonymous, not less. We have seen recently that the level of vandalism, and the nature of the vandalism, is such that it is damaging to the article to allow IP editing. This article is certainly watched by many people, but it is a small number who diligently montior it and revert vandals. When IP editing was going on, it was an unfair burden, in my view, as it made it difficult to keep track of, and assess, legitimate edits when one is drowning in a sea of vandalism. Further, the nature of the vandalism - as I have said in the past - has not been the annoying "HI MOM" type, but instead has been a targeted, often vicious, vandalism that does damage to the hard work that numerous editors have done here and makes a mockery of the serious attempts that are made to keep the article factual and neutral. I am all in favor of an open system, but requiring usernames that do not have to bear any resemblance to one's real name, and do not have to have an email address attached, are certainly protective of the editor who wishes to remain anonymous, but also protective of the integrity of the article. This article, in my view, is a classic case where sprot is legitimately used to avoid the worst of the vandals. It won't eliminate them all, but it certainly will make it manageable to maintain the quality of the article. The fact that we've had some relative - not absolute - calm due to the latest sprot has allowed the article to be edited and improved without placing an undue burden. I haven't heard any argument that is convincing as to why IP editors should be allowed to return and, I believe, start doing their damage again. <strong><a href="../../../t/v/o/User%7ETvoz_babb.html" title="User:Tvoz">Tvoz</a></strong> | <small><a href="../../../t/v/o/User_talk%7ETvoz_576b.html" title="User talk:Tvoz">talk</a></small> 05:21, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It should be removed temporarily to see if vandalism persists, and if so, extend the length of protection each time. It will give an opportunity to be edited by anons; however, they decide if it stays unprotected and how long. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShakam_b4e8.html" title="User:Shakam">shakam</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>There are well-meaning anons and malicious vandals. The vicious ones will decide if it stays protected and for how long - not the well-meaning ones. That does not seem right to me. I think we've already seen it, and we should make the decision now. We had sprot for 8 days and needed it back pretty quickly. Now we've had it for 2 weeks and I don't hear anything suggesting why this time would be different - I doubt this is a case of vandals getting tired of waiting and moving on to another target - that's true when it's my example of Joe from Milwaukee. This has been targeted at Obama, a combination of POV-pushing on the one hand and malicious troublemaking on the other - and he's moving up in visibility, not down, by all indications. Why this bothers me is that I think it is difficult to monitor and edit the well-meaning entries that are added when there are so many malicious ones to sort through. Yesterday there were well-meaning additions about the exploratory committee, but they needed editing - if it had been intermingled with vandalism on top of real edits, I think it would have been difficult to sort through (I've seen this happen before), and with the changing base of facts that I expect will be needed in this article in the months to come, why not decide now for an extended term, rather than a longer term by only 5 or 6 days? Articles with sprot are not immune to vandalism but it becomes manageable. The benefits to me outweigh the cost. But if everyone feels that we should go through the motions again, I'll of course cooperate. <strong><a href="../../../t/v/o/User%7ETvoz_babb.html" title="User:Tvoz">Tvoz</a></strong> | <small><a href="../../../t/v/o/User_talk%7ETvoz_576b.html" title="User talk:Tvoz">talk</a></small> 18:17, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I checked a more comprehensive reference - the <i>Salon</i> article by Scott Turow - and added a few words of clarification. Turow's take is a little different from the BBC piece, in that he talks about difficulties the parents faced in an interracial marriage in 1961 Hawaii leading to the separation and eventual divorce. Neither piece specifies sources - but Turow knows Obama personally and I believe his piece is based on Obama's book and has a good deal more detail than the BBC piece, so I went with that description. Regardless - my opinion is that this is not an overly significant point, nor do I think it is worthy of any more explanation than we have now.<strong><a href="../../../t/v/o/User%7ETvoz_babb.html" title="User:Tvoz">Tvoz</a></strong> | <small><a href="../../../t/v/o/User_talk%7ETvoz_576b.html" title="User talk:Tvoz">talk</a></small> 07:46, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>To clarify, having now read the above note: I don't think the sentences in the article about celebrity support are saying "oprah's backing him, he;s going to win" - they are there because the celebrities' talking up his name seemed to have a significant impact on raising awareness about him, and therefore encouraging him to for an exploratory committee and perhaps annoounce that he'll run.

<dd>No it's not, I have criticism with Captain Crunch, should I go put it in the captain crunch article? This biography should have enough in it so that people can form their own opinions about him, praise or critisim. The critisim you put in does not point to a specific part of his bio and then critisize it. Cockburn critisizes for something about Iran, but Iran is never once mentioned in this article. And Chomsky never once critisizes Obama in that article, he critisized the people that weren't looking at Obama's record and taking him in on face value alone. I quote "it was very exuberant: what a fantastic personality he is and a great candidate, thousands of people coming out. And it went on for about 15 minutes of excited rhetoric. There's only one thing missing. They didn’t say a word about what his policies were on anything. It’s kind of not -- doesn't matter, you know. He’s a unifier. He looks at you when he talks to you.

<p>My main concern is that there is a significant chunk of leftists and progressives in the population who take issue with Obama, and that this group of people should be acknowledged in the article, perhaps with some quotes from well-known representatives of these critics (like Chomsky and Cockburn). Otherwise the article is missing the depth of the controversy surrounding Obama. So maybe this stuff could be put in the "Controversy" section. ... I fundamentally disagree with H2P over who is acceptable to quote. ... And I partially agree with Jasper23 here, but then I think a "Criticism of Obama's Politics" section would be appropriate instead. <i>Something</i> that mentions/describes criticism of Obama's politics would really add depth to this article, IMHO. Also, I would still note the "Criticisms of Noam Chomsky" Wikipedia page as an example of how such pages can exist. <a href="../../../o/r/g/User%7EOrgan123_6dff.html" title="User:Organ123">Organ123</a> 22:11, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I don't understand the PoV arguments. The current article starts one section with "Supporters describe Obama's broad appeal as a cultural rorschach test, an ink spot on which his fans can project their personal histories and aspirations." If one can't post statements from detractors because they are a PoV, then I don't think one should be able to post statements from "supporters" or "fans" either. 162.66.50.2 22:52, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm saying there sort of is one already. Statements like "Obama's self-narrative helps encourage diverse multiethnic affinities", "Another article in The Nation analyzed Obama's ability to "transcend race" with predominantly white audiences", and "Both folk rock musician Neil Young and urban hip hop artist Common have referenced Obama's presidential prospects in popular song lyrics" show great admiration for the man.

<p>I wonder why this is focused on criticism from the left - if we're going in incorporate criticism, then surely there is criticism from the right as well against this essentially left politician. That's why this section seems POV to me - as if the only critics are from further left? <strong><a href="../../../t/v/o/User%7ETvoz_babb.html" title="User:Tvoz">Tvoz</a></strong> | <small><a href="../../../t/v/o/User_talk%7ETvoz_576b.html" title="User talk:Tvoz">talk</a></small> 23:56, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I agree, Tvoz, and would like to see criticism from all angles on the page. I am personally only knowledgeable of the criticism from the left, so that's why I noticed it to be missing. Somebody else would have to add some from the right. ... Anyway, it seems like almost all of us are not opposed to including some criticism in the article, in one way or another. Would people be upset if I tried to carefully insert some criticism information into portions of the article, perhaps in the controversy section, <i>without</i> creating a new section called "Criticism"? I won't include Chomsky's quote if it offends "H2P". Then other people can feel free to add information about criticism from the right, or counter-remarks to the criticism or whatever. I'd just like to put criticism in there in one way or another, for reasons stated above. <a href="../../../o/r/g/User%7EOrgan123_6dff.html" title="User:Organ123">Organ123</a> 03:03, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm not offended by Chomsky's quote, I don't care what is opinion is either way.

<dd>I'm a big believer in <b>not</b> including general criticism sections (think about whether a general "praise" section would make sense). If there's significant criticism of him, it should just be put in an existing section. If the criticism happened during say, his Senate career over some vote, put it there. If it happened during the lead-up to the 2008 election, put it in the 2008 presidential election section. Having a separate criticism section invites users to insert random "criticism" from columnists/bloggers, etc. that aren't exactly notable. <a href="../../../g/z/k/User%7EGzkn_c916.html" title="User:Gzkn">Gzkn</a> 01:04, 19 January 2007 (UTC)

<p>Apologies for not indicating why I removed the sentence about the Washington Times editorials earlier today - I inadvertently left it off of my edit summary. My reason was that it seems to me there's no real substance to the criticism - they're just complaining that they don't have anything to editorialize against. I think Gzkn is right, that if there is <i>significant</i> criticism, it should be included, but to me this is random. I'm removing it again, but also looking for something more substantive to include. <strong><a href="../../../t/v/o/User%7ETvoz_babb.html" title="User:Tvoz">Tvoz</a></strong> | <small><a href="../../../t/v/o/User_talk%7ETvoz_576b.html" title="User talk:Tvoz">talk</a></small> 03:08, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That's fair enough. It seems like only the far left and far right is criticizing him. BTW I think calling the section on his books "Works" is kind of awkward. If he was known as an author that would be fine. However just calling it "Books" would let the reader know what the section was about. It seems to me that his real works are the elections he has won. I changed the subtitle to "Authorship" thinking that maybe that was more dignified sounding than "Books", but that didn't seem to make people happy. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_Dufour_1d44.html" title="User:Steve Dufour">Steve Dufour</a> 16:50, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

No criticism sections. Controversies sections are for listing controversies in a BLP, and should be done only if a particular controversy is noteable. If you're going to argue for including any bit of criticism or controversy, you are going to have to illustrate <i>why</i> and <i>how</i> it is noteable. For now, I would suggest <i>not</i> writing up a criticism section, as there is not significant criticism for Obama such that any of it would be relevant, or <i>noteable</i>. I don't mind if someone tones down some of the wording on anything in this article that seems POV or complimentary towards Obama, but I don't think the way to go about making an article more NPOV would be to add a "Criticisms" section just to make the article seem balanced, especially if it is not warranted or significant criticism. Anyone who is <i>looking</i> to find or include criticism/controversy for Obama is not adhering to the NPOV policy. --<a href="../../../u/b/i/User%7EUbiq_091d.html" title="User:Ubiq">Ubiq</a> 01:03, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Iran stance</span></h2>
<p>I removed the Chicago Tribune editorial board interview that talked about not ruling out missile strikes against Iran. It was from 2004 (and by the way, the date was not indicated as it should have been), and I think it is misleading to include it without a much more recent quote on the subject. The Olbermann interview was more recent but Iran was such a passing reference that I don't find it notable so I removed it as well. I do hope we can find more recent, more specific quotes that demonstrate his thinking on these issues - but this seemed to me to stretching for citable material, and I don't find either one to be of value. I didn't remove the Cockburn quote that was added to the Popular Culture section because I think it adds some needed balance - but I don't think it's the best example of that point of view so I hope we find some better. <strong><a href="../../../t/v/o/User%7ETvoz_babb.html" title="User:Tvoz">Tvoz</a></strong> | <small><a href="../../../t/v/o/User_talk%7ETvoz_576b.html" title="User talk:Tvoz">talk</a></small> 23:30, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Thank you for leaving the Cockburn quote, which I think represents an important concept which is not considered at any other point in the article, and balances the quote preceding it. ... To my knowledge there is no statement since 2004 by Obama that indicates any change of his mind about attacking Iran. Many newspapers and magazines today still mention this militant stance towards Iran, referencing the very quote I used. And this is an encyclopedia, not a newspaper, so quotes from 2004 are fair game to use. In conclusion, unless people take major issue, I may repost the sentences, but with mention that the quote is from 2004, noting that he has not updated his position since then. Otherwise there will continue to be no mention of Obama's Iran stance, even though it exists. <a href="../../../o/r/g/User%7EOrgan123_6dff.html" title="User:Organ123">Organ123</a> 00:44, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Right - I don't have a problem in principle of quotes from 2004, but I don't think we know what his "Iran stance" is. He has spoken of Iran since 2004 - for example, a quick Google-News search gave me this from this past Sunday (January 14) <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/01/14/ftn/main2359098.shtml" class="external text" title="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/01/14/ftn/main2359098.shtml" rel="nofollow">Face the Nation</a>&#160;: <i>Obama said he supports a "surge in diplomacy" in tandem with a phased redeployment. The U.S. has to bring in the regional powers like Iran and Syria, he said. The problem is, he said, Bush's plan is already set in motion.</i> I don't find that particularly notable either - it's an affirmation of the point made by the Iraq study group. Bottom line, to me, is that we don't yet have a clear statement of any Iran stance, so to cobble together a couple of random quotes that mention Iran is, I think, not responsible. I'd advocate waiting until there's something of substance to add about this. <strong><a href="../../../t/v/o/User%7ETvoz_babb.html" title="User:Tvoz">Tvoz</a></strong> | <small><a href="../../../t/v/o/User_talk%7ETvoz_576b.html" title="User talk:Tvoz">talk</a></small> 03:45, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I hope someone else can weigh in on this. Look at it this way: Obama has made very few statements about Iran -- the key one in 2004, and a couple of recent ones vis-a-vis Iraq (the one you mention is essentially the same as the one I used). You're arguing that these foreign policy position statements -- the only ones that exist by Obama about a much-discussed country, Iran -- are not significant enough to mention, even though Obama is a politician. I do not accept that opinion. This is critical information, and even more so because Obama has a mystique of anti-war-ness about him. Particularly the quote from 2004 really should be in this article, even if it's just a historical reference. <a href="../../../o/r/g/User%7EOrgan123_6dff.html" title="User:Organ123">Organ123</a> 05:22, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I disagree. I don't think this should be included yet. Insight magazine is reporting that a democrat background check indicates this information. Every other outlet (as far as i've seen), has only been reporting that Insight magainze reports that the democratic background check indicates this information. This amounts to whisper down the lane, and I don't think this should be noted as fact yet. After all, as the Insight article points out, the results of this background check have not even been released yet. What is going on here is very dangerous, as wikipedia is turning some "leaked" information into "fact" before it's even verified. This would be like editing the Britney Spears article to say she's pregnant with her third baby, just because some entertainment web sites are saying she's pregnant, w/o having it actually confirmed. I believe this information should be removed, until it's confirmed. <a href="../../../b/j/e/User%7EBjewiki_11bf.html" title="User:Bjewiki">Bjewiki</a> 18:01, 21 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I also support the version Tvoz links, but I wonder if getting specific about the comparison to Clinton is out of line. Did Obama himself ever note or say that he was drawing a comparison to Clinton's remarks? Either way, the "inhale" quote is very much notable, and I see no "bad penny" element to it (I have seen nothing but praise toward Obama for his frankness and honesty on the subject). It is certainly a more recent quote on his past drug use the the one from his book, I would add. <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItaliavivi_ad2e.html" title="User:Italiavivi">Italiavivi</a> 23:18, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My "bad penny" analogy was not the clearest - as my edits show I think that the inhale quote should be included and to me also it puts him in a good light, despite the fact that some elements want to use it in a negative light. (But I don't think any of the drug stuff is particularly important, especially not in post-baby boom generation - it's more likely to find people who smoked weed than not - even Al Gore.) By "bad penny" I meant that there's no point in removing the phrase or hiding it because it won't go away - it will be raised again and again, so we may as well go with a straightforward rendition of it and move on. As for the Clinton comparison - see <a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/2006/10/24/news/dems.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.iht.com/articles/2006/10/24/news/dems.php" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> which I had included as my reference when I reinstated the phrase in an earlier edit - the text read that this statement invited journalists to make the comparison to Bill Clinton, and this is a respected journalist making that comparison. I haven't seen that he actually said "compare me to Bill Clinton" but the use of "I inhaled" is more than obviously just that. This isn't OR, it is just understanding a cultural reference. <strong><a href="../../../t/v/o/User%7ETvoz_babb.html" title="User:Tvoz">Tvoz</a></strong> | <small><a href="../../../t/v/o/User_talk%7ETvoz_576b.html" title="User talk:Tvoz">talk</a></small> 06:11, 23 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I disagree with your assertion that "the paragraph is about what's in Obama's 1995 book." The section is about his early life, and in this paragraph's case, his past drug use. And with regard to this section, I would assert that the interview on his drug use is just as (if not more) notable than a quote from his book. If we're only allowed one quote on drug use, why not use the interview, and offer the book's quote in the references, by your reasoning? I would rather include both quotes, seperately sourced, with Tvoz's footnotes added in the reference for the interview quote. <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItaliavivi_ad2e.html" title="User:Italiavivi">Italiavivi</a> 17:56, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My main concern, at least, is that I'm still not convinced that the quote itself is really that encyclopedic. Ok, so he's admitting to past drug use *again*, but this time he's doing it in a clever/witty way. *shrug*. Thus, it really seems to be giving the quote undue weight to include the entire thing in the article text (which I attribute to recentism, which is a phenomenon many wikipedia articles experience), but it doesn't seem appropriate as a matter of editorial judgment to include only part of it without context in the text. Both problems can be avoided through HailFire's edit. · <b><a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJersyko_510d.html" title="User:Jersyko"><font color="#709070">j e r s y k o</font></a></b> <i><a href="../../../j/e/r/User_talk%7EJersyko_3ca3.html" title="User talk:Jersyko"><font color="#007BA7" size="1">talk</font></a></i> · 16:57, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>How is it not encyclopedic, if it's both notable, pertinent, and straight from his mouth, is all? I don't see any ground for calling it unencyclopedic, at all. I don't understand how the line from his book is more notable than the interview quote, where the subject is concerned. I also dislike that HailFire's version places a completely different quote in a reference meant to detail his book. If someone comes to this article looking for the television interview quote, and doesn't see it in the "drug use" section, why must they look in a book's reference to find it?

<p>First of all, there is no television interview cited. If you, Italiavivi, are referring to the Chris Matthews piece, go back and look again - it was a soundbyte, not an interview., and as such not a good source - it is out of context. If you are referring to where the quote actually came frokm, the David Remnick piece, Remnick is an editor at The New Yorker and his interview is audio and print. So unless there is another interview, on television, that people would be "coming to this article" to look for, don't add red herrings - meaning, don't falsely elevate a minor point into some kind of major event to justify its inclusion. Next, you have mischaracterized my position. I do not, again DO NOT, think that this quote is particularly notable or necessary to include in the main text of the article. Read the Remnick interview and you will see how offhand and small a part of the discussion that one line was. Yes, it's memorable, but that doesn't make it notable for inclusion in the main text. It is a classic case for a foot note. However I was also not comfortable with it's being only alluded to rather than spelled out in the footnote as as earlier edit had it. I suggested at times to include it in the text, but on reading it all in context, and seeing how the footnote is now presented, I do not think it warrants distorting the text just to include a soundbyte. So, to be crystal clear and not have my words twisted, I support HailFire's long footnote edit and Jersyko's reinstatement of it. And I am going to reinstate it again. This is not edit warring on our part, Italiavivi - this is called reaching consensus. <strong><a href="../../../t/v/o/User%7ETvoz_babb.html" title="User:Tvoz">Tvoz</a></strong> | <small><a href="../../../t/v/o/User_talk%7ETvoz_576b.html" title="User talk:Tvoz">talk</a></small> 19:36, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

"In Indonesia, I’d spent 2 years at a Muslim school, 2 years at a Catholic school. In the Muslim school, the teacher wrote to tell mother I made faces during Koranic studies. In the Catholic school, when it came time to pray, I’d pretend to close my eyes, then peek around the room. Nothing happened. No angels descended."</p>
<p>In his more recent book, The Audacity of Hope, Obama writes (p.274), “Without the money to go to the international school that most expatriate children attended, I went to local Indonesian schools and ran the streets with the children of farmers, servants, tailors, and clerks.” <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_193.136.128.7_c4bf.html" title="Special:Contributions/193.136.128.7">193.136.128.7</a> (<a href="../../../1/9/3/User_talk%7E193.136.128.7.html" title="User talk:193.136.128.7">talk</a>) 11:57, 22 January 2007 (UTC).</small></p>

<dd>(Removing joke.) I am a conservative (mostly) Republican and I support Obama. For one thing having a black president (and first lady!) would be a very good thing for our society. For another I don't think there is a Republican who can win in 2008 and I think Obama would make a better president than Hillary.

<dd>Republican Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger supported the new Californian plan to expand coverage for the uninsured through a measure of government intervention.

Extreme left my ass. Additionally, the libertarian party's website is probably not a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a> for characterizing Obama's position on health care. Finally, if Obama has taken a firm stance on health care and the uninsured and reliable sources are discussing it, I'm all for including it in the article. · <b><a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJersyko_510d.html" title="User:Jersyko"><font color="#709070">j e r s y k o</font></a></b> <i><a href="../../../j/e/r/User_talk%7EJersyko_3ca3.html" title="User talk:Jersyko"><font color="#007BA7" size="1">talk</font></a></i> · 19:02, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hillary Clinton <a href="../../../p/o/l/Political_views_of_Hillary_Rodham_Clinton_5120.html" title="Political views of Hillary Rodham Clinton">has one</a>, and it's quite nice.

The current page is very long and it's difficult to expand on anything. The "political advocacy" section doesn't do justice to displaying Obama's viewpoints.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Articulate</span></h2>
<p>I think it needs to be pointed out somewhere in the article that Barack is very articulate. He is surprisingly well spoken. Just a thought. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by [[User:{{{1}}}|{{{1}}}]] ([[User talk:{{{1}}}|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/{{{1}}}|contribs]]).</small></p>
<p>WTF, is he supposed to be inarticulate? What is wrong with you???? <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShakam_b4e8.html" title="User:Shakam">shakam</a></p>
<p>Please tell me, why is this so surprising to you? I am African American, and I always bristle a bit when someone remarks how articulate I am. I have heard this sentiment from many others as well. Eugene Robinson expressed his unease with this very eloquently (or, should I say, articulately?) in a column in today's Washington Post[<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/01/AR2007020101495.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/01/AR2007020101495.html" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>].</p>
<p>The point is, I've never heard anyone say that Nancy Pelosi is articulate (although I've read WAY too many remarks about her clothes). I've never heard it said about Carl Sagan, who made science so accessible for laypeople, or even Ronald Reagan, the "Great Communicator." Yet I, a lowly horticulturist, have heard it more times than I can count. So has my sister, my father, etc. The implied insult is that African Americans are not capable of, or expected to utter articulate speech.</p>
<p>As Eugene Robinson pointed out, something is amiss when a man is graduated from an Ivy League university, earns a law degree from another one, where he was president of the law review, and people express surprise that he can fashion a decent English sentence.

<dd>I don't know. Bush went to Yale, has been a governer, and now the president. I've never heard anyone describe him as articulate (cause he isn't). However, Ronald Reagan was described as articulate. So, I don't really think it's solely a black &amp; white issue. It's more that today, we don't really have many articulate politicians (think the aforementioned Reagan, JFK, etc). <a href="../../../b/j/e/User%7EBjewiki_11bf.html" title="User:Bjewiki">Bjewiki</a> 21:43, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The word for him is <b>"eloquent."</b> "Articulate" just means you don't talk like a moron. Eloquence is beyond that, into the realm of speaking movingly to any audience.

<dd>Absolutely on the money. When I first heard about the complaints of the implied underlying racism by terming Obama "articulate", I was taken aback—the first thing <i><b>I</b></i> had noticed about him (with half of America watching with me) was at his keynote address in '04, that he was the <i>greatest</i> speaker I had ever heard. I tried to explain to students that this was the kind of speaker that people used to travel two days to listen to in the first half of the 19th century. I mean, it <i>was</i> his speech that I was noticing. So WTF--why is it an insult to note this? Well, now I understand. Frankly, I don't think that all college educated people are articulate, but the point is, the connotation of the word is minimalist (though I think this may be a newer construction). As Wareq says, "eloquent" is the NPOV word for him ("mesmerizing", "inspirational", and others might be accurate as well, but are more POV). <a href="../../../u/n/s/User%7EUnschool_e4b4.html" title="User:Unschool">Unschool</a> 05:56, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"America is a great country, but for if someone has any visible African heritage at all--you can be 100% sure they will encounter racism during their lifetime. Barak Obama is of 50% African heritage and he is American. That is more than enough to call him African American with no hesitation and no second thoughts. Saying, in effect, that his status "doesn't count" also oversimplifies the entire African American community in the USA-- the African American community is hugely diverse-- ranging from predominantly priveledged, highly educated, hugely successful, on the one hand; all the way over to poor and struggling on the other extreme (not unlike the White American community).

<p>In the history of America, we have always held that if one is part black then he/she is all black.

<p>But you see he is not decended from the slaves brought to the US hundreds of years ago. His african stock came here in the 1950's.

<p>Surely, the experiance of a person who is decended from slaves is diffrent from those who are decended from those who came here recently. To label someone who is of Kenyean decent "African-American" is stripping him of his proud culture. Those who have come here recently are also culturely diffrent than those who have been here over hundreds of years. If we were to lump all people who have african decent into the category of "African-American" we also lose the idenity of former slaves. Personally, I would not like to be called European-American, since I very well know where my grandparents came from. To label me simply "Euro-American" strips me of my grandparents Italian culture.</p>

<p>I would have to disagree with the comments above regarding "scared white-people". For starters, you cannot hide a name like <i>Hussein</i> in the US. The name itself has a stigma. It is not meant to "scare white-people", as I am one and am the least bit scared. Moreover, it was an internet rumor... similar to the "send this to 1 million people to raise money for so-&amp;-so to receive a free kidney transplant". There is a lot of garbage on the web, rumors and the like. I think the point was misinterpretted as trying to "scare white-people" (racist comment if I may), when it was most likely someone saying - <i>"Does the US want a 'Hussein' as President?"</i> Now I understand that it is not the same family name, rather <b>just</b> a name... but I am willing to bet that was the initial intent. P.S. - Please stop the foul language and racial hits towards "white-people"... I believe we are officially Caucasians or Americans of European Ancestry... something more sophisticated.

<dd>I think Obama is concerned with saying as little of significance as possible in order to gain broad support for 2008. For example, from a recent Obama speech: <i>"Our leaders in Washington seem incapable of working together in a practical, commonsense way." "Politics has become so bitter and partisan, so gummed up by money and influence, that we can't tackle the big problems that demand solutions. And that's what we have to change first."</i> ... That says absolutely nothing, but it's hard to disagree. This is in line with Chomsky's recent comments about Obama and NPR, quoted above: <i>"...But they had a section on Barack Obama, the great new hope. And it was very exuberant: what a fantastic personality he is and a great candidate, thousands of people coming out. And it went on for about 15 minutes of excited rhetoric. There's only one thing missing. They didn’t say a word about what his policies were on anything. It’s kind of not -- doesn't matter, you know. He’s a unifier. He looks at you when he talks to you. He’s a really decent guy. Great background. OK, that's an election."</i> <a href="../../../o/r/g/User%7EOrgan123_6dff.html" title="User:Organ123">Organ123</a> 18:03, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It's sort of ridiculous to suggest Barack Obama's political views are hard to find or nonexistant. In his book, Audacity of Hope, he actually EXPLICITLY covers pretty much every political view he has, why he has it, and how it applies to the real world. Not only that, he cuts it up into convenient sections such as "Race" or "Faith." If you wish to include his beliefs, pick up a copy of his book, look at the first and last sections of each chapter. He has said such things as, there should be universal health care, there is no reason that an effective teacher at the peak of their career should make less than 100000$/year, that the gap between Rich/Middle is growing, that race problems exist, so on, and so on, and so on.

After people have considered this, and if no one has the book, I'll consider a way to include his views in such a section. I'm afraid I have no idea how to format it, what to include, so forth, since there's.. so much information in the book. Perhaps this could simply be accomplished by saying..</p>

<p>I think something shuold be added to let it know that he has refused to respond to the 2004 Vote Smart survey. I find this to be fairly important to know. As a "centerist", I'm very interested to know if his views have changed since 1998. (Source here: <a href="http://www.vote-smart.org/npat.php?can_id=BS030017" class="external free" title="http://www.vote-smart.org/npat.php?can_id=BS030017" rel="nofollow">http://www.vote-smart.org/npat.php?can_id=BS030017</a>)69.154.2.3 20:29, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm not sure the NPAT is notable enough to be listed as something he has not filled out. It's just a survey. If you'd like to know about his views, you can check out his voting record (available at Vote Smart), or his book, <i>The Audacity of Hope</i>, (which has the same level of credibility as the NPAT survey). Alternatively, you can check out our fledgling new article about his political beliefs at <a href="../../../p/o/l/Political_views_of_Barack_Obama_48b0.html" title="Political views of Barack Obama">Political views of Barack Obama</a>. —<a href="../../../b/b/a/User%7EBbatsell_88ca.html" title="User:Bbatsell"><b><font color="#333333">bbatsell</font></b></a> <a href="../../../b/b/a/User_talk%7EBbatsell_7978.html" title="User talk:Bbatsell"><font color="#C46100" size="1">¿?</font></a> 20:31, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't want to make a article edit, and I have no real idea how to start a discussion subject. However, in 2003, Obama voted in support of SB1195, which, if passed, would have banned most of the privately held hunting shotguns, target rifles, and black powder rifles in the state of Illinois. If the ban was enacted, law enforcement officials would have been authorized to forcibly enter private homes to confiscate newly banned firearms, if the owner did not turn them in. This is one of the most draconian gun control attempts on the books, and he was all for it. if you look up the Illinois bill, please read the full text, not the synopsis; any longgun owner could tell you that this was more than a simple assault weapon ban attempt.Paganize 12:44, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>This is a stupid argument to suggest that because he went to an ordinary Muslim school in Indonesia that he was attending some "Islamist madrassa"?! I can't even say how stupid and bigoted this is. Schools in Muslim countries are not officially "Muslim" schools, since they are ordinary public schools. But in some Muslim countries (like Iran) the public schools also teach Qur'an and Arabic. The other alternatives in those cases would be going to schools for a religious minority, like a Jewish or Christian school which are usually restricted (by the government or those communities) to Jews and Christians only. There is alot of times no "secular" school. But the public schools in Iran and Indonesia, for example, are <b>not</b> "Islamist madrassas" or any nonsense like that. <b>The term "madrassa" itself only means "school" and is the generic name for "school" in many languages.</b> I really wish people would stop this ignorance and go learn something. If I am not wrong, Obama also went to a Christian school. I also went to school in Iran and had to study Qur'an like everyone else. So this makes a person like me an "Islamist" or whatever <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neologism.html" title="Neologism">neologism</a> people can come up with?!

<p>Regardless of the import of the "madrassa scandal", I do find it rather interesting that, when searching for "fox news controversies" on wikipedia, you will find four or five topics that contain all of the search terms. When searching for ABC, NBC, CBS, or CNN news controversies, their is nary a one entry that corresponds. I personally believe that the politicians on both sides of the isle are, in the great majority, disingenuous in the least and corrupt and evil in the main. I also believe we live in an oligarchy whose producers put on a play of democracy in the form of a represented republic to the masses, with both sides greatly desirous of implementing their own specialized plutocracy. That said, whether you are a cynic of contemporary politics as I am, whether you are a partisan of one side or the other, or whether you are something else, do you not think it is laughably absurd that only fox news has numerous pages dedicated specifically to supposed and real manipulations of the news? Such instances like this lend credibility to the proposition that Wikipedia, when dealing with political, social, moral, religious, and, to some extent, philosophical subject matter, is much more an oracle of the Left that imports a biased view rather than a neutral encyclopedic source that seeks to realistically inform. I am a cynic only when it suggests itself as the most rational position, and so, here, I am a cynic. If you seek dispassionate information or debate about the arrow frog to ice cream, the nucleus to nebulae, Wikipedia is a wonderful, superficial start. If you seek to understand the intellect, morality, and wisdom of Man, Wikipedia, more often than not, only offers an education into one side of the dissimulative nature of Man. I'm curious, is their a website of this stature that opposes this one and offers up the hypocrisy of the Right?</p>

<p>For a strange coincidence, his first name "Barack" in its written form means "peach" in Hungarian (the noun "barack" is however pronounced as "buh-rutsk" in that language), thus looks a bit funny for native readers and gives his name a pleasant touch, as summoning the image of the fruit. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 91.120.117.214 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_91.120.117.214_096f.html" title="Special:Contributions/91.120.117.214">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<dd>It shouldn't. Have you read the sentence itself? The mention of her smoking is completely broken off from the rest of the paragraph. It sounds like a side note and really doesn't need to be there. Now, if she was an avid supporter of Anti-smoking campaigns, then it would make sense. The source itself reads <i>Even Laura Bush has her vices, such as a smoking habit she can't quite shake. Kessler says the first lady bums a cigarette once in a while: "She goes out on the balcony and smokes a little bit every now and then."</i> It's far from important. <a href="../../../h/e/i/User%7EHeirToPendragon_b665.html" title="User:HeirToPendragon">H2P</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../h/e/i/User_talk%7EHeirToPendragon_c05a.html" title="User talk:HeirToPendragon">Yell at me</a> for <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_HeirToPendragon_68aa.html" title="Special:Contributions/HeirToPendragon">what I've done</a>)</sup> 14:07, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ok, kidding aside - I agree with H2P - the only reason anyone's being a smoker would be relevant to his or her article is if that person was otherwise identified with an anti-smoking campaign and made statements like "I don't smoke, you shouldn't either". One's personal vices don't necessarily mean one shouldn't advise others not to engage in them, unless you're Mark Foley or the like, but blatant lying about them would be problematic. In any case, I see no relevance to include here. <strong><a href="../../../t/v/o/User%7ETvoz_babb.html" title="User:Tvoz">Tvoz</a></strong> | <small><a href="../../../t/v/o/User_talk%7ETvoz_576b.html" title="User talk:Tvoz">talk</a></small> 18:36, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

I'll repeat what I just said in an edit summary removing the fact that Obama is trying to quit smoking. Just because something is true, and has a citation, does NOT mean it is notable for inclusion in a Wikipedia article. There are regular reminders of length concerns on Wikipedia, which I don't personally necessarily agree with but they are indeed the environment within which we work - especially for a Featured Article which this one is. The fact that Obama smokes cigarettes and is trying to stop is utterly absurd to be included in this article, cited, quoted, and wrapped up in a ribbon and presented. <strong><a href="../../../t/v/o/User%7ETvoz_babb.html" title="User:Tvoz">Tvoz</a></strong> | <small><a href="../../../t/v/o/User_talk%7ETvoz_576b.html" title="User talk:Tvoz">talk</a></small> 21:49, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>What is notability, can it easily be defined without pushing our own biased views and opinions? I don't think it should be included in the article if you're wondering, I think because I feel it is insignificant. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShakam_b4e8.html" title="User:Shakam">Shakam</a> 06:28, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>It probably should be on there, though written in an unbiased way. This is a potential presidential candidate and smoking is something which people will want include in their decision. Insignificant? I don't think so. Though not as grave a habit as getting frisky with interns, smoking is still a habit about which many people feel strongly. How I feel about the issue IS however insignificant. Erik</p>

<dd>But this article is not part of anyone's campaign, pro or anti Obama- its purpose is not to give people information so they can decide if they want to vote for him. I don't think his smoking at all rises to the level of notability for this individual,for this article, for the reasons I outlined above. That's why I facetiously asked does he curse - or does he socially drink - these have a similar level of insignificance to a Wikipedia article. Let his opponents use it in their campaign literature if they want to - it doesn't belong here. <strong><a href="../../../t/v/o/User%7ETvoz_babb.html" title="User:Tvoz">Tvoz</a></strong> | <small><a href="../../../t/v/o/User_talk%7ETvoz_576b.html" title="User talk:Tvoz">talk</a></small> 17:36, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Perhaps you are right. Let me pose this question: if he had a drinking problem would that make the wiki? I know we are getting in to degrees of abuse and thats very subjective. Let me point you to Paula Abdul's page. Her incidences of weird behavior are noted as being a suspected substance abuse issue though she has not publicly stated it. Aside from the smoking topic, people will use this as a source for voting whether you want them to or not. Have it your way Tvoz, you spend more time on here than I do. Erik</dd>

<dd>I'm not trying to have it my way, I'm just saying what I think. My only interest is in presenting notable material in as fair and neutral way as possible, and not on behalf of one campaign or another. I've spent a fair amount of time on Nelson Rockefeller and Hillary Rodham Clinton too, among others, so I'm not taking sides here. And yes, if someone had a drinking problem that affected his or her behavior and job functioning, I would say it might be appropriate here (subject to the wikipedia libel concerns of biographies of living people, that is). That was my point - it's notable if it is in direct contradiction to something he says - meaning he's lying - and it's notable if it is somehow affecting his performance- that kind of thing. On its own, it is being presented as if it has some inherent meaning, and I don't think it does.

<dd>Why must a vice illustrate hypocrisy or suggest a problem to be relevant? You're (understandably, given today's political culture in the US) looking at this from only one direction. Consider that the fact might be interesting - even important - to those of us concerned about puritanism in this country and its government's attacks on industry &amp; personal freedom. I doubt I'm the only voter more inclined to trust the man for the fact that he enjoys a few vices and doesn't work to conceal them. --<a href="../../../e/i/n/User%7EEinexile_8683.html" title="User:Einexile">einexile</a> 11:39, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

First things first, does anyone actually have a credible source to confirm this? If someone mentioned one early, I apologize, but I didn't see one above. I don't think it would be appropriate to include this fact if you can't site a source. But, if you can find a source, I don't see any reason why it shouldn't bee included, despite it being a triviality. <a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStopmenow100_b5bb.html" title="User:Stopmenow100">Stop Me Now!</a> 14:39, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>So what? Bill Richardson lost weight for his run. I haven't looked, but I sure as hell hope it didn't make it onto his wikipedia page.

<dd>I agree with you <a href="../../../t/v/o/User%7ETvoz_babb.html" title="User:Tvoz">Tvoz</a> that this does not warrant mention in an encyclopedia article. Confusing this article with a campaign tool would be a grave mistake. There are other sources of information people will use to make their decisions about Obama and other candidates for public office and Wikipedia does not need to be an exhaustive source of information on the candidates for President nor would it be appropriate to do so. When we get to the point we are mentioning minor points of interest to some such as Obama smoking as a part of an article we are seeking to use Wikipedia in a way that is in my view unacceptable. Yes, this does interest some people as has been mentioned by <a href="../../../e/i/n/User%7EEinexile_8683.html" title="User:Einexile">Einexile</a> and may affect their decision on election day but this information is available through other sources. Everything about Obama has the possibility of affecting someone's decision and I can guarantee that there is nothing about him that someone would not find interesting and important but I still don't think this is the place to cover every point or fact about a person. <a href="../../../e/d/w/User%7EEdwardlalone_3c3b.html" title="User:Edwardlalone">Edward Lalone</a> | (<a href="../../../e/d/w/User_talk%7EEdwardlalone_ffa4.html" title="User talk:Edwardlalone">Talk</a>) 02:06, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
