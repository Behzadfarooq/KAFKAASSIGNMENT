<p><a href="../../../m/a/h/Mahatma_Gandhi_e9af.html" title="Mahatma Gandhi">Mahatma Gandhi</a> had led two great revolts of communities of poor Indian farmers against the tyranny of the British government and allied landlords in <a href="../../../c/h/a/Champaran.html" title="Champaran">Champaran</a>, <a href="../../../b/i/h/Bihar.html" title="Bihar">Bihar</a>, and <a href="../../../k/h/e/Kheda.html" title="Kheda">Kheda</a>, <a href="../../../g/u/j/Gujarat.html" title="Gujarat">Gujarat</a>. Success in both struggles had helped win the farmers economic and civil rights, and electrified India's people.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/2/1920.html" title="1920">1920</a>, the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indian_National_Congress_2296.html" title="Indian National Congress">Indian National Congress</a> under Gandhi's leadership launched the <a href="../../../n/o/n/Non-Cooperation_Movement_c839.html" title="Non-Cooperation Movement">Non-Cooperation Movement</a>. Millions of Indians revolted against the British, boycotting the courts, government services, schools and disavowing titles, pensions and British clothes and goods. The freedom fighters, known as <i>Satyagrahis</i>, peacefully protested authoritarian British laws, and called for India's independnece. Many thousands were beaten, tortured and arrested.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/2/1922.html" title="1922">1922</a>, however, a mob of protestors killed some policemen in <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chauri_Chaura_0dc6.html" title="Chauri Chaura">Chauri Chaura</a>. Fearing a slide into violence and anarchy, Gandhi called for the struggle to be suspended. He was arrested in the same year and sentenced to be imprisoned for six years, but released in 1924.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/r/Bardoli_Satyagraha_b4e9.html" title="Edit section: The crisis">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The crisis</span></h2>
<p>In 1925, the <a href="../../../t/a/l/Taluka.html" title="Taluka">taluka</a> of <a href="../../../b/a/r/Bardoli.html" title="Bardoli">Bardoli</a> in <a href="../../../g/u/j/Gujarat.html" title="Gujarat">Gujarat</a> suffered from floods and famine, causing crop production to suffer and leaving farmers facing great financial troubles. However, the Government of the <a href="../../../b/o/m/Bombay_Presidency_ead2.html" title="Bombay Presidency">Bombay Presidency</a> had raised the tax rate by 30% that year, and despite petitions from civic groups, refused to cancel the rise in the face of the calamities. The situation for the farmers was grave enough that they barely had enough property and crops to pay-off the tax, let alone for feeding themselves afterwards.</p>
<p><a name="Considering_the_options" id="Considering_the_options"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/r/Bardoli_Satyagraha_b4e9.html" title="Edit section: Considering the options">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Considering the options</span></h3>
<p>The Gujarati activists <a href="../../../n/a/r/Narhari_Parikh_22c9.html" title="Narhari Parikh">Narhari Parikh</a>, <a href="../../../r/a/v/Ravi_Shankar_Vyas_0ca6.html" title="Ravi Shankar Vyas">Ravi Shankar Vyas</a>, and <a href="../../../m/o/h/Mohanlal_Pandya_e2fc.html" title="Mohanlal Pandya">Mohanlal Pandya</a> talked to village chieftains and farmers, and solicited the help of Gujarat's most prominent freedom fighter, <a href="../../../v/a/l/Vallabhbhai_Patel_7aad.html" title="Vallabhbhai Patel">Vallabhbhai Patel</a>. Patel had previously guided Gujarat's farmers during the Kheda struggle, and had served recently as <a href="../../../a/h/m/Ahmedabad.html" title="Ahmedabad">Ahmedabad</a>'s municipal president. He was widely respected by common Gujaratis across the state.</p>
<p>Patel told a delegation of farmers frankly that if they should realize fully what a revolt would imply. He would not lead them unless he had the unanimous understanding and agreement of all the villages involved. Refusing payment of taxes could lead to their property being confiscated, including their lands, and many would go to jail. They could face complete decimation. The villagers replied that they were prepared for the worst, but definitely could not accept the Government's injustice.</p>
<p>Patel then asked Gandhi to consider the matter. But Gandhi merely asked what Patel thought, and when the latter replied with confidence about the prospects, he gave his blessing. But Gandhi and Patel agreed that neither the Congress nor Gandhi would directly involve themselves, and the struggle left entirely to the people of Bardoli taluka.</p>
<p><a name="The_struggle" id="The_struggle"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/r/Bardoli_Satyagraha_b4e9.html" title="Edit section: The struggle">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The struggle</span></h2>
<p><i>See Also: <a href="../../../s/a/t/Satyagraha.html" title="Satyagraha">Satyagraha</a></i></p>
<p>Patel first wrote to the Governor of Bombay, asking him to reduce the taxes for the year in face of the calamities. But the Governor ignored the letter, and reciprocated by announcing the date of collection.</p>
<p>Patel then instructed all the farmers of Bardoli taluka to refuse payment of their taxes. Aided by Parikh, Vyas and Pandya, he divided Bardoli into several zones – each with a leader and volunteers specifically assigned. Patel also placed some Gujarati activists close to the government, to act as informers on the movements of government officials.</p>
<p>Above all, Patel instructed the farmers to remain completely non-violent, and not respond physically to any incitments or aggressive actions from officials. He reassured them that the struggle would not end until not only the cancellation of all taxes for the year, but also when all the seized property and lands were returned to their rightful owners.</p>
<p>The farmers received complete support from their compatriots in Gujarat. Many hid their most precious belongings with relatives in other parts, and the protestors received financial support and essential supplies from supporters in other parts. But Patel refused permission to enthusiastic supporters in Gujarat and other parts of India from going on sympathetic protest.</p>
<p>The Government declared that it would crush the revolt. Along with tax inspectors, bands of <a href="../../../p/a/t/Pathans.html" title="Pathans">Pathans</a> were gathered from northwest India to forcibly seize the property of the villagers and terrorize them. The Pathans and the men of the collectors forced themselves into the houses, took all property, including cattle.</p>
<p>The government began to auction the houses and the lands. But not a single man from Gujarat or anywhere else in India came forward to buy them. Patel had appointed volunteers in every village to keep watch. As soon as he sighted the officials who were coming to auction the property, the volunteer would sound his bugle. The farmers would leave the village and hide in the jungles. The officials would find the entire village empty. They could never find out who owned a particular house.</p>
<p>However, some rich people from <a href="../../../b/o/m/Bombay.html" title="Bombay">Bombay</a> came to buy some lands. There was also one village recorded that paid the tax. A complete social boycott was organized against them, wherein relatives broke their ties to families in the village.</p>
<p>Members of the legislative councils of Bombay and across India were angered by the terrible treatment of the protesting farmers. Indian members resigned their offices, and expressed open support of the farmers. The Government was heavily criticized, even by many in the Raj's offices.</p>
<p><a name="Resolution" id="Resolution"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/r/Bardoli_Satyagraha_b4e9.html" title="Edit section: Resolution">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Resolution</span></h2>
<p>In 1928, an agreement was finally brokered by a <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parsi.html" title="Parsi">Parsi</a> member of the Bombay government. The Government agreed to restore the confiscated lands and properties, as well as cancel revenue payment not only for the year, but cancel the 30% raise until after the succeeding year.</p>
<p>The farmers celebrated their victory, but Patel continued to work to ensure that all lands and properties were returned to every farmer, and that no one was left out. When the Government refused to ask the people who had bought some of the lands to return them, wealthy sympathizers from Bombay bought them out, and returned the lands to the rightful owners.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/a/r/Bardoli_Satyagraha_b4e9.html" title="Edit section: Commemoration">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Commemoration</span></h2>
<p>The momentum from the Bardoli victory aided in the resurrection of the freedom struggle nationwide. In <a href="../../../1/9/3/1930.html" title="1930">1930</a>, the Congress would declare Indian independence, and the <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salt_Satyagraha_eb74.html" title="Salt Satyagraha">Salt Satyagraha</a> would be launched by Gandhi.</p>
<p>While Patel credited Gandhi's teachings and the farmers' undying resolve, people across the nation recognized his vital leadership. Gandhi and his fellow satyagrahis called him <i>Sardar</i> for the first time, which in <a href="../../../g/u/j/Gujarati_language.html" title="Gujarati language">Gujarati</a> and most Indian languages means <i>Chief</i> or <i>Leader</i>. It was after Bardoli that <i>Sardar Patel</i> became one of India's most important leaders.</p>
