<p>When I moved the NASCAR award off of the proposal page I made a mistake that I am trying to rectify. I am putting this notice here as an attempt to be open about this. You can see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Wikiproject_awards/Wikiproject&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=59211758" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Wikiproject_awards/Wikiproject&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=59211758" rel="nofollow">here</a> when I placed the NASCAR award on the WikiProject page. Because the award had limited support (Look <a href="../../../b/a/r/Wikipedia%7EBarnstar_and_award_proposals_Archive10_24d1.html#WikiProject_NASCAR_Award" title="Wikipedia:Barnstar and award proposals/Archive10">here</a> to see the archive) and was not star-like, it should have gone to the <a href="../../../p/u/a/WP%7EPUA_9bb4.html" title="WP:PUA">WP:PUA</a> page.</p>
<p>To date, the <a href="../../../n/a/s/Image%7ENASCARRepair.jpg_7069.html" title="Image:NASCARRepair.jpg">award</a> has only been awarded once, and the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_NASCAR_2025.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject NASCAR">Wikipedia:WikiProject NASCAR</a> has not listed the award on their page. Does anyone have an issue with this? --<a href="../../../e/v/r/User%7EEvrik_3a44.html" title="User:Evrik">evrik</a> 22:03, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I agree that it is too un-starlike for a WikiProject award. WikiProject NASCAR covers a wide span of articles, though, and my opinion is that the award should be redesigned. --<a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGray_Porpoise_faa8.html" title="User:Gray Porpoise">Gray Porpoise</a> 17:44, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

Award for a new user, who despite setbacks and learning curve (such as early deletions) learns the ropes and begins contributing. Sort of an encouragement to make sure good editors don't get frustrated early and leave.</p>
<p>I am thinking specifically here of a new editor who's first attempt was a translation, which was speedied half way through because it was not properly in user space. But he rewrote and finished it. I think a cookie is not enough recognition of the amount of work it takes a new user to learn all the little rules of WP.</p>
<p>And this award would be a nice offset when these sorts of things happen.</p>

<ul>
<li>If you look at the PUA page, you will see that many awards don't look like 'barnstars.' Also, right now the vote is whether or not to have this particular PUA rather than approving a particular image. Unfortunately, this Barnstar and award proposals page can be very confusing in that regard. --<a href="../../../j/u/a/User%7EJuanMuslim_e526.html" title="User:JuanMuslim">JuanMuslim</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/u/a/User%7EJuanMuslim_e526.html" title="User:JuanMuslim"><i>1m</i></a></sup> 03:17, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>PUA's dopn't need consensus or approval by the community. Anyone can post anything they want on that page, which is why it's an eclectic group. --<a href="../../../e/v/r/User%7EEvrik_3a44.html" title="User:Evrik">evrik</a> 14:33, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>This entire process is confusing. I mean even the current introduction to this page is a bit misleading because it leads one to believe PUA's must be voted on. <i>Barnstar and Award Proposals (BAP) is where Wikipedians offer and discuss ideas regarding the "standard" Barnstars, Wikiproject awards, Other Related Awards and Personal User Awards, which may include, but are not limited to: creation of a new barnstar, altering or changing an existing barnstar or award, or delisting an award entirely.</i></li>
<li>While there is no set policy, I brought the award here first because I'd like to see community approval before attempting to use it. To Juan: I was trying to figure out a way to incorporate a barnstar, but was unable to find anything that looked good. I think you may be on to something with your edit, but I think it might need a little word. Specifically, I'm not sure I like the wax-effect on the Cross. —<a href="../../../a/i/d/User%7EAiden_abfd.html" title="User:Aiden"><font color="#077CD0"><b>Aiden</b></font></a> 04:02, 9 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>And, what about the size and placement of the star and cross and fish? And colors? --<a href="../../../j/u/a/User%7EJuanMuslim_e526.html" title="User:JuanMuslim">JuanMuslim</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/u/a/User%7EJuanMuslim_e526.html" title="User:JuanMuslim"><i>1m</i></a></sup> 06:08, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Anyone can make a PUA, but since there is already a Christian-related award, don't you think you are reinventing the wheel?--<a href="../../../e/v/r/User%7EEvrik_3a44.html" title="User:Evrik">evrik</a> 01:40, 14 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I think the problem some Christians may have with the Saint's Star Award is that the award is more on the side of Catholicism with its reverence of Saints and all. Some Christians may also not like the Saint's Star Award because it doesn't include a cross.--<a href="../../../j/u/a/User%7EJuanMuslim_e526.html" title="User:JuanMuslim">JuanMuslim</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/u/a/User%7EJuanMuslim_e526.html" title="User:JuanMuslim"><i>1m</i></a></sup> 03:12, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The first proposal isn't at all bad, but it doesn't incorporate the barnstar motif in itself. Would it be possible to superimpose the red cross over the barnstar itself? If not, I could certainly go with image 1.

<li>I don't really see a need for it. We don't have an award for 'non-IP editors', IP ones can receive normal awards - although considering dynamic IP and that many IP contributors are not even aware they have a talk page, I don't really think awarding IP anything is a worthwile idea; rather, convince them to register and give them a '<a href="../../../o/t/h/Wikipedia%7EOther_awards_c564.html#The_Exceptional_Newcomer_Award" title="Wikipedia:Other awards">exeptional new user award</a>'.--<sub><span style="border:1px solid #228B22;padding:1px;"><a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPiotrus_27db.html" title="User:Piotrus">&#160;Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus&#160;</a>|<a href="../../../p/i/o/User_talk%7EPiotrus_217f.html" title="User talk:Piotrus"><font style="color:#7CFC00;background:#006400;">&#160;talk&#160;</font></a></span></sub> 17:21, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Every so often, a proposal for a barnstar to be given to an anon user comes up, and almost all the time, we've had consensus not to do so. I can't be bothered to look for the diffs, but some of the reasons for <b>opposing</b> this include: IP addresses are shared by several people, anonymous users prefer to stay anonymous, anyone who wants a barnstar should register anyway, and anonymous users have no ownership over their own user or user talk pages (technically, neither to registered users, but IPs own their pages much less than registered users do). --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">Deathphoenix</a> <a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>ʕ</b></a> 20:22, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Subsequent comments should be made in a new section. I want to start an award to appreciate an editor's work at reviewing FACs, which is a very hard work, and often quite thankless.

We can broaden the definition of <a href="../../../f/e/a/Template%7EFeatured_Article_Medal_f40a.html" title="Template:Featured Article Medal">Featured Article Medal</a>, but I would prefer not to do it. It is quite different to review articles than adding info to articles. Also, the FAM is historically associated with the idea of being a major contributor to featured articles, which this is not. In fact, quite naturally, this would mostly be given to those who oppose an FAC because of various shortfalls in the article, and many a times, due to their exceptional review, the article may not survive the FAC. Giving the FAM in this case would be wrong as the contribution had not led to an article being a featured article. If we want, we can broaden the definition of this award to span reviews of Featured List Candidates, and Featured Portal Candidates. — <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbuj.Saxena_7172.html" title="User:Ambuj.Saxena">Ambuj Saxena</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/b/User_talk%7EAmbuj.Saxena_ee93.html" title="User talk:Ambuj.Saxena">talk</a>) 04:45, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Support</b>. A great idea.

<li>It's just struck me that perhaps a barnstar just for Islam is a bit narrow. How about a barnstar which encompasses all religions and faith systems. It will also prevent the glut of "How come Islam gets a barnstar and such-and-suchism doesn't?" copycat barnstars on creation, and sidesteps the mosque/crescent issue. <font style="color:#BBBB00"><b>s</b>murrayinch</font><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><font style="color:green"><i><b>e</b></i></font></a><font style="color:#BBBB00">ster<sup>(<a href="../../../s/m/u/User%7ESmurrayinchester_f294.html" title="User:Smurrayinchester">User</a>), (<a href="../../../s/m/u/User_talk%7ESmurrayinchester_aa08.html" title="User talk:Smurrayinchester">Talk</a>)</sup></font> 09:04, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The Islamic Barnstar is exceptionally well designed and visually pleasing. I'd hate to see it changed... If anyone is concerned about the lack of Christian, Judaic, Hindu, etc. barnstars then an incentive exists for someone to create one!

<li><b>Comment</b> Everyone who votes here at the Barnstar and awards proposals page assumes it's like voting for articles or images for deletion, you know, vote support or oppose and move on. Right now the vote is whether or not to have this particular Wikiproject award rather than approving a particular image. Unfortunately, this Barnstar and award proposals page can be very confusing in that regard.--<a href="../../../j/u/a/User%7EJuanMuslim_e526.html" title="User:JuanMuslim">JuanMuslim</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/u/a/User%7EJuanMuslim_e526.html" title="User:JuanMuslim"><i>1m</i></a></sup> 01:59, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Support, looks nice, although I expect some may raise issues on how the 9 symbols were selected, and critique it for making some equal (or first), not including others. To avoid this I'd suggest we allow several images, and if people want to reorder the symbols or exchange them for others, let them do so.--<sub><span style="border:1px solid #228B22;padding:1px;"><a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPiotrus_27db.html" title="User:Piotrus">&#160;Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus&#160;</a>|<a href="../../../p/i/o/User_talk%7EPiotrus_217f.html" title="User talk:Piotrus"><font style="color:#7CFC00;background:#006400;">&#160;talk&#160;</font></a></span></sub> 17:35, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>This proposal has languished for more than two weeks. I'm going to archive it soon unless there is a groundswell of support. --<a href="../../../e/v/r/User%7EEvrik_3a44.html" title="User:Evrik">evrik</a> 14:11, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Support of award only</b> - If there are already at least a few barnstars for specific religions, their's no good reason to include images related to them in this barnstar.

<li>The "Star of David" is a poor choice, in my opinion. A quick look at the history of the "Star of David" (see <a href="http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/star.html" class="external text" title="http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/star.html" rel="nofollow">this page</a>) reveals that the star was first adopted by the Zionist movement in 1897. And the star only became strongly associated with Judaism from that point forward. Also, a literal translation is not "star" - it is "Shield of David"... I think a design with the <a href="../../../l/i/o/Lion_of_Judah_cc86.html" title="Lion of Judah">Lion of Judah</a> would be more appropriate, although a menorah would not be a bad choice. I don't particularly care for the menorah-based designs here.&#160;:( 75.21.68.196 20:04, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Another thought might be have a design that is some sort of <a href="../../../m/e/z/Mezuzah.html" title="Mezuzah">mezuzah</a> with a barnstar on it... 75.21.68.196 00:06, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I think that some version of the image is fine, but that the background should be transparent. Is there a lot of support in your WikiProject for this? --<a href="../../../e/v/r/User%7EEvrik_3a44.html" title="User:Evrik">evrik</a> 01:34, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>A transparent background is no problem. As far as interest, we have a very small Wikiproject, so I doubt there will be a flood of support. But I think that some kind of recognition really motivates people, and a Bluegrass Barnstar might just encourage a casual user to get a little more involved.<a href="../../../l/a/m/User%7ELamontacranston_0a5f.html" title="User:Lamontacranston">Lamont A Cranston</a> 02:07, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><br />
I've had this idea since the <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_Satchel_Cohen_hoaxer_be5b.html" title="User:Tyrenius/Satchel Cohen hoaxer">Satchel Cohen hoaxer</a> affair back in July of this year for which I handed out a "Defender of the Wiki" barnstar to Yanksox, Tyrenius and Kjkolb for their excellent detective work in exposing it. So the idea popped into my head that we need a "Sherlock Holmes" inspired barnstar for all editors who put in the extra legwork into discovering an entire ring of elaborate hoax articles and sockpuppets.</p>

This Barnstar is very different from the Photographer's Barnstar. This Barnstar is for those that find images for Wikipedia from other sources (internet, scans, etc.) and upload them on Wikipedia. Pictures from places like NASA are very useful to Wikipedia (many are Featured Pictures), but somebody has to find them an upload them first. Other find pictures on flickrs and such, which requires even more work, suchas emailing the user for permission. Many pictures on Wikipedia are not taken by Wikipedians, and credit is due to those who find those images. <b><i><a href="../../../n/a/u/User%7ENauticashades_7c1a.html" title="User:Nauticashades">Nautica</a></i><a href="../../../n/a/u/User_talk%7ENauticashades_63f5.html" title="User talk:Nauticashades"><font color="black">Shad</font></a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="black">e</font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_User%7ENauticashades_473d.html" title="Special:Contributions/User:Nauticashades"><font color="black">s</font></a></b> 22:06, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

I believe that linkspam is a serious threat to Wikpedia in the short to medium term.

I'm fairly new there but see some of the people have copped a lot of flack with no recognition. Fighting linkspam is not the same as dealing with simple vandalism, as it requires judgement and tact as to what is in fact spam and what is a worthy external link.</p>

<p>This probably isn't a great idea, but I suggest having a barnstar for those who start many articles that are needed but Wikipedia doesn't have a page on them yet. I only really thought of this because it does really apply to me, as I don't really do much but start articles that Wikipedia doesn't have but greatly needs.</p>

<p>I would like to make a proposal for a barnstar for the above named project, and possibly for <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Cat_breeds_a4d2.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Cat breeds">wikipedia:WikiProject Cat breeds</a> as well, if they find it acceptable. I regret to say that my own graphic abilities are severeley limited, if not in fact nonexistent. However, I would like to see a barnstar that has a black feline silhouette seen from behind (something along the lines of the Midnight Louie silhouette <a href="http://www.carolenelsondouglas.com/midnight-louie.html" class="external text" title="http://www.carolenelsondouglas.com/midnight-louie.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>, maybe a bit thinner though) apparently using the barnstar as a kind of scratching post. If anyone with any abilities would like to make such a draft design, I would be more than gratified. I would also welcome any other proposals. There are already several substantial contributions from editors dealing with the subject of felines, including featured articles, and I think that it's time that they were rewarded with a more specific barnstar. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadbilltucker_7b20.html" title="User:Badbilltucker">Badbilltucker</a> 13:14, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Oppose</b> per Evrik. Stubs are fine (and I've created plenty!) but should not be encouraged at the expense of quality. DYK fits the bill here - IMO, if the new article is not up to being DYK-worthy, its probably not worthy of justifying an award. —&#160;<a href="../../../m/o/o/User_talk%7EMoondyne_51fd.html" title="User talk:Moondyne">Moondyne</a> 05:58, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I understand your basis for opposition but the purpose of this award is to give it to those who think of imaginative stubs on a regular basis and contribute necessary/important new articles. Articles which, even though may not be full fledged yet, were beneficial to add to wikipedia and have a good meaty basis that may inspire it to be expanded.<font face="comic sans ms"><font color="purple"><i><b><a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPersian_Poet_Gal_d57f.html" title="User:Persian Poet Gal">¤~Persian Poet Gal</a></b></i></font></font> 00:33, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Well I still cannot understand how thats so different from a DYK medal. I've contributed several dozen DYK articles (and have been awarded accordingly) and your description above sounds similar to the criteria for DYK. I don't want to sound difficult, but your rationale is no clearer to me. Producing large numbers of stubs that aren't up to DYK standard (1000 characters - by way of comparison, this section is already 2500 characters) hardly seems something that we should make a special case of rewarding. Admittedly the DYK criteria specifically excludes stubs, but at least it sets some minimum standards. —&#160;<a href="../../../m/o/o/User_talk%7EMoondyne_51fd.html" title="User talk:Moondyne">Moondyne</a> 01:15, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Although in theory, the character limit is 1000 characters, I and most other updaters generally exclude anything that is less than 2000 characters in the main body, and most are well over 2000. As Jimbo exhorted at Wikimania, we need qaulity not quantity, and apparently only 30% of articles are more than 2kb. As there are a large percentage of articles which already are POV, unencyclopedic, etc, thie shows we have a real problem. <b><a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen">Blnguyen</a></b> (<a href="../../../b/l/n/User_talk%7EBlnguyen_584f.html" title="User talk:Blnguyen">bananabucket</a>) 01:20, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Those standards are definitely worth being adhered to but as an example "The Random Acts of Kindness Barnstar" awards those who show a pattern of kindness. Are there specified standards as to what those acts of kindness must meet, of course not. What I mean by creating quality stubs on a regular basis is not the quantity matter but the fact that they create new articles consistently which add on beneficially to Wikipedia <i>(but technically have not made them full-fledged)</i>. Now I admit the standards for this award are not set in stone but much like the example I provided above there are barnstars which standards are loose yet followed by.<font face="comic sans ms"><font color="purple"><i><b><a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPersian_Poet_Gal_d57f.html" title="User:Persian Poet Gal">¤~Persian Poet Gal</a></b></i></font></font> 01:29, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

I know that it needs work, perhaps in the color design of it. The size of the pixels in the image to make it look 8-bit are at my maximum preferred size. When I tried larger pixels, the image was just unpleasing. Should I tone down the sharpness of the original picture, or what?

<li><b>Support Edit 3</b> On reflection I think edit 2 is a bit crass and gaudy - whereas edit 3 is a subtle, wry take on the barnstar format - in the history of architecture there had to be an existing design for a building that actually resembled a barnstar.

<p>Subsequent comments should be made in a new section.</p>
<p>After seeing a number of comments about why the barnstar is called "The Working Man's Barnstar" (<a href="../../../t/h/e/Template_talk%7EThe_Working_Man%27s_Barnstar_38fd.html" title="Template talk:The Working Man's Barnstar">Template talk:The Working Man's Barnstar</a>, <a href="../../../w/m/b/Image_talk%7EWMBarnstar.png_51dd.html" title="Image talk:WMBarnstar.png">Image talk:WMBarnstar.png</a>), I decided to <a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBOLD_e2a0.html" title="WP:BOLD">be bold</a> and just change it to the gender neutral "Worker's Barnstar." I'd like to move the template, too, but am unsure what kind of havoc that would play on the system. Perhaps someone more knowledgeable than I can assist me?</p>
<p>It occurs to me that this could have been discussed and vetoed before. If WP consensus is still opposed to a change, I would like to propose a new barnstar called "The Worker's Barnstar" and have it in addition to the Working Man's Barnstar. This way, people can opt for a gender-netural award. (And do a little bit to fight <a href="../../../b/i/a/WP%7EBIAS_a5af.html" title="WP:BIAS">systemic bias</a>.) -- <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerope_5bcb.html" title="User:Merope"><b><font color="#003366">Merope</font></b></a> <small><sup><a href="../../../m/e/r/User_talk%7EMerope_f738.html" title="User talk:Merope"><font color="#003366">Talk</font></a></sup></small> 16:58, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>After having thought about it for a while. I'm reverting the edit. I think it was too bold, and done without the proper dioscussion. As for the award itself, I think that in many ways that {{<a href="../../../t/h/e/Template%7EThe_Working_Man%27s_Barnstar_2959.html" title="Template:The Working Man's Barnstar">The Working Man's Barnstar</a>}}, {{ <a href="../../../t/h/e/Template%7EThe_Tireless_Contributor_Barnstar_30b9.html" title="Template:The Tireless Contributor Barnstar">The Tireless Contributor Barnstar</a>}} and {{<a href="../../../t/h/e/Template%7EThe_Barnstar_of_Diligence_9e47.html" title="Template:The Barnstar of Diligence">The Barnstar of Diligence</a>}} are all duplicative.

<ul>
<li>I don't see much difference between WM and the Diligence Barnstar. My guess is that WM is for unglamorous work like wikifying, copyediting, etc., whereas Diligence is for ... hell, I don't know. But the Tireless Contributor award seems more geared towards writing than editing. I'd be perfectly happy if the Diligence and WM were conflated to one category. (In fact, when thinking of alternate names for "Working Man's", I thought of "Barnstar of Diligence" only to realize that that already existed. Perhaps that's telling.) -- <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerope_5bcb.html" title="User:Merope">Merope</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../m/e/r/User_talk%7EMerope_f738.html" title="User talk:Merope">Talk</a></sup></small> 15:29, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'll just make one quick statement: I don't think it's necessary to change the name. I believe this barnstar was created based on the term "working man" (I don't know for sure since this barnstar was created before I came on board). It's not meant to be offensive to women. --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">Deathphoenix</a> <a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>ʕ</b></a> 17:09, 6 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It's not <i>offensive</i> to women, it just <i>excludes</i> them. Think for a moment how you'd feel if you received an award that didn't even match your gender. Would a "Great Gal" award appeal to you? Granted, that's a stupid name, but I don't see a reason to have a deliberately exclusive term for an award. -- <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerope_5bcb.html" title="User:Merope">Merope</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../m/e/r/User_talk%7EMerope_f738.html" title="User talk:Merope">Talk</a></sup></small> 20:29, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Honestly, I like the idea of just having one barnstar called "The Barnstar of Diligence". The problem with having gender-specific categories is 1) not everyone's gender is identifiable by their contributions and 2) it presupposes a binary system of gender (and thus ignores <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genderqueer.html" title="Genderqueer">genderqueer</a> individuals). Someone giving an award shouldn't have to figure out a person's gender identity; that kinda defeats the purpose. I understand that "working man" is a popular slang term, I just think it's outdated and exclusive to use. -- <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerope_5bcb.html" title="User:Merope">Merope</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../m/e/r/User_talk%7EMerope_f738.html" title="User talk:Merope">Talk</a></sup></small> 20:44, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>I renamed the barnstar to "Working Person's Barnstar" at Template:Barnstars before noticing the discussion here. I don't think it's a big deal, but "Working Man's Barnstar" sticks out as an obviously non-neutral term, especially in an award that's supposed to be a positive gesture rather than a source of controversy. ―<a href="../../../w/m/a/User%7EWmahan_ede0.html" title="User:Wmahan">Wmahan</a><a href="../../../w/m/a/User_talk%7EWmahan_c490.html" title="User talk:Wmahan">.</a> 19:24, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>This whole discussion lacks a good sense of humor, and smack of being <a href="../../../p/o/l/Political_correctness.html" title="Political correctness">PC</a>. Does anyone besides Merope really object to this? I personally don't think that it is <a href="../../../p/o/v/POV_3e50.html" title="POV">POV</a>. To me, this is a niggling little issue, but I also think that the award is redundant. I think that if we are going to change the name, we should rewrite the definition to separate it from the Barnstar of Diligence.</li>

<dd>I agree that the award is redundant, and I think that the whole problem could be solved by combining the two awards and having just the Barnstar of Diligence. I can't think of how the two awards are distinguished from one another, and furthermore, I can't think of how we could <i>create</i> a distinction between them. As for other people really objecting, the fact that someone other than myself changed it should answer that.

<li>This is the first time I heard a discussion about the name being offensive, though many people seem to have gotten this barnstar and no issues I heard so far.

<li>I've looked over the various arguments and proposals, and here's the best idea the I have to offer. It is understood by most that we have three stars that, at the minimum, cross somewhat in their scope: {{<a href="../../../t/h/e/Template%7EThe_Working_Man%27s_Barnstar_2959.html" title="Template:The Working Man's Barnstar">The Working Man's Barnstar</a>}}, {{ <a href="../../../t/h/e/Template%7EThe_Tireless_Contributor_Barnstar_30b9.html" title="Template:The Tireless Contributor Barnstar">The Tireless Contributor Barnstar</a>}} and {{<a href="../../../t/h/e/Template%7EThe_Barnstar_of_Diligence_9e47.html" title="Template:The Barnstar of Diligence">The Barnstar of Diligence</a>}}, therefore I propose that we collapse these three barnstars into two, in the following way:
<ol>
<li>{{<a href="../../../t/h/e/Template%7EThe_Working_Man%27s_Barnstar_2959.html" title="Template:The Working Man's Barnstar">The Working Man's Barnstar</a>}} should be retired from the "official" roster. Any effort to shoehorn its name into something politically correct will come across as awkward and artificial anyway, as such things tend to do.</li>
<li>{{ <a href="../../../t/h/e/Template%7EThe_Tireless_Contributor_Barnstar_30b9.html" title="Template:The Tireless Contributor Barnstar">The Tireless Contributor Barnstar</a>}} should continue to be awarded in recognition of extraordinary <i>quantity</i> without sacrificing quality ("tireless Wikipedians who contribute an especially large body of work without sacrificing quality").</li>
<li>{{<a href="../../../t/h/e/Template%7EThe_Barnstar_of_Diligence_9e47.html" title="Template:The Barnstar of Diligence">The Barnstar of Diligence</a>}} should be modified slightly, so that it is awarded to recognize extraordinary <i>quality, scrutiny, and/or precision</i>. In this way it will complement the Tireless Contributor Barnstar instead of conflicting with it.</li>

<dd>I heartily agree with this proposal. Even though I favor a gender inclusive name (and, no, "man" is not <a href="../../../g/e/n/Gender-neutral_language_in_English_4d8c.html" title="Gender-neutral language in English">gender-inclusive</a>), I wince at some of the suggestions because they sound too PC. ("Working Person" in particular bothers me, and "Worker" sounds like an award given in Soviet Russia.) In poking through about three dozen instances of the Diligence awards on userpages, it doesn't seem to be used solely for improving the Wikipedian community, as Deathphoenix claims. In my randomly selected group, it was awarded for as many different things as copyediting, sockpuppet investigation, fixing templates, admin coaching, AfD participation, editor reviews, deletions, using English well (?!), and, most frequently, for "your hard work." I see no harm in expanding the definition to include people who perform some of the least glamorous chores on WP. Perhaps conflating the two categories will further the notion that their efforts are valuable to the encyclopedia. -- <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerope_5bcb.html" title="User:Merope">Merope</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../m/e/r/User_talk%7EMerope_f738.html" title="User talk:Merope">Talk</a></sup></small> 22:02, 10 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, those are the originally-conceived use of these barnstars, even if people award them in other manners. One of the good things about barnstars is that it's relatively informal: people are free to award whatever barnstars they want, to whoever they want, for whatever reason they want, even if it's contrary to the barnstar description (though it gets confusing for the awardee!). --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">Deathphoenix</a> <a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>ʕ</b></a> 18:58, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I personally like the "Working Man's Barnstar". It's an old and common phrase that still denotes hard work ethic and determination. It's not offensive in any way and should be taken as a compliment not as a misogynist insult. There isn't a better or more common phrase in the English language to represent the same exceptional qualities. If one can find such a phrase than I'd support it. - <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatman2648_01fe.html" title="User:Patman2648">Patman2648</a> 22:33, 10 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Again, let me reiterate: I have never claimed that it is <b>offensive</b>. I do not think that it is misogynist. What I do maintain is that in a project with members who do not identify as "man", it makes sense <b>not</b> to have an award that is thus named.

<p><b>as the creator of the <i>barnstar of diligence</i></b> I'd like to point out that it's just another barnstar, and it doesn't really matter what it's awarded for. The point of a barnstar is to spread wikilove, and show some appreciation for another editor who has done something that's worth recognising. As for gender neutrality, I happen to be of the gender that has one broken X chromosome and one unbroken one -- I'm a man -- but I'd be pleased as punch to receive a barnstar called the 'Good Gal Award' or any other "female" award, an award is an award and it's the thought that counts. I'm pretty much against any codification or reorganising awards in any way. In my opinion <a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBOLD_e2a0.html" title="WP:BOLD">being bold</a> includes creating a new award for anything, any time it suits you, and give them away like Mardi Gras beads if you want.

<p>I find this "political correctness" debate to be somewhat silly and not inline with wikipedias aproach to these awards, that they are no big deal. I however feel "man" can be replaced with "wikipedian" since <i>man</i> doesn't seems ambigious enough for some. In otherwords a "Working Wikipedians Award" or "Hardworking Wikipedians Award".</p>
<p>The barnstar of Diligence and WMB should stay as two seperate awards. It probably is prudent to estabish what they are for in greater detail.</p>

<dd>Ummm. I'm struggling with the idea that gender-inclusiveness must always and everywhere mean gender-neutral. I'm all in favor of inclusiveness. I'm against gender-neutral. Being called a "working man" is a high compliment to a man (and may be to a woman; I wouldn't know). <b>Strongly oppose</b> retiring this barnstar <b>or</b> renaming it. Inclusiveness is achieved by <b>increasing</b> otions, not <i>reducing</i> and them. If you don't want to rec'v a working man barnstar, then design one that is more agreeable to your taste; don't dictate to other people what they are not permitted to buy/choose/wear/display. Is the world supposed to be limited to all and only those things that are agreeable to you?

<p>"Working MAN" is not NPOV. It should be gender-neutral, and I find it offensive that men seem to jump to knee-jerk conclusions (putting a negative stamp of supposed PC gone wrong, whereas gender equality is a basic human right) about "man" including "woman", because it DOES NOT. How would you <i>men</i> feel if you were awarded the "Working Woman's" star, eh? Because grammatically speaking, "woman" includes "man" (let alone biologically speaking--it's the <i>women</i> who carry the male babies out into this world), not the other way around. It would probably offend men. Besides, as we've been told time and time again in my Uni (<a href="../../../b/a/t/Bath_Spa_University_01f5.html" title="Bath Spa University">Bath Spa University</a>) by our professors, inclusive language is a sign of high-quality academic writing, so I agree with Cool Cat in that it should just be renamed to "Hard-working Wikipedian's" star. That includes everyone and doesn't piss us hard-working females off.

<dd>This seems to be the policy in the face of no consensus, but I'm amazed it doesn't appear possible to agree on a gender-neutral name that doesn't sound politically correct. The first alternative I see above, for example – "Hard-working Wikipedian" in <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowgrouse_bd3e.html" title="User:Snowgrouse">Snowgrouse</a>'s post – seems appropriate, so there's probably others as well.

<li>Seems to me the LGBT Barnstar fits right in on the Barnstar page under Topical Barnstars. If there are Barnstars given for sports articles, Current Events, Economics or even making templates, for God's sake, then there is certainly room for a LGBT Barnstar. Further, there are hundreds of LGBT articles, and the category is expanding. There are also many LGBT participants on Wikipedia who don't necessarily edit on LGBT topics, but contribute a great deal to Wiki. These are all valid reasons to have a LGBT Barnstar. I have already placed this Barnstar on a user's page, for their contribution in a gay related mediation (I note that the image tag allows copying), and received a very pleased reaction. Even if it is not adopted by Wikipedia, I will continue to use it as my own personal LGBT Barnstar to give out. <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffpw_23d5.html" title="User:Jeffpw">Jeffpw</a> 20:02, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comments</b> Dev, try not to single out evrik. Evrik is just trying to make sure that the barnstars contributed to Wikipedia are generally approved by the community and are a good addition to the Wikipedia awards offered. Most of his criticisms are meant to be constructive ones and they are not only meant to challenge the proposals but to make them better elaborate on the merit of adding the barnstar.

<li><b>Support 1 or 1 (sharpened)</b> as Wikiproject award; it is broad enough to be a Wikiproject award, but is probably too narrow to be a full blown barnstar; we reserve those only for the most wide reaching topics; Science or Society are both very broad, while LGBT is really a subcategory of Society. <a href="../../../s/m/u/User%7ESmurrayinchester_f294.html" title="User:Smurrayinchester"><span style="color:#BBBB00">La</span></a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><i><b><span style="color:green">ï</span></b></i></a><a href="../../../s/m/u/User_talk%7ESmurrayinchester_aa08.html" title="User talk:Smurrayinchester"><span style="color:#BBBB00">ka</span></a> 10:54, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>True, but then so is the Business and Economics Barnstar, and that's in existence. In my opinion, LGBT studies encompasses every LGBT person, movement, event and about half of the sexuality articles. This is a massive and vast array of articles, and I think should have a barnstar. <a href="../../../d/e/v/User%7EDev920_f8f8.html" title="User:Dev920">Dev920</a> (Have a nice day!) 12:47, 18 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Please don't forget the Template making Barnstar, Dev. That's even narrower than the Economics one. I fail to see why a section of Wiki that has hundreds of articles is getting opposition about having its own Barnstar. I note that evrik proposed a "Human Rights" Barnstar, and there are far less articles in that category than in LGBT. So I guess my question is: Why the double standard?<a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffpw_23d5.html" title="User:Jeffpw">Jeffpw</a> 14:21, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>No double standard ... the star itself was already in use and approved as the WikiProject Award for Philadelphia issues. --<a href="../../../e/v/r/User%7EEvrik_3a44.html" title="User:Evrik">evrik</a>&#160;<sup>(<a href="../../../e/v/r/User_talk%7EEvrik_9dfe.html" title="User talk:Evrik">talk</a>)</sup> 16:07, 18 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>In looking at the category the the Barnstar of Liberty addresses, I saw approx 260 articles. The LGBT category has roughly 1500. Let me rephrase my question: Why is the Human Rights catefory not considered too narrow for a Barnstar, but the LGBT category is? I'm going to have a look at the economics Barnstar now, but I am reasonably sure it will also have less articles related to it. <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffpw_23d5.html" title="User:Jeffpw">Jeffpw</a> 16:44, 18 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It seems to be Human rights star which is the anamoly here, not LGBT star. Comics has at least 7,886, Aircraft over 2,100 articles; Architecture and Computing likewise cover 1,000s and 1,000s of topics, yet none of these are Barnstars. Besides this, I can count at least 600 human rights articles, and <a href="../../../c/o/m/Category%7ECompanies_of_the_United_States_5917.html" title="Category:Companies of the United States">Category:Companies of the United States</a> alone contains well in excess of 1,000 articles; I'd guess that Economics and Business could apply to well over 15,000 articles at least... Wikiproject Trains was rejected even a Wikiproject star, and they have over 7,000 articles. As you can see; 1,500 is actually fairly small even for a WP award. Nevertheless, I agree that it is an important part of culture, which is why I didn't recommend it become a Personal User Award as I would have with most similar awards. <a href="../../../s/m/u/User%7ESmurrayinchester_f294.html" title="User:Smurrayinchester"><span style="color:#00BB55">La</span></a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><i><b><span style="color:green">ï</span></b></i></a><a href="../../../s/m/u/User_talk%7ESmurrayinchester_aa08.html" title="User talk:Smurrayinchester"><span style="color:#00BB55">ka</span></a> 19:27, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Support</b> <b>only as a project award</b> - As it deals with only a comparatively small section of the larger subject of anthropology. I note that there is a large project dealing with this subject, but that does not mean that a project of similar size and activity covering business, economics, human rights, or similar larger issues would not have as many articles. Number of articles is not the determining criteria here, but the broadness of the field itself. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadbilltucker_7b20.html" title="User:Badbilltucker">Badbilltucker</a> 17:47, 18 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Perhaps I don't understand you, Badbilltucker. The "field" of LBGT encompasses approx 250-500 million people on the planet. How much larger does this field have to be in order to be seen as important enough for a Barnstar?<a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffpw_23d5.html" title="User:Jeffpw">Jeffpw</a> 18:09, 18 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>One could just as easily say the "field" of insects covers several trillion insects, the "field" of foodservice covers a field probably as big, if not bigger, than this proposed award, and the "field" of astronomy covers an infinite number of astronomical objects, using each of these as cause for a general barnstar in each case. The number of articles is only related to the number of editors working on the subject, not the breadth and scope of the subject itself. Any groups of similar size dealing with any of these other subjects could doubtless produce more articles of generally at least the same level of significance. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadbilltucker_7b20.html" title="User:Badbilltucker">Badbilltucker</a> 18:24, 18 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Badbilltucker, I'm not sure you have an complete picture of what LGBT studies on Wiki actually is doing. If you look at the category and topics, you will see it is not only about political issues, but about the arts, sciences, law, religion, media, language and many other sub-topics. In short, it is a very broad-based project that branches into most other areas of Wiki--a microcosm of the real world, actually. That is why I feel that a <b>topical</b> LGBT Barnstar is both welcome and necessary.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If, after consensus is reached (which I don't see at all right now), the decision is taken to have this as a Project award, I will happily agree to it--providing, of course, that it is still called a LGBT Barnstar. That was the compromise that was reached with the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_awards_59f5.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject awards">Scouting Barnstar</a>, and I think we can all agree that Wiki needs to be consistent in its policies.</p>
<p>Lastly, I would hope that all people interested in discussing this topic would return to civility. I find it ironic that a Barnstar, which should be something positive, is becoming the catalyst for some unpleasant bickering. For the record, I feel that you've been discourteous to Dev, and evrik (until this evening) was the only one who was objecting to this nomination. If you read the thread all the way through, you will see he objected to one thing after another, finding something new to object to after the previous objections were appeased. My assumption of good faith is being sorely tested. <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffpw_23d5.html" title="User:Jeffpw">Jeffpw</a> 21:20, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The two week discussion period is now up! There are currently 8 editors in favour of a barnstar (Dev920, Ouro, Cocoaguy, Springargh, Herostratus, Jeffpw, Deathphoenix, and Vertium), 3 for a Wikiproject award (evrik, smurrayinchester, and badbilltucker), and 4 (Caveatlector, Yonmei, Ashadeofgrey, catout, SatyrTN, and Tasc) whose contributions have been about the design and not the type. By my count were 9 supports of Design 1, 4 supports for Design 1(sharpened), 1 support for Design 2 and 3 supports for Design 3. I think a Design 1 Barnstar has it. I will add it to the Barnstar page now. <a href="../../../d/e/v/User%7EDev920_f8f8.html" title="User:Dev920">Dev920</a> (Have a nice day!) 09:26, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Oppose</b> Oh, and thank you very much for informing me of this proposed removal. The barnstar isn't thanking someone gay, anymore than than the Scouting barnstar is about congratulating Scouts. It's for people who have made notable contributions to LGBT-related articles, which is a broad enough field to merit its own barnstar. Read the text: <i>The LGBT Barnstar is awarded to editors who make significant contributions that expand Wikipedia’s knowledge about homosexuality, bisexuality, transexuality, LGBT life and culture, notable LGBT people, events and movements, sociological issues, and population statistics.</i> That's a big area, covering hundreds of anthropological fields. And that was the point I made when I proposed it. Futhermore, the proposal was not "forced through", it simply lasted the recommended period of time, two weeks, instead of just hanging around until evrik decided to archive. I fail to see how sticking to the guidelines is somehow forcing through a proposal. The level of support was the normal amount for a Barnstar proposal, and I made this summary: <i>The two week discussion period is now up! There are currently 8 editors in favour of a barnstar (Dev920, Ouro, Cocoaguy, Springargh, Herostratus, Jeffpw, Deathphoenix, and Vertium), 3 for a Wikiproject award (evrik, smurrayinchester, and badbilltucker), and 4 (Caveatlector, Yonmei, Ashadeofgrey, catout, SatyrTN, and Tasc) whose contributions have been about the design and not the type.</i> As far as I recall, 8 vs. 3 is a majority of 72% and that's not counting what the 4 other voter's views may have been. There is nothing wrong with this barnstar, process was followed and consensus achieved. <a href="../../../d/e/v/User%7EDev920_f8f8.html" title="User:Dev920">Dev920</a> (Have a nice day!) 10:02, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Oppose</b> delisting. This Barnstar is given anybody, regardless of their sexual orientation, for contributions they have made to LGBT articles on Wiki. As such, it's broad enough in scope to warrant being a barnstar and not a project award. LGBT articles are not just edited by LGBT project members. This Barnstar has been given to at least one (that I know of) heterosexual editor who is not a project member. Further, I take umbrage to the comments of both <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Philly_be61.html" title="South Philly">South Philly</a> and <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indolence.html" title="Indolence">Indolence</a>. Dev has debunked South Philly's comments, so I shan't say much, except that if s/he was opposed to this Barnstar, s/he should have stated the opposition at the time, and not months after it was passed with consensus. Indolence, I have found that people usually are aware that they are bing offensive when they say "I don't mean to be offensive". PLease see <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIV_e5ff.html" title="WP:CIV">WP:CIV</a> before posting more comments like those you made above. Further, if you don't know under which circumstances this Barnstar is given, then you probably aren't in any position to make intelligent commentary about its validity here. <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffpw_23d5.html" title="User:Jeffpw">Jeffpw</a> 11:14, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Oppose</b> delisting. Barnstar is given to anyone who makes important contributions to LGBT articles, regardless of sexual orientation and/or belonging to the LGBT project. Not everyone who edits a LGBT article belongs to the LGBT project (in fact, I'd say most don't). It certainly isn't given to someone for being gay, as Indolence says.

<li><b>Oppose</b> delisting. A barnstar for work on LGBT-related articles is a perfectly valid idea, and should in theory be unrelated to the contributor's own sexual orientation. <i>If</i> it's being awarded for "being gay" (something for which I see no evidence), that's a matter to be discussed with the people giving out the award, not a reason for delisting the barnstar altogether. —<a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJosiah_Rowe_4f72.html" title="User:Josiah Rowe">Josiah Rowe</a> <small>(<a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJosiah_Rowe_ba00.html" title="User talk:Josiah Rowe">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Josiah_Rowe_5f31.html" title="Special:Contributions/Josiah Rowe">contribs</a>)</small> 15:10, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Right now there is no specific award to be given to people who engage in assessments of articles for the various projects, although several have begun such assessments. <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Virginia_Assessment_0c2d.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Virginia/Assessment">Wikipedia:WikiProject Virginia/Assessment</a> is one of several pages dealing with the subject. Several of the assessors, including myself, work to assess articles of more than one project, and, on that basis, engage in work which very well might not qualify for any specific project's award, although it would possibly/probably be considered of importance to wikipedia in a larger sense. I only included the link to at least one proposed recipient to make it clear I was in no way looking to make an award for myself, which I don't think I would deserve in any event. And, given the similarity of the work of reviewers and assessors, I thought that it would be easiest to just expand the "scope" of this one award to include those deserving of awards for assessments.

<dd><b>Question</b> - I'm serious here. How do you define "wildlife" in this instance? Are you referring only to species found primarily in the wild, or also to other species (horses, dogs, cats, rabbits, whatever) which also appear frequently in relation to human society? My reason for asking is that, at this point, I know of no barnstars which can be awarded for these more domesticated species, and think that that situation should probably be rectified. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadbilltucker_7b20.html" title="User:Badbilltucker">Badbilltucker</a> 20:25, 3 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>Yes I realize that the primary focus in the proposal is animals however notice "habitat" in the description. Animal habitats refer as well to the ecosystems, plants, and other living things that are contained in their environment. If the name is misleading I allow those involoved to vote for a name better suited for the barnstar if it is a major problem.<font face="comic sans ms"><font color="purple"><i><b><a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPersian_Poet_Gal_d57f.html" title="User:Persian Poet Gal">¤~Persian Poet Gal</a></b></i></font></font> <a href="../../../p/e/r/User_talk%7EPersian_Poet_Gal_f352.html" title="User talk:Persian Poet Gal"><font color="purple"><sup>(talk)</sup></font></a> 23:08, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>No, everything about it is about animals, only habitats as they relate to animals are included (animal... habitats), and all the arms of the star are about animals, or so it seems. If it is about wildlife the entire focus should not be about animals. If it's about "animals only" it should be called the zoologist's barnstar, not the wildlife one. It's either wildlife and there's more than a single passing and off-hand reference to plants, with no visual representation of the plant world, or it's about zoology. This one is, thus far, about zoology, not wildlife. And if it is about animal habitats, really, then it includes all sorts of things that aren't wildlife in addition, like the waters of the ocean--and maybe there are some awesome marine geologists who should get a wildlife barnstar. It has a nice sound to it, and is attractive in relation to its name, however its name already means something different than what is intended by the descirption and visualization, so, yes it is misleading. <a href="../../../k/p/_/User%7EKP_Botany_94ec.html" title="User:KP Botany">KP Botany</a> 23:41, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Alright then, a rename might be the best solution. Adding on to the description would seem a bit contradictory as you pointed out due to the design. It is not exactly easy to encompass a design which will visually satisfy all that you describe. As one minor note, retrofitting this award to include plants/living things might confuse it with the pre-existing Bio-star (as concerns have been raised above), which is what I'm trying to avoid, seeing as this is aiming to be more select to that field of biology. So, all that being said, it can easily be discussed to rename the barnstar or someone can propose their design which will visually satisfy a description that includes plants/living things. Either way I hope to see editors get the chance to recieve recognition with this kind of barnstar.<font face="comic sans ms"><font color="purple"><i><b><a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPersian_Poet_Gal_d57f.html" title="User:Persian Poet Gal">¤~Persian Poet Gal</a></b></i></font></font> <a href="../../../p/e/r/User_talk%7EPersian_Poet_Gal_f352.html" title="User talk:Persian Poet Gal"><font color="purple"><sup>(talk)</sup></font></a> 23:55, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

I recently did a SuggestBot request (<a href="../../../s/u/g/User%7ESuggestBot_Requests_7654.html" title="User:SuggestBot/Requests">the SuggestBot request page</a>) and was crushed by the low quality of some of the animal articles it recommended for me to work on, and with some of the related articles I looked at. I can't find information anywhere about the Bio-star, though, so it wouldn't conflict with a non-existing barnstar--maybe it once existed, but no more. <a href="../../../k/p/_/User%7EKP_Botany_94ec.html" title="User:KP Botany">KP Botany</a> 16:48, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>The OED defines wildlife thus "<b>noun</b> the native fauna (and sometimes flora) of a region". I think we should stick with the common usage of <i>fauna</i>. I am not convinced that we should include domesticated animals, perhaps there would be scope for another barnstar for that category as I believe there may be for plants if people feel that strongly about it. I do not like the word zoology in this context because of the implications regarding keeping animals for display etc. If we really do feel we need to change the name, perhaps we could call it the Fauna (or perhaps Faunal) Barnstar. Then there would be no confusion. <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENick_Thorne_fd99.html" title="User:Nick Thorne">Nick Thorne</a> 20:52, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Support</b> in ascending order, 4 alternate, 5, and 5 alternate as best choices. <b>Support</b> in ascending order, Animal Barnstar, Fauna Barnstar, and Wildlife Barnstar. While I acknowledge that Animal Barnstar is most obvious, it is also the hardest to define, and I think Wildlife, although occasionally inaccurate, does the best job of conveying the intended scope of the barnstar. Oppose name Zoologist Barnstar as it seems to me that the name could be seen as making it apply only to those who work on articles relating directly to <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marlin_Perkins_f6f0.html" title="Marlin Perkins">Marlin Perkins</a> and other zoologists. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadbilltucker_7b20.html" title="User:Badbilltucker">Badbilltucker</a> 15:15, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - If someone can come up with a specific term which includes almost all animalia but also clearly rules out the inclusion of homo sapiens, that would clearly be best, I think, given that I don't think this barnstar is intended to be applied to people. And I thought by the inclusion of only animal related items in the barnstar picture that it was clearly only applying to animalia. Also, I personally would support a different Plant Barnstar, or maybe Tree of Life Barnstar, if someone were to propose it. The Plants might count only as a project barnstar, maybe, as <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Plants_b3f9.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Plants">Wikipedia:WikiProject Plants</a> deals with the entire scope of the proposed barnstar, but it would still be a specifically available barnstar. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadbilltucker_7b20.html" title="User:Badbilltucker">Badbilltucker</a> 17:09, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

Also as one minor note, I tweaked the description in the revision to make sure people understand it is mainly for awarding animal-related contributions.<a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPersian_Poet_Gal_d57f.html" title="User:Persian Poet Gal"><font face="comic sans ms"><font color="purple"><i><b>¤~Persian Poet Gal</b></i></font></font></a> <a href="../../../p/e/r/User_talk%7EPersian_Poet_Gal_f352.html" title="User talk:Persian Poet Gal"><font color="purple"><sup>(talk)</sup></font></a> 17:36, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
