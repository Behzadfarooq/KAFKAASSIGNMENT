<h2><span class="mw-headline">Re: Revert</span></h2>
<p>Baris, I will accept your revert on the title of the section, but not on its content. I realize that this isn't about the history of Turkey, but the earlier version of this section seemed to be more slanted towards the Turkish POV (that Armenian Genocide was a civil war and that there were deaths on both sides and that Armenia was actively at war with Azerbaijan during the Karabakh conflict). I was very even handed in my approach to writing this mentioning both the Armenian and Turkish positions. I also did not create the Pakistan section (I don't know who did), so you can remove it. -- <a href="../../../c/l/e/User%7EClevelander_3c35.html" title="User:Clevelander">Clevelander</a> 23:54, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Actually, why not place Russia in a section seperate from the South Caucasus? I realize that you think that the South Caucasus may not be as important to Turkey as Russia, but I believe that they are crucial enough to garner their own section. -- <a href="../../../c/l/e/User%7EClevelander_3c35.html" title="User:Clevelander">Clevelander</a> 23:58, 17 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Ok I will delete the Turkish version of events, they shouldn't be in there either. Nagorno-Karabakh could be mentioned I suppose. However it shouldn't be a whole list of events either..

<p>Yes I am aware of what the tags are used for, and you shouldn't be removing a "POV <b>check</b>" tag when an editor has nominated an article to be checked for its neutrality, what you're doing is both disruptive and rude. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMardavich_3f4a.html" title="User:Mardavich">Mardavich</a> 06:28, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>You don't know what the tag is used for I am afraid, and calling me disruptive and rude for pointing it out is extremely unfair. Did you read this <a href="../../../p/o/v/Wikipedia%7EPOV_check_6a08.html" title="Wikipedia:POV check">Wikipedia:POV check</a>? I don't think you have. The policy says "The POV check template, {POV-check}, may be added to an article which you feel may need to be edited to comply with Wikipedia's neutral point of view policy. Add the template at the top of the article, and <b>then explain your reasons on the talk page of the article that needs checking (not the talk pages of the template or this article)</b>."</p>
<p>Don't worry, I am extremely well aware of how Wikipedia works, and I couldn't see anything in the talk page. There needs to be a detailed explanation of the disagreements, <b>otherwise such placement of template <i>is</i> what is disruptive</b>. I hope that you will agree with this? That template as is was used for harrassment of the article instead of some legitimate encyclopedic behavior. Tags without explanations, or talk pages without discussions are grounds for the <i>immediate</i> removal of such tags. Please keep that in mind. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaristarim_c144.html" title="User:Baristarim">Baristarim</a> 06:41, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>?? Of course you can nominate it, but you have to explain your reasons in a detailed way in the talk page. Read applicable Wiki policies, instead of calling me rude or disruptive. Cut down on the incivility. If the person making the nomination doesn't explain his reasons in the talk page, <b>the tag will be taken down per Wiki policy as pointed out above</b>, is that clear enough? Instead of apologizing and admitting that I actually knew the policy and you didn't, and as such, you falsely accused me of being disruptive and rude, when in fact it was people who were putting it in without any notes on the talk page were disruptive, you left an even nastier note on my talk page!

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Turkish Statistical Institute</span></h2>
<p>Hi, I am aware that the name they are using is a bit awkward. But I believe that it's not up to us to discuss what the appropriate English title of the institute ought to be. If the institute calls itself the "Turkish Statistical Institute", we can only report that exactly as it is. <a href="../../../a/t/i/User%7EAtilimGunesBaydin_6556.html" title="User:AtilimGunesBaydin">Atilim Gunes Baydin</a> 17:44, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>But, at the same time, I was expecting that they won't be consistent with the English name they are using, like the case with many government offices in Turkey. You see, <a href="http://www.turkstat.gov.tr/sis-bil.html" class="external text" title="http://www.turkstat.gov.tr/sis-bil.html" rel="nofollow">here</a> they use the better sounding name of State Institute of Statistics. But I think we should go with the usage in their main publication, the statistics yearbook (<a href="http://www.turkstat.gov.tr/yillik.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.turkstat.gov.tr/yillik.pdf" rel="nofollow">here is the pdf, both in English and Turkish</a>) which uses "Turkish Statistical Institute". I don't think the English site is very comprehensive though.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">French Law</span></h2>
<p>Hi there</p>
<p>I have begun to act on cutting out the fat in the <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">France</a> article whilst adding in necessary sections (if one follows other country FA's). I noted on your user page that you are a lawyer and live in France, I therefore presume that you know something about French law. As the article <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_Law_8cca.html" title="French Law">French Law</a> is rather poor, I was wondering if you could write a short summary on this topic in the <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html#Law" title="France">France#Law</a> subsection. Thanks. --<a href="../../../g/r/c/User%7EGrcampbell_a0e7.html" title="User:Grcampbell">Bob</a> 18:30, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Pan-Turkist POV</span></h2>
<p>The <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germanic_Europe_085c.html" title="Germanic Europe">Germanic Europe</a> article is quite something different than the POV of <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Turkic_states_3a92.html" title="List of Turkic states">List of Turkic states</a>. The Germanic Europe article is only naming the Germanic-speaking countries of Europe, and does not lay claims on countless historical governments.</p>
<p>It ios NOT a "Germanic World" article trying to push for nationalistic POV, like "USA, Australia, Europeans are all Germanics and united in their Germanic identity".</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Turkic_states_3a92.html" title="List of Turkic states">List of Turkic states</a> is a total POV article.</p>
<p>Why don't you just create an article "List of Turkic countries" and only sum up the present Turkic states, WITHOUT the usual Pan-Turkist POV about "all civilization comes from Turks" BS?! It would also be good to mention the large numbers of Non-Turkic minorities in those countries, because unlike European nations, Asian states are a conglomeration of different ethnicities (just for the case that you do not know it: this multi-ethnic character is also the reason why the USA cannot be considered a "Germanic nation"!)</p>

<dd>I will just repeat what I said before.. "These are your words: <b>there are no articles called <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Germanic_states_c659.html" title="List of Germanic states">List of Germanic states</a> (containing <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germany.html" title="Germany">Germany</a>, <a href="../../../u/s/a/USA_f75d.html" title="USA">USA</a>, <a href="../../../u/k/_/UK_7642.html" title="UK">UK</a>, etc) or a <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Slavic_states_d48e.html" title="List of Slavic states">List of Slavic states</a> (containing <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russia.html" title="Russia">Russia</a>, <a href="../../../b/u/l/Bulgaria.html" title="Bulgaria">Bulgaria</a>, etc) either ...</b> " I am not going to take seriously the arguments of someone who was insulting others by calling them pan-turkist on the premise that there were no "list of slavic states (containing Russia, Bulgaria) etc." The utter proval of the falsity of your god-like affirmations stops me from lending any type of credibility to any of your arguments any more, nor can I assume good faith. There is a list of states that group Bulgaria and Russia, and your god-like affirmations have been proven to be utterly false. You might at least apologize for your propagation of un-truths, it is called disruption. Europe is also a mix of ethnicities, what r u talking about? Basques, Slavs, Nordmen, Latins, Hellenes, Celts etc. The level of non-academic character of your arguments is so low that do not even try to take others to take your arguments seriously. Slavic Europe clearly mentions "Austria-Hungary", "Imperial Russia", "Mongol invasion", "Ottoman invasion", "Holy Roman Empire".. Do not ever expect me to take you seriously. The good faith assumption, and so-called knowledgability of the subject matter is out of the window, and that <b>utterly</b>. That article is not pushing for all of them to be "united in their Turkic identity". I can assume the same thing about Iranian peoples, Arab world, Slavic Europe etc in that case. How about looking at the issue with greater good faith? Do not reply to me unless you are ready to accept that you were "utterly wrong" when you affirmed "there are no articles that group Russia/Bulgaria" etc. End of story. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaristarim_c144.html" title="User:Baristarim">Baristarim</a> 20:13, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It was not me who nominated the articles for deletion, but certainly do support its deletion. There may not be a "Turkic conspiracy", but there certainly is a very ill-minded Turkish ultra-nationalism that has infiltrated many Wikipedias, most of all the German and English Wikipedias ... the Turkish Wikipedia is a joke and does not have any reliability.</dd>
<dd>What you call a "history section" is in reality <a href="../../../p/s/e/Pseudo-history.html" title="Pseudo-history">pseudo-history</a> - it's the manifestation of odd Pan-Turkist theories that should have no place in a serious encyclopaedia.</dd>
<dd>I have nothing against a <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Turkic_states_3a92.html" title="List of Turkic states">List of Turkic states</a> article that is NEUTRAL and is limitted to modern Turkic states. But the current article is POV. It wants to present historical kingdoms and dynasties as "Turkic" although these peoples were either not Turks, or they did not have any Turkic identity. There is already an article <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkic_peoples.html" title="Turkic peoples">Turkic peoples</a> (which also containst certain POV sections), there is no need to create another article.</dd>
<dd>You can say whatever you want, but you cannot convince me, because POV stays POV.</dd>
<dd>After more than a year of constant fights with nationalistic Turkish Wikipedians and their POV, I do not expect any good faith from them ... there are only a very few neutral and open-minded Turkish Wikipedians who are not biased with the usual Pan-Turkist propaganda of the post-Atatürk era.</dd>

<li>List of Turkic states and empires needs attention. By providing references from iranica and other biased sources, the list is turning out to be a totally disputed one. We should provide sources for each entry, i know this is ridiculous for a list, but no way. Better to find references available from the internet first. I'll try to dig the sources from the metu library tomorrow. Cheers! <a href="../../../e/1/0/User%7EE104421_300d.html" title="User:E104421">E104421</a> 21:48, 18 December 2006 (UTC)

The previous reference to "Vovin, Alexander. "<i>Did the Xiongnu speak a Yeniseian language?". Central Asiatic Journal 44/1 (2000), pp. 87-104.</i>" was probably taken from the wiki-article, i guess, this was just a dispute trial. I'll do the rest tomorrow.

<dd>The so-called new research dated 2000. The genetics study was published Am J Hum Genet. 2003 August; 73(2): 247–260. The Vovin reference is just a minor one. I think, it is irrelevant.

<p><small>The problem I was faced was regarding the use of the terminology; "Western Armenia" as a geographical term has been used by Armenians, even today. I'm in favor of keeping the term and specifying that it was a "historical subregion in Eurasia". Anything beyond geological use should be moved to relevant articles, and keep them as <b>see also</b>. "Wilsonian Armenia" has its own article, and it is not western Armenia, so it does not belong there. The "language of Armenians" in the article is also another "type" of problem. The Ottoman Empire does not exist so the "Western Armenia", knowledge in the article regarding language should be treated with the terminology "Armenians in Turkey", "Armenians in Armenia" . I think the only paragraph that should stay is the first one.

When that template was put in that articel it was you that attacked by deleting it without any good reasons and stating "There is only one state Armenia... ones before it were not called "Armenia". That is the most annoying and ignorant thing to say, before saying go research and you'll see that Armenians had their contry and many different capitals through out many years, before Turks migrated to Anatolia and took over everything by killing and distroying what was build for many years. Is it that offensive to you to see Armenian template on those articles? Well than thats too bad for you, you should get used to it because those cities in Eastern Tureky was build and belonged to Armenians and it was taken away by force and that past should not be forgotten that other people besides Turks lived in those cities and it used to be their capitals. <a href="../../../r/o/o/User%7EROOB323_48aa.html" title="User:ROOB323">ROOB323</a> 21:16, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</small></p>

One group tries to defend the sexual use of underage children, to justify their own sexual urges. The other group, suffering from the ravages of religious indoctrination on top of their craving for children, become "antipedophiles," see pedophilia everywhere and attack it ruthlessly, in order to cope with their own unresolved desires. Both types should be kept as far away from children as possible, they are selfish, maniacal and dangerous. <a href="../../../h/a/i/User%7EHaiduc_5b55.html" title="User:Haiduc">Haiduc</a> 05:12, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</small></dd>

<dd><small>Yes, it is despicable. If you cannot see that, I cannot understand the point of the reply you left to Mitsos in the WPHOG talk page! When I said "out of nowhere", I meant <b>to this AfD</b>, out of nowhere. I know very well that all the contributors to that AfD have been in Wikipedia for a long time. Did you actually read my post? Don't you find it interesting that ten Greek editors showed up to the AfD of an article that was only created two days ago? How did these people know about this? There is no logical explanation! Am I wrong? What would you feel if you were in my place? Please imagine that for a second! I had noticed that the debate has picked up steam in the PGG article, then Dirak creates this page, it is AfDed, and suddenly ten Greek editors show up! Just thinking with your head and not with your heart, you must surely see the bizarreness of the situation. How is that a show of good faith? All those people had signed up for the coop board, and this? I respect people's opinions, however people also have a right to wonder what is going when suddenly ten Greek editors jump into an AfD not even about Greece, for an article created by a Greek editor on a topic bizarrely resembling an article that they had been edit-warring recently. Whether you agree with me or not, I have also been in contact with other admins about this, and they all agree. Is that also a coincidence? You know, I was really glad when I had read your reply to Mitsos... It really felt good that there would be such people out there who thought like that. But when you said that "at first I had some reservations, but I realized that they were sincere", imagine what it is like for Turkish editors. I <i>am</i> sincere. But where does all this charade fit into this? YHowever, if we cannot see eye to eye on this, there is not much I can say. Other administrators also feel the same way, so what am I supposed to think? <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaristarim_c144.html" title="User:Baristarim">Baristarim</a> 09:06, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</small></dd>

<dd><small>Well, I was not referring to anyone in particular. If you are talking about good faith, see <a href="../../../s/o/l/Solomos_Solomou_47df.html" title="Solomos Solomou">this</a>. If I were not sincere, I would have simply edit-warred over that article instead of actually devoting time to fix it. I cannot change your opinions, but if a simiar thing had happenned with Turkish editors, ie if a Turkish had created a Albanian genocide article, then ten Turkish editors who had signed up to the coop board jumped in (some who had not even edited since November 11 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Kalogeropoulos" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Kalogeropoulos" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>, then I am sure that you would have felt the same way. Especially, if the article in question was created per WP:POINT because of a dispute in another turco-greek page. Of course you have the right to browse any page you want in Wiki, but it might be nice if you explained how you actually learned of this AfD. There is clearly a problem with good-faith here, and that is a cornerstone of that board's foundations. Did you read FPAS' comments? If you cannot see the violation of good-faith policy of the board in this whole charade, and worse, violation of Wikipedia policies on WP:POINT and disruption in this, how can I explain to other Turkish users that they can come in good faith to the coop board and raise issues in a civilized environement? I really would like to know what you would have felt if the situation was inversed between Greeks and Turks. What is it that makes you doubt the validity of the coop board? Have any Turkish coop board members created an Albanian genocide article, emailed each other and all showed up in the space of ten hours to vote keep? Are you honestly telling me that there isn't anything fishy? How did all those users learn of this so quickly? Personally, I was contacted by a non-Turk over this after ten Greek editors suddenly showed up and voted keep. This user emailed me because I was at the coop board and also because he thought that there was something "extremely fishy" going on (his words).

<p><small>Dear Baristarim, as a card-carrying honorary member of the "GREEK WIKIPEDIAN NATIONALIST JUNTA", I strongly object to your exposing our despicable methods in this way. Ahhh, I meant to say, well, ...&#160;;-) Let's say, I half agree with you, these block-like AfD votes are not very nice. But please cool down a bit and be careful with accusatory language like that. Point is, the Greek contributors form a fairly close-knit community, people tend to be aware of what others are doing, just by following each other's talkpages and contribution histories. So you may sometimes get these apparent effects of block voting behaviour even without any organised votestacking necessarily going on. In the present case, I can tell you on my honour that I, at least, did not receive any votestacking requests, and I was nevertheless aware of the existence of the AfD from early on, so others may have been as well. - Don't know if that satisfies you, but anyway, I'll bring the topic on at the Junta's next executive board meeting, which is hopefully going to take place some time during my Christmas vacations&#160;:-) Want to join us in Athens? <a href="../../../f/u/t/User%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_a39b.html" title="User:Future Perfect at Sunrise">Fut.Perf.</a> <a href="../../../f/u/t/User_talk%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_2505.html" title="User talk:Future Perfect at Sunrise">☼</a> 10:23, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</small></p>

<dd><small>I am equally disugsted by their behaviour. Some of them who voted keep are ones i took for serious editors (politis, yannismarou), but when i see them tow the nationalist line like that i lose all faith in their intentions. I expected that much from Nikos, Dirak, probably Hectorian and Aristov will show up soon also - but not from seemingly reasonable editors. Its like all standards of common sense and decency are thrown out the window when it comes to backing other Greek editors, or supporting articles which "get one over" on Turkey or Turkish editors. The whole thing is reduced to a bloody joke. --<a href="../../../a/2E/g/User%7EA.Garnet_b4c6.html" title="User:A.Garnet">A.Garnet</a> 14:04, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</small></dd>

<p><small>Hello Baris, since you said "Yasar Kemal has said many times that he is Kurdish, he was never ever been prosecuted, in any case." would you like to change his ethnicity in his article; <a href="../../../y/a/s/Yasar_Kemal_1093.html" title="Yasar Kemal">Yasar Kemal</a>. To add, Turkey "guya" doesn't legally persecute people who say they are ethnically Kurdish but let's face it, it's still socially not right to say it and media plays a big role here but things are getting better as the average mentality of people change to accept. <a href="../../../o/z/g/User%7EOzgurgerilla_c1aa.html" title="User:Ozgurgerilla">Ozgur Gerilla</a> 15:52, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</small></p>

<p><small>My first edit wasn't referring to your edit in Turkey but in the Talk page of Cretan Turks. Just for the record, the bulk of the Byzantine army in Manzikert was mainly composed of Armenian and Latin missionaries, this is possibly one of the reasons that the battle was lost. On the other hand ethnic Turks and Turkish-speakers had always been a minority in the Ottoman army, but this has nothing to do with assigning their victories to the Ottoman Turks now does it? Anyway I don't care where the link goes, you can put it elsewhere if that's your problem. All I want to do is to link this article around, that is all.

<p><small>I'm a busy person too but I don't use that as an excuse in my disputes. You have to learn to respect other people's cultures if you want them to respect your own. You also have to look at yourself before you judge others (Clapton, 63). This lawyer provokation strategy doesn't work in wikipedia, and it definitely doesn't work on me. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiskin_55d1.html" title="User:Miskin">Miskin</a> 00:53, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</small></p>

<p><small>Hey, thanks should go to you! I just wanted to see the referencing work complete, and no one wanted to take care of the antiquity section it seemed, and I'm a bit inclined to these antiquity issues. I wish I had helped you better during your efforts. I don't know if it's noticed, but I'm trying to take care of the images used on the page and now I'm making a high resolution free-licensed (and good looking I hope) map of the Ottoman Empire. I will upload that later today. Talking about the GA issue, I actually regret that you nominated the Ataturk article so soon. It's unfortunate that neither me nor you seem to have enough time to work on providing references on time. I feel obliged to do the cleanup on the Ataturk article since I wrote about half of the text there.

<td width="20" valign="top" style="color:#B2B7F2;font-size:35px;font-family:'Times New Roman',serif;font-weight:bold;text-align:left;padding:10px 10px;">“</td>
<td valign="top" style="padding:4px 10px;">Richard N. Frye's Greater Iran is a mixture of autobiography and memoirs of Harvard University's retired Aga Khan Professor of Iranian. After 60 years of researching and writing history books about Iran, from ancient to recent history, Professor Frye has written an outstanding story of his personal experiences living and researching in the region. To Professor Frye, his 60 years of travel in the region was an odyssey. The real life hardships and the risks of the odyssey will be more fascinating to many readers than the fictional Indiana Jones movies.
<p>From 1971 to 1972, I studied Persian (Farsi) at Harvard University. Professor Frye came to my home for my wife Badri's Persian dinners and for discussions about Iran. During his five years of service as director of the Asia Institute of Pahlavi University (now the University of Shiraz), I had the opportunity to join him once for dinner in his Qajar-period home.</p>
<p>Persian author and poet Ali Akbar Dehkhuda called Professor Frye Irandoost (lover of Iran). There are probably few Iranians who can rival Professor Frye's passion for a glorious Persian culture (Persian poetry, music, art, and architecture) over a 3,000-year period.</p>
<p>The title of the book refers to the entire region where Iranian languages were and are spoken. Professor Frye worked also in Afghanistan and in Tajikistan. Greater Iran includes also the Caucasus and Central Asian regions.</p>
<p>Total immersion into research of a culture over a 3,000-year period requires an immense commitment. In addition to living in a region during current times, a researcher cannot analyze original documents without mastering the languages of a region over such a long period of time. For Iran, this means an intense study at least of Avestan, Old Persian, Pahlavi (Middle Persian), and of Sogdian.</p>
<p>Fake antiquities are a big business in the Middle East. Professor Frye included pictures of pages from a fake manuscript and stories of his encounters with producers and sellers of fake antiquities.</p>
<p>Spies and political struggles are no strangers to the Middle East. Professor Frye included stories of his meetings with political leaders, such as Prime Minister Mohammad Mossadegh, and with spies. Major consequences of American intervention in Iran in 1953 remain to this day.</p>
<p>Such an intense passion for a career can come with a huge personal price. Professor Frye included details of his divorce and of re-marriage.</p>
<p>Professor Frye's legacy includes also the students who went on to become ambassadors, professors, and others who are passionate about Iran. Sir Roger Stevens' The Land of the Great Sophy is an example of the depth of appreciation for Iran of a British ambassador. The American Foreign Service could benefit from the examples of Professor Frye and of Sir Roger Stevens by requiring foreign service officers to remain in and to master the language and culture of a single country or region.</p>
<p>America fought a long war in Vietnam but has an American embassy in Vietnam today. America did not fight a war in Iran but has no American embassy in Iran (or in several other countries) today. After September 11, 2001, some Americans believe that CIA stands for Central Ignorance Agency, not Central Intelligence Agency. Many members of Congress, Democrats and Republicans, have chosen instead to accept political contributions and misinformation from the Rajavi cult (also known as the MEK or MKO, a Marxist terrorist organization responsible for murdering American military officers, Rockwell International employees, and many innocent persons in the Middle East). America's war on terrorism needs to begin at home by declaring war on ignorance and corruption in America.</p>
<p>In 1932, a single book changed the life of Professor Frye. While a high school student in Danville, Illinois, Richard N. Frye saw in the bookstore's window Harold Lamb's Tamerlane, the Earth Shaker. Hopefully, Professor Frye's Greater Iran will inspire many young readers to understand deeply and explain another culture. Perhaps, then, future voters and political leaders will be able to reject the ignorant views of those who call for wars against anyone they do not understand.</p>
<p>So great is his love for Iran that on a recent trip to Iran, Professor Frye met with Iranian President Mohammad Khatami to request permission someday "... to be interred in the mausoleum of the late Arthur Upham Pope on the banks of the Zayendeh River in Isfahan ...." (page 322)</p>

<dd><small>I know exactly well that it was Xinhua, and I also know what Xinhua is. Chinese governmental websites cannot be considered as "scholary sources". Ha ha. Maybe you should cut down on assuming that you are smarter than others. I look and see what exactly is there: a Chinese governmental website. Again, bring in historical scholarly sources: if that is hard to understand, you might want to consider (re)-reading the guidelines of Wikipedia and check other FA history articles. Xinhua News Agency is definitely not an authoritative source on history, let alone for modern day politics. Est-ce vraiment si difficile à comprendre mon gars?

<dd><small>Xinhua? You must be really joking my fellow.

<dd><small>Do not contact me again by saying things like "maybe you want the reference that you want to see", d'accord? D'abord apprennes comment parler aux gens, après apprennes comment marche Wikipedia, puis apprennes aussi que Xinhua n'est que de la merde. References vaut dire: ".edu", ou thèses academiques ou encyclopedies etc. Si t'arrives pas à comprendre ça, c'est toi qui a beaucoup des choses à apprendre sur la vie et le monde, pas les autres. Xinhua n'est pas une "reference", point final. Je t'ai dit gentillement de trouver des sources.

However, <b>you are confused about the difference between "external links" and "references"</b> I really got no time to explain you the basics of wikipedia or of the English language. External links are not references, they are simply web-links that are somewhat relevant to the article. Do you really know how Wikipedia works? Please read its policies. References are cited in a different fashion. "Links" can include anything as long as they are relevant to the subject, but they are not used as "references".

<dd><small>That's OK — and sorry if I was sharper than I needed to be. We do, though, only demand that there be a citable source. Unless there's reasojn to doubt a spource, we can't also demand that the source be given a citable source, etc. If what was claimed went against other sources, or seemed inherently unlikely, then we'd have grounds for questioning it, but it's not clear to me that that's the case here.
