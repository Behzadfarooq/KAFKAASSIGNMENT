<p>"Gay Parisienne" is the name of a Barbie dress from 1959. There were two reproduction dolls produced in the Nineties wearing it (one made of plastic, one made of china) and both got the name "Gay Parisienne Barbie". This is no spam! 89.51.17.13 19:51, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Comparisons of Barbie's dimensions to those of real women.</span></h2>
<p>The trouble with most comparisons of Barbie's dimensions to those of real women is that they never quote the actual dimensions of the Barbie dolls themselves, but only what selected dimensions would be when scaled up to 'life-size'. (In this article for instance it states, "in real life she would be towering over most men and have an impossible breast size".)</p>
<p>Whilst I understand the intention of such descriptions is to try to combat the problem of poor self-image and it's related disorders, I don't agree with the way the data is presented in an attempt to support the intentions, (as in my opinion, the end does not justify the means). I also think that attempting to present the data in this way actually detracts from its impact and relevance. Furthermore, such descriptions are meaningless unless at least one actual dimension of the doll is given as a base reference for scaling. We might as well say Barbie would be 10 or a 100 ft tall, as it completely depends on what scale we adopt, which in turn completely depends on which particular dimension we choose to use to determine our scale factor.</p>
<p>Clearly if we chose to use a scale based on comparisons of the height of the Barbie doll to the height of 'real-life' women, then she would not be towering over most men, nor have an impossible breast size. She would, however, almost certainly have hip and waist measurements smaller than the average.</p>
<p>Given that her male companion doll, Ken, is slightly taller than the Barbie doll, it would seem reasonable to assume a 'real-life' Barbie would be taller than the average. Given the dolls are American, we could reasonably assume Ken is over 6 ft. Lets us therefore assume Ken to be around 6 ft 6. This would make Barbie around 6 ft herself, which is admittedly tall for a woman, but not unusual for models for instance, (a point I will come back to).</p>
<p>Approximate measurements taken from a randomly sampled Barbie doll, (one of my daughter's), were 29.5 cm tall, 13.5 cm bust, 8.5 cm waist and 12.5 cm hips. If we assume the 'real-life' Barbie to be 6 ft, then this gives a scale factor of approximately 2.44 inches/cm. This gives bust, waist and hip measurements of approximately 33, 20.75 and 30.5 inches, respectively.</p>
<p>When looked at this way, the most striking measurement is not her height or bust, but her hips, which are extremely narrow, but does make the 'real-life' Barbie very thin all round. This is, however, only a reflection of the ideal promoted by the fashion industry, which strives to find models who are both very tall, yet naturally slender, small busted and narrow hipped, in order to make the clothes the models wear 'hang better'. Nonetheless, if given the dimensions as I have described, most people would regard this as extremely thin for anyone, but perhaps even more so in one so tall.</p>
<p>Most people have no or very little experience with individuals who are over 7 ft tall, and so such descriptions fail to register in any meaningful way with most people. Individuals of 6 ft are far more common, and fit a frame of reference people are used to dealing in, and so can much more readily appreciate the slimness of the other dimensions, which surely is the point.</p>

<p>In the Controversies section it talks about Barbie and patriarchy. I disagree with the assertions: Of course Barbie is a tool of the patriarchy. As is any other female icon whose main purpose in life is to look cute and buy lots of accessories. Sure, Barbie can get a "career", but I wouldn't last long if I showed up to work in any of her "professional attire". But what can you expect from someone who had trouble in math class.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Just FYI, only about 1 out of every 100 of the Teen Talk Barbies said the infamous line, "Math class is tough" - I'd say a much larger percentage than that of the population, male or female, actually has trouble in math. -- porcupine8</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Commentary by 66.248.33.35 moved from article</span></h2>
<p>"BARBIE" EXISTS IN TWO FORMS THAT ARE NOT AS WELL KNOWN AS THEY SHOULD BE. ONE IS THAT BARBIE EXISTS AS A DIETY. SHE IS THE MODERN DAY VERSION OF SUCH GODDESSES AS VENUS AND APHRODITE. THE OTHER FORM SHE EXISTS IN IS IN THE FORM OF A REAL WOMAN ALIVE TODAY SOMEWHERE ON EARTH. THERE ARE MANY VERSIONS OF REAL LIVING BARBIES, BUT THE MOST SIGNIFICANT OF THEM IS THE SUPREME BARBIE-BARBIE. SHE IS OF SOME LIKENESS TO MALIBU BARBIE, SHE IS 6 ft.2 in. tall, SHE IS SOMEWHERE BETWEEN THE AGE OF 43 AND 58, SHE IS CONSIDERED TO BE EXREMELY INTELLIGENT. SHE IS PERHAPS THE MOST INTELLIGENT HUMAN BEING ALIVE ON THE EARTH TODAY. HER PROFESSION IS MOST LIKELY THAT OF A PSYCHIATRIST. SHE IS EXTREMELY KIND AND LOVING. HER MARITAL STATUS IS LEGALLY SINGLE, BUT THERE IS A MAN WHOM SHE IS CONNECTED TO IN A TWIN-FLAME, OR SOUL-MATE RELATIONSHIP AS IF THEY WERE MARRIED, BUT THEY HAVE NOT PHYSICALLY MET YET. WHETHER THEY EVER WILL, THIS WRITER CANNOT SAY. THERE IS AN IMPLICATION THAT THIS SUPREME BARBIE-BARBIE EXISTED FOR A TIME SOMEWHERE OUTSIDE OUR NORMAL SPACE-TIME CONTINUUM. THAT IS SHE SEEMED TO BE IN A TRANSITION BETWEEN DIETY AND HUMAN BEING, AND WAS CAUGHT IN WHAT IS KNOWN AS THE ASTRAL PLANE.</p>
<p>PART OF HER SPIRIT ALSO DERIVES FROM THE LEGEND OF SAINT BARBARA. HENCE, THE CONNECTION BETWEEN SAINT BARBARA AND THE STORY OF RAPUNZEL, AND RAPUNZEL BARBIE.</p>
<p>IT IS ALSO TO BE NOTED THAT WHEN LOOKING FOR AN IMAGE REPRESENTING BARBIE, IT IS DIFFICULT TO FIND MUCH OF A LIKENESS EXCEPT WHEN ASSOCIATED WITH THE EROTIC. THIS SEEMS TO BE CONNECTED WITH BARBIE'S ORIGINAL VERSION IN THE GERMAN DOLL.</p>
<p>THIS INFORMATION IS SINCERE, AND COMES FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCES WITH A VERY DEFINTITE AND DISTINCT SPIRIT, MANIFESTING IN VARIOUS FORMS, SOMETIMES PHYSICAL, BUT NOT SO FAR IN A PHYSICAL MANIFESTATION OF THE ACTUAL PERSON. THIS SPIRIT, CLEARLY IDENTIFYING HERSELF AS BARBIE, THAT IS, THIS WOMAN'S REAL NAME IS BARBIE, CAME TO ME IN A VERY DISTINCT FORM AT A TIME WHEN I REALLY KNEW VERY LITTLE ABOUT BARBIE DOLLS, AND REALLY HAD NO INTEREST IN THEM. HER SPIRIT CONTINUED TO MANIFEST ITSELF IN VERIOUS WAYS INCLUDING COLOR PICTURES SOMEHOW BEING SENT TO ME AFTER I HAD EXPRESSED AN INTEREST IN HAVING ONE. THERE IS SO MUCH MORE I CAN SAY, BUT I DON'T KNOW IF ANY OF THIS IS EVEN BEING TAKEN SERIOUSLY. I CAN SWEAR THAT I HAVE PERSONALLY EXPERIENCED SOME SORT OF PHENOMENON ASSOCIATED WITH A SPIRIT AND MOST LIKELY A REAL PERSON NAMED BARBIE. ONE THING I CAN SAY FOR SURE IS THAT THIS IS A VERY GENTLE AND LOVING SPIRIT, AND THAT BARBIE IS A VERY GOOD THING FOR THIS WORLD.</p>

<dd>Following a link from a page about <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_fictional_characters_within_The_Simpsons_7136.html" title="List of fictional characters within The Simpsons">fictional characters from The Simpsons</a>, I wanted to read about the Teen Talk Barbie controversy. Anyway, I read <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barbie.html#Stereotyping" title="Barbie">down the controversy section</a> and noticed that the last paragraph seemed very much like an advertisement or a very over-zealous fan who seemed to inject personal affection for Mattel products into the article. <a href="../../../r/m/s/User%7ERmsharpe_8229.html" title="User:Rmsharpe">Rmsharpe</a> 04:11, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Unfortunately, that's what happens when a subject is so vehemently loved by some and hated by others. It's impossible to keep POV out of this article; every time it's edited to remove POV statements, someone comes along and adds the same types of statements back in. Until this issue can be resolved somehow, people using this article as a reference are doing themselves and their audience a disservice. Olivix 13:00, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Self contradiction</span></h2>
<p>The article states:</p>
<p>"<i>If scaled into real life proportions, she would be 5 feet, 9 inches, (1.75 m) measuring <b>36-18-33</b>.</i>"</p>
<p>And then later in the same section says:</p>
<p>"<i>She would wear size 3 children's shoes, far too small to support her top-heavy frame with <b>size-39 bust</b>.</i>"</p>
<p>I realize this is probably due to different methods of scaling her proportions... but is it possible that we could figure out a way to at least not contradict ourselves in the same passage?</p>
<ul>
<li>This information is faulty. For example, Barbie's feet would most certainly not be a children's size 3 - the measurements this statement are based on don't account for the fact that Barbie's feet are molded in a "high heel" position. If these comments can't be cited, they should be removed.</li>

<p>Shouldn't the photographs in this article be limited to ones that present dolls the way they actually appear?</p>
<p>Looking at the source of this article, someone has entered a comment about not deleting this picture "simply because you dislike it" on the grounds that it functions as an example of why many people take issue with Barbie doll's physical appearance. I'm curious to hear what other people think about this? Personally, I disagree, and feel the picture should be removed. Aside from the obvious difficulty in authenitcating the scale of the digitally-added neck rings (which was apparently anticipated by the person who added it) and the POV overtone, factually speaking, the doll shown in the photograph (Rose Princess Barbie) used a body sculpt with an exceptionally long neck that is very rarely used on dolls marketed to children and is therefore not representative of Barbie's general appearance. In fact, it was supplanted by a re-sculpted version with a much shorter neck. (The fact that the person who originally created the image chose a Barbie doll that is known among collectors for having an especially long neck can't have been entirely coincidental.)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">POV and incorrect information</span></h2>
<p>It seems people are intent on adding POV statements and sections to this article. Every time I delete something that's blatantly POV or incorrect, it reappears in some other form. I realize many people have an anti-Barbie agenda and that there are other entries perhaps more "important" than this one that elicit these kinds of responses, but shouldn't the information remain as factual and unbiased as possible even if the article IS "just about Barbie"?</p>

<p>On an episode of <a href="../../../w/h/o/Who_Wants_To_Be_A_Millionaire_9746.html" title="Who Wants To Be A Millionaire">Who Wants To Be A Millionaire</a>, <a href="../../../k/e/v/Kevin_Nealon_55ee.html" title="Kevin Nealon">Kevin Nealon</a> received the question: <i>In 1968, Mattel introduced the first African-American doll to its "Barbie" line with a doll named what?</i> The answer (which he got wrong) was <i>Christie</i>. This article, however, says the first African-American doll debuted in 1967, so I'll leave this info out of the article until someone can confirm it. - <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian_Kendig_b38d.html" title="User:Brian Kendig">Brian Kendig</a> 02:01, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The first black doll Mattel produced was a dark-skinned version of Barbie's existing "cousin", Francie, in 1967. The doll was basically identical to the existing Francie doll, but was made out of dark brown plastics. The doll the Milionaire show was referring to, Christie, was the first black doll Mattel created that wasn't just a dark-skinned version of a white doll, and was inroduced in 1968. I saw that someone has replaced the information about "Colored Francie", but their statement that the doll was discountinued due to "racial tensions" is totally incorrect. The doll didn't sell well, so it was discontinued. Unfortuantely, this article is riddled with misinformation and people seem bent on constantly adding more, so it's hard to correct the mistakes.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Comparisons of Barbie with Disney's 'Sleeping Beauty</span></h2>
<p>Though comparisons with real women are contentious and beside the point, for this is a <i>doll</i>, the comparisons with the features, hair, and proportions of Walt Disney's Sleeping Beauty, which debuted the same year !1959), are too striking not to be noted in the article. To draw any conclusions about the obvious similarity might risk Wikipedian ideas of "Original Research". --<a href="../../../w/e/t/User%7EWetman_82d0.html" title="User:Wetman">Wetman</a> 01:06, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Barbie was based on Bild Lilli, which I believe debuted a few years prior and looked identical to the first Barbies.</p>
<p>There´s an Wikipedia article about the Bild Lilli doll. She dates from 1952 (Bild Lilli) resp. 1955 (doll). 195.179.14.235 11:22, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The supposed similarities between Barbie and Sleeping Beauty are not "too striking not to be noted in the article". As others have explained, it's impossible for Barbie to have been purposely designed to resemble the Disney character. One has to stretch quite a bit to see any "similarities" between them, and aside from that, without evidence that something like this was done on purpose, it has no encyclopedic merit.

<p>Indeed Barbie is a spitting image of her predecessor Bild Lilli doll - the User from Oct. 7th and her/his predecessor are right. 89.51.17.13 20:01, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
