<p>I would anticipate creating a single medal at first, with the option of creating others later. A volunteer graphic artist would need to create something suitable. The community would elect a panel of judges to study nominations, which would be for one or more <i>edits</i>, not an <i>editor</i>. Any user could nominate another user, and discussion would involve the entire community. Awarded medals would be added to user (talk?) pages in a template form. Democratic votes might also work, but I worry that they might be divisive. - <a href="../../../j/a/k/User%7EJakew_2ade.html" title="User:Jakew">Jakew</a> 11:56, 23 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Some clarifications, as a result of comments and questions on the talk page:</p>
<ol>
<li>The idea is to reward <i>editors</i> for particularly good work (which must obviously be edits). It is not to say "I think Bob's a really good guy". The former, with luck, creates warm, fuzzy feelings among those awarded the medal, which is good in itself (positive feedback is a wonderful thing). In theory, those <i>not</i> nominated may be inclined to think "I can do better", and strive to do so. The alternative, rewarding editors for their whole conduct, risks creating ill will.</li>
<li>I made an error above. When I said "involve the entire community", I meant those interested could comment.</li>
<li><a href="../../../g/r/e/Wikipedia%7EGreat_editing_in_progress_380b.html" title="Wikipedia:Great editing in progress">Wikipedia:Great editing in progress</a> and especially <a href="../../../b/a/r/Wikipedia%7EBarnstars_on_Wikipedia_c8fc.html" title="Wikipedia:Barnstars on Wikipedia">Wikipedia:Barnstars on Wikipedia</a> are highly relevant to this proposal. I see the latter as an individual compliment, which I think is a wonderful thing. I see this as a compliment and vote of thanks from the community, as elected. It's good to be thanked by a friend, but - speaking personally - to be given a card expressing thanks from a group has brought me to tears. - <a href="../../../j/a/k/User%7EJakew_2ade.html" title="User:Jakew">Jakew</a> 19:03, 23 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p><i>From discussion page</i></p>
<p>I have a proposition myself, a modification of this medal stuff. Let say, a controversial subject, there are a lot of debates in the talk pages to finally have a neutral article..., if a controversial article get neutral and factual after intense discussions between the two sides, those that were able to present their arguments in a civil Wiki way, and obtain a consensus. those get a group award. It could be voted by the community. In controversial subjects, people will be ready to compromise, to as a group get a distinction to work in the community. It could be called something like the WikiCup, and could be given to the same group for the same article more than once. It will encourage people to work in group and compromise and be civil with each others. Fadix 19:36, 29 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Like it. Since you see it being granted by a group, perhaps "WikiMedal for Collaborative Editing" is a good name. Or perhaps not.&#160;;-) - Jakew 19:47, August 29, 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I think both sides should be given this barnstar (hope so) if they can reach concensus peacefully or one side will give up its idea. <a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDeryck_Chan_2dc3.html" title="User:Deryck Chan"><font color="#007DFF">De</font><font color="green">ryc</font></a><a href="../../../d/e/r/User_talk%7EDeryck_Chan_4045.html" title="User talk:Deryck Chan"><font color="brown">k C.</font></a> 15:25, 30 August 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>That's the spirit. It is about giving it to both sides... because of their capacity to work with eachothers. Fadix 20:50, 30 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p><a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENickptar_0554.html" title="User:Nickptar">User:Nickptar</a>, could you clarify what you mean by this? I think we need to have group awards, which will award more than just a person. Writting of articles are the result of dozens of hours of discussions, debates, compromise and solutions..., I can't see how awarding for this, could be bad. Fadix 23:56, 30 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>We should have wikimedals (I support proposal #1). We should not award medals to those who win article content disputes. Proposal #1 should be sufficient to cover every case in which Wikimedals are warranted. ~~ <b><a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENickptar_0554.html" title="User:Nickptar">N</a></b> (<a href="../../../n/i/c/User_talk%7ENickptar_0d70.html" title="User talk:Nickptar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Nickptar_06b7.html" title="Special:Contributions/Nickptar">c</a>) 23:58, 30 August 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>A large part of the articles in Wikipedia were the result of a hard work by a group of people. This includes featured articles like World War I... those have nothing to do with winning content disputes. Awarding people with different POV about a subject, that can work with eachother on an article, is I believe an excellent idea, users should be influenced to contribute as a team and not adversaries. Fadix 00:09, 31 August 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Those medals should certainly exist, but that's not what this proposal says.

<dd>First off, the category barnstars are for the actual categories listed on the Main Page {e.g Culture, History, Science etc.) So this barnstar wouldn't fall into the class of Category barnstars, but rather topical ones. Secondly, what images did you use for the 'star? I ask this only because if they are copyrighted anime images, there might be a copywrite issue in using the barnstar. <a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBratsche_d97d.html" title="User:Bratsche"><font color="#006666">Bratsche</font></a><sup><a href="../../../b/r/a/User_talk%7EBratsche_6f8a.html" title="User talk:Bratsche"><font color="#FF6600">talk</font></a> | <a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="#339900">Esperanza</font></a></sup> 15:41, 30 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I used an old picture from Dragonball (Z) that's been circulating around the net for years. Thought it would constitute as fair use whether or not the image was copyrighted. However, if you think this is an issue, the image can be changed easily since I have the PSD/CPT files. What kind of image are we looking for in order to not be copyright infringement for sure? Is a screenshot OK? Would a fan colouring of a B&amp;W page be OK? Because I don't think there are many non-copyrighted anime or manga images. Oh yeah and, I did mean topical barnstar.

<li>I think we should let it go: it simply isn't "broad and general" enough (I just skimmed the guidelines again), and I think we would be better off to avoid creeping barnstarism in general. – <a href="../../../c/l/o/User%7EClockworkSoul_d5aa.html" title="User:ClockworkSoul">Clockwork</a><a href="../../../c/l/o/User_talk%7EClockworkSoul_028f.html" title="User talk:ClockworkSoul"><b>Soul</b></a> 15:55, 28 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>As I said before, I took it from an anime image that was floating around the web for years.

<li>henshin wand</li>

<dd>That depends on whether you consider manga as a part of comics. While technically it is (and in Wikipedia, <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manga.html" title="Manga">manga</a> is under <a href="../../../c/o/m/Category%7EComic_books_d230.html" title="Category:Comic books">Category:Comic books</a>), whoever voted for the barnstar might've not realized this. There are currently about 1000 articles under the parent category 'manga' alone, with 28 subcategories. The comic books category, not including manga, is much smaller. Spoken Wikipedia has even less articles (although I admit its potential scope is as large as that of Wikipedia itself). -- <font face="wingdings">Y</font> <a href="../../../y/n/h/User%7EYnhockey_4e03.html" title="User:Ynhockey">Ynhockey</a> || <a href="../../../y/n/h/User_talk%7EYnhockey_bbc3.html" title="User talk:Ynhockey">Talk</a> <font face="wingdings">Y</font> 07:24, 11 February 2006 (UTC)

<p>Okay, folks, here's the draft of the BarnSakura. Note I said <b>draft</b>; I'm going to tweak it based on what suggestions I get here (one thing I do want to do is mute the colors a little more). The question for you all is do you want a more realistic design (which is sort of what I have here) or a more stylized design (leaning more towards pop art)?--<font color="#4B0082"><b><a href="../../../m/i/t/User%7EMitsukai_f72e.html" title="User:Mitsukai">み使い</a></b></font> <i><b><a href="../../../m/i/t/User_talk%7EMitsukai_5376.html" title="User talk:Mitsukai">Mitsukai</a></b></i> 03:05, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have two suggestions: 1) The design inside the leaves should be more intricate, maybe apply an appropriate texture. 2) Mute the colours, like you said.</dd>

<p>Okay, here's the second round of the BarnSakura. I fringed the inner petals a bit to give it a bit more of a realistic and textured look, and muted the colors to a little closer to natural. Gave it flares, both for "The Shiny look" as well as softening the overall appearance.

<dd>The new image definitely looks better. I have only one comment left: in the new version, the inner outline (it's light blue now?) somewhat melds with the rest of the picture but stands out at the same time. Maybe making it more pronounced (darker, different hue) could help. If you want me to attempt something also, maybe send me the file of the image? I'm assuming it's vector graphics, but any format is OK. -- <font face="wingdings">Y</font> <a href="../../../y/n/h/User%7EYnhockey_4e03.html" title="User:Ynhockey">Ynhockey</a> || <a href="../../../y/n/h/User_talk%7EYnhockey_bbc3.html" title="User talk:Ynhockey">Talk</a> <font face="wingdings">Y</font> 08:10, 5 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It's actually 11%gray, one step short of the off-white tones. I can see about thinning out the stroke, if need be, but I already tried some different colors and they didn't seem to work well.

<p>Just took a stab at it, a lot of directions we can go from there. I especially want to do some creative changes to the Barnstar in the background, just unsure exactly what would be best to compliment the helicopter, or if we want a RedCross instead; and/or I could make the helicopter a brown barnstar color scheme and do something bright in the background, such as a RedCross (second draft) but inside a Barnstar outline (didn't look good when I tried it). (also I don't like the blue roter blades... but making it look cool might be beyond my skills) - <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_492a.html" title="User:RoyBoy">Roy</a><a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoyBoy_dc3a.html" title="User talk:RoyBoy"><b>Boy</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_The_800_Club_b619.html" title="User:RoyBoy/The 800 Club">800</a></sup> 18:25, 21 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>For some reason, my browser's not letting me see your designs, but if I get the drift of them right, what about simply a rescue helicopter with a small barnstar hanging from the end of a rope below it? <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<i><small><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness"><font color="#008822">wha?</font></a></small></i> 02:14, 22 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I definitely thought of that too, yeah we can do that. Now to cut down drafts, what color scheme for the copter (original, or barnstar?), what barnstar should be used... the original makes sense given creating/rewriting articles is the very essence of the barnstar... or could it be the Working man's barnstar. Although each article is different, rescuing poor articles from the AfD is a constantly needed, tireless task. (and the tireless barnstar would add more color if we went with the barnstar color scheme on the copter) - <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_492a.html" title="User:RoyBoy">Roy</a><a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoyBoy_dc3a.html" title="User talk:RoyBoy"><b>Boy</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_The_800_Club_b619.html" title="User:RoyBoy/The 800 Club">800</a></sup> 15:31, 22 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Then most importantly the size of the barnstar... it could be proportational to the copter and so it fits inside the frame, or I could keep the barnstar the normal size and it would go outside the boundaries of the image (that would emphasize this is a big deal). - <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_492a.html" title="User:RoyBoy">Roy</a><a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoyBoy_dc3a.html" title="User talk:RoyBoy"><b>Boy</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_The_800_Club_b619.html" title="User:RoyBoy/The 800 Club">800</a></sup> 16:23, 22 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hmmm... this would be tough now. We need a balance between wit and information. A nice name that is also informative. Red Cross Barnstar, or M.A.S.H. Barnstar, for example, don't really emphasise that the awardee rescued articles from AfD. How about something like <i>Operation: AfD Rescue Barnstar</i>? Granted, that's slightly unwieldy, but I'm just brainstorming here. My brain has a lot of rubbish in it. --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">D</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><b>e</b></a><a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">ath</a><a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>phoenix</b></a> 17:48, 29 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, I suggested a (somewhat flowery) title originally, but it could be shortened - how about "Article Rehabilitation Barnstar", or just "Stub Rescue Barnstar"?

<p>I'm sorry to come in late and be a wet blanket, but I'm not so sure about this star.

<p>I really like this idea, and I think article rescue is a unique enough activity to merit a separate accounting. It's not unheard of for something to be deleted just because folks on AFD aren't familiar with the topic, and this barnstar would award a much-needed service.

For excelling work in sports-related articles. Hi, while we're discussion in the topic above the appearence of our "Citizen of the World Award" (as suggested by Rama), I realized by looking at our Barnstars template that we had no award for efforts in one of the most popular themes on Wikipedia (and anywhere): sports, or more appropriately, efforst in sports-related articles/themes. So I'd like to submit this image I created myself from two other images we had here on Wikipedia (you tell me if I got it right). I call it "The Olympic Barnstar" (obviously).

<dl>
<dd>(I'm not sure whether you got it right. It's very tempting to put the black ring around the hole, but it kind of makes it disappear from the Olympic Emblem. Did you try how it looks with the two outer rings having their centers on the middle lines of the rays? Also, did you intentionally choose a white background? <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAliter_d5f5.html" title="User:Aliter">Aliter</a> 01:36, 16 Feb 2005 (UTC))</dd>
</dl>
<p>Well, the black ring seems quite clear to me, especially since the barnstar is brownish ("rusty"), which makes the contrast sufficient to distinguish the two. The black ring is also made clear because of it's intersection with the two inner rings. I did take it into consideration, since I noticed that the black ring would be the only one of the five to be completely "contained" in the barnstar. This layout appeared optimal to me because I didn't want either the barnstar or the rings to be disproportional in size in relation to the other image, and having the rings centered in the barnstar provides a sense of simetry (which in my opinion wouldn't exist if the rings were higher or lower in relation to the barnstar). As for the background, actually it was the software I used to merge the two images that implemented the white background. I did notice it, but since the idea is that the barnstars have no background, I did not consider it an issue (besides, if the image is not framed – as in a thumb – in a page, it guarantees that it blends perfectly into the page, so that we only see the barnstar, and not the "edges" surrounding it). I do believe that this design is quite satisfactory. Regards, <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedux_c670.html" title="User:Redux">Redux</a> 02:53, 16 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm not sure that this is such a good idea. The five coloured rings are a trademark of the Olympic Committee.

<p>The image of the rings that I used to create this image came from Wikipedia itself. As stated in its Image page, it falls under the <a href="../../../f/a/i/Fair_use.html" title="Fair use">fair use</a> parameters. <a href="../../../l/o/g/Template%7ELogo_3c38.html" title="Template:Logo">This is the tag</a> that's in the image's page. It's used in quite a few pages (use this link to see the page → Image:Olympic-rings.png), and it has not been contested (I believe, or maybe it was, but there was a consensus about it being ok – especially in 2004, since it was an "<a href="../../../2/0/0/2004_Summer_Olympic_Games_8ba4.html" title="2004 Summer Olympic Games">olympic year</a>", which puts everything related to the Olympics in the spotlight). I don't believe that this is going to be an issue here. Regards, <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedux_c670.html" title="User:Redux">Redux</a> 04:13, 16 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Not to say the ring was undiscernable, just that it no longer seemed part of the emblem, more an inner ring of the barnstar. Symmetry I feel only with three rings showing in the hole; YMMV. The white background on the usually non-white user-page is indeed what I saw as a problem.</dd>
<dd>But I agree with GeorgeStepanek: The Olympics Rings were not part of human culture before De Coubertin created the Olympic Emblem, and in this case the rings are not used to refer to something Olympic. Hence, in my opinion this would not be fair use. <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAliter_d5f5.html" title="User:Aliter">Aliter</a> 18:10, 16 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Putting aside any issues concerning the design itself, I'd like to go back to the "fair use or not fair use" point. As I've said in my previous comment, I used an image of the rings from Wikipedia, which apparently had already been established as fair use. If we are considering the possibility that it is actually not, the issue would transcend the creation of a wiki award, since the image is being used in a boatload of articles (see the image's page). Unless you meant that it is not fair use only to use them in the image as I've done. I don't see how this could be though, either it's fair use to use the rings or not, and then they couldn't appear at all in the website. By what I've seen in the image's page, it appears that the community accepted it as fair use under our policy (at least I believe it's a policy...) that a trademark logo can be used as fair use (again, that's what the <a href="../../../l/o/g/Template%7ELogo_3c38.html" title="Template:Logo">tamplate tag</a> that's in the image's page says). In <i>my opinion</i> (and I emphasize that), in light of all that I've just said, I still believe that it's not a copyright issue.

<dd>Mmmm. I'm not convinced... AFAIK, the uses of the Olympic rings on Wikipedia until now have related directly to the Olympics movement. <i>In those contexts</i> such usage definitely falls within the bounds of "fair use". But what is being proposed here is to use the rings in a situation which does not directly relate to the Olympics. As such, I'm not sure whether fair use covers this particular instance, even if it does elsewhere on Wikipedia. In a way, it's an analogous situation to the medals controversy elsewhere on this page - pictures of medals are perfectly acceptable as illustrations on pages about those medals or on pages relating to medals in general, but using them on Barnstars poses problems in that we are using them for a different purpose to that for which they were intended. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>|<sup><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness">hello?</a></sup> <a href="../../../g/r/u/Image%7EGrutness.jpg_adb1.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/c/c8/Grutness.jpg/25px-Grutness.jpg" alt="" width="25" height="10" longdesc="../../../g/r/u/Image%7EGrutness.jpg_adb1.html" /></a> 00:17, 17 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>So the point <b>is</b> whether or not the rings can be used in this context. Well, if I had to analyse it, I'd say that the Olympic Emblem, although integrated in this new image, still stands for exactly what it does when seen alone: the Olympic Movement, as the highest symbol of sports, and not just any given event, but sports in general. Its presence in this image aims to create exactly this association with sports in general by evoking the so-called "Olympic spirit", which pertains to sports, not Greek mithology or the real mountain in Greece (might have gone a little overboard with the "philosophy" of it all?). It's not as though we were, for instance, trying to use the rings as a symbol for Wikipedia ("the sportive encyclopedia"?). Considering the comparison with medals, if you think about it (or overthink it), technically they weren't conceived to illustrate an encyclopedic article, or to represent directly the event or situation in which they were given, they are prizes given to athletes that participate in the sporting events that awards them. What I mean by this is that, if you spend enough time and energy, you can always find a loophole in any theory, and if you're well-spoken enough, you can make it convincing enough for others. Bottom line is, it appears (to me) that it stands to reason that, if using the image of the rings is fair use in pages about the Olympics, athletes and even sporting events (in the list of pages of the Image Page, we see links to all those sorts of pages), it would be the same with this image, which embodies sports (and not, as I said, any other thing for which one could be trying to make them a symbol).<br />
But maybe we could remove the polemics quicker (although it might be good if we could somehow establish a consesus to serve as a guideline, so that in the future similar situations can be dealt with faster, or even avoided altogether): we could try to come up with some other image, using some sort of sports-allusive image that we already have in Wikipedia, maybe a football? I did like that image I came up with, but it's really not that important, especially if we're going to spend zions discussing the "technicalities" (although a copyvio is not a technicality, but still) of it. I'll try to find something else (unless we somehow establish that the rings are ok). Regards, <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedux_c670.html" title="User:Redux">Redux</a> 02:23, 17 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Both the images used to compose the models with the barnstar had tags of being released in the public domain, so there shouldn't be any copyright issues.

<dd>How about reversing image 1, putting a smaller soccer ball (or a tennis ball, or...) in the centre of a barnstar, so that the five arms stick out (a bit like the globe image further up the page)? <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>|<sup><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness">hello?</a></sup> <a href="../../../g/r/u/Image%7EGrutness.jpg_adb1.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/c/c8/Grutness.jpg/25px-Grutness.jpg" alt="" width="25" height="10" longdesc="../../../g/r/u/Image%7EGrutness.jpg_adb1.html" /></a> 09:16, 17 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It's a good idea. In fact I already tried it, but I was unable to get rid of the football's image's white quadrilateral background, which was then interfering with the barnstar image and making the collage somewhat "ugly". It would be nice if someone could give it a try though. It will probably look better than my original <i>Model 1</i>.

<dd>Why not try it with a tennis ball? It's as international a sport as soccer, and the yellow-green and "U" shaped seam should make it stand out more clearly. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>|<sup><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness">hello?</a></sup> <a href="../../../g/r/u/Image%7EGrutness.jpg_adb1.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/c/c8/Grutness.jpg/25px-Grutness.jpg" alt="" width="25" height="10" longdesc="../../../g/r/u/Image%7EGrutness.jpg_adb1.html" /></a> 00:09, 19 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Sounds good to me too. Do we have this image of a tennis ball here on Wikipedia? Or maybe you have (or can get) one? If you can compose the image and post it, so we could see how it looks, it would be great. It will probably do the trick and we'll have our sportive award.

<p>Yeah, I couldn't find a free image either. But how about this alternative: instead of a ball (any ball), what if we put in front of the barnstar a <a href="../../../c/h/e/Checkered_flag.html" title="Checkered flag">checkered flag</a> – like one of those we see at the end of car races? It's a symbol generally associated not only with winning, but also with completing a "mission" (in races, completing the race, but here it could be the task of improving an article related to sports). For the same reasons, it's also a symbol highly associated with sports, and for our award objective, it would also have the additional advantage of not obscuring the barnstar. Our article on the item only offers a view of what would be the "cloth", but it should not be too complicated to engineer a pole to go with it. Although for a better display it would be more interesting to have the flag slightly tilted and with the cloth part "waving in the wind". Can someone come up with that? If that's possible to do, I imagine it could solve the problem. Regards, <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedux_c670.html" title="User:Redux">Redux</a> 05:42, 19 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>It looks good to me. But just to avoid any future questioning, I'd like to ask if you can verify that the image you used over the barnstar (the running man in the yellow circle) is indeed free, that is, not under any coyright restriction.

<dd>A perfectly reasonable request.

<p>That being the case, this could be it. I'd like to have some other opinions on the award though, so that we can have a consensus on it. Also, <a href="../../../z/s/c/User%7EZscout370_3f46.html" title="User:Zscout370">Zscout370</a> was going to upload a design of his combining the barnstar with a checkered flag.

<dd>I like the gold idea too: it think it would go well with "the running man". Also, I know its late, but that gives me an idea for a for a different name: <i>The Go For the Gold Barnstar</i>, or simply <i>The Gold Barnstar</i>&#160;? At the very least, it's more poetic than <i>Sportive Award</i>. – <a href="../../../c/l/o/User%7EClockworkSoul_d5aa.html" title="User:ClockworkSoul">Clockwork</a><a href="../../../c/l/o/User_talk%7EClockworkSoul_028f.html" title="User talk:ClockworkSoul"><b>Soul</b></a> 17:02, 25 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Let's see then the gold barnstar. What worries me is that the running man is also on a yellowish background (although not gold), which could sort of blend the running man with the barnstar a little too much. But we'd have to see it to evaluate it. As for the name "sportive award", it was just the title of this discussion, meaning that it was aimed at creating an award for efforts in sports-related articles. I haven't gotten around to thinking of names yet, but I guess the word "barnstar" would have to be there, since it will feature a barnstar, and it would be interesting to have it make some sort of reference to sports. I don't know if "gold" is allusive enough. Off the top of my head, I could think of "Barnstar of WikiSport" (or maybe drop the "wiki" and call it "Barnstar of Sports", simple and straight to the point). Or maybe: "Barnstar of Sportmanship"?

<dd>I thought about that too, and my thought is to try and see (which I will do in a few hours). If the yellow looks bad against the gold, I'll use another colour. If it turns out the gold star doesn't look good, we can just stick with the original barnstar colour (assuming we decide to stick with "the running man"). --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">Death</a><a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>phoenix</b></a> 20:42, 25 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I made the barnstars with a gold star.

<p>The second image looks reasonably good, but I didn't quite like the third. I would have to say that, of the three images, the original one still looks best though. Have you tried painting the barnstar in silver? We must be clear that this award, although it will relate to sports, is <b>not</b> a mimicry of a medal (namely, an olympic medal), and thus I don't see it as necessary or even important that it be painted in gold. Silver is a color used in many other sportive paraphernalia (such as throphies), and would be (if it looks good) just as suitable a color as gold, with the additional advantage of not blending with "the running man". If it doesn't look good, I'd say we should stick with the original image. Regards, <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedux_c670.html" title="User:Redux">Redux</a> 03:19, 26 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I <i>really</i> like the running man and gold star ideas... but the colors so far just aren't quite right.

<p>Hi. I took the liberty or repositioning your last two images. You're right, #5 does look better than #4. Here's an idea: why not take image #5 and paint <u>the running man</u> in gold? It might create an interesting effect (or it might ruin the whole thing). So far, however, I still think that the original image looks better (my own suggestion of having the barnstar painted silver did not yeld a superior result, in my humble opinion). As for ClockworkSoul's suggestion for a new design, if someone can create the image, it'd be worth taking in consideration. And indeed, it could be that the problem is that the colors may be a little off. Regards, <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedux_c670.html" title="User:Redux">Redux</a> 04:54, 26 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree with ClockworkSoul that gold seems to be a better idea. It's not just the Olympics but most other sporting tournaments that use the gold-silver-bronze award system, and I don't think it looks like a <i>specific</i> medal of any sort, so it's safe. I don't know about the stamping, though, because I don't think the running man will really stand out. I'll see what I can do with the gold star. --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">Death</a><a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>phoenix</b></a> 04:37, 26 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Attempts to make it look like a stamped (sports) medal didn't turn out too well at all. I have to say that I don't mind the gold star with the yellow face (#2), though. If you want to make that look like a one piece, I could put a bit of "barnstar shading" on the face as well, but I kinda like the star the way it is now. Thoughts? --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">Death</a><a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>phoenix</b></a> 05:55, 28 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Version #2 would be acceptable, but if you ask me, I still think that the original (#1) is the better looking one. If it's between the already posted images, I vote for Image #1. Regards, <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedux_c670.html" title="User:Redux">Redux</a> 13:57, 28 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Here are a few attempts by me. The color I used came from an HTML color chart which called it "Gold - old" which sounds like it should be the right color, but it can be easily changed.

<dd>Not so keen on "Go-for-the-gold", for the simple reason that in a lot of countries the phrase is simply "Go-for-gold"! How about "Sport champion barnstar"? A play on words, both as in someone who is a champion <i>at</i> sport, and someone who champions (i.e. supports) sport. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>|<sup><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness">hello?</a></sup> <a href="../../../g/r/u/Image%7EGrutness.jpg_adb1.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/c/c8/Grutness.jpg/25px-Grutness.jpg" alt="" width="25" height="10" longdesc="../../../g/r/u/Image%7EGrutness.jpg_adb1.html" /></a> 23:54, 28 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

As for the name, since <a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">Deathphoenix</a> introduced the parameter for the image, we started refering to a certain aspect of it by an "affective nickname", so I can't resist the urge to suggest: <b>The Running Man Barnstar</b>, or <b>The Running Man's Barnstar</b>, or even <b>The Barnstar of the Running Man</b>. "Running" does relate to practicing sports (or, for our particular case, we could correlate "running" to contributing vigorously to sports-related articles), plus it is the image that appears on the Barnstar and we can add an explanation to the award's page as to how the name (if it's chosen) came to be. I thought it would be worth suggesting this. Regards, <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedux_c670.html" title="User:Redux">Redux</a> 01:24, 1 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I must say, I wasn't thinking about the "Governator" when I proposed the name. It was only when I read Brian's and Deathphoenix's posts that I made the connection. I don't know that most people would make any connection to Schwarzenegger because of that movie from the 80's. We started calling the image "the running man" because that's what he is "doing". As it turns out, it would work for the award name, because running (or jogging) is an activity closely associated with practising sports. I still think it would work. But I must insist that we agree on the image for the award before we get too much into name choosing (unless we've already settled for <a href="../../../b/a/r/Image%7EBarnstar-goldrun2.png_ba46.html" title="Image:Barnstar-goldrun2.png">Brian's proposed gold image</a>).

<li>I personally think the second image is better, since that reminds me of the shade of gold for the Olympic gold medals. However, if the Running Man Barnstar is what yall want to go with for the name, that is fine with me. <a href="../../../z/s/c/User%7EZscout370_3f46.html" title="User:Zscout370">Zscout370</a> 17:21, 1 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>I don't know, I thought this latest shinier version of the award is the better (looks more like a gold medal and stuff). But anyways, I think I have a democratic solution for this. I put together this (totally) improvised board for us to vote in (feel free to perfect the code). So we just add our signature under the award that we prefer. Today is Tuesday, so let's say by Saturday (meaning, "late Friday") midnight (GMT) we "close the polls" and the most voted becomes the award image. Is that acceptable? That's off course assuming that we've settled for the general parameter introduced by Deathphoenix and are going to use one of Brian's designs. I thought this would help settle this. For the first vote in each award, just replace the "no votes" sentence with your signature, to cast a second, third (and so on) vote, just copy and paste the code column and replace the appropriate (be careful not to vote in the wrong image). Sorry if this is a little rudimentary, but it was the best I could come up with (maybe someone could improve the quality of this?). If the community rejects this idea to vote for the image, feel free to delete this board.

<li>You may want to split the Barnstar mainpage into two sections, one for "general barnstars" (probably all of the current ones would go in this category), and "topical barnstars" for each of the topic barnstars being created on the proposal page.

<p>This is my suggestion for an Olympic Barnstar. There are a lot of people (me inclusive) who are working very hard to create a better Olympics community of pages. They deserve this award because it is specific to their work on Wikipedia. It would be my honor to commend certain people with this award. Suggestions?

<li>Firstly, the IOC are <i>very</i> careful about copyright infringement, so there can't really be any reference to rings involved. Secondly, we have the <a href="../../../t/h/e/Template%7EThe_Running_Man_Barnstar_648e.html" title="Template:The Running Man Barnstar">The Running Man Barnstar</a> for sports articles, and since it is very firmly established (I think it was given to several people for Olympics-related work), should do fine. <font style="color:#0077FF"><u><b>s</b>murray</u></font><font style="color:#0055CC"><u>inch</u></font><a href="../../../s/m/u/User%7ESmurrayinchester_Greene_3f62.html" title="User:Smurrayinchester/Greene"><font style="color:green"><i><b>e</b></i></font></a><font style="color:#0055CC"><u>ster</u></font><font style="color:#0055CC"><sup>(<a href="../../../s/m/u/User%7ESmurrayinchester_f294.html" title="User:Smurrayinchester">User</a>), (<a href="../../../s/m/u/User_talk%7ESmurrayinchester_aa08.html" title="User talk:Smurrayinchester">Talk</a>)</sup></font> 20:00, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>One of the original options for the Running Man Barnstar originally was for us to use Olympic rings, but there were a few reasons it wasn't used. I don't remember, but I'm sure <s>trademarks</s> copyrights were a factor, as was the fact that we wanted to make this star for use with <b>all</b> sports, not just Olympic sports. While I may seem biased, since I helped create that barnstar, I'd say the Running Man Barnstar should be sufficient. --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">D</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><i>e</i></a><a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">ath</a><a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>phoenix</b></a> 22:06, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I remember it perfectly. I was the one who proposed the sports Barnstar, which eventually became the current Running Man Barnstar, <b>and</b> I also proposed the first draft for the award's image, which included the Olympic Rings. The main point was that the Rings could not be used in our award due to copyright restrictions. Nothing has changed since then in that regard. And there's the excellent point about not limiting the award's scope too much: I mean, we already have an award that is specific for contributions pertaining to the world of sports, both Olympic and otherwise. That's already a very specific Barnstar, since efforts in sports-related articles could also be acknowledged by a number of other awards (such as the Original Barnstar, The Working Man Barnstar, The Tireless Contributor Barnstar and so on). No need to go more specific than that; it'd be overdoing it. Regards, <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedux_c670.html" title="User:Redux">Redux</a> 02:51, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
