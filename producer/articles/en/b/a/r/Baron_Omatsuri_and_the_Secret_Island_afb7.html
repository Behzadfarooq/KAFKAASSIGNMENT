<p>The Straw Hat crew obtain an advertisement for a recreational island on the Grand Line run by the Baron Omatsuri. Luffy decides to take this opportunity to kick back and relax. Unfortunately, when they arrive at the island, they are asked to compete in contests through unity for access to relaxation. However, there seems to be a mysterious air on the island, as the Straw Hat Pirates begin to fight amongst themselves, while Robin, Chopper, and Luffy individually search for the secret behind Baron Omatsuri's island.</p>

<div class="notice spoiler" id="spoiler"><b><a href="../../../s/p/o/Wikipedia%7ESpoiler_warning_6b56.html" title="Wikipedia:Spoiler warning">Spoiler warning</a>: <i>Plot and/or ending details follow.</i></b></div>
<p>As they arrive at Omartsuri Island, the Straw Hats find only beach and jungle, but journeying further into the depths of the rain-forest, they find what they were looking for. A town square full of beautiful buildings, casinos, beauties from around the world, and much more. The strange thing was, all the people (who were all men) had leaves growing out of their heads. Soon they were greeted by none other than the great Baron Omartsuri himself, who arrives riding on an elephant. He demands that they accept a challenge before being allowed to enjoy the recreational facilities. Against the advice of his crew, the adventure-loving Luffy accepts the challenge.</p>
<p>The first challenge is called "Net the Goldfish" and the opponent is a man named Muchigoro. The rule is that the side that nets the most goldfish within 3 minutes wins. However, the Straw Hats are tricked into thinking that they are using palm-size paper nets to catch normal-size goldfish, when in fact, it is a giant goldfish. The Straw Hats finally win at the last moment through great teamwork, and the victory is declared by a strange flower sitting on the Baron's shoulder.</p>
<p>The second challenge is called "Toss the Hoop" and the opponents are four old people dressed as frogs. Each team consist of 4 players driving 2 high-speed race boat. The winning condition is to throw the most number of hoops onto the opposite team. During this race tensions mount; Sanji and Zoro argue so much that they have trouble fighting the real enemy, while Nami becomes angry at Usopp, who abandoned her inadvertently after having a pair of wings strapped onto him. Nonetheless, it is Usopp who lands the finishing blow, giving the Straw Hats their second win.</p>
<p>Later on, Chopper wanders off into a cemetery and encounters a pirate family. The father offers to tell Chopper a secret if Chopper pretends to lose a fight against him in front of his family. Chopper agrees, and learns that Baron Omatsuri used to be a pirate, but lost his entire crew in a storm. The wanted poster shows the entire Red Arrows who look just like they do now, except for the Baron who looks much younger then he is currently. Robin, meanwhile, learns from Muchigoro of a rare flower called Lily Carnation that is found only on this island. She leaves to search for, it but finds a horrible monstrosity shaped like a firework snake. Luffy is approached by a strange man name Mustache who asks if he wants to join his pirate crew. Luffy declines and is told to be afraid of the Baron. Chopper is ambushed by Baron Omatsuri and shot with an arrow; we do not see what happens to him. Muchigoro is interrigated by Nami and is surprised to learn that Gold Roger was executed over twenty years ago. He says that can't be as saw him recently before the storm. When Nami asks what happened, Muchigoro looks horrified and turns blue and shrivels up like a prune. Robin is shown the flower by the Baron. It is a huge tube-like object. As she asks how this can be,the flower on Baron's shoulder suddenly has it's eyes turn into green targets,as an arrow is shot at her. As soon as it is shot,every candle in the area Nami and Muchigoro are in suddenly flicks out.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Sanji becomes angry with Zoro and Nami for not seeing him win a battle against another chef cooking their dinner. Usopp, hurt from being given the cold shoulder by Nami, walks into the woods where he meets a creepy boy called DJ Gappa. Sanji,Zoro,Nami and Luffy meanwhile notice the absence of the rest of the crew. Sanji and Zoro begin questioning each other if they did it.Nami interjects,but finds nothing to say. Sanji then asks Luffy what he intends to do. He made the decision to come here,so the whole reason the situation is happening is on his shoulders. Luffy though is left speechless.</p>
<p>Soon after, Zoro and Sanji run into DJ, wearing Usopp's hat. When they threaten him to make him tell where Usopp is, the Baron and the rest of the island people attack. Sanji, Zoro and Nami run away to search for the missing crew, while Luffy stays behind to fight the Baron. Luffy is nearly defeated, but is saved by Moustache who claims to be the former head of the Moustache Pirates and has built miles of tunnels under the island. Moustache explains to Luffy that the Baron's crew were all killed in a storm and he was the only survivor. Now, he hates all close-knit pirate crews and wishes to separate them all. Moustache once had a large crew but they were all killed by the Baron</p>
<p>Zoro encounters DJ and slashes him, but DJ is mysteriously unharmed, and wonders himself how this is possible. The Baron assures DJ that he is simply strong. One by one, Zoro, Sanji and Nami are all captured by the Baron and his men.</p>
<p>Chopper wakes up to see the youngest daughter of the pirate family being pulled up by tendril to the lily carnation. Chopper saves her and is caught instead and when the rest of the family tries to help him, the father cowardly pulls them away. Chopper sees everyone else is lying unconscious at the tip of the lily and then he is pulled in as well.</p>
<p>All of the Red Arrow Pirates are struck with dizziness and go to sleep commenting how strange that is but believing they will still be who they were the next day.</p>
<p>Luffy goes to save his crew but the Baron pins him to a rock and forces him to watch as the are absorbed one by one into the lily. Horrified and blaming himself he offers no resistance as the Baron motions to shoot him in the head with the arrow. He is saved once again by Moustache, but is paralyzed with grief and blame for himself for thoughtlessly accepting Omatsuri's challenge. But Moustache claims they are still alive. The family is also there and Daisy, the youngest daughter, claims that she can here their voices calling for Luffy. She also knows their names even though she only met Chopper. Luffy is still doubting but Moustache gives him a pep talk which ends with him showing Luffy the sign of the Moustache Pirates,saying the two of them are now friends.</p>
<p>Luffy goes to face the Baron again with renewed determination while Moustache distracts the Baron while the family looks on. Luffy protects Moustache from an attack and says he will save his crew. He smashes Lily, but at that moment, Digi says the voices are coming from somewhere else nearby. A look at the suppossed Lily reveals that its a fake made out of Barons arrows. Luffy yells for his friends and Baron laughs bitterly and tells Luffy to look at him. As Luffy watches in horror, the happyface flower on Baron's shoulder mutates into a corpulus mess of stem attached to Barons back and shoulders with a head similar to a piranna plant. Within the stem, the outline of the Strawhat Pirates can be seen. This is the true Lily carnation, the flower of death and rebirth.</p>
<p>The arrows from the fake Lily all descend on Luffy and he is stabbed in the back with dozens of them. Omatsuri says these arrows represent his days of loneliness after his crew died. He gave himself to the Lily to bring them back and has been feeding it anyone who comes to the island to keep it happy. The sun rises and the Red Arrows awake in town full of energy. Daisy tells Luffy not to give up and he starts hearing them calling for him to. He begins struggling over to the baron, half-dead and with the arrows still in his back, telling him to give him back his crew. The Baron is so shocked he can do nothing but stare at Luffy.</p>
<p>The family's father asks Daisy if she can really hear them and she says that she heard his and Chopper's conversation, and she also still believes in her father. This inspires him to pick up the Baron's discarded bow and take aim. The Lily head notices and turns to face him, scaring him into a stupor, but he summons his courage and fires the arrow right through Lily's head,killing it instantly. The Baron snaps out of his trance to gaze at Lily's ruin in horror and at the moment the arrows disappear and Red Arrows pirates return to their true forms: flower roots.</p>
<p>Omatsuri fall to Lily's remains in tears trying to put it back together,knowing what has happened with it dead. However Luffy comes right next to him and punches him in the face,sending him flying. He barely notices and cries for his family not to leave. The camera pans to the Red Arrows posters and he hears the voices of his crew. They thank him for remembering them, but mention that the storm didn't kill them (implying but not saying that it was Lily so it could have Omatsuri as a slave). They say they won't mind if Omatsuri finds a new crew, like the Strawhats.</p>
<p>Luffy wakes up to the family and Moustache who are hovering over him. He thanks them for there help, but Moustache says that it is he should be thank. Moustache has seen his crew avenged, the family kids are now proud of their dad and when Luffy asks about his crew he see them waking up a little distance away. They seem to have forgotten a good part of the adventure, though Chopper remembers Daisy, and goes to see why Luffy is sleeping on the floor by himself. Robin notices three small flowers by a rock, while the others gather around Luffy and ask him what he's doing. He says nothing but smiles and laughs mischievously.</p>

<ul>
<li>Movie 6 is quite different from the regular TV series in terms of animation style, character drawings and mood of the story. Instead of the usual light-hearted, sunshine feel, this movie is quite dark and probably not suitable for younger children. Some fans even commented that the climax is quite "freaky".</li>
