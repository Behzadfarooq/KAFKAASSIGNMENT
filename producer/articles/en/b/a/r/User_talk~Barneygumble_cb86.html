<p>I saw you voted to add the <a href="../../../a/l/i/Ali_Sina_7a6a.html" title="Ali Sina">Ali Sina</a> link to the Islam page saying that the Roman Catholic Church article has much criticism on it so Islam should as well. I would like you to reconsider this for a few reasons. Firstly this issue isn't about criticism. There are many criticisms about traditional Islamic dress for women being restrictive by modern standards, traditional Islamic gay rights, even modern approaches to apostasy law -- these are all understandable issues. The thing is that Ali Sina and faith freedom are not credible sources for criticism. They are not sociologists with a scholarly view on this they are the type that call Muslims animals by defining Islam as they see it and hating their creation. They also generalize about Islam which is harder to do with the Roman Catholic Church since its doctrine is defined unlike Islamic doctrine. If you want criticism that is fine, I am for criticism with brief responses to it like the Roman Catholic article has, however, Ali Sina is not encyclopedic level criticism and we should not lower ourselves to sources of that nature.

<dd>yeah good job, you have to be on the look out for soviet spies, they <i>are</i> everywhere, especially since the fall of the soviet union a decade and a half ago, they figured we'd let our guard down, allowing them to attack our wikipidea, good catch, if we didn't have people like you watching out for us, the free wrold might fall to a non existant country, know what they say?! first they take your wiki, then they take berlin!!!! - <small>(unsigned answer by 172.128.124.231)</small></dd>

<dd>Right, just because the Soviet Union collapsed, that means that everyone who holds their goals highly just suddenly disappeared. Only posters older than 14, realize that "these people" refer to sympathic wiki users, not Soviets. Obviously "the latest trick" didn't refer to the Soviet Union either. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarneygumble_6c6f.html" title="User:Barneygumble">Barneygumble</a> 20:26, 9 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It has nothing to do with spies, genius.

<p>I respect your opinion and understand how emotive this area can be, we are dealing with murder and nothing insights more repulsion in most of us than the killing of a defenceless person. I will try to answer the points you have rightly raised and be as honest as I can. I don’t expect you to see things in the same way as me as we all have different life experiences and that is what ultimately informs us.</p>
<p><i>The Cycle of Violence? That suggests that if Tookie's death sentence was communed, the crime rate would go down.</i></p>
<p>Well in a sense, ‘yes’. I have seen what Stanley Williams writing and campaigning can do first hand, and that does indeed include moving young people away from violence. So in a sense I do believe that he can help, as far as one man alone can, to reduce violent crime and gang conformity.</p>
<p><i>It also suggests that the cause of crime in the first place was other people getting punished. Has stopping the death penalty stopped violence in Europe? Hardly.</i></p>
<p>Well, as you know violent crime is caused by a range of factors key among these in my eyes would be poverty. Beyond this I think it would probably be cultural beliefs, which often also stem from poverty, such as a desire for status and empowerment (as Stanley Williams himself attests). When a culture believes violence is the solution to problems, this expresses itself on many levels both within government and wider society. Take street crime, gun culture, war and violent entertainment, these factors are a part of many cultures of course including my own but within American culture they seem, from the perspective of most I know in Europe, to be exaggerated. The death penalty just seems to be another area where many in the US ignore international law and moves away from violence. The opinion I was trying to express in my last post is that I believe we need to set a standard away from violence, a standard that puts human life first, even it we believe that person has done wrong, we take a stand to be better than revenge killers. At the same time as ending the death penalty I would like to see better social/cultural education, resources put towards tackling poverty and the restriction of weapons. It’s going to be a long road but it is one I feel the whole world must take. In Britain crime has not gone down, it has grown as the population has grown but most of Europe is very safe and far less violent than the United States, the restriction of guns I believe is an important factor in this at least in the UK. In fact the only countries that are more violent than the US are countries with extreme poverty.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The roots of crime cannot be strictly attributed to poverty. There are many poor people that are not criminals and many rich ones that are (i.e. Enron). The increased desire for power, status, and material wealth coincides with the decrease in religion in the West. The restriction of weapons will never prevent crime. If guns are made illegal, gun crimes still happen. Britian is a good example and they are an island. Criminals would then know that the population is defenseless. Even if you were somehow to eliminate guns altogether, physical strength would become powermount, leaving women and old men defenseless. A gun is a great equalizer. When I was in the UK and was asked about guns, I asked people where they would rather rob a house, the UK or Texas. Everyone responded the UK. However, a gun is a great responsibility and people need to train and respect guns.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p><i>What about the families of the loved ones that were killed? Tookie is asking for mercy that he did not show his victims.</i></p>
<p>Well I cannot speak for the victim’s families, but I can say that in my own humble experience, there was a member of my family who was murdered in the 1960’s when capital punishment was legal in the UK. The man responsible panicked and tried to get rid of her body, if he hadn’t he probably would have got off with manslaughter. Instead he was hung. I don’t think anyone in our family thought this was the right thing, he acted out of fear not out of gilt, it was an accident. I also counseled a woman this year whose family was murdered, the man who did it killed himself, and all his death did was leave her feeling unresolved. I believe people need to learn to move on with their lives, that is a very difficult thing to do, but harboring hate does not help.</p>
<p>Because Stanley Williams did wrong does not mean we must, I do believe in mercy, I don’t believe in an eye for an eye. I believe as Gandhi said, “An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind”. Or as Jesus says, "You have heard that it was said, 'Eye for eye, and tooth for tooth.' But I tell you, do not resist an evil person. If someone strikes you on the right cheek, turn to him the other also…"You have heard that it was said, 'Love your neighbour and hate your enemy.' But I tell you: Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, that you may be sons of your Father in heaven."</p>
<p>I hope that you can at least respect my position by thinking about what I have said. - <a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESolar_0332.html" title="User:Solar">Solar</a> 17:10, 8 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Also read the District Attorney's response to the clemency appeal. <a href="http://da.co.la.ca.us/pdf/swilliams.pdf" class="external free" title="http://da.co.la.ca.us/pdf/swilliams.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://da.co.la.ca.us/pdf/swilliams.pdf</a>. One thing that bothers me is that he hasn't really rejected the Crips (see Ed Bradley interview on 60 minutes), nor has he ever admitted to the killings. However, those two facts don't sit well together. If he really hadn't committed the crimes and was repentant, he would give the cops all he could on the Crips. If he did commit the crime, and hasn't apologized, why should any mercy be shown? <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarneygumble_6c6f.html" title="User:Barneygumble">Barneygumble</a> 17:48, 8 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>A final question and a most pertinent one if i am to gauge your intents: Do you support abortion? <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarneygumble_6c6f.html" title="User:Barneygumble">Barneygumble</a> 17:43, 8 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thank-you for your comments, while I am all for the exchange of ideas I feel that you have not engaged with what I have said and are interested only in arguing, this is something I have no interest in doing. I have made my points in the spirit of exchange and in defence of Stanley Williams life; I feel that judging by your strong belief in violence there is little benefit to either of us in continuing. - <a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESolar_0332.html" title="User:Solar">Solar</a> 17:27, 9 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I have engaged in discussion with you although I have not agree with your positions. I don't have a strong belief in violence, but believe capital punishment is justified in henious crimes. Finally, you ignored my abortion question which leads me to believe that you support it. So how can someone who adamently opposes capital punishment, favour abortion? I can dutifully respect your opinion if the attitude of non-violence is equally applied to the unborn. Is the reverse true for me? Yes, to a degree, but the difference is, is that the unborn are innocent and have not committed any crime, as opposed to Mr. Williams. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarneygumble_6c6f.html" title="User:Barneygumble">Barneygumble</a> 22:05, 9 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Just to clarify, I do not personally support abortion. I do however understand that it is a very complex issue and involves the rights of the mother also. This aspect is especially important in the case of women with little access to medication or where the mother’s life is at risk. I also do not personally support the killing of animals for food or sport <a href="http://www.viva.org.uk/photogallery/galleryindex.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.viva.org.uk/photogallery/galleryindex.htm" rel="nofollow">(see here)</a>. With all these issues I believe that social and democratic solutions must be worked towards. Essentially my views are that the protection and sanctity of all life is paramount, but obviously at this point in time we are all forced to work within the grey areas in which ideals are far in the distance. This will be my final comment I now need to focus my energy on other areas, thanks for sharing your ideas. - <a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESolar_0332.html" title="User:Solar">Solar</a> 00:06, 10 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi,I noticed you reverted some vandalism on <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jessica_Simpson_3f53.html" title="Jessica Simpson">Jessica Simpson</a> earlier. Thanks. I'm not sure exactly how you approached it though because you accidentally left some in place <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jessica_Simpson&amp;diff=31205483&amp;oldid=31201231" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jessica_Simpson&amp;diff=31205483&amp;oldid=31201231" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> which wasn't noticed for a little while longer, so I though I'd point out <a href="../../../r/e/v/WP%7EREVERT_1079.html" title="WP:REVERT">WP:REVERT</a> to you, just in case you weren't aware.
