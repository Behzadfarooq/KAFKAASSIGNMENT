Some readers looking for a serious article mightn't find them amusing. Remember, millions of people read Wikipedia, so we have to take what we do a bit seriously here. OK?

<p>The article has been given a cleanup as it had become longer than preferable under Wikipedia guidelines. Barbie is such a large subject that it is not practical to list everything that has ever been said about her, and the article has to stay within a length that is of interest to the general reader. Please bear this in mind when editing the page. --<a href="../../../i/a/n/User%7EIanmacm_cc9f.html" title="User:Ianmacm">Ianmacm</a> 17:12, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The page is still longer than preferable, mainly due to the Timeline at the bottom of the page. It is probably outside the scope of the article to list every Barbie and Limited Collectors Edition etc, and the Timeline would look better if it restricted itself to important dates in the development of Barbie. I propose to do this when more time is available. --<a href="../../../i/a/n/User%7EIanmacm_cc9f.html" title="User:Ianmacm">Ianmacm</a> 14:54, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The timeline has been slimmed down, but anyone wishing to enlarge the page List of Barbie dolls is free to do so. One puzzle is the outcome of the lawsuit: <i>A commercial by automobile company Nissan featuring dolls similar to Barbie and Ken driving in a toy car was the subject of another lawsuit in 1997.</i> Does anyone know what the outcome of this was? There are so many Barbie lawsuits that without a citation this one will be removed. <a href="http://entlawdigest.com/story.cfm?storyID=1404" class="external autonumber" title="http://entlawdigest.com/story.cfm?storyID=1404" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> <a href="http://www.s-t.com/daily/01-98/01-09-98/b02li044.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.s-t.com/daily/01-98/01-09-98/b02li044.htm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> --<a href="../../../i/a/n/User%7EIanmacm_cc9f.html" title="User:Ianmacm">Ianmacm</a> 14:44, 19 October 2006 (UTC). After a lot of hunting on the internet, I found that Mattel lost this lawsuit. There is also a link to a YouTube video of the commercial in the article.--<a href="../../../i/a/n/User%7EIanmacm_cc9f.html" title="User:Ianmacm">Ianmacm</a> 15:48, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I've attempted to edit the timeline to remove things that were not especially important milestones in the history of the Barbie doll. However, the timeline could be edited much more than this. In fact, I don't think a timeline is even necessary in this article. Much of the information listed is redundant, and the portions that aren't redundant and are important enough to warrant inclusion in the article should be moved to the body. It appears someone was using this timeline as a dumping ground for factual information that would more appropriately be included in other sections. Olivix 12:46, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Mattel did not "widen Barbie's waist" in response to criticism. The waist shape was changed to allow the doll to wear more up do date clothing, particularly low-rise pants. (The previous body couldn't accomodate these types of clothing.) And although the waist was wider from side to side, the circumfrence was almost the same. I have corrected similar statements added to this entry several times in the past but it is always eventually rewritten to include the same misinformation, so it doesn't seem like there's much point in doing it again. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 67.187.189.139 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_67.187.189.139_9263.html" title="Special:Contributions/67.187.189.139">contribs</a>) 11:54, 20 October 2006 (UTC).</small></p>
<p>It is not disputed that the waist of Barbie was redesigned in the late 1990s, along with her hips and lips. Whether the doll now has a larger waist if she were a real woman is hard to say, as there have been many estimates of what Barbie's vital statistics would be if she were a real woman. The text has been rewritten slightly to reflect this.--<a href="../../../i/a/n/User%7EIanmacm_cc9f.html" title="User:Ianmacm">Ianmacm</a> 13:08, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Actually, Barbie's body was replaced by a completely new one, from top to bottom. Olivix 19:24, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Some of the material from the timeline has been moved to the main text as suggested. The timeline is not ideal but it does contain some useful information.--<a href="../../../i/a/n/User%7EIanmacm_cc9f.html" title="User:Ianmacm">Ianmacm</a> 15:23, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Ideally the timeline should be axed altogether, although there is some information in it that could be moved to the main part of the text.

<p>The timeline has been axed, with only a small amount of the information from it making its way into the main text. The main purpose of the current text cleanup has been to remove <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Laundromat" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Laundromat" rel="nofollow">excessive lists</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:N" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:N" rel="nofollow">non-notable</a> material. If everyone comes along and adds their favourite Barbie fact, the page will soon become too long and lacking in overall structure. The <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barbie.html" title="Barbie">Barbie</a> page has been prone to this problem in the past. The page is also the regular target of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Vandalism" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Vandalism" rel="nofollow">vandalism</a>, so there is likely to be plenty of work needed to keep the page looking good.--<a href="../../../i/a/n/User%7EIanmacm_cc9f.html" title="User:Ianmacm">Ianmacm</a> 13:15, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The timeline has been removed after it was put back again. Rather than get into an edit war on this, it would be better to find some external links containing this information and put them at the bottom of the page.--<a href="../../../i/a/n/User%7EIanmacm_cc9f.html" title="User:Ianmacm">Ianmacm</a> 07:06, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>It would be a pity to have to semi-protect this page, but at the moment it is rarely up for 24 hours without users (usually unregistered) adding nonsense or blanking the page. If the current rate of disruption continues, semi-protection is an option that may need to be looked at. The <a href="../../../b/r/a/Bratz.html" title="Bratz">Bratz</a> page was semi-protected a while ago for the same reason.--<a href="../../../i/a/n/User%7EIanmacm_cc9f.html" title="User:Ianmacm">Ianmacm</a> 07:19, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Although, I don't like the doll, it's a good idea to semi-protect the article, because the anonymous users use the article to write their wraths about the Barbie doll and destroying the article. About semi-protecting the <a href="../../../b/r/a/Bratz.html" title="Bratz">Bratz</a> page is that I wanted to semi-protect it, however somehow the protection didn't work. It was because that an unregistered user added the list of the 2006 collections, during the time, he or she destroys the Bratz's History and the Media section. The collections list appear at this <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Bratz_products_c4e1.html" title="List of Bratz products">article</a>. It would be good to semi-protect the Bratz article, too, because the other unregistered users write different kinds of nonsenses, like they say, Bratz suggests homosexuality, they think they're prostitutes, etc. The same things as they think about the Barbie dolls, too, I think. My complaints about the negative thoughts about the Bratz by the way is <a href="../../../b/r/a/Talk%7EBratz_deec.html#Bratz_as_prostitutes.3F.21" title="Talk:Bratz">here</a>. 86.101.211.226 19:23 CET, 3 November 2006</p>
<p>I agree that this article should be semi-protected. I have tried to remove incorrect information and vandalism many many times in the past, only to return later and see that the same sorts of things have been added back in. This does a great disservice to people who are looking to this article for factual information. It's always littered with POV, agenda-base comments and incorrect assumptions.

<p>By the way, can we write to the article about a study, which says little British girls brutally destroy Barbie dolls.

<dd>I see the section is gone but the link remains. Perhaps it should be accompanied by text similar to the following: "The production run of more recent Barbies is tied to a color-coded "tier" system of collectibility.<a href="http://www.tableandhome.com/education/barbie.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.tableandhome.com/education/barbie.html" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> However, other factors such as controversy and recalls may also affect a particular doll's market value." That would distinguish the subject of dolls issued as collectibles from the subject of collecting vintage ones. (If that second sentence caveat is included, it needs a citation, perhaps to something about the tattoo and piercing controversies of several years back.) Also, it might be nice to mention in passing the different "eras" identified in Barbie collecting (vintage, mod, etc.) <a href="../../../m/a/v/User%7EMavarin_fb6d.html" title="User:Mavarin">Karen</a> | <a href="../../../m/a/v/User_talk%7EMavarin_8ade.html" title="User talk:Mavarin">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mavarin_e910.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mavarin">contribs</a> 21:36, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Previous edits of the article <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barbie.html" title="Barbie">Barbie</a> have included long lists of the collector's editions which were not very interesting to the general reader and against good Wikipedia style. I removed the text about the colour coding system because I did not want the article to read too much like a promo for Mattel, and because the info about the colour coding system did not seem to meet the threshold of notability required for the article. There is some scope for expanding the "collecting" section because it is quite short, but I'm not sure if the colour coding system is the best way to go. Most of the really collectible Barbies come from the early years, and when the dolls are sold as collectible today it is largely as part of Mattel's marketing strategy. At the time that Barbie was launched in 1959, nobody realised that the doll would become so famous, and this is why the early dolls are now so sought after. There is also an an enormous range of ethnic Barbies, Barbie and Ken as Lily and Herman Munster (see this here: <a href="http://www.barbiecollector.com/showcase/product.asp?type=&amp;subtype=&amp;product_id=1001084&amp;series_id=150063" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.barbiecollector.com/showcase/product.asp?type=&amp;subtype=&amp;product_id=1001084&amp;series_id=150063" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>) etc etc. I am a bit wary of starting anything that may lead to a list, as this can soon spiral out of control in a Wikipedia article. There are simply too many Barbie collector's editions to list them all, and the colour coding scheme is only one of the ways in which the dolls are marketed. Nevertheless, I will take your comments on board and look at ways of expanding the collecting section while keeping it reasonably brief and without lists.--<a href="../../../i/a/n/User%7EIanmacm_cc9f.html" title="User:Ianmacm">Ianmacm</a> 23:18, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree completely. It should be possible to give a very brief overview of subject of Barbie collecting (age and rarity vs. marketing strategy, areas of specialization, etc.) without discussing specific ranges of dolls. A few sentences should suffice to give the reader a general idea of the field without getting bogged down in details. <a href="../../../m/a/v/User%7EMavarin_fb6d.html" title="User:Mavarin">Karen</a> | <a href="../../../m/a/v/User_talk%7EMavarin_8ade.html" title="User talk:Mavarin">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mavarin_e910.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mavarin">contribs</a> 23:37, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I agree, I didn't realize how much of a marketing opp it is for Mattel, I was thinking the site just needed more collector info. I agree on the fact that the first Barbies made are the actual collector dolls compared to the new color tier that Mattel has put out. pinktuliptah | Talk 08:01, 16, November 2006</p>
<p>I have expanded the section on Barbie collecting while maintaining a distinction between the vintage dolls and the modern collector's editions. The "Color Tier" system was devised by Mattel in 2004 so it is a relatively recent idea, and it needs to be distinguished from the market for vintage Barbie dolls which are genuinely rare compared to some of the collector's editions. The way in which the <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barbie.html" title="Barbie">Barbie</a> article is written is designed to give an overview of the various topics with relevant external links, and this prevents the article from becoming too long which has been a problem in the past.--<a href="../../../i/a/n/User%7EIanmacm_cc9f.html" title="User:Ianmacm">Ianmacm</a> 20:21, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This was rv'ed from the article on 22 November 2006, largely for reasons of keeping the article's length down:</p>
<ul>
<li>In May 1997 Mattel introduced Share a Smile Becky a doll in a hot pink wheelchair. Unfortuantely, the Barbie Dream House was not hadicapped accessible.

<dd>I did a copyedit on this, but was sidetracked before posting it, by which time you had reverted. It seems at least vaguely notable, and at least it's sourced, so I'll put it back in for now.

<p>I agree that Share a Smile Becky should get a mention, because the story received a good deal of media coverage at the time, and it highlighted the problems faced by people in wheelchairs. To be fair to Mattel, the article at <a href="http://www.washington.edu/doit/Press/barbie.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.washington.edu/doit/Press/barbie.html" rel="nofollow">[9]</a> points out that the design of the Dream House had been around for several years before Share a Smile Becky arrived on the scene. It is also worth noting that 1997 was the all-time vintage year for Barbie controversies, with Aqua's Barbie Birl, the Nissan commercial and Oreo Fun Barbie all occurring in 1997.--<a href="../../../i/a/n/User%7EIanmacm_cc9f.html" title="User:Ianmacm">Ianmacm</a> 20:14, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>On 24 November 2006 the opening paragraph was altered to read as follows:</p>
<p><i><b>Barbie</b> is a piece of crapy plastic that perverted 4 year olds adore. Unfortunately it is also the best-selling <a href="../../../d/o/l/Doll.html" title="Doll">doll</a> launched at the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_International_Toy_Fair_d0f6.html" title="American International Toy Fair">American International Toy Fair</a> on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_9.html" title="March 9">March 9</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/5/1959.html" title="1959">1959</a>. The doll is a cheating slut who cuts out on 6 of her 9 husband one of whoms name is Steve. He was a scuba diving whale massacrer produced by <a href="../../../m/a/t/Mattel.html" title="Mattel">Mattel, Inc.</a> It is manufactured to approximately <a href="../../../6/_/s/1%7E6_scale.html" title="1:6 scale">1/6th scale</a>, which is also known as playscale. <a href="http://miniatures.about.com/od/playscale/" class="external autonumber" title="http://miniatures.about.com/od/playscale/" rel="nofollow">[10]</a></i></p>
<p>This sort of thing happens regularly to the Wikipedia article <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barbie.html" title="Barbie">Barbie</a>, and is worth a mention since it requires a lot of work to remove it. My guess is that it is mostly children who do it, and it illustrates how Barbie can produce strong negative reactions, as the research at the University of Bath by Dr. Agnes Nairn showed. <a href="http://www.bath.ac.uk/news/articles/releases/barbie161205.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bath.ac.uk/news/articles/releases/barbie161205.html" rel="nofollow">[11]</a>]--<a href="../../../i/a/n/User%7EIanmacm_cc9f.html" title="User:Ianmacm">Ianmacm</a> 09:42, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Is there any way to block this article from anonymous editing? <a href="../../../s/e/x/User%7ESextiliana_7107.html" title="User:Sextiliana">Joe Webster</a> 21:44, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yes there is, by asking the administrators at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_page_protection" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_page_protection" rel="nofollow">[12]</a>. This prevents a page from being edited by unregistered users or accounts less than four days old. The article <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barbie.html" title="Barbie">Barbie</a> was semi-protected a few weeks ago due to repeated vandalism, but this has expired as it is not Wikipedia policy to have long term semi-protection of pages. While the <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barbie.html" title="Barbie">Barbie</a> article was semi-protected, the number of vandal edits dropped to zero, since the people who do this are almost invariably acting from IP based accounts, which makes tracing and blocking the user almost futile. There is a case for taking a stronger line on repeated IP vandalism, as the <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barbie.html" title="Barbie">Barbie</a> article shows. Anyone with something serious to say has nothing to fear from registering as a user, which takes only a few moments. On a personal note, it is getting tiring to remove silly comments like the one above, and this is happening on a daily basis. The only good thing is that most of the very silly edits are picked up automatically by the vandalbot, but some vandal edits are subtle and require constant re-reading of the page to make sure that nonsense has not been inserted. If you feel strongly about this issue, ask an administrator to semi-protect the page.--<a href="../../../i/a/n/User%7EIanmacm_cc9f.html" title="User:Ianmacm">Ianmacm</a> 22:05, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>That's one of the things a watchlist is for, IMO. Any time an IP edit hits my watchlist, and most times even when it's a non-IP edit from someone whose account name I don't recognize, I check the page history. The "diffs" usually make it easy to see exactly what someone did. Then one can open the previous version of the page and save it as a revert.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>That said, it does seem silly and tiresome that this article has sometimes a dozen vandal edits a day, most of them far less creative than the one cited above. I'd love to see a registered uses only rule around here, because it would cut down the incidence of vandalism quite a bit. Look at the Talk page for any IP account that does this stuff, and you'll usually see a whole series of warnings and blocks - and sometimes, a notice that the IP is for a school somewhere. <a href="../../../m/a/v/User%7EMavarin_fb6d.html" title="User:Mavarin">Karen</a> | <a href="../../../m/a/v/User_talk%7EMavarin_8ade.html" title="User talk:Mavarin">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mavarin_e910.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mavarin">contribs</a> 01:18, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The article <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barbie.html" title="Barbie">Barbie</a> has been semi-protected for a while now, and there will be no complaints about this from me. On the last two occasions that it was unprotected, there was a daily round of vandalism and blanking, often by schoolchildren and other IP users with nothing better to do. This led to a lot of work on reverts, and also spoiled the page for serious people who wanted to read it. Maybe Wikipedia should look at an account holders only policy, since IP addresses at educational institutions and other IP addresses are often used for acts of vandalism. However, a discussion on this issue is beyond the scope of this talk page.--<a href="../../../i/a/n/User%7EIanmacm_cc9f.html" title="User:Ianmacm">Ianmacm</a> 19:58, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>12:33, 17 December 2006 (UTC)72.138.160.36I have watched the 1954 film "White Christmas", starring Danny Kaye, Bing Crosby, Vera Ellen and Rosemary Clooney, a number of times and noticed the incredible resemblance of the Barbie doll to Vera Ellen. (I have a 1963 or 1964 Barbie and have compared doll to movie.)</p>
<p>You will notice that the legs, hips, waist, torso, facial structure and features, and the hair, of Vera Ellen are a very close match for those of Barbie. Just watch the film and see what you think.</p>
<p>So convinced had I become that Vera Ellen was the model for Barbie that, when I found this Web site, I was surprised to find out that the Lilli Bild doll was the source instead. However, I don't see here a picture of Lilli Bild and am wondering if the German doll might have used Vera Ellen as its source.</p>
<p>Anyone interested should get a copy of "White Christmas" and check out this uncanny resemblance for themselves. (Another small note of interest&#160;: Vera Ellen suffered from anorexia.)</p>
<p>There is a picture of the <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bild_Lilli_doll_e628.html" title="Bild Lilli doll">Bild Lilli doll</a> in a separate Wikipedia article linked from the <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barbie.html" title="Barbie">Barbie</a> article.

<p>I think the old Barbie dolls look like Doris Day - but I´m sure she wasn´t the model for them. Women in the Fifties tried to achieve the same beauty ideal embodied in the doll - hence the resemblance. 89.51.17.9 19:58, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The first paragraph in the article says that Barbie dolls and accessories are made in approximately 1/6th scale. This may be true of most Barbie dolls and accessories, but certainly not all. For a brief period, Mattel made some Barbie dolls that were 18 inches tall. There have also been the My Size Barbie dolls which are about 3 feet tall. In the last couple of years, Mattel has introduced the Mini Kingdom Barbie dolls which are about 6 inches tall. The dolls in the Barbie and Me series are shaped so unrealistically that I'm not sure they could be said to have a true scale. And in the last couple of years, Mattel has released two of Barbie's sisters, Kelly and Stacie, in a larger scale than 1/6th.</p>
<p>I was wondering whether the subject of composition should be covered in the Development section. Most dolls in the Barbie line are made of plastic and vinyl, but not all. As was noted in the Collecting section, some dolls have been made of porcelain. A relatively new series of dolls (Barbie Fashion Model Collection) are made of a material called Silkstone that Mattel developed and trademarked. There have also been Barbie dolls made with cloth bodies, though I believe these have been limited to an occasional bedtime Barbie doll dressed in pajamas and the new Barbie and Me series.</p>
<p>I wouldn't recommend trying to list all of the face molds used in the Barbie line, and there does seem to be a comprehensive list of Barbie's friends and relatives on a separate page, but I still wondered whether it would be worth touching on the topic of face molds and identities in the Barbie line. Face molds developed for Barbie herself have later been used for her friends. (The Oriental face was developed for Barbie but was later used almost exclusively for Kira.) And face molds developed for Barbie's friends have also been used later for Barbie herself. (The Diva face mold was developed for a character in Barbie's band: Barbie and the Rockers, but that face mold was used for the Chinese Empress Barbie doll and has become the face mold typically used for Barbie's best friend Midge.) Another wrinkle to the subject is Mattel's tendency to recycle names. Barbie has a British chum named Stacey and a younger sister named Stacie, and Barbie's cousin Jazzie has a friend named Stacie; Barbie has a friend named Kelley and a younger sister named Kelly; Generation Girl Barbie has a friend named Chelsie Peterson, My Scene Barbie has a friend named Chelsea, Barbie's younger sister Kelly has a friend named Chelsie, and Barbie's cousin Jazzie has a friend named Chelsie; Modern Circle Barbie has a friend named Simone, and American Idol Barbie has a friend/competitor named Simone; Barbie has a My Scene friend named Ryan, and her best friend Midge has a son named Ryan; Fashion Fever Barbie has a friend named Nikki, Barbie's younger sister Kelly has a friend named Nikki, and Barbie's best friend Midge has a daughter named Nikki; one of Barbie's friends is Fashion Fever Courtney, and although Barbie Diaries Courtney may be the same character, Barbie's younger sister Skipper also has a friend named Courtney; Barbie has a friend named Whitney, and Barbie's younger sister Stacie has a friend named Whitney; Barbie also has friends named Becky, Nia, Belinda, Kayla, and Tori, and so does her younger sister Kelly. There's no point in trying to keep up with all the name duplications in the Barbie line, but it might be worth mentioning in the article or on the page of Barbie's friends and family, because it's something that does cause confusion.

<p>You are right to point out that not all Barbie dolls and accessories are made to 1/6 scale. A standard Barbie doll is 11.5 inches tall, giving a "real" height of 5 feet nine inches at 1/6 scale. Over the years there have been dolls larger and smaller than this, such as the new <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barbie_Mini_Kingdom_48bc.html" title="Barbie Mini Kingdom">Barbie Mini Kingdom</a> dolls that are around 6 inches (15cm) high. In 1977 there was Super Size Barbie at 18 inches (45cm) tall, which works out at approximately 1/3.5 scale. To get around this problem, I have rewritten the wording in the opening paragraph to make clear that standard Barbie dolls (the vast majority sold) are at 1/6 scale or thereabouts.</p>
<p>On the question of the face molds etc., the article is a general encyclopedia article and should not become too heavily bogged down in details that would not be of interest to the average reader. Entire books and websites have been written about Barbie, but there is not the space to do this in an encyclopedia article designed for a general audience. There are many external links that can be followed , for example www.barbiecollector.com , that give extensive details in this area. Barbiecollector.com is a large online resource for Barbie enthusiasts (who take the subject very seriously) and it would be unwise for Wikipedia to try to compete in this area. There are so many collector's edition Barbies that it is simply not practical to list or describe them all, so external links are the most help here. --<a href="../../../i/a/n/User%7EIanmacm_cc9f.html" title="User:Ianmacm">Ianmacm</a> 20:30, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I would never suggest that Wikipedia try to list all the "collectible" dolls from the Barbie line. That's outside the scope of an encyclopedia. Documenting all the face molds used in the Barbie line is also outside that scope. I was thinking of a general note along the line of "Some of the face molds developed for Barbie doll have later been used for her friends, and vice versa. This reuse of face molds, and the appearance of multiple characters with the same name in Barbie's ever increasing circle of acquaintances can make it difficult to positively identify the fictional character for a doll within the Barbie line after it has been removed from it's packaging." I shouldn't think that much more detail than that would be wanted, but honestly even such a general note may be outside the area of general interest. I didn't intend to recommend such an addition; I just wanted to toss the idea onto the discussion page to see if others thought it had any merit.</dd>

<dd>I may have found a page where the information about reusing names and face molds would be more appropriate. I'm going to see how people feel about posting it there. SirenDrake 00:20, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>One point about the composition of Barbie dolls that is worth mentioning is the controversy about "toxic Barbies" that was in the news in March 2000. The Wikipedia article <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polyvinyl_chloride.html" title="Polyvinyl chloride">Polyvinyl chloride</a> shows that there is still some debate about the safety of vinyl as a material for toys. Modern Barbie doll bodies are made from <a href="../../../a/c/r/Acrylonitrile_butadiene_styrene.html" title="Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene">ABS</a> plastic (the same material as <a href="../../../l/e/g/LEGO_045a.html" title="LEGO">LEGO</a> bricks), while the head is made from soft PVC. Both materials are widely used in the toy industry. Incidentally, the link given at <a href="http://collectdolls.about.com/library/ucbarbieresponse.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://collectdolls.about.com/library/ucbarbieresponse.htm" rel="nofollow">[16]</a> about vinyl safety has a picture of the original 1959 Barbie in zebra striped swimsuit. There is no photo of this important Barbie in the article due to the ongoing difficulty in finding a version that is copyright free, so it is worth a quick look at this link. The About.com website that carries the link is another good online resource for doll collectors.--<a href="../../../i/a/n/User%7EIanmacm_cc9f.html" title="User:Ianmacm">Ianmacm</a> 21:28, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Someone defaced two of the pictures in the article today, see the image on the right for one of them. This showed <i>some</i> originality, so here is a popular Barbie joke that used to be in the article before it was removed for reasons of space:</p>
<p><i>A man goes into a shop to buy a Barbie doll for his daughter, looks at the various models on display and asks the shop assistant in a puzzled way: "Why is Divorced Barbie so much more expensive than the other dolls?" "That's easy, sir" replies the shop assistant, "Divorced Barbie comes with Ken's car, Ken's house, Ken's furniture..."</i> --<a href="../../../i/a/n/User%7EIanmacm_cc9f.html" title="User:Ianmacm">Ianmacm</a> 16:36, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
