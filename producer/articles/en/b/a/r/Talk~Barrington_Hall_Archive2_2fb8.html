<li>Note: I think it would be interesting to try to change RS to state that publicists cannot pitch stories to journalists, or that journalists cannot publish on any subject they like, at any time, for any reason. This all seems so overheated. Do you think it is possible that you don't care about the graffiti at all, but that you were very frustrated after the Foundation called the You Tube deletion project "lazy and paranoid"? The timing seems to coincide. I'm sorry they called your project "lazy and paranoid," and hope you feel better about it soon, if that is what is bothering you.-<a href="../../../c/i/n/User%7ECindery_01fc.html" title="User:Cindery">Cindery</a> 00:50, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Hmm. Can you state exactly how a registered email address is insufficient to prove identity? (Also, let's be fair about the "half dozen"--I see familiar names here from the EL/YT discussions who have never edited Barrington Hall. Also, someone I completely avoid, who admitted on ANI to creating a sockpuppet that was used only to comment on this talkpage. Hmm. It doesn't seem that this "half-dozen" has demonstrated any real interest in this article, or the subject of graffiti, etc. Wikipedia is not a democracy...and you would have a particularly weak "consensus" argument here, I think.)

<li>Sometimes sources involve oral history or personal interviews. This is a simple fact of researching. While it isn't ideal in the context of an encyclopedia it is most definitely necessary under many circumstances. This isn't an article about scientific discoveries that were published in peer-reviewed periodicals. Cindery and I were there and we are recognized authorities regarding the history of Barrington Hall. We don't edit and maintain this article for personal grandisement - we do it as a result of our unique store of information regarding it. We work with several other former Barrington Residents and together we make for formidable sources on Barrington history and lore.

<dd>I think you should stop with that line of thought and realise that any editor can edit any page so long as it follows the rules.</dd>
<dd>Anyway, to comment on the email address link. Cindery, have you ever received one of those annoying Paypal scams via email? They look legit but are copies. They nearly always contain the official logo, contact details and links to the site. This is why having an email address on a blog, which added information to it <i>after</i> it was added here, does not make it a reliable source. If you do know Jane Dark, why not get them to simply link to the new blog from their old one? It isn't difficult for them to do and would help clear this mess up a bit.</dd>
<dd>Also, you say that the list is of 'most memorable' bits of graffiti but I would ask you to remember <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> and realise that saying that is using a <a href="../../../w/e/a/WP%7EWEASEL_bba5.html" title="WP:WEASEL">weasel</a> word. Who says they are the most memorable? Why do they have the authority to say this?</dd>
<dd>I would suggest that the list is not suitable for this site, but would be well suited to wikiquote with a interwiki link in this article.</dd>
<dd>AStanhope - the verifiability policy is not negotiable. The site is about verifiability and not truth (which is a bit of a simplification btw). I would suggest that you take a read of that policy and also <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">this</a> one.</dd>
<dd>Finally, I will say it again - do not comment on where people edit. People are free to edit any page on this site so long as it is within the rules. We don't have to justify why we take part in discussions.-<a href="../../../l/o/c/User%7ELocalzuk_3f68.html" title="User:Localzuk">Localzuk</a><sup><a href="../../../l/o/c/User_talk%7ELocalzuk_0fb5.html" title="User talk:Localzuk">(talk)</a></sup> 08:32, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>What are you on about? Sorry to be blunt but you are going round in circles. We have 2 sites - one of which is janedark.com and the other is a free blog. I have no problem with the janedark.com one which is hers. The problem I have is that stating that the other one is hers is original research without a statement from her saying so. We have a link from one site to another and an email address but that is all - no claim that one is in fact hers. If you do indeed know her, why not just get this claim added to the janedark.com site? It would save all this mess. Then we can move onto discussing other things.-<a href="../../../l/o/c/User%7ELocalzuk_3f68.html" title="User:Localzuk">Localzuk</a><sup><a href="../../../l/o/c/User_talk%7ELocalzuk_0fb5.html" title="User talk:Localzuk">(talk)</a></sup> 10:22, 19 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The point was already conceded by the "other people" that Jane Dark is a reliable source. I think <i>too much</i> good faith was extended by the regular editors of this article while the dicussions continued with people who have never edited it about whether Jane Dark is Jane Dark--tags allowed to stay, blanking tolerated, registered domain humored as insufficient proof of identity (and Milo has now repeatedly deleted the entire list, which includes a graffito which has never been disputed, which does not reflect that he is paying attention to the dicussion). I think at this point an ANI report for edit warring and disruption may be necessary.-<a href="../../../c/i/n/User%7ECindery_01fc.html" title="User:Cindery">Cindery</a> 20:02, 19 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I have re-read it, since it's not the first time you've made such a groundless accusation. It says that harassment is "Following an editor to another article to continue disruption", and that "...The important part is the disruption." Do you think I've been disruptive here (or anywhere, for that matter)? The "sock puppet" issue I reported to AN/I myself (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;oldid=96457056#Reporting_myself_for_scrutiny_of_sock_account_use" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;oldid=96457056#Reporting_myself_for_scrutiny_of_sock_account_use" rel="nofollow">see here</a>). If you have a problem with me, you're experienced enough with <a href="../../../d/r/_/WP%7EDR_4e9d.html" title="WP:DR">dispute resolution</a> to know how to proceed; repeating groundless ad hominem accusations every time you disagree with me, or every time your own conduct is scrutinized, is unconstructive.

<dd>You have obviously not seen the evidence at ANI that he has wikistalked me, which makes his participation here disruptive in and of itself. The next issue to address will be the issue of editors who may be disgruntled that the You Tube link was allowed to stay. Your only contributions to this article, Localzuk, were arguments against the You Tube link, until you joined a dispute about the graffiti. Many of your comments in particular have been less than civil. And the dispute overall is far out of proportion to the seriousness of the matter. I doubt that impartial observers would fail to note that the EL crew has moved on to the graffiti issue, and that it is disrupting rather than serving the article/Wikipedia.-<a href="../../../c/i/n/User%7ECindery_01fc.html" title="User:Cindery">Cindery</a> 03:52, 20 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I have seen the evidence at AN/I and I do not feel it is a case of wikistalking. I assume good faith and believe MastCell that the posting with the other account was an accident and his editing has not been disruptive.</dd>
<dd>Second, I do not care one bit about the Youtube link - it is a pointless blip in the history of wikipedia. Unless you stop your accusations of ulterior motives, I do not see how this discussion can move on. Also, I would say that a discussion on a talk page is not disruptive - the article is fairly stable but it is allowing issues to be worked out about maintaining the quality of the page.</dd>

<p>At this point, who considers the bonussugar blog a reliable source? Personally I don't. The first concern is that we don't have verification that it truly belongs to Jane Dark. And beyond that, even if it does, I consider it unreliable because it has no editorial oversight or fact checking, there's no evidence that the author (whoever it is) has researched Barrington Hall or is an expert in that subject, because blogs are generally questionable sources, and because the info can't be confirmed by any other source (which also raises notability questions). I'd appreciate if others would weigh in on this, particularly now that Cindery is insisting that everyone but me agrees it's a reliable source and is threatening to report me to ANI if I revert her addition again. I just want to make sure editors' positions are clear and that Cindery isn't misrepresenting anyone. --<a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMilo_H_Minderbinder_261f.html" title="User:Milo H Minderbinder">Milo H Minderbinder</a> 20:41, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>First of all, use of blogs (especially new ones) has always been highly controversial on wikipeida. And any page that creates evidence because of a dispute on a wikipedia page to be used as a source on wikipedia is highly suspect and shouldn't be used for a number of reasons. That's two strikes in my book. However, at this point I think it's clear that the bonus-sugar is legitimatly owned by Jane Dark. Jane, or someone else with access, edited an old post to include a link to bonus sugar. That's confirmation enough for me that the connection from JaneDark.com -&gt; BonusSugar is legitimate. I still think that a list of graffiti quotes is too <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">indiscriminate</a> to be appropriate for wikipedia.</dd>
<dd>On the other hand, the claims being made aren't extraordinary/controversial and despite some of the weakest sourcing attempts I've <b>ever</b> seen I'm willing to drop the subject.</dd>
<dd>So... basically, yes, I'm still against inclusion, but I don't think it's important enough of an issue at this time to spend any more effort on it. ---<a href="../../../j/2E/s/User%7EJ.smith_e018.html" title="User:J.smith">J.S</a> <small>(<a href="../../../j/2E/s/User_talk%7EJ.smith_6ef6.html" title="User talk:J.smith">T</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_J.smith_698b.html" title="Special:Contributions/J.smith">C</a>/<a href="../../../w/r/e/WP%7EWRE_9138.html" title="WP:WRE">WRE</a>)</small> 21:00, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Note: The Bancroft library at UC Berkeley is the rare book library. It is not a circulation library. The "Barrington Miscellany" files cannot be checked out. You must go in person to the library, and not everyone is admitted to the library. If I merely wanted to "invent" a citation for something, I could say it is in those files. However, I have repeatedly demonstrated a high degree of concern for the accuracy of this article, and I have provided the majority of the references/done the most research. (I imagine that Jane Dark's log of the graffiti will find its way to the Bancroft, and that the Green Book will probably be updated shortly to include an appendix which notes graffitos. If that happens, I think the Green Book would be a good online complement reference to Jane Dark. Although there is no requirement that sources be available online, I think it is helpful to have them, because they are easier for other editors to check for themselves.</li>

<dd>I don't consider the blog a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a>. Regardless of whether the posting was solicited by Cindery, or who owns the blog, it appeared <i>after</i> the relevant information was tagged with "cite needed" here, and appeared to be a direct response to discussion here. I don't think that's bad faith; it's a reasonable interpretation of events. That said, we're talking about graffiti on a co-op wall. Cindery, AStanhope, and Argyriou lived there and all feel it's important. I guess you could just invoke <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a>, say it makes the article significantly better, and include it. Whatever. What I (and, I think, others) object to is the <a href="../../../w/i/k/WP%7EWikilawyering_fdcf.html" title="WP:Wikilawyering">Wikilawyering</a> on <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> and the claim that this blog posting, which appears to have been made in response to events here, somehow fulfills these policy/guidelines. Finally, there's certainly an edit war going on. The folks at <a href="../../../a/n/2F/WP%7EAN_I_9983.html" title="WP:AN/I">WP:AN/I</a> are unlikely to think one editor holds the moral high ground here, and reporting it will get the page protected and likely a rebuke for all involved.

Cindery, please can you tell us once and for all why you think the blog of someone which is poorly linked to another blog, and is by a person who, as others have said, is unavailable to find in public libraries should be seen as a reliable source.

<dd>Verification that the source is the source have already been provided, the quality of the source has already been established, and the significance of the graffiti has already been established. There is no need to have the same discussions over and over. Again, I note that your only contributions to this article have been to the talkpage, during the You Tube dispute, and then in a dispute over this source which was started by a member of the You Tube deletion team (who has had the good sense to drop it.)

<dd>Obviously the other editors here don't agree that the source has been verified, that it is of sufficient quality, and that the graffiti is significant. You have asserted these things, but WP is edited by consensus - just because you believe something and keep insisting it doesn't mean that the other editors will agree. And articles are edited based on what achieves consensus agreement. It would be unfortunate if this came to an RfC, but I'm sure it certainly would get plenty of support if that was necessary. --<a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMilo_H_Minderbinder_261f.html" title="User:Milo H Minderbinder">Milo H Minderbinder</a> 20:26, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Is LSD punch notable? This was Berkeley, didn't everyone have LSD punch? This is an encyclopedia. It should not be written in the style of a blog. Worse it should not be citing blogs as a source. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_D._77aa.html" title="User:David D.">David D.</a> <a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavid_D._d1e6.html" title="User talk:David D.">(Talk)</a> 23:03, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Cindery and I spent part of our lives living at and managing Barrington Hall. We are authorities on Barrington Hall. We want the Barrington Hall article to be as truthful, accurate and complete as possible. The graffiti is a very important aspect of Barrington's history and lore. There is no better source for the graffiti than people who actually lived there and experienced life there. There is no debate as to whether or not Barrington Hall merits its own article - all of us agree that it does. Traditional published sources regarding the history of Barrington Hall are almost non-existent. The Wikipedia article on Barrington Hall has the potential of being the single most informative resource on the internet about this building. Our personal knowledge of the place is absolutely crucial to telling the Barrington Hall story in the best way possible. * * * You are treating Cindery and I like children or amateurs. Both of us are hard-working Wikipedia editors with numerous contributions over several years to the Wikipedia. Your objections to our work here on the Barrington article appear to be petty and vindictive. Why can't you simply leave the article to us to maintain? There are hundreds of thousands of Wikipedia articles, many of which are crying out for attention. Why not focus your energy on one of them? --<a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAstanhope_1188.html" title="User:Astanhope">AStanhope</a> 23:12, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Argument from authority does not count for anything. Verfiable does. I have not doubted the article has merit, but it is written in a style that is a memoir more than an encyclopedic article. Why is the graffiti important? At present there is just a bunch of graffiti, I can see that stuff in any bathroom in the US, why is it notable enough for inclusion in wikipedia?</dd>
<dd>Not sure why you think people are vindictive? Most people seem to be trying to improve the quality of this article. By the way why is the LSD punch notable enough to be included in the history of Barrington hall?</dd>
<dd>Have you considered that you can write a good article with just the verifiable material? Your point here "<i>The Wikipedia article on Barrington Hall has the potential of being the single most informative resource</i> " seems to miss the point of wikipedia. Its goal is to catalog the informative sources not be THE primary source on a topic. I am not trying to treat you like a like child or an amateur but judging from this talk page your time would be better spent writing a book and getting a recognised publisher interested in the project. That format would be more suitable to the style you seem to prefer. Or you could listen to the advice that people here are giving you and save your time here by avoiding all these edit wars. If you do not take the advice i think you'll find this becomes a perpetual battle for you. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_D._77aa.html" title="User:David D.">David D.</a> <a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavid_D._d1e6.html" title="User talk:David D.">(Talk)</a> 23:30, 19 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Again, I would ask that you read the previous recent discussions regarding the graffiti, as it is clearly explained why it is significant. I don't mind having the discussion once, but once it's up--and recent--it is incumbent upon new contributors new to read it, so that they can contribute usefully to the conversation..-<a href="../../../c/i/n/User%7ECindery_01fc.html" title="User:Cindery">Cindery</a> 23:51, 19 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I've just done a global search of this Talk page for the word "significant" and I don't see anything that explains why they are significant, except for the personal testimony of Wikipedians.</dd>
<dd>And as I mentioned above, a Google search on the exact phrases <a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=active&amp;client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=%22shopping+days+till+Armageddon%22&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=active&amp;client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=%22shopping+days+till+Armageddon%22&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">"shopping days till Armageddon"</a> and <a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=active&amp;client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=%22shopping+days+til+Armageddon%22&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=active&amp;client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=%22shopping+days+til+Armageddon%22&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">"shopping days til Armageddon"</a> turn up a handful of hits mentioning occurrence e.g. in a TV series, but none except this Wikipedia article itself that mention Barrington Hall. I'm not at all convinced that these are anything other than perfectly ordinary campus graffiti.</dd>
<dd>But the <b>big</b> problem is that you have no published source for them. I've already said that I would consider the <b>Daily Californian</b> or a local newspaper a perfectly good source. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 00:19, 20 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Well, I'm glad you brought that up, Dpbsmith. It might seem amazing, but not all sources are online! (I advise reading User: Wjohnson's talkpage--he spells out the difference between "original research" and "research" very well. I.e, research is research, nor orginal research, and it can't all be done online. The "I can't find it on Google!" attitude has been noted as a general fault of Wikipedia. Meanwhile, we have a published source, from a regular NYT contributor, poet, and author, who maintains a blog noted by the Academy of American poets. That's a better source than the Daily Cal (which is not available online for the 80s.)-<a href="../../../c/i/n/User%7ECindery_01fc.html" title="User:Cindery">Cindery</a> 00:28, 20 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I must have missed the significance discussion. I have read through this page and I didn't see any case being made for the graffiti's significance. Since you are not willing to repeat it, at least point us to this discussion?</dd>
<dd>With respect to your source, it is not, the blog cannot be used as a source. If the author had been interviewed about the graffiti for an artilcle that was then published in a reliable source then it would be acceptable. Whether she is credible does not come into the equation. We don't work with truth, we work with verifiable, notable information. I'm not sure why you keep mentioning google because many would accept a source that is available in a library. I know it sounds dull, but that is the role an encyclopedia plays.

<p>(undent) No, I think if you are going to join a dispute, you should read through the most recent previous discussions, so you can contribute meaningfully to the discussion, and so the same things aren't repeated over and over--start at the top, with "graffiti."

<dd>I did, again. Only mentions it as memorable (to who?, you? then its vanity and not notable). You imply it has some cultural impact, but how, where, on who. No mention of this.

<p>I'm not going to check them all, but if you give me some guidance as to which it probably is I'll take a look.

<dd>The Green Book website has a pdf version, which can be easily text searched.

<dd>I think there is a misunderstanding regarding general and specific. The Green Book, and most of the refs for the article, note that graffiti was a notable Barrington phenomenon. Jane Dark noted <i>specific</i> graffiti. (It is noted elsewhere in the discussion that some graffit was "muralized," making it particularly significant, and that records of house council meetings record the muralizations, and are located in the Bancroft library, which is not accessible online. In the case of "Fuck the Dead," it was painted in letters three feet high on Dwight Wy. for more than a decade--that graffito is exemplary/notable because no one who drive down Dwight Wy, a main drag, between 1978 and 1989 could have failed to notice it. "time is a crutch, eat mandarin oranges" (not dissimilar from Bukowski's "Grate art is horseshit; buy tacos":-) was painted on the front of the building for more than a decade. The graffiti noted by Jane Dark is a collection of 1) exemplary graffiti, which gives a feel for the time/place 2) graffiti which was muralized or especially notable because it was so big, so obvious, there for so long, a part of the history of Berkeley as well as Barrington, because it was outside the building or in the street.-<a href="../../../c/i/n/User%7ECindery_01fc.html" title="User:Cindery">Cindery</a> 22:59, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

I think it's fine if you are here, but also think you should be here because you are assuming good faith, and want to contribute constructively to the article, not because you want to do Hipocrite's "dirty work," or think he is "always right," etc. Your initial comments to the article <i>were</i> full of negative, unhelpful subjective bias "this is written like a memoir" etc. Note that Hipocrite was involved in the EL dispute.-<a href="../../../c/i/n/User%7ECindery_01fc.html" title="User:Cindery">Cindery</a> 18:54, 21 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Um, here is your first post--from this very thread: "I have read the discussion. It should go no further than hipocrites first post here. What else is there to discuss? This whole article reads like a vanity piece. You can't write an article based on your own memories of the historical events. They may well be true but they are not verifiable. Even if they are verifiable they are probably not notable. Is LSD punch notable? This was Berkeley, didn't everyone have LSD punch? This is an encyclopedia. It should not be written in the style of a blog. Worse it should not be citing blogs as a source. David D. (Talk) 23:03, 19 January 2007 (UTC)" --I think it was very nice of us not to react that to the personal accusations/negative subjective comments, etc. It was fairly easy to AGF that you just didn't know anything about the subject/didn't read any of the refs in the article, esp. because you fixated on the LSD punch--which is well-documented. (Even the NYT notes it, in a ref not used.) I think you should take a deep breath, step back, and return when you can calmly read the discussions and contribute to them constructively in a way that moves the conversation forward. You are rehashing points already put to rest, posting rapidly, etc.--you seem personally upset. I also think it would be good for you to take some time to consider the biases you may have brought here after reading Hipocrite's "request for input."-<a href="../../../c/i/n/User%7ECindery_01fc.html" title="User:Cindery">Cindery</a> 19:51, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>(undent) Your intitial comments/the attitude you brought here are 1)subjective 2)negative. You needn't have any personal experience of the subject but merely to have read the references to provided to be aware that the article is not a "memoir." It's actually a very carefully edited summary, with an eye on both what was most notable, and the POV issues (which are depicting Barrington accurately but not too negatively, and trying to inlcude decades besides the 80s, although that is when it got the most press). It doesn't seem to have occurred to you that it's possible both knowledge of the subject and mastery of available references were utilized, which is the most beneficial combination for a Wiki article. For example, you seem to think that whomever wrote the LSD punch bit did so out of "vanity." But, I wrote the LSD punch bit. I hate LSD, I blew off that specific party, and I'm not much of a Primus fan. In spite of my distaste for LSD, I included info about it because it was particularly significant in the history of Barrington. (That party was "the last straw" leading to the vote to close it, and a major musician titled an album after it. The link to Primus was there, and "seven hospitalized" ref was listed in the ref section at the time you made your comments--it doesn't seem that you even glanced at the ref section, etc.) Last but not least, dpbsmith is not "making the same points" as you are, he is addressing Jane Dark.-<a href="../../../c/i/n/User%7ECindery_01fc.html" title="User:Cindery">Cindery</a> 20:50, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Whether or not a book is updated has zero to do with its reliability--else the whole textbook industry would collapse, as well as the publishing industry itself, as new editions, corrections, and appendixes come out every second. The Green Book includes two parts, if you look at it--one is general co-op history, the second is "Counterculture's Last Stand." The Guy Lillian part is an official USCA pub, and the second is a thesis which was supervised by Reginald Zelnick, a qualified authority.

(I.e., the POV one would <i>expect</i> me to have, or Adam to have would be against citing the Green Book as a major ref. Note the rebuttal to the Green Book in external links.

<dd>Good to see the smiley face on the end of the post. A thesis is owned by the university, and cannot be licensed by its author- but that's neither here nor there and it's an example of the useless wikilawyering that has gone on from almost single contributor to this page, and has spilled over to other spaces of the 'pedia. I admit, I touched on it myself there. The point is that everyone here wants to own the article rather than collaborate; paranoia and partisanship run abound. Consider the fact that we have over 1.5 million articles and that this kind of content dispute effects every single other one of those articles by touching on the integrity of the project. <b>This isn't aimed at you specifically Cindery, it's aimed at everyone involved</b>.

<dd>Cindery, if the Green Book web site can just be updated to add content that you think is important, why is it any different to a personal web site? Just because you do not personally edit it does not make it reliable. We have already seen how conveniently the graffiti went up on the blog. And now it sounds it will equally conveniently be added as an addendum to the Green Book. We don't work that whay here. Given all resources available before you started editing here there appears to be no reliable sources to assess the significance of the graffiti. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_D._77aa.html" title="User:David D.">David D.</a> <a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavid_D._d1e6.html" title="User talk:David D.">(Talk)</a> 14:01, 21 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Any book can be updated at any time--they're updated every second. It's completely irrelevant/a red herring. (Re blogs of professional journalists: it doesn't seem to have occurred to you that I am not the only person who reads this page/has an interest in Barrington. Note that I did not create or add any part of the graffiti section. Also, you--and a few others-- seem to find the possible scenario that someone decided, "hmm, this graffiti existed and isn't recorded in an accessible, updatable online location, but it should be" some sort of outrage. Anyone has the right to "record the graffiti"--or write whatever else they want about anything--at any time. In this case, freedom of the press/freedom of speech resulted in an indirect benefit to Wikipedia. The "outrage" is absurd, and has no place here: there is no Wiki policy which states that professional journalists may not write about whatever they want whenever they want, nor will there ever be. Continued and belabored attack of the source has made it seem to me that a small group of people who have never made any constructive edits to this article merely want to delete a section out of something other than a "concern for policy," and are furious that a source was provided--which does not serve Wikipedia, as Wikipedia needs sources.)-<a href="../../../c/i/n/User%7ECindery_01fc.html" title="User:Cindery">Cindery</a> 18:35, 21 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I'm not outraged. It is just a matter of fact from observation. The graffiti does not appear to be notable, there does not appear to be a notable source for it. The only people who are fighting for its inclusion are people who lived there (read <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVANITY_751a.html" title="WP:VANITY">WP:VANITY</a>). The threshold for inclusion in wikipedia is quite low. Nevertheless this graffiti does not currently come close.</dd>
<dd>Of course books come out with new editions all the time, however, this green book is not like those publihed by recognised publishers. In fact, you implied above that the online version will be updated to convey the importance of the graffiti, sounds like vanity to me. How can we know that this site is not just a personal website where the user is rewriting history to express an opinion not recognised elsewhere? The only one outraged seems to be you, Cindery, since there is a stream of people visiting this page to express concern that you are adding material to wikipedia that fails the wikipedia threshold for inclusion.</dd>
<dd>There is a wiki policy that states that journalists may not write about whatever they want on wikipedia (no original research), there is also a consensus that blogs are not reliable so you appear to be mistaken, and this has nothing to do with free speech. Find a reliable source that indicates this graffiti is notable.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">"Co-op that chaos killed"</span></h2>
<p>Some or all of this quote should be incorporated as well, from a section of the article named "UNIQUE OPPORTUNITIES":</p>
<p>"Barrington has nurtured a spirit unavailable elsewhere on campus, from nude dinner parties to ritual television destruction to a museum of original wall art. But it had a bleak underside. It was known for noise and destruction and for offering a crash pad to the nonstudent left and teenage runaways.</p>
<p><i>Barrington has a larger-than-life reputation,</i> says Lincoln Madison, president of the co-op association, Berkeley's second-largest landowner. <i>All across the continent, people know it as a drug den and anarchist household.</i></p>
<p>The hall was founded in 1933. The complaints started piling up in the early 1960s; more than 100 complaints have been filed. One example from 1983: <i>Resident complains not fit for habitability. Live boa constrictor, fire, dried blood on her door, food and burning matches thrown at dinner, person wandering through halls brandishing a whip and striking the walls with it.</i></p>
<p>But there were certain rules. Graffiti was limited to stairwells, and mural-tampering was punishable by a $ 75 fine and possible eviction." -<a href="../../../c/i/n/User%7ECindery_01fc.html" title="User:Cindery">Cindery</a> 06:58, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Why is Jane Dark considered a reliable source?</span></h2>
<p><a href="../../../c/i/n/User%7ECindery_01fc.html" title="User:Cindery">Cindery</a> has made a number of remarks from which I infer that she thinks the main point at issue is whether a certain blog is or is not by Jane Dark. He seems to suggest that there is consensus on this talk page that Jane Dark is considered a reliable source.</p>
<p>I'd like a clear explanation of why Jane Dark would necessarily be considered a reliable source.</p>
<p>Not only does Wikipedia have no article on <a href="../../../j/a/n/Jane_Dark_2c39.html" title="Jane Dark">Jane Dark</a>, the only mention of that name in Wikipedia <a href="http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=site:en.wikipedia.org+%22jane+dark%22&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=site:en.wikipedia.org+%22jane+dark%22&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8" rel="nofollow">appears to be</a> the name of a fictional character in a novel. There's no entry for Sugarhigh and there are four search hits, none relevant. Wikipedia's threshold for inclusion of blogs is not terribly high, and if this is a blog so noteworthy that we consider it to be a reliable source I'm surprised we don't have an article on it.</p>
<p>Cindery says Jane Dark is a contributor to <i>The New York Times.</i> That would not, of course, necessarily make her a reliable source. But in fact there are only nine occurrences of "Jane Dark" in a search of the complete New York Times database, and none of them are relevant. Seven of them are dated 1942 or earlier. (None are contributions by anyone named Jane Dark. Most do not even contain the name Jane Dark, but appear to be OCR and search engine glitches, e.g. "Jane Clark.")</p>
<p>Since Cindery says there is consensus, I'd like to have that explanation from someone <i>other than</i> Cindery. This consensus may be implicit already on this talk page, but it does not leap out at me. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 18:22, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>(undent) Wrong: RS clearly states that professional journalist's blogs are an exception. Jane Dark is a professional journalist. There was then a rather tedious and extremely overheated discussion about whether Jane Dark is Jane Dark. That was settled.-<a href="../../../c/i/n/User%7ECindery_01fc.html" title="User:Cindery">Cindery</a> 19:09, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Given the timeline for the inclusion of the information in the blog it fails RS. In fact, it means that blog can never be trusted again. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_D._77aa.html" title="User:David D.">David D.</a> <a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavid_D._d1e6.html" title="User talk:David D.">(Talk)</a> 19:22, 21 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Wrong: see above in Green Book. Even continuing that argument is disruptive, as it has been pointed out repeatedly that it is a red herring. There is no Wiki policy which restricts freedom of the press/freedom of speech, nor will there ever be.-<a href="../../../c/i/n/User%7ECindery_01fc.html" title="User:Cindery">Cindery</a> 19:32, 21 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Huh? are you suggesting the press can write anything they want in wikipedia? No they can't. Wikipedia can take or leave what it chooses. That is not a free speech issue. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_D._77aa.html" title="User:David D.">David D.</a> <a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavid_D._d1e6.html" title="User talk:David D.">(Talk)</a> 19:35, 21 January 2007 (UTC)

<dl>
<dd>But wikipedia does not have to accept the blog as a reliable source. Jane Dark can write what she wants but the timeline leads to serious doubts of collusion, therefore, it is relevant. Also the blog does not tell us why the graffiti is notable. So even if Jane Dark's blog is a reliable source the notability of the graffiti has not been demonstrated. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_D._77aa.html" title="User:David D.">David D.</a> <a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavid_D._d1e6.html" title="User talk:David D.">(Talk)</a> 20:33, 21 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>1) "Wikipedia" already accepted that the blog is RS, and then moved on to a long, tedious, overheated debate about whether JD is JD. (Also, "Wikipedia" here means a small group of people leftover from the EL/YT dispute, and so is hardly "Wikipedia.":-) 2. the timeline, for the umpteenth time, is completely irrelevant and a red herring 3. the "notability" of the graffiti--in general and in specific--has been discussed ad nauseum. And as a reliable source, if Jane notes it, it's notable.-<a href="../../../c/i/n/User%7ECindery_01fc.html" title="User:Cindery">Cindery</a> 21:02, 21 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>One editor on the RS talk page said it <i>might</i> be OK. Did that person know all the facts of this case; new blog, timeline? These are not red herrings, your wikilawering is getting tiresome since none of those guidelines need to be followed if there is reasonable doubt. Where has notability be agreed to? I'm sorry but one source does not make it notable. One dubious source even less so. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_D._77aa.html" title="User:David D.">David D.</a> <a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavid_D._d1e6.html" title="User talk:David D.">(Talk)</a> 21:18, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Let's try this again:</p>
<ul>
<li>Since Cindery says there is consensus, I'd like to have that explanation from someone <i>other than</i> Cindery. From one or more of the other editors of this article who are part of that consensus. No counter-arguments, at least not yet. I just want someone who agrees with Cindery that anything by Jane Dark qualifies as being from a reliable source to explain why. (At Wikipedia, the term "reliable source" <i>usually</i> refers to a publication, not to the name of a contributor: an article in the Washington Post is from a reliable source, a forum posting by a user named Bob Woodward is not). <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 19:43, 21 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You need to read RS, and the discussion at RS--this is not a policy page, and explaining that self-published material by professional journalists is RS (and that this source in particular has already been well-established to be a respected professional journalist) doesn't need to happen every time someone new comes along and doesn't want to read the previous discussions. It's disruptive, making the make incredibly long, and is not fair or helpful to other editors who want to follow the conversation.-<a href="../../../c/i/n/User%7ECindery_01fc.html" title="User:Cindery">Cindery</a> 19:57, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Let's try this again:</p>
<ul>
<li>Since Cindery says there is consensus, I'd like to have that explanation from someone <i>other than</i> Cindery, because for whatever reason I have difficulty following her arguments. I would like a response from one or more of the other editors of this article who are part of that consensus. If these editors agree with Cindery that it would be counterproductive to present the explanation here, then on my Talk page. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 20:05, 21 January 2007 (UTC) P.

</ul>
<dl>
<dd>(edit conflict)Again, this is not a policy page--whether or not professional journalists' blogs are RS is covered at RS. The discussion of this particular journalist was a request for comment at RS. Your above statements about Jane Dark indicate to me that you have not read that discussion (where JSmith provided links to a chunk of Jane Dark's articles written as Jane Dark). Wikipedia is not a democracy, but consensus that Jane Dark is an RS is included in the above discussions "graffiti" and "only more seven more shopping days till Armageddon." It doesn't move the conversation forward to rehash it without reading previous discussions (esp. something as significant as a request for comment at RS.) Although I think it would be fine for someone to relate the RS discussion to you on your talkpage, I also think it would be simpler for you to read the RS discussion.-<a href="../../../c/i/n/User%7ECindery_01fc.html" title="User:Cindery">Cindery</a> 20:25, 21 January 2007 (UTC)

<p><i>""Wikipedia" already accepted that the blog is RS"</i> Could you show us where exactly "wikipedia" accepted this?

<dd>Actually, blogs may be used for facts about the person writing the blog, per RS. But that still doesn't help in this particular case.

<dd>You're all leaving out a very crucial element of RS: the source should match the claim. As the source is attesting to the existence of some graffitos, and not whether a new cancer drug is effective, I'd say it's a good match. It's not exactly an "exceptional claim" requiring peer review in scientific journals.:-) (This is officially the most overzealously over-investigated overcontested source ever, for such a match of source and claim, that I know of.)-<a href="../../../c/i/n/User%7ECindery_01fc.html" title="User:Cindery">Cindery</a> 20:03, 22 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>"<i>the most overzealously over-investigated overcontested source ever</i>", there is a very good reason for it too. It appears that you are trying to game the system. That goes down as well as a ton of bricks. Plus the main argument is not whether it existed but whether it is notable. Do you know any buildings in a university environment without graffiti? Why is this graffiti so notable? Also a "<i>credible, third-party publication</i>" would be required in addition to this personal blog, as noted in the <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_D._77aa.html" title="User:David D.">David D.</a> <a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavid_D._d1e6.html" title="User talk:David D.">(Talk)</a> 20:11, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I think your "game the system" lack of AGF is the problem, and it is not serving Wikipedia or the article. Again, I did not write the graffiti section, nor do I write Jane's blog. (A great deal has already been written here explaining the significance of graffiti in Barrington, and it has been pointed out that every ref in the article notes it as well. I recommend reading the sources, and the talkpage discussion. In fact, above, in "Ian Ray-Slingshot," there is a source not used which gives some interesting info about the graffiti--the graffiti dialogues "went on for years," which is true.)-<a href="../../../c/i/n/User%7ECindery_01fc.html" title="User:Cindery">Cindery</a> 20:41, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Read the Green Book--it has already been noted as a main ref. If you have Lexis, you can read all the SF Chronicle articles I noted above. Re "solicit" that has been addressed over and over again--I believe the last euphemism was "timeline." The "timeline" has nothing to do with Wiki policy, is a red herring and failure to AGF.-<a href="../../../c/i/n/User%7ECindery_01fc.html" title="User:Cindery">Cindery</a> 21:12, 22 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>We do not have to AGF all the time, this is a misapplication of the guideline. Re the graffiti in the article. The graffiti section made no effort to establish the notability of the graffiti (the quote above in the article would have been useful for one) and instead specific examples have been pasted. I think we need to quote the article and cite it with in-line quote. Half the problem here is that the reader cannot distinguish between sourced material and unsourced material. Second, the specific examples of the graffiti here are the same as those that appeared in the Jane Dark blog. Now i have to wonder why these specific examples are notable in the context of "<i>long graffiti debates, which would go on for years</i>"; they seem to be more like one off slogans. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_D._77aa.html" title="User:David D.">David D.</a> <a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavid_D._d1e6.html" title="User talk:David D.">(Talk)</a> 21:41, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think this is getting a bit off topic. Nobody is proposing the removal of references to graffiti in the article, just the one list of examples. The question is, are those examples all notable (and verifiable) enough to merit including in an encyclopedia article? Or is mentioning the graffiti in the text with a couple examples sufficient? --<a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMilo_H_Minderbinder_261f.html" title="User:Milo H Minderbinder">Milo H Minderbinder</a> 21:25, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>Note: thanks for acknowledging that. The discussions re the graffiti--which are now about 40x too long IMHO--have been continually confused re the general and specific, as each recent newcomer drops by, glances at the article without reading any of the references or the talkpage, and demands some sort of proof that the graffiti matters at all. As they are answered in turn, those who have been in the mix for a slightly longer time then address the specific graffiti in the same conversation, which gets confusing. And so the same conversation happens over and over.&#160;:-) Can I ask you please to read the previous discussions about the specific graffiti?

<dd>That's already been addressed, in great detail. Why do you believe it's not? (And note that the SF Chronicle reports specific graffitos, a precedent for noting specific graffitos). What you haven't addressed is: per RS, the source should match the claim. It;s not an exceptional claim, which should inspire any huge doubts; need for peer reviewed "proof"--it's graffiti, not brain surgery. Can you explain on what grounds you feel there is a need for "caution," what that caution consists of, or any reason to doubt JD, the claim, etc? (Or is it a simple case of IDONTLIKEIT?

<dd>This might explain some of the disconnect. That is a typo, and i have struck it out above. I think I originally wrote something along the lines of "try not to destroy the spirt" and I thought I had changed it to "try and maintain the spirt". I am embarrassed that i did not catch that when I proofed it before posting. The chronicle reference to specific graffiti looks promising. When this page gets unlocked we should tyr and get the in-line notes added so that specific references are easy to relate the text.

<dd>Cindery, you keep saying "A brief list is fine." Actually, it's not. Please stop trying to just dismiss our objections like that.

If you define "outside" as someone who has not read the references provided in the article, I suppose you could come to the conclusion that "insiders" and "ousiders" are at issue here. Remember, research is not original research. The standard for inclusion is not "must be obvious at cursory glance to someone who knows nothing about the subject and doesn't read sources provided."

<dd>If so, undue weight has already been covered here (and there weren't objections): graffiti was particularly significant at Barrington; the number of graffitos would be in the millions, 9 of them isn't undue weight--it's quite slight in comparison. It's useful/informative to give a brief list of examples. (The graffiti of UC Berkeley students in the 80s is different from the graffiti of NYC high school students in the Bronx in 2007, different from the graffiti of students in Paris in May '68, etc--all different kinds of graffiti. The graffiti of group of people in a specific time/place gives useful info about the people, the time, the place, just as any other form of writing would. If graffiti is a notable phenomenon/means of communication for a group of people in a specific time/place--NYC highschools, Paris in '68, the most famous student co-op in history, it's useful to give some examples.)-<a href="../../../c/i/n/User%7ECindery_01fc.html" title="User:Cindery">Cindery</a> 23:28, 22 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Perhaps, if two conditions were met. First, if the Barrington Hall graffiti were properly sourced—but they're not. One could imagine a wiki that would collect people's personal observations of things, oral history, material that have never been published before, original research, etc. but Wikipedia isn't that wiki. Second, if a good source attesting to the importance of the graffiti were cited—but you haven't done that either. You cite not-terribly-great sources that say <i>other things</i> about the graffiti, things from which <i>you</i> draw the conclusion that the graffiti were of great importance. What we need, and don't have, is something like a passage in a novel, or an item in a newspaper, where somebody says something like of "the famous Barrington Hall graffiti," as "like it says in Barrington Hall, 'Time is a crutch, eat mandarin oranges.'" During the late 1960s students used to write graffiti on a plywood wall at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, too; one I especially liked was "Virginity is like a bubble in the froth of life: one prick and it's gone." But there wasn't anything encyclopedic about them, and they didn't say anything particularly unique or profound about the University of WIsconsin. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 00:20, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>(Edit conflict)*First, there's an ongoing discussion about whether it is more elegant/useful to cite the Green Book 20x in the article, or to leave it as general ref. Let's leave the question of inline cites aside for now, for the purpose of discussion. Regarding the significance of graffiti in general--if you are truly interested enough to contribute as much to the talkpage on the issue as you have--please read the references listed in the article to satisfy yourself that it was significant. To address the specific graffiti viz RS and a source, Jane Dark is fine: the source should match the claim, and it's an excellent match. An expert on poetics and language with a demonstrated interest in graffiti is perfect for noting graffiti.

It was a distinct subculture, one that the SF Chronicle observed was one "Margaret Mead might have chosen" to study.-<a href="../../../c/i/n/User%7ECindery_01fc.html" title="User:Cindery">Cindery</a> 00:31, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>So, did the San Francisco Chronicle ever mention the graffiti?

<dd>But the examples of real interest seem to be the political discourse (similar to that described in Slingshot). The examples in the article do not seem to be in that category.

<dd>Off-topic side note:If you want my honest opinion, the only reason that there is not already a major book or documentary about Barrington is laziness and marijiuana. And leftover intergenerational agon. There is always talk, but it hasn't happened yet. The fact that the building is "gone" makes a doc harder. The boomers who lived there in the 60s "blame" the punks who lived there in the 80s for ruining it all. (See in external links, Allison Roberts' "Living with Pink Cloud.") The people who lived there in the 80s feel like hey, we just got stuck holding the bag--your bag, as a matter of fact. (See Joel Rane in external links, "The Fall of Barrington Hall.") So there is a lack of cooperation. Maybe someone from the 70s will bridge the gap. But graffiti was an 80s phenomenon, so old boomer hippies couldn't write about it anyway. (It started around 1978-1980. If you watch the "Onngh Yanngh" movie in external links, at the end, Onngh Yanngh "moved into Barrington Hall and took up the art of graffiti writing." But, on-topic, you still haven't addressed the point: examples of the graffiti differentiate the graffiti from the larger more abstract concept of "graffiti." -<a href="../../../c/i/n/User%7ECindery_01fc.html" title="User:Cindery">Cindery</a> 01:03, 23 January 2007 (UTC)

Re: graffiti, the photograph captions on LexisNexis read as follows: "GRAPHIC: PHOTO (2),(1) Not all Barrington Hall's murals are politically inspired Here, a French impressionist lady gazes at the goings-on, (2) Student John Benson, a resident of Barrington Hall, clear ed out his two-room suite last week and awaits eviction The graffiti overhead says, 'Welcome to the <i>I can be more radical than you</i> house,' and, 'An Oasis of Madness in a World Gone Sane' , PHOTOS BY SCOTT SOMMERDORF, THE CHRONICLE" The 1989 New York Times article about the co-op's closing also describes some of the murals, but not graffiti. <b><a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchi_5602.html" title="User:Schi">schi</a></b> <sup><a href="../../../s/c/h/User_talk%7ESchi_51f0.html" title="User talk:Schi"><font color="orange">talk</font></a></sup> 07:53, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If we come to some kind of agreement regarding the graffiti I can unlock it myself. Alternatively we can make a request at WP:RFPP if you would rather someone else do it.</dd>
<dd>My stance is two-fold. <b>First</b> of all, the blog, bonus sugar, isn't a reliable source in the context it's being used in. We do have some graffiti backed up with news articles, and thats good. <b>Secondly</b>, since this is an article I'd prefer to treat the subject of the graffiti in prose and not in list form.

<dd>Because in this case the distinction matters--a group of editors who were involved in the You Tube/EL dispute have been primarily involved here--and in general a great deal of confusion/repeating the same arguments over and over has occurred because those who were not regular editors refused to read the sources in the article or previous discussions, which makes determing what the objections are difficult, hence a request for summary.-<a href="../../../c/i/n/User%7ECindery_01fc.html" title="User:Cindery">Cindery</a> 19:40, 23 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Regardless of whether or not you believe the "irregular editors" have read the sources or previous discussions, all editors are entitled to have equal input on any given article.

<dd>The disctinction is important for establishing the quality of any "consensus." Wikipedia is not a democracy. There is no User:Astandhope. If you read the previous discussions, you will see the third regular editor. It is my policy to ask you to do this when you overlook something extremely obvious, because I think "if he missed that, it is likely he is missing much else"--if you read the discussions, you will be able to contribute as usefully as possible, I believe. (For example, when you blanked the section, and it was pointed out that one of the graffitos has never been disputed, you demanded to know which one. That graffito is the title of one of the longest threads on the talkpage.) It is not unreasonable to ask you to read or reread the discussions, if you demonstrate that you are not doing s/not reading them carefully enough to note the obvious. Rather, it is unreasonable of you to demand that the discussions be repeated over and over because you cannot be bothered to read them/keep track of them/note the obvious.-<a href="../../../c/i/n/User%7ECindery_01fc.html" title="User:Cindery">Cindery</a> 20:00, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>From what I can tell, by "The source matches the claim" she's not talking about the topic matching, but the level of "exceptionalness".

The blog of a professional journalist is a clear exception to blogs under RS, the author has been published by reliable third party pubs to an enormous extent on language, especially ephemeral pop language and poetic/metaphorical language, and the subject of graffiti in Barrington--both in general and specific--has also been published in reliable third party publications.

<dd>Actually Argyriou didn't say that. He said "There are sources which meet WP:RS for the graffiti which Cindery reports, though it might take a little work to find them, as they're mostly on paper, not online. I'll spend a little time digging into my records this weekend; and failing that, I'll contact George Proper, who probably does have something citable. (Incidentally, I've seen most of the graffiti which Cindery reports, back when I lived in the USCA.)" Note that he didn't say anything about "bonussugar", so that's only one person who agrees with you that it's a reliable source. And he just said that other sources exist. We're still waiting for those sources. Why don't you give up on the blog and just find sources for the other items? While I don't know if that would convince people that the list should stay, at least the RS argument could be put to bed.

<dd>Cindery, please stop this behaviour of distinguishing between 'regular editors' and everyone else. All editors on this site have equal say, regardless of the length of time that they have spent editing a particular article. The fact that some editors engaged in the YouTube discussion in the past is irrelevant and just shows that people with an interest in external links and youtube links discussed a particular instance on this site. Everyone on this article, you <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">should assume</a> is trying to improve it. What they are asking for is some sort of evidence to show that Jane Dark's opinions on this subject matter are of notability (is this her field of expertise?) and how is the list of graffiti notable/important (and why those specific ones, and who says those particular items are notable). You have not yet proven either of these so repeating your same arguments from above is not going to get anywhere.-<a href="../../../l/o/c/User%7ELocalzuk_3f68.html" title="User:Localzuk">Localzuk</a><sup><a href="../../../l/o/c/User_talk%7ELocalzuk_0fb5.html" title="User talk:Localzuk">(talk)</a></sup> 21:53, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Also, why does her being a language expert apply to a list of graffiti?

You would be best dropping that particular line of argument as it is a huge failure to assume good faith and is not looked upon kindly. It is not a valid point as it is an ad hominem attack on the characters of those who are arguing against you - which can also been seen as a violation of <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">the npa policy</a>.-<a href="../../../l/o/c/User%7ELocalzuk_3f68.html" title="User:Localzuk">Localzuk</a><sup><a href="../../../l/o/c/User_talk%7ELocalzuk_0fb5.html" title="User talk:Localzuk">(talk)</a></sup> 22:06, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Cindery, one of the things that goes with the WIkipedia territory is that there is no ownership of articles, not even by committee. A consensus lasts only as long as <i>everyone</i> editing the article is part of that consensus. When new editors come in, older editors need to convince them afresh of the validity of points that have been discussed before. Saying something like "we hashed this out long ago" doesn't work. Either you need to explain it afresh, or you need to give a specific link to a discussion that so clear and convincing that the new editor will agree and come on board.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>I think there's a reasonable limit to that--new editors can read the previous recent discussions and sources, to avoid endless repetition, which can be disruptive, and not fair to those trying to follow the discussion. "Convince" anyone of the "validity" of anything doesn't absolve any editor of the obligation to reasonably do research, follow the conversation, etc. Anyone who goes to an article they've never edited before, about a subject they don't know anything about and "boldly" begins demanding "proof" of this or that without reading sources provided or the ongoing talkpage discussions is likely to be met with a less friendly reception than has been offered here.-<a href="../../../c/i/n/User%7ECindery_01fc.html" title="User:Cindery">Cindery</a> 22:21, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>No, I think "notability" is a red herring and another version of IDONTLIKEIT. The graffiti examples have been included as examples. (Note that above, the section was originally titled "classic" Barrington graffiti--not by me--and that I had no objection to removing "classic," and in fact removed it myself.-<a href="../../../c/i/n/User%7ECindery_01fc.html" title="User:Cindery">Cindery</a> 23:26, 23 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Red herrings aside, do you insist on having all nine examples in a listified form? <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <small><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">Talk</a></small> 00:25, 24 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>And to follow up, for which of the nine has a source (other than bonussugar, of course) been found? --<a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMilo_H_Minderbinder_261f.html" title="User:Milo H Minderbinder">Milo H Minderbinder</a> 00:29, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I know we discussed this above Cindery. I did not get an explanation for why the JD graffiti ties into the slingshot quote:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"<i>Every surface in Barrington was covered with psychedelic murals and layer upon layer of graffiti. The graffiti wasn't just tags--it contained long debates about revolution, religion, art, everything. Ian's handwriting was often visible in the long graffiti debates, which would go on for years.</i>" <a href="http://slingshot.tao.ca/displaybi.php?0059022" class="external text" title="http://slingshot.tao.ca/displaybi.php?0059022" rel="nofollow">from Slingshot</a></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Are these examples of the "<i>long debates about revolution,religion, art, everything</i>"? It would seem those are the notable bit of graffiti that would be relevant to quote in this article, not "<i>just tags</i>". May be the JD tags inspired creativity from others? I'm happy to hear about those kinds of sources. But the JD blog asserts no notability except that JD remembers them. If that is the case why is graffiti memorable to JD notable? <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_D._77aa.html" title="User:David D.">David D.</a> <a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavid_D._d1e6.html" title="User talk:David D.">(Talk)</a> 02:11, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The Slingshot quote is not in the article--I pointed you to that because you wanted a source about the graffiti in general (and do not have access to the refs in the article/do not want to read the Green Book, do not have Lexis access, or some combination thereof.)-<a href="../../../c/i/n/User%7ECindery_01fc.html" title="User:Cindery">Cindery</a> 05:18, 24 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I think the slingshot quote would be a good addition to the article. I don't understand the rest of your argument, are you telling me the Green Book mentions the specific JD graffiti tags and why they are notable? If not, why is the Green Book relevant to my point above?</dd>
<dd>I think it is your task to convince us they are notable, not the other way around. More to the point, convince the reader of wikipedia. At present the notability of the specific graffiti tags in the article are not supported by explanatory text or in-line references. It would be desirable if the significance of the different graffiti tags is more clear in the article, assuming they are significant. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_D._77aa.html" title="User:David D.">David D.</a> <a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavid_D._d1e6.html" title="User talk:David D.">(Talk)</a> 06:16, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
